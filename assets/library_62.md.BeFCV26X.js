They are distinct from a drumming group or troupe in that the drum circle is an end in itself rather than preparation for a performance. They can range in size from a handful of players to circles with thousands of participants. Drum circles are related to other community-based music gatherings such as flute circles or vocal improvisation groups. In 1991, during testimony before the United States Senate Special Committee on Aging, Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart stated: > Typically, people gather to drum in drum \\"circles\\" with others from the > surrounding community. The drum circle offers equality because there is no > head or tail. It includes people of all ages. The main objective is to share > rhythm and get in tune with each other and themselves. To form a group > consciousness. To entrain and resonate. By entrainment, I mean that a new > voice, a collective voice, emerges from the group as they drum > together.Rhythm As A Tool For Healing and Health in The Aging process A drum circle Types of group drumming and drum circles Drum circles originated in the United States during the late 1960s and early 1970s for any group of people, particularly counterculture groups, who gather (informally) to play music together. The terms \\"drum jam\\" or \\"jam session\\" could be substituted. Settings include beaches, parks, concert parking lots, festivals, and retreats. The determining criteria for a drum circle are that the music is improvised and co-created by the participants. Drum circles may or may not be open to the public, but the music is always a group expression, not constrained by genre, instrumentation, or directed by one person or sub-group. In Western countries, drum circles have developed into two main types: Community – free-form drumming, often open to the public and entirely improvised in-the-moment. Facilitated or Conducted – group drumming that is musically directed by a specific person, often called a facilitator or conductor. All forms of drum circles are used in a variety of settings and applications including; team building, recreational music-making, wellness, education, celebrations, spirituality, personal growth, etc. =The community drum circle= Community drum circles are informal gatherings of people who meet for the purpose of playing drums together. They often take place in public settings such as parks or at the beach, but may also be organized via a community center or similar body. Instrumentation centers around drums and percussion, but may include other instruments, such as flutes, didgeridoos, and other non-percussion instruments. Practically anything that can be banged on to make noise can be used as a percussion instrument such as cans, buckets, pipes, etc. One need not possess or purchase a drum to participate. Community drum circles differ from facilitated or conducted drum circles in that the music is entirely improvised through a process of group interaction. There may be a facilitator or moderator who acts to shape the experience through discrete actions, such as helping to maintain a steady beat, helping those who need it, and generally managing the environment to see that everyone is able to participate fully. The participants make up the music as they go along, using their listening and playing skills to make musical connections and express themselves in any and all ways that feel right. Participation is voluntary and often includes drumming, singing or chanting, dancing, and listening. Community drum circles often attract both regular and drop-in participants of all ages and can take place just about anywhere. Community drum circles are the original and most popular form of improvised community drumming. =The facilitated or conducted drum circle= Facilitated drum circle A \\"facilitated\\" drum circle is a form of group drumming in which a person seeks to focus the intent and improve the quality and effect of the activity, making it easier for people to effectively participate by taking a more directive approach. The facilitator (leader) takes responsibility for the physical space, arranging chairs and instruments to optimize communication and connection in the group. He or she may provide a range of instruments to create a full and balanced percussion orchestra. In this way, the experience can be thought of as a \\"standardized drumming circle,\\" as opposed to the more free-flowing and open community drum circle. The facilitator is constantly monitoring the music in the group, and generally being encouraging and accepting of participant ideas. In this way, the facilitator takes on a role similar to that of a music teacher or drumming instructor whose goal is to empower the participants and encourage them to share their ideas. In the beginning, the facilitator directs the music through verbal and non-verbal cueing. Cues, which often mirror the movements of an orchestral conductor, are directed at the participants, who respond to the leader. This creates a leader/follower dynamic between the facilitator and the participants. Actions such as rolling (rumbling), starting, stopping, raising/lowering the volume, accents, and when to play/not play are often given by the facilitator. Conducting is not normally part of a traditional (community) drum circle, and therefore makes this type of circle a unique experience and very different from a community circle. Facilitators with training and experience in other areas and professions, such as music education, music therapy, and corporate training, may use a range of tools and approaches that enable them to work with diverse populations. These types of experiences are more accurately referred to as 'drumming programs,' rather than drum circles, in the traditional sense.  Other forms of drumming  Other forms of drumming that are related to drum circles include: * \\"Guided Interactive Drumming\\" - highly structured drumming-based programs that are led by an individual or group to reach non-musical goals. * \\"Drum Classes\\" - education-based drumming for the purposes of building musical skills and knowledge. * \\"Drum Ensembles\\" - performance-oriented drumming groups who practice and perform music on drums, often for dance. * \\"Clinical Improvisation\\" - a drumming group within a Music Therapy session, led by a certified Music Therapist. Group drumming with a spiritual focus =Neotribalism= Is an inclusive way of life that is focused on creating a positive enhancement of self of identity while enforcing a no harm to the collective group attitude. Neotribalism belief system is evident in the music of Neotribalism; the postmodern drum circle where the only leader is the preservation of the groove or music consciousness this development of musical consciousness takes the participation of individual to create a collective more powerful and beautiful display of sight and sound. \\"In beat life begins and it is only the maintenance and sacred keeping of the beat that life will endure\\". =Neopaganism= Neopagans have created another type of drum circle. At Neopagan festivals, people gather around a large bonfire, the drummers generally sitting on one side to encourage better listening. The musicians sit together and play while dancers dance and circle around the fire. Often, those present will stay and play throughout the night until dawn, treating the evening as a magical (or alchemical) working. Sound is not limited to drumming alone; there is also chanting, singing, poetry, and spoken word pieces. This type of drum circle is not usually facilitated. =Shamanic drumming circles= This type of circle tends to center around Native American Cultural drums and rattles but is primarily focusing on the spiritual rather than the musical aspects of the culture. It is a facilitated circle but the leader is facilitating a shamanic journey process rather than a musical event. Shamanic drumming is generally simple and repetitive, often considered as a form of prayer or method of trance induction, rather than as music or entertainment. During a shamanic trance or shamanic journey, the shaman uses the steady beat of the drum as a \\"lifeline\\" to find the way back to the world of ordinary consciousness. Note that in these cultures, the term \\"Drum Circle\\" would certainly not be used. Rather, the terms 'drumming ceremony\\" or \\"ceremonial drumming\\" would be more accurate. =Medicine wheel drumming and prayer ceremony= Atikamekw drum circle at a pow-wow in Manawan, Quebec, Canada Practiced by various groups, and outlined step-by-step in the book, \\"Finding Sanctuary in Nature: Simple Ceremonies in the Native American Tradition for Healing Yourself and Others,\\" by Jim PathFinder EwingJim PathFinder Ewing, Finding Sanctuary in Nature: Simple Ceremonies in the Native American Tradition for Healing Yourself and Others Findhorn Press, Scotland, 2007 (page 147), \\"the medicine wheel drum circle prayer ceremony\\" recognizes the four directions—east, south, west, north—as spiritual Powers that can help balance and heal. The ceremony has four rounds, with drumming by all participants at the instruction of the leader allowing the energy of each direction in each round to come into the circle to facilitate prayers and healing. It has been described as \\"like a sweat lodge without the sweat\\" (page 148, Finding Sanctuary). Ewing held these ceremonies each month for seven years, as outlined in the book, in addition to shamanic drum circles, and at various sites from coast to coast in the United States since the late 1990s. Groups based on his example and the instructions outlined in the book have resulted in other groups forming worldwide. This description is not of a drum circle in the sense that the term is commonly used. It is a drumming ceremony that takes place in a circle, but very different in content and form than a drum circle, more of an improvised community drumming jam. This type should probably be listed under shamanic or spiritual drumming and not under drum circles. Notable figures in the group drumming movement Commercial drum circle groups and companies exist in most countries to serve various markets. There is also a growing body of people working in places such as hospitals, prisons, and hospices using drumming as a form of recreational and supportive music making. Music therapists often use various forms of group drumming (including improvised drumming) in their work to reach therapeutic goals and objectives. 180px USA *Mickey Hart *Arthur Hull *Kalani References  ;Notes ;Bibliography *The Healing Power of the Drum, by Robert Lawrence Friedman, MA. *Finding Sanctuary in Nature: Simple Ceremonies in the Native American Tradition for Healing Yourself and Others, by Jim PathFinder Ewing (Nvnehi Awatisgi), Findhorn Press, Scotland, 2007. * Freestyle Community Drum Circles, by Rick Cormier.

He wrote over a hundred operas. Johann Adolf Scheibe (writing in 1745) considered him an equal to Johann Kuhnau, George Frideric Handel and Georg Philipp Telemann (also associated with the Oper am Gänsemarkt), but his work was largely forgotten for many decades.  Life  Keiser was born in Teuchern (in present-day Saxony-Anhalt), son of the organist and teacher Gottfried Keiser (born about 1650), and educated by other organists in the town and then from age eleven at the Thomasschule in Leipzig, where his teachers included Johann Schelle and Johann Kuhnau, direct predecessors of Johann Sebastian Bach. In 1694, he became court-composer to the duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, though he had probably come to the court already as early as 1692 to study its renowned operas, which had been going on since 1691, when the city had built a 1,200-seat opera house. Keiser put on his first opera Procris und Cephalus there and, the same year, his opera Basilius was put on at Hamburg and, as the musicologist Johann Mattheson noted, \\"received with great success and applause.\\" This was a fruitful period for him – composing not only operas, but arias, duets, cantatas, sérénades, church music and big oratorios, background music – all for the city's use. About 1697 he settled permanently in Hamburg, and became the chief composer at the highly renowned Oper am Gänsemarkt (now rebuilt as the Hamburg State Opera) in Hamburg from 1697 to 1717; however he was actually first the director in 1702, and was not at various times from then to 1717, almost each time due to political instabilities. From 1703 to 1709, Keiser changed the opera house from being a public institution to a commercial venture with two to three performances a week, in contrast to the opera houses intended for the nobility. He helped transition opera from the mid-Baroque to the late-Baroque. He introduced a more varied type of aria into his operas, with more passive arias, and also faster arias being introduced into his bilingual and non- bilingual operas all by the 1703/04 season, Nebukadnezar, and Salomon. Early in 1704, when he was conducting the operas Nebukadnezar and Salomon in Hamburg, the season had to be unexpectedly concluded, for reasons most likely related to government affairs. He went to Brunswick, and afterward Weissenfels, to reconnect with areas in which he was previously active. He ended up coming out with a masterpiece, Almira, at Weissenfels, in July. He stayed there for a while, spending many holidays there, eventually heading back to Hamburg shortly after Easter in 1705, to produce a comeback to Händel's Nero, produced in February 1705. Keiser would have to face Händel again, but this time he would be at home, and Händel had switched to the phonetic Italian version of his name, Georgio Friderico Hendel. Hendel would put on what was planned as a double opera, but was in fact two, Florindo, and Daphne; he did that in January 1708, coming back from Italy. Keiser would counter that by eventually coming out with La forza dell'amore, oder, Die von Paris entführte Helena and Desiderius, König der Langobarden in the 1708/09 season, not as the theatre's manager, but as someone responding to political insecurities causing the opera company to be disorderly. Keiser worked in the background. Keiser would continue as the director probably when things got more stable in the city, maybe in 1710, and he advanced in composing, coming with his own passion music in 1712, which Hendel would readily challenge in 1716. In 1718, with the Hamburg Opera defunct, he left Hamburg to seek other employment, going to Thuringia and then Stuttgart. From this period three manuscripts of trio sonatas for flute, violin and basso continuo survive. During the summer of 1721, he returned to Hamburg, but only a few weeks later made a rapid exit to Copenhagen with a Hamburg opera troupe, probably because of the growing influence of Georg Philipp Telemann, engaged by the city magistrate in Keiser's absence. Between 1721 and 1727, Keiser traveled back and forth between Hamburg and Copenhagen, receiving the title of Master of the Danish Royal Chapel. After the dissolution of the opera troupe, Keiser returned once more to Hamburg, but changes in its operation made repeating past success difficult. Three operas from the period between 1722 and 1734 survive. Personal relations with Telemann remained good, with Telemann programming several productions of Keiser's operas. In 1728 he became the St. Mary's Cathedral precentor of Hamburg (succeeding Johann Mattheson to the post), and wrote largely church music there until his death in 1739. In an obituary, his colleague Mattheson described him as \\"the greatest opera composer in the world\\".

It is the capital of the Yatenga Province and one of its subdivisions the Ouahigouya Department. It is also the biggest town in the Nord Region. It is the third largest city in the country with a population of 122,677. It is situated north-west of Ouagadougou. View of Ouahigouya (2005) The city itself has a stadium, a private non-profit Paediatric Hospital with 36 beds for giving birth and 24 beds for children suffering of severe malnutrition, a post office with internet access and at least one Ecobank bank branch. History The city was founded in 1757 as the capital of Yatenga one of a number of Mossi Kingdoms. The city still bears testimony to its role as capital of the Yatenga Kingdom in its name, the meaning of which is come and prostrate yourselves. In the Christmas War of 1985, the city's marketplace was bombed by Malian forces, almost 100 people being killed. Economy Mainly of an agriculturally based economy, Ouahigouya also has some commerce and craft industry. The two dams just north and west of the town permit it to pursue some vegetable planting aided by irrigation, such as tomatoes, carrots, onions and mainly potatoes. But as a whole both the region and the city are heavily dependent on rainfall and it is according to it that the population's well being mostly depends on. Millet and sorghum though are the basis of the local diet, much like the surrounding regions. The small craft industry here is mainly focused on leather and tanneries. The little industry in the region is mostly geared towards gold prospecting, and is carried out by a large company. In terms of commerce, the city takes advantage of its relative ease of access to the country's capital, Ouagadougou, to buy manufactured products and resell to the local economy. This is greatly facilitated by the asphalted road linking the two cities. Places of interest Features of Ouahigouya include Naaba Kango's tomb, the Yatenga Naba's compound and an artificial lake.

Eventually they launch a surprise attack, defeating the local Havenite garrison and taking control of Hell. Meanwhile, the Havenite Navy, under the new and aggressive leadership of Admiral Esther McQueen, goes on the offensive and launches a series of simultaneous and devastating attacks on Manticore and her allies, even hitting Manticoran territory for the first time in the war.

Still needing to escape from the planet, Honor and her allies hatch a plan to capture as many Havenite ships as possible. With a sizable fleet of captured enemy vessels (the so-called \\"Elysian Space Navy\\") under her leadership, the former prisoners defeat a StateSec armada and evacuate the prison planet. After two years, Honor finally returns home, along with half a million former political prisoners and POWs.

Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies at the University of Pennsylvania—commonly called the Katz Center—is a postdoctoral research center devoted to the study of Jewish history and civilization. History The Katz Center is the continuation of two pioneering institutions devoted to advanced research: Dropsie College for Hebrew and Cognate Learning and the Annenberg Research Institute. Dropsie College was the first accredited doctoral program in Judaic Studies in the world. The Annenberg Research Institute was a center for advanced study in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam founded in 1986 with staff and collections carried over from Dropsie College. The founding Director of the Katz Center was David B. Ruderman. The current Ella Darivoff Director is Stephen P. Weitzman. The Katz Center was established in 1993 as a part of the School of Arts and Sciences at the University of Pennsylvania. It was first named the Center for Judaic Studies (CJS); later, the Center for Advanced Judaic Studies (CAJS)—and in 2008, the Katz family endowed the Center in memory of former Board chair and philanthropist Herbert D. Katz. It is located in an award winning building across from Independence National Historical Park in Center City Philadelphia. The Katz Center houses offices for scholars who are in residence throughout the academic year for postdoctoral research, as well as an extensive library of Judaica, a reading room, and seminar and meeting spaces. Fellowship Program The Katz Center's primary activity is an academic fellowship program, which brings scholars from around the world to Philadelphia for a semester or a year. The program supports approximately 20 fellows each year; scholars apply if their current research fits the annual theme. Weekly seminars allow fellows to share their findings with each other and with invited scholarly guests; annual conferences are open to the wider academic community. Dropsie University Complex In addition, the Katz Center offers public programs and a summer intensive course for graduate students. Library at the Katz Center The combination of the Dropsie/Annenberg library with the Judaica holdings of the Penn Libraries resulted in a 350,000-volume collection of Judaica, including more than 8,000 rare books and an assortment of cuneiform tablets. There are also 451 codices in eleven alphabets and 24 languages and dialects. Some of the languages and dialects represented include Hebrew, English, German, Yiddish, Ladino, Arabic, Latin, Judeo-Arabic, Armenia, Telugu, and Syriac. Fragments from the Cairo Geniza and others written in Coptic and Demotic on papyrus round out the collection. The library also holds the personal letters of more than 50 Jewish-American leaders from the 1800s and 1900s, including Isaac Leeser, Sabato Morais, and Abraham Neuman (three ministers of Congregation Mikveh Israel in Philadelphia), Cyrus Adler (president, Dropsie College, Mikveh Israel, American Jewish Committee, Jewish Theological Seminary of America; librarian, Smithsonian Institution), Charles Cohen (president, Mikveh Israel, Fairmount Park Commission), his journalist sister Mary M. Cohen, yiddish journalist Ben Zion Goldberg, and the benefactor Moses Dropsie.  Publications  The Katz Center houses the Jewish Quarterly Review, the oldest continuously-published journal of Judaic Studies in English. Founded in England in 1888 under the editorship of Claude Montefiore and Israel Abrahams, JQR first came to the U.S. in 1911 under the editorship of Solomon Schechter and Cyrus Adler. It is currently published by Penn Press. Cairo Geniza fragment is part of the collection. The Katz Center partners with the University of Pennsylvania Press to publish the book series Jewish Cultures and Contexts. The series is edited by Shaul Magid, Francesca Trivellato, and Steven Weitzman.

He added Athesinus to his signature, referring to his origin in today's South Tyrol. His last positions were at the court of court of Stuttgart. He is regarded as a \\"leading German composer of choral music in the later 16th century\\". While many of his works are lost, a Passion, many expressive songs, and a song cycle are extant. The complete works were published by Bärenreiter in 14 volumes.  Life  Lechner was born in South Tyrol in 1553. Lechner was originally Catholic but became a Protestant as an adult. As a boy, he sang in the Bayrische Kantorei in Landshut, led by Orlande de Lassus. It was a group of the Bavarian Hofkapelle (court chapel). He was regarded as Lassus' \\"most distinguished pupil and a great creative force in German music\\". Lechner was probably in Italy during the 1570s. From 1575, he taught at a school in Nuremberg. He led an association of upper-class music lovers, , which sponsored the publication of religious and secular works. He married a burgher's daughter in Nuremberg and his intent was to live there with his wife. From 1582, he was responsible for music in the town. In 1584, he was appointed as by Eitel Friedrich IV, Count of Hohenzollern in Hechingen. As the count supported the Counter-Reformation, Lechner left his employment after one year due to their religious differences. He then asked Louis III, Duke of Württemberg, for protection. Lechner became a tenor singer at the court of Stuttgart, later becoming a court composer and then a court , and church musician at the Stiftskirche. Lechner was ill for years. He died on 9 September 1606 in Stuttgart. Works Cover of New German Songs, for Bass, Leonhard Lechner, 1582 Lechner published twelve part-song collections during the 1570s. In 1593, he composed a Passion, Historia der Passion and Leidens unsers einigin Erlösers und Seligmachers Jesu Christi, in Württemberg. The 1593 work has five movements and is for a four-part mixed choir with a German text based on the four Gospels. Barely any of his compositions were printed during his lifetime. Some manuscripts are extant while many of his works are lost. His swan song was Deutsche Sprüche von Leben und Tod (German sentences of life and death). His works have been published from the 1920s, including the Passion, the Deutsche Sprüche, and his setting of the Song of Songs. A complete edition of his extant works was commissioned by the Heinrich Schütz Society and completed in 14 volumes by Bärenreiter edited by Konrad Ameln. Reception The Larousse Encyclopedia Of Music stated, \\"His music is remarkable for its dramatic power and emotional intensity, qualities particularly evident in the fifteen Deutsche Sprüche von Leben und Tod, which reveal his sure command of techniques ranging from fluent polyphony to chordal writing.\\" John C. Hughes of The Choral Journal wrote, \\"Upon deeper investigation, one finds Lechner's Passion not only to be a well-constructed work of art ... but also a strong influence upon later contributions to the Passion genre.\\" He is listed as an ecumenical saint.

It is the ninth book in the Honor Harrington series. Plot summary The book begins hours after the end of the previous novel. Honor Harrington and her \\"Elysian Space Navy\\" arrive at Manticoran-controlled space, only to discover that she was believed dead, that her mother had given birth to twins (partly to satisfy the Graysons' need for an heir to her Steading), her cousin Devon has inherited her Manticoran title, and that the extent of her injuries will prevent her from returning to active naval duty for a couple of years, since she needs reconstructive surgery. To put Honor to good use, the Royal Manticoran Navy promotes her to Admiral (having received a battlefield promotion to that rank on HadesEchoes of Honor, p. 364) and places her at Saganami Island Naval Academy to teach future generations of naval officers. Queen Elizabeth III elevates Honor to Duchess Harrington. Meanwhile, Honor helps to prove that treecats are as intelligent as humans, and she eventually helps to develop an easy to understand sign language system, making full communication between humans and the treecats possible. After the daring attacks featured in the previous novel, the People's Republic of Haven seems to have the initiative. However, Manticore has a trump card that has the potential to end the war, in the form of devastatingly effective new technology and weapons fully integrated into a new massive heavy assault force, known as 8th fleet. The Star Kingdom's navy bides time, waiting for the opportune moment to strike. Chaos breaks up in the Havenite ranks, and the ambitious Admiral McQueen stages a coup that succeeds in killing Rob S. Pierre and almost all the members of the Havenite Committee of Public Safety, except for Oscar Saint-Just who manages to crush the coup by detonating a nuclear device secretly hidden within the navy headquarters. With the Committee and the military High Command in ruins, Saint-Just becomes the dictator of the People's Republic, and orders Admiral Thomas Theisman to take over the massive fleet guarding Haven. This proves to be an eventually fatal miscalculation. While Saint-Just believes Theisman is apolitical and trustworthy, in reality Theisman is plotting a coup of his own, with the secret help of the political commissar Saint-Just has assigned to him. Admiral White Haven launches Manticore's Operation Buttercup. Under his command, 8th Fleet begins a lightning offensive deep into Havenite territory. The new technology developed by Manticore in the prelude to Buttercup allows the fleet to quickly demolish all Havenite resistance, and in a matter of months Manticore becomes poised to invade the Haven system itself. In desperation, Saint-Just attempts to assassinate the Manticoran Alliance leadership. Masadan terrorists in Saint- Just's service succeed in killing the Manticoran Prime Minister, The Duke of Cromarty, along with several major figures of the Manticoran and Grayson governments, despite the efforts of Honor Harrington. Honor's actions save Queen Elizabeth and the Protector of Grayson Benjamin Mayhew IX from dying in the same attack. On Manticore, Cromarty's death opens an opportunity for former Opposition factions led by Baron High Ridge to seize political control, much to the frustration of Queen Elizabeth. Saint-Just proposes an immediate cease-fire between Manticore and Haven. This is hastily accepted by the new High Ridge government, despite the fact that 8th fleet is poised to invade Haven and force an unconditional surrender. High Ridge and his co-partisans in the military come to believe (wrongly) that Haven has been defeated for good, and that further violence is not necessary. The new Manticoran government institutes programs and policy that will begin a legacy of political greed, selfishness, incompetence, and cronyism that will have far reaching consequences for the entire Star Kingdom. Now secure from the possibility of a Manticoran attack on the Haven System itself, Saint-Just turns to internal matters and the consolidation of his grip on power. He orders the arrest of Admirals Lester Tourville and Javier Giscard, whom he sees as political dissidents. Theisman launches his coup, the Havenite military wrests control of the government, and Theisman personally executes Saint-Just.

It was first published in 2002. Plot summary Five years have passed since a truce was reached between Manticore and Haven, but there is still no formal peace treaty. Even though neither side wishes to resume fighting, political circumstances in both nations threaten to plunge them into war. On Manticore, the administration of Prime Minister High Ridge focuses on strengthening its political position. They are determined to remain at least technically at war with Haven - peace would terminate the special war taxes they are diverting from the Royal Manticoran Navy's budget for their welfare programs and vote-buying schemes, and would end their ability to postpone elections in which they expect to lose their fragile majority. Manticore's allies, most notably Grayson and Erewhon, are infuriated with the new government's carelessness and outright rudeness in foreign affairs. From their seats in the House of Lords, Honor Harrington and Hamish Alexander voice their opposition to the High Ridge Administration's policies, and the government takes actions to discredit the war heroes. Haven struggles to rebuild after the fall of the People's Republic. President Pritchart's administration faces increasing pressure from certain political factions that demand the Republic to be more assertive in its negotiations with the Star Kingdom. Admiral Thomas Theisman has to restore the Havenite Navy's morale and fighting capabilities after the long war with Manticore and a protracted campaign to conquer the remnants of the old People's Republic. The Andermani Empire, at the encouragement of the Republic's secretary of state, has adopted a confrontational stance with Manticore over the chaos- ridden Silesian Confederacy, and Honor Harrington is sent to the planet Sidemore, located near Silesian space, with a task force. She is ordered to go to Silesia at the behest of the Royal Navy's new management, who wishes to get her out of the political arena. The intention is to keep a close eye on the Andermani and their activities, and the risk of war between Manticore and the Empire is steadily rising. Tensions also rise between Haven and Manticore. A new terminus of the Manticore Wormhole Junction has been discovered, and several worlds located near the new terminus request annexation into Manticore, triggering fears amongst the Havenites that Manticore is going to go on an expansionist rampage. The Manticoran government's ineptness and the schemes of some members of the Havenite government compounds an already unstable scenario, and President Pritchart orders the Havenite Navy to launch \\"Operation Thunderbolt\\": the resumption of combat operations against Manticore. War breaks out again. In a series of coordinated attacks the Havenites succeed in conquering every system the Manticorans took out from them (except San Martin, which is recognized as a part of the Star Kingdom) and in devastating a critical Manticoran shipyard. Even Honor's fleet is attacked, despite the long distance between Haven and Sidemore, but, reinforced by the Protector's Own division of the Grayson Navy, she succeeds in defeating the Havenite forces. Baron High Ridge attempts to spread the blame around by forming a coalition government, but the Queen refuses the \\"request\\" of the Baron to convene a government. Because of this, High Ridge and all members of his government are left solely responsible for the criminally negligent handling of the military and the peace talks. The High Ridge administration falls in disgrace, and a new government takes over in the Star Kingdom, composed of the remnants of the earlier Cromarty government with Hamish Alexander's brother William as Prime Minister. Now Haven is almost the technological equal of Manticore and its fleet of modern warships is significantly larger than the Manticoran navy. Erewhon has broken out of the Manticoran Alliance and has sided with Haven, handing them many of the latest technological developments of the Star Kingdom. The Havenites have the initiative and the Star Kingdom is shocked. However, the Andermani Empire joins the Manticoran side in the new war.

His more than 40 years of active duty included service in the War of 1812. Biography Wadsworth was born in 1790 at Portland, Maine. He was appointed a midshipman on 2 April 1804 and was promoted to lieutenant on 21 April 1810. Lt. Wadsworth was the first lieutenant on board Constitution during that famous frigate's successful engagement with Guerriere in the War of 1812. For this action, he received a silver medal and was included in the vote of thanks received by the commanding officer, Isaac Hull, and his officers. Wadsworth later served as first lieutenant of the corvette Adams during that ship's cruise in 1814 when she captured 10 prizes. Promoted to Master Commandant on 27 April 1816 for his services during the war, Wadsworth commanded the brig Prometheus in the Mediterranean Squadron after the Second Barbary War in 1816 and 1817 and later commanded the sloop John Adams. Under Wadsworth, John Adams conducted cruises in the West Indies in 1818-1819, and 1821-1822 for the suppression of piracy. Promoted to captain on 3 March 1825, he commanded frigate Constellation in the Mediterranean Squadron from 1829 to 1832. Wadsworth was Commodore commanding the Pacific Squadron from 1834 to 1836, a member of the Board of Navy Commissioners from 1837 to 1840, and Inspector of Ordnance from 1841 to 1850. Commodore Wadsworth died at Washington, D.C., on 5 April 1851. He was the son of Peleg Wadsworth, the uncle of author Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and namesake of Alexander Scammel.

His first bands include No Damn Fears, Oreo Reversed, and Blackpool from Halifax, Nova Scotia. Currently, Scott is a drummer with the Toronto-based band Sloan. Scott also plays guitar and occasionally sings lead vocals with the band, usually on songs he has written. Three of his songs, \\"500 Up\\", \\"People of the Sky\\", and \\"I've Gotta Try\\" have been released by Sloan as singles. Scott is married to actress and writer Fiona Highet. They have two children—a daughter, Stirling, and a son, Alistair. Once the holder of several provincial track and field records, Scott abandoned his athletic aspirations to become a visual artist. After attending the Nova Scotia College of Art & Design University, he joined Chris Murphy, Jay Ferguson, and Patrick Pentland in Sloan. Equipment  Scott has had many drum kits over the years, but he almost always plays a four-piece Ludwig 1960s-era drum set with vintage Zildjian cymbals, Remo drumheads and Promark drumsticks. His drum stands appear to almost always be Yamaha single-braced stands. His bass drum pedal is unknown. Below are a list of Scott's most notable drum set-ups, though other sets have been seen in recording photos throughout the years. Kit #1 - Used 1994-1999(ish): Late 1950s-early 1960s Leedy Gold Sparkle four-piece set with the original owner's \\"Andy Sabola\\" logo drumhead. Drum configuration: 22x14 bass, 13x9 rack tom, 16x16 floor tom, and a matching 14x5 snare drum. This set appears on all of Sloan's music videos, starting with \\"Coax Me\\" in 1994, all the way to \\"Losing California\\" in 1999. It was also Scott's primary kit used live when not using rentals or the opening band's kit. Kit #2 - Used 1999 to mid-2000s: Early to mid-1960s Ludwig Blue Sparkle four-piece set. Scott is shown with the matching blue sparkle snare drum in the \\"If It Feels Good Do It\\" music video, but in most live appearances is seen still using his Leedy gold sparkle snare drum. Kit #3 - 1970s Ludwig five-piece Blue Vistalite. As seen in \\"The Other Man\\" music video, Scott is shown playing a set with 22x14, 13x9, 16x16 and an additional second floor tom. 18x16 would have been standard in the 1970s, but it could possibly be a 14x14. This set also has a matching 14x5 snare drum. Fans also see Scott with a third crash cymbal for the first time. Again, exact cymbals are unknown, but still appear to be vintage Zildjians. On tour, Scott again used his 14x5 Leedy snare drum. Kit #4 - 2011–Present: Early to mid-1960s Sky Blue Pearl Ludwig three-piece set with the standard configuration of 22x14, 13x9, 16x16 with a 14x5 Ludwig L400 Aluminum Supraphonic snare drum (with a backup one on hand in case of a broken drumhead). 2016 One Chord to Another 20th anniversary tour: Scott plays a hybrid set of all his past drum sets—his 13x9 Vistalite rack tom, 16x16 Leedy floor tom, 22x14 sky blue pearl bass drum again with a Supraphonic snare drum. Guitar: Scott has an orange double-cutaway Gretsch hollow-body electric guitar that he uses both on stage and in studio.

It is the first case of a Lie group that is both a compact group and a non-abelian group. The first condition implies the representation theory is discrete: representations are direct sums of a collection of basic irreducible representations (governed by the Peter–Weyl theorem). The second means that there will be irreducible representations in dimensions greater than 1. SU(2) is the universal covering group of SO(3), and so its representation theory includes that of the latter, by dint of a surjective homomorphism to it. This underlies the significance of SU(2) for the description of non-relativistic spin in theoretical physics; see below for other physical and historical context. As shown below, the finite-dimensional irreducible representations of SU(2) are indexed by a non-negative integer m and have dimension m+1. In the physics literature, the representations are labeled by the quantity l=m/2, where l is then either an integer or a half- integer, and the dimension is 2l+1. Lie algebra representations The representations of the group are found by considering representations of su(2), the Lie algebra of SU(2). Since the group SU(2) is simply connected, every representation of its Lie algebra can be integrated to a group representation; Theorem 5.6 we will give an explicit construction of the representations at the group level below. A reference for this material is Section 4.6 of . =Real and complexified Lie algebras= The real Lie algebra su(2) has a basis given by : u_1 = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & i\\\\\\\\\\\\ i & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\qquad u_2 = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\qquad u_3 = \\\\begin{bmatrix} i & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & -i \\\\end{bmatrix} ~, (Note that these basis matrices are times the Pauli matrices.) The matrices are a representation of the quaternions: : u_1\\\\,u_1 = -I\\\\,; ~~\\\\quad u_2\\\\,u_2 = -I \\\\,; ~~\\\\quad u_3\\\\,u_3 = -I\\\\,; : u_1\\\\,u_2 = +u_3\\\\,; \\\\quad u_2\\\\,u_3 = +u_1\\\\,; \\\\quad u_3\\\\,u_1 = +u_2\\\\,; : u_2\\\\,u_1 = -u_3\\\\,; \\\\quad u_3\\\\,u_2 = -u_1\\\\,; \\\\quad u_1\\\\,u_3 = -u_2\\\\,. where is the conventional 2×2 identity matrix:~~I = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\,. Consequently, the matrices commutator brackets satisfy :[u_1,u_2] = 2 u_3\\\\,; \\\\quad [u_2,u_3] = 2 u_1\\\\,; \\\\quad [u_3,u_1] = 2 u_2\\\\,. It is then convenient to pass to the complexified Lie algebra :\\\\mathrm{su}(2) + i\\\\,\\\\mathrm{su}(2) = \\\\mathrm{sl}(2;\\\\mathbb C). (Skew self-adjoint matrices with trace zero plus self-adjoint matrices with trace zero gives all matrices with trace zero.) As long as we are working with representations over \\\\mathbb C this passage from real to complexified Lie algebra is harmless. Section 3.6 The reason for passing to the complexification is that it allows us to construct a nice basis of a type that does not exist in the real Lie algebra su(2). The complexified Lie algebra is spanned by three elements X, Y, and H, given by :H=\\\\frac{1}{i}u_3;\\\\quad X=\\\\frac{1}{2i}(u_1-iu_2);\\\\quad Y=\\\\frac{1}{2i}(u_1+iu_2), or, explicitly, : H = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & -1 \\\\end{bmatrix};\\\\quad X = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix}; \\\\quad Y = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} ~. These satisfy the commutation relations :[H,X]=2X,\\\\quad [H,Y]=-2Y,\\\\quad [X,Y]=H. Up to a factor of 2, the elements H, X and Y may be identified with the angular momentum operators J_z, J_+, and J_-, respectively. The factor of 2 is a discrepancy between conventions in math and physics; we will attempt to mention both conventions in the results that follow. =Weights and the structure of the representation= In this setting, the eigenvalues for H are referred to as the weights of the representation. The following elementary result Lemma 4.33 is a key step in the analysis. Suppose that v is an eigenvector for H with eigenvalue \\\\alpha, that is, that H\\\\cdot v=\\\\alpha v. Then : \\\\begin{align} H\\\\cdot (X\\\\cdot v) & =(\\\\alpha +2) X\\\\cdot v\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[3pt] H\\\\cdot (Y\\\\cdot v) & =(\\\\alpha -2) Y\\\\cdot v \\\\end{align} In other words, X\\\\cdot v is either the zero vector or an eigenvector for H with eigenvalue \\\\alpha+2 and Y\\\\cdot v is either zero or an eigenvector for H with eigenvalue \\\\alpha -2. Thus, the operator X acts as a raising operator, increasing the weight by 2, while Y acts as a lowering operator. Suppose now that V is an irreducible, finite-dimensional representation of the complexified Lie algebra. Then H can have only finitely many eigenvalues. In particular, there must be an eigenvalue \\\\lambda\\\\in\\\\mathbb C with the property that \\\\lambda+2 is not an eigenvalue. Let v_0 be an eigenvector for H with eigenvalue \\\\lambda: :H\\\\cdot v_0=\\\\lambda v_0. Then we must have :X\\\\cdot v_0=0, or else the above identity would tell us that X\\\\cdot v_0 is an eigenvector with eigenvalue \\\\lambda+2. Now define a \\"chain\\" of vectors v_0,v_1,\\\\ldots by :v_k=Y^k\\\\cdot v_0. A simple argument by induction Equation (4.15) then shows that :X\\\\cdot v_k=k(\\\\lambda-(k-1))v_{k-1} for all k=1,2,\\\\ldots. Now, if v_k is not the zero vector, it is an eigenvector for H with eigenvalue \\\\lambda-2k. Since, again, H has only finitely many eigenvectors, we conclude that v_l must be zero for some l (and then v_k=0 for all k>l). Let v_m be the last nonzero vector in the chain; that is, v_m eq 0 but v_{m+1}=0. Then of course X\\\\cdot v_{m+1}=0 and by the above identity with k=m+1, we have :0=X\\\\cdot v_{m+1}=(m+1)(\\\\lambda-m)v_m. Since m+1 is at least one and v_m eq 0, we conclude that \\\\lambda must be equal to the non-negative integer m. We thus obtain a chain of m+1 vectors v_0,\\\\ldots, v_m such that Y acts as :Y\\\\cdot v_m=0;\\\\quad Y\\\\cdot v_k=v_{k+1}\\\\quad(k and X acts as :X\\\\cdot v_0=0,\\\\quad X\\\\cdot v_k=k(m-(k-1))v_{k-1}\\\\quad(k>0) and H acts as :H\\\\cdot v_k=(m-2k)v_k. (We have replaced \\\\lambda with its currently known value of m in the above formulas.) Since the vectors v_k are eigenvectors for H with distinct eigenvalues, they must be linearly independent. Furthermore, the span of v_0,\\\\ldots ,v_m is clearly invariant under the action of the complexified Lie algebra. Since V is assumed irreducible, this span must be all of V. We thus obtain a complete description of what an irreducible representation must look like; that is, a basis for the space and a complete description of how the generators of the Lie algebra act. Conversely, for any m\\\\geq 0 we can construct a representation by simply using the above formulas and checking that the commutation relations hold. This representation can then be shown to be irreducible. proof of Proposition 4.11 Conclusion: For each non-negative integer m, there is a unique irreducible representation with highest weight m. Each irreducible representation is equivalent to one of these. The representation with highest weight m has dimension m+1 with weights m,m-2,\\\\ldots,-(m-2),-m, each having multiplicity one. =The Casimir element= We now introduce the (quadratic) Casimir element, C given by :C=-(u_1^2+u_2^2+u_3^2). We can view C as an element of the universal enveloping algebra or as an operator in each irreducible representation. Viewing C as an operator on the representation with highest weight m, we may easily compute that C commutes with each u_i. Thus, by Schur's lemma, C acts as a scalar multiple c_m of the identity for each m. We can write C in terms of the {H,X,Y} basis as follows: :C=(X+Y)^2-(-X+Y)^2+H^2, which simplifies to :C=4YX+H^2+2H. The eigenvalue of C in the representation with highest weight m can be computed by applying C to the highest weight vector, which is annihilated by X. Thus, we get :c_m=m^2+2m=m(m+2). In the physics literature, the Casimir is normalized as C'=C/4. Labeling things in terms of l=m/2, the eigenvalue d_l of C' is then computed as :d_l= \\\\frac{1}{4}(2l)(2l+2)=l(l+1). The group representations =Action on polynomials= Since SU(2) is simply connected, a general result shows that every representation of its (complexified) Lie algebra gives rise to a representation of SU(2) itself. It is desirable, however, to give an explicit realization of the representations at the group level. The group representations can be realized on spaces of polynomials in two complex variables. Section 4.2 That is, for each non-negative integer m, we let V_m denote the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree m in two complex variables. Then the dimension of V_m is m+1. There is a natural action of SU(2) on each V_m, given by :[U\\\\cdot p](z)=p(U^{-1}z),\\\\quad z\\\\in\\\\mathbb C^2,\\\\, U\\\\in\\\\mathrm{SU}(2). The associated Lie algebra representation is simply the one described in the previous section. (See here for an explicit formula for the action of the Lie algebra on the space of polynomials.) =The characters= The character of a representation \\\\Pi:G\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathrm{GL}(V) is the function \\\\Chi:G\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathbb C given by :\\\\Chi(g)=\\\\mathrm{trace}(\\\\Pi(g)). Characters plays an important role in the representation theory of compact groups. The character is easily seen to be a class function, that is, invariant under conjugation. In the SU(2) case, the fact that the character is a class function means it is determined by its value on the maximal torus T consisting of the diagonal matrices in SU(2). Since the irreducible representation with highest weight m has weights m,m-2,\\\\ldots -(m-2),-m, it is easy to see that the associated character satisfies :\\\\Chi\\\\left(\\\\begin{pmatrix} e^{i\\\\theta} & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & e^{-i\\\\theta} \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\right)=e^{im\\\\theta}+e^{i(m-2)\\\\theta}+\\\\cdots e^{-i(m-2)\\\\theta}+e^{-im\\\\theta}. This expression is a finite geometric series that can be simplified to :\\\\Chi\\\\left(\\\\begin{pmatrix} e^{i\\\\theta} & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & e^{-i\\\\theta} \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\right)=\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{sin}((m+1)\\\\theta)}{\\\\mathrm{sin}(\\\\theta)}. This last expression is just the statement of the Weyl character formula for the SU(2) case. Example 12.23 Actually, following Weyl's original analysis of the representation theory of compact groups, one can classify the representations entirely from the group perspective, without using Lie algebra representations at all. In this approach, the Weyl character formula plays an essential part in the classification, along with the Peter–Weyl theorem. The SU(2) case of this story is described here. =Relation to the representations of SO(3)= Note that either all of the weights of the representation are even (if m is even) or all of the weights are odd (if m is odd). In physical terms, this distinction is important: The representations with even weights correspond to ordinary representations of the rotation group SO(3). Section 4.7 By contrast, the representations with odd weights correspond to double- valued (spinorial) representation of SO(3), also known as projective representations. In the physics conventions, m being even corresponds to l being an integer while m being odd corresponds to l being a half-integer. These two cases are described as integer spin and half-integer spin, respectively. The representations with odd, positive values of m are faithful representations of SU(2), while the representations of SU(2) with non- negative, even m are not faithful. Another approach See under the example for Borel–Weil–Bott theorem. Most important irreducible representations and their applications Representations of SU(2) describe non-relativistic spin, due to being a double covering of the rotation group of Euclidean 3-space. Relativistic spin is described by the representation theory of SL2(C), a supergroup of SU(2), which in a similar way covers SO+(1;3), the relativistic version of the rotation group. SU(2) symmetry also supports concepts of isobaric spin and weak isospin, collectively known as isospin. The representation with m=1 (i.e., l=1/2 in the physics convention) is the 2 representation, the fundamental representation of SU(2). When an element of SU(2) is written as a complex matrix, it is simply a multiplication of column 2-vectors. It is known in physics as the spin-½ and, historically, as the multiplication of quaternions (more precisely, multiplication by a unit quaternion). This representation can also be viewed as a double-valued projective representation of the rotation group SO(3). The representation with m=2 (i.e., l=1) is the 3 representation, the adjoint representation. It describes 3-d rotations, the standard representation of SO(3), so real numbers are sufficient for it. Physicists use it for the description of massive spin-1 particles, such as vector mesons, but its importance for spin theory is much higher because it anchors spin states to the geometry of the physical 3-space. This representation emerged simultaneously with the 2 when William Rowan Hamilton introduced versors, his term for elements of SU(2). Note that Hamilton did not use standard group theory terminology since his work preceded Lie group developments. The m=3 (i.e. l=3/2) representation is used in particle physics for certain baryons, such as the Δ.

Discovered by Eugène Delporte at Uccle in 1936, it became a lost asteroid until 1977. It may also be an extinct comet and a source of meteor showers. It was named after Adonis from Greek mythology.  Discovery  Adonis was discovered on 12 February 1936, by Belgian astronomer Eugène Delporte at the Royal Observatory of Belgium in Uccle. After its initial discovery, which happened during a close approach with Earth, the asteroid was observed for two months, before it became a lost asteroid, as not enough observations could be made to calculate a sufficiently accurate orbit. It took 41 years until it was finally rediscovered by the American astronomer Charles Kowal in 1977, based on mathematical predictions made by Dr. Brian Marsden.  Orbit and classification  The near-Earth object orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.4–3.3 AU once every 2 years and 7 months (937 days; semi-major axis of 1.87 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.76 and an inclination of 1° with respect to the ecliptic. Adonis was one of the first near-Earth objects ever to be discovered. It was also the second known Apollo asteroid after 1862 Apollo, the group's namesake discovered four years earlier in 1932. = MOID = It is a potentially hazardous asteroid because its Earth minimum orbit intersection distance of , or 4.5 lunar distances, is less than 0.05 AU and its diameter is greater than 150 meters. It also makes close approaches to Venus and Mars and will come within 30 Gm of the Earth six times during the 21st century, the nearest projected distance being , on 7 February 2036.  Physical characteristics  Adonis has an absolute magnitude of 18.8, and an estimated mean-diameter between 520 and 600 meters. As of 2017, the body's rotation period, composition, spectral type and shape remain unknown.  Naming  This minor planet is named from Greek mythology after the handsome, ever-youthful vegetation god Adonis, with whom the goddess Aphrodite fell in love. Persephone was also taken by Adonis' beauty and refused to give him back to Aphrodite. The dispute between the two goddesses was settled by Zeus: Adonis was to spend one-third of every year with each goddess and the last third wherever he chose. He was killed by a boar sent by Artemis. The minor planets 105 Artemis, 399 Persephone, 1388 Aphrodite and 5731 Zeus were named for these Greek gods. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 1 November 1978 (). Exploration A famous fiction story shows this asteroid too near from the Earth but Adonis was considered as a possible target for a 6 million km distant flyby by the Vega 2 spacecraft after its 1986 flyby of Halley's comet. In the event Vega 2 didn't have enough fuel post Halley encounter to make the necessary orbital changes for the flyby.

International observers also claimed that these elections witnessed serious irregularities. In May 2001, Déby won the presidential election in the first round with 63% of the vote, but the election was considered to be fraudulent, and several opposition leaders were arrested after accusing the Chadian government of election fraud. Because of prominent electoral irregularities in the previous elections in 2001 and 2006, the 2011 presidential election was boycotted by the major opposition parties, which resulted in Déby winning 89% of the vote in the first round. Most recently, Déby was elected to his fifth term in 2016, after abolishing presidential term limits in 2004 by amending the Constitution of Chad. Most recently, Kodi Mahamat Bam, President of the Independent National Electoral Commission announced the postponement of legislative elections to April 2021. The stated reason was related to COIVD19.https://north-africa.com/2020/06/sahel-chad-ruler-deby-delays- national-assembly-election-for-fifth-time-since-2015 Latest elections =Presidential elections= =Parliamentary elections= References External links *Adam Carr's Election Archive *African Elections Database ","title":"Elections in Chad"},{"id":"1378637","text":"Elections in Colombia are regulated and controlled by the National Electoral Council which provides information on elections and election results in for the politics of Colombia.

It is 200 km south by road from the border with Algeria. As of 2011, the commune had a total population of 112,432 people. Uranium industry Founded in 1969 following the discovery of uranium, it has grown around the mining industry, developed by the French government. Two large uranium mines, at Arlit and nearby Akouta, are exploited by open top strip mining. One open pit mine was built in 1971 by the National Mining Company of Niger, SOMAIR.Somair Company Profile. The Second open pit mine, as well as a third underground mine, was built by the French Compagnie Minière d'Akouta (or COMINAK). All the ore from both is now processed and transported by a French company Orano Cycle, a holding of the Orano group, itself a state owned operation of the French Commissariat à l'énergie atomique (CEA).

University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (2000) Orano Cycle alone employs 1600 foreign nationals on the site.according to Le Canard Enchaîné (3 August 2005) In 2017, 2,116 tonnes of uranium were extracted from the Arlit mineshttp://www.world- nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/mining-of-uranium/world- uranium-mining-production.aspx and exported to France via truck to the seaport at Cotonou, Bénin. At its peak in the 1980s, 40% of Niger's uranium production came from Arlit, and uranium represented 90% of Niger's exports (by value). A major modern road, known as the Uranium Highway, has been built to transport uranium south, but it has bypassed many towns along the way (In-Gall for example) and has radically changed Niger's transportation system. =Boom, bust and recovery= In the late 1980s, Arlit suffered from a steep decline in world uranium prices, and the number of foreign employees in the town was cut to 700, a drop which has rebounded by the first decade of the 21st century. The value of Niger's uranium \\"boom\\" has never recovered its 1980s level, causing dislocation and suffering for the tens of thousands of Nigeriens who flocked to the shanty towns surrounding Arlit. Anger at the results of uranium bust, along with a belief that the best jobs were going to those from southern Niger, contributed to the Tuareg Rebellion of the 1990s. As late as 2007, Tuareg nationalists have made a fairer division of profits and jobs for local people a primary demand.[ l'Humanite, ] June 2007. =Environmental impact= The impact on the local environment of the Arlit mining industry has been criticised by African and European Non-Governmental Organisations, and Areva NC has especially been accused of a disregard for health and environmental conditions around its operations.Le dossier sur la mine d'Arlit de la CRIIRAD =\\"Yellowcake\\" controversy= In the build-up to the war in Iraq there was controversy over allegations in 2003 that Saddam Hussein was seeking to purchase uranium from Arlit.

It is the terminus of the Abbey Line from Watford Junction, operated by London Northwestern Railway. It is one of two stations in St Albans, the other being the much larger and busier St Albans City. The unstaffed station consists of a single open-air platform and a car park. Improvement works were carried out in 2008. It was the second UK railway station to receive a Harrington Hump to improve accessibility. History A 1902 Railway Clearing House map of railways in the vicinity of St Albans Abbey (lower left, shown here as L.&N.W.;) St Albans Abbey station in June 1977 St Albans Abbey was the first railway station in St Albans, built by the London and North Western Railway in 1858. It was, as it is now, a terminus; the company's plans to extend northwards to Luton and Dunstable never materialised. Although the Midland Railway opened their station (St Albans City) in 1868, it was not until 1924 that \\"Abbey\\" was added to the station's title to avoid confusion - by this stage, both stations were owned by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. Until November 2007 responsibility for the branch line was with Silverlink. Restoration of the passing loop at Bricket Wood was being considered by the local authorities and Network Rail but was turned down in early 2008; this would have facilitated trains running every 30 minutes. = Branch to Hatfield = In 1865, the Great Northern Railway supported a group of local landowners to open a branch line from Hatfield to St Albans Abbey with an intermediate stop at St Albans London Road, and later at (1866), (1901), (1899), (1910) and (1942). This line closed to passengers in 1951. Goods services were withdrawn from the end of 1968 and the track was lifted. In the mid-1980s, the route was opened as a cycle path, now the Alban Way. The remains of the branch can be seen to the left of the single platform when looking down the line in the direction of Watford Junction, including overgrown remnants of the second platform which would have served the branch.

L. Pendergast, a secretive and highly resourceful FBI Special Agent, convinces her to help him uncover the truth behind a string of brutal murders that appears to stretch back 130 years.THE CABINET OF CURIOSITIES The adventure starts out with the discovery of a long-buried tunnel at a construction site in Manhattan containing the bodies of 36 young people all with parts of their spines removed, buried in the basement. Kelly's assistance as archaeologist is needed by Pendergast. But they are soon frustrated by forces opposing their involvement: first, Roger C. Brisbane III, Museum's first Vice Director; then by Anthony Fairhaven, a wealthy entrepreneur and owner of the development property. Fairhaven is a large contributor to the museum, and to the mayor's election campaign. Finally, the mayor and the police exert every effort to stop Pendergast and Kelly's investigation. Anthony Fairhaven, owner of the site, wishes to build his glass tower of apartments before bad publicity and archaeologists can stop him. He has the bodies quickly taken away and buried, but not before Dr. Nora Kelly and FBI Special Agent Pendegrast take a cursory look. Nora discovers a note written by Mary Greene sewn into the bodice of a discarded dress. Nora has her reservations about continuing the investigation, despite the personal connection she feels to Mary Greene through her painstakingly-written note. Nora has recently been hired by the museum, and is afraid of losing her job, especially since budget cuts and politics make it harder for her to continue her research. In spite of efforts to thwart them, Pendergast and Kelly make some important discoveries at the construction site, especially the gruesome manner in which the victims were killed. Agent Pendergast is determined to discover the name of the murderer for his own reasons. Nora's boyfriend, William Smithback, tries to help Kelly in his way, writing a newspaper article about the investigation. Contrary to Smithback's hopes, his article does not help Nora, and she refuses to have anything further to do with him. After the article is published, a copycat killer begins a new stream of murders. The Police Department, in spite of its desire to curtail Pendergast's activities, must appear as though it's aiding the investigation, and so supplies a liaison officer, Patrick Murphy O'Shaughnessy. To the department's chagrin, O'Shaughnessy is much too helpful and becomes a boon to Pendergast and Kelly. The copycat murders continue, moving ever closer to the museum. A horrific murder is discovered in the museum's basement, and with each clue Pendergast uncovers, he has the sensation that someone is following his trail. Strangely, the evidence points towards the same person who committed the gruesome crimes over a century ago. Pendergast's great-grand uncle Antoine Leng Pendergast (a.k.a. Enoch Leng) is revealed as the serial killer who stole his victim's spinal columns in an attempt to produce an elixir enabling him to prolong life. He succeeded, and survives into the late 20th century, until he himself is killed by the copycat killer, revealed to be Anthony Fairhaven, who tracked Enoch Leng to his mansion on Riverside Drive. Pendergast arrives to rescue Nora and Smithback from Fairhaven's captivity, but takes a severe bullet wound and is disarmed by Fairhaven. Fairhaven has been searching the mansion for the formula, and is excited when Pendergast, trying to escape, finds the entrance to a secret laboratory, where he is puzzled to see a collection of toxic plants and insects, along with an esoteric collection of costumes and antique weaponry. On a whim, Fairhaven decides to use an axe from the collection, instead of Pendergast's gun, to execute Pendergast. A few moments later, when Nora rushes into the room, she sees Pendergast alive and Fairhaven on the floor, writhing in agony. Pendergast explains that his uncle Antoine/Enoch developed his formula for life extension only as a means to an end, to give himself enough time to complete his real work: perfecting a means of committing global genocide. In Leng's mind, the best way to save humanity would be to exterminate it, so he was experimenting with a variety of deadly poisons and delivery systems. By handling the objects in the room, Fairhaven inadvertently absorbed a varied \\"cocktail\\" of these poisons, and is dying, slowly and gruesomely. Later, at the grave of one of the murdered girls, Pendergast explains the rest of the mystery to Nora and Smithback. As a young man, Fairhaven became obsessed with his own mortality after witnessing his elder brother's premature death from progeria. He used his real estate fortune to make generous donations to biomedical research, and came across mention of Leng in some of the Museum's old records. Leng was still alive when Fairhaven tracked him down, though he was now an old man and had stopped using the formula (Pendergast reveals that Leng abandoned his project in 1954, after the Castle Bravo thermonuclear bomb was successfully test-detonated, deciding that mankind had already perfected a means of destroying itself). Leng was powerless against Fairhaven's feverish brutality, and died under torture by Fairhaven, but never revealed his secret formula - which Pendergast found in a hiding place in Leng's laboratory. To Smithback's shock, and Nora's approval, Pendergast destroys the formula, having already decided that it is more of a threat to humanity than a blessing. He remarks on the irony that Leng had already discovered the secret to destroying humanity, but didn't realize it: all he had to do was reveal the existence of the formula, and the world would have torn itself apart trying to possess it. The story introduces the cabinet of curiosity (created by the killer Leng), and hints at something hidden in it, which is featured in the consecutive novels.  Background  The character of Nora Kelly first appeared in Child and Preston's thriller novel Thunderhead (1998). Kelly was modeled on Lincoln Child's grandmother Nora Benjamin Kubie, an amateur archaeologist and writer.

RTÉ News. 9 February 1999. Retrieved 9 March 2011. is a small Ulster loyalist paramilitary group in Northern Ireland. It was formed in 1998 by loyalists who opposed the Belfast Agreement and the loyalist ceasefires. Over the following year it carried out a wave of bomb and gun attacks on Catholics and Catholic-owned properties in rural areas, but since 2000 has been relatively inactive. The group has been associated with elements of the Orange Order and has a Protestant fundamentalist ideology. Its original leader was Pastor Clifford Peeples. The OV are a Proscribed Organisation in the United Kingdom under the Terrorism Act 2000. Origins The OV emerged during the 1998 Drumcree conflict when the Royal Ulster Constabulary and British Army prevented members of the Portadown Orange Order and their supporters from returning to the town centre down the Garvaghy road. However, there is evidence to suggest that they had been actively recruiting and training members since as early as 1985.Northern Ireland - The Troubles by Charles Messenger (), p. 141. The group is believed to be made up of dissident loyalists who disapprove of the Northern Ireland peace process and also of the more militant members of the Orange Order, including former members of the Loyalist Volunteer Force and Ulster Defence Association. David Ervine, at the time a leading member of the Progressive Unionist Party, described the group as little more than a gang of Protestant fundamentalists and drug-dealers. Activities In 1998 and 1999, the Orange Volunteers were led by Clifford Peeples, a Protestant pastor from Belfast. One of the group's first actions was a synchronized attack on 11 Catholic churches. Peeples defended the attack on the grounds that the churches were \\"bastions of the Antichrist\\".Bruce, Steve. Religion and violence: the case of Paisley and Ulster evangelicals. On 27 November 1998, eight masked OV members brandishing guns and grenades staged a \\"show of strength\\" for a local journalist. The gunmen began the meeting with a Bible reading and ended it with prayers. They produced a \\"covenant\\" that said: \\"We are defenders of the reformed faith. Our members are practising Protestant worshippers\\". They went on to state: \\"We are prepared to defend our people and if it comes to the crunch we will assassinate the enemies of Ulster. Ordinary Catholics have nothing to fear from us. But the true enemies will be targeted, and that's a lot wider than just Sinn Féin and the IRA\\". They vowed to target IRA prisoners released as part of the Belfast Agreement and claimed responsibility for a string of attacks on Irish nationalist-owned businesses a month beforehand.

Released in 1971 by Epic Records, it featured more of a jazz, soul and R&B; edge to counter Beck's lead guitar. As a songwriter, Beck contributed more pieces to Rough and Ready than he had before, or ever would again. Beck enlisted Bobby Tench as vocalist and it is also the first time keyboardist Max Middleton is heard. Other members of this line up are drummer Cozy Powell and bassist Clive Chaman. History In early April and still signed to RAK, Jeff Beck reformed The Jeff Beck Group with keyboardist Max Middleton, drummer Cozy Powell and bassist Clive Chaman and vocalist Alex Ligertwood. Later in April that year the new band began recording sessions at Island Studios, London. They worked on songs by Beck and focused on \\"Situation\\", which had lyrics by Ligertwood. Other songs such as \\"Morning Dew\\" were given attention, with the help of producer Jimmy Miller, who had worked with Traffic and with The Rolling Stones. During May 1971, after a week of recording sessions, Beck left RAK and signed a new record deal with CBS. Epic, a subsidiary of CBS, was assigned to release Beck's work, and having heard the Island studio tapes were not happy with the vocals. During May, Beck started looking for a new vocalist. In late May, after hearing Bobby Tench perform with his band Gass, he employed him as vocalist for the band. Tench was given only a few weeks to write new lyrics and add his vocals to the album, before mixing resumed on tracks previously recorded by Beck and the other band members. During early July 1971 the band returned to Island Studios to finish the album and Beck took over as producer. Rough and Ready was released in UK on 25 October 1971 with the US release following during February 1972, a sixteen-day promotional tour in USA followed and the album eventually reached #46 in the album charts. Critical reception In a contemporary review for The Village Voice, music critic Robert Christgau found Tench's singing pretentious and the songs tedious: \\"Despite some superb textures, this is as sloppy and self-indulgent as ever.\\" Roy Carr, writing in NME, felt that the album \\"falls into that trap whereby the performance far exceeds the material. Beck hasn't lost any of his fire as he rips off solo after solo with flashy confidence\\". On the other hand, Rolling Stone magazine's Stephen Davis said that Rough and Ready is \\"a surprisingly, fine piece of work from a man who wasn't really expected to come back.

The Chess, along with the Colne and Gade, gives rise to the name of the district of Three Rivers, where it forms its confluence with the Colne at Rickmansworth.  Etymology  The name arose by back- formation from the town of Chesham. It was once known as the Pittlesburne which incorporates the old word burna, used in the Chilterns to describe a clear spring-fed stream on a lower dip-slope, often with a stony bed. Examples are the rivers Misbourne and Bulbourn.The Landscape of Place-Names by Gelling & Cole  River course  Looking upstream, at Chenies The River Chess fall is , and its length is . It is fed by groundwater held in the chalk aquifer of the Chiltern Hills and rises from three springs which surface as Vale brook, from Bury Pond, and alongside the Missenden Road near Pednor just to the north of Chesham.River Chess Association, Accessed 14 May 2014History on line - Chesham, Accessed 14 May 2014 It flows within culverts beneath the town before flowing in a southeasterly direction through Waterside. The river flows below parkland landscaped by Capability Brown at Latimer House and the site of a 1st Century Roman villa close to the village of Latimer; to the north of Chenies; through unimproved water meadows at Frogmore and the watercress beds at Sarratt Bottom to the west of Sarratt. The Chess flows under the M25 motorway at Solesbridge Lane, before passing through the private housing estate of Loudwater, whose name was historically associated with the river at this point. Below this the river passes several disused water mills which supplied power and water for paper manufacture during the 18th and 19th Centuries. At Rickmansworth it joins the River Colne to the east of the town. The river banks are mostly not public rights of way, and only small stretches of the river are accessible. It is navigable only in its lower reaches.Chess Valley Walk Chiltern Hills AONB, Accessed 15 September 2012  Drought  River Chess, under drought conditions, at Waterside, Chesham The river suffered from a severe lack of water for approximately two years between 2004 and 2006 and again in 2011 and 2012. Well below average rainfall over long periods was a contributory factor. Winter rainfall is particularly important for replenishing ground water. However, the exceptional rainfall in April and June 2012 allowed the ground water to slowly rise at a time of the year when ground water levels usually start to fall. Consequently, levels in the river Chess were showing signs of improvement by July 2012. Local speculation during the river drought of 2005 was that over-extraction for bottling, by Nestlé's Powwow Water was a significant contributing factor. Indeed after extraction had stopped, and the river recovered somewhat, the bed was now so overgrown it was a struggle for the river to fully recover until much of the growth was removed by volunteers in 2012. In 2005 Councillor Justine Fulford campaigned to prevent the extension of the licence on the grounds that it was damaging to the local environment.  Wildlife  The Chess Valley is partly within the Chiltern Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), with wildlife characteristic of chalk streams and chiltern hills. It supports several key species listed in the Government's UK Biodiversity Action Plan. Mammals such as the water vole, birds including the green sandpiper, grey heron, grey wagtail, little egret, osprey, mute swan, stonechat, water rail and kingfisher, flora such as water crowfoot, purple loosestrife, hemp agrimony, water forget-me not and branched bur-reed. Freshwater fish, found include specifically the brown trout, grayling and bullhead. To support the fish population there is a rich diversity of both invertebrates and of insects, including the mayfly.  Human influences  The valley has a long history of human habitation. There are a number of Roman villa sites along the valley, including Latimer Park. At Sarratt strip lynchets can be seen in terraces along the hillside made by the action of ploughing along the slope and thought to have been the site of medieval vineyards. Human habitation has altered the valley and the river in many ways, not all of them beneficial for wildlife. River modifications such as dredging and widening slow the current, allow silt to accumulate and smother the gravel riverbed. Changes in the land use adjacent to the river can also have impact. Water meadows have been replaced by arable fields and building developments, altering drainage patterns and causing pollution. Abstraction of water from the underlying chalk aquifer reduces river flows and lowers the river's ability to tolerate drought. The introduction of alien species to the catchment has had a major effect on the wildlife of the river. Water vole populations declined catastrophically along the Chess between 2001 & 2003 with a 97% population decrease being observed. This population crash was caused mainly by the North American mink, a species introduced to the British Isles originally for the fur trade. In 2004 a water vole recovery project was set up by the Chilterns Chalk Streams Project and the Environment Agency, combining mink control with habitat improvement to try to halt this decline. In 2005 a survey found that the water vole population had recovered to 18% of its 2001 levels. A less positive story is that of the native white-clawed crayfish, which has suffered at the hands of another American import, the signal crayfish. Originally imported by the aquaculture industry, the signal crayfish was seen as a way for trout farms to diversify and exploit new markets. However, due to their expert, escapologist nature, signal crayfish soon escaped into surrounding river systems and quickly spread throughout the majority of the UK's southern river system. Signal crayfish have carried crayfish plague, to which they are resistant, but the native white-clawed crayfish is not. The result has been the gradual eradication of native crayfish from the UK's rivers. In the case of the Chess, white-clawed crayfish have been extinct since the mid-1990s. The Chess is also home to a number of invasive alien plant species including Japanese knotweed, Himalayan balsam and Orange balsam. Not all imports have quite such a catastrophic effect. Another escapee into the Chess from fish farms and trout fisheries is the rainbow trout, thought to have been introduced to the Chess in the early 20th century. They have since gone on to establish one of a handful of self- sustaining populations in the UK. Some of the flow of the Chess results from the outflow of treated sewage from Chesham Sewage Treatment Works, which is material during dry conditions. During heavy rainfall, overflow at the works results in untreated sewage being released to the river. In 2014, a release persisting 5 months occurred, with substantial effects on river quality. Upgrade works to address the increased flow into the works have subsequently been completed.  Chess cress  Sarratt Historically, the clear chalk stream water of the River Chess, together with the fertile land, was ideal for growing watercress, and this industry which flourished in both Chesham and Rickmansworth in the Victorian era supplied London, being transported on the newly constructed Metropolitan Railway. Today the only working watercress beds are at Moor Lane, Sarratt. In 2014, persistent overflows from Chesham Sewage Treatment Works forced the watercress farm to cease sales,https://www.chenies.org/this-month-in-chenies and to continue operation the farm now uses well water.  Chess Valley Walk  The Chess Valley Walk is approximately long and links with the Metropolitan line stations of Chesham, Chorleywood and Rickmansworth giving visitors the chance to walk either part or the entire route. The route can be followed in either direction and is clearly waymarked. Most of the route is on public footpaths but there are short sections on roads.

This gives two advantages: ground clearance is increased, particularly beneath the low-slung differential housing of the main axles — and secondly, any hub reduction gearing allows the axle halfshafts to drive the same power but at reduced torque (by using higher shaft speed). This reduces load on the axle crownwheel and differential. The portal gear configuration is also sometimes called a drop gear or drop gearset configuration (which, despite its similarity to the term dropped axle, produces the opposite effect). Description Volkswagen Type 82 Kübelwagen Compared to normal layout, portal axles enable the vehicle to gain a higher ground clearance, as both the axle tube and differential casing are tucked up higher under the vehicle. Due to the gear reduction at the wheel which lessens the torque on all the other drivetrain components, the size of the differential casing can be reduced to gain even more ground clearance. Additionally, all drivetrain elements, in particular the transfer gearbox and driveshafts, can be built lighter. This can be of use in lowering the center of gravity for a given ground clearance. Where a vehicle also requires a reduced top speed, in at least one gear, the gear ratio can be chosen to reduce this. The military Kübelwagen of WWII used a ratio of 1.4:1 to provide a 2.5 mph walking speed in first gear, as well as a useful lift of 50 mm. As they require a heavier and more complex hub assembly, however, these systems can result in an increased unsprung weight and require robust axle-control elements to give predictable handling. In addition, at higher speeds the hub assembly can overheat.Exaxt 4WD 1930 Farmall tractor with rear portal axle They are also used in railways and low floor busesRailway Technology - Portal axle with SAB V60 rubber-sprung wheels and sound absorbersArvinMeritor Reveals New Second Generation Inverted Portal Axle although, in the case of buses, the device is engineered in the opposite way to those fitted to off-road vehicles - the axle is below the center of the wheel. Thus, the inverted portal axle allows the floor of the bus to be lowered, easing access to the bus and increasing the available cabin height. A Land Rover Defender fitted with bolt- on portals Bolt-on Portals (or drop boxes) are a housing with a set of gears which bolts onto the final flange of the axle tube. This approach allows existing vehicles to be converted to portals without modifying the axles (Volvo C303 or Unimog 404).

This is mounted in-line with the halfshaft, so that there is no change in ride height. They are often used for large and heavy vehicles, where the wheel diameter already gives adequate ground clearance. The reduction gearbox allows the halfshafts to turn faster than the wheels, thus requiring less torque for the same power. This permits a smaller and lighter halfshaft and internal drivetrain. Hub gearboxes were an iconic feature of the Alvis FV600 chassis vehicles, such as the Stalwart and Saracen. The FV600 used a version of the DAF H-drive, with a single differential between sides and all wheels on each side linked by an internal driveshaft and bevel gearboxes to the halfshafts. This has no differential axle between wheel stations on each side and so 'wind-up' was a regular problem for these vehicles when driven on roads. If individual wheels were out of phase with their neighbours, possibly caused by cornering or slightly varying tyre diameter, this could place a considerable force on the gearbox, leading to breakages. For this reason, it was regular practice when driving on tarmac to bump the vehicle over a kerb or other object at times, to allow this wind-up to be released. On slippery surfaces like sand or mud there is enough slippage between the tyres & ground to dissipate the tension. They are now found on many large quarrying dump trucks and heavy plant.

The film is loosely based on the story of Martin Cahill, a famous Irish crime boss. Filmed in late 1998 and originally scheduled for a fall 1999 release, the movie was put out overseas first the following year but it never got a proper theatrical release in the United States, where it was released straight to video in January 2003, almost five years after filming began.  Plot  Michael Lynch is one of Dublin's most notorious criminals. He has two wives, sisters Christine and Lisa, as well as many children. When he is not spending time with his family, he is plotting heists with his gang. His actions make him an iconic figure, and he has a rapport with the general public despite being a criminal. During his elaborate heists, he concentrates on the showmanship as much as the crime itself. He pulls off a daring art theft, stealing several priceless paintings from Dublin's best art gallery, giving the authorities the slip. The Gardaí become more determined to catch him as time goes on, in particular Noel Quigley, an officer whose ambition to catch Lynch becomes an obsession. His actions also gain the ire of the IRA. Lynch finds himself in trouble when he is unable to sell a stolen Caravaggio painting, The Taking of Christ, giving Quigley the opportunity he was waiting for to try and catch him. Lynch is forced to go on the run, with his popularity with the public at stake.

Having previously worked on Nothing Personal about loyalist paramilitaries, and a biopic about John Gotti for NBC, O'Sullivan did not want to again work under the factual and legal constraints of a film based on real people, and was more interested in making a comedy or caper, and instead they developed their own story only loosely based on Martin Cahill. The original project went back on the market and John Boorman came on board as director. O'Sullivan was worried that investors might think the two projects were too similar, but after Boorman's The General screened at Cannes people saw the films were very different and were willing to invest. O'Sullivan would have cast more Irish actors except for Boorman's film, and said \\"If his part had not been so prominent in The General, I would have had Seán McGinley in my film. I'd have him in every film.\\" He felt it was necessary to cast recognizable named stars to stand the best chance of recouping the film's $10 million budget, and was ultimately pleased with what he described as a \\"dream cast\\". Having seen Colin Farrell in a play at London's Donmar Warehouse Theatre, Spacey invited him to appear in one of his films, and convinced director O'Sullivan to cast him.  Reception  The film received negative reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 14% based on reviews from 7 critics.. Christopher Null writing for Filmcritic.com gave it 1.5 out of 5 wrote: \\"I can only imagine one thing worse than Kevin Spacey trying on an Irish accent, and that's sultry Linda Fiorentino doing the same thing.\\" Though critical of the accents, he says the biggest problem is the dull and less than ordinary script. Derek Elley of Variety magazine called it \\"an ordinary, decent movie. Neither an embarrassment nor a triumph, tedious nor gripping\\". Elley praised the cast but compared it unfavorable with John Boorman's 1998 film The General.

Boarding actions and hand-to-hand fighting determined the outcome of most naval battles in the Middle Ages. A dromon (from Greek δρόμων, dromōn, \\"runner\\") was a type of galley and the most important warship of the Byzantine navy from the 5th to 12th centuries AD, when they were succeeded by Italian-style galleys. It was developed from the ancient liburnian, which was the mainstay of the Roman navy during the Empire. Middle English dromond and Old French dromont are derived from the dromon, and described any particularly large medieval ship.The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, 3rd edition, \\"Dromond\\". Evolution and features Reconstruction (top) in 1:10 scale of a dromon's hull, at the Museum of Ancient Seafaring, Mainz The appearance and evolution of medieval warships is a matter of debate and conjecture: until recently, no remains of an oared warship from either ancient or early medieval times had been found, and information had to be gathered by analyzing literary evidence, crude artistic depictions and the remains of a few merchant vessels (such as the 7th-century Pantano Longarini wreck from Sicily, the 7th-century Yassi Ada ship and the 11th-century Serçe Limanı wreck). Only in 2005–2006 did archaeological digs for the Marmaray project in the location of the Harbor of Theodosius (modern Yenikapi) uncover the remains of over 36 Byzantine ships from the 6th to 10th centuries, including four light galleys of the galea type. The accepted view is that the main developments which differentiated the early dromons from the liburnians, and that henceforth characterized Mediterranean galleys, were the adoption of a full deck (katastrōma), the abandonment of the rams on the bow in favor of an above-water spur, and the gradual introduction of lateen sails. The exact reasons for the abandonment of the ram (, ) are unclear. Depictions of upward- pointing beaks in the 4th-century Vatican Vergil manuscript may well illustrate that the ram had already been replaced by a spur in late Roman galleys. One possibility is that the change occurred because of the gradual evolution of the ancient shell-first mortise and tenon hull construction method, against which rams had been designed, into the skeleton-first method, which produced a stronger and more flexible hull, less susceptible to ram attacks. Certainly by the early 7th century, the ram's original function had been forgotten, if we judge by Isidore of Seville's comments that they were used to protect against collision with underwater rocks. As for the lateen sail, various authors have in the past suggested that it was introduced into the Mediterranean by the Arabs, possibly with an ultimate origin in India. However, the discovery of new depictions and literary references in recent decades has led scholars to antedate the appearance of the lateen sail in the Levant to the late Hellenistic or early Roman period.; ; Not only the triangular, but also the quadrilateral version were known, used for centuries (mostly on smaller craft) in parallel with square sails. Belisarius's fleet during the Vandalic War, as described by Procopius of Caesarea, was apparently at least partly fitted with lateen sails, making it probable that by that time the lateen had become the standard rig for the dromon, with the traditional square sail gradually falling from use in medieval navigation. These 6th- century dromons were single-banked (\\"monoreme\\") ships of probably 50 oars, arranged with 25 oars on each side. Again unlike Hellenistic vessels, which used an outrigger, these extended directly from the hull. In the later two- banked (\\"bireme\\") dromons of the 9th and 10th centuries, the two oar banks (elasiai) were divided by the deck, with the first oar bank was situated below, whilst the second oar bank was situated above deck; these rowers were expected to fight alongside the ship's marines in boarding operations. The Greek scholar Christos Makrypoulias suggests an arrangement of 25 oarsmen beneath and 35 on the deck on either side for a dromon of 120 rowers. The overall length of these ships was probably about 32 meters. Although most contemporary vessels had a single mast (histos or katartion), the larger bireme dromons probably needed at least two masts in order to maneuver effectively, assuming that a single lateen sail for a ship this size would have reached unmanageable dimensions. The ship was steered by means of two quarter rudders at the stern (prymnē), which also housed a tent (skēnē) that covered the captain's berth (krab(b)at(t)os). The prow (prōra) featured an elevated forecastle (pseudopation), below which the siphon for the discharge of Greek fire projected, although secondary siphons could also be carried amidships on either side. A pavesade (kastellōma), on which marines could hang their shields, ran around the sides of the ship, providing protection to the deck crew. Larger ships also had wooden castles (xylokastra) on either side between the masts, similar to those attested for the Roman liburnians, providing archers with elevated firing platforms. The bow spur (peronion) was intended to ride over an enemy ship's oars, breaking them and rendering it helpless against missile fire and boarding actions. The four galeai ships uncovered in the Yenikapi excavations, dating to the 10th–11th centuries, are of uniform design and construction, suggesting a centralized manufacturing process. They have a length of about , and are built of European Black Pine and Oriental plane. Variants By the 10th century, there were three main classes of bireme warships of the general dromon type, as detailed in the inventories for the expeditions sent against the Emirate of Crete in 911 and 949: the [chelandion] ousiakon (), so named because it was manned by an ousia of 108 men; the [chelandion] pamphylon ([χελάνδιον] πάμφυλον), crewed with up to 120–160 men, its name either implying an origin in the region of Pamphylia as a transport ship or its crewing with \\"picked crews\\" (from , \\"all tribes\\"); and the dromōn proper, crewed by two ousiai.; In Constantine VII's De Ceremoniis, the heavy dromōn is said to have an even larger crew of 230 rowers and 70 marines; the naval expert John H. Pryor considers them as supernumerary crews being carried aboard, while Makrypoulias suggests that the extra men correspond to a second rower on each of the upper-bank oars.; A smaller, single-bank ship, the monērēs (μονήρης, \\"single-banked\\") or galea (γαλέα, from which the term \\"galley\\" derives), with ca. 60 men as crew, was used for scouting missions but also in the wings of the battle line. Three-banked (\\"trireme\\") dromons are described in a 10th-century work dedicated to the parakoimōmenos Basil Lekapenos. However, this treatise, which survives only in fragments, draws heavily upon references on the appearance and construction of a classical Greek trireme, and must therefore be used with care when trying to apply it to the warships of the middle Byzantine period. The existence of trireme vessels is, however, attested in the Fatimid navy in the 11th and 12th centuries, and references made by Leo VI to large Arab ships in the 10th century may also indicate trireme galleys. For cargo transport, the Byzantines usually commandeered ordinary merchantmen as transport ships (phortēgoi) or supply ships (skeuophora). These appear to have been mostly sailing vessels, rather than oared. The Byzantines and Arabs also employed horse-transports (hippagōga), which were either sailing ships or galleys, the latter certainly modified to accommodate the horses. Given that the chelandia appear originally to have been oared horse-transports, this would imply differences in construction between the chelandion and the dromōn proper, terms which otherwise are often used indiscriminately in literary sources. While the dromōn was developed exclusively as a war galley, the chelandion would have had to have a special compartment amidships to accommodate a row of horses, increasing its beam and hold depth.

The flats close to Lake Erie The Flats is a mixed-use industrial, entertainment, and increasingly residential area of Cleveland, Ohio, USA. The name reflects its low-lying topography on the banks of the Cuyahoga River. History In 1796, Moses Cleaveland and his survey party landed on the banks of the Cuyahoga upon their arrival from Connecticut. Early settlers included Lorenzo Carter, whose land holdings included much of what makes up today's East Bank entertainment district, including Whiskey Island, which was created when the mouth of the river was straightened by the Corps of Engineers. A log cabin on Merwin Road near Center Street on the East Bank is a recreation of Carter's house, which was further upstream. Early residents found the Flats inhospitable, with humid summers that brought airborne illness and harsh winters with strong winds and snowfall off Lake Erie. Many took to higher ground in current-day Downtown. These settlers often relied on local Native American residents who lived on the West Bank and were more adept at living in the area. Cleveland developed slowly until the arrival of the Ohio and Erie Canal, which brought a trade route from the Ohio River and other southern Ohio cities. The heavily Irish immigrant workforce that built the canal took residence on the West Bank of the Flats and neighboring Ohio City. Ohio City's rise, fueled by the produce that flowed from Medina County farms along U.S. 42 to the West Side Market, was soon viewed as a threat to Cleveland's development. In response, Cleveland destroyed its half of a floating bridge at Main Street (Main Street Bridge, located near the Cleveland Memorial Shoreway crossing) which was the sole river crossing. Cleveland then built a new bridge further downstream (Columbus Road Bridge)which connected Cleveland Mayor John W. Willey and developer/friend Jas Clark's \\"Willeyville\\" and \\"Cleveland Centre\\" developments along the newly constructed Columbus Road. The new bridge diverted the produce trade from the West Side Market to the new Central Market. Infuriated Ohio City residents, rallying with the cry of \\"Two bridges or none,\\" marched on the new bridge with guns, axes, and other tools.https://case.edu/ech/articles/c/columbus-street-bridge They met a mob of Cleveland residents ready to fight; the ensuing \\"Bridge War\\" was put down by county sheriff's officers. The courts ultimately forced Cleveland to rebuild its half of the Main Street Bridge, but the damage had been done, and Ohio City soon became the first area to be annexed by the larger city. A recession in the mid-19th century caused the Cleveland Centre mixed commercial and residential plan to collapse, and the land was purchased by industrialists connected to the canal and growing railroad lines. By this time, the Flats had become known as an unsavory place. The cities' poor Irish lived along the West Bank in the \\"Irish Ghetto\\" near the intersection of Columbus, Carter, Franklin, and Riverbed Roads. Shipmen would find services at establishments like the \\"Flat Iron\\", the oldest Irish Bar in the Flats, which was originally a four-story cafeteria and inn. Lumberyards lined the river with freshly cut wood waiting to be shipped. John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company on the East Bank was putting Cleveland on the map as an industrial power, even as the refineries were leaking oil into the Cuyahoga River. The Flats' industrial legacy, however, would be defined by its steel mills, located along the river south of the Tremont neighborhood and west of the Slavic Village. The mills were the pillar of the city's economy and the largest consumer of water and electricity. The names have changed over the years, from Republic and J&L;, to LTV to ISG to today's Mittal. Post-war recessions and production shifts to China and Europe hit the steel industry hard. Layoffs in the late 1970s forced many to find work elsewhere, or support from welfare programs. During this time, Cleveland, along with other industrial cities in the region like Youngstown, Pittsburgh, Detroit and Gary, had become known as the Rust Belt. LTV's repeated bankruptcies finally led to the closing their plants in 2000 (including Cleveland's plant), until investors formed ISG and resumed scaled- back operations. The story was similar downstream. Over the second half of the 20th century, much of the industry and manufacturing in the Flats closed, leaving decaying buildings and persistent pollution. The chemical-clotted Cuyahoga River caught fire several times; most recently in 1969, which brought national attention to the city's environmental woes and led one year later to the formation of the Ohio and U.S. Environmental Protection Agencies. =The Flats 1980s-2000s= The Flats and Downtown Cleveland, Ohio, as seen from the west bank of the Cuyahoga River The Goodtime III tour boat heads up the Cuyahoga River, as seen from the west bank of the Flats In the mid-1980s, the Flats saw a resurgence as an entertainment destination, a focal point of the renewed attention given to Cleveland's deteriorating downtown. Underground music venues appeared on the East Bank, while mainstream development first took place on the West Bank. The Powerhouse, built to power the city's cable cars, was renovated to include multiple bars, restaurants, and an outdoor music venue. Other warehouses and buildings were also renovated into nightlife destinations. At its peak in the early 1990s, the Flats had the highest concentration of bars in the Midwest, with both locally owned bars, nightclubs, and national restaurant chains lining both sides of the river from the mouth to the Oxbow bend. The Flats and Cleveland had soon become an entertainment mecca and destination for the region. The Flats Oxbow Association was formed to help redevelop the Flats, and housing development soon followed on both sides of the river, with new construction and warehouses being converted into condominiums and apartments. The Flats' 20th century heyday as an entertainment destination was short-lived. Three drowning deaths in one month in 2000, along with a city crackdown on fire and health code violations led to the closing of many bars. Patrons becoming scared off due to safety concerns led to a sharp decrease in business. While this was a boon for the redevelopment for the Warehouse District, the area just up the hill from the East Bank, it sent shock waves through the Flats' redevelopment from which it has never fully recovered. Most of the East Bank went \\"dark\\" due to the number of businesses that have closed. In the early 2000s, The West Bank fared better than the East Bank with longtime businesses like Shooters and the Harbor Inn remaining open, and the construction of condominiums at the remains of the Superior Viaduct in 2005. The Flats Third Act In September 2010, Cleveland Rowing Foundation closed a deal to reclaim of vacant, industrialized land to create Rivergate Park, a public park devoted to rowing, canoeing, kayaking and dragon-boating. The acres on Columbus Road Peninsula were formerly the Commodore's Club, a powerboat marina and boat storage center. Officially opened May 2011, Rivergate is home to Western Reserve Rowing Association, Cleveland Dragon Boat Association, the Cleveland Skatepark, the Ohio City Bike Co-Op and others. The Greater Cleveland Aquarium opened its doors on Jan. 21, 2012 in the FirstEnergy Powerhouse on the West Bank of the Flats. The 70,000-square-foot building was constructed in the late 19th century to generate electricity for the city’s cable cars. Plans were first unveiled in the summer of 2005 include leveling most of buildings in the East Bank and creating a new \\"neighborhood\\" that included mixed use live/work spaces, a movie theatre, shopping, a grocery store and riverwalk. The project was delayed by the 2007 Recession and court battles of property acquisition. A multiphase, $500 million mixed-use redevelopment along the East Bank of the Flats is being developed and financed by the Wolstein Group and Fairmount Properties. =Phase I= Opening in June 2013, the $275 million first phase included a 23-story office tower, 8-story Aloft hotel, restaurants, and a 16,000 sq. ft. health club, The office tower has been named the \\"Ernst and Young building.\\" The two anchor tenants include the law firm Tucker Ellis and West, and the largest tenant, Ernst and Young. The 450,000 sq. ft. office tower is all Class A office space and features a green, open-air rooftop terrace. The initial opening restaurants and bars included Ken Stewart's, Lago, Flip Side and Wileyville. Two Waterfront Line Cleveland RTA stations, Settlers Landing station and Main Avenue station received $375,000 upgrades. Work at both stations includes replacing brick and concrete pavers, repairing the glass shelters, and demolishing ticket booths. At Settlers Landing, crews will restore eight etched glass panels that act as wind screens. The artwork depicts scenes of Cleveland's settlement and the evolution of transportation. =Phase II= Several Restaurants (Alley Cat, Crop East Bank), bars (Beerheads, Punch Bowl Social), 1200-foot boardwalk, and 243 Apartments opened as a part of Phase 2 in 2015. By 2017, the Flats was once again vibrant and tourist friendly. New restaurants on the East bank, Cleveland Aquarium, Music Box performance venue/bar on the West Bank, along with a piano bar, 2 breweries, a Water Taxi between the East Bank and the West Bank and many other upscale amenities have changed what was as recently as 2010 a ghost town. Apartments above the tourist area rent in the $2000 range, and activity in the Flats might now be surpassing its former glory. The canal's towpath, part of the Ohio and Erie Canal Corridor, is also being restored to provide jogging and bike trails for city residents and to preserve part of the Flats history. Whiskey Island has also been purchased by Cuyahoga County in hopes of making it more accessible to residents in the form of a lakefront park. The water quality of the river has also improved since 1970, with fish populations returning increasingly each year. This is largely due to the unintended importation of zebra mussels from Asia in the ballast of ships in the Port of Cleveland or some other port on Lake Erie, as well as less dumping of waste into the river. Another mixed use development, Thunderbird, was announced for Scranton Peninsula, in June, 2018. https://www.clevescene.com/media/pdf/thunderbird.pdf Notes External links *Flats Forward * Flats, The Downtown Cleveland Redeveloped ports and waterfronts in the United States Historic districts in Ohio Irish-American culture in Cleveland Irish-American culture in Ohio Czech-American culture in Ohio ","title":"The Flats"},{"id":"1378695","text":"Taggart is a Scottish detective fiction television programme created by Glenn Chandler, who wrote many of the episodes, and made by STV Studios for the ITV network. It originally ran as the miniseries \\"Killer\\" from 6 until 20 September 1983, before a full series was commissioned that ran from 2 July 1985 until 7 November 2010. The series revolved around a group of detectives initially in the Maryhill CID of Strathclyde Police, though various storylines were set in other parts of Greater Glasgow and in other areas of Scotland. The team operated out of the fictional John Street police station. Mark McManus, who played the title character Jim Taggart, died in 1994. However, the series continued under the same name. Taggart was one of the UK's longest-running television dramas and the longest-running police drama after the cancellation of The Bill. The series theme music is \\"No Mean City\\", sung by Maggie Bell. History The Scottish BAFTA-winning pilot episode \\"Killer\\", directed by Laurence Moody and broadcast in 1983, introduced the character Detective Chief Inspector Jim Taggart (played by Mark McManus until his death in 1994), a tough and experienced detective who had worked his way up through the ranks. His original sidekick was Detective Sergeant Peter Livingstone (Neil Duncan). Livingstone represented the new breed of young graduates entering the police force and frequently had a difficult relationship with Taggart as a result. Taggart's boss in the pilot was Superintendent Robert Murray (Tom Watson). This humour was continued in the subsequent series when Taggart's boss after the second episode, \\"Dead Ringer\\", being Superintendent Jack McVitie (Iain Anders). Another important character was Taggart's wife Jean (Harriet Buchan), whose physical disability did not prevent her from pursuing a number of interests in life, while her cynical husband stuck mainly to his job. Throughout the McManus era, there was nearly always a sub-plot in every episode which involved the domestic life of the Taggarts, which on occasion became intertwined with the case being investigated. The most memorable of these was the Taggarts' ongoing care of Jean's senile Aunt Hettie (Sheila Donald), whom Jim despises and begrudges staying in his house.This sub-plot ran through 1990–91 until the Hettie character was killed off in the 1991 season finale, \\"Violent Delights, in which her funeral is carried out by a corrupt firm of undertakers who are also the subject of Taggart's investigation. In 1987 the character of Michael Jardine (James MacPherson) was introduced. Neil Duncan left the series in 1987 and in 1990 a new female sidekick Jackie Reid (Blythe Duff) was introduced. McManus died in 1994 during the filming of an episode. Taggart's absence in the broadcast story was explained by his being in meetings with the Chief Constable throughout. In 1995 the episode \\"Black Orchid\\" opened with Taggart's funeral. Despite the death of the title character the series went unchanged. Jardine was promoted to Detective Inspector and DC Stuart Fraser (Colin McCredie) was introduced, becoming the long-suffering sidekick to Jardine, former long-suffering sidekick to Taggart. Fraser was later revealed to be gay. McCredie had made an early appearance in Taggart when he played a suspect part of a youth gang. DI Robbie Ross (John Michie) joined the team in 1998. Michie had made an early appearance in Taggart in 1990 when he played a suspect called Robby Meiklejohn in an episode called \\"Love Knot\\". When MacPherson left the series in 2002 his character was killed off and replaced with DCI Matt Burke, formerly of Special Branch, played by Alex Norton, who had previously appeared in the series playing murder suspect George Bryce in 1986 in the episode \\"Knife Edge\\". Much was made of the platonic love between Jardine and Reid. The two were shown to share a brother/sister-like bond. Both pursued a number of relationships with other characters over the years. Reid even got married but later separated from her husband, who then died. The personal relationships of the police officers in this series were shown as nothing to be envious of: Reid once described herself, Burke, Ross and Fraser as three divorcees and a celibate homosexual in the episode \\"Penthouse and Pavement\\". After filming was completed on series 26 in December 2009, Colin McCredie was informed that he and his character would not be returning for filming of the next series. =ITV/STV dispute= ITV plc, the company that operates the ITV network franchises in England, Wales and southern Scotland, failed to announce whether it planned to show any new episodes of Taggart, prompting STV to suspend production of the programme in September 2009. STV announced in November 2009 that it would produce new episodes of Taggart for broadcast in 2010 regardless of whether ITV plc decided to screen it. In February 2010 it was announced that ITV and STV had put their wider commercial differences to one side to make a new series, which Scottish viewers got to see first. The two broadcasters co-commissioned a six-part series of the show UKTV also invested in return for repeat rights. New episodes of Taggart debuted on STV in autumn 2010 before being broadcast on ITV across the rest of the UK in 2011. The UKTV Channel Alibi showed the episodes in 2013. Online catch-up of the new series was not available to users of STV Player until the show had been broadcast on ITV and UTV. Format and broadcast information The format of the show changed over the years. Originally the show ran with three one-hour episodes to each story. This was later changed starting with the last transmitted story in 1998 to a regular pattern of two-hour stand-alone stories and beginning in July 2002 these were shortened to 60 minutes. After a two-hour special episode in January 2003 episodes were again lengthened starting in October this time to 90 minutes continuing through the 2008 New Year special \\"Genesis\\". After this the show became a series of one-hour stand-alone stories for the first time since 2003. Fans of the show were often frustrated by the erratic scheduling of the show. Although blocks or series of the show were filmed together they were often not shown together as with other series. Instead they were fitted into the schedule whenever there was a gap, meaning that they were often not shown in consecutive weeks or on one set night of the week. Often months passed between episodes of the same series being shown. This was very much the case in Australia with ABC TV showing episodes featuring the three lead actors in haphazard order with current or recent shows.This made it very difficult to understand the history of the show. =DVD releases= The DVD rights in the UK for many Taggart episodes the earlier series in particular are held by Clearvision. However some episodes in particular those from 2002 onwards have been released on DVD in the UK by Acorn Media UK. There are also Region 1 and Region 4 releases for North American and Australasian markets. Some of the DVD releases are now quite rare and deleted and there has been no Blu-ray release at present.

Recurring characters are listed in Cast sections above. Filming locations The show was primarily shot in and around Glasgow and its metropolitan area, but the show occasionally ventured further, for example to Loch Lomond, Edinburgh and the Scottish Highlands. The original title card of the show used a panoramic shot of Glasgow taken from the summit of the Cathkin Braes to the south of the city. In the early years live infill shots of the city were also taken from this vantage point. In later years a shot of the city centre taken from The Lighthouse on Mitchell Lane was used. In later series the buildings of Strathclyde University were extensively used for exterior shots. The entrance level of the Colville Building was used as the police station, for example, and John Street, the name given to the police station in the series, is a real location within the campus. Episodes Since 1983 there have been a total of 110 episodes of Taggart. Early episodes were split into multiple parts and aired over three weeks while later episodes were self-contained. International distribution In Australia the series airs on ABC1.In 2011 ABC1 aired episodes on Friday at 8:30pm. ABC1 actually broadcast episodes 101 IOU 102 Local Hero and 103 The Rapture\\" before STV did because of scheduling conflicts. 7TWO airs repeat episodes right back to the first episode. In New Zealand the series airs on Vibe. In Ireland the series airs on RTÉ. =Denmark= Taggart was a popular show on Danish broadcaster DR. Taggart was first on DR2 from 2002 to 2006 as six more episodes were then aired. After the digitizing of Danish television, Taggart appeared on DR1 from episodes featuring James MacPherson as DCI Jardine. Ever since Taggart has aired from the very first miniseries Killer until the episode length was cut to 45 minutes. Three-episode stories have aired one after another but have also combined into one long episode. No other British detective programme has aired as much as Taggart explained by the large number of available episodes. From a Danish television perspective, Taggart is unique as it became popular after it aired in the UK. After the death of Mark McManus and the departure of James MacPherson. DR states Taggart is the most resilient British criminal series ever.

The map p is called the covering homomorphism. A frequently occurring case is a double covering group, a topological double cover in which H has index 2 in G; examples include the Spin groups, Pin groups, and metaplectic groups. Roughly explained, saying that for example the metaplectic group Mp2n is a double cover of the symplectic group Sp2n means that there are always two elements in the metaplectic group representing one element in the symplectic group.  Properties  Let G be a covering group of H. The kernel K of the covering homomorphism is just the fiber over the identity in H and is a discrete normal subgroup of G. The kernel K is closed in G if and only if G is Hausdorff (and if and only if H is Hausdorff). Going in the other direction, if G is any topological group and K is a discrete normal subgroup of G then the quotient map p : G → G/K is a covering homomorphism. If G is connected then K, being a discrete normal subgroup, necessarily lies in the center of G and is therefore abelian. In this case, the center of H = G/K is given by :Z(H) \\\\cong Z(G)/K. As with all covering spaces, the fundamental group of G injects into the fundamental group of H. Since the fundamental group of a topological group is always abelian, every covering group is a normal covering space. In particular, if G is path- connected then the quotient group \\\\pi_1(H)/\\\\pi_1(G) is isomorphic to K. The group K acts simply transitively on the fibers (which are just left cosets) by right multiplication. The group G is then a principal K-bundle over H. If G is a covering group of H then the groups G and H are locally isomorphic. Moreover, given any two connected locally isomorphic groups H1 and H2, there exists a topological group G with discrete normal subgroups K1 and K2 such that H1 is isomorphic to G/K1 and H2 is isomorphic to G/K2.  Group structure on a covering space  Let H be a topological group and let G be a covering space of H. If G and H are both path-connected and locally path-connected, then for any choice of element e* in the fiber over e ∈ H, there exists a unique topological group structure on G, with e* as the identity, for which the covering map p : G → H is a homomorphism. The construction is as follows. Let a and b be elements of G and let f and g be paths in G starting at e* and terminating at a and b respectively. Define a path h : I → H by h(t) = p(f(t))p(g(t)). By the path-lifting property of covering spaces there is a unique lift of h to G with initial point e*. The product ab is defined as the endpoint of this path. By construction we have p(ab) = p(a)p(b). One must show that this definition is independent of the choice of paths f and g, and also that the group operations are continuous. Alternatively, the group law on G can be constructed by lifting the group law H × H → H to G, using the lifting property of the covering map G × G → H × H. The non-connected case is interesting and is studied in the papers by Taylor and by Brown-Mucuk cited below. Essentially there is an obstruction to the existence of a universal cover which is also a topological group such that the covering map is a morphism: this obstruction lies in the third cohomology group of the group of components of G with coefficients in the fundamental group of G at the identity.  Universal covering group  If H is a path-connected, locally path-connected, and semilocally simply connected group then it has a universal cover. By the previous construction the universal cover can be made into a topological group with the covering map a continuous homomorphism. This group is called the universal covering group of H. There is also a more direct construction which we give below. Let PH be the path group of H. That is, PH is the space of paths in H based at the identity together with the compact- open topology. The product of paths is given by pointwise multiplication, i.e. (fg)(t) = f(t)g(t). This gives PH the structure of a topological group. There is a natural group homomorphism PH → H which sends each path to its endpoint. The universal cover of H is given as the quotient of PH by the normal subgroup of null-homotopic loops. The projection PH → H descends to the quotient giving the covering map. One can show that the universal cover is simply connected and the kernel is just the fundamental group of H. That is, we have a short exact sequence :1\\\\to \\\\pi_1(H) \\\\to \\\\tilde H \\\\to H \\\\to 1 where \\\\tilde H is the universal cover of H. Concretely, the universal covering group of H is the space of homotopy classes of paths in H with pointwise multiplication of paths. The covering map sends each path class to its endpoint.  Lattice of covering groups  As the above suggest, if a group has a universal covering group (if it is path-connected, locally path-connected, and semilocally simply connected), with discrete center, then the set of all topological groups that are covered by the universal covering group form a lattice, corresponding to the lattice of subgroups of the center of the universal covering group: inclusion of subgroups corresponds to covering of quotient groups. The maximal element is the universal covering group \\\\tilde H, while the minimal element is the universal covering group mod its center, \\\\tilde H/Z(\\\\tilde H). This corresponds algebraically to the universal perfect central extension (called \\"covering group\\", by analogy) as the maximal element, and a group mod its center as minimal element. This is particularly important for Lie groups, as these groups are all the (connected) realizations of a particular Lie algebra. For many Lie groups the center is the group of scalar matrices, and thus the group mod its center is the projectivization of the Lie group. These covers are important in studying projective representations of Lie groups, and spin representations lead to the discovery of spin groups: a projective representation of a Lie group need not come from a linear representation of the group, but does come from a linear representation of some covering group, in particular the universal covering group. The finite analog led to the covering group or Schur cover, as discussed above. A key example arises from SL2(R), which has center {±1} and fundamental group Z. It is a double cover of the centerless projective special linear group PSL2(R), which is obtained by taking the quotient by the center. By Iwasawa decomposition, both groups are circle bundles over the complex upper half-plane, and their universal cover {\\\\mathrm{S}\\\\widetilde{\\\\mathrm{L}_2(}\\\\mathbf{R})} is a real line bundle over the half-plane that forms one of Thurston's eight geometries. Since the half- plane is contractible, all bundle structures are trivial. The preimage of SL2(Z) in the universal cover is isomorphic to the braid group on three strands.  Lie groups  The above definitions and constructions all apply to the special case of Lie groups. In particular, every covering of a manifold is a manifold, and the covering homomorphism becomes a smooth map. Likewise, given any discrete normal subgroup of a Lie group the quotient group is a Lie group and the quotient map is a covering homomorphism. Two Lie groups are locally isomorphic if and only if their Lie algebras are isomorphic. This implies that a homomorphism φ : G → H of Lie groups is a covering homomorphism if and only if the induced map on Lie algebras :\\\\phi_* : \\\\mathfrak g \\\\to \\\\mathfrak h is an isomorphism. Since for every Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak g there is a unique simply connected Lie group G with Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak g, from this follows that the universal covering group of a connected Lie group H is the (unique) simply connected Lie group G having the same Lie algebra as H.  Examples  * The universal covering group of the circle group T is the additive group of real numbers R with the covering homomorphism given by the exponential function exp: R → T. The kernel of the exponential map is isomorphic to Z. * For any integer n we have a covering group of the circle by itself T → T which sends z to zn. The kernel of this homomorphism is the cyclic group consisting of the nth roots of unity. * The rotation group SO(3) has as a universal cover the group SU(2) which is isomorphic to the group of versors in the quaternions. This is a double cover since the kernel has order 2. (cf the plate trick.) * The unitary group U(n) is covered by the compact group T × SU(n) with the covering homomorphism given by p(z, A) = zA. The universal cover is R × SU(n). * The special orthogonal group SO(n) has a double cover called the spin group Spin(n). For n ≥ 3, the spin group is the universal cover of SO(n). * For n ≥ 2, the universal cover of the special linear group SL(n, R) is not a matrix group (i.e. it has no faithful finite- dimensional representations).

Typically it is available as the white or colorless pentahydrate, Na2S2O3·5H2O. The solid is an efflorescent (loses water readily) crystalline substance that dissolves well in water. Sodium thiosulfate is used in gold mining, water treatment, analytical chemistry, the development of silver-based photographic film and prints, and medicine. The medical uses of sodium thiosulfate include treatment of cyanide poisoning and pityriasis. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. Uses =Medical uses= Sodium thiosulfate is used in the treatment of cyanide poisoning. Other uses include topical treatment of ringworm and tinea versicolor, and treating some side effects of hemodialysis and chemotherapy. =Iodometry= In analytical chemistry, the most important use comes because the thiosulfate anion reacts stoichiometrically with iodine in aqueous solution, reducing it to iodide as the thiosulfate is oxidized to tetrathionate: : Due to the quantitative nature of this reaction, as well as because has an excellent shelf-life, it is used as a titrant in iodometry. is also a component of iodine clock experiments. This particular use can be set up to measure the oxygen content of water through a long series of reactions in the Winkler test for dissolved oxygen. It is also used in estimating volumetrically the concentrations of certain compounds in solution (hydrogen peroxide, for instance) and in estimating the chlorine content in commercial bleaching powder and water. =Photographic processing= Silver halides, e.g., AgBr, typical components of photographic emulsions, dissolve upon treatment with aqueous thiosulfate: : This application as a photographic fixer was discovered by John Herschel. It is used for both film and photographic paper processing; the sodium thiosulfate is known as a photographic fixer, and is often referred to as 'hypo', from the original chemical name, hyposulphite of soda. Ammonium thiosulfate is typically preferred to sodium thiosulfate for this application. =Gold extraction= Sodium thiosulfate and ammonium thiosulfate are a component of an alternative lixiviants to cyanide for extraction of gold. Thiosulfate forms strong soluble complexes with gold(I) ions, . The advantages of this approach are that (i) thiosulfate is essentially nontoxic and (ii) that ore types that are refractory to gold cyanidation (e.g. carbonaceous or Carlin-type ores) can be leached by thiosulfate. Some problems with this alternative process include the high consumption of thiosulfate, and the lack of a suitable recovery technique, since does not adsorb to activated carbon, which is the standard technique used in gold cyanidation to separate the gold complex from the ore slurry. =Neutralizing chlorinated water= It is used to dechlorinate tap water including lowering chlorine levels for use in aquariums, swimming pools, and spas (e.g., following superchlorination) and within water treatment plants to treat settled backwash water prior to release into rivers. The reduction reaction is analogous to the iodine reduction reaction. In pH testing of bleach substances, sodium thiosulfate neutralizes the color-removing effects of bleach and allows one to test the pH of bleach solutions with liquid indicators. The relevant reaction is akin to the iodine reaction: thiosulfate reduces the hypochlorite (active ingredient in bleach) and in so doing becomes oxidized to sulfate. The complete reaction is: : Similarly, sodium thiosulfate reacts with bromine, removing the free bromine from solution. Solutions of sodium thiosulfate are commonly used as a precaution in chemistry laboratories when working with bromine and for the safe disposal of bromine, iodine, or other strong oxidizers. Structure Two polymorphs are known of the pentahydrate. The anhydrous salt exists in several polymorphs. In the solid state, the thiosulfate anion is tetrahedral in shape and is notionally derived by replacing one of the oxygen atoms by a sulfur atom in a sulfate anion. The S-S distance indicates a single bond, implying that the terminal sulfur holds a significant negative charge and the S-O interactions have more double-bond character. Production On an industrial scale, sodium thiosulfate is produced chiefly from liquid waste products of sodium sulfide or sulfur dye manufacture. In the laboratory, this salt can be prepared by heating an aqueous solution of sodium sulfite with sulfur or by boiling aqueous sodium hydroxide and sulfur according to this equation: : Principal reactions Upon heating to 300 °C, it decomposes to sodium sulfate and sodium polysulfide: : Thiosulfate salts characteristically decompose upon treatment with acids. Initial protonation occurs at sulfur. When the protonation is conducted in diethyl ether at −78 °C, H2S2O3 (thiosulfuric acid) can be obtained. It is a somewhat strong acid with pKas of 0.6 and 1.7 for the first and second dissociations, respectively. Under normal conditions, acidification of solutions of this salt excess with even dilute acids results in complete decomposition to sulfur, sulfur dioxide, and water: : This reaction is known as a \\"clock reaction\\", because when the sulfur reaches a certain concentration, the solution turns from colorless to a pale yellow. This reaction has been employed to generate colloidal sulfur. This process is used to demonstrate the concept of reaction rate in chemistry classes. =Aluminium cation reaction= Sodium thiosulfate is used in analytical chemistry. It can, when heated with a sample containing aluminium cations, produce a white precipitate: : =Organic chemistry= Alkylation of sodium thiosulfate gives S-alkylthiosulfates, which are called Bunte salts. The alkylthiosulfates are susceptible to hydrolysis, affording the thiol. This reaction is illustrated by one synthesis of thioglycolic acid: : : References Thiosulfates Sodium compounds Photographic chemicals Antidotes Antifungals for dermatologic use Orphan drugs Specialty drugs World Health Organization essential medicines ","title":"Sodium thiosulfate"},{"id":"1378712","text":"441x441px Music of Tamil Nadu has a long tradition and history going back thousands of years. Music is a very important aspect of marriage and temple festival Tamil people. Ancient music The tradition of Tamil music goes back to the earliest period of Tamil history. Many poems of the Sangam literature, the classical Tamil literature of the early common era, were set to music. There are various references to this ancient musical tradition found in the ancient Sangam books such as Ettuthokai and Pathupattu. The early narrative poem Cilappatikaram, belonging to the post-Sangam period also mentions various forms of music practiced by the Tamil people. Music was also utilised in the compositions of the Tamil Saiva saints such as Appar, Thirugnana Sambanthar and Manikkavasagar during the Hindu revival period between the sixth and the tenth centuries CE. The musical poet (sandakkavi) Arunagirinathar further embellished the Tamil musical tradition through his compositions of Tamil hymns known as Thiruppugazh. Thiruppugazh - Umbartharu Pannisai Tiruvannamalai temple sculpture depiction of musicians Pann, which is the classical music form of Southern India, has a long history in Tamil Nadu. Later the name was mistakenly changed as Carnatic music. Even today Pannisai is sung in temple festivals. Tamil Nadu has produced a number of famous performers, as well as a closely related classical dance form Bharatha Natyam. Chennai hosts a large cultural event, the annual Madras Music Season, which includes performances by hundreds of artists. There are 72 basic scales on the octave, and a rich variety of melodic motion. Both melodic and rhythmic structures are varied and compelling. This is one of the world's oldest and richest musical traditions. Songs have been composed by great artists and handed down through generations of disciples. The composers belonging to the Tamil Trinity of Muthu Thandavar (1560 - 1640 CE), Arunachala Kavi (1712– Baratanatyam music 1779) and Marimutthu Pillai (1717–1787) composed hundreds of devotional songs in Tamil and helped in the evolution of Carnatic music. Three saint composers of the 18th to 19th Century, Tyagaraja, Muthuswami Dikshitar and Shyama Shastri, have composed thousands of songs that remain favourites among musicians and audiences. Today, Tamil Nadu has hundreds of notable carnatic singers who spread this music all over the world. M. S. Subbulakshmi, a renowned carnatic singer, had the honour of singing a song in the UN Security Council. Folk music Parai Attam பறையாட்டம் Ekkalam, A traditional wind instrument of Tamil Nadu A.R. Rahman at Chennai concertalt=left179x179px Urumi melam Folk singing remains popular, especially in rural areas; elements of the traditional styles are sometimes used in film music. There are contemporary enthusiasts, like Vijayalakshmi Navaneethakrishnan and Pushpavanam Kuppuswamy, who have worked to revive popular interest in the folk music of Tamil Nadu. The urumee mellam also remains as one of the more popular forms of folk music in rural Tamil Nadu and the ensemble is most often played with an urumee and the nadaswaram as the instrument of choice. The rural hill tribes of Tamil Nadu each have their own folk traditions. The Pulayar, for example, perform melodies called talams which are said to come from the cooing of birds. Each talam is named after a deity, including Kunhanada talam, Mangalanada talam and Karaganachi talam. Film music Tamil cinema is well known for its talented composers. The two most famous and acclaimed film composers of India, Ilaiyaraaja and A. R. Rahman are from Tamil Nadu. Other prominent Tamil film score and soundtrack composers in the industry include Harris Jayaraj, Yuvan Shankar Raja, Vidyasagar, D. Imman, G. V. Prakash Kumar Anirudh Ravichander, Santhosh Narayanan and Hiphop Tamizha. During the 1960s and 1970s, prominent film composers K. V. Mahadevan, M. S. Viswanathan and others were popular. The film music of Tamil Nadu is widely known for its innovation and eclecticism. Scores may showcase blends of Carnatic, Western and other instruments, with a range of melodic and rhythmic patterns. Orchestral themes and minimalist songs often feature. Recent trends show the prevalence of synthesizers and other electronic instruments.

In chemistry, efflorescence (which means \\"to flower out\\" in French) is the migration of a salt to the surface of a porous material, where it forms a coating. The essential process involves the dissolving of an internally held salt in water, or occasionally in another solvent. The water, with the salt now held in solution, migrates to the surface, then evaporates, leaving a coating of the salt. In what has been described as \\"primary efflorescence,\\" the water is the invader and the salt was already present internally. Some people describe a reverse process, where the salt is originally present externally and is then carried inside in solution, as \\"secondary efflorescence.\\" However, others would give this latter phenomenon another name entirely. Efflorescences can occur in natural and built environments. On porous construction materials it may present a cosmetic outer problem only (primary efflorescence causing staining), but can sometimes indicate internal structural weakness (migration/degradation of component materials). Efflorescence may clog the pores of porous materials, resulting in the destruction of those materials by internal water pressure, as seen in the spalling of brick. Examples # A 5 molar concentration aqueous droplet of NaCl will spontaneously crystallize at 45% relative humidity (298 K) to form an NaCl cube by the mechanism of homogeneous nucleation. The original water is released to the gas phase. # Gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O) is a hydrate solid that, in a sufficiently dry environment, will give up its water to the gas phase and form anhydrite (CaSO4). # Copper(II) sulfate (bluestone) (CuSO4.5H2O) is a blue crystalline solid that when exposed to air, slowly loses water of crystallization from its surface to form a white layer of anhydrous copper(II) sulfate. #Sodium carbonate deca hydrate (Na2CO3.10H2O) will lose water when exposed to air. Masonry =Primary efflorescence= Primary efflorescence is named such, as it typically occurs during the initial cure of a cementitious product. It often occurs on masonry construction, particularly brick, as well as some firestop mortars, when water moving through a wall or other structure, or water being driven out as a result of the heat of hydration as cement stone is being formed, brings salts to the surface that are not commonly bound as part of the cement stone. As the water evaporates, it leaves the salt behind, which forms a white, fluffy deposit, that can normally be brushed off. The resulting white deposits are referred to as \\"efflorescence\\" in this instance. In this context efflorescence is sometimes referred to as \\"saltpetering.\\" Since primary efflorescence brings out salts that are not ordinarily part of the cement stone, it is not a structural, but, rather, an aesthetic concern. For controlling primary efflorescence, formulations containing liquid fatty acid mixtures (e.g., oleic acid and linoleic acid) have commonly been used. The oily liquid admixture is introduced into the batch mix at an early stage by coating onto the sand particles prior to the introduction of any mix water, so that the oily admixture is distributed uniformly throughout the concrete batch mix. =Secondary efflorescence= Secondary efflorescence is named such as it does not occur as a result of the forming of the cement stone or its accompanying hydration products. Rather, it is usually due to the external influence of concrete poisons, such as chlorides. A very common example of where secondary efflorescence occurs is steel-reinforced concrete bridges as well as parking garages. Saline solutions are formed due to the presence of road salt in the winter. This saline solution is absorbed into the concrete, where it can begin to dissolve cement stone, which is of primary structural importance. Virtual stalactites can be formed in some cases as a result of dissolved cement stone, hanging off cracks in concrete structures. Where this process has taken hold, the structural integrity of a concrete element is at risk. This is a common traffic infrastructure and building maintenance concern. Secondary efflorescence is akin to osteoporosis of the concrete. For controlling secondary efflorescence, admixtures containing aqueous-based calcium stearate dispersion (CSD) are often added at a later stage of the batching process with the mix water. In a typical batching process, sand is first charged into the mixer, then the oil-based primary anti-efflorescence admixture is added with constant mixing to allow the oil to coat the sand. Then coarse aggregates, colorants, and cement are added, followed by water. If CSD is used, it is then introduced usually at this point during or after the addition of the mix water. CSD is an aqueous dispersion wherein fine solid particles of calcium stearate are suspended in the water uniformly. Commercially available CSD has an average particle size of about 1 to 10 micrometres. The uniform distribution of CSD in the mix may render the resulting concrete masonry unit water repellent, as CSD particles are well distributed in the pores of the unit to interfere with the capillary movement of water. Calthemite is also a secondary deposit derived from concrete, mortar or lime, which can be mistakenly assumed to be efflorescence. Calthemites are usually deposited as calcite which is the most stable polymorph of calcium carbonate (CaCO3).Smith, G.K. (2016). \\"Calcite straw stalactites growing from concrete structures\\", Cave and Karst Science 43(1), 4-10. http://bcra.org.uk/pub/candks/index.html?j=127Smith, G K., (2015). \\"Calcite Straw Stalactites Growing From Concrete Structures\\". Proceedings of the 30th 'Australian Speleological Federation' conference, Exmouth, Western Australia, edited by Moulds, T. pp 93 -108 = Protecting against efflorescence = The only way to completely and permanently prevent (both primary and secondary) efflorescence in cementitious materials is by using special admixtures that chemically react with and bind the salt-based impurities in the concrete when hydrogen (H) is present. The chemical reaction in these special additives fuses the sodium chloride on a nanomolecular level, converting it into non- sodium chemicals and other harmless matter that will not leach out or migrate to the surface. In fact, the nanotechnology in these additives can be up to 100,000 times smaller than even the smallest cement particles, allowing their molecules to literally pass through cement minerals or sand particles and ultimately become part of the cement or sand with which they react. And since they require the presence of hydrogen they stop reacting as the concrete dries out and begin reacting again when the concrete is exposed to moisture. It is also possible to protect porous building materials, such as brick, tiles, concrete and purely against efflorescence by treating the material with an impregnating, hydro-phobic sealer. This is a sealer that repels water and will penetrate deeply enough into the material to keep water and dissolved salts well away from the surface. However, in climates where freezing is a concern, such a sealer may lead to damage from freeze/thaw cycles. And while it will help to protect against efflorescence, it cannot permanently prevent the problem. Efflorescence can often be removed from concrete using phosphoric acid. After application the acid dilution is neutralised with mild diluted detergent, and then well rinsed with water. However, if the source of the water penetration is not addressed efflorescence may reappear. Common rebar protective measures include the use of epoxy coating as well as the use of a slight electrical charge, both of which prevent rusting. One may also use stainless steel rebar. Certain cement types are less resistant to chlorides than others. The choice of cement, therefore, can have a large effect upon the concrete's reaction to chlorides. Today's water repellents help create a vapor permeable barrier; liquid water, especially from wind driven rains, will stay out of the brick and masonry. Water vapor from the interior of the building, or from the underside of pavers can escape. This will reduce efflorescence, spalling and scaling that can occur from water being trapped inside the brick substrate and freezing during cold weather. Years ago, the water repellents trapped moisture in the masonry wall creating more problems than they solved. Condensation in areas that experienced the four seasons were much more problematic than their counterparts. =Image gallery= Image:Ausblühungen.JPGPrimary efflorescence on a brick wall in Germany.

Wearing a blazer Cricketer Steve Waugh wearing baggy green cricket cap and striped, college-style blazer in Australia's national colours. A seersucker blazer, typically worn at American Ivy League universities, and by some attendees at Henley Regatta. Blazers are worn with a wide variety of other clothes, ranging from a dress shirt and necktie to an open-necked polo shirt, or even just a plain T-shirt. They are seen with trousers of all colours and fabrics, from the classic white cotton or linen, to grey flannel, to brown or beige chinos, and also jeans. A fitted, classically cut, double-breasted navy blue blazer with navy-style buttons is a popular design and sometimes referred to as a \\"reefer\\" blazer. Particularly in North America and the United Kingdom, it is now frequently used in business casual attire. A Cambridge University Rifle Association half-blue blazer Blazers, in a wide range of colours, are worn as part of school uniforms by many schools across the Commonwealth, and are still daily wear for most uniformed pupils in Britain, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. These are blazers in the traditional sense: single-breasted, and often of bright colours or with piping. This style is also worn by some boat clubs, such as those in Cambridge or Oxford, with the piped version used only on special occasions such as a boat club dinner. In this case, the piping is in college colours, and college buttons are worn. This traditional style can be seen in many films set in the Edwardian era, such as Kind Hearts and Coronets. Where the blazer is part of the dress of a school, college, sports club, or armed service regimental association (veterans' organization), it is normal for a badge to be sewn to the breast pocket. In schools, this badge may vary according to the pupil's standing in the school: being a member of the junior or senior school, being a prefect, or having been awarded colours in recognition of particular achievement in some academic or sporting field. In the British Commonwealth, many regimental associations wear \\"regimental blazers\\" which also sport a similar badge on the breast pocket, usually in the form of a wire badge, and sometimes also regimental blazer buttons. In the British army, officers do not normally wear badges on their blazers (or boating jackets). Two regimental blazers will rarely be the same, as they are sourced from different civilian suppliers and are not issued by any authority. This results from the fact that the members of the association are no longer serving personnel, but civilians, though still retaining the bond that the badge represents. The standard colour is navy blue, although in some associations different colours are worn, such as rifle green for the associations of rifle regiments. Blazers, once commonly worn playing or attending traditional \\"gentlemen's sports\\", persist in only some games now, such as occasional use by tennis players, or in cricket, where in professional matches, such as international test matches, it is considered customary for the captain to wear a blazer with the team's logo or national coat of arms on the breast pocket – at least during the coin toss at the beginning of the match. Two sporting events where blazers signify victory are the Congressional Cup Regatta at the Long Beach Yacht Club, and the Masters golf tournament, held in Augusta, Georgia. The former event awards a crimson blazer to the winner of several flights of match race sailing of the highest international calibre, while the latter awards a green blazer to the top Masters golfer in the USA. History The sartorial term blazer originated with the red \\"blazers\\" of the Lady Margaret Boat Club (1825), the rowing club of St. John's College, Cambridge. The Lady Margaret club jackets were termed blazers because of the bright red cloth, and the term survived the original red coat. A writer to the London Daily News (22 August 1889) commented that \\"In your article of to-day … you speak of 'a striped red and black blazer', 'the blazer', also of 'the pale toned' ones … A blazer is the red flannel boating jacket worn by the Lady Margaret, St. John's College, Cambridge, Boat Club. When I was at Cambridge it meant that and nothing else. It seems from your article that a blazer now means a coloured flannel jacket, whether for cricket, tennis, boating, or seaside wear.\\" Woman wearing a teal blazer. These early blazers were like later sports jackets, but this term has never referred to blazers, instead describing jackets derived from the later innovation of wearing odd jackets for land-based sports. Assertions that the name is derived from HMS Blazer are not borne out by contemporary sources, although it is reported that before the standardization of uniform in the Royal Navy, the crew of HMS Blazer wore \\"striped blue and white jackets\\",The History of Rating Uniforms : Uniforms and Badges of Rank : RN Life : Training and People : Royal Navy apparently in response to the sailors of HMS Harlequin being turned out in harlequin suits. As late as 1837 the gig's crew of HMS Blazer were dressed by their Captain in jackets of blue and white stripes and it is from this that the word blazer, meaning a striped jacket, has entered the language. The reefer jacket was of naval origin, and described the short double-breasted jacket worn by sailors in harsh weather, when they performed duties such as reefing the sails. It is descendants of this which are now commonly described by the term blazer. Originally with black horn buttons, these jackets evolved to the modern dark blazer, now single as well as double breasted, and with metallic buttons. Striped blazers became popular among British Mods in the early 1960s, and again during the Mod revival of the late 1970s – particularly in three-colour thick/thin stripe combinations, with three-button single- breasted front, five- or six-inch side or centre vents, and cuffs with multiple buttons. Various photos from 1964 and 1965 show London mods in boating blazers. Photos of mod icons The Who from 1964 (as the High Numbers) variously show Pete Townshend, Keith Moon and John Entwistle wearing boating blazers. Another mod band, Small Faces, and other bands liked by mods – such as The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, The Kinks, Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames, The Animals, The Yardbirds, The Moody Blues and The Troggs – had band members wearing striped blazers/boating jackets, or later, brightly coloured blazers with wide white or other light edging. These later blazers often had non-metal buttons, sometimes in the same colour as the edging. The earlier style of striped blazers can be seen in the film Quadrophenia. The later, bright, style of blazer was affectionately adopted by Austin Powers as part of his Swinging-London look. By the late 2000s the blazer had been adopted as a popular fashion trend amongst women, often having shorter lengths, rolled-up sleeves, various lapels and bright colours.

The Mandovi and the Zuari are the two primary rivers in the state of Goa. Mandovi joins with the Zuari at a common creek at Cabo Aguada, forming the Mormugao harbour. Panaji, the state capital and Old Goa, the former capital of Goa, are both situated on the left bank of the Mandovi. River course The river has a total length of ; in Karnataka, in Maharashtra and in Goa. It originates from a cluster of 30 springs at Bhimgad in the Western Ghats in the Belagavi district of Karnataka. The river has total 2,032 km2 catchment area of which 1,580 km2, 375 km2 and 77 km2 catchment area are in Goa, Karnataka and Maharashtra respectively. With its cerulean waters, Dudhsagar Falls and Varapoha Falls, it is also known as the Gomati in a few places. The Mandovi enters Goa from the north via the Sattari Taluka and from Uttara Kannada District of Karnataka near the Castle Rock Rly. Stn. The Mandovi flows through Belagavi, Uttara Kannada in Karnataka and Cumbarjua, Divar and Chorão in Goa, eventually pouring into the Arabian Sea. The river Mapusa is a tributary of the Mandovi. The Cumbarjuem Canal, which links both rivers, has made the interiors of the Mandovi accessible to ships carrying iron ore. Iron ore is Goa's prime mineral and it is mined in the eastern hills. Three large freshwater isles -- Divar, Chorão and Vanxim are present in the Mandovi near the town of Old Goa. The island of Chorão is home to the Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary, named after the renowned ornithologist Salim Ali. A regular ferry transports the inhabitants between the isles and the mainland. Bridges Spanning across the Mandovi River near Panjim are three parallel Mandovi Bridges. The older bridge collapsed in the 1980s before a new bridge was constructed to accommodate heavy transport vehicles. The Mandovi Bridge links the towns of Panjim to Porvorim. On 14 June 2014, the foundation stone for the third bridge, which is the largest bridge in Goa, was laid by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It will span and will be higher than the existing bridges and will be spaced in between the two. The 3rd Mandovi bridge is name Atal Setu after former Prime Minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The bridge was inaugurated on 27 January 2019 at the hands of Union Roads Minister Nitin Gadkari, Goa CM Manohar Parrikar. During the winter months, the peak tourist season, special dusk cruises on the Mandovi - complete with serenading bands - add to the charm of the river. Interstate water sharing The sharing of the waters of this river is a cause of dispute between the governments of Karnataka and Goa. The Karnataka government proposes to divert some water from the Mahadayi river to the Malaprabha River basin as part of the Kalasa-Banduri Nala project, as approximately 188 tmcft of water at 75% dependability is available in the river. Mahadayi Water Disputes Tribunal under Interstate River Water Disputes Act has been constituted to decide the sharing of the river waters by the riparian states. In August 2018, Mahadayi Water Tribunal verdict permitted Goa to use 24 tmcft (excluding the 9.395 tmcft prevailing uses), Karnataka to use 13.42 tmcft of which 5.5 tmcft is meant for use within the river basin and for diversion to the Malaprabha reservoir, and around 8 tmcft for power generation (including 3.9 tmcft for export outside the basin) and Maharashtra to use 1.33 tmcft for consumptive purposes. The tribunal assessed the water generated in the river catchment area of Karnataka and Maharashtra as 32.11 tmcft and 7.21 tmcft respectively at 75% dependability. The tribunal has apportioned only 40.125 tmcft of Mandovi river water for consumptive uses among the three riparian states. Karnataka approached the Supreme Court alleging injustice is done in allocation of water to the state.

More narrowly, brute facts may instead be defined as those facts which cannot be explained (as opposed to simply having no explanation).John Hospers, An Introduction to Philosophical Analysis (1997) p. 211 To reject the existence of brute facts is to think that everything can be explained. (\\"Everything can be explained\\" is sometimes called the principle of sufficient reason). There are two ways to explain something: say what \\"brought it about\\", or describe it at a more \\"fundamental\\" level. For example, a cat displayed on a computer screen can be explained, more \\"fundamentally\\", as there being certain voltages in bits of metal in the screen, which in turn can be explained, more \\"fundamentally\\", as certain subatomic particles moving in a certain manner. If one were to keep explaining the world in this way and reach a point at which no more \\"deeper\\" explanations can be given, then they would have found some facts which are brute or inexplicable, in the sense that we cannot give them an ontological explanation. As it might be put, there may exist some things that just are. The same thing can be done with causal explanations. If nothing made the Big Bang expand at the velocity it did, then this is a brute fact in the sense that it lacks a causal explanation. Brute/scientific fact Henri Poincaré distinguished between brute facts and their scientific descriptions, pointing to how the conventional nature of the latter always remained constrained by the brute fact in question.Gary Gutting, French Philosophy in the Twentieth Century (2001) p. 32 Pierre Duhem argued that just as there may be several scientific descriptions of the same brute fact, so too there may be many brute facts with the same scientific description.Gutting, p. 34 Anscombe G. E. M. Anscombe wrote about how facts can be brute relative to other facts. Simply put, some facts cannot be reducible to other facts, such that if some set of facts holds true, it does not entail the fact brute relative to it. The example she uses is that of someone owing a grocer money for supplying them with potatoes. In such a case, the set of facts, e.g. that the customer asked for the potatoes, that the grocer supplied them with the potatoes, etc., does not necessarily entail that the customer owes the grocer money. After all, this could all have transpired on the set of a film as a bit of acting, in which case the customer would not actually owe anything. One might argue that if the institutional context is taken into account, putatively brute facts can be reduced to constituent facts. That is, in the context of something like the institution of a market, a customer ordering potatoes, etc. would entail that they owe the grocer compensation equal to the service that was provided. While Anscombe does acknowledge that an institutional context is necessary for a particular description to make sense, it does not necessarily follow that a particular set of facts holding true in an institutional context entails the fact brute relative to it. To wit, if the example is indeed considered in the institutional context necessary for descriptions of 'owing', it could still be the case that the customer does not owe the grocer, per the counterexample of a film production. This fundamental ambiguity is essentially what makes a fact brute relative to other facts. That being said, Anscombe does argue that under normal circumstance, such a fact is actually entailed. That is, if it is true that a customer requested potatoes, etc., then under normal circumstances the customer would indeed owe the grocer money. However, because such entailment is conditional on such a set of facts holding true under a particular set of circumstances, the fact entailed is still fundamentally brute relative to such facts, just that in such a case the leap in inference occurs at the level of the circumstances, not that of the facts themselves. Finally, if a fact brute relative to other facts holds true, it follows that some set of facts it is brute relative to is also true, e.g. if the customer owes the grocer money, then it follows that the grocer supplied them with potatoes. After all, had they not done so, then the customer would not owe them money. As such, given some fact brute relative to other facts, there is a range of facts, such that a set of them will hold if the fact brute relative to them also holds. That being said, Anscombe argues that the full range of facts that some fact can be brute relative to cannot be known exhaustively. The rough range can be sketched out with relevant, paradigmatic examples, but the full range of such facts cannot be known, as one can theoretically always suppose a new special context that changes the range. Searle John Searle developed Anscombe's concept of brute facts into what he called brute physical facts—such as that snow is on Mt. Everest—as opposed to social or institutional facts, dependent for their existence on human agreement.Searle, p. 121 and p. 1-2 Thus, he considered money to be an institutional fact, which nevertheless rested ultimately on a brute physical fact, whether a piece of paper or only an electronic record. Searle thought that the pervasiveness of social facts could disguise their social construction and ultimate reliance upon the brute fact: thus, we are for example trained from infancy (in his words) to see \\"cellulose fibres with green and gray stains, or enamel-covered iron concavities containing water...[as] dollar bills, and full bathtubs\\".Searle, p. 56 and p. 4 Opposition The principle of sufficient reason is sometimes understood to entail that there are no brute facts. Vintiadis In 2018 Elly Vintiadis edited a collection of papers on brute facts that is the first systematic exploration of bruteness and which includes original papers by a number of philosophers and scientists. The collection focuses on physical, emergent and modal brute facts rather than social facts. Vintiadis argues that a properly understood naturalistic attitude requires that we accept the existence of ontological brute facts and also, possibly, emergent brute facts. Beyond the initial definition given above of brute facts as facts that do not have explanations, there is a distinction drawn by Eric Barnes (1994) between epistemically brute facts and ontologically brute facts. The former are for which we do not have an explanation, they are brute for us (e.g., Vintiadis cites the fact that gases behave in a manner described by the Boyle-Charles law was an epistemologically brute fact until its explanation in terms of the kinetic theory of gases). The latter, ontologically brute facts are facts for which there is no explanation in virtue of the way the world is (e.g., the fundamental laws of physics). Which facts we accept as ontologically brute though depends on what kind of theory of explanation we accept (e.g. the properties of fundamental particles will be brute facts under a mereological view of explanation, but a fundamental law will be brute under a covering law model of explanation). Brute Necessities John Heil has argued that brute facts can only be contingent facts, since otherwise asking for an explanation for something that couldn’t be otherwise doesn’t make sense. Joseph Levine agrees with this since for him explanation means removing different possibilities. But not all agree, because some philosophers argue that it is a natural question to ask why some things are necessary. For instance philosopher James Van Cleve believes that brute necessities cannot be excluded. Infinitism According to explanatory infinitism, the chain of explanations goes on infinitely and there is no fundamental explanation. This, then, is another way of objecting to the existence of explanatory brute facts, but also metaphysical brute facts, if bruteness is understood in terms of ontological independence.

The \\"pocket rocket\\" badge recognizes those commissioned officers and enlisted personnel of the US Air Force who have qualified as missile personnel (both TAC and SAC (now AFGSC)) that have been trained in the maintenance or launching of land-based and air-launched nuclear weapons under the direction of the National Command Authority. Originally known as the Missileman Badge, the Missile Badge later became known as the Missileer Badge or more informally the Pocket Rocket and is still often referred to by this name. History Following its creation in 1958, the badge came in only one style. In 1963 the name was changed to the Missileman Badge and the three levels of Basic, Senior and Master were added. Although primarily issued to Atlas, Titan I/Titan II, Minuteman I/II/III and Peacekeeper missile crews of the Strategic Air Command (SAC), it was also issued to Tactical Air Command (TAC) Matador and Mace missile crews of the 1960s and Gryphon Ground Launched Cruise Missile (GLCM) crews of the 1980s and early 1990s. The badge, at all 3 levels, was also awarded to Air Defense Command personnel maintaining and on launch crews of both the BOMARC A/B and the Thor in the 1960s and 1970sPersonally awarded by USAF orders while serving on BOMARC and Thor programs. Per AFR 35-5 and AFR 35-5/ADC Supplement 1. In the late 1980s, this badge was redesignated as the missile maintenance insignia while a new version bracketed by an oak wreath became the missile operations badge. By 1992, all USAF tactical missiles were retired or in the process of being retired. The same year, SAC was inactivated and its ICBM force briefly transferred to the newly created Air Combat Command (ACC) before being transferred again to the Air Force Space Command (AFSPC). In 2004, the Air Force Space Command Commander, General Lance Lord, announced the introduction of a new space badge. The new combined Space and Missile Operations Badge was informally known as \\"spings\\" (SPace wINGS). The new badge was no longer limited to pure space and missile operators or maintainers, but was also awarded to those in Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) 61XX, 62XX and 63XX who performed space/ICBM acquisition duties, even if they were non- operational in nature. Also in 2004, Interim Change (IC) 2004-1 to AFI 36-2923 expanded the missile badge award criteria to include the 21M and 2W career fields. AFI 36-2923 was rendered obsolete and superseded by AFI 36-2903 dated 2 August 2006. 21M officers that do not complete MMOC must supervise 2M/2W personnel in maintenance loading and unloading for 12 months to be awarded the basic badge. 2W personnel are awarded the basic badge after working directly with guided missiles or missile systems for 12 months after completion of technical training school. Missile Operations badge, basic After deactivation of the Titan missile system in 1987, enlisted personnel were no longer authorized to earn the Missile Badge with operations designator. However, all enlisted personnel assigned to nuclear silo maintenance duty are eligible to wear the standard Missile Badge (without the operations designator) if qualified under the military specialties 411XX or the new 2M0XX field. From 1991 to early 2006, the Missile Badge was the standard speciality badge for the above two career fields. In June 2008, the Air Force Chief of Staff, General Michael Moseley, announced the return of the missile badge with operations designator for intercontinental ballistic missile crews. The missile badge may be worn with the space badge by those who qualify.\\"Officials Bring Back Missile Badges, Wings.\\", Air Force Space Command Public Affairs 6 June 2008. In 2011, the Air Force Space Command divested itself of the ICBM force and all USAF strategic nuclear missile operations and maintenance personnel were transferred to the newly created Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) The Missile Badge was also awarded to personnel engaged in satellite control duties in AFSCs 20xx and 308xx. Award required at least one year qualified as operationally ready in a satellite control position. Individuals who already awarded a missile badge were advanced one degree. The Missile Badge was replaced by the Space Badge (later designated as the Space and Missile Badge) for Space Operations personnel circa 1983. In the 1960s and 1970s, some personnel involved in research and development in rockets and missiles were awarded Missileman badges, such as some personnel at the Air Force Rocket Propulsion Lab (AFRPL). Purpose and degrees The Missile Badge is awarded as a permanent decoration upon a service member’s graduation from missile operations or maintenance officer training (if awarded to an officer) or from maintenance tech school if awarded to an enlisted service member. The badge is worn on the left breast pocket and is the largest of the U.S. Air Force speciality badges. It is also one of the few United States military badges which is not transferable between services, meaning that a qualified recipient, who transfers to another branch of the United States armed forces cannot display the Missile Badge on another service uniform. Command Missile Operations badge The Missile Badge is issued in three degrees: basic, senior, and command (operations)/master (maintenance). The level of degree is determined by a service member’s years of missile duty in the Air Force and also the level of command responsibility held within the Air Force missile units. Any officer who is or has been combat mission ready (CMR), as a missile crewmember at an operational ICBM unit qualifies to wear the missile badge with operations designator—a wreath encircling the missile. The basic badge is awarded once the member graduates Initial Qualification Training at Vandenberg AFB. Officers with six years of nuclear experience qualify for the senior badge, and they qualify for the command badge after nine years experience. The Senior Missile Badge is denoted by a star above the decoration, with the Command Missile Badge displaying a star surrounded by a small wreath. The Missile Badge without operations designator is awarded to those qualified to perform maintenance on the weapon system, but are not involved with the actual launch procedures. Most Air Force members who earned the Missile Badge with operations designator also earned the Combat Readiness Medal after two years of qualified service in an active missile launch control center. Missile operations (13N) is no longer a subset of the Space Operations career field (13S) and thus Missile Operators no longer are awarded a Space Badge. As of 1 October 2009, officers who have gone through the missile operations training are awarded their badge upon completion of the class.

Its 3D graphics-engine used both gouraud shading and texture-mapping on both aircraft-models and terrain, an impressive feat at the time. Significant plot elements were presented through in-game cut-scene animations, a hallmark storytelling vehicle from Chris Robert's previous Wing Commander games. Strike Commander has been called \\"Privateer on Earth,\\" due to the mercenary role- playing in the game. The game was mass released in 1994 as part of a Creative Labs bundle pack with Syndicate Plus, Ultima VIII: Pagan and Wing Commander II: Vengeance of the Kilrathi. It was also available in a CD bundle with Wing Commander: Privateer; both games included the core game, the expansion pack and voice pack on a single CD-ROM disc. The game was re-released in 2013 on Gog.com with support for Windows and macOS. Gameplay The player accepts missions from interesting characters and gets paid for doing them which allows the player to buy more weapons. The missions involve flying an F-16 Fighting Falcon and, in the last missions of the game, the more advanced F-22, while accomplishing certain objectives and missions. Other simulators, such as the F-22 series from Novalogic have been compared with Strike Commander because of their simplified flight model and emphasis on graphic detail, which makes them relatively similar in terms of philosophy.  Plot  The game takes place in a fictional near-future (2011) where significant political changes have occurred in the world. It revolves around a group of crack private military contractor fighter pilots in a group known as the 'Wildcats', based in Turkey who fly F-16 Fighting Falcons. The events that occur in Strike Commander are triggered by events starting 20 years before the game is set, actually the seeds are sown in the 1980s and onwards, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the disastrous economic policies of the United States, conflict in the Middle East, the world-wide dependence on petroleum and the resultant rise in nationalism globally.  History  = Development = The Strike Commander project took more than four years and over a million man hours on background development. Very little of that production time turned out to be actually usable in the final product, as at least one and possibly several complete project \\"reboots\\" were required to refine the graphical engine to a playable state. Nevertheless, some successful gameplay elements from Strike Commander were re-used by other more notable Origin products such as Privateer and the Wing Commander series. Chris Roberts, in the game's manual, compares the game's long development time with the events in the 1991 documentary Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse, a film account of what it took to get the 1979 film Apocalypse Now made. = Release = A separate Speech Pack, sold on floppy disk, replaced some of the game's text-dialogue with voice-acted recordings. An expansion pack Strike Commander: Tactical Operations continued the game's story by adding more missions and flyable aircraft. A later CD-ROM edition of Strike Commander bundled the game, expansion pack, and more audio content (beyond what was available in the Speech Pack). In March 2013 Strike Commander was re-released in the Digital Distribution by gog.com.Strike Commander - Simulations-Klassiker jetzt über GOG.com veröffentlicht on Gamestar.de (german) In 2013 a SC reverse engineering project by Fabien Sanglard with a reconstructed source code variant became available on GitHub as the original source code was most probably lost in the take over of Origin by EA (\\"abandonware\\").libRealSpace on github.com Reception In August 1993 Computer Gaming World stated that \\"Strike is not and does not attempt to be a high-fidelity simulation ... It focuses on action and combat\\" and \\"is designed to get players in the air and having fun in the shortest amount of time\\", with a \\"much gentler learning curve\\" than Falcon 3.0 or Red Baron and better graphics than F-117 Stealth Fighter 2.0 or Jetfighter. In December the magazine described the game as \\"probably the most hardware-intensive game yet released\\". In April 1994 the magazine said that the CD version's additional difficulty levels, improvement to the \\"admittedly enhanced combat sequences\\" including a more realistic F-16 flight model, and the expansion missions made it \\"the best option\\". In 1994, PC Gamer UK named Strike Commanders CD-ROM release the 36th best computer game of all time. The editors called it \\"the game as it should have been in the first place, and [...] one of the best CD titles so far.\\" In 1996, Computer Gaming World ranked Strike Commander as the 13th top vaporware title in computer game history (due 1991, delivered 1993), stating \\"The haze you see from the cockpit is emblematic of this title's troubled development on the bleeding edge of technology.\\"CGW 148 The 15 Vaporware Title in Computer Game History  See also  * Pacific Strike * Wings of Glory References External links * 1993 video games DOS games Combat flight simulators FM Towns games Games commercially released with DOSBox MacOS games NEC PC-9801 games Origin Systems games Video games developed in the United States Video games scored by Martin Galway Video games set in 2011 Windows games ","title":"Strike Commander"},{"id":"1378874","text":"Kevelaer is a town in the district of Kleve, in North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany.

More than 1 million pilgrims, mostly from Germany and the Netherlands, visit Kevelaer every year to honour the Virgin Mary.City of Kevelaer The population in 2015 was 28,311. History Kevelaer is a center of veneration and pilgrimage to Our Lady, Comforter of the Afflicted (also known as Our Lady of Consolation. According to tradition, a merchant named Hendrik Busman, in the days before Christmas, 1641, three times heard a voice saying \\"Here thou shalt build me a chapel\\". He began to set money aside but feared his wife, Mechel, wouldn't approve. She, however, had a vision, around Pentecost, in which she saw a little chapel containing a print of Our Lady of Consolation, all bathed in light. The story was confirmed by two passing soldiers, who saw the house light up at night. Days before, two soldiers had tried to sell her two copperplate engravings with the same image on it, but she found it too expensive. Hendrik began building the chapel while Mechel tried to obtain the print. The chapel was consecrated and on 1 June 1642, the Sunday after Assumption of Mary, the print was displayed in it, and the chapel became such a popular destination for pilgrims that a church was built for them between 1643 and 1645. The little chapel was replaced in 1654 with a larger one, the Gnadenkapelle, which still houses the print. It is one of the best visited Catholic pilgrimage locations in north-western Europe. The Gnadenkapelle (Chapel of Grace) has drawn pilgrims to the Lower Rhine Region from all over the world for more than 360 years. Pope John Paul II visited in 1987.

The President and the majority of the seats in the Assembly of the Union are directly elected. Electoral history Following World War II, the Comoros began to elect representatives to the French National Assembly, with Saïd Mohamed Cheikh elected from the islands in 1945. The following year the islands elected a General Council for the first time. Kevin Shillington (2013) Encyclopedia of African History, Routledge, p291 In 1952 the Council became the Territorial Assembly, and in 1962 became the Chamber of Deputies.Martin Ottenheimer & Harriet Ottenheimer (1994) Historical Dictionary of the Comoro Islands, Scarecrow Press, p67 Following independence in the mid-1970s, presidential elections were held in October 1978, with Ahmed Abdallah as the sole candidate. In parliamentary elections in December that year all candidates ran as independents. Shortly before the 1982 parliamentary elections the Comorian Union for Progress (Uzdima) had been declared the sole legal party, and won 37 of the 38 seats, with the remaining one going to an independent. Abdallah was again the sole candidate in the 1984 presidential elections, whilst the 1987 parliamentary elections saw Uzima win all 42 seats. Multi-party politics was reintroduced in 1990 and Said Mohamed Djohar of Udzima won the presidential elections that year, beating Mohamed Taki Abdoulkarim of the National Union for Democracy in the Comoros in the second round, having finished as runner-up in the first round. The 1992 parliamentary elections produced a fragmented legislature, with 14 parties winning seats and none holding more than seven. Early elections the following year produced a majority for the pro-presidential Rally for Democracy and Renewal, which won 28 of the 42 seats. The 1996 presidential elections were won by Abdoulkarim, and the parliamentary elections later in the year saw the pro-Abdoulkarim National Rally for Development win 36 of the 43 seats amidst an opposition boycott. As a result of a coup, the next presidential elections were not held until 2002, with independent candidate Azali Assoumani elected unopposed in the second round after his opponents boycotted it. However, parliamentary elections in 2004 resulted in a victory for the opposition Camp of the Autonomous Islands. The 2006 presidential elections were won by Ahmed Abdallah Mohamed Sambi. The parliamentary elections in 2009 were won by the Baobab movement supportive of the President. Presidential elections in 2010 saw Ikililou Dhoinine elected President. The delayed 2015 parliamentary elections produced another fragmented Assembly, with the Union for the Development of the Comoros emerging as the largest party with eight seats.

Prior to a 2018 referendum that amended the electoral system, the presidency rotated between the Comoros' three main islands; Anjouan, Grande Comore and Mohéli; when it was an island's turn to hold the presidency, the first round was held on that island, with the top three candidates progressing to a nationwide second round. =Assembly of the Union= The 33 seats in the Assembly of the Union are divided into 24 seats directly elected in single-member constituencies using the two-round system, and nine seats elected by the Island assemblies, each of which elect three members.Electoral system IPU Referendums Several referendums have been held in the Comoros. In 1958 the islands voted in favour of the new French constitution, which resulted in them becoming part of the French Community (rejection would have led to independence). An independence referendum was held in 1974, which resulted in a large majority (95%) in favour of independence. However, one island, Mayotte, voted against referendum, and was subsequently separated from the rest of the Comoros to remain under French control. Following independence, a referendum was held on the continued presidency of Ali Soilih in October 1977; despite a vote in favour, Soilih was overthrown the following May. Following his overthrow, a constitutional referendum was held, with 99% of voters voting in favour of the new constitution. Further constitutional referendums were held in 1989, 1992, 1996, 2001, 2009 and 2018.

He served at two Roman churches: Santa Maria in Monserrato and Santissima Trinità dei Pellegrini. Maestro di cappella of the Collegio Germanico (from 1595), he held the same position at S Pietro from 1602, but he left the post to Francesco Soriano from 1 January 1603; in the same year Pacelli became Maestro di cappella of King Sigismund III of Poland, who had one of the most important royal chapels in Europe.Luca Marenzio, Marco Scacchi and Giovanni Francesco Anerio were musicians at the same court. He remained at that position until his death. As appreciation to him, the King ordered an epitaph commemorating Pacelli to be constructed in the St. John's Cathedral in Warsaw. The original epitaph with the composer's portrait was destroyed when the Cathedral was also destroyed during the Planned destruction of Warsaw; it was nonetheless reconstructed after the war.

Though little is known about him outside of the poems he allegedly wrote, his works and their subsequent prose redactions impacted later incarnations of the Arthurian legend and its prose cycles, particularly due to his Christian backstory for the Holy Grail. Life Robert de Boron wrote Joseph d'Arimathe for a lord named Gautier de Montbéliard and he took on the name Boron from a village near Montbéliard. What is known of his life comes from brief mentions in his own work. At one point in Joseph, he applies to himself the title of meisters (medieval French for \\"clerk\\"); later he uses the title messires (medieval French for \\"knight\\"). At the end of the same text, he mentions being in the service of Gautier of \\"Mont Belyal\\", whom Pierre Le Gentil identifies with one Gautier de Montbéliard (the Lord of Montfaucon),Pierre Le Gentil, \\"The Work of Robert de Boron and the Didot Perceval\\", chapter 19, in Arthurian Literature in the Middle Ages, A Collaborative History, (ed. R.S. Loomis). Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1959. who in 1202 left for the Fourth Crusade, and died in the Holy Land in 1212. Le Gentil argues that the mention of Avalon shows that Robert wrote Joseph after 1191, when the monks at Glastonbury claimed to have discovered the coffins of King Arthur and Guinevere. His family is unknown, though the second author of the Prose Tristan claimed to be Robert's nephew, calling himself \\"Helie de Boron\\" (this is taken more as an attempt to drop a famous name than a genuine accreditation, however). Although Le Gentil describes him as a \\"poet endowed with boldness and piety but with mediocre talent\\", his work was immensely successful and influential. In particular, his version of the myth of the Holy Grail, originally an element of Chrétien de Troyes's unfinished Perceval, was adopted by almost all of the later writers of the Matter of Britain. Works Robert de Boron is considered the author of two surviving poems in octosyllabic verse, the Grail story (also known as the Metrical Joseph and the Estoire dou Graal) and Merlin; the latter work survives only in fragments and in later versions rendered in prose since, which originally happened around 1210 and possibly was done by Robert himself. The two poems are thought to have formed either a trilogy - with a verse Perceval forming the third part - or a tetralogy - with Perceval and the short Mort Artu (Death of Arthur). Collectively, it is known as the Grant Estoire dou Graal, the Roman du Graal, the Livre du Graal, and the Little Grail Cycle, or just simply as Robert de Boron's cycle (the Robert Cycle). The , also known as the Romance of Perceval in Prose, a retelling of Percival's story similar in style and content to the other works attributed to Robert, and attached to them, may or may be not be a prosification of the lost sections, and contains elements from Chrétien's own unfinished Perceval and its Second Continuation. It also includes a separate section known as the Mort Artu (The Death of Arthur), effectively a further continuation, and seems to have in turn served as a source for later works such as Perlesvaus. Linda Gowans, however, proposed a theory according to which Robert wrote only the Joseph in prose, which she also regards as the original version.https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/arthurian-studies-in-honour-of- pjc-field/what-did-robert-de-boron-really- write/63AF54D8D3256571C463A9B93BA85900 Robert de Boron merged the Grail myth with a Christian dimension to produce a history of the Grail. According to him, Joseph of Arimathea used the Grail (the Last Supper vessel) to catch the last drops of blood from the Christ's body as he hung on the cross. Joseph's family brought the Grail to the vaus d'Avaron, the valleys of Avaron in the west, which later writers changed to Avalon, identified with Glastonbury, where they guarded it until the rise of Arthur and the coming of Percival. Robert also introduced a \\"Rich Fisher\\" variation on the Fisher King and is also credited with introducing Merlin as born of a devil and a virgin and destined to be a redeemed Antichrist. In particular, his works laid a foundation for, and were eventually included in a reworked form into, the Vulgate Cycle and then the subsequent Post-Vulgate Cycle, the latter of which was formerly known as the \\"pseudo-Robert de Boron cycle\\" due to the Huth Merlin manuscript's author's attribution of the entire work to Robert.

It takes its name from the cemetery site of Arras, at Arras Farm, near Market Weighton, which was discovered in the 19th century. The site spans three fields, bisected by the main east-west road between Market Weighton and Beverley, and is arable farmland; little to no remains are visible above ground. The extent of the Arras culture is loosely associated with the Parisi tribe of pre-Roman Britain. The culture is defined by its burial practices, which are uncommon outside East Yorkshire, but are found in continental Europe, and show some similarities with those of the La Tène culture. The inhumations include chariot burials, or burials in square enclosures, or both; in contrast to continental inhumations the cemeteries were crowded, not extended, and the chariots typically disassembled. The burials have been dated from the latter part of the 1st millennium BC to the Roman conquest (about 70 AD). The burial goods and chariot designs were primarily British in style, not continental. Many of the archaeological finds are in the Yorkshire Museum and the British Museum. Background The site was first investigated by a group of local gentry in 1815–1817, including William Watson, the Rev E. W. Stillingfleet, and Barnard Clarkson. Their investigations were detailed, encompassing the excavation of more than a hundred barrows in fields north and south of the Market Weighton to Beverley road, now the A1079. Many of the excavation details have been lost, but detailed recording was undertaken of four barrows with the richest grave goods. They were named the King's Barrow, the Queen's Barrow, the Lady's Barrow and the Charioteer's Barrow by the excavators. Work in 1850 by John Thurnam of the Yorkshire Antiquarian Club led to further investigations of these barrows; Thurnam published a report detailing the human remains from his excavation. Chariot burials The site of the Arras cemetery is about long and some 100 barrows were identified, four of which contained chariot burials.Curator of Archaeology, Yorkshire Museum, lecture 4 March 2014 The name of the site lends itself to the culture, archaeologically based around chariot burials, across North and East Yorkshire. Other sites that are part of the Arras culture are so named because of the prevalence of cart-burials (two wheels) and / or wagon-burials (four wheels) or small finds similar to those from Arras which are otherwise rare or unique in the British Iron Age. Other sites of similar La Tène period burials within the Arras culture, often with chariot burials include: Cawthorn Camps, Pexton Moor, Seamer, Hunmanby, Burton Fleming, Danes Graves, Garton, Wetwang, Middleton on the Wolds, Beverley and Hornsea. The small number of chariot burials, even within the Arras culture, suggests that people buried with chariots were a local elite and this is supported by high-quality metalwork and imported materials (such as coral) in grave goods. The Pocklington Iron Age burial ground is a prehistoric cemetery discovered in 2014 on the outskirts of Pocklington in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England. In 2017, the ongoing excavations uncovered a rare chariot burial comprising an Iron Age chariot and two horses dated to about BC 320 to 174. Although chariot burials have been found elsewhere in the UK, the one at Pocklington is the first to have been found with horses also interred. The remains of the presumed driver, most likely a high-status individual, also were found, along with iron fragments from the chariot's body. The wooden elements of the chariot had rotted away, but had mostly been preserved as stains in the ground. One wheel had been destroyed, probably by ploughing. A bronze shield in the grave was exceptionally well preserved. The shield's boss bears a resemblance to the Wandsworth shield boss (circa BC 350 to 150), owned by the British Museum. One design element on the Pocklington shield, a scalloped border, \\"is not comparable to any other Iron Age finds across Europe, adding to its valuable uniqueness\\", said Paula Ware, managing director at MAP Archaeological Practice Ltd. \\"The discoveries are set to widen our understanding of the Arras (Middle Iron Age) culture and the dating of artefacts to secure contexts is exceptional,\\" Ware added. =Other burials= The number of non-chariot burials vastly outweighs those with chariots. Such burials are always inhumations within a square barrow. Skeletal remains in the graves are laid out most commonly on a north-south axis where the head is facing north. The skeletons at Burton Fleming have been identified in three major poses: extended fully, with the legs bent at the knees (sometimes drawn up parallel with the thigh) and with the legs drawn up against the chest. Grave goods include metalwork, ceramics and animal remains. Pig and horse bones are frequently associated with the burials. Arras graves The original excavations by William Watson uncovered more than 100 square-barrows, square earthworks several metres long containing a single inhumation grave often accompanied by grave-goods. Material uncovered in the graves is of particularly high quality and is often unique in Iron Age Britain and includes copper-alloys, iron, animal bone, coral, jet and enamel. Of the four barrows, most material from the King's Barrow, the Queen's Barrow and the Charioteer's Barrow are accessioned to the Yorkshire Museum and the Lady's Barrow to the British Museum. =King's Barrow= Although little remained of the earthwork at the time of excavation, the barrow measured in diameter and covered a circular grave in diameter and deep It contained the body of a man, orientated on a north-south axis, above the remains of a two-wheeled cart. The wheels were placed above the skull of a horse. The wooden frame of the cart did not survive, but the iron tyres, nave-hoops, iron and copper linch pins did. Terret rings and other harness fittings were also recovered. Horse-bit from the King's Barrow, now in the British Museum =Queen's Barrow= The Queen's Barrow is the only one of the four named graves that does not include a chariot burial. Small finds from this site are primarily items of personal decoration: a coral brooch, a disc pendant (with coral inlay), two bracelets, a gold ring, an amber ring, a bronze ring, a toilet-set and a necklace of green and blue glass beads. =Charioteer's Barrow= The Charioteer's Barrow measured in diameter and stood high at the time of excavation. Despite the grave containing a chariot burial and grave goods, no skeletal remains were recorded. It is probable that the records have been lost rather than the grave did not contain an inhumation. Iron tyres, nave-loops and other harness fittings were removed from the barrow. =Lady's Barrow= The Lady's Barrow contained a female skeleton and a dismantled two-wheeled chariot. Its earthwork measured in diameter and was high. The inhumation pit was in diameter and deep.

This article contains a brief history of Turkish painters and art movements from the mid-19th century to the present. Mid-19th century to early 20th century Turkish painting, in the Western sense, developed actively starting from the mid 19th century. *Ferik İbrahim Paşa (1815–1891) *Osman Nuri Paşa (c.1839–1906) *Osman Hamdi Bey (1842–1910) *Şeker Ahmet Paşa (1841–1907) *Halil Paşa (c.1857–1939) *Hoca Ali Riza (1864–1939) The very first painting lessons were scheduled at the Mühendishane-i Berri-i Humayun (Military School of Engineering) in 1793 mostly for technical purposes. Artists who formed the 19th-century art milieu were often from Ottoman military schools. Additionally, local Christian and \\"Levantine\\" artists, as well as foreign painters who lived in Istanbul and other parts of the Ottoman Empire, contributed to the art milieu in 19th century Turkey. Some Turkish artists, such as Osman Hamdi Bey, Şeker Ahmet Paşa, Süleyman Seyyid and Halil Paşa were educated in arts abroad. Others, such as Hüseyin Zekai Paşa, Hoca Ali Riza, and Ahmet Ziya Akbulut were educated within the country. The \\"1914 Generation\\" *Nazmi Ziya Guran (1881–1937) Contemporary trends that emphasize figure started to appear gradually in Turkey with the \\"1914 Generation\\". Figure and composition entered the Turkish painting for the first time in the Western sense with this generation. The İnas Sanayi-i Nefise Mektebi (School of Fine Arts for Girls) was founded for young women in 1914. Mihri Müşfik Hanım, and Feyhaman Duran were the first instructors. A studio was built with army support in Şişli, a district of Istanbul, with Celal Esat Arseven's attempt in 1917. Hüseyin Avni Lifij's \\"Progress\\" and \\"War Allegory\\", İbrahim Çallı's \\"Cannon Carrier\\", Mehmet Ruhi's \\"Stone Breakers\\" were the first examples of multi-figured and large dimensional compositions realised prior to and following this period.  The Independents (Müstakiller)  The young Turkish artists sent to Europe in 1926 came back inspired by contemporary trends such as Fauvism, Cubism and even Expressionism, still very influential in Europe, and they took a stand against the \\"1914 Generation\\" members. The important goals of this new group were, though not very absolute, pictorial design structure and linear foundation rather than impressionist colorism. The activities of the group, under the name of \\"Association of Independent Painters and Sculptors\\", expanded with the participation of new artists in 1928. The association's founders were mostly painters, such as: *Hale Asaf (1905–1938) *Muhittin Sebati (1901–1932) *Ratip Aşir Acudoğlu (1898–1957), sculptor \\"The Group D\\" While the Müstakiller (the \\"Independents\\") opened the doors of contemporary trends in Turkey, we see a newly founded group in 1933 which would give greater support to these efforts and of which their effectiveness lasted until the 1950s: \\"Group D\\". Group members were: *Abidin Dino (1913–1993) The most significant distinction of \\"Group D\\" from the \\"Independents\\" was perhaps that they had gathered around a certain aesthetics with solidarity in determination to defend the new trends they wanted to bring in. \\"Group D\\" had not been representative of any particular view. They were open to anything new except Impressionism. The star of the Çallı generation faded away gradually after the \\"Independents\\" and \\"Group D\\" members had started to work at the Academy. *Cemal Tollu (1899–1968) *Bedri Rahmi Eyuboğlu (1911–1975) Besides all this progress, from the beginning there had also been independent artists. Among these *Fikret Mualla can be counted. Later on *Adnan Coker (born 1927) *Fahrunissa Zeid (1901–1991) *Burhan Doğançay (1929–2013) took place in this trend.

Battle of Maserfield Historia Brittonum, Chapter 65, notes that \\"[Penda] fought the battle of Cocboy, in which fell Eawa, son of Pybba, his brother, king of the Mercians, and Oswald, king of the North-men, and he gained the victory by diabolical agency.\\" The Annales Cambriae (644) mentions \\"[t]he battle of Cogfry in which Oswald king of the Northmen and Eawa king of the Mercians fell.\\"The date is given as 644 instead of 642, two years after, contrary to both Bede and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. These two sources state that Eowa was a king of the Mercians himself at the time of the Battle of Maserfield (or Cogwy), in which he was killed, on August 5 of what was probably the year 642. The later Mercian kings Æthelbald, Offa and Ecgfrith were descended from Eowa; the period of their rule began in 716 following the death of Penda's grandson Ceolred and ended with Ecgfrith's death in December 796. It was in the battle of Maserfield that Oswald of Northumbria was defeated and killed by the Mercians under Penda. Eowa also died in that battle, although little is known about this. It has been suggested that Eowa may have been a co-ruler of the Mercians alongside Penda, or possibly even superior in status to Penda at this time (if so, this could explain why the Historia Brittonum seems to date Penda's reign from the battle of Maserfield), and that he may have been subject to Oswald and fighting as his ally in the battle.\\"The Formation of the Mercian Kingdom\\", in S. Bassett's The Origins of Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms. It is possible that it was customary among the Mercians until this time for there to be more than one king, and Penda and Eowa may have ruled over the southern and northern Mercians respectively. Neither Bede, in his Ecclesiastical History of the English People, nor the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle mentions Eowa's participation or death at Maserfield, or his previously being a Mercian king, but the Chronicle later mentions him when tracing the descent of Æthelbald and Offa. Nicholas Brooks wrote that, if Eowa is considered to have ruled during the period between roughly 635 and Maserfield, this could account for an obscure recorded Welsh raid into Mercian territory, during which it is said that no mercy was shown to \\"book-holding monks\\". Brooks noted that if Eowa was a Northumbrian puppet, there would be the possibility that Oswald may have made moves to promote Christianity in Mercia at this time, thus accounting for the presence of monks in what was still a pagan kingdom. Since Penda is known to history as an ally of the Welsh, this along with the presence of monks makes it seem unlikely that the raid could have taken place during his rule. Descendants A fragment of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, recounting Eowa's descendants (Offa's line). The Anglo- Saxon Chronicle records the lineage of two Mercian kings of Eowa's blood, Æthelbald and Offa. \\"Aethelbald was Alweo's offspring, Alweo Eawa's offspring, Eawa Pybba's offspring...\\", Later, it gives the lineage of Eowa's great-great- grandson Offa, who ruled from 757 to 796 and was descended from Osmod rather than Eowa's other son Alweo: \\"That Offa was Thingfrith's offspring, Thingfrith Eanwulf's offspring, Eanwulf Osmod's offspring, Osmod Eawa's offspring, Eawa Pybba's offspring, Pybba Creoda's offspring, Creoda Cynewald's offspring, Cynewald Cnebba's offspring, Cnebba Icel's offspring, Icel Eomer's offspring, Eomer Angeltheow's offspring, Angeltheow Offa's offspring, Offa Wermund's offspring, Wermund Wihtlaeg's offspring, Wihtlaeg Woden's offspring\\".

The melody is taken from the ballet Dance of the Hours by Amilcare Ponchielli, while the lyrics were written by Allan Sherman and Lou Busch. Allan based the lyrics on letters of complaint which he received from his son Robert who was attending Camp Champlain, a summer camp in Westport, New York. In 2020, the song was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". The song The song is a parody that complains about the fictional \\"Camp Granada\\" and is set to the tune of Amilcare Ponchielli's Dance of the Hours. The name derives from the first lines: :Hello Muddah, hello Fadduh. Here I am at Camp Granada. Camp is very entertaining. And they say we'll have some fun if it stops raining. The lyrics go on to describe unpleasant, dangerous, and tragic developments, such as fellow campers going missing or contracting deadly illnesses. He asks how his \\"precious little brother\\" is doing, and begs to be taken home, afraid of being left out in the forest and fearing getting eaten by a bear, promising to behave, and even letting his aunt Bertha hug and kiss him. At the end, he notes that the rain has stopped and fun activities have begun (such as swimming, sailing, and baseball), and asks his parents to \\"kindly disregard this letter\\". Success The song scored #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 list for three weeks beginning on August 24, 1963. It was kept from #1 by both \\"Fingertips\\" by \\"Little\\" Stevie Wonder and \\"My Boyfriend's Back\\" by The Angels. Sherman wrote a new 'back at Camp Granada' version, \\"Hello Mudduh, Hello Fadduh! 64\\", for a May 27, 1964, performance on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. Sherman began that version by giving a camp whistle, followed by his spelling Granada's name, and then sticks out his tongue. In that version, the narrator is back at camp, where some things, like the food have improved, \\"because the little black things in it are not moving\\". However, no one knows where his bunk, trunk, or the skunk is. The narrator wishes that the showers, that have thin doors, were moved indoors. Lenny Bruce was scheduled to entertain there at the camp. The narrator loves the camp, missing the poker games, and is taking care of his once homesick younger brother, who is immature. \\"He's like all of us except his bed is wetter\\". This version was released as a single in 1964. Sherman wrote a third version for, and acted in, a 1965 TV commercial for a board game about Camp Granada, a \\"real rotten camp\\". The original version also reached #9 on the Pop-Standard Singles chart. The song hit number one in Hong Kong, which does not have any summer camps. The song won the 1964 Grammy Award for Best Comedy Performance. It was played frequently on the Dr. Demento Show and is featured on the Rhino Records compilation album, Dr. Demento 20th Anniversary Collection. It was played over the end credits of the 1993 film Indian Summer and was briefly heard in The Simpsons episode \\"Marge Be Not Proud\\" after Bart Simpson switches the family's answering machine cassette tapes, to which Homer got confused and assumed it was Lisa phoning from a summer camp. It was featured in the final scene of The King of Queens episode \\"Tube Stakes\\", during which main character Arthur Spooner performs his morning stretches. Translations Variations of the song include adaptations in Swedish (\\"Brev från kolonien\\" by Cornelis Vreeswijk), Finnish (\\"Terve mutsi, terve fatsi, tässä teidän ihmelapsi\\") and Norwegian (\\"Brev fra leier'n\\" by Birgit Strøm). The Finnish version is included in the Finnish Boy Scouts' songbook. The Swedish version notably does not revolve around the camper hating the camp, but is about the kids running roughshod over it and having run off all the counselors, one of whom has committed suicide after they let a snake into the mess hall, and the organizer of the camp being arrested by police after the kids start a forest fire. The song begins with the boy writing the letter asking his parents to send more money, because he has lost all his pocket money playing dice with the other campers. The song then ends with the boy having to wrap up the letter as he is about to join the others in burning down the neighboring camp lodge. The Dutch version Brief uit la Courtine sung by Rijk de Gooyer is not about a children's summer camp, but about a soldier in the Dutch army camp at La Courtine, France. The Austrian comedian Paul Pizzera presented a German interpretation with the name “Jungscharlager” in 2013.

The primate of the church carries the title of Metropolitan of Riga and all Latvia (; , Mitropolit Rizhskiy i vseya Latvii). This position has been occupied since October 27, 1990 by metropolitan Aleksandrs Kudrjašovs. History Orthodoxy was planted in Latvia in the 11th century, when it became a mission field of the diocese of Polotsk. The country remained mostly pagan until it was conquered in the 13th century by the Catholic Teutonic Order. Prior to this, however, part of prominent Latgalian noblemen (e. g., Visvaldis, Vetseke) and a large part of Latgalian people, in general, had converted to Orthodoxy voluntarily. There were Orthodox churches in Jersika from the evidence of the Livonian Chronicle; many church-related words came into pre- Latvian languages in that time. An Orthodox presence continued after the Teutonic Order conquest at least officially, in the form of churches for Russian merchants and others, but these were small communities among a majority of Catholics before 1525 and Lutherans afterwards. After Latvia was annexed to the Russian Empire in the 18th century (most of Latvia, a result of the Great Northern War by the Treaty of Nystad, the Latgale region after the First Partition of Poland in 1772), Russian and Orthodox presence increased substantially, but the Orthodox Church remained foreign to the Latvians. The Latvian Orthodox Church as a body including ethnic Latvians as well as Russians dates back to the 1840s, when native Latvians (who were at that time subjects of the Russian Empire) petitioned Nicholas I of Russia to be allowed to conduct services in their native tongue. The Orthodox Church enjoyed some success in its missions among the Latvians due to its use of the Latvian language and by personal appeal of local Orthodox bishops who sought to support native Latvian inhabitants whose rights were limited by Baltic Germans. Homepage of Latvian Orthodox Church. History of Holy Orthodoxy in Latvia. http://pareizticiba.lv/index.php?newid=48&id;=34 In the 1880s the Orthodox Nativity Cathedral was built in Riga. However, it was always regarded suspiciously by the Lutheran Germanic nobles of the area; conversely the predominantly German character of the Lutheran Church in Latvia was a factor in the movement of some 40,000 Latvians from the Lutheran to the Orthodox Church. When religious freedom was proclaimed in 1905, about 12,000 Latvians moved from Orthodoxy to Lutheranism; in most cases, this seems to have occurred because of mixed marriages and the difficulties of maintaining a religiously divided family. The domes of Nativity Cathedral are a landmark of the Riga cityscape. During World War I, the property of the Orthodox Church in Latvia was confiscated by occupying German forces, and in the early years of independent Latvia the government was not eager to recognize the church, suspecting it of being a hotbed of pro-Russian monarchism. = Autonomy = In this difficult situation, Jānis (John) Pommers, a native Latvian, was appointed Archbishop of Riga in 1921. On July 6, 1921, the Russian Orthodox Church granted autonomy (limited self-governance) to the Orthodox Church in Latvia, thus creating the Latvian Orthodox Church (named \\"Archidiocese of Riga and all Latvia\\"). Pommers succeeded in winning recognition from the government by 1926 and, against much opposition from leftists and others, in stabilizing the situation of the church. While opposing the Bolsheviks, he maintained the Latvian Orthodox Church within the Moscow Patriarchate. In 1934, he was assassinated by Soviet agents (some believe these were agents of the nationalist dictator of Latvia, Kārlis Ulmanis). = Latvian Orthodox Church joins the Ecumenical Patriarchate = After the murder of the church's primate Archbishop John (Pommers) on 21 October 1934 and because of the political situation at that time, the Latvian Orthodox Church asked to come under the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. In February 1936, the Ecumenical Patriarchate accepted the request of the Latvian Orthodox Church: the Latvian Orthodox Church became an autonomous church under the Ecumenical Patriarchate, and the Ecumenical Patriarchate elevated the LOC from the rank of archidiocese to that of Metropolitanate; the LOC was then named \\"Metropolitanate of Riga and all Latvia\\". The subsequent five years were good years for the Latvian Orthodox Church, led by Metropolitan Augustin (Pētersons). Nevertheless, no churches were built during these years. = Soviet occupation period = The autonomy of the Latvian Orthodox Church was ended abruptly by the Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940, which was followed by the German Nazi occupation from 1941 to 1944, and a second Soviet annexation lasting from 1944 to 1991. The church suffered oppression during this period, as did organized religion throughout the Soviet Union, though this was partly mitigated from 1943 to 1948 (due to the support of the Church during World War II) and in the last years of the Soviet Union under Mikhail Gorbachev. On 24 February 1941, after the Soviet invasion of Latvia, the Russian Orthodox Church turned the territory of the Latvian Orthodox Church into an exarchate of the ROC which comprised the territories of Estonia and Latvia. Metropolitan Augustine of Riga and all Latvia, primate of the LOC, was summoned to Moscow where he was forced, on March 28, 1941, to sign a decree recognizing the situation. On 31 March 1941, the ROC officially abolished the autonomy of the Orthodox church of Latvia. = German occupation period = During the occupation of Latvia by Germany, Metropolitan Augustine on 20 July 1941 declared the reestablishment of the LOC. However, many parishes did not join Augustine, and the Germans were supporting the Russian exarchate. = Second Soviet occupation, exile and deactivation = In 1944, after the Soviet re-occupation of Latvia, Metropolitan Augustine and numerous members of the LOC were forced to go in exile in West Germany. There, a Synod in exile was created. The Ecumenical Patriarchate continued to recognize the LOC, even after Augustine's death. In April 1978, as result of pressures by the Russian Orthodox Church upon the Ecumenical Patriarchate, the latter declared the LOC of the Ecumenical Patriarchate inactive. = 1990s and after = The church also suffered oppression in the last years of the Soviet Union under Mikhail Gorbachev. In December 1992, the Latvian Orthodox Church was again proclaimed autonomous, preserving canonical ties with the Russian Orthodox Church. In 2001, a council of the Latvian Orthodox Church canonised Archbishop Jānis in recognition of his martyrdom in 1934. In 2006, the \\"Order of the holy martyr Jānis\\" was instituted to reward those who have served the Orthodox Church and its aims. In modern Latvia, there are 350,000 Orthodox Church members. The services are in Church Slavonic and the members are predominantly Russian speakers. Ethnic Latvians are a minority among church members; there are parishes with services in Latvian in Riga, Ainaži, Kolka, Veclaicene and in other places. Other Orthodox Christian groups in Latvia Besides the Patriarchate-affiliated church, Latvia has a number of Old Believer Orthodox Christian communities as well. The priestless congregation of the Grebenstchikov House of Prayer in Riga, affiliated with the Pomorian Old-Orthodox Church, is considered the oldest extant Old Believer congregation in the world. The Latvian Orthodox Autonomous Church, a part of the Russian Orthodox Autonomous Church (True Orthodox), is also present in Latvia.

A breeder is usually a purebred animal, bred with the intent of producing purebred, or even show-quality animals. However, in some cases, a breeding animal is crossbred with another breed or a mixed breed with the intent of combining aspects of two or more different breeds. Purebred and registered animals If the breeding is for a purebred animal that will be used for exhibition or future breeding (pets or livestock), the animal must be registered and conform to the criteria laid out for that breed in a breed standard kept by a central authority, such as a kennel club for dogs. In addition, the breed club, kennel club, or other governing authority may have other restrictions on the type of animal that can be used for breeding to produce offspring that can be registered. For example, some equine societies allow backbred and crossbred individuals to be bred from; most dog clubs do not except in exceptional circumstances, by permission. Most kennel clubs allow any registered individual to be bred from; the individual breed club may have additional, stricter criteria. The Mini Foxie Club of Australia, Inc., for example, requires adult dogs to be classified before being certified eligible for breeding of purebred Miniature Fox Terriers. Some Jack Russell Terrier and Greater Swiss Mountain Dog clubs have similar requirements. Terminology In animal fancy, human breeders have specialized words for breeding animals in some species: (Please list only if different for the words for the male and female of the species.) *Cat: Stud (male) and queen (female) *Cattle: Bull (male) and heifer or cow (female) *Dog: Stud (male) and brood bitch (female) *Horse: Stallion (male) and mare (female) *Pigeon: cock (male) and hen (female) *Sheep: RamD’Arcy, J.B., Sheep Management & Wool Technology, NSW University Press, 1986, (male) and ewe (female) *Goat: Buck (male) and doe (female) *Guinea pig: Boar (male) sow (female) *Rabbit: Buck (male) Doe (female) These should not be confused with the words for the parents of offspring (i.e. sire and dam) or with the words for male and female of the species (i.e. dog and bitch).

It was compiled into novel/book form in 1925. While it pioneered many ideas found in later science fiction, it has been critically panned for its \\"inept writing\\". The title itself is a play on words ( 1 2 4 C 4 1 + ), meaning \\"One to foresee for one another\\". In the introduction to the first volume of Science-Fiction Plus, dated March 1953, Gernsback called for patent reform to give science fiction authors the right to create patents for ideas without having patent models because many of their ideas predated the technical progress needed to develop specifications for their ideas. The introduction referenced the numerous prescient technologies described throughout Ralph 124C 41+. Plot summary The eponymous protagonist saves the life of the heroine by directing energy remotely at an approaching avalanche. As the novel goes on, he describes the technological wonders of the modern world, frequently using the phrase \\"As you know...\\" The hero finally rescues the heroine by travelling into space on his own \\"space flyer\\" to rescue her from the villain's clutches. Predictions =Accurate= Some successful predictions from this novel include television (and channel surfing), remote-control power transmission, the videophone, transcontinental air service, solar energy in practical use, sound movies, synthetic milk and foods, artificial cloth, voiceprinting, tape recorders, and spaceflight. It also contains \\"...the first accurate description of radar, complete with diagram...\\", according to Arthur C. Clarke in his \\"non-genre\\" novel Glide Path (1963). :\\"A pulsating polarized ether wave, if directed on a metal object can be reflected in the same manner as a light-ray is reflected from a bright surface or from a mirror...\\" =Inaccurate= Inevitably, some of the science predictions made in the story turned out to be wrong. For example, in 1911 it was commonly assumed that, just as a sound wave needed a medium to travel in, so did a light wave. Ether was postulated as the unknown substance that light traveled in. In the story an ether vacuum occurred when too much energy was radiated at once. Radiation caused more ether to be drawn to an area of energy expenditure and the lack of ether resulting from this overusage caused a temporary blackout because light could not travel where there was no ether. Heat and cold could also not be transferred during such a blackout. It is now known that such ether does not exist and is not needed for light to travel. Such effects are impossible.  Influence and critical reception  Even though Ralph 124C 41+ has been described as pioneering many of the tropes and ideas found in later science fiction works,The Mechanics of Wonder: The Creation of the Idea of Science Fiction by Gary Westfahl, Liverpool University Press, 1999, page 135. it has largely been neglected due to what critics often describe as poor artistic quality.Magill's Guide to Science Fiction and Fantasy Literature Volume 3: Lest Darkness Fall by T. A. Shippey and A. J. Sobczak, Salem Press, 1996, page 767. Brian Aldiss has called the story a \\"tawdry illiterate tale\\" and a \\"sorry concoction\\" while Lester del Rey called it \\"simply dreadful\\".The Mechanics of Wonder: The Creation of the Idea of Science Fiction by Gary Westfahl, Liverpool University Press, 1999, page 92.

Duarte was born in Sheffield, England, but lived in Manchester from the age of six. Although his surname is of Portuguese origin, he considered himself 100% British – his father was Scottish and his mother was English – a fact that echoed throughout his music. Career Duarte was educated at Manchester Central High School (1931–35) and Manchester University Faculty of Technology (1936–40). He worked as a professional chemist until 1969, then abandoned chemistry in favour of full-time dedication to music, after having been persuaded by Len Williams, father of John Williams. His only formal musical education consisted in jazz guitar lessons with Terence \\"Terry\\" Usher (1934–6); the rest he learned by self-instruction. He also worked professionally as a player of the trumpet and double bass, performing music of many kinds, and regularly worked as a jazz musician until 1953, among others in the company of Coleman Hawkins and Django Reinhardt.John W. Duarte obituary, in: [London] Times, 31 December 2004. No cause of death in this obituary (accessed 2 October 2011). Duarte taught at the London-based Spanish Guitar Centre, which Williams senior had founded and where the young John Williams studied with him for a period of three years before entering the Royal College of Music.Duarte, John W.: Andrés Segovia, As I Knew Him (Pacific, MO: Mel Bay, 1998), p. 19. Williams acknowledged the early influence of Duarte by including his transcriptions of cello suites by Bach in his first recordings, along with Variations on a Catalan Folk Song, Op. 25, one of the most enduring and most recorded of Duarte's compositions.Colin Cooper: \\"John Duarte, Prolific composer for the guitar\\" [obituary], in: The Independent, 31 January 2005, online (accessed 21 July 2015). He sustained several lasting friendships with great musicians, including a 39-year-long relationship with Andrés Segovia and another with Ida Presti, who died prematurely at the age of 42. Duarte also wrote a memoir of his relationship with Andres Segovia, Andrés Segovia, As I Knew Him (1998).. For Presti and her husband Alexandre Lagoya, Duarte wrote Variations on a French Nursery Song, Op. 32 (\\"J'ai du bon tabac\\"), a difficult work that tested even that legendary duo's abilities.Cooper (2005), as above. As late as 1985, Duarte wrote a piece in Ida Presti's memory, Idylle pour Ida, Op. 93, for guitar solo.Published by Universal Edition (Australia), plate no. UE 29176 A. John W. Duarte died on 23 December 2004. He was survived by his wife, Dorothy, whom he married in 1943, and by two sons and a daughter. Music Duarte was the composer of nearly 150 works for the guitar and lute (many commissioned with funds provided by the Arts Council of Great Britain and other sources). Most have been published and many have been commercially recorded, some several times. He also made many arrangements (several also recorded), and wrote a number of didactic works, including an introduction to harmony for guitarists. His music shows an exceptionally wide range of styles. Duarte's English Suite, Op. 31, a three- movement work for guitar, reflects the Renaissance style of court lutenists such as John Dowland and John Johnson. Dreams, Op. 91, written for the Amsterdam Guitar Trio alternates in style between aleatory, atonal and graphic, contained within a conventionally notated framework and allowing spontaneous reaction between the performers. In many other works he employs a tonal language, often coloured by the folk music traditions of various nations, and romantic in mood. \\"This versatility puzzled some commentators, who found difficulty in perceiving the true Duarte. But this was, in fact, the true Duarte, never easy to categorise, always unpredictable, his agile and fertile mind able and willing to leap without apparent effort from one area of music to another.\\" (Colin Cooper in Duarte's obituary in The Independent; see 'External links'). Articles and publications Duarte was a regular contributor to the magazine Soundboard, an interviewer, and a reviewer of books, music, concerts and recordings of many kinds (specializing in Baroque music) with Gramophone, Music Teacher and Classical Guitar, and the author of numerous concert programme notes and about 250 liner notes for records of various kinds, including those for the complete reissue of Julian Bream's recordings for RCA (28 compact discs). He received a Grammy Award for his annotation to the reissue of Segovia's recordings of 1927-39. He contributed regularly to Music in Education, Guitar Review, Guitar International, Music & Musicians, Records and Recording, and Performance, and contributed to the revised edition of The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians (London: Macmillan, 2001).

Early life and education Maria Louisa Bustill (sometimes called Louisa as a child) was born in 1853 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, of Igbo, Lenni-Lenape Native American, and Anglo-American descent. Her parents were Charles Hicks Bustill and Emily Robinson, prominent black Quakers. In the 1870s, Louisa attended Lincoln University, a historically black university in Oxford, Pennsylvania. She was already a teacher when she met William Drew Robeson. Both she and her sister Gertrude married men who were Lincoln graduates, but her family thought Louisa had \\"married down\\" by choosing Robeson. Marriage and family Bustill's ancestors had been free since the mid-1700s, when her great-grandfather Cyrus Bustill was freed after several years of service to a new owner in Burlington, New Jersey. He moved into Philadelphia where he built a business as a baker. Cyrus Bustill became one of the founders in Philadelphia of the Free African Society in 1787. Other family had genealogical records going back to the early days of the Pennsylvania colony.Sheila Tully Boyle, Andrew Bunie, Paul Robeson: The Years of Promise And Achievement, University of Massachusetts Press, 2005, p. 10 Louisa Bustill met William Drew Robeson I (1845-1918) when he was a student at Lincoln University. She was already teaching at the Robert Vaux School for black children. Robeson had escaped slavery in North Carolina and come north with his brother Ezekiel at age 15, and worked for the Union Army during the American Civil War. Louisa married Robeson in 1878, after he completed his undergraduate degree and one in theology. They had seven children together; two died in infancy and five lived to adulthood. Louisa taught school and work as a tutor while her husband was the Presbyterian minister of the Witherspoon Church in Princeton, New Jersey. The city had a relatively large black community, about 18% by the turn of the 20th century. It included both families who had long been free, like Louisa's, and persons who were born in slavery. The town had many Southern ties, and residential segregation was enforced. Both the Robesons emphasized education and advancement for their children. Their first daughter, Gertrude Lascet Robeson (1880-1880), died as an infant. It was an upwardly mobile family; all but one of their sons were highly successful as adults, with two having professional careers: Dr. William Drew Robeson, Jr., M.D. (1881-1925) was a physician in Washington, DC; Marian M. Robeson (1894-1977) married Dr. William Forsythe, M.D. and they moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Benjamin C. Robeson (1893-1963), was a minister at the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church in Harlem, New York City; John Bunyan Reeve Robeson (1886-1973) aka Reed Robeson, moved to Detroit, where he worked as a laborer and may have worked at a hotel, then again moved to Sioux City, Iowa where he died in poverty. The youngest surviving child, Paul LeRoy Robeson, better known as Paul Robeson (1898-1976), became an internationally known athlete, orator, singer and actor. He also became an activist for civil rights. Another child died at birth, but the name is not known. Death and burial By 1904 Louisa was nearly blind from cataracts. She was severely burned in a kitchen accident when an ember from the stove ignited her clothes. She died several days later with burns over 80% of her body. She was buried in Princeton Cemetery.

Geekcorps had an understanding with local businesses, after receiving help, the businesses involved were to help the locals with their newfound resources. Initial challenges for Geekcorps were communication and teaching skills needed by volunteers, and reliance on outdated programming languages for local businesses. Geekcorps involvement led to innovations such as a new java based payment system for local businesses in Ghana. Geekcorps was also instrumental in the creation of Ghana's internet exchange point in 2005. = Mali = Initial assistance in Mali came from the CMRT (Community Mobilization through Radio Technology) program sponsored by USAID. Under CMRT, Geekcorps installed 5 radio stations to enable local communication through the area. Later under another program Radio for Peace Building, Geekcorps installed another 11 stations, and renovations were done to older existing stations. Geekcorps set up ICT stations in less populated areas of Mali in 2006. These stations were updated by a memory stick delivered from a computer center with internet access in Ouelessebougou. Although this allowed many rural locations access to specific web resources, such as web pages and digital media, due to lack of interest the program was modified after a year.

Life  =Archduchess of Austria= Born in Graz, she was the fifth child and second, but oldest surviving, daughter of Archduke Ferdinand of Inner Austria by his first wife Maria Anna, a daughter of William V, Duke of Bavaria. She was probably named after her mother, who died in 1616. Maria Anna, who had a particular fondness for hunting, received a strict Jesuit upbringingFriedrich Anton Wilhelm Schreiber: Maximilian I. der Katholische, Kurfürst von Bayern und der dreißigjährige Krieg, Fleischmann, 1868, p. 707. and was considered a great beauty with exceptional virtues, such as prudence, orderly life and stateliness. She also spoke fluent Italian in addition to her native German. In 1619 her father became Holy Roman Emperor and King of Bohemia and Hungary, an event that considerably raised her status. Two years later, in 1622, the now Emperor Ferdinand II married again, with Eleonora, daughter of Vincenzo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, with whom he had no children. =Marriage= On 15 July 1635 at the Augustinian Church, Vienna, Maria Anna married her uncle, Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria, whose previous wife, Elisabeth of Lorraine, had died a few months earlier. The wedding was celebrated by Franz von Dietrichstein, Bishop of Olomouc. In the marriage contract, which was signed two days later on 17 July, the Emperor made the exceptional stipulation that Maria Anna would not renounce her rights over the Habsburg inheritance (Erbverzicht) as was customary for Austrian Archduchesses when they married foreign princes; this was made probably by Ferdinand II with the intention to secure the rights of his eldest daughter in the case of the extinction of his male descendants. As a dowry, Maria Anna received the amount of 250,000 florins secured from Wasserburg Castle and the districts of Kraiburg and Neumarkt. As a widow's seat she received Trausnitz Castle in Landshut. With this union, the Bavarian Elector not only gained the opportunity to sire the long-waited heir (his first marriage was childless) but also to demonstrate his alliance with the Holy Roman Empire against France, which was prepared for an imminent war. However, this connection only played a minor role in the relations between Austria and Bavaria later. =Electress of Bavaria= Maximilian I. The marriage was very happy and Maximilian I cared for his wife lovingly. During Maria Anna's first pregnancy, the Electoral couple made a pilgrimage to Andechs to pray for a happy birth. On 31 October 1636, the Electress gave birth to her first son, who was named Ferdinand Maria after his grandfather Ferdinand II, who also acted as godfather for the child. The childbirth proved to be extremely difficult for Maria Anna; she became so weak that she lost her ability to speak. Her healing was attributed to the help of the relics of Saint Francis of Paola, so Maximilian I founded in Neunburg vorm Wald a monastery consecrated to him. Almost two years later, on 30 September 1638, the Electress gave birth a second son, Maximilian Philipp Hieronymus. Maria Anna assisted her husband in government affairs and showed interest in the politics of the Bavarian Electorate; she even took part in the meetings of the Council of Ministers.Friedrich Anton Wilhelm Schreiber: Maximilian I. der Katholische, Kurfürst von Bayern und der dreißigjährige Krieg, Fleischmann, 1868, p. 902. Despite her Habsburg origins (she had an extensive correspondence with her brother Ferdinand III and other relatives), she was completely dedicated to the Bavarian viewpoint. In addition, she conducted lively exchanges of opinion with high officials of the Munich. After the conquest of Philipsburg fortress by the French in 1644, Maria Anna urged her brother Leopold Wilhelm, on behalf of her husband, to enter into peace negotiations. (Archduke Leopold Wilhelm had been commander of the Imperial army since 1639.) Shortly before his death in 1650, Maximilian I had a Treuherzige Information (Trust information) written for his wife to give her guidance for her upcoming regency.Linda Maria Koldau: Frauen-Musik-Kultur, Böhlau Verlag Köln Weimar, 2005, p. 228. =Regent of the Electorate of Bavaria= When Maximilian I wrote his will in 1641, Maria Anna claimed in this for the eventual reign of her son, a co-signature law in national matters. However, the Office of the Administrator in Bavaria and Saxony claimed that according to the Golden Bull women were excluded from government. She consulted an expertise commission without her husband's knowledge and secured a favorable ruling concerning her rights added in Maximilian I's will. Thus, after Maximilian I's death (27 September 1651) his brother Albert VI, Duke of Bavaria legally became the regent for Ferdinand Maria and was confirmed in that position in both Imperial and Electoral courts. Maria Anna assumed full responsibility for the Department of Justice and other country administrative tasks, however, which virtually left the Dowager Electress ruler of Bavaria. In addition to Albert VI and the Dowager Electress, the Hofkammerpräsident Mändl belonged to the administration that continued to work with the young Elector when he attained his majority in 1654.C. Arnold: Grundriß der bayerischen Geschichte, Jaquet, 1853, p. 99. In 1664 Maria Anna, who remained a close advisor to her son even after the end of her regency, suggested putting the country under the patronage of St. Joseph.Petr Maťa, Thomas Winkelbauer: Die Habsburgermonarchie 1620 bis 1740, Franz Steiner Verlag, 2006, p. 263.

The name was coined by Mrs. Radcliffe in her book ‘Tour of the Lakes’.Farrer and Brownbill, 1914, The Victoria History of the County of Lancashire, Vol. 8, p.276. In the 14th century Augustinian canons from nearby Conishead Priory built a small chapel on the island to serve the needs of travellers and fishermen working in the Leven fisheries. The Island lies on the path of the ancient crossing from Cartmel to Conishead and would have been a place of haven to travellers caught out by the tide. Tradition describes its purpose to be the meeting for prayers with the travellers who cross the bay. In 1843 Jopling notes that the crossing passed to the south of the island, implying that the route past the island varied over time.William Jopling Nothing remains of the original chapel, although Thomas West noted that these ruins were still extant in 1774.Thomas West In 1821 Colonel Thomas Richard Gale Braddyll commenced building the modern-day Conishead Priory and to enhance the view from the priory he had a mock pseudo-classical ruin built on the island. This chapel ruin is now sometimes mistaken for the remains of the original. There was also a cottage on the island, probably also built in the early 19th century, which was ostensibly occupied by fishermen. It is mentioned that fishermen occupy the cottage ‘at the instance of the owner of the Priory who has erected a cottage close to the ruins. In 1851 the cottage was occupied by Thomas Benson, a mariner, his wife and stepson.1851 English Census: Class:HO107/Piece:2274/Folio:389/Page:12 By 1861 Edward Barker, his wife and three sons, all the men being fishermen, were the occupiers.1861 English Census: Class:RG9/Piece:3167/Folio:25/Page: 15 The 1871 Census shows that only the sons were resident and they were no longer fishermen, now occupied as quarrymen.1871 English Census: Class:RG10/Piece:4240/Folio:26/Page: 18 It is probable that they were employed at the quarry on the Conishead estate. The 1881 had no entry for Chapel island so it is possible that they were the last occupants of the cottage, which is now a ruin. In 1837 Chapel Island was proposed as a railway station by George Stephenson who was considering alternatives to the hilly route over Shap Fell, which the main West Coast line to Glasgow now takes. His idea was to take the railway from Lancaster to Morecambe (then known as Poulton), before proceeding across the sands to Humphrey Head on the Cartmell Peninsular and then cross the Leven Estuary to Furness. Embankments would have been built on the sands, with the area inside of these reclaimed.No Boat Required – Exploring Tidal Islands, Peter Caton, 2011, Troubador Publishing, On 6 October 1858 the sloop Delight of Ulverston grounded on the rocks of Chapel Island. She was carrying a cargo of iron ore and empties. Her master was lost in the accident. Chapel Island is referred to by William Wordsworth in The Prelude, Book Tenth. The penultimate paragraph of the books reads: Excellent beaches can be found at Chapel Island. Apart from a small area at the north of the island the land is completely overgrown with an impenetrable mat of brambles. The island can be accessed on foot at low tide. However, Morecambe Bay is notorious for quicksands, and the Ulverston Channel usually flows between the shore and the island. Those wishing to visit Chapel Island should not attempt the crossing at any time other than low tide and should seek local advice.

DehKhoda, \\"Lughat Nameh DehKhoda\\" Khorasan comprised the present territories of northeastern Iran, parts of Afghanistan and much of Central Asia. The province was often subdivided into four quarters. Nishapur (present-day Iran), Marv (present-day Turkmenistan), Herat and Balkh (present-day Afghanistan) were the centers, respectively, of the westernmost, northernmost, southernmost, and easternmost quarters.Minorsky, V. (1938). \\"Geographical Factors in Persian Art\\". Bulletin of the School of Oriental Studies, University of London, 9(3), 621-652. In the north, Khorasan stretched as far as the Oxus, and according to some descriptions, included Transoxiana (Bukhara and Samarqand in present-day Uzbekistan). Along the north it extended westward to the Caspian coast. Early Islamic usage often regarded everywhere east of so-called Jibal or what was subsequently termed \\"Iraq Ajami\\" (Persian Iraq), as being included in a vast and loosely-defined region of Khorasan, which might even extend to the Indus Valley and Sindh. The boundary between these two was the region surrounding the cities of Gurgan and Qumis. In particular, the Ghaznavids, Seljuqs and Timurids divided their empires into 'Iraqi' and 'Khorasani' regions. Khorasan is believed to have been bounded in the southwest by desert and the town of Tabas, known as \\"the Gate of Khorasan\\",Sykes, P. (1906). A Fifth Journey in Persia (Continued). The Geographical Journal, 28(6), 560-587. from which it extended eastward to the mountains of central Afghanistan. Sources from the 10th-century onwards refer to areas in the south of the Hindu Kush as the Khorasan Marches, forming a frontier region between Khorasan and Hindustan. Greater Khorasan is today sometimes used to distinguish the larger historical region from the modern Khorasan Province of Iran (1906-2004), which roughly encompassed the western half of the historical Greater Khorasan.Dabeersiaghi, Commentary on Safarnâma-e Nâsir Khusraw, 6th Ed. Tehran, Zavvâr: 1375 (Solar Hijri Calendar) 235–236  Geography  A map of Persia by Emanuel Bowen showing the names of territories during the Persian Safavid dynasty and Mughal Empire of India (ca. 1500–1747) First established in the 6th-century as one of four administrative (military) divisions by the Sassanids, the scope of the region has varied considerably during its nearly 1,500-year history. Initially, the Khorasan division of the Sassanid empire covered the north-eastern military gains of the empire, at its height including cities such as Nishapur, Herat, Merv, Faryab, Talaqan (around modern Turkmenabat), Balkh, Bukhara, Badghis, Abiward, Gharjistan, Tus, Sarakhs and Gurgan. With the rise of the Umayyad Caliphate, the designation was inherited and likewise stretched as far as their military gains in the east, starting off with the military installations at Nishapur and Merv, slowly expanding eastwards into Tokharistan and Sogdia. Under the Caliphs, Khorasan was the name of one of the three political zones under their dominion (the other two being Eraq-e Arab \\"Arabic Iraq\\" and Eraq-e Ajam \\"Non- Arabic Iraq or Persian Iraq\\"). Under the Umayyad and Abbasid caliphates, Khorasan was divided into four major sections or quarters (rub′), each section based on a single major city: Nishapur, Merv, Herat and Balkh.DehKhoda, \\"Lughat Nameh DehKhoda\\" By the 10th-century, Ibn Khordadbeh and the Hudud al-'Alam mentions what roughly encompasses the previous regions of Abarshahr, Tokharistan and Sogdia as Khwarasan proper. They further report the southern part of the Hindu Kush, i.e. the regions of Sistan, Ghor, Rukhkhudh, Zabulistan and Kabul etc. to make up the Khwarasan marches, a frontier region between Khwarasan and Hindustan which at the time would have been in a process of Islamization. By the late Middle Ages, the term lost its administrative significance, in the west only being loosely applied among the Turko-Persian dynasties of modern Iran to all its territories that lay east and north-east of the Dasht-e Kavir desert. It was therefore subjected to constant change, as the size of their empires changed. In the east, Khwarasan likewise became a term associated with the great urban centers of Central Asia. It is mentioned in the Memoirs of Babur that: In modern times, the term has been source of great nostalgia and nationalism, especially amongst the Tajiks of Central Asia. Many Tajiks regard Khorasan as an integral part of their national myth, which has preserved an interest in the term, including its meaning and cultural significance, both in common discussion and academia, despite its falling out of political use in the region. According to Ghulam Mohammad Ghobar, Afghanistan's current Persian-speaking territories formed the major portion of Khorasān,Ghubar, Mir Ghulam Mohammad (1937). Khorasan, Kabul Printing House. Kabul, Afghanistan. as two of the four main capitals of Khorasān (Herat and Balkh) are now located in Afghanistan. Ghobar uses the terms \\"Proper Khorasan\\" and \\"Improper Khorasan\\" in his book to distinguish between the usage of Khorasān in its strict sense and its usage in a loose sense. According to him, Proper Khorasan contained regions lying between Balkh in the east, Merv in the north, Sistan in the south, Nishapur in the west and Herat, known as the Pearl of Khorasan, in the center. Improper Khorasan's boundaries extended to as far as Hazarajat and Kabul in the east, Baluchistan in the south, Transoxiana and Khwarezm in the north, and Damghan and Gorgan in the west.  History  Before the region fell to Alexander the Great in 330 BC, it was part of the Persian Achaemenid Empire and prior to that it was occupied by the Medes. The land that became known as Khorasan in geography of Eratosthenes was recognized as Ariana by Greeks at that time, which made up Greater Iran or the land where Zoroastrianism was the dominant religion. The southeastern region of Khorasan fell to the Kushan Empire in the 1st century AD. The Kushan rulers built a capital in modern-day Afghanistan at Bagram and are believed to have built the famous Buddhas of Bamiyan. Numerous Buddhist temples and buried cities have been found in Afghanistan. However, the region of Khorasan remained predominantly Zoroastrian but there were also Manichaeists, sun worshippers, Christians, Pagans, Shamanists, Buddhists, Jews, Hindus and others. One of the three great fire-temples of the Sassanids \\"Azar-burzin Mehr\\" is situated near Sabzevar in Iran. The boundary of the region began changing until the Kushans and Sassanids merged to form the Kushano-Sassanian civilization. An early turquoise mine in the Madan village of Khorasan during the early 20th century = Sasanian era = During the Sasanian era, likely in the reign of Khusrow I, Persia was divided into four regions (known as kust Middle Persian), Khwārvarān in the west, apāxtar in the north, nīmrūz in the south and Khurasan in the east. Since the Sasanian territories were more or less remained stable up to Islamic conquests, it can be concluded that Sasanian Khorasan was bordered to the south by Sistan and Kerman, to the west by the central deserts of modern Iran, and to the east by China and India. In Sasanian era, Khurasan was further divided into four smaller regions, and each region was ruled by a marzban. These four regions were Nishapur, Marv, Herat and Balkh. Khorasan in the east saw some conflict with the Hephthalites who became the new rulers in the area but the borders remained stable. Being the eastern parts of the Sassanids and further away from Arabia, Khorasan region was conquered after the remaining Persia. The last Sassanid king of Persia, Yazdgerd III, moved the throne to Khorasan following the Arab invasion in the western parts of the empire. After the assassination of the king, Khorasan was conquered by Arab Muslims in 647 AD. Like other provinces of Persia it became a province of the Umayyad Caliphate. The village of Meyamei in 1909 = Arab conquest = The first movement against the Arab conquest was led by Abu Muslim Khorasani between 747 and 750. He helped the Abbasids come to power but was later killed by Al-Mansur, an Abbasid Caliph. The first kingdom independent from Arab rule was established in Khorasan by Tahir Phoshanji in 821, but it seems that it was more a matter of political and territorial gain. Tahir had helped the Caliph subdue other nationalistic movements in other parts of Persia such as Maziar's movement in Tabaristan. Other major independent dynasties who ruled over Khorasan were the Saffarids from Zaranj (861–1003), Samanids from Bukhara (875–999), Ghaznavids from Ghazni (963–1167), Seljuqs (1037–1194), Khwarezmids (1077–1231), Ghurids (1149–1212), and Timurids (1370–1506). Some of these dynasties were not Persian by ethnicity. The periods of Turkic Ghaznavids and Turco-Mongol Timurids are considered as some of the most brilliant eras of Khorasan's history. During these periods, there was a great cultural awakening. Many famous poets, scientists and scholars lived in this area. Numerous valuable works in Persian literature were written. Between the early 16th and early 18th centuries, parts of Khorasan were contested between the Safavids and the Uzbeks. A part of the Khorasan region was conquered in 1722 by the Ghilji Pashtuns from Kandahar and became part of the Hotaki dynasty from 1722 to 1729. Nader Shah recaptured Khorasan in 1729 and chose Mashhad as the capital of Persia. Following his assassination in 1747, the eastern parts of Khorasan, including Herat was annexed with the Durrani Empire. Mashhad area was under control of Nader Shah's grandson Shahrukh Afshar until it was captured by the Qajar dynasty in 1796. In 1856, the Iranians, under the Qajar dynasty, briefly recaptured Herat; by the Treaty of Paris of 1857, signed between Iran and the British Empire to end the Anglo-Persian War, the Iranian troops withdrew from Herat. Later, in 1881, Iran relinquished its claims to a part of the northern areas of Khorasan to the Russian Empire, principally comprising Merv, by the Treaty of Akhal (also known as the Treaty of Akhal-Khorasan).  Cultural importance  Timurid conqueror Babur exiles his treacherous relative Muḥammad Ḥusaym Mīrzā to Khorasan. Khorasan has had a great cultural importance among other regions in Greater Iran. The literary New Persian language developed in Khorasan and Transoxiana and gradually supplanted the Parthian language. The New Persian literature arose and flourished in Khorasan and TransoxianaFrye, R.N., \\"Dari\\", The Encyclopaedia of Islam, CD edition where the early Iranian dynasties such as Tahirids, Samanids, Saffirids and Ghaznavids (a Turco- Persian dynasty) were based. The early Persian poets such as Rudaki, Shahid Balkhi, Abu al-Abbas Marwazi, Abu Hafas Sughdi, and others were from Khorasan. Moreover, Ferdowsi and Rumi were also from Khorasan. Until the devastating Mongol invasion of the thirteenth century, Khorasan remained the cultural capital of Persia.Lorentz, J. Historical Dictionary of Iran. 1995 It has produced scientists such as Avicenna, Al-Farabi, Al-Biruni, Omar Khayyam, Al- Khwarizmi, Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi (known as Albumasar or Albuxar in the west), Alfraganus, Abu Wafa, Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, Sharaf al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī, and many others who are widely well known for their significant contributions in various domains such as mathematics, astronomy, medicine, physics, geography, and geology. Khorasan artisans contributed to the spread of technology and goods along the ancient trade routes have been traced to this ancient culture, including art objects, textiles and zoomorphic metalworks. Decorative antecedents of the famous \\"singing bowls\\" of Asia may have been invented in ancient Khorasan. In Islamic theology, jurisprudence and philosophy, and in Hadith collection, many of the greatest Islamic scholars came from Khorasan, namely Imam Bukhari, Imam Muslim, Abu Dawood, Al-Tirmidhi, Al-Nasa'i, Al- Ghazali, Al-Juwayni, Abu Mansur Maturidi, Fakhruddin al-Razi, and others. Shaykh Tusi, a Shi'a scholar and Al-Zamakhshari, the famous Mutazilite scholar, also lived in Khorasan.

She was one of the leading stars of the Gainsborough melodramas of the 1940s such as The Man in Grey (1943) and was one of the most popular movie stars in Britain in the 1940s. She continued acting until some 50 years later. In the words of one account: \\"Most of the time she drew what looked like the short straw, playing the 'good girl' in films that revelled in the exploits of her wicked opposite number, and it says much for her talent and charisma that she was able to hold attention in what must have seemed thankless parts – she herself acknowledged that 'I do think it is much more difficult to establish a really charming, nice person than a wicked one – and make it real'.\\" Biography Born in Chelsea, London, she trained at the Margaret Morris School of Dancing, and performed from the age of ten, performing with Ellen Terry in Crossings. She gained her first film role at the age of 12, in The Arcadians (1927), also known as The Land of Heart's Desire. Calvert performed in repertory theatre in Malvern and Coventry. She made her London stage debut in A Woman's Privilege in 1939. Her early films include Two Days to Live (1939). =Gainsborough Pictures= Calvert was spotted in a play Punch without Judy, and was signed to a contract by Gainsborough Pictures which gave her the lead in They Came by Night (1940), opposite Will Fyffe. She was George Formby's love interest in Let George Do It! (1940) and had a support part in Charley's (Big-Hearted) Aunt (1940), starring Arthur Askey. Calvert was in a war movie, Neutral Port (1940), then had a good role as Michael Redgrave's love interest in Kipps (1941), directed by Carol Reed. After a detective film Inspector Hornleigh Goes To It (1941) she had the co-lead in Uncensored (1942),a war movie with Eric Portman. Reed used her again in The Young Mr. Pitt (1942), playing Eleanor Eden. In 1942, she had the lead role as Patricia Graham in the West End production of Terence Rattigan's play Flare Path. =Stardom= Calvert was by now well established in British films. She did not become a star, however, until given one of the four leading roles in the Gainsborough melodrama The Man in Grey (1943). The movie was a huge success, making her and her three co-stars – Stewart Granger, James Mason and Margaret Lockwood – genuine box office stars in Britain. Calvert followed it with Fanny by Gaslight (1944), co-starring Granger and Mason, which was another big hit. Also popular was Two Thousand Women (1944), made by Launder and Gilliat, about British women interned in occupied France. It co-starred Patricia Roc, who appeared with Calvert and Granger in Madonna of the Seven Moons (1945), another Gainsborough melodrama, and another hit. Calvert's successful run at the box office continued when she and Mason were reunited in They Were Sisters (1945), a more contemporary-set Gainsborough melodrama. Exhibitors voted her the fifth-most popular star of 1945 in Britain. She was one of Stewart Granger's loves in The Magic Bow (1946) and had the female lead in a drama about colonialism in Africa Men of Two Worlds (1946), made a few years before being released. It was a success, though not profitable because of its high cost. The Root of All Evil (1947) was one of the last of the Gainsborough melodramas. She was voted the sixth most popular British star at the box office in 1946. =Hollywood= Calvert's success had been noticed in the US, although her films had not been as popular there. Universal signed her to star in Time Out of Mind (1947), which was a box office disappointment. She received several offers from studios and eventually decided to sign a six-picture deal with Paramount. She returned to Britain to make Broken Journey (1948) playing a role written especially for her, but the film failed at the box-office.Andrew Spicer, Sydney Box Manchester Uni Press 2006 p 210 Calvert went to Hollywood to make two films, both for Paramount: My Own True Love (1949), with Melvyn Douglas, and Appointment with Danger (1951 but made two years earlier) with Alan Ladd, in which she played a nun. She did Peter Pan on stage in Britain. =Producer= Back in Britain she made two films with director Ladislao Vajda, neither particularly successful: Golden Madonna (1950), shot in Italy, and The Woman with No Name (1950). She invested her own money in the latter. She wanted to produce other films: Eastward Ho, about an Englishwoman who romances a cowboy, and Equilibrium, about a trapeze artist, as well as star in a third film for Paramount but none of these were made. Calvert was in a thriller Mr. Denning Drives North (1951) with John Mills and a BBC TV production The Holly and the Ivy (1951). She had her first big hit in a while, Mandy (1952). Calvert was a wife in The Net (1953), then was off screen for a while. She acted on stage in It's Never Too Late (1956), then appeared in the film version. She followed it with Child in the House (1956). On TV she was in Strindberg's The Father for ITV's Television Playhouse, and played the lead in Tatiana, the Czar's Daughter. She also played Mrs March in a six-part BBC adaptation of Little Women. Calvert had a support part in the Hollywood-financed Indiscreet (1958), then played a concerned mother in The Young and the Guilty (1958) and a wacky spinster in A Lady Mislaid (1959). On TV she was in \\"The Break\\" for Armchair Theatre (1959) and played Katherine O'Shea in Parnell for Play of the Week (1959), then reprised her role as Mrs March for the BBC in Good Wives (1959). She was Constance Wilde in Oscar Wilde (1960) with Robert Morley and A Righteous Woman on Play of the Week (1962). =Later career= She acted in over 40 films, her later films including The Battle of the Villa Fiorita (1965), Twisted Nerve (1968), Oh! What a Lovely War and The Walking Stick (1970). From 1970 to 1972 she starred in her own TV series, Kate, playing the part of an agony aunt with problems of her own. She made TV appearances in programmes such as Crown Court, Ladykillers, Tales of the Unexpected, Boon, After Henry, ’Victoria Wood’ and Limelight: The Film Years – The Lime Grove Story. She also played D.I. Barnaby's Aunt Alice (Alice Bly) in a Midsomer Murders episode \\"Blue Herrings\\" in 2000. She was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1972 when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews. Personal life She was married to the actor and antiquarian bookseller Peter Murray-Hill, with whom she had two children, Ann Auriol (born 1943) and Piers Auriol (born 1954). She died in her sleep in London in 2002, from natural causes, aged 87.

For a period of time, it held a place in the Guinness Book of Records as the largest outdoor \\"rock concert\\" in history, with figures varying from 1 to 1.5 million in attendance. Rendez-vous Houston is remembered for being the concert which celebrated the astronauts of the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, which had happened only two and a half months earlier. One of Jarre's friends, astronaut Ron McNair, had been killed in the disaster. He was supposed to play the saxophone from space during the track \\"Last Rendez-Vous\\"; his substitute for the concert was Houston native Kirk Whalum. Planning and problems of the concert In 1985, Jarre was contacted by the musical director of the Houston Grand Opera with the proposal for him related to the celebrations of Texas' 150th birthday in 1986, 150th birthday of the city of Houston and NASA's 25th birthday. Because of NASA's involvement, Jarre got the chance to keep in contact with a friend of his, astronaut captain Bruce McCandless II who later introduced Jarre to a flight companion of his, astronaut and jazz musician Ron McNair. Together they had the idea that for the celebrations, Jarre would create a piece of music that could be performed by McNair on his saxophone. The idea was that McNair, on his next trip into space in the Challenger Space Shuttle, would perform and record onto video the new piece of music, which would then be projected through video playback onto a giant screen that was to be constructed on the front of one of the buildings. On January 28, 1986, McNair telephoned Jarre for the last time. \\"...Everything's ready. See you in a week's time. Watch me on TV for the takeoff!\\" Later that day, the Challenger Space Shuttle disintegrated in mid-air while on its ascent into space, killing McNair and the other six crew members onboard. Distraught by what had happened, Jarre almost decided to cancel the concert. However, astronauts from NASA (including Bruce McCandless) telephoned Jarre. They asked Jarre not to cancel the concert, and hold it in tribute to pay respect to the astronauts who had lost their lives in the disaster. The run-up to the concert itself still did not go smoothly. Rain poured down on Houston a couple of days before the concert, destroying much of the equipment on stage (which was repaired by the day of the concert), breaking wires and ruining instruments. Furthermore, there had been a very strong wind blowing all week, which ended up splitting open the giant projection screen (which was made from several small canvas panels) and causing it to come crashing down. The local police turned up during the middle of a rehearsal demanding immediate payment of a fine; the residents who lived nearby were complaining of excessive noise and were exhausted from their sleepless nights. Also, FBI officers threatened to put a stop to the whole proceedings because they were being deprived of electricity. thirty large lamps had been installed on top of FBI headquarters, and they were causing problems with their surveillance of Colonel Gaddafi, who was visiting the city at that time. There was still one more slight problem before the concert started. The chief of the Houston Fire Department, Robert Clayton, had told Francis Dreyfus, Jarre's manager, that the show must be cancelled. This was due to a change of the wind direction; the Chief was concerned that the crowd would be showered with firework debris. After some back-and-forth argument with Dreyfus, Clayton agreed that the concert could proceed on a 'see how it goes' term. During the concert (specifically, during the performance of \\"Equinoxe Part 5\\", from Equinoxe), the amount of fireworks being used and the direction of the wind did indeed cause debris to rain down on the audience, covering them in ash. Clayton frantically began to try to stop the proceedings, fearing that people would be injured. Although his fears were duly noted, the crowd took no notice of the ash falling onto them and carried on enjoying the concert proceedings. Video and Audio Release A 52 minute TV edit of the concert was produced for broadcast, later released on VHS tape. Only around 35 minutes (7 tracks) from the concert are included in the film, with the first 15 minutes consisting of documentary footage with background music of other tracks from the concert. No further video releases from the concert have taken place since. Two tracks from Houston appear on the live album -------, \\"Equinoxe Part 5\\" and \\"Equinoxe Part 7\\" (1997 edition only). The full radio broadcast from the concert is available on YouTube, as are various audience camcorder recordings of the concert.

IESC was founded in 1964 by David Rockefeller, States M. Mead III, Frank Pace, Sol Linowitz, and other American business leaders. IESC has worked in sub-Saharan Africa, Europe and Eurasia, Asia and the Near East, and Latin America and the Caribbean. Geekcorps is a division of IESC. IESC's stated mission is to improve living standards by strengthening private enterprise. Since its founding, IESC claims to have helped businesses create or save over 1.5 million jobs, with projects serviced by a combination of staff, consultants and volunteers. History David Rockefeller and President Johnson launch IESC in the White House Rose Garden in 1964 IESC's first board meeting took place on June 15, 1964, in Washington D.C. and included American business leaders including David Rockefeller; president of Chase Manhattan Bank; Ray R. Eppert: president of Burroughs Corporation; C. D. Jackson, senior vice president of Time, Inc.; John H. Johnson, president of Johnson Publishing; Dan A. Kimball, chairman of Aerojet; Sol M. Linowitz, chairman of Xerox Corporation; and William S. Paley, chairman of CBS. C.D. Jackson died in the opening days of his chairmanship of IESC and was replaced by Frank Pace. By 1965, IESC was operating in Thailand, where Raytheon executive Ray Ellis was assigned as management advisor to T. S. Lin, President of Tatung Engineering Company. When IESC celebrated its 20th anniversary in 1984, the organization was working in 74 developing countries. Since then the total number of IESC project countries has doubled to more than 130 countries. Practice areas IESC offers services in the areas of trade and competitiveness, financial services, tourism development, information and communications technology, capacity building, and health and business training services. Throughout its 50-year history, IESC has developed expertise in technical, managerial and professional assistance consulting; micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprise support; market development; institution strengthening; quality enhancement; grants management; health and human resources; public administration and policy; and conflict and post-conflict management. It often carries those activities out through training programs, workshops and seminars. Recent projects In 2010, Ambassador Thomas J. Miller took over as CEO for IESC. Under Miller's leadership, IESC's budget has grown from an initial $5 million in 2010 to $30 million in 2013. In 2011, IESC began a project to train 126 South Sudanese diplomatic officials and fully integrate South Sudan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs into the world of global diplomacy. In 2012, IESC won a $105 million award to support certain key sectors of the economy in Afghanistan, the organization's largest-ever award. The project is a collaboration between IESC and the Volunteers for Economic Growth Alliance (VEGA) and is called the Assistance in Building Afghanistan by Developing Enterprises (ABADE) Program. ABADE aims to enable Afghan entrepreneurs to grow successful businesses by providing technical assistance, business consulting, and facilitating public-private partnerships. In Lebanon, IESC administers the USAID-funded Lebanon Investment in Microfinance Program (LIM) program to help small business owners apply for micro-loans to expand their businesses. Established in May 2009, IESC's LIM program had awarded grants of over $8m to Lebanese microfinance institutions by October 2014, which in turn had disbursed a total value of over $27m across 12,00 micro loans. As a result, the program has supported nearly 19,000 jobs and created nearly 3,000 positions, of which around 45% have been filled by women. In Ethiopia, IESC has implemented six USAID programs since 2004 designed to increase exports, strengthen institutions, and promote access to finance. In Tunisia, IESC administers a project that helps local entrepreneurs tap international trade opportunities through an online platform. In Mali, volunteers from IESC's Geekcorps built or refurbished radio stations on the edges of the Saharan desert, helping to deliver internet access to remote parts of the country. In Morocco, IESC has implemented the Morocco Commercial Development Organization Support Program which seeks to assist commercial development organizations by facilitating access to capital and export markets. In Liberia, IESC implements the USAID's Liberia Investing for Business Expansion (IBEX) Program by providing advice, mentoring and facilitating bank loans for small- and medium-sized enterprises in the construction, agriculture, general merchandise, and trade sectors. IBEX is helping to raise funds and conduct crisis mitigation training to help local businesses to cope with the disruptive effects of the Ebola virus. In 2013, IESC began a project with the AARP and the Chinese government to deploy senior business executive leaders as volunteer experts to China. IESC celebrated its 50th anniversary at a reception in May 2014.

RICH detectors were first developed in the 1980s and are used in high energy elementary particle- , nuclear- and astro-physics experiments. This article outlines the origins and principles of the RICH detector, with brief examples of its different forms in modern physics experiments.  Ring-imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detector  = Origins = The ring-imaging detection technique was first proposed by Jacques Séguinot and Tom Ypsilantis, working at CERN in 1977. Their research and development, of high precision single- photon detectors and related optics, lay the foundations for the design and construction of the first large-scale Particle Physics RICH detectors, at CERN's OMEGA facility and LEP (Large Electron–Positron Collider) DELPHI experiment. = Principles = A ring-imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detector allows the identification of electrically charged subatomic particle types through the detection of the Cherenkov radiation emitted (as photons) by the particle in traversing a medium with refractive index n > 1. The identification is achieved by measurement of the angle of emission, \\\\theta_c , of the Cherenkov radiation, which is related to the charged particle's velocity v by :\\\\cos \\\\theta_c = \\\\frac{c}{nv} where c is the speed of light. Knowledge of the particle's momentum and direction (normally available from an associated momentum-spectrometer) allows a predicted v for each hypothesis of the particles type; using the known n of the RICH radiator gives a corresponding prediction of \\\\theta_c that can be compared to the \\\\theta_c of the detected Cherenkov photons, thus indicating the particle's identity (usually as a probability per particle type). A typical (simulated) distribution of \\\\theta_c vs momentum of the source particle, for single Cherenkov photons, produced in a gaseous radiator (n~1.0005, angular resolution~0.6mrad) is shown in the following figure: Cherenkov angle vs Momentum The different particle types follow distinct contours of constant mass, smeared by the effective angular resolution of the RICH detector; at higher momenta each particle emits a number of Cherenkov photons which, taken together, give a more precise measure of the average \\\\theta_c than does a single photon, allowing effective particle separation to extend beyond 100 GeV in this example. This particle identification is essential for the detailed understanding of the intrinsic physics of the structure and interactions of elementary particles. The essence of the ring-imaging method is to devise an optical system with single-photon detectors, that can isolate the Cherenkov photons that each particle emits, to form a single \\"ring image\\" from which an accurate \\\\theta_c can be determined. A polar plot of the Cherenkov angles of photons associated with a 22 GeV/c particle in a radiator with n=1.0005 is shown below; both pion and kaon are illustrated; protons are below Cherenkov threshold, c/nv > 1 , producing no radiation in this case (which would also be a very clear signal of particle type = proton, since fluctuations in the number of photons follow Poisson statistics about the expected mean, so that the probability of e.g. a 22 GeV/c kaon producing zero photons when ~12 were expected is very small; e−12 or 1 in 162755) The number of detected photons shown for each particle type is, for illustration purposes, the average for that type in a RICH having N_c ~ 25 (see below). The distribution in azimuth is random between 0 and 360 degrees; the distribution in \\\\theta_c is spread with RMS angular resolution ~ 0.6 milliradians. Cherenkov photons emitted by a 22 GeV/c pion or kaon Note that, because the points of emission of the photons can be at any place on the (normally straight line) trajectory of the particle through the radiator, the emerging photons fill a light-cone in space. In a RICH detector the photons within this light-cone pass through an optical system and impinge upon a position sensitive photon detector. With a suitably focusing optical system this allows reconstruction of a ring, similar to that above, the radius of which gives a measure of the Cherenkov emission angle \\\\theta_c . The resolving power of this method is illustrated by comparing the Cherenkov angle per photon, see the first plot above, with the mean Cherenkov angle per particle (averaged over all photons emitted by that particle) obtained by ring-imaging, shown below; the greatly enhanced separation between particle types is very clear: Mean Cherenkov angle per particle vs momentum This ability of a RICH system to successfully resolve different hypotheses for the particle type depends on two principal factors, which in turn depend upon the listed sub-factors; * The effective angular resolution per photon, \\\\sigma ** Chromatic dispersion in the radiator ( n varies with photon frequency) ** Aberrations in the optical system ** Position resolution of the photon detector * The maximum number of detected photons in the ring-image, N_c ** The length of radiator through which the particle travels ** Photon transmission through the radiator material ** Photon transmission through the optical system ** Quantum efficiency of the photon detectors \\\\sigma is a measure of the intrinsic optical precision of the RICH detector. N_c is a measure of the optical response of the RICH; it can be thought of as the limiting case of the number of actually detected photons produced by a particle who's velocity approaches that of light, averaged over all relevant particle trajectories in the RICH detector. The average number of Cherenkov photons detected, for a slower particle, of charge q (normally ±1), emitting photons at angle \\\\theta_c is then : N = \\\\dfrac{N_c q^2 \\\\sin^2(\\\\theta_c)}{1 - \\\\dfrac{1}{n^2}} and the precision with which the mean Cherenkov angle can be determined with these photons is approximately :\\\\sigma_m = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{\\\\sqrt{N}} to which the angular precision of the emitting particle's measured direction must be added in quadrature, if it is not negligible compared to \\\\sigma_m. Given the known momentum of the emitting particle and the refractive index of the radiator, the expected Cherenkov angle for each particle type can be predicted, and its difference from the observed mean Cherenkov angle calculated. Dividing this difference by \\\\sigma_m then gives a measure of the 'number of sigma' deviation of the hypothesis from the observation, which can be used in computing a probability or likelihood for each possible hypothesis. The following figure shows the 'number of sigma' deviation of the kaon hypothesis from a true pion ring image (π not k) and of the pion hypothesis from a true kaon ring image (k not π), as a function of momentum, for a RICH with n = 1.0005, N_c = 25, \\\\sigma = 0.64 milliradians; Pion-kaon separation Nsigma Also shown are the average number of detected photons from pions(Ngπ) or from kaons(Ngk). One can see that the RICH's ability to separate the two particle types exceeds 4-sigma everywhere between threshold and 80 GeV/c, finally dropping below 3-sigma at about 100 GeV. It is important to note that this result is for an 'ideal' detector, with homogeneous acceptance and efficiency, normal error distributions and zero background. No such detector exists, of course, and in a real experiment much more sophisticated procedures are actually used to account for those effects; position dependent acceptance and efficiency; non-Gaussian error distributions; non negligible and variable event-dependent backgrounds. In practice, for the multi-particle final states produced in a typical collider experiment, separation of kaons from other final state hadrons, mainly pions, is the most important purpose of the RICH. In that context the two most vital RICH functions, which maximise signal and minimise combinatorial backgrounds, are its ability to correctly identify a kaon as a kaon and its ability not to misidentify a pion as a kaon. The related probabilities, which are the usual measures of signal detection and background rejection in real data, are plotted below to show their variation with momentum (simulation with 10% random background); Kaon identification plot Note that the ~30% π → k misidentification rate at 100 GeV is, for the most part, due to the presence of 10% background hits (faking photons) in the simulated detector; the 3-sigma separation in the mean Cherenkov angle (shown in the 4th plot above) would, by itself, only account for about 6% misidentification. More detailed analyses of the above type, for operational RICH detectors, can be found in the published literature. For example, the LHCb experiment at the CERN LHC studies, amongst other B-meson decays, the particular process B0 → π+π−. The following figure shows, on the left, the π+π− mass distribution without RICH identification, where all particles are assumed to be π ; the B0 → π+π− signal of interest is the turquoise-dotted line and is completely swamped by background due to B and Λ decays involving kaons and protons, and combinatorial background from particles not associated with the B0 decay. LHCb RICH Btoππ On the right are the same data with RICH identification used to select only pions and reject kaons and protons; the B0 → π+π− signal is preserved but all kaon- and proton- related backgrounds are greatly reduced, so that the overall B0 signal/background has improved by a factor ~ 6, allowing much more precise measurement of the decay process. = RICH Types = focusing and proximity- imaging RICH designs Both focusing and proximity-focusing detectors are in use. In a focusing RICH detector, the photons are collected by a spherical mirror with focal length f and focused onto the photon detector placed at the focal plane. The result is a circle with a radius r = f\\\\theta_c, independent of the emission point along the particle's track (\\\\theta_c \\\\ll 1). This scheme is suitable for low refractive index radiators (i.e., gases) with their larger radiator length needed to create enough photons. In the more compact proximity-focusing design a thin radiator volume emits a cone of Cherenkov light which traverses a small distance, the proximity gap, and is detected on the photon detector plane. The image is a ring of light the radius of which is defined by the Cherenkov emission angle and the proximity gap. The ring thickness is mainly determined by the thickness of the radiator. An example of a proximity gap RICH detector is the High Momentum Particle Identification (HMPID), one of the detectors of ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment), which is one of the five experiments at the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) at CERN. DIRC detector In a DIRC (Detection of Internally Reflected Cherenkov light), another design of a RICH detector, light that is captured by total internal reflection inside the solid radiator reaches the light sensors at the detector perimeter, the precise rectangular cross section of the radiator preserving the angular information of the Cherenkov light cone. One example is the DIRC of the BaBar experiment at SLAC. LHCb detector The LHCb experiment on the Large Hadron Collider uses two RICH detectors for differentiating between pions and kaons. The first (RICH-1) is located immediately after the Vertex Locator (VELO) around the interaction point and is optimised for low-momentum particles and the second (RICH-2) is located after the magnet and particle- tracker layers and optimised for higher-momentum particles. AMS-02 The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer device AMS-02, recently mounted on the International Space Station uses a RICH detector in combination with other devices to analyze cosmic rays.

White label records are vinyl records with plain white labels attached. There are several variations each with a different purpose. Variations include test pressings, white label promos, and plain white labels. Test pressings, usually with test pressing written on the label, with catalogue number, artist and recording time or date, are the first vinyl discs made at the factory. They are produced in small quantities (usually under five copies) to evaluate the quality of the disc before mass production begins. In the U.S., the traditional term white label promo (often abbreviated as WLP) refers to a promotional pressing with a label that has mostly the same text and label logo/artwork as the commercial label, but with a white background instead of the color or artwork found on the commercial pressings. Plain white label promotional recordings were produced in larger quantities by bigger record labels, often containing a biography of the band, to distribute as demonstration discs (\\"demos\\") to music distributors, and radio stations in order to assess consumer opinion. Today, white labels discs are commonly used to promote new artists or upcoming albums by veteran artists. In some cases white labels are issued to conceal artist identities (examples of this include songs by Traci Lords and La Toya Jackson, whose record companies issued white labels so that DJs would have no pre-conceived notions about the music just by seeing who the artist was). Many dance music producers press copies of white labels in order to test crowd response in dance clubs to their own musical productions. Use of white labels in house music and hip hop Today, white labels are usually produced in small amounts (fewer than 300) by small record companies or DJs and are most popular with house music and hip-hop music DJs. In the early 1990s, hardcore techno and house artists created tracks in home or local studios and had five-hundred or a few thousand singles pressed on 12\\" white labels, which were easy to sell at dance music record stores. Steve Beckett of Warp Records recalls that \\"shops would take fifty white labels off you for five pounds each, no problem. Dance music was all imports, then people in Britain started doing it for themselves, and their tracks started to get better than the tunes in America.\\" Record labels like Warp, and Shut Up and Dance, were begun as white-label enterprises, providing cutting-edge dance music to pirate radio stations and music stores. Copyright and royalties Many white labels contain unauthorized remixes or tracks that are not yet licensed or released (also called \\"bootlegs\\"). White labels are referred to as \\"promos\\" (short for \\"promotional copies\\") that many top-name DJs receive and play weeks or months prior to the day of general release to the public. As artists using samples pay high fees for the privilege of such, they must be able to gauge the market potential of their tracks prior to approval. Recently, smaller promo services offer record companies a more economical means of distribution although these companies may not have the means to properly protect releases from illegal copying. The industry itself seems to be aware of this necessity and white labels are commonly accepted as a necessary evil within the industry, which has only prosecuted a small number of those artists using white labeled pressings of uncleared samples and compositions.

Unlike the candid \\"magicality\\" of its forebears, this Nanny's paranormal nature was less overt and only implied. The Nanny's young wards, and the audience, were left intentionally uncertain of the nature of Nanny's \\"powers\\", if any. The series starred Juliet Mills as Nanny Phoebe Figalilly, Richard Long as Professor Harold Everett, and in season 3 Elsa Lanchester in the recurring role of Aunt Henrietta. Figalilly was housekeeper for Professor Everett and nanny to his three children: Hal, the intellectual tinkerer, played by David Doremus; Butch, the middle child, played by Trent Lehman; and Prudence, the youngest, played by Kim Richards. Nanny was apparently psychic, and had regular flashes of what was often more than intuition (accented by a musical tinkling sound effect); she frequently knew who was at the door before the doorbell even rang. There was the vague suggestion that she may have been at least several hundred years old and more than human, which the children thought they discovered in an episode after they saw a photo of Phoebe that looked like it was taken a century earlier. On outings, Nanny wore a navy blue Inverness cape and cap that resembled a deerstalker; the program's opening titles showed animations of both. Midway through the first season Nanny and the kids restored a broken down 1930 Model A Ford, which Nanny named \\"Arabella\\". For some reason the car's radio can only pick up radio broadcasts from 1930. The location of the series remained unclear; in season 1 pilot episode, and the season 2 episode \\"The Art of Relationships\\", it is mentioned that Everett is a professor at Collier University, but at the time there was no known college bearing that name. Following the show's cancellation, two animated adaptations of the series (Nanny and the Professor and Nanny and the Professor and the Phantom of the Circus) aired as part of The ABC Saturday Superstar Movie. Members of the original cast provided voices for their respective characters. Main cast *\\"Nanny\\" Phoebe Figalilly (Juliet Mills), a beautiful young British woman who shows up unannounced at the Everett household to look after the Professor's children. Though she gives no references, Everett affords Phoebe the customary six-week probationary period to see what she can do. At first her antics seem strange to the family, especially Hal, who calls her a \\"weirdo\\", but she soon endears herself to the three kids and, to a lesser extent, Everett himself. Phoebe (who prefers to be called \\"Nanny\\") claims to be neither clairvoyant nor magical, but appears to have a sixth sense about many things (accented by a tinkling musical sound whenever her senses assert themselves), including knowing the names of people she has never met, communicating with animals, and especially knowing someone is at the front door or on the telephone before they ring the bell. *Professor Harold Everett (Richard Long), a widower and mathematics teacher at Collier University. Everett's three children are so rambunctious that he cannot retain a nanny to take care of them; In the first episode they have gone through five different au pairs in less than a year before Nanny's arrival. Though he admits Nanny is already doing a very good job, his skepticism and Nanny's lack of references maintain his doubts as to whether it will work out, added to which the sheer implausibility of the many strange things that have happened since Nanny's arrival contradict Everett's discipline of practicality. Initially he spends most of his time working, but with Nanny's subtle prompting he begins to spend more and more time with his family. As the series progressed there were increasingly prevalent hints of a romantic interest between Everett and Nanny. *Harold \\"Hal\\" Everett, Jr. (David Doremus), the oldest of the Everett kids, Hal is of above average intelligence and takes after his father's practical and skeptical persona; the two often play chess together. Hal is also a tinkerer and inventor, though his experiments often go awry; one of his inventions is a prototype of what would later become known as The Clapper. *Bentley \\"Butch\\" Everett (Trent Lehman), the middle child and Hal's younger brother, who hates his real name and, when he's not eating, enjoys sports and is an occasional prankster; he unsuccessfully attempts to frighten Nanny by hiding his pet guinea pig in her bag. Butch harbors jealousy and envy of Hal and has a penchant for following in his footsteps whenever Hal takes up a new career choice, though in one episode the tables are briefly turned when, after he mimics Hal's stargazing, he happens to find a new comet and the Bureau of Astronomics decide to name the comet after him. *Prudence Everett (Kim Richards), the youngest of the Everett kids and the Professor's only daughter. Prudence immediately takes a liking to Nanny when she first arrives. *Mrs. Fowler (Patsy Garrett) (recurring), the Everetts' sometimes nosy neighbor. *Francine Fowler (Eileen Baral) (recurring), Mrs. Fowler's daughter and classmate of Hal. Francine has a terrible crush on Hal. *Waldo, the family dog, an Old English Sheepdog Episodes =Season 1 (1970)= =Season 2 (1970–71)= =Season 3, 1971)= Nanny's relatives From time to time, some of Nanny's eccentric relatives (and some Nanny claimed as relatives because they were everybody's uncle) dropped by the Everett home for a visit. They include: * Uncle Alfred (portrayed by John Mills, Juliet Mills's father), an eccentric who enthralls the Everett children with his wonderful stories and human flying act in his visit in \\"The Human Fly\\". * Aunt Justine (portrayed by Ida Lupino) and Aunt Agatha (portrayed by Marjorie Bennett), two of Nanny's loveable aunts who draw a mob of reporters, tourists and \\"Women's Libbers\\" when they descend on the Everetts, quite literally, in a balloon in \\"The Balloon Ladies\\". * Uncle Horace (portrayed by Ray Bolger), Nanny's roguish uncle, an old charmer, just back from the South seas, finds himself in great demand as rainmaker in Nanny's drought-stricken town during his visit in \\"South Sea Island Sweetheart\\". * Aunt Henrietta (portrayed by Elsa Lanchester), an eccentric grand dame who arrives in town with her circus and a disturbing premonition that Nanny is about to be carried off by a mustachioed stranger in \\"Aunt Henrietta's Premonition.\\" She later appeared in \\"Aunt Henrietta and the Jinx\\" during a battle between reason and superstition and returned again in \\"Aunt Henrietta and the Poltergeist\\" helping to get rid of a ghost. * Aunt Arabella, Nanny's aunt and the inspiration for the nickname of Nanny's antique 1930 Ford Model A automobile in \\"Nanny on Wheels\\". * Nanny had a lookalike great-aunt (never seen) who lived to a ripe old age (she was born in October - a Libra). * During Nanny's wedding to Cholmondeley Featherstonehaugh (pronounced \\"Chumley Fanshaw\\"), she found a note from her mother tucked in her great- great-great grandmother's wedding gown that told her to only marry if she was truly in love. Nanny took the advice of the note and called off the wedding. Ratings and cancellation The series first aired as a mid-season replacement on January 21, 1970, on ABC, and was last telecast on December 27, 1971. The series enjoyed initial success due to its Friday night timeslot when it was scheduled between The Brady Bunch and The Partridge Family, which were shows aimed at similar demographics (largely young children and pre-teens). Ratings suffered in the third season when ABC moved the series to Monday night opposite Gunsmoke and Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In. After the show was canceled, it had a brief run in syndication. It was also one of the first shows rerun on FX Network in 1994. The show was added to getTV's lineup in May 2016. 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment has not released the series on DVD.

On 6 October 1848, as the troops of the Austrian Empire were preparing to leave Vienna to suppress the Hungarian Revolution, a crowd sympathetic to the Hungarian cause (of workers, students and mutinous soldiers) tried to prevent them from leaving. The incident escalated into violent street battles; blood was spilt in Saint Stephen's Cathedral and Count Baillet von Latour, the Austrian Minister of War, was lynched by the crowd. The commander of the Vienna garrison, Count Auersperg, was obliged to evacuate the city, but he entrenched himself in a strong position outside it. On 7 October, Emperor Ferdinand I fled with his court to (now Olomouc, Czech Republic) under the protection of Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Grätz. Two weeks later, the Austrian Parliament was moved to (now Kroměříž, Czech Republic). On 26 October, under the command of General Windisch-Grätz and Count Josip Jelačić, the Austrian and Croatian armies started a bombardment of Vienna, and they stormed the city centre on the 31st. The defence was led by the Polish General Józef Bem. Except for him, who managed to escape, all the leaders of the resistance were executed in the days following—including Wenzel Messenhauser, the journalist Alfred Julius Becher, Hermann Jellinek and the Radical member of parliament Robert Blum, even though he had parliamentary immunity. The gains of the March Revolution were largely lost, and Austria began a phase of both reactionary authoritarianism—\\"neo-absolutism\\"—but also liberal reform.

Earth mysteries are a wide range of spiritual, quasi-religious and pseudoscientific ideas focusing on cultural and religious beliefs about the Earth, generally with regard to particular geographical locations of historical significance. Believers in Earth mysteries generally consider certain locations to be sacred, or that certain spiritual energies may be active at those locations. The term \\"alternative archaeology\\" has also been used to describe the study of Earth mystery beliefs. The study of ley lines originates in the 1920s with Alfred Watkins. The term \\"Earth mysteries\\" for this field of interest was coined about 1970 in The Ley Hunter journal,earlier use of the term \\"earth-mysteries\\" mostly refers to actual mysteries dedicated to chthonic deities in classical antiquity. and the associated concepts have been embraced and reinvented by movements such as the New Age Movement and modern paganism during the 1970s to 1980s. Some New Age believers engage in travel to locations they consider important according to their beliefs; for example, Stonehenge is a popular destination among New Age seekers. History The concept of Earth mysteries can be traced back to two 17th- century antiquarians: John Aubrey and William Stukeley, who both believed that Stonehenge was associated with the druids. Stukeley mixed together ancient monuments and mythology towards an \\"idealized vision\\" of nature. \\"Ley lines\\" were postulated by Alfred Watkins in 1921 at a presentation at the Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club, later published in Early British Trackways (1922) and The Old Straight Track (1925). Watkins formed the Old Straight Track Club in 1927, which was active until 1935 but became defunct during the World War II period. A revival of interest in the topic began in the 1960s, now associated with neopagan currents like Wicca, and with ufology. Watkins' Straight Track Club was revived in 1962 by Philip Heselton and others as the Ley Hunters' Club. The new club's journal The Ley Hunter was issued from 1965 to 1970, subtitled \\"the Magazine of Earth Mysteries\\". British writer John Ivimy wrote a book in 1975 called The Sphinx and the Megaliths in which he linked the Egyptian Sphinx to the British Stonehenge and other megalithic structures claiming they were all built by a group of \\"elite trained\\" people. The New Age boom of the 1980s expanded the scope of the \\"Earth mysteries\\" field beyond the British landscape, and Earth mysteries as a \\"New Age invented tradition\\" by the 1990s could include the study of ancient sites and landscapes (including archaeology, archaeoastronomy, and ley lines), Chinese geomancy or feng shui, western magical concepts of gematria, and dowsing. An important writer combining these fields during the 1970s to 2000s was John Michell. Michell's book The View Over Atlantis mixed ley lines with folklore and archeology; these ideas became popularised as \\"earth mysteries\\".Danny Sullivan, Ley Lines: The Greatest Landscape Mystery, Publisher Green Magic, 2005, p. 11 Other 1980s authors on the subject of Earth mysteries include Paul Devereux and Nigel Pennick.Caitlin Matthews, John Matthews, Walkers Between the Worlds: The Western Mysteries from Shaman to Magus, Publisher: Inner Traditions, 2004, p. 55 Related ideas include the \\"landscape archaeology\\" advocated by German author Kurt Derungs from about 1990, and the wider field of \\"Forteana\\", a term taken to include paranormal phenomena more generally. Publication history Books on Earth mysteries first appeared in the 1970s, discussing topics such as ley lines, earth energies, astro-archaeology, sacred landscapes, megalithic monuments, shamanism, paganism, dowsing and folklore.Teresa Moorey, Earth Mysteries: A Beginner's Guide, Hodder & Stoughton, 1999Daren Kemp, James R.

Cowan and Chris Arnold * 2005 – Ley Lines, Danny Sullivan Reception Proponents consider the Earth mysteries to be \\"sacred\\" and \\"mythopoeic\\" rather than scientific. The ley lines idea has been generally ignored by the academic establishment in the field of archaeology. The work of researchers who support the paranormal aspects of Earth mysteries have been extensively criticized by \\"professional debunkers\\" such as James Randi, Martin Gardner, and the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP). The Earth mysteries movement in Great Britain embraced the term \\"ritual landscapes\\" that was used in British archaeology starting in the 1980s, with regards to \\"sacred\\" locations apparently used for mainly ceremonial purposes in the Neolithic and the early Bronze Age; the concept has been both adopted and criticized in the field of academic archaeology.

The amended Constitution of Ukraine now provides for access to the Constitutional Court of Ukraine to all individuals and companies where there are grounds to claim that a final court judgment contradicts the Constitution. A complaint may only be filed after all other remedies have been exhausted in the regular Ukrainian courts. The authority of the Constitutional Court is derived from Ukraine's Constitution - Chapter XII The Court: * on the appeal of the President, no less than 45 members of the parliament, the Supreme Court of Ukraine, the Ombudsman, or the Crimean parliament, assesses the constitutionality of: ** laws and other legal acts of the parliament ** acts of the President ** acts of the Cabinet ** legal acts of the Verkhovna Rada of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea (Crimean parliament) * officially interprets the Constitution and laws of Ukraine * on the appeal of the President or the Cabinet, provides opinions on the conformity with the Constitution of international treaties * on the appeal of the parliament, provides an opinion on the observance of the procedure of impeachment of the President * provides an opinion on the compliance of a bill on introducing amendments to the Constitution with the restrictions imposed by the Constitution. The Court's rulings are mandatory for execution in Ukraine, are final and cannot be appealed. Laws and other legal acts, or their separate provisions, that are deemed unconstitutional, lose legal force.  Structure  The Court is composed of 18 judges, appointed in equal shares by the President, the parliament, and the Congress of Judges. A judge must be a citizen of Ukraine and must have: * attained the age of forty; * a higher legal education and professional experience of no less than 10 years; * resided in Ukraine for the last twenty years; * command of the state language (Ukrainian language) Judges are appointed for 9 years without the right of reappointment; moreover each judge is obligated to retire at the age of 65 if this age comes before the end of the 9-year period. The President and parliament are required to fill a vacant position within one month and the Congress of judges has three months to do so. But the appointment comes into effect only after oath of the new judge in the parliament; therefore sometimes it is a problem to become a judge of the Constitutional Court if many members of parliament do not want this (for example, they can physically disturb to hold a meeting of the parliament, that is usual in Ukraine). The Chairman of the Court is elected by secret ballot for a single three-year term from and by the members of the Court. The current Chairman is Nataliya Shaptala.

On May 16, Viktor Yushchenko, for a second time, issued another decree dismissing the two Constitutional Court Judges Syuzanna Stanik and Valeriy Pshenychnyy. On May 17, the Constitutional Court Chairman Ivan Dombrovskyy resigned and was replaced by Valeriy Pshenychnyy. On May 23, The Constitutional Court of Ukraine acted to prevent the president's undue influence on the court system. The court's ruling was made after Viktor Yushchenko unduly sought to influence the court by illegally firing two Constitutional Court judges Valeriy Pshenychnyy and Syuzanna Stanik for allegations of \\"oath treason.\\". On July 20, Syuzanna Stanik won an appeal against the President in the Shevchenko district court of Kyiv. The Court ruled the President's actions illegal and reinstated Ms Stanik's entitlement as a member of Ukraine's Constitutional Court. According to the ruling, the President is obliged to cancel his decree on discharge of Mrs. Stanik..\\" The other two judges who were also illegally dismissed had previously tendered their resignations and as such were not subject to the courts order. Following the president's intervention the Constitutional Court still has not ruled on the question of legality of the president's actions.

He was one of the most prominent composers in Venice in the late 17th century, and extremely influential in the development of late Baroque idioms across northern Italy. Life Legrenzi was born at Clusone, near Bergamo, then part of the Republic of Venice. His father, Giovanni Maria Legrenzi, was a professional violinist and, to some extent, a composer. We know Legrenzi had two brothers and two sisters, though one of the brothers, Marco, apparently a talented musician who performed with his father and brother in the 1660s, is not mentioned in Legrenzi's will: it is presumed that he died young. His remaining brother and sisters are both mentioned in his will. Legrenzi was probably taught largely at home, and his performance skills developed at the local church, and it can also be assumed there was music-making in the house. Legrenzi received his first appointment in Bergamo, as Organist at Santa Maria Maggiore, a magnificent church with a celebrated musical history. Following ordination as a priest in 1651, he was appointed as a resident chaplain at the church, though he continued to be actively involved in the music, and was given the title of First Organist in 1653, at about the time Maurizio Cazzati was appointed maestro di cappella. Legrenzi's first publication, music for Mass and Vespers, appeared in 1654. His appointment as organist was not reconfirmed at the end of the year owing to his apparent involvement in a minor gambling scandal, though he was reinstated by mid-February 1655. Legrenzi resigned from his position at Bergamo towards the end of 1655, and in 1656 became maestro di cappella at the Academy of the Holy Spirit in Ferrara. The Academy was not a learned society, but a fraternity of laymen which presented predominantly liturgical services with music. It had a small but very good musical establishment with an impressive tradition, and effectively addressed the needs of the whole aristocratic community of Ferrara, with whom Legrenzi cemented relationships that, like those he had already established in Bergamo, would serve him well throughout his life. The position at the Academy of the Holy Spirit would have left Legrenzi with ample time for other pursuits. By the early 1660s he had already published eight volumes, and had broken into the elite world of opera, gaining his first performances in Venice in 1664. We know little of certainty about Legrenzi's activities between approximately 1665 and 1670, a situation considerably exacerbated by the destruction of local records during World War II. He ended his association with the Academy of the Holy Spirit at some point, and does not appear to have had a permanent position of any sort for several years, though it is unlikely that he was in financial difficulty. He had land at Clusone and the proceeds from his publications, several of which had already gone into second editions, as well as performance fees. He also published his largest volume, the huge collection for double choir, during this period. Legrenzi seems to have been well settled in Venice by 1670. He took a position as a music teacher at Santa Maria dei Derelitti (commonly called the Ospedaletto), remaining until 1676, and was busy with further publications, musical commissions, especially oratorios, occasional performances, and more. In 1676 he was a finalist for appointment as maestro at San Marco in succession to Francesco Cavalli, losing by a single vote to Natale Monferrato. Later in the year he became maestro di coro of the Ospedale dei Mendicanti, where he remained until 1682 when he succeeded Antonio Sartorio as vice-maestro at San Marco. He was by this time (along with Carlo Pallavicino) the leading opera composer of his day, with ten commissions in the five years to 1685. Legrenzi succeeded Monferrato as maestro di cappella at San Marco in April 1685. He was by this time probably in failing health, and the last few years of his life were clouded by sickness. He took little part in the services at San Marco from the later part of 1687, where performances were increasingly in the hands of his vice-maestro, Gian Domenico Partenio. Legrenzi's death on 27 May 1690 from the \\"mal di petra\\" (a colic- related illness, probably kidney stones) was accompanied by excruciating pain. Legrenzi's legacy lived on for some years after his death. His great-nephew Giovanni Varischino inherited his music and books, and produced four posthumous publications. Music Legrenzi was active in most of the genres current in northern Italy in the late 17th century, including sacred vocal music, opera, oratorio, and varieties of instrumental music. Though best known as a composer of instrumental sonatas, he was predominantly a composer of liturgical music with a distinctly dramatic character. The bulk of his instrumental music may also be included in this category, since it would have been used primarily as a substitute for liturgical items at Mass or Vespers. Legrenzi composed nineteen operas from 1662-1685, of which the most successful were Achille in Sciro (1664), La divisione del mondo, I due cesari (1683), Il Giustino (1683), and Publio Elio Pertinace (1684). His operas were immensely popular (and extravagantly presented) in their day, though, like his oratorios, few have survived. His later dance music was certainly connected with the operatic repertoire, though the function of an early collection (Op. 4, which is musicologically famous for its inclusion of six pieces designated sonate da camera) is less clear. Legrenzi's music is steadily gaining interest as scores and transcriptions become more widely available. Early music groups are increasingly including the instrumental sonatas and selections of the devotional and liturgical music in concerts. There have been significant revivals of some of the surviving operas. Editions of La divisione del mondo and Il Giustino by the German conductor Thomas Hengelbrock have had performances at the Schwetzingen Festival, the Innsbruck Festival of Early Music and the Echternach Music Festival, and there was a major revival of La divisione del mondo in a co-production between the Opéra national du Rhin and Opéra national de Lorraine in February/March 2019.\\"Les Talens Lyriques Season Brochure 2019-2020\\" Published works * Concerti Musicali per uso di Chiesa.

The printing of La Cetra as Opus 10 appears to be an error on the part of the Venetian publisher, who was presumably unaware of the collection published in Bologna in 1670: the correct numbering of the publications resumed with Opus 12. Unpublished works A number of works survive in manuscript copies only. Most can be ascribed confidently to Legrenzi, though there are a few of less certain attribution. Among the most important of these works are: * The Messa a cinque voci con stromenti, found at Oxford. * The Missa quinque vocibus found at Loreto. This Mass, dated 1689 and surviving in a magnificently bound volume, may have been presented as a votive offering. * The Messa a 16 for four choirs and organ continuo held in the Vatican Library. * The Prosa pro mortuis, a complete setting for double choir and instruments of the sequence \\"Dies irae\\" from the Requiem Mass. * A unique setting for double choir and instruments of Matins for Christmas Day, including the Invitatory, Psalms and Te Deum; and concluding with the Introit for the First Mass of Christmas. * Intret in conspectu, a motet for 6 voices, known from a single source copied out by Handel, who drew on Legrenzi's motet in the chorus 'To thy dark servant' in the oratorio Samson. * Credidi propter quod locutus sum, a psalm setting for solo alto, strings and continuo, which appears likely to be a unique example of Legrenzi's own hand, as there is evidence that it is an autograph. * Laudate pueri, a psalm setting for five voices, strings and continuo and, unusually, a trumpet. * Spirate aure serenae, a motet for solo soprano, strings and continuo which provides for a theorbo to double or replace the violone. There are in addition a few more liturgical pieces, a number of cantatas and the unusual 'serenata' Notte, madri d’horrori.

W. Phelps. The Salt Sermon is often confused with Rigdon's July 4th oration. Background The years before 1838 were difficult for the members and leaders of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. In 1837, Smith and Rigdon founded an \\"anti- bank\\" called the Kirtland Safety Society. When it failed much of the blame was laid upon Smith. Half of the Quorum of Twelve Apostles accused Smith of improprieties in the banking scandal. LDS Church Apostle Heber C. Kimball would later say that the bank's failure was so shattering that afterwards \\"there were not twenty persons on earth that would declare that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God.\\" Smith's former secretary, Warren Parish, along with Martin Harris and others, vied for control of the church in Kirtland, taking possession of the Kirtland Temple, \\"excommunicating\\" [want reference] Smith and Rigdon, and forcing Smith and Rigdon to relocate and establish a community at Far West, Missouri. They were followed there by hundreds of loyalists in a trek known as the \\"Kirtland Camp.\\" However, after fleeing from Kirtland, Smith faced continuing external persecutions, along with serious internal dissensions. Smith and Rigdon became determined to extinguish this perceived apostasy in the church as they believed that the very entire future of the Latter Day Saint movement was at stake. Due to Rigdon's ability to sway audiences, he became Smith's spokesman in an attempt to promote church orthodoxy, and as a result Rigdon also became symbol of the militancy of the church in Far West. Sermon On 19 June 1838, in Far West, Rigdon delivered a harsh public condemnation of a large number of the members and leaders of the church for their perceived disloyalty towards Smith and Rigdon. While no summary or text of Rigdon's sermon remains, eyewitnesses indicated that Rigdon took the subject of his text from the fifth chapter of the Gospel of Matthew. According to Rigdon, the dissenters were like the \\"salt\\" spoken of by Jesus (part of the metaphors of salt and light in the Sermon on the Mount) and must be \\"trodden under foot\\". Rigdon was then followed by Smith with a short speech, in which he seemingly sanctioned what Rigdon had said. Response The Salt Sermon caused a great deal of demand to purge the church of any disloyal members. This included the formation of the seemingly unauthorized Danites, a secret militant society for the enforcement of church orthodoxy. Two days after Rigdon sermon, eighty Latter Day Saints signed a statement (the so-called Danite Manifesto) warning the dissenters to \\"depart, or a more fatal calamity shall befall you.\\" According to John Corrill, an early church member and leader, Corrill stated that \\"although [Rigdon] did not give names in his sermon, yet it was plainly understood that he meant the dissenters or those who had denied the faith.\\" The dissenters and their families interpreted these words as threats, and they quickly left Caldwell County, Missouri. Their stories helped stir up anti-Mormon feeling in northwestern Missouri and contributed to the outbreak of the 1838 Mormon War.

Freerunning may include flipping and spinning. These movements are usually adopted from other sports, such as gymnastics, tricking or breakdancing. Freerunners can create their own moves, flows and lines in different landscapes. It is all about becoming creative in an objective environment. Practitioners of freerunning usually do parkour as well. Freerunning is often associated with parkour by adding acrobatic and stylish moves, showcasing the art of movement. Freerunning was founded by Sebastien Foucan, who discussed the subject in Jump London in 2003. Foucan developed freerunning as a more inclusive form of parkour. Parkour's efficient military style obstacle course training lends itself to martial art as a means of weapons avoidance and efficiently closing a distance to an opponent. Freerunning is derived from parkour, but it emphasizes not efficiency but artistry, allowing room for fancy flips and stylistic acrobatics. Etymology The word \\"freerunning\\" was first used in the documentary, Jump London. The name came about because of a suggestion by Guillaume Pelletier (Origin of the FreeRunning), who was working with the group of practitioners at this time. In the documentary, freerunning was defined as an English translation of parkour.Note: Foucan has since said that the confusion regarding the roots of the term came out of the fact that he was still formulating his ideas at the time of the filming. Philosophy The central principle of freerunning is that one should express oneself by moving fluidly in one's environment; there are no limitations on the form of this movement. Foucan expands on a number of basic principles of the sport in his book, Freerunning. Other practitioners have suggested other principles. For example, Daniel Ilabaca encourages people to think positively, suggesting that practitioners of freerunning will sometimes fall—largely because they think they might. History =Origins in parkour= In Western Europe, the idea of moving past obstacles for personal development or sport originated with Georges Hébert. He observed untrained native tribes in Africa with fantastic athletic ability and created the 'natural method' system to train people using the same ideas. His ideas eventually led to the parcours du combattant ('obstacle course', literally 'assault course'), which is now a standard of military training. These ideas were picked up by a young Raymond Belle, who used them to practical effect while separated from his family during the First Indochina War. When he moved to France and started a family, he passed on these ideas to his son, David. 30 years later, other young people were attracted to these ideas and a small group formed, the Yamakasi, which included Foucan. This group trained together for several years and in 1997, through David Belle's brother, Jean-Francois, they started to attract attention and be invited to perform at events. The Yamakasi eventually split apart, though, because some members sought to find more individual expressions of the discipline. Meanwhile, action star Jackie Chan had also been heavily featuring the same concepts in most of his films ever since the early 1980s from the other side of the globe. Yamakasi cited him as an influence on parkour. They drew influence from Asian culture and Asian martial arts, notably the acrobatic antics of Jackie Chan in his Hong Kong action films, as well as the philosophy of Bruce Lee. =Further development= Foucan wanted to create a discipline that was more personal to the individual than parkour and more easily adapted to suit each person's individual goals. His idea was similar to that of Bruce Lee's creation of Jeet Kune Do. Foucan wanted to take everything that he had found useful and that he liked from his parkour experiences and combine it into one sport. Foucan's early ideas were first spread through the Jump London documentary (2003) and its sequel, Jump Britain (2005). Foucan has appeared in other productions, such as Casino Royale and Madonna's Confessions Tour. With each appearance both the discipline and Foucan himself increased in fame. International In 2014, the BBC traveled to J&K; Kashmir to highlight the youth partaking in freerunning as a form of freedom of expression.

He belonged to the Bosonid family. During his reign, he empowered his relatives at the expense of the aristocracy and tried to establish a relationship with the Byzantine Empire. He had success in defending the realm from external enemies, but his domestic habits and policies created many internal foes and he was removed from power before his death. Early life Hugh of Arles was born in 880/1, the eldest surviving son of Theobald, Count of Arles, and Bertha of Lotharingia. By inheritance, he was Count of Arles and Vienne, which made him one of the most important and influential nobles in the Kingdom of Provence. After the Emperor Louis III, who was also King of Provence, was captured, blinded, and exiled from Italy in 905, Hugh became his chief adviser and regent. By 911, most of the royal prerogatives were exercised by Hugh and Louis ceded him the titles dux of Provence and marchio of the Viennois.McKitterick, 267. He moved the capital to his family's chief seat of Arles and in 912 married Willa, widow of Rudolph I of Burgundy. Hugh would then unsuccessfully attempt to take Burgundy from Rudolph's son, Rudolph II of Burgundy. At an unknown date, a Provençal army led by Hugh, his brother Boso, and Hugh Taillefer invaded Lombardy with the support of Hugh's mother. On the basis of the account of Constantine Porphyrogenitus, this event has been dated to as late as 923–924, but the account of Liutprand of Cremona dates the event much earlier, between 917 and 920.Previté Orton, 340. About 922, a sizable faction of Italian nobles revolted against the by-then Emperor Berengar and elected Rudolph II of Burgundy King of Italy. This started a civil war, which resulted in Berengar's death in 924. King Rather than accept Rudolph, Berengar's partisans now elected Hugh as king (925). Rudolph was ejected from Italy in 926 and Hugh crossed the Alps to be crowned. In his absence, Louis of Provence transferred his county of Vienne to Charles-Constantine. Louis died on 5 June 928 and Hugh returned to Provence to sort out a succession. For whatever reasons, neither Charles Constantine nor Hugh was elected king, but Hugh annexed the kingdom to Italy de facto, issuing diplomata concerning Provence from his Italian chancery in a royal style. He also took control of the right to grant fiefs in Provence. During his early years of reign, Hugh somewhat improved the central administration of the kingdom, achieving rather more (though not total) success against the Magyar raids that had been plaguing Italy for several decades. In September 928, Hugh met with Rudolph of France and Herbert II of Vermandois in Burgundy. Hugh granted Herbert's son Odo Vienne in opposition to Charles Constantine. He was still in conflict with Rudolph of Burgundy and hoped to ally with the King of France against the Burgundian monarch. By 930, however, Charles was in complete control of Vienne and by 931, Rudolph of France was claiming suzerainty over the Viennois and Lyonnais. In light of these reverses in his transalpine policy, Hugh turned his attention towards securing his rule in Italy and receiving the imperial crown. He induced the Italian nobility to recognise his son Lothair as their next king and crowned him in April 931. That same year, he accused his half-brother Lambert of Tuscany of conspiring for the crown — perhaps with the support of a faction of nobles — and deposed him, bestowing the March of Tuscany on his brother Boso. Hugh, however, had other reasons for deposing Lambert, who presented an obstacle to his second marriage to Marozia. Lambert's supporters called in Rudolph of Burgundy, whom Hugh bribed off with the gift of the Viennois and Lyonnais, which Rudolph successfully occupied. In 933, Rudolph relinquished all his rights to Italy. In 936, Hugh replaced Boso of Tuscany with his own son Humbert. He granted Octavion in the Viennois to Hugh Taillefer and patched up his relations with Charles Constantine in a final effort to save influence in Provence. Second marriage However, Hugh's attempt to strengthen his power further by a second marriage failed disastrously. His bride was Marozia, senatrix and effective ruler of Rome and widow first of Alberic I of Spoleto and then of Hugh's own half-brother Guy of Tuscany. This last fact, though, meant that the marriage was illegal under canon law, because of the relationship of affinity between them — a matter that Hugh tried to circumvent by disowning and eliminating the descendants of his mother's second marriage and giving Tuscany to a relative on his father's side of the family, Boso. This in turn, however, alarmed Alberic II, Marozia's teenage son or stepson from her first marriage, who, appealing to Roman distrust of the foreign troops Hugh had brought with him, launched a coup d'état during the wedding festivities. Hugh managed to flee the castle by sliding down a rope and rejoining his army, but Marozia was imprisoned until her death a few years later. Hugh's power in Italy was damaged but not destroyed by these events. To strengthen his hand in the affairs of Milan, he tonsured his younger illegitimate son, Tebald, to groom him for the position of Archbishop of Milan; however, the ancient cleric, Arderic, whom he installed pro tem lived another twenty-two years. He continued to organise the fight against the Magyars and the Andalusian pirates based at Fraxinet in Provence. Active, if sometimes dubious, diplomacy paid off. He concluded a treaty with Rudolph in 933 by which Rudolf abandoned his claims to Italy in return for being handed Provence over the heads of Louis the Blind's heirs and the marriage of Rudolph's daughter Adelaide to Hugh's son Lothair. Friendly relations were maintained with the Byzantine Empire and, in 942, Hugh even came to terms with Alberic, who married one of Hugh's daughters. Within the kingdom, Hugh intensified his existing habit of giving any available offices or lands to relations, including his numerous legitimate and illegitimate progeny, and a small circle of old and trusted friends. The effect this had on Italian nobles who saw this as a threat eventually resulted in rebellion. In 941, Hugh expelled Berengar of Ivrea from Italy and abolished the March of Ivrea. In 945, Berengar returned from exile in Germany and defeated Hugh in battle. By a diet Berengar held at Milan, Hugh was deposed, though he managed to come to terms by which he nominally kept the crown and the title rex (king) but returned to Provence, leaving Lothair as nominal king, but with all real power in Berengar's hands. Hugh retired to Provence, but continued to carry the royal title until 947. Family By four wives and at least four mistresses, he left eight children. With his first wife, Willa of Provence, Hugh had no children. His only legitimate children were both from his second wife, Alda or Hilda, of German origin, whom he married before 924. * Alda of Vienne, who married Alberic II of Spoleto * Lothair, Hugh's successor.

It is developed by the Luxembourg-based company NoMachine which also lends its name to the software..  Features  NX can be installed on Windows, Mac, Linux and Linux ARM servers. The client software is available for Windows, Mac OS X, iOS, Android, Linux, Linux ARM and HTML/JavaScript. Its features include sharing network devices, session recording, file transfer, multimedia capability and browser-based access. The enterprise-oriented server products also offer multi compute-node clustering and fail-over functionality, and the ability to run multiple virtual Linux instances on the same machine (Linux Terminal Server functionality). NX utilizes VirtualGL to run high-end OpenGL-based X applications and 3-D CAD programs smoothly at high resolutions. NX—or NoMachine, as it is often referred to since the release of version 4—is platform-agnostic. It can be installed on Linux, Windows and Mac instances virtualised within popular hypervisors like Xen, KVM or VMware, and integrated with any virtual desktop infrastructure running in private or public clouds, such as Amazon EC2 or Rackspace.  History  In 2001, the compression and transport protocol NX was created to improve the performance of the native X display protocol so it could be used over slow connections such as dial-up modems. It wrapped remote connections in SSH sessions for encryption. NX's design was derived from the Differential X Protocol Compressor project (DXPC). NX version 1 was released on February 14, 2003. The last update, version 3.5, was released in 2012. From v.3.5, NX's core compression technology was made available to the community under the GNU GPL2 license, whilst other components such as the NX Server and NX Client programs remained proprietary. In 2009, Google made a freely available open-source GPL2 version of the server called Neatx. Other open- source variants of NoMachine's NX are also available (see below). Starting in 2013, with the release of version 4.0, NX became closed-source.  NX 4 and later versions  NX 4 introduced optimal image compression and caching with the latest video-encoding techniques. Client applications can connect using the SSH protocol, with the same authentication mechanisms as version 3, by a new SSH system login, or by the new SSL-enabled NX daemon. Once a secure connection is established, clients negotiate a desktop session using a text protocol compatible with that used in version 3. Clients can also use one of the various NoMachine subsystems, such as the file synchronization service, software updates, directory services, voice/video messaging and server clustering. When connecting hosts across the network, the NX protocol works as a generic tunnel, with additional framing and flow control information, and dynamically adapts compression and bandwidth according to network speed and capacity. For compatibility, multiplexing is based on version 3. NX 4 added new channel types to handle services such as the new file-system redirection, new printing system, virtual network interfaces, smart cards and USB devices. Most NoMachine components, including the agent program that impersonates the desktop session on the server, embed so-called \\"slave servers\\"—lightweight servers that provide inter-process communication and automation that can be used to create additional channels, under the control of the client and server. Applications can still request that channels carry data using the NX X Window System protocol compression. Version 4 added new channel types for video and audio, allowing multiple codecs in the same stream. Currently, the display (video) channels can handle data in H.264, VP8, MJPEG and other formats, with additional primitives used to implement special encoding operations concurrent with standard audio and video streams. Once the session is established between client and server, NX data can travel on TCP and UDP streams. The client and server dynamically select which transport to use, based on the type of data and network conditions. If communication over UDP is enabled, client and server can automatically instruct the router to open the necessary ports. UDP uses symmetric Blowfish encryption. The host interface and port, and Blowfish encryption key, are negotiated via a secure TCP link. UDP communication is disabled when using SSH tunneling, so that all data uses the same SSH link. The display protocol uses a combination of video and image encoding, based on standard codecs and a number of techniques developed by NoMachine. NX monitors display and user activity to adapt quality and buffering to the displayed application.  Authentication  From version 4.0 on, when the default NX protocol is used, the login can be via password-based authentication, private key or Kerberos ticket authentication. When NX is configured to send its data by SSH (available only on enterprise-version servers), the following authentication methods are available: Client to Server * NX login as NX user using the NX SSH key and user password-based authentication * System login with password-based authentication * System login with SSH key-based authentication * System login with SSH key-based authentication and SSH key stored on a smart card * System login with Kerberos ticket existing on client side Server to Node * Login with password * Login with SSH key forwarded from client (e.g. NoMachine Player) via server to node * Login with Kerberos ticket forwarded from client via server to node * Login with Kerberos ticket requested by Kinit on server host * Login with Kerberos ticket requested by PAM module on server host. * Login with password to Kerberos ticket requested by PAM module on node host  Version 3 and earlier  NX compresses the X11 data to minimize the amount of data transmitted, and caches data to keep the session as responsive as possible. For example, the first time a menu is opened, it may take a few seconds, but is subsequently almost instant. NX is faster than its predecessors, as it eliminates most of the X round trips, while dxpc and MLView only compress data. The two principal components of NX are nxproxy and nxagent. nxproxy is derived from dxpc and is started on both the remote (client in X terminology) and local (server in X terminology) machines, simulating an X server on the client and forwarding remote X protocol requests to the local X server. Simplest setup: remote clients (xterm, etc.) ↕ nxproxy client ↕ Network ↕ nxproxy server ↕ local X server (monitor/keyboard) nxproxy alone achieves 1:10 to 1:1000 compression ratios., reducing bandwidth, but does not eliminate most of X's synchronous round trips, responsible for most of X's perceived latency. nxagent, derived from Xnest (similar to Xephyr), is typically started on the remote (client) machine, thus avoiding most X11 protocol round trips. Together with nxproxy (built into nxagent), this setup performs well over low-bandwidth and high- latency links. Typical setup: remote clients (xterm, etc.) ↕ nxagent server side \\\\ nxagent client side nxagent executable nxproxy client / ↕ Network ↕ nxproxy server ↕ local X server (monitor/keyboard) On systems with a functional X11 implementation, nxproxy and nxagent are all that is needed to establish a connection with low-bandwidth requirements between a set of remote X clients and the local X server. SSH can be used to establish a secure tunnel between the hosts. NX 3 relies on SSH functionalities and existing open-source SSH software, making it possible to run contemporary Unix and Windows desktops and arbitrary network applications over the Internet in a secured and controlled way. FreeNX and the various NX Clients are used for setup, handling suspend and resume, secure tunnelling over SSH, and printing and sound.  Other display protocols  All Enterprise versions of NoMachine's NX protocol allow client connections to hosts via Remote Desktop Protocol (for Windows Remote Desktop Services sessions) and remote Virtual Network Computing sessions (most modern general-purpose operating system platforms), as well as XDM.  License  Prior to version 4.0, NoMachine released core NX technology under the GNU General Public License, and offered non-free commercial NX solutions,. free client and server products for Linux and Solaris, and free client software for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and embedded systems. On December 21, 2010, NoMachine announced that NX 4.0 would be closed-source.. Due to the free-software nature of older NX releases, the FreeNX project was started to provide wrapper scripts for the GPL NX libraries. FreeNX was developed and maintained by Fabian Franz, but has not announced a release since 2008.. 2X Software has developed another commercial terminal server for Linux using the NX protocol.. On July 7, 2009, Google announced their open- source NX server, Neatx, as an internal project.. The project had no releases and is not actively developed. Its source code is available under the GNU GPL v2 license.. X2Go is based on the 3.x NX libraries, but is not compatible with other implementations.. The client and server are released under a combination of GNU GPLv2 or later, and GNU AGPLv3 or later..  Clients  The primary NX clients are the official freeware, NoMachine, and NoMachine Enterprise Client. Several open-source projects can also use the NX protocol. An OS mature project was Lawrence Roufail's nxc client library, a full library which can be used for other clients to build upon. The nxrun application utilizes this library. , the library does not allow suspending or resuming sessions, and uses only JPEG graphics compression. The kNX project was a proof-of-concept application written by Joseph Wenninger, with plans for it to eventually become a complete NX client to show that an open-source client could be written. Its development was halted before it was completed. In late 2005, Fabian Franz and George Wright began modifying kNX to use the nxc library, but abandoned the project. More recent open-source efforts include QtNX, which offers full suspend and resume. However, it has been reported as incompatible with the most recent NX libraries. Nxcl, an update to nxclientlib, the core of QtNX, was completed by Seb James in September 2007, and works with version 3 of the NX core libraries. It also drops dependency on Qt, which prevented nxclientlib from becoming widely used as a cross-platform basis for NX client programs. nxcl provides a library that can be linked to a client program (libnxcl), and a self-contained NX client with a D-Bus API (the nxcl binary). It is available from the FreeNX Subversion server. Other recent and actively maintained OSS NX clients include OpenNX, described as a \\"drop-in replacement for NoMachine's [proprietary] nxclient\\" with full suspend and resume. Various open-source terminal server projects, such as X2Go, also use the NX protocol. However, X2Go is not compatible with other NX servers or clients. Remmina, another recent GTK+ remote desktop client project, announced the ability to use the NX protocol in its release 0.8.

A subseries stemming from the main Final Fantasy series, it is a collection of video games, animated features and short stories based in the world and continuity of Final Fantasy VII (1997). Officially announced in 2003 with the reveal of Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, the series' core products are four video games and one movie release. Alongside these are tie-in products and spin-offs including books, mobile games and an original video animation. Advent Children and the mobile title Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII are a sequel and prequel to VII, respectively focusing on Cloud Strife, the original game's main protagonist, and covert operatives known as the Turks. Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII follows Zack Fair, a major character in VII, while Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII, a sequel to Advent Children, follows Vincent Valentine, one of the original's optional characters. The series was conceived by Yoshinori Kitase, the original game's director, and Tetsuya Nomura, the main character designer. Nomura would become the main designer for each entry in the Compilation. Other returning staff include writer Kazushige Nojima, art director Yusuke Naora, and composer Nobuo Uematsu. The video games belong to different genres, with none of them being traditional role-playing games due to production pressures related to the genre. While the first title revealed was Advent Children, it ran into delays during post-production, so the first Compilation title to be released was the mobile game Before Crisis. Of the core titles, Before Crisis is the only one still unreleased in the west due to issues with overseas platform compatibility and staff changes. Reception of titles in the Compilation has been mixed, with Advent Children being praised for its visuals and criticized for its confusing nature. Before Crisis and Crisis Core have received praise, while Dirge of Cerberus garnered a mixed response. The presentation of the Compilation as a whole has met with a mixed response, and later staff linked it to the decline of the Final Fantasy series' prestige in the West. The Compilation inspired the creation of Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy, a similar subseries of linked video games. Titles =Video games= *Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII is an action role-playing video game split into 24 episodes, with episode delivery working via a monthly subscription-based distribution system. After going through beta testing in 2004, it was released on September 24, 2004 for NTT DoCoMo's FOMA iMode, and on January 30 and April 5, 2007 for SoftBank Mobile and EZweb respectively. The game was never released to western markets, despite plans to do so. *Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII is an action game featuring both first and third-person shooter elements. There was originally a multiplayer mode, but this was removed in the western version. It was released on January 26, August 15, and November 17, 2006 in Japan, North America and Europe respectively. The localized version received an overhaul before release, as the developers were not pleased with the Japanese version of the game. An International version, featuring the improvements made to the localized version, was released in Japan on September 11, 2008 as part of Square Enix's Ultimate Hits lineup. A mobile spin-off taking place during the events of the game, Dirge of Cerberus Lost Episode: Final Fantasy VII, was released on August 22, 2006 in North America and July 26, 2007 in Japan. *Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII is an action role-playing game. Crisis Core has the player controlling Zack Fair in a real-time combat system enabling the player to move Zack around, activate abilities and attack or block attacks from enemies. It was released on September 13, 2007 in Japan, and on March 24 and June 20, 2008 in North America and Europe respectively. *Final Fantasy VII Remakehttps://www.thegamer.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-compilation-of-ff7/ is an action role-playing game developed and published by Square Enix, released for PlayStation 4 on April 10, 2020. It is the first in a planned series of games remaking the 1997 PlayStation game Final Fantasy VII. =Films= *Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, the first title conceived for the Compilation, the second to be released, and a direct-to-DVD sequel to VII. It was released in Japan on September 14, 2005, and on April 24 and 25, 2006 for Europe and North America respectively. It received a single special western cinema screening on April 3, 2006, at the Arclight Theatre in Los Angeles. A director's cut of the film, Advent Children Complete, was also produced, featuring graphical retouches, extra footage and rerecorded voice work for the English and Japanese versions. A Blu-ray exclusive, Advent Children Complete was released on June 2, 2009 in North America, on July 27, 2009 in Europe, and on October 7, 2009 in Australia. A demo for Final Fantasy XIII was included in the Japanese limited edition set. *Last Order: Final Fantasy VII, an original video animation detailing the destruction of the town of Nibelheim, a key event in VII. Last Order was packaged with a limited edition of Advent Children called Advent Pieces, released on September 14, 2005 in Japan and February 6, 2007 in North America. Advent Pieces was limited to a quantity of 77,777 copies. The OVA is no longer available to purchase. =Related media= Multiple pieces of tie-in media have been created for the Compilation, nearly all relating to Advent Children. To promote Advent Children Complete, a series of short stories were written by Kazushige Nojima under the umbrella title On a Way to Smile. The stories were later collected into a single paperback volume and released on April 16, 2009. An animated adaptation of one story, \\"Case of Denzel\\", was included in all copies of Advent Children Complete. Nojima also wrote Final Fantasy VII Lateral Biography: Turks ~The Kids Are Alright~, a novel set a short time before Advent Children. The novel was illustrated by Shou Tojima. A mobile racing game based on a mini game from VII, Final Fantasy VII G-Bike, was released on October 30, 2014, for iOS and Android. A western release for the title was planned. It was developed by Japan-based developer CyberConnect2 as part of a planned subseries of mobile games based on VIIs mini games. While related to VII and the Compilation due to its nature, the developers confirmed that it was not related to nor affected the Compilation itself. Due to difficulties delivering continual satisfactory service, G-Bike was shut down in 2015 without seeing a Western release. Setting The setting of Final Fantasy VII is a world that has been described as an industrial or post-industrial science fiction milieu. It is referred to as \\"the Planet\\" by the series characters, and was retroactively named \\"Gaia\\" in some Square Enix promotional material and by game staff. The planet's lifeforce is called the Lifestream, a flow of spiritual energy that gives life to everything on the Planet. Its processed form is known as \\"Mako\\". During VII and its prequels, the Lifestream is being used by the megacorporation Shinra as an energy source. This is in turn causing the Planet to dangerously weaken, threatening the existence of everything and everyone on the planet. The main narrative of VII focuses on an eco-terrorist group known as AVALANCHE, chronicling their conflict with Shinra president Rufus Shinra and his subordinates, including the covert Turks, and SOLDIER, an elite fighting force created by giving humans raw Mako. Eventually, all come under threat from Sephiroth, a member of SOLDIER created through Shinra experimentation and driven mad when he learns the truth about his origins, and Jenova, an alien lifeform which seeks to destroy all life on the Planet. Among the main characters are Cloud Strife, a mercenary and self-proclaimed ex- SOLDIER, Aerith Gainsborough, a flower seller and last member of an ancient tribe known as the Cetra, Tifa Lockhart, Cloud's childhood friend, and Vincent Valentine, a former Turk who was made immortal by Shinra experimentation. During the conflict, Sephiroth summons a destructive spell called Meteor to mortally wound the Planet. When Aerith attempts to summon Holy, a defense mechanism that can stop Meteor, she is killed by Sephiroth. Eventually, the party are successful in defeating Sephiroth, and the Lifestream reinforces Holy, successfully stopping Meteor. The Compilation titles act as continuations and expansions on the core narrative, with them focusing on various characters. Advent Children begins two years after VII, when people across the world are succumbing to a disease called Geostigma and Cloud, suffering from guilt, is forced to confront Kadaj, Loz and Yazoo, avatars of Sephiroth's will. Before Crisis begins six years prior to the events of VII, and follows the confrontations between the Turks and the original incarnation of AVALANCHE. Crisis Core takes place in a similar time period, but follows events from the point of view of Zack, a SOLDIER who befriended Cloud and was killed by Shinra troops after turning against the company. Among the characters who interact with Zack is Genesis Rhapsodos, a member of SOLDIER who successfully rebels and eventually decides to protect the Planet. Dirge of Cerberus is set a year after Advent Children, and focuses on Vincent's conflict against Deepground, a sect of SOLDIER that was trapped beneath Midgar during Meteor's descent. Last Order takes place during the events at Nibelheim, where Jenova was originally stored and Sephiroth first found out about himself. Production =Creation= Final Fantasy VII director and Compilation co-creator Yoshinori Kitase at the 2009 Electronic Entertainment Expo. The Compilation of Final Fantasy VII was created by Yoshinori Kitase and Tetsuya Nomura, the respective director and character designer for Final Fantasy VII. It was at one point defined by Square Enix as their first step towards \\"polymorphic content\\", a marketing and sales strategy to \\"[provide] well-known properties on several platforms, allowing exposure of the products to as wide an audience as possible.\\" Speaking on why VII had been chosen for such a project, Kitase explained that the ending left far more development opportunities open for characters and setting than other games in the series. There was also a strong financial benefit to creating the Compilation—following the unprecedented financial upturn prompted by the release of Final Fantasy X-2 just prior to the 2003 merger of Square and Enix into Square Enix, then-CEO Yoichi Wada decided that the company could tap into fan demands for continuations of the story of Final Fantasy VII. The first title to be conceived was Advent Children, original envisioned as a short film presentation created by Visual Works, the animation studio behind CGI cutscenes for the company's games. Early in pre-production, plans to make Advent Children a video game rather than a film were considered, but due to several factors including Visual Works' lack of experience with actual game production, it remained a film. One of the main conditions for the project's launch was to reunite the original staff members of Final Fantasy VII: Nojima, art director Yusuke Naora, composer Nobuo Uematsu. After Advent Children began development, it was decided by the team that one title was not enough to fully explore the VII universe. In response, Before Crisis, Dirge of Cerberus and Crisis Core were conceived so as to embrace more aspects of the world and characters. Nomura himself was surprised at the creation of the games, having originally assumed that the film would be the sole product of the project. =Development= Each title had a different impetus fueling its creation and development: Before Crisis was thought up by Hajime Tabata, a new employee at Square Enix's mobile division, when asked by Nomura to create a video game featuring the Turks. Dirge of Cerberus was inspired by Vincent's choice of weapon, Kitase's love of first-person shooters, and the challenge it would provide developers. Prior to the series solidification and the release of Advent Children and Before Crisis, the team had considered other gun-wielding Final Fantasy protagonists for such a game. Crisis Core originated simply as either a Final Fantasy spin-off or a port of Before Crisis for the PlayStation Portable, and after talks with Kitase and Nomura, it was decided to make it another title in the Compilation. The creation of Before Crisis after Advent Children began a lettering formula for the series later used by the staff as common abbreviations: 'AC' stood for Advent Children, 'BC' for Before Crisis, 'CC' for Crisis Core and 'DC' for Dirge of Cerberus. The sequence was nearly disrupted when Crisis Cores title was considered as Before Crisis Core, but the \\"Before\\" part of the title was soon dropped, coincidentally creating the sequence. Before Crisis began development in 2002. The Compilation was first unveiled in 2003 with the announcement of Advent Children. None of the titles in the series up to that point were traditional role-playing games like the original. The explanation for this was that traditional RPGs took long production periods and a large staff, which would have made the project stand out a bit too much. One of the other considerations for the team was not to make the titles lightweight as X-2 had been, due to backlash from parts of the fanbase. Conversely, making Final Fantasy X-2 reminded the team that they did not need to stick to completely serious traditional RPGs, enabling the original creation of the Compilation. While Advent Children was the first Compilation title to begin production, it ran into problems during post- production, resulting in the first released title being Before Crisis, despite it being the second title to begin development. Before Crisis was also originally planned for release in North America, but the mobile phones available in North America at the time were not able to handle the game. In addition, the producer Kosei Ito left Square Enix in 2008 and Tabata moved on to other projects, leaving its localization unlikely. Japanese animation studio Madhouse created a commercial to promote Before Crisis. Due to its success and staff feelings that important scenes from VII represented in Advent Children had been needlessly disjointed, the studio was chosen to produce an animated film: this eventually became Last Order. Crisis Core was originally going to be an action game, but became an action RPG, staying within the staff's design strengths while incorporating action elements. Wada had stated in 2006, while the development and release of Compilation titles was still ongoing, that the Compilation could remain an active franchise until 2017, the twentieth anniversary of Final Fantasy VIIs release. After finishing work on Advent Children Complete, the team announced that they would take a break from the series, although they stated that they still have various ideas for future titles. In later interviews relating to Final Fantasy VII, multiple staff members including Nomura stated that the Compilation was only ever intended to extend to three games and a movie, ending with the release of Crisis Core. Their reasoning was that releasing any more would saturate the market. Reception Compared to the original VII, which received near- universal critical acclaim and later cult status as a classic game, the entries in the Compilation have often garnered a mixed reception, and the Compilation as a whole has been critiqued by some. In July 2007, Edge magazine stated that the titles \\"could be of a high quality, but there is also a perversion of the original.\\" RPG Site's Alex Donaldson, during a review for Crisis Core, said that the Compilation was \\"too far detached from the lore of Final Fantasy VII.\\" While critiquing Advent Children and Dirge of Cerberus, and faulting Before Crisiss lack of the original game's characters, he felt that Crisis Core was the Compilations \\"first classic [Final Fantasy VII] spinoff.\\" RPGFans Stephen Meyerink said that the Compilation titles prior to Crisis Core had \\"expanded, extended, and retconned [the story] into what some would call an unrecognizable mess.\\" Alexa Ray Corriea, writing for Polygon, was highly critical, saying that few of the Compilation titles were good, and only served to \\"cheapen the 1997 [PlayStation] original.\\" Reviews for Advent Children have been mixed to positive: while critics have praised the presentation, graphics and fan appeal, all reviews agree that the story's context and delivery were confusing for people new to the series. While western critics were positive about Last Order, the OAV received heavy fan criticism in Japan due to its retconning of key events, which prompted the team to ensure that the event was faithfully recreated in Crisis Core. Before Crisis, due to remaining in Japan, has received limited attention in the west, but previews have been highly positive, with many praising the gameplay and graphics as being impressive for a mobile game. Opinions for Dirge of Cerberus were decidedly mixed. While many praised the story and characters, especially the focus on Vincent's character and development, critics were mixed to negative about the graphics and gameplay. Japanese magazine Famitsu notably gave the game a delayed and highly critical review. Crisis Core was generally praised, with many enjoying the story's intimate presentation of the characters and action-oriented gameplay, despite some criticism for it being aimed at fans of VII. Critics of the Compilation have generally cited Crisis Core as the best title of the series. The Final Fantasy VII remake had the highest average score in Metacritic, an 88.88/100 Tom Marks of IGN calls the game a \\"complete reinvention\\", praising the combat system, its \\"story fleshed out with real emotional arcs\\" and its nostalgic feel, but criticized the game for having filler and sometimes convoluted new plot points and side missions. He stated that \\"Final Fantasy VII Remake's dull filler and convoluted additions can cause it to stumble, but it still breathes exciting new life into a classic while standing as a great RPG all its own.\\" Nahila Bonfiglio of The Daily Dot states that the \\"game’s neo-noir, Blade Runner-esque setting perfectly marries with its gritty but heartfelt tone.\\" She adds that it is matched by \\"the exquisite level design with seamless mechanics, addicting gameplay and rousing battles, and you have a recipe for perhaps one of the best games of the year.\\" Both IGN and GameSpot enjoyed the handling of Cloud due to his notable character arc despite starting as anti-hero. =Sales= Many of the titles have received strong sales. Through 2006, Advent Children met with high sales, with 1 million units sold in Japan, 1.3 million in North America, and 100,000 in Europe, making a total of 2.4 million copies sold worldwide. The original version went on to sell four million copies worldwide by 2009. Advent Children Complete also met with strong sales, selling 100,000 copies on its first day of release in Japan. Advent Children Complete was cited as a reason for the increase in sales of the PlayStation 3 console. Before Crisis registered 200,000 users on launch day, making it the best- selling mobile game up until that time, and was accessed 1.6 million times by June 2006. Dirge of Cerberus shipped 392,000 units in its first week, and went on to sell 460,000 units in North America and 270,000 units in Europe. Crisis Core sold 350,000 copies in Japan on its release date, while it sold 301,600 copies in its first month of release in the United States. It went on to sell 3.1 million units worldwide. =Legacy= The process of thought behind the Compilation would later inspire the creation of Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy, a subseries of games linked by a common mythos, and would use lessons learned from the Compilation production process. On an individual level, Before Crisiss popularity would inspire the creation of another mobile title within the Fabula Nova Crystallis subseries: originally titled Final Fantasy Agito XIII, it would later change platforms and be renamed Final Fantasy Type-0. The battle sequences in Advent Children also served as inspiration for Motomu Toriyama when creating the battle system for Final Fantasy XIII. Former staff members have blamed the Compilation, in conjunction with other extensions of titles like Final Fantasy X, for undermining the series' market presence and fan trust in the West. Worldwide, the remake shipped and sold over 3.5 million copies within three days. This made it one of the biggest launches for a PlayStation4 game and the fastest-selling PS4 exclusive in history, surpassing the launch sales of the two previous record holders, Marvel's Spider-Man (3.3million) and God of War (3.1million).

History Mir Castle300px Mir village was founded sometime prior to 1345. It is home to a late medieval castle, which made the town the target of many attacks over the centuries. The town belonged to the Illinič family (Korczak coat of arms) first and then to the Radziwiłł family. It was destroyed by the Swedish forces in 1655 (Deluge) and again by the Swedes during the Great Northern War in 1706. In 1792, the Lithuanian division of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth army under Józef Judycki was routed by the invading Imperial Russian army corps under Boris Mellin (see Battle of Mir). During the Napoleonic invasion of Russia in 1812, Russian Imperial cavalry, artillery and cossack regiments ambushed and defeated the Duchy of Warsaw 3 uhlan divisions (Battle of Mir (1812)). The retreating Russians, withdrawing east, abandoned the town and destroyed the castle with gunpowder. During the Middle Ages it was first located in the Principality of Polotsk, after the Battle on the river Nemiga in the Principality of Minsk, then was taken over by Kievan Rus' but after the Mongol Invasion the Rus' rule diminished and since 1242 Mir belonged to the expanding and dynamic Duchy of Lithuania. In 1569, along with the rest of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Mir became a part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1795, Mir was acquired by the Russian Empire as a result of the Third Partition of Poland. From 1921 until 1939, Mir was part of the Second Polish Republic. On 17 September 1939, the town was occupied by the Red Army and, on 14 November 1939, incorporated into the Byelorussian SSR. From 28 June 1941 until 7 July 1944, Mir was occupied by Nazi Germany and administered as a part of the Generalbezirk Weißruthenien of Reichskommissariat Ostland. After the end of German occupation, it remained within the Byelorussian SSR until 1991, when it became part of the independent Republic of Belarus. Mir was the site of two very famous horse fairs associated with Saint Nikolaus feast days, first held on May 9 and the second fair on December 6 each year. Both fairs lasted four weeks each and were very popular and well known throughout the country until 1939. Roma practically dominated the fairs as horse traders, and numerous Roma community thrived in the town until 1939. The fairs collapsed in 1941, when Nazi Germany invaded the Belorussian Soviet Republic and murdered the Roma people of Mir. Mir's claim to fame in Jewish Diaspora history is that it was the original home of the Mir yeshiva which operated there intermittently from 1815 until the fall of Poland in 1939, when the invading communist Soviet Red Army and security forces pressured the school to close and relocate to then still free Lithuania. (Current incarnations of the yeshiva are located in Brooklyn, New York, Jerusalem and Modi'in Illit.) Today, Mir has little industry and is no longer an internationally renowned center of Jewish learning or Roma horse trade. Home to about 2,500 people, virtually none of whom are descended from the once thriving Jewish and Roma communities, its primary attraction is the Mir Castle as well as memorials erected by the Soviet government and various Jewish groups over the past half century. On the eve of World War II, some 2,400 Jews lived in Mir, about half of the town's population. All of them, except about 50 escapees, were murdered by the Germans in 1941. One of the escapees, Elia Miranski, reported in an interview given in 2013 that entire neighborhoods had been destroyed by the Germans and the town today is significantly smaller than it was; outlines of the former neighborhood streets can be seen on Google Earth to the northeast of the castle along the river.

The Tây Sơn were led by three brothers, referred to by modern Vietnamese historians as the Tây Sơn brothers because of their origin in the district of Tây Sơn.Kim, p. 359. The Tây Sơn dynasty ended the century-long war between the Trịnh and Nguyễn families, fought off an attack by Qing China, and united the country for the first time in 200 years. Under the most prominent of the Tây Sơn brothers, Nguyễn Huệ (regnal title Quang Trung), Vietnam experienced an age of relative peace and prosperity. However, when he died in 1792 he left no successor capable of administrating the country properly, which allowed the exiled Nguyễn lord Nguyễn Ánh to retake the south of Vietnam and eventually pave the way for his own imperial dynasty, the Nguyễn dynasty. Name The Tây Sơn dynasty was named after the Tây Sơn District in Bình Định Province, the birthplace of the three brothers who established the dynasty. The name \\"Tây Sơn\\" means \\"western mountains\\". Background  Emperor Quang Trung Late 18th-century painting depicting the Qianlong Emperor receiving Nguyễn Quang Hiển, the peace envoy from Nguyen Hue in Beijing In the 18th century, Vietnam was officially ruled by the Lê dynasty, but real power lay in the hands of two warring families, the Trịnh lords of the north who ruled from the imperial court in Thăng Long and the Nguyễn lords in the south, who ruled from their capital Huế. Both sides warred extensively for control of the country while simultaneously claiming to be loyal to the Lê emperor. Life for the peasants during these times were difficult- ownership of land became concentrated in the hands of a handful of landlords as time passed. The imperial bureaucracy became corrupt and oppressive; at one point the imperial examination-degrees were sold to whoever was wealthy enough to purchase them. As the people grew poorer, the ruling lords lived lavish lifestyles in opulent palaces. While the Trịnh lords had enjoyed peace since the end of the war between the Trịnh and the Nguyễn in 1672Dupuy, p. 653., the Nguyễn lords regularly campaigned against Cambodia and later the Kingdom of Siam. While the Nguyễn lords usually won these wars and opened up new fertile lands for the landless poor to settle, the frequent warring took a toll on their popularity. Conquest of Nguyễn lords In 1769 the new king of Siam Taksin launched a war to regain control of Cambodia. The war went against the Nguyễn lords and they were forced to abandon some of the newly conquered lands, which included Cambodia's eastern coast of Cochinchina. This failure, coupled with heavy taxes and endemic corruption at the local level, spurred three brothers Nguyễn Nhạc, Nguyễn Huệ, and Nguyễn Lữ (no relation to the Nguyễn lords) from the village of Tây Sơn to begin a revolt in 1772 against the Nguyễn lord Phúc Thuần.Kohn, p. 523. The Tây Sơn brothers styled themselves as champions of the people. Over the next year, the revolt gained traction and they won some battles against the Nguyễn army that was sent to crush their rebellion. The Tây Sơn drew their support from not only poor farmers but also by some indigenous highland tribes. Nguyễn Huệ, the brothers' leader, said that his goal was to end the people's oppression, reunite the country, and restore the power of the Lê emperor in Hanoi. The Tây Sơn also promised to remove corrupt officials and redistribute land. In 1773 the Tây Sơn captured the port of Qui Nhơn, where the merchants, who had suffered under restrictive laws put in place by the Nguyễn, lent the uprising their financial support. The Nguyễn, at last recognizing the serious scale of the revolt, made peace with the Siamese, giving up some land they had conquered in previous decades. However, their problems were compounded when Trịnh Sâm chose to end the 100-year peace and exploit the turmoil in the south by sending his army to attack Phú Xuân (modern-day Huế), the Nguyễn capital. The Trịnh army captured the city, forcing the Nguyễn to flee to Gia Định (now modern day Saigon) The Trịnh army continued to march south and the Tây Sơn army continued its conquest of other southern cities. The forces arraigned against the Nguyễn were simply too many and in 1776 the Tây Sơn army captured the last Nguyễn stronghold of Gia Định and massacred the town's Han Chinese population.Owen, p. 113. The entire Nguyễn family was killed at the end of the siege, except for one nephew, Nguyễn Ánh, who managed to escape to Siam. The eldest Tây Sơn brother, Nguyễn Nhạc, proclaimed himself Emperor in 1778. A conflict with the Trịnh thus became unavoidable.  Siam invasion  The Tây Sơn spent the next decade consolidating their control over the former Nguyễn territory. Nguyễn Ánh proved to be a stubborn enemy. He convinced the King of Siam, P'ya Taksin, to invade Vietnam in support of him. The Siamese army attacked in 1780, but in several years of warfare, it was unable to defeat the Tây Sơn army, as gains were followed by losses. In 1782, the Siamese king was killed in a revolt, and less than a year later, Nguyễn Ánh's forces were driven out of Vietnam. In 1785, Siam launched an invasion again and occupied part of the Cuu Long Delta, but was defeated by Nguyen Hue in the Battle of Rạch Gầm-Xoài Mút.  Conquest of Trịnh lords Having vanquished the Nguyễn for the time being, Nguyễn Huệ decided to destroy the power of the Trịnh lords. He marched to the north at the head of a large army in 1786, and after a short campaign, defeated the Trịnh army successfully. The Trịnh were also unpopular and the Tây Sơn army seemed invincible. The Trịnh lord fled north into China. Nguyễn Huệ later married princess Lê Ngọc Hân, the daughter of the nominal later Lê Emperor, Lê Hiển Tông.  Qing invasion  A few months later, realising that his hope of retaining power had gone, the Emperor Lê Chiêu Thống fled north to the Qing Empire of China, where he formally petitioned the Qianlong Emperor for aid. The Qianlong Emperor agreed to restore Lê Chiêu Thống to power, and so in 1788, a large Qing army marched south into Vietnam and captured the capital Thăng Long. Nguyễn Huệ gathered a new army and prepared to fight the Qing army. He addressed his troops before the battle saying: In a surprise attack, while the Qing army was celebrating the Lunar New Year, Nguyễn Huệ's army defeated them at the Battle of Ngọc Hồi- Đống Đa and forced them, along with Lê Chiêu Thống, to retreat. The Tay Son were supported by Chinese pirates.Little, p. 205. Anti-pirate activities were undertaken by a joint alliance between the Qing dynasty and Nguyễn lords Gia Long while Chinese pirates collaborated with the Tay Son.Leonard, p. 136.Spencer.Dar, Sino-Vietnamese Relations.Dar, Tay Son Uprising. After the battle, Nguyễn Huệ sought to restore the tributary relationship in order to deter a joint Qing-Siam pincer attack and prevent further Chinese attempts to restore the Lê dynasty. Nguyễn Huệ sent a ritually submissive request to the Qianlong Emperor under the name of Nguyễn Quang Bình (also referred to as Ruan Guangping). In 1789, the Qianlong Emperor agreed to re-establish the tributary relationship and enfeoff Nguyễn as the King of Annam on the condition that Nguyễn personally lead a special delegation to Beijing to celebrate the Qianlong Emperor's 80th birthday. For the Qianlong Emperor, the motivation for accepting the arrangement was to retain the Qing's supremacy and stabilize their southern border. Chinese and Vietnamese sources agreed that Nguyễn sent an imposter with a delegation to Beijing, where they were received with lavish imperial favors. The Qianlong Emperor approved the proposal and bestowed Nguyễn with the title An Nam quốc vương (\\"King of Annam\\"). The title indicated that Huệ was recognized as the legal ruler of Vietnam and Lê Chiêu Thống was no longer supported.  Decline and fall  Nguyễn Huệ, now stylized as Quang Trung, was resentful; he trained his army, built large warships and waited for an opportunity to take revenge on Qing. He also provided refuge to anti-Manchu organizations such as the Tiandihui and the White Lotus. Infamous Chinese pirates, such as Chen Tien-pao (陳添保), Mo Kuan-fu (莫觀扶), Liang Wen-keng (梁文庚), Fan Wen-tsai (樊文才), Cheng Chi (鄭七) and Cheng I (鄭一) were granted official positions and/or noble ranks under the Tây Sơn empire. All attack plans had to be given up due to Nguyễn Huệ's sudden death. The attack never materialized by the time that Quang Trung died in 1792.Đại Nam chính biên liệt truyện, vol. 30 After a 1782 massacre of ethnic Chinese settler was carried out by the Tây Sơn, the support of the Chinese shifted towards to the Nguyễn lords.Choi, p.35–37Choi, p.74– The Nguyễn lords eventually defeated the Tây Sơn dynasty thanks to ethnic Chinese support, took complete control of Vietnam, and established the imperial Nguyễn dynasty in 1802. The Nguyễn used crushing by elephant to execute the defeated Tây Sơn leader Bùi Thị Xuân. The heart and liver from her body were consumed by soldiers of the Nguyễn.Marr, pp. 211–12.

Zoilus I Dikaios (Greek: ; epithet means \\"the Just\\") was an Indo-Greek king who ruled in Afghanistan and Pakistan and occupied the areas of the Paropamisade and Arachosia previously held by Menander I. He may have belonged to the dynasty of Euthydemus I. Time of reign Zoilos used to be dated after the death of Menander, c. 130–120 BCE (Bopearachchi). Two coins of Zoilus I were however overstruck by Menander I Senior R.C., MacDonald, D.: The Decline of the Indo-Greeks, Monographs of the Hellenic Numismatic Society, Athens (1998) so Zoilos came to power while Menander was still alive and was perhaps his enemy. R. C. Senior has suggested some time between 150–135 BCE. Coin types of Zoilos I Coin of Zoilos I symbolizing on the reverse the victorious alliance of the Heraklean club and the Scythian bow. Zoilos I uses a silver coin type similar to that of Euthydemus II, son of Demetrius: Crowned Herakles standing, holding a wreath or diadem in his right hand, and a club and the lion skin in his left hand. On some of the coins, which are of lower artistic quality, Herakles is crowned by a small Nike. Zoilos I also struck rare gold-plated silver coins with portrait and Heracles. The Indian-standard coins of Zoilos I also bear the Pali title \\"Dhramikasa\\" (\\"Follower of the Dharma\\"), probably related to Buddhism, appearing for the first time on Indo- Greek coinage. A few monolingual Attic tetradrachms of Zoilos I have been found. Zoilos inherited (or took) several monograms from Menander I. His bronze coins are square and original in that they combine the club of Herakles with a Scythian-type bowcase (for a short recurve bow) inside a victory wreath, suggesting contacts or even an alliance with horse-mounted people originating from the steppes, possibly either the Scythians (future Indo- Scythians), or the Yuezhi who had invaded Greco-Bactria. This bow can be contrasted to the traditional Hellenistic long bow depicted on the coins of the eastern Indo-Greek queen Agathokleia. Image:ZoilosI-524.jpgZoilos I and Herakles.

In 1702 he went to Venice and became one of the leading composers in the city. In 1720 he returned to Rome for his last important work, Tigrane (1724). He wrote the first opera using the story of Hamlet (Ambleto, 1705) though this was not based on Shakespeare's play. Gasparini was also a teacher, the instructor of Marcello, Quantz and Domenico Scarlatti. He was musical director of the Ospedale della Pietà, where he employed Antonio Vivaldi as a violin master.

It differs from other techniques for inducing general anesthesia in that several extra precautions are taken to minimize the time between giving the induction drugs and securing the tube, during which period the patient's airway is essentially unprotected. First described by William Stept and Peter Safar in 1970, \\"classical\\" or \\"traditional\\" RSI involves pre-filling the patient's lungs with a high concentration of oxygen gas; applying cricoid pressure to occlude the esophagus; administering pre-determined doses of rapid-onset sedative and neuromuscular-blocking drugs (traditionally thiopentone and suxamethonium) that induce prompt unconsciousness and paralysis; avoiding any artifical positive-pressure ventilation by mask after the patient stops breathing (to minimize insufflation of air into the stomach, which might otherwise provoke regurgitation); inserting a cuffed endotracheal tube with minimal delay; and then releasing the cricoid pressure after the cuff is inflated, with ventilation being started through the tube. There is no consensus around the precise definition of the term \\"modified RSI\\", but it is used to refer to various modifications that deviate from the classic sequence – usually to improve the patient's physiological stability during the procedure, at the expense of theoretically increasing the risk of regurgitation. Examples of such modifications include using various alternative drugs, omitting the cricoid pressure, or applying ventilation before the tube has been secured. The procedure is used where general anesthesia must be induced before the patient has had time to fast long enough to empty the stomach; where the patient has a condition that makes aspiration more likely during induction of anesthesia, regardless of how long they have fasted (such as gastroesophageal reflux disease or advanced pregnancy); or where the patient has become unable to protect their own airway even before anesthesia (such as after a traumatic brain injury). The induction drugs clasically used for RSI have short durations of action, wearing off after only minutes. This confers a degree of fault tolerance on the procedure when it is used in elective or semi-elective settings: if intubation is unsuccessful, and if the clinical condition allows it, the procedure may be abandoned and the patient should regain the ability to protect their own airway sooner than would be the case under routine methods of induction. Conversely, in emergency settings where the patient's condition does not allow for them to be woken up immediately, a failed intubation under RSI places them at very high risk for respiratory compromise.  Common medications  = Premedication = Premedication is used to reduce anxiety of those who are going to be intubated and to reduce the anticipated physiological response of the patient during intubation. * Midazolam – It is a fast-acting and the most lipophilic of all benzodiazepine and rapidly crosses the blood–brain barrier. It is a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist. Usual doses for midazolam are 1 mg to 2 mg where the older people receive smaller doses and obese people receive higher doses. Midazolam is metabolised in the liver and is excreted through the kidneys. When midazolam is used alone, it has few side effects, but can cause respiratory depression if being used together with fentanyl. * Fentanyl - It is a synthetic, centrally-acting opioid. It suppresses pain and sympathetic stimulation. Sympathetic stimulation can cause further injury to those with heart disease, aortic dissection, and aortic aneurysm. Fentanyl is ideal because of its rapid onset, lack of histamine release, high lipophilicity, and short duration of action. The dosage is between 1 and 3 μg/kg. It is metabolised by liver. The most significant side effect is respiratory depression. * Atropine — The process of intubation can cause massive stimulation to vagus nerve, causing bradycardia (low heart rate). The people who are at increased risk of bradycardia are neonates and children. This does not happen in adults because sympathetic stimulation overpowers the vagal response. However, for those adults who have received drugs such as beta blocker, calcium channel blocker, and digoxin have an increased risk of developing bradycardia. Atropine is a muscarinic receptor antagonist, thus blocking the vagal response. The dose is 0.01 mg/kg. It has quick onset of action, and common side effects are: increased heart rate, dry mouth, flushing, and urinary retention. * Lidocaine – It is used to reduce the sympathetic response in those who have suspected raised intracranial pressure (ICP) or those who received succinylcholine which also causes increase ICP or those with underlying asthma that have bronchospasm. Administration of lidocaine can causes reduction in mean arterial pressure (MAP). The dosage is 1.5 mg/kg. This drug is metabolised by liver. The side effects are: hypotension, arrythmia (irregular heart beat). Lidocaine can further interact with other drugs such as amiodarone and monoamine oxidase inhibitor to cause hypotension, and dronedarone to cause arrhythmia. =Induction agents= Administration of induction agents followed by neuromuscular blockade agents helps to achieve optimal conditions for intubation. * Etomidate – It is an imidazole-derivative that stimulates GABA receptors. The dosage is between 0.2 and 0.6 mg/kg (commonly 20 to 50 mg doses). Dose reduction may be required in those with hypotension. Etomidate has minimal cardiovascular side effects, reduces intracerebral pressure (by reducing cerebral blood flow), and does not cause histamine release. It has quick onset of action, short duration of action, and undergoes hepatic elimination. Myoclonus, pain at the site of the injection, post-operative nausea and vomiting are common. It can also suppresses the production of cortisol and aldosterone. * Ketamine – It is highly lipophilic and crosses the blood-brain barrier. It inhibits the binding of glutamine to N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors in Thalamocortical radiations and limbic system, causing amnesia. Through the same blockade of NMDA receptor, ketamine is also effective as a painkiller. The dosage is 1 to 2 mg/kg, usually given at 100 mg. Ketamine is metabolised by liver and excreted through kidneys. The drug lessen the reuptake of the catecholamine, increases heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac output, thus suitable for those with hypotension. However, it can worsen the cardiac depression and hypotension for those with depletion of catecholamines. Thus, maximum dose of 1.5 mg/kg is need for this situation. For those with head injuries, ketamine does not appear to increase intracranial pressure, while able to maintain the mean arterial pressure. Ketamine also relieves bronchospasm by relaxing bronchiolar smooth muscles. However, it increases oral secretions during intubation. Ketamine is associated with nightmares, delirium, and hallucinations. * Propofol – It is a highly lipid-soluble, GABA agonist. The dosage is 1.5 mg/kg (usually 100 to 200 mg). It has quick onset of action, can cross the blood-brain barrier, wide tissue distribution, and can be cleared by the body quickly. In the elderly, the rate of propofol clearance is low. Therefore, lower doses of propofol (50 to 100 mg) should be given. It is suitable in those with kidney or liver impairment and decreases intra-cranial pressure. For those with bronchospasm, propofol also has mild bronchodilating effect. However, propofol can induce hypotension and bradycardia due to its calcium channel blocker and beta blocker properties. At prolonged high propofol dosages, it can induce propofol infusion syndrome. Pain during peripheral administration of propofol can be reduced by using a large bore cannula. * Midazolam – Apart as a premedication, midazolam can be used as an induction agent at the dose of 0.2 to 0.3 mg/kg. It has slow onset of action when used alone, but the onset can be improved when using together with an opioid. However, for those with hypotension, midazolam can further reduce the blood pressure and has cardiac depressive effects. Therefore, dose reduction is required for the elderly, and for those with heart and liver failure. * Methohexital – This is a GABA agonist. It works by reducing the dissociation of GABA from its receptors. The dosage is 1.5 mg/kg. It is metabolised in liver. However, methohexital can cause respiratory depression, venodilatation, myocardial depression, and hypotension. Additionally, it can also cause reduced cerebral blood flow and histamine release. It can cause distal thrombosis and tissue necrosis if given into the arterial system. = Paralytics = Paralytics are also known as neuromuscular-blocking drugs (NMB). NMB can reduce the complication rates of rapid sequence induction such as inadequate oxygenation of the blood, airway complications, and instability of the cardiovascular system. NMB can be divided into two types: depolarising and non-depolarising blockers. Depolarising blockers resembles the acetylcholine and activates the motor end-pate of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Meamwhile, non-depolarising blockers competitively blocks the NMJ without activating the motor end plate. Depolarising blockers * Succinylcholine – This drug has rapid onset of action and fast duration. Its dosages are between 1 and 2 mg/kg body weight with common dosage of 100 mg. The drug can only be kept under room temperature for 14 days. Therefore, for longer shelf life, it has to be kept under temperatures from to . When the intravenous access is not obtainable, the 3 to 4 mg/kg of intramuscular doses can be given (usual dose of 300 mg). However, duration of onset will be delayed to 3 to 4 minutes. Repetitive dosages of succinylcholine are discouraged to prevent vagal stimulation which leads to bradycardia. In myasthenia gravis, the number of acetylcholine receptors is reduced due to antibodies attack. Therefore, dosages greater than 2 mg/kg is required for these people. In Lambert Eaton syndrome, the number of acetylcholine receptors is upregulated. Although this condition has increased response to the non- depolarising NMB, it does not show increased response to depolarising blockers. Therefore, succinylcholine dose reduction is not needed for Lambert Eaton syndrome. For those with pseudocholinesterase enzyme deficiency, the person can remain paralysed up to 6 to 8 hours because there is not enough enzymes to break down succinylcholine. Therefore, it should be avoided in these people. On the other hand, although there is also a relative decrease in pseudocholinesterase enzymes in those with liver disease, kidney disease, anemia, pregnancy, chronic cocaine use, amphetamine abuse, increased age, and connective tissue disease, the succinylcholine effect is minimal and dose reduction is not needed. The most significant side effect of succinylcholine is malignant hyperthermia and hyperkalemia. In malignant hyperthermia, mutation of ryanodine receptor at chromosome 19 is responsible for the increased release of calcium from the calcium channels, thus triggering increase in muscle contraction and temperature rise. This only happens when succinylcholine is administered. For those who had history of receiving succinylcholine and developed fever, tachycardia, and muscle rigidity[...?]. Muscle rigidity in the masseter muscle causes intubation to be impossible. Rhabdomyolysis of the muscles also occurs leading to increase in calcium, potassium, and creatine kinase blood concentrations. Blood gas analysis which cause mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis [...?]. Dantrolene (dose at 2.5 mg/kg) is the treatment of choice; it binds to ryanodine receptors by inhibiting calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. However, such drug is labour-intensive for pharmacy to prepare. Other physiological derangements should be treated supportively. The serum potassium levels typically increase by 0.5 to 1 mEq/L and is not contraindicated in those with diabetic ketoacidosis and acute kidney failure. Only if the person has symptomatic hyperkalemia, then rocuronium should be considered. In those with prolonged immobilisation, crush injuries, burns, and myopathies, there is increase in extrajunctional cholinergic receptors, thus potential potassium rise is higher in these people. For those with acute nerve injuries or stroke, the increase in acetylcholine receptors will only occur after five to fifteen days after injury. Therefore, succinylcholine can be given within the first 24 hours of injury. The increase in succinylcholine sensitivity remains elevated after 2 to 6 months after the injury. Other side effects of succinylcholine includes increase in intraocular pressure (IOP) and increase in intracranial pressure (ICP). Non-depolarising blockers * Rocuronium – The dosage of rocuronium is between 0.6 and 1.2 mg/kg. Since rocuronium has longer duration of onset, caution should be taken for those who is difficult to bag-mask ventilate. * Vecuronium – The dosage of this drug is between 0.08 and 0.1 mg/kg. Vecuronium is only used when there is a shortage of drugs such as succinylcholine and rocuronium. Reversal agents * Sugammadex – It is used as a reversal agent for rocuronium and vecuronium. It works by encapsulating the paralytic drug thus preventing it from acting on the binding sites. The dose of 16 mg/kg is used for immediate reversal after administration such as during RSI. Doses of 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg are used if the patient has twitches evident on a twitch monitor and terminates the rocuronium action within 3 minutes. The FDA initially did not approve Sugammadex due to concerns over potential allergic reactions, however it was subsequently approved on December 15, 2015 for use in the United States. * Neostigmine – It can be used to reverse nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents which cannot be reversed with sugammadex, although its onset is much slower. It works by competing with acetylcholine for the binding sites of acetylcholinesterase, which in turn prevents the breaking down of acetylcholine. The dosage is between 0.03 and 0.07 mg/kg. The side effect of this drug is bradycardia. Therefore, glycopyrrolate should be given together with neostigmine to prevent bradycardia. = Other medications = * Thiopental * Metaraminol or ephedrine, where hypotension may occur secondary to the sedating drugs. * Phenylephrine – This drug is administered to those with hypotension post intubation as a result of lidocaine, midazolam, fentanyl, propofol, and ketamine. The dosages range from 50 to 200 μg in adults. It has quick onset and quick elimination. The common side effect is reflex bradycardia. Technique Rapid sequence intubation refers to the pharmacologically induced sedation and neuromuscular paralysis prior to intubation of the trachea. The technique is a quicker form of the process normally used to induce general anesthesia. A useful framework for describing the technique of RSI is the \\"seven Ps\\". = Preparation = The patient is assessed to predict the difficulty of intubation. Continuous physiological monitoring such as ECG and pulse oximetry is put on the patient. The equipment and drugs for the intubation are planned, including the endotracheal tube size, the laryngoscope size, and drug dosage. Drugs are prepared in syringes. Intravenous access is obtained to deliver the drugs, usually by placing one or two IV cannulae. =Preoxygenation= The aim of preoxygenation is to replace the nitrogen that forms the majority of the functional residual capacity with oxygen. This provides an oxygen reservoir in the lungs that will delay the depletion of oxygen in the absence of ventilation (after paralysis). For a healthy adult, this can lead to maintaining a blood oxygen saturation of at least 90% for up to 8 minutes. This time will be significantly reduced in obese patients, ill patients and children. Preoxygenation is usually performed by giving 100% oxygen via a tightly fitting face mask. Preoxygenation or a maximum of eight deep breaths over 60 seconds resulting in blood oxygenation is not different from that of quiet breathing volume for 3 minutes. Newer methods of preoxygenation include the use of a nasal cannula placed on the patient at 15 LPM at least 5 minutes prior to the administration of the sedation and paralytic drugs. High flow nasal oxygen has been shown to flush the nasopharynx with oxygen, and then when patients inspire they inhale a higher percentage of inspired oxygen. Small changes in FiO2 create dramatic changes in the availability of oxygen at the alveolus, and these increases result in marked expansion of the oxygen reservoir in the lungs prior to the induction of apnea. After apnea created by RSI the same high flow nasal cannula will help maintain oxygen saturation during efforts securing the tube (oral intubation).Binks MJ, Holyoak RS, Melhuish TM, Vlok R, Bond E, White LD.

The use of nasal oxygen during pre-oxygenation and continued during apnea can prevent hypoxia before and during intubation, even in extreme clinical cases. =Pretreatment= Pretreatment consists of the medications given to specific groups of high-risk patients 3 minutes before the paralysis stage with the aim of protecting the patient from the adverse effects of introducing the laryngoscope and endotracheal tube. Intubation causes increased sympathetic activity, an increase in intracranial pressure and bronchospasm. Patients with reactive airway disease, increased intracranial pressure, or cardiovascular disease may benefit from pretreatment. Two common medications used in the pretreatment of RSI include Lidocaine and Atropine. Lidocaine has the ability to suppress the cough reflex which in turn may mitigate increased intracranial pressure. For this reason Lidocaine is commonly used as a pretreatment for trauma patients who are suspected of already having an increase in intracranial pressure. Although there is not yet definitive evidence to support this, if proper dosing is used it is safe. The typical dose is 1.5 mg/kg IV given three minutes prior to intubation.Hampton, J. P. (2011). Rapid- sequence intubation and the role of the emergency department pharmacist. American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy, 68(14), 1320–1330. doi:10.2146/ajhp100437 Atropine may also be used as a premedication agent in pediatrics to prevent bradycardia caused by hypoxia, laryngoscopy, and succinylcholine. Atropine is a parasympathetic blocker. The common premedication dose for atropine is 0.01–0.02 mg/kg. =Paralysis with induction= With standard intravenous induction of general anesthesia, the patient typically receives an opioid, and then a hypnotic medication. Generally the patient will be manually ventilated for a short period of time before a neuromuscular blocking agent is administered and the patient is intubated. During rapid sequence induction, the person still receives an IV opioid. However, the difference lies in the fact that the induction drug and neuromuscular blocking agent are administered in rapid succession with no time allowed for manual ventilation. Commonly used hypnotics include thiopental, propofol and etomidate. The neuromuscular blocking agents paralyze all of the skeletal muscles, most notably and importantly in the oropharynx, larynx, and diaphragm. Opioids such as fentanyl may be given to attenuate the responses to the intubation process (accelerated heart rate and increased intracranial pressure). This is supposed to have advantages in patients with ischemic heart disease and those with brain injury (e.g. after traumatic brain injury or stroke). Lidocaine is also theorized to blunt a rise in intracranial pressure during laryngoscopy, although this remains controversial and its use varies greatly. Atropine may be used to prevent a reflex bradycardia from vagal stimulation during laryngoscopy, especially in young children and infants. Despite their common use, such adjunctive medications have not been demonstrated to improve outcomes. =Positioning= Positioning involves bringing the axes of the mouth, pharynx, and larynx into alignment, leading to what's called the \\"sniffing\\" position. The sniffing position can be achieved by placing a rolled towel underneath the head and neck, effectively extending the head and flexing the neck. You are at proper alignment when the ear is inline with the sternum. As described by Brian Arthur Sellick in 1961, cricoid pressure (alternatively known as Sellick's maneuver) may be used to occlude the esophagus with the goal of preventing aspiration. =Placement of tube= During this stage, laryngoscopy is performed to visualize the glottis. Modern practice involves the passing of a ‘Bougie’, a thin tube, passed the vocal cords and over which the endotracheal tube is then passed. The bougie is then removed and an inbuilt cuff at the end of the tube is inflated, (via a thin secondary tube and a syringe), to hold it in place and prevent aspiration of stomach contents. The position of the tube in the trachea can be confirmed in a number of ways, including observing increasing end tidal carbon dioxide, auscultation of both lungs and stomach, chest movement, and misting of the tube. =Postintubation management= Malpositioning of the endotracheal tube (in a bronchus, above the glottis, or in the esophagus) should be excluded by confirmation of end tidal CO2, auscultation and observation of bilateral chest rise. One important difference between RSI and routine tracheal intubation is that the practitioner does not typically manually assist the ventilation of the lungs after the onset of general anesthesia and cessation of breathing, until the trachea has been intubated and the cuff has been inflated. Additional considerations Age can play a role in whether or not the procedure is warranted, and is commonly needed in younger persons. The clinician that performs RSI must be skilled in tracheal intubation and also in bag valve mask ventilation. Alternative airway management devices must be immediately available, in the event the trachea cannot be intubated using conventional techniques. Such devices include the combitube and the laryngeal mask airway. Invasive techniques such as cricothyrotomy must also be available in the event of inability to intubate the trachea by conventional techniques. RSI is mainly used to intubate patients at high risk of aspiration, mostly due to a full stomach as commonly seen in a trauma setting. Bag ventilation causes distention of stomach which can induce vomiting, so this phase must be quick. The patient is given a sedative and paralytic agent, usually midazolam / suxamethonium / propofol and intubation is quickly attempted with minimal or no manual ventilation. The patient is assessed for predictable intubation difficulties. Laryngoscope blades and endotracheal tubes smaller than would be used in a non-emergency setting are selected. If the patient on initial assessment is found to have a difficult airway, RSI is contraindicated since a failed RSI attempt will leave no option but to ventilate the patient on bag and mask which can lead to vomiting. For these challenging cases, awake fiberoptic intubation is usually preferred. Controversy Since the introduction of RSI, there has been controversy regarding virtually every aspect of this technique, including: *choice of intravenous hypnotic agents as well as their dosage and timing of administration *dosage and timing of administration of neuromuscular blocking agents *avoidance of manual ventilation before tracheal intubation *optimal position and whether the head- up, head-down, or horizontal supine position is the safest for induction of anesthesia in full-stomach patients *application of cricoid pressure, which is also referred to as the Sellick maneuver.

It was also a former Roman Catholic bishopric. Lutheran diocese Diocese of Växjö is situated in southern Sweden and includes most of the county of Jönköping at its north end, the southern and central parts of the county of Kalmar, the island of Öland in the east, the county of Kronoberg in the south, and a small part of the county of Halland in the west. The diocese consists of 249 parishes, and has the highest church attendance in Sweden.The Making of Regions of Germany and Sweden The city of Växjö is the site of the episcopal see of Diocese of Växjö. In the twelfth century, the construction of Växjö Cathedral was begun and hence Växjö grew to become an important religious centre in the Diocese of Växjö. Saint Sigfrid allegedly lived and died in Växjö, and was buried in the cathedral at his death. Former Catholic diocese The ancient episcopal see of Växjö comprised the regions Värend and Njudung in Småland. Its patron saint was Saint Sigfrid, who in 1158 was canonized by Adrian IV:s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Ancient See of Vexiö and his shrine was, until the Protestant Reformation, the glory of the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist and St. Sigfrid at Vexiö. He had no immediate successors and in 1126 King Sigurd Jorsalafarer of Norway led a crusade to Småland to Christianize its inhabitants. Little is known about the origin of the diocese. It may have been Danish, or it may have broken loose from the diocese of Linköping between 1164 and 1170. The second bishop was Stenar, who is mentioned in two letters dating from 1183. In 1191 he quarreled with the Bishop of Linköping concerning the frontiers of their respective dioceses. Stenar was succeeded in 1193 by John Ehrengisleson. In 1205 the biography of St. Sigfrid was written. Bishop Gregory (about 1241), or his successor, renewed the boundary dispute with the Bishop of Linköping, which was settled by the pope in 1248 or 1249. Bishop Bo (1287–91) appealed in a dispute to the Archbishop of Lund, which was regarded as an insult to the Archbishop of Upsala. Conflict was averted by Bo's death and a declaration of obedience to the Archbishop of Upsala, issued by the chapter of Vexiö. The most famous of the later bishops was Nicolaus Ragvaldi (1426–38), present at the Council of Basle, and in 1438 translated to Upsala. The last Roman Catholic bishop was Ingemar Petri (consecrated 1495), who, by judicious concessions, remained at Vexiö until his death in 1530. He took no part in episcopal consecrations during Gustav I Vasa's reign, when the Catholic hierarchy was replaced by the Lutheran state religion. The chapter of Vexiö consisted of dean, archdeacon, subdean and eleven prebendaries. There was also a schoolmaster. The cathedral was burnt down in 1740 and rebuilt in 1755. There were apparently no religious houses in the diocese.

Each story is accompanied by commentary by the author, who gives details about his life and his literary achievements in the period in which he wrote the story, effectively amounting to a sort of autobiography for the years 1938 to 1949. (The book was followed by Before the Golden Age in 1974 and Buy Jupiter and Other Stories in 1975, which also included autobiographical material.) The book is dedicated to John W.

In the commentary throughout the book, he notes that eleven of those stories were never sold and were eventually lost. However two of the \\"lost\\" stories were found and published decades later (after The Early Asimov had been published). * \\"Cosmic Corkscrew\\", Asimov's first story, was written between 29 May 1937 and 19 June 1938. The story, 9000 words long, was about a man who traveled into the future to find the Earth recently deserted. Due to the quantum nature of time, he could not travel back in time a short distance to find out what happened. Asimov submitted it on 21 June to John W. Campbell, editor of Astounding Science Fiction, who rejected it. The story never sold and was eventually lost. * \\"This Irrational Planet\\", Asimov's fourth story, was written in August 1938. Thirty-four years later, all Asimov could recall of the story was that the irrational planet was almost certainly Earth, and that it was 3000 words long. Asimov submitted the story to Thrilling Wonder Stories on August 25, and it was rejected on 24 September. It was subsequently rejected by Astounding and five other magazines, never sold, and was eventually lost. * \\"The Weapon\\", Asimov's sixth story, was written in September 1938. It was rejected several times before being accepted by Super Science Stories, appearing in the May 1942 issue under the pseudonym H. B. Ogden. Thirty years later, Asimov had quite forgotten about its publication, and he listed it among his lost stories in The Early Asimov. He discovered its publication while writing his autobiography In Memory Yet Green (1979) and included it in chapter 30 of that book. * \\"Paths of Destiny\\", Asimov's seventh story, was written in October 1938. Asimov submitted it to Astounding on 28 October, but Campbell rejected it as \\"hackneyed\\". It never sold and was eventually lost. Thirty-four years later, Asimov could remember nothing about the story. * \\"Knossos in its Glory\\", Asimov's eighth story, was written in November 1938. The story was an attempt to retell the Theseus myth in science fiction terms. Asimov submitted the story to Astounding on 22 November, and it was rejected. He then submitted it to Charles D. Hornig, editor of Science Fiction , on 7 May 1939; Hornig rejected it two days later. It never sold and was eventually lost. * \\"The Decline and Fall\\", Asimov's twelfth story, was written in February 1939. Asimov submitted it to Astounding on 21 February, and it was rejected four days later. The story \\"made the rounds\\" as Asimov put it, never sold, and was eventually lost. Thirty-three years later, Asimov could remember nothing about the story. * \\"Life Before Birth\\", Asimov's seventeenth story, was written in the summer of 1939. Asimov submitted it to Unknown on 11 July, and it was rejected eight days later. It was also rejected by Weird Tales, never sold, and was eventually lost. Thirty-three years later, Asimov could remember nothing about \\"Life Before Birth\\" except that it was a fantasy story. * \\"The Brothers\\", Asimov's eighteenth story, was written between 11 September and early October. The story was about two brothers, one good and one evil, one of whom was constructing a scientific invention. Asimov submitted it to Astounding on 5 October, and it was rejected six days later. After making the rounds, the story never sold and was eventually lost. * \\"The Oak\\", Asimov's twenty-second story, was written in the summer of 1940. The story was a fantasy about an oak tree that served as an oracle and delivered ambiguous statements. Asimov submitted it to Unknown on 16 July, and it was rejected. Asimov then submitted it to Weird Tales, which also rejected it. The story never sold and was eventually lost. * \\"Masks\\", Asimov's twenty-ninth story, was written on 3 February 1941. Asimov submitted it to Unknown on 10 February, and it was rejected. The story never sold and was eventually lost. Twenty-nine years later, Asimov could remember nothing about \\"Masks\\" except that it was a 1500-word fantasy. * \\"Big Game\\", Asimov's thirty-ninth story, was written on 17 November 1941. Campbell wanted to create a category of short-short science fiction tall tales called \\"Probability Zero\\" that would serve as a market for beginning writers, and he asked Asimov to write one for him. The 1000-word \\"Big Game\\" was Asimov's first effort, and Campbell rejected it. Asimov subsequently submitted \\"Big Game\\" to Collier's Weekly in 1944, resulting in another rejection. After expanding the story to 3000 words and retitling it \\"The Hunted\\", Asimov submitted it to Thrilling Wonder Stories on 30 October 1946, resulting in yet another rejection; submission of the expanded version to Astounding resulted in still another rejection. After that, both versions of the story disappeared, and Asimov recorded \\"Big Game\\" as lost. However, after publication of The Early Asimov, a fan named Matthew Bruce Tepper found a copy of the original version among Asimov's papers at Boston University, and Asimov finally published the story in the anthology Before the Golden Age.

It is a relatively new parish, being elevated to this status when the former parish of Bretanha was divided, forming Ajuda and Pilar da Bretanha. The population in 2011 was 661,Instituto Nacional de Estatística in an area of 7.09 km².Eurostat It contains the localities Ajuda da Bretanha, Amoreira and Lombinha. History Church of Nossa Senhora da Ajuda, Ajuda da Bretanha, São Miguel There still exists some controversy relative to the origin of Bretanha in the local lexicon. The parish received its name from the original Bretanha of the older parish, and in accordance with popular tradition, it was adopted by the local Portuguese colonists to refer to the original settlers of the area. It is assumed that the area was originally inhabited between the end of the 15th Century and/or the beginning of the 16th Century.Direcção Regional das Comunidades (2010), p.10 During this period the concentration of colonists from Great Britain, or Brittany, may have led to the local designation. Even today, the area that was the parish of Bretanha is populated by people whose ethnicity are mistaken for British nationals (skin, eye or hair colors primarily), and where the local dialect is punctuated by diction and intonations reminiscent of French. When the area of Ajuda was de-annexed to form the current administration the name was adopted; a compound phrase which means: Ajuda from [the former parish of] Bretanha. Until 1527, Bretanha was actually part of a much larger parish known as Capelas. The parochial church is dedicated to the invocation of Nossa Senhora da Ajuda, and referenced in Gaspar Frutuoso's Saudades da Terra. Constructed at the end of the 18th Century (1770 specifically), it was constructed on the site of an older church constructed of straw, two centuries before. It is a church designed in the typical Baroque-style of the older generations, that includes a symmetrical front-facade, and bell tower; its interior consists of an ample sacristy, with a baptismal fountain constructed of pumice. An ancient image of Nossa Senhora da Ajuda, holding the Christ Child, has survived many years, and is sheltered in this church. Further, the original organ in the church was produced by Silvestre Serrão, organist at the Church of Santa Maria de Belém (Jerónimos Monastery), in Lisbon, who would construct various organs for churches in the Azores, such as in Santo António and Capelas, in addition to the Churches of São Sebastião and São Pedro in Ponta Delgada. Originally (until 1960), Bretanha consisted of the three parishes of Remédios, Ajuda and Pilar. But, on 13 December 1960, Remédios was deannexed (under Decree 43/392) to form its own parish. On 12 June 2002, following a survey of the populations of Bretanha and existing territorial requirements, the civil parishes of Ajuda and Pilar were created from the extinction of the historical parish of Bretanha.ALRA (2002), p.1 On the 25 February 2008, the official heraldry and coat-of-arms were officially presented by president of the Junta Freguesia.DRA (6 November 2008), p.45856 Geography The parish borders the crater of Sete Cidades to the south and Atlantic Ocean to the north, falls between Mosteiros and Pilar da Bretanha; coastal cliffs dominate the ocean border, while sloping towards the crater (an area that includes mostly forested tracts and pasture-lands). On its creation, Ajuda da Bretanha was defined in the following terms: its northern border included the maritime coast; its southern frontier the Cumeeiras das Sete Cidades; to the east along the border with Remédios, classified under Decree Law 43/392 (13 December 1960); and to the west, along a line that begins at the coast and follows coincident with the waters of the Grota da Lomba Grande, to the south, following the Grota da Lomba Grande and the service access of the Caminho da Lomba Grande, following this road east until it intersects the Lomba Grande once more.ALRA (2002), p.2 Continuing south, the frontier accompanies the same margin and Caminho da Lomba Grande until the Cumeeiras das Sete Cidades. Economy A farmer along one of the interior rural roadways leading to pastures in Bretanha The economy of the parish is driven by agriculture and dairy-raising, although forestry does occur in the interior. In addition, a small commercial and tourist economy does exist in this community, although the economy is more subsistence oriented then the remaining parishes in Ponta Delgada. Architecture =Civic= * Windmill of Pico Vermelho (), re-inaugurated on 13 August 2013, the windmill was reopened to the public after a period of remodelling, as part of a local tourist initiative for the civil parish, the windmill was an important part of the agricultural history of the community. =Religious= * Church of Nossa Senhora da Ajuda (), little is known of the history of this temple, except what could be gathered from its clergy; its first vicar was Afonso de Sampaio (began his service in 1527), and until 1640/1646 the church was dedicated to Nossa Senhora da Natividade (Our Lady of the Nativity). In 1634, Gaspar de Carvalho was vicar, receiving payment of money and three-and- a-half moios of wheat in compensation, a pattern that was repeated by 1730, when António da Silva e Sousa received similar compensation in wheat. Around 1737, the clergy that occupied this temple spent considerable funds to decorate the church. Culture =Festivities= During the month of August, Ajuda celebrates the feast of Nossa Senhora dos Anjos, with its principal religious ceremonies on August 15. From the parochial church, apart from celebrating masses in Her honor, a typical religious procession winds through the roads in the parish, accompanied by the traditional philharmonic bands. In addition, the tradition festivals from the Divine Holy Spirit are celebrated annually from the beginning of May to the end of June in the traditional impérios of the parish. At the beginning of the year, the feast day of Saint Anthony the Great is also celebrated on January 17.

From there, he transfers to Spetsnaz and, from there, into the GRU proper. A combination of circumstances leads to his eventual defection to the British.

File:Bhadrayasha coin.jpgCoin of Bhadayasa, an imitation of the proposed Zoilos IIII. =Indo-Scythian imitations= The Indo-Scythian king Bhadayasa also copied coins of Zoilos II, or the hypothetical Zoilos III, only mentioning his own name on the Kharoshthi legend of his coins. Monograms Many of the monograms on the coins of Zoilos II are in Kharoshti, indicating that they were probably made by an Indian moneyer. This is a characteristic of several of the Indo-Greek kings of the eastern Punjab, such as Strato I, Apollodotus II, and sometimes Apollophanes and Dionysios. Furthermore, the monogram is often identical on their coins, indicating that the moneyer, or the place of mint, were the same. The coins of Zoilos II combine Greek monograms with Kharoshthi ones, indicating that some of the celators may have been native Indians. The Kharoshthi monograms are the letters for: sti, ji, ra, ga, gri, ha, stri, ri, bu, a, di, stra, and śi. The \\"Apollo and tripod\\" and \\"Elephant and tripod\\" types only have Kharoshthi monograms, while the portrait types usually have combinations of Greek and Kharoshthi monograms. The monogram 62 (below) has been shown to be the last Indo-Greek monogram, and only appears on the younger portraits that may belong to Zoilus III.

It is used as a strong base and has been widely accepted due to its good solubility in non-polar organic solvents and non-nucleophilic nature. It is a colorless solid, but is usually generated and observed only in solution. It was first prepared by Hamell and Levine in 1950 along with several other hindered lithium diorganylamides to effect the deprotonation of esters at the α position without attack of the carbonyl group. Preparation and structure LDA dimer with THF coordinated to Li centers. LDA is commonly formed by treating a cooled (0 to −78 °C) tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution of diisopropylamine with n-butyllithium. When dissociated, the diisopropylamide anion can become protonated to form diisopropylamine. Diisopropylamine has a pKa value of 36. Therefore, its conjugate base is suitable for the deprotonation of compounds with greater acidity, importantly, such weakly acidic compounds (carbon acids) of the type R2CHZ, where Z = C(O)R', CO2R' or CN. Conventional protic functional groups such as alcohols and carboxylic acids are of course readily deprotonated. Like most organolithium reagents, LDA is not a salt, but is highly polar. It forms aggregates in solution, with the extent of aggregation depending on the nature of the solvent. In THF its structure is primarily that of a solvated dimer. In nonpolar solvents such as toluene, it forms a temperature-dependent oligomer equilibrium. At room temperature trimers and tetramers are the most likely structures. With decreasing temperature the aggregation extends to pentameric and higher oligomeric structures. Solid LDA is pyrophoric,MSDS at Sigma- Aldrich but its solutions are generally not. As such it is commercially available as a solution in polar aprotic solvents such as THF and ether; however, for small scale use (less than 50 mmol), it is common and more cost effective to prepare LDA in situ. Deprotonation using LDA . Kinetic vs thermodynamic bases The deprotonation of carbon acids can proceed with either kinetic or thermodynamic reaction control. Kinetic controlled deprotonation requires a base that is sterically hindered and strong enough to remove the proton irreversibly. For example, in the case of phenylacetone, deprotonation can produce two different enolates. LDA has been shown to deprotonate the methyl group, which is the kinetic course of the deprotonation. To ensure the production of the kinetic product, a slight excess (1.1 equiv) of lithium diisopropylamide is used, and the ketone is added to the base at –78 °C. Because the ketone is quickly and quantitatively converted to the enolate and base is present in excess at all times, the ketone is unable to act as a proton shuttle to catalyze the gradual formation of the thermodynamic product. A weaker base such as an alkoxide, which reversibly deprotonates the substrate, affords the more thermodynamically stable benzylic enolate. An alternative to the weaker base is to use a strong base which is present at a lower concentration than the ketone. For instance, with a slurry of sodium hydride in THF or dimethylformamide (DMF), the base only reacts at the solution-solid interface. A ketone molecule might be deprotonated at the kinetic site. This enolate may then encounter other ketones and the thermodynamic enolate will form through the exchange of protons, even in an aprotic solvent which does not contain hydronium ions. LDA can, however, act as a nucleophile under certain conditions.

Its main ingredients are typically brown sugar, corn syrup (or molasses or golden syrup in the Commonwealth of Nations) and baking soda, sometimes with an acid such as vinegar. The baking soda and acid react to form carbon dioxide which is trapped in the highly viscous mixture. When acid is not used, thermal decomposition of the baking soda releases carbon dioxide. The sponge-like structure is formed while the sugar is liquid, then the toffee sets hard. The candy goes by a variety of names and regional variants. Owing to its relatively simple recipe and quick preparation time, in some regions it is often made at home, and is a popular recipe for children.

Summary Amsterdam is the story of a euthanasia pact between two friends, a composer and a newspaper editor, whose relationship spins into disaster. Plot At the funeral of photographer and writer Molly Lane, three of Molly's former lovers converge. They include newspaper editor Vernon Halliday and composer Clive Linley who are old friends, and British Foreign Secretary Julian Garmony. Clive and Vernon muse upon Molly's death from an unspecified rapid-onset brain disease that left her helpless and in the clutches of her husband, George Lane, whom they both despise. Neither man can understand her attraction to Julian Garmony, the right-wing Foreign Secretary who is about to challenge his party's leadership. Shortly after Molly's death, Clive, who is single, begins to ponder what would happen to him if he began to decline in health. He reaches out to Vernon and asks him to perform euthanasia on him should he ever reach that point. Vernon reluctantly agrees on the condition that Clive do the same for him. Vernon, whose newspaper is in decline, is given a tip by George, a series of private photographs taken by Molly of Garmony cross-dressing. Vernon decides to use the scandal to unseat Garmony, whose politics he disagrees with. He faces pushback from his editorial staff and the board members of his newspaper about publishing the clearly private pictures. Seeking comfort he brings up the matter to Clive who vehemently disagrees with Vernon's decision to publish. After their argument, Clive, who has been commissioned to write a symphony for the forthcoming millennium, takes a retreat to the Lake District which has inspired him before. While hiking he comes across a woman being attacked by a man. Rather than intervene, Clive leaves the scene to finish composing the end melody of his symphony. He then returns to his hotel and abruptly leaves for home. The day that Vernon's paper is due to publish the pictures of Garmony, Vernon reaches out to Clive and the two have a brief conversation where they forgive their differences and Clive tells Vernon what he saw in the Lake District. At work, during an editorial meeting, Vernon realizes that one of his journalists is tracking the story of a rapist in the Lake District and realizes that this is who Clive must have seen. He calls Clive and attempts to force him to go to the police, though Clive declines as he is working on his symphony. Their conversation is interrupted by Garmony's wife holding a press conference where she calls Vernon a flea and calls the pictures a private personal matter, while pretending that she was aware Molly took them. Public opinion turns against Vernon and his paper and he is forced to resign. Angered by their conversation, Clive sends Vernon a note telling him he should be fired, which Vernon sees after he is fired and views as Clive gloating. He then calls the police to force Clive to give information about the Lake District rapist but is disappointed that Clive will not face criminal charges. Inspired by an article on euthanasia that he sees in his old paper, Vernon decides to lure Clive to Amsterdam and murder him under the grounds he is mentally unwell. Meanwhile, the composition of Clive's symphony is interrupted by the police calling him to the Lake District. With the symphony permanently ruined, Clive also makes the decision to try and lure Vernon to Amsterdam, where he is rehearsing his symphony, to euthanize him on the grounds he is mentally depraved. Both of the murders go through and each man last hallucinates seeing Molly Lane. Garmony and George Lane are sent out to retrieve the bodies, Garmony on behalf of the government for Clive and George on behalf of Vernon's widow, Mandy. They are under the impression it is a double suicide, caused in part because Clive's symphony was a dud and ends on a heavy plagiarism of \\"Ode to Joy\\". Garmony learns it was actually a double murder and informs George, who is pleased. George reflects on the fact that two of Molly's former lovers are dead and Garmony, despite having weathered the scandal, will never be able to rise in the party. He contemplates asking out Vernon's widow Mandy. Reception The novel was well received by critics. In The New York Times, critic Michiko Kakutani called Amsterdam \\"a dark tour de force, a morality fable, disguised as a psychological thriller.\\"Michiko Kakutani, \\"'Amsterdam': Dark Tour De Force,\\" The New York Times, 1 December 1998.

In The New York Times Book Review, critic William H. Pritchard called the book a \\"well-oiled machine, and McEwan's pleasure in time-shifting, presenting events out of their temporal order (flashing back in Clive's mind, say, to a conversation he had the day before) is everywhere evident. Vladimir Nabokov, asked whether sometimes his characters didn't break free of his control, replied that they were galley slaves, kept severely under his thumb at all times. McEwan follows this prescription in spades.\\"William H. Pritchard, \\"Publish and Perish,\\" The New York Times Book Review, 27 December 1998. Awards Amsterdam received the 1998 Booker Prize.

He broadcast a programme on the BBC from the mid-1990s focusing on Birmingham's history. In 1990, he was contracted to lecture at the University of Birmingham, where he subsequently became a full professor in 2002. During this year he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for his \\"services to local history and to charities.\\" Early life Chinn was born at Sorrento Hospital in Moseley, Birmingham. His father, Alfred (died 26 April 2010), was known as \\"Buck\\" and was a notable football supporter and local activist from Sparkbrook. His mother, Sylvia, was known as \\"Sylvie\\" and was from Aston. Chinn grew up in Birmingham and was educated at Moseley School and the University of Birmingham. Career Chinn initially followed his father and grandfather into bookmaking before entering academia, gaining his PhD in 1986. His work in the community made him a popular figure, and in 1994 he was invited by the Birmingham Evening Mail to write a two-page feature on local history. This proved extremely popular and Chinn wrote a weekly column for the paper until 2016. Chinn held the position of Professor of Community History at the University of Birmingham until 2015 and is now Emeritus Professor. He was also Director of the Birmingham Lives multimedia archive at UoB (formerly at South Birmingham College). He is the author of over 30 books on the history of Birmingham and the urban working class in England. He often appears on local television programmes such as Midlands Today; and wrote a weekly local history column for the Express & Star. He presented a weekly radio programme on BBC WM from 1994 until it was axed in 2013. He has made three videos and provided spoken links on two CDs of songs about Birmingham. In 2000 Chinn was a leading figure in the temporarily successful, but eventually doomed, campaign to save the Longbridge car factory from closure. In 2001 he was awarded the MBE for services to local history and charity. When the rebuilt Bull Ring was opened in 2003 Chinn criticised it for the lack of concern its developers and planners had shown towards market traders who had been the mainstay of the Bull Ring for the 800 years up to 1964, when the much-criticised previous shopping centre was built on the site. Chinn has also been prominent in the campaigns to save the last back-to-back houses in Birmingham, now a National Trust museum in Inge Street; and for a memorial to the victims of the Second World War Blitz on the city, sited in Edgbaston Street in the Bull Ring. In October 2007 he became patron of the St John's Church Preservation Group, which is campaigning for the reopening of St John's Church, Dudley. In December 2010 he appeared on Ian Hislop's BBC television show Age of the Do- Gooders, in which he championed George Dawson; a \\"non-conformist preacher, and a bit of a showman\\". He has also appeared on the BBC's Question Time. Politics In the 1980s he was briefly a member of the Social Democratic Party, which broke from Labour in protest at its perceived leftward shift, and later went on to merge with the Liberal Party to form the Liberal Democrats. He stood in the 1983 general election in Birmingham Sparkbrook as an independent, campaigning for import controls to protect local industry, and more investment in council housing. He came last with 281 votes (0.9%). Personal life Chinn married Kathleen Doyle in 1978: they have a son and three daughters, one of whom, Tara, has sung professionally on stage with her father. Chinn is a supporter of Aston Villa FCBrummies (video), Carl Chinn & Malcolm Stent, Pennslake Productions, 1995 and has a season ticket at Villa Park.

Earlier scholars like Professor Ahmad Hasan Dani have dated Dionysius much earlier, between the years 115 and 100 BCE, making him the ruler of the Swat and Dir Valleys and the weak successor of Polyxenos. Dionysios was probably pressured by the invasions of the Indo- Scythians, and also had to deal with Hippostratos, a more important king who had inherited the western part of the kingdom of Apollodotus II.

The \\"boxy\\" mint mark characteristic of later Indo-Greek kings was first used by Dionysios Soter. Dionysios was the first in the line of late kings who issued only silver drachms, but no tetradrachms, which was likely due to his limited resources. On their obverse is a diademed portrait of the king, with Athena Alkidemos on the reverse. He also issued bronzes with Apollo on the reverse and a tripod on the obverse. Both these types were inherited from Apollodotus II. The quality of the portraits is inferior to most earlier kings.

It was held annually in winter, trading with tea and fur brought along the Siberian trakt from Asia. As Thomas Wallace Knox (1835–96) writes in his book Overland through Asia; Pictures of Siberian, Chinese, and Tatar Life (1870): :We met many sledges laden with goods en route to the fair which takes place every February at Irbit. This fair is of great importance to Siberia, and attracts merchants from all the region west of Tomsk. From forty to fifty million rubles worth of goods are exchanged there during the four weeks devoted to traffic. The commodities from Siberia are chiefly furs and tea, those from Europe comprise a great many articles. Irbit is on the Asiatic side of the Ural mountains, about two hundred versts northeast of Ekaterineburg. It is a place of little consequence except during the time of the fair. The fair dominated the town and shaped its architecture and layout. Long, narrow dormitories are a feature of the old town with enormous wharf areas being found at the juncture of the Nitsa and Irbit rivers. With the interruptions to the fair following the October Revolution and Russian Civil War and the effects of the Trans-Siberian Railway on trade, the fair ceased in 1929 and the town lost its importance as an agricultural and trade center. There have been recent attempts to revive the fair in August as a regional trade show. Irbit is now home to the annual Irbit Bike Show which takes place the last weekend of July.

History The Newfoundland (and Landseer) are descended from dogs used by fishermen in the Newfoundland and Labrador region of Canada, it is believed these dogs are descended from water dogs and livestock guardian dogs imported by Portuguese and Basque fishing vessels with possible crosses to indigenous dogs. In the Victorian era black and white Newfoundland dogs were more popular than the solid black coloration, and they were the subject of a number of 19th century artists including Sydenham Edwards, Philip Reinagle, Samuel Jones and most famously Edwin Landseer, the name Landseer was used to describe black and white Newfoundlands as early as 1896. In the 20th century the solid black coloration became more popular and supplanted the bi- colored animals, so much so that in the 1930s a concerted effort was made to recreate the dogs seen in the paintings of Landseer, the efforts of these breeders resulting in the Landseer breed. In Great Britain and North America Landseer colored dogs are considered a variety of the Newfoundland breed, but in 1976 a separate breed club for Landseer colored dogs was created in Germany, similar clubs soon followed in Belgium and Holland and now they are considered a separate breed in continental Europe with separate Fédération Cynologique Internationale recognition. Genetics The Landseer's black and white coloration arises from the recessive piebald color allele found in Newfoundlands, the piebald coloration is a recessive trait so a single litter can have both Landseer and solid-colored puppies, depending on the genotype of the parents. With this split in recognition gradual differences in appearance began to appear between the two forms, the European form is taller with longer legs and less bulk, and a longer more tapered head, its coat is said to be curlier whilst the Newfoundland's is said to be wavier. A study in 2015 found a special gene in Landseers with muscle dystrophy called COL6A1 that could provide researchers with important information that can lead to a vaccine for the disease overall.

The design was a development of the Rolls-Royce RZ.1 rocket engine, which had in turn been a development by Rolls-Royce of the Rocketdyne S-3D.. Rolls-Royce, Ansty was the design authority. Two variants of this engine were developed: the first provided a static thrust of and the second (intended for the three stage satellite launch vehicle) . The engines could be vectored by seven degrees in flight for guidance. Some disconnected facts for arrangement: The Efflux chamber of the engine was made of nickel tubes brazed together through which flowed kerosene down one tube and back up the adjacent tube via a manifold at the mouth of the chamber. After static firings, these chambers were checked by climbing inside the engine from beneath. The mouth was in diameter but that of the throat was smaller, which restricted access to the inspector. In addition, during firing, the inside of the chamber became coated with fine carbon, making inspection a filthy procedure. However, the chamber required careful inspection because firing would occasionally create small holes in the walls. At the head of the chamber was the injector plate with concentric circles of LOX and kerosene injectors arranged in such a way that the liquids jets hit one another, like on like. The outer ring, of kerosene injectors helped cool the tubes that formed the chamber walls. From memory, the LOX pressure was and the kerosene . The start sequence was as follows: -10 secs The start tanks were pressurized. -7.5 secs The blade valves opened to allow fuel and oxidant to flow to the gas generator and on to the pump turbines. These turbines accelerated from 0 to 30,000 rpm in 32 ms and drove pumps through a 6 to 1 reduction gearbox which forced the propellants into the engines. -4 s main engine burn commenced. -2.5 s Full thrust was achieved. 0 s Vehicle release. Lift off was required to be at 1.3 g to enable the ground equipment to be cleared. Bearing in mind the nature of the autopilot the vehicle tended to rotate about its long axis and move laterally at release as a result of standing small corrections implemented through the vectoring of the engines. With the RZ2 Mk 3 developing of thrust this meant that the all up weight of the vehicle at lift off was about . Because of the limited gain change abilities of the autopilot, as the weight of the vehicle fell the corrections applied by vectoring the engines were more vigorous; at lighter weights and even on ground tests the engines were seen not to be entirely rigid as the mouth of the chamber moved slightly after the corrections were applied by the hydraulic rams. These rams were fed by hydraulic fluid at about . The dynamic pressure at the chamber mouth was about .

Ronald Bryan Ginn, known as 'Bo' Ginn (May 31, 1934 – January 6, 2005), represented Georgia's 1st congressional district in the United States House of Representatives. Ginn was born in Morgan, Georgia and attended Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College in Tifton, Georgia from 1951 through 1953 and Georgia Southern College in Statesboro where he earned a degree in 1956. He was considered a champion baseball player as a youth, but was stricken by crippling polio as a teenager and was told he would never walk again. Surgery, long months of therapy at the Warm Springs Foundation, and a strong determination allowed him to leave his wheelchair. This experience and the encouragement from others ultimately led him to a career in public service. Ginn served as administrative assistant to U.S. Senator Herman Talmadge and U.S. Congressman George Elliott Hagan. He successfully ran against Hagan as a Democrat to win the 1st District congressional seat in 1972 to the 93rd United States Congress. He served five consecutive terms in that seat before stepping down to run for Governor of Georgia in 1982.  Political career  Ginn went to Washington in 1961 as chief aide to U.S. Rep. G. Elliott Hagan, and then served as the chief aide to U.S. Sen. Herman E. Talmadge. In 1971, Ginn returned to Georgia to resume a career in business and to explore the prospect of running for Congress. He was elected in 1972, and served five consecutive terms representing the First District, encompassing 20 counties in the southeast section of the state, including all of the Georgia coast. At the time of his retirement from Congress, Ginn had become a senior member of the House Committee on Appropriations, and was chairman of the powerful Military Construction Subcommittee with authority for U.S. military ba se construction world- wide. He had sought the Appropriations Committee assignment after fighting off the near-closure of Fort Stewart and Hunter Army Airfield in the early 1970s, and used his committee position to preside over a massive construction program for the Stewart- Hunter facilities that would later become the home base of the 3rd Infantry Division. Ginn is also credited with facilitating the construction of the Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base in Camden County, and led Congressional efforts to bring the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) to Glynn County, which is now the county's largest employer. In addition, he was a staunch advocate for MARTA in Atlanta, and an ardent supporter of national interests that brought jobs and economic development to Georgia such as Lockheed's C-5 A aircraft program. Ginn also was an early leader in environmental preservation issues in Georgia. He was the prime author of legislation that led to a protected wilderness designation for the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge, the Blackbeard Island and Wolf Island National Wildlife Refuges, and large portions of Cumberland Island National Seashore. He decided to leave Congress in 1982 to run for governor to succeed George Busbee, who was stepping down after eight years in office. The Democratic runoff election was a classic confrontation between Joe Frank Harris, who ran as a conservative promising no tax increases under any circumstances, and Ginn, who wanted to pursue a more progressive agenda for the state's future. In the 1982 Georgia gubernatorial election, Ginn lost in the primary to Harris, who went on to win the general and serve two terms in office. His political career over, he founded the Ginn & Eddington lobbying firm in Washington, D.C. and later moved to Augusta, Georgia to be closer to his children.

Magnolia Springs State Park  In 1988, the Millen National Fish Hatchery at Magnolia Springs State Park was named in honor of Ginn. The state park was a project of the Civilian Conservation Corps opened in 1939 in Jenkins County, midway between Augusta and Savannah and had been the location of Camp Lawton, a prisoner of war center during the Civil War. The Fish and Wildlife Service opened the hatchery in 1950 and operated it until 1996 when it was unable to continue funding the center and transferred control to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. The state of Georgia operated the hatchery and adjacent aquarium until 2009 when the Jenkins County Development Authority assumed operation of the hatchery for one year, but was unable to fund the aquarium. Ginn's wife Gloria died in 1998; Ginn was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2003 and succumbed to the disease on January 6, 2005. He was survived by three children, and seven grandchildren.

In the , Ascot had a population of 5,777 people.  Geography  Ascot is characterised by large Queenslander homes and is located approximately north- east of Brisbane GPO. Ascot is best known for its beautiful old homes, the picturesque poinciana tree lined shopping area of Racecourse Road (), and for the Eagle Farm () and Doomben () racecourses popular for racing carnivals. Over a third of the suburb is taken up by Doomben and its related outer buildings, Eagle Farm and Doomben racecourses. Bartleys Hill is in the south- west of the suburb () and is above sea level.  History  Historically, the land was occupied by the Aboriginal Turrbal clan. The Turrbal called the area Yowoggerra, meaning Corroboree Place. The clan had camping grounds on the north side of the Brisbane River around the Breakfast Creek area. It was at Breakfast Creek that explorers Oxley and Cunningham met members of the clan in 1824. The clan was often called the ‘Duke of York’s clan’ by whites. In 1858 two Aborigines, Dalinkua and Dalpie from the Breakfast Creek area, wrote letters to The Moreton Bay Courier protesting against the treatment their people. Convicts were used in the 1830s to clear land and build basic roads. Within a decade wealthy free settlers took land with a view of the Brisbane River. In 1855, pastoralist James Sutherland purchased a large portion of land in the Brisbane area, including Ascot and its surrounds. He built one of Ascot's surviving and historically listed homes, Windermere. Bartleys Hill was named after writer Nehemiah Bartley who owned land in the area. The Eagle Farm Racecourse was established in 1863. Horse racing was one of the earliest sports in Brisbane and the name \\"Ascot\\" was given to the suburb as a tongue-in cheek reference to Ascot, England, and its prestigious Ascot Racecourse. There were racing stables throughout the suburb until the late 1920s. St Margaret's Anglican Girls' School opened on 1895. Ascot State School opened on 24 May 1920. Ascot One Teacher State School opened on 22 October 1934 as a teacher- training school in the grounds of Ascot State School. It was to prepare teachers for teaching in Queensland's many one-teacher schools in rural areas. It closed in 1973.\\"Nyrambla\\" 21 Henry Street, Ascot, from Yabba Street, in its early days During World War II, several buildings were used by General Douglas MacArthur and the Central Bureau, which had its headquarters at \\"Nyrambla\\", 21 Henry Street. In July 1942, MacArthur moved his headquarters to Queen Street in Brisbane city. The Central Bureau work of intercepting and decoding Japanese intelligence remained in Ascot. Also used was the fire station at 77 Kitchener Road and several other locations in nearby Hamilton. In 1941 military authorities took over the racecourse, then known as Camp Ascot, to house thousands of American troops. Camp Ascot was home to several US units, including the 2nd battalion of the 131st Field Artillery Regiment and the 35th Fighter Group comprising the 39th, 40th and 41st Fighter Squadrons and Headquarters Squadron. From the 1990s the old servants' quarters of \\"Nyrambla\\" were home to the late Australian actor Bille Brown (1952-2013), honorary ambassador for Queensland for his stage work in the Queensland Theatre Company in Brisbane and the Royal Shakespeare Company. The population in Ascot was 4,545 in 2001. The 2006 census recorded 5,330 residents and in 2011 the number decreased to 5,165. In the , Ascot had a population of 5,777 people.

Transport Aerial view of the Riverview Terrace area of Ascot Due to the popularity of the horse races, in 1882 a railway line branch was extended from Eagle Junction to the Eagle Farm Racecourse in Ascot. In 1899 the first electric tram service was extended to Ascot. Trams which ran from Hamilton along Racecourse Road, Lancaster Road and terminated in Alexandra Road continued until 1969. Ascot railway station () and Doomben railway station () provide access to Citytrain services.  Education  Ascot has a kindergarten in Kitchener Road and a preschool in Barlow Street. Ascot State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at Pringle Street ().

Early life Arms of the Earl of Douglas and Mar Pennon of James Douglas, Earl of Douglas. He was the eldest son and heir of William Douglas, 1st Earl of Douglas and Margaret, Countess of Mar. By the time his father had made over lands in Liddesdale to him in 1380, he had been knighted, being known as Sir James Douglas of Liddesdale.Maxwell, vol I, p.99 Earlier his father had been in dispute with King Robert over the latter's succession to King David II, but returned to royal favour by concluding a marriage contract between his son and the Princess Isabel, thus binding the Douglas family close to the throne.Maxwell, vol I, p87-9 Earl of Douglas and Mar In May 1384, the 1st Earl of Douglas died from a fever, and his son inherited.Maxwell, vol. I, p.93 Around the same time a French embassy arrived in Scotland to negotiate a truce between the Franco-Scots Allies and England. While deliberations were taking place in Edinburgh, a further party of French knights arrived at Montrose. These adventurers led by Geoffroi de Charny, sent word to the court at Edinburgh, from Perth where they had marched to, in which they offered their services against the EnglishMaxwell, vol. I p.100 The new Earl of Douglas, and Sir David Lindsay mustered their men and joined forces with the French knights. They then led a raid into England where they ravaged lands belonging to the Percy Earl of Northumberland, and the Mowbray Earl of Nottingham.Maxwell, vol I, p100 While this Chevauchée was happening, the Scots agreed to the tripartite truce on 7 July which was to last until May the following year. De Charny and his knights returned to France but promised to Douglas that they would return as soon as possible. In 1385 when the truce expired, Douglas made war on the English.Parliament records, 17 June 1385 The French were as good as their word and had previously arrived at Leith with a contingent of Chivalry, armour and monies. The French under Jean de Vienne, Admiral of France joined forces with the Scots. Finding that the army of Richard II of England was numerically superior to the Franco-Scots, Douglas allowed the English to advance to Edinburgh, wisely refusing battle, the English army destroyed the Abbies of Melrose, Newbattle and Dryburgh, as well as burning the burgh of Haddington and the capital itself. Douglas contented himself with a destructive counter-raid on Carlisle and Durham, leading the French, and the men of Galloway, under his cousin Archibald the Grim. Disputes soon arose between the allies, and the French returned home at the end of the year. 1386 saw squabbling between the Earl of Northumberland, and John Neville, 3rd Baron Neville de Raby over the wardenship of the Eastern March. Roger de Clifford, 5th Baron de Clifford, the warden of the Western March, was engaged to keep the peace between the rivals. While Clifford was away from his duties in the west, Douglas accompanied by the Earl of Fife led a force deep into Cumberland, and raided and burnt the town of Cockermouth.Maxwell, vol I, p105 Otterburn and death right right =Invasion of England= In 1388 Richard II had domestic troubles with his recalcitrant barons and was occupied far to the south, and the time seemed right for invasion to avenge the destruction of 1385. The Scots, following an agreement made between the nobility at Aberdeen, mustered at Jedburgh in August, including the levies of the earls of Fife, March, Moray and those of Archibald the Grim. Upon finding from an English spy, that the English warden Percy was aware of the muster, and was planning a counter strike, the Scots command decided to split the army, with Fife leading the main body into Cumberland, while a smaller mounted force under Douglas was to go east and despoil Northumberland. Douglas' force entered England through Redesdale and proceeded south to Brancepeth laying waste to the countryside. From there the turned east to encircle Newcastle. Newcastle was held by Northumberland's sons, Sir Henry Percy, known as \\"Hotspur\\", and his brother Sir Ralph Percy. Northumberland himself remained at Alnwick Castle, hoping to outflank Douglas should he attempt to return to Scotland. The Scots, without the siege equipment to invest the Castle, encamped around it. The week that followed saw constant skirmishes and challenges to single combat between the two sides, that culminated when Douglas challenged Hotspur to a duel. In the ensuing joust Douglas successfully felled Hotspur and was able to capture his pennon. According to Froissart, Douglas announced that he would \\"carry [the pennon] to Scotland and hoist it on my tower, where it may be seen from afar\\", to which Hotspur retorted \\"By God! You will never leave Northumberland alive with that.\\" =Battle of Otterburn= Wounded Douglass in the battle field The following day the Scots struck camp and marched to Ponteland where they destroyed its castle, and then on to Otterburn just 30 miles from Newcastle, Douglas appeared to be tarrying to see whether Hotspur would react. Douglas chose his encampment in a wood with an eye to protect his force from English archery. But on the evening of the 5 August, the Percies surprised the Scots and a bloody moonlit battle ensued. Douglas was mortally wounded during the fight, but because of the confusion of fighting in darkness this fact was not transmitted to his men who carried on the battle. Froissart gives account in detail of the various individuals wounded, captured or killed, but what is known is that the Scots won the encounter taking Hotspur and many others prisoner. Douglas' body was found on the field the following day. The Scots, albeit saddened by the loss of their leader, were heartened enough by the victory, to frighten off English reinforcements led by Walter Skirlaw, the Bishop of Durham the following day. Douglas' body was then removed back across the Border and he was interred at Melrose Abbey. The battle, as narrated by Jean Froissart, forms the basis of the English and Scottish ballads The Ballad of Chevy Chase and The Battle of Otterburn. Marriage and issue Douglas married Isabel, a daughter of King Robert II of Scotland. He left no legitimate male issue. His natural sons William and Archibald became the ancestors of the families of Douglas of Drumlanrig (see Marquess of Queensberry) and Douglas of Cavers. His sister Isabel inherited the lands and earldom of Mar, and the unentailed estates of Douglas. Isabel arranged for the Bonjedward estate to be passed to their half-sister, Margaret, who became 1st Laird of Bonjedward. The earldom and entailed estates of Douglas reverted by the patent of 1358 to Archibald Douglas, called \\"The Grim\\", cousin of the 1st Earl and a natural son of The \\"Good\\" Sir James Douglas.

Primarily known for her work in Hindi films, she has also appeared in Tamil, Telugu, Bengali and English films. Basu is the recipient of numerous accolades, including one Filmfare Award. Particularly known for her work in the thriller and horror film genres, she is frequently cited in the media as a sex symbol. Born in Delhi and raised in Kolkata, Basu won the Godrej Cinthol Supermodel contest in 1996, and later pursued a successful career as a fashion model. She then began receiving offers for film roles, and made her acting debut with a negative role in the moderately successful thriller Ajnabee (2001), which won her the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut. Basu's first leading role was in the blockbuster horror film Raaz (2002), which earned her a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress. She subsequently received worldwide critical recognition and several awards for her portrayals of a seductress in the 2003 erotic thriller Jism and the 2006 drama Corporate. Basu achieved further success with starring roles in six of India's annually top-grossing productions—the comedies No Entry (2005), Phir Hera Pheri (2006), and All the Best: Fun Begins (2009), the action adventure Dhoom 2 (2006), the action thriller Race (2008) and the horror thriller Raaz 3D (2012).

In Delhi, Basu lived at Pamposh Enclave, Nehru Place, till the age of eight and studied at Apeejay High School. Her family then shifted to Kolkata, where she attended Bhavan's Gangabux Kanoria Vidyamandir, located in Bidhannagar. In her school, Basu was appointed as the head girl and was fondly called 'Lady Goonda' due to her short and commanding personality. She remarked \\"As a child, I was a tomboy and I was pampered a lot, due to which I became very naughty. I used to keep a stick in my hand and straighten out all the colony boys if they acted smart. I used to be very short as a child and I was the monitor in school. When the tall boys would be up to mischief, I'd jump on their back during breaks and pull their hair and beat them up\\". Basu was enrolled in medical science studies until twelfth standard, but switched to commerce thereafter. In 1996, Basu was spotted at a hotel in Kolkata by the model Mehr Jesia Rampal, who suggested she take up modelling. That year, she participated in and eventually won the Godrej Cinthol Supermodel Contest (organised by Ford), thereby representing India at Ford Models Supermodel of the World contest in Miami. She later appeared in the Calida commercial with her then- boyfriend Dino Morea, which was controversial for picturing them sultrily; she had some protesters outside her house after that. With appearance on several magazine covers, Basu continued to pursue a career in fashion modeling during her late teens, until she became an actress. Acting career =Debut: 2001–02= One of the judges of the Godrej Cinthol Supermodel Contest in which Basu participated, Vinod Khanna, wanted to launch her alongside his son Akshaye Khanna in Himalay Putra, but she felt she was too young and declined the role, which eventually went to Anjala Zaveri.

However, the film was cancelled, and Dutta instead changed the script and made Refugee with Kareena Kapoor. Basu was also offered a role in Refugee opposite Sunil Shetty, which she declined. In 2001, Basu finally made her debut opposite Akshay Kumar in Vijay Galani's Ajnabee. The film, directed by Abbas-Mustan, was inspired by the American film Consenting Adults. It was a moderate box-office success and attracted unfavorable reviews from critics. However, Basu's performance in a negative role was appreciated by critics and won her the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut. In 2002, Basu starred in the year's most successful thriller, Raaz. Directed by Vikram Bhatt, it established Basu in the Hindi film industry. Her portrayal of a woman who is pursued by a spirit received positive reviews. One review in The Tribune noted, \\"... it is Bipasha Basu who steals the show with her fine performance.\\" She was nominated for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress for Raaz. She was appreciated in a supporting role in Sanjay Gadhvi's Mere Yaar Ki Shaadi Hai, a moderate critical and commercial success. However, in David Dhawan's Chor Machaaye Shor, was her first commercial failure. She appeared in a supporting role opposite Mahesh Babu and Lisa Ray in the Telugu film, Takkari Donga. Gunaah, which released later that year, was also a box- office failure. She played the role of a cop who loves a convict and tries to reform him.

She played the role of seductive, ambitious wife of a millionaire who indulges in an extramarital affair with an alcoholic lawyer and plots to kill her husband. The film ranked 92 in the top 100 sexiest movie scenes poll conducted by Channel 4. Film critic Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama commented, \\"... the real show stealer is Bipasha Basu; her sexy look and seductive deep voice, in contrast with her cold and calculating personality, makes her the most impressive femme fatale since Zeenat Aman and Parveen Babi.\\" She received a Filmfare Best Villain Award nomination for Jism. Her next release, Zameen, failed to make impact among audiences. Basu had four releases in 2004, all of which performed moderately and drew mixed reviews. She collaborated for the second time with Vikram Bhatt in her first release Aetbaar. She played the role of a young woman who falls in love with a psychopath. Rediff.com noted that \\"... The characters are not convincing, the plot is not fast-paced or interesting.\\" Her next film was Mani Shankar's Rudraksh, based on the Indian epic Ramayana. The film was a disaster at the box office and was panned by the critics. She then starred in Rakht as a tarot card reader trying to solve a murder mystery. Critic Shruti Bhasin of Planetbollywood wrote, \\"Bipasha Basu impresses in a different look and role.\\" Her final release that year was Anil Sharma's Madhoshi opposite John Abraham.

Taran Adarsh commented, \\"As an actor, she [Bipasha Basu] does show sparks only towards the end.\\" She starred in the Tamil film, Sachein, which was a hit and then in Prakash Jha's Apaharan, which won the National Film Award for Best Screenplay. In this period, she refused to act in art films due to salary problems. Besides acting, Basu did the video \\"Tu\\" for Sonu Nigam's album, Kismat. She made a guest appearance in Jay Sean's music video \\"Stolen\\". =2005–09= Basu established herself as an actress with the success of No Entry, Corporate and Dhoom 2.

She earned a Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress nomination for the film. 2006 saw her star in four major releases — Phir Hera Pheri, Corporate, Omkara and Dhoom 2 — performing well critically and commercially. Phir Hera Pheri became the ninth highest-grossing film of the year. She was featured opposite Akshay Kumar in a significant role of a con woman who steals 10 million from the protagonists. In Madhur Bhandarkar's Corporate, she gave up her glamorous look for the role of a businesswoman who has no qualms in taking advantage of her sexuality to con the CEO of a rival company. She won accolades from critics for her performance. Critic Aparna wrote, \\"[...] she has done a fabulous job as an ambitious woman. The kind of shrewdness in a woman that she plays has never been seen before in India films.\\" She was nominated for the second time for Filmfare Best Actress Award. Basu at the launch of Filmfare in 2012 In Vishal Bharadwaj's adaptation of Othello, Omkara, Basu played the role of Bianca and was a cameo. She caught the attention of public with her dance number \\"Beedi\\", which was highly popular in India and overseas. Critic Rajeev Masand of CNN- IBN wrote, \\"... Bipasha Basu is brought in to lend oomph and she succeeds in doing just that.\\" Basu became the talk of the town for donning a bikini in Aditya Chopra's Dhoom 2. She reportedly ate only oranges for three days and trained hard to shoot the scene. Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India commented, \\"Aah Bipasha! Looks great, brings back the bikini to Bollywood, and gently slips into the shadows as a pretty accessory.\\" In 2007, Ronnie Screwvala's Dhan Dhana Dhan Goal performed below average at the box-office. The song picturised on John Abraham and Basu, \\"Billo Rani\\", became quite popular and earned her the nickname \\"Billo Rani\\", though equal credit must be given to Omkara in which her name was Billo Chamanbahar. In 2008, she teamed up once again with Abbas-Mustan for Race. She played the role of Sonia who is stuck in a love-triangle between two brothers (played by Saif Ali Khan and Akshaye Khanna) and, through the course, she murders one of them. The film grossed 680 million at the box office and was the fourth-biggest hit that year in India; it performed good enough overseas as well. Her performance was appreciated by critics with Taran Adarsh citing it as \\"her best work so far. She's superb.\\" Basu's work in Siddharth Anand's Bachna Ae Haseeno as a successful supermodel who finds it hard to forgive her ex-lover for betraying her earned her a second nomination for Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award and the film was a commercial success with it becoming a \\"Hit\\". She completed 2008 by appearing during the song \\"Phir Milenge Chalte Chalte\\" in Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi. Her first release in 2009, Aa Dekhen Zara failed to do well at the box office. Rohit Shetty's All The Best: Fun Begins performed well and her comic role was appreciated by fans. Later that year, Basu surprised everybody with Rituparno Ghosh's Bengali film, Shob Charitro Kalponik. \\"I love saris and I'm wearing a lot of them in Ritu's film,\\" she said. She gave up her glamorous look and was praised by critics for her performance. Critic Subhash K. Jha spoke high of her. He said, \\"Bipasha [Basu] pulls out all stops to deliver her career's best performance. Her moments of anguish before and after her screen-husband's death are expressed in tones of cathartic conviction that we never knew existed within Bipasha.\\" He also compared her with the multiple-award-winning actress, Shabana Azmi, commenting that Basu's anguished portrayal of bereavement can be equalled by Azmi only. =Recent work: 2010–present= IIFA 2015 Fashion Extravaganza' in 2015 With the 2010 film Pankh, Basu returned as an imaginary character who exists in the protagonist's mind. She was then featured as a Kashmiri girl in Rahul Dholakia's Lamhaa, which explored socio- political problems in Kashmir. Principal photography of Lamhaa was disrupted many times by the locals due to the controversial theme. During the shooting of Lamhaa, she left the sets at Anantnag and headed back to Mumbai citing she was afraid of the crowd there. Producer Bunty Walia thought of replacing her with Vidya Balan, but she returned for the shoot later with necessary security arrangements. NDTV Movies wrote, \\"Bipasha sinks herself into her character imparting a dramatic resonance into the role without resorting to stock expressions. The sequence where she gets mauled by militant women is as traumatic to watch as it must have been for Bipasha to shoot.\\" Basu then appeared as the wife of a ruthless cop in Priyadarshan's Aakrosh who helps the police with investigation on honour killings in their village. She met with mixed reviews for the film. Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India commented, \\"Bipasha actually doesn't have much to do and does seem to be miscast as the much-abused, bruised and battered wife of Paresh Rawal\\". Her only release in 2011 was Dum Maaro Dum, which performed reasonably well at the box office and met with good reviews from critics. Talking of the film, she said, \\"My next release is DMD Dum Maaro Dum, in which I play a lively, colourful, happy-go- lucky girl called Zoey, who is the representation of Goa as we see it.\\" Basu collaborated with Abbas-Mustan for the third time in Players, which became the first release of 2012. The film was an official remake of The Italian Job. Players was heavily compared to The Italian Job and was criticised for its execution and performances, including that of Basu. Her next release was Raaz 3, a supernatural horror thriller directed by Vikram Bhatt, upon release met with favourable response and emerging as a box office success after a period of relatively low phase for Basu. The movie not only became the highest grossing horror film, but also emerged a \\"blockbuster\\" with revenues of in India alone. Her performance in the film garnered acclaim from critics with Subhash K. Jha of IANS saying, \\"It's Bipasha who holds together the feverish proceedings. She delivers a full-bodied gutsy performance.\\" After appearing in a guest appearance in Race 2, where she reprised her role from the prequel, Basu was seen in the horror film Aatma which was directed by Suparn Verma and produced by Kumar Mangat and Abhishek Pathak. She received mixed reviews for the movie. Bipasha performed live alongside Atif Aslam, Shaan & Malaika Arora Khan for the first time in series of concerts in Birmingham & London in the summer 2013.

She was also seen in a horror film Creature 3D, which was again a box office failure. Basu had completed work on her first English film, Roland Joffé's epic drama The Lovers in which she portrayed a Maratha warrior. The film was released on 13 March 2015. In 2015, Basu featured in Bhushan Patel's romance horror film Alone opposite her future husband Karan Singh Grover. India TV reviewed the movie and wrote that, \\"With some genuine scary moments and Bipasha-Karan's scorching chemistry, Alone stands apart from numerous horrible horror flicks made in the past.\\" and also stated that, \\"Bipasha just takes her act to another level.\\" The film performed moderately well at the box office. As of 2020, Basu is committed to star opposite her husband Karan Singh Grover for the second time in crime drama web series Dangerous.

This included uranium used in the US atom bombs of World War II. Later in her active career she hauled barges on Great Slave Lake. The Radium King, and a sister ship, the Radium Queen, were built in the Manseau shipyards in Montreal. They were then disassembled and the pieces were loaded on flatcars for shipment by railroad to Waterways, Alberta, which was then the northern terminus of the North American railway grid, to be reassembled and launched on the Mackenzie River. It required nine flatcars to completely load all the parts of the vessel. The Radium King was staffed by a crew of 10, and could carry 10 passengers. The shipping season was short during the working lifetime of the Radium King. In 1942 she was to be the last vessel to make the round trip down the Mackenzie River, and had to leave on August 17, in order arrive back on time. On November 16, 1945, the Radium King and the Radium Express were caught by freeze up in Yellowknife. The Edmonton Journal reported in 1953 that the Radium King was the first vessel to cross Great Slave Lake—arriving in Yellowknife on June 8. While the lake's ice had broken up, it hadn't moved out. Northern Transportation added additional vessels to her fleet, many of which, like the Radium Charles and Radium Yellowknife also bore the prefix \\"Radium\\", and the line was known locally as the \\"Radium Line\\". In 1956 the Radium King survived the explosion of mining supplies on a barge she was towing. In 1959 noted English professor Hugh MacLennan described a trip he took down the Mackenzie on the Radium King for Maclean's magazine. He said the vessel was suddenly frozen in, on Great Slave Lake, for over a week, due to a sudden cold snap at the beginning of the shipping season in 1958. In 1967 the boat was retired. Currently she is on display outside the Northern Life Museum in Fort Smith, Northwest Territories. The Radium King was restored, and turned into a museum. In 2005 Atomic Energy of Canada published a study of the toxic legacy of the mining of radioactive ore at Port Radium. According to the report the Radium King and all the other surviving vessels of the Radium line were found to be free of contamination, with the exception of the Radium Gilbert.

This exhibit includes a Holt tractor that was brought north in 1919 to work the portage route between Fort Fitzgerald and Fort Smith. It also includes the Radium King, a vessel used first to haul uranium and radium ore and then later to push barges. The Northern Life Museum displays are built around 5 themes. It hosts displays of an authentic northern trading post, a typical northern kitchen from the 1940s, 2 mounted adult bison, a traditional trapper's cabin, a 1965 Polaris Sno-Traveler, and a river bank scene featuring a birch bark canoe. The Northern Life Museum also hosts a whooping crane display. The last remaining natural migratory flock of whooping cranes in the world nest in and around Wood Buffalo National Park. Canus was discovered as an injured chick by researchers in 1964. Unable to be released back into the wild, Canus (named after the joint CANadian/US effort) took up residence at Patuxent Wildlife Refuge in Maryland as the first participant in their new captive breeding program. The program enjoyed great success and Canus' contribution brought him international recognition. Canus was welcomed in 2004 as a part of the Northern Life Museum's permanent exhibits. The museum also hosts an outdoor aboriginal cultural Centre that showcases Canada's first peoples' ways of traditional living before European contact occurred in the early 1800s. It host as functional cold cache, smokehouse and tipi for public use. There is a virtual tour that can be found online, though the displays have changed significantly since this tour was posted.virtual tour Affiliations The Museum is affiliated with: CMA, CHIN, and Virtual Museum of Canada.

Fewer than 200 people are enrolled in the tribe.  Reservation  The Yavapai reservation is approximately in central Yavapai County in west-central Arizona. In the early 1930s, Sam Jimulla and his wife Viola Jimulla, with community support, pushed the government to provide reservation lands for the tribe, as they had been unable to secure federal funds for a housing project. In 1935, 75 acres of the former Fort Whipple, Arizona were set aside as a reservation. Continued pressure from the tribe resulted in an additional 1320 acres being conferred on the tribe in 1956.  Government  Simultaneously with the creation of a reservation, the government pressed for the Prescott Yavapai to accept the terms of the Indian Reorganization Act, but the tribe rejected the move away from a hereditary chief and confirmed the commissioner of Indian Affairs choice of Jimulla as their tribal leader. When Jimulla died in 1940, he was succeeded by his wife, though a tribal council was established. Don Mitchell, husband of Jimulla's daughter Grace, served as Chair of the tribal council from 1940 to 1948 and then tribal president from 1948 to 1972, though Viola served as Chieftess until her death. Grace Mitchell succeeded her parents as chieftess in 1967 and in 1972, Jimulla's granddaughter Patricia Ann McGee became tribal president. Upon Mitchell's death in 1976, the tribe conferred the title of chieftess upon Jimulla's other surviving daughter, Lucy Miller, and reconfirmed the dual governance system by retaining McGee as tribal president. Following Miller's 1984 death the tribal leadership was solely vested in the council and the tribal president. McGee retained the post until 1988, when she was ousted for two years by Stanhope \\"Stan\\" Rice, Jr. She regained leadership in 1990 and served until her death.

He is the son of the 27th premier, Joe Ghiz. On November 13, 2014 Ghiz announced he would be resigning as Premier in early 2015 as soon as the Liberal Party elected a new leader. Life and career Ghiz was born and raised in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, the son of Rose Ellen (born McGowan) and Joe Ghiz. He served in the Canadian Forces Primary Reserves, while attending high school in the early 1990s. He attended Bishop's University where he earned a bachelor's degree in political science; his father spoke at Ghiz's graduation. Ghiz moved to Ottawa following his father's death from cancer, where he worked as a political aide for Deputy Prime Minister Sheila Copps before joining the Bank of Nova Scotia in 1998. In 2001 Ghiz joined the office of Prime Minister Jean Chrétien where he served as Atlantic Canada advisor before leaving to run for leader of the Prince Edward Island Liberal Party in 2003. Politics In 2003, Ghiz narrowly defeated former provincial Health Minister Alan Buchanan for the leadership of the party and went on to win a seat in the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island in the 2003 provincial election. The MLA for Charlottetown-Rochford Square (now Charlottetown-Brighton) served as Leader of the Official Opposition in the provincial legislature from 2003–2007. Ghiz faced a controversy during the lead-up to the 2007 provincial election when he intervened in the nominating procedure in a rural electoral district northeast of Charlottetown. Ghiz refused to sign his party's nominating papers for the winning candidate who had made a controversial speech endorsing patronage. Ghiz led his party to power in the general election held on May 28, 2007, defeating Pat Binns after 11 years of Progressive Conservative government. Ghiz won 23 of the 27 seats, reversing the standings in the legislature at the time of dissolution. Ghiz and his 11-member cabinet were sworn in on June 12, 2007. A 24th member was elected in October in a by-election held after the resignation of Pat Binns. Ghiz's election resulted in the second time in the history of Prince Edward Island that a father-son team both became premier; the other pair (also Liberal) being Thane Campbell (1936–1943) and Alexander B. Campbell (1966–1978). On October 3, 2011 the Ghiz Liberals were elected to a second term, winning 22 of 27 seats. The PEI Progressive Conservative party under the leadership of Olive Crane won the remaining 5 seats. Following the 2011 provincial election Ghiz announced that he would find a high-level position for Allan Campbell, who had lost his seat during the election. Campbell was later appointed Chief of Staff in the Premier's Office. Ghiz resigned as Premier of Prince Edward Island on February 23, 2015. He was succeeded by the new Liberal Party leader, Wade MacLauchlan. He resigned his seat in the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island the next day. Life after politics In June 2016, Ghiz joined the international law firm Gowling WLG in a business advisory role. By November of the same year it was announced that he would step into the role vacated by former New Brunswick premier Bernard Lord when Ghiz was hired to take over the leadership as CEO of the Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association in the new year.

It was located within the Gila River Indian Reservation (over their objections) about southeast of Phoenix. With a peak population of 13,348, it became the fourth-largest city in the state, operating from May 1942 to November 16, 1945.  Internment  The rationale for internment was brought on under the pretext of sabotage of the West Coast by the large Japanese American population. Immediately following the attack on Pearl Harbor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066. This order was Roosevelt's authorization to hand authority to the Secretary of War and military commanders to designate areas to detain people living in the United States whom may be a threat to the country and its interests. Though it never specifically named Japanese Americans (or anyone of Japanese ancestry) to be detained, it was outwardly implied due to the outbreak of war with Japan. The Secretary of War was also told to supply accommodations to people who are held by the government. The order stated: \\"The Secretary of War is hereby authorized to provide for residents of any such area who are excluded therefrom, such transportation, food, shelter, and other accommodations as may be necessary\\". The order also gave authority of the prescribed areas to the Secretary of War ahead of other departments in the government and allowed the use of federal troops to enforce compliance with government rules in those areas. Placed in command of issuing the forced removal of Japanese Americans from their homes and businesses in the West Coast was commander of the Western Defense Command Lt. Gen. John L. DeWitt. The internment camps were hastily constructed within a few months after the issue of the order. Living quarters across all camps resembled military style barracks as they were constructed from military surplus equipment. Living space was generally tight and incredibly cramped among families. The forced removal of Japanese Americans from the \\"affected areas\\" of California, Oregon, Washington, and Arizona started from April to May 1942. Families were given just under one week to get their personal and professional affairs in order. As a result, individual families lost thousands of dollars from having to hastily sell off properties severely under market value. After the war, many Japanese Americans who were interned had to completely start over in building their businesses and livelihoods from scratch. In the 1980s, the federal government acknowledged that it had committed an injustice against Japanese Americans with this act. Congress passed the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, an official apology and authorization to provide restitution to survivors and descendants of inmates. In total 119,000 Americans of Japanese descent were incarcerated throughout World War II. Camp History Gila River War Relocation Center was one of ten internment camps, operated by the WRA located throughout the American interior west. The Gila River camp was one of two internment camps located in Arizona, the other being Poston War Relocation Center. Most camps including Gila River were chosen due to their solitary geographic locations, many of which were located in the middle of deserts. The camp was located on the Gila River Indian Reservation, near an irrigated agricultural center. It comprised two separate camps, named 'Canal' and 'Butte'. Construction began on May 1, 1942, over the strong objections of the reservation's Pima Indian government. The official opening took place less than two months later, on July 20. Canal Camp closed on September 28, 1945. Butte Camp was shut down on November 10, 1945; and the Gila River Relocation Center was officially closed on November 16, 1945. Gila River received incarcerees from California (Fresno, Sacramento, and Los Angeles). In addition, it took in 2,000 people from the Jerome War Relocation Center in Arkansas when that facility closed in 1944. It became Arizona's fourth-largest city, with a peak population of 13,348. Some of the incarcerees died en route to Gila River or shortly after arrival in the harsh desert environment. One of these was the mother of Iva Toguri. Toguri was an American woman of Japanese descent who broadcast for the Japanese and was later condemned as \\"Tokyo Rose\\"; she was convicted of treason, based on perjured testimony. Canal Camp Monument Gila River was considered one of the least oppressive camps of its kind. It had only a single watchtower, and its fences were among the few that lacked barbed wire. The administrators of the camps seemed to care for the incarcerees, and allowed them access to the amenities of Phoenix. Gila River was one of the first WRA camps to have a local \\"democratic\\" governing body of internees for the camp, supervised closely by the WRA. A representative of every block was nominated to the council however, only Nisei (second generation U.S born Japanese Americans) were allowed to hold the offices. They also encouraged recreational activities such as sports and arts. Butte camp contained a 6,000-seat baseball field, designed by Kenichi Zenimura, a professional baseball player, and considered to be the best in the WRA system. Incarcerees also built a theater for plays and films, and playgrounds, and planted trees to relieve the desolation of the arid site. Gila River had a communal medical facility at Butte Hospital. Canal Camp had 404 buildings with 232 barracks and 24 separate schoolhouses. Butte Camp contained 821 buildings with 627 residential barracks. These barracks were made of wood and fireproof shingles that were of limited effectiveness in blocking out the desert heat. Each barrack was made to house four single families in separate apartments. But, the camp exceeded its capacity: it was designed for 10,000 residents, and held more than 13,000. Because of this, some families were housed in the mess hall or recreation buildings, where they had to use hanging blankets as makeshift walls for visual privacy. Water shortages also plagued the camp. Inmates' encounters with poisonous rattlesnakes and scorpions resulted in bites that kept Butte Hospital extremely busy. The land for the camp sites is owned by the Gila River Indian Tribe and is considered sacred by them. They have restricted public access to the historic sites. All the main structures are long gone. Remaining are such elements as the road grid, concrete slab foundations, manholes, cisterns, several rock alignments, and dozens of small ponds. During the Ronald Reagan Administration, the federal government acknowledged that it had committed an injustice against Japanese Americans with this program. Congress passed a resolution of official apology and authorization to provide compensation to survivors and descendants of inmates. On December 21, 2006, President George W. Bush signed H.R. 1492 into law guaranteeing $38,000,000 in federal money to restore the Gila River relocation center, along with nine other former American concentration camps used to house Japanese Americans.

The line is not currently electrified, so Avanti West Coast, the current operator of the West Coast Partnership franchise, currently uses Class 221 Super Voyagers, which they have done since December 2007, on routes to Holyhead. The line contains several notable engineering structures, namely Conwy railway bridge across the River Conwy, and Britannia Bridge across the Menai Strait. History The first section from Crewe to Chester was built by the Chester and Crewe Railway and absorbed by the Grand Junction Railway shortly before opening in 1840. The remainder was built between 1844 and 1850 by the Chester and Holyhead Railway Company as the route of the Irish Mail services to Dublin. The line was later incorporated in the London and North Western Railway. Between Chester and Saltney Junction, the line was, from the start, used by trains of the Shrewsbury and Chester Railway later to be incorporated in the Great Western Railway. So important was the line in the 19th and early 20th centuries to passenger, mail and freight traffic between Britain and Ireland that the world's first experimental and operational water troughs were installed at Mochdre between Colwyn Bay and Llandudno Junction. Their purpose was to enable steam engines (especially on the Irish Mail) to collect water without stopping. Later, considerable stretches of line between Chester and Colwyn Bay were quadrupled to increase line capacity but these sections have now been reduced to two tracks. Main calling points The main towns served by the route are listed below: *Crewe *Chester **Wirral Line diverges to serve Birkenhead and Liverpool (Merseyrail) **Line diverges to serve Wrexham, Shrewsbury and Cardiff (via the Shrewsbury to Chester Line) *Shotton **The Borderlands Line from Wrexham to Bidston crosses at Shotton with interchange facilities. *Flint *Prestatyn *Rhyl *Abergele *Colwyn Bay *Llandudno Junction **Lines diverge to serve Blaenau Ffestiniog (via the Conwy Valley Line) and Llandudno *Conwy *Penmaenmawr *Llanfairfechan *Bangor *Llanfairpwll **Line diverges to Amlwch (Anglesey Central Railway, disused) *Bodorgan *Ty Croes *Rhosneigr *Valley **Freight from Wylfa nuclear power station is loaded at a depot in Valley *Holyhead Services Principal through passenger services are London Euston to Holyhead, Bangor, Chester and Wrexham General operated by Avanti West Coast and Crewe to Holyhead, Cardiff to Holyhead and Manchester to Llandudno currently operated by Transport for Wales Rail.

The Welsh Government would like the line to be electrified, especially if Crewe becomes a rail hub due to HS2 in 2026. Chancellor George Osborne said in July 2015 that there was a \\"really strong case\\" for electrification of the line. The Electrification Task Force said that the Chester to Crewe line was a Tier 2 priority for being electrified in the CP6 period (2019-2024).

This book, written with Giulio Tononi, is the culmination of a series of works by Gerald Edelman on the workings of the brain which include Neural Darwinism and Bright Air, Brilliant Fire. Precis It is divided into six sections: the first three cover existing work from philosophical, neurological and Darwinian perspectives. Part IV presents the novel thesis of the work: the Dynamic Core Hypothesis. The remaining two parts explore how it resolves various philosophical and practical issues. =The Background= Since Descartes, philosophers have been occupied with the concept of consciousness and its subjective nature has posed a special problem for science. Its nature arises from the neuronal structures in the brain and some understanding of these, together with the experimental tools needed to explore them, is given in the following chapters. They then recapitulate Edelman's still controversial theory of somatic selectionism during early development which controls the topology of a particular brain and enables restructuring in response to experience. They argue that memory is not a symbolic representation but a reflection of how the brain has changed its dynamics in order to achieve motor activity. This leads to a discussion of primary consciousness which integrates with perception into a means of directing immediate behavior and requires significant levels of reentrancy to achieve its effects. =The Dynamic Core Hypothesis= The problem of integrating, or binding, the activity of functionally segregated areas of the brain in order to concentrate attention on a particular activity in a short amount of time (typically 100-250 msecs) after the presentation of a stimulus is explored by means of large-scale simulations. It is shown that this can only happen if some elements interact more strongly among themselves than with the rest of the system including a large amount of reentrancy. These functional clusters are only slowly coming into the range of PET or fMRI scanning technology which commonly require much longer time scales. At any given time, only a small subset of the neuronal groups in the brain are contributing directly to consciousness and this cluster is called a dynamic core. It represents a single point of view and each different state of consciousness corresponds to a different subset. Some dissociative disorders such as schizophrenia may result in the formation of multiple cores. =Implications of the hypothesis= One of the recurring issues in consciousness is the existence of qualia, such as redness, warmth and pain. It is not enough to identify each quale with a particular neuron or neuronal group; what is crucial is all the other groups which are highly influenced by the sensation and will fire at the same time. Thus each conscious state deserves to be called a quale. A small perturbation of a group of neurons can affect the whole in a very short space of time provided the system is kept in a state of readiness by the thalamus. Primary consciousness can build up a bodily based reference space even before language and higher-order consciousness appear. There is a preliminary approach to the relationship between conscious and unconscious processes, including sensors and motors, because so little is known. The evolution of language centres in the brain leads to higher order consciousness which enhances subjective experience and enables humans to describe qualia which are however experienced by a much wider range of animals. Thinking in humans has a range of representations—including pictorial. In contrast to computers which are Turing machines, brains are based on neuronal group selection. Reviews John Cornwell (Sunday Times) One of the most thoughtful books on the topic... While revealing much that is surprising about consciousness, they confirm some deeply held convictions about the power and mystery of human imagination. Piero Scaruffi: The book advances a theory for what causes the conscious feeling that we experience, but fails to explain how matter can turn into feelings. For all the properties of consciousness that they list, the authors fail to grasp the essence of consciousness: I \\"feel\\" that I am myself. The results of this pioneering work challenge the conventional wisdom about consciousness.

Cal was ranked in the AP top 25 in each of Brien's seasons with the program, winning the Citrus Bowl in 1991 and the Alamo Bowl in 1993. Off the field, he was a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. He graduated with a B.A. degree in Political Economy of Industrial Societies (PEIS) in 1994. Professional career Brien was drafted in the 3rd round (85th overall) in the 1994 NFL draft. He was the only kicker to be taken during the draft and moved across the bay to join the San Francisco 49ers. Brien struggled during his rookie year, converting 15 of 20 field goals (20th of 28 qualified kickers) and 60 of 62 PATs (19th of 24 qualified kickers) for the 49ers. The 49ers, led by Steve Young, went on to win Super Bowl XXIX over the San Diego Chargers by a score of 49–26, a game in which Brien missed his only field goal attempt, a 47-yard try before halftime. Brien nonetheless set the record for most PATs during a single postseason with 17 (on 18 attempts) en route to earning a Super Bowl ring that season. Brien also had a fumble recovery during the NFC Championship game. The following year, Brien made only 58% of his field goals for San Francisco, and was cut after missing a potential game-winning field goal against the Indianapolis Colts. He signed a few weeks later with the New Orleans Saints. Brien went on to play a total of 12 seasons in the NFL for 7 different organizations including 6 seasons with the Saints. He was elected a team captain as well as the NFLPA player rep for the Saints. Over the course of his career, Brien was regarded as one of the most reliable kickers in the league. One huge exception to this was during the 2004 Divisional Playoff game in Pittsburgh against the Steelers. Brien missed two 4th-quarter field goals from 47 and 43 yards which would have won the game for the New York Jets. At the time of his retirement, he was one of the 10 most accurate field goal kickers of all time, and currently ranks 54th. During his career, Brien converted 80.2% of field goals and 98% of PATs. Brien accounted for 915 points over his 12-year career and has a career long make from 56 yards. After retirement After the conclusion of his NFL career, Brien co-founded a real estate investment firm, Waypoint Real Estate Group.

Linear Flash can also be read and written to by laptops and desktops with PC card slots, and is somewhat popular for sensitive data storage because the media is non-volatile and does not degrade over time. However, large-scale storage is impractical using Linear Flash because of small card sizes (typically under 40 megabytes) and prohibitive costs; megabyte-for-megabyte, Linear Flash cards are often dozens of times more expensive than ATA cards. Combined with file management software, such as Flash Translation Layer (FTL) or M-Systems TrueFFS Flash File System, the Linear Flash cards provide removable disk emulation.

Biography He was the son of Friedrich Gerstäcker (1790–1825), a celebrated opera singer. After being apprenticed to a commercial house, he learned farming in Saxony. In 1837, however, just younger than 21 and having imbibed from Robinson Crusoe a taste for adventure, he went to America and wandered over a large part of the United States, supporting himself by whatever work came to hand. He became fireman on a steamboat, deck hand, farmer, silversmith, and merchant. After wandering through most of the United States, spending some time as a hunter and trapper in the Indian territory, and in 1842 keeping a hotel at Point Coupée, Louisiana, he returned to Germany six adventurous years later in 1843. To his great surprise, he found himself famous as an author. His mother had shown his diary, which he regularly sent home, and which contained descriptions of his adventures in the New World, to the editor of the Rosen, who published them in that periodical. These sketches having found favour with the public, Gerstäcker issued them in 1844 under the title Streif- und Jagdzüge durch die Vereinigten Staaten von Nordamerika. In 1845 his first novel, Die Regulatoren in Arkansas, appeared marking the start of a successful writing career. Henceforth the stream of his productiveness flowed on uninterruptedly. From 1849 to 1852 Gerstäcker travelled round the world, visiting North and South America, Polynesia and Australia. He experienced the California gold rush, crossed the South Pacific on a whaler, and wandered through Australia and experienced a \\"gold rush\\" there. On his return to Germany, he settled in Leipzig. In 1860 he again went to South America, chiefly with a view to inspecting the German colonies there and reporting on the possibility of diverting the stream of German emigration in this direction. The result of his observations and experiences he recorded in Achtzehn Monate in Südamerika (1862). In 1862 he accompanied Duke Ernest of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to Egypt and Abyssinia, and on his return settled at Coburg, where he wrote a number of novels descriptive of the scenes he had visited. In 1867-1868 Gerstäcker again undertook a long journey, visiting North America, Venezuela and the West Indies. He visited Mexico right after the collapse of the Second Mexican Empire, a situation about which he wrote a few passages in one of his books.Neue Reisen in Nordamerika, Mexiko, Ecuador, Westindien und Venezuela (New Travels in North America, Mexico, Ecuador, the West Indies, and Venezuela). 3 Volumes, Jena 1868, p. 397. On his return lived first at Dresden and then at Brunswick. While preparing for a journey to India, China and Japan, he suffered a fatal cerebral haemorrhage on May 31, 1872. The widely traveled adventurer left an oeuvre of 44 volumes, which he edited himself for his Jena publisher H. Costenoble. His stories and novels inspired numerous imitators: Karl May profited from him and used landscape descriptions as well as subjects and characters. Even theatre and movie companies borrowed from his work: the critic George Jean Nathan credits the plot of the musical Brigadoon (1954) to Gerstäcker's short story Germelshausen, though this was denied by Lerner, the author of Brigadoon. The Friedrich-Gerstäcker-Gesellschaft e.V. (Fr. G. society) founded in 1978 in Braunschweig offers more information about Gerstäcker and runs a museum about his work. In 1957 Gerstäcker was made an honorary citizen of Arkansas.Paul Hühnerfeld: Der Ehrenbürger von Arkansas., in: Die Zeit Nr. 20 vom 16. Mai 1957News and Notices.

She played bass guitar for the British-Irish punk/folk band The Pogues from 1983 to 1986. She later played with Elvis Costello (her husband from 1986 to 2002) as well as several other projects. She goes by the name Rocky O'Riordan on social media and for her Sirius-XM radio show, \\"The Rocky O'Riordan Show\\". Biography Caitlín O'Riordan was born in Nigeria to Irish and Scottish parents, who moved to London when the Nigerian Civil War broke out in 1967. She heard The Nips' song \\"Gabrielle\\" on the radio in 1979, and subsequently met future Pogues' frontman Shane MacGowan, who was working at Rocks Off Records, where she went to purchase the record. In 1982, she was invited by MacGowan to join his newly forming band Pogue Mahone. She appeared on the group's first two albums, Red Roses for Me and Rum Sodomy & the Lash, the EP Poguetry in Motion, and several early singles, before leaving in 1986. Besides playing bass, she provided vocals for \\"I'm a Man You Don't Meet Every Day\\" on Rum Sodomy & the Lash, and for \\"Haunted\\" on the soundtrack to Alex Cox's film Sid and Nancy. The Pogues' most commercially successful song, \\"Fairytale of New York\\" from If I Should Fall from Grace with God, was written as a duet for O'Riordan and MacGowan, but the band eventually recorded it with Kirsty MacColl singing the female part. O'Riordan and Costello are mentioned in the lyrics to \\"Fiesta\\" from If I Should Fall from Grace with God. In 1983, she became the singer in Darryl Hunt's jazz band Pride of the Cross. Hunt had originally planned to ask Wendy May of the Boothill Foot Tappers to be the singer. When he told O'Riordan, she laughed at him and said she ought to do it. At the audition the band told her that she couldn't sing. During her time with Pride of the Cross, she sang lead on their only single, \\"Tommy's Blue Valentine\\". She acted in the 1987 Alex Cox film, Straight to Hell, as the singing dancehall girl Slim McMahon, and also in the 1988 Frank Deasy film The Courier. O'Riordan became involved with Elvis Costello in 1985, while he was producing the Pogues' album Rum Sodomy & the Lash; they married on 17 May 1986. Her former Pride of the Cross bandmate Darryl Hunt filled in for her on several shows during the Pogues' 1986 U.S. tour, and he replaced her permanently when she left later that year to join Costello on his King of America tour. She co-wrote the track \\"Lovable\\" from that album, and wrote, co-wrote, and appeared on songs on Costello's subsequent albums Blood & Chocolate, Spike and Mighty Like a Rose. O'Riordan and Costello divorced in 2002. In a 2008 interview with the Irish Independent, she denied ever having formally married Costello: \\"We weren't married...It was a kind of Muslim 'I divorce you' kind of thing.\\" In 2004, she joined Pogues' guitarist Phil Chevron's re-united band The Radiators; that year she toured with the Pogues for the first time in 18 years. She left the Radiators and was replaced in February 2006 by Jesse Booth, and went on to form a band of divorcées named PreNup with Hothouse Flowers guitarist Fiachna Ó Braonáin.Tipton, Gemma. \\"Interview with Cáit O'Riordan\\".

The abbey traces its history back to Moscow's first monastery established in the early 14th century at the location where the Danilov Monastery now stands. The \\"Church of the Savior in the Wood\\"(Собор Спаса на Бору, the oldest church of Moscow) of the Kremlin was its original katholikon. Upon its removal to the left bank of the Moskva River in 1491, the abbey was renamed Abbey of the New Savior, to distinguish it from the older one in the Kremlin. The monastery was patronized by Andrei Kobyla's descendants, including the Sheremetyev and Romanov boyars, and served as their burial vault. Among the last Romanovs buried in the monastery were Xenia Shestova (the mother of the first Romanov Tsar), Princess Tarakanova (a pretender who claimed to have been the only daughter of Empress Elisabeth) and Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia. In 1571 and 1591, the wooden citadel withstood repeated attacks of Crimean Tatars. Upon the Romanovs' ascension to the Moscovy throne, Michael of Russia completely rebuilt their family shrine in the 1640s. Apart from the large 18th-century bell-tower (one of the tallest in Moscow) and the Sheremetev sepulcher in the Church of the Sign, all other buildings date from that period. They include: *The Cathedral of the Transfiguration () (1645-49), a large five-domed katholikon with frescoes by the finest Muscovite painters of the 17th century. *The Intercession Church () or Church of the Veil of the Virgin (1673–1675) with a refectory *The Church of the Sign or Church of the Znamenie Icon of the Virgin (1791–1795) *The bell tower (1759–1785) *The infirmary Church of St. Nicholas the Miracle Worker and monks' living quarters *The house of Patriarch Filaret *The House of Loaf-Giving. The \\"New Monastery of the Savior\\" in 2012 During the Soviet years, the monastery was converted into a prison, then into a police drunk tank. In the 1970s, it was assigned to an art restoration institute, and finally returned to the Russian Orthodox church in 1991.

The branch passes through Romsey and the Dean valley; today part of its route forms the Eastleigh-Romsey line. A more direct route between Southampton and Romsey was adopted in 1865 on completion of the Sprat and Winkle Line (at first by the Andover and Redbridge Railway, but taken over by the LSWR before completion). This forms the current route of the Wessex Main Line: departing westbound from Southampton Central via Millbrook and Redbridge before branching north to Romsey. = North of Salisbury = The line through Wiltshire and Somerset was completed in stages, after the Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway (WS&WR;) was authorised by Parliament in 1845. The first section to be opened, in 1848, ran from Thingley junction to the west of Chippenham on the Great Western Railway, via Melksham and Trowbridge to Westbury. The WS&WR; company was unable to fund further construction, and in 1849 the directors decided to sell their line to the GWR. The GWR's branch to Salisbury from Westbury was completed through the Wylye valley in 1856, with the first section, as far as Warminster, having been opened in 1851. The route from a junction near Staverton, north of Trowbridge, to Bradford-on-Avon had been constructed in 1848 but the rails were not laid. This branch, via Bradford then along the Avon valley to join the GWR main line at Bathampton, was completed in 1857. = Across Salisbury = Further work was required at Salisbury to complete the Bristol-Southampton route, as the GWR station was in the west of the city at Fisherton, about away from the earlier LSWR station at Milford on the southeast side. In 1857 the LSWR's West of England line (London-Exeter via Basingstoke and Andover) arrived in northeast Salisbury, at first using the Midford station. In 1859 the LSWR opened a new station at Fisherton, immediately south of the GWR station, to serve two lines: the Andover line, which had been extended across the city, and the new Salisbury and Yeovil Railway towards Exeter. The Milford station was then closed to passengers. A transit shed was opened between the two Fisherton stations in 1860, to allow goods to be transferred between the GWR's broad gauge wagons and the LSWR's standard gauge. Following the conversion of the GWR to standard gauge in 1874, a connecting siding was built in 1878 to allow shunting of wagons. A direct route for passengers came into use with the inauguration of a Cardiff to Portsmouth service in 1896. = 20th century = At Salisbury, the LSWR station (which had been expanded in 1878) was further expanded and remodelled, with a large extension to the station building completed in 1902. The GWR station continued to be used by branch services until it was closed to passengers in 1932; it was used as a goods depot until 1991 and is now part of Salisbury Traincare Depot. Milford continued as a major goods depot until 1967. Westbury station was rebuilt in 1899 to cater for the Stert and Westbury Railway, opened 1900, which now forms part of the Reading-Taunton line. On the Chippenham branch, the halts at Beanacre and Broughton Gifford closed in 1955. The smaller stations on the Salisbury branch – Heytesbury, Codford, Wylye and Wilton North – closed to passengers in the same year, although in most cases goods service continued into the 1960s. In Hampshire, Nursling station closed in 1957. Bathampton and Limpley Stoke stations closed in 1966. The same year saw closure of the remaining local stations on the Chippenham branch: Lacock Halt, Beanacre Halt, , Holt (along with the entire Devizes branch) and Staverton Halt. The section of line between Thingley Jn and Bradford Junction continued to be used by freight trains and occasional passenger trains, such as during engineering works or summer excursions. A regular passenger service was reinstated in 1985 with the reopening of Melksham station.

In the film, Leigh played Sadie Flood, a punky barroom singer who has a complicated relationship with her older sister, Georgia, played by Winningham. Georgia is a successful, talented and well-adjusted folk music singer and a happily married mother of two. Sadie is passionate but self- destructive and untalented. While she seeks fame, she destroys herself through drug abuse. Georgia won the Grand Prix of the Americas Award for Best Picture at the Montreal World Film Festival. In addition, Leigh received Best Actress honors at the Montreal World Film Festival and the New York Film Critics Circle for her work in the film, and Winningham received an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actress as well as Best Supporting Actress nominations at the Academy Awards and from the Screen Actress Guild.

Leigh's mother, Barbara Turner, wrote the screenplay; Leigh and Turner co-produced it along with director Ulu Grosbard; and Mare Winningham, a longtime friend who had been Leigh's camp counselor during their teen years, co-starred. The music in the film consists of 13 songs; to create a realistic effect, Leigh and Winningham were both filmed singing live. The 13 songs included covers of songs by Gladys Knight & the Pips, Elvis Costello and Van Morrison. In the talked-about centerpiece of the film, Sadie drunkenly performs a raw, grueling cover of Morrison's \\"Take Me Back\\" in a ragged Janis Joplin-style gut howl at an AIDS benefit concert. John Doe of the band X played a supporting role and performed as a member of Sadie's band. Release and reception Georgia was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival. Georgia was released in the U.S. on December 8, 1995. It received a positive critical reception. Susan Wloszczyna of USA Today described the film as \\"a painful though sadly humorous portrait of sisterhood\\". Roger Ebert called the film \\"a complex, deeply knowledgeable story about a truly lost soul and her downward spiral\\" in his 3.5/4-star review. James Berardinelli of ReelViews praised it as “a tour de force for Leigh... there are times when it's uncomfortable to watch this performance because it's so powerful”, adding “Georgia doesn't possess an amazingly original narrative, but what distinguishes this picture is the depth of the characters and the amazing power with which the two leads breathe life into them.” Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote that “Leigh’s exceptional performance tears you apart… we’ve never seen anything like it before”, adding that \\"Georgia is not an easy film, but in the American independent arena, it outperforms everything in sight.” Jennifer Jason Leigh was voted the year’s Best Actress by the New York Film Critics Circle and at the Montreal World Film Festival, nominated for an Independent Spirit Award, and was widely predicted to receive her first Oscar nomination for the role. Surprisingly though, it was Mare Winningham who received an Oscar nomination (as well as an Independent Spirit Award and Screen Actors Guild nomination) as Best Supporting Actress, while Leigh was overlooked by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Speaking to MetroActive magazine, Winningham said: “I felt incredibly honored and touched to be nominated...But it was hard to be separated from Jennifer, because she was the heart and soul of that film. While we were making the movie, I thought not only that she would get a nomination, but that she would win. I saw the kind of work she was doing. In my mind she will always be the greatest performance of that year, and a lot of other people thought so, too. Meryl Streep grabbed me at the Academy Awards. She said, 'Jennifer should be here!' and I said, 'I know!'” The film performed poorly at the box office.

History  Her career started in 2002 with the release of her first single Beautiful Dreamer, a soft love ballad which did very well in the charts, and was later featured on the Relaxin’ with Japanese Lovers compilation album. Her first single was modestly successful, and it wasn't until the release of her album Geofu in the summer of 2003 that she gained recognition. Geofu did exceptionally well in the charts, scoring a number 4 position with more than 300,000 copies sold. Her first single after Geofu, \\"Rainbow\\" was used as the theme song for the Japanese drama Netsuretsuteki Chukahanten, and the other A-side song on that single, \\"breath ~Omoi no Youryō~\\" was used for the national promotion campaign of JFN Radio. She performs under Sony Music Japan's DefSTAR Records label. Her next big single \\"Glisten\\" was used in a make-up commercial for Menards products and did fairly well in the Japanese market. With this success, she gained even more popularity, and was asked to sing the end theme for the popular TBS animated series Fullmetal Alchemist, entitled \\"I Will\\", giving her an easy in with American fans. Because of \\"'I Will\\"', the two other songs included with her \\"I Will\\" single, \\"Candy Rain\\" and \\"Pearl Color ni Yurete\\", became popular among American fans.

In 1800 a prominent Colchester farmer, Pierpont Bacon,The New England Historical and Genealogical Register by Henry Fitz-Gilbert Waters, p. 78. died and left an endowment of thirty-five thousand dollars (with buying power equivalent to that of about two million dollars in 2009).Inflation Calculator, viewed January 23, 2011. The endowment was to the :inhabitants of the First Society of Colchester for the purpose of supporting and maintaining a school…for the instruction of Youth in Reading and writing English, in Arithmetic, Mathimaticks, and the Languages, or such other branches of Learning.Colchester Cemetery, Bigelow Society. This established the academy that bears his name. Bacon Academy's doors opened to the children of Colchester on the first of November 1803 and from that point forward, prepared many young men and women for the life that lay ahead. History In its early days, Bacon Academy had a reputation of preparing its students for accomplishment at universities and colleges around the country. Local children attended the school without charge for tuition. The status of the Academy was high in the minds of many prominent fathers of the nineteenth century. The trustees established an academic year of three terms: the first term started in September and ended in December, the second ran from January to April, and the third, from May to August. Early class rolls show that the number of local students would fall in planting and harvesting seasons, many students skipping semesters or returning either late in the first term or leaving early in the second and not attending the Academy at all during the third. Early Bacon students were neither given a diploma nor graduated after four years, as they generally are today. Instead, the school had a system divided into three branches. In the first branch, a young student learned such subjects as languages, English grammar, and mathematics. In the second branch, he or she would be taught writing, geometry, and rhetoric. The last branch was similar to the common or grammar school. Age never factored into a student's placement or progress; some students would leave Bacon at fifteen or sixteen if they had completed all three branches. In 1886, the branch structure was abandoned for the current four-year system; and by 1890, the first modern commencement was held, with each graduated student receiving a diploma. The school bell would toll at five-thirty in the morning during the first and third term and at seven in the winter for those in branches one and two, during which two scholars would be chosen each day to practice public speaking in front of instructors and other students. Following the speeches, the day would begin with the scholars from the common branch joining the others for the Morning Prayer. Afterward, the preceptor (the principal of the Academy) would talk about morals and the studies of his students. This routine was eliminated after 1846, and the bells were tolled only for the start of the school day. Life as a Bacon student was strict. The attitude of the scholar had to be forthright and that of a gentleman or lady. In or out of classes, each was to behave properly and dress neatly—or risk punishment by means of \\"reproof, correction, admonition, or expulsion.\\" While in class, all pupils would sit diligently at their desks and study the Greek or Latin classics. At home, students usually studied when not working on their fathers’ farms or doing chores for their boarding masters. After the centennial celebration, the national reputation of the school declined and the Academy drew its students chiefly from Colchester and surrounding towns. In time, Bacon became simply the public high school for the Town of Colchester. By 1962, the students had become too numerous for the then 160-year-old building on Main Street, and they were moved to a new schoolhouse adjacent to the grammar school. A major building spurt in the 1980s again impelled construction of a new high school, less than a mile east; the doors opened at the present site in 1993. Bacon Academy celebrated its bicentennary in 2003, commencing the celebration with a special concert by the Bacon Academy Bands led by director Thomas Kessler. Other events included an all-class reunion, a golf tournament, and an open house at each of the buildings that ever had housed the Academy. Sports On March 17, 2012, the varsity girls basketball team won the Class L State Championship with a 38-34 victory over top-seeded E.O. Smith at Mohegan Sun Arena. Head coach Dave Shea, a 1952 Bacon Academy graduate, won his 660th career game (331 with the girls) at Bacon Academy.

Passenger services run between London Waterloo station and Exeter; the line intersects with the Wessex Main Line at . Despite its historic title, it is not today's principal route from London to the West of England: Exeter and everywhere further west are reached more quickly from London Paddington via the Reading–Taunton line.  History  Once all sections had been incorporated into the London and South Western Railway, the sections and branches were: * Basingstoke to Salisbury ** Basingstoke to Andover, opened 3 July 1854 ** Andover to Salisbury, opened 1 May 1857 * Branches: **Basingstoke and Alton Light Railway opened June 1901, closed 30 May 1936 ** From Hurstbourne and Andover to Romsey and on to Eastleigh and Southampton: both closed. Link via Longparish opened 1 June 1885; closed 6 July 1931. ** At Andover, junction with the Midland and South Western Junction Railway to Cheltenham ** Bulford Camp branch ** Salisbury to Romsey, with a branch to Bournemouth ** At Salisbury, the Great Western Railway (GWR) line from Westbury and Bristol had its own terminus: the L&SWR; continued the route southeast towards Southampton. This route is known nowadays as the Wessex Main Line. *Between Salisbury and Exeter: ** Salisbury to Yeovil, opened 2 May 1859 ** Yeovil to Exeter, opened 19 July 1860 * Branches: ** To Yeovil Town (joint station with the GWR) ** To Chard (joint station with the GWR) ** To Lyme Regis from Axminster ** To Seaton from Seaton Junction (closed) ** To Sidmouth from Sidmouth Junction (also alternative route to Exmouth) ** To Exmouth from Exmouth Junction near Exeter British Rail downgraded the line by making long single-track sections west of Salisbury. This restricts the number of trains on this section, but passing loops have been added to alleviate this. Beyond Exeter, the line continued to Plymouth via Okehampton and Tavistock as the Exeter to Plymouth railway of the LSWR. This line is now partly closed, with the surviving sections downgraded to branch lines. The section from Exeter to Coleford Junction, near Yeoford, is still in existence as part of the Tarka Line (which continues to Barnstaple). The Dartmoor Railway still exists as a heritage line and industrial line from Coleford Junction to Okehampton, where the track breaks. Tavistock lacks a rail connection, and the final section of the original main line, from Bere Alston, continues to Plymouth as part of the Tamar Valley Line.  Route  Trains between London Waterloo and Exeter run on the South Western Main Line as far as . The West of England Line diverges at Worting Junction, a short distance west of Basingstoke. Network Rail splits the line into two sections: the first section from the line's start at Worting Junction to Wilton Junction (near Salisbury) is classified as \\"London & SE commuter\\", while the section from Wilton Junction to Exeter is a \\"secondary\\" route. The secondary route west of Salisbury is predominantly single track, but has three sections of double track and four passing loops. The double track sections and passing loops are: a loop just outside Tisbury station, a loop at Gillingham station, double track from Templecombe to Yeovil Junction, a loop at the former Chard Junction station, 3 miles of double track centred on Axminster, a loop at Honiton station, and double track from Pinhoe to Exeter. The line's speed limit is mainly 80–90 mph over its whole length from Basingstoke to Exeter. Speed is further limited around the junctions.

It lies roughly 120 km west of Brisbane in the middle of the Main Range National Park. It is just south of Cunninghams Gap and Mount Mitchell. Its summit height is approximately 1,205 metres (3953 ft). The only known track to the summit is through private land, although there is easy access across country through the national park from Spicers Gap Road. Access is possible with The Scenic Rim Trail by Spicers that provides a guided walk to the summit. The upper section of the Peak displays views as far back as Brisbane and encompasses a world heritage listed rainforest. The local Uragapul people call this mountain, Binkinjoora, meaning a turtle with its head sticking up. The name, Spicer's Gap, was given to the mountain by Allan Cunningham after Peter Beauclerk Spicer who was the Superintendent of convicts. Spicer had noted the peak while searching for escaped convicts. The peak is located just to the south of Spicers Gap which was once the main route between Brisbane and the Darling Downs.

She was born in Walldorf (Werra) in Thuringia. Danz was captured in 1945 and put on trial for crimes against humanity at the Auschwitz trial in Kraków, Poland. She was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1947, but released due to general amnesty on August 20, 1957. Camp work On January 24, 1943, at the age of 25, Danz was conscripted as an SS-Aufseherin within the Nazi concentration camp system at Ravensbrück. She served as guard in several camps in occupied Poland, including Majdanek (1943-April 1944), Kraków-Płaszów (April 1944), Auschwitz-Birkenau (May 1944-January 1945) and Malchow (subcamp of Ravensbrück). In 1943, she received an award from Nazi Germany for her camp service. From 1 March 1943, she completed a three-week guard course at the Ravensbrück concentration camp and was on March 22, 1943 transferred to the Majdanek concentration camp. There she oversaw the women's camp work details in the camp tailoring, kitchen, nursery and clothing store. During the evacuation of Majdanek at the end of April 1944, Danz was in the Plaszow concentration camp. Halina Nelken remembered her in Plaszow: \\"Danz, tall, slender, and with a gaunt, boyish face was a specialist in punching jaws with her fist and at the same time bringing her knee up into a stomach. The woman she was mistreating fainted immediately.\\"Halina Nelken, And Yet, I Am Here! (Gerlingen, Germany: Bleicher Verlag, 1996), pp 216-217 After the evacuation of Plaszow concentration camp Luise Danz was in Auschwitz-Birkenau in September or October 1944, where she oversaw a Jewish commando in the concentration camp laundry and led the leather detail as a Kommandofuhrerin, and eventually rose to the rank of Rapportfuhrerin in the camp for Hungarian Jewish women. After the evacuation of Auschwitz took place in January 1945, she was moved to Ravensbrück and on to its subcamp in Malchow. Danz became Oberaufseherin in Malchow in January 1945 upon her arrival and served in that capacity until the beginning of May 1945. In Malchow 900 female prisoners worked in Verwertchemie, the local explosives factory for recovery of chemicals work. Danz's behavior is said to have evolved according to statements of surviving prisoners of the different camps into that of a sadist. She severely abused prisoners, for example, with her bull whip. She also aided in the hanging of Russian women prisoners and hours-long prisoner roll calls which claimed many lives from exposure and exhaustion alone. Capture and trials for war crimes At the end of the war in May 1945, Danz tried to slip into obscurity, but was discovered, captured and arrested on 1 June 1945 in Lützow and tried by Poland at the Auschwitz Trial for crimes she had committed while on duty in the vast German camp system. At her 1947 trial, she was sentenced to life imprisonment, but was released early in 1956 after serving nine years. In 1947, survivor Mirosława Odi stated in the Municipal Court of Oświęcim that \\"As regards the defendant Luise Danz, I can state that the defendant was an SS woman and that she was very good, because she helped the prisoners and was punished for doing so three times with a 14-day long incarceration in the bunker. I know that this defendant used to turn a blind eye to all transgressions on the part of the prisoners. That SS woman worked for some time in the kitchen and later in the clothes sorting room.\\" In 1996, she was tried before a German court for the alleged murder of a teenager in the Malchow concentration camp. German doctors said the defendant was too old to be able to withstand court proceedings, so the charge was dropped.

The film was received favourably by critics and was a huge hit at the box office, solidifying Matondkar's position as a leading lady of Bollywood. Mohammad Ali Ikram of Planet Bollywood wrote, \\"Urmila Matondkar as Vidhya, an aspiring singer caught in the deceptive web of Satya's love, proves she is a multi-faceted actress. If in one movie this actress can be street- smart and sexy (Daud), the next minute she is convincingly conservative, innocent and docile\\". Suparn Verma of Rediff commented, \\"Urmila's role as the love interest in Satya's life is well defined and she plays it well, adding the touch of glamour, despite being clad in a sari throughout the film.\\" Satya was on CNN-IBN's 2013 list of the 100 greatest Indian films of all time, in the 100 Filmfare Days series and on the \\"70 iconic movies of independent India\\" list. It was mentioned in Rachel Dwyer's 100 Bollywood Films (where she called it a \\"masterpiece\\"), and in critic and author Shubhra Gupta's 50 Films That Changed Bollywood, 1995-2015. =Professional expansion and success (1999–2003)= In 1999, Matondkar had six film releases; four of them − Jaanam Samjha Karo, Hum Tum Pe Marte Hain, Mast and Dillagi − were commercial failures.

Her first hit that year was Varma's psychological horror thriller Kaun, opposite Manoj Bajpayee, where she played a nameless character. Khalid Mohamed of The Times of India (who would later cast her in Tehzeeb) wrote, \\"She rivets the viewer's interest, carrying off entire reels on her shoulders, through a gamut of quicksilver facial expressions. Vulnerable and baffled, she is utterly believable as the traumatised girl-next-door\\". Matondkar next played the love interest of Sanjay Dutt's character in the action comedy Khoobsurat. It emerged as a box-office hit. During the 2000s, Matondkar revealed strong, dramatic and psychological features in her roles, and delivered a number of critically acclaimed performances. In 2000, Matondkar re-united with Varma for the action Jungle, alongside Fardeen Khan and Sunil Shetty. She played Anu, who is hostaged by the chief of bandits, when he starts liking her. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama wrote, \\"Urmila Matondkar is at ease in a role that gives her ample scope to showcase her talent. Her scenes with Durga can easily be singled out, for they have been shot with brilliance.\\" The film was both critically and commercially successful. She next starred opposite Govinda in David Dhawan's romantic comedy Kunwara. The film underperformed at the box office, with a grossing of . The next year, Matondkar portrayed Ria, an obsessed lover, in Rajat Mukherjee's romantic thriller Pyaar Tune Kya Kiya, a film which received critical acclaim. Her performance was highly acclaimed and several critics noted her for showing great emotional range and depth. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama, in a positive review wrote, \\"the 'actual hero' of the film is definitely Urmila Matondkar, who will walk away with all laurels at the end of the day. Her career-best performance, she oozes intensity, love, hate, relentlessness and obsessive behaviour with perfection. And despite the fact that her character gets nuttier as the movie tags along, it is to Urmila's credit that we are able to feel for her pathetic persona.\\" Planetbollywood.com described Matondkar as: \\"The star of the show is Urmila who is simply mind blowing in this film. The film is sure to get her nominated for best actress or even in some cases best villain. Not only does she look amazing, but she acts so well it will leave you speechless. If you hate everything else in the film, her performance will surely win you over! Her last two scenes in the film are simply breath taking. Ladies and gentlemen stand up and applaud this fantastic performance!\\" The film emerged successful at the box office with gross earnings of . Matondkar received various Best Villain nominations for her performance, including a Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Negative Role nomination. In 2002, Matondkar appeared alongside an ensemble cast (Waheeda Rehman, Anil Kapoor, Fardeen Khan, Mahima Chaudhary, Abhishek Bachchan and Tara Sharma), in the drama Om Jai Jagadish. She played the role of Neetu, the love interest of the protagonist (played by Fardeen Khan). The film failed commercially. Anees Bazmee's psychological thriller Deewangee was her next release.

Co-starring Ajay Devgan and Akshaye Khanna, the film was well received by critics and was moderately successful at the box office. Deepa Gumaste, writing for Rediff, praised the performances of the three leads and wrote: \\"As usual, the heroine has little to do apart from looking cute in the first half and scared in the second. It is another matter that she is supposed to be the object of the film's conflict. For what it is worth, Urmila Matondkar executes her part well\\". Her first release of 2003 was the supernatural horror Bhoot. She played Swati, a ghost-possessed woman. Taran Adarsh wrote praised her performance and wrote: \\"...the film clearly belongs to Urmila Matondkar all the way. To state that she is excellent would be doing gross injustice to her work. Sequences when she is possessed are simply astounding. If this performance doesn't deserve an award, no other performance should. It beats all competition hollow\\". Khalid Mohamed wrote, \\"Matondkar is consistently excellent - controlled and persuasively vulnerable – as the beleaguered wife, evoking your concern and empathy. She's the major triumph of Bhoot actually\\". She received her first Filmfare Award under the Best Actress (Critics' Choice) as well as various Best Actress awards at different award ceremonies, including Star Screen Awards, Zee Cine Awards and Bollywood Movie Awards. She received another Filmfare Award for Best Actress nomination and also received the national honour Rajiv Gandhi Award for the work in the film, also recognising her achievements in Bollywood. The film became successful at the box office with gross earnings of . She achieved further critical acclaim for her portrayal of the title role of a girl in a strained relationship with her mother, in Khalid Mohammed's crime drama Tehzeeb (2003). Rediff complimented her by stating, \\"Urmila as the emotionally scarred Tehzeeb, who is uncomfortable expressing her feelings even to her husband, has done a commendable job. The only person she expresses her love to is her mentally challenged sister.\\" She next played the role of Puro, a North Indian girl who leads a happy life but her dreams of a happy future are shattered when, one evening, she is kidnapped by Bajpayee's character, in the background of the 1947 India partition in the critically acclaimed Pinjar (2003). Derek Elley of Variety reviewed the film commenting, \\"A handsomely shot drama centered on a Hindu woman's travails during the 1947 Partition, \\"Pinjar\\" ranks as one of the better Bollywood treatments of this still hot-button issue. Good performances, especially by lead actress Urmila Matondkar and by Manoj Bajpai as her Muslim partner, compensate for a slightly wobbly structure\\". =Critical acclaim and decrease in workload (2004–present)= In 2004, Matondkar starred in the thriller Ek Hasina Thi. The film (which marked the debut of Sriram Raghavan) tells the story of a Satika Vartak, a deceived woman, played by Matondkar, who is jailed and arrested for having links with the underworld, because of her lover, played by Khan, and later flees from prison to seek revenge on him. Upon release, the film was positively received by critics, with Matondkar's performance earning praise. The Deccan Herald commented: \\"An author-backed role ensures that Urmila gets to do everything just right. Whether it’s kicking a bully into shape in the dreary prison of which she’s an inmate or whether it’s making nice with Karan while plotting his ruin, she’s a total treat. She carries off the transition from naive to knowing effortlessly. Seductive and steely, she’s quite explosive.\\" The film was a box office success. For her performance, Matondkar received nominations at the Filmfare, Screen, Zee Cine and IIFA ceremonies. The film was premiered at the New York Asian Film Festival. In 2005, she played the title role in the horror Naina. The film tells the story of Matondkar's character who after receiving an eye transplant, realises that she can see into the supernatural world.

In 2006, she appeared in Pankaj Parashar's romance Banaras: A Mystic Love Story with Ashmit Patel and Dimple Kapadia. The film was not well received by critics, with Raja Sen commenting: \\"And then there's Urmila. Let's start with the good. She looks great, refreshingly beautiful and striking. That's about it. This is an actress who has worked hard to earn respectability, but this role, like the film itself, suffers from inconsistency\\". Her next release was Onir's Bas Ek Pal (2006). Her next release was the thriller Karzzzz (2008), a remake of Karz (1980), alongside Himesh Reshammiya. The film was a major critical and commercial failure, however, Matondkar was praised for her portrayal and adding her own flavour to the role of Kamini.

She portrayed Purva Rao, a wildlife activist in search of leopards. Daily News and Analysis wrote, \\"..this one's another jewel in her crown.

Off-screen work In addition to her acting career, Matondkar has participated in several stage shows and televised award ceremonies.

Later that year, she featured as a talent judge for the second season of Sony Entertainment's dance reality show Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa alongside Jeetendra and Shiamak Davar. She described her experience of judging Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa by saying, \\"I'm ecstatic about being able to be part of this show. I was facing the participants and audience for the first time. There were no written lines, no cues, no second chances. Either it worked or it didn't work for you. It was a concept that I liked.\\" In 2008, Matondkar presented Sony TV's singing reality show Waar Parriwar. In 2011, she co-judged Colors' dance reality show Chak Dhoom Dhoom, along with Javed Jaffrey and Terence Lewis and in 2012, she featured as one of the jury of Zee Marathi's Dance Maharashtra Dance, where the dancers from Maharashtra demonstrated their dancing prowess through different dance forms.

Artistry and media image Matondkar in 2012 Matondkar has been described by critics as one of the most talented actresses in Bollywood. In 2016, film critic Subhash K. Jha analysing Matondkar's work, wrote:\\" Her days of glory while they lasted created a body of work that was as curvaceous as her body: Rangeela (Ram Gopal Varma's only romantic film), Satya (where in spite of Manoj Bajpai, she held her own, especially in a key breakdown sequence and in that lilting Lata Mangeshkar melody 'Gila Gila Paani' which was cut out of the film), Kaun (where her horror act was chilling), Pinjar (a masterly adaptation of Amrita Pritam's novel about a rape victim during the Partition), Ek Haseena Thi (where she played hero to Saif Ali Khan's villain), Pyar Tune Kya Kiya (she was heartbreakingly poignant as a victim of unrequited love), Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Mara (spirited as a daughter trying to cope with a father suffering from Alzeihmer's), Khubsoorat (she played the Plain Jane who transforms into ..ummm.. Urmila Matondkar)...and so many others. Film critic Sukanya Verma has described Matondkar as \\"a thinking actress who performs spontaneously.\\" She further added,\\"..It is her charismatic image that stays with the audience. She is an actress with a lot of style and a fair amount of substance.\\" Director Ram Gopal Varma, describing her as someone who impacted him, commented, \\"I was mesmerised by Urmila's beauty -- from her face to her figure... everything about her was just divine...One of my primary motives in making Rangeela was to capture Urmila's beauty eternally on camera and to make it a benchmark for sex symbols. I would say that I have never felt more of a cinematic high than when I watched her through my camera on the sets of Rangeela.\\" Saurav Bhanot of Scoop Whoop wrote, \\"Breaking Bollywood stereotypes of how heroines should be on-screen, Urmila was always ahead of her times. With Rangeela, Urmila single-handedly redefined the 90s Bollywood heroine.\\" In an interview with Rediff, Matondkar described her approach to acting: > I have always tried to make life interesting for myself by doing different > roles that connect mainstream cinema with its offbeat counterpart. I guess I > have been daring and lucky with my roles. I am not quite turning into a > serious actress. I have never made tall claims. I am an actress, period. I > want to do every kind of role with a reasonable amount of panache. I want to > be a fair combination of style and substance. In 2003, following the success of Bhoot, Pinjar and Tehzeeb, Matondkar featured in Rediff's annual Top Bollywood actresses listing.

It lies approximately south-west of Brisbane, not far from the Queensland - New South Wales border, and forms part of the McPherson Range. It is a popular destination for bushwalkers and campers. Mount Barney is the sixth or seventh highest mountain in Queensland and is often regarded as one of the most impressive parts of the Scenic Rim. The mountain consists of two main peaks, (East Peak and the slightly higher West Peak), and smaller subsidiary peaks. East Peak is probably the most popular destination for bushwalkers. The closest town is Rathdowney. Mount Barney is surrounded by other mountains including Mount Ballow, Mount May, Mount Ernest, Mount Maroon and Mount Lindesay. Logan River has its headwaters on the mountain. Geology The dome-shaped mass is composed of granophyre that formed below the surface and subsequently intruded into the overlaying sandstone. Erosion has stripped away the sandstone leaving the mountain's twin peaks. Mount Barney is the remnants of the central complex of the Focal Peak Volcano which together with the Tweed Volcano covered much of South East Queensland and North East New South Wales with lavas referred to as the Lamington Volcanics Natural heritage In 1947, the Mount Barney National Park was established to protect the natural heritage surrounding the peak. Mount Barney was included in the Central Eastern Rainforest Reserves in 1994. The Antarctic beech can be found of the upper slopes of adjacent Mount Nothafagus and in the rainforest of nearby Mount Ballow. Important animal species found on the mountain include platypus, rock wallabies and Coxen's fig parrot. Heath vegetation on the mountain provides habitat for a colony of the endangered eastern bristlebird. History Mount Barney has held a special significance for local Aboriginal people for millennia, and it features prominently in a number of their stories. For Aboriginal people the peak has traditionally been regarded as a place to avoid.http://nla.gov.au/nla.news- article22013170?searchTerm=&searchLimits;=l-publictag=place+names On 3 August 1828, explorer Allan Cunningham named the mountain Mount Lindesay. However, the New South Wales Surveyor-General Thomas Mitchell is believed to have renamed it in the 1840s to Mount Barney, after George Barney, a colonial engineer. Mitchell is believed to have assigned the name Mount Lindesay to the current Mount Lindesay (which Cunningham had originally named Mount Hooker). The first European to climb Mount Barney was Captain Patrick Logan, who reached the East Peak summit via the now named Logan's Ridge, during an exploring expedition in 1828. Accounts of the climb were written by botanists Charles Fraser and Allan Cunningham, who accompanied Logan for part of the ascent.Steele, J.G., (1972) Explorers of the Moreton Bay District, 1770-1830, St Lucia, UQ Press - Historical records suggest that Europeans probably began bushwalking at Mount Barney for recreation in about the 1880s, when the region became more closely settled.See Grenville Kingsley's account of an ascent of Mount Barney made by R.M. Collins and other locals in 1886 - 'A Trip Up Mount Barney', Brisbane Courier, 10 November 1886, p.7. View on-line at http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article4486604 During the first decade or so of the 20th century, the peak became popular with a small number of self-styled 'mountaineers', such as Boonah school teachers Harry Johns (1877–1943) and William Gaylard (1880–1930), Ipswich Technical College Principal R.A. Wearne (1870–1932), and some of the selectors who lived close by, such as the Doherty family at 'Lilydale'. However it was probably not until the early 1930s, with the formation of groups such as the National Parks Association, and the appearance of a new breed of outdoor adventurers such as Bert Salmon (1899–1982), who made the first recorded ascent of Leaning Peak in 1932, Cliff Wilson (who was probably the first European to climb all of the Mount Barney peaks and lesser pinnacles) and Arthur Groom (1904–1953), and also botanists such as Cyril White (1890–1950) and Lindsay Smith (1917–1970), that bushwalkers began visiting the peak in numbers, and even then, much of Mount Barney remained unexplored until the late 1940s and early 1950s, when groups such as the University of Queensland Bushwalking Club, and the Brisbane Bushwalkers began making regular bushwalking and camping trips to the peak. Bushwalking Mount Barney, 2011 There are a dozen or so established bushwalking routes up Mount Barney, however none of them are easy. All the routes require a reasonable level of fitness, and many require advanced route- finding and rock-scrambling skills. Only South Ridge (\\"Peasants Ridge\\") can be recommended to less experienced walkers. Whilst the steep route up Logan's Ridge to the East Peak summit is often considered to be the most spectacular, all the routes have their attractions.Rankin, Robert. (1992) Secrets of the Scenic Rim. pp 55 - 74. Rankin Publishers As a rough guide, a trip to East Peak via one of the more direct routes will generally take 8–9 hours return when carrying a day pack. There is usually a flow of drinkable water in the creek at the saddle between East and West Peak, but elsewhere on the mountain, away from the creeks, water is often difficult to find. In addition to the mountain itself, Mount Barney Creek (to the West) and Cronan's Creek (to the South-East), the two main creek systems which ring Mount Barney, offer plenty of scope for walking and camping, particularly in the warmer months. Note though that the creeks are prone to flash flooding after heavy rainfall, and that they are potentially quite dangerous at times of high flow. There are a few Class 4 hiking trails around the base of the mountain, including the Lower Portals, and Cronan Creek Trails. A free iPhone GPS App is available to aid hikers in keeping to hiking trails within Mt Barney National Park.  Rock climbing  To date, Mount Barney has attracted only a relatively small number of rock climbers, perhaps due to the long walk-in times and access difficulties. So far, local climbers have generally agreed that the peak should remain \\"traditional only\\" (no bolts). The spectacular East Face was first climbed in 1966, and over the years a number of other routes have been put up in the vicinity of Leaning Peak and Isolated Peak. More recently, bouldering (ground-level climbing) has become popular in Mount Barney Creek upstream from the Lower Portals camping area. There is one multipitch sport climb known as “The Governor”. At long, it is one of Queensland's longest climbs. The longest is the 410 metre North Face of Leaning Peak climbed in 1968.

It is an ancient grain type; Khorasan refers to a historical region in modern-day Afghanistan and Iran in northeast and parts of Central Asia. This grain is twice the size of modern-day wheat and is known for its rich, nutty flavor.  Taxonomy  Original botanical identifications were uncertain. The variety is a form of Triticum turgidum subsp. turanicum (also known as Triticum turanicum), usually called Khorasan wheat. Identifications sometimes seen as T. polonicum are incorrect as the variety, although long- grained, lacks the long glumes of this species. Recent genetic evidence from DNA fingerprinting suggests that the variety is perhaps derived from a natural hybrid between T. durum and T. polonicum, which would explain past difficulties in arriving at a certain classification.  Life form  As an annual, self-fertilized grass that is cultivated for its grains, Khorasan wheat looks very similar to common wheat. However, its grains are twice the size of modern wheat kernel, with a Thousand-kernel Weight up to 60g. They contain more proteins, lipids, amino acids, vitamins and minerals than modern wheat. The grain has an amber colour and a high vitreousness.  History  The exact origin of Khorasan wheat remains unknown. Described by John Percival in 1921, this ancient grain probably originates from the Fertile Crescent and derives its common name from the historical province of Khorasan which included a large portion of northeastern Iran into Afghanistan and Central Asia to the river Oxus. Some Turkish scientists have suggested that it originated in Anatolia. Khorasan wheat was probably continuously cultivated at small scales and for personal use in Near East and Central Asia and in Northern Africa. However, it has not been commercially produced in modern times. In 1949, when the grain reached the US, it did not raise a lot of interest and therefore fell into disuse. In 1977, Mack and Bob Quinn, two farmers from Montana, decided to cultivate this ancient grain. In 1990, they registered the protected cultivated turanicum variety QK-77 as the trademark Kamut.  Region of cultivation  Khorasan wheat is grown in Europe mainly for bread, and in the Iranian province of Khorasan as food for camels. It is also probably cultivated in small acreage and for personal use in some other regions of the Middle East. Approximately of Khorasan wheat were cultivated in 2006 in north-central Montana, southern Saskatchewan and southeast Alberta. Experimental production has been made in Europe and in Australia.  Yield  The actual average yield of Kamut brand Khorasan wheat is . In drier years, Khorasan wheat can sometimes yield even more than durum wheat. However, in normal or wet years, it yields approximately 1/3 less than the durum wheat.  Distribution  Europe represented almost 70% of the 2006 sales and Italy was the greater consumer. With only cultivated worldwide, Khorasan wheat does not play an important role in the world food system. By capturing this niche market, Khorasan wheat counterbalances its weak agronomic traits. Between 1998 and 2006 total sales of Kamut brand wheat increased by 72%.  Product use  Khorasan wheat is used similarly as modern wheat. Its grains can be either directly consumed or milled into flour. It can be found in breads, bread mixes, breakfast cereals, cookies, waffles, pancakes, bulgur, baked goods, pastas, drinks, beer and snacks. Apart from its nutritional qualities, Khorasan wheat is recognized for its smooth texture and nutty, buttery flavor.  Nutrition and composition  =Nutrients= In a reference serving, Khorasan wheat provides of food energy and is a rich source (more than 19% of the Daily Value, DV) of numerous essential nutrients, including protein (29% DV), dietary fiber (46% DV), several B vitamins and dietary minerals, especially manganese (136% DV) (table). Khorasan wheat is 11% water, 70% carbohydrates, 2% fat and 15% protein (table). = Composition = Khorasan wheat has high protein content which improves its vitreousness which indicates a high milling yield. =Gluten= As kamut contains gluten, it is unsuitable for people with gluten-related disorders, such as celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity and wheat allergy sufferers, among others.  Requirements for climate and soil  As Khorasan wheat is an ancient cereal species, the climatic requirements still correspond very well with its region of origin—i.e., the fertile crescent in the Middle East. A temperate continental climate with cold nights in the early spring (see vernalisation), low to moderate precipitation rates (500–1,000 mm per year), and a sunny warm summer for optimal ripening are therefore the typical preferred climatic conditions of Khorasan wheat. These conditions are very similar to those of durum wheat, which originates in the same region. But, because breeding efforts for Khorasan wheat have been very sparse (see chapter below), the adaptation to other climatic conditions is still limited. In general Khorasan wheat seems to be less susceptible to environmental stress than common wheat, a characteristic it shares with most of the ancient grains. Khorasan wheat is especially known for its drought tolerance, which is even better than that of durum wheat. Too much precipitation, especially in the end of the season, usually leads to dramatic disease problems (see chapter below). Soils typically used for Khorasan wheat are the same as for durum wheat: deep friable black clays with a certain water storing capacity, also known as vertisols.Kneipp J. (2008), Durum wheat production, State of New South Wales through NSW Department of Primary Industries - Tamworth Agricultural Institute, Calala  Cultivation management, harvest and post-harvest treatment  The cultivation practices are quite similar to other wheat species, especially durum. As most of the Khorasan wheat is organically produced, the nutrient supply (especially nitrogen) should be granted by using an appropriate crop rotation, such as previous pasture legumes. The nutritional content of Khorasan wheat is the most important characteristic of this crop and the reason why it is cultivated. Therefore, the nutrition supply is one of the critical aspects of this production. Harvest in general follows the same procedure as in the other wheat species. As soon as the grains are mature, a combine harvester threshes the Khorasan wheat. But contrary to common wheat, the seeds of Khorasan wheat are very brittle and crack in half very easily, which leads to a necessarily more gentle harvest and post-harvest treatment. Thinking of post-harvest treatments, the special physical properties of the Khorasan grain may cause difficulties (literature on that topic is still scarce). Storage may be more difficult because of a higher water capacity of the grains, the milling has to be adapted because of the big grains (should not be a problem in modern mills, in general) and the whole transportation machinery must deal with higher weight, because the Thousand Kernel Weight (TKW) is very high.  Growth, development, physiology  Khorasan wheat is a tetraploid wheat subspecies, which means that the general biological properties resemble those of durum wheat.  Diseases  The range of diseases in Khorasan wheat is more or less the same as in all other wheat species. Main diseases are typically caused by fungi, such as the Fusarium head blight or the \\"black tip\\". Khorasan wheat has been found very susceptible to Fusarium head blight. Because of the high susceptibility to fungi, crop rotation is quite important, especially under organic production conditions. The rotation requirements resemble more or less those of durum wheat. Depending on the specific production setting, Khorasan production after maize or other cereals should be avoided. Typical robust rotations would contain some of the following crops: canola, sunflower, pulses, sorghum and pasture legumes.  Aspects of breeding  The traditional aim of plant breeding is to improve the agronomic or nutritional qualities of a crop. Typical goals are improved yield, reduced susceptibility to diseases and pests, homogeneous maturation (to optimize harvest) and increased tolerance to environmental stresses, i.e., drought, acid soil, high or cold temperature, etc. Most of the known wheat species today are polyploid. Whereas common bread wheat is hexaploid, Khorasan wheat is tetraploid. To do further breeding with this tetraploid Khorasan wheat, the genetic pool to use is a little bit limited to the tetraploid subspecies of triticum turgidum such as durum (subsp. durum), Polish (subsp. polonicum), Persian (subsp. carthlicum), Emmer (subsp. dicoccum) and Poulard (subsp. turgidum) wheat. Especially to develop resistances against common fungi (e.g., Fusarium head blight), this genomic pool is interesting. Problematic in this case, is the economic unimportance of most of the tetraploid subspecies of wheat (except durum), which limits the investment to do intensive breeding, especially compared to the highly important common bread wheat.

It borders New South Wales. In the , Mount Lindesay had a population of 3 people. The mountain of the same name (height ) is located on the south-west boundary of the locality () on the border between Queensland and New South Wales. Geography The mountain lies on the Queensland-New South Wales border, approximately 140 km south west of Brisbane, Australia. It is one of a number of peaks in the McPherson Range, and is remarkable for its tiered summit, the eroded remnant of lava flows from the nearby Focal Peak shield volcano.R.W. Johnson, J. Knutson, S.R. Taylor, 1989,Intraplate Volcanism in Eastern Australia and New Zealand Mount Lindesay is situated within the Mount Barney National Park in Queensland and the Border Ranges National Park in New South Wales. Apart from the northern slopes, the rest of the peak is covered in dense rainforest, and the summit is frequently in cloud and mist. The Mount Lindesay Highway passes to the western side of Mount Lindesay. A wildfire from the south in November 2019 burned across the mountain above the cliffs for the first time in living memory, reaching the summit from the western side. Most of the forest on top was burned, apart from several narrow bands on the lower veranda and a small area of rainforest, east of the summit. History Laravale, 2014 On 6 July 1828, the botanist and explorer Allan Cunningham originally named this mountain Mount Hooker after botanist William Hooker and called another mountain (now Mount Barney) by the name Mount Lindesay after Colonel Patrick Lindesay, the Commandant of Troops in New South Wales 1827–1836. Sometime in the late 1830s or early 1840s, either the New South Wales Surveyor-General Thomas Mitchell, or Moreton District surveyor Robert Dixon, are believed to have changed the names to be Mount Lindesay and Mount Barney (after Lieutenant-Colonel George Barney) respectively. The first known European ascent of Mount Lindesay was most likely by Collector of Customs, William Thornton, and the Kinchela brothers, John and James, sometime between 1846 and 1848.Mary Murray-Prior, 'An ascent of Mt. Lindesay', Queenslander, 1 November 1902, p.974 All were stationed in Queensland at the time and knew each other well with the Kinchela brothers based at Telemon station on the Upper Logan within sight of the mountain. The first recorded (and second) ascent of Mount Lindesay was made in May 1872, by Thomas de Montmorency Murray-Prior (1848-1902) and Phillip Walter Pears (1846-1924). At the time of the 1872 ascent, an Aboriginal elder at nearby Unumgar station claimed to Pears that his father had once climbed the peak.P.W. Pears, 'Mt. Lindesay', Brisbane Courier, 22 November 1923, p.6 The second recorded (and third) ascent of Mount Lindesay was made in July 1890, by the Norwegian naturalist and explorer Carsten Egeberg Borchgrevink (1864-1934), then working in the district as a surveyor's labourer, and Edwin Villiers-Brown, of Beaudesert. There were a further eight recorded ascents by the late 1920s, when pioneering climbers such as Bert Salmon (1899-1982) started visiting the peak regularly. The first women to climb Mount Lindesay were Brisbane climbers Jean Easton and Nora Dimes, who made the ascent with Bert Salmon in March 1931. In December 1928 Mount Lindesay was the site of the first known recreational climbing fatality in Australia, when Lyle Vidler fell to his death whilst attempting a solo ascent of Vidler's Chimney. He is buried in a grave in the rainforest, not far from where he fell. On 19 June 2011, Ross Miller, one of a party of six, fell to his death while climbing in a designated area. Mount Lindesay from the Mount Lindesay Highway Mount Lindesay has been part of a successful native title claim made by the Trevor Close on behalf of the Githabul people, for whom the peak holds a special significance. Climbing Despite appearances, Mount Lindesay offers few opportunities for rock-climbers, due to the unsound nature of the rock (decaying rhyolite). There is one steep and exposed scrambling route to the summit, rated at approximately grade 6–7, which starts at the south east corner of the upper cliffs. However, this is not a bushwalking route as such, and anyone making an ascent should have basic rock-climbing and abseiling skills, or be under the guidance of experienced rock-climbers.R.Rankin, 1992, Secrets of the Scenic Rim The wildfire in November 2019 significantly impacted the 'tourist route', particularly on the lower cliff, with much of the vegetation destroyed, leaving unstable and potentially dangerous sections. Until the vegetation regenerates and the stability of the route improves, the risk of falling rock will remain high. The difficulties and seriousness have increased substantially as a result of the fire and it is not recommended for inexperienced climbers. Schools There are no schools in Mount Lindesay. The nearest primary school is in Rathdowney, while the nearest secondary school is in Beaudesert. Demographics Mount Lindesay has a population of 3 at the . The locality contains 0 households, in which 0.0% of the population are males and 100.0% of the population are females with a median age of 12, 26 years above the national average. The average weekly household income is $0, $1,438 below the national average.

The gardens are part of the William Brown Street conservation area, and comprise one of the two open spaces within Liverpool's World Heritage Site. It has been a Green Flag site since 2003. The gardens contain ornamental flower beds, and memorials to notable people of the city. History The gardens stand in a former area of heathland known as The Great Heath, which continued to exist until the middle of the 18th century. As Liverpool grew, the land was built on, and towards the end of the 19th century it had been completely developed. The land sloped upwards to the east of the developing city and was exposed to the winds, making it a suitable site for windmills and for public lines to dry washing. In 1749 the city's first General Infirmary was built on the site, followed by the Seaman's Hospital in 1752, a dispensary in 1778, and a lunatic asylum in 1789. Industry also came to the site; in addition to windmills, there were rope works, potteries, a marble yard, and a row of lime kilns. From 1767 the land towards the top of the slope had been the town cemetery, and in 1784 a church dedicated to Saint John the Baptist was built in the middle of the cemetery. By 1854 the cemetery was full, and the church was demolished in 1898. Meanwhile the other buildings in the area had been demolished, the industries closed, and St George's Hall had been built, opening in 1854. At the beginning of the 20th century it was decided to landscape the former cemetery. The remains of most of the bodies were removed and buried elsewhere. The site was redeveloped and opened in 1904 as \\"St John's Ornamental and Memorial Gardens\\". The gardens were designed by the corporation surveyor Thomas Shelmerdine. In addition to the creation of flower beds, statues and memorials were erected in the gardens. Monuments The gardens contain seven memorial statues, each of which is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. The Rathbone Monument commemorates William Rathbone who died in 1902, although the monument had been made in 1899. It was created by George Frampton, and consists of a bronze robed figure standing on a stone pedestal. Its inscription records that Rathbone founded the district nursing movement, and the forerunners of the Universities of Liverpool and North Wales. The Gladstone Monument is to the memory of W. E. Gladstone, a former Prime Minister, who was born in Liverpool and who died in 1898. The monument dates from 1904 and was made by Thomas Brock. It consists of a bronze figure of Gladstone holding books and a roll of parchment, standing on a stone pedestal containing carvings of female figures representing Truth and Justice. The Balfour Monument commemorates Alexander Balfour, businessman and philanthropist who died in 1886. The monument dates from 1889, was sculpted by Albert Bruce-Joy, and consists of a bronze figure on a stone pedestal. The Lester Monument is to the memory of Canon T. Major Lester who died in 1903, and who founded charities for children in Liverpool. It was made by George Frampton, erected in 1907, and depicts a bronze figure holding a child, standing on a stone pedestal. The Nugent Memorial commemorates James Nugent, a Roman Catholic priest who worked with child welfare. The monument is dated 1906, was created by F. W. Pomeroy, and consists of a bronze figure in the attitude of blessing, and a ragged boy, both standing on a stone pedestal decorated with a bronze wreath. The Forwood Monument is to the memory of Sir Arthur Forwood, a local businessman and politician, who died in 1898. The monument was erected in 1903, was made by George Frampton and, again, is a bronze figure on a stone pedestal. Also in the gardens is a monument commemorating the service of the King's Regiment in the South African War. It is dated 1905 and was sculpted by Sir W. Goscombe John. It is in white stone with a bronze wreath, and includes the figure of Britannia, military objects, standing soldiers, and a drummer boy. Also listed at Grade II are the stone walls and the gate piers surrounding the gardens. They date from 1904 and were designed by Thomas Shelmerdine. =Gallery of Monuments in St John's Gardens= File:Alexander Balfour statue, St John's Gardens, Liverpool.JPGStatue of Alexander Balfour, by Albert Bruce-Joy, plinth designed by Alfred Waterhouse (1889; Grade II) File:Statue of William Rathbone, St John's Gardens, Liverpool 1.jpgStatue to William Rathbone, by George Frampton (1899-1900; Grade II) File:Forwood monument, St John's Gardens.jpgStatue to Arthur Forwood, by George Frampton (1903; Grade II) File:Gladstone statue St John's Gardens Liverpool.jpgMemorial to William Ewart Gladstone, by Thomas Brock (1904; Grade II) File:King's Regiment Monument 2019.jpgMonument to the King's Regiment, by Goscombe John (1905; Grade II) File:Liverpool Kings Regiment Statue Back.JPGThe back of the Monument to the King's Regiment, by Goscombe John (1905; Grade II) File:JamesNugent.JPGStatue to James Nugent, by F.

It probably represents the bateleur eagle or the African fish eagle. The bird's design is derived from a number of soapstone sculptures found in the ruins of the ancient city of Great Zimbabwe. It is now the definitive icon of independent Zimbabwe, with Matenga (2001) listing over 100 organisations which now incorporate the Bird in their logo. Origins The original carved birds are from the ruined city of Great Zimbabwe, which was built by ancestors of the Shona, starting in the 11th century and inhabited for over 300 years.Great Zimbabwe (11th–15th century)  Thematic Essay  Timeline of Art History  The Metropolitan Museum of Art The ruins, after which modern Zimbabwe was named, cover some and are the largest ancient stone construction in sub-Saharan Africa. Among its notable elements are the soapstone bird sculptures, about tall and standing on columns more than tall, which were originally installed on walls and monoliths within the city. They are unique to Great Zimbabwe; nothing like them has been discovered elsewhere. Various explanations have been advanced to explain the symbolic meaning of the birds. One suggestion is that each bird was erected in turn to represent a new king, but this would have required improbably long reigns. More probably, the Zimbabwe birds represent sacred or totemic animals of the Shona – the bateleur eagle (Shona: chapungu), which was held to be a messenger from Mwari (God) and the ancestors, or the fish eagle (hungwe) which it has been suggested was the original totem of the Shona. Colonial acquisition and return to Zimbabwe Three of the Zimbabwe Birds, photographed around 1891 In 1889 a European hunter, Willi Posselt, travelled to Great Zimbabwe after hearing about it from another European explorer, Karl Mauch. He climbed to the highest point of the ruins despite being told that it was a sacred site where he should not trespass, and found the birds positioned in the centre of an enclosure around an apparent altar. He later wrote: Posselt compensated Andizibi with a payment of blankets and \\"some other articles\\". As the bird on its pedestal was too heavy for him to carry, he hacked it off and hid the pedestal with the intention of returning later to retrieve it. He subsequently sold his bird to Cecil Rhodes, who mounted it in the library of his Cape Town house, Groote Schuur, and decorated the house's stairway with wooden replicas. Rhodes also had stone replicas made, three times the size of the original, to decorate the gates of his house in England near Cambridge. A German missionary came to own the pedestal of one bird, which he sold to the Ethnological Museum in Berlin in 1907. Rhodes' acquisition of Posselt's bird prompted him to commission an investigation of the Great Zimbabwe ruins by James Theodore Bent, which took place in 1891 following the British South Africa Company's invasion of Mashonaland. Bent recorded that there were eight birds, six large and two small, and that there had probably originally been more as there were several additional stone pedestals of which the tops had been broken off. The colonists erroneously attributed Great Zimbabwe to ancient Mediterranean builders, believing native Africans to be incapable of constructing such a complex structure; thus in Rhodes' mind, as a 1932 guidebook put it, it was \\"a favourite symbol of the link between the order civilisation derived from the North or the East and the savage barbarism of Southern and Central Africa before the advent of the European.\\" Bent attributed the birds, wholly erroneously, to the Phoenicians.Bent, p. 185 In 1981, a year after the attainment of independence in Zimbabwe, the South African government returned four of the sculptures to the country in exchange for a world-renowned collection of hymenoptera (bees, wasps and ants) housed in Harare; the fifth remains at Groote Schuur. In 2003, the German museum returned its portion of the bird's pedestal to Zimbabwe. The birds were displayed for a while in the Natural History Museum in Bulawayo and the Museum of Human Sciences in Harare, but are now housed in a small museum on the Great Zimbabwe site. Cultural depictions The Zimbabwe bird has been a symbol of Zimbabwe and its predecessor states since 1924. The crest of Southern Rhodesia's coat of arms incorporated the Zimbabwe bird, and over time the bird became a widespread symbol of the colony. The paper money and coins of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, issued by the Bank of Rhodesia and Nyasaland also displayed the bird, as did the Flag of Rhodesia. The flag and state symbols of modern Zimbabwe continue to feature the Zimbabwe Bird.Kuklick, p. 137 It is now the definitive icon of independent Zimbabwe with Matenga (2001) listing over 100 state, corporate and sporting organisations which incorporate the Bird in their emblems and logos.

It has been proposed as the site of Kinalua, the capital city of a Iron Age Neo-Hittite kingdom, and of biblical Calneh. Location Tell Tayinat is located along the southwestern edge of the Amuq valley. The site lies some 800 meters from Tell Atchana, the site of the ancient city of Alalakh. Identification Archaeologist Timothy Harrison, the dig director for many years starting in 2004, supports the identification of the site with Kinalua, the capital of a Neo-Hittite/Aramean Iron Age kingdom. It is a possible site of the city of Calneh mentioned in the Hebrew Scriptures. History and archaeology Archaeological excavation at the tell has indicated, in conjunction with ancient written sources, that the site was a major urban centre in two separate phases, during the Early Bronze Age and Early Iron Age. =History of excavation and research= Archaeological excavations were conducted at the site by the University of Chicago's Oriental Institute from 1935 to 1938, led by Robert Braidwood.

University Museum of the University of Pennsylvania: Expedition, 2007 From the Early Bronze IVB (EBIVB) significant ceramic remains have been found. =Iron Age= During the Iron Age II, this is thought likely to be the site of ancient Kinalua, the capital of one of the Neo-Hittite/Aramean city-kingdoms of Walistin (Aramaic) or Palistin (neo-Hittite), of which a follow-up kingdom is the one known as Pattin or Patina, the shortened form of Palistin (together c. 1000-738 BC).Timothy P.

Among the culturally diverse Syro- Hittite states in the north Syrian river-plain the rulers of Kinalua continued to bear royal Hittite names in the 8th century BCE. At the first Assyrian conquest in the 870s BCE, the victors carried away from Kinalua silver and gold, 100 talents of tin, essential for making bronze, and 100 talents of iron, 1000 oxen and 10,000 sheep, linen robes and decorated couches and beds of boxwood, as well as \\"10 female singers, the king's brother's daughter with a rich dowry, a large female monkey and ducks\\".A.K. Grayson, Assyrian Rulers of the Early First Millennium BC, vol. I: 1991:217f, quoted in Robin Lane Fox, Travelling Heroes in the Epic Age of Homer, 2008:94. At a later campaign the Assyrians forced its king Tutammu to submit. The city had a citadel placed at a higher elevation, connected to the lower city by a monumental gate complex. Iron Age temple One of the key finds of the Oriental Institute (1935–38) made at the site was a temple reminiscent in plan to the descriptions of King Solomon's Temple in the Old Testament.Monson, John M. \\"The Temple of Solomon: Heart of Jerusalem\\", C.

Retrieved 15 February 2011. Bit-hilani palaces The Oriental Institute campaigns (1935–38) brought to light several large palaces in the style known as Bit- hilani. The 2005 excavations exposed part of one of the early Iron Age II bit- hilanis. King Suppiluliuma statue In August 2012, a team from the University of Toronto announced they had uncovered the head and torso of a human figure, intact to just above its waist. The remains of the figure stand approximately 1.5 meters in height, suggesting a total height of 3.5 to 4 meters. The figure is bearded with eyes made of black and white stone. The figure's hair has been styled in an elaborate series of curls arranged in rows. The arms of the figure extend forward from the elbow. Each arm has two arm bracelets adorned with lion heads. The figure’s left hand holds a shaft of wheat and its right hand holds a spear. The figure's chest is adorned with a crescent-shaped pectoral. A lengthy carved, raised relief inscription in Hieroglyphic Luwian runs across the figure's back. The inscription records the accomplishments and campaigns of King Suppiluliuma. He is likely the same king who as part of a Syrian-Hittite coalition in 858 BC fought against the Neo- Assyrian invasion of Shalmaneser III. Female statue In August of 2017, it was reported that a majestic female statue was discovered at the site, within the monumental gate complex leading to the upper citadel. This may be an image of Kubaba, divine mother of the gods of ancient Anatolia. Or it may be Kupapiyas, who was the wife – or possibly mother – of Taita, the dynastic founder of ancient Tayinat. But it's also possible that the statue represents the wife of King Suppiluliuma. Archaeologist Timothy Harrison raised the possibility that women played quite a prominent role in the political and religious lives of these early Iron Age communities.Majestic 3,000-year-old female statue uncovered in Turkey: excavation led by U of T archaeologists, University of Toronto News, August 11, 2017 See also *Cities of the ancient Near East *Short chronology timeline References External links *Tayinat Archaeological Project --the website for the current excavations *Oriental Institute page on Tell Tayinat Archaeological sites in Hatay Province Syro-Hittite states Former populated places in Turkey Tells (archaeology) Kura-Araxes culture ","title":"Tell Tayinat"},{"id":"1379981","text":"Hux Flux was the Swedish solo musician Dennis Tapper (November 18, 1974 - May 15, 2018).

He helped found the Frederick Douglass Memorial Hospital and Training School in West Philadelphia in 1895, which he led as chief-of-staff and medical director until he retired in 1933. Early life and education Nathan Mossell was born in Hamilton, Canada in 1856, the fourth of six children. Both his parents, Eliza Bowers (1824 – ?) and Aaron Albert Mossell I (1824 – ?), were descended from freed slaves. According to Mossell's autobiography, his mother's stories of the discrimination and hardship their families faced strengthened her own children's determination to succeed.University of Pennsylvania Archives. Autobiography of Nathan Mossell Mossell's maternal grandfather had resisted all attempts by his owner to make him work and was eventually freed. He married and settled in Baltimore, but the entire family, including Mossell's mother, who was a child at the time, were deported to Trinidad. Mossell's paternal grandfather, who had been transported from the coast of West Africa, managed to buy his freedom and that of his wife. He too settled in Baltimore, where Mossell's father was born. Nathan Mossell's parents met and married in Baltimore after his mother's family return from Trinidad. His father learned the brickmaking trade and saved enough money to buy a house. After the birth of their third child, the couple decided to move to Canada, as free blacks were prohibited from being educated in Maryland and they wanted education for their children. They sold their house in Baltimore and settled in Hamilton, Ontario.

In 1921 their daughter Sadie Tanner Mossell (1898–1989) became the first African-American woman to receive a Ph.D. in the United States, earning a degree in economics at the University of Pennsylvania. During the Civil War, the family moved back to the United States, settling in Lockport, New York, where Mossell's father again owned his own brickmaking business. Along with his siblings, Mossell attended the local public school in Lockport. His schooling became erratic once he started working part-time at age nine for his father. He eventually joined his elder brother Charles at Lincoln University, a historically black college in Pennsylvania, where he studied Natural Science, receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1879. Later life and medical career Frederick Douglass Memorial Hospital which Nathan Mossell helped found in 1895 Mossell went on to study at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, becoming its first African- American graduate in 1882. He did post-graduate training at hospitals in Philadelphia, including the Pennsylvania University Hospital, and later at Guy's Hospital, Queen's Hospital, and St Thomas' Hospital in London. After his return to the United States, in 1888 Mossell became the first black physician elected as member of the Philadelphia County Medical Society. That year he also started his private practice. In 1895, he helped found the Frederick Douglass Memorial Hospital and Training School in West Philadelphia, serving as its chief-of-staff and medical director until his retirement in 1933. Marriage and family He had married Gertrude Emily Hicks Bustill (1848-1955) on July 12, 1893 in Philadelphia. The couple had two daughters, Florence Mossell and Mary Campbell Mossell. Gertrude was the mixed-race daughter of Charles Hicks Bustill (1816–1890), who was of African, European and Lenape ancestry, and Emily Robinson. Gertrude's sister and brother-in law, Maria Louisa Bustill and William Drew Robeson, were the parents of the singer, actor, and Civil Rights advocate Paul Robeson. Private practice After retiring as director of the hospital in 1933, Mossell continued to work in his private practice, which he had opened in 1888. He died on October 27, 1946 in Philadelphia at the age of 90. He was believed to be the oldest practicing black physician at the time of his death.

At this elevation it is the fifth-highest peak in Queensland, after Mount Bartle Frere at 1,622 m, Mount Bellenden Ker at 1,593 m, Mount Fisher at 1,385 m and Mount Carbine Tableland at 1,383 m, all in Far North Queensland. It has an extensive logging history dating back to the mid-19th century. Mount Superbus was originally covered in dense hoop pine forests. Red cedar and other valuable timbers were also heavily logged in the area. It is now part of the Main Range National Park. The peak is a remnant of the Main Range shield volcano which erupted between 25 and 22 million years ago. On the southernmost peak just below the summit lies the wreck of a RAAF Lincoln bomber. It crashed into the mountain in the early hours of Easter Saturday morning on 9 April 1955, during a medical evacuation of a sick baby from Townsville to Eagle Farm airfield in Brisbane. The crew of four RAAF personnel and the two passengers were all killed in this accident. Most of the wreckage still lies near the summit and is a popular day walk for bushwalkers. The Condamine River rises from a spring located on the western slopes of Mount Superbus. Teviot Brook, a major tributary of the Logan River, has its headwaters on the eastern facing slopes of the mountain.

Walkers should be aware that there are hazardous, sheer cliffs along the tracks. The first European to discover and name the mountain was Allan Cunningham in 1828. It was named after William Cordeaux who was the assistant to Sir Thomas Mitchell, the Surveyor-General. Vegetation on the lower parts is mostly rainforest. In higher areas montane heath and grasstrees are found. The giant rock lily grows well on the slopes of Mount Cordeaux.Seeing South-East Queensland (2nd ed.). RACQ. 1980. p 72. The forest is mostly devoid of large red cedar, hoop pine, carabeen, pigeonberry, tulip oak or purple laurel, as Timber-getters in the early 1900s had harvested most of the area of Cunninghams Gap and Goomburra. The first pioneers thought to have climbed to the peak of Mt. cordeaux are a party of five, on 29 December 1910. The party was composed of Mr. T.B. Roscoe of Brisbane, Mr. James H. Bell of Maryvale, and three of Mr. Bell's sons. To commemorate the successful climb \\"T.B.R.\\", \\"J.H.Bell\\", and the date was carved into the summits rock with a tomahawk. This history is disputed as Mr. M.T. O'Connor of Tallebudgera and W.M. Garland of Boonah were reported to have conquered the summit on 30 February 1910. They reported observing marks on trees indicating the use of ropes which led them to believe that the summit had already been climbed.\\"Ascent of Mt.

It is situated in Main Range National Park, between the peaks of Mount Cordeaux and Mount Mitchell. On a clear day the pass forms a distinct break in Main Range's profile as seen from Brisbane.

History The Indigenous name for the location is Cappoong, though the meaning is unknown.\\"Some Native Names\\", The Brisbane Courier, 3 June 1930, p.12 In 1827, Allan Cunningham set out from the upper Hunter River, to explore west of the Dividing Range, exploring the Darling Downs; returning in 1828 from Brisbane to explore Cunninghams Gap. He was aware of the economic benefits that a link between the coast and pastoral lands to the west would provide. Cunningham travelled on the right hand side of the Gap whereas the highway today runs on the lefthand side from Aratula. On 3 July 1909, Cunninghams Gap was declared a national park. This new park, which originally consisted of 3,100 acres, was located on the western side of the range and included Gap Creek. Walking tracks were constructed in the 1930s and 1950s. On 11 June 1927, the 100-year anniversary of Allan Cunningham's exploration of the Darling Downs, the new road through Cunningham's Gap was officially opened by the local Member of Parliament, Sir Littleton Groom. Although the road, which was built entirely by volunteers, was officially open, travelling along this new route was inadvisable, especially on the portion west of Aratula. The road was plagued by problems during this early embryonic stage with the Royal Automobile Club of Queensland announcing that the road was closed, less than one month after it was officially opened. The new sealed road through the gap was eventually opened in November 1949. =Recent= Cunninghams Gap is part of the Cunningham Highway, a federally funded highway managed by the Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads. Between December 2010 and March 2011, the Gap experienced over two metres of rainfall and it sustained an enormous amount of damage. The cost of repairing this seven kilometre stretch of road is projected to be $40 million.

Moss's Well was named after Edward Moss, a contractor who helped build the original road. History Spicers Gap is believed to have been a route for indigenous Australian traders travelling between the inland and the coast. In 1828, Allan Cunningham established the route through the mountains now called Cunninghams Gap. Cunningham named Spicers Gap and Spicers Peak after Peter Beauclerk Spicer, Superintendent of convicts, but didn't suggest the pass should be used for transport. Stockman Henry Alphen discovered Spicers Gap 7 km south of Cunninghams Gap in 1847. The road through the pass was originally built by convicts during the 1850s and 1860s. This trail became an important transport route from to the coast to the agricultural region known as the Darling Downs. Spicers Gap Road used to carry supplies to and from the Darling Downs, is the best remaining example of sophisticated 19th century engineering in Queensland. An inn was built in the area to cater for travellers. After the railway to the Darling Downs via Toowoomba was established the road was used less often.

He led one of the first groups of Mormon pioneers west from Illinois under the leadership of Brigham Young after Joseph Smith's murder. Rich was chosen and served as an apostle of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) under Brigham Young after the Church settled in Utah Territory. President Young asked Rich to open up San Bernardino, California for settlement in 1850, and Bear Lake Valley, located in Utah and Idaho, in 1863. Rich founded many communities in Bear Lake Valley, including Paris, Montpelier, Fish Haven, Ovid, Georgetown, St. Charles, Bloomington, Bennington, Wardboro, Dingle, Glencoe and Pegram in Idaho, and Garden City, Meadowville, and Laketown in Utah. Biography =Personal life= Rich was born in 1809 in Campbell County, Kentucky, to Joseph Rich and Nancy O'Neal. As an adult he reached six feet, 4 inches in height, and was considered a tall man for the time period. Rich was baptized into the early Latter Day Saint church by George M. Hinkle in 1832, after having been taught by Lyman Wight in 1831. In 1838, Rich married Sarah D. Pea (of Looking Glass Prairie, Illinois), whom he had previously proposed to by letter, the two never having met.Autobiography of Sarah Dearmon Pea Rich Rich followed the church's principle of plural marriage, taking six wives and fathering a total of 51 children. In 1863, Rich led a party of early Mormons to colonize parts of southeastern Idaho, which at the time was thought to be part of Utah Territory. The communities of Paris and Geneva, Idaho, as well as some other neighboring towns, were under his direction. Rich died in Paris in 1883 at the age of 75, after suffering several debilitating strokes. His granddaughter, Ada May Rich, became the mother of Laraine Day, who became an actress. Rich was one of the most prominent slave owners in the Utah territory and owned six slaves. =Church leadership= Charles C. Rich in 1880 Rich was a leader in Caldwell County, Missouri, and fought in the Battle of Crooked River in 1838. His log house is the only structure from the Mormon period in 1836–38 in Caldwell County to have survived to this day. After the expulsion of the Latter Day Saints from Missouri, Rich settled in Nauvoo, Illinois, where he was made an original member of the Council of Fifty. He also served as a member of the Nauvoo High Council,Doctrine and Covenants 124:132 (LDS Church ed.). and as a brigadier and major general in the Nauvoo Legion. After the death of Joseph Smith, Rich followed the leadership of Brigham Young and the surviving Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. He and his family migrated to what became Utah with the main body of the church in 1847, leading a pioneer company that arrived October of that year. When Young and the other apostles returned that winter to Winter Quarters, Nebraska, Rich served as a counselor to John Smith, who presided over the early pioneers in the Salt Lake Valley. In October 1848, Rich was made the president of the Salt Lake Stake.Larson, Andrew Karl, Erastus Snow: The Life of a Missionary and Pioneer for the Early Mormon Church (Salt Lake City, Utah: University of Utah Press, 1971) p. 188. Brigham Young appointed Rich a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles on February 12, 1849. Rich helped form a Latter-day Saint settlement in San Bernardino, California. However, this settlement attracted many people who wanted to avoid Young and other leaders of the LDS Church. The members who supported Young were asked to return to Utah in 1857 at the time of the Utah War. At the request of President Brigham Young, Charles C.

Made up mostly of Creek of the Upper Towns that supported traditional leadership and culture, as well as the preservation of communal land for cultivation and hunting, the Red Sticks arose at a time of increasing pressure on Creek territory by European-American settlers. Creek of the Lower Towns were closer to the settlers, had more mixed-race families, and had already been forced to make land cessions to the Americans. In this context, the Red Sticks led a resistance movement against European-American encroachment and assimilation, tensions that culminated in the outbreak of the Creek War in 1813. Initially a civil war among the Creek, the conflict drew in United States state forces while the nation was already engaged in the War of 1812 against the British. Background The term \\"Red Sticks\\" (alternatively \\"Redsticks\\" or \\"Red Clubs\\"), was derived from the name of the 2-foot-long wooden war club, or atássa, used by the Creeks. The preferred weapon of the Red Stick warriors, this war club had a red-painted wooden handle with a curve at its head that held a small piece of iron, steel, or bone projecting about two inches.Waselkov (2009), A Conquering Spirit, pp. 86-88.Ceremonial red sticks were used by Creek medicine men, and are thought by some to be relevant. The Red Sticks faction came primarily from the Upper Towns of the Creek Confederacy and supported traditional leadership and culture, including the preservation of communal land for cultivation and hunting, while opposing assimilation into European-American culture. The Creeks had a matrilineal culture, in which a person's place and status were determined by their maternal clan. The Creeks of the Lower Towns, who comprised the majority of the population, had adopted more European-American ways; in addition, they had more intermarriage among their women with white traders and settlers, and economic relations with the United States settlers. At the same time, the mixed-race children, such as the chiefs William Weatherford and William McIntosh, were generally raised among the Creek. Benjamin Hawkins, who was first appointed as United States Indian agent in the Southeast and then as Superintendent of Indian Affairs in the territory south of the Ohio River, lived among the Creek and Choctaw and knew them well. He commented in letters to President Thomas Jefferson that Creek women were matriarchs and had control of children \\"when connected with a white man\\". Hawkins further observed that even wealthy traders were nearly as \\"inattentive\\" to their mixed-race children as \\"the Indians\\"; Benjamin Griffith argues that Hawkins failed to understand the closer relationship that children in Creek culture had with their mother's eldest brother, closer than with their biological father, because of the importance of the clan structure. William McIntosh Chief of Coweta was a leader of the Lower Creeks. During the Creek war he opposed the Red Sticks and sided with the Americans instead. He joined Andrew Jackson as a Major who was impressed with him. Because he was half white and in Jackson's eyes \\"civilized\\" he was able to gain Jackson's trust and when Gorgians attacked friendly Creek settlements only McIntosh's complaints made it to the government. His actions in the Creek War mainly joining Jackson alienated him after the war was over in Creek Society. England was one of the man nations that helped and encouraged the Indians to fight against America, mainly as a diversionary tactic. Most of their influence with the Indian tribes flowed from the Great lakes region. That was until Tecumseh visited the Upper Creeks and convinced them to make war against the United States. When incomplete reports of the Creek War reached Vice Admiral Sir Alexander Forrester Inglis Cochrane he was impressed. Though he did not know the Creeks where in a civil war and that other tribes like the Choctaws, Chickasaws and Cherokees joined the Americans. He wanted to strike the gulf coast and wanted to use the Indians as a diversion from the Canadian theater. He sent Captain Hugh Pigot who anchored by the mouth of the Apalachicola river on May 10, 1814. They proceeded to give the Indians arms and a small British attachment of men. Pigot then reported to his superiors that he could have as much as 2,800 Creek and Seminoles trained in 8 to 10 weeks. This report would eventually lead to the battle of New Orleans six months later. The time in question was one of increasing pressure on Creek territory by European-American settlers. The Creeks of the Lower Towns, who were closer to the settlers and had more mixed- race families, had already been forced to make numerous land cessions to the Americans. The Red Stick War, more commonly called the Creek War (1813–1814), was essentially a civil war as the Creeks struggled among themselves for their future; after the Lower Creeks issued a statement of \\"unqualified and unanimous friendship for the United States\\", tensions broke out into violence. Red Sticks attacked the Lower Creek towns. The Red Sticks were backed by the British, who were engaged in the War of 1812 against the United States, and the Spanish, who were trying to retain a foothold in Florida and in territories to the west of the Louisiana Territory. Armed actions =Skirmish over arms= The Red Sticks were involved with the skirmish that become known as the Battle of Burnt Corn. The armed conflict occurred when a group of Red Sticks were attacked by American white militiamen while returning from Florida with arms in 1813. After the initial assault, the Red Sticks regrouped and defeated these troops. While the militia had provoked the attack, frontier settlers and U.S. officials became alarmed about the Red Sticks' actions on the frontier as a result. =Massacre at Fort Mims= The Red Sticks decided to attack the garrison at Fort Mims in the Mississippi Territory (present-day Tensaw, in southwestern Alabama), in an attempt to reduce the influence of the Tensaw Creek who controlled the fort. Also at the fort were intermarried whites, and other settlers and their slaves from the frontier who had become alarmed after the battle that had occurred at Burnt Corn. The fort was poorly guarded and the Red Sticks overwhelmed its defenses on 30 August 1813, killing most of the people who had taken refuge there. Estimates of the number of settlers at Fort Mims at the time of the massacre vary from 300 or so to 500 (including whites, slaves, and Lower Creek). Estimates of survivors have varied; at the most, about three dozen have been claimed. At least 100 Creek attackers were found dead at the scene of the battle. History graduate student Karl Davis, in a manner contrary to prevailing scholarship at the time, interpreted the attack in a journal article treatment as a punitive expedition specifically directed against the Tensaw, a group of Lower Creek who were \\"separated from core Creek values.\\" Hence, Davis does not believe the Fort Mims attack was representative of the overall conflict between the Upper and Lower Towns. = Battle of Horseshoe Bend = Jackson led a force of 3,000 men to Horseshoe Bend (Tohopeka in Creek), from Fort Williams on the 14th of March. This was after his scouts reported a force of 1,000 Red Sticks warriors and their families were living there. Jackson's army had to march over 60 miles of rugged terrain. Before they left he gave out a warning that anyone who retreated without being compelled by significant force would be executed. Jackson's army arrived on March 26 and set up camp six miles away near the site of the battle of Emuckfau Creek. The day before, the Creek's commander, William Weatherford, left to be with his pregnant wife, leaving Chief Menewa in charge. Jackson's cavalry and mounted horsemen, under the command of Coffee, left at 3 a.m. to cross the Tallapoosa river and cut off the Red Sticks' retreat and prevent reinforcements. Coffee's brigade was made up of 700 mounted infantry and 600 allied Indians. Meanwhile Jackson marched to the breastworks. He had one six pound and one three pound artillery piece that started a bombardment at 10:30 a.m.. This lasted till noon when Jackson realized that it was having little effect and decided to storm the fortifications. The first person to scale the fortification was Major Lemuel Montgomery who was promptly shot in the head. The fight for the breastworks was a quick but bloody affair but in the end Jackson's men prevailed. The Red Sticks fell back to their second line of defense, a breastwork of logs and underbrush. The Creeks asked for no quarter while their prophets where saying that it would be worse if they were captured. Jackson offered them a chance to surrender and instead the Creeks fired on the party offering it. The fighting lasted until sunset. During the battle atrocities took place. In one instance a five-year-old boy was killed with the butt of a musket because \\"someday the boy would be a warrior.\\" Another person killed an Indian who was just sitting down because he wanted to brag about it. After the fighting was over some soldiers started to cut skin from Indians to make bridle reins. In the end only thirty-two Americans were killed, and ninety-nine were injured. In contrast only twenty Red Sticks were able to escape, including their leader Menewa. Some of the notable people present at the battle were: Sam Houston, John Coffee, and Andrew Jackson Aftermath The massacre had significant short-term and long-term effects. Alarmed by the fall of the fort and understanding little of internal Creek tensions, settlers demanded government protection from the Creek. With federal forces otherwise engaged in the War of 1812, Georgia, Tennessee, and the Mississippi Territory raised state militias for defense and engaged Native American allies, such as the Cherokee, traditional enemy of the Creek. Historian Frank L. Owsley, Jr. suggests that the state-sponsored military activity in the area likely prevented the British from occupying an undefended Gulf Coast in 1814. General Andrew Jackson commanded the state militias to campaign against the Red Sticks. The US forces finally defeated the Creeks at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814) on March 27, 1814. His forces killed or captured most of the Creek, but some survivors escaped to Florida, where they joined the Seminole tribe and continued the resistance to the United States. The war had begun over internal divisions among Creeks who resisted the assimilation and loss of traditions, led by the chiefs William Weatherford, Menawa, and Peter McQueen of the Upper Towns. The war heightened the hostility between the Creeks and the Americans in the Southeast, at a time when Americans had steadily encroached on Creek and other Native American tribes' territories, forcing land cessions under numerous treaties but always demanding more. After the war, the Creeks were forced to cede half their remaining lands to the US. Within twenty years, they lost the remainder of their lands as a result of the Indian Removal Act, and the forced removal to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. Some remnant Creeks chose to stay in Alabama and Mississippi and become state and US citizens, but treaty provisions to secure their land were not followed, and many became landless. Some Creeks migrated to Florida, where they joined the Seminoles. Memorial The stockade and fort have been reconstructed at the historic site. The state installed a historic plaque at the Fort Mims site that notes the British had provided weapons to the Red Sticks as part of its campaign against Captain Kaleb Johnson's troops in the South during the War of 1812.

This species was formerly placed in the genus Antheraea. Distribution The emperor gum moth may inhabit all states of Australia, however it is scarce in the more southerly states where the climate is less suitable. They are also found as an introduced species on both the North and South Islands of New Zealand. = Caterpillars = The caterpillar of the emperor gum moth in its last stage before pupation Caterpillars can usually be found on young adult leaves between October and March (the Australian Spring and Summer). When the caterpillars hatch they are black with short hairs on top of small nodes on their bodies called tubercles. The hairs are not poisonous and will not sting. As the caterpillars mature they change color each time they shed their skin (which totals to five stages in the caterpillar's appearance). The fully grown caterpillars are usually found on the highest branches of the host tree where the leaves are the youngest and easiest to digest. By the final stage before pupation the caterpillars have developed striking coloration, having a yellow/cream stripe down their bright green/blue body and nodes of red and blue. Despite this they are still surprisingly hard to spot. The caterpillar stage in the emperor gum moth's life cycle can last for many weeks, depending on the temperature and weather conditions. =Cocoon= The emperor gum moth in its tough brown cocoon When the caterpillar is fully mature it spins a dark brown silken cocoon on a branch which usually has a leaf to protect it with. When spinning is complete, the caterpillar sheds its final skin and takes the form of its pupal life stage. Within a day of spinning completion, the cocoon sets to a hard waterproof shell with a rough exterior and a smooth interior wall. Air holes can be seen along the side of the cocoon indicating that the cocoon is probably otherwise airtight. The moth usually emerges from the cocoon the following year (in Spring or early Summer) but depending on weather conditions can stay in the cocoon from anywhere between two and five years. One case has even been recorded of a moth emerging out of the cocoon after 10 years. When the metamorphosis is complete, the adult moth regurgitates a fluid to soften the tough cocoon and then cuts a hole using sharp hooks on the base of each forewing. The effort to release itself from the cocoon is vital for its wings to expand and dry after emerging. Pupae cut from the cocoon will hatch, but the moths' wings will never expand. =Adult moths= The emperor gum moth does not feed after it emerges from the cocoon, relying solely on the energy it stored as a caterpillar. Their adult life span is limited to a couple of weeks in which they mate, lay eggs and die. The moths, like the caterpillars, are very striking in appearance. The emperor gum moth is a very large moth, having a wingspan of 120 to 150 mm. Females are generally larger than males. The furry wings and body are multi-colored, but are in overall tones of pale reddish/brown. The wings are decorated with four prominent ‘eyes’ and various other markings in a symmetrical formation. The antennae of the males are feathery, while the females' are thinner and with fewer hairs. Biological significance This insect was the first used in the successful development of continuous insect cell cultures. Dr. Thomas D. C. Grace, a researcher with CSIRO, developed four cell lines from the ovaries of this insect and reported on them in 1962. This was a significant breakthrough since efforts to grow insect cells in culture had been attempted for decades previously. Modifications of the medium used in these efforts, Grace's insect medium, is still in use today for growing many of the insect cell lines that have since been developed (approximately 600 distinct cell lines from more than 125 insect species).

Nate Saint was born in 1923. When he was seven he took his first plane ride with his brother Sam, who would eventually become a commercial pilot for American Airlines. While in the airplane he discovered a love of flying. His family was somewhat unusual. His brothers made a sleeping patio on the roof of their home, and his dad built a roller coaster in the backyard. When he joined the army he was stationed in Las Vegas NV, but was transferred to several other locations over the years. A leg injury from a sledding accident caused him some problems while he was in the army. About a year before he was discharged, he almost died while climbing a mountain in Yosemite National Park..  Becoming a Missionary  When Nate was asked by a friend to fix a plane somewhere in Mexico, he agreed. After he repaired the plane, he discovered a need for his skill in the field of mission-work and also a new awareness of the value of missions. After going to Wheaton College, Nate married Marjorie Farris (commonly called Marj) in 1948 and eventually moved to Shell Mera, Ecuador. Here, Nate built his family a house which would also serve as a guesthouse and a radio center with the other missionaries.  Operation Auca  In September 1955, Nate was joined by his teammates, Jim Elliot, Ed McCully, Pete Fleming, and Roger Youderian. Saint finally found a [Huaorani also known as Aucas] settlement while searching by air. To reach the tribe, Saint and the team lowered gifts to the Huaorani in a bucket tied to the plane. The Huaorani were widely feared by other Ecuadorians, because they combined a desire to be left alone with a willingness to use force. They attacked and killed any intruders without provocation. Nevertheless, the tribe was excited on receiving the gifts and gave some gifts back. Finally, the missionaries decided to try to meet the Huaorani on the ground; and, on January 3, 1956, using the beach as a landing strip, they set up camp four miles from the Huaorani settlement. Their initial contact was encouraging; however, on Sunday, January 8, 1956, the entire team was killed on the beach (known as \\"Palm Beach\\") when armed Huaorani met and speared them. Nate Saint was the third of the five missionaries to be speared to death. Saint and the other four men became famous worldwide as a result. Life magazine published a 10-page photo essay on the story, which was also covered in Reader's Digest and many other publications. As of 2015, a small school for missionary children in Shell, Ecuador, bears Nate Saint's name. After 51 years, the school closed in 2017 due to falling enrollment. Rachel Saint, Nate's sister, continued the mission efforts to the Huaorani. This resulted in many of these natives becoming Christians, including those who had killed Saint. In 1966, Marjorie (Marj) Farris Saint married Abe Van Der Puy, president of HCJB World Radio. Abe died in 2003, and Marj died in 2004, from cancer. She is buried in Hillcrest Memorial Gardens, south of Ocala, Florida. Nate's older son, Steve Saint, spent time as a child visiting his missionary family members and friends and getting to know the Huaorani. Steve was baptized by Mincaye, who was the very man who killed his father but later converted. As of 2006, Steve Saint works with the Huaorani people and travels around the world, preaching the gospel, often accompanied by Mincaye. A documentary based on the story, Beyond Gates of Splendor, was released in 2005. The following year, a feature film, End of the Spear, was released on January 20, a week and a half after the 50-year anniversary of the killings. Steve Saint also helped write Jungle Pilot, based on his father's diary about his time in Ecuador and work with the Huaorani Indians. Steven Curtis Chapman wrote the song No Greater Love from his album Declaration (Steven Curtis Chapman album) as a tribute to Nate and his fellow missionaries.

It was one of the earliest permanent settlements in Wexford County and was the first county seat. Sherman is located at the point where four townships meet and portions lie within each of the townships. It is at the northwest corner of Antioch Township, the southwest corner of Hanover Township, the southeast corner of Wexford Township, and the northeast corner of Springville Township. It is situated on M-37 near where it crosses the Manistee River, just a couple miles northeast of the village of Mesick. The first known permanent white settler in the county, B. W. Hall, settled near Sherman in the early 1860s.Wheeler, John H. (1903). History of Wexford County, Michigan, pp. 225-26. B. F. Bowen. A store was opened in 1867 and was at first known as Manistee Bridge because of proximity to the bridge over the Manistee River on the Newaygo and Northport State Road (built in 1857 and is approximately the route of present-day M-37 in the county) which connected Newaygo to the south with Northport on the Leelanau Peninsula to the north. The road opened the area for settlement, as it was previously practically inaccessible. The settlement gained a post office in 1868 named Sherman, after the Civil War General William T. Sherman. Sherman was platted in 1869 and incorporated as a village in 1887.Wheeler (1903), pp. 269, 273. Fires destroyed the business district and the village disincorporated sometime in the 1920s. Sherman was the county seat until 1881, when, as a result of the so-called \\"Battle of Sherman\\", the seat was moved first to Manton and a short time later to Cadillac.

He started painting these studies after a trip to Spain in 1851. He was nicknamed John 'Spanish' Phillip. Life Born into a poor family in Aberdeen in Scotland, Phillip's artistic talent was recognised at an early age. Lord Panmure paid for Phillip to become the student of Thomas Musgrave Joy in London briefly in 1836.Paul Stirton, ‘Phillip, John (1817–1867)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2009 accessed 6 Oct 2013 His education at the Royal Academy of Arts was paid for by Panmure. While at the academy, Phillip became a member of The Clique, a group of aspirant artists organised by Richard Dadd. The Clique identified as followers of William Hogarth and David Wilkie. Phillip's own career was to follow that of fellow-Scot Wilkie very closely, beginning with carefully detailed paintings depicting the lives of Scottish crofters. He moved on to much more broadly painted scenes of Spanish life influenced by Bartolomé Esteban Murillo and Diego Velázquez. Phillip's early works tended to depict pious Scots families. In 1851 he visited Spain after he was advised to travel to southern Europe for his health. Thereafter he concentrated on Spanish subjects. The first of these, The Letter Writer, Seville, displayed the influence of Pre-Raphaelitism, a movement he had previously opposed, along with most other members of The Clique, despite his friendship with Millais, one of its leaders. He was so influenced by his travels that he advised other artists to do the same. Some artists, such as Edwin Long, took this advice and were similarly inspired. In the late 1850s and 1860s, Phillip's style became much broader and more painterly, in line with Millais's late work. Phillip's two most important paintings in these years were The Early Career of Murillo (1864) and La Gloria (1865, National Gallery of Scotland). The first depicted the young Murillo drawing his art from Spanish street-life; the second portrayed a Spanish wake for a dead child. Phillip was commissioned to paint the wedding in 1858 of Victoria, Princess Royal to Prince Frederick William of Prussia, later German Emperor Frederick III. Phillip married Richard Dadd's sister. Like her brother she became insane. Phillip died of a stroke while visiting William Powell Frith in Kensington. Phillip's self-portrait, The Evil Eye, commissioned by his close friend Patrick Allan-Fraser, is in Hospitalfield House in Arbroath, along with portraits of other members of The Clique.

United States, 98 U.S. 145 (1878), was a Supreme Court of the United States case that held that religious duty was not a defense to a criminal indictment.. Reynolds was the first Supreme Court opinion to address the First Amendment's protection of religious liberties, impartial juries and the Confrontation Clauses of the Sixth Amendment. George Reynolds was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), charged with bigamy under the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act after marrying Amelia Jane Schofield while still married to Mary Ann Tuddenham in Utah Territory. He was secretary to Brigham Young and presented himself as a test of the federal government's attempt to outlaw polygamy. An earlier conviction was overturned on technical grounds. Background The LDS Church, believing that the law unconstitutionally deprived its members of their First Amendment right to freely practice their religion, chose to challenge the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act. The First Presidency decided to furnish a defendant to establish a test case to be brought before the United States Supreme Court, to determine the constitutionality of the anti-bigamy law. Reynolds, a secretary in the office of the president of the church, agreed to serve as the defendant He provided the United States Attorney with numerous witnesses who could testify of his being married to two wives, and was indicted for bigamy by a grand jury on October 31, 1874. In 1875, Reynolds was convicted and sentenced to two years in prison at hard labor (a provision not included in the statute) and a fine of five hundred dollars. In 1876 the Utah Territorial Supreme Court upheld the sentence. Previously, U.S. Attorney William Carey promised to stop his attempts to indict general authorities during the test case. However when Carey failed to keep his promise and arrested George Q. Cannon, LDS Church leaders decided that they would no longer cooperate with him.Larson, \\"Government, Politics, and Conflict,\\" pp. 252, 254. Prior history Reynolds was indicted in the District Court for the 3rd Judicial District of the Territory of Utah under sect. 5352 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, which stated, as quoted in the Supreme Court decision: Reynolds tried to have the jury instructed that if they found he committed bigamy with the only intention of following his religion, then he must be found not guilty. The trial court refused this request and instructed the jury that if they found that Reynolds, under religious influence, \\"deliberately married a second time, having a first wife living, the want of consciousness of evil intent—the want of understanding on his part that he was committing crime—did not excuse him, but the law inexorably, in such cases, implies criminal intent.\\" After being found guilty by the lower court, Reynolds appealed to the Utah Territorial Supreme Court, which upheld the conviction. Decision Reynolds' attorneys, George W. Biddle and Ben Sheeks, appealed the Utah Territorial Supreme Court decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, consisting of Chief Justice Morrison Remick Waite, and Associate Justices Joseph P. Bradley, Nathan Clifford, Stephen Johnson Field, John Marshall Harlan I, Ward Hunt, Samuel Freeman Miller, William Strong, Noah Haynes Swayne. On 14 November 1878, arguments were heard in the Reynolds case before the United States Supreme Court. Reynolds' attorneys argued that his conviction for bigamy should be overturned on four issues: (1) that it was his religious duty to marry multiple times, the practice of which the First Amendment protected as his fundamental duty of his religion; (2) that his grand jury had not been legally constituted; (3) that challenges of certain jurors were improperly overruled; and (4) that testimony was not admissible as it was under another indictment. On 6 January 1879, the Court issued its unanimous decision for Reynolds v. United States. The Court affirmed Reynolds's conviction unanimously and rejected Reynolds' argument that the Latter-day Saint practice of plural marriage was protected by the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the Constitution. Thus, his conviction was upheld, as was the constitutionality of the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act. Chief Justice Morrison Waite wrote on behalf of himself and seven colleagues. Justice Field wrote a concurrence that dissented on one minor point. At a subsequent day of the term, on a petition for rehearing, it was pointed out that Reynolds' sentence to \\"hard labor\\" was not a part of the statute. MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the court not affirm the sentence of the lower court. > \\"Since our judgment in this case was announced, a petition for rehearing has > been filed, in which our attention is called to the fact that the sentence > of the [98 U.S. 145, 169] court below requires the imprisonment to be at > hard labor, when the act of Congress under which the indictment was found > provides for punishment by imprisonment only. This was not assigned for > error on the former hearing, and we might on that account decline to > consider it now; but as the irregularity is one which appears on the face of > the record, we vacate our former judgment of affirmance, and reverse the > judgment of the court below for the purpose of correcting the only error > which appears in the record, to wit, in the form of the sentence. The cause > is remanded, with instructions to cause the sentence of the District Court > to be set aside and a new one entered on the verdict in all respects like > that before imposed, except so far as it requires the imprisonment to be at > hard labor.\\" =Religious duty argument= The Court considered whether Reynolds could use religious belief or duty as a defense. Reynolds had argued that as a Mormon, it was his religious duty as a male member of the church to practice polygamy if possible. The Court recognized that under the First Amendment, the Congress cannot pass a law that prohibits the free exercise of religion. However it held that the law prohibiting bigamy did not meet that standard. The principle that a person could only be married singly, not plurally, existed since the times of King James I of England in English law, upon which United States law was based. The Court investigated the history of religious freedom in the United States and quoted a letter from Thomas Jefferson in which he wrote that there was a distinction between religious belief and action that flowed from religious belief. The former \\"lies solely between man and his God,\\" therefore \\"the legislative powers of the government reach actions only, and not opinions.\\" The Court upheld the criminalization of polygamy on the reasoning that polygamy was “odious among the northern and western nations of Europe, and, until the establishment of the Mormon Church, almost exclusively a feature of the life of Asiatic and of African people.” As such [polygamy] “fetters the people in stationary despotism.”Reynolds v. United States, 98 U.S. 145, 166, 25 L. Ed. 244 (1878) Following this reasoning the Court considered that if polygamy was allowed, someone might eventually argue that human sacrifice or bride burning was a necessary part of their religion, and \\"to permit this would be to make the professed doctrines of religious belief superior to the law of the land, and in effect to permit every citizen to become a law unto himself.\\" The Court ruled the First Amendment forbade Congress from legislating against opinion, but allowed it to legislate against action. =Other arguments= Reynolds argued that the grand jury that had indicted him was not legal. United States law at that time required that a grand jury consist of no fewer than 16 persons. The grand jury that indicted Reynolds had only 15 persons. The court rejected this argument because the Utah Territory had passed a law in 1870 under which a grand jury had to consist of only 15 persons. During his original trial, Reynolds had challenged two jurors, both of whom stated that they had formed an opinion on the guilt or innocence of Reynolds before the trial. The court held that universal education and press reports made it hard to find jurors who had not formed some opinion. It found that Reynolds had failed to meet the requirement that he, as challenger of a juror's objectivity, demonstrate that a juror had developed a real and strong opinion. The prosecution had discharged two potential jurors who refused to say whether or not they were living in polygamy. The Court held that it would not overturn a case based on the legality of challenges to dismissed jurors. The Court held that evidence Amelia Jane Schofield, Reynold's second wife, gave during an earlier trial of Reynolds for the same offense but under a different indictment was admissible. Schofield could not be found during the second trial and so evidence from the previous trial was used. The Court held that \\"if a witness is kept away by the adverse party, his testimony, taken on a former trial between the same parties upon the same issues, may be given in evidence\\". The court held that Reynolds had every opportunity under oath to reveal the whereabouts of Schofield. This was the one point on which Justice Field dissented, finding that the evidence should not have been allowed. Reynolds had argued that the jury had been improperly instructed by the judge when he told them that they \\"should consider what are to be the consequences to the innocent victims of this delusion\\". Reynolds argued that this introduced prejudice to the jury. The Court held that Reynolds had freely admitted that he was a bigamist. All the judge had done was \\"call the attention of the jury to the peculiar character of the crime\\" and had done so \\"not to make them partial, but to keep them impartial\\". Reaction George Q. Cannon, representative of the territory, wrote in response to this decision:Gustive O. Larson, Federal Government Efforts to \\"Americanize\\" Utah Before Admission to Statehood, pp. ?? The New York Times defended the decision, noting that the 1862 act that banned bigamy, though \\"obviously directed at the polygamous practices of the Mormons, merely extended over the Territories the common law in relation to bigamy which exists in every State of the Union.\\" Its editorial ridiculed the Mormon defense of polygamy as a religious practice and said: \\"Similarly, a sect which should pretend, or believe, that incest, infanticide, or murder was a divinely appointed ordinance, to be observed under certain conditions, could set up that the enforcement of the common law, as against either [sic] of these practices, was an invasion of the rights of conscience.\\" Wall of separation between church and state The abovementioned Thomas Jefferson letter was an 1802 letter to the Danbury Baptists. They were a religious minority which was concerned about the dominant position of the Congregational church in Connecticut and which voiced its concerns in a letter dated October 7, 1801, to the newly elected President Thomas Jefferson against a government establishment of religion. Jefferson wrote in return to the Baptists that the United States Bill of Rights prevents the establishment of a national church, and in so doing they did not have to fear government interference in their right to expressions of religious conscience: > Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man & > his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, > that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, and not > opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole > American people which declared that their legislature should \\"make no law > respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise > thereof\\", thus building a wall of separation between Church & State. > Adhering to this expression of the supreme will of the nation in behalf of > the rights of conscience, I shall see with sincere satisfaction the progress > of those sentiments which tend to restore to man all his natural rights, > convinced he has no natural right in opposition to his social duties. The metaphor \\"a wall of separation between Church and State\\" used by Jefferson was first used by Chief Justice Morrison Waite in the Reynolds case. American historian George Bancroft was consulted by Waite in the Reynolds case regarding the views on establishment by the framers of the U.S. constitution. Bancroft advised Waite to consult Jefferson. Waite then discovered the above quoted letter in a library after skimming through the index to Jefferson’s collected works according to historian Don Drakeman.

Zamora was the silver medalist at the 1972 Munich Olympics. He enjoyed a meteoric rise in his professional career. He was the Lineal and WBA Bantamweight champion of the world, and made six title defenses. Amateur career Bantamweight silver medalist at the 1972 Olympics in Munich. Results were: *Defeated Ricardo Fortaleza (Philippines) KO 2 *Defeated Stefan Forster (West Germany) points *Defeated Juan Francisco Rodríguez (Spain) KO 3 *Defeated Ricardo Carreras (United States) points *Lost to Orlando Martinez (Cuba) points Professional career =World Bantamweight Championship= He won the Lineal and WBA Bantamweight championship on 14 March 1975 when he knocked out Soo-Hwan Hong in four rounds, two years after turning pro. Zamora defended his title twice that year via knockout, against Thanomchit Sukhothai and Socrates Batoto. On April 3, 1976, he knocked out future hall-of-famer Eusebio Pedroza in the second round. Later that year, he successfully defended his title via knockout against Gilberto Illueca and a rematch with Soo-Hwan Hong. =Zamora vs. Zarate= Fighting contemporaneously, and holding the WBC crown, was the fellow-Mexican legend, Carlos Zárate Serna. A showdown between the two was inevitable and they met in a non-title match on 23 April 1977. Zamora went into the bout sporting a record of 29 wins in 29 fights, all by knockout. Zarate's record was an equally impressive 45 fights, 45 wins, with 44 KOs. In a largely anticipated fight Zarate scored a technical knockout over Zamora in the fourth round. Zamora never seemed to recover from this loss. In his next fight he lost his Lineal and WBA Bantamweight titles to Jorge Luján by knockout in the tenth round. His record thereafter was spotty, and he even was stopped on 16 November 1979 by Eddie Logan, who sported a record of 5 wins and 7 losses. He retired after losing, again by knockout, to Rigoberto Estrada on 19 September 1980. In 1983, Zamora was to fight Wilfredo Gomez, the fight ultimately was canceled. Zamora was a knockout seeker, but he seemed to lose confidence after his devastating loss to Zarate. Nevertheless, he was selected at Number 47 on The Ring list of 100 greatest punchers of all time.

It was a three-day race featuring skiing, trail running and kayaking. The idea for the event came from Robin Judkins, who became the race's director, and his friend and business partner Peter Tocker; they were running Motatapu Canoes (later called the Outdoor Adventure Centre) in Wanaka. Judkins was skiing with the general manager of Radio Otago and asked for a job as a radio announcer. A few days later, Judkins was asked to do a voice test by talking about his idea for the Alpine Ironman. He made up a story as he went along, including that Peter Hillary would be competing, and that the first prize would be a trip around the world. When the radio station told him that they wanted to broadcast this recording, Judkins was dumbfounded: \\"You're joking.\\" They didn't, and Judkins went to Christchurch to find a sponsor, and organised the event within five weeks. For the first three years, the Alpine Ironman was held at Wanaka. The next four events were based at Methven. The last three races were held at Queenstown. In 1990, the event was postponed as Judkins was organising the 22-day blockbuster event Xerox Challenge; the Alpine Ironman was not held again. Judkins went on to organise the Coast to Coast race from 1983, and became widely known through having organised the 1990 Xerox Challenge.

He created the Alpine Ironman and the Coast to Coast, races that are often credited for being the origin of adventure racing. He has published an autobiography, Mad Dogs: Life on the Edge. Early life Judkins was born at Geraldine in 1949 to parents Mary Marjorie \\"Dot\\" Dwyer (born 1910) and Walter Judkins. He was one of their nine children. The family lived on Sunny Downs farm in South Canterbury before moving to Diamond Harbour when he was ten. They retired to Christchurch in 1964. Judkins' mother died in March 2018 aged 108. The former racewalker Anne Judkins is his niece. Judkins received his schooling at St Bede's College and was an A-grade student, but never showed any interest in education. He was the captain of the school's rugby team for a while. Aged 16, he discovered skiing, which became his lifelong passion. He spent a year at the University of Canterbury and seven months at Christchurch Teachers' College to become a teacher, but he failed \\"miserably\\" because he had not learned how to swot. Young adulthood In his early 20s, Judkins followed the winter whenever he had money to travel, and skied in North America and New Zealand. He competed in ski racing and his best result was a tenth place in the New Zealand nationals in 1973. He had a variety of employers and never stayed anywhere for more than two years. He wrote a book of poetry for which he could not find a publisher in New Zealand, but moved to Australia and utilised the 50% subsidy that Gough Whitlam's government was offering towards Australian-produced literature; Judkins successfully claimed to be Australian to receive the subsidy towards 600 copies of Burning Days in 1976. He then took a job as a travelling salesman for McGraw-Hill Publishing and the luxury of having an expense account turned him into a chronic alcoholic. He refused further travel to stem his drinking and lost his job. Judkins has abstained from drinking any alcohol since. The redundancy money from McGraw-Hill Publishing paid for a relocation of Judkins and his girlfriend Lorraine to London. They returned to Sydney by 1977 and he became self-employed as a house-painter. In 1979, he moved back to New Zealand. Judkins and his girlfriend got married, and they had two daughters. He split up with his wife in 2002. Sports administration Judkins organised his first sports event in 1975, the Coca-Cola Freestyle Skiing Contest. He fell out with his two partners and proceeded alone, vowing to never again team up with others for organising an event. After his time in Australia and London, his next venture into sport as a business was to set up Motatapu Canoes; the idea to do so came to him when he was kayaking the Motatapu River with his friend Peter Tocker. They had a high-profile launch of the company by the local MP, Warren Cooper, who attended as Minister of Tourism. Things went wrong during the launch and, according to Judkins, Cooper nearly drowned. But promotion has always been important to Judkins, and the publicity helped to get off to a good start. Aiming for greater things, they changed the name of the company to Outdoor Adventure Centre. Part of their plan was to offer private expeditions called 'Aspiring to the Pacific', and when he and Tocker did a test run, it took them twelve days to complete it. Somewhere on the Clutha River, the idea came to them that they should have started on the West Coast, so that the expedition went from coast to coast. It was the nucleus of the idea for the Coast to Coast adventure race that began several years later in 1983. Judkins decided in 1982 to organise the Coast to Coast race, and had secured sponsorship from Macpac through his friend Geoff Gabbites, one of Macpac's former directors. Judkins returned to Wanaka for the summer to organise funding for the Coast to Coast, and he organised three rock concerts; one in Wanaka and two in Queenstown. The first concert had insufficient attendance for Judkins to even break even, the second event was rained out, and it was too cold and miserable for the third concert to go ahead. Judkins sold his house to pay off his debts. The first Coast to Coast race was held in 1983 with 79 competitors. It was not until the 1986 that Judkins made his first profit from the annual event. He invested his earnings in the Ohau skifield, but it was taken out by a major avalanche on day 13 of its operation. In 1987, a television documentary was produced while Judkins held the Alpine Ironman. A lifelong fan of English singer-songwriter and guitarist Chris Rea, he took the opportunity to meet with the Brit while he was on a concert tour. The outcome of this was permission to use three titles from Rea's album Wired to the Moon to be used for the soundtrack. 1987 was also the year that the Coast to Coast became a one-day event. 1992 was very challenging for Judkins. He organised the Coast to Coast, tried to get a Scottish version of the event up and running, tried to find sponsorship so that he could repeat the 1990 Xerox Challenge, and he organised a mountain marathon to be held on the Milford Track – the Milford Mountain Marathon. The latter event was most contentious and caused much angst, including death threats, physical attacks and anonymous phone calls. Judkins fought a very public fight with politicians and conservationists, including Gerry McSweeney, and obtained all the approvals and permits, but cancelled the event. He was exhausted and disillusioned. He sold the Coast to Coast event to Queenstown-based Trojan Holdings Ltd on 10 May 2013 on his 64th birthday. He acted as race director in 2014 for the final time at the 33rd event. In the 2009 Queen's Birthday Honours, Judkins was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to sports administration.

These have multiple commercial applications, the majority of which are based on its pleasant scent (floral, with a touch of spiciness). The word linalool is based on linaloe (a type of wood) and the suffix '.: \\"International Scientific Vocabulary, from Mexican Spanish lináloe\\" It has other names such as β-linalool, alcohol, linaloyl oxide, allo-ocimenol, and 3,7-dimethyl-1,6-octadien-3-ol. Nature Over 200 species of plants produce linalool, mainly from the families Lamiaceae (mint and other herbs), Lauraceae (laurels, cinnamon, rosewood), and Rutaceae (citrus fruits), but also birch trees and other plants, from tropical to boreal climate zones. Also some fungi produce this chemical. Enantiomers (S)-(+)-linalool (left) and (R)-(–)-linalool (right) Linalool has a stereogenic center at C3 and therefore there are two stereoisomers: (R)-(–)-linalool is also known as licareol and (S)-(+)-linalool is also known as coriandrol. Both enantiomeric forms are found in nature: (S)-linalool is found, for example, as a major constituent of the essential oils of coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.), cymbopogon (Cymbopogon martini var. martinii), and sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) flowers. (R)-linalool is present in lavender (Lavandula officinalis), bay laurel (Laurus nobilis), and sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum), among others. Each enantiomer evokes different neural responses in humans, so are classified as possessing distinct scents. (S)-(+)-Linalool is perceived as sweet, floral, petitgrain-like (odor threshold 7.4 ppb) and the (R)-form as more woody and lavender-like (odor threshold 0.8 ppb). Biosynthesis In higher plants, linalool, is an acyclic monoterpenoid. Like the majority of monoterpenes, it starts at the condensation of dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) and isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) to form geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP). With the aid of linalool synthase (LIS), water attacks to form the chiral center.LIS appears to show a limonene synthase-type catalysis through a simplified \\"metal-cofactor-binding domain [where the majority] of the residues involved in substrate...binding [are] in the C-terminal part of the protein\\" suggesting stereoselectivity and the reasoning behind why some plants have varying levels of each enantiomer. Linalool 654x654px Uses Linalool is used as a scent in 60% to 80% of perfumed hygiene products and cleaning agents including soaps, detergents, shampoos, and lotions. It is also used as a chemical intermediate. One common downstream product of linalool is vitamin E. In addition, linalool is used by pest professionals as a flea, fruit fly, and cockroach insecticide. It can also be used as a method of pest control for codling moths. Linalool creates a synergistic effect with the codling moth's pheromone called codlemone, which increases attraction of males. Linalool is used in some mosquito-repellent products; however, the EPA notes that \\"a preliminary screen of labels for products containing [l]inalool (as the sole active ingredient) indicates that efficacy data on file with the Agency may not support certain claims to repel mosquitos.\\" Plants that contain linalool * Lavandula * Cinnamomum tamala * Cannabis Sativa * Basil * Solidago * Artemisia vulgaris (mugwort) * Humulus lupulus Safety and potential toxicity Linalool can be absorbed by inhalation of its aerosol and by oral intake or skin absorption, potentially causing irritation, pain and allergic reactions. Some 7% of people undergoing patch testing in Europe were found to be allergic to the oxidized form of linalool.

The line of toys was created by David Gonzales and based on a comic strip that Gonzales created featuring a cast of characters from his youth. Introduced in the year 1998, Homies were initially sold in grocery store vending machines and have become a highly collectible item, and have spawned many imitation toys.  Background  Gonzales began drawing comics while he was in high school. His amateur comic strip was called The Adventures of Chico Loco, and the characters were based on \\"barrio guys,\\" as Gonzales grew up on the tough streets of a poverty-ridden Mexican-American neighborhood.Bir, Sara. \\"Where the Heart Is: With Homies, gangsta is in the eye of the beholder,\\" Metroactive (Apr. 10, 2003). The main character, based on Gonzales himself, was called \\"Hollywood.\\" The strip, which later changed its title to The Adventures of Hollywood, was picked up by Lowrider magazine and published monthly. More and more barrio characters from Gonzales' experiences were introduced to the public through the Hollywood strip — these became \\"Homies.\\" (The word \\"homie\\" [from \\"homeboy\\"] is an African-American slang from the southern United States, meaning someone from \\"back home\\". In use in the West Coast Latino community for decades, the word \\"homie\\" has crossed over into the mainstream culture.) Gonzales began drawing his humorous characters on T-shirts and other products, which he and his wife sold on local beach stands, swap meets, liquor stores, and eventually urban clothing stores.Mendoza, Beto. \\"David Gonzales Art - Creator of the Homies: Lowrider Draw the Line,\\" Lowrider (June 18, 2013).Fischer, Zane. \\"Homie Sweet Homie: Sexy urban icons have New Mexico roots,\\" Santa Fe Reporter (February 4, 2009). In 1998, Gonzales released the first set of Homies figurines, initially sold in supermarket vending machines located in Chicano communities. The first series featured the male characters Eight Ball, Smiley, Big Loco, Droopy, Sapo, and Mr. Raza. The toys were widely popular, with the first series selling a million Homies figures in four months. The figures caused controversy after their initial release as members of the Los Angeles Police Department argued that the \\"urban, inner-city Latino\\" figures glorified gang life. Law enforcement entities pressured retailers to stop selling Homies; as a result, many mainstream stores, such as Walmart and Safeway Inc., stopped selling the toys. In response, Gonzales repeatedly explained that he “did not create Homies to glamorize gang life”. He created stories for each of the characters on the Homies website, with each one embodying a positive trait. Stores quickly returned the Homies to their shelves; the resulting media coverage of the controversy helped Homies gain ever more popularity. According to Gonzales, he has received orders from countries in Europe, South America, and Africa requesting Homies characters representing people from those continents. By 2005, the Homies line featured female characters, as well as characters with Puerto Rican, Filipino, and Japanese backgrounds. There have been 12 series of Homies, with more than 200 characters.  Description  In their fictional world, the Homies are a group of tightly knit Chicano buddies who grew up in the Mexican-American barrio of \\"Quien Sabe\\" (\\"Who knows?\\") located in East Los Angeles. In an inner-city world plagued by poverty, violence, and drugs, the Homies form a strong and binding cultural support system that enables them to overcome the surrounding negativity, allowing for laughter and good times as an antidote to reality. As befitting these characters from the barrio, many Homies wear bandanas and baggy pants. The four main Homies are Hollywood (based on creator Gonzales), Smiley, Pelon, and Bobby Loco. = Characters = Gonzales has created a background for each Homie to have their own story. He made sure that the Homies were authentic because they were based on Latinos in his community. The following is a list of some of the more notable Homies characters: * First series: ** Eight Ball — Known for his distinctive low-slung beanie and big smile, he is named for the numbers painted on his shoes ** Smiley — based on a childhood friend of creator David Gonzales, Smiley is a mechanic who works at \\"Homies Hydraulics,\\" and is perpetually broke and borrowing money off the other Homies ** Big Loco — youth gang counselor and arbitrator ** Droopy — slightly stoned background character ** Sapo — huge consumer of Mexican food; unpopular with womenAlonso, Alex. \\"Homies Figures – The Original Homies,\\" Streetgangs.com (May 12, 2000). ** Mr. Raza — highly educated, with degrees in Chicano Studies and Latin American and Pre-Columbian History * Subsequent series: ** Hollywood — based on creator David Gonzales, Hollywood is known by his zoot suit and 1970s disco hairstyle ** La Gata (\\"The Cat\\") — Hollywood's girlfriend, she is loosely based on creator David Gonzales' wife ** Pelon — based on a childhood friend of creator David Gonzales, Pelon (\\"bald\\" in Spanish) is named for his bald head. A small-time hustler, Pelon sells stolen merchandise from the back of his 1941 Chevy panel sedan. Smiley's best friend, Pelon is the most stereotypically cholo of the Homies. ** Bobby Loco — based on a childhood friend of creator David Gonzales, he is a bouncer at the \\"Homie Hot Spot\\" ** Chuco — short for \\"Pachuco,\\" a lowriding, zoot suit-wearing Chicano from the 1940s and 50s ** Joker — true to his name, an inveterate clown and jokester ** El Paletero — ice cream vendor who works to bring his grandchildren from Mexico ** Officer Placa — chubby police officer who knows all the Homies by name ** El Padrecito (\\"the little father\\") — Franciscan priest in sunglasses, based on creator David Gonzales' brother Robert (who is a priest) ** El Profe — a Master's degree-qualified high school teacher who stays in the barrio to helpNapolitano, Jo. \\"Two-Inch Latino Role Models, for Good or Ill,\\" New York Times (May 1, 2003). ** Shady — mother who works as a stripper to support her son ** Willie G — ex-gangster who works as a counsellor, trying to turn children away from crime. Paralyzed form the waist down as the result of gang violence. ** Whisper — half-Spanish and half-Sicilian, she is related to The Palermos  Cultural impact  The LAPD's complaints about the Homies figures were based on the characters' appearances. Since gang members are usually depicted in similar clothes as those of the Homies, the police felt the toys promoted gang life. In fact, the Homies figures so closely matched gang members' attire that an L.A. county district deputy attorney was inclined to use the Homies toys as an example of what not to wear. He suggested that people who were dressed in such a manner would be considered as violating probation. Similarly, Latino advocacy groups such as the Imagen Foundation objected to the Homies portrayal of Chicanos as \\"gang members, undocumented, or drug dealers.\\" Other groups felt the Homies perpetuated gross stereotypes about Chicanos. On the other hand, the Homies toy line has been shown to help Latin American adolescents with their cultural identity and self-esteem. As the toy line has expanded, the various characters carry a much greater range of lifestyle choices and possibilities. Another positive way the Homies toys have influenced society is via Gonzales’s brother, Robert, who after a life of crime and violence, became a priest. Himself confined to a wheelchair, Robert suggested that Gonzales create a Homie in a wheelchair. Willie G, as the character was named, has since become one of the more popular Homies, even being promoted by the Special Olympics. The Homie character Padrecito (\\"priest\\") resembles Robert, and has been used to connect with and help those looking for a route out of the ghetto. Through “El Padrecito’s Online Church,” Homies have made it easier for society to connect with those looking to improve their lives; on the website people can create religious figurines, such as saints. In 2007, the Pasadena Museum of California Art produced an exhibition called “Beyond Ultraman: Seven Artists Explore the Vinyl Frontier,\\" which featured the Homies characters.Piasecki, Joe. \\"The New Americana: David Gonzales and his Homies pay a visit to the Pasadena Museum of California Art,\\" Pasadena Weekly (Jan. 3, 2008). Since they're roughly 1/32 in scale, and are cheaper and more readily available than the figures purpose-manufactured for the hobby, Homies and Gonzales' other figures are sometimes used in the scenery of slot car layouts.  Spin-offs and ancillary products  Homies characters have been featured on school folders, lunchboxes, breath mints, and beach towels. Homies have also been seen on posters, stickers, and clothing, and in YouTube videos. With their rising popularity, the Homies line branched out to include die-cast cars, among other things. In 2004, Gonzales created Mijos, a line of figurines portrayed as Latino kids, babies, and teens intended for a younger customer base.Castleman, Lana. \\"Licensors heat up Hispanic merch programs to feed retailer demand,\\" Kidscreen (March 1, 2004).

In 2007, LATV produced a stop-motion animated show about the figures called The Homies Hip Hop Show.

It is the 15th episode of the third season, first airing in syndication in the week of February 19, 1990. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, the ship's crew must decide whether to send the time-traveling Enterprise-C back through a temporal rift to its certain destruction, to prevent damaging changes to their timeline. The plot for \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\" was based on the merging of two story ideas—one featured the crew of the time-traveling Enterprise-C and the other the return of Denise Crosby, whose character had been killed in the series' first season. Trent Christopher Ganino and Eric A. Stillwell rewrote the merged story to feature the character of Guinan more prominently. To complete the episode in time for sweeps, the final script was finished by a team of five writers. Filming of the episode lasted a week, with some elements of the script ultimately not included due to time constraints. In syndication, \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\" outperformed most of the third season's episodes with a 13.1 Nielsen rating, the third-highest number for the series at the time. The episode is cited as a favorite by crew members and reviewers, and is widely regarded as one of the best episodes of the series. Plot The starship encounters a rift in spacetime while on a routine mission. As they monitor the anomaly, the heavily damaged USS Enterprise-C, a ship believed to have been destroyed more than two decades earlier, emerges. Instantly, the Enterprise-D undergoes a sudden and radical change from its current timeline: it is now a warship, and the United Federation of Planets is at war with the Klingons. Neither Worf nor Counselor Troi are seen or referred to, and Tasha Yar – who was killed years before – is now running the tactical station. None of the crew notice the change, but Guinan senses that reality has shifted, and has a meeting with Captain Picard to discuss her concerns. She senses that there are supposed to be children on the ship, which of course is completely impractical on a warship. She suggests that the Enterprise-C does not belong in their time and must return to the past. Picard, who knows that this would be a suicide mission, refuses to give such an order based on Guinan's intuition alone. Captain Rachel Garrett of the Enterprise-C and her crew learn they have traveled into the future. Garrett explains that they were responding to a distress call from the Klingon outpost on Narendra III, and were attacked by Romulan starships. While his crew works to repair the Enterprise-C and tend to the crew's injuries, Picard and his command staff discuss whether or not the ship should return to the past. Commander Riker argues that their deaths would be meaningless, but Data suggests that it would be considered an honorable act by the Klingons. Picard discusses the situation with Garrett, who tells him that her crew will serve the Federation in the present. Picard quietly reveals to her that the Federation is on the verge of defeat and the presence of one ship will make no difference, but if the Enterprise-C were to return to the past they might prevent the war from ever starting. Garrett agrees and announces to her crew that they will return through the anomaly; at that moment, the two ships are ambushed by a Klingon Bird of Prey. Garrett is killed, and her helmsman, Richard Castillo, takes command. During the repair efforts, Yar becomes close to Castillo, but is unnerved by tense interactions with Guinan. Guinan reveals to Yar that she knows Yar dies a meaningless death in the other timeline, and that the two should never have met. Based on her discussion with Guinan, Yar requests a transfer to the Enterprise-C, which is granted by Picard. As the Enterprise-C prepares to return through the anomaly, three Klingon battlecruisers attack. With the anomaly becoming unstable, Picard orders the Enterprise-D to cover the Enterprise-C's withdrawal. The Enterprise-D suffers massive systems damage and major crew losses under the Klingon barrage, including the death of Commander Riker, forcing Picard to man the tactical station himself. With the Enterprise-D on the brink of destruction, the Enterprise-C traverses the anomaly, triggering the return of Enterprise-D's original timeline. In the restored timeline, Guinan – the only one subtly aware of what has transpired – asks Geordi La Forge to tell her more about Yar. Production =Development= At the beginning of Star Trek: The Next Generation third season, Michael Piller became the head writer for the series. Among the changes he implemented was the opening of the story submission process to non- professional and unrepresented writers. Despite Paramount Television's resistance to the change, The Next Generation became the first show produced in Hollywood to allow such writers to submit their scripts. The studio received more than 5,000 scripts in a year. Among the scripts submitted by freelance or aspiring writers was one by Trent Christopher Ganino. Ganino's speculative script, submitted to the office of pre-production associate Eric A. Stillwell in April 1989, was titled \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\". The story involved the Enterprise-D's response to a crisis in the Golecian sector and an encounter with Enterprise-C, which had been destroyed 18 years earlier. The crew of the Enterprise-C is in awe of the newer ship's technology, and Picard is confronted with whether to reveal to his guests their ultimate fate. An Enterprise-C ensign accidentally discovers the fate of his vessel and panics, requiring Worf and Riker to capture him after he attempts to escape. When Golecian warships attack, Picard defends the Enterprise-C using the same maneuver that caused the vessel's destruction in the past. The ensign goes back to his ship, which returns to the past and its certain destruction. Due to the backlog of scripts, the processing of draft submissions could take anywhere from weeks to a year. Ganino's script was \\"logged\\" on May 2 and first read later that month by Richard Manning, a co-producer on the writing staff. Manning commented that the draft was \\"not horrible, not particularly original, but good in spots, lousy in others\\". This review was enough to keep the script in circulation. Executive story editor Melinda Snodgrass read Ganino's speculative script for \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\" in June and attached a post-it note declaring the story an \\"interesting idea\\". A \\"coverage\\" of the script, which outlined the plot and provided creative feedback, was written in August. This analysis called the script a \\"good effort by an unrepresented writer\\", and considered the script's weak characterization and plot issues correctable. The main issue was whether the producers wanted to do a show with time travel. alt=A woman with short blonde hair looks to one side. Meanwhile, Ganino and Stillwell struck up a friendship and began to develop ideas for other episodes. Gene Roddenberry had distributed a memo that said the return of Leonard Nimoy as Spock would be unlikely due to financial considerations, and suggested that a reasonable alternative would be to feature Mark Lenard, who played Spock's father Sarek. During the same period, Stillwell met Denise Crosby – who played Tasha Yar in the series' first season – at a 1989 fan convention in San Jose. Over dinner, Crosby admitted she missed being part of the series and suggested that Stillwell write a script to bring back her character, who was killed off in the episode \\"Skin of Evil\\". Ganino and Stillwell began to work on script ideas that would involve both Yar and Sarek. Ganino and Stillwell were particular fans of two episodes from the original Star Trek series, \\"Mirror, Mirror\\" and \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\", and wanted to combine elements from them for a Next Generation episode. They came up with a story involving a team of Vulcans investigating the Guardian of Forever. In the past, the founder of modern Vulcan logic, Surak, is killed, causing massive changes to the timeline. The Romulans and Vulcans joined forces to attack the Federation, Worf is no longer a crewmember on the Enterprise, and Tasha Yar remains alive. Sarek and the Vulcans by the Guardian are the only people not affected by the timeline change and, in the end, Sarek returns to the past to take Surak's place, restoring the timeline. After Ganino and Stilwell pitched him the new script, Piller suggested to producer Rick Berman that the story, not the script, be purchased. In a meeting, Piller told Ganino that he wanted to make changes to the story, which included the addition of Tasha Yar. Fearing that what they considered a better story would be lost if the changes were made to \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\", Stillwell talked to Piller and pitched their Guardian of Forever story. While intrigued by elements of the story, Piller felt the use of the Guardian was a \\"gimmick\\" and wanted The Next Generation to stand on its own. Instead, Piller suggested that they merge the two stories, with Stillwell and Ganino sharing writing credit. Piller suggested that the Enterprise crew would immediately undergo a transformation due to the presence of the older Enterprise, and that Guinan would be integral to the realization that something was wrong. Ganino and Stillwell were given two weeks to complete their new story. =Writing= Ganino and Stillwell completed their new combined story in about a week. The writers spent hours each day at Stillwell's apartment working over every detail; they felt pressured to write a story Piller would find acceptable, as they wanted to have the opportunity to write the teleplay. The story treatment was turned in on October 10. Piller immediately decided to purchase the story and distributed the treatment to the writing staff while he discussed changes. Piller felt that Data's romantic feelings for Tasha Yar were over the top, and that an alien probe which served as a central part of the story was a cheat in terms of resolving Picard's dilemma. The writer wanted Ganino and Stillwell to enhance Guinan's role and to find another character arc for Tasha Yar. A revised treatment was submitted on October 29, incorporating Piller's changes. The writers were not involved in development of the teleplay. They were each paid the Writers Guild minimum of $2400. The production of the episode, originally scheduled for January 1990, was moved to December 1989 to accommodate the filming availability of Crosby and Whoopi Goldberg, who played Guinan. The task of writing and polishing the new treatment in half the time fell upon writer Ronald D. Moore, who submitted his first draft on November 9. Moore's script removed the alien probe and made the alternate universe militaristic, with the Federation and the Klingons at war. Some characters, such as Troi, appeared only briefly at the beginning of the episode to allow more screen time for the guest characters. The beat sheet for the episode, which detailed characters and scenes, was distributed on November 27. Due to time constraints, a team of writers was assigned to write the teleplay. In addition to the story credit to Ganino and Stillwell, Moore, Ira Steven Behr, Hans Beimler and Richard Manning would work on the teleplay, and Piller would provide the finishing touches. Because the Writers Guild would not allow more than three staff writers to appear in the credits (four after a special waiver was granted), Piller agreed to not feature his name in the credits. A partial first draft was submitted on November 30 so that preproduction for the episode could commence. The altered timeline provided a chance to show the Enterprise crew in a much more dramatic and human light than would be allowable in a normal episode. Behr explained that since the original timeline was to be restored, the writers had the freedom to include more action. \\"Even though it was an alternate universe, [Moore] and I got all excited because we realized we were going to kill everyone on screen\\", he said. Michael Okuda and Rick Sternbach submitted technical memos regarding the type of anomaly that might drag the Enterprise-C through time, and suggested interstellar, super-dense strings as a possibility. The first draft teleplay was completed by December 4, and a preproduction meeting was held the same day. Given the scale of the story, various departments argued over costs and what items could be cut to reduce the budget. The final draft was finished and submitted on December 8. =Design= The studio decided to increase the episode's budget, which at that time was estimated by Daily Variety as $1.2 million per episode. This gave the production departments more leeway. One reason for the increase was that \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\" would air during February sweeps, an important time for the studio to attract solid ratings. As The Next Generation was syndicated directly by the studio, the episode's performance would affect advertising revenue for the future. temporal rift; the ship was designed to be the logical link between the Excelsior- and Galaxy-class starship design.alt=An oblong, blue-grey starship with an oval hull and two flanking, glowing engines The script called for the creation of the Enterprise-C. In the first season, illustrator Andrew Probert – who had designed the Enterprise-D – was interested in a display of the design lineage of the ship from James T. Kirk's Enterprise to The Next Generations much larger ship, which was realized as a wall relief in the conference lounge behind the command bridge. Like most others, Probert assumed that the Enterprise-B was an Excelsior-class vessel and reasoned that the C would share design elements with its Excelsior-class predecessor and its Galaxy-class successor, Picard's ship. During this lineage project, Probert also produced a small color sketch of his version of Enterprise-C, but he left at the end of the season and his absence meant that no one knew what the drawing was intended to be. When Rick Sternbach took over Probert's duties, he believed the sketch was a rejected concept for the Enterprise-D, but the ship's design stayed with him. When he learned about the ship requirement for \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\", he followed a thought process similar to Probert and built off the old sketch. Probert's version had a highly curved engineering hull reminiscent of a sailing ship, but Sternbach was worried that a design with so many compound curves would prove difficult to fabricate in the available time, so he made the hull entirely circular. A set of orthographic views was created and sent to Greg Jein, who fabricated the shooting model, which cost more than $10,000 to produce. The model was modified to appear as various Ambassador-class starships in later Next Generation episodes, with its saucer and nacelles spaced apart to create a larger ship. The production crew took several steps to differentiate the alternate universe from the original one. In addition to the absence of a counselor, a \\"military log\\" was substituted for a captain's log and a \\"combat date\\" was used rather than stardate. The expanded budget allowed the bridge to be entirely redressed, something that would normally be infeasible. Steps replaced ramps on the bridge, and the captain's chair was elevated and made more throne-like. Longer, spartan tables were also substituted for the usual decor in the Ten-Forward lounge. While enlisted crew aboard the darker Enterprise wore variations of the Season 1–2 uniforms, the senior officers wore slightly modified versions of the uniforms introduced in Season 3. The Enterprise-C officers wore costumes from earlier Star Trek feature films due to the expense and time-consuming nature of creating more than a half-dozen or so new uniforms for the episode. Costume designer Robert Blackman's solution to change their appearance was to remove the turtleneck collars underneath the red tunics, as well as the belts, although the rear belt loop remained. =Filming and casting= Filming began on Monday, December 11, 1989, and lasted for seven days. The episode was directed by David Carson, who had only filmed one other Next Generation episode before \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\". Carson felt that his relative lack of experience helped because he had no preconceptions about how episodes should be directed. Since much of the episode took place in the darker alternate universe, Carson wanted to emphasize the toll that decades of war had taken on the crew and the bridge. \\"Picard really looked tired and worn and like a battle-weary commander, and that's what we wanted the bridge to look like—a battle weary bridge. I had lots of thoughts about making it as strong as possible using a lot of low lights, a lot of dark blues, making it very much more moody\\", he said. To heighten the impact of the physical set changes, Carson took a different approach to how he constructed shots. \\"It was my intention to make it as much like a submarine as possible and to use low-angle lighting; basically, to do everything the opposite way that the Enterprise was normally shot.\\" The cameras were equipped with longer lenses than usual in order to reduce the depth of the scenes and provide a grittier feel. The use of low angles forced the lighting to be modified to prevent the scene from, in Carson's words, looking \\"like a hotel lobby\\". Two new roles – Garrett and Castillo – needed to be filled for the production. The actors selected were both Star Trek fans. Christopher McDonald was picked for Castillo. \\"What impressed me about [McDonald]\\", Carson remembers, \\"was that he wasn't just your romantic leading man; he was actually a very impressive actor.\\" Tricia O'Neil was cast for similar reasons; the actress was not the normal Star Trek commander type. Carson was also pleased to work with Crosby and Goldberg. The main cast enjoyed the opportunity to play their characters differently. The unusual degree of friction between characters provoked some concern with the producers. Berman, for example, was afraid that the episode was pushing the alternate timeline too far. Ganino and Stillwell visited the set frequently during filming. Members of the main cast approached Stillwell with questions about the nature of the altered universe, trying to determine if they were still playing the same characters. Goldberg asked Ganino about changing a piece of dialogue on set, but since Ganino was not the author of the teleplay, he deferred to Stillwell, who in turn notified the production office. When Berman found out that Ganino and Stillwell were on set and talking to the actors, he banned them from setting foot on the sets again. Many planned elements were never filmed, due to production time constraints. Moore had hoped for an extended battle scene in which Data would be electrocuted, and Wesley Crusher blown up in an explosion. Production of the episode ended on December 19. Release and reception =Broadcast= \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\" was first broadcast the week of February 19, 1990. Because The Next Generation aired in syndication, \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\" did not air on a specific day or time slot. The episode received a 13.1 Nielsen rating for the time period from February 19 to March 4 – the third highest rating for the series, and the highest for the entire season. While the season had averaged 9,817,000 households, \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\" was viewed by 12,070,000 households. =Critical reception= The episode has been well received by reviewers. In a retrospective review, Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club praised the episode for quickly establishing the premise and stakes, as well as turning Tasha Yar's death into one of the episode's \\"strongest emotional beats ... Tasha's determination to die with meaning by the end of [the episode] transforms her from a misstep into something more noble and sad.\\" In contrast, Tor Books' Keith DeCandido wrote that while the guest stars were excellent, Tasha Yar's return for a \\"TV death\\" is the episode's major flaw: \\"It is, in short, a scripted death, and you can see the marionette strings\\", he wrote. Film critic Jordan Hoffman wrote that the episode is \\"heavy, Philip K. Dick- ian stuff that actually takes some thought to follow and ... all victories come at a cost\\", and that it is a fan favorite episode for good reason. Likewise, Den of Geek reviewer James Hunt praised the episode for finding the human stakes in the story, elevating it above standard science fiction time travel stories. Critic Marc Bernardin described the episode as Star Treks \\"smartest time-travel experiment\\" and a fan favorite. Time Magazine rated \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\" as one of the top ten moments of Star Trek, including television series and films up to that time. They note the work of multiple writers on this episode, which they remark \\"polished the episode into a taut, unpredictable thriller with an exhilarating complement of phasers and photon torpedoes.\\" The Toronto Star listed The Next Generations time-shifting episodes, including \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\", as one of the twenty best elements of the show, with Comic Book Resources ranking the episode the second-best time-travel episode in all of Star Trek. Fans attending the Star Trek 50th Anniversary convention in 2015 voted \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\" the fifth-best episode of the franchise. The episode ranked as one of The Next Generations top episodes in lists by Entertainment Weekly, The Hollywood Reporter, and Nerdist, and as one of the best episodes of all of Star Trek by Empire, IGN, and TV Guide. The episode is a favorite and influence to John Logan and Roberto Orci, writers for the film Star Trek: Nemesis (2002) and the reboot Star Trek (2009), respectively. =Home media release= The first home media release of \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\" was on VHS cassette, appearing on July 11, 1995, in the United States and Canada. \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\" was also included as one of four episodes (along with \\"The Best of Both Worlds, Parts I and II\\" and \\"The Measure of a Man\\") in a DVD collection entitled \\"The Best of Star Trek: The Next Generation\\". The episode was later included on the Star Trek: The Next Generation season three DVD box set, released in the United States on September 3, 2002. The first Blu-ray release was in the United States on April 30, 2013.

The park draws its name from Spicers Gap, located near . History The Spicers Gap Road is the original route that links the Darling Downs with Brisbane. It was used by Cobb and Co Coaches and was later replaced by the Cunninghams Gap Road named after explorer Allan Cunningham who established the route. The road was constructed by convicts during the 19th century and was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register in 1999. Until the late 1990s, Spicers Gap Road was a popular diversion from the Cunningham Highway for adventurous off-roaders. It was at times a challenging and rough route, usable only by 4WDs and made more difficult by the muddy clay soil that is common to the region. As a result of this increasing popularity, and the carelessness of some users, of the road was closed to vehicles by Queensland National Parks and gazetted as a conservation park. This is the section at the crest of the gap and was done in order to preserve some of the road's unique 19th century engineering features.

It took place May 29–31, 1920, near the Ukrainian village of Volodarka, in the course of the Polish Offensive on Kiev during the Polish-Soviet War. Before the battle After the Polish Army captured Kiev on May 7, 1920, it became apparent that Józef Piłsudski's plan to fight a major battle against the Soviet armies in Ukraine had failed. The Soviets avoided battle, withdrew from all of right-bank Ukraine, and also gave up its capital. At the same time, Red Army headquarters ordered Siemion Budionnyi's battle-proven 1st Cavalry Army to relocate to Ukraine, begin an offensive, and outflank the overstretched Polish forces and Symon Petlura's small contingent of Ukrainian People's Republic troops. The Soviet advance finally began on May 26, 1920, with the Red 12th Army and Komdiv Iona Yakir's Corps crossing the Dnieper River and attacking the weakest part of the Polish defenses. The assault began the same day as the reorganization of the Polish forces in the area, and was initially aimed at the Polish 7th Infantry Division, the weakest and least battle-proven Polish unit. In addition, the Polish defenses were weakened by the relocation of a large part of the Polish forces to northern Polesie, where Piłsudski was preparing defenses against possible Russian attack. The following day, Budionnyi's 1st Cavalry Army joined the assault and attacked the Polish 6th Army's 13th Infantry Division. The Soviets planned to outflank the Poles and Ukrainians by forming two giant pincers advancing separately toward Bila Tserkva and Khvastiv. However, apart from the fresh and battle-proven units of the First Cavalry Army, the Russian commander of the Southwestern Front, Komandarm Alexander Ilyich Yegorov, had only the 12th Red Army, reinforced with fresh, untrained recruits, which had been badly beaten during the Soviet retreat from Ukraine only a month earlier. Due to this, the planned offensive could not begin on all fronts at once, and the mobility of the troops was limited. On May 29, 1920, the commander of the Polish 3rd Army ordered a counterattack. Lt. Col. Stefan Dąb-Biernacki's newly formed Wasilków Group was to attack the Yakir Group before it could attack the weakened 7th Division. The assault was successful, and the group — comprising a single (5th Legions) infantry regiment, reinforced with one battalion of the elite 1st Legions Infantry Regiment, two artillery groups, and two cavalry squadrons — was able to take the Soviets by surprise. After the first assault, the Bolshevik 44th Rifle Division had lost one of its brigades and its entire staff, which delayed the Soviet assault on the Polish northern flank, thus securing it. However, at the same time the southern flank, between the Polish 3rd and 6th Armies, was threatened by the First Cavalry Army, which had crossed the Dnieper River and was concentrating near Uman. From there, it easily broke the thin line of Polish defenses and began a fast advance toward the strategically important railway node of Koziatyn. The battle On May 29, 1920, the Soviet 1st Cavalry Army's 4th Cavalry Division attacked Polish positions at the villages of Volodarka, Berezno and Novokhvastiv. The area was defended by the Polish 44th Kresy Rifle Regiment, 16th Greater Poland Uhlan Regiment, elements of the 1st Krechowce Uhlan Regiment, and the 7th Mounted Artillery Group. The Polish defenders formed strong pockets of resistance in the villages — a tactic that had shown itself to be superior to an attempted defense of an entire frontline. Due to this, the Soviet forces could not fully exploit their numerical advantage. In addition, poor command procedures caused the Soviet cavalry regiments to begin their attacks on the Polish positions in piecemeal fashion. Moreover, instead of simply bypassing the Polish positions, the Russian commander decided to attack them frontally. After the initial Cossack cavalry assault was repelled with heavy-machine-gun fire, the Polish cavalry counter-charged the Cossacks, and an intense hand-to-hand cavalry battle with sabres ensued. Both sides suffered major casualties. For example, the Polish 1st Krechowce Uhlan Regiment's third squadron lost 30 of 72 men and a similar number of horses. The Polish charge succeeded. When further reinforcements arrived and joined in, the Cossacks fled the field. After the Battle The following day, the 3rd Don Cossack Cavalry Brigade, comprising Cossacks who had formerly served in Gen. Anton Denikin's White Russian army and then been forcibly drafted into the Red Army, approached Polish positions and, after brief negotiations, switched sides to fight on the Polish side against the Bolsheviks, under the name of Free Cossack Brigade. Colonel Vadim Yakovlev would remain the brigade's commander until it was disbanded in 1923. Due to the Polish forces' strong resistance and high mobility, the 1st Cavalry Army's assault was repelled. Only the 6th Cavalry Division managed to break through the lines of the Polish 13th Infantry Division, but was repulsed the following day (May 31, 1920) and, after three days of heavy fighting, forced to retreat to its initial positions near Human.

She was the first African-American woman to practice law in Pennsylvania, following in her father's footsteps. She was the first national president of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, serving from 1919 to 1923. In 1946 she was appointed to the President's Committee on Civil Rights established by Harry Truman. She was the first African-American woman appointed as Assistant City Solicitor for the City of Philadelphia. She and her husband were both active in civil rights. In 1952 she was appointed to the city's Commission on Human Relations, serving through 1968. She was President of John F. Kennedy Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law (1963). In 1979, Jimmy Carter appointed her as chair of the White House Conference on Aging (WHCoA). She served on the board of the National Urban League for 25 years. Biography Sadie Tanner Mossell 1918 Sadie Tanner Mossell was born on January 2, 1898 in Philadelphia to Aaron Albert Mossell II and Mary Louisa Tanner (born 1867). Mossell attended high school in Washington, D.C., at the M Street School, now known as Dunbar High School, graduating in 1915. Mossell returned to Philadelphia to study at the School of Education at the University of Pennsylvania, graduating in 1918. She pursued graduate work in economics, also at Penn, earning her master's in 1919. Awarded the Francis Sergeant Pepper fellowship, she was able to continue her studies and in 1921 became the second African-American woman in the United States to earn a Ph.D. Finding it difficult to get professorship work in Philadelphia as an African-American even with her doctorate, Mossell decided to take an actuarial job with the black-owned North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company in Durham, North Carolina and worked there for two years. In 1923, Mosell married Raymond Pace Alexander shortly after he passed the Bar, then returned with him to Philadelphia. Mossell received job offers from several Black colleges and universities, but none of them were located in Philadelphia, and she had no desire to leave her new family. So she stayed home for a year, did volunteer work, and eventually entered law school. She was the first African-American woman admitted to the University of Pennsylvania Law School. In 1927, she was its first African-American woman graduate, and the first to be admitted to the Pennsylvania Bar. Mossell Alexander practiced law from 1927 until her retirement in 1982. Upon admission to the Bar, she joined her husband's law practice as partner, specializing in estate and family law. They both were active in civil rights law as well. In 1928 she was the first African-American woman appointed as Assistant City Solicitor for the City of Philadelphia, serving to 1930. She was reappointed from 1934–1938. From 1943–1947 she was the first woman to serve as secretary of the National Bar Association. She was appointed to the Commission on Human Relations of the City of Philadelphia, serving from 1952–1968. In 1959, when her husband was appointed to the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia, she opened her own law office. She continued to practice law independently until her husband's death in 1974. In 1976, she joined the firm of Atkinson, Myers, and Archie as a general counsel, where she remained until her retirement. Mossell Alexander died on November 1, 1989 at Cathedral Village in Andorra, Philadelphia, from pneumonia as a complication from Alzheimer's disease. She was buried in West Laurel Hill Cemetery. Family Sadie Alexander c. 1982 Her maternal grandfather was Benjamin Tucker Tanner (1835–1923), a bishop in the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME) and editor of the Christian Recorder. Bishop Tanner and his wife had seven children, including Henry Ossawa Tanner (1859–1937), who became a noted painter, and Hallie Tanner Johnson, the first female physician to practice medicine in Alabama and who established the Nurses' School and Hospital at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. Her father, Aaron Albert Mossell II (1863-1951), was the first African-American graduate of the University of Pennsylvania School of Law and practiced as a lawyer in Philadelphia. In 1899, when his daughter Sadie was 1 year old, he abandoned his family and moved to Wales. Her uncle, Nathan Francis Mossell (1856–1946) was the first African- American graduate of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. Mossell Alexander's siblings include Aaron Albert Mossell III (1893–1975), who became a pharmacist; and Elizabeth Mossell (1894–1975), who became a Dean of Women at Virginia State College, a historically black college. During her high school years, Mossell lived in Washington, DC with her uncle, Lewis Baxter Moore, who was dean at Howard University. On November 29, 1923, Sadie Tanner Mossell married Raymond Pace Alexander (1897–1974) in her parents' home on Diamond Street in North Philadelphia, with the ceremony performed by her father. Alexander, the son of slaves, grew up in Philadelphia. He attended and graduated from Central High School (1917, valedictorian), Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania (1920), and Harvard Law School (1923). At the time of this marriage, he had established a law practice in Philadelphia. Sadie and Raymond had four premature children, with only the last two surviving. They were able to raise two daughters: Mary Elizabeth Alexander (born 1934), who married Melvin Brown; and Rae Pace Alexander (born 1937), who earned a PhD. and married Archie C. Epps III. After her divorce with Epps, in 1971 Rae Pace Alexander married Thomas Minter, and they had two sons together.  Views  US household income by race: 1967 to 2011, in 2011 dollars. According to Nina Banks,Nina Banks, The Black Worker, Economic Justice and the Speeches of Sadie T.M. Alexander. Review of Social Economy, Vol. LXVI, No. 2, June 2008 p 139-161 available as of November 1, 2018 at https://www.jstor.org/stable/29770460 Alexander's opposition to racial oppression was within a tradition of 19th century scholars Frederick Douglass and T. Thomas Fortune, and with later scholars W.E.B. DuBois and A. Philip Randolph. Alexander's focus was frequently on racial and economic justice for the working class, especially for working men and women. However, unlike Dubois or Randolph, Alexander never embraced socialism. Alexander also can be contrasted with Howard University radicals Ralph Bunche, E. Franklin Frazier, and fellow black economist Abram Harris. For example, Harris wrote that the fundamental problems facing blacks could be overcome through multi-racial labor organizing and did not support direct action for civil rights until blacks had achieved economic power. Alexander, on the other hand, was outspoken against white dominance in political, social, and economic spheres. Alexander's work and views are recorded in speeches kept in the University of Pennsylvania archives. Among her earliest works are from the 1920s and discuss black workers in the US economy. In 1930, Alexander published an article, \\"Negro Women in Our Economic Life\\", which was published in Urban League's Opportunity magazine advocating black women's employment, particularly in industrial jobs. Alexander generally supported the Republican Party, suspicious of the control of conservative southern whites over the Democratic Party, although she also criticized Republican political appointments, as well as what she saw as uneven benefits of the New Deal which did not do enough to help blacks who were most hurt by the great depression. During World War II, Alexander saw similarities in a rise in racial violence and discrimination in the US as paralleling the treatment of Jews in Germany. Near the end of the war, she supported integrating labor unions to increase their bargaining power once the war economy slowed and industrial employment moved toward pre-war levels. Her interest in labor economic issues extended to advocating of government regulation to smooth fluctuations in the business cycle, modification of tariffs, regulation of public utilities, and regulation of securities and securities markets. After the war she was appointed to Truman's Presidential Committee on Human Rights and shifted her focus to civil and human rights. Evidence in the archives suggests that her focus was in this direction for over a decade. In 1963 she gave a speech to the Annual Conference of Commission on Human Rights and she returned to the topic of economic justice, advocating for universal employment. In a 1981 interview she did with the Geriatric Nursing journal about her position as chair of the WHCoA, Alexander expressed her disapproval of anti-abortion legislation. She advocated for better benefits for nurses and stressed their vitality to the healthcare system. She also expressed that everyone, no matter their age or educational level, can add value to the economy with the proper support.

Caryn Mandabach was made a partner in the firm in 2001 (she joined in 1984), but left in 2004 to embark on her own production deal. Carsey-Werner has had its own production and, since 1997, distribution arms. Prior to controlling their own distribution, Viacom Enterprises, and later Paramount Domestic Television, syndicated their programming for them. In 2002 they announced a deal with Paramount Pictures to develop feature films through the studio. The group was also an original partner in Oxygen Media before Oxygen Media's sale in 2007 to NBCUniversal. Since then, they have mostly focused on distributing their existing shows with the 2018 revival of Roseanne and its spin off The Conners being some of the first shows they've produced in over 10 years.  History and Influential people  In 2004, Carsey and Werner mulled over the prospect of selling the studio, including its profitable catalog of shows, with UBS as their underwriter. Companies, most notably Viacom and Time Warner, expressed interest in buying the firm to exhibit their content on their cable networks. But the deal did not materialize and Carsey-Werner remained independent. = Stuart Glickman: CEO = A key addition to the Carsey-Werner management team was Stuart Glickman, who became chief executive officer in 1987. Originally a trial lawyer, Glickman became involved in the entertainment industry in 1968 when he became Assistant Counsel for American International Pictures. In 1970 he became director of business affairs for CBS Television. Glickman then worked as an entertainment lawyer for 15 years, providing legal and business advice to top companies and talents, including Carsey-Werner. After becoming the CEO, Glickman expanded on the company's production success with a mandate to create a diversified, global entertainment company with multiple revenue streams. He oversaw the creation of a distribution operation, reacquiring Carsey-Werner's library of shows from Paramount/Viacom, then brokered a number of innovative syndication deals. He helped to create Carsey-Werner Moving Pictures, to position the company to produce feature films. According to Variety, Glickman helped turn Carsey-Werner into a \\"tiny powerhouse.\\" The fortune of Carsey-Werner's core business, in the meantime, was mixed in 2000. The company's attempt to break into animation, God, the Devil and Bob, was pulled from NBC after only four episodes, unable to compete opposite ABC's hit quiz show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. The company did add a major new star, however, when it announced in May that Steve Martin had signed a production deal. Perhaps most important of all to Carsey-Werner's future may have been the announcement in June that its CEO of 13 years, Stuart Glickman, would be leaving the company to \\"explore new business and investment opportunities.\\" The company's fall production plans had just been concluded, with the return to network television of That '70s Show and 3rd Rock From the Sun, plus the addition of a new comedy, Don't Ask. \\"I wanted to wait for an orderly time when all things were done,\\" Glickman explained to Variety, adding: \\"I feel like I'm leaving the company in good shape.\\" Glickman also agreed to help in the search for his replacement.

These were the first releases for the home entertainment market since they allowed a limited edition of The Cosby Show to be distributed by Columbia House. In 2005/2006, Carsey-Werner was flooded with angry letters from fans of The Cosby Show and Roseanne, complaining about edited episodes. Carsey-Werner Distribution eventually decided that seasons 2 of The Cosby Show and Roseanne would be released with uncut shows. Roseanne was decided after John Goodman and Roseanne Barr appeared on Larry King Live and a fan called in, asking why Season 1's DVDs contained edited episodes. Barr and Goodman did not know about the editing, but Roseanne said she would talk to the producers. It has apparently worked, as there has been no evidence of editing on the Season 2, 3, and 4 sets. In 2006, they signed a deal with Magna Entertainment to release The Cosby Show and Roseanne on DVD in Australia. On May 4, 2011, Mill Creek Entertainment announced that they had signed a deal with Carsey-Werner Productions to re- release 3rd Rock from the Sun, Grounded for Life, Roseanne and That '70s Show on DVD in Region 1. At this time, it is unknown if this deal includes the future release of any other CW series. As of 2011, the following Carsey-Werner series have been released on DVD: * 3rd Rock from the Sun: Anchor Bay Entertainment (Region 1), Mill Creek Entertainment (Region 1), Network (Region 2), Beyond Home Entertainment (Region 4) * A Different World: Urban Works (Season 1 only) (Region 1) * Cybill: First Look Studios (Best-of) (Region 1), Anchor Bay Entertainment (Region 2), Beyond Home Entertainment (Region 4) * The Cosby Show: Urban Works/First Look Studios (Region 1), Universal Playback (Region 2), Magna Entertainment (Region 4) * God, the Devil and Bob: 20th Century Fox (Region 1) * Grounded for Life: Anchor Bay Entertainment (Region 1), Brightspark (Season 1 only) (Region 2), Visual Entertainment (Region 4) * Roseanne: Anchor Bay Entertainment (Region 1), Mill Creek Entertainment (Region 1), Magna Entertainment (Region 4) * That '70s Show: 20th Century Fox (Regions 1, 2 & 4), Mill Creek Entertainment (Region 1) = Internet = Several Carsey-Werner shows were made available on Netflix's Watch Instantly beginning in February 2011, including Roseanne, That 70's Show, The Cosby Show, & 3rd Rock from the Sun. However, in February 2012, Roseanne, The Cosby Show and 3rd Rock from the Sun were taken off instant streaming. Since then, selections of Roseanne and all of 3rd Rock from the Sun have been added back. = Controversy = In 2017, Carsey-Werner sued the BBC over possible copyright infringement for using audiovisual clips from The Cosby Show in a documentary called Bill Cosby - Fall of an American Icon that aired on June 5, 2017 on the BBC. = Remasters = In March 2013, Carsey-Werner announced it was remastering That '70s Show, 3rd Rock from the Sun, Roseanne, Grounded for Life, A Different World and The Cosby Show into 16:9 high-definition.

It is 2.9 miles (4.7 km) north of Havant, on the Hampshire/West Sussex border. The focal point of the village is the village green which is shaped somewhat like a lung. Surrounded by roads it is about long and about wide at its eastern end while tapering to almost a point at the western end near the railway arch. The village takes its name from a motte- and-bailey castle, the remains of which are situated to the south of Redhill Road and west of the railway line, east of the current centre of the village. History Evidence the Romans made pottery, brick and tiles in the Rowlands Castle vicinity has been uncovered, and this would have been aided due to the availability of suitable clay. The castle was built at some time between 1066 and 1199 and is first documented under the name ROLOKECASTEL in 1381. It was in good repair in the twelfth century, when Henry II spent several days there in hunting and amusement, but was abandoned by the 15th century. The site was damaged by the railway and quarrying in the 19th century, and now only the earthworks and a few small areas of wall remain. Governance Rowlands Castle is a ward and a parish council area within the East Hampshire local government district. It is also part of the East Hampshire UK Parliament constituency. Geography The village lies in the area of the former Forest of Bere on the eastern boundary of Hampshire. To the east in the parish of Stoughton is Stansted Park. Rowlands Castle lies on the northern edge of the Neogene deposits of the Hampshire Basin. The north of the village lies on the chalk of the southern South Downs. In the south is the Reading Formation which gave rise to the former local brick industry.British Geological Survey (1998), England and Wales Sheet 316 Fareham, 1:50,000 series geological map, Keyworth, Nottingham: British Geological Survey, Economy It is largely a quiet residential village, with four pubs and a few small shops, including a hardware store and a local convenience store. Culture and community A model railway depicting the village during the war has been created and is on display at nearby Stansted House. Transport Rowlands Castle is served by Rowlands Castle railway station on the Portsmouth Direct Line between London Waterloo and Portsmouth served by the generally hourly stopping service. There is just one significant bus route which operates every two hours during core daytime and goes via Leigh Park, Havant and Denvilles to Emsworth. The village is crossed by several long-distance footpaths: the Monarch's Way, Sussex Border Path, Staunton Way and Shipwrights Way. National Cycle Route 22 passes by the village green on its route from Havant to Petersfield. Religious sites =St John the Baptist= The Church of England parish church of St John the Baptist is situated to the west of the centre of the village close to the B2149 road. It is an aisled church with transept and chapels with the east window being a stained-glass depiction of the Crucifixion by Francis Austin. =Church on the Green= The Church on the Green United Reformed Church is prominent at the west end of the green. =St. Hubert's chapel= St Hubert's Chapel St Hubert's chapel or church is in the far north of the civil parish, Idsworth.Nearby.Org Co-ordinate converter, coordinate location It was built in 1053 and was originally dedicated to St. Peter and St. Paul. It is a Grade I listed building, listed on 16 March 1954. The chapel contains examples of medieval paintings from around 1300 which include paintings around the altar window of St Peter, St Paul, and two angels. On the north wall there is a painting of St. Hubert and St John the Baptist. The narthex contains an octagonal stone font and above it is a gallery which contains the church organ. Idsworth, based on its compact late Saxon church, was a chapelry long including Rowlands Castle and until a recent date unknown was dependent on the mother church of Chalton. Hence a dispute concerning the right to appoint the chaplain arose in 1275 between Henry de Bonynges, lord of the manor of Idsworth, who claimed it as an appurtenance, versus the prioress of Nuneaton, who made good (made out better) her right as patron of Chalton church, and therefore of the appendant chapel. The rectors of Chalton were bound from very early times to find a chaplain at the chapel to say mass on Sundays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and on double feasts throughout the year, and to administer the sacraments and other rites (except the burial of the dead) for the inhabitants of the hamlets of Idsworth \\"and Dene\\" (Horndean, or perhaps Finchdean). Sir William Haughe, rector of Chalton, discontinued this practice in 1394 and so proceedings were taken against him in the Court of Arches by Richard Romyn, lord of Idsworth manor, and the rest of the inhabitants of the two villages before Thomas Stowe and Adam Uske, who decided that the rector was liable by custom to find a chaplain to minister in Idsworth Chapel. This \\"sentence\\" (ruling) was published by the bishop of Winchester on 1 May 1398, and confirmed by the prior and chapter of Winchester on 3 June.'Parishes: Chalton', in A History of the County of Hampshire: Volume 3, ed.

Sport and leisure The village has an 18-hole golf course; the club being formed in 1902 with a 9-hole course. In 1994 Stage 5 of the Tour de France passed through Rowlands Castle, attracting large crowds to the carnival atmosphere. Notable people Former Van Morrison guitarist and Britain's Got Talent contestant Herbie Armstrong once ran The Fountain Inn in the centre of the village next to the village green. His weekly live music evenings attracted music lovers from across the region, and have been known to include some famous faces; Mick Hucknall on one occasion. Former British No. 1 tennis player Chris Wilkinson remains active in the local, county and national levels.

Whomp 'Em is an action platformer, akin to many games at the time. It bears some similarities to the Mega Man and Mario series. After completing the first stage, the player can play the other six in any order. Each of the stages revolve around elements, such as fire and water. After each stage, the player gains a new weapon, much like in the original Mega Man series, which was extremely popular at the time. Both Whomp 'Em and the prior Saiyūki World (which was an adaptation of Wonder Boy in Monster Land) are based on the Journey to the West novel. The title, \\"Whomp 'Em\\" is a pun, based on wampum, white beads used by Native American tribes primarily for trading.  Release  The game was released in Japan for the Famicom on December 7, 1990. The North American version of the game removed references to Journey to the West, by editing the game's sprite and graphics. The protagonist in the original was Sun Wukong, but is now a Native American, and the setting was changed to the Old West. Reception The North American video gaming magazine Nintendo Power gave Whomp 'Em an overall rating of 3.1 out of 5 in its May 1991 review. Allgame editor Brett Alan Weiss praised the game, describing it as \\"a solid platform game with crisp, clear graphics, peppy music, excellent controls, and a heroic character\\".

Life Descended from the legendary prince Rurik, Prince Lobanov-Rostovsky was educated at Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum. At the age of twenty, he entered the diplomatic service and became minister at Constantinople in 1859. In 1863, a regrettable incident in his private life made him retire temporarily from the public service, but four years later he re-entered it and served for ten years as an assistant to the minister of the interior. At the close of the Russo-Turkish war in 1878, he was selected by Alexander II as ambassador to Constantinople, and for more than a year he carried out with great ability the policy of his government, which aimed at re-establishing tranquility in the Eastern Question after the disturbances produced by the reckless action of his predecessor, Count Ignatiev. In 1879 he was transferred to London, and in 1882 to Vienna. In March 1895, under Nicholas II, he was appointed minister of foreign affairs in succession to Nicholas de Giers. In this position he displayed much of the caution of his predecessor, but adopted a more energetic policy in European affairs generally and especially in the Balkan Peninsula. At the time of his appointment the attitude of the Russian government towards the Slav nationalities had been for several years one of extreme reserve, and he had seemed as ambassador to sympathize with this attitude. But as soon as he became minister of foreign affairs, Russian influence in the Balkan Peninsula suddenly revived. Serbia received financial assistance; a large consignment of arms was sent openly from St. Petersburg to the prince of Montenegro; Prince Ferdinand of Bulgaria became ostensibly reconciled with the Russian emperor, and his son Boris was received into the Eastern Orthodox Church; the Russian embassy at Constantinople tried to bring about a reconciliation between the Bulgarian exarch and the ecumenical patriarch; Bulgarians and Serbians professed, at the bidding of Russia, to lay aside their mutual hostility. All this seemed to foreshadow the creation of a Balkan confederation hostile to Turkey, and the sultan had reason to feel alarmed. In reality Prince Lobanov was merely trying to establish a strong Russian hegemony among these nationalities, and he had not the slightest intention of provoking a new crisis in the Eastern Question so long as the general European situation did not afford Russia a convenient opportunity for solving it in her own interest without serious intervention from other powers. Meanwhile, he considered that the integrity and independence of the Ottoman Empire must be maintained so far as these other powers were concerned. At the same time efforts were made to weaken the Triple Alliance, the principal instrument employed being the entente with France, which Prince Lobanov helped convert into a formal alliance between the two great powers. In East Asia he was not less active and became the protector of China in the same sense as he had shown himself the protector of Turkey. By the Yamagata-Lobanov Agreement, Japan was compelled to give up her conquests in Northeast China, so as not to interfere with the future actions of St. Petersburg in Manchuria and financial and political schemes for increasing czarist influence in that part of the world were vigorously supported. All this activity, though combined with a haughty tone towards foreign governments and diplomats, did not produce much general apprehension, probably because there was a widespread conviction that he desired to maintain peace, and that his great ability and strength of character would enable him to control the dangerous forces which he boldly set in motion. However this may be, before he had time to mature his schemes, and when he had been the director of Russian policy for only eighteen months, he died suddenly of heart disease when travelling with the emperor on August 30, 1896. Personally, Prince Lobanov-Rostovskiy was a grand aristocrat of the Russian type, proud of being descended from the independent princes of Rostov, and at the same time an amiable man of wide culture, deeply versed in Russian history and genealogy, and perhaps the first authority of his time in all that related to the reign of Tsar Paul I (1754–1801). His extensive collection of coins, particularly those minted by the Russians during their occupation of Königsberg in 1758–1761, was acquired by the Russian Museum.

Born in Canada, Neuhaus moved to the United States where he became a naturalized United States citizen. He was the longtime editor of the Lutheran Forum magazine newsletter and later founder and editor of the monthly journal First Things and the author of numerous books. A staunch defender of the Roman Catholic Church's teachings on abortion and other life issues, he served as an unofficial adviser to 43rd President George W.

Early life and education Born in Pembroke, Ontario, in 1936, Neuhaus was one of eight children of a Lutheran minister and his wife. Although he had dropped out of high school at age 16 to operate a gas station in Texas,George Weigel: \\"An Honorable Christian Soldier\\", Newsweek, January 19, 2009 he returned to school, graduating from Concordia Lutheran College of Austin, Texas, in 1956. He moved to St. Louis, Missouri, where he earned his BA and MDiv from Concordia Seminary in 1960. Career =Lutheran minister/pastor= Neuhaus was first an ordained minister in the conservative Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod.. In 1974, a major schism in the Missouri Synod resulted in many \\"modernist\\" churches splitting to form the more progressive Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches to which Neuhaus eventually affiliated. The AELC, merged a decade later in 1988 with the other two more liberal Lutheran denominations in the U.S., The American Lutheran Church (1960) and the Lutheran Church in America (1962), to finally form the current Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, for which Neuhaus was a member of the clergy. From 1961 to 1978, he served as pastor of St. John the Evangelist Church, a poor, predominantly black and Hispanic congregation in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. From the pulpit he addressed civil rights and social justice concerns and spoke against the Vietnam War. In the late 1960s he gained national prominence when, together with Jesuit priest Daniel Berrigan and Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, he founded Clergy and Laymen Concerned About Vietnam. He was active in the Lutheran \\"Evangelical Catholic\\" movement and spent time at Saint Augustine's House, the Lutheran Benedictine monastery, in Oxford, Michigan. He was active in liberal politics until the 1973 ruling on abortion in Roe v. Wade by the U.S. Supreme Court, which he opposed and his perspective changed. He became a member of the growing neoconservative movement and an outspoken advocate of \\"democratic capitalism\\". He also advocated faith-based policy initiatives by the federal government based upon Judeo-Christian values. He originated the \\"Neuhaus's Law\\",First Things. \\"The Unhappy Fate of Optional Orthodoxy\\", First Things, February 2009 which states, \\"Where orthodoxy is optional, orthodoxy will sooner or later be proscribed.\\" He was a longtime editor of the monthly newsletter published in between quarterly issues of the interdenominational independent journal Lutheran Forum, published by the American Lutheran Publicity Bureau during the 1970s and 1980s. He was a supporter of the movement to reestablish, in Lutheranism, the permanent diaconate (deacon) as a full-fledged office in the threefold ministry of bishop / presbyter (priest) / deacon under the historic episcopacy (office of bishop), following earlier actions of the Roman Catholics in the Second Vatican Council and the Episcopal Church in the U.S., along with others in the worldwide Anglican Communion and the Church of England. In 1981, Neuhaus helped to found the Institute on Religion and Democracy and remained on its board until his death. He wrote its founding document, \\"Christianity and Democracy\\". In 1984, he established the Center for Religion and Society as part of the conservative think-tank Rockford Institute in Rockford, Illinois, which publishes Chronicles. In 1989, he and the center were \\"forcibly evicted\\" from the institute's eastern offices in New York City under disputed circumstances. In March 1990, Neuhaus founded the Institute on Religion and Public Life and its journal, First Things, an ecumenical journal \\"whose purpose is to advance a religiously informed public philosophy for the ordering of society.\\"\\"Mission Statement\\" , First Things =Roman Catholic priest= In September 1990, Neuhaus was received into the Roman Catholic Church. A year after becoming a Roman Catholic, he was ordained by John Cardinal O'Connor as a priest of the Archdiocese of New York. He served as a commentator for the Catholic television network Eternal Word Television (EWTN) during the funeral of Pope John Paul II and the election of Pope Benedict XVI. Neuhaus continued to edit First Things as a Catholic priest. He was a sought- after public speaker and wrote several books, both scholarly and popular genres. He appeared in the 2010 film, The Human Experience, released after his death, where his voice features in the narration and in the film's trailer.

Neuhaus' death\\", First Things, January 2009. Political significance In later years, Neuhaus compared anti-abortion activism to the civil rights movement of the 1960s. During the 2004 presidential campaign, he was a leading advocate for denying communion to Catholic politicians who supported abortion. It was a mistake, he declared, to isolate abortion \\"from other issues of the sacredness of life.\\" Neuhaus promoted ecumenical dialogue and social conservatism. Along with Charles Colson, he edited Evangelicals and Catholics Together: Toward a Common Mission (1995).. This ecumenical manifesto sparked much debate.

The 25 Most Influential Evangelicals in America – Richard John Neuhaus 2005 In 2005, under the heading of \\"Bushism Made Catholic,\\" Neuhaus was named one of the \\"25 Most Influential Evangelicals in America\\" by Time Magazine: Neuhaus was criticized for his political engagement as \\"theoconservatism.\\" In contrast, the theologian David Bentley Hart described Neuhaus as > a reflective, intelligent, self-possessed, generous, and principled man, is > opinionated (definitely), but not at all spiteful or resentful towards those > who disagree with him; words like \\"absolutist\\" are vacuous abstractions when > applied to him. His magazine publishes articles that argue (sometimes quite > forcibly) views contrary to his own, and he seems quite pleased that it > should do so.

Cremorne Junction is a locality within the suburb. Immediately adjacent to the suburb, to the south, is the small residential suburb of Cremorne Point. Cremorne is situated between Mosman and Neutral Bay. History =Aboriginal culture= Prior to the arrival of the First Fleet, the area in which Cremorne is situated was inhabited by the Cam-mer-ray-gal group of the Ku-ring-gai Aboriginal nation. The group, which inhabited the north shore of Port Jackson, was one of the largest in the Sydney area. =European settlement= Cremorne was named after the Cremorne Gardens in London, a popular pleasure ground in England, which derived its name from the Old Irish words Crích Mugdornd (modern Irish: Críoch Mhúrn), meaning 'boundary' or 'chieftain' of Mugdornd.https://web.archive.org/web/20130501212105/http://about.nsw.gov.au/view/suburb/Cremorne/%27%27 Cremorne, the Anglicisation of the Gaelic name Críoch Mhúrn, roughly meaning the 'Bounds of Mourne', was a barony in County Monaghan from which an Irish peer, The 1st Viscount Cremorne, took his title. Lord Cremorne gave his name to his London residence in what became the Cremorne Gardens. Other sources claim that rather than referring to a Chieftain, it refers to the territorial area of an ancient tribal group in County Monaghan. The Cremorne Gardens, Sydney, were established on the peninsula leading to Robertson Point in 1856, following the Cremorne Gardens, Melbourne, in 1853, just two of many such developments throughout Australia from the mid-nineteenth to early twentieth century. Although the Gardens closed in 1862, they gave their name both to the suburb at their location at Cremorne Point and to the suburb of Cremorne itself to the north.  Heritage listings  Cremorne has a number of heritage-listed sites on the New South Wales State Heritage Register (SHR) and the North Sydney Local Environmental Plan 2013 (LEP), including: * 8 Bannerman Street: Dalkeith Property (SHR & LEP) * 7 Cranbrook Avenue: Belvedere (Cremorne) (SHR & LEP) * 11 Cranbrook Avenue: Egglemont (SHR & LEP) * 274 Military Road: SCEGGS Redlands (LEP) * 380 Military Road: Hayden Orpheum Picture Palace (LEP) * 53-57 Murdoch Street: Cremorne Girls High School (Former) (LEP) Commercial area Cremorne is a mainly residential area with its commercial area centred along Military Road, around Cremorne Junction. Cremorne has a supermarket, a high-rise hotel known as Park Regis Concierge Apartments and a number of restaurants and shops. The Cremorne Town Centre includes the Cremorne Hotel. The commercial zone is smaller than neighbouring Neutral Bay. Small companies lease office space in this area. Cremorne features a historic cinema, the Hayden Orpheum Picture Palace. In an Art Deco style, it features a Wurlitzer pipe-organ that is played at selected film screenings. The cinema was designed by G. N. Kenworthy and constructed in 1935 by Angelo Virgona. Its restoration was undertaken in 1987 by its new owner, television personality Mike Walsh.Sydney Architecture, Graham Jahn (Watermark Press) 1997 Demographics At the 2016 census, there were 11,227 residents in Cremorne.

He was a major figure in logical empiricism, a 20th- century movement in the philosophy of science. He is especially well known for his articulation of the deductive-nomological model of scientific explanation, which was considered the \\"standard model\\" of scientific explanation during the 1950s and 1960s. He is also known for the raven paradox (also known as \\"Hempel's paradox\\").SEP Education Hempel studied mathematics, physics and philosophy at the University of Göttingen and subsequently at the University of Berlin and the Heidelberg University. In Göttingen, he encountered David Hilbert and was impressed by his program attempting to base all mathematics on solid logical foundations derived from a limited number of axioms. After moving to Berlin, Hempel participated in a congress on scientific philosophy in 1929 where he met Rudolf Carnap and became involved in the Berlin Circle of philosophers associated with the Vienna Circle. In 1934, he received his doctoral degree from the University of Berlin with a dissertation on probability theory, titled Beiträge zur logischen Analyse des Wahrscheinlichkeitsbegriffs (Contributions to the Logical Analysis of the Concept of Probability). Hans Reichenbach was Hempel's main doctoral supervisor, but after Reichenbach lost his philosophy chair in Berlin in 1933, Wolfgang Köhler and Nicolai Hartmann became the official supervisors.Carl G. Hempel, Selected Philosophical Essays, Cambridge University Press, 2000, p. viii. Career Within a year of completing his doctorate, the increasingly repressive and anti-semitic Nazi regime in Germany had prompted Hempel to emigratehis wife was of Jewish ancestryto Belgium. In this, he was aided by the scientist Paul Oppenheim, with whom he co-authored the book Der Typusbegriff im Lichte der neuen Logik on typology and logic in 1936. In 1937, Hempel emigrated to the United States, where he accepted a position as Carnap's assistant at the University of Chicago. He later held positions at the City College of New York (1939–1948), Yale University (1948–1955) and Princeton University, where he taught alongside Thomas Kuhn and remained until made emeritus in 1973. Between 1974 and 1976, he was an emeritus at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem before becoming University Professor of Philosophy at the University of Pittsburgh in 1977 and teaching there until 1985. In 1989 the Department of Philosophy at Princeton University renamed its Three Lecture Series the 'Carl G. Hempel Lectures' in his honor.philosophy.princeton.edu Philosophical views Hempel never embraced the term \\"logical positivism\\" as an accurate description of the Vienna Circle and Berlin Group, preferring to describe those philosophersand himselfas \\"logical empiricists.\\" He believed that the term \\"positivism,\\" with its roots in Auguste Comte, invoked a materialist metaphysics that empiricists need not embrace. He regarded Ludwig Wittgenstein as a philosopher with a genius for stating philosophical insights in striking and memorable language, but believed that he (or, at least, the Wittgenstein of the Tractatus) made claims that could only be supported by recourse to metaphysics. To Hempel, metaphysics involved claims to know things which were not knowable; that is, metaphysical hypotheses were incapable of confirmation or disconfirmation by evidence. Legacy In 2005, the City of Oranienburg, Hempel's birthplace, renamed one of its streets \\"Carl-Gustav- Hempel-Straße\\" in his memory.

The games star an anthropomorphic bobcat named Bubsy, a character that takes inspiration from Super Mario Bros. and Sonic the Hedgehog. The games were originally released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Mega Drive/Genesis, Game Boy, Jaguar, PC and PlayStation during the 1990s. There are six games that have been released in the series: Bubsy in: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind, Bubsy II, Bubsy in: Fractured Furry Tales, Bubsy is 3D in \\"Furbitten Planet\\", Bubsy: The Woolies Strike Back and Bubsy: Paws on Fire! In 1996, a special version of the first game, titled Super Bubsy, was released for Windows 95. In 2015, a compilation of the first two games was released for Microsoft Windows through Steam, by Retroism, the video game software subsidiary of Tommo. In addition to the games, a television pilot was created for a Bubsy cartoon show based on the video game series; however, it did not transition to become a full-fledged series.  History  = Bubsy in: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind = The first Bubsy game was released in May 1993 by Accolade for the SNES, and later for the Genesis. The plot focuses on a race of fabric-stealing aliens called \\"Woolies\\", who have stolen the world's yarn ball supply (especially Bubsy's, who owns the world's largest collection). A special version, titled Super Bubsy, was later released in 1996 for Windows 95, featuring graphics redrawn for a higher resolution, new game elements and the entire Bubsy television pilot. In addition to the power-ups found in the original game, there are bouncing TVs that Bubsy can collect which allow the player to view more of the cartoon. = Bubsy II = Bubsy II was released shortly after the first game, on October 28, 1994. In the game, the antagonist, Oinker P. Hamm, has created his \\"Amazatorium\\", which actually saps information away from history, and puts it on display, for his personal profit. It's up to the player to control Bubsy and stop this. The game features five levels; a music-themed world, a medieval era, an Egyptian area, an outer space zone, and an aerial zone with Bubsy flying a World War I biplane. Bubsy collects trading cards which he can use to buy various items. These include a \\"portable hole\\" (a small portal he can step through and disappear to the main lobby), a diver's suit, a Nerf gun, screen- clearing smart bombs, or extra lives. The game features the addition of Bubsy's nephew and niece that can be played by another player to help or hinder Bubsy. There are also secret stages involving Bubsy and his unwilling sidekick, Arnold the Armadillo. Additionally, Bubsy could take two hits (denoted by his expression next to the \\"lives\\" counter), and on a third, he would lose a life – though some hazards will still instantly kill him. Bubsy II is also the only Bubsy title to be reprogrammed for the Game Boy as a black-and-white game with Super Game Boy support for limited colors. This version of the game features the three levels of difficulty, but only has three of the original worlds (Egyptian, Musicland and Skyland) available for play. On November 16, 2015, a Bubsy re-release was posted on Steam Greenlight, titled Bubsy Two-Fur, by a game company that owns abandonware game intellectual property called Retroism. Two-Fur is a collection of the first two Bubsy games. Upon community interest, the game was greenlit. It was released on December 17, 2015.Steam Greenlight :: BUBSY Two-Fur – Steam Community\\". Steam. November 16, 2015. Retrieved November 27, 2015. = Bubsy in: Fractured Furry Tales = Bubsy in: Fractured Furry Tales was released on December 15, 1994 for the Atari Jaguar. This title sets Bubsy traversing across various fairy tales. The game sees Bubsy taking on the Mad Hatter in Alice in Wonderland, the Giant in Jack and the Beanstalk, the Djinni in Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves, a sea monster in Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea and Hansel and Gretel in Candyland. The game plays similarly to the prior two games in the series, but without any of the gadgets or band-aids of Bubsy 2. = Bubsy is 3D in \\"Furbitten Planet\\" = Bubsy 3D is the fourth Bubsy game, and was the only title in 3D. The game was released in 1996 for the PlayStation video game console. It is the sequel to the original in terms of the story and takes place on the Woolies' home planet, Rayon. Bubsy 3D has 16 main levels and two boss levels, and the main character's goal is to defeat the two queens of Rayon, Poly and Esther. The player can collect rockets, as well as atoms, in order to eventually escape from planet Rayon. Bubsy actively speaks throughout the game based on various actions performed by the player. A planned release for the Sega Saturn was cancelled.\\"Welcome to Bubsy 3D\\". Accolade. February 21, 1997. Retrieved on July 8, 2010. = Bubsy: The Woolies Strike Back = In October 2017, a fifth Bubsy title, Bubsy: The Woolies Strike Back, was released for PlayStation 4 and PC. The game was developed by Black Forest Games, who previously worked on reviving the dormant Giana Sisters series with Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams. = Bubsy: Paws on Fire! = In October 2018, a sixth Bubsy title, Bubsy: Paws on Fire!, was announced for an April 4, 2019 release date for PlayStation 4, PC and Nintendo Switch. The game was developed by Choice Provisions, who previously worked on the Bit.Trip series and Woah, Dave! The game was later delayed to a May 16 release date.

Television pilot Bubsy also had a pilot episode for an animated series sponsored by Taco Bell in 1993, titled What Could Possibly Go Wrong?. It featured new additions to the Bubsy franchise not made by the original Bubsy producer (Michael Berlyn) as he was on hiatus from Accolade at the time. These included Virgil Reality, a genius inventor and scientist; Oblivia, Virgil's assistant and planned future love interest for Bubsy; Ally the main antagonist, along with Buzz and Sid, her two Henchmen. The pilot was produced by Calico Creations. Rob Paulsen provides the voice of Bubsy, alongside voices from Tress MacNeille, Jim Cummings, Pat Fraley, B. J. Ward and Neil Ross.

The live line-up adds Master Bates, RunQ (Tarot, Eternal Tears of Sorrow) and DQ. Biography The band had a recording contract with Spinefarm Records (specifically Ranka Recordings), and their second album, Pirun nyrkki, was released on 29 March 2006. Shortly after a dispute over income developed between the band and Spinefarm, with the band filing a lawsuit against the label. During the ongoing case, a new album, U.S.C.H.!, was released for free download on 11 June 2008. A single, \\"Minä määrään\\" (\\"I Rule\\"), was also released for free before the album, on 21 May. On 9 March the group posted a statement on their website, clarifying the arguments between the band and their former record company Spinefarm Records had been settled, but stated that the terms of the agreement meant they could not discuss the matter further. U.S.C.H.! was released physically on 20 May 2009 including two bonus tracks. On 7 December 2012, lead vocalist Turunen suffered a stroke. The band was on small hiatus but returned on 22 January 2013 and revealed that a new album is coming out next autumn. On 4 April 2013, the band released a new single titled \\"Jalopiina\\" in two different forms; as a purchasable single or as a free download on their website. During the first day after the release, the Finnish record shop Levykauppa X held a campaign where the single was legally stealable. In May 2015, the band debuted two new singles, \\"Vastanaineet\\" and \\"Taisteluhuuto\\", and in July announced that their upcoming album Diskovibrator would be available on 25 September that year. In January 2017, Turmion Kätilöt announced on their Facebook page that long-time member Spellgoth had departed from the band. In August 2017, the band announced that after his trial period, Shag-U will become the full-time member of the band.

First political offices (1995–2002) Paradis was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in a 1995 by-election, called after Gaston Péloquin, the sitting Bloc Québécois member for Brome—Missisquoi, was killed in an automobile accident.Paradis is from Brome—Missisquoi; he defeated Daniel Mignault and Heather Keith-Ryan for the Liberal Party nomination. See \\"Byelections Quebec is key issue in vote: Byelections to target sovereignty Conway Daly,\\" Winnipeg Free Press, 29 December 1994.

Paradis championed the Canadian federalist cause in the campaign and said that his election would confirm Brome-Missisquoi's place within a united Canada.Tu Thanh Ha, \\"Paradis wins nod in Quebec riding,\\" Globe and Mail, 9 January 1995, A4. It was noted that several members of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada joined the Brome—Missisquoi Liberal riding association in this by- election, due to the weakened status of their own party. See Fred Langan, \\"A two-way fight in the riding would in many ways mirror the referendum,\\" Financial Post, 14 January 1995, p. 17. The election was initially considered too close to call, but Paradis won by a significant margin. His victory was seen as helping the federalist cause in the buildup to the 1995 Quebec referendum on sovereignty.Derek Ferguson, \\"Chrétien's low profile irks Manning,\\" Toronto Star, 10 February 1995, A11. Paradis entered parliament as a backbench supporter of Jean Chrétien's government.

He was elected chair of the Liberal Party's Quebec caucus in February 1997. Paradis was returned to a second parliamentary mandate in the 1997 federal election, and in late 1997 he co-chaired a special committee that recommended Quebec's schools be divided on linguistic rather than denominational lines.Graham Fraser, \\"Committee endorses linguistic school boards in Quebec,\\" Globe and Mail, 8 November 1997, B12. He was named as parliamentary secretary to the minister for International Cooperation in January 1999, and in September of the same year he was promoted to parliamentary secretary to the minister of Foreign Affairs.Member of Parliament Profile: Denis Paradis, Parliament of Canada, accessed 30 November 2010. He was again returned to parliament in the 2000 federal election. Minister (2002–2004) =Chrétien government= Paradis was appointed as Secretary of State for La Francophonie and Secretary of State for Latin America and Africa in Chrétien's government on January 15, 2002. These were ministerial positions but not full cabinet portfolios.Guide to Canadian Ministries since Confederation: Secretaries of State, Parliament of Canada, accessed 13 January 2011. ;Africa Shortly after his appointment, Paradis met with Nigerian Information Minister Jerry Gana in an effort to prevent the execution of Safiya Hussaini.Isabelle Ducas, \\"Nigerian minister says Safiya Husaini will not be stoned to death,\\" Canadian Press, 22 February 2002, 20:13.

Some opposition parliamentarians, including Keith Martin, called for stronger sanctions. Chrétien later defended the Commonwealth's decision in his autobiography, writing that a harsher response would have been counter-productive. Paradis accompanied Chrétien on a 2002 delegation to Africa that included stops in Morocco, Algeria, Nigeria, Senegal, Ethiopia and South Africa.Daniel Leblanc, \\"MPs chosen for diversity,\\" Globe and Mail, 11 April 2002, A7; Gwynne Dyer, \\"The Enigma of Thabo Mbeki,\\" Guelph Mercury, 11 April 2002, A9.

In January 2003, Paradis hosted a diplomatic event called the Ottawa Initiative on Haiti. At this meeting, representatives from Canada, France, the United States of America, and the Organization of American States discussed Haiti's political future. No representatives of the Haitian government were present. A few months later, journalist Michel Vastel leaked information about the meeting that he said was given to him by Paradis. Writing in L'Actualité, Vastel claimed that the delegates decided that Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide should be replaced by a United Nations trusteeship within a year. Paradis has denied Vastel's claim. , page 43. Neither Vastel or L'Actualité retracted the story. Journalist Anthony Fenton later accused Paradis and other Canadian officials of being implicated in the 2004 Haitian coup d'état that overthrew Aristide. See Anthony Fenton, \\"Canadian crimes in Haiti: beyond complicity,\\" Canadian Dimension, 1 September 2004, p. 6. ;The Francophonie In December 2002, Paradis called for the creation of a watchdog organization to target human rights violations in Francophonie nations.David Ljunggren, \\"Canada wants Francophonie human rights watchdog,\\" Reuters News, 10 December 2002, 13:23. =Martin government= Paradis was not, during Jean Chrétien's tenure as Prime Minister, among the group of Liberal parliamentarians (MPs) who supported Paul Martin's leadership ambitions. He nevertheless supported Martin at the 2003 Liberal Party leadership convention, which was held to elect Chrétien's successor.\\"Secretary of State Denis Paradis gives his support to Paul Martin in the Liberal Party leadership race,\\" Canada NewsWire, 4 May 2003. Martin won a landslide victory and became prime minister on December 12, 2003. When he formed his first ministry, he appointed Paradis as minister of state for Financial Institutions.\\"List of the new Canadian cabinet,\\" Reuters News, 12 December 2003, 10:37. Paradis led several roundtable discussions with business, academic, and social groups in months that followed, during the buildup to the Martin government's 2004 budget.See for instance \\"Federal Finance Minister Ralph Goodale takes his pre-budget roundtable discussions to P-E-I and New Brunswick today,\\" Broadcast News, 23 January 2004, 04:38; \\"Canada NewsWire Daybook for Thursday, January 29, 2004,\\" Canada Newswire, 29 January 2004, 07:01; \\"CP News Agenda for Friday, Feb. 13,\\" Canadian Press, 13 February 2004, 03:10. Shortly before budget day, he said that the government would return to a practice of setting aside four billion dollars per year to cover emergency spending or the possibility of an economic downturn.Heather Scoffield, \\"‘Prudence' in budget will curb spending,\\" Globe and Mail, 8 March 2004, B1. Return to the backbenches and time out of office (2004–2015) Paradis was narrowly re-elected in the 2004 federal election over Bloc challenger Christian Ouellet. He was not re-appointed to the ministry and returned to the government backbenches.Susan Delacourt and Les Whittington, \\"New-look cabinet,\\" Toronto Star, 20 July 2004, A01. He lost his seat to Ouellet in the 2006 election, amid losses for the Liberal Party across Quebec. Paradis supported Stéphane Dion in the Liberal Party's 2006 leadership election.Philip Authier, \\"Former Quebec minister snubs Dion,\\" National Post, 28 September 2006, A6. The article title refers to Liza Frulla, not Paradis. Dion won an upset victory in this contest, defeating Michael Ignatieff on the fourth ballot. Paradis attempted to reclaim his seat in the 2008 federal election but was narrowly defeated by Ouellet in a rematch from 2006. Paradis ran for re-election in the 2011 federal election but lost to Pierre Jacob of the New Democratic Party amid a strong provincial swing to the NDP.\\"Brome- Missisquoi – Le Parti libéral va élire son exécutif\\" , farnham.enregion.ca, 12 November 2010, accessed 8 December 2010. Return to Parliament (2015–2019) Paradis again ran as the Liberal Party's candidate in Brome—Missisquoi during the 2015 federal election, and this time was victorious, beating New Democrat Catherine Lusson. He ran for the office of Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada, losing to fellow Liberal MP Geoff Regan. Subsequently, he was elected to chair the Standing Committee on Official Languages. He did not re-offer in the 2019 Canadian federal election.

Easter Island is located in the Pacific Ocean. Though its earliest inhabitants, the Rapa Nui People, are ethnically Polynesian, the island is part of the South American state of Chile. The music of the island combines influences from both cultures. History Traditional music from the island consists of choral singing and chanting, similar to Tahitian music. Families often performed as choirs, competing in an annual concert. They were accompanied by a trumpet made from a conch shell and a percussive dancer jumping onto a stone which is set over a calabash resonator. Other instruments include the kauaha, the jaw bone of a horse, upaupa, an accordion, and stones, which are clapped together for percussive effect. Due to ongoing contacts with Chile and elsewhere in South America, Latin American music has had influences on the music of Easter Island. Tango, for example, has spawned an Easter Island style called tango Rapanui, characterized by a simple guitar accompaniment instead of the frenetic bandoneon.

The device was meant to address a limitation in the built-in game control offered by the Apple II, by allowing either four Apple-compatible paddles or two Atari-style joysticks (but not both types at once) to be read by the computer simultaneously. The built-in game port on the Apple II, II+, IIe, and IIgs supports four analog paddles or two analog sticks, but only 3 buttons. With the Joyport, a game can support twice as many players as with a standard Apple game port, but game designers had to specifically modify their code to take input from the Atari side of the Joyport. Many of them did so, and this modification is what is often seen listed in Apple II game configuration screens as the \\"Atari Joyport\\" option. The recommended Atari joysticks are switch-driven (i.e. digital), instead of the usual smoother- action analog sticks available for the Apple II. Since the Apple II hardware makes no distinction between two paddles or a single analog joystick plugged into the same jack, it is also been possible to connect and read two fully analog joysticks with the Joyport via the paddle jacks, but few (if any) two- joystick games supports this, and Sirius did not suggest it. Why not is unclear, but there may be a noticeable speed advantage when driving two digital rather than analog joysticks on the limited hardware of the time. Physical characteristics and packaging The Joyport is a white plastic brick about the size of a paperback novel that connects to the standard internal Apple II gameport and breaks it out into two Atari joystick ports and two Apple ports. A switch in the center controls whether to activate the paddles or the joysticks. Another switch optionally disables either the left- or right-side jacks. Bundled with the Joyport is Computer Foosball, which was written specifically by Hayenga for up to four players at once on the Apple II. Also included are BASIC and Pascal source code listings of sample programs making use of the Joyport, indicating the hobbyist influence in the market at the time it was released. Story of its invention The impetus for the invention of the Joyport came from well-known game designer Bill Budge, who Woita met at Apple and who had been thinking about a way to port games that required manipulation of two joysticks to the Apple II (Crazy Climber was mentioned specifically.). Woita agreed to work on a solution involving Atari controllers, and since at the time Hayenga was already working at Apple on a way to connect four paddles at once, the two hardware engineers began to cooperate on a single device, which was later christened the \\"Joyport\\". Both Woita and Hayenga were hired by Atari, where Woita designed the games Quadrun (1983), Asterix (1984), and TAZ (1984), for the Atari 2600, and Hayenga specialised in the Atari 5200, with the game RealSports Baseball (1983) and a port of Tempest.

It was published by Sinclair Research in association with Macmillan Education in 1984. It is an educational game in which the player takes on the role of one of a series of animals, and had to find food to survive while avoiding predators. Development Survival was developed as part of a series of educational software aimed at children aged between 5 and 12. This \\"Science Horizons\\" series was instigated by Sir Clive Sinclair and ex-Prime Minister Harold Macmillan. Gameplay The aim was to teach users about food chains; as an insect life is short, with the constant danger of being eaten by a bird - but as an eagle the player is at the top of the food chain with mankind or starvation as the only dangers. The simulation allows the player to be one of six animals: a hawk, a robin, a lion, a mouse, a fly or a butterfly. The world appears in scrolling grid form, with ice caps to the north and south. The player moves one square at a time, with visibility depending on the chosen animal, avoiding predators and find food and water. The game ends when the animal dies, either through starvation, dehydration, being killed by a predator, or old age. Reception CRASH magazine described Survival as an interesting and enjoyable program which can be used to reinforce learning, or on a self-discovery basis. One criticism was difficulty in remembering the control keys.

He was one of the architects of the Franco-Russian Alliance, which was later transformed into the Triple Entente, He promoted an image of Russia as a peaceful partner in dealing with complex and dangerous diplomatic situations, but most of the public credit went to Tsar Alexander.  Biography  Girs's family was of Scandinavian ancestry. Like his predecessor, Prince Gorchakov, he was educated at the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum, near St Petersburg, but his career was much less rapid, because he had no influential protectors, and was handicapped by being a Protestant of Teutonic origin. At the age of eighteen, he entered the service of the Eastern department of the ministry of foreign affairs, and spent more than twenty years in subordinate posts, chiefly in south-eastern Europe, until he was promoted in 1863 to the post of minister plenipotentiary in Persia. Here he remained for six years, and, after serving as a minister in Switzerland and Sweden, he was appointed in 1875 director of the Eastern department and assistant minister for foreign affairs under Prince Gorchakov, whose niece he had married. On the death of Alexander II in 1881 it was generally expected that Girs would be dismissed as deficient in Russian nationalist feeling, for Alexander III was credited with strong anti-German Slavophile tendencies. In reality, the young tsar did not intend to embark on wild political adventures, and was fully determined not to let his hand be forced by men less cautious than himself. What he wanted was a minister of foreign affairs who would be at once vigilant and prudent, active and obedient, and who would relieve him from the trouble and worry of routine work while allowing him to control the main lines, and occasionally the details, of the national policy. Girs was exactly what he wanted, and accordingly the tsar not only appointed him minister of foreign affairs on the retirement of Prince Gorchakov in 1882, but retained him to the end of his reign in 1894. Girs systematically followed a pacific policy. Accepting as a fait accompli the existence of the Triple Alliance, created by Bismarck for the purpose of resisting any aggressive action on the part of Russia and France, he sought to establish more friendly relations with the cabinets of Berlin, Vienna and Rome. To the advances of the French government, he at first turned a deaf ear, but when the rapprochement between the two countries was effected with little or no co-operation on his part, he utilized it for restraining France and promoting Russian interests. Rivalry between Britain and Russia grew steadily over Central Asia in the Great Game of the late 19th century. Russia desired warm-water ports on the Indian Ocean while Britain wanted to prevent Russian troops from gaining a potential invasion route to India. David Fromkin, \\"The Great Game in Asia,\\" Foreign Affairs(1980) 58#4 pp. 936-951 in JSTOR In 1885 Russia annexed part of Afghanistan in the Pandjeh Incident, which caused a war scare. However Girs and the Russian ambassador to London Baron de Staal set up an agreement in 1887 which established a buffer zone in Central Asia. Russian diplomacy won grudging British acceptance of its expansionism. Persia was also an arena of tension, but without warfare. Firuz Kazemzadeh, Russia and Britain in Persia, 1864-1914: A Study in Imperialism (Yale UP, 1968). He died on 26 January 1895, soon after the accession of Nicholas II. His son Mikhail Nikolayevich von Giers acted as last Imperial Russian Ambassador in Constantinople until the beginning of World War I in 1914. There were many high ranked 'von Giers' in Russian government, among them President in Podolien and minister Fredrik von Giers (1776 in St. Petersburg, 1842), minister Karl Ferdinand von Giers (1777, 1835), minister Konstatin von Giers (1777, 1835), Ambassador Nikolaus von Giers (1853, 1924), Ambassador Mikail von Giers (1856, 1932), Admiral Theodor von Giers (1835, 1905) etc. And some of these Giers relatives were married to other high ranked Russian families, among them General Komaroff, Princess Olga Cantacuzene and General Karl de Meyer. left Legacy According to Margaret Maxwell, historians have underrated his success in a diplomacy that featured numerous negotiated settlements, treaties and conventions. These agreements defined Russian boundaries and restored equilibrium to dangerously unstable situations. He supported numerous international commissions and made many goodwill missions, during which he repeatedly stressed Russia's peaceful intentions. His most dramatic success came in 1885, settling long-standing tensions with Great Britain, which was fearful that Russian expansion to the South would be a threat to India. Raymond A. Mohl, \\"Confrontation in Central Asia, 1885,\\" History Today (1969) 119#3 pp 176-183. Girs was usually successful in restraining the aggressive inclinations of Tsar Alexander III, convincing him that the very survival of the czarist system depended on avoiding major wars. With a deep insight into the tsar's moods and views, Girs was usually able to shape the final decisions by outmaneuvering hostile journalists, ministers, and even the czarina, as well as his own ambassadors. Under his leadership, Russia fought no foreign wars.Margaret Maxwell, \\"A Re-examination of the Rôle of N.K.

He spoke little to no English and committed the crime only a few weeks after he arrived in the United States. In 1833, a few weeks after his arrival in the country, le Blanc was allowed to live in the small dank basement of the Morristown, New Jersey farmhouse of the Judge Samuel Sayre family, in exchange for chopping wood and feeding hogs. He was unpaid. After two weeks of taking orders and hard work, he became angry and murdered the farmer by stabbing him in the back with an ax, his wife Sarah, whom he killed with a club, and their servant Phoebe, who may have been a slave. He proceeded to ransack the house for valuables. After the crime was discovered le Blanc was tracked down, captured and tried. The local judge ordered him hanged and dissected.

Geography Inala is south-west of the Brisbane CBD. Inala Avenue/Poinsettia Street is the main roadway east–west and Serviceston Avenue/Rosemary Street and Blunder Road are the main roads stretching north–south. Newer estate Forest Lake is situated to the south; other surrounding suburbs include Durack, Darra and Oxley to the north; Richlands, Ellen Grove and Wacol to the west; and Willawong, Acacia Ridge, Pallara and Doolandella to the East. History 'Inala' is an indigenous word meaning 'resting place', as this area was a traditional stopping point for indigenous travellers on their way east to the Moreton Bay region. The traditional tribe is Jagera, but the name Inala in not of the local language. Following World War II there was a shortage of 250,000 houses across Australia. In Queensland alone over 4,000 families were living in makeshift dwellings of tin, calico and canvas. The Queensland and Australian Governments responded by making housing a priority. The history of Inala started as the suburb of Serviceton, established following a meeting held in a Brisbane RSL Hall in May 1946. A group of ex- servicemen, led by Harold (Hock) Davis, were seeking affordable accommodation for their families during the post-war housing shortage. The Serviceton Co- operative Society was formed and they purchased 480 hectares of flood-safe land, which was then divided amongst the shareholders, giving them 800 square metres each. At that stage, Inala was planned as a satellite town set on a broad, high, gently sloping ridge In 1949–1950 the Queensland Housing Commission purchased Serviceton, comprising approximately 850 acres (3.4 km2) of land, from the faltering Serviceton Housing Co-operative. The Housing Commission subsequently annexed another 200 acres (0.8 km2) to the suburb and changed its name to Inala in 1953 to avoid postal confusion with another Serviceton in Victoria. Inala State School opened on 1 July 1955. In September 1974 it was expanded to include a pre-school. Inala Special School opened on 26 August 1968. On 1 January 2007 it was renamed Western Suburbs State Special School. Architecture The development of Inala coincided with the emergence of architectural modernism in Australia. The innovative designs of young southern architects such as Robin Boyd, Roy Grounds and Harry Seidler featured the efficient use of space with minimal ornamentation, utilisation of new materials and techniques, and above all design simplicity, while striving to build solid houses that would require little maintenance. Inala was designed and built in Modernist Revival style with elements of Art Deco. It was both aesthetically successful and a practical architectural solution. The post-war worldwide shortage of building materials coupled with huge demands created the impetus for exploring and using new materials and techniques in Inala. The choice to use reinforced concrete in the construction of Inala houses was made because of its strength, reliability and flexibility. Inala also had the advantage of good access to the local cement and concrete made from washed river sand and lime from Moreton Bay coral shipped up the river by barge and processed at Darra. Concrete was an ideal material for the fashionable Modernist style. Inala houses were built on raised concrete foundations, framed with hardwood timber, floored with hard-wearing brushbox, with silky oak used for window frames. The outer walls were constructed of poured concrete approximately 18 cm thick, internal walls and ceilings – with rendered wire lath. These robust construction techniques also served to minimise maintenance costs and achieve a long life span of the houses. Demographics In the , Inala recorded a population of 14,849 people, 48.5% male and 51.5% female. The median age of the Inala population was 34 years, 3 years below the Australian median. 45.9% of people living in Inala were born in Australia, compared to the national average of 66.7%; the next most common countries of birth were 19.4% Vietnam, 3.1% New Zealand, 2.0% Samoa and 1.9% England. 39.8% of people spoke only English at home. According to the , Inala has the largest Buddhist community (2,055 people; 13.8%) and the largest Vietnamese Australian community (4,446 people; 30.0%) of any suburb in Queensland.

Political representation Les Bryant, former ALP Richlands Ward Councillor, represented Inala in the Brisbane City Council for 17 years, 1991–2008. The Bryant family moved onto Blunder Road late 1946, when there was nothing but bushland where Inala now stands. They saw Inala grow from early beginnings to what it is today, a mature, successful multi cultural local community. Les and his wife Margaret still live in the Inala district today in retirement, in sister suburb Durack. Les was succeeded by Milton Dick (Australian Labor Party A.L.P.) in 2008, who moved into Federal politics winning the Federal Division of Oxley in 2016. Charles Strunk (ALP) won the renamed old Ward of Richlands, now Forest Lake Ward, in 2016, to become the new Brisbane City Councillor for Forest Lake Ward.

Turrell was a MacArthur Fellow in 1984. Turrell is best known for his work in progress, Roden Crater, a natural cinder cone crater located outside Flagstaff, Arizona, that he is turning into a massive naked- eye observatory; and for his series of skyspaces, enclosed spaces that frame the sky.  Background  James Turrell was born in Los Angeles, California.Birthplace sometimes given as Los Angeles (for instance, see Adcock, Craig, James Turrell: The Art of Light and Space, Berkeley/Los Angeles/Oxford : University of California Press, 1990, p. 2). Pasadena is given in a biographical note to the introductory leaflet for the 1993 exhibition at the Hayward Gallery, South Bank, London, UK. His father, Archibald Milton Turrell,Adcock, Craig, James Turrell: The Art of Light and Space, Berkeley/Los Angeles/Oxford : University of California Press, 1990, p. 2. was an aeronautical engineer and educator. His mother, Margaret Hodges Turrell, trained as a medical doctor and later worked in the Peace Corps. His parents were Quakers. Turrell obtained a pilot's license when he was 16 years old. Later, registered as a conscientious objector during the Vietnam War, he ended up flying Buddhist monks out of Chinese-controlled Tibet.Finkel, Jori. \\"James Turrell Shapes Perceptions. The Los Angeles Times. May 11, 2013. Some writers have suggested it was a CIA mission; Turrell called it \\"a humanitarian mission\\" — and that he found \\"some beautiful places to fly\\". For years he restored antique airplanes to support his \\"art habit\\". He received a BA degree from Pomona College in perceptual psychology in 1965 (including the study of the Ganzfeld effect) and also studied mathematics, geology and astronomy there. Turrell enrolled in the graduate Studio Art program at the University of California, Irvine in 1966, where he began making work using light projections.Belcove, Julie L. \\"Incredible Lightness\\", Harpers Bazaar, April 19, 2013. His studies at the University of California, Irvine were interrupted in 1966, when he was arrested for coaching young men to avoid the Vietnam draft. He spent about a year in jail.Wil S. Hylton (June 13, 2013), How James Turrell Knocked the Art World Off Its Feet New York Times. He later (1973) received an MA degree in art from Claremont Graduate University.Biographical note to the introductory leaflet for the 1993 exhibition at the Hayward Gallery, South Bank, London, UK In 2004, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by Haverford College. Artistic career =Early work= Landmarks, the public art program of The University of Texas at Austin and is on display on the rooftop of the William C. Powers, Jr. Student Activity Center. In 1966, Turrell began experimenting with light in his Santa Monica studio, the Mendota Hotel, at a time when the so-called Light and Space group of artists in Los Angeles, including Robert Irwin, Mary Corse and Doug Wheeler, was coming into prominence.James Turrell Nasher Sculpture Center, Dallas. By covering the windows and only allowing prescribed amounts of light from the street outside to come through the openings, Turrell created his first light projections.James Turrell: Early Light Works, November 13, 2004 – February 12, 2005 William Griffin, Los Angeles. In Shallow Space Constructions (1968) he used screened partitions, allowing a radiant effusion of concealed light to create an artificially flattened effect within the given space.James Turrell MoMA Collection, New York. That same year, he participated in the Los Angeles County Museum's Art and Technology Program, investigating perceptual phenomena with the artist Robert Irwin and psychologist Edward Wortz. In 1969, he made sky drawings with Sam Francis, using colored skywriting smoke and cloud- seeding materials.James Turrell Guggenheim Collection. A pivotal environment Turrell developed from 1969 to 1974, The Mendota Stoppages, used several rooms in the former Mendota Hotel in Santa Monica which were sealed off, with the window apertures controlled by the artist to allow natural and artificial light to enter the darkened spaces in specific ways.Christopher Knight (May 28, 2013), Art review: The light through James Turrell's eyes Los Angeles Times. =Roden Crater= Satellite view of Roden Crater, the site of an epic artwork in progress by James Turrell outside Flagstaff, Arizona Rendering of the interior of the Guggenheim installation Aten Reign Turrell is perhaps best known for his work in progress, Roden Crater. He acquired an extinct cinder cone volcano located outside Flagstaff, Arizona, in 1979. Since then he has spent decades moving tons of dirt and building tunnels and apertures to turn this crater into a massive naked-eye observatory for experiencing celestial phenomena. Although he works in the American desert, Turrell does not consider himself an earthworks artist like Robert Smithson or Michael Heizer: \\"You could say I'm a mound builder: I make things that take you up into the sky. But it's not about the landforms. I'm working to bring celestial objects like the sun and moon into the spaces that we inhabit.\\" He added: \\"I apprehend light — I make events that shape or contain light.\\" The completion date for the Crater has been pushed back several times for funding and construction reasons, with the artist missing early targets in the 1990s. The last time Turrell or his team went on record talking about a completion date, the goal was 2011; but according to a 2013 article in the Los Angeles Times, \\"nobody volunteers a date any more.\\"Finkel, Jori. \\"James Turrell Shapes Perceptions. The Los Angeles Times. May 11, 2013. Access to Roden Crater is limited to friends, though devoted fans can gain access by completing the \\"Turrell Tour\\", which involves seeing a Turrell in 23 countries worldwide. During May 2015, Roden Crater was open to a select group of 80 people, as part of a fund raiser, by allowing visits of 20 people per day during the course of four days, at a cost of $6,500 per person. As Roden Crater has been long shrouded in secrecy, fans have attempted to sneak in without the artist's permission. Some have succeeded.Finkel, Jori. \\"Shhh, It's a Secret Kind of Outside Art,\\" The New York Times, November 25, 2007 =Skyspaces= In the 1970s, Turrell began his series of \\"skyspaces\\" enclosed spaces open to the sky through an aperture in the roof. A Skyspace is an enclosed room large enough for roughly 15 people. Inside, the viewers sit on benches along the edge to view the sky through an opening in the roof. As a lifelong Quaker, Turrell designed the Live Oak Meeting House for the Society of Friends, with an opening or skyhole in the roof, wherein the notion of light takes on a decidedly religious connotation. (See PBS documentary). His work Meeting (1986) at P.S. 1, which consists of a square room with a rectangular opening cut directly into the ceiling, is a recreation of such a meeting house.James Turrell: Meeting, 1986 P.S.1, New York. In 2013, Turrell created another Quaker skyspace, Greet the Light, at the newly rebuilt Chestnut Hill Friends Meeting in Philadelphia. Space That Sees, at Israel Museum, Jerusalem In a New York Times article on L.A. collectors building skyspaces in their backyards, Jori Finkel describes a skyspace as a \\" celestial viewing room designed to create the rather magical illusion that the sky is within reach -- stretched like a canvas across an opening in the ceiling.\\"Finkel, Jori. \\"Five Bedrooms, Pool and Custom-Built Skyspace.\\" The New York Times. April 24, 2005 In 1992, Turrell's Irish Sky Garden opened at the Liss Ard Estate, Skibbereen, Co Cork, Ireland. The giant earth and stoneworks has a crater at its center. A visitor enters through a doorway in the perimeter of the rim, walks through a passage and climbs stairs to enter, then lies on the central plinth and looks upwards to experience the sky framed by the rim of the crater. \\"The most important thing is that inside turns into outside and the other way around, in the sense that relationships between the Irish landscape and sky changes\\" (James Turrell). In 2001, Turrell made a “sky room” and pool for Nora and Norman Stone in Napa Valley, in which visitors swim through a tunnel into the outdoor pool, where an aperture in the roof displays a perfect slice of sky.Caroline Roux (September 18, 2020), Why swimming pools are making a splash in the art world Financial Times. Since 2009, Turrell's Third Breath, 2005 is part of the permanent exhibition of the Centre for International Light Art (CILA) in Unna, Germany. It is a Camera obscura, consisting of two rooms: In the lower, cubic room (Camera Obscura Space), the visitor sees an image of the sky which is being reflected through a lens on the ground. In the upper, cylindrical room (Sky Space), the sky can be seen directly through a hole in the ceiling. Other Skyspaces include the Kielder Skyspace (2000) on Cat Cairn in Kielder, Northumberland, England; Knight Rise (2001) at the Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art; Second Wind (2005) in Vejer de la Frontera, Spain; the Sky-Space (2006) in Salzburg, Austria; and The other Horizon (2004) in Vienna, Austria (MAK-Branch Geymüllerschlössel). Three Gems (2005) at the de Young Museum is Turrell's first Skyspace to adopt the stupa form.James Turrell: Three Gems, 2005 de Young Museum, San Francisco. At Houghton Hall in Norfolk, the Marquess of Cholmondeley commissioned a folly to the east of the great house. Turrell's Skyspace presents itself from the exterior as an oak-clad building raised on stilts. From the inside of the structure, the viewer's point of view is focused upwards and inevitably lured into contemplating the sky as framed by the open roof.Donald, Caroline. \\"The new garden at Houghton Hall, King's Lynn, Norfolk,\\" The Times (London). May 11, 2008. Turrell's Dividing the Light (2007) is notable for incorporating water and landscaping. This Skyspace is an open-air pavilion, with a canopy structure and aperture, lighting program, pool, and landscaping, situated in the Draper Courtyard at Pomona College. The 16-foot square canopy aperture mirrors the continuous pool below, which is surrounded by granite seating and landscaping. At its opening, David Pagel of the Los Angeles Times called it \\"one of the best works of public art in recent memory.\\" His 2007 Deer Shelter Skyspace at Yorkshire Sculpture Park in England, commissioned by The Art Fund, was awarded that year's 2007 Marsh Award for Excellence in Public Sculpture. In 2013, Turrell completed The Color Inside, a Skyspace on top of the William C. Powers, Jr. Student Activity Center on campus at The University of Texas at Austin.The Color Inside was commissioned by Landmarks, the public art collection of The University of Texas at Austin. In September 2018, the Skyspace Lech was opened to public. It is located in Oberlech in Vorarlberg (Austria). =Other works= Completed in 2008, Turrell devised an indoor pool in Connecticut for collectors Lisa and Richard Baker, which creates the sensation of swimming in a mirrored light box. Caroline Roux (September 18, 2020), Why swimming pools are making a splash in the art world Financial Times. In 2009 the first museum worldwide dedicated to Turrell's work was opened in the province of Salta, Argentina. It is part of the Hess Collection at Colome. The light art pieces represent five decades of the artist's career, like a time tunnel, and are exhibited in a progression of nine rooms within a space. The experience concludes with a remarkable example of Turrell's exhibited sky spaces, created within the inner courtyard of the museum, which reaches maximum intensity in the views of the Andean sky at dawn and sunset. Turrell is also known for his light tunnels and light projections that create shapes that seem to have mass and weight, though they are created with only light. Three such works by Turrell (Danaë, Catso Red, and Pleiades) are permanent installations at the Mattress Factory in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Turrell's 1968 projection of a suspended luminous pink pyramid, Raethro Pink, was acquired by the Welsh National Museum of Art. His work Acton is a very popular exhibit at the Indianapolis Museum of Art. It consists of a room that appears to have a blank canvas on display, but the \\"canvas\\" is actually a rectangular hole in the wall, lit to look otherwise. Security guards are known to come up to unsuspecting visitors and say \\"Touch it! Touch it!\\" Turrell's works defy the accelerated habits of people, especially when looking at art. He feels that viewers spend so little time with the art that it makes it hard to appreciate. Art critic John McDonald writes that Turrell's works are \\"dull to describe but magical to experience.\\"  Exhibitions  Two separate shots side-by-side looking up toward the ceiling in the middle of the Guggenheim Museum in New York during James Turrell's light exhibition Aten Reign Turrell was given his first solo show at the Pasadena Art Museum in 1967. Solo exhibitions have since included the Stedelijk Museum (1976); Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (1980); Israel Museum (1982); Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (1984); MAK, Vienna (1998–1999); Mattress Factory, Pittsburgh (2002–2003). The Wolfsburg Project at the Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg, Turrell's largest exhibition in Germany to date, opened in October 2009 and continued through October 2010. Amongst the works featured in the Wolfsburg Project was a \\"Ganzfeld\\" work, which is a light installation that covers 700 square meters in area and 12 meters in height.Baker, Tamzin.\\"James Turrell / The Wolfsburg Project.\\" Modern Painters, November 2009. Also in 2009, the opening of the artwork Third Breath, 2005 at the Centre for International Light Art in Unna, Germany, was accompanied by the four-month exhibition James Turrell - Geometry of Light. James Turrell: A Retrospective, a major exhibition spanning the artist's 50-year career, was exhibited from May 26, 2013 to April 6, 2014 at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and travelled to the National Gallery of Australia. From June to September 2013 the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum presented James Turrell, the artist's first exhibition in a New York museum since 1980. The exhibition focused on the artist's explorations of perception, light, color and space. A new project, Aten Reign (2013), recast the Guggenheim rotunda as an enormous volume filled with shifting artificial and natural light. In early 2017, his work was featured in the solo exhibition, Immersive Light, at the West Bund Long Museum Shanghai. Into the Light, an installation of nine Turrell works, is on view at MASS MoCA from 2017 until at least 2020. James Turrell's work has been exhibited at public art spaces as well as commercial galleries around the world. He is represented by Häusler Contemporary, Kayne Griffin Corcoran, Pace Gallery, Hiram Butler Gallery, Almine Rech Gallery, and Gagosian Gallery.James Turrell Studio, personal communication, January 28, 2019.  James Turrell Museum  On April 22, 2009, the James Turrell Museum opened at the Bodega Colomé in the Province of Salta, in Argentina. It was designed by Turrell after Donald Hess, owner of the winery and several of Turrell's works, told him he wanted to dedicate a museum to his work. It contains nine light installations, including a skyspace (Unseen Blue, 2002) and some drawings and prints.  Collections  Turrell's work is represented in numerous public collections including Landmarks, the public art collection of The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX; the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, North Adams; the Tate Modern, London; the Centre for International Light Art, Unna; the Mattress Factory, Pittsburgh; Los Angeles County Museum of Art; the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; the Henry Art Gallery, Seattle; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; the de Young Museum, San Francisco; the Indianapolis Museum of Art, Indianapolis; the Israel Museum, Jerusalem; the Spencer Museum of Art, Lawrence, Kansas; Academy Art Museum, Easton, Maryland; and Hansol Museum, Wonju, Varese (Italy) Panza Foundation and Welsh National Museum of Art, Cardiff. In Japan, Turrell's works are in the collections of several museums, including the 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa and at the Chichu Art Museum at Benesse Art-Site in Naoshima, Kagawa. The Chichu Art Museum holds three works by Turrell, which are on permanent exhibition: the projection piece Afrum - Pale Blue (1968); Ganzfield work Open Field (2000); and skyspace Open Sky (2004). As part of the Chichu Art Museum's Art House Project, architect Tadao Ando designed a building named Minamidera (\\"Southern Temple\\") to accommodate a sensory-deprivation work by Turrell, Backside of the Moon, (1999). House of Light, (2000), which is a work commissioned for the first Echigo-Tsumari Art Field Triennial, is a building completely designed by Turrell that mixes traditional Japanese architecture with his signature light installations. House of Light also has a skyspace, whose view of the sunrise has been described as \\"the almost imperceptible change into deep blue was incredibly moving\\".Rawlings, Ashley.\\"Staying in James Turrel's House of Light.\\" PingMag (Tokyo). August 21, 2006  Awards  Turrell has received numerous awards in the arts including The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Fellowship in 1984, the National Medal of Arts in 2013, Americans for the Arts' Public Art Network in 2014, CODAvideo Awards, Top 100 in 2015, and Best of Austin, The Austin Chronicle, Best Zen Inducing Art Installation in 2015.

A popular recreation spot, especially for climbing and running, they are conveniently close to the city and the South Bank Parklands. It can be reached by the Pacific Motorway, South East Busway or a ferry to Thornton Street ferry wharf. The cliffs were formed after stone was quarried from the site and used in the construction of a number of local structures in the Moreton Bay penal settlement. History The Kangaroo Point Cliffs were created by convicts mining the volcanic rock or ignimbrite or welded tuff which form the cliffs. These lavas and pyroclastic rocks were deposited in the Triassic Period about 230 million years ago and filled an ancient river valley. These rocks were known as porphyry and later became known as the geological unit called the Brisbane tuff. Records indicate that it was Captain Patrick Logan, commandant of the Moreton Bay penal settlement, who first opened a quarry to supply stone to his building works as early as 1826. Those structures still standing today include The Old Windmill and the Commissariat Store. From 1842, the quarry was rented to private stonemasons (including John Petrie, later the first Mayor of Brisbane) until it was taken over by the Brisbane Municipal Council in 1860. It continued to supply stone as sailing ballast for ships. The Rector of St Mary's Church above the quarry believed this was a wasteful use of the stone and convinced the Queensland Colonial Government to take over control, which it did in 1864. In the 1880s, the government developed coal wharves along the southern end of the cliffs. They were serviced by a rail line and siding until the wharf was demolished in 1974. A marine defence depot was built at the foot of the northern end of the cliffs. It was used for storage and as a training facility. One of the buildings used by the depot remains today as the Naval Stores Museum. Stone from the quarry was used to line parts of the Brisbane River with walls, for the Manly Boat Harbour and at the new Port of Brisbane. The quarry finally closed in 1976. Climbing The cliffs are situated on the east bank of the river north of the Maritime Museum and opposite the Queensland University of Technology. The area is a popular picnic and abseiling site. The Kangaroo Point Cliffs feature excellent rock climbing possibilities for all skill levels, being primarily a place for recreational climbing. The cliffs are mainly used as a training ground by South East Queensland's rock climbers. The cliff face is lit at night by numerous flood lights.Kangaroo Point Brisbane Tourism Guide. Retrieved on 2013-11-07. Facilities At the base of the cliff, next to the Brisbane River, is a narrow strip of parkland. The park contains electric barbecues, tables and chairs, sculptures, toilets and ample views of the Captain Cook Bridge, Story Bridge, mangroves, the City Botanic Gardens and downtown buildings across the river. Native vegetation has been redeveloped into gardens which display a very natural design. At the top of the cliffs is Scout Park. It was opened in 1982 to commemorate 75 years of the scouting movement in Queensland. A new park was created at the site of the former TAFE college in 2010. Heritage listing The cliffs were listed on the Queensland Heritage Register in 2003.

This is the third film in which Martin and Moranis starred together. It has been noted for its relationship to Goodfellas, which was released one month later. Both films are based upon the life of Henry Hill, although the character is renamed \\"Vincent 'Vinnie' Antonelli\\" in My Blue Heaven. Goodfellas was based upon the book Wiseguy by Nicholas Pileggi, while the screenplay for My Blue Heaven was written by Pileggi's wife Nora Ephron, and much of the research for both works was done in the same sessions with Hill. Plot Vinnie Antonelli is a former mobster recently inducted into the Witness Protection Program with his wife, Linda. The two are under the watchful eye of Barney Coopersmith. Vinnie and Barney soon find common ground when both of their wives leave them due to their lifestyles. When he succeeds in getting Vinnie to a suburb in California and a private house, Barney has one more problem: he must make sure the jovial and sometimes mischievous Vinnie conforms to Witness Protection protocol until he is sent to Federal Court to testify against mob kingpins. Doing this is not as simple as it appears to be. Cast Production =Casting= Originally, Martin was cast to play Coopersmith, with Arnold Schwarzenegger playing the role of Antonelli. However, Schwarzenegger was soon thereafter offered the role of Det. John Kimble in Kindergarten Cop, and left the production. Failing to find another suitable \\"Vinnie\\" for Martin's Coopersmith, Martin offered to take on the role of Vinnie himself. Producers agreed, and then cast Rick Moranis as Coopersmith, who had originally been considered for the role, but was unavailable until then. =Filming= Principal photography took place primarily in the California cities of San Luis Obispo, Atascadero, Paso Robles, and the surrounding area, though the nominal setting is a fictional suburb of San Diego, California. Some scenes were shot in San Diego. The film's title comes from the famous song which appears on the soundtrack, performed by Fats Domino. Music The film's score was composed by Ira Newborn. # \\"My Blue Heaven\\" (Music: Walter Donaldson, Lyrics: George A.

Melbourne, The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd. is a town and locality in southeast Queensland, Australia, lying south-west of Brisbane. It is the administrative centre of the Southern Downs Region local government area. The surrounding Darling Downs have fostered a strong agricultural industry for which Warwick, together with the larger city of Toowoomba, serve as convenient service centres. The town had an urban population of 15,380 as at June 2018, Estimated resident population, 30 June 2018. having declined slightly at an average annual rate of -0.15% year- on-year over the preceding five years. Geography The Condamine River meanders from the east to the north-west of Warwick. One of its tributaries, Rosenthal Creek, enters Warwick from the south and enters the Condamine within Warwick. The Cunningham Highway and the New England Highway jointly enter Warwick from the north, cross the Condamine River, and then turn west within the town close to the Warwick central business district. The Cunningham Highway then continues west towards Goondiwindi, while the New England Highway heads south towards Stanthorpe. The Condamine River often floods, which can disconnect the northern and southern parts of Warwick and close the highways. Gauges that measure river height are used to provide flood alerts to residents. Low-lying land around the river is mostly used for recreation to minimise the damage caused by flooding with most developed areas at higher levels. Queens Park is a major park based around the river and the highway crossing. The Warwick central business district is laid out on a grid pattern and lies within one or two blocks of the long main street, Palmerin Street with Grafton Street the major cross-street. The statue of former Queensland Premier Thomas Byrnes is located at their intersection. History Second St. Mark's Church of England, Warwick, ca. 1872, the first (wooden) church can be seen in the background. Architectural plans of the \\"new\\" hospital in Locke Street, 1888 Architectural plan of the Warwick Baby Clinic, 1923 The Githabal (also known as Gidabal, Kitabal) language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Southern Downs Regional Council, particularly Warwick, Killarney and Woodenbong extending into New South Wales. The Warwick Green Belt, on the banks of the Condamine River, features a sculpture of Tiddalik the mythical frog that drank all of the fresh water in a renowned Aboriginal Dreamtime story. Patrick Leslie and his two brothers originally settled in the area as squatters, naming their run Canning Downs. In 1847 the NSW government asked Leslie to select a site on his station for a township, which was to be called 'Cannington,' although the name 'Warwick' was eventually settled on. Land sales were held in 1850, and the first allotment was bought by Leslie. Warwick East State School opened on 4 November 1850. It is one of the oldest state primary schools in Queensland. In 1851 the first Presbyterian services were held in Warwick. Land was granted to build a Presbyterian church in 1857 and a slab church was built in 1858. The telegraph to Brisbane was operating by 1861. Warwick Central State School opened on 26 July 1865. Miss O'Mara opened a school on 27 January 1867 in the Oddfellows Hall. The 1870s were boom years for this new town. In 1871 the railway reached Warwick,The Centenary of the Southern Line Kerr, J.D. Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, December, 1970 pp261-291 a brewery was built in 1873, then a cooperative flour mill and brickworks were completed during 1874. On 29 October 1874, the Sisters of Mercy took over Miss O'Mara's school at the Oddfellows Hall renaming it St Mary's School. Warwick was the seat of a series of local government areas, the Borough of Warwick from 1861, Town of Warwick from 1903, City of Warwick from 1936, Shire of Warwick from 1994, and Southern Downs Region from 2008. In 1877, of land was resumed from the Canning Downs pastoral run to establish smaller farms. The land was offered for selection on 19 April 1877. In 1878 the Queensland Government raised a loan of £5,000 to build a new hospital in Warwick. However, it was not until September 1880 after considerable local agitation that the government called for tenders to build the hospital, resulting in a contract awarded to A.W. Doorey to build the hospital. However, by February 1881, tenders were being called for again, and in April 1881 the Queensland Government announced the hospital would not proceed. In June 1881, the government indicated that they would proceed if the local financial subscriptions to the hospital were increased. Tenders were called again in February 1882 resulting in a contract with Messrs Wallace and Gibson in March 1882. Finally on Thursday 19 June 1884, the patients were moved from the old hospital to the new hospital in Locke Street. In 1893, the Sisters of Mercy relocated their convent and St Mary's School to the newly- constructed Our Lady of the Assumption Convent in Locke Street. The T J Byrnes Monument (a statue of the 12th Queensland Premier Thomas Joseph Byrnes) was built on the corner of Palmerin and Grafton Streets. The monument was built from 1901 to 1902 and was officially unveiled on Saturday 13 December 1902 by the Governor of Queensland, Sir Herbert Chermside. The unveiling of the monument was an important occasion for Warwick. Warwick State High School opened on 1 February 1912. It is one of the oldest state secondary schools in Queensland. St Mary's School also expanded, creating a secondary school called Assumption College in 1912, and in 1914 enlarging the convent to accommodate the growing secondary school. Lyndhurst State School opened on January 1913, but was quickly renamed Mount Gordon State School. It closed in 1985. The school was located on the corner of Wood Street and Parker Street (). On 29 November 1917, the Warwick Incident occurred, which would lead to the formation of the Australian Commonwealth Police with the first commissioner for Commonwealth Police appointed eight days later.Warwick Incident , published 7 January 2007 (accessed 7 January 2007) As Prime Minister William Morris Hughes was addressing a crowd at the Warwick railway station, a man in the crowd threw an egg dislodging the Prime Minister's hat. Hughes ordered his arrest but the Queensland State policeman present refused to carry out the orders saying that Hughes had no authority over him. In February 1918 the Church of England High School for Girls opened with over 40 students. The school was operated by the Sisters of the Sacred Advent and the first headmistress was Miss Margaret Brown. In February 1918 the Presbyterian Girls College (PGC) opened in an existing house “Glenbrae”on over five acres in Locke Street, as a boarding and day school with 53 girls under headmistress Miss Constance Mackness (who retired in 1949, the longest serving headmistress of the school). The school was established by local families who did not want to have to send their daughters to Toowoomba for a Presbyterian education. In 1918, to meet the need for Presbyterian education for boys, The Scots College opened as a Presbyterian boarding and day for boys in an existing house \\"Arranmore\\" on the banks of the Condamine River under headmaster James Logan Briggs. The Warwick War Memorial was built in 1923 and the memorial gates were built in 1924. Slade School opened on 30 January 1926 in the house \\"Eastmont\\" (now known as \\"Slade House\\") on the ridge on the northern side of the Condamine River. The school was operated by the Bush Brotherhood. In 1977 it merged with St Catherine's Anglican School (a school for girls operated by the Sisters of the Sacred Advent). The school closed in 1997. In 2000 the site was purchased by the Anglican Church Grammar School (based in Brisbane), becoming their Slade Campus. However they decided to close the campus in 2005 saying it was not economically viable. In 2007 the site was purchased by the local council. In 2013 the site was purchased by the Warwick Christian College which commenced operations in 2014. alt=Although the Queensland Government had architectural plans for a Baby Clinic in Warwick from at least 1923, it was not until Friday 21 February 1930 that the Warwick Baby Clinic was officially opened by Home Secretary J.C. Peterson. The building cost about £2,000 and was built on land donated by the Warwick ambulance brigade. The purpose of baby clinics was to prevent disease in early childhood and the Warwick Baby Clinic was the 15th built in Queensland. During World War II, the 2/12 Army General Hospital took over The Scots College buildings and grounds in Oxenham Street, with the school relocating to Kingswood and Toolburra. Warwick West State School opened on 31 January 1956. Glennie Heights State School opened on 25 January 1960. The current Warwick Public Library opened in 1964 with a major refurbishment in 1999. St John's Anglican Church at Thane closed circa 1968. The church was relocated to the Mile End Park, 177 Pratten Street in west Warwick where it continues to operate as St John's Anglican Church. In 1970, the Presbyterian Girls College and The Scots College merged into a co- educational school called Scots PGC College. On 5 February 1981, The School of Total Education was established in Warwick by Vijayadev Yogendra (1930–2005). Yogendra was a yoga teacher and educationalist, the son of Shri Yogendra (who in 1918 founded the Yoga Institute in India). The school aimed to develop children through spiritual and emotional growth to additional to physical and intellectual development. St Mary's School opened its Upper Campus in 2002.

This image is the final age, the Last Judgement. For images of the other six ages, see External links below. The Six Ages of the World (Latin: sex aetates mundi), also rarely Seven Ages of the World (Latin: septem aetates mundi), is a Christian historical periodization first written about by Augustine of Hippo circa AD 400.David C. Alexander Augustine's Early Theology of the Church 2008 Page 219 \\"Augustine discussed the seven days of the creation narrative figuratively in terms of seven ages of the world.\\" It is based upon Christian religious events, from the creation of Adam to the events of Revelation. The six ages of history, with each age (Latin: aetas) lasting approximately 1,000 years, were widely believed and in use throughout the Middle Ages, and until the Enlightenment, the writing of history was mostly the filling out of all or some part of this outline. The outline accounts for Seven Ages, just as there are seven days of the week, with the Seventh Age being eternal rest after the Final Judgement and End Times, just as the seventh day of the week is reserved for rest.G. Williams, P. Bibire Sagas, saints and settlements 2004 - Page 3 \\"As the Creation took six days, so the world will pass through six ages before reaching the seventh age, the sabbath. According to Augustine the first age extends from Adam to Noah,. 5 On aetates mundi before Augustine see R. Schmidt, ... \\" It was normally called the Six Ages of the World because in Augustine's schema they were the ages of the world, of history, while the Seventh Age was not of this world but, as Bede later elaborated, ran parallel to the six ages of the world. Augustine's presentation deliberately counters chiliastic and millennial ideas that the Seventh Age, World to Come, would come after the sixth.G. Williams, P. Bibire Sagas, saints and settlements - Page 4 - 2004 \\"... years of earthly history before the eternal heavenly kingdom.10 Augustine was keen to counter such millennarianism. ... The seventh age of the Augustinian scheme could be seen, and indeed Bede formulates it thus, as running parallel to ... Six Ages The Six Ages, as formulated by Augustine of Hippo, are defined in De catechizandis rudibus (On the catechizing of the uninstructed), Chapter 22: * The First Age \\"is from the beginning of the human race, that is, from Adam, who was the first man that was made, down to Noah, who constructed the ark at the time of the flood\\", i.e. the Antediluvian period. * The Second Age \\"extends from that period on to Abraham, who was called the father indeed of all nations\\". * The Third Age \\"extends from Abraham on to David the king\\". * The Fourth Age is \\"from David on to that captivity whereby the people of God passed over into Babylonia\\". * The Fifth Age is \\"from that transmigration down to the advent of our Lord Jesus Christ\\" * The Sixth Age: \\"With His [Jesus Christ's] coming the sixth age has entered on its process.\\" The Ages reflect the seven days of creation, of which the last day is the rest of Sabbath, illustrating the human journey to find eternal rest with God, a common Christian belief. Kabbalistic tradition There is a kabbalistic traditionZohar, Vayera 119a, Ramban on Genesis 2:3 that maintains that the seven days of creation in Genesis 1 correspond to seven millennia of the existence of natural creation. The tradition teaches that the seventh day of the week, Shabbat or the day of rest, corresponds to the seventh millennium (Hebrew years 6000–7000), the age of universal \\"rest\\" – the Messianic Era. The Talmud comments: The Midrash comments: The Zohar explains: Elaborating on this theme are numerous early and late Jewish scholars, including the Ramban,Ramban on Genesis (2:3) Isaac Abrabanel,Abarbanel on Genesis 2 Abraham Ibn Ezra,Ramban quoting Ibn Ezra at Leviticus (25:2) Rabbeinu Bachya,Bachya on Genesis 2:3 the Vilna Gaon,Safra D'Tzniusa, Ch. 5 the Lubavitcher Rebbe,Sefer HaSichos 5750:254 the Ramchal,Derech Hashem 4:7:2 Aryeh Kaplan, and Rebbetzin Esther Jungreis. Theory The idea that each age lasts 1000 years is based on II Peter 3:8: \\"But of this one thing be not ignorant, my beloved, that one day with the Lord is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.\\" The interpretation was taken to mean that mankind would live through six 1,000 year periods (or \\"days\\"), with the seventh being eternity in heaven or according to the Nicene Creed, a World to Come. Medieval Christian scholars believed it was possible to determine the overall time of human history, starting with Adam, by counting forward how long each generation had lived up to the time of Jesus, based on the ages recorded in the Bible. While the exact age of the earth was a matter of biblical interpretive debate, it was generally agreed man was somewhere in the last and final thousand years, the Sixth Age, and the final Seventh Age could happen at any time. The world was seen as an old place, with more time in its past than its future. While Augustine was the first to write of the Six Ages, early Christians prior to Augustine found no end of evidence in the Jewish traditions of the Old Testament, and initially set the date for the End of the World at the year 500. Hippolytus said that the measurements of the Ark of the Covenant added up to five and one-half cubits, meaning five and a half thousand years. Since Jesus had been born in the \\"sixth hour\\", or halfway through a day (or, five hundred years into an Age), and since five kingdoms (five thousand years) had already fallen according to Revelation, plus the half day of Jesus (the body of Jesus replacing the Ark of the Jews), it meant that five-thousand five-hundred years had already passed when Jesus was born and another 500 years would mark the end of the world. An alternative scheme had set the date to the year 202, but when this date passed without event, people expected the end in the year 500. By the 3rd century, Christians no longer widely believed the \\"End of the Ages\\" would occur in their lifetime, as was common among the earliest Christians.Robin Lane Fox (1986).

Modern use Today, the term is often loosely applied to all unnotated inflections (whether they are actually recta or ficta notes; see below) that must be inferred from the musical context and added either by an editor or by performers themselves . However, some of the words used in modern reference books to represent musica ficta, such as \\"inflection\\", \\"alteration\\", and \\"added accidentals\\" lie outside the way many Medieval and Renaissance theorists described the term . Historical sense and relation to hexachords Throughout the period that incorporated musica ficta, singers sight read melodies through a series of interlocked hexachords that formed the backbone of the solmization system—a method that eventually became the modern system of tonic solfa. To sing notes outside the recta pitches of the gamut (the range generally available to composers and performers, i.e., from G at the bottom of the modern bass clef to E at the top of the treble clef), performers had to invoke \\"fictive\\" hexachords to sing pitches such as F or E. Hexachords normally were formed only on C, F, and G, and the interval pattern within each of these hexachords was always tone-tone-semitone-tone-tone, which was sung as ut re mi fa sol la. Hence, if singers needed to sing the pitch F, they had to think of the half step between F and G as the solmization syllables mi and fa, for mi-fa always represented the half step within a hexachord. When they did this, they invoked a nominal hexachord starting on the note D, and this hexachord was considered fictive because it contained a false or fictitious F (that is, a pitch that did not belong to the recta notes of the gamut). Moreover, since the hexachord built on F naturally contained a B, music based on a scale involving the soft or F hexachord had the pitch B as part of the recta notes of the scale (. For a fuller explanation of these procedures, see ). However, in the 16th century, the signs used to represent these fictive notes (the signs for b mollis [] and b durum []) came to acquire their modern meanings of raising or lowering notes by a half step . Adrian Le Roy wrote that \\"b sharpe doeth holde up the tune halfe a note higher, and b flatte, contrarywise doeth lette it fall halfe a note lower\\" . But as early as 1524, theorists also had this understanding of these signs . Moreover, near the beginning of the 17th century, Michael Praetorius employed the words signa chromatica (chromatic signs) to refer to sharps and flats . Hence, no single understanding of the concept existed in the later Middle Ages and Renaissance. Practical application The signs b mollis and b durum were not notated with any regularity in vocal sources of the late Middle Ages and Renaissance, and although the principles singers used to supply the missing information were discussed in theoretical treatises, the explanations are far too cursory to enable modern musicians to reconstruct the old practices with any degree of accuracy . Tablatures, however, because they turn implicit solmization practices into explicit pitches, provide a precise view of how musicians, or at least those in the 16th century, added sharps and flats to vocal sources (the first tablatures were published in the early 16th century). (For an explanation of how lutenists intabulated vocal music, see .) Common practices (taken from ; ; ): * Many musicians in earlier times found the linear (melodic) and vertical (harmonic) dissonance caused by clashes between mi and fa aurally offensive (especially when it involved tritones and octaves), and they regularly removed the dissonance. Exceptions to this practice were common, however, particularly at cadences (; ); some musicians even found dissonant octaves acceptable at times (; ). * Despite the theoretical prohibition of what Zarlino referred to as occasions when \\"the parts of a composition do not have a harmonic relation between their voices\\" (\\"le parti della cantilena non habbiano tra loro relatione harmonica nelle loro voci\\") (, translation from ; false or cross relations in modern parlance), 16th-century tablatures demonstrate that musicians sometimes removed and at other times retained these clashes (; ). * At cadences and other places where two voice parts proceed to an octave or unison, singers normally approached the perfect interval from the closest imperfect interval; when the closest imperfect interval did not occur naturally in the music, singers created it either by adding a sharp to the voice rising by a whole step or by adding a flat to the voice descending by a whole step (see ; ). These practices were common throughout Europe, but in Germany musicians followed a distinctive set of practices for their own vernacular music, particularly at cadences, where they regularly avoided approaching perfect intervals from the closest imperfect intervals (for a discussion of the German customs, see ; ) Modern editions Today, editors usually show their recommendations for ficta in Medieval and Renaissance music by placing an \\"accidental\\" sign above the note in question. This indicates that these \\"accidentals\\" were not part of the original source. Editors place any signs found in a period document on the staff directly before the note the sign applies to—as they would an accidental placed by the composer of a modern work, and indeed as it appears in the original document.

The Rolling Stones includes four songs recorded at two separate sessions in August and November 1963. The Rolling Stones features R&B; covers of some of the band's favorite artists, and some recent American hits. Impact Sound is officially listed as the EP's producer. Eric Easton is possibly involved, Andrew Loog Oldham produced the opening track \\"Bye Bye Johnny\\". Release and reception Despite the rawness of the production, the EP reached no. 1 in the UK EP charts in February 1964, having entered the chart the week after its release. The EP was released in Canada in 1964 by London Records Canada. The release was identical to the UK version including the picture sleeve along with the British label number DFE 8560. The Canadian EP pressing also used British stampers. Bruce Eder of AllMusic writes: \\"The real centerpiece was Arthur Alexander's 'You Better Move On,' an American-spawned favorite that the band had been doing in concert — this was their chance to show a softer, more lyrical and soulful sound that was every bit as intense as the blues and hard R&B; they'd already done on record...\\" \\"Bye Bye Johnny\\" and \\"Money\\" did not see official US release until 1972's retrospective More Hot Rocks (Big Hits & Fazed Cookies); \\"You Better Move On\\" was featured on 1965's December's Children (And Everybody's); and \\"Poison Ivy\\" was issued in 2002 on the remastered version of More Hot Rocks.

The film follows a young woman (Paltrow) from a small town who sets out to fulfill her dream of becoming a flight attendant. Plot Donna Jensen is a girl from a small town in Nevada who wishes to see the world in order to get away from her unhappy life of living in a trailer with her alcoholic mother, a former Las Vegas showgirl, and her abusive, alcoholic stepfather, where she feels miserable and lonely. After graduating from high school, Donna tries to make ends meet by working as a clerk in a Big Lots. After her boyfriend, Tommy, leaves her for another girl, she goes to a bar where she sees a talk show segment about Sally Weston, who has written a memoir called My Life in the Sky, and decides to follow her destiny by becoming a flight attendant. Her first position is at a small, seedy California commuter airline called Sierra, where she works with Sherry, a senior attendant, and also gets an intern herself, named Christine. After working for several months, this success builds up her confidence and encourages her to attend open interviews for Royalty Airlines. She convinces Sherry and Christine to join her at Royalty Airlines. While Christine and Donna get in, Sherry does not, and remains in Sierra Airlines. After getting the job, Donna puts her heart and soul into the training camp, and, after meeting Weston, she is determined to be assigned to the top route, \\"Paris, First Class, International\\". Alas, when the assignments are posted, Donna is shocked and disappointed to discover that, instead of the top route, she has been assigned to a commuter route in Cleveland. Christine, who had initially struggled with the material and procedures, has inexplicably been assigned the high-priority New York City route, much to the dismay of Donna. A few months later, by chance, Donna runs into Christine in Cleveland. Donna knows from previous experience that Christine has the airplane soap from Sally's house during their training sessions, but is still shocked when Christine empties her handbag to reveal all manner of Royalty Air items. Even the smallest theft is strictly prohibited by Royalty Airlines, and could mean termination. Still sure there was some sort of error in her route assignment, Donna turns to Weston for help. Through a course of events, Donna discovers that Christine had switched their test booklets when they were being handed up to their trainer. With that, Donna realizes that Christine has cheated her way to the top route, wanting success herself but knowing that Donna would do better. When Sally asks to have airline security spy on Christine's flight—to see if she stole any property (a code blue)—Christine gets caught and is fired. Donna gets the chance to re-take her exam and achieves a perfect score, resulting in being assigned a Paris, First Class, International route. However, following her \\"destiny\\" means deciding between a boyfriend, Ted, and her career. She chooses the latter. Though she gets all that she wants—Paris, first class, International.—Donna realizes that she is still unhappy. She misses Ted terribly, and with Weston's encouragement, she returns to Cleveland to meet him. She does, and after a heartfelt speech to his deaf grandmother, which he overhears, the two reconcile. The film ends with Donna wishing her passengers well as they land in Cleveland, now moving her position from a flight attendant to a pilot.

Muravyov Count Mikhail Nikolayevich Muravyov or Muraviev () (, Saint Petersburg - ) was a Russian statesman who advocated transferring the attention of Russian foreign policy from Europe to the Far East. He is probably best remembered for having initiated the Hague Peace Conference.  Life and career  Mikhail Muravyov was the son of General Count Nicholas Muravyov (governor of Grodno), and grandson of Count Mikhail Nikolayevich Muravyov-Vilensky, who became notorious for his drastic measures in stamping out the Polish insurrection of 1863 in the Lithuanian provinces. He was educated at a secondary school at Poltava, and was for a short time at Heidelberg University. In 1864, he entered the chancellery of the minister of foreign affairs at St.Petersburg, and was soon afterwards attached to the Russian legation at Stuttgart, where he attracted the notice of Queen Olga of Württemberg. He was transferred to Berlin, then to Stockholm, and back again to Berlin. In 1877, he was second secretary at the Hague. During the Russo- Turkish War of 1877-78, he was a delegate of the Red Cross Society in charge of an ambulance train provided by Queen Olga of Württemberg. After the war, he was successively first secretary in Paris, chancellor of the embassy in Berlin, and then minister in Copenhagen. In Denmark, he was brought much into contact with the imperial family, and, on the death of Prince Lobanov- Rostovsky in 1896, he was appointed by Tsar Nicholas II to be his minister of foreign affairs. The next three and a half years were a critical time for European diplomacy. The revolt of Crete against Ottoman rule and events leading to the Boxer Rebellion in China were disturbing factors. Count Muravyov's policy regarding Crete was vacillating; in China, his hands were forced by Germany's action at Kiaochow. He misled Britain concerning the Russian leases of Port Arthur and Talienwan from China; he told the British ambassador that these would be open ports, and afterwards significantly modified this pledge. When Tsar Nicholas II inaugurated the Peace Conference at the Hague in 1899, Count Muravyov extricated his country from a situation of some embarrassment in China; but when, subsequently, Russian agents in Manchuria and Peking connived at the agitation which culminated in the Boxer Rebellion of 1900, relations between Muravyov and the tsar became strained. Muravyov died suddenly on June 21, 1900, after a stormy interview with Sergei Witte and Aleksey Kuropatkin in which Witte laid considerable blame on Muravyov for the crisis in China (Muravyov had insisted on taking Port Arthur against Witte's advice); because there was a wound on his left temple when he died, there was a rumor that he had committed suicide, but \\"the official government announcement asserted that, after rising late, he had merely slipped in his study and grazed his temple on the sharp side of a bureau.\\"Ian Nish, The Origins of the Russo-Japanese War (Longman, 1985; ), p. 73.

Sundew is one of 39 original seagoing buoy tenders built between 1942-1944. All but one of the original tenders, , were built in Duluth. Like all of these tenders, Sundew was named after a plant, in this case the sundew, a carnivorous plant from the genus Drosera. In 1958, Sundew was assigned to Charlevoix, Michigan, and the following November helped in the rescue of two survivors from the Carl D. Bradley when it sank in a storm on Lake Michigan west-northwest of Charlevoix. Sundew remained at Charlevoix until 1981, when she was replaced by . Sundew was then moved to Duluth, Minnesota, where it served until it was retired in 2004. Sundew served 60 years for the Coast Guard and was decommissioned and retired on May 27, 2004. As part of the decommissioning, the vessel was given to the city of Duluth, its last home port, to be used as a museum ship. The services provided by the Sundew were taken up by . Due to a drop in tourism revenue, in 2009 the city of Duluth sold Sundew to local residents, Jeff & Toni Foster and David Johnson & Mary Phillipp. Sundew moved from its museum location in Duluth in the spring of 2010, and currently (2020) occupies a private slip near Duluth's Great Lakes Aquarium.

Directed by Bruce W. Smith, in his directorial debut, it is based upon comedian Robin Harris' stand-up comedy act of the same name. Harris died two years before the film was released; in the film, he is voiced by Faizon Love in his film debut. Other voice actors include Vanessa Bell Calloway, Marques Houston, Nell Carter, and Tone Lōc, as well as Tom Everett, Rich Little, and Louie Anderson. The film was originally released on July 31, 1992, and received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $8.4 million. Plot The film is based on a stand-up routine by Robin Harris that is shown in a brief live-action segment at the beginning of the film. The story begins with an animated version of Harris woefully recounting his troubles to a blind bartender. He traces his problems all the way back to Jamika, an attractive woman he met at a funeral. Outside the premises, Robin approaches Jamika and asks her out. Jamika picks up her mild-mannered son, Leon, from the babysitter and invites Robin to come along with her to an amusement park named Fun World, to which Robin agrees. The next day, Jamika introduces Robin to LaShawn, Kahlil, and Pee-Wee, the neglected, truant, violent children of her absentee hedonistic friend, Bébé, for whom Jamika serves as an oblivious enabler. All six travel to Fun World, but are confronted by security before they can enter, and warned they are being watched. Upon entering the park, the kids are set loose and promptly wreak havoc. Robin's disastrous outing is further disrupted by a chance encounter with his ex-wife, Dorothea and her best friend Vivian. After going on a couple of rides with the kids, Robin and Jamika let the kids go off on their own again as they attempt to enjoy a ride through the Tunnel of Love, where Jamika commends Robin for his endurance. While Robin and Jamika spend time together on their own, Leon tries to fit in with Bébé's kids but is at first unsuccessful, although they allow him to tag along in their company. The kids then resume their trouble until they are caught by security. However, they escape and convince a bunch of other kids to spread the chaos. Meanwhile, Dorothea and her friend Vivian attempt to sabotage the growing relationship between Robin and Jamika but are thwarted by Robin. Elsewhere, in an abandoned building, Leon and Bébé's kids are captured by animatronic robot versions of the Terminator, Abraham Lincoln, and Richard Nixon, and are put on trial. The robot \\"Terminator\\" acts as the judge who decides whether the kids are worth sending to the electric chair, while \\"Lincoln\\" acts as the kids' defense attorney with \\"Nixon\\" as the prosecutor. Leon and the kids win through a powerful rap which ensures their freedom, then celebrate their victory by stealing a pirate ship and crashing it into an ocean liner, tying up the crew and passengers, including Dorothea and Vivian. Robin and Jamika finally leave Fun World with the kids who have destroyed the park. When a cop drives by, Robin tries to get his attention, but Bébé's kids glare at the cop threateningly and he flees, yelling, \\"Uh oh, those are Bébé's Kids!\\" (a line spoken by several other characters). Robin drops the kids off at their apartment, where he sees how they really live. Bébé, as usual, is not home and has left a note on the empty refrigerator, expecting Jamika to feed the kids. The kids, sad to see Robin go, bid him an emotional goodbye but not before he gives them his last few dollars so they could order themselves dinner. Back at the bar, Robin has a change of heart and goes back to the apartment to hang out with the kids a little while longer, despite the trouble they've caused. Later, the kids force him to take them all to Las Vegas, where the kids are recognized, and everyone runs away screaming. Pee-Wee pulls a plug out of a socket, causing a city-wide blackout.

Bébé's kids are misbehaved truants and violent troublemakers, over whom Jamika does not attempt to exercise any control. They terrorize park staff, cut off Donald Duck's feet to use for swimming, try to steal Robin's 8-track/radio while he's listening to it, and make a general menace of themselves, literally destroying the park. Their reputation is so bad that even the police refuse to mess with them. In the second act, Robin is picked up from a bar by Jamika and the kids. The kids force him to take them to Las Vegas. Pee-Wee pulls out a power cord and the city's power goes out.YouTube Soundtrack # \\"Down Home Blues\\" – Z Z Hill # \\"Tear It Up (On Our Worst Behavior)\\" – Immature # \\"I Got It Bad, Y'All\\" – King Tee # \\"I Got the 411\\" – Urban Prop # \\"It Takes Two to Make a Party\\" – Maxi Priest featuring Little Shawn # \\"66 Mello\\" – New Version of Soul # \\"Oh No!\\" – Arrested Development # \\"Straight Jackin'\\" – Bebe's Kids feat.

In brief, NOSA's goal is to ensure that Norway benefits from any space activity in which the Norway engages in. The agency was established as the Norwegian Space Centre in 1987 in conjunction with Norway's decision to join the European Space Agency (ESA). It functions as an agency of the Norwegian Ministry of Trade and Industry. Its purpose is to conduct space activities that are of use to society and contribute to business development. The agency is also charged with safeguarding and promoting Norway's interests in relation to ESA and the EU space programmes and in bilateral agreements with other countries. Its headquarters is located in Oslo, the nearest commuter train station is Skøyen station. History Norway has been engaged in space activities since the 1960s, well before the agency's founding. On 18 August 1962, the first rocket was launched from the Andøya Space Center in Vesterålen, Norway; this facility has been in regular use as a launch site for space-bound vehicles ever since. By 2012, in excess of 1,000 sounding rockets had reportedly been launched from Norwegian soil. Furthermore, since the 1960s, Norway started routinely funding satellite communications research, which has helped the country develop itself as the optimum location for receiving date from satellites stationed in a polar orbit. Norway was reportedly the first nation to use satellite communicates inland, enabling it to better support its oil industry and remote sites in the Arctic wilderness. During 1987, Norway became a member states of the European Space Agency (ESA). That same year, Norwegian Space Centre was established as a government body responsible for organising Norwegian space activities, particularly those related to the ESA and other international efforts, as well as its work in coordinating national efforts. One of its roles is to manage and distribute funding to most efficiently support the space sector and benefit Norwegian interests. Proposals produced by the body are overseen by the Norwegian Ministry of Trade and Industry. Since the agency's founding, Norway has continued to expand its space-based activities. The nation hosts the largest ground station for the Galileo global navigation satellite system (GNSS). Norwegian-built components have been integrated into many satellites in addition to the Ariane 5 heavy-lift launch vehicle and the International Space Station; various space-based missions have also sourced technologies from Norway. The country has also been a location for testing equipment bound for extraterrestrial use to evaluate its ability to withstand local conditions. During 1997, the Andøya Space Center was privatised, the Norwegian Space Center acquired a 90 percent stake in it as a consequence; the center is run on a commercial basis for undertaking both domestic and international missions. During the 2010s, the agency has been a partner in the development of the Nucleus hybrid sounding rocket, which is intended to be safer, cheaper, and more environmentally-friendly than prior models. During February 2019, the Norwegian Space Centre was formally renamed as the Norwegian Space Agency; according to Communication Director Marianne Moen, this change was enacted to reduce confusion over the organisation's function and to clarify that its status as a government body. Space Norway Space Norway is a related Norwegian space company that was established during 2014. Its mission statement is to own and/or lease space infrastructure and to make investments in space-related activities. While it operates as a commercial limited liability company, Space Norway is entirely owned by the Government of Norway. The company has been allocated a 50 percent stake in Kongsberg Satellite Services, which specialises in reading data from in-orbit Earth observation satellites on behalf of various satellite owners. During July 2019, Space Norway contracted with American companies Northrop Grumman and SpaceX to build and launch respectively its two-satellite Arctic Satellite Broadband Mission (ASBM) system, which is scheduled for launch in 2022.

It forms what trail managers, Northamptonshire County Council, describe as a linear park. The railway line was closed in 1981 and the Northamptonshire section was purchased by Northamptonshire County Council with grant aid from the Countryside Commission in 1987, when work began on developing it as a linear park. The section north of the county boundary is owned by Leicestershire County Council although Northamptonshire County Council undertake the management of the complete route. The Brampton Valley Way, from Boughton Crossing in Northampton to Little Bowden Crossing in Market Harborough, was opened in the spring of 1993 and provides recreational access for cyclists and walkers. Further developments to enhance access continue alongside everyday management of the site. The Way forms an offroad section of the Sustrans National Cycle Network Route 6. There are two former railway tunnels on the route, Kelmarsh () and Oxendon (). The tunnels are unlit and so can be quite an experience to travel through, although alternative routes over the tunnels are provided. A section of the Brampton Valley Way runs adjacent to the Northampton & Lamport Railway. The railway is separated from the linear park by a stout safety fence. As the railway extends, so the fence will be erected first to protect members of the public from the works. The Midshires Way passes through the Brampton Valley Way.

He made his debut as the Beetle in Strange Tales #123 (August 1964) (where the character was created by writer Stan Lee artist Carl Burgos) and later first appeared as MACH-1 in Incredible Hulk #449 (January 1997) during the Thunderbolts' debut. Jenkins started out as a gifted aircraft mechanic but grew frustrated with his boring, low-paying job and created an armor plated, mechanical suit and embarked on a criminal career as the \\"Beetle\\". On his first heist he was defeated by Human Torch and Thing from the Fantastic Four. He would later become a regular foe of Spider-Man, often as he worked as a henchman for various criminal organizations. Jenkins later organized his own group of criminals known as the Sinister Syndicate. When many costumed heroes seemingly died in a battle against Onslaught, Helmut Zemo recruited Jenkins and a number of other villains he had worked with in the past to form the Thunderbolts. All members adopted new costumed identities, posing as super heroes to gain access to the technology of the Fantastic Four or the Avengers, groups which had both seemingly perished. Jenkins became known as \\"Mach-1\\", using a modified version of his Beetle armor that was designed for faster flight and higher altitude. While the plan was originally to steal technology most of the members decided that they enjoyed the attention and adulation and decided to legitimately become heroes. Jenkins was convinced to give himself over to authorities to serve out an outstanding prison sentence in exchange for the Thunderbolts being granted immunity. During his time in jail Jenkins helped the authorities out, which led to him working for the government after his release from prison. He later began working at the Raft maximum security prison as head of security and worked with the Thunderbolts, who were now a team of criminals who tried to earn time off their sentence by carrying out missions for the government.

After some time away from the team, he has appeared as a regular character in Thunderbolts since issue #144, and has appeared as a supporting character since the title transitioned into Dark Avengers beginning with issue #175. Fictional character biography Abner Jenkins was born in Baltimore, Maryland. =Criminal career= Abner Jenkins was a master mechanic at an aircraft parts factory who became dissatisfied with his boring, low paying job. Using his considerable mechanical knowledge, Jenkins built an armor- plated, strength-augmenting suit, a pair of gravity-defying wings, suction- fingered gloves, and a cybernetic control helmet. Calling himself the \\"Beetle\\", Jenkins decided to use his battle-suit for fame, wealth, and adventure. Believing a victory over half the Fantastic Four would make him an overnight sensation, the Beetle chose to lure the Human Torch and the Thing into battle. However, Thing and Human Torch defeated him, and he was sent to prison.Strange Tales #123 Paroled a short time later, he sought revenge on Human Torch, but found himself in battle with Spider-Man instead. He kidnapped Human Torch's girlfriend, and Human Torch briefly battled Spider-Man, thinking he was in league with Beetle. Once again, with Human Torch's help, he was defeated after a cage of high-temperature flame was created around him. He was jailed once more.Amazing Spider-Man #21 Upon his release, he decided to forego petty revenge and concentrated on the acquisition of wealth. At one point, Beetle was mentally dominated and recruited by the Collector to serve as his unwilling agent.

His offer accepted, Beetle was dispatched against the original Iron Man, as part of a battalion of costumed criminals. His Beetle armor was severely damaged by Iron Man during the fight.Spectacular Spider-Man #127 Abner then invested all of the capital he could acquire into the modification and refinement of his Beetle armor. With the Tinkerer's assistance, he produced a new battle-suit with far greater capacities than his old one. Before launching his comeback, Beetle recruited the criminal Ringer to put Spider-Man through his paces. Beetle wished to study Spider-Man's fighting style and program it into a computer system so he could anticipate his opponent's moves. Despite his preparations and new battle-suit, Beetle was again defeated by Spider-Man.Spectacular Spider-Man #58-60 He was later freed from prison by Egghead who recruited him for his Masters of Evil organization. Beetle and other Masters of Evil were defeated by the Avengers and arrested.Avengers #228-229 Justin Hammer then commissioned Beetle, Blizzard II and Blacklash to kill Clayton Wilson, but Iron Man defeated them.Iron Man #223-224 Soon thereafter, Beetle battled Iron Man again, but this time all portions of the Beetle's battle armor using Stark technology were fused.Iron Man #227 Beetle organized his own team of super- villainous mercenaries called the Sinister Syndicate, which ran afoul of Spider-Man.Amazing Spider-Man #280-281Deadly Foes of Spider-Man #1 =As a member of the Thunderbolts= When most of Earth's costumed adventurers, including the then-core membership of the Avengers and Fantastic Four, seemingly died battling Onslaught, Baron Helmut Zemo recruited Jenkins and a number of other villains to trick the world into believing they were heroes called the Thunderbolts. Jenkins adopted the guise of \\"MACH-1\\". He was the first member of the team to do something because it was right rather than because it benefited the plan, providing Spider-Man with evidence to clear his name after an android framed the web-swinger for a series of thefts after the two were forced to fight the rest of the Thunderbolts under mind-control and Spider-Man saved Jenkins' life.Spider-Man Team-Up #7 Zemo's plan ultimately failed, but when Jenkins and other members began to enjoy the adulation and personal satisfaction from being heroes, they decided to try making the Thunderbolts a legitimate team. When Hawkeye took over the group's leadership, he convinced Jenkins to serve out the remainder of his prison term as a show of good faith to the public, but another criminal used the Beetle guise to frame him. While at Seagate, Jenkins coped with resentment and occasional assaults from other super-criminals and refused a chance to participate in a mass escape organized by his old employer Justin Hammer. Instead, Jenkins foiled the breakout, an act which brought him to the attention of the government's Commission on Superhuman Activities (CSA). They recruited Jenkins to participate in a sting operation aimed at Hammer. Jenkins agreed, using a newly designed armor to operate as the Beetle once more. The activities of the new Beetle attracted the attention of the Thunderbolts. Fearing the CSA might not honor the terms of their bargain, Jenkins fled CSA custody after completing the operation and rejoined the Thunderbolts. Hawkeye blackmailed the CSA into allowing Jenkins to remain free, even though the government's records would list Jenkins as still being in prison, in exchange for keeping the CSA's exploitation of Jenkins's secret. Jenkins created the \\"MACH-2\\" battle-suit after modifying his MACH-1 armor with the aid of Techno. Techno also altered Jenkins's physical appearance using \\"dermaplasty\\" technology since the public was not supposed to know MACH-2 was Jenkins, and the mischievous Techno had some fun at Jenkins's expense by giving him the features of an African American. When the Thunderbolts uncovered and thwarted a CSA-connected conspiracy to exterminate all superhumans, Hawkeye blackmailed the CSA into giving the Thunderbolts full pardons in exchange for the group's silence; however, CSA agent Henry Peter Gyrich insisted that he would not go along with the deal unless Hawkeye went to prison for his technically illegal vigilante activities as a member of the Thunderbolts. Hawkeye agreed, despite the protests of his teammates, and surrendered to federal custody. Most of the rest of the Thunderbolts, including MACH-2 and Songbird, were pardoned and released. However, as part of the terms of their deal, they were forbidden from public use of superhuman powers or costumed identities. MACH-2 and Songbird turned their equipment over to the authorities and started new civilian lives in the town of Burton Canyon, Colorado as Abe Jenkins and Melissa Gold. Ironically, Jenkins found himself employment with the Burton Canyon police department as a tech support specialist. Unfortunately, their quiet lives were shattered when the super-criminal Graviton launched his latest attempt at world conquest in Burton Canyon, imprisoning the world's superheroes and reshaping the planet in his own image. Despite their reluctance to risk their newfound freedom, Jenkins and Songbird agreed to join Citizen V (secretly Baron Zemo controlling Citizen V's body) in attacking Graviton as part of a new team of Thunderbolts. Jenkins was given new armor provided by Citizen V's financiers, the V-Battalion, and called himself \\"MACH-3\\". Graviton was defeated and the world was saved, but MACH-3 and the other Thunderbolts disappeared in an implosion created by the dying Graviton's power, with the exception of Songbird who appeared left behind as the sole survivor. On Counter-Earth On Counter-Earth, the team continued to band together, searching for a way to return to their own world and beginning to establish themselves as the leading superheroes of the troubled Counter- Earth. After a failed attempt to escape to the real Earth, the team entered into an uneasy alliance with their original leader, Baron Zemo, in an ongoing effort to save Counter-Earth from the various ills plaguing that alternate world. The Thunderbolts went on to revive the flying city of Attilan and populate it with refugees and survivors of the war-torn and nearly destroyed world. The Thunderbolts became renowned for their heroism and efforts to solve the world's problems. They were hailed by many to be the world's saviors. Nevertheless, Jenkins appeared to be going through the motions; his heart being elsewhere as his relationship with Songbird was thought to be lost. On Counter-Earth, Zemo's Thunderbolts had encountered the effects of a white hole spawned from an abandoned spacecraft, as its engine's radiation began eating Earth from the inside. The Thunderbolts embarked on a plan to combine their powers to punt the alien ship off the Earth and sever the link between the worlds. However, in order to complete this plan, the Thunderbolts needed to be inside the engine-spawned void in order to keep it clear of the real Earth as it closed. By so doing, they would reemerge from the void on the real Earth, forfeiting their roles and place on Counter-Earth. Emerging from the void, the Thunderbolts encountered their former teammates Hawkeye and Songbird who had formed their own version of the Thunderbolts who were similarly engaged with the void from the real Earth's counterpart of the spaceship. The two teams of Thunderbolts combined forces to plug the void and shunt the alien ship from Earth. Jenkins's reunion with Songbird was short-lived. Despite their feelings for each other, Jenkins left Songbird, once more remanding himself to police custody to serve the remainder of his sentence. Back on Earth For six months, Jenkins had been a model prisoner at Parsons Minimum Security prison in Illinois. He has since had his skin and face changed back to his original appearance, and has resumed contact with Songbird. Abe was recently approached by the Avengers on finding if they had been staying legit despite their suspicions. Abe told them they would have to stop Baron Zemo before he launched Project: Liberation, but that Moonstone was the one to really worry about. After Moonstone revealed her plans, Abe had Jolt contacted to help the Avengers and Thunderbolts stop her. Following the conclusion to the battle, Abe was finally paroled from jail and made an announcement that he was reforming the Thunderbolts and that any former villains or super-powered individuals who wanted a second chance would be allowed to join. He found himself the group's leader and lover to Songbird. Things continued to go crazy when the Thunderbolts kept being put into tough situations as Baron Wolfgang von Strucker threw new challenges to keep them busy, including adding Speed Demon to the team as a spy and allowing Fathom Five to attack New York City. Things finally came together when Abe revealed he always intended to take down Strucker. They succeeded in defeating HYDRA's scheme to destroy all of Manhattan, but Strucker managed to escape. Jenkins and the Fixer help Songbird and Black Widow escape from Norman Osborn and some H.A.M.M.E.R. agents.Thunderbolts #134–136 (Oct. 2009–Nov. 2009) Later, Mach-V works at The Raft as the Head of Security.

However, in the lead up the Secret Empire event, Baron Zemo attacks the Thunderbolts with a new incarnation of the Masters of Evil. Songbird and Abe resist Zemo's offer to join up with him and the rising Hydra empire and, in the fallout of their confrontation, Songbird is left searching the snowy wasteland for Abe's missing body.Thunderbolts Vol. 3 #12 Powers and abilities Abner Jenkins has no superhuman powers, but has extensive knowledge of mechanics and engineering. As the Beetle, he designed and wore a suit of full body powered armor that granted him superhuman strength and durability and artificial winged flight. The suit's gloves contained pneumatic suction-grippers, enabling him to cling to walls or lift things with his fingertips. The suit could also create an electrostatic energy discharge referred to as the \\"electro-bite\\". On the back of the suit are a set of ultra-tough mylar wings powered by super efficient micro-motors which enable him to fly. Antennae built into the suit's helmet allowed reception and ultra-efficient conversion of microwaves, providing the suit with a constantly replenishing power supply. A mini-computer built into the chest-plate feeds data to heads-up displays in the helmet, providing him with constantly updated tactical analysis of his opponent's movements. As MACH-I through MACH-IV, he designed a new suit of power armor which granted superhuman strength and durability, and flight as his Beetle suit did. This new suit contains a variety of different weapon systems, however, instead of the insect-themed powers of the previous armor.

Fox) has turned down his marriage proposal after vomiting all over her during a hot air balloon ride during the proposal. After Nick runs into a friend who is marrying a beautiful, younger girl he met on a singles cruise, he decides to take a similar cruise with Jerry. While on their way to the travel agency, they get into a verbal altercation with a gay man who works at the agency they plan to book the cruise through. The manager (Will Ferrell) attempts to patch things up by handling their booking personally. To Jerry and Nick, the situation appears to be handled well and they leave, not expecting anything to go wrong. After they leave, it is revealed that the agent and manager, both men, are actually gay lovers, and that they have been booked on a cruise for gay men. During their trip, they come to learn that gay men are less objectionable than they first assumed. However, Jerry falls in love with the cruise's dance instructor Gabriella (Roselyn Sánchez) and in order to win her over, he pretends to be gay so he can get closer to her. Meanwhile, Nick blossoms a romance with a bikini model named Inga (Victoria Silvstedt). After an accidental affair with her mean, sex-obsessed coach Sonya (Lin Shaye), Nick must fend her off, after she has fallen in love with him as well. In the end, Jerry wins Gabriella while Nick loses out on Inga but sees a potential relationship with her sister instead.

It typically refers to the legislative designation of money for particular uses, in the context of a budget or spending bill.  Ecclesiastical law  In ecclesiastical law, appropriation is the perpetual annexation of an ecclesiastical benefice to the use of some spiritual corporation, either aggregate or sole. In the Middle Ages in England the custom grew up of the monasteries reserving to their own use the greater part of the tithes of their appropriated benefices, leaving only a small portion to their vicars in the parishes. On the dissolution of the monasteries the rights to collect \\"great tithes\\" were often sold off, along with former monastic lands, to laymen; whose successors, known as \\"lay impropriators\\" or \\"lay rectors,\\" still hold them, the system being known as impropriation.  Law of debtor and creditor  In the law of debtor and creditor, appropriation of payments is the application of a particular payment for the purpose of paying a particular debt. When a creditor has two debts due to him from the same debtor on distinct accounts, the general law as to the appropriation of payments made by the debtor is that the debtor is entitled to apply the payments to such account as he thinks fit; solvitur in modum solventis. In default of appropriation by the debtor the creditor is entitled to determine the application of the sums paid, and may appropriate them even to the discharge of debts barred by the Statute of Limitations. In default of appropriation by either debtor or creditor, the law implies an appropriation of the earlier payments to the earlier debts. Constitutional law  In constitutional law, appropriation is the assignment of money for a special purpose. In the United Kingdom an appropriation act appropriating various sums to government departments and quangos, as set out by the government. = United States = In the United States, an appropriations bill is a bill that appropriates (gives to, sets aside for) money to specific federal government departments, agencies, and programs. The money provides funding for operations, personnel, equipment, and activities. Regular appropriations bills are passed annually, with the funding they provide covering one fiscal year. The fiscal year is the accounting period of the American federal government, which runs from October 1 to September 30 of the following year. The United States Constitution (art. I. § 9) says: \\"No money shall be drawn from the treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law.\\" This places the responsibility and power of deciding appropriations under the jurisdiction of the United States House Committee on Appropriations and the United States Senate Committee on Appropriations. Both committees have twelve matching subcommittees, each tasked with working on one of the twelve annual regular appropriations bills. Appropriations bills in the United States can also come in the format of an omnibus spending bill, a continuing resolution, or a supplemental appropriation bill. If Congress has not enacted the regular appropriations bills by the start of a new fiscal year, it can pass a continuing resolution, which continues the pre-existing appropriations at the same levels as the previous fiscal year (or with minor modifications) for a set amount of time. An omnibus spending bill is simply a combination of multiple appropriations bills into one larger appropriations bill. Supplemental appropriations bills increase funding for activities that were already funded in previous appropriations bills or that provide new funding for unexpected expenses. For example, both the War in Afghanistan and the Iraq War were funded with a variety of supplemental appropriations.National Priorities Project  Bringing the Federal Budget Home from the Cost of War website Supplemental appropriations bills also provide funding for recovering from unexpected natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy (the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013).  Criminal law  In England and Wales, the Theft Act 1968 s 3(1) defines appropriation as \\"Any assumption by a person of the rights of an owner\\".

It lives throughout western North America in rangelands dominated by sagebrush and forbs. Despite its name, the Mormon cricket is actually a shieldbacked katydid, not a cricket. It takes its name from Mormon settlers in Utah, who encountered them while pushing westward, and for the prominent role they play in the miracle of the gulls. Although flightless, the Mormon cricket is capable of traveling up to two kilometers a day in its swarming phase, during which it is a serious agricultural pest and traffic hazard. Description Mormon crickets have variable coloration. The overall color may be black, brown, red, purple or green. The \\"shield\\" (pronotum or modified prothorax that covers vestigial wings) behind the head may have colored markings. The abdomen may appear to be striped. Females have a long ovipositor, which should not be mistaken for a stinger. Both sexes have long antennae. Mormon crickets may undergo morphological changes triggered by high population densities, similar to those seen in locusts. The most noticeable change is in coloration: solitary individuals typically have green or purple coloration, while swarming individuals are often black, brown or red. Life cycle Utah, October 2005 Mormon cricket eggs hatch mostly in the spring after they are laid, although in some areas eggs may take as many as five years to hatch. Hatching begins when soil temperatures reach . The nymphs pass through seven instars before reaching the adult stage, typically taking 60 to 90 days. Breeding begins within 10 to 14 days of reaching the adult stage. The male passes to the female a large spermatophore which can be up to 27% of his body weight. The spermatophore is mostly food for the female to consume but also contains sperm to fertilize her eggs. This nuptial gift causes swarming-phase females to compete for males, a behavior not seen in solitary-phase females. The female lays her eggs by thrusting her ovipositor deep into the soil. Each female can lay over one hundred eggs, with individual eggs having the appearance of a grain of rice with a gray to purplish color. Swarming Nevada, summer 2006 The Mormon cricket exists in populations of relatively low density throughout most of its range. At certain times and places, however, population explosions or infestations occur in which large numbers of the crickets form roving bands. These bands may include millions of individuals and be found with densities of up to 100 individuals per square meter. These infestations may last years or even decades, and are characterized by a gradual increase and then decrease in population. The factors that trigger these infestations are poorly understood, but are thought to be weather-related. Research published in 2006 shows that Mormon crickets move in these migratory bands, firstly to find new sources of the critical nutrients of protein and salt, and secondly to avoid being eaten by hungry crickets approaching from the rear. The Mormon cricket's cannibalistic behavior may lead to swarm behavior because crickets may need to move constantly forward to avoid attacks from behind. When a large band crosses a road, it can create a safety hazard by causing distracted revulsion on the part of the driver, and by causing the road surface to become slick with crushed crickets. The crickets also can cause devastation to agriculture. Diet The Mormon cricket shows a marked preference for forbs, but grasses and shrubs such as sagebrush are also consumed. Mormon crickets also eat insects, including other Mormon crickets (especially individuals that have been killed or injured by automobiles or insecticides). Cannibalistic behavior may be a result of protein and salt deficiency; swarming behavior may in turn be a strategy to avoid predation by other Mormon crickets. During an infestation Mormon crickets can cause significant damage to crops and gardens. Control Multicolored swarm in Nevada, 2002. Mormon crickets are preyed upon by a wide variety of birds and mammals. These predators include California gulls, crows, coyotes and various rodents. There are no predators that specialize on Mormon crickets, which may be explained by the cricket's migratory habits and large population fluctuations. Gordius robustus, a species of horsehair worm, is a parasite of the Mormon cricket, as is Ooencyrtus anabrivorus. The most common chemical control method used is carbaryl (typically sold as \\"Sevin Dust\\") bait. This bait kills both the Mormon crickets that eat the bait, and the crickets that eat crickets that have eaten the bait. Insecticides applied directly to crops may kill the insects, but due to the large size of swarms, this method usually does not save the crop from being destroyed. As Mormon crickets are flightless, physical barriers may be effective. Barriers should be at least two feet high and made of a smooth material. Residents of some small towns have used boom boxes and sound systems playing hard rock music in attempts to divert the moving swarms away from crops and houses. Another method for the control of Mormon crickets is the use of a biopesticide based on the fungus Nosema locustae. N. locustae is a naturally occurring microbe the spores of which kill orthopterans by interfering with the digestive system. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, its use has no adverse effect on humans or the environment. Historical Mormon crickets appear in some traditional Native American diets. In 2003, officials in Utah, Idaho and Nevada said that year's infestation might be the worst in recent history.

In 2007, the chairman and trustees announced the society's closure. English origins It was patterned after the Newcomen Society of Great Britain, founded in London in 1920, a learned society formed to foster the study of the history of engineering and technology. Both groups took their name from Thomas Newcomen (1663-1729), the British industrial pioneer whose invention of the atmospheric steam engine in 1712 led to the first practical use of such a device—lifting water out of mines. Newcomen's invention helped facilitate the birth of the Industrial Revolution. He is frequently referred to as the \\"Father of the Industrial Revolution.\\" Charles Penrose, Jr., \\"The Newcomen Society in North America,\\" The Public Historian, Vol. 3, No. 3 (Summer, 1981), pp. 129-131 The Newcomen Society in North America The Newcomen Society of the United States began as The Newcomen Society in North America, founded at New York City in 1923 by Leonor F. Loree, then dean of American railroad presidents, together with a group of other prominent business leaders. The original members were nominated from leaders in business, industry, education, the military and other professions. Its declaration of purpose was to: * Preserve, protect and promote the American free enterprise system. * Honor corporate entities and other organizations which contribute to or are examples of success attained under free enterprise, and to recognize contributions to that system. * Publish and record the histories and achievements of such enterprises and organizations. * Encourage and stimulate original research and writing in the field of business history through a program of academic awards, grants and fellowships.The Newcomen Society in the United States website Charles Penrose, 1956, bronze bust by Bryant Baker Established soon after the ascent of communism in the Soviet Union, The Newcomen Society in North America championed American capitalism, material civilization and entrepreneurship. But the English and American branches together counted only 323 members in 1933, the year leadership for The Newcomen Society in North America went to its co-founder and Loree's friend, Charles Penrose, Sr. (1886-1958). A 1907 graduate of Princeton University with a career in engineering, Penrose found a new calling at Newcomen. Declining a salary, he became senior vice-president when the presidency was largely honorary, and under his dynamic governance the society achieved stature and prestige. He started sectional committees and aggressively recruited as members industrialists, educators, bankers and businessmen. Membership soared to 12,000, while the British chapter numbered less than 500. In the late 1940s, Penrose built the society's headquarters on Newcomen Road in rural Exton, Pennsylvania, complete with a 2,700 volume library and museum featuring a range of antique model steam engines operated by hand-cranking or electricity.Gerry Lestz, \\"Steam Theme at Newcomen Museum,\\" Steam Traction, 1981 Beside a chapel stood a belltower which played a carillon. Designed by the Philadelphia architect Briton Martin (1899-1983), the campus had offices, guest houses and a printing shop for Newcomen Publications, Inc., which Penrose founded to produce the society's corporate and academic histories, distinctive booklets illustrated with a mix of commissioned and antique engravings. At Seapoint Beach in Kittery Point, Maine, the society maintained a summer retreat with guest cottages in Tudor style. Penrose appeared to know personally the top executives of every major company in the United States, and by charisma and will, made Newcomen an important part of their lives. Called a \\"benevolent despot,\\" he oversaw every detail on the society's production line of tributes to organizations, from editing and publishing an average of 55 booklet histories per year, to officiating across the country at 60-70 luncheons and dinners annually at which the histories were orated by their authors. Except for educators, expenses were usually paid by the enterprises being honored, which bought for distribution over 12,000 copies to enhance their reputations. It is no exaggeration to say that, in its heyday, anyone who was anyone in American commerce, manufacturing and academia belonged to The Newcomen Society in North America. In 1952, Time Magazine referred to Penrose as \\"a combination of P. T. Barnum and the Archbishop of Canterbury.\\" It quoted him saying: :\\"We are attempting to hold up to America the vision and the courage and the hard work and abiding faith -- make that a capital F -- of the men who years ago created the America which we have inherited.\\" Reluctant to slow down with age, Charles Penrose, Sr. died suddenly in 1958, the year he finally became president. The chairmanship next went to his son, Charles Penrose, Jr. (1921-2007). By 1981, The Newcomen Society in North America had 17,000 members. Decline Following the retirement of Charles Penrose, Jr., membership declined during the stewardship of his successors. Despite its mandate to promote engineering and technology, Newcomen maintained clubby rituals that seemed dated in the age of the internet and video conferencing. Newcomen sold the Exton campus and its sumptuous furnishings. Its collection of antique model engines was auctioned by Christie's in 2001. On December 17, 2007, Chairman Daniel V. Malloy and the trustees announced that The Newcomen Society of the United States would close. Over its 84-85 year existence, it honored more than 2,500 organizations and institutions.

Strip clubs typically adopt a nightclub or bar style, and can also adopt a theatre or cabaret-style. American-style strip clubs began to appear outside North America after World War II, arriving in Asia in the late 1980s and Europe in 1978, where they competed against the local English and French styles of striptease and erotic performances. As of 2005, the size of the global strip club industry was estimated to be US$75 billion. In 2019, the size of the U.S. strip club industry was estimated to be US$8 billion, generating 19% of the total gross revenue in legal adult entertainment. SEC filings and state liquor control records available at that time indicated that there were at least 3,862 strip clubs in the United States, and since that time, the number of clubs in the U.S. has grown. Profitability of strip clubs, as with other service-oriented businesses, is largely driven by location and customer spending habits. The better appointed a club is, in terms of its quality of facilities, equipment, furniture, and other elements, the more likely customers are to encounter cover charges and fees for premium features such as VIP rooms. The popularity of a given club is an indicator of its quality, as is the word-of-mouth among customers who have visited a cross section of clubs in different regions. The strip club as an outlet for salacious entertainment is a recurrent theme in popular culture. In some media, these clubs are portrayed primarily as gathering places of vice and ill repute. Clubs themselves and various aspects of the business are highlighted in these references. \\"Top Strip Club\\" lists in some media have demonstrated that U.S.-style striptease is a global phenomenon and that it has also become a culturally accepted form of entertainment, despite its scrutiny in legal circles and popular media. Popular Internet sites for strip club enthusiasts also have lists calculated from the inputs of site visitors. The legal status of strip clubs has evolved over the course of time, with national and local laws becoming progressively more liberal on the issue around the world, although some countries (such as Iceland) have implemented strict limits and bans. Strip clubs are frequent targets of litigation around the world, and the sex industry, which includes strip clubs, is a contentious issue in popular culture and politics. Some clubs have been linked to organized crime.  History  alt=refer to caption The term \\"striptease\\" was first recorded in 1938, though \\"stripping\\", in the sense of women removing clothing to sexually excite men, seems to go back at least 400 years. For example, in Thomas Otway's comedy The Soldier's Fortune (1681) a character says: \\"Be sure they be lewd, drunken, stripping whores\\".Robert Hendrickson (1997) QPB Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins. New York, Facts on File, Inc: 227 Its combination with music seems to be as old. A conclusive description and visualization can be found in the 1720 German translation of the French La Guerre D'Espagne (Cologne: Pierre Marteau, 1707), where a galant party of high aristocrats and opera singers has resorted to a small château where they entertain themselves with hunting, play and music in a three-day turn: Other possible influences on modern stripping were the dances of the Ghawazee \\"discovered\\" and seized upon by French colonists in 19th century North Africa and Egypt. The erotic dance of the bee, performed by a woman known as Kuchuk Hanem, was witnessed and described by the French novelist Gustave Flaubert. In this dance the performer disrobes as she searches for an imaginary bee trapped within her garments. It is likely that the women performing these dances did not do so in an indigenous context, but rather, responded to the commercial climate for this type of entertainment. Middle Eastern belly dance, also known as oriental dancing, was popularized in the United States after its introduction on the Midway at the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago by a dancer known as Little Egypt. = European tradition = In France during the late 19th century, Parisian shows such as the Moulin Rouge and Folies Bergère were featuring attractive, scantily clad, dancing women and tableaux vivants. In this environment, an act featuring a woman slowly removing her clothes in a vain search for a flea crawling on her body was seen in 1895 and possibly filmed in 1897 by the first female director, Alice Guy. This routine, Le coucher d'Yvette, inspired \\"French acts\\" in theaters and brothels in other parts of the world, seen in the U.S. city of New York as early as 1878. The first public act of striptease in modern times is credited to Parisian theater in 1894. In 1905, Dutch dancer Mata Hari, later shot as a spy by the French authorities during World War I, was an overnight success from the debut of her act at the Musée Guimet. The most celebrated segment of her act was her progressive shedding of clothing until she wore just a jeweled bra and some ornaments over her arms and head. Another landmark performance was the appearance at the Moulin Rouge in 1907 of an actress called Germaine Aymos who entered dressed only in three very small shells. In the 1930s, the famous Josephine Baker danced semi-nude in the danse sauvage at the Folies and other such performances were provided at the Tabarin. These shows were notable for their sophisticated choreography and for often dressing the girls in glitzy sequins and feathers. By the 1960s \\"fully nude\\" shows were provided at such places as Le Crazy Horse Saloon.Richard Wortley (1976) A Pictorial History of Striptease: 11, 29–53. Exterior of the alt=refer to caption In Britain in the 1930s, Laura Henderson began presenting nude shows at the Windmill Theatre in London. At that time, British law prohibited naked girls from moving. To avoid the prohibition, the models appeared in stationary tableaux vivants.Vivien Goldsmith, \\"Windmill: always nude but never rude\\", Daily Telegraph, 24 November 2005 The Windmill girls also toured other London and provincial theatres, sometimes using ingenious devices such as rotating ropes to move their bodies round, though strictly speaking, staying within the letter of the law by not moving of their own volition. Another example of ways that the shows stayed within the law was the fan dance, in which a naked dancer's body was concealed by her fans and those of her attendants, until the end of her act in when she posed naked for a brief interval whilst standing still. In 1942, Phyllis Dixey formed her own company of girls and rented the Whitehall Theatre in London to put on a review called The Whitehall Follies. By the 1950s touring striptease acts were used to attract audiences to the dying music halls. Paul Raymond started his touring shows in 1951 and later leased the Doric Ballroom in Soho, opening his private members club, the Raymond Revuebar in 1958. This was the first of the private striptease members' clubs in Britain. Changes in the law in the 1960s brought about a boom of strip clubs in Soho with \\"fully nude\\" dancing and audience participation.Goldstein, Murray (2005) Naked JungleSoho Stripped Bare. Silverback Press Pubs were also used as venues, most particularly in the East End, with a concentration of such venues in the district of Shoreditch. This pub striptease seems mainly to have evolved from topless go-go dancing. Though often a target of local authority harassment, some of these pubs survive to the present day. A custom in these pubs is that the strippers walk round and collect money from customers in a beer jug before each individual performance. This custom appears to have originated in the late 1970s when topless go-go dancers first started collecting money from the audience as the fee for going \\"fully nude\\". Private dances of a more raunchy nature are sometimes available in a separate area of the pub. = American tradition = Historical marker at the original alt=refer to caption In America, striptease started in traveling carnivals and burlesque theatres, and featured famous strippers such as Gypsy Rose Lee and Sally Rand. The vaudeville trapeze artist Charmion performed a \\"disrobing\\" act onstage as early as 1896, which was captured in the 1901 Edison film, Trapeze Disrobing Act. Another milestone for modern American striptease was the possibly legendary show at Minsky's Burlesque in April 1925: The Night They Raided Minsky's. The Minsky brothers brought burlesque to New York's 42nd Street. However, the burlesque theatres there were prohibited from having striptease performances in a legal ruling of 1937, leading to the later decline of these \\"grindhouses\\" (named after the bump 'n grind entertainment on offer) into venues for exploitation cinema. The concept of \\"strippers\\" as we know it today with the pole dance has been popularized in the United States in 1972. British Columbia followed the lead around 1978. Widespread bans on striptease had a direct influence on the creation of the strip clip joint and the exotic dancer as known today. Bans still exist; enforced now mostly at the local municipal level. American-style striptease began to appear outside North America in the post-World War II era and is now practiced widely around the world. The 1960s saw a revival of striptease in the form of topless go-go dancing. Topless dancing was banned in certain parts of the country, similar to the bans on striptease, but it eventually merged with the older tradition of burlesque dancing. Carol Doda of the Condor Night Club in the North Beach section of San Francisco is credited with being the first topless go-go dancer.Nudity, Noise Pay Off in Bay Area Night Clubs, Los Angeles Times, February 14, 1965, Page G5. The club opened in 1964 and Doda's première topless dance occurred on the evening of June 19 of that year.California Solons May Bring End To Go-Go-Girl Shows in State, Panama City News, September 15, 1969, Page 12A. The large lit sign in front of the club featured a picture of her with red lights on her breasts. The club went \\"bottomless\\" on September 3, 1969; launching the trend of explicit \\"full nudity\\" in American striptease dancing. It was Doda's brand of dancing which is credited with the move from striptease to stripping. San Francisco is also the location of the notorious Mitchell Brothers O'Farrell Theatre. Originally an X-rated movie theater, this striptease club pioneered lap dancing in 1970, and was a major force in popularizing it in strip clubs on a nationwide and eventually worldwide basis.Lap Victory. How a DA's decision to drop prostitution charges against lap dancers will change the sexual culture of S.F.and, perhaps, the country. SF Weekly, 8 September 2004 A further development in the American tradition took place with the emergence of upscale \\"gentlemen's clubs\\" in the early 1990s in large cities such as New York. Scores New York was the first major gentlemen's club, with \\"a gorgeous interior, high-end food and drinks, and of course stunningly beautiful women in sexy gowns. Prior to that, live adult entertainment in New York consisted largely of seedy peep show-type places,\\" according to adult industry veteran Joe Diamond. = Asian tradition = The Japanese term for strip club, nūdo gekijo, literally means \\"nude theater\\". An older term was \\"sutorippu gekijo\\". American-style striptease became popular in Japan during the U.S. occupation after the end of World War II (1945–1952). Some girls chose to strip in theaters as an alternative to prostitution. When entrepreneur Shigeo Ozaki saw Gypsy Rose Lee perform, he started his own striptease revue in Tokyo's Shinjuku neighborhood. Teitoza was the first club to open in Shinjuku, on 15 January 1947. The first act was titled \\"The Birth of Venus\\". Each performance lasted for fifteen seconds and was modest by modern standards, incorporating veils, panties and a bra which covered much of what would be shown today. The woman on stage stood in a stationary pose, similar to shows in Britain. The show ran until August 1948. Theaters in Asakusa had fully nude displays, also featuring no motion or stripping. As this style of theater spread, the removal of clothing on stage was integrated into the process. Over time, as regulations were relaxed, a variety of acts developed with shows presenting a variety of movements such as taking a bath in an outdoor washtub. One of the most famous variants had audience members given magnifying glasses for close up views. During the 1950s, Japanese \\"strip shows\\" became more sexually explicit and less dance-oriented, until they were eventually simply live sex shows. The strip shows in Tokyo during this time remained low key, but Osaka and Kyoto were pushing the art of striptease in Japan into new territory. In 1956, Osaka became the first city in Japan to have pubic hair on display during a strip show. Dotonbori is a well known red light district in Osaka, Japan that has featured entertainment theaters and prostitution for hundreds of years. The strip clubs of today are the latest incarnation of its temptations. Peeping clubs, which feature peeping rooms (nozokibeya), are businesses where a customer views a girl through a hole from his own private cubicle. The customer then pays to watch a girl strip, pose, and masturbate. Kabukichō, a red light district in Tokyo, had 13 nozoki-beya in the early 1980s. The sex industry became so pervasive in Asia that by the 1990s, Kabukichō was described as a 'warren of peep shows, strip clubs, and massage parlors and Bangkok, Thailand attained a reputation as the sex capital of the world.  Entertainment and services  = Club offerings = American-style strip clubs are often structured as nightclubs or bars. High-end establishments are commonly referred to as \\"gentlemen's clubs\\", complete with luxury features and services. More down-market competitors can be known by various names, such as titty bars, rippers, peelers, skin bars, girly bars, nudie bars, bikini bars or go-go bars. Regardless of size, name, or location in the world, strip clubs can be full nude, topless or bikini. Where offered: * Full nude routines – The male or female performer is fully nude by the end of their performance. * Topless – The female performer's upper body is exposed but the genital area remains covered during a performance. * Bikini – The female performer's breasts and genital area remain covered, such as go-go dancing. For any of the three types of clubs there are exceptions based on the individual dancer and management. The use of pasties can alter the legal interpretation as to whether a performance is topless or not and whether a business is sexually oriented. A club might also hire or broadcast forms of entertainment other than striptease (such as pay-per-view events), for which it earns revenue via premium fees. Some clubs have also moved into providing chat and broadcast services via the internet, including live video feeds. Beyond this more passive entertainment, some clubs' dancers offer additional services, such as lap dances or trips to the champagne room, for a set fee rather than for tips. This fee will typically include a set fee for the room, for a fixed amount of time. Lap dances may also be offered during lingerie modeling sessions. During a lap dance, the dancer rubs against the customer's crotch while he or she remains clothed, in an attempt to arouse or bring the recipient to climax. Touching of strippers is not permitted in many localities, however, some dancers and clubs allow touching of dancers during private dances. In some parts of the U.S., there are laws forbidding the exposure of female nipples, and thus dancers must cover their nipples with pasties to comply with those laws. Such clubs are known as pastie clubs.  Striptease  A striptease is an erotic or exotic dance in which the performer gradually undresses, either partly or completely, in a seductive and sensual manner.Richard Wortley (1976) A Pictorial History of Striptease: 11. while doing so, the performer will make sure that the client feel warm, listened to and forget his problems. The main job of a stripper is to entertain and keep the clients on dreaming while being a semi \\"psychologist\\".The person who performs a striptease is commonly known as a \\"stripper\\" or exotic dancer. Most strippers are female, with less than a third of strippers being male strippers. Striptease and public nudity have been subject to legal and cultural prohibitions and other aesthetic considerations and taboos. Restrictions on venues may be through venue licensing requirements and constraints and a wide variety of national and local laws. These laws vary considerably around the world, and even between different parts of the same country. Striptease involves a slow, sensuous undressing. The stripper may prolong the undressing by making sure that the sensual build up has been properly done using techniques such as the wearing of actual clothes or putting clothes or hands in front of just undressed body parts such as the breasts or genitalia in a sensual and playful manner. The emphasis is on the act of undressing along with sexually suggestive movement, rather than the state of being undressed. In the past, the performance often finished as soon as the undressing was finished, though today's strippers usually continue dancing in the nude.Lara Clifton (2002) Baby Oil and Ice: Striptease in East London. The costume the stripper wears before disrobing is part of the act. In some cases, audience interaction can form part of the act, with audience urging the stripper to remove more clothing, or the stripper approaching the audience to interact with them. Unlike in burlesque theater, the modern popular form of strip theater can minimize the interaction of customer and dancer, reducing the importance of tease in the performance in favor of speed to undress. Most clubs have a dancer rotation where each dancer in turn will perform for one or more songs in a fixed sequence which repeats during a shift. Less formal clubs will have dancers take turns when a stage becomes empty or have a free flow of entertainers where the stage has any number of entertainers who wander off and on at will. Featured entertainers are not usually part of the rotation and they generally have set times when they will perform that are advertised throughout the shift. If a DJ is present, he or she will emcee the rotation and typically announce the current dancer(s) on stage and possibly whom to expect in future sets.  Private dances  In peep shows, done with a customer seated in a private booth separated from a dancer by glass or plastic, there may be no music playing during a performance, in which the woman removes her clothes and displays her body to the customer. In clubs which offer lingerie modeling shows, which are peep shows where a dancer privately dances and strips for a customer, typically without a barrier, performances can also be done with or without a formal stage or music. Private dances in the main club zones most often take the form of table dances, lap and couch dances, and bed dances among others. An air dance is a particular form of private dance where little-to-no contact between the dancer and customer occurs. This class of dance spans the different categories above and some dancers may perform air dances when more contact- heavy forms of dance were expected and paid for. Club management may set standard prices for the various dance services, but individual strippers, where permitted, will negotiate their own prices, which may be higher or lower than the advertised rate. Table dances are distinguished from other forms of dances in that they can be performed where the customer is seated, on the main floor. Table dance may also refer to a form of minimal-touch private dance where the performer is physically located on a small table in front of the customer(s). Table dances should not be confused with table stages, where the stripper is at or above eye level on a platform surrounded by chairs and usually enough table surface for customers to place drinks and tip money. Where offered, lap dances are performed in all manner of locations and seating, ranging from plain stools and kitchen-grade chairs to plush leather armchairs. They can also be performed with the customer standing in these designated areas. A service provided by many clubs is for a customer to be placed on stage with one or more dancers for a public lap dance. Occasions for this type of performance are bachelor parties and birthdays, among others. Bed dance areas require more space because they are designed for the customer to be prone with the entertainer(s) positioned on top of them. Bed dances are the least common of the three, and in many clubs are a more expensive option than a lap dance because of the novelty and increased level of contact between customer and service provider. = Customer service = Strip clubs are profit-oriented businesses like restaurants and other retail establishments. Performers and staff are the primary customer service representatives in the club environment. Dancers are their primary vehicle to entice customers to spend time and money in the establishment.  Interaction  backstage tending to their props away from the audience. alt=refer to caption Dancers continually interact with the customers in the club. They walk around and solicit drinks and lap dances, usually scanning the club floor to find the most lucrative customer to greet. The dancer qualifies a customer by sizing up their appearance and personal characteristics. Once the dancer identifies a suitable customer, she approaches, and attempts to establish a social relationship. Interaction can also be initiated by customers. Clubs generate revenue by cover charges, selling drinks, and other means. Dancers make most of their income from giving lap dances or VIP dances, where regulations allow. Otherwise, customer tips, at the stage, are a dancer's primary form of income. Dancers are entertaining the customers in exchange for money and employing all of the resources at their disposal to do so. They sell the fantasy of sex, but do not typically follow through with the act. Dancers, in an attempt to acquire a tip or monetary reward, may be selling more than just attractiveness and fantasy. They portray feelings of intimacy and emotional connectedness for their customers and most of the time these portrayals are overstated or false. The stage persona is different from who they are backstage, even if it does mirror aspects of their true personality. Within the context of the strip club, dancers might sometimes give the impression that they are revealing private (or backstage) information to customers in order to play a confidence game for increased profit. Dancers use props such as make-up, clothing, costumes, and appealing fragrances to complete their character and maintain their \\"front\\" while in the club. Customers rarely, if ever, see the preparation of these props, since they are denied access to the backstage of a dancer's performance space by the layout of the club. A customer often wants a dancer to \\"drop the act\\", which makes them feel special and desired. This girlfriend experience can involve increased intimacy up to and including sex acts. Dancers are commonly aware of this customer desire for increased confidence, and may allow the impression that a customer is seeing their true selves. In reality, it is often just part of the act with little to no emotional attachment for the dancer.  Cultural norms and policies  Exterior of Adelita Bar, in alt=refer to caption Rules governing strip clubs and the overall adult entertainment industry vary around the world and formats sometimes are combined under a single roof or complex. In Bangkok, Thailand, the Nana Entertainment Plaza in downtown Bangkok is a large, four-floor compound with over 40 bars. Most of the bars are go-go bars with dancers in various stages of nudity. They are not formal brothels, since customers must negotiate without an intermediary, directly with the dancers, for services up to and including sex. Zürich, Switzerland has legalized prostitution and its strip clubs throughout the city offer sex among their services. Differing from Zurich brothels, sex services via the strip clubs are typically performed off site. Eastern European strip clubs have a similar model. A .34 square kilometer \\"sex zone\\" in Tokyo, Japan had approximately 3,500 sex facilities as of 1999. These included strip theaters, peep shows, \\"soaplands\\", \\"lover's banks\\", porno shops, telephone clubs, karaoke bars, clubs and more all offering adult entertainment services. In Dubai, a nation governed by very strict cultural norms and laws, there are several Indian strip clubs offering at least partial nudity. Dancers may tie their state of undress to the number of songs played. This could correspond to a bikini performance for song one and topless for the second. In a fully nude club, the sequence could be topless-to-nude over two songs, or any one of a number of other variations. In the United States, clubs are classified based on typical performances, zoning regulations, and advertised services. Zoning regulations in the U.S. can prove a challenge, with clubs needing to be a certain distance away from schools and other areas where minor children are known to congregate. These restrictions are meant, ostensibly, to curb exposure to activities that could negatively impact social development of children and to protect nearby real estate properties not tied to the industry from devaluation. These are known as \\"secondary effects\\". The validity of secondary effects has been disputed, with the counterargument that clubs have been forced through zoning into \\"seedy neighborhoods\\". Elsewhere in North America, the Zona Norte red light district in Tijuana, Mexico has a number of legal brothels which are modeled on strip clubs and feature U.S.-style striptease performed by its prostitutes.  Facilities  Gentlemans ClubGentlemans Club Helsinki in Punavuori, Helsinki, Finland Performer on the main stage of Monty's Showroom Pub at alt=refer to caption Most strip clubs are located in buildings that are converted bars, restaurants, or warehouses, or had industrial uses. The original layout of the building will affect the physical layout of a club. The more money that has been invested in a facility, the more it resembles a dedicated club. Regardless of the floorplan, as interactive theater, there are features every strip club will have. They include: performers (strippers), a floor area where the customers will congregate, and some form of staging for the striptease performance. Higher-end gentlemen's clubs have features that cost millions of dollars to install and maintain. = General admission areas = The floor area is open for general admission. A customer is free to wander around the club, except for employee areas and premium lounges. To access premium lounges (sometimes called VIP, champagne, other lounges), a customer would normally be charged a fee above the cover charge. In some cases, the employee and premium lounges are dual use. For example, a manager's office might also double as the VIP room. All clubs are configured differently. A small club can have a single room, with an improvised stage for the striptease show. Many clubs have more than the basic amenities. Larger clubs have clearer designations of areas. The different areas within a club could be separated by a physical step, built-in railing, platforms and levels, doorways, distinct rooms, and entirely separate floors, and they can also be formed by different carpeting, placement of seating, or physical implements such as a rope or other physical marker.  Floor and seating  Customers seated by the tip rail at Club Live in alt=refer to caption Most entertainment takes place in the main floor area, and this is where performers and staff can interact with patrons. Customers get comfortable in this area and from their observations, they decide which club services they will use. The main stage is visible from the main floor, and the main bar is accessible, if one is present. Patrons can usually select from open seating and some clubs will have staff to assist with seating. If premium seating is provided, club staff will usually manage access to those areas. Depending on the day, time and staffing levels, accessibility of the general admission areas may vary. Larger clubs will rope off or otherwise close sections of the club to customers unless the size of the crowd warrants use of the space. Larger clubs could have multiple floor, bar, seating, and staging areas which are managed in a similar manner.  Main stage  A main stage is where a featured performer will dance as part of a rotation. In most clubs the main stage is a dominant feature of the layout and the center of activity. A common type of strip club main stage is the thrust stage, also known as a runway stage, but the other major forms are also used regularly. Theatre in the round is also a popular form of strip club staging for the main stage. During each set of one or more songs, the current performer will dance on stage. A dancer collects tips from customers either while on stage or while mingling with the audience after her performance. A customary tip (where customers can do so at the stage) is a dollar bill folded lengthwise and placed in the dancer's garter from the tip rail. The area of the tip rail is equivalent to the apron in traditional theatre. It is referred to in slang as \\"ringside\\", \\"gynecology row\\", \\"pervert row\\", and other names. Many stages have actual railing built on or around the stage to function as the tip railing, in addition to indicating where customers should position themselves relative to the performance zone. Customers take turns tipping the dancer. They may also line up to tip popular performers. If physical railing is not present, the tip rail is the edge of stage or defined performance area. Other common tip methods are to insert the dollar into the stripper's cleavage from the hand or mouth, to simply place it or toss it on stage, or to crumple bills into a ball shape and throw them in the entertainer's direction. Each club and dancer has different tolerance levels for customer interaction, including tipping. Some clubs have multiple stages on the premises. Tipping etiquette varies between countries and cultures. In Eastern European and Asian clubs it is customary to agree on payment upfront for a certain amount of time or dances, for stage performances and any private sessions.  Optional staging  Satellite staging includes one or more areas where a stripper can perform other than a main stage and private dances. Larger clubs can have elaborate staging layouts with multiple stage areas distributed around a club and multiple dancers rotating between them per song. Some strip clubs consider ad-hoc performances on satellite stages, paid for by a customer on a per song basis, a form of private dance. Rules at the satellite stages on the main floor tend to be the same as the main stage. In some cases, the layout is significantly different allowing more or less access to the customer. If a satellite stage is located in a premium access zone, access to the dancer could be considerably greater since the higher level of service can include a less restrictive policy than enforced on the main floor. Lap dance, peep show, and lingerie modeling clubs might only have satellite stages with pay to play entertainment options on their premises. Novelty acts (such as shower shows, fire shows, and oil wrestling) can be presented on dedicated stages, temporary staging on the floor, or on the main stage itself depending on the club. The main stage, if used, must be prepared and possibly covered to prevent damage, as accidents and injuries have been reported during these types of striptease performances. When dangerous materials such as fire are used as props a permit may be required to be compliant with local ordinances. Novelty acts are typically performed by feature dancers or by select house dancers during a featured performance. Shower shows require special equipment, so they are more likely to have a dedicated stage in the club with house dancers performing in the show. Optional staging can be present on the main floor or in dedicated rooms throughout larger clubs.  Bars and counters  The main bar of alt=refer to caption A full bar is the primary service mechanism for clubs that offer alcoholic beverages. In many clubs the main bar is the second most dominant element on the floor after the main stage, and in some cases the main (or satellite) stage is built into the bar. Clubs can derive large percentages of their income from drink purchases. For both Rick's Cabaret and VCGH, Inc., service revenues were the single largest revenue source, with sales of alcoholic beverages second. VCGH earned 18% more and RICK 27.5% more in service revenue than alcohol sales. The amounts are closer when food and merchandise sales are considered, with RICK reporting a smaller gap between the two revenue sources relative to VCGH. Upscale clubs that offer food can have free-standing or built-in bars for buffet service. Otherwise, food orders might be taken at the main bar or by waitstaff. Consumption of alcohol is often facilitated via direct sales in strip clubs where such sales are legal, appropriately zoned, and licensed. Some clubs that are not licensed to serve alcohol will work around the restriction by implementing a bring your own beverage (BYOB) policy and a juice bar. Juice bars have the appointments of full bars but only serve non-alcoholic beverages such as water, fruit juice, and flavored carbonated beverages. Such a bar could double as a service counter for the storage of BYOB material and offer ice and mixing services to create mixed drinks using the customer-purchased ingredients. Where waitstaff are present, they may serve as an extension of the bar service; providing and refreshing drinks while maintaining the cleanliness of the seating areas.  Other floor areas  Many clubs have a lobby area where the cover charge, if any, is collected by a doorman or doorwoman and security personnel can do a quick check of prospective customers as they enter the facility. Games are also a common feature of strip clubs. Arcade and gambling machines are popular features, as are pool tables. Some clubs also have dedicated areas of the main floor dedicated to performing private dance services. = Premium access zones = Access to certain parts of a strip club can require payment of an additional fee, or can be by invitation. These areas offer features that are not present in the general admission areas. This approach might allow a club to offer different types and standards of services in the various areas, or to comply with local laws. In this setting, VIPs such as high rollers or persons of a wider popular celebrity, may receive complimentary services according to their reputation with the club personnel. VIP seating adjacent to the main floor is often more comfortable. For example, arm chairs or couches may be provided, and may include booths with service tables. The area typically has a clear line of sight to the main stage. Reserve seating gives a customer a sense of importance and demonstrates prestige. In higher-end clubs, VIP seating might include balconies and other overlooks, which might also include smaller stages for a private dance if the customer wishes, at an additional fee. VIP seating can also act as lap dance booths, where a higher lap dance price would apply than in the general area. VIP rooms are partitioned areas in a club that are typically enclosed by fixed walls and can have doors that close completely. For such rooms that do not offer solid doors, there is usually some type of system to screen the room from view with stringed beads, curtains, or other devices. Couch rooms, private dance rooms, and lounges are also forms of VIP zones. VIP rooms have seating that is more plush than the general admission zones and the VIP seating adjacent to the main floor. Often, purchase of access to the room includes customer time with the dancer(s) of their choice. Some rooms are outfitted with props and appliances, such as showers, hot tubs, and various types of bedding. A champagne room (also called a champagne lounge, or champagne court) is a specialized VIP Room service offered by gentlemen's clubs where a customer can purchase time (usually in half-hour increments) with an exotic dancer in a private room on the premises. Depending on the quality of the club, these rooms, which are typically away from the hustle and bustle of the main club, are generally well decorated and usually appointed with a private bar. Clubs sell champagne by the glass or by the bottle for both the dancer and the customer. Some clubs also offer food and/or cigar service. News media outlets have reported incidents of champagne room charges into the tens and hundreds of thousands of U.S. dollars for a single visit. = Limited access zones = Portions of the club used only for the operation and maintenance typically have access restricted to staff and performers. These include (but are not limited to) management offices, employee booths, performer dressing rooms, and service areas, such as the kitchen and behind the bar. This business practice does not differ significantly from what is seen in other customer service businesses such as retail stores and restaurants. More frequently seen are entry booths, where security staff monitor customers entering and leaving the club and collect the cover charge, and the DJ booth, where the DJ operates. The DJ booth contains sound, lighting, and other equipment which is used to \\"orchestrate the crowd\\" by adjusting the club environment, and is equivalent to a control room in a traditional theater. Dancers use dressing rooms to prepare for performances, rest between performances, and stow any of their belongings not secured by other means. It is customary for disputes between club personnel to be handled off the floor and out of sight of patrons. Dressing rooms are commonly used for performer-only mediation, though this could shift into other areas of discussion if management is involved. Clubs are experimenting with granting greater access to restricted areas via technology. The service includes a live view into part of the backstage dressing room and paid access enables the website user to interact live with dancers at the club. Security of club assets and personnel are a primary driver for limiting access to these zones. If surveillance equipment for the club and grounds is present on site, the monitoring locations for the audio/video feeds will be directed to management. In less frequent cases such feeds could also be accessed from off-site.  Performers and staff  = Performers = alt=refer to caption Performers are called strippers, exotic dancers, just dancers, or entertainers. Strippers are the primary draw for any club. Dancers effectively entertaining customers are the key to generating revenue by keeping customers on site and enticing them to be repeat visitors. The image of strippers (as known today) evolved through the late 1960s and 1970s in the U.S. and international cultures that embraced Americanized striptease; introduced into popular culture by the genre-defining performances of Carol Doda. By the 1980s, the pole dancing and highly explicit imagery associated with today's performers was widely accepted and frequently portrayed in film, television, and theater. House dancers work for a particular club or franchise. Feature dancers tend to have their own celebrity, touring a club circuit and making appearances. Porn stars will often become feature dancers to earn extra income and build their fan base. High-profile adult film performers Jenna Haze and Teagan Presley, among others, have participated in feature shows through the U.S., as did now- retired stars such as Jenna Jameson.  Work environments  In some localities strippers are required to obtain permits to work in adult entertainment. During a bikini performance, both breasts and genital areas typically remain covered by revealing attire, while dancers provide services and entertainment. Go-go dancers will retain their tops and bottoms for the duration of their performance. A female stripper whose upper body is exposed, but whose genital areas remain obscured during a performance, is said to be topless. Strippers who uncover the genital areas along with other clothing during a performance are said to be dancing fully nude. The fully nude practice is banned in many jurisdictions, but many dancers work around these constraints by selective uncovering of the vulva, anus, or both, for short periods of time, followed by immediate replacement of the clothing. Not all strippers are comfortable dancing topless or fully nude. Strippers can sometimes be contracted for performances outside the strip club environment. Strippers with ready access to the Internet away from work have also adopted social media and networks as a less intrusive way of maintaining direct connections with customers. Others use the internet to generate revenue by performing via webcam, recording premium content, or running their own subscriber-based web site. Online erotic content is pervasive and generally classified as pornography. Much like activities inside the club, different dancers have different comfort levels for services they provide during private parties. Aside from advertising for striptease services outside the club, an unknown percentage of strippers also work in other aspects of the sex industry. This can include erotic and nude modeling, pornography, escorting, and in some cases prostitution. Outside the U.S., the use of strip clubs to facilitate sex-for-hire is much more common and stripping in those settings is viewed as advertising for sexually oriented business that will be performed in either private areas of the club or off-premises.  Social interaction  Research suggests that exotic dancing can pay well, but often at significant cost to the stripper. One reason for this is the negative stigma associated with exotic dancing. Not all dancers are affected equally. Some dancers manage this stigma by dividing \\"the social world\\" and only revealing part of their identity. By revealing only a part of themselves, strippers may avoid being characterized by the stigmatizing attributes associated with exotic dancing. Outside the club, dancers are indistinguishable by appearance from the general population and no more likely to be the targets of acts like violent crime than are other women. Inside the club, personal boundaries are frequently crossed between strippers, customers, and other club staff. Research indicates that at some point every dancer has felt exploited by customers, management, or other dancers. The most common complaint from dancers is being portrayed as an object or instrument, rather than as a person. While dancers feel this exploitation and are affected by it, they also admit that they exploit their customers. = Primary staff = Additional club staff almost always includes a club manager, as dancer-run clubs are rare. One or more managers are responsible for day-to-day operations on behalf of the club owner. Managerial responsibilities include money handling, inventory, and hiring and firing of employee staff and contractors. The manager role can be split between a general manager and one or more floor managers. If a bar is present, one or more dedicated bartenders might be employed to assist customers by preparing their drinks or by storing drinks that customers bring into BYOB clubs. In some localities bartenders are required to have an individual permit to serve alcohol. House moms monitor dancers on behalf of the management. A house mom can be particularly beneficial where staff is otherwise male, given her potential to relate to female dancers in a way that male members of staff may not be able to. Not every club will have a house mom. bouncer in front of Centrefolds Lounge Gentlemen's Club on King Street, Melbourne Australia Bouncers are security personnel. They are typically relatively large and physically strong males, who enforce club policy and maintain order in and around the premises. In some cases, on-duty law enforcement may be on site if a club is viewed by authorities as a location with a high enough crime risk. More commonly, privately hired security (including off-duty police) are contracted to guard the premises. Bouncers can also double as doormen or disc jockeys (DJs); serving as hosts and maintaining the flow of entertainment and even cuing music for the dance sets. Where a DJ is not present, music may be provided via either a jukebox or sometimes live musicians. = Ancillary staff = Strip clubs have a variety of configurations and staffing needs. Some clubs employ a host to emcee the show, in addition to a DJ. Hosts are more common in busier clubs or shifts, and during special, such as amateur night and featured acts. If the club charges a fee for entry, specialized personnel may work the door to collect the cover. A common practice is to employ young women, which are known in the industry as door girls, for this function. In certain areas, doormen working outside the strip club will act as \\"hype men\\" enticing people to enter and sample the show and services. The Block in Baltimore, Maryland has aggressive doormen stationed at nearly every entrance, only feet apart in a highly concentrated area of clubs. Broadway in San Francisco, California has fewer clubs clustered together, but practices similar activities with their doormen. Waitstaff are also employed to assist with providing drinks, and in some cases meals, to customers on the main floor and others areas of the club. Shooter girls are specialized waitstaff that carry pre-prepared drinks in shot glasses, that customers can conveniently purchase. Depending on the local ordinances, these shots may involve some erotic part of the body of the shooter girl, typically her cleavage, in the delivery. If a club has a policy of setting a drink minimum per visit or per hour, the floor staff also assists in enforcing those rules. Dancers may also be required to generate a certain number of drink purchases per shift and as part of their rounds, the waitstaff may ask customers if they would like to buy a drink for the dancer seated with them. If a kitchen is present and if premium fare is offered, the club may also employ a chef to prepare and cook food items. Parking lot attendants can include people who simply coordinate where to park and how much to pay or they may also include formal valets, who will park a vehicle and keep track of the driver's keys while he or she is in the club. Some clubs require paid or valet parking to be used if keeping cars on the premises, to generate revenue and help regulate patron behavior. Bathroom attendants monitor the restrooms on behalf of management; primarily watching for policy violations and potential liability concerns. In strip clubs, policy enforcement can range from watching for drug use, sex, fighting, and other activities the club would prefer to see done off the premises. The attendant will also attempt to keep the restroom area clean, assist with the washing of hands, and if available, provide by request an assortment of cologne, mints, and other disposable items.  Business and operations  As a global industry, strip clubs are booming. As of 2009, there were between 3,500 and 4,000 strip clubs in the United States alone. More money is spent in the U.S. in strip clubs than is spent on theater, opera, ballet, jazz and classical music concerts combined. Some clubs have hundreds of entertainers appear on stage within a single year.\\"City plans crackdown on some sex businesses\\" – Houston Chronicle, 2007 = Global industry = Neon \\"Girls Girls Girls\\" sign on the front of club Burlesque with nude dancers in outline (North Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, U.S.) The U.S. and international markets for clubs offering Americanized striptease are not well defined and published revenue figures are estimates. In 2002, the size of the U.S. industry was estimated to be US$3.1 billion, spanning 2,500 clubs and generating 19% of the total gross in legal adult entertainment revenue. The U.S. market for strip clubs was estimated to be as large as US$15 billion in 2005. That same year the U.S. state of California alone accounted for US$1 billion in revenue, and the total size of the global strip club industry was estimated to be US$75 billion. Also, in 2005, an estimated 300,000 women worked as strippers in the U.S., across 3,000 clubs. An industry insider in 2008 estimated the U.S. strip club market at close to US$2 billion, basing that estimate on Adult Video News Media Network (AVN) statistics and highlighting both the methodological variances of different studies and the difficulties of providing reliable statistics on the industry. Since then, the number of clubs in the U.S. has grown to approximately 4,000 by 2010. In Britain the number of strip clubs rose over 1,000 percent between 1997 and 2010. In 2008 alone, a strip club opened there almost every week. One factor in the proliferation of British strip clubs is Britain's 2003 Licensing Act, which introduced the one-size-fits-all premises licence, which meant that strip clubs in Britain no longer had to receive special permission for nudity. In 2005, revenues for the UK strip club industry, one of the fastest growing sectors of its leisure industry, were estimated to be UK£300 million. Revenues for 2006 in Scotland alone accounted for UK£20 million of the UK total.  Markets and ownership  American-style striptease, closely associated with contemporary clubs around the world, began to appear outside North America in the post-World War II era, emerging in Asian performances during the late 1940s and in European theaters by 1950. A contemporary example, the American Spearmint Rhino chain, has clubs located in the UK, Russia, and Australia, as well as the United States. In 2003, the company's London location reportedly made UK£3 per minute. Strip clubs offering American striptease and other adult entertainment services have been established on six of seven continents (all except Antarctica), and the demand for these types of business is soaring in economically developing nations. Most adult entertainment companies, which include strip clubs, are in privately held ownership. Two strip club companies are publicly traded in U.S. financial markets and listed on NASDAQ: VCG Holding Corp. (VCGH) and RCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc. (RICK). In February 2010, the two clubs agreed in principle to merge, with Rick's Cabaret acquiring VCG Holding. The estimated purchase price, according to the statement of intent, was for the acquisition using RICK stock to be at a value of US$2.20 to US$3.80 per share. The US$45 million deal fell through after the statement of intent expired on March 31, 2010, with Rick's Cabaret unable to enter into a definitive merger agreement to acquire all of VCG's outstanding stock. A third publicly traded company, Scores Holding Company, Inc. (SCRH), licenses its brand to strip club operators but does not own or operate any club properties itself. Publicly reported earning statements for U.S. companies operating strip clubs have not provided guidance on how they define their market segment, non-public competitors, or overall industry revenue. The largest operator of strip clubs internationally is Déjà Vu, which has over 130 locations worldwide.  Financial trends  alt=refer to caption The rapid expansion of the strip club industry observed in the 2000s occurred primarily in the Western world. Far from its heyday in the 1980s and 1990s, Japan's sex industry has been in a protracted slump in the first decade of the 21st century, as the overall economy experienced a recession. Its hostess and strip bars (those which had not closed outright) felt the impact of dwindling corporate spending accounts, leading to increased competition (and reduced boundaries) for remaining patrons. Profitability of strip clubs, as with other service-oriented businesses, is largely driven by location and customer spending habits. Clubs closely proximate to Wall Street in New York, New York are notorious for hosting meetings with financial industry power brokers, among other business heavyweights, which are frequently expensed on company bankrolls. Since clubs located in urban areas or business centers have caused concerns over traffic and social issues, some club owners with common interests in close proximity have shared representation without consolidating their businesses. After numerous incidents during the 1990s with local and state government, Downtown Entertainment Inc. was formed in 2000 to represent the interests of business owners on The Block in Baltimore, Maryland. Strip clubs which practice Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) typically report negative working capital, where current liabilities exceed current assets. Clubs receive immediate cash payment for sales, while inventories, accrued expenses, and other current liabilities normally carry longer payment terms. The practice is believed to increase net cash provided by operating activities. Service revenues include entertainer payments to perform at clubs, customer admission fees, customer payments for tabs and tip charges, dance dollar payments, and suite rental fees. The economic downturn, which accelerated in 2008, impacted clubs at all levels, and even higher-end gentlemen's clubs in some parts of the U.S. and elsewhere adjusted their business practices to compensate for reduced revenues. = Business practices = Strip clubs can operate at all hours, depending on regulations and revenue. It is a common business practice to have a reduced door charge or no entry fee at all during daytime. Clubs that are open for more than just the nighttime hours may incorporate a staggered or shift work schedule for their entertainers and staff. External factors, such as location and public perception, have some impact on business, but the essential draw of the strip club is the live entertainment. Because of negative perceptions of the adult entertainment industry, many clubs engage in public displays of charity to generate goodwill. VCGH clubs, in order to be good corporate citizens, actively sponsor and participate in local charitable events and contribute to local charities. Some clubs also register their business entities using benign names, so that they appear to be businesses unrelated to the sex industry on receipts and financial statements, and as a means of discretion. Cameras (including camera phones) and other recording devices are often banned from strip clubs to \\"protect the identity of the women working there and to spare the blushes of men caught on film attending the club\\". Among clubs, there is a variety of different ways to deliver entertainment, and fee structures commonly differ between clubs. A cover charge (entry fee also known as a door charge) is customary at many clubs, the amount of which can vary by factors such as day of visit, time of day, gender, and other factors. To make the charge more acceptable to customers, some clubs include bonus items in the admission price, such as drink tickets that can be redeemed once inside. Some clubs also have drink fees tied to interaction with performers. The bigger the drink, the longer the time permitted with the dancer. This practice is more common in European strip clubs and African or Asian hostess clubs. Champagne Room pricing (where time with an exotic dancer in a private room on the premises can be purchased) is a variation on that same theme.  Operations  In the U.S., striptease dancers are generally classified as independent contractors. A few smaller strip clubs may pay a weekly wage but, in most cases, a dancer's income is derived entirely from tips and other fees, which they collect from customers. In most clubs, dancers must pay a \\"stage fee\\" or \\"house fee\\" to work a given shift. In these cases, strippers receive payment in the form of tips and payment for specific services offered by the club (such as lap dances). Many clubs also take a percentage of fees charged for each private dance. It is also customaryand often required in the United Statesfor dancers to pay a \\"tip out\\", usually at the end of their shift, to the supporting staff, such as DJs, house moms, make-up artists, servers, bartenders, and bouncers. This can be a set fee or a percentage of money earned. For the customer, the fee structure of a club is determined by management policy. In many smaller clubs, multiple staff roles are filled by the same person, such as a bartender and manager. In extreme cases, one person fills all the support functions within a club. Some clubs hire attractive women onto the staff, as bartenders and shot girls, to complement the strippers. They can also double as stage and lap dance entertainers, depending on the club. The positions of paid staff are discretionary. Turnover can be frequent, but standard employment laws do apply and have been enforced through the courts and other regulatory means. A highly publicized 2010 case in the United States concerned a pregnant bartender in New York. She alleged that Cafe Royale in Farmingdale, New York discriminated against her because pregnancy is \\"unsexy\\". Hiring of staff and performers in the United States is almost always voluntary on the part of the club and worker. Some strip clubs have hosted job fairs to address staffing needs. While not a common practice in the United States, globally, women are regularly compelled into working as strippers with the knowledge of club management.  Marketing  The ability to attract first-time patrons is critical to a nightclub's success. As such, promotions, advertising, and special offers are the typical means to market a nightclub. Marketing strategies for strip clubs include attracting new customers, increasing the frequency of visits by existing customers, and establishing a higher level of name recognition. Target markets can include the business-convention traveler, local professionals, and business people. College students are also a secondary target market. Advertising is essential for strip clubs, but local regulations and public reaction can make it challenging. For this reason, clubs around the world advertise on the World Wide Web. Advertising can include discount passes, virtual club tours, and dancer schedules. U.S. company VCGH, Inc. uses a variety of highly targeted methods to reach its customers, including local radio, billboard trucks, Internet, newspaper and magazine advertisements, and professional sporting events. Its advertising and marketing expenses decreased by approximately 3.9% to US$2,805,260 from US$2,921,327 over the year ended December 31, 2008. Advertising and marketing expenses were approximately 5.1% of their total revenues in 2009 and 2008. The decrease was attributed to a shift in advertising, including using billboard trucks for mobile advertising versus leasing fixed billboard signs. By contrast, in public filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Rick's Cabaret International reported an increase in its advertising budget from US$2,231,005 in 2008 to US$8,091,745 in 2009, growing from 3.9% to 10.8% of total annual revenue. In the U.S. city of Seattle, Washington, the city's Major League Baseball franchise, the Seattle Mariners, initially sued in King County Superior Court to try to prevent Dreamgirls cabaret from opening. The team's attorneys argued that the strip club's existence would adversely affect families that visit the stadium. The suit was dropped after the Mariners reached a compromise which included limits on outdoor advertising, window displays, and signs. The compromise specified that the clubs video screens would only show text on kids days at the stadium, and not images of strippers. In May 2010, there was public controversy because the club showed strippers on its large electronic display on \\"kids' day\\". Dreamgirls claimed that it is the team's responsibility to tell them when such a display is prohibited. Elite Cabaret, a Tempe city strip club, filed suit in 2007 against the City of Tempe in federal court. In the settlement that was reached, the two sides ended the legal wrangle amidst a host of stipulations. One clause is aimed at preventing the racy image promoted by strip clubs. The club is not allowed to depict the human body on the exterior of its building. Signs cannot say \\"nude\\", \\"topless\\", \\"girls\\" or similar words. The sign can only have the bar's name and terms like \\"cabaret\\" or \\"gentlemen's club\\". Strip club advertising and its associated controversy are not limited to the United States. In South Africa, well-known strip club chain Teazers generated media coverage and official complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority of South Africa (ASA) over its suggestive billboards.  Law and politics  The legal status of strip clubs has evolved over the course of time, with national and local laws becoming progressively more liberal on the issue around the world, although some countries (such as Iceland) have implemented strict limits and bans. Strip clubs are frequent targets of litigation around the world, and the sex industry, which includes strip clubs, is a hot button issue in popular culture and politics. Some clubs have been linked to organized crime, which has been known to use legitimate business as fronts for its illegal operations. = United States and the Americas = With the legal system of the U.S. based on common law, motivations for lawsuits can range from legitimate legal grounds to cases filed with the intent of shaping case law to favor the socio- political aims of special interest groups. Clubs around the country have personnel and clientele that are purported to engage in not only sex acts on the premises, but also drug use and other criminalized activities. Incidents of such activity vary widely. Their prevalence is dependent on regional differences in the attitudes of management, entertainers, customers, and law enforcement. Strip clubs are obligated to enforce age limits for entry to the clubs and consumption of alcohol. If a club is found to have served a person under the age of 21 alcohol it can have its liquor license suspended or rescinded for repeated violations. Licenses can also be lost due to evidence of drug use in the club. Club owners have closed their businesses as a result of losing a liquor license. A widely cited U.S. local ordinance is San Diego (California) Municipal Code 33.3610, specific and strict in response to allegations of corruption among local officials, which included contacts in the nude entertainment industry. Among its provisions is the \\"six-foot rule\\", copied by other municipalities in requiring that dancers maintain a six-foot distance from patrons while performing. Fully nude clubs may be subject to additional requirements, such as restrictions on alcohol sales and no-touch rules between customers and dancers.Nude Dancing (from the First Amendment Center website) To circumvent these rules, two \\"separate\\" barsone topless and one fully nudemay open adjacent to one another. In a small number of states and jurisdictions where it is legal for alcohol to be consumed but not sold, some clubs still allow customers to bring their own beverages. Still other rules forbid \\"full nudity\\" in certain districts, which can vary among different areas within the same town. Some parts of the U.S. have laws forbidding the exposure of female nipples or even areolas, thus requiring female dancers to cover these with pasties. These laws are not, however, known to be applied to the exposure of male nipples. Managers, dancers, and other club workers can be cited or arrested by local or federal authorities for violating nudity, drug, and other violations. In February 2010, the U.S. city of Detroit, Michigan banned fully exposed breasts in its strip clubs, following the example of Houston, Texas, which began enforcing a similar ordinance in 2008. The Detroit city council has since softened the rules; eliminating the requirement for pasties but keeping other restrictions. Both municipalities were reputed to have suffered rampant occurrences of illicit activities, including prostitution, all linked to striptease establishments within their cities' limits. Detroit has also drawn attention from the federal government for incidents of human trafficking in its strip clubs. In 2010, the state of Missouri passed a law similar to that of Houston and Detroit, banning full nudity in strip clubs across the state. Strip clubs have also received attention in the Americas outside the United States. There have been several attempts to amend the Canadian Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), passed in 2001. The 2009 version of the bill (Bill C-45: An Act to amend the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act) contained provisions intended to tighten the issuing of visas to exotic dancers, to combat human trafficking. In August 2009, the city of Rio de Janeiro, while bidding for the 2014 World Cup, shut down one of its most notorious clubs, the Help discothèque. There were plans to bulldoze the club and \\"replace it with a music-themed museum\\" with US firm Diller Scofidio + Renfro as architects, backed by Rio's governor Sergio Cabral who was also backing the 2016 Summer Olympics bid. In November 2009, officials in Rio de Janeiro threatened to sue American comedian Robin Williams for disparaging comments made on a late-night talk show. One of his comments on its Olympics bid, \\"Rio sent 50 strippers and a pound of blow. It wasn't really fair, you know?\\" was replayed several times on news shows in Brazil and prompted a public response from its mayor. The Olympic Committee for Rio had its lawyers investigate whether there were grounds for a lawsuit, but no charges were filed. = United Kingdom = In 2009, the United Kingdom passed the Policing and Crime Act following concerns about an increase in the number of strip clubs in the country. Any strip clubs where live entertainment takes place more than 11 times a year must apply for a sexual entertainment venue licence from their local authorities. Such clubs are routinely opposed by those who feel that these 'lower the tone' of particular neighbourhoods. The legislation caused a reduction in the number of relevant premises, from about 350 in the early 2000s to fewer than 200, across the UK. In 2014, the East London Strippers Collective was formed to improve working conditions in strip clubs. Their concerns included poorly-maintained working environments, exploitative business practises including the levying of fees, commission and fines, and a lack of employment protection and job security. = Rest of Europe = The Irish government had, at one time, special visa categories for 'entertainers,' which enabled the trafficking of women for strip clubs and prostitution. In 2001, the former immigration chief in Cyprus was found guilty of accepting bribes to issue work permits to foreign women (in this case from Ukraine), to work as strippers in clubs, with some forced into prostitution. Throughout the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, and the Netherlands, studies have shown that Russian individuals and organized crime groups are importing women from Russia, Ukraine, the Baltic States, and Central Europe into the Russian sex industry to work in stripping, prostitution, peep and show club services, and massage and escort services, among others. In March 2010, Iceland outlawed striptease. Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir, Iceland's prime minister, said: \\"The Nordic countries are leading the way on women's equality, recognizing women as equal citizens rather than commodities for sale.\\" The politician behind the bill, Kolbrún Halldórsdóttir, said: \\"It is not acceptable that women or people in general are a product to be sold.\\" = Rest of the world = Outside the United States, views on strip clubs, and on sexuality in general, can be much more liberal. American striptease, though present, can be treated much differently. Activities which are not legal in most parts of the United States or its territories may be permitted in other parts of the world. Also, ties to criminal elements (as defined by international law) can be much more pronounced. In Eastern Europe and Asia, common incidents of strip club crime involve customers being quoted a price upon entering a club, only to find out later that management expects a much higher payment before customers are permitted to leave. Intimidation and possibly the threat of violence are used to compel customers to comply. The Japanese government, similar to Canada and Ireland, had special visa categories for \\"entertainers\\". These enabled the trafficking of women for strip clubs and prostitution. In South Africa, there has been public controversy over incidents of prostitution and violence related to its strip clubs. In June 2010, 17 customers were arrested, during a raid at a strip club in Cape Town, for committing unspecified illegal acts. 35 Eastern European dancers were also arrested for working at the club without the correct documents. In 2008, the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research in Sydney, Australia reported 1,600 people were charged with committing a range of 27 criminal offenses in the state's \\"places of worship\\". Oddly, the figures showed only 282 people were charged with the same offenses in premises classified as adult entertainment establishments. A breakdown of the statistical figures showed that 85 people were assaulted in places of worship, compared to 66 at adult entertainment locations. Incidents of both sexual assault and harassing and threatening behavior were also greater at places of worship. The report included churches, synagogues, monasteries, mosques, convents, cathedrals and chapels as places of worship. Premises listed as adult entertainment sites included strip clubs, sex shops, brothels, massage parlors, gay clubs, gaming houses, and gambling clubs. The bureau's interpretation was that people were just as likely to be assaulted or robbed in the sanctity of a church as they were in sex industry venues.  Cultural impact  The New York Dolls strip club played a prominent role in the Park51 controversy. The strip club as an outlet for salacious entertainment is a recurrent theme in popular culture. In the media, clubs are portrayed primarily as gathering places of vice and ill repute. Both clubs themselves and various features of the business are highlighted in these references. Comedian Chris Rock also pokes fun at the champagne room in his spoken word track, \\"No Sex (In the Champagne Room)\\", on his 1999 album, Bigger & Blacker. Wyclef Jean later noted Rock's comment in his own reflection on strippers, \\"Perfect Gentleman\\". In 2016, rapper Shawty Lo's funeral procession stopped at his favorite strip club, The Blue Flame Lounge in Atlanta, where patrons and mourners honored his casket with a moment of silence. = Film, television, and theater = The image of strippers as known today evolved through the late 1960s and 1970s in the U.S. and in international cultures which embraced American striptease. By the 1980s, the pole dancing and highly explicit imagery associated with today's performers was widely accepted and frequently portrayed in film, television, and theater.  1980s–1990s  In addition to lesser-known videos such as A Night at the Revuebar (1983), the 1980s also featured mainstream films involving strippers and their work as part of the central narrative. These included Flashdance (1983), which told the story of blue-collar worker Alexandra (Alex) Owens (Jennifer Beals), who works as an exotic dancer in a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, bar at night and at a steel mill as a welder during the day. Blaze (1989) features Lolita Davidovitch as notorious stripper Blaze Starr. Starr herself appears in the film in a cameo role. Exotica (1994), directed by Atom Egoyan, is set in a Canadian lap-dance club, and portrays a man's (Bruce Greenwood) obsession with a schoolgirl stripper named Christina (Mia Kirshner). Showgirls (1995) was directed by Paul Verhoeven and starred Elizabeth Berkley and Gina Gershon. Striptease (1996), was an adaptation of the novel starring Demi Moore. The Players Club (1998) starred LisaRaye as a girl who becomes a stripper to earn enough money to enter college and study journalism. In Jekyll and Hyde (1997), the character of Lucy Harris (originally portrayed by Linda Eder) works as a prostitute and stripper in a small London club called The Red Rat, where she meets a multi- dimension man named Doctor Henry Jekyll, who turns into his evil persona Mr. Edward Hyde. Lucy performs the song 'Bring on the Men' during a show at the Red Rat (which was later replaced with 'Good 'n' Evil' in the Broadway production, some claiming 'Bring on the Men' was too 'risqué'.). In Neighbours (1985), the character of Daphne is originally a stripper at Des's bucks party, and eventually goes on to marry him. Married... with Children (1987–97) often featured Al Bundy, Jefferson D'Arcy, and the NO MA'AM crew spending a night at the Nudie Bar. In the six season of The Sopranos (1999–2007), business was often conducted at the Bada Bing strip club.  2000s–present  By the 2000s, visits to strip clubs by characters in action movies were a common occurrence. Dancing at the Blue Iguana (2000) is a feature film starring Daryl Hannah. The female cast of the film researched the film by dancing at strip clubs and created their parts and their storylines to be as realistic as possible. The Raymond Revuebar the Art of Striptease (2002) is a documentary, directed by Simon Weitzman. Los Debutantes (2003) is a Chilean film set in a strip-club in Santiago. Portraits of a Naked Lady Dancer (2004) is a documentary, directed by Deborah Rowe. In Closer (2004), Natalie Portman plays Alice, a young stripper just arrived in London from America. Crazy Horse Le Show (2004) features dance routines from the Crazy Horse, Paris. I Know Who Killed Me (2007) stars Lindsay Lohan as Dakota Moss, an alluring stripper involved in the machinations of a serial killer, and features a long striptease sequence at a strip club. In 2009, a DVD called \\"Crazy Horse Paris\\" featuring Dita Von Teese was released. Barely Phyllis is a play on Phyllis Dixey which was first staged at the Pomegranate Theatre, Chesterfield in 2009. A strip club is prominently featured in the film \\"Megean and Andrew go to a Strip Club\\" (2011) in which the title characters go to a strip club. Stripsearch (2001–), an ongoing Australian reality television show which centers around the training of male strippers. In Degrassi: The Next Generation (2007), in the two-part season 6 finale, titled Don't You Want Me, Alex Nunez resorts to stripping after her mother and herself do not have enough money to pay the rent on their apartment. = Notable locations = One of the most famous strip clubs in the U.S. is on Route 17 in Lodi, New Jersey. It was featured on the television show The Sopranos. The club is actually a go-go bar, serving alcohol with dancers, and it does not offer nudity. It is called \\"Satin Dolls\\" in real life, but is known more universally around the world and in the show as \\"The Bada Bing\\". The Gold Club was an Atlanta adult entertainment club receiving national attention for the indictment of several of its owners, managers, and employees. The Gold Club trial received significant attention because numerous significant professional athletes were called to testify. The club was closed after the convictions of its owner plus several managers and employees. Sapphire Gentlemen's Club in Las Vegas has been billed as the world's largest strip club. In 2006 it sold at auction for US$80 million. Tampa, Florida, is well known for its strip clubs, including the famous Mons Venus. Howard Stern, a radio host and television personality, makes frequent mention of 'Rick's Cabaret' which operates in several cities. Bangkok and Pattaya in Thailand are world-famous for their go bars offering a variety of extra services. = Top clubs = Given the variety of club formats and laws governing the operation of strip clubs around the world, a definitive and objective list of top clubs is not practical. The popularity of a given club is an indicator of its quality, as is the word of mouth among customers who have visited a cross section of clubs in different regions. A 2013 article published by the AskMen.com portal posted a list of the top 10 strip clubs in the world. According to their criteria, which included aesthetics, quality of girls, services, and such, the top clubs at the time were: # Playhouse Gentleman's Club, Warsaw # Night Flight, Moscow # Larry Flynt's Hustler Club, New York City # 4 Play Gentlemen's Club, Los Angeles # Spearmint Rhino, Las Vegas # Le Crazy Horse, Paris # Seventh Heaven, Tokyo # Temptations, Bristol # Wanda's, Montreal # K5 Relax, Prague U.S. style striptease remains a global phenomenon and culturally accepted form of entertainment, despite its scrutiny in legal circles and popular media. Over half of clubs still open from the list are located outside the United States. Popular internet sites for strip club enthusiasts also have Top Club lists calculated from input from their online visitors. The Ultimate Strip Club List has a Top 100 Strip Clubs list, generated by analyzing the ratings for all of its clubs as entered by individual reviewers. Its list regularly includes strip clubs from outside the U.S. and the site details clubs from countries across six continents. The Strip Club Network, calculates its online Strip Club List: Top 100 Clubs, by the total number of views that each club information page has received on their website.

In 2013, Sathyu featured in the popular Google Reunion ad, where he played the role of Yusuf, an elderly Pakistani man who is reunited with his childhood pre-partition friend from India, Baldev (Vishwa Mohan Badola).The commercial went viral on social media. Sathyu is one of the patrons of Indian People's Theatre Association (IPTA). His Play 'Dara Shikoh' is considered a modern classic which was staged by Impresario Asia in Delhi in 2003-4. In the words of noted critic Ramesh Chand Charlie the Stage Play 'Dara Shikoh' is a turning point of traditional theatrical sensibilities. Use of Wali Deccani's period poetry provides this play a very rare artistic and historical context. Dazzling use of Kathak choreography by Rani Khanum and her troupe, and authentic costumes including head gear, swords and period art work were a treat for the eyes. Exemplary use of Sufi music, context and ambiance was very alluring and mesmerising. This play had a good run at cities like Delhi, Gurgaon and Bangalore. There are reports that it is also being made into a Feature Film under the Direction of Sathyu. This play revived interest in the life and ideals of Dara Shikoh. Last, Gopal Gandhi and Pakistan's Ajoka Group also brought Dara Shikoh to life on the stage. Amrita: A Sublime Love Story is another innovative play which is based on the life and writings of famous Punjabi writer Amrita Preetam.

The term was used by John Cleare as the combination of the words \\"mountaineering\\" and \\"coast\\".Concise Oxford English Dictionary, 2011 and was coined separately by Andy Middleton in Wales in 1985, who then made it a business idea. Coasteering may include all or some of the following: *Swimming or Adventure Swimming: in calm water; rough or white water; and/ or tidal currents. Dressing for swimming in the sea (wetsuits, buoyancy aids etc.) is often an integral part of Coasteering; even on routes where it is possible to stay dry. A route, or activity, where the group start out with the intention of staying dry - whether through route choice or the use of ropes and harnesses - would not usually be considered as coasteering but sea level traversing, which is usually a dry pursuit. *Climbing, scrambling, swimming, jumping: the very nature of the coastline that is needed for coasteering demands aspects of these activities. Ropes, as security on rock, are not used. Any climbing activity usually takes place above deep water, with safety spotters used where appropriate. There is a similarity to the sport of deep-water soloing, but this would normally be carried out by experienced individuals not wearing equipment suitable for coasteering. Coasteering is not usually intended as an 'always dry', climbing activity. *Jumping and Diving: are often seen as an appealing and exciting part of coasteering. These activities usually make up minimal content of a coasteering session. A defining factor of coasteering is the opportunity provided by the marine geology for moving in the “impact zone” where water, waves, rocks, gullies, caves etc., come together to provide a very high energy environment. History Although all aspects of coasteering have been informally practised by people for a very long time, if only as a means of access to a cut-off cove beyond a headland, the term appears first to have been used in 1973. In the book Sea Cliff Climbing, John Cleare and Robin Collomb said \\"A few enthusiasts believe that coasteering will become popular and has a big future\\". In 1985, it emerged as a commercially guided recreational activity initially along the cliff coastline of St.Davids in Pembrokeshire in Wales. By the mid 1990s write-ups started appearing in the travel/recreational pages of the newspapers showing that several commercial companies were offering such activity. In 1999, TYF Adventure licensed a trade mark incorporating the word \\"Coasteering\\" in a distinctive script with the intention of creating the highest safety and environmental standards of any outdoor sport. The word was by then in general use to describe the activity and few other operators had much interest in environmental practice. The activity then spread to all regions of the UK where there are suitable rocky coasts, including Cornwall, Pembrokeshire, Anglesey and the Highlands and Isles of Scotland. The advisory organisation for coasteering is the National Coasteering Charter (NCC). In the UK the activity is recognized by the Adventure Activities Licensing Authority which is a department of the Health and Safety Executive. Guided adventure experience The rocky cliff coasts of western Britain provide the world's principal location for organised guided coasteering, where it is available from over 100 activity centres.List of AALA Recognized Providers for Combined Rock and Water Activities Usually half day or one day trips are offered at a variety of levels catering for beginners, intermediates and advanced. Some trips are especially slanted towards study of the coastal ecology. Some centres cater for parties of school children. Adventure races Coasteering may be included as one of the disciplines for a stage of an adventure race. This is especially common in New Zealand, but is also to be found in Australia, Canada, and the USA.

Foster, Director, Department of Research and Engineering, U.S. Department of Defense, April 15, 1970, p. 611. is a very long range, medium-to-high altitude surface-to-air missile (SAM) system designed in the 1960s to defend large areas from bomber attack or other strategic aircraft. Each battalion has 6 single-rail missile launchers for the long missiles and a fire control radar. It can be linked to other, longer-range radar systems.  Description  Two- stage V-400 (5V11) Angara missile of the Dal SAM system in Saint-Petersburg Artillery museum. This was given the name SA-5 \\"Griffon\\" in the west, although it is unrelated to the \\"Gammon\\". The S-200 surface-to-air missile system was designed for the defense of the most important administrative, industrial and military installations from all types of air attack. S-200 provides defeat of modern and advanced aircraft, including air command and control centers, AWACS aircraft, aircraft jamming creation and other manned and unmanned aerial vehicles. The S-200 is an all-weather system that can be operated in various climatic conditions. By 1966, the S-200 was officially accepted into service in order to replace the failed anti-ballistic missile RZ-25/5V11 \\"Dal\\". The Dal was assigned the NATO reporting name SA-5 \\"Griffon\\" before it was cancelled. The first S-200 operational regiments were deployed in 1966 with 18 sites and 342 launchers in service by the end of the year. By 1968 there were 40 sites, and by 1969 there were 60 sites. The growth in numbers then gradually increased throughout the 1970s (1,100 launchers) and early 1980s until the peak of 130 sites and 2,030 launchers was reached in 1980–1990. = Missiles = Each missile is launched by 4 solid-fueled strap-on rocket boosters. After they burn out and drop away (between 3 and 5.1 seconds from launch) it fires a 5D67 liquid fueled sustainer rocket engine (for 51–150 seconds) which burns a fuel called TG-02 Samin (50% xylidine and 50% triethylamine), oxidized by an agent called AK-27P Melange (red fuming nitric acid enriched with nitrogen oxides, phosphoric acid and hydrofluoric acid). Maximum range is between and , depending on the model. The missile uses radio illumination mid-course correction to fly towards the target with a terminal semi-active radar homing phase. Maximum target speed is around Mach 6 for new model and Mach 4 for earlier model. Effective altitude is to for early models and up to for later models. The warhead is either high-explosive fragmentation (16,000 × 2 g fragmentation pellets and 21,000 × 3.5 g pellets) triggered by radar proximity fuse or command signal, or a 25 kt nuclear warhead triggered by command signal only. Each missile weighs around at takeoff. The system utilises radio semi active guidance throughout the missile's flight, which is far more accurate at long range than the command guidance method used by the earlier S-75 Dvina and other missiles. The existence of an optional terminal passive radar homing mode for use against airborne early warning (AEW) aircraft remains unconfirmed. Peak missile speed is around Mach 8 and the single-shot kill probability is quoted as 0.85, presumably against a high altitude bomber-type target. = Main radar system = The fire control radar of the S-200 system is the 5N62 (NATO: Square Pair) H band continuous wave radar, whose range is .

Iranian air defense force has implemented several improvements on their S-200 systems such as using solid state parts and removing restrictions on working time. They destroyed a UAV target beyond 100 km range in military drill in recent years. They use two new solid propellant missile named Sayyad-2 and Sayyad-3 via interface systems Talash-2 and Talash-3 in cooperation with S-200 system. These missiles can cover medium and long ranges at high altitudes. Also, Iran claims to have developed a mobile launcher for the system.  Operational history  =Libya= Starting in 1985, Libya received a number of S-200 missile systems.https://warisboring.com/smoke-em/ In the following months, Libyan forces fired a number of S-200 missiles in different occasions at US fighter-bombers, missing them. In the USSR, three organizations (CDB Almaz, a test site and a research institute of the Ministry of Defense) conducted computer simulation of the battle, which gave the probability of hitting each of the air targets (3) in the range from 96 to 99%. = Syria = Starting in January 1983, Syria received supplies of S-200 missiles from the Soviet Union. They were organized into two long range surface to air missile regiments, each composed of two battalions of two batteries each for a total of at least 24 launchers. Later in the 1980s, the Soviet Union agreed to supply a third regiment increasing the number of launchers to 40–50. Initially the missiles were manned by Soviet crews, later they were transferred to Syrian control. As such, Syria became the first country outside the Soviet Union to field the S-200 system. During the initial years of the Syrian Civil War, parts of the S-200 systems were occasionally spotted when Syrian Air Defense Force sites were overrun by rebel forces. Most notably radars, missiles and other equipment from S-200 systems was pictured in a state of disrepair when rebels overtook the air defense site in Eastern Ghouta in October 2012. On 2 January 2017, the Syrian Army re-captured this air defense base. Starting with the Russian intervention in the civil war in late 2015, there were new efforts to restore some Syrian S-200 systems. Indeed, on 15 November 2016, the Russian defence minister confirmed that Russian forces repaired Syrian S-200s to operational status. For example, in July 2016, the Syrian Army, with Russian assistance, rebuilt an S-200 site at Kweires airport, near Aleppo. On September 12, 2016, the Israel Defense Forces confirmed that two Syrian S-200 missiles were fired at Israeli aircraft while they were on a mission inside Syrian airspace. The Syrian Defense Ministry claimed that an Israeli jet and a drone were shot down. According to the IDF spokesman's office, the claims are \\"total lies,\\" and \\"at no point was the safety of IDF aircraft compromised.\\" On March 17, 2017, the Israeli Air Force attacked a number of Syrian armed forces targets near Palmyria in Syria. Four Israeli aircraft flew through Lebanese territory and launched Popeye stand off missiles with a range of 78 km toward Syrian territory. Syrian Air defence force (SyADF) after some time alerted one S-200V (SA-5) missile battery and tried to retaliate, 2 out of 4 attacking jets were illuminated with two 5N62 Fire Control Radars and missiles were fired on 2 targets, which then were over southern Lebanon. During the action a number of Syrian S-200 missiles were fired at the Israeli aircraft. One of the Syrian missiles, going ballistic after losing its target, was inbound to a populated area in Israel. The Israeli missile defense fired at least one Arrow missile which intercepted the incoming missile. Two other S-200 missiles landed in other parts of Israel, having lost their target. According to ANNA News, Syria claimed that they had shot down one IAF F-16 aircraft and damaged another. While the Syrian Defense Ministry claimed that an Israeli fighter jet was shot down, which was denied by Israel, Israeli defence minister Avigdor Lieberman threatened to destroy Syrian air defence systems after they fired ground-to-air missiles at Israeli warplanes carrying out strikes. The Jordanian armed forces reported that parts of a missile fell in its territory. There were no casualties in Jordan. On October 16, 2017, a Syrian S-200 battery located around 50 kilometers east of Damascus fired a missile at an Israeli Air Force surveillance mission over Lebanon. The IAF responded by attacking the battery and destroying the fire control radar with four bombs. Despite this, the Syrian Defense Ministry said in its statement that the air-defense forces \\"directly hit one of the jets, forcing [Israeli aircraft] to retreat.\\" Israel said that no plane was hit. On February 10, 2018, Israel launched an air strike against targets in Syria with eight fighter aircraft as retaliation for a UAV incursion into Israeli airspace earlier in the day. Syrian air defenses succeeded in shooting down one of the Israeli jets, an F-16I Sufa, with an S-200 missile - this was the first Israeli jet to be shot down in combat since 1982. Critically wounded pilot downed in Syria strike walks out of hospital By TOI STAFF, 18 February 2018 The jet crashed in the Jezreel Valley, near Harduf. Both the pilot and the navigator managed to eject, one was injured lightly and the other was injured more seriously, but both survived and walked out of hospital one week later.Critically yriawounded pilot downed in Syria strike walks out of hospital By TOI STAFF, 18 February 2018 On 10 May 2018, Israeli Air Force launched Operation House of Cards against a number of Iranian and Syrian targets, claiming the destruction of a S-200 radar among different other targets.https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/245725 On September 17, 2018, a Russian Il-20M ELINT plane was shot down by a Syrian S-200 surface-to-air missile. Four Israeli F-16 fighter jets attacked targets in Syria's Latakia with standoff missiles, after approaching from the Mediterranean Sea, a statement by the Russian defense ministry said on 18 September. “The Israeli pilots used the Russian plane as cover and set it up to be targeted by the Syrian air defense forces. As a consequence, the Il-20, which has radar cross-section much larger than the F-16, was shot down by an S-200 system missile,” the statement said. The Russian ministry stressed that the Israelis must have known that the Russian plane was present in the area, which didn't stop them from “the provocation”. Israel also failed to warn Russia about the planned operation in advance. The warning came a minute before the attack started, which “did not leave time to move the Russian plane to a safe area,” the statement said. On 21 September, an Israeli delegation visiting Moscow stated that the Israeli attack formation did not use the Russian Il-20 as a shield during the attacks, while blaming the incident on the Syrian Air Defense Force which fired missiles for forty minutes while the Israeli attack formation had already left the area. Russian President Vladimir Putin downplayed the incident saying that \\"it looks accidental, like a chain of tragic circumstances\\". On 1 July 2019, a stray S-200 missile fired from Syria, presumably during bombing raids there, hit Northern Cyprus. The missile hit the ground around 1 a.m. near the village of Taşkent, also known as Vouno, some 20 kilometers (12 miles) northeast of Nicosia. The missile that hit Cyprus was a Russian-made S-200, said the Turkish Cypriot foreign minister.Missile that hit Northern Cyprus Russian-made S-200 fired from Syria, foreign minister says DAILY SABAH WITH REUTERS, 01.07.2019  Operators  Map of S-200 operators in blue with former operators in red = Current operators = * – 10 * – 15 * – 1The Military Balance 2010. — P. 123. battalion. * – 3 Battalions in Army, 4 Groups (Battalions) in the Indian Air Force * – 10 Upgraded battalions,The Military Balance 2010. — P. 253. in service.

Life and career George Barbier, Willard Robertson, Claude Cooper, Allen Jenkins and William Foran in the original Broadway production of The Front Page (1928) Jenkins was born on Staten Island, New York, on April 9, 1900. He studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. In his first stage appearance, he danced next to James Cagney in a chorus line for an off- Broadway musical called Pitter-Patter, earning five dollars a week. He also appeared in Broadway plays between 1923 and 1962, including The Front Page (1928). His big break came when he replaced Spencer Tracy for three weeks in the Broadway play The Last Mile. Jenkins was called to Hollywood by Darryl F. Zanuck and signed first to Paramount Pictures and shortly afterward to Warner Bros. His first role in films came in 1931, when he appeared as an ex-convict in the short Straight and Narrow. He had originated the character of Frankie Wells in the Broadway production of Blessed Event and reprised the role in its film adaptation, both in 1932. With the advent of talking pictures, he made a career out of playing comic henchmen, stooges, policemen, taxi drivers, and other 'tough guys' in numerous films of the 1930s and 1940s, especially for Warner Bros. Allen Jenkins was labeled the \\"greatest scene-stealer of the 1930s\\" by The New York Times. In 1959, Jenkins played the role of elevator operator Harry in the comedy Pillow Talk. He was a member of Hollywood's so- called \\"Irish Mafia\\", a group of Irish-American actors and friends which included Spencer Tracy, James Cagney, Pat O'Brien and Frank McHugh. Jenkins later voiced the character of Officer Charlie Dibble on the Hanna-Barbera TV cartoon, Top Cat (1961–62). He was a regular on the television sitcom Hey, Jeannie! (1956–57), starring Jeannie Carson and often portrayed Muggsy on the 1950s-1970s CBS series The Red Skelton Show. He was also a guest star on many other television programs, such as The Man from U.N.C.L.E., Mr. & Mrs. North, I Love Lucy, Playhouse 90, The Tab Hunter Show, The Ernie Kovacs Show, Zane Grey Theater, and Your Show of Shows. He had a cameo appearance in It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963). Eleven days before his death, he made his final appearance, at the end of Billy Wilder's remake of The Front Page (1974); it was released posthumously. Jenkins publicized his own alcoholism and was the first actor to speak in the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate about it. He was involved in beginning the first Alcoholics Anonymous programs in California prisons for women. Jenkins is interred at Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, D.C., Section 10, Lot 31. Death Jenkins died of lung cancer on July 20, 1974, at age 74.

In addition to the airfield, there are several U.S. Army direct support, transportation, and tactical units located there, including the Combat Aviation Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division. The garrison has an area of and cost US$11 billion. Camp Humphreys is the largest U.S. overseas military base, housing some 500 buildings and amenities. In 2004, an agreement was reached between the United States and South Korean governments to move all U.S. forces to garrisons south of the Han River and relocate the United States Forces Korea and United Nations Command Headquarters to Camp Humphreys. Those movements were completed in 2018, and transformed Camp Humphreys into the largest U.S. Army garrison in Asia.https://www.stripes.com/news/pacific/usfk-dedicates-new-headquarters-at- camp-humphreys-1.535321 Under that plan, the 28,500 U.S. troop presence in South Korea was consolidated and United States Forces Korea moved from Yongsan Garrison in Seoul to Camp Humphreys. Camp Humphreys is south of the former base in Seoul and about from the Demilitarized Zone that divides North and South Korea. That puts the base about twice as far from North Korea as its predecessor, one of the main reasons for the move. While the new location moves the bulk of U.S. troops out of the range of North Korean artillery, the North Korean military has developed large caliber rockets and ballistic missiles, as well as a nuclear capability, capable of reaching Camp Humphreys.

The immediate area around Camp Humphreys is mostly agricultural and consists mainly of rice fields. There are some rolling hills in the vicinity, but for the most part the elevations are less than . There is a small mountain range about seven miles south of Camp Humphreys, with peaks reaching 958 feet in elevation. Larger mountains are located to the northeast, east, and southwest, all within with peaks reaching to in elevation to the south and in elevation to the southeast. Urban areas are situated mostly to the northeast of the airfield. Seoul is located approximately northeast.

Humphreys, a pilot assigned to the 6th Transportation Company, who died in a helicopter accident. In 1964, Humphreys District command (later re-designated as the 23rd Direct Support Group) was activated as a separate installation command of the Eighth U.S. Army, providing all direct support, supply and maintenance, storage of all conventional ammunition in Korea, Adjutant General publications and training aides and the Eighth U.S. Army Milk Plant.U.S. Army Garrison Humphreys Official History =1970s= In 1974, with the activation of the 19th Support Brigade, Camp Humphreys was redesignated as U.S. Army Garrison, Camp Humphreys. USAG-Camp Humphreys was still responsible for all affairs affecting personnel stationed at Camp Humphreys, but the 19th Support Command was responsible for all support activities vital to the Eighth U.S. Army and its subordinate units. Those units formerly reporting to the 23rd Direct Support Group reported to the 19th Support Command in Daegu. Only the basic functions remained with USAG Camp Humphreys. =1990s= Later, the 23rd Direct Support Group and 19th Support were renamed the 23rd Support Group and 19th Theater Army Area Command. On 17 June 1996, the United States Army Support Activity Area III (USASA Area III) was established and made responsible for the peacetime support mission for Camp Humphreys, Camp Long, Camp Eagle and U.S. Army units assigned to Suwon Airbase. =2000s= Camps Eagle and Long closed on 4 June 2010, consolidating installation support activities at Camp Humphreys. 2005 protests Protestors near Pyeongtaek The Daechuri Protests were a series of large protests against the South Korean and American governments' plan to expand Camp Humphreys to make it the main base for most U.S. troops in South Korea. It concluded when residents of Daechuri and other small villages near Pyeongtaek agreed to a government settlement according to which they would leave their homes in 2006 and allow the base expansion. Compensation for the land averaged 600 million won (about US$600,000) per resident. Under a 2004 land-swap pact, the U.S. promised to gradually return a combined 170 square kilometers of land housing 42 military bases and related facilities to South Korea and move U.S. military forces from garrisons in and north of Seoul to Camp Humphreys. With the creation of the Installation Management Command on 24 October 2006, U.S. Army Support Activity Area III was redesignated as U.S. Army Garrison Humphreys and Area III on 15 March 2007. On 13 November 2007, USFK and South Korean officials conducted a groundbreaking ceremony for the expansion of Camp Humphreys. Under that plan, the 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea would be consolidated into two regional hubs in Pyeongtaek and Daegu by 2016. =2010s= In 2010, the U.S. Army announced that a tour normalization policy would gradually be introduced. Single soldiers would typically serve two-year tours, and troops who brought families would stay for three years. Previously most troops served one-year unaccompanied tours in Korea. Additional infrastructure to accommodate more families would be built. On 2 September 2011, U.S. and South Korean officials participated in a joint groundbreaking ceremony to mark the beginning of construction for an elementary school to accommodate 850 students and a high school to accommodate 950 students on Camp Humphreys. On 26 August 2013, Camp Humphreys opened a new elementary school. The new elementary school will hold kindergarten through fifth-grade classes for a total enrollment capacity of 875 students. As of 2017 the U.S. Army called Humphreys \\"the largest power projection platform in the Pacific\\". When the final stage of base expansion is completed about 2020, Humphreys will have tripled in size to nearly 3,500 acres, making it the largest U.S. overseas military base. To accommodate more families, up to twelve 12-story housing towers will be built. The population of Humphreys is expected to exceed 45,000. Up to 93% of the $10.7 billion expansion cost will be paid by South Korea under a 2014 Special Measures Agreement.

Responding just days after the quake, Music for Relief launched an innovative fundraising program called Download to Donate for Haiti. MFR compiled previously unreleased songs by A-list artists for digital release on musicforrelief.org. Supporters were asked to donate whatever they could. Funds raised provided immediate aid as well as long-term sustainable rebuilding solutions for the people affected by the earthquake.. *More than 75,000 people downloaded the songs *Average donation was $16.47 (no donation was required) *The Download to Donate widget generated 9.7M views and 1.75M plays Reforestation in Israel Following the worst forest fires in Israel's history which burned areas of the Carmel Mountain Range near the city of Haifa in December 2010, Music for Relief contributed to partner Jewish National Fund for reforestation. Since the fires, rangers have focused on removing charred vegetation, creating firebreaks, monitoring unaffected trees in burnt areas, and repairing forest access roads. With Music for Relief's support, Jewish National Fund began re-planting in select areas where regeneration failed to occur. Music for Relief's contribution funds the planting of 1,100 trees as a part of Operation Carmel Renewal: From Black to Green. Reforestation in Haiti Music for Relief funds Konpay's reforestation project in and around the village of Cyvadier, in the southeast Department of Jacmel, Haiti. The goals of the project are to increase awareness of the importance of protecting trees and create advocates for the environment, to strengthen local water sources and regional water sheds, and to increase household income by offering fruit trees to participants. These effort strengthens Haitian solutions to environmental, social and economic problems by building collaborative networks, sharing technology and expertise, and mobilizing resources to support innovative Haitian-led initiatives. Reforestation in US and Canada Linkin Park has contributed $1 per ticket from their touring in North America since 2007 to support tree planting in the U.S. with American Forests and in Canada with Tree Canada. Trees planted in the U.S. were primarily to reforest areas burned following wildfires. Reforestation in Brazil Music for Relief contributed $57,000 in 2011 for the planting of 57,000 trees with The Nature Conservancy in Brazil's Atlantic Forest for their Plant A Billion Trees campaign. Only 12% of the Atlantic Forest's original area remains and only 7% is well conserved. It is one of the world's most endangered tropical forests, threatened by coastal development, urban expansion, and illegal logging. The forest provides clean water and hydro energy for over 130 million Brazilians and is home to an extraordinary array of biodiversity found nowhere else on earth. Much of what remains of the forest is found in isolated fragments, which are often too small to support a full array of its extraordinary biodiversity. Hurricane Sandy In October 2012 Hurricane Sandy left more than 8 million without power, created extensive flooding, and destruction in the Northeast of the United States and in Haiti. To date the super storm has impacted more than 60 million people, with extensive damage to homes and businesses. It is one of the largest storms to ever hit the U.S. Music for Relief partnered with Save the Children in New York and New Jersey and with International Medical Corps in Haiti to provide immediate relief and long term assistance to the families affected by this immense storm. To date Save the Children have helped replace indoor and outdoor learning materials that were damaged or destroyed by the storm, as well as provide other assistance, like transportation support to ensure that children are able to access child care and families are able to get back to work. Following Hurricane Sandy, International Medical Corps added Mobile Medical Units at their already established site in Les Cayes Haiti, one of the hardest hit areas. In just two months they provided nearly 2,500 medical consultations for those struggling after the storm. IMC is also working to rehabilitate the Aquin water system to ensure a safe supply and distribute shelter, hygiene, and essential supplies to populations affected by Sandy in the South Department. Just under $100,000 was raised and contributed to help the recovery following Hurricane Sandy to date. Oklahoma Tornado In late May, 2013 a series of tornadoes ripped through the US Midwest and Great Plains region. Two devastating tornadoes hit the southern Oklahoma City Area. An EF4 tornado struck a rural area in the town of Shawnee, OK on May 19, followed by a massive EF5 tornado that ripped through the area of Moore, OK on May 20. Twenty-six people were killed, including 10 children. With winds close to 200 mph, the tornado leveled almost everything in its path, impacting an estimated 10,000 people and damaging approximately 2,400 homes. MFR partnered with All Hands Volunteers to support their work in the community of El Reno to help clean fields and farmland of debris, gut homes and put their lives back together. The $25,000 raise for Oklahoma Tornado Relief were used to cover cost of transporting volunteers (vehicles/fuel; getting them into the field/onto project sites), and equipping them with the tools needed to clear fields, remove debris and deconstruct houses and other structures. Disaster Risk Mitigation As a disaster-prone country frequently hit by volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, landslides and floods, Indonesia has a history of vulnerability to natural disasters, exemplified by the tragic 2004 tsunami that killed hundreds of thousands of people and caused tremendous damage to infrastructure. The Indonesian government has appealed to train people in vulnerable areas in an effort to help disaster preparedness. Music for Relief partnered with Terre des Hommes Netherlands with its Community Based Disaster Reduction Management. The disaster training aims to train individuals in the communities who can share their knowledge with others including school administrators, teachers and children, people living on the riverbanks, and people living in the slums of Jakarta. East Africa Hunger Crisis Beginning in 2011, Music for Relief joined K'naan and the American Refugee Committee as a part of the I AM A STAR campaign to raise awareness in the U.S. about the hunger crisis in the Horn of Africa. The goal is to inspire people to get involved at the local level to help provide famine relief and shine a light on Somali culture and people. MFR pledged $50,000 to support Banadir Hospital as well as another $50,000 to \\"Kitchen Mamas,\\" a pilot program designed to help distribute information about health, WASH and disease protection, while improving access to service providers for gender-based violence and health providers who can treat cholera, HIV/AIDS and malnutrition. Japan Tsunami Relief To raise funds for children affected by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, Music for Relief launched a Download to Donate playlist, with unreleased songs from leading artists. All funds benefit Save the Children's relief efforts in Japan. Typhoon Haiyan In November, 2013, Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda), possibly the strongest storm to make landfall in recorded history, struck and devastated portions of Southeast Asia, especially the Philippines. The extreme wind speeds from the typhoon left entire communities destroyed and the massive storm surge behaved much like a tsunami, wiping out infrastructure and causing significant flooding. Music for Relief, in partnership with International Medical Corps, took immediate action to raise awareness and funds for disaster relief efforts. Funds raised assisted the 15 million people impacted by the storm. IMC was on the ground in the Philippines less than 48 hours after the storm providing lifesaving medical care, medication, clean water and other urgently needed supplies to affected families. More than six months after the storm, MFR and IMC are still providing lifesaving programs including nutrition, water and sanitation, psychosocial support, and replacement and repair of health infrastructure. Concert for the Philippines After Typhoon Haiyan struck in November 2013, Music for Relief responded immediately to raise funds for those in need. They created a Typhoon Haiyan Bracelet for supporters who donated $25 or more to the cause. Artist partner, Steve Aoki pledged to match donations up to $36,000 in honor of his 36th birthday. In January 2014, Music for Relief held Concert for the Philippines including performances from Linkin Park, The Offspring, Bad Religion, Heart, The Filharmonic and special guests including Travis Barker and Mike Einziger. Supporters of Music For Relief either raised or donated a minimum of $250 to attend this intimate concert at Club Nokia in Los Angeles. Flooding in the Balkans In May 2014 the Balkans were hit with severe floods affecting over 1 million people. In Bosnia alone, approximately 500 homes have been destroyed and 75,000 people have been displaced. In partnership with International Medical Corps, Music for Relief took immediate action to raise funds for food as well as clean water and sanitation support, with an emphasis on disease prevention. Make a donation here and use #SupportTheBalkans to raise awareness. Power the World 1.3 billion people in the world lack access to electricity. This staggering fact ignited Linkin Park's interest in helping to find solutions.

The supporting cast features Maria Bello, Elizabeth Hurley, Owen Wilson, Cheryl Ladd and Janeane Garofalo. The film is based on Jerry Stahl's autobiographical book of the same name and tells the story of Stahl's rise from a small-time television writer to his success as a comedy writer making up to $5,000 a week writing for 1980s series such as thirtysomething, Moonlighting, and ALF (changed in the film to Mr. Chompers). Maria Bello stars as Kitty, a fellow detox survivor to whom Stahl relates his rise and fall. The film also stars Owen Wilson as Stahl's friend and fellow addict, Nicky; Elizabeth Hurley as his wife, Sandra; and Janeane Garofalo as a Hollywood agent, Jana. Fred Willard also appears as the producer of Mr. Chompers. The real Stahl makes a cameo appearance as a doctor at a methadone clinic. Stiller's performance in the film was critically acclaimed. It has been released on DVD in the US and the UK. A soundtrack CD was also released with most of the music heard in the film. Plot Approaching the end of a drug rehabilitation program, Jerry Stahl (Stiller) quits his job at a fast food restaurant on an impulse when an attractive woman named Kitty (Bello) pulls up at the drive-through window. The two check into a motel, where Jerry tells her about his life between bouts of sex. A series of flashbacks, intercut with their conversations, details his working life to this point. After moving to Los Angeles from New York City, Jerry – already addicted to various prescription medications – becomes friends with another addict, Nicky (Wilson). At the urging of Nicky and his girlfriend Vola (Lourdes Benedicto), Jerry marries Vola's friend Sandra (Hurley) so she can get her green card. Sandra uses her position at a television studio to get Jerry onto the writing staff of the popular comedy series Mr. Chompers. He uses memories from his childhood, including his mother's hysterical grief over his father's death, to fuel his writing. He juggles his Mr. Chompers job and regular visits to a heroin dealer, Dita (Liz Torres). However, his drug use eventually gets him fired. Sandra finds him a new job with a different series, No Such Luck, but star Pamela Verlaine (Cheryl Ladd) – herself a recovering addict – sternly but sympathetically insists that he kick his habit first. As soon as Jerry starts on a methadone program, he runs across a dealer named Gus (Peter Greene), who introduces him to crack cocaine and later Dilaudid. His increased drug use costs him his new job, and Sandra throws him out, disgusted at his decision to shoot up when she tells him she is pregnant. Her opinion of him falls even further when he shows up high for the birth of his daughter Nina. While looking after Nina one night, he gets high and is arrested by the police. The incident further strains his relationship with Sandra, who makes it clear that she would prefer to see as little of him as possible. The flashbacks end at this point, with Jerry returning to Los Angeles in hopes of being part of Nina's life. As he begins to resurrect his stalled writing career, he gets a surprise visit from Kitty. The two have one last sexual encounter before she leaves to move to Anchorage. In the final scene, Jerry appears on a series of talk shows and news programs, while commenting in voice-over about the damage that his addiction has done to his life. \\"I got out with a bad liver and enough debt to keep me in hock 'til I'm 90, if I'm still here.

Its local government areas are the Cities of Melbourne and Moonee Valley. At the 2016 census, Flemington had a population of 7,719. The Melbourne Cup Thoroughbred horse race has been held at Flemington Racecourse since 1861. Flemington is located between the Maribyrnong River and the Moonee Ponds Creek and includes the locality of Newmarket, in which the main commercial area Racecourse Road is located. The suburb was named by settler James Watson after Flemington Estate in Scotland. Another version of the origin of the name relates to Robert Fleming, a Brunswick (Victoria) resident who had owned land beside the Saltwater River and operated a butchery there. History In 1839, James Watson came to Port Phillip to purchase land for himself and English and Scottish investors. He named the area Flemington after Flemington Estate in Scotland where his wife's father was a manager, which was in turn named because of Flemish settlement in the area. Flemington and neighbouring Kensington consist primarily of weatherboard cottages mixed with attached brick single-storey and some double- storey terrace houses.

Also around this time abattoirs and other commercial activities were established. Various industrial activities were clustered around the Maribyrnong River and the Moonee Ponds Creek. The Victorian Goldrush of the 1850s encouraged further development as Mount Alexander Road was the main route to the North Western Goldfields.

A hitokiri from the Satsuma District, Shinbei came from a peasant background. After his first high-level assassination, he was elevated to samurai status despite the traditional samurai disdain towards peasants. Shinbei was involved in the assassination of Ii Naosuke, the head of the Edo Council of Elders who was the head of administration for the Tokugawa shogunate in 1860. This assassination sparked years of violence in Japan especially in Kyoto where assassinations became commonplace. Of all the Hitokiris, Shinbei killed the most people. Besides Naosuke, his victims included politicians such as Shimada Sakon, Ukyo Omokuni and Homma Seiichiro. he was also suspected of murdering a young woman named Komichi. Because of this, Tanakaba was titled \\"ansatsu taicho\\" (captain of assassins).Turnbull , Stephen. The Samurai Swordsman: Master of War. Tuttle Publishing; 1 edition (August 5, 2014). p. 182. The Shinsengumi was formed in 1863 to suppress the hitokiri and Tosa loyalists and restore law and order. Shinbei's sword was found at the scene of the assassination of a senior official Anegakōji Kintomo. He was taken for questioning in Kyoto and asked to see the sword. He committed seppuku when he was given the sword.

It was developed by Pfizer in the early 1980s and currently marketed in some countries under the brand name Aclame. Most dipeptides are not sweet, but the unexpected discovery of aspartame in 1965 led to a search for similar compounds that shared its sweetness. Alitame is one such second-generation dipeptide sweetener. Neotame, developed by the owners of the NutraSweet brand, is another. Alitame is about 2000 times sweeter than sucrose (table sugar), about 10 times sweeter than aspartame, and has no aftertaste. Its half-life under hot or acidic conditions is about twice as long as aspartame's, although some other artificial sweeteners, including saccharin and acesulfame potassium, are more stable yet. Unlike aspartame, alitame does not contain phenylalanine, and can therefore be used by people with phenylketonuria. Alitame has approved for use in Mexico, Australia, New Zealand and China. Danisco has withdrawn its petition for using alitame as a sweetening agent or flavoring in food in USA. Sweeny also addresses a compound with a sweetness of 1200 x sucrose in his review, in based on an NH-CH(cyclopropyl)tert-butyl (Ex 6). Ex 5, with NH- CH(cyclopropyl)2 is also 1200 x sucrose.

Since the series features a fictional version of medieval Western Europe, it can be considered historical fantasy or alternate history. Novels Kushiel's Legacy consists of the following novels (with release dates). This is also the chronological order within the story. *Phèdre Trilogy series follows the story of Phèdre nó Delaunay **1 Kushiel's Dart (June 2001) **2 Kushiel's Chosen (April 2002) **3 Kushiel's Avatar (April 2003) *Imriel Trilogy series (UK title: Treason's Heir trilogy) follows the story of Imriel nó Montreve de la Courcel **1 Kushiel's Scion (June 2006) **2 Kushiel's Justice (June 2007) **3 Kushiel's Mercy (June 2008) *Moirin Trilogy series follows the story of Moirin of the Maghuin Dhonn, more than a century after the events of Kushiel's Mercy **1 Naamah's Kiss (June 2009) **2 Naamah's Curse (June 2010) **3 Naamah's Blessing (June 2011) It was mentioned that the names for Kushiel's Chosen and Kushiel's Avatar were initially to be Naamah's Servant and Elua's Child respectively. This was changed for continuity and branding. Similarly, the initial title of Naamah's Kiss had been Naamah's Gift, but was changed prior to publication. There is a short story in the compendium Songs of Love and Death (2010), entitled \\"You and You Alone\\". It chronicles the story of Delaunay, Phedre's foster father and mentor, and Rolande de la Courcel. Alternate history In the series, the Roman Empire (called the Tiberian Empire) had fallen due to internal conflict instead of the Barbarian Invasions and the Germanic peoples were kept at bay to the east of the Rhine (called Rhenus with its Latin name). Paul the Apostle did not live to form Christianity and followers of Jesus (called Yeshua ben Yosef) live as a sect of Messianic Judaism known as the Yeshuites. An offshoot from Yeshuites, led by a descendant of Jesus and his angel companions, had made its foothold in Gaul after a long period of exile and persecution. Their creed based on apotheosis of early founders predominates in the country now known as Terre d'Ange. Companion material Cover of Earth Begotten Earth Begotten is a companion book to Jacqueline Carey's Kushiel's Legacy fantasy series. It is essentially a prelude to the tales of Terre d'Ange and explores the mythology and origins of Blessed Elua and his seven angelic companions.Experiments in Reading: Earth Begotten:The Journey of Blessed Elua Whilst the story is very short, fewer than 1500 words, it builds on references to Elua and His Companions throughout the series and elaborates on Elua's conception and ascension to the \\"true Terre d'Ange that lies beyond\\". Earth Begotten was published in April, 2003 by Havilah Press. A strictly limited run of 50 copies was produced to ensure that the bound version remained a collector's item.Jacqueline Carey Official Author Site - FAQs The book is printed in silver ink on black paper in Centaur type.

D'Angelines, as the citizens are called, are descended from Blessed Elua and his band of fallen angels. Elua was born when the blood of the crucified Yeshua ben Yosef, the son of the One God, mixed with the tears of the Magdalene and then was quickened by Mother Earth. Scorned by his grandfather, the One God, Elua wandered the Earth with eight companion angels. The eight were Naamah, Anael, Azza, Shemhazai, Camael, Cassiel, Eisheth, and Kushiel. After years of wandering, Elua and his companions settled in the land that would become Terre d'Ange. Elua espoused the precept \\"Love as thou wilt\\" and he and his companions inter-bred with the native populace, creating the D'Angeline people. Elua himself is a cross between Dionysus and a wandering fertility god associated with nature, love, and liberty. Kushiel's Legacy is set about one thousand years after the time of Elua, and the D'Angeline people worship him and his eight companions as gods. They live by his precept, \\"Love as thou wilt,\\" and, since Naamah sold her body at times to support Elua during their wanderings, consider prostitution to be a sacred service. This service is regulated by its own guild. Furthermore, to serve in the Court of Night-Blooming Flowers, composed of several Houses, each with their own interpretation of Naamah's reasons for prostituting herself, is regarded as the highest pinnacle in Naamah's Service. Terre d'Ange is divided into seven provinces, each with a companion as its patron deity. Cassiel, who eschewed mortal love and never fully rejected the One God, is the only companion without a province. The Cassiline Brotherhood, however, follows the ways and philosophy of Cassiel and have a prominent role in d'Angeline society. Naamah (patron Goddess of the Night Court) is the patron of Namarre, Anael of L'Agnace, Azza of Azzalle, Shemhazai of Siovale, Camael of Camlach, Eisheth of Eisande, and Kushiel of Kusheth. The royal House Courcel rules Terre D'Ange from the City of Elua in L'Agnace. At the beginning of the series relations are generally good with Terre d'Ange's neighboring countries of Aragonia, Caerdicca Unitas, and distant Khebbel-im-Akkad. Skaldia, however, has long sought to conquer the D'Angelines. They also have good relations with Alba and Eire though scarce given the impact of the Master of the Straits. The heroine of the first three installments of the series is anguissette Phèdre nó Delaunay, whose unique talents lead her to save her nation from several terrible fates. The second trilogy of the series follows Imriel nó Montrève de la Courcel, Phèdre's adopted son and Prince of Terre d'Ange in his quest to manhood. The third trilogy within the Kushiel Universe follows Moirin, a half-d'Angeline and half-Alban descendant of House Courcel, approximately 100 years after Kushiel's Legacy.

Donatien was reared in Mandrake House and retains a great fear of the place and its adepts. He served at the Midwinter Masque with Phèdre. *Ellyn is one of the children with whom Phèdre was reared, noted for being tender-hearted. She served at the Midwinter Masque with Phèdre. *Etienne is one of the children with whom Phèdre was reared, half-brother to Ellyn. Etienne was too young to attend the Midwinter Masque the year Phèdre and Ellyn served at it. *Jacanth is a boy whose marque was bought by Cereus House. He served at the Midwinter Masque with Phèdre. *Jareth Moran is the Second to Dowayne Miriam Bouscerve when Phèdre first arrives at the House, and becomes Dowayne upon her death. *Juliette is one of the children with whom Phèdre was reared; her marque was bought by Dahlia House. *Miriam Bouscevre is the Dowayne of the House when Phèdre first arrives: elderly, with white hair and grey eyes. *Suriah is an adept of the House who portrayed the Winter Queen at a Midwinter Masque in her youth, and became Second to Jareth Moran later in life. *Japheth nó Eglantine-Vardennes is a former adept who has become a premier playwright; his play Passion of Naamah is chosen to be performed for King Ganelon. *Favrielle nó Eglantine is an adept who had a fall just before her debut that left her scarred (some say this was not an accident). She is a clothier, and she designs Phedre's costume for her re-introduction into the Service of Naamah. Phedre ends up paying Favrielle's marque, so that she can set up as a clothier in her own right, instead of being forced to work off her marque in servitude to Eglantine House. *Raphael Murain nó Gentian is the adept who aided Phèdre nó Delaunay in understanding the meaning of her dreams, which understanding prompted Phèdre to seek Melisande Shahrizai in La Serenissima, in Kushiel's Chosen. Raphael later became a priest at the Great Temple of Naamah in the City of Elua, who gives Imriel nó Montreve de la Courcel Namaah's blessing in Kushiel's Justice. *Liliane de Souverain was an adept of Jasmine House before wedding (without the blessing of her House) and giving birth to Phèdre nó Delaunay. As Liliane had made her marque, she was free to do as she wished, but the child of an unsanctioned union was not treated as part of the House. *Miriette nó Orchis is an adept who, after making her marque, sets up her own salon. When Phèdre and Alcuin serve Anafiel Delaunay in Naamah's honor, Mierette lies with Alcuin and soothes some of his strain about being dedicated to Naamah only for the love of his master, Anafiel Delaunay. *Didier Vascon is the Second of Valerian House during Kushiel's Dart; by the events of Kushiel's Scion, he has become Dowayne.

Area codes 212, 646, and 332 are area codes in the North American Numbering Plan for most of the borough of Manhattan in New York City. By area, it is one of the smallest numbering plan areas (NPAs). These area codes are overlaid by area code 917, which covers the entirety of New York City. History Area code 212 is one of the original 86 area codes assigned by AT&T; in 1947, when it served the entire five boroughs of New York City until 1984. On February 1, 1984, in response to a request from New York Telephone, the New York Public Service Commission voted to divide New York City into two numbering plan areas. Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island received the new area code 718, while numbering plan area 212 was reduced to Manhattan and the Bronx. Amid protests from local officials and state lawmakers, the commission was persuaded by New York Telephone's reasoning that a new area code was needed to \\"prevent an impending exhaustion of telephone numbers.\\" New York Telephone made some 718 telephone numbers operational several days in advance. Despite state lawmakers for the outer boroughs threatening legislation to stop the division, code 718 was initiated as scheduled on September 1, 1984. Permissive dialing of 212 telephone numbers continued across New York City, during which either 212 or 718 could be used, until January 1, 1985, when the use of 718 became mandatory for the boroughs affected. On July 1, 1992, the 718 territory was expanded to include the Bronx and the Marble Hill neighborhood of Manhattan (see below), while the rest of Manhattan remained in 212. Permissive dialing of 212 continued across the Bronx until May 16, 1993, during which either 212 or 718 could be used; after that date, 718 had to be used for telephone calls to the Bronx from everywhere outside the borough except the three boroughs that originally had the 718 code, and Bronx residents telephoning Manhattan had to dial 212. On September 25, 1993, callers from the Bronx no longer had to dial 718 to reach Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. In 1992, the entire city was overlaid with area code 917, which had originally been planned for only the Bronx and mobile service. Area code 646 overlaid area code 212 in Manhattan on July 1, 1999, when available 917 mobile numbers were becoming scarce. During November 2015, area code 332 was assigned as an additional overlay area code for Manhattan's numbering plan area 212 and 646,MacMillan, Thomas. \\"Manhattan Is Getting Another Area Code: 332\\". The Wall Street Journal. December 1, 2015. the fourth serving the area and the seventh serving New York City. Area code 332 became active on June 10, 2017, as area code 212 was expected to become depleted of numbers during the third quarter of 2017,\\"2015-1 NRUF and NPA Exhaust Analysis\\". North American Numbering Plan Administration. Retrieved June 9, 2017. and 646 is expected to become depleted of numbers by 2018. This effectively allocates 23.4 million numbers to a borough of 1.6 million people. =Marble Hill= One Manhattan neighborhood, Marble Hill, is part of the 718/347/929 codes, rather than the 212/646/332 area codes. Marble Hill, although officially a part of the Borough of Manhattan to this day, was severed geographically from Manhattan Island by the construction of the Harlem River Ship Canal during 1895. It was physically connected to the Bronx in 1914 when the by-passed segment of the Harlem River was filled in. When the Bronx shifted to 718 in 1992, Marble Hill residents fought to stay in 212, but lost. Marble Hill's trunk cable system is wired into the Bronx line, and it would have been too expensive for New York Telephone to rewire it. Market reputation A business with a 212 area code is often perceived as having the prestige of Manhattan and the convenience of stability, particularly if a number has been in service for several decades. One example is PEnnsylvania 6-5000 (presently 212-736-5000), the number for the Hotel Pennsylvania in Midtown. The hotel claims that it is the oldest telephone number used continuously in New York City. This claim is disputed, but PEnnsylvania 6-5000 did appear in a 1940 Glenn Miller Orchestra song title. The scarcity of available telephone numbers in area code 212, combined with it being the city's original area code, result in the 212 area code being considered prestigious by some Manhattan residents. Businesses now sell telephone numbers with 212 area codes, though it is uncertain whether the customer or the telephone company is the legal owner of a phone number. During August 2010, AT&T; reported that there are no new numbers available in the 212 area code. Several years before then, new landlines in Manhattan started to be assigned numbers in 917 (or 646). In addition, the Inwood section in far northern Manhattan is overlaid with area code 347, which also began as a cellphone area code. Those who now get a 212 area code must rely on luck of the draw when they establish their service or use websites where they can purchase a telephone number with the coveted area code which they can port to their landline or cellphone service.

Its central theme is the argument that the Catholic Church is the Babylon of the Apocalypse which is described in the Bible.Revelation 17:5 The book delves into the symbolism of the image which is described in the Book of Revelation – the woman with the golden cup – and it also attempts to prove that many of the fundamental practices of the Church of Rome, and its Modus Operandi in general, stem from non-scriptural precedents. It analyzes modern Catholic holidays, including Christmas and Easter, traces their roots back to pagan festivals and shows that many other accepted doctrines (such as Jesus' crucifixion on a Cross) may not be correct. Hislop provides a detailed comparison of the ancient religion which was established in Babylon (allegedly by the Biblical king Nimrod and his wife, Semiramis) by drawing on a variety of historical and religious sources, in order to show that the modern Papacy and the Catholic Church are the same system as the Babylon that was mentioned by the apostle Paul in the first century (when he commented on the iniquity that was already creeping into the 1st century christian church2nd Thessalonians 2:7) and the author of Revelation.Revelation 17:5 Some scholars have rejected the book's arguments as erroneous and based on a flawed understanding of the Babylonian religion, but variations of them are accepted among some groups of evangelical Protestants. Publication history The book was expanded in 1858, going through many editions. A 3rd edition was published in 1862, a 7th in 1871, (thus, a mere six years after the author's death, four successive posthumous editions had already appeared), and a popular edition in 1903. Description Hislop builds on the Panbabylonian school of Hyperdiffusionism, which was common in the 19th century, to argue that Classical and Ancient Near Eastern civilization took its inspiration from Babylon. From this he derives the argument that the mystery religions of Late Antiquity were actually offshoots of one ancient religion founded at the Tower of Babel. Panbabylonism has since been relegated to pseudohistory by 20th- century scholars.Brown, Peter Lancaster. Megaliths, Myths and Men: An Introduction to Astro-Archaeology p. 268. Dover Publications, New York, 1976. Much of Hislop's work centers on his association of the legendary Ninus and his semi-historical wife Semiramis with the Biblical Nimrod as her husband and her son, with their incestuous male offspring being Tammuz. Hellenistic histories of the Ancient Near East tended to conflate their faint recollections of the deeds of ancient kings into legendary figures who exerted far more power than any ancient king ever did. In Assyria, they invented an eponymous founder of Nineveh named Ninus, who supposedly ruled 52 years over an empire comparable to the Persian Empire at its greatest extent. Ninus's wife Semiramis was in turn a corruption of the historical figure Shammuramat, regent of the Neo-Assyrian Empire from 811 BC.Georges Roux - Ancient Iraq Hislop takes Ninus as a historical figure and associates him with the Biblical figure Nimrod, though he was not the first to do so. The Clementine literature made the association in the 4th Century AD. An influential belief throughout the Middle Ages was that Ninus was the inventor of idolatry,Michael Camille, The Gothic Idol: Ideology and Image-Making in Medieval Art, Cambridge,1991: 50-51. a concept that Hislop clearly drew upon. However, Hislop wrote before the historical records of the ancient near east had been thoroughly decoded and studied, that cast doubt in the decades after he wrote whether there was any such figure as Ninus, and the Greek authors whom he quoted lacked credibility on the subject. Relief of the Babylonian goddess Ishtar, whose name Hislop claimed to be the root behind the English word Easter The Two Babylons heavily relies on Austen Henry Layard's publications of his excavations at Nineveh, which had only been just discovered in 1851. This gave his work an appearance of being well-researched at the time of its publication. For example, Hislop linked the name of Easter with Astarte, the Phoenician fertility goddess by citing Layard's recent discovery of Astarte's Assyrian name, Ishtar, which Hislop took to be \\"identical\\" to Easter. The claim that Easter is derived from Ishtar has been disputed. Modern etymologists derive the word Easter from the Proto-Indo-European root *aus-, meaning \\"dawn\\",Watkins, Calvert (2006 [2000]). The American Heritage Dictionary of Indo-European Roots. p. 2021. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. potentially by way of . p. 148-149. Ishtar is a Semitic name of uncertain etymology, possibly taken from the same root as Assyria, or from a semitic word meaning \\"to irrigate\\".Barton, George A. On the Etymology of Ishtar. Journal of the American Oriental Society Vol. 31, No. 4 (1911), pp. 355-358 Hislop ultimately claimed to trace Catholic doctrines back to the worship of Nimrod, asserting that the Catholic Church represented Whore of Babylon of the Book of Revelation and that \\"the Pope himself is truly and properly the lineal representative of Belshazzar.\\" He claimed that the Christogram IHS, the first three Greek letters in the name of Jesus, represented Latin characters standing for Isis, Horus and Seb. Analysis In the note by the editor of the 7th edition, which was published in 1871, it was claimed, \\"that no one, so far as we are aware, has ventured to challenge the accuracy of the historical proofs adduced in support of the startling announcement on the title page.\\" Since then however there have been many who have challenged the accuracy of Hislop's claims. For example, Lester L. Grabbe has highlighted the fact that Hislop's entire argument, particularly his association of Ninus with Nimrod, is based on a misunderstanding of historical Babylon and its religion. Grabbe also criticizes Hislop for portraying the mythological queen Semiramis as Nimrod's consort, despite the fact that she is never even mentioned in a single text associated with him, and for portraying her as the \\"mother of harlots\\", even though this is not how she is depicted in any of the texts where she is mentioned. In 2011, a critical edition was published.which also contains the English book by Ralph Woodrow Von Babylon nach Rom? – The Two Babylons?, 2011; , as well as the papers by Ralph Woodrow and Dr. Eddy Lanz Although Hislop's work is extensively footnoted, some commentators (in particular Ralph Woodrow) have stated that the document contains numerous misconceptions, fabrications, logical fallacies, unsubstantiated conspiracy theories, and grave factual errors.Woodrow, Ralph BOOK REVIEW - The Two Babylons: A Case Study in Poor Methodology Christian Research Institute, Vol. 22, No. 2, 2000 Influence Some fundamentalist Protestants still regard Hislop's book as proof that the Roman Catholic Church is, in fact, the continuation of the ancient Babylonian religion. In 1921 A. W. Pink confidently asserted that Hislop's work had \\"proven conclusively that all the idolatrous systems of the nations had their origin in what was founded by that mighty Rebel, the beginning of whose kingdom was Babel.\\" Jehovah's Witnesses' periodical The Watchtower frequently published excerpts from it until the 1980s.

Concurrent resolutions are typically adopted to regulate the internal affairs of the legislature that adopted them, or for other purposes, if authority of law is not necessary (such as in the cases of awards or recognitions). United States Congress In the United States Congress, a concurrent resolution is a resolution passed by both the House of Representatives and the Senate but is not presented to the President for signature and does not have the force of law. In contrast, joint resolutions and bills are presented to the President and, once signed or approved over a veto, are enacted and have the force of law. Concurrent resolutions are generally used to address the sentiments of both chambers or to deal with issues or matters affecting both houses. Examples of concurrent resolutions include: *providing for a recess or adjournment of more than three days during the session of Congress (required by Article I, Section 5 of the United States Constitution, \\"Neither House, during the session of Congress, shall, without the consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days, nor to any other place than that in which the two Houses shall be sitting.\\") *permitting the use of the Capitol rotunda, which is under the control of both Houses *providing for a joint session of Congress, normally to hear a message from the President, such as the State of the Union address *correcting the enrollment of a bill that has already passed both Houses *asking the President to return a bill that has been presented to him, before he has signed or vetoed the bill *launching the budget process *creating a temporary joint committee Before the Supreme Court of the United States ended the practice in its decision in Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha 462 U.S. 919 (1983), concurrent resolutions were sometimes used to override executive actions via a mechanism known as the legislative veto. If both houses of Congress were to censure a President (which has never happened – both the House and Senate have done so individually, but so far never together) the action would, according to parliamentary procedure, be in the form of a concurrent resolution, as a joint resolution requires the President's signature or veto and has the power of law. A concurrent resolution does not have the power of law, nor does it require action by the executive to take force. Concurrent resolutions originating in the Senate are abbreviated S.Con.Res. and those originating in the House are abbreviated H.Con.Res. Examples of concurrent resolutions *113th S.Con.Res. 8 - The Fiscal Year 2014 Senate budget, passed on March 23, 2013. *113th H.Con.Res. 25 - The Fiscal Year 2014 House budget, passed on March 21, 2013. *Senate Concurrent Resolution 10 of the 113th Congress - A bill to use the United States Capitol Visitor Center to celebrate the birthday of King Kamehameha. *115 S.Con.Res.3 - Senator Michael B.

The DSM-IV codes are thus used by mental health professionals to describe the features of a given mental disorder and indicate how the disorder can be distinguished from other, similar problems.Schacter, Gilbert, Wegner (2011)Psychology (2nd Edition), page 552, Worth Publishers The coding system utilized by the DSM-IV is designed to correspond with codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, commonly referred to as the ICD-9-CM. Since early versions of the DSM did not correlate with ICD codes and updates of the publications for the ICD and the DSM are not simultaneous, some distinctions in the coding systems may still be present. For this reason, it is recommended that users of these manuals consult the appropriate reference when accessing diagnostic codes Note that NOS is an abbreviation for Not Otherwise Specified, indicating a cluster of symptoms that do not clearly fit in any single diagnostic category. NOS is often a provisional diagnosis pending additional information or testing. For an alphabetical list, see DSM- IV codes (alphabetical).

McElroy. The film stars Desmond Harrington, Eliza Dushku, Emmanuelle Chriqui, Jeremy Sisto, and Kevin Zegers. The film was released on May 30, 2003. Plot College students Rich Stoker and Halley Smith are rock climbing in a remote forest of West Virginia. When Rich reaches the top, he is suddenly murdered before he can help Halley up. Someone then begins to yank Halley up the cliff, forcing her to cut the rope and falls to the ground. She attempts to escape but gets caught in a line of barbed wire and is pulled back into the woods, screaming. Three days later, medical student Chris Flynn drives through the mountains of Greenbrier County on his way to a business meeting. En route when a traffic jam is caused by a chemical spill, he stops at a gas station to ask for directions from an elderly man and decides to go down a different route through a dirt road to Bear Mountain which he finds on the gas station's map. He collides with a stationed SUV whose tires have been punctured. The vehicle belongs to a group of youths on a camping trip: Jessie, Carly, Scott, Evan and Francine, who soon realized that their tire puncture was not an accident after Jessie finds a strip of barbed wire tied to a tree. Evan and Francine stay to watch the cars as the others go to find help, but both of them are later murdered by a figure when they stumble into the woods. The others find an isolated cabin and go inside to use the phone, but they are horrified to find human body parts in the house and attempt to leave before forcing themselves to hide inside when the occupants return home. Three cannibalistic inbred mountain men: Three Finger, Saw Tooth and One Eye enter the cabin with Francine's corpse, and the hiding group watch as Francine's body is dismembered and eaten. After the cannibals fall asleep, the group attempts to escape. However, the cannibals awaken and chase them through the forest. The group runs into a clearing where they find cars belonged to previous victims and they try to make up an escape plan but when Chris gets shot in the leg while trying to distract the cannibals, Scott creates another diversion for the other three to escape but gets killed with arrows. Jessie, Carly, and Chris stumble upon an old watchtower and find a radio inside, which they try to use to call for help. Later, the cannibals arrive and are alerted when the radio starts responding to the group's call. Unable to get inside, the cannibals set the tower on fire to burn the group alive, but they escape by jumping out of the window to the trees. In the subsequent chase, Three Finger catches Carly and decapitates her with an axe. Chris pulls a branch while Jessie lures Three Finger for the former to release it, knocking Three Finger off to the ground. Jessie and Chris manage to escape and hide in a cave until the morning. The cannibals then find them, pushing Chris down the hill and taking Jessie back to their cabin. Chris survives the fall and meets a police officer, but the officer is killed by Saw Tooth, who shoots him in the eye with an arrow. Chris hitches a ride underneath the truck as it is driven back to the cabin by Saw Tooth. Chris drives through the building and runs into One Eye before he releases Jessie and proceeds to fight the cannibals. They escape as Chris kills the cannibals by blowing up their cabin. The pair then drives out of the forest in the cannibals' pickup truck and stumbles upon the gas station nearby; Chris takes the map to prevent others from the same wrong turn before he and Jessie leave. In the credits scene, a deputy sheriff, who had received the radio call earlier, investigates the remains of the destroyed cabin.

The series premiered on November 15, 2004 and ended in 2006. An 18- to 24-year-old heterosexual male, gay male or lesbian female, goes on three separate dates with three moms, who try to convince them to pick their son or daughter to date. The dater only meets the mother and makes his or her decision solely on their impression of the mother and her descriptions of her child. The dates are varied and are occasionally geared towards the dater's interests. The dates range from a simple lunch date to cheerleading lessons, washing cars, picking wild flowers, cooking, sports, and even getting tattoos. (It usually depends on the person's likes and dislikes). At the end of the date the mother reports back to the child. The mothers and contestants tend to be very assured of their chances. After all dates are completed, an elaborate beachfront finale is conducted. The dater explains to each mother why he or she has or has not chosen her child, and one by one the sons or daughters are revealed according to the person's liking.

The following is a partial list of some of these legends. Ancient Hawaiian folklore =Night marchers= According to Hawaiian legend, night marchers (huaka‘i po in Hawaiian) are ghosts of ancient warriors. They supposedly roam large sections of the island chain, and can be seen by groups of torches. They can usually be found in areas that were once large battlefields (the Nuuanu Pali on the island of Oahu is a good example.) Legend has it that if you look a night marcher straight in the eye, you will be forced to walk among them for eternity, but if you have a relative taken by them, you will be spared. Hawaiians say that in the presence of night marchers, one should lie down on their stomach, face down to avoid eye contact, stay quiet, breathe shallowly, and don’t move. Some say that they may nudge you to provoke a reaction so they can take you. Moanalua Gardens is one of the many places the Night Marchers are said to roam. =Carrying pork over the Nuuanu Pali= Local folklore on the island of Oahu says that one should never carry pork over the Pali Highway connecting Honolulu and Windward Oahu. The stories vary, but the classic legend is that if one carries pork of any kind over the old Pali road (not the modern pali highway) by automobile, the automobile would stop at a certain point on the way and not restart until the pork is removed from the vehicle. * Some versions of the story require the pork to be raw; other versions say that this happens after dark. * In some versions, a white dog or an old woman in a holuku will appear at the time the automobile stalls, and you must feed the pork to the dog to proceed. This legend has its roots in ancient Hawaiian mythology. According to legend, the Hawaiian volcano goddess Pele and the demigod Kamapua‘a (a half-man-half-pig) had a turbulent relationship, and the two agreed not to visit each other. If one takes pork over the Pali, the legend goes, one is symbolically taking a piece of Kamapua‘a from one side to the other, and it is said that Pele would stop that from happening. Alternately, the legend is attributed to a magic dog, which was killed and cooked and put in an 'umeke to be carried over the pali and given as a gift to the mother/wife of the perpetrator. Women did not eat pork in ancient Hawaii, but were allowed to eat dog. The dog's owner followed and called to the dog, which came alive, answered from within the 'umeke, causing the carrier to drop his pole and flee. The dog then returns to its master. A dog as food was offensive to the American missionaries, and under their influence, the dog meat in the story became pork. The Pele/Kamapua'a stories were adapted to make the story fit, the old lady in the white holoku is also Pele, but that too was corrupted from other tales. Modern urban legends =Paradise Park/Manoa Falls hiking trail= You can apparently hear a spectre/banshee screaming while walking along the path. Paradise Park is the never discarded name of the bird show/exhibit that was located there in the past. It was abandoned for an unknown reason. If one goes to the side of the parking lot you will see the overgrown ruins of a nursery. Behind this is a covered walkway twisting its way through dilapidated cages and building, some still bearing signs telling what kind of bird was housed there. On one side of these buildings is a small hut with a statuette of the Virgin Mary, and a Portuguese stone oven. There is also a Japanese pagoda. There are no records of cultural exhibits at Paradise Park, so the purpose of these buildings remains a mystery. =Events in Waialae and Kahala= At one time, the land that is now subdivisions in Waialae and Kahala Mall in eastern Honolulu were once the site of a graveyard. Since that time, two known events have occurred there. Mujina Green Lady The story of the green lady is that of a woman who would visit the gulch of Wahiawa, which also contains the Wahiawa Botanical Garden, with her children.Most Haunted Town/City in Hawaii: Honolulu One day while visiting one of her children became lost and was never found. The story goes that she still wanders the gulch looking for her child, or children, and will take any child that she comes across in the gulch. There have been several reports of seeing a green woman covered in moss or mold wandering the gulch. Others say that the green woman closely resembles that of a Japanese mythological creature called the kappa. This creature is said to resemble a turtle-like humanoid that steals children to feast upon. The last known sighting was said to have happened in the mid to late 1980s. In modern times, children and teenagers dare each other to run across the bridge that runs over the gulch at night. Most speculators say that this story was made up to keep children from wandering into the gulch by themselves.Green Lady Lurking In Spooky Wahiawa Park See also * Glen Grant *Hawaiian mythology References Hawaii folklore ","title":"Folklore in Hawaii"},{"id":"1380869","text":"Joseph Cassey Bustill (1822–1895) was an African American conductor in the Underground Railroad, operating primarily in Philadelphia to aid refugee slaves.

Such vehicles exist for both surface-to-air missiles and surface-to-surface missiles. Early on, such missiles were launched from fixed sites and had to be loaded onto trucks for transport, making them more vulnerable to attack since once they were spotted by the enemy they could not easily be relocated, and if they were it often took hours or even days to prepare them for launch once they reached their new site. The term can also refer to support structures used to transport a rocket launch vehicle horizontally from an assembly facility to a nearby fixed launch pad where it is raised vertical for launch. This system is used, for example, by SpaceX for its launch vehicles. A transporter erector launcher and radar (TELAR) is the same as a TEL but also incorporates part or all of the radar system necessary for firing the surface-to-air missile(s). Such vehicles have the capability of being autonomous, greatly enhancing their effectiveness. With this type of system each vehicle can fight regardless of the state or presence of support vehicles. The TEL or TELAR may have a rotating turntable that it can use to aim the missiles. The vehicle may have to turn to aim the missiles or they may fire straight up. Conversely, a transporter launcher and radar (TLAR) is the same as a TELAR without the erector capability, because the missile in question is transported in the launch-ready position. An example is the 9K330 Tor, which mounts a Vertical Launching System-style block of SAMs. Usually a number of TELs and TELARs are linked to one command post vehicle (CP or CPV). They may use target information from Target acquisition, designation and guidance radar (TADAGR) or, simply, TAR.

The shells are most commonly flat plates and domes, but may also take the form of ellipsoids or cylindrical sections, or some combination thereof. The first concrete shell dates back to the 2nd century. Uses Most concrete shell structures are buildings, including storage facilities, commercial buildings, and residential homes. Concrete shell construction techniques are well suited for complex curves and are also used to build boat hulls (called ferroconcrete). Historically, it was used by the British to create the Mulberry Harbours for the 1944 D-Day invasion of Normandy. Advantages Like the arch, the curved shapes often used for concrete shells are naturally strong structures, allowing wide areas to be spanned without the use of internal supports, giving an open, unobstructed interior. The use of concrete as a building material reduces both materials cost and construction costs, as concrete is relatively inexpensive and easily cast into compound curves. Steel is often used in conjunction with concrete to reinforce the structure. The resulting structure may be immensely strong and safe; modern monolithic dome houses, for example, have resisted hurricanes and fires, and are widely considered to be strong enough to withstand even F5 tornadoes. Disadvantages Since concrete is a porous material, concrete domes often have issues with sealing. If not treated, rainwater can seep through the roof and leak into the interior of the building. On the other hand, the seamless construction of concrete domes prevents air from escaping, and can lead to buildup of condensation on the inside of the shell. Shingling or sealants are common solutions to the problem of exterior moisture, and dehumidifiers or ventilation can address condensation. The dome of the Pantheon, Rome, the oldest known concrete shell Historic concrete shells The oldest known concrete shell, the Pantheon in Rome, was completed about AD 125, and is still standing. It has a massive concrete dome 43m in diameter, with an oculus at its centre. A monolithic structure, it appears to have been sculpted in place by applying thin layers on top of each other in decreasing diameter. Massively thick at the bottom and thinning (with aerated volcanic pumice as part of the concrete mix) at the top, the Pantheon is a remarkable feat of engineering. Modern concrete shell construction Modern thin concrete shells, which began to appear in the 1920s, are made from thin steel reinforced concrete, and in many cases lack any ribs or additional reinforcing structures, relying wholly on the shell structure itself. Shells may be cast in place, or pre-cast off site and moved into place and assembled. The strongest form of shell is the monolithic shell, which is cast as a single unit. The most common monolithic form is the dome, but ellipsoids and cylinders (resembling concrete Quonset huts / Nissen huts) are also possible using similar construction methods. Geodesic domes may be constructed from concrete sections, or may be constructed of a lightweight foam with a layer of concrete applied over the top. The advantage of this method is that each section of the dome is small and easily handled. The layer of concrete applied to the outside bonds the dome into a semi-monolithic structure. Monolithic domes are cast in one piece out of reinforced concrete and date back to the 1960s. Advocates of these domes consider them to be cost-effective and durable structures, especially suitable for areas prone to natural disasters. They also point out the ease of maintenance of these buildings. Monolithic domes can be built as homes, office buildings, or for other purposes. Completed in 1963, the University of Illinois Assembly Hall, located in Champaign, Illinois was and is the first ever concrete-domed arena. The design of the new building, by Max Abramovitz, called for the construction of one of the world’s largest edge-supported structures. See Construction of Assembly Hall. The Seattle Kingdome was the world's first (and only) concrete-domed multi-purpose stadium. It was completed in 1976 and demolished in 2000. The Kingdome was constructed of triangular segments of reinforced concrete that were cast in place. Thick ribs provided additional support.

The area lies in the narrow stretch between the Rideau Canal and Rideau River south of Sandy Hill and the Queensway and is part of Old Ottawa East. The neighbourhood is dominated by five large apartment buildings, some of the largest in Ottawa. These buildings range from low cost to moderate cost and mostly house new immigrants, students and young professionals. Across the Rideau River to the east Hurdman is a more recently built such area. Prior to Ottawa East's annexation in 1907, Lees was known as William Street.Ottawa Citizen, April 27, 1908, \\"Houses Lots Farms - A List of Investments and Home Properties\\" Originally the area was an industrial zone lying beside the train tracks. In the 1950s, the tracks were removed and replaced by the Queensway. The industry also left the area and new towers began to be built. The Eastern Ontario Institute of Technology, (later to merge with The Ontario Vocational Centre and renamed Algonquin College), opened its new Rideau Campus there in 1964.

The neighbourhood remained home to the Canadian military's Lees Avenue Armoury until the late 1980s. Lees Avenue seen from Sandy Hill Heights. In 1986 while building the Lees Transitway Station the area's industrial past began to cause major problems as it was discovered that large, and leaking, tanks of coal tar sat under the area. For some 35 years up to 1957, the Ottawa Gas Works had operated a coal gasification plant in the area and had produced this byproduct. This began many months long arguments with the various levels of government, the landowners, and the residents. Eventually, a major cleaning operation was launched costing some $12 million. The current road of Lees Avenue runs from Main Street in the west to where it crosses over the Queensway when it becomes King Edward Avenue. It is a moderately used collector road serving the local community. Lees originally turned into Chapel Street but was realigned in 1993 to turn into King Edward. The original Lees Ave cross over the train tracks (now Queensway) went straight to the edge of the Rideau River. Although just like other streets during the construction of the Queensway. Originally it got split and the northern part of Lees Ave could be accessed via Robinson Ave. As of April 10, 2017 the northern section was renamed to Robinson Ave.https://ottawa.ca/en/city-hall/public-engagement/projects/street-name-and- address-changes See also *List of Ottawa neighbourhoods References Neighbourhoods in Ottawa ","title":"Lees Avenue"},{"id":"1380898","text":"Coal gasification is the process of producing syngas—a mixture consisting primarily of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen (H2), carbon dioxide (CO2), natural gas (CH4), and water vapour (H2O)—from coal and water, air and/or oxygen. Historically, coal was gasified to produce coal gas, also known as \\"town gas\\". Coal gas is combustible and was used for heating and municipal lighting, before the advent of large-scale extraction of natural gas from oil wells. In current practice, large-scale coal gasification installations are primarily for electricity generation, or for production of chemical feedstocks. The hydrogen obtained from coal gasification can be used for various purposes such as making ammonia, powering a hydrogen economy, or upgrading fossil fuels. Alternatively, coal-derived syngas can be converted into transportation fuels such as gasoline and diesel through additional treatment, or into methanol which itself can be used as transportation fuel or fuel additive, or which can be converted into gasoline. Natural gas from coal gasification can be cooled until it liquifies for use as a fuel in the transport sector. History In the past, coal was converted to make coal gas, which was piped to customers to burn for illumination, heating, and cooking. High prices of oil and natural gas are leading to increased interest in \\"BTU Conversion\\" technologies such as gasification, methanation and liquefaction. The Synthetic Fuels Corporation was a U.S. government-funded corporation established in 1980 to create a market for alternatives to imported fossil fuels (such as coal gasification). The corporation was discontinued in 1985. =Early history of coal gas production by carbonization= Gas lighting in historical center of Wrocław, Poland The Flemish scientist Jan Baptista van Helmont used the name \\"gas\\" in his Origins of Medicine () to describe his discovery of a \\"wild spirit\\" which escaped from heated wood and coal, and which \\"differed little from the chaos of the ancients\\". Similar experiments were carried out in 1681 by Johann Becker of Munich and in 1684 by John Clayton of Wigan, England. The latter called it \\"Spirit of the Coal\\". William Murdoch (later known as Murdock) discovered new ways of making, purifying and storing gas. Among others, he illuminated his house at Redruth and his cottage at Soho, Birmingham in 1792, the entrance to the Manchester Police Commissioners premises in 1797, the exterior of the factory of Boulton and Watt in Birmingham, and a large cotton mill in Salford, Lancashire in 1805. Professor Jan Pieter Minckeleers lit his lecture room at the University of Louvain in 1783 and Lord Dundonald lit his house at Culross, Scotland, in 1787, the gas being carried in sealed vessels from the local tar works. In France, Philippe le Bon patented a gas fire in 1799 and demonstrated street lighting in 1801. Other demonstrations followed in France and in the United States, but, it is generally recognized that the first commercial gas works was built by the London and Westminster Gas Light and Coke Company in Great Peter Street in 1812 laying wooden pipes to illuminate Westminster Bridge with gas lights on New Year's Eve in 1813. In 1816, Rembrandt Peale and four others established the Gas Light Company of Baltimore, the first manufactured gas company in America. In 1821, natural gas was being used commercially in Fredonia, New York. The first German gas works was built in Hannover in 1825 and by 1870 there were 340 gas works in Germany making town gas from coal, wood, peat and other materials. Working conditions in the Gas Light and Coke Company's Horseferry Road Works, London, in the 1830s were described by a French visitor, Flora Tristan, in her Promenades Dans Londres: > Two rows of furnaces on each side were fired up; the effect was not unlike > the description of Vulcan's forge, except that the Cyclopes were animated > with a divine spark, whereas the dusky servants of the English furnaces were > joyless, silent and benumbed.... The foreman told me that stokers were > selected from among the strongest, but that nevertheless they all became > consumptive after seven or eight years of toil and died of pulmonary > consumption. That explained the sadness and apathy in the faces and every > movement of the hapless men.Tristan, Flora (1840) Promenades Dans Londres. > Trans. Palmer, D, and Pincetl, G.

The first public piped gas supply was to 13 gas lamps, each with three glass globes along the length of Pall Mall, London in 1807. The credit for this goes to the inventor and entrepreneur Fredrick Winsor and the plumber Thomas Sugg, who made and laid the pipes. Digging up streets to lay pipes required legislation and this delayed the development of street lighting and gas for domestic use. Meanwhile, William Murdoch and his pupil Samuel Clegg were installing gas lighting in factories and work places, encountering no such impediments. =Early history of coal gas production by gasification= In the 1850s every small to medium-sized town and city had a gas plant to provide for street lighting. Subscribing customers could also have piped lines to their houses. By this era, gas lighting became accepted. Gaslight trickled down to the middle class and later came gas cookers and stoves.e.g., see Powering Progress, NYSEG's 150 Years of Energy and Enterprise, by David L. Yetter, 2003, New York State Electric and Gas Corporation. This source documents the rapid growth of local gas and electric utilities to provide light, and later other uses, in Upstate New York in the last half of the 19th century. The 1860s were the golden age of coal gas development. Scientists like Kekulé and Perkin cracked the secrets of organic chemistry to reveal how gas is made and its composition. From this came better gas plants and Perkin's purple dyes, such as Mauveine. In the 1850s, processes for making Producer gas and Water gas from coke were developed. Unenriched water gas may be described as Blue water gas (BWG). Mond gas, developed in the 1850s by Ludwig Mond, was producer gas made from coal instead of coke. It contained ammonia and coal tar and was processed to recover these valuable compounds. Blue water gas (BWG) burns with a non-luminous flame which makes it unsuitable for lighting purposes. Carburetted Water Gas (CWG), developed in the 1860s, is BWG enriched with gases obtained by spraying oil into a hot retort. It has a higher calorific value and burns with a luminous flame. The carburetted water gas process was improved by Thaddeus S. C. Lowe in 1875. The gas oil was fixed into the BWG via thermocracking in the carburettor and superheater of the CWG generating set. CWG was the dominant technology in the US from the 1880s until the 1950s, replacing coal gasification. CWG has a CV of 20 MJ/m3 i.e. slightly more than half that of natural gas. =Development of the coal gas industry in the UK= The advent of incandescent gas lighting in factories, homes and in the streets, replacing oil lamps and candles with steady clear light, almost matching daylight in its colour, turned night into day for many—making night shift work possible in industries where light was all important—in spinning, weaving and making up garments etc. The social significance of this change is difficult for generations brought up with lighting after dark available at the touch of a switch to appreciate. Not only was industrial production accelerated, but streets were made safe, social intercourse facilitated and reading and writing made more widespread. Gas works were built in almost every town, main streets were brightly illuminated and gas was piped in the streets to the majority of urban households. The invention of the gas meter and the pre-payment meter in the late 1880s played an important role in selling town gas to domestic and commercial customers. 1934 gas cooker in England The education and training of the large workforce, the attempts to standardise manufacturing and commercial practices and the moderating of commercial rivalry between supply companies prompted the founding of associations of gas managers, first in Scotland in 1861. A British Association of Gas Managers was formed in 1863 in Manchester and this, after a turbulent history, became the foundation of the Institute of Gas Engineers (IGE). In 1903, the reconstructed Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) initiated courses for students of gas manufacture in the City and Guilds of London Institute. The IGE was granted the Royal Charter in 1929. Universities were slow to respond to the needs of the industry and it was not until 1908 that the first Professorship of Coal Gas and Fuel Industries was founded at the University of Leeds. In 1926, the Gas Light and Coke Company opened Watson House adjacent to Nine Elms Gas Works.Everard, Stirling (1949). The History of the Gas Light and Coke Company 1812-1949. London: Ernest Benn Limited. (Reprinted 1992, London: A&C; Black (Publishers) Limited for the London Gas Museum. ) Chapter XX, Sir David Milne- Watson, Bart.: I. Expansion. At first, this was a scientific laboratory. Later it included a centre for training apprentices but its major contribution to the industry was its gas appliance testing facilities, which were made available to the whole industry, including gas appliance manufacturers. Using this facility, the industry established not only safety but also performance standards for both the manufacture of gas appliances and their servicing in customers' homes and commercial premises. During World War I, the gas industry's by-products, phenol, toluene and ammonia and sulphurous compounds were valuable ingredients for explosives. Much coal for the gas works was shipped by sea and was vulnerable to enemy attack. The gas industry was a large employer of clerks, mainly male before the war. But the advent of the typewriter and the female typist made another important social change that was, unlike the employment of women in war-time industry, to have long-lasting effects. The inter-war years were marked by the development of the continuous vertical retort which replaced many of the batch fed horizontal retorts. There were improvements in storage, especially the waterless gas holder, and distribution with the advent of 2–4inch steel pipes to convey gas at up to as feeder mains compared to the traditional cast iron pipes working at an average of 2–3inches water gauge (500–750 Pa). Benzole as a vehicle fuel and coal tar as the main feedstock for the emerging organic chemical industry provided the gas industry with substantial revenues. Petroleum supplanted coal tar as the primary feedstock of the organic chemical industry after World War II and the loss of this market contributed to the economic problems of the gas industry after the war. A wide variety of appliances and uses for gas developed over the years. Gas fires, gas cookers, refrigerators, washing machines, hand irons, pokers for lighting coal fires, gas-heated baths, remotely controlled clusters of gas lights, gas engines of various types and, in later years, gas warm air and hot water central heating and air conditioning, all of which made immense contributions to the improvement of the quality of life in cities and towns worldwide. The evolution of electric lighting made available from public supply extinguished the gas light, except where colour matching was practised as in haberdashery shops. Process Scheme of a Lurgi gasifier During gasification, the coal is blown through with oxygen and steam (water vapor) while also being heated (and in some cases pressurized). If the coal is heated by external heat sources the process is called \\"allothermal\\", while \\"autothermal\\" process assumes heating of the coal via exothermal chemical reactions occurring inside the gasifier itself. It is essential that the oxidizer supplied is insufficient for complete oxidizing (combustion) of the fuel. During the reactions mentioned, oxygen and water molecules oxidize the coal and produce a gaseous mixture of carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), water vapour (H2O), and molecular hydrogen (H2). (Some by-products like tar, phenols, etc. are also possible end products, depending on the specific gasification technology utilized.) This process has been conducted in-situ within natural coal seams (referred to as underground coal gasification) and in coal refineries. The desired end product is usually syngas (i.e., a combination of H2 \\\\+ CO), but the produced coal gas may also be further refined to produce additional quantities of H2: : 3C (i.e., coal) + O2 \\\\+ H2O → H2 \\\\+ 3CO If the refiner wants to produce alkanes (i.e., hydrocarbons present in natural gas, gasoline, and diesel fuel), the coal gas is collected at this state and routed to a Fischer-Tropsch reactor. If, however, hydrogen is the desired end-product, the coal gas (primarily the CO product) undergoes the water gas shift reaction where more hydrogen is produced by additional reaction with water vapor: : CO + H2O → CO2 \\\\+ H2 Although other technologies for coal gasification currently exist, all employ, in general, the same chemical processes. For low-grade coals (i.e., \\"brown coals\\") which contain significant amounts of water, there are technologies in which no steam is required during the reaction, with coal (carbon) and oxygen being the only reactants. As well, some coal gasification technologies do not require high pressures. Some utilize pulverized coal as fuel while others work with relatively large fractions of coal. Gasification technologies also vary in the way the blowing is supplied. \\"Direct blowing\\" assumes the coal and the oxidizer being supplied towards each other from the opposite sides of the reactor channel. In this case the oxidizer passes through coke and (more likely) ashes to the reaction zone where it interacts with coal. The hot gas produced then passes fresh fuel and heats it while absorbing some products of thermal destruction of the fuel, such as tars and phenols. Thus, the gas requires significant refining before being used in the Fischer-Tropsch reaction. Products of the refinement are highly toxic and require special facilities for their utilization. As a result, the plant utilizing the described technologies has to be very large to be economically efficient. One of such plants called SASOL is situated in the Republic of South Africa (RSA). It was built due to embargo applied to the country preventing it from importing oil and natural gas. RSA is rich in Bituminous coal and Anthracite and was able to arrange the use of the well known high pressure \\"Lurgi\\" gasification process developed in Germany in the first half of 20th century. \\"Reversed blowing\\" (as compared to the previous type described which was invented first) assumes the coal and the oxidizer being supplied from the same side of the reactor. In this case there is no chemical interaction between coal and oxidizer before the reaction zone. The gas produced in the reaction zone passes solid products of gasification (coke and ashes), and CO2 and H2O contained in the gas are additionally chemically restored to CO and H2. As compared to the \\"direct blowing\\" technology, no toxic by-products are present in the gas: those are disabled in the reaction zone. This type of gasification has been developed in the first half of 20th century, along with the \\"direct blowing\\", but the rate of gas production in it is significantly lower than that in \\"direct blowing\\" and there were no further efforts of developing the \\"reversed blowing\\" processes until 1980-s when a Soviet research facility KATEKNIIUgol' (R&D; Institute for developing Kansk-Achinsk coal field) began R&D; activities to produce the technology now known as \\"TERMOKOKS-S\\" process. The reason for reviving the interest in this type of gasification process is that it is ecologically clean and able to produce two types of useful products (simultaneously or separately): gas (either combustible or syngas) and middle- temperature coke. The former may be used as a fuel for gas boilers and diesel- generators or as syngas for producing gasoline, etc., the latter - as a technological fuel in metallurgy, as a chemical absorbent or as raw material for household fuel briquettes. Combustion of the product gas in gas boilers is ecologically cleaner than combustion of initial coal. Thus, a plant utilizing gasification technology with the \\"reversed blowing\\" is able to produce two valuable products of which one has relatively zero production cost since the latter is covered by competitive market price of the other. As the Soviet Union and its KATEKNIIUgol' ceased to exist, the technology was adopted by the individual scientists who originally developed it and is now being further researched in Russia and commercially distributed worldwide. Industrial plants utilizing it are now known to function in Ulaan-Baatar (Mongolia) and Krasnoyarsk (Russia). Pressurized airflow bed gasification technology created through the joint development between Wison Group and Shell (Hybrid). For example: Hybrid is an advanced pulverized coal gasification technology, this technology combined with the existing advantages of Shell SCGP waste heat boiler, includes more than just a conveying system, pulverized coal pressurized gasification burner arrangement, lateral jet burner membrane type water wall, and the intermittent discharge has been fully validated in the existing SCGP plant such as mature and reliable technology, at the same time, it removed the existing process complications and in the syngas cooler (waste pan) and [fly ash] filters which easily failed, and combined the current existing gasification technology that is widely used in synthetic gas quench process. It not only retains the original Shell SCGP waste heat boiler of coal characteristics of strong adaptability, and ability to scale up easily, but also absorb the advantages of the existing quench technology. =Underground coal gasification= Underground coal gasification (UCG) is an industrial gasification process, which is carried out in non-mined coal seams. It involves injection of a gaseous oxidizing agent, usually oxygen or air, and bringing the resulting product gas to the surface through production wells drilled from the surface. The product gas can be used as a chemical feedstock or as fuel for power generation. The technique can be applied to resources that are otherwise not economical to extract. It also offers an alternative to conventional coal mining methods. Compared to traditional coal mining and gasification, UCG has less environmental and social impact, though environmental concerns exist, including the potential for aquifer contamination. =Carbon capture technology= Carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration (or storage) is increasingly being utilized in modern coal gasification projects to address the greenhouse gas emissions concern associated with the use of coal and carbonaceous fuels. In this respect, gasification has a significant advantage over conventional combustion of mined coal, in which CO2 resulting from combustion is considerably diluted by nitrogen and residual oxygen in the near-ambient pressure combustion exhaust, making it relatively difficult, energy-intensive, and expensive to capture the CO2 (this is known as “post-combustion” CO2 capture). In gasification, on the other hand, oxygen is normally supplied to the gasifiers and just enough fuel is combusted to provide the heat to gasify the rest; moreover, gasification is often performed at elevated pressure. The resulting syngas is typically at higher pressure and not diluted by nitrogen, allowing for much easier, efficient, and less costly removal of CO2. Gasification and integrated gasification combined cycle's unique ability to easily remove CO2 from the syngas prior to its combustion in a gas turbine (called \\"pre-combustion\\" CO2 capture) or its use in fuels or chemicals synthesis is one of its significant advantages over conventional coal utilization systems. CO2 capture technology options All coal gasification-based conversion processes require removal of hydrogen sulfide (H2S; an acid gas) from the syngas as part of the overall plant configuration. Typical acid gas removal (AGR) processes employed for gasification design are either a chemical solvent system (e.g., amine gas treating systems based on MDEA, for example) or a physical solvent system (e.g., Rectisol or Selexol). Process selection is mostly dependent on the syngas cleanup requirement and costs. Conventional chemical/physical AGR processes using MDEA, Rectisol or Selexol are commercially proven technologies and can be designed for selective removal of CO2 in addition to H2S from a syngas stream. For significant capture of CO2 from a gasification plant (e.g. > 80%) the CO in the syngas must first be converted to CO2 and hydrogen (H2) via a water-gas-shift (WGS) step upstream of the AGR plant. For gasification applications, or Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC), the plant modifications required to add the ability to capture CO2 are minimal. The syngas produced by the gasifiers needs to be treated through various processes for the removal of impurities already in the gas stream, so all that is required to remove CO2 is to add the necessary equipment, an absorber and regenerator, to this process train. In combustion applications, modifications must be made to the exhaust stack and because of the lower concentrations of CO2 present in the exhaust, much larger volumes of total gas require processing, necessitating larger and more expensive equipment. IGCC (Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle) based projects in the United States with CO2 capture and use/storage Mississippi Power's Kemper Project was designed as a lignite-fuel IGCC plant, generating a net 524 MW of power from syngas, while capturing over 65% of CO2 generated using the Selexol process. The technology at the Kemper facility, Transport-Integrated Gasification (TRIG), was developed and is licensed by KBR. The CO2 will be sent by pipeline to depleted oil fields in Mississippi for enhanced oil recovery operations. The plant missed all its targets and plans for \\"clean coal\\" generation were abandoned in July 2017. The plant is expected to go ahead burning natural gas only. Hydrogen Energy California (HECA) will be a 300MW net, coal and petroleum coke-fueled IGCC polygeneration plant (producing hydrogen for both power generation and fertilizer manufacture). Ninety percent of the CO2 produced will be captured (using Rectisol) and transported to Elk Hills Oil Field for EOR, enabling recovery of 5 million additional barrels of domestic oil per year. On March 4, 2016, the California Energy Commission ordered the HECA application to be terminated. Summit's Texas Clean Energy Project (TCEP) will be a coal-fueled, IGCC-based 400MW power/polygeneration project (also producing urea fertilizer), which will capture 90% of its CO2 in pre- combustion using the Rectisol process. The CO2 not used in fertilizer manufacture will be used for enhanced oil recovery in the West Texas Permian Basin. Plants such as the Texas Clean Energy Project which employ carbon capture and storage have been touted as a partial, or interim, solution to climate change issues if they can be made economically viable by improved design and mass production. There has been opposition from utility regulators and ratepayers due to increased cost; and from environmentalists such as Bill McKibben, who view any continued use of fossil fuels as counterproductive. By-products The by-products of coal gas manufacture included coke, coal tar, sulfur and ammonia; all useful products. Dyes, medicines, including sulfa drugs, saccharin and many organic compounds are therefore derived from coal gas. Coke is used as a smokeless fuel and for the manufacture of water gas and producer gas. Coal tar is subjected to fractional distillation to recover various products, including * tar, for road surfacing * benzole, a motor fuel * creosote, a wood preservative * phenol, used in the manufacture of plastics * cresols, disinfectants Sulfur is used in the manufacture of sulfuric acid and ammonia is used in the manufacture of fertilisers. Commercialization According to the Gasification and Syngas Technologies Council, a trade association, there are globally 272 operating gasification plants with 686 gasifiers and 74 plants with 238 gasifiers under construction. Most of them use coal as feedstock. As of 2017 large scale expansion of the coal gasification industry was occurring only in China where local governments and energy companies promote the industry to provide jobs and a market for coal. For the most part, the plants are located in remote, coal-rich areas. The central government is aware of the conflicts with environmental goals: in addition to producing a great deal of carbon dioxide, the plants use a great deal of water in areas where water is scarce. Environmental impact =Environmental impact of manufactured coal gas industry= Gasometer at West Ham, United Kingdom From its original development until the wide-scale adoption of natural gas, more than 50,000 manufactured gas plants were in existence in the United States alone. The process of manufacturing gas usually produced a number of by-products that contaminated the soil and groundwater in and around the manufacturing plant, so many former town gas plants are a serious environmental concern, and cleanup and remediation costs are often high. Manufactured gas plants (MGPs) were typically sited near or adjacent to waterways that were used to transport in coal and for the discharge of wastewater contaminated with tar, ammonia and/or drip oils, as well as outright waste tars and tar-water emulsions. In the earliest days of MGP operations, coal tar was considered a waste and often disposed into the environment in and around the plant locations. While uses for coal tar developed by the late-19th century, the market for tar varied and plants that could not sell tar at a given time could store tar for future use, attempt to burn it as boiler fuel, or dump the tar as waste. Commonly, waste tars were disposed of in old gas holders, adits or even mine shafts (if present). Over time, the waste tars degrade with phenols, benzene (and other mono- aromatics—BTEX) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons released as pollutant plumes that can escape into the surrounding environment. Other wastes included \\"blue billy\\", which is a ferroferricyanide compound—the blue colour is from Prussian blue, which was commercially used as a dye. Blue billy is typically a granular material and was sometimes sold locally with the strap line \\"guaranteed weed free drives\\". The presence of blue billy can give gas works waste a characteristic musty/bitter almonds or marzipan smell which is associated with cyanide gas. The shift to the Carburetted Water Gas process initially resulted in a reduced output of water gas tar as compared to the volume of coal tars. The advent of automobiles reduced the availability of naphtha for carburetion oil, as that fraction was desirable as motor fuel. MGPs that shifted to heavier grades of oil often experienced problems with the production of tar-water emulsions, which were difficult, time-consuming, and costly to break. (The cause of tar change water emulsions is complex and was related to several factors, including free carbon in the carburetion oil and the substitution of bituminous coal as a feedstock instead of coke.) The production of large volumes of tar-water emulsions quickly filled up available storage capacity at MGPs and plant management often dumped the emulsions in pits, from which they may or may not have been later reclaimed. Even if the emulsions were reclaimed, the environmental damage from placing tars in unlined pits remained. The dumping of emulsions (and other tarry residues such as tar sludges, tank bottoms, and off-spec tars) into the soil and waters around MGPs is a significant factor in the pollution found at former manufactured gas plants (known as \\"FMGPs\\" in environmental remediation) today. Contaminants commonly associated with FMGPs include: *BTEX ** Diffused out from deposits of coal/gas tars ** Leaks of carburetting oil/light oil ** Leaks from drip pots, that collected condensible hydrocarbons from the gas *Coal tar waste/sludge **Typically found in sumps of gas holders and decanting ponds. ** Coal tar sludge has no resale value and so was always dumped. * Volatile organic compounds * Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) ** Present in coal tar, gas tar, and pitch at significant concentrations. *Heavy metals ** Leaded solder for gas mains, lead piping, coal ashes. * Cyanide ** Purifier waste has large amounts of complex ferrocyanides in it. * Lampblack ** Only found where crude oil was used as gasification feedstock. * Tar emulsions Coal tar and coal tar sludges are frequently denser than water and are present in the environment as a dense non-aqueous phase liquid. In the UK, a number of former gasworks sites have been redeveloped for residential and other uses (including the Millennium Dome), being seen as prime developable land within the confines of city boundaries. Such development opportunities are now leading to problems associated with planning and the Contaminated Land Regime and have recently been debated in the House of Commons. =Environmental impact of modern coal gasification= Coal gasification processes require controls and pollution prevention measures to mitigate pollutant emissions.Beychok, M.R., Process and environmentals technology for producing SNG and liquid fuels, U.S, EPA report EPA-660/2-2-75-011, May 1975Beychok, M.R., Coal gasification and the phenolsolvan process, American Chemical Society 168th National Meeting, Atlantic City, September 1974 Pollutants or emissions of concern in the context of coal gasification include primarily: *Ash & slag Non-slagging gasifiers produce dry ash similar to that produced by conventional coal combustion, which can be an environmental liability if the ash (typically containing heavy metals) is leachable or caustic, and if the ash must be stored in ash ponds. Slagging gasifiers, which are utilized at many of the major coal gasification applications worldwide, have considerable advantage in that ash components are fused into a glassy slag, capturing trace heavy metals in the non-leachable glassy matrix, rendering the material non-toxic. This non-hazardous slag has multiple beneficial uses such as aggregate in concrete, aggregate in asphalt for road construction, grit in abrasive blasting, roofing granules, etc.Chris Higman and Maarten van der Burgt. Gasification, Second Edition, Elsevier (2008). *Carbon dioxide (CO2) CO2 is of paramount importance in global climate change. *Mercury *Arsenic *Particulate matter (PM) Ash is formed in gasification from inorganic impurities in the coal. Some of these impurities react to form microscopic solids which can be suspended in the syngas produced by gasification. *Sulfur dioxide (SO2) Typically coal contains anywhere from 0.2 to 5 percent sulfur by dry weight, which converts to H2S and COS in the gasifiers due to the high temperatures and low oxygen levels. These \\"acid gases\\" are removed from the syngas produced by the gasifiers by acid gas removal equipment prior to the syngas being burned in the gas turbine to produce electricity, or prior to its use in fuels synthesis. *Nitrogen oxides (NOx) (NOx) refers to nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Coal usually contains between 0.5 and 3 percent nitrogen on a dry weight basis, most of which converts to harmless nitrogen gas. Small levels of ammonia and hydrogen cyanide are produced, and must be removed during the syngas cooling process. In the case of power generation, NOx also can be formed downstream by the combustion of syngas in turbines.

The film is based on Sarah Dessen's novels That Summer and Someone like You. Plot Halley Martin (Mandy Moore) is a 17-year-old high school student who is disillusioned with love after seeing many dysfunctional relationships around her. Her parents are now divorced and her father, Len Martin (Peter Gallagher), a radio talk show host, has a new young girlfriend that the entire family despises. Her mother, Lydia (Allison Janney), is now always alone while her sister, Ashley, is so overwhelmed by her upcoming wedding with Lewis Warsher that she barely exists in the house. The shallowness of all the teens at her school convinces Halley that finding true love is impossible. When Halley walks in on her best friend Scarlett having sex with her boyfriend, the high school soccer champ, Michael Sherwood, Halley tries to warn her of the complications that lie ahead. Ignoring her advice, Scarlett embarks on a summer fling with Michael. In the meantime, Halley must deal with Ashley and the rest of the Martins must deal with her soon-to-be in-laws, Lewis' overbearing Southern parents, who have an African American maid. In the meantime, Halley runs into classmate Macon Forrester, a slacker who never shows up for biology and is more interested in having fun than school work. He is Michael Sherwood's best friend. Then a few weeks later, Michael dies of a heart defect on the soccer field while Halley, Scarlett and other classmates watch helplessly. This event changes the lives of Halley and Scarlett forever. While Scarlett does her best to look beautiful for Michael at his funeral, Macon gives a moving speech about his friend. Struggling with Michael's death, Scarlett, at age sixteen, soon learns that she is pregnant with his child. With Halley at her side, Scarlett reveals the pregnancy to her mother. Halley's father, Len Martin, marries his mistress, Lorna, in a beach-side ceremony, with guests from all over the world, or \\"within his radio frequency\\", as Halley puts it. Halley and Macon eventually start a relationship. He takes her to his and Michael's favorite hangout and once come close to having sex. Halley and her mother get into an argument and on New Year's Eve, Halley sneaks out with Macon to a party. Again, they come very close to having sex but this time Halley stops it and Macon is upset. On their way home, they are both upset and distracted and hit a tree. Halley gets a broken arm, but otherwise they both walk away from it unharmed, but Halley breaks up with Macon saying that she can't wait around for him to grow up. Later things go awry when Halley finds Ashley drunk on the family's front porch. Finding a male stripper's thong around her neck, Halley witnesses the break-up of her sister's engagement. She also learns that her mother sneaks out once a week to have sex with a man she met a couple of weeks previously, Steve. After another make-up, Lewis proposes to Ashley again, this time at a crowded airport: she says yes. On the day of Ashley and Lewis' wedding, Macon bursts into Len's radio studio, professing his apologies and love to Halley. He then heads to the wedding. On the way, he finds Scarlett, who insisted on walking to the wedding, going into labor on the side of the road. He puts her in the car and walks into the wedding, getting Halley's attention. The three rush to the hospital, leaving Scarlett's mother behind in the rush. While Scarlett is having her baby, Halley makes a list of all the little things she hates about Macon, the way his hair falls over his face, the way his voice gets low when he's serious, the way he bites his lip when he's nervous and the way his eyebrow twitches. Halley playfully uses Macon's 'Jedi Mind Trick' and they kiss and dance briefly in the hallway. The movie ends as Halley and Macon embrace and viewers see that Scarlett gave birth to a baby girl.

The song was originally released in May, 1980, as the B-side of the \\"Holiday in Cambodia\\" single and later released in June 1987 as the opening track on their compilation album, Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death. The song is a satirical attack on the actions of two police officers, and takes a first person view from the authorities themselves. The song was inspired by an incident that occurred in Oakland in the late 1970s.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCQ9IwrhwJY&list;=PL636ABE10C3CCC992&index;=85&t;=0s It also functions more generally as an attack on police corruption and brutality and the police's support for a capitalist p164 system. The song was one of the Kennedys' early popular songs. \\"Police Truck\\" is built around a surf rock beat (similar to ones heard in the early instrumental surf singles such as the Chantays' \\"Pipeline\\"), and highlighted by East Bay Ray's echoed guitar leads and the descending chorus \\"ride, ride, how we ride.\\" \\"Police Truck\\", like many of the band's songs, serves as an example of the Dead Kennedys' ability to portray a disturbing scenario through humorous lyrics. The song appears in the 2020 movie, “The Babysitter: Killer Queen. In popular culture The song appeared in the soundtrack of the popular skateboarding video game Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, after being licensed by the former Dead Kennedys. This licensing caused criticism from many Dead Kennedys fans, who used it to assert that East Bay Ray, Klaus Flouride, and D.H. Peligro are no longer committed to the band's anti-corporate beliefs, unlike vocalist Jello Biafra; however, Alternative Tentacles gave approval for the song to appear in the game. Biafra denies that this happened. The song appears as a cover in the game Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s with altered lyrics (The word \\"drunks\\" at the beginning of the song is replaced by \\"punks\\", while \\"ass\\" is replaced by \\"butt\\", \\"shit\\" is replaced by \\"stool\\" and \\"suck my dick\\" is replaced by \\"take your pick\\").

The scientific name of this bird commemorates the French naturalist Florent Prévost.  Description  Adults of this medium-sized hummingbird species are 11–12 cm in length. Males average 7.2 g, females, 6.8 g. The longish black bill is slightly decurved. The tail in both sexes has dark central feathers. In adult males, the outer tail feathers are deep magenta to wine purple tipped with black. In females and juvenile males, the outer tail feathers are broadly banded in magenta and iridescent dark blue, with narrow white tips on the outer 3–4 feathers. Rancho Naturalista - Costa Rica (flash photo) The adult male has glossy bright green upperparts. His throat and chest have a relatively narrow matte black central area, bordered with blue-green. The flanks are bright green, and the black of the chest tapers onto the belly. Female - Rancho Naturalista - Costa Rica (flash photo) Females and immature males have bronze-green upperparts and largely white underparts with a dark central stripe that changes from black at the chin to blue-green on the throat. Immature birds of both sexes usually show some gray or buff feather edges on the head and wings and are mottled with cinnamon to rusty brown along the edges of the white breast-belly stripe. Immature females have less extensive magenta in the outer tail feathers than adult females or immature males. The call of the green-breasted mango is a high-pitched ', and the song is a buzzing '. This species is very similar to the closely related black-throated mango. Although the male green-breasted mango has less extensive black on the underparts, this and other plumage differences are not always easy to confirm in the field because the birds appear all-black. The females of the two species can be almost inseparable, although green-breasted has more extensively coppery upperpart tones than its relative.  Distribution and ecology  This species breeds from eastern and southern Mexico south through Central America, including some near-shore islands, to Costa Rica. In western and central Panama, it is replaced by the possibly conspecific Veraguan mango Anthracothorax veraguensis. Disjunct populations occur along the northern coast of South America from extreme northeastern Colombia through northernmost Venezuela, in the upper Cauca River Valley of southwestern Colombia, and on the coastal slope of southwestern Ecuador and extreme northwestern Peru. The species is partially migratory, occupying its breeding range in northeastern Mexico (southwestern Tamaulipas and eastern San Luis Potosí to southern Veracruz and extreme western Tabasco) from late February through September. Other movements are poorly understood, but the wide separation of populations in South America suggests a species-wide propensity to travel and/or a more continuous distribution during periods when South America's climate was warmer and drier. Young birds are responsible for the majority of occurrences in the United States. The first green-breasted mango documented north of Mexico was photographed in coastal Texas in September 1988. The species has since become an increasingly frequent vagrant and extremely rare resident in the lower Rio Grande Valley of southern Texas. Only three individuals have been documented in the U.S. outside Texas, all visiting feeders at private homes: a juvenile male in Concord, North Carolina in November 2000, a juvenile male in Beloit, Wisconsin first identified in September 2007, and a juvenile bird, possibly a male, in Dublin, Georgia, in October 2007.Green-breasted Mango: October 29, 2007.

Neighbors of the Wisconsin bird's hosts report that the bird had been visiting their feeders since late July. On November 5, 2007, the Beloit green-breasted mango was captured to prevent its death from winter weather. Against the advice of hummingbird experts, the bird was transferred from the Wildlife Rehabilitation Center of the Wisconsin Humane Society to the Brookfield Zoo, near Chicago, which elected to confine the bird permanently with five hummingbirds already in its Perching Bird House. The species inhabits tropical deciduous forest, open landscapes with scattered large trees, orchards, gardens, and cultivated areas, but its distribution is spotty and often localized. Like all hummingbirds, it feeds on insects and other invertebrates and nectar. Prey is often taken in mid-air but may also be gleaned from vegetation or stolen from spider webs (a behavior known as kleptoparasitism). Favorite nectar sources include the flowers of large trees such as Inga, Erythrina, and Ceiba or kapok. The female green-breasted mango lays two white eggs in a tiny cup nest on a high, thin, and usually bare, branch. The exterior of the nest is camouflaged with chips of lichen and other plant fragments. Incubation by the female is 16 to 17 days, and the nestling period lasts another 24. At a green-breasted mango nest on San Andrés Island (Caribbean), it was noted that the tree was beset with Pseudomyrmex stinging ants. This was also noted at a black-throated mango nest in Cuyabeno Faunistic Reserve, Ecuador. It is likely that the ants would deter predators, but it is not known whether the birds deliberately select such trees for nesting.Greeney & Merino M. (2006)  Conservation status  The green-breasted mango has been evaluated by the World Conservation Union, a.k.a. International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) and categorized as a species of Least Concern. The species is not currently protected in the U.S. under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Proposed revisions to the act, published in the Federal Register on August 24, 2006,General Provisions; Revised List of Migratory Birds Federal Register Environmental Documents  USEPA. Epa.gov. Retrieved on November 20, 2011. would extend protection to this and 85 other species of accidental or casual occurrence in the United States, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands. The revisions had not been approved as of November 2007, which allowed the capture and permanent captivity of the Wisconsin green-breasted mango to proceed without federal approval.

The ruling was announced December 2004, following arguments made two months prior. Background Prior to this case the issue regarding the constitutional validity of same-sex marriage had been considered by several of the provinces' appellate courts, all of them holding that it was constitutionally valid. In response to this, the Government of Canada submitted three questions to the Supreme Court regarding the validity of the proposed same-sex marriage legislation (the Proposal for an Act respecting certain aspects of legal capacity for marriage for civil purposes): :1. Is the proposal for the Act within the authority of Parliament? If not, to what extent? :2. If so, is section 1 of the proposed Act consistent with the Charter? If not, to what extent? :3. Does section 2(a) of the Charter, guaranteeing freedom of religion, protect religious officials who do not believe in same-sex marriage? Later, an additional question was added: :4. Is the opposite-sex requirement established in the common law and Quebec law consistent with the Charter? If not, to what extent? Opinion of the court The court responded to the questions as such: :1. With respect to s. 1: Yes. With respect to s. 2: No. :2. Yes. :3. Yes. :4. The Court exercises its discretion not to answer this question. The Court began by considering the argument that the questions are not justiciable (i.e. lacks sufficient legal content, or where the nature of the question or the information provided does not permit the Court to give a complete or accurate answer) based on it being a political question. The Court resolutely dismissed this claim for these political considerations provide the context for, rather than the substance of, the questions before the Court, as in the Quebec Secession Reference. The first question required the court to determine which head of power the law falls under. It was clearly determined that the pith and substance of the law was federal as it concerned marriage which is in the absolute federal jurisdiction under section 91(26) of the Constitution Act, 1867. The Court then considered the impact of the common law definition of marriage on the new law. The applicable definition was from Hyde v. Hyde (1866) a polygamy case where Lord Penzance stated: > What, then, is the nature of this institution as understood in > Christendom?...If it be of common acceptance and existence, it must needs > have some pervading identity and universal basis. I conceive that marriage, > as understood in Christendom, may for this purpose be defined as the > voluntary union for life of one man and one woman, to the exclusion of all > others. The Court rejected this definition by applying the living tree doctrine used in the famous Persons case, analogizing the exclusion of women from the common law definition of \\"persons\\" to that of same-sex couples. The interveners had argued that the meaning of marriage is fixed into convention beyond the reach of the constitution as its old meaning is in practice for thousands of years across the entire globe. Moreover, they argued that the living tree doctrine is constrained within the \\"natural limits\\" of interpretation and cannot be stretched to anything the court would like it to be. The Court rejected these claims, stating that they were not trying to find the definition of marriage, but were only examining whether a proposed meaning was within the definition. The meaning of marriage is not fixed to what it meant in 1867, but rather it must evolve with Canadian society which currently represents a plurality of groups. However, the Court made sure to say that the legislation was only concerning \\"civil marriage as a legal institution\\" and has no effect on religious marriage. Section 2 of the Act was considered to be ultra vires to Parliament, as it's pith and substance related to who may (or must) perform marriages and falls within the subject matter allocated to the provinces under s. 92(12). On considering the second question, the Court not only affirmed the validity of the legislation, they added that its purpose \\"flows from\\" the Charter. They further found that equality right of religious groups and opposite-sex couples are not undermined by the legislation, on the basis that the expansion of the Charter enriches society, and equality cannot be supported by denial of others from a benefit. When conflicts between rights arise, the Court said, it must be resolved by internal balancing of those rights, not denial of rights. On the third question, the Court found that the religious freedom guarantee will protect those who disagree with performing same-sex marriages and even protect those who disagree with renting religious spaces for the purpose of same-sex marriage. Again, the Court reiterated that it is up to the provinces to legislate protection for religious groups. The Court decided not to answer the fourth question as it served \\"no legal purpose\\". The federal government had already decided not to appeal the Halpren case in Ontario on the very issue and so there was no point examining it again. Also, the court wished to respect the lower-court decisions upholding same-sex marriage by letting them stand. Implications In terms of rights for same sex couples, a few have speculated that this case does not add much. However, by pre-litigating the following Civil Marriage Act, it effectively precluded court challenge of the act, thereby hastening its acceptance.

That garden, VanDusen Botanical Garden, is situated in the Shaughnessy neighbourhood of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada at the North West corner of 37th Avenue and Oak Street. It is named for local lumberman and philanthropist Whitford Julian VanDusen. The Botanical Garden opened to the public on August 30, 1975 and remains jointly managed by the Vancouver Park Board and the Vancouver Botanical Gardens Association (VBGA), similar to the operation of nearby Bloedel Conservatory. An administrative staff is bolstered by approximately 1200 non-gardening volunteers and six full-time unionized gardeners with seasonal interns assisting during the summer. The VBGA is responsible for membership, volunteering, education, the library, and development fundraising. VanDusen's volunteers have a 45-year history in the garden and often exhibit a proprietary connection to the trees, shrubs and annuals. Trained volunteer guides interpret the plant collection and the history of the garden to visitors on foot and in motorized golf carts from April through October (see web site for actual dates, the carts have a limited season). In addition to guiding tours, volunteers collect seeds of annuals and perennials (which they clean and package for sale in the garden shop and on the Internet). Other volunteers operate the information desk, produce dried flower arrangements, staff a large and very successful plant sale each spring, write and produce self-guided tours to hand out to visitors, package manure and compost for sale to local gardeners, and work with Park Board staff to install plant identification signs in the garden. The Garden covers 22 hectares (55 acres). In addition to displays of plants from all over the world, there is an extensive collection of native British Columbia (Northwest Coast) plants. A recently launched \\"re-wilding\\" outreach program aims to rescue and propagate native plants for reintroduction into Vancouver's regional parks. Although the garden's mission statement upholds the ideals of a botanical garden, an early decision not to partake in scientific research channeled funds and energy into garden construction and released the staff from the responsibility of building research collections or a herbarium. The VBGA conducts citizen science initiatives and works with local community partners and schools interested in on-site research. More recently, the garden's Visitor Centre was designed and built to a LEED Platinum standard. Opened in November 2011, this modern structure features a gift/garden shop, a specialized botanical library, a restaurant and a coffee shop. The VanDusen Botanical Garden Visitors Center project, registered with the International Living Future Institute, is pursuing a Living Building Challenge certification. The building was constructed under the direction Cornelia Oberlander landscape architect, Perkins and Will Canada architects, Morrison Hershfield energy consultants, Fast + Epp structural engineers, StructureCraft timber design-builders, and Ledcor Construction Limited. VanDusen Botanical Garden Visitors Center In addition to water features throughout the rolling landscape, special features in the garden include carved totem poles, large stone sculptures, and a Korean Pavilion. Children enjoy the maze adjacent to VanDusen's heirloom vegetable garden. The Education Centre, located at the rear of the garden, houses a seed bank and serves as home to the Vancouver Festival of Lights volunteers, seed collectors, the Sakura Festival staff and the dried flower arrangers. May is Rhodo time at VanDusen and visitors are treated to a large colourful collection of species and hybridized Rhododendron cultivars. The collection is estimated at nearly 1,000 different varieties of rhodos. Some can be found blooming virtually year round, with intense blooms of species rhodos in the Sino Himalayan garden in the late months of winter. Also of note are cultivars of Fagus sylvatica, as well as collections of Sorbus, Fraxinus and Magnolia. Specialized niche plantings include a Heather garden, a \\"black\\" garden, a seasonal \\"Laburnum Walk\\", a majestic stand of Sequoiadendron giganteum, a cypress pond, a formal perennial garden, a heritage vegetable garden (seasonal), a fragrance garden (seasonal) of course, and the large sino- Himalayan garden which covers about eight acres by itself. In recognition of the extensive and timeless design work that makes VanDusen the pride of Vancouver's gardeners, R. Roy Forster was recognized with the Order of Canada on April 14, 1999, for his work in designing the gardens and their plant collections. Forester continued earlier landscape work established by Bill Livingston of the Vancouver Park Board. Appreciation for Forster's contribution to the design of the garden was recognized recently by VBGA renaming Cypress Pond the Roy Forster Pond. The garden is open to the public every day of the year except Christmas. There are admission fees for day visitors and memberships (family and individual) for repeat visitors.

In 1996, he publicly accused Kathie Lee Gifford of being responsible for sweatshop conditions in the manufacturing of her Wal-Mart clothing line. She responded on the air by explaining that she was a celebrity endorser and not involved with hands-on project management in manufacturing plants.Kathie Lee Gifford's clothing line and its connection to sweatshop work Kernaghan alleged during congressional testimony that child laborers in Honduras and New York City were making clothing lines under the names of Gifford and other celebrities.\\"Keeper of the Fire\\", Mother Jones, July/August 2003 Gifford engaged the White House as well and worked with President Bill Clinton to address the situation.\\"Companies agree to meet on 'sweatshops'.

His best known works include a series of novels set in Graustark, a fictional East European country, and the novel Brewster's Millions, which was adapted into a play and several films. Life McCutcheon was born in Tippecanoe County, Indiana. His father, despite his own lack of formal education, stressed the value of literature and encouraged his sons to write. During McCutcheon's childhood, his father had a number of jobs that required travel around the county. McCutcheon studied at Purdue University and was a roommate of future humorist George Ade. During his college years, he was editor of the newspaper Lafayette Daily Courier and wrote a serial novel of satire about Wabash River life. Although McCutcheon became famous for the Graustark series (the first novel was published in 1901), he disliked the characterization of being a Romantic and preferred to be identified with his playwriting. He was the older brother of noted cartoonist John T. McCutcheon and died in Manhattan, New York City, New York. McCutcheon, along with a number of other Indiana authors of the same period, is considered to be part of the Golden Age of Indiana Literature.Boomhower, Ray.

In 1967, Cleaver enrolled at Stanford University to begin a Ph.D. in economics. While at Stanford, Cleaver was active in the Anti-war Movement. As a student activist opposed to the Vietnam War, Cleaver protested the Stanford Research Institute's alleged connection to the United States Department of Defense, which became the impetus for his dissertation research into the connections between the Green Revolution and social engineering. Cleaver's frustrations with mainstream economic theory during this period in his studies led him to embrace Marxism. Career =Teaching= In 1971, Cleaver was hired as an assistant professor at the Université de Sherbrooke in Montreal, Quebec where he taught for three years, finished his dissertation, and studied Québécois nationalism.

The Goreng Goreng area is between Baffle Creek to Agnes Water in the north, extending westerly as far as Kroombit Tops. Language Gurang Gurang, is member of the Waka-Kabic subgroup of the Pama–Nyungan languages. The word gurang means \\"nought\\", and, replicated, was used as a marker for the people. Despite the tribe's relative proximity to Rockhampton, Gureng gureng language had strong affinities to languages to its south such as Wakka Wakka and Gubbi Gubbi, an affinity that was also cultural. Country Map of Traditional Lands of Aboriginal Australians around Brisbane. The precise borders of traditional Goreng Goreng lands have been disputed. Walter Roth, while collecting data on their language in the later 19th century, placed them in Miriam Vale, where their main camp was at that time. Norman Tindale distinguished them from a Goeng people and defined their land as extending over and embracing the eastern bank of the upper Burnett River from Mundubbera north to Monto and Many Peaks. It is possible that a confusion arose, taking two distinct dialect forms of the one cultural complex, to denote distinct and separate realities, with the Gureng Gureng taken to be an inland tribe, and the Goeng (Guweng guweng) denoting their affines on the coast. A recent survey of the available evidence concludes that the Goreng goring's lands encompassed the 'whole of the area of Gladstone east of the ranges. Society and culture The Gureng gureng were divided into several clans, such as the Wakgun. Traditional lore was transmitted at a djaparlagin or a 'singing corroboree'. History of contact The Upper Burnett area first began to be settled by colonists in the 1840s. Grazing land was not available further down the river for some decades. Hostilities broke out as land seized for grazing denied aboriginals access to their food resources, and clashes were frequent, leading to several massacres in the Miriam Vale area. It is estimated that between 1847 and 1853, 28 squatters and shepherds were killed as the Burdekin people resisted the onset of the occupation. On each occasion, punitive raids were undertaken to punish the tribes, causing substantial loss of life among the latter. The severity of retaliation was sufficiently drastic to lead the Colonial Office to place the Burnett area's aborigines under official protection by the Native Mounted Police.

He is also a sports commentator for Danish television and is represented by the film production company Sunset Productions. Early life Born on 14 June 1937 in Aarhus, Denmark, Leth studied literature and anthropology in Aarhus and Copenhagen and was a cultural critic (jazz, theatre, film) for leading Danish newspapers from 1959 to 1968. His interest in Polish anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski had a profound influence on his work. He traveled in Africa (1961), South America and India (1966) and Southeast Asia (1970–71). His first book was published in 1962. He has written 10 volumes of poetry and eight non-fiction books. Film career Leth made his first film in 1963 and has since made 40 more, many distributed worldwide. His most acclaimed is a 1967 short, The Perfect Human, which also featured in the 2003 film The Five Obstructions made by Leth and Lars von Trier. Leth's sports documentaries bring an epic, almost mythic, dimension to the field, as seen in Stars and Watercarriers (Stjernerne og Vandbærerne) (1973) and A Sunday in Hell (En forårsdag i helvede) (1977). He has been a creative consultant for the Danish Film Institute (1971–73, 1975–77) as well as chairman of the Institute's board (1977–82). He has also been a professor at the Danish National Film School in Copenhagen, at the State Studiocenter in Oslo and has lectured at UCLA, Berkeley, Harvard and other American universities. Leth covered the Tour de France for Denmark's TV 2 from 1988 until 2005 as the expert commentator in partnership with journalist Jørn Mader, and again from 2009 in partnership with Dennis Ritter and Rolf Sørensen. In 1999, he was appointed Danish honorary consul in Haiti. Controversy He attracted controversy in Denmark after publication of his autobiography Det uperfekte menneske (The Imperfect Human). It included a graphic account of sexual relations with the 17-year-old daughter of his cook in Haiti.DR, Jørgen Leth risikerer fængsel i Haiti for sex med mindreårige Danmark Radio Nyheder, 7 October 2005 This created a media storm in Denmark,Schou, Ann-Jette, Jørgen Leth – en provo? , Danmark Radio Nyheder, 17 August 2007 partly because of his plan to make a film called Det Erotiske Menneske (\\"The Erotic Human\\"), funded by the Danish Film Institute, in collaboration with DR (Danmarks Radio) and Nordisk Film and TV Commission. The controversy upset several groups in Denmark.DR, Jørgen Leth trækker sig fra alle poster, Danmark Radio Nyheder, 7 October 2005 In October 2005, due to the controversy, he resigned his post as Danish consul in Haiti and was dismissed as commentator with TV2, but was reappointed in 2009. Leth then considered to quit finishing his film Erotic Man, but close friend and fellow filmmaker Lars von Trier met with Leth and promised to let himself credit as executive producer on the film, in order to support Leth's artistic work. Erotic Man premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2010. The film received lacklustre reviews which deemed it \\"dirty-old-man cinema\\" and colonialist exploitation. Personal life Leth has been married three times and has four children: Asger (film director), Karoline, Kristian and Tomas. Leth moved to Haiti in the late 1980s and referred to it as his second home. He lived in Jacmel from 1991 until 2010, when the Haiti earthquake destroyed his rented home and most of his possessions. In 2013, Leth was still living in Haiti for about six months of the year, but with friends on the northern coast.

From 1971 to 1996, he was President of Boston University (BU) and, from 1996 to 2002, Chancellor. From 2002 to 2003, he again served as President (Ad Interim); and, from 2003 until his death, he held the title of President Emeritus. In 1990, he won the Democratic gubernatorial primary to become one of two major-party candidates for governor of Massachusetts in the general election of 1990. He lost that election to the Republican William Weld, who won by 38,000 votes.Weld Beats Silber In Tight Governor's Race  News  The Harvard Crimson After receiving his PhD from Yale, Silber became professor of philosophy and served as dean of the University of Texas's College of Arts and Sciences (1967–70). He had a liberal reputation in his days at Texas, though at Boston University he was best known as a conservative spokesman in academia. Family and education Silber was born in San Antonio, Texas,John Silber Feted at Gala Tribute - re> BOSTON, April 13 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ the second son of Paul George Silber, an immigrant architect from Germany, and Jewell (née Joslin) Silber, a Texas- born elementary school teacher. He was born with a malformed right arm that ended in a stump just below his elbow with a rudimentary thumb. Unashamed of the deformity, he had his suits tailored to expose the arm. Both of his parents were Presbyterians. As an adult, he learned that his father's side of the family was Jewish and that his aunt had been killed at Auschwitz. His father had never said anything about it. Silber was a member of the National Honor Society at Jefferson High School in San Antonio, and played trumpet in the school band. He graduated from Jefferson in 1943. At Trinity University in San Antonio, he double-majored in fine arts and philosophy.THE ALCALDE, July/August 2007, p. 30. In the fall of 1943, as a freshman at Trinity, he met a sophomore named Kathryn Underwood, daughter of farmers from Normanna, Texas. The couple were engaged in January 1946 and married on July 12, 1947. Silber graduated summa cum laude from Trinity in June 1947. Silber and his wife had eight children, one son and six daughters by birth and one son by adoption. Their first-born son and daughter were born before 1955. Five more daughters were born over the next eleven years.Boston University News Release March 26, 2005 \\"Kathryn Underwood Silber: Texas Native Was First Lady of Boston University for 25 Years\\" Their first-born son, David Silber, died of AIDS at age 41 at their home in December 1994.\\"Profile: Applying the Silber Standard to Boston U.\\" by David Barboza The New York Times Nov. 5, 1995\\"The Last Candid Man, A Homophobe Hides Behind His Right to Discriminate\\" , by Richard Goldstein, The Village Voice, October 15, 2002 Silber's wife Kathryn died in 2005. Early academic career Silber received his M.A. in 1952 and worked first as a teaching assistant and then as an instructor while pursuing a doctoral degree. Peter H. Hare, Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at SUNY- Buffalo, remembers Silber as a teaching assistant at Yale in the mid-1950s while Hare was still an undergraduate. Hare wrote, \\"George Schrader was the lecturer in the introductory course where John Silber was the TA leading my discussion section. Silber, a rabid Kantian, was the person with whom I had my first heated philosophical arguments as an adult.\\"A Philosophical Autobiography by the late Peter H. Hare, Professor Emeritus, SUNY at Buffalo In 1959, Silber earned a Fulbright scholarship, which enabled him to travel to West Germany to teach at the University of Bonn for a year. It was there that he learned of his father's Jewish heritage. His first full-time faculty job was at the University of Texas at Austin, where he chaired the Philosophy department from 1962–1967. Larry Hickman, Director of the Center for Dewey Studies at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale, recalls his time as a student in philosophy at UT. \\"The department chairs during those years, John Silber and Irwin C. Lieb, were busy using Texas oil money to collect the very best faculty and graduate students they could find.\\"A Philosophical Autobiography by Larry Hickman While at UT, Silber was well known for his support of liberal causes, having founded the Texas society to abolish capital punishment and being a supporter of civil rights. In 1967, Silber became Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at UT. Three years later, in a widely publicized firing, Silber was removed as Dean in 1970 by the UT Regents Chairman Frank Craig Erwin, Jr.ERWIN, FRANK CRAIG, JR.  The Handbook of Texas Online Texas State Historical Association (TSHA) Boston University Silber was named president of Boston University (BU) on December 17, 1970. He took office the following month. With an annual salary that reached $800,000, Silber ranked as one of the highest paid college presidents in the country. He took a one-year leave of absence from BU in 1987, and then again in 1990 when he ran for governor of Massachusetts as a Democrat. He returned to his position at BU after losing the election to William Weld. In 1996, he was named university chancellor after stepping down as president. That same year he was appointed by Gov. Weld to serve as head of the Massachusetts Board of Education. Among Silber's recruits to the Boston University faculty were the author Saul Bellow and Elie Wiesel, writer and concentration camp survivor. =Tension with faculty and students= Under Silber, Boston University increased in size but questions about his leadership style caused splits among faculty and alumni. In his early days as BU President, Silber accused the faculty of mediocrity and the students of fostering anarchy, and they, in turn, accused him of tyrannical rule. The faculty organized a union in 1974 and the following year voted to affiliate with the American Association of University Professors (AAUP). Fritz Ringer, a BU faculty member, served as president of the BU chapter of the AAUP for eight years. According to Perspectives Online, the publication of the American Historical Association, \\"at a time when the BU president (Silber) was running roughshod over faculty rights, Fritz Ringer bravely and vigorously championed the principles of academic freedom.\\"http://www.historians.org/perspectives/issues/2006/0610/0610mem2.cfm \\"Fritz K. Ringer\\" Perspectives Online published by the American Historical Association ISSN 1556-8563 October 2006https://web.archive.org/web/20060901085621/http://mac10.umc.pitt.edu/u/FMPro?-db=ustory&-lay=a&-format=d.html&storyid;=4301&-Find Fritz K. Ringer in University Times, the faculty and staff newspaper at University of Pittsburgh. Initially the Silber administration would not negotiate with the union. In 1976 the refusal was challenged in a lawsuit. Two-thirds of the faculty and deans demanded the board of trustees fire Silber. The board refused. In 1978 the courts decided in favor of the AAUP position and Boston University was forced to negotiate. The faculty conducted a brief strike in 1979, which was followed by a clerical workers' walkout in which several faculty members refused to cross the picket line. Silber charged five of these faculty members with negligence and moved to have them disciplined. At that point faculty members throughout Boston signed a petition to have Silber removed. Silber was especially visible for confrontations with historian Howard Zinn. In one incident, Zinn arranged to take a sabbatical and teach in Paris, with Herbert Marcuse teaching at BU in the meantime. Silber vetoed the move. Silber also prevented Zinn from receiving pay raises and promotions over a number of years. In 1982, the AAUP intervened on Zinn's behalf, eventually forcing Silber to compensate Zinn for back pay. In 1987, the courts ruled that faculty in the local AAUP chapter were \\"managerial\\" employees, and therefore could not engage in collective bargaining. =Endowment investment controversy= During his tenure as President, $85 million, nearly one fifth of the Boston University endowment, was invested in a biotechnology company named Seragen. Investments continued, even after a rebuke from state regulators because of the risk involved. The bulk of the investment was lost when the Seragen stock collapsed.Jennifer Babson, \\"Troubled Seragen sold to Calif. biotech firm\\" The Boston Globe, May 12, 1998 =Gay rights issues= In 2002, Silber ordered that the Boston University Academy, a prep school operated by BU, disband its gay–straight alliance, a student club that staged demonstrations to publicize the deleterious effects of homophobia. Silber dismissed the stated purpose of the club—to serve as a support group for gay students and to promote tolerance and understanding between gay and straight students—accusing the club of being a vehicle for \\"homosexual recruitment.\\" Silber denounced the group for \\"evangelism\\" and \\"homosexual militancy\\" with the purpose of promoting gay sex. =Silber's deferred compensation= On May 10, 2006, The New York Times reported that the trustees of Boston University had given Silber an unprecedented compensation package, including deferred compensation, worth $6.1 million in 2005.\\"Boston University Gave Ex-Chief $6.1 Million, Officials Disclose\\", The New York Times, May 10, 2006 Political activities Silber advocated integration at the University of Texas, and was the first person to chair the Texas Society to Abolish Capital Punishment. He also promoted Operation Head Start, an early education program for preschoolers. In the Massachusetts gubernatorial election of 1990, Silber ran for Governor of Massachusetts as a Democrat. His outsider status, as well as his outspoken and combative style, were at first seen as advantages in a year in which voters were disenchanted with the Democratic Party establishment. As the Democratic nominee, Silber faced Republican William Weld. Silber's perceived angry personality, coupled with Weld's socially liberal views, helped Weld in the race. During the gubernatorial race, Silber regularly overreacted to questions from the press. These overreactions came to be known as \\"Silber shockers.\\" On the campaign trail, he called Massachusetts a \\"welfare magnet\\" and proposed cutting off benefits for unmarried mothers who have a second child while still on public aid. He questioned saving the lives of terminally ill elderly people, quoting Shakespeare and saying that \\"when you've had a long life and you're ripe, then it's time to go.\\" He said that the feminist Gloria Steinem, the black Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, and white supremacists are \\"the kind of people I wouldn't appoint as judges.\\" In a key interview late in the campaign, Silber was asked by WCVB-TV newscaster Natalie Jacobson to name a weakness; he testily replied, \\"you find a weakness, I don't have to go around telling you what's wrong with me.\\" After this performance, Silber's poll numbers declined rapidly. Ultimately, Weld was able to hold on to a significant portion of the Republican base while appealing to large numbers of Democrats and left-of- center independents, enabling him to defeat Silber by four points. Weld became the first Republican to serve as governor since early 1975.\\"Throw Some of the Bums Out!\\" Time, October 1, 1990 Publications Silber wrote four books. Straight Shooting: What's Wrong with America and How to Fix It (Harper & Row, 1989), Architecture of the Absurd: How \\"Genius\\" Disfigured a Practical Art (Quantuck Lane, 2007), Kant's Ethics: The Good, Freedom, and the Will (DeGruyter, 2012) and Seeking the North Star (David R. Godine, Publisher, 2013). Straight Shooting is part autobiography and partly a statement of Silber's concern that the United States has experienced a decline in moral and spiritual values traceable to excessive avarice and materialism. He also faults society with excessive reliance on litigation to settle disputes. Architecture of the Absurd discusses Silber's view that certain celebrity architects frequently fail to meet the needs of their clients because they consider themselves primarily sculptors and do not adequately consider financial constraints, the physical needs of building occupants or the urban environment. He is critical of architects Josep Lluís Sert, Le Corbusier, Frank Gehry, Daniel Libeskind and Steven Holl.\\"Celebrity Architects\\", Silber, J. The New York Times, December 22, 2007. In 1976, BU published a 32-page article by Silber called \\"Democracy: Its Counterfeits and Its Promise\\". Other of his articles have been published in Philosophical Quarterly, Philosophical Review and Kant-Studien where he served as editor. Legacy On May 14, 2008, Sherborn Street, which bisects the main BU Campus from Commonwealth Avenue to Back Street, was officially renamed by the City of Boston. Mayor Thomas Menino said that it was fitting to rename the street John R. Silber Way. \\"Was there any other way?\\" Menino quipped, referring to Silber's four decades of influence on the BU campus. Death Boston University announced Silber's death on September 27, 2012. He was 86. At a memorial service on November 29, 2012, writer Tom Wolfe spoke to the 750 people who gathered, saying that Silber was a man who \\"couldn't bring himself to flatter.\\" References Further reading * Allis, Sam, (August 28, 1989). \\"The Ivory Tower Triggerman\\", Time,69 * Kimball, Roger. \\"John Silber, 1926–2012\\", New Criterion (November 2012) Vol. 31, No. 3 online  * External links * Boston University's biography of Silber * and * Village Voice article accusing Silber of bigotry and homophobia New York Review of Books sequence of letters: ** Letter from professors at Boston University accusing Silber of violating academic freedom ** Response to the letter by the Boston University professors from a Silber supporter ** Rebuttal by the Boston University professors to the response by the Silber supporter 1926 births 2012 deaths American people of German-Jewish descent American people with disabilities Fulbright Scholars Jefferson High School (San Antonio, Texas) alumni Massachusetts Democrats People from San Antonio Presidents of Boston University Trinity University (Texas) alumni University of Texas at Austin alumni University of Texas at Austin faculty Yale Divinity School alumni ","title":"John Silber"},{"id":"1381161","text":"Cooking of svadbarski kupus (wedding cabbage) in ceramic pots, Serbia Clay pot cooking is a process of cooking food in a pot made of unglazed or glazed pottery. Cooking techniques Different cultures have different techniques of cooking food in clay pots. Some use pots that are fully finished by burnishing and therefore do not require the pot to be soaked each time before use. Some are unfinished and must be soaked in water for 30–45 minutes before each use to avoid cracking. The design and shape of the pot differ slightly from one culture to another to suit their style of cooking. Seasoning is important to prevent cracking of the vessel when exposed to high heat. Clay pots are initially seasoned with oil and hot water but may be fully seasoned only after the first several uses, during which food may take longer to cook. It is also essential to avoid sudden temperature changes, which may cause the pot to crack. Heat should be started low and increased gradually both on the stovetop and in the oven. The food inside the pot loses little to no moisture because it is surrounded by steam, creating a tender, flavorful dish. Water absorbed within the walls of the pot prevents burning so long as the pot is not allowed to dry completely. Because no oil needs to be added with this cooking technique, food cooked in clay is often lower in fat than food prepared by other methods. In Asian cuisines =South Asia= In the southern states of Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Telangana in India, the traditional pot used for cooking is called a chatti. There are many different types of pots used in the different cultures of North India, Pakistan, Bangladesh. India In northern states including Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, the cooking pots are called handi. Traditionally, Indian chefs could cook many dishes simultaneously by stacking handi while cooking. In southern states of Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Telangana, the cooking pots are called 'man panai','man satti' in Tamil, 'kunda', 'matti kunda', 'kadava' in Telugu. The traditional pot used Tamil Nadu 'pongal festival' Sri Lanka People in Sri Lanka use clay pots to make many dishes including pahi (“little jackfruit”) fish curry, called abul thiyal; accharu, a chutney; as well as some meats, rice, and several types of freshwater fish called Lula, Hunga, Magura and Kawaiya. =Greater China= Chinese claypots, used in cooking either food or medicine In China, the pot used for such cooking is generally known as or , a Cantonese word for “little pot”. Clay pot dishes are sometimes labeled as “hot pot” or “hotpot” dishes on the menus of Chinese restaurants in English-speaking areas of the world, but they should not be confused with hot pot dishes that are served in a large metal bowl and cooked at the table. In Taiwan, the chicken dish sanbeiji is prepared in a clay pot. =Japan= In Japan, the pot used for cooking is called a donabe, although it is not submerged in water. =Korea= In Korea, the earthenware pot is called ddukbaegi, often used for soups as seen in Korean restaurants. The stone pot is called dolsot, which is heavier and has a more marbled appearance, used to cook dolsot bibimbap. =Vietnam= The stew- like dish kho is cooked in a pot. The pot is most often called nồi đất in Vietnamese, although, depending on its size and use, it may also be called nồi kho cá, nồi kho thịt, nồi kho tiêu, or nồi kho tộ. =Philippines= The traditional pot used for cooking is the palayok. =Indonesia= Sapo tahu tofu and vegetables cooked in claypot The traditional pot used for cooking is called kuali or gentong. The famous cuisine is empal gentong (beef with coconut milk soup). Chinese Indonesian sapo tahu is tofu and vegetables cooked in claypot. In African cuisines =Ethiopia= Traditionally, all food was cooked in specialized clay pots. Some traditional dishes are still cooked in clay pots as the same flavor cannot be achieved with metal cookware. Tajine potter =Morocco= The tajine is a North African, two-piece pot used in Moroccan cuisine. The bottom part is a broad, shallow bowl, while the top is tall and conical, or sometimes domed. The tall lid acts to condense rising steam and allow the moisture to roll back down into the dish. The tajine lends its name to the meat stew that is typically cooked in this pot. In European cuisines =Germany= A Römertopf Clay roasting pots called Römertopf (“Roman pot”) are mainly used to cook meat or stew in the oven. Since its introduction in 1967, it has influenced cooking traditions in Germany and neighbouring countries. =Spain= In Spanish cooking a ceramic roaster known as olla de barro is used. =Italy= The pignatta is a vase-shaped pot used for cooking beside a fireplace or in a wood-fired oven. In South American cuisines Clay pots are used in various South American dishes. In North American cuisines Native American civilizations traditionally cooked in clay pots, although they fell out of favor after European settlers' introduction of metal cookware. In the modern United States some cooks choose to use clay pots for health or environmental reasons.

The CNC does not guard the United Kingdom's nuclear weapons; this role is the responsibility of the British Armed Forces and the Ministry of Defence Police. Role The core role of the CNC is to provide armed policing and security for civil nuclear establishments and materials throughout the United Kingdom and to maintain a state of readiness against any possible attack on a licensed nuclear site.Energy Act 2004 The Constabulary is established in Chapter 3, sections 51–71, of the Energy Act 2004. The act sets up the Civil Nuclear Police Authority and the position of Chief Constable, defines the powers of members of the constabulary, mandates that Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary must inspect the force and amends several other acts. It falls under the remit of the newly formed Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy instead of the Home Office. The CNC's Annual Report (page 15) states that \\"... the crime dealt with by officers at civil nuclear sites remains low in volume. The management and investigation of crime does not form any part of the Constabulary's mission statement.\\" Whilst the CNC are a police force, this acknowledgement would suggest the role of a CNC Police Officer is that of providing armed security, rather than primarily being concerned with law enforcement. This role is also evidenced in the number of arrests made by the force annually compared with a territorial police force of a similar number of police officers. In 2016 CNC officers made 24 arrests. This compares to Dorset Police, a force with a similar number of officers who made 7,460 arrests annually in the latest annual figures. During the year 2010–11, the CNC made 12 arrests, although two of those people were de-arrested at the scene (one when it was realised that the person was not wanted on warrant after all and another where it was decided that police action was not appropriate in relation to an alleged assault). From 1 October 2012 to 31 March 2019 the Chief Constable of the CNC was retired Brigadier Michael Griffiths CBE. The Deputy Chief Constable Simon Chesterman QPM formerly of Thames Valley Police who is also the National Police Chiefs Council lead for firearms policing took over as Chief Constable. The new Temporary Deputy Chief Constable is Chris Armitt QPM formerly of Merseyside Police since 1989 who served 8 years in the Royal Engineers. The new Temporary Assistant Chief Constable is Duncan Worsell MBE who has served with the force throughout his career. Previously he was North and Scotland Divisional Commander, Operational Unit Commander at Sellafield and Chief Firearms Instructor. Unlike the majority of the British police territorial forces, all frontline CNC officers are routinely armed while carrying out duties. CNC officers also operate the armament on board the ships of the Pacific Nuclear Transport Limited, a subsidiary of International Nuclear Services, which specialise in transporting spent nuclear fuel and reprocessed uranium on behalf of its ultimate parent, the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority. Such ships have an onboard escort of armed police. The CNC is authorised to carry out covert intelligence operations against anti-nuclear protesters. In July 2009 Judge Christopher Rose said the CNC's \\"approach to covert activity is conspicuously professional\\". He found that the system for storing the intelligence gained from informers was \\"working well\\" and that \\"senior officers regard covert surveillance as a long-term requirement\\". Legal jurisdiction CNC police officers have the same powers as regular police officers, but with jurisdiction limited to those set out in the Energy Act 2004, which are: * Any place when escorting nuclear materials in transit * Any place when pursuing or detaining subjects who have unlawfully removed or interfered with materials guarded by the CNC, or have been reasonably suspected of being guilty of doing so * Civil nuclear sites * Land around such sites up to 5 km from the boundary. * Shipyards when safeguarding such nuclear materials See below section 'Mutual aid' when this jurisdiction can be extended in support of other forces. Locations The CNC operates at a total of 10 sites in England, Scotland and Wales (there are no \\"relevant nuclear sites\\" in Northern Ireland). Of these, three are classed as Operational Units, where an ordinary police presence is maintained, while eight are Support Units, which have an overt armed police presence. *CNC Headquarters **Culham *Operational Units **Dounreay **Harwell **Sellafield *Support Units **Dungeness **Hartlepool **Heysham **Hinkley Point **Hunterston **Sizewell **Torness In 2007, the CNC adopted a structure similar to other police forces when it introduced three Basic Command Units, each headed by a Superintendent, based around the geographical locations it polices. This has now changed to two, each headed by a Chief Superintendent as follows: *BCU North and Scotland – responsible for nuclear sites in Scotland (Dounreay, Hunterston and Torness) as well as nuclear sites in the north of England (Hartlepool, Heysham and Sellafield). *BCU South – responsible for nuclear sites in the south of England (Culham, Dungeness, Harwell, Hinkley Point and Sizewell). Equipment An officer of the CNC with a G36 rifle. =Armament= The CNC operates with most of its constables acting as authorised firearms officers. Many of the officers can be seen patrolling their respective sites carrying firearms such as assault rifles and pistols. All officers complete firearms training as per the National Firearms Training Curriculum. This curriculum is also followed to train Operational, Tactical and Strategic commanders in the force along with Tactical Advisors and Post Incident Managers. The core weapon system for CNC AFOs is the Heckler & Koch G36, as well as this all officers are armed with Glock 17 sidearms. All officers are additionally equipped with less-lethal weapons for use against threats that do not justify a firearms response. Such options include PAVA spray, X2 Tasers, ASP telescopic batons, and baton launchers. Specialist team officers at some sites are also issued with enhanced carbines, shotguns and specialist munitions such as distraction devices. =Uniform= The uniform of the force is similar to that of other police forces in the UK. The current uniform replaced the traditional Metropolitan Police-style uniforms in July 2008. A new, more practical uniform was introduced from October 2015. Officers wear body armour similar to that of other UK Police Authorised Firearms Officers. All CNC firearms officers are trained to national 'D13' standards to administer medical care. Additionally some officers are trained to Tactical Care Officer standard and carry additional equipment such as paramedic bergens and defibrillators. These officers regularly attend incidents within their policing juristicion as first responders to render first aid to injured parties. =Vehicles= The force uses almost entirely Ford S-Max and Mitsubishi Shogun patrol and response vehicles, though these are soon to be replaced by Skoda Karoq, along with OVIK Crossway ballistic protected vehicles. The force also runs a number of BMW X5s for use as escort vehicles. 'Standard' and 'advanced' driver training is provided in line with national standards and is delivered in-house as the CNC does now have its own police driving instructors based from Cumbria. The vehicle fleet is managed by the Chiltern Transport Consortium, led by Thames Valley Police. Funding Funding comes from the companies which run 10 nuclear plants in the UK. Around a third is paid by Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, which owns Sellafield. Nearly a fifth of the funding is provided by British Energy, the privatised company owned by EDF. In June 2009, EDF's head of security complained that the force had overspent its budget \\"without timely and satisfactory explanations to us\\". The industry acknowledges it is in regular contact with the CNC and the UK security services. Mutual aid The CNC is one of the three special police forces of the United Kingdom, the others being the British Transport Police, and Ministry of Defence Police. Unlike these other two forces, the CNC were not included in the provisions setting out 'extended jurisdiction' as per the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001. This allows officers of the MDP and BTP to act outside their natural jurisdiction in certain circumstances. The CNC is also not included in mutual aid provisions provided by the Police Act 1996 sections 24 and 98 (mutual aid between police forces of England & Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and BTP) or Ministry of Defence Police Act 1987 section 3a (mutual aid from MDP). However section 59 of the Energy Act 2004 allows CNC officers to act outside their natural jurisdiction in mutual aid situations under agreements between the Chief Officer of the CNC and the Chief Officer of a local police force. In 2005 officers of the CNC were part of the police operation involving nearly all police forces of the United Kingdom in connection with the G8 conference near Gleneagles, Scotland. Officers were seconded to Cumbria Constabulary as support during the floods of 2009. On 2 June 2010 27 CNC officers were deployed to assist Cumbria Constabulary in the manhunt for the gunman Derrick Bird. Along his route across West Cumbria, Bird killed 12 people and injured 25. Officers have also been deployed to the 2012 London Olympics and twenty-eight officers to a 2014 NATO conference in Wales. For a period of three months during 2015, ten CNC officers were seconded to the British Transport Police's Counter Terrorism Support Unit in London. This detachment helped to cover the shortfall in firearms officer numbers in London in the wake of recent European terror attacks on major cities. On 27 March 2016, the Daily Telegraph, post-Brussels terrorist attacks, stated: 'The Home Secretary has announced there will be a \\"surge\\" of more than 1,000 new armed police officers deployed across the country in the wake of the terrorist attacks in Brussels. Ms May has also changed the law to enable the 1,000 armed police officers guarding Britain's nuclear power stations to be redistributed in the event of multiple terror attacks.' A press release from the CNC and Home Office details the changes made to enable a greater mutual aid role (dated 7 March 2016). It cites the CNC's Deputy Chief Constable Simon Chesterman: 'The signing of this collaboration agreement allows chief constables to formally request and receive CNC AFOs to work under his or her jurisdiction for the time period they require. Currently, CNC officers only have policing powers in a five- kilometre radius of a nuclear site, as laid out in the Energy Act 2004, and this agreement removes that restriction should officers be needed to provide support at any force across the country if circumstances require it.' Following the Manchester Arena bombing on 22 May 2017 the force deployed in excess of 450 AFOs across the UK. This deployment occurred following the UK Threat Level being increased from Severe to Critical. Operation Temperer was activated and the military was deployed to backfill CNC officers at Nuclear Licensed Sites. CNC officers were deployed to support Northumbria Police, Greater Manchester Police, Merseyside Police, South Yorkshire Police, West Yorkshire Police, West Midlands Police and South Wales Police.

A former Swiss attorney general, she was appointed prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) in August 1999, replacing Louise Arbour. In 2003, the U.N. Security Council removed Del Ponte as the Prosecutor for the ICTR, and replaced her there with Hassan Bubacar Jallow in an effort to expedite proceedings in that Tribunal. She remained the Prosecutor for the ICTY until 1 January 2008, when she was succeeded by Serge Brammertz. Del Ponte was formerly married, and has one son. Del Ponte served as Swiss ambassador to Argentina from 2008 to February 2011.  Early life and education  Del Ponte was born in Bignasco, Switzerland, in 1947. Her first language is Italian and she speaks fluent German, French and English. Del Ponte studied law in Bern and Geneva, as well as in the United Kingdom. She obtained her LL.M. in 1972. After completing her studies, Del Ponte joined a private law firm in Lugano, leaving in 1975 to set up her own practice. Career = Prosecutor in Switzerland = In 1981, Del Ponte was appointed an investigating magistrate, and later public prosecutor at the Lugano district attorney's office. As public prosecutor, she dealt with cases of money laundering, fraud, drug trafficking, arms smuggling, terrorism and espionage, often looking into the many international links forged in Switzerland's role as a global business centre. During her time in office, Del Ponte became well known in Europe for breaking a Sicilian Mafia money-laundering operation in Switzerland, pursuing former Soviet bloc officials who may have been stowing illegal funds in Switzerland and investigating Swiss bankers suspected of misappropriating money, in some cases in collaboration with Latin Americans. She also produced the evidence for Pakistan to bring money-laundering charges against Benazir Bhutto, a former Prime Minister, and her husband, Asif Ali Zardari. It was during that period that she and Investigative Judge Giovanni Falcone uncovered the link between Swiss money launderers and the Italian drug trade in the so- called \\"pizza connection.\\" Judge Falcone was killed by a large Mafia bomb. Del Ponte was more fortunate as the half a tonne of explosives planted in the foundations of her Palermo home were discovered in time for her to escape the attempted assassination unhurt. Falcone's death nurtured Del Ponte's resoluteness to fight organised crime. Her enemies in the Cosa Nostra call her \\"La Puttana\\" (\\"the whore\\"). She therefore became the first public figure in Switzerland to require round-the-clock protection and armour-plated car. In 1999, Del Ponte suffered a setback when Switzerland's highest court overturned the confiscation by her office of $90 million from Swiss accounts belonging to Raúl Salinas de Gortari, the brother of a former President of Mexico. The court ruled that Del Ponte had no authority to seize the $90 million only on the suspicion that it included money from drug-trafficking. But the ruling did not absolve Salinas of the charges. = Career at the ICTY = After serving for five years as Switzerland's attorney general, in 1999 Del Ponte joined the ICTY and ICTR to deal with war crimes as prosecutor. Del Ponte was the first experienced prosecutor to hold the job on the war crimes tribunals; her predecessors, Louise Arbour and Richard Goldstone, were both judges. At the time, Switzerland was not a member of the United Nations, which was considered an advantage for Del Ponte. In an interview in late 2001 about war crimes committed during the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s, Del Ponte said: \\"Justice for the victims and the survivors requires a comprehensive effort at international and national level.\\" As reported by Reuters on March 18, 2003, according to Del Ponte, Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Đinđić had predicted his own assassination on February 17, just weeks before it happened on March 12, 2003.https://listserv.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=JUSTWATCH-L;3b735282.0303 In August 2003, after being on the Rwandan genocide case for four years, Del Ponte was removed from the appointment for political reasons and replaced by Hassan Bubacar Jallow. In an interview in Intellectum website in 2004 she boldly stated that she would like to try in ICTY Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein. In 2005, she accused the Vatican of helping Croatia's most wanted war crimes suspect Ante Gotovina evade capture. He has since been acquitted of all charges by ICTY. The Croatian Bishops' Conference, which heads the Croatian Roman Catholic Church, dismissed Del Ponte's allegations. Its spokesman Antun Suljic said the conference \\"has no knowledge or indications of the whereabouts\\" of General Gotovina. On January 30, 2007 Del Ponte announced her intention to resign as Chief Prosecutor at the ICTY at the end of the year, stating it was \\"time to return to normal life.\\" She was succeeded by Serge Brammertz on January 1, 2008. = Career as Swiss diplomat = Del Ponte served as Switzerland's Ambassador to Argentina from January 2008 until early 2011, when she retired. Post-retirement From September 2012 to August 2017, Del Ponte was a member of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, under the auspices of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. In May 2013 she accused the Syrian rebels of using chemical weapons, a view diametrically opposed by the majority of Western government officials. She stated, \\"We still have to deepen our investigation, verify and confirm (the findings) through new witness testimony, but according to what we have established so far, it is at the moment opponents of the regime who are using sarin gas.\\"The Telegraph, May 06, 2013, \\"UN accuses Syrian rebels of chemical weapons use\\" The following day, in an apparent reaction to Del Ponte's comments, the Commission issued a press release clarifying that it \\"has not reached conclusive findings as to the use of chemical weapons in Syria by any parties in the conflict\\".Los Angeles Times, May 06, 2013, \\"U.N.'s Carla del Ponte say Syrian Rebels May Have Used Sarin\\" In March 2014, the Commission published a report that stated that the chemical agents used in the Khan al-Assal chemical attack bore \\"the same unique hallmarks as those used in Al-Ghouta\\" in the August 2013 chemical attack. The report also indicated, based on \\"evidence available concerning the nature, quality and quantity of the agents used\\" that the perpetrators of the Al-Ghouta attack \\"likely had access to the chemical weapons stockpile of the Syrian military\\". In none of the incidents, however, was the commission’s \\"evidentiary threshold\\" met in regards to identifying the perpetrators of the chemical attacks. In August 2017, Del Ponte resigned from the Commission, due to frustration at the lack of support from the international community: “We could not obtain from the international community and the Security Council a resolution putting in place a tribunal, an ad hoc tribunal for all the crimes that are committed in Syria... Seven years of crime in Syria and total impunity. That is not acceptable.”Syria investigator del Ponte signs off with a sting, Reuters, 18 September 2017 She blamed Russia for vetoing action:UN Syria investigator quits over concern about Russian obstruction, The Guardian, 7 August 2017 \\"Now a prosecutor should continue our work and bring the war criminals before a special court. But that is exactly what Russia is blocking with its veto in the U.N. Security Council\\".Syria investigator del Ponte says enough evidence to convict Assad of war crimes: SonntagsZeitung, Reuters, 13 August 2017 She said that the Commission has gathered enough evidence for President al-Assad to be convicted of war crimes. Del Ponte told Syria's ambassador that she had been right to quickly reach the conclusion that Assad's government used chemical weapons during an attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun in April 2017. Controversy = Comments on NATO = In late December 1999, in an interview with The Observer in London, Del Ponte was asked if she was prepared to press criminal charges against NATO personnel for alleged war crimes in Kosovo by NATO pilots and their commanders. She replied, \\"If I am not willing to do that, I am not in the right place. I must give up my mission\\".Interview in The Observer, 26 December 1999 That was followed by various negative official responses, military and civilian, from the US and Canada. Del Ponte's office subsequently issued a statement dated four days later: \\"NATO is not under investigation by the Office of the Prosecutor of the ICTY. There is no formal inquiry into the actions of NATO during the conflict in Kosovo\\".Statement by Madame Carla Del Ponte, International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, The Hague, 30 December 1999 = Organ smuggling allegations = In 2008, Del Ponte published a book The Hunt in which she claimed that the Kosovo Albanians had smuggled human organs of kidnapped Serbs after the Kosovo war ended in 1999. Her book created an international controversy. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia stated on Del Ponte's allegations: \\"The Tribunal is aware of very serious allegations of human organ trafficking raised by the former Prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte, in a book recently published in Italian under her name. No evidence in support of such allegations was ever brought before the Tribunal’s judges.\\"ICTY Weekly Press Briefing On 4 April 2008, Human Rights Watch asked Kosovar Prime Minister Hashim Thaci and Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha to open investigations on the matter under international supervision. They ignored the letters and instead publicly rejected Del Ponte's claims as unsubstantiated. On 5 May 2008 Human Rights Watch called the Del Ponte allegations \\"serious and credible\\" and publicly called on Tirana and Pristina to cooperate.BBC, Kosovo 'organs sale' probe urged, 06.05.2008 Del Ponte alleged that the victims were more than 300 Serbs missing from the war. \\"Serious and credible allegations have emerged about horrible abuses in Kosovo and Albania after the war,\\" said Fred Abrahams, HRW Senior emergencies researcher of HRW. In 2008, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe authorized an investigation and employed Dick Marty to report the findings to the Parliament. According to a draft Council of Europe report cited by The Daily Telegraph, Prime Minister Hashim Thaci was one of the key players in the traffic of organs of Serb prisoners after the 1998-99 conflict. In November 2012, Haradinaj and all of the accused in the matter were acquitted for the second time of the accusations. Del Ponte talked about the issue in Boris Malagurski's documentary film The Weight of Chains 2 (2014). In the interview, she claimed that the UN Mission in Kosovo did not provide the Hague Tribunal with the necessary evidence regarding organ trafficking in Kosovo and that \\"NATO and the KLA, as allies in the war, couldn't act against each other\\".

To agist is, in English law, to take cattle to graze, in exchange for payment (derived from the Old English giste, gite, a \\"lying place\\"). History Agistment originally referred specifically to the proceeds of pasturage in the king's forests in England, but now means either: # the contract for taking in and feeding horses or cattle on pasture land, for the consideration of a periodic payment of money; # the profit derived from such pasturing. Agistment involves a contract of bailment, and the bailee must take reasonable care of the animals entrusted to him; he is responsible for damages and injury which result from ordinary casualties, if it be proved that such might have been prevented by the exercise of great care. There is no lien on the cattle for the price of the agistment unless by express agreement. Under the Agricultural Holdings Act of 1883, agisted cattle cannot be distrained on for rent if there be other sufficient distress to be found, and if such other distress be not found, and the cattle be distrained, the owner may redeem them on paying the price of their agistment. The tithe of agistment or \\"tithe of cattle and other produce of grass lands\\" was formally abolished in Great Britain by the Act of Union in 1707, on a motion submitted with a view to defeat that measure. Agistment tithe continued in Ireland, but was opposed by landlords who had converted holdings from tillage to pasture, who secured a 1736 resolution of the House of Commons of Ireland opposing the levying of agistment tithe on \\"dry and barren cattle\\". Although this was not enshrined in statute law until just before the Acts of Union 1800, nevertheless it provided sufficient cover for widespread refusal to pay.; ; Current usage =England (New Forest)= A dead cow in the New Forest. The sticker states \\"Agister Aware\\" because the agisters (not police) have the legal responsibility for commoners' animals in the forest. In England, agisters were formerly the officers of the forest empowered to collect the agistment. They have been re-established in the New Forest to carry out the daily duties of administering the forest. =Australia and New Zealand= In Australia, agistment is commonly used during times of drought; livestock from a drought-affected property can be agisted on a drought-free property elsewhere in the country. The livestock may travel to the alternate pasture by truck or by travelling stock route. Agistment can also refer, in both Australia and New Zealand, to places such as farms, paddocks, or studs where the owners of horses can pay to have their animals looked after and allowed to graze ('full agistment') or where grazing only is offered ('part agistment'). =United States and Canada= In the United States and Canada, the term agister is used in raw milk herdshare agreements to refer to the person hired to provide agistment services for owners of the herd animals.; ; . In the Western United States, agisters are landholders who offer pasturage services, or who seek to enforce agistment lien commitments.

This can be used to confirm the identity of a user before sending sensitive information, such as online banking transaction history. It applies a hash function to the username and password before sending them over the network. In contrast, basic access authentication uses the easily reversible Base64 encoding instead of hashing, making it non-secure unless used in conjunction with TLS. Technically, digest authentication is an application of MD5 cryptographic hashing with usage of nonce values to prevent replay attacks. It uses the HTTP protocol.  Overview  Digest access authentication was originally specified by RFC 2069 (An Extension to HTTP: Digest Access Authentication). RFC 2069 specifies roughly a traditional digest authentication scheme with security maintained by a server-generated nonce value. The authentication response is formed as follows (where HA1 and HA2 are names of string variables): : HA1 = MD5(username:realm:password) HA2 = MD5(method:digestURI) response = MD5(HA1:nonce:HA2) A MD5 hash is a 16-byte value. The HA1 and HA2 values used in the computation of the response are the hexadecimal representation (in lowercase) of the MD5 hashes respectively. RFC 2069 was later replaced by RFC 2617 (HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest Access Authentication). RFC 2617 introduced a number of optional security enhancements to digest authentication; \\"quality of protection\\" (qop), nonce counter incremented by client, and a client-generated random nonce. These enhancements are designed to protect against, for example, chosen-plaintext attack cryptanalysis. If the algorithm directive's value is \\"MD5\\" or unspecified, then HA1 is : HA1 = MD5(username:realm:password) If the algorithm directive's value is \\"MD5-sess\\", then HA1 is : HA1 = MD5(MD5(username:realm:password):nonce:cnonce) If the qop directive's value is \\"auth\\" or is unspecified, then HA2 is : HA2 = MD5(method:digestURI) If the qop directive's value is \\"auth-int\\", then HA2 is : HA2 = MD5(method:digestURI:MD5(entityBody)) If the qop directive's value is \\"auth\\" or \\"auth-int\\", then compute the response as follows: : response = MD5(HA1:nonce:nonceCount:cnonce:qop:HA2) If the qop directive is unspecified, then compute the response as follows: : response = MD5(HA1:nonce:HA2) The above shows that when qop is not specified, the simpler RFC 2069 standard is followed. In September 2015, RFC 7616 replaced RFC 2617 by adding 4 new algorithms: \\"SHA-256\\", \\"SHA-256-sess\\", \\"SHA-512\\" and \\"SHA-512-sess\\". The encoding is equivalent to \\"MD5\\" and \\"MD5-sess\\" algorithms, with MD5 hashing function replaced with SHA-256 and SHA-512.  Impact of MD5 security on digest authentication  The MD5 calculations used in HTTP digest authentication is intended to be \\"one way\\", meaning that it should be difficult to determine the original input when only the output is known. If the password itself is too simple, however, then it may be possible to test all possible inputs and find a matching output (a brute-force attack) – perhaps aided by a dictionary or suitable look-up list, which for MD5 is readily available.List of rainbow tables, Project Rainbowcrack. Includes multiple MD5 rainbow tables. The HTTP scheme was designed by Phillip Hallam- Baker at CERN in 1993 and does not incorporate subsequent improvements in authentication systems, such as the development of keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC). Although the cryptographic construction that is used is based on the MD5 hash function, collision attacks were in 2004 generally believed to not affect applications where the plaintext (i.e. password) is not known. However, claims in 2006 cause some doubt over other MD5 applications as well. So far, however, MD5 collision attacks have not been shown to pose a threat to digest authentication, and the RFC 2617 allows servers to implement mechanisms to detect some collision and replay attacks.  HTTP digest authentication considerations  = Advantages = HTTP digest authentication is designed to be more secure than traditional digest authentication schemes, for example \\"significantly stronger than (e.g.) CRAM- MD5 ...\\" (RFC 2617). Some of the security strengths of HTTP digest authentication are: * The password is not sent clear to the server. * The password is not used directly in the digest, but rather HA1 = MD5(username:realm:password). This allows some implementations (e.g. JBoss) to store HA1 rather than the cleartext password * Client nonce was introduced in RFC 2617, which allows the client to prevent chosen-plaintext attacks, such as rainbow tables that could otherwise threaten digest authentication schemes * Server nonce is allowed to contain timestamps. Therefore, the server may inspect nonce attributes submitted by clients, to prevent replay attacks * Server is also allowed to maintain a list of recently issued or used server nonce values to prevent reuse * It prevents Phishing because the plain password is never sent to any server, be it the correct server or not. (Public key systems rely on the user being able to verify that the URL is correct.) = Disadvantages = There are several drawbacks with digest access authentication: * The website has no control over the user interface presented to the end user. * Many of the security options in RFC 2617 are optional. If quality-of-protection (qop) is not specified by the server, the client will operate in a security-reduced legacy RFC 2069 mode * Digest access authentication is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. For example, a MITM attacker could tell clients to use basic access authentication or legacy RFC2069 digest access authentication mode. To extend this further, digest access authentication provides no mechanism for clients to verify the server's identity * Some servers require passwords to be stored using reversible encryption. However, it is possible to instead store the digested value of the username, realm, and password * It prevents the use of a strong password hash (such as bcrypt) when storing passwords (since either the password, or the digested username, realm and password must be recoverable) Also, since the MD5 algorithm is not allowed in FIPS, HTTP Digest authentication will not work with FIPS-certifiedThe following is a list of FIPS approved algorithms: crypto modules. = Alternative authentication protocols = By far the most common approach is to use a HTTP+HTML form-based authentication cleartext protocol, or more rarely Basic access authentication. These weak cleartext protocols used together with HTTPS network encryption resolve many of the threats that digest access authentication is designed to prevent. However, this use of HTTPS relies upon the end user to accurately validate that they are accessing the correct URL each time to prevent sending their password to an untrusted server, which results in phishing attacks. Users often fail to do this, which is why phishing has become the most common form of security breach. Some strong authentication protocols for web-based applications that are occasionally used include: * Public key authentication (usually implemented with a HTTPS / SSL client certificate) using a client certificate. * Kerberos or SPNEGO authentication, employed for example by Microsoft IIS running configured for Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA). * Secure Remote Password protocol (preferably within the HTTPS / TLS layer). However, this is not implemented by any mainstream browsers. * JSON Web Token (JWT) is a JSON-based standard RFC 7519 for creating access tokens that assert some number of claims.  Example with explanation  The following example was originally given in RFC 2617 and is expanded here to show the full text expected for each request and response. Note that only the \\"auth\\" (authentication) quality of protection code is covered – , only the Opera and Konqueror web browsers are known to support \\"auth-int\\" (authentication with integrity protection). Although the specification mentions HTTP version 1.1, the scheme can be successfully added to a version 1.0 server, as shown here. This typical transaction consists of the following steps: # The client asks for a page that requires authentication but does not provide a username and password.A client may already have the required username and password without needing to prompt the user, e.g. if they have previously been stored by a web browser. Typically this is because the user simply entered the address or followed a link to the page. # The server responds with the 401 \\"Unauthorized\\" response code, providing the authentication realm and a randomly generated, single-use value called a nonce. # At this point, the browser will present the authentication realm (typically a description of the computer or system being accessed) to the user and prompt for a username and password. The user may decide to cancel at this point. # Once a username and password have been supplied, the client re-sends the same request but adds an authentication header that includes the response code. # In this example, the server accepts the authentication and the page is returned. If the username is invalid and/or the password is incorrect, the server might return the \\"401\\" response code and the client would prompt the user again.  ; Client request (no authentication): GET /dir/index.html HTTP/1.0 Host: localhost (followed by a new line, in the form of a carriage return followed by a line feed). ; Server response: HTTP/1.0 401 Unauthorized Server: HTTPd/0.9 Date: Sun, 10 Apr 2014 20:26:47 GMT WWW-Authenticate: Digest realm=\\"testrealm@host.com\\", qop=\\"auth,auth-int\\", nonce=\\"dcd98b7102dd2f0e8b11d0f600bfb0c093\\", opaque=\\"5ccc069c403ebaf9f0171e9517f40e41\\" Content-Type: text/html Content- Length: 153 # 401 Unauthorized. ; Client request (username \\"Mufasa\\", password \\"Circle Of Life\\"): GET /dir/index.html HTTP/1.0 Host: localhost Authorization: Digest username=\\"Mufasa\\", realm=\\"testrealm@host.com\\", nonce=\\"dcd98b7102dd2f0e8b11d0f600bfb0c093\\", uri=\\"/dir/index.html\\", qop=auth, nc=00000001, cnonce=\\"0a4f113b\\", response=\\"6629fae49393a05397450978507c4ef1\\", opaque=\\"5ccc069c403ebaf9f0171e9517f40e41\\" (followed by a blank line, as before). ; Server response: HTTP/1.0 200 OK Server: HTTPd/0.9 Date: Sun, 10 Apr 2005 20:27:03 GMT Content-Type: text/html Content-Length: 7984 (followed by a blank line and HTML text of the restricted page).  The \\"response\\" value is calculated in three steps, as follows. Where values are combined, they are delimited by colons. # The MD5 hash of the combined username, authentication realm and password is calculated. The result is referred to as HA1. # The MD5 hash of the combined method and digest URI is calculated, e.g. of \`\\"GET\\"\` and \`\\"/dir/index.html\\"\`. The result is referred to as HA2. # The MD5 hash of the combined HA1 result, server nonce (nonce), request counter (nc), client nonce (cnonce), quality of protection code (qop) and HA2 result is calculated. The result is the \\"response\\" value provided by the client. Since the server has the same information as the client, the response can be checked by performing the same calculation. In the example given above the result is formed as follows, where \`MD5()\` represents a function used to calculate an MD5 hash, backslashes represent a continuation and the quotes shown are not used in the calculation. Completing the example given in RFC 2617 gives the following results for each step. HA1 = MD5( \\"Mufasa:testrealm@host.com:Circle Of Life\\" ) = 939e7578ed9e3c518a452acee763bce9 HA2 = MD5( \\"GET:/dir/index.html\\" ) = 39aff3a2bab6126f332b942af96d3366 Response = MD5( \\"939e7578ed9e3c518a452acee763bce9:\\\\ dcd98b7102dd2f0e8b11d0f600bfb0c093:\\\\ 00000001:0a4f113b:auth:\\\\ 39aff3a2bab6126f332b942af96d3366\\" ) = 6629fae49393a05397450978507c4ef1 At this point the client may make another request, reusing the server nonce value (the server only issues a new nonce for each \\"401\\" response) but providing a new client nonce (cnonce). For subsequent requests, the hexadecimal request counter (nc) must be greater than the last value it used – otherwise an attacker could simply \\"replay\\" an old request with the same credentials. It is up to the server to ensure that the counter increases for each of the nonce values that it has issued, rejecting any bad requests appropriately. Obviously changing the method, URI and/or counter value will result in a different response value. The server should remember nonce values that it has recently generated. It may also remember when each nonce value was issued, expiring them after a certain amount of time. If an expired value is used, the server should respond with the \\"401\\" status code and add \`stale=TRUE\` to the authentication header, indicating that the client should re-send with the new nonce provided, without prompting the user for another username and password. The server does not need to keep any expired nonce values – it can simply assume that any unrecognised values have expired. It is also possible for the server to only allow each nonce value to be returned once, although this forces the client to repeat every request. Note that expiring a server nonce immediately will not work, as the client would never get a chance to use it.  The .htdigest file  .htdigest is a flat-file used to store usernames, realm and passwords for digest authentication of Apache HTTP Server. The name of the file is given in the .htaccess configuration, and can be anything, but \\".htdigest\\" is the canonical name. The file name starts with a dot, because most Unix-like operating systems consider any file that begins with dot to be hidden. This file is often maintained with the shell command \\"htdigest\\" which can add, and update users, and will properly encode the password for use. The \\"htdigest\\" command is found in the apache2-utils package on dpkg package management systems and the httpd-tools package on RPM package management systems.

Verderers investigated and recorded minor offences such as the taking of venison and the illegal cutting of woodland, and dealt with the day-to-day forest administration. In the modern era, verderers are still to be found in the New Forest, the Forest of Dean, and Epping Forest, where they serve to protect commoning practices, and conserve the traditional landscape and wildlife. Origins Verderers1970s Forestry Commission publication Explore the New Forest article by Oliver Crosthwaite-Eyre were originally part of the ancient judicial and administrative hierarchy of the vast areas of English forests and Royal Forests set aside by William the Conqueror for hunting. The title Verderer comes from the Norman word ‘vert’ meaning green and referring to woodland. These forests were divided into provinces each having a Chief Justice who travelled around on circuit dealing with the more serious offences. Verderers investigated and recorded minor offences and dealt with the day to day forest administration. New Forest Verderers Lyndhurst, where the Court meets in open session In the New Forest the Verderers are a group of unpaid individuals whose primary objective is to regulate and protect the interests of the New Forest commoners, and to preserve the natural beauty and good traditional character of the Forest. Together they constitute the Court of Verderers (or Court of Swainmote). The Court has the same status as a Magistrates Court, and acting under its authority the Verderers are responsible for regulating commoning within the Forest, for dealing with unlawful inclosures, and for a wide range of other matters relating to development control and conservation such as proposals for new roads, car parks, camping sites, recreational facilities, playing fields and so on. Forest of Dean Verderers Speech House The Verderers in the Forest of Dean have been in existence since at least 1218 and are charged with protecting the vert and venison (that is, generally, the vegetation and habitat) of the Forest. They are the last remnant of the traditional forest administration – unlike the New Forest, their structure has been unaltered over the centuries – there are still four verderers just as there has been for the past 800 years. The Verderers are elected by the freeholders of Gloucestershire at the Gloucester Court (an ancient procedure in its own right) and serve for life. Over the years, the deer in the Forest of Dean have fluctuated in numbers and species (they were totally absent for about 90 years from 1855) but today a herd of about 400 fallow deer inhabits the Forest. The Verderers now meet quarterly in their courtroom in the Speech House, close to the centre of the Forest. Epping Forest Verderers Verderers in the former Royal Forest of Epping (formerly Waltham Forest) have been appointed since the early 13th century, although early records are incomplete. The office was preserved by the Epping Forest Act 1878, which named the foundation verderers of the new regime—Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton 3rd baronet, Sir Antonio Brady, Thomas Charles Baring, and Andrew Johnston. They are nowadays elected at septennial elections among the registered commoners, two for the northern parishes, two for the southern. The verderers act as representatives of the users of the Forest, meet the Superintendent and other officials regularly, and are members of the Epping Forest Committee of the City of London. The history of the verderers of this Forest has been meticulously researched.

Work on Aquila began in late 1941 at the Ansaldo shipyard in Genoa and continued for the next two years. With the signing of the Italian armistice on 8 September 1943, however, all work was halted and the vessel remained unfinished. Aquila was eventually scrapped in 1952. Genesis Aquila was Italy's first aircraft carrier project; it was not built from the keel up as such, and was never completed. Following World War I, the Italian Royal Navy (Regia Marina) began exploring the use of ship-borne aircraft by converting the merchant ship Città di Messina into the twin-catapult-equipped seaplane tender Giuseppe Miraglia. Commissioned in 1927, the ship could carry as many as four large and 16 medium seaplanes and was primarily used as an experimental catapult ship for most of her career. By 1940, she was designated an aircraft transport/training ship and functioned as a seaplane tender for Italian capital ships.Chesneau, p. 152 Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, Italian military and political circles vigorously debated the role and necessity of aircraft carriers in the expanding Italian fleet. Gino Ducci (Regia Marina chief of staff in the early 1920s), Romeo Bernotti (assistant chief of staff) and naval officer Giuseppe Fioravanzo all championed development of a fleet air arm, the building of aircraft carriers and consolidation of the air and naval academies.Sadkovich, p. 3 Other factions opposed these ideas, especially carrier construction, not so much on the grounds of military usefulness, but rather on cost and practicality. More than anything else, Italy's limited industrial capacity, inadequate shipyard space and lack of financial capital prevented her from building the kind of well-balanced fleet envisioned by her naval theorists. Priority went to those ships deemed most necessary in a future conflict. Since France was considered Italy's most likely foe in another European war, keeping parity with her navy became a paramount concern. Between 1932 and 1937, the French Navy laid down four new capital ships: (Dunkerque, Strasbourg, Richelieu, and Jean Bart). This caused dictator Benito Mussolini and the Italian admiralty to scrap any plans for carrier construction. Instead, Italy modernized two older battleships (Cavour and Cesare in 1933), and began construction of two new ones (Vittorio Veneto and Littorio in 1934).Sadkovich, p. 4 Because the Regia Marina was expected to operate primarily in the relatively narrow confines of the Mediterranean and not on the world's oceans, the navy's lack of a fleet air arm seemed a tolerable omission (especially given that carriers were an expensive and unproven commodity at the time). The Italian mainland and islands such as Pantelleria and Sicily were viewed as natural aircraft carriers, whose many airbases, operated by the Italian Air Force (Regia Aeronautica), could provide adequate fleet air coverage when requested by the navy.Pantelleria: the Black Pearl of the Med Nevertheless, in June 1940, shortly after Italy's entry into the war, Mussolini sanctioned conversion of the , ocean liner Roma into an auxiliary carrier, featuring a flush deck and a small hangar. On 7 January 1941, less than two months after the successful British carrier raid on Taranto, Mussolini authorized a much more ambitious and extensive conversion of Roma into a full fleet carrier, capable of operating a larger air group and of keeping pace with the Regia Marina′s faster battleships and heavy cruisers. By 27 January, however, the order was just as quickly rescinded following numerous objections from the Regia Marina. These included excessive cost; technical obstacles involving development of catapults, arrester gear and elevators; an estimated two-year development time for folding-wing aircraft; the time needed for studying the effects of air turbulence over the flight deck from an island superstructure; problems the Germans were encountering in the construction of their own aircraft carrier, ; and recent accounts of the heavy damage inflicted by German dive bombers on the British carrier Illustrious, graphically demonstrating the vulnerability of carriers operating in the Mediterranean. Then, on 21 June, three months after losing three heavy cruisers off Cape Matapan, a loss potentially preventable had the Italians possessed their own aircraft carrier, the Regia Marina and Regia Aeronautica finally agreed to proceed with Roma′s conversion. Design and construction Work on converting Roma into an aircraft carrier began in earnest at Cantieri Ansaldo, Genoa, in November 1941. Since a battleship named was already under construction, the ship's name was changed to Aquila. =Hull= The liner's interior was completely gutted to allow for replacement of the original machinery and the addition of a hangar deck and workshops. Deep bulges were added to either side of the hull to improve stability and provide a modest degree of torpedo defense. A layer of reinforced concrete— thick—was applied inboard of the bulges for splinter protection. The hull was also lengthened to take advantage of the increased power of Aquila′s new machinery.Brown, p. 11 The designers worked in of armor over the magazines and aviation fuel tanks. The fuel tanks copied British practice and consisted of cylinders or coffer dams separated from the ship's hull by water-filled compartments. This was a safety measure intended to prevent fracturing of the fuel system and the inadvertent spread of volatile AvGas fumes due to severe vibration or \\"whip\\" from bomb hits, near misses and torpedo hits. =Machinery= Aquila′s new propulsion system consisted of four sets of Belluzzo geared turbines taken from two canceled Capitani Romani-class light cruisers (Cornelio Silla and Paolo Emilio). They were capable of generating , and Aquila was expected to reach on trials and when fully laden. =Flight deck= Aquila had a single continuous flight deck. It was partially armored with plate over the gasoline bunkers and magazines.Dunning, p. 198 The flight deck ended short of the bows but overhung the stern, where it featured a pronounced round-down to improve air flow. Two octagonal lifts with a capacity enabled transfer of aircraft between the hangar deck and flight deck. One was directly amidships and the second another forward, thus placing them far enough from the aft arrester wires that both could be used for striking down aircraft into the hangar immediately after a landing. Two German-supplied Demag compressed air-driven catapults, each capable of launching one aircraft every 30 seconds, were installed parallel to each other at the forward end of the flight deck. These were originally intended for Germany's own \\"Carrier B\\", Graf Zeppelin′s incomplete—and eventually scrapped—sister ship. The Italians obtained them—along with five sets of arrester gear and other component plans—during a naval technical mission to Germany in October–November 1941.Greene/Massignani, p. 114 A set of rails led aft from the catapults to the elevators and into the hangars. For catapult-assisted launches, aircraft would be hoisted in the hangar onto a portable collapsible catapult carriage, raised on the elevators to flight deck level and then trundled forward on the rails to the catapult starting positions, the same system as employed on Graf Zeppelin. Aquila′s engines and catapults were successfully tested in August 1943 but the arresting gear installed on the carrier, consisting of four cables, initially failed to work properly. This would have prevented aircraft, once launched, from landing back on board. It was therefore proposed that aircraft taking off from Aquila would, after performing their mission, fly back to the nearest land-based airfield or simply ditch in the sea, a serious and embarrassing limitation on her capabilities as a fleet carrier.Barker, p. 288 Italian and German technicians labored for months at the Perugia Sant'Egidio airfield on a mock- up of Aquila's flight deck and by March 1943 the heavily modified arresting gear was deemed usable. A postwar US Navy evaluation concluded, however, that the arrangement would have made landings exceedingly hazardous, especially given the absence of a crash barrier.Cernuschi/O'Hara, p. 74 Aquila′s starboard-side island contained a single large vertical funnel for carrying exhaust gases clear of the flight deck. It also included a tall command tower and the fire control directors for the guns. =Anti-aircraft armament= Six 6-barrelled /65 caliber (cal) anti-aircraft (AA) cannons were positioned just fore and aft on the island. In addition, Aquila carried eight /45 cal guns taken from one of the canceled Capitani Romani-class cruisers. Though not designed as dual purpose weapons, these guns had an elevation of 45° and were therefore capable of providing a useful barrage against attacking enemy aircraft (by comparison, Italy's best heavy AA gun—the /50 cal—had an elevation of 85°). It was intended to mount 12 newly designed AA guns on sponsons just below flight deck level (six on either side of the hull). However, this gun—with an automatic feeder and 20 rpm rate of fire—never got beyond prototype stage. An additional 16 six-barrelled 20 mm cannons—also mounted below the flight deck—rounded out the ship's AA defense. =Aircraft= Throughout 1942 and 1943, trials were conducted at Perugia and Guidonia—the Regia Aeronautica′s equivalent to the German Luftwaffe′s test facility at Rechlin—to find aircraft suitable for conversion to carrier use. The Italians selected the SAIMAN 200, Fiat G.50/B and Reggiane Re.2001 OR Serie II as potential candidates. In March 1943, German engineers and instructors with experience on Graf Zeppelin arrived to advise on aircraft testing and to help train future carrier pilots culled from 160 Gruppo C.T. of the Regia Aeronautica. They brought with them examples of a Junkers Ju 87C Stuka dive bomber (a navalized version with folding wings, arrester hook and catapult attachment points) and an Arado Ar 96B single-engine trainer. After conducting comparative flight trials, the Italians eventually settled on the Re.2001 as their standard carrier fighter/fighter-bomber and even the Germans concluded it had better potential than their own counterpart, the Messerschmitt Bf 109T. All flight testing—including simulated braked deck landings—was land-based. Aquila′s planned air complement was 51 non-folding Reggiane Re.2001 OR fighter-bombers: 41 stowed in the hangar deck (including 15 suspended from the deck head) and 10 on the flight deck in a permanent deck park. A folding-wing version of the Re.2001 was planned, which would have increased the size of Aquila′s air group to 66 aircraft, but this never materialized. Only 10 Re.2001s were fully converted for carrier use. They were given tail hooks, RTG naval radio equipment and bomb racks for carrying of bombs. They were also armed with two Breda-SAFAT machine guns mounted above the engine cowling. At least one Re.2001G was under test at Perugia as a naval torpedo bomber and was given a lengthened tail wheel strut to accommodate the added height of a torpedo suspended below the fuselage. Fate Aquila was nearing completion and had passed her first static test when Italy surrendered to the Allies on 8 September 1943. Germany then seized the ship and placed it under guard. Aquila was later damaged on 16 June 1944, during an Allied air attack on Genoa. Near the end of the war, the Italian \\"co-belligerent\\" government feared the Germans might use Aquila as a blockship in the entrance to Genoa harbor. They sent divers from the former Decima Flottiglia MAS, who on 19 April 1945 partially scuttled Aquila in a harmless location. Raised in 1946, Aquila was later towed to La Spezia in 1949. Consideration was given to completing her or converting her to some other use. She was eventually scrapped in 1952.Brown, p. 12  See also  * Italian aircraft carrier Sparviero References Bibliography      External links *Portaerei Aquila – Plancia di Comando Ships built in Genoa 1941 ships Aircraft carriers of the Regia Marina World War II aircraft carriers of Italy Naval ships of Italy captured by Germany during World War II Maritime incidents in April 1945 Ships built by Gio.

Early life Samuel Wilks was born on 2 June 1824 in Camberwell, London, the second son of Joseph Barber Wilks, a cashier at the East India House. After attending Aldenham School and University College School he was apprenticed to Richard Prior, a doctor in Newington.Sir Samuel Wilks (1824–1911): ‘The Most Philosophical of English Physicians’. Content.karger.com. Retrieved on 2012-05-21. Career In 1842 he entered Guy's Hospital to study medicine. After graduating MB in 1848 he was hired as a physician to the Surrey Infirmary (1853). In 1856 he returned to Guy's Hospital, first as assistant physician and curator of its museum (a post he held for nine years), then as physician and lecturer on medicine (1857). From 1866 to 1870 he was examiner in the practice of medicine at the University of London and from 1868 to 1875 examiner in medicine at the Royal College of Surgeons. Achievements upright Among his major discoveries, Wilks recognised ulcerative colitis in 1859, differentiating it from bacterial dysentery. His work was confirmed later (1931) by Sir Arthur Hurst. Wilks' autopsy of a 42-year-old woman who died after several months of diarrhoea and fever demonstrated a transmural ulcerative inflammation of the colon and terminal ileum. Wilks also firstly described trichorrhexis nodosa (the formation of nodes along the hair shaft), in 1852. The term was proposed in 1876 by Moritz Kaposi (1837–1902), a Hungarian dermatologist. In 1957, he provided the first autopsy description of a condition of the upper airways, later known as tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica. Subsequently, in 1868, he published the characteristic mental symptoms on alcoholic paraplegia (later to be named Korsakoff's syndrome). Wilks described the first case of myasthenia gravis, in 1877 (it was named \\"bulbar paralysis\\" in Guy's Hospital Reports 22:7). He was a collaborator and biographer of the \\"Three Great\\", contemporary physicians who worked at Guy's Hospital, Dr. Thomas Addison, the discoverer of Addison's disease, Dr. Richard Bright, discoverer of Bright's disease and Dr. Thomas Hodgkin, discoverer of Hodgkin's lymphoma. After the death of Addison in 1860, he carried out the job of examining specimens from all over the country in order to confirm the diagnosis of Addison's disease and thus was able to amass a large case archive. He also rediscovered and confirmed the existence of Hodgkin's lymphoma, at the same time recognizing Hodgkin's priority and proposing the eponym. Honours and awards Spy in Vanity Fair, October 1892 Among his many services and honors, Wilks was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1870; was president of the Pathological Society (1881–1882); president of the Neurological Society (1887); member of the Senate of the University of London (1887–1900); member of the General Medicine Council (1887–1896) and president of the Royal College of Physicians (1896–1899). He was named Physician Extraordinary to Queen Victoria in 1897. The following year he was created a baronet, of Grosvenor Street in the Parish of Saint George Hanover Square in the County of London. Later life In later life he suffered a stroke and was terminally paraplegic. He died aged 87 at his home in Hampstead on 8 November 1911. After his death the baronetcy became extinct. He had married Mrs. Elizabeth Anne Prior, widow of previous employer Richard Prior; they had no children.

His alliance with the leaders of the First Crusade helped him rule his feudal holdings with commanding authority. Toros ejected the Byzantine garrisons from the fortifications at Anazarbus and Sis (ancient city), making the latter his capital. He was plagued by the nomadic Turks who were harassing him from the north but were driven back. He avenged the death of King Gagik II by killing his assassins. This act of revenge was often used by chroniclers of the 12th century as direct evidence connecting the Roupenians to the Bagratid lineage. During his time he bestowed favors and gave gifts and money to many monasteries for their decoration and adornment, in particular those of Drazark (Trassarg) and Mashgevar.  His life  Toros was the elder son of Constantine I, lord of Armenian Cilicia. It is likely that his mother was the great-granddaughter of Bardas Phokas. Toros succeeded his father and ruled from the fortresses of Vahka (today Feke in Turkey) and Pardzepert (today Andırın in Turkey). In 1107, encouraged by Tancred, Prince of Antioch, Toros followed the course of the Pyramus River (today the river Ceyhan in Turkey), and seized the strongholds of Anazarbus (a place which had been considered impregnable) and Sis (ancient city). Toros extensively rebuilt the fortifications at both fortresses with tall circuit walls and massive round towers. In the south bailey of the castle at Anazarbus he commemorated his victories by constructing a three-aisle, barrel-vaulted basilica, which he consecrated to St Zoravark and where he reportedly housed the ancestral treasures of King Gagik II. A beautifully executed dedicatory inscription on the church (dated ca. A.D.1111) records his triumph, and most importantly, traces his Rubenid genealogy. In 1108, Daphar, the leader of the nomadic Turks, invaded the province of Hasamansur and ravaged the lands around Melitene (today Malataya in Turkey). Toros called for the help of Basilius the Crafty, an Armenian noble who governed possessions in the vicinity of Marash (today Kahramanmaraş in Turkey) and Kesoun. Basilius and his allies attacked Daphar and achieved a resounding victory near the castle of Harthan. Basilius nobly shared with Toros the spoils which were taken from the Turks. In 1111, Sultan Malik Shah of Iconium entered Armenian territories, and Toros’s two commanders were killed in battle. However, his brother, Levon launched a savage attack against the Turks and drove them into retreat. Toros, who had relentlessly pursued the murderers of King Gagik II, laid an ambush for them at their castle, Cyzistra (Kizistra) in 1112. At an opportune time, his infantry surprised the garrison and occupied the castle, plundered it then took blood revenge by killing all its inhabitants. The three brothers (the assassins of Gagik II) were taken captive and forced to produce Gagik’s kingly sword and his royal apparel taken at the time of the murder. One of the brothers was beaten to death by Toros who justified his brutal action by exclaiming that such monsters did not deserve to perish by the quick plunge of a dagger. In 1114, Vasil Dgha (the heir of Basilius the Crafty) invited Il- Bursuqi (the governor of Mosul) to deliver the Armenians from the Franks (the Crusaders). The Franks advanced to punish Vasil Dgha, but they were unable to take his fortress capital at Raban. Nevertheless, he thought it wise to seek alliance with Toros. Toros, after inviting him to come to discuss a marriage alliance, imprisoned him and sold him to Count Baldwin II of Edessa in 1116. Having thus annexed Raban, Baldwin II of Edessa decided to suppress the remaining Armenian principalities in the Euphrates valley; thus Toros soon found himself the only independent Armenian potentate that remained. In 1118, Toros sent a contingent of troops under the command of his brother Levon to help Prince Roger of Antioch in the capture of Azaz (today A'zāz in Syria).

It is located halfway between Hibberdene and Margate and is positioned 120 km south of Durban. It is the administrative, educational and commercial centre for southern Natal.  History  The town was founded in 1867 when marble was discovered near the Mzimkhulu River mouth, and is named after Sir Theophilus Shepstone of the Natal government of the 1880s. William Bazley built a harbour, and the first coaster entered the harbour on May 8, 1880. In 1882 a party of 246 Norwegian immigrants settled in the town and subsequently started to play a major role in the development of the area. Post the opening of the railway to Durban in 1901, the harbour fell into disuse and eventually the river silted up again, making it impossible to use. The 27,000-candela lighthouse still stands at the mouth of the Mzimkulu River. =Norwegian settlers= Norwegian immigration to Port Shepstone began in the late 19th century, when 246 Norwegians (along with 175 Briton and 112 German settlers) came ashore with a steamship which arrived in 1882. The soon-to-be settlers founded a nearby interior village within the same year, known as Marburg. The Norwegian settlers played a large role in the development of not only Marburg, but also Port Shepstone and nearby areas. Norwegian immigration to the region was a result of the Natal Immigration Board’s efforts to claim land for Europeans in South Africa. When the Norwegians first arrived, they were the largest European group in Alfred County. Remains of the Norwegian presence can still be seen today in certain places of the town, such as, Fredheim and Oslo Beach, with its main street King Haakon Drive.Odén, Bertil and Haroub Othman (1989). Regional Cooperation in Southern Africa: A Post-apartheid Perspective. Nordic Africa Institute. Pages 38-39. . The Norwegians erected a Norwegian Lutheran church, school, cultural hall, choir, and rowing club. A newspaper in Norwegian language was also distributed in Port Shepstone. Drinks such as akvavit and cuisine, including cheese from soured milk, were easily accessible.Kjerland, Kirsten Alsaker (2014). Navigating Colonial Orders: Norwegian Entrepreneurship in Africa and Oceania. Berghahn Books. Page XV. . When the Norwegians arrived, few European settlers lived in the area and the town of Port Shepstone consisted of one hotel, two cabins, one shop, and little else.Lund, Fredrik Larsen (2017). Norske utposter. Vega forlag. Page 345. . =After Norwegian settlement= Port Shepstone was declared “a full fiscal port’ in 1893, and after Durban officially became the region’s second harbour. Eventually, though, the ongoing wreckages and arrival of the railway, was to see the gradual closure of the harbour and the start of the real Port Shepstone boom. When the railroad arrived in Port Shepstone in 1901, the travel time to Durban was reduced to five hours, and the city became far less isolated. The railway connection opened for increased immigration for other settlers, and the Norwegians were soon outnumbered by German and British settlers. Between 1911-12, the number of students at the Norwegian school became too low for the school to keep open, and it consequentially closed.Lund, Fredrik Larsen (2017). Norske utposter. Vega forlag. Pages 390-391. .  Administration  Port Shepstone is governed by the Ray Nkonyeni Local Municipality, which is part of the larger Ugu District Municipality. It is not only a regional economic hub for the South Coast but also the seat for both Ray Nkonyeni and Ugu municipalities.  Geography  The town lies on the Indian Ocean coastline, which lies to the east and is surrounded by its extensions of Umtentweni to the north, Boboyi to the west and Shelly Beach to the south. Port Shepstone's greater area extends from Oslo Beach in the south, to Melville in the north and Merlewood in the west. Nearby towns include Margate, Hibberdene, Boboyi, Shelly Beach and Uvongo. =Suburbs= *Albersville *Anerley * Bomela * Broadview Estate * Grosvenor * Lion's Grove * Louisiana * Melville * Merlewood *Marburg * Mzimakwe *Oslo Beach * Sea Park * Southport * Sunwich Port * Umbango *Umtentweni = Climate =  Facilities  Port Shepstone has two police stations and two hospitals, Port Shepstone Regional Hospital and Hibiscus Private Hospital.https://www.hph.co.za, and two shopping centers, notably, Shelly Centrehttps://foursquare.com/v/sheppie- mall/50bf19a9e4b0977f877a8c8et has a variety of shops and shopping centres like Sheppy Mall and Oribi Plaza. The Port Shepstone Country Club is located on the northern banks of the Mzimkhulu River opposite the CBD in Umtentweni. Other golf courses in the broader area are in Margate, Southbroom, Hibberdene, Pennington and Scottburgh. Education The first school was opened in 1883, but by 1950, the school became too small. The Port Shepstone School split into two, the Port Shepstone Primary School and the Port Shepstone High School. There is also the Port Shepstone Secondary School. There are other schools in the surrounding areas such as Mlonde High School, Marburg Secondary School, Marburg Primary School, R.A Engar Primary School, Jai Hind Primary School, Margate Middle School and Margate Primary. Economy As the KZN South Coast's main economic hub, Port Shepstone includes the head offices for the Ugu District Municipality and Ray Nkonyeni Local Municipality. There is also a Magistrates court and the Department of Home Affairs, South African Social Security Agency (SASSA), Small Enterprise Development Agency (SEDA) and the South African Revenue Service (SARS) have regional offices in Port Shepstone. The manufacturing hub in the KwaZulu-Natal South Coast is mainly centered around Port Shepstone, especially around Marburg, which is a suburb that lies west of Port Shepstone and is the KZN South Coast's main industrial hub. The town's industries also include a sugar mill, a lime works and a marble quarry. Additionally, timber, wattle bark and sub-tropical fruit are produced in the district.  Tourism  Port Shepstone is not only an economic hub in the South Coast but is also a tourist hub. Attractions include the Mzimkhulu River Marina, which has leisure boat trips on the river in which people can admire the rich wildlife and bird life along the banks of the river. Other attractions include the Port Shepstone Museum; the museum includes the town's history with a series of exhibits carrying a maritime theme; the Port Shepstone Lighthouse, which has a 27 000 candela lighthouse that still stands at the mouth of the Mzimkhulu River. The present day cast iron lighthouse was erected during 1906 and can still be explored today. Attractions in the broader area (KZN South Coast) include the Oribi Gorge 21 km west of Port Shepstone, Aliwal Shoal, Umtanvuma Nature Reserve, Pure Venom Reptile Farm and the Riverbend Crocodile Farm among others. Beaches in the greater Port Shepstone area include Anerley, Banana Beach, Melville, Oslo Beach, Port Shepstone (main beach), Sea Park, Southport, Sunwich Port and Umtentweni. Media Local newspapers in Port Shepstone include the South Coast Herald and South Coast Fever which serve the entierty of the KwaZulu-Natal South Coast. The Ugu Youth Radio is a youth radio which is based in Port Shepstone and caters to the needs of the Zulu-speaking community. Other radios which serve Port Shepstone and surroundings include East Coast Radio, Gagasi FM, Vuma FM and Ukhozi FM, all of which are based either to the North of KwaZulu- Natal or central Durban. Transport =Air= The nearest airport is Margate Airport, which is located in the namesake town and is about 20 km south-west of Port Shepstone. The airport is small-scale, and only offers one scheduled domestic route to Johannesburg. King Shaka International Airport, near Durban, is about 165 km north-east of Port Shepstone and has many domestic and international air routes. =Busses= Bus companies that operate long-distance routes to and from Port Shepstone include Intercape, Greyhound and Citiliner. These buses normally terminate around the Central Business District (CBD) near Port Shepstone High School, Shell petrol station or opposite Oribi Plaza Shopping Centre. =Rail= Port Shepstone railway station opened in 1917, serving as both the southern terminus of the Cape gauge line from & to Durban, as well as the southern coastal terminus of the narrow gauge Alfred County Railway to Harding. After the standard gauge Transnet passenger services shut down in 1986, the ACR continued operations until 2005, when the famous Banana Express ceased operation. =Road= Exit 51 of the N2 highway in Port Shepstone with a board sign indicating the exit to Port Shepstone North and St Faith's The N2 highway from Durban has two off ramps in Port Shepstone, exit 45 and exit 51. Exit 45 is where the N2 meets the R61 highway to Margate and Port Edward and is where the N2 goes inland, away from the coast towards Kokstad. The off-ramp is also where the Oribi Toll Plaza is situated and as from there the R61 completes the last leg of the South Coast Toll Route. Exit 51 is located north of Port Shepstone in Umtentweni and the road at the off-ramp connects to Umtentweni and St Faith's. An alternative route to the South Coast Toll Route is to either take the R102 if heading north towards Durban or south towards Port Shepstone and the R620 heading south towards Margate and Southbroom and north towards Port Shepstone.

Watercolour by Ilya Repin (1868) A Song about Tsar Ivan Vasilyevich, the Young Oprichnik, and the Valorous Merchant Kalashnikov (Russian: Песня про царя Ивана Васильевича, молодого опричника и удалого купца Калашникова), often abbreviated as The Song of the Merchant Kalashnikov, is a poem by Mikhail Lermontov written in 1837 and first published in 1838. The plot of the poem is set during Oprichnina times. Rhythmically, Kalashnikov is patterned after bylina, the Russian folk epic. Its most famous scene describes a fistfight between the protagonists, Kalashnikov and oprichnik Kiribeevich. Plot The first scene of the poem describes a banquet at the Tsar's palace. Ivan The Terrible is strictly watching his Boyars and Oprichniki and suddenly notices that the young Oprichnik named Kiribeevich doesn't eat or drink anything and doesn't seem to enjoy the feast. When asked for a reason, Kiribeevich tells the Tsar that he fell in love with a girl named Alyona Dmitrievna. Ivan wants to help his favorite Oprichnik to organize the wedding and gives him expensive jewelry to be gifted to his future bride. But Kiribeevich doesn't mention the fact that Alyona Dmitrievna is already married to a merchant named Stepan Kalashnikov. Very late in the evening of the same day, Alyona Dmitrievna, bareheaded, her clothes ripped, comes to her house and tells Stepan that Kiribeevich abused her when she was on her way home from the church. Kalashnikov decides to defend the honor of his family and to avenge his wife by fighting the Oprichnik in a fistfight. The fistfight is held the next morning, with the Tsar attending. Kiribeevich, being considered the best fighter, calls anyone to fight him, but no one dares. Suddenly, Kalashikov comes and accepts the challenge. Allegorically, the merchant makes Oprichnik understand who he is and why he wants to fight Kiribeevich, much to latter's concern. Before fighting, Kiribeevich bows to Ivan The Terrible. Kalashnikov first bows to the Tsar, then to Kremlin and churches, and finally - to all the Russian people. The fistfight begins. Kiribeevich strikes his opponent in his chest so hard that merchant's copper crucifix bent and entered Kalashnikov's flesh. But the merchant gets up and strikes back, hitting Oprichnik in his temple and thus killing him. Such actions were prohibited by Russian law, and the violator was to be executed. Furious, Ivan IV asks Kalashnikov if he has done it accidentally or not. Being a novice fighter, Kalashnikov could refer to his lack of experience, but instead he confesses that he had done it voluntarily and agrees to the death penalty. The Tsar, amazed by the merchant's sincerity, fulfills his last wish: to take care of his family.

It situated on the mouth of the Mpambanyoni River (confuser of birds). Neighbouring towns include Pennington, Renishaw, Freeland Park, Umkomaas, Sezela, Bazley, Amahlongwa, Clansthal, Park Rynie and Dududu.  History  Named after Natal Colony Governor John Scott, in 1860 it became the second township at the end of Durban, but was initially known as Devonport. Scottburgh then became a very promising port as well as a new attractive location for sugar farms and sugar mills. In about 1850 the town started to attract immigrants especially from the United Kingdom, known as the Byrne Settlers. They came to take advantage of the good harbours, to export their sugar both internally and externally. Scottburgh became an independent municipality in 1964. Beaches An aerial view of Scottburgh Scottburgh Main beach along with Pennington and Park Rynie have been awarded blue flag status as of the 2014/15 summer season. Scottburgh and Pennington are both very popular for tourists to make their way to the beach. Scottburgh along with the two hotels and many B&Bs; is also home to an award-winning caravan park and camping ground. The summer season sees many tourists from the inland flock to the beaches of the South Coast. There are many activities that contribute to Scottburgh being a popular destination such as Microlighting, Diving, Shark cage diving, Sea rides, Rock and surf fishing, Surfing, Umdoni Park run, Bicycle trails. There are many more activities that can be inquired at the local South Coast tourism office. A microlight view of Scottburgh beach  Geography  Scottburgh is a bay situated on the South Bank of the Mpambanyoni River, a short river that culminates in a lagoon. It is one of the best geographic examples of a bay on the South African coast. Mpambanyoni mouth has fluctuated in surface area and volume dramatically over the years, largely due to the frequent droughts, occasional cyclones, and other extreme weather conditions that can affect KwaZulu-Natal. Scottburgh can be separated into neighbourhoods: Scottburgh Central (north), Scottburgh South, Freeland Park (which is situated on the north side of the Mpambanyoni River). Most notorious of the above-mentioned cyclones was Domoina of 1984 and the floods of 1987, which resulted in widespread flooding and infrastructural damage, including the destruction of the Old Main Road bridge from Umkomaas.  Education  Scottburgh has a number of educational institutions, including pre-primary schools, a co-ed primary school, and an English medium co-ed high school. Scottburgh Pre-Primary Hilltop Pre-Primary Casa di Montessori Pre- School Scottburgh Primary (Grades 1-7), http://www.sps.org.za/. Scottburgh High School (Grades 8-12) http://www.scottburghhigh.co.za/ Umdoni Christian Academy (Grades R-12) http://umdonica.co.za/ Scottburgh Primary School in 1925  Wildlife  Wildlife found regularly inside the township includes snakes, skinks, geckos, numerous insects, millipedes, bushbuck, mongi, and most famously, large numbers of vervet monkeys. Genets have been sighted, and there are occasional unverified spottings of civets and similar small felines and cat-like mammals. Birds are abundant, perhaps the most noticeable being the raucous and much-loved hadeda ibis. The Indian mynah is widespread but regarded as a pest due to its habits of defecating in public restaurants and eating areas and pillaging the nests of native birds. This bird has presented similar problems in other areas in South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. The sardine run is also visible from the shores of Scottburgh and its surroundings most winters. The umdoni and Strelitzia are the best-known trees specifically associated with Scottburgh and its environs.  Famous inhabitants  Well-known people associated with Scottburgh include world- renowned conservationist and author Dr Thomas Chalmers Robertson, former Springbok rugby player Joel Stransky, the late conservationist Tony Pooley, and Dave Bell.  Economy  Scottburgh is also particularly renowned for its large surfing community. Superior waves are to be found along the coast, especially during the winter months. Popular spots include Green Point, Pennington, Kelso, Scottburgh and Rocky Bay. Many other perfect breaks along this coast can be found. Surfers and bodyboarders from around the world come for surf trips around the south coast, and would visit Scottburgh in particular for its worldwide surfing reputation. However, one appeal of Scottburgh beach is its grass-covered banks leading down to sandy beaches, which have made it a popular holiday resort for holidaymakers for many years. Most Scottburgh residents work for small local businesses or the state sector, while larger industries are located in the nearby towns of Umkomaas, Umzinto, and Sezela. North of the Mpambanyoni lies the suburb of Freeland Park, largely residential but also possessing the Cutty Sark Hotel and a river populated by juvenile and adolescent crocodiles. These crocodiles are also the product of the 1987 cyclone, when infant crocodiles escaped from the nearby Crocworld theme park. South of Scottburgh proper, and separated from it by the Country Club, Golf Course, and a considerable expanse of bush, is Scottburgh South, and a few kilometres inland lies the sugarcane farming hamlet of Renishaw, well known for its chapel.

Information systems implement backup and disaster recovery equipment and processes to prevent data loss or restore lost data. Data loss can also occur if the physical medium containing the data is lost or stolen. Data loss is distinguished from data unavailability, which may arise from a network outage. Although the two have substantially similar consequences for users, data unavailability is temporary, while data loss may be permanent. Data loss is also distinct from data breach, an incident where data falls into the wrong hands, although the term data loss has been used in those incidents. Types *Procedural * Intentional Action ** Intentional deletion of a file or program * Unintentional Action ** Accidental deletion of a file or program ** Misplacement of CDs or Memory sticks ** Administration errors ** Inability to read unknown file format * Failure ** Power failure, resulting in data in volatile memory not being saved to permanent memory. ** Hardware failure, such as a head crash in a hard disk. ** A software crash or freeze, resulting in data not being saved. ** Software bugs or poor usability, such as not confirming a file delete command. ** Business failure (vendor bankruptcy), where data is stored with a software vendor using Software-as-a-service and SaaS data escrow has not been provisioned. ** Data corruption, such as file system corruption or database corruption. * Disaster ** Natural disaster, earthquake, flood, tornado, etc. ** Fire * Crime ** Theft, hacking, SQL injection, sabotage, etc. ** A malicious act, such as a worm, virus, Ransomware, hacking or theft of physical media. Studies show hardware failure and human error are the two most common causes of data loss, accounting for roughly three quarters of all incidents.The cost of lost data - Graziadio Business Report Another cause of data loss is a natural disaster, which is a greater risk dependent on where the hardware is located. While the probability of data loss due to natural disaster is small, the only way to prepare for such an event is to store backup data in a separate physical location. As such, the best backup plans always include at least one copy being stored off- site. Cost The cost of a data loss event is directly related to the value of the data and the length of time that it is unavailable yet needed. For an enterprise in particular, the definition of cost extends beyond the financial and can also include time. Consider: * The cost of continuing without the data * The cost of recreating the data * The cost of notifying users in the event of a compromise Prevention The frequency of data loss and the impact can be greatly mitigated by taking proper precautions, those of which necessary can vary depending on the type of data loss. For example, multiple power circuits with battery backup and a generator only protect against power failures, though using an Uninterruptable Power Supply can protect drive against sudden power spikes. Similarly, using a journaling file system and RAID storage only protect against certain types of software and hardware failure. For hard disk drives, which are a physical storage medium, ensuring minimal vibration and movement will help protect against damaging the components internally, as can maintaining a suitable drive temperature. Regular data backups are an important asset to have when trying to recover after a data loss event, but they do not prevent user errors or system failures. As such, a data backup plan needs to be established and run in unison with a disaster recovery plan in order to lower risk. Data recovery Media that's suffered a catastrophic electronic failure requires data recovery in order to salvage its contents. Data recovery is often performed by specialized commercial services that have developed often proprietary methods to recover data from physically damaged media. Service costs at data recovery labs are usually dependent on type of damage and type of storage medium, as well as the required security or cleanroom procedures. File system corruption can frequently be repaired by the user or the system administrator. For example, a deleted file is typically not immediately overwritten on disk, but more often simply has its entry deleted from the file system index. In such a case, the deletion can be easily reversed. Successful recovery from data loss generally requires implementation of an effective backup strategy. Without an implemented backup strategy, recovery requires reinstallation of programs and regeneration of data. Even with an effective backup strategy, restoring a system to the precise state it was in prior to the Data Loss Event is extremely difficult. Some level of compromise between granularity of recoverability and cost is necessary. Furthermore, a Data Loss Event may not be immediately apparent. An effective backup strategy must also consider the cost of maintaining the ability to recover lost data for long periods of time. A highly effective backup system would have duplicate copies of every file and program that were immediately accessible whenever a Data Loss Event was noticed. However, in most situations, there is an inverse correlation between the value of a unit of data and the length of time it takes to notice the loss of that data. Taking this into consideration, many backup strategies decrease the granularity of restorability as the time increases since the potential Data Loss Event. By this logic, recovery from recent Data Loss Events is easier and more complete than recovery from Data Loss Events that happened further in the past. Recovery is also related to the type of Data Loss Event. Recovering a single lost file is substantially different from recovering an entire system that was destroyed in a disaster. An effective backup regimen has some proportionality between the magnitude of Data Loss and the magnitude of effort required to recover. For example, it should be far easier to restore the single lost file than to recover the entire system. =Initial steps upon data loss= If data loss occurs, a successful recovery must ensure that the deleted data is not over-written. For this reason — one should avoid all write operations to the affected storage device. This includes not starting the system to which the affected device is connected. This is because many operating systems create temporary files in order to boot, and these may overwrite areas of lost data — rendering it unrecoverable. Viewing web pages has the same effect — potentially overwriting lost files with the temporary HTML and image files created when viewing a web page. File operations such as copying, editing, or deleting should also be avoided. Upon realizing data loss has occurred, it is often best to shut down the computer and remove the drive in question from the unit. Re-attach this drive to a secondary computer with a write blocker device and then attempt to recover lost data. If possible, create an image of the drive in order to establish a secondary copy of the data. This can then be tested on, with recovery attempted, abolishing the risk of harming the source data.

Despite the overwhelming traditional Chinese influence, Japanese and Korean have influenced Taiwanese culture as well.黃文儀，《士大夫與羅漢腳》，《文教台灣》第092期 The common socio-political experience in Taiwan gradually developed into a sense of Taiwanese cultural identity and a feeling of Taiwanese cultural awareness, which has been widely debated domestically. Reflecting the continuing controversy surrounding the political status of Taiwan, politics continues to play a role in the conception and development of a Taiwanese cultural identity, especially in the prior dominant frame of a Taiwanese and Chinese dualism. In recent years, the concept of Taiwanese multiculturalism has been proposed as a relatively apolitical alternative view, which has allowed for the inclusion of mainlanders and other minority groups into the continuing re-definition of Taiwanese culture as collectively held systems of meaning and customary patterns of thought and behavior shared by the people of Taiwan. State cultural policy overview =Historical context= Taiwan's culture and cultural legacy has been largely shaped by the processes of imperialism and colonization as the structural and psychological effects of successive colonial projects have been integral to developing Taiwan's self-image and the evolution of both official and unofficial Taiwanese culture. For most of its colonized existence, Taiwan remained on the cultural margins, far from the centers of civil and cultural life of each regime, and with every regime change, Taiwan's cultural center shifted. At various times Taiwan's cultural center has been Indigenous Taiwan, Amsterdam, Xiamen (Amoy), Qing-era Beijing, Imperial Japan, postwar China and even, arguably, the United States. Bunun dancer in traditional aboriginal dress (1989) Before the Qing Empire ceded Taiwan to Japan in 1895, Taiwan's culture was characterized by Qing frontier societies of Han farmers and highland Aborigines. Due to Taiwan's strategic location along East Asian trade routes, Taiwanese were also exposed to cosmopolitan influences and the effects of European commerce. By the middle of the Japanese era (1895–1945), Taiwan had begun to shift from local to contemporary global culture, under the guidance of Japanese style \\"westernization\\". Beginning during Japan's build up for war, Japan invigorated its policies to Japanize Taiwan for mobilization against the Allies. Japan's effort taught Taiwan's elite, Japanese culture and language, but did not largely interfere in religious organization. When Japan's suppressive wartime policies were lifted following World War II, Taiwanese were eager to continue with their prewar cosmopolitan activities. Japan's colonial legacy has shaped many of the customs and mannerisms of Taiwanese. Japan's colonial legacy is still visible, due to Japan's massive effort in constructing Taiwan's economic infrastructure and industrial base, which is often cited as a major factor in Taiwan's rapid economic development. KMT era cultural policy During the early postwar period the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) suppressed Taiwanese cultural expression and barred Taiwanese from cosmopolitan life except in the spheres of science and technology. The authoritarian KMT dominated public cultural space and Chinese nationalist networks became a part of cultural institutions, leaving little resource for cultural autonomy to grow. Under the early KMT, Taiwan was realigned from a Japanese imperial center to a Chinese nationalist center, under the influence of KMT and American geo-political interests. Although American cultural activities were modest, they played a significant role in Taiwan's developing cultural scene. The KMT claimed a loss of morale led to \\"losing China\\" and thus the state issued a series of ideological reforms aimed to \\"retake\\" China, which became the major state cultural program of the time. The immediate preoccupation with losing China diverted long term investment in the humanities and social sciences. On another level, the state's main objective was to \\"sinicize\\" the Taiwanese by teaching them Mandarin Chinese and Nationalist ideology through compulsory primary education. By the late 1940s the KMT had eliminated dissent for its cultural policies. When Taiwanese had resumed the cultural activities, which were outlawed by the Japanese in 1937, the Nationalist attitude was that Taiwanese had been Japanese \\"slaves\\" and would therefore have to complete a period of moral and ideological tutelage before they could enjoy their full rights as citizens of the Republic of China. The February 28 Incident destroyed Taiwan's urban elite and the arrival of the mainlander elite ensured Nationalist domination of urban cultural centers. In 1953, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek issued his first major opinion on culture to complete Sun Yat- sen's Three Principles of the People, which included prescribing Nationalist curriculum for education, building facilities for intellectual and physical recreation and the major state cultural program of promoting anti-communist propaganda. In regard to Taiwanese cultural life, the major thrust was for \\"universalization\\" of education in Mandarin, which was enforced by law. Despite the hard-line Chinese control over culture, the Soviet advances in technology led to a new Nationalist focus on building closer cooperation with American universities and developing engineering programs. The American presence in Taiwan also encouraged Taiwanese to resume some politically, ethnically neutral cultural activities, which was expressed in a flourishing Taiwanese-language media market. Between the 1960s and the 1980s Taiwan's culture was described by its media as the contrast between Taiwan (Free China) and China (Communist China), often drawing from the official tropes of Taiwan as a bastion of traditional Chinese culture, which had preserved \\"true\\" Chinese values against the \\"false\\" Chinese values of post Communist China. At the same time, Taiwanese cultural expressions were brutally suppressed by Chiang Kai-shek and the KMT. In response to the Cultural Revolution of China, the government of Taiwan began promoting the Chinese Cultural Renaissance\\" (中華文化復興運動), with a myriad of programs designed to promote traditional Chinese culture to counter the communist movement on the mainland which aimed at uprooting the \\"Four Olds\\". These programs involved subsidized publication of Chinese Classics, the symbolic functions of the National Palace Museum, promoting famous prewar scholars to prominent positions in government and academic institutions, textbook and curriculum design with a focus on the official view of \\"traditional\\" Chinese culture and involvement in social and community events and the exemplification of Confucian ideology intertwined with Sun Yat-sen thought. Taiwanization =After 1975= Bentuhua or Taiwanization/Taiwanese localization has become, arguably, the most important symbol of cultural change over the past twenty years. Bentuhua describes the social and cultural movement by the people of Taiwan to identify with Taiwan's unique historical and cultural legacy. Bentuhua has often been associated with Taiwan Name Rectification Campaign, Taiwan Independence, and Taiwanese nationalism. Religion Yin and Yang symbol of Taoism The Dharmachakra represents the Noble Eightfold Path. The prevalent form of religious belief in Taiwan is a blend of Buddhism, Taoism, and Chinese folk religion, including Chinese ancestral worship, Mazu worship, Wang Ye worship and Zhai Jiao Traditions.TIO Gov Taiwan However, there are also large numbers of devotees to each of these belief systems.taipei times Apart from the syncretic form of traditional Chinese folk religion, Humanistic Buddhism is the major distinguishing trait of modern Taiwanese Buddhism. Humanistic Buddhism traces its roots to Chinese monk Venerable Taixu (1890–1947), who promoted more direct contributions to society through the Buddhist community and was a significant influence for Venerable Yin Shun, who is generally considered to be the key figure who brought Humanistic Buddhism to Taiwan. Christian churches have been active in Taiwan for many years, a majority of which are Protestant (with 2.6% of the population identifying themselves as Protestant) with Presbyterians playing a particularly significant role. The Presbyterian Church in Taiwan has been active in promoting human rights and the use of the spoken and written Taiwanese (see Pe̍h-ōe-jī), both during Japanese rule, as well as the martial law period of the Republic of China, during which the exclusive use of Mandarin was legally mandated. As such, the church has been associated with the Taiwan Name Rectification Campaign and the pan-green coalition. Several Taiwanese religious organizations have extended their operations beyond the country. Several organizations, especially Buddha's Light International Association (Fo Guang Shan), Tzu Chi Foundation, Dharma Drum Mountain and Chung Tai Shan, have set up branch temples (or centres) and extended their humanitarian or missionary works around the world. Buddhist- Taoist religious belief makes up 93%, Christian 4.5%, and others 2.5%. Food Pearl milk tea Pearl milk tea (also known as bubble tea or boba) is a popular tea drink available in many parts of the world. A notable Japanese influence exists due to the period when Taiwan was under Japanese rule. Taiwanese cuisine itself is often associated with influences from mid to southern provinces of China, most notably from the province of Fujian, but influences from all of China can easily be found due to the large number of Chinese who immigrated to Taiwan at end of the Chinese Civil War and when Taiwan was under Chinese rule (ROC). In the process, Taiwan developed a distinct style of cuisine. Languages The language with the most native speakers in Taiwan is Taiwanese Hokkien, or \\"Taiwanese\\" for short, spoken by about 70% of the population. People who emigrated from mainland China after 1949 (about 13% of the population) mostly speak Mandarin Chinese. The Hakka, who make about 13% of the population, speak the distinct Hakka language. The Formosan languages are the ethnic languages of the Taiwanese Aborigines, comprising about 2.3% of the island's population. Standard Chinese is the official language and is almost universally spoken and understood. English is taught universally, starting in elementary school. Taiwanese Mandarin, derived from Standard Chinese, is spoken at different levels according to the social class and situation of the speakers. Some terms have different meanings in Taiwan and mainland China, such as: 土豆 (tǔdòu), which means peanut in Taiwan, but potato in China. There also exist differences in official pronunciations of a few words such as 垃圾, which is pronounced lèsè in Taiwan but lājī in China, with the former being derived from Shanghainese. Art The artistic heritage of Taiwan is extremely diverse. Stonecutters of the Changbin culture began to make art on Taiwan at least 30,000 years ago. Around 5,000 years ago jade and earthenware works started to appear. Art was first institutionalized in Taiwan during the Japanese Colonial period and the establishment of public schools dedicated to the fine arts. The Japanese introduced oil and watercolor paintings to Taiwan and Taiwanese artists were heavily influenced by their Japanese counterparts. As was typical of colonel rulers Japanese did not establish tertiary institutions for art education in Taiwan, all students wishing to pursue an advanced degree in the arts had to travel to Japan to do so. When the Nationalists fled to Taiwan in 1949 they brought many of China's most prestigious artists with them. The Nationalists also established the first art colleges and universities in Taiwan. Along with Chinese influences the Nationalists also allowed the United States to establish a series of military bases in Taiwan, American pop culture and artistic ideas such as abstract expressionism were introduced to Taiwan by the Americans. Democratization in the late 1980s and the lifting of martial law granted Taiwanese artists freedom of expression for the first time in history. The economic boom of the '80s and ‘90s also saw the financial resources of Taiwanese museums and patrons increase significantly. By 1990 Taiwan was Asia's biggest art market. As Taiwan's art scene matured there began to be a greater specialization in exhibit spaces with dedicated museums for things like photography and ceramics opening. In the 21st century Taiwan's artistic community embraced new technologies and new mediums. While no longer the largest art market in Asia the tastes of Taiwan's collectors have matured and Taiwan remains the most cutting edge art market in Asia. Media Taiwan's freedom of press is guaranteed by the Constitution and its worldwide press freedom index ranks at 32 among 169 nations, as of 2007. Taiwan had been under martial law, with strict restrictions on the press and broadcasting, before political liberalization loosened restrictions in the 1980s. Sports Popular sports in Taiwan include: *Badminton *Baseball *Basketball *Cheerleading *Golf *Martial arts *Pool *Swimming *Table tennis *Tennis *Volleyball Athletes from Taiwan compete in international sporting events, often under the banner of \\"Chinese Taipei\\" due to PRC's opposition to the use of \\"Taiwan\\" or \\"ROC\\" under such circumstances. Tea Taiwanese tea culture, include tea arts, tea ceremony, and a very social way of enjoying tea. While the most common teas are oolongs, especially Taiwanese oolongs such as Iron Goddess and Alpine Oolong. However, black teas and green teas are also popular. Many of the classical arts can be seen in the tea culture, examples: calligraphy, flower arts, incense arts, and such. Recreation Entrance hall of a K-TV in Taipei Karaoke is incredibly popular in Taiwan, where it is termed KTV (karaoke television). This is an example of something the Taiwanese have drawn, on scale, from contemporary Japanese culture. Pachinko is another example. During typhoons, many young Taiwanese will spend the day singing karaoke or playing mahjong. Many people enjoy watching miniseries collectively called Taiwanese drama. Since 1999, hot springs, known as wēnquán in Chinese and onsen in Japanese, have been making a comeback thanks to efforts by the government. Over 100 hot springs have been discovered since the Japanese introduced their rich onsen culture to Taiwan, with the largest concentration on the northernmost part of Taiwan island. Anime and manga are very popular in Taiwan. Comics, including manga, are called manhua in Taiwan. It is common to see a manga rental shop or a manga store every couple of streets in larger cities. Convenience store culture Two 7-Eleven stores opposite each other on a crossroad. Taiwan has the highest density of 7-Eleven stores per person in the world Boasting over 9,200 convenience stores in an area of 35,980 km² and a population of 22.9 million, Taiwan has the Asia Pacific's and perhaps the world's highest density of convenience stores per person: one store per 2,500 people or .0004 stores per person. As of 1 January 2009, Taiwan also has 4,800 7-Eleven stores, and thus the world's highest density of 7-Elevens per person: one store per 4,786 people or .000210 stores per person. In Taipei, it is not unusual to see two 7-Elevens across the street from or several of them within a few hundred meters of each other. Because they are found nearly everywhere, convenience stores in Taiwan provide services on behalf of financial institutions or government agencies such as collection of the city parking fee, utility bills, traffic violation fines, and credit card payments. Eighty-one percent of urban household shoppers in Taiwan visit a convenience store each week. The idea of being able to purchase food items, drink, fast food, magazines, videos, computer games, and so on 24 hours a day and at any corner of a street makes life easier for Taiwan's extremely busy and rushed population. Convenience stores include: *OK (affiliated with Circle K until 2005) *FamilyMart *Hi-Life *7-Eleven Cram school culture Taiwan, like its neighbors in East Asia, is well known for its buxiban (補習班), often translated as cram school, and literally meaning \\"make-up class\\" or \\"catch-up class\\" or to learn more advanced classes. Nearly all students attend some sort of buxiban, whether for mathematics, computer skills, English, other foreign languages, or exam preparation (college, graduate school, TOEFL, GRE, SAT, etc.). This is perpetuated by a meritocratic culture that measures merit through testing, with entrance into college, graduate school, and government service decided entirely on testing. This has also led to a remarkable respect for degrees, including PhDs and overseas Western degrees (US and Great Britain). English teaching is a big business in Taiwan, with Taiwan, as part of its project to reinvigorate the Taiwan Miracle, aiming to become a trilingual country—fluent in Mandarin, Taiwanese, and English. Popular culture Cell phones are very popular in Taiwan. Mobile penetration rate stands at just over 100%. Because of their high use, phones in Taiwan have many functions and are becoming cheaper. Internet cafes are very popular with teenagers. They often sell food. Many gamers eat while using the internet. Many parents and teachers are concerned with the amount of time youth spend in the internet cafes. One of the best known figures in Taiwanese cinema is director Ang Lee, who has also made movies in the West and has won an Academy Award. Some popular pop artists in Taiwan include Leehom Wang, Jay Chou, Jolin Tsai, and David Tao. Some of them have gained international fame and toured Asian countries like Japan, Malaysia and Singapore. Since Taiwan is well known for its entertainment scene, some of its TV stations have organised talent search to find new and young talents to join the big family of pop culture here. Some successful bands like S.H.E were formed in the talent search. Hip- hop culture from the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan also flourished in Taiwan. J-pop, G-Unit and Eminem are also very popular as well. In this process, Taiwan produced several hip-hop artists, including Dog G, MC HotDog, Machi, and L.A. Boyz. Taiwanization of the culture of Taiwan has been a trend since democratisation in the 1980s and 1990s. In 2000, after half a century of Chinese Kuomintang (KMT) party rule, the first ever democratic change of ruling parties in Taiwan occurred with the election of Chen Shui- bian and his Taiwan-centric Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), marking an important step towards Taiwanization. While generally the KMT, the other major political party, is also more open to promoting Taiwan's cultural autonomy than in the past, the DPP made Taiwanization a key plank in its political platform. The Chen administration's policies included measures designed to focus on Taiwan while de-emphasizing cultural and historical ties to China. These policies included changes such as revising textbooks and changing school curricula to focus more on Taiwan's own history to the exclusion of China, and changing the names of institutions that contain \\"China\\" to \\"Taiwan\\". This sometimes led to incongruities such as Sun Yat-sen being treated as both a \\"foreign\\" (Chinese) historical figure and as the \\"Father of the Country\\" (Republic of China). These policies are called Taiwanization but have been attacked by detractors as \\"desinicization\\", which explains why these policies are generally applauded by most ethnic Taiwanese and opposed by the KMT. One phenomenon that has resulted from the Taiwanization movement is the advent of Taike subculture, in which people consciously adopt the wardrobe, language and cuisine to emphasize the uniqueness of popular, groundroots Taiwanese culture, which in previous times had often been seen as provincial and brutally suppressed by Chiang Kai-shek. The Kuomintang took power in 2008 with the election of Ma Ying-jeou to the presidency. The new KMT administration has controversially sought to reverse some of the desinicizing policies of the Chen administration, to various degrees of public support. The restoration of the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall to its former state has been generally supported. By contrast, a directive by the administration to foreign missions to henceforth refer to visits by foreign dignitaries as \\"visiting (cultural) China\\" has been rescinded after criticism from DPP legislators. NTNU Symphony Orchestra on stage in the National Concert Hall in Taipei and Play Saint- Saens's Organ Symphony No. 3 Since 1949, Taiwan had managed to develop itself into the center of Chinese pop culture (also known as \\"C-pop\\" or 中文流行文化). Today, the commercial Chinese music industry in the world (especially Mandopop and Taiwanese pop) is still largely dominated by Taiwanese pop artists. Successful Chinese pop artists from other countries (e.g. Stefanie Sun, JJ Lin from Singapore) are also trained, groomed and marketed in Taiwan. Chinese pop artists from other countries who wish to become successful usually have to go to Taiwan to develop their music career. Mandopop and Taiwanese (Hokkien) genre music continue to flourish in Taiwan today. Ever since the 1990s, Taiwanese variety shows (綜藝節目) had grown from its home base in Taiwan to other parts of the world. Today, it is widely watched and enjoyed by the Overseas Chinese communities in countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the United States.

He took no active part in the Confederate government, and was reinstated by a posthumous resolution in 1877. Early life Sebastian was born in Centerville, Tennessee in 1812; sometime around 1834 he graduated from Columbia College, also in Tennessee, and began studying law. In 1835 he was admitted to the bar and began practice in Helena, Arkansas; later he became a cotton planter.

It was the site of Confederate Fort Darling during the American Civil War. It was named for a local landowner, Confederate Captain Augustus H. Drewry. Drewry's Bluff in 1865, photo by Levy & Cohen from collection of U.S. Library of Congress At Richmond, Virginia, location of the fall line at the head of navigation, the generally west-to-east course of the James River turns almost due south for a distance of about before turning eastward again towards the Chesapeake Bay. At this sharp bend, Drewry's Bluff on the west side of the James River rose above the water, commanding a view of several miles' distance downstream and making it a logical site for defensive fortifications. During the American Civil War This 1862 map shows Drewry's Bluff at the bend in the river just below the \\"barrier to navigation.\\" On March 17, 1862, the men of Captain Drewry's Southside Artillery arrived at the bluff and began fortifying the area. They constructed earthworks, erected barracks, dug artillery emplacements, and mounted three large seacoast guns (one 10-inch Columbiad and two 8-inch Columbiads) in the fort. They were joined in early May by the crew of the Confederate ironclad CSS Virginia which had been scuttled at Craney Island on Hampton Roads to avoid capture as Norfolk fell to Union forces. Commander Ebeneezer Farrand supervised the defenses of the fort. He ordered numerous ships to be sunk as obstructions in the river beneath the bluff. Six more large guns occupied pits just upriver from the fort. Men worked around the clock to ensure a full state of readiness when the Union fleet arrived. The Battle of Drewry's Bluff took place on May 15, 1862. After considerable bombardment, the Union Naval vessels retreated, and Richmond was safe from attack by water. Drewry's Bluff saw no battle action for two years. Captain Sydney Smith Lee (General Robert E. Lee's brother) took command of the site and supervised its expansion and strengthening into a permanent fort. While some workers constructed an outer line of entrenchments to protect the land approach to Richmond, others built improvements for the fort, including a chapel, barracks, and quarters for the officers. During this time, Drewry's Bluff became an important training ground for the Confederate States Naval Academy and the Confederate Marine Corps Camp of Instruction. On May 5, 1864, Union Major General Benjamin F. Butler and his Army of the James landed at Bermuda Hundred, a neck of land north of City Point at the confluence of the James and Appomattox Rivers, only south of Richmond. Marching overland, they advanced within of Drewry's Bluff by May 9. While several Union regiments did manage to capture Fort Darling's outer defenses, delays by Union generals spoiled the success. Confederate infantry under General P. G. T. Beauregard seized the initiative and successfully counterattacked on May 16. Once again a Union drive on Richmond had been defeated at Drewry's Bluff. The area remained an integral part of Richmond's defense until the fall of Petersburg and Richmond. The garrison at Drewry's Bluff took part in the evacuation of Richmond and Petersburg on April 2–3, 1865. Once Fort Darling had been abandoned by the retreating Confederates, the Union forces quickly cleared a path through the obstructions in the James River beneath Drewry's Bluff. On April 4, 1865, President Abraham Lincoln and his son Tad passed the fort on the way up the James River to visit Richmond. Soldiers, sailors, and marines from Fort Darling joined the movement westward with Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, ultimately surrendering at Appomattox Court House. Many of the sailors served as infantry during the fighting along the way.

Two Virginia Historical Highway Markers, # VA-012 and # VA-053, are located on Jefferson Davis Memorial Highway (US Highways 1 & 301) nearby, and commemorate actions relating to Drewry's Bluff. The markers read: :Drewry's Bluff (VA-012), Chesterfield County, May 15, 1862 The James River was virtually undefended after the Confederates evacuated Norfolk and blew up the Virginia in early May. A Union naval advance on Richmond was blocked only by the defenses at Drewry's Bluff, sited above a turn in the river on the west bank, below the capital. This fort, known to the Federals as Fort Darling, was built on the land of Augustus Drewry. The garrison, commanded by CS Commander Ebenezer Farrand, included the former crew of the Virginia, the Southside Heavy Artillery (led by CS Captain Augustus Drewry), and other units manning the big guns. The Confederates had sunk several boats in the bed of the river to block access to Richmond. :On May 15 five warships of the James River Flotilla under USN Commander John Rodgers steamed up the James River where they were hit by accurate fire from Drewry's Bluff. The shells did little damage to the Monitor, but it was ineffective because the crew could not elevate the ship's guns enough to hit the battery on the bluff. The ironclad Galena was hammered by forty-five hits during the four-hour battle. Confederate sharpshooters along the banks successfully sniped at the sailors and wounded one ship's captain. The effective fire forced Rodgers to take his squadron back downriver, and the U.S. Navy abandoned its attempt to approach Richmond from the river. :Proctor's Creek (Drewry's Bluff), Virginia (VA-053), Chesterfield County, May 12–16, 1864 US General Butler withdrew the Army of the James into the entrenchments at Bermuda Hundred. CS General Beauregard cobbled together a force of 18,000 to confront Butler's 30,000. On May 12 at 4:00 a.m. Butler ordered US General Smith's corps out in a pouring rain to strike north along the Richmond and Petersburg Turnpike to attack the Confederate line at Drewry's Bluff on the James River. This action was designed to cover a cavalry raid by US Brigadier General August V. Kautz against the Richmond & Danville Railroad. Smith soon encountered CS General Hoke's Division deployed along the north bank of Proctor's Creek. The Federals halted to await reinforcements from US General Gillmore's X Corps. :On May 13 Gillmore circled to the west to outflank the Confederate line. Smith pushed across the creek to find that the Confederates had abandoned the works for a stronger fortified position to their rear. Gillmore flanked this line at Wooldridge Hill, and the Confederates retreated again. Beauregard arrived to take command of the Confederates the following day and constructed a new line extending westward from Drewry's Bluff. The Federals dug in before this new line. Butler's cautious advance gave Beauregard time to concentrate his forces. He summoned CS Major General W. H. C. Whiting's Division from Petersburg and planned a converging attack on the Union lines: Whiting would attack northward, hitting Butler's rear, while Hoke and CS General Ransom's Divisions, attacking en echelon from left to right, would drive the Federal right back from Drewry's Bluff. :Ransom, with his right anchored near Fort Stevens, attacked down the Old Stage Road through heavy fog on the morning of May 16. He rolled up the Union line from right to left until his offensive stalled--his troops could not see through the fog. Rather than counterattack, Smith ordered his troops to retreat to the turnpike. Whiting inched northward from Petersburg to Port Walthall Junction but missed the battle. Butler ordered his demoralized army back to Bermuda Hundred that afternoon, ending his offensive against Richmond.

They are used to boost morale, as well as for political propaganda or agitation. Amongst the most well-known revolutionary songs are \\"La Marseillaise\\" and \\"The Internationale\\". Many protest songs can be considered revolutionary - or later become canonized as revolutionary songs following a successful revolution. On the other hand, once a revolution is established, some of the aspects of protest song may be considered counter-revolutionary. Revolutionary songs are a notable part of propaganda. The singing of such songs is often considered as a demonstrative or revolutionary action. Such songs have been known to lend solidarity to disjointed political communities. Some revolutionary songs have appeared spontaneously; others have been written by notable authors, such as Bertolt Brecht. Revolutionary songs are frequently targeted at certain governments. By country Music was part of the cultural support of the earliest revolutions, and institutionalized as a genre of socialist or workers' music in countries including the Soviet Union, its former Eastern European satellites, China, Vietnam, Cuba and North Korea, as well as less permanent revolutionary movements in other countries. =French Revolution= During the French Revolution notable songs, beyond La Marseillaise, included Chant du départ, Carmagnole, Ah! ça ira, ça ira, ça ira (1790), Allons Français au Champs de Mars (1790), L'aristocratie en déroute (1790), Aux bons citoyens (1790), Le bonnet de la liberté, and many more. =American Revolution= Songs during the American Revolutionary War with revolutionary lyrics and propaganda purposes include songs such as \\"Dying Redcoat\\", \\"Free America\\", \\"Poor Old Tory\\", and \\"Jefferson and Liberty\\". =Greek Revolution= The successful Greek War of Independence between 1821 and 1832, generated not only revolutionary songs in Greece, but wide artistic and musical support from other western nations. =Revolutions of 1848= The Revolutions of 1848 in Europe generated a wide range of revolutionary, nationalist and patriotic popular song. This tapped into earlier support for the Napoleonic revolutions.James H.

One of the more popular Chinese revolutionary songs was \\"Nanniwan\\", a 1943 song lauding the exploits of the Chinese Red Army in a gorge in Shaanxi province near the revolutionary base of Yan'an. Revolutionary songs of Communist China often served to glorify the 1949 revolution and to present an image of unity amongst China's 56 ethnic groups and its various regions. Songs such as \\"The Sky Above the Liberated Zone\\" (praising the Communist Party of China and romanticizing life in the CCP-held liberated zones during the wars against Japan and the Kuomintang) and \\"Osmanthus Flowers Blooming Everywhere in August\\", a Red Army folk song from the Sichuan province, are among the best-known revolutionary songs from the wartime and Maoist periods in China. =North Korea= =Vietnam= Nhạc đỏ, \\"Red Music,\\" is the common name of the revolutionary music (nhạc cách mạng) genre in Vietnam.Alexander Cannon Reorienting the Voices in Nhạc cách mạng: Constructing Identity in Vietnamese Revolutionary Songs.

Another well known Latin American song, \\"El pueblo unido jamás será vencido\\" (1973), is not a revolutionary song, but a Chilean protest song in support of Salvador Allende. Cuban government sponsored revolutionary Nueva trova is often similar to Nueva canción, Latin American protest songs. =Iranian revolution= Following the Iranian revolution musicians were obliged to create music different from the pre-revolutionary music both in terms of rhythm and content.Sanam Zahir, The music of the children of revolution Page 9 The University of Arizona. Near Eastern Studies - 2008 \\"Musicians have been obliged to create Iranian music different from the pre-revolutionary music is terms of rhythm and content, resulting in the growth of Iranian music and emergence of different genres and lyrical content unique to ...\\" Iranian revolutionary songs () are epic ballads, composed during the Islamic Revolution in Iran in support of the revolution and in opposition to the Pahlavi dynasty. Before the success of the revolution, these chants were made by various political supporters- many of them recorded on cassette tapes in underground and home studios. On the anniversary of the revolution, many of the songs were broadcast by Iranian state television. In schools the songs have been sung by students as part of the celebrations Fajr for decades. Musical genres Some revolutionary songs intentionally mimic folk (children's) songs to make them palatable in non-political settings. An example of this type of song is a lullaby from Hungary (tentative translation follows), which starts off as a lullaby but shifts into more direct propaganda toward the end: > The bunch of little bears happily sleeping > And the pool sleeps on a soft pillow > The swing sleeps too, and the night will be their good blanket > Dream, my little one, soft dream flies > It flies to your eyes > Be silent, little baby > Our dreams were hushed away by the grim despotism > And only our hunger sung our song. Another example is \\"Tomorrow Belongs to Me\\", which is performed by a young man in the movie Cabaret. It starts off as a sweet folk song about nature, and then it becomes apparent that the young man is a member of the Hitlerjugend. Soon the song changes into a marching song, and the lyrics became a fascist propaganda about \\"rising up.\\" Another kind of revolutionary songs are folk songs that become popular or change lyrics during revolutions or civil wars. Typical examples, the Mexican song \\"La Cucaracha\\" and the Russian song \\"Yablochko\\" (Little Apple) have humorous (often darkly humorous) lyrics that come in easily remembered stanzas and vary highly from singer to singer. Psychology The effect of some revolutionary songs has been compared to a coordinated attack, inspiring individuals to merge themselves into a cohesive body.Page 362 1985 \\"Like the charge played at football games, or a trumpeted cavalry charge, revolutionary music is inspirational. It helps individuals overcome fear and raises their emotions to a higher pitch, so that they may be united with a larger group.\\" See also * Protest song * List of socialist songs * :fr:Liste de chansons révolutionnaires ou de résistance References Works about rebellions Political songs Political art Song ","title":"Revolutionary song"},{"id":"1381335","text":"Segmented file-transfer (also known as multisource file-transfer or swarming file-transfer) is a software method that is intended to improve file download speed. It works by simultaneously downloading different portions of the computer file sourced from either multiple servers or from a single server, recombining the parts into the single file requested. The majority of Download Manager applications work in this way.  History  Segmented downloads probably have an origin with NASA and the magnetic tape based file systems used on Deep Space Network craft such as those in the Voyager Program. However, from the 1960s to the 1980s there was a lot of experimentation with uploading, downloading (and synchronizing) data over bandwidth restricted telecommunications links by most mainframe computer users. So the early origins of segmented downloading are not historically clear. It is understood that some NASA missions use some kind of segmented downloading technique (for either file formats or data streams) : * Mars Rovers (for ICER image files) * New Horizons (for Jupiter flyby data) * Voyager Program (historical) Swarmcast was the first significant peer-to-peer (P2P) content delivery system that implemented a kind of segmented downloading technology. The program and protocol was invented and developed in 1999 by Justin Chapweske and sold to Opencola, which released the software under a GPL license. A lot of the terms used in segmented downloading technology have their origin with Swarmcast, with BitTorrent being the only other significant contributor to the terms in use.  Network implications  In this animation, the coloured bars beneath all of the clients represent individual pieces of the file. After the initial pieces transfer from the seed, the pieces are individually transferred from client to client. The original seeder only needs to send out one copy of the file for all the clients to receive a copy. Most IP networks are designed for users to download more than they upload, usually with an expected (Download:Upload) ratio of 3:1 or more. Segmented downloading, when used by only 20% of an ISP's user base, can upset the ISP's network to a point of requiring substantial reprogramming of routers and a rethink of network design. * Traditional web object caching technology (like the Squid proxy) is of no use here. * Universal adoption of IPv6 cannot help either, as it only allows all users to have fixed IP addresses. Fixed IP address don't fully address the routing table problems associated with segmented downloading. * Typical downloading configurations can have a single user in touch with up to 10 to 30 ephemeral users per file scattered across the global internet. * IP router tables can become bloated with routes to these ephemeral users slowing down table lookups.  Network advantages  * Large files can be made available efficiently to many other users by someone who does not have large upload bandwidth. * Routes to the more obscure parts of the Internet can assert themselves across most of the Internet—this is especially true for dial-up users * Segmented downloading does save some transmission capacity, as the number of lost or redundant megabytes is minimal compared to losing a prolonged http or ftp download Most ISPs have learned to cope with segmented downloading technology, but coping has meant the mandatory deployment of TCP/IP traffic shaping technology.  Limitations  Segmented downloading technology cannot magically solve all downloading problems. There are mathematical constraints on the effectiveness of the technology. In a group of users that has insufficient upload-bandwidth, with demand higher than supply. Segmented downloading can however very nicely handle traffic peaks, and it can also, to some degree, let uploaders upload \\"more often\\" to better utilize their connection. Data integrity issues * Very simple implementations of segmented downloading technology can often result in varying levels of file corruption, as there often is no way of knowing if all sources are actually uploading segments of the same file. * Data corruption problems have led to most programs using segmented downloading using some sort of checksum or hash algorithm to ensure file integrity (to receive file intact) and uniqueness (to not receive bits of other similar files). * Usually MD5 and SHA-1 hashes are preferred in most segmented download protocols, but CRC-64-ECMA would suffice in most cases. In cases where only MPEG files are being sent CRC-32-MPEG would also be acceptable. * In the future most segmented downloading technologies will probably use layered hashes and checksums like WHIRLPOOL, SHA-256, SHA-512 and CRC-64-ECMA (for individual segments) to unquestionably guarantee data integrity. MD5 and SHA-1 have been determined to be cryptographically weak with respect to protecting data integrity. = Segmented uploading = Although with respect to BitTorrent and other distributed file transfer protocols there is no difference between uploading and downloading (as clients can do both) or any meaningful distinction between client and server (as both are the same) there are some segmented uploading technologies that do exist. Space segment based telecom systems are the only widely known cases where segmented uploading technologies have emerged. This is mainly due to the limited bandwidth and other space segment constraints. * CCSDS software uploading protocols have the capability of segmented uploading, but current deployed systems have not been in need of the protocol being used in its most BitTorrent like capability. * Satellite direct to home subscription systems deployed in Europe and North America have employed an approach of upgrading software on customer devices by only sending a few bytes at a time (~2k or less) over a long period of time. Generally these segmented upload approaches are proprietary and related to the SIM card security and subscription mechanism. With respect to Direct To Home TV systems using segmented uploading to outwit \\"hackers\\" -- only SkyTV (UK) and DirecTV (USA) have been possibly linked to having the capability to do so or have done so in the past. However, one can assume that any modern MPEG2 DVB DTH mass subscriber system has the ability to accept software upgrades trickled to it at the rate of 8kb/day or less.

It lies north of the Mtanvuma Gorge which includes the Mtamvuma River and is the border between KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape.  History  In 1831 there was a crisis between the settlers in Port Natal (Durban) and Dingane, the Zulu king. Some settlers boarded a ship that was in the harbour and the others, including Henry Francis Fynn and his family, fled down the coast. The Zulu warriors caught up with them where Port Edward is today and massacred the fleeing settlers, which included local tribespeople of Langeni, on a hill called Isandlundlu (in English, shaped like a hut). The place has been known ever since as Tragedy Hill and its slopes are still littered with the bones of the victims. In 1552, the Portuguese carrick \\"Sao Joao\\" ran aground at Port Edward and this is the first time in recorded history that peoples from Europe met peoples from South Africa. In 1878, the ship \\"The Ivy\\" ran aground on Leisure Bay area beach. In 1925, the area was partly owned by TK Pringle, and he named the inland portion Banner Rest as this was where he wished to \\"strike his banner\\". The village was laid out and was named Port Edward in honour of the Prince of Wales, who later became King Edward VIII. The first holiday cottage in Port Edward was a shack built among the sand dunes in the early days by transport rider Edward Stafford. Unaware of their motility, however, he was surprised and dismayed to see his fine creation swallowed up. The area was subjected to several name changes as property was bought and sold, but the practice came to an end in 1952 when the town of Port Edward was ceremoniously dedicated to the then Prince of Wales. Geography =Location= Port Edward lies on the southernmost part of KwaZulu-Natal and lies north of the Mtamvuna River which is the border between KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape, south of Southbroom and west of the Indian Ocean. The coastline between Port Edward and Hibberdene to the north is popularly known as the Hibiscus Coast because of its lush sub-tropical gardens. =Suburbs= Port Edward's greater or suburban area stretches from Palm Beach in the north to Rennies Beach in the south. *Banners Rest *Black Rock *Doc Wilson Point *Ekubo Coastal Estate *Glenmore *Ivy Beach *Leisure Bay *Leisure Crest *Meadowbrook *Munster *North Sand Bluff *Palm Beach *Rennies Beach *Rocklands *Salmon Bay *Three Hills Tourism Port Edward is a tourist resort for seasonal visitors from more affluent regions of South Africa. There are many tourist seasons that influence Port Edward but the most significant is the Christmas/ New Year period spanning from early December to mid-January. Port Edward's Silver Beach hosts an annual New Year's Eve party frequented by youths whilst on New Year's Day itself, families populate the beach for continued celebrations. =Beaches= Beaches in the greater Port Edward area include: * Black Rock Beach * Dassie Beach * Glenmore Beach * Ivy Beach * Kidds Beach * Leisure Beach * Munster Beach * Palm Beach * Port Edward Main Beach: There is a ski boat launch facility at the main beach and it is also home to South Africa's longest supertube. * Portobello Beach * Rennies Beach * Salmon Bay Beach * Silver Beach: This beach is a popular fishing destination and fishing is one of the most popular sports in Port Edward. * Spiros Rocks Beach * T.O. Beach/Strand =Attractions= * Beaver Creek Coffee Estate is a café on Izingolweni Road. It also offers visitors a daily tour of the distinctive flavours of the world's coffee regions and how the coffee production works. * Red Desert Nature Conservation Reserve is a national heritage site and is reputed to be the smallest desert in the world with a width of just 200m, and is also used for hiking and mountain biking through the extra-terrestrial terrain. * Tragedy Hill is a sightseeing spot overlooking Silver Beach. It was named after an massacre whereby Zulu warriors massacred the family of pioneer Henry Flynn due to confusion over stolen cattle. The heartbroken Zulu King ordered the man who started the rumour to be executed by one of the surviving settlers who was given 5 heads of cattle as a reward. * Umtamvuna Nature Reserve is a nature reserve located on the banks of the Mtamvuna River on the outskirts of Port Edward * Wild Coast Sun is a casino and resort located on the opposite bank of the Mtamvuna River. It includes an 18-hole golf course and the famous Wild Waves Water Park which offers a variety of water sports. =Sardine Run= Another main season coincides with the Sardine run natural phenomenon usually occurring from late May to mid-July. Economy Recently large retail franchises Boxer Superstores and Shoprite Holdings have shown interest in Port Edward. With the local economy growing, the town is set for a bright future. Schools There are various small schools in Port Edward, some consisting of only 50+ children; however the most popular of these schools is Port Edward Primary School. Golf The only golf course in Port Edward is the Port Edward Country Club which is a 9-hole golf course. Surrounding 18-hole golf courses include Wild Coast Sun, San Lameer, Southbroom Golf Club, Margate Country Club, Port Shepstone Country Club, Umdoni Park and Selborne which are highly ranked by both Golf Digest and The Compleat Golfer. Transport =Air= The nearest airport is the Margate Airport about 32 km north-east of Port Edward in Margate. This airport offers one scheduled direct route to Johannesburg operated by CemAir. The nearest international airport is the King Shaka International Airport (KSIA) which is north of Durban and is 196 km north-west of Port Edward. KSIA offers regional flights to Southern Africa, intercontinental flights to Europe and Asia as well as many domestic flights. =Road= Port Edward is located on the R61 which is a regional route connecting to Port Shepstone via Southbroom, Ramsgate, Margate and Shelly Beach in the north and Beaufort West via Bizana, Mthatha, Port St. Johns and Komani in the south. The R61 meets with the N2 in Port Shepstone and the N2 further connects to Durban and Kokstad. The Izingolweni Road is a small road that connects to Izingolweni and is one of the alternatives for people traveling to Port Edward via the N2 and don't want to encounter with the Oribi Toll Plaza in Port Shepstone.

Different sources give various dates ranging from 19–10 BC. The date 19 BC is given by The Oxford Companion to Classical Literature, p. 74. in which he advises poets on the art of writing poetry and drama. The Ars Poetica has \\"exercised a great influence in later ages on European literature, notably on French drama\\"Howatson, M.C. The Oxford Companion to Classical Literature, 3rd ed. Oxford University Press, 2013, p. 75. and has inspired poets and authors since it was written.For a discussion of the Ars Poetica and related poems, see: Poets.org – http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/20035 Although it has been well- known since the Middle Ages, it has been used in literary criticism since the Renaissance.  Background  The poem was written in hexameter verse as an Epistle (or Letter) to Lucius Calpurnius Piso (the Roman senator and consul) and his two sons, and is sometimes referred to as the Epistula ad Pisones, or \\"Epistle to the Pisos\\". The first mention of its name as the \\"Ars Poetica\\" was c. 95 by the classical literary critic Quintilian in his Institutio Oratoria,Institutio Oratoria 8.60 (Also known as Institutes of Oratory in its Dedication to Trypho). See: Horace: Epistles Book II and Epistle to the Pisones (Ars Poetica), ed. by Niall Rudd. Cambridge University Press, 1990, p. 19. and since then it has been known by that name. The translations of the original epistle are typically in the form of prose. \\"Written, like Horace's other epistles of this period, in a loose conversational frame, Ars Poetica consists of 476 lines containing nearly 30 maxims for young poets.\\"Article on Ars Poetica. Encyclopædia Britannica Academic Edition, 2014. But Ars Poetica is not a systematic treatise of theory, and it wasn't intended to be. It is an inviting and lively poetic letter, composed for friends who appreciate poetic literature.Horace. Rudd, Niall, editor. Horace: Epistles Book II and Ars Poetica. Cambridge Greek and Latin Classics. Cambridge University Press. (January 26, 1990). page 34. Horace approaches poetry from a practical standpoint—as a craft, or ars—rather than the theoretical approach of his predecessors, Aristotle and the philosopher Plato. He also holds the poet in high regard, as opposed, for instance, to Plato, who distrusts mimesis and who has philosopher Socrates say in Book 10 of the Republic that he would banish poets from the ideal state.The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism, ed. by Vincent B. Leitch et al. New York: W.W. Norton & Co., 2001, p. 121 and p. 33.  Summary  The following is a brief outline of the main subjects of the work: (For a more detailed summary of Horace's Ars Poetica, see the article on Horace's Epistles – Epistle II.3).  Literary phrases  \\"Many of...[the] apt phrases [of the Ars Poetica]...have passed into common literary parlance.\\"Howatson, p. 75. Four quotations in particular are associated with the work: * \\"in medias res (l. 148)\\", or \\"into the middle of things\\". This describes a narrative technique of starting the story from its middle point. According to Horace, this entices the audience into the plot by making everyone curious about the characters' previous paths and their future destinies. The technique appeared frequently in ancient epics, and remains popular in modern narratives. * \\"ab ovo (l. 147)\\", or \\"from the beginning\\". As Homer did not initiate his epics about the Trojan War from the conception (thus, the egg – \\"ovo\\" in Latin) of Helen, poets and other story tellers should do something likewise: in other words, starting a story from its commencement will bore and fatigue audiences that may not be interested in a plot that is tediously inclusive. For another explanation of this mention of an egg, see Leda (mythology). * \\"quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus (l. 359)\\" or \\"sometimes even good Homer nods off\\". Today this expression is used to indicate that 1. even the most skilled poet can make continuity errors and 2. long works, usually epics (such as the Iliad or the Odyssey), may have their faults without that detracting significantly from their general quality. In context, however, Horace even censures Homer for such lapses. It reads \\"et idem  indignor quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus\\"; (I even castigate the good Homer for the same [fault of technical errors] whenever he nods off). * \\"ut pictura poesis (l. 361)\\", or \\"as is painting so is poetry\\", by which Horace meant that poetry, in its widest sense meaning \\"imaginative texts\\", merits the same careful interpretation that was in his day reserved for painting. :(The latter two phrases occur one after the other near the end of the poem).  Key concepts  The work is also known for its discussion of the principle of decorum (the use of appropriate vocabulary and diction in each style of writing) (l.81–106), and for Horace's criticisms of purple prose (purpureus pannus, l.15–16), a term coined by him to mean the use of flowery language.The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism, p. 123. This principle is considered a core component of Horatian poetics as it principally aimed to achieve verisimilitude in artistic representation, guiding everything from the choice of genre to diction, dramatic characterization, meter, poetic invention, and the intended effect. Some cited that decorum enforces subordination such as of parts to whole, woman to man, desire to reason, and individual to state. In line 191, Horace warns against deus ex machina, the practice of resolving a convoluted plot by having an Olympian god appear and set things right. Horace writes \\"Nec deus intersit, nisi dignus vindice nodus\\": \\"That a god not intervene, unless a knot show up that be worthy of such an untangler\\".Ars Poetica, line 191 Perhaps it can even be said that the quotability of Horace's Ars Poetica is what has given it a distinguished place in literary criticism: The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism says: The Horatian platitude is usually given as \\"instruct and delight\\", but sometimes as \\"instruct or delight\\". The first reading implies that all literature must be instructive. A related ambiguity is that \\"instruct\\" might be better translated as \\"help\\", \\"advise\\", or \\"warn\\". Horace repeats this maxim in different wordings: \\"Aut prodesse uolunt aut delectare poetae aut simul et iucunda et idonea dicere uitae\\" (The poet wishes to benefit or please, or to be pleasant and helpful at the same time), \\"miscuit utile dulci\\" (a mix of useful and sweet), and \\"delectando pariterque monendo\\" (delighting and advising). The Ars Poetica was first translated into English in 1566 by Thomas Drant.See the article on Thomas Drant by Fred Schurink in The Encyclopedia of English Renaissance Literature, Vol.1. Blackwell Publishing, 2012, pp.290–292. A translation by Ben Jonson was published posthumously in 1640.

Over the years, NYNME has premiered over 140 works, the vast majority of which were written specifically for the group. Among the prominent composers with whom the group has enjoyed longstanding associations are Elliott Carter, Jacob Druckman, Charles Wuorinen, Mario Davidovsky, Harvey Sollberger, Joan Tower, George Perle, Rand Steiger, John Eaton, and David Felder. The group's activities have also included tours in Europe, Asia, and South America. Current members include: flutist Emi Ferguson, clarinetist Jean Kopperud, violinist Linda Quan, cellist Chris Finckel, pianist Stephen Gosling, and percussionist Daniel Druckman. Sheree Clement has served as the ensemble's Executive Director since 2013. Previous membership The New York New Music Ensemble was founded in 1975 by conductor Robert Black, along with flutist Jayn Rosenfeld (who served as the ensemble's Executive Director between 1993 and 2013), clarinetist Laura Flax, violinist Gregory Fulkerson, cellist Eric Bartlett, and pianist Alan Feinberg. Percussionist Daniel Druckman joined in the early 1980s.

Typically, the thickness of one layer is several nanometers. It can also refer to a lower-dimensional structure such as an array of quantum dots or quantum wires.  Discovery  Superlattices were discovered early in 1925 by Johansson and Linde after the studies on gold-copper and palladium-copper systems through their special X-ray diffraction patterns. Further experimental observations and theoretical modifications on the field were done by Bradley and Jay, Gorsky, Borelius, Dehlinger and Graf, Bragg and Williams and Bethe. Theories were based on the transition of arrangement of atoms in crystal lattices from disordered state to an ordered state.  Mechanical properties  J.S. Koehler theoretically predicted that by using alternate (nano-)layers of materials with high and low elastic constants, shearing resistance is improved by up to 100 times as the Frank–Read source of dislocations cannot operate in the nanolayers. The increased mechanical hardness of such superlattice materials was confirmed firstly by Lehoczky in 1978 on Al-Cu and Al-Ag, and later on by several others, e.g. Barnett and Sproul on hard PVD coatings.  Semiconductor properties  If the superlattice is made of two semiconductor materials with different band gaps, each quantum well sets up new selection rules that affect the conditions for charges to flow through the structure. The two different semiconductor materials are deposited alternately on each other to form a periodic structure in the growth direction. Since the 1970 proposal of synthetic superlattices by Esaki and Tsu, advances in the physics of such ultra-fine semiconductors, presently called quantum structures, have been made. The concept of quantum confinement has led to the observation of quantum size effects in isolated quantum well heterostructures and is closely related to superlattices through the tunneling phenomena. Therefore, these two ideas are often discussed on the same physical basis, but each has different physics useful for applications in electric and optical devices.  Semiconductor superlattice types  Superlattice miniband structures depend on the heterostructure type, either type I, type II or type III. For type I the bottom of the conduction band and the top of the valence subband are formed in the same semiconductor layer. In type II the conduction and valence subbands are staggered in both real and reciprocal space, so that electrons and holes are confined in different layers. Type III superlattices involve semimetal material, such as HgTe/CdTe. Although the bottom of the conduction subband and the top of the valence subband are formed in the same semiconductor layer in Type III superlattice, which is similar with Type I superlattice, the band gap of Type III superlattices can be continuously adjusted from semiconductor to zero band gap material and to semimetal with negative band gap. Another class of quasiperiodic superlattices is named after Fibonacci. A Fibonacci superlattice can be viewed as a one-dimensional quasicrystal, where either electron hopping transfer or on-site energy takes two values arranged in a Fibonacci sequence.  Semiconductor materials  GaAs/AlAs superlattice and potential profile of conduction and valence bands along the growth direction (z).Semiconductor materials, which are used to fabricate the superlattice structures, may be divided by the element groups, IV, III-V and II-VI. While group III-V semiconductors (especially GaAs/AlxGa1−xAs) have been extensively studied, group IV heterostructures such as the SixGe1−x system are much more difficult to realize because of the large lattice mismatch. Nevertheless, the strain modification of the subband structures is interesting in these quantum structures and has attracted much attention. In the GaAs/AlAs system both the difference in lattice constant between GaAs and AlAs and the difference of their thermal expansion coefficient are small. Thus, the remaining strain at room temperature can be minimized after cooling from epitaxial growth temperatures. The first compositional superlattice was realized using the GaAs/AlxGa1−xAs material system. A graphene/boron nitride system forms a semiconductor superlattice once the two crystals are aligned. Its charge carriers move perpendicular to the electric field, with little energy dissipation. h-BN has a hexagonal structure similar to graphene's. The superlattice has broken inversion symmetry. Locally, topological currents are comparable in strength to the applied current, indicating large valley-Hall angles. =Production= Superlattices can be produced using various techniques, but the most common are molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) and sputtering. With these methods, layers can be produced with thicknesses of only a few atomic spacings. An example of specifying a superlattice is []20. It describes a bi-layer of 20Å of Iron (Fe) and 30Å of Vanadium (V) repeated 20 times, thus yielding a total thickness of 1000Å or 100 nm. The MBE technology as a means of fabricating semiconductor superlattices is of primary importance. In addition to the MBE technology, metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MO-CVD) has contributed to the development of superconductor superlattices, which are composed of quaternary III-V compound semiconductors like InGaAsP alloys. Newer techniques include a combination of gas source handling with ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) technologies such as metal-organic molecules as source materials and gas-source MBE using hybrid gases such as arsine () and phosphine () have been developed. Generally speaking MBE is a method of using three temperatures in binary systems, e.g., the substrate temperature, the source material temperature of the group III and the group V elements in the case of III-V compounds. The structural quality of the produced superlattices can be verified by means of X-ray diffraction or neutron diffraction spectra which contain characteristic satellite peaks. Other effects associated with the alternating layering are: giant magnetoresistance, tunable reflectivity for X-ray and neutron mirrors, neutron spin polarization, and changes in elastic and acoustic properties. Depending on the nature of its components, a superlattice may be called magnetic, optical or semiconducting. X-ray and neutron scattering from the [Fe20V30]20 superlattice.  Miniband structure  The schematic structure of a periodic superlattice is shown below, where A and B are two semiconductor materials of respective layer thickness a and b (period: d=a+b). When a and b are not too small compared with the interatomic spacing, an adequate approximation is obtained by replacing these fast varying potentials by an effective potential derived from the band structure of the original bulk semiconductors. It is straightforward to solve 1D Schrödinger equations in each of the individual layers, whose solutions \\\\psi are linear combinations of real or imaginary exponentials. For a large barrier thickness, tunneling is a weak perturbation with regard to the uncoupled dispersionless states, which are fully confined as well. In this case the dispersion relation E_z(k_z) , periodic over 2 \\\\pi /d with over d=a+b by virtue of the Bloch theorem, is fully sinusoidal: :\\\\ E_z(k_z)=\\\\frac{\\\\Delta}{2}(1-\\\\cos(k_z d)) and the effective mass changes sign for 2\\\\pi /d: :\\\\ {m^* = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{\\\\partial^2 E / \\\\partial k^2}}_{k=0} In the case of minibands, this sinusoidal character is no longer preserved. Only high up in the miniband (for wavevectors well beyond 2 \\\\pi /d) is the top actually 'sensed' and does the effective mass change sign. The shape of the miniband dispersion influences miniband transport profoundly and accurate dispersion relation calculations are required given wide minibands. The condition for observing single miniband transport is the absence of interminiband transfer by any process. The thermal quantum kBT should be much smaller than the energy difference E_2-E_1 between the first and second miniband, even in the presence of the applied electric field.  Bloch states  For an ideal superlattice a complete set of eigenstates states can be constructed by products of plane waves e^{ i \\\\mathbf{k} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{r} }/ 2\\\\pi and a z-dependent function f_k (z) which satisfies the eigenvalue equation : \\\\left( E_c(z) - \\\\frac{\\\\partial }{\\\\partial z} \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2 m_c (z)} \\\\frac{\\\\partial }{\\\\partial z} + \\\\frac {\\\\hbar^2 \\\\mathbf{k} ^2}{2m_c (z)} \\\\right) f_k (z) = E f_k (z) . As E_c (z) and m_c(z) are periodic functions with the superlattice period d, the eigenstates are Bloch state f_k (z)= \\\\phi _{q, \\\\mathbf{k}}(z) with energy E^ u (q, \\\\mathbf{k}). Within first-order perturbation theory in k2, one obtains the energy : E^ u (q, \\\\mathbf{k}) \\\\approx E^ u(q, \\\\mathbf{0}) + \\\\langle \\\\phi _{q, \\\\mathbf{k}} \\\\mid \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2 \\\\mathbf{k}^2}{2m_c (z)} \\\\mid \\\\phi _{q, \\\\mathbf{k}} \\\\rangle . Now, \\\\phi _{q, \\\\mathbf{0}} (z) will exhibit a larger probability in the well, so that it seems reasonable to replace the second term by : E_k = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2 \\\\mathbf{k}^2}{2m_w} where m_w is the effective mass of the quantum well.  Wannier functions  By definition the Bloch functions are delocalized over the whole superlattice. This may provide difficulties if electric fields are applied or effects due to the superlattice's finite length are considered. Therefore, it is often helpful to use different sets of basis states that are better localized. A tempting choice would be the use of eigenstates of single quantum wells. Nevertheless, such a choice has a severe shortcoming: the corresponding states are solutions of two different Hamiltonians, each neglecting the presence of the other well. Thus these states are not orthogonal, creating complications. Typically, the coupling is estimated by the transfer Hamiltonian within this approach. For these reasons, it is more convenient to use the set of Wannier functions.  Wannier–Stark ladder  Applying an electric field F to the superlattice structure causes the Hamiltonian to exhibit an additional scalar potential eφ(z) = −eFz that destroys the translational invariance. In this case, given an eigenstate with wavefunction \\\\Phi_0 (z) and energy E_0, then the set of states corresponding to wavefunctions \\\\Phi_j (z)= \\\\Phi_0 (z-jd) are eigenstates of the Hamiltonian with energies Ej = E0 − jeFd. These states are equally spaced both in energy and real space and form the so-called Wannier–Stark ladder. The potential \\\\Phi_0 (z) is not bounded for the infinite crystal, which implies a continuous energy spectrum. Nevertheless, the characteristic energy spectrum of these Wannier–Stark ladders could be resolved experimentally.  Transport  Overview of the different standard approaches for superlattice transport. The motion of charge carriers in a superlattice is different from that in the individual layers: mobility of charge carriers can be enhanced, which is beneficial for high-frequency devices, and specific optical properties are used in semiconductor lasers. If an external bias is applied to a conductor, such as a metal or a semiconductor, typically an electric current is generated. The magnitude of this current is determined by the band structure of the material, scattering processes, the applied field strength and the equilibrium carrier distribution of the conductor. A particular case of superlattices called superstripes are made of superconducting units separated by spacers. In each miniband the superconducting order parameter, called the superconducting gap, takes different values, producing a multi-gap, or two-gap or multiband superconductivity. Recently, Felix and Pereira investigated the thermal transport by phonons in periodic and quasiperiodic superlattices of graphene- hBN accordig to the Fibonacci sequence. They reported that the contribution of coherent thermal transport (phonons like-wave) was suppressed as quasiperiodicity increased.  Other dimensionalities  Soon after two- dimensional electron gases (2DEG) had become commonly available for experiments, research groups attempted to create structures that could be called 2D artificial crystals. The idea is to subject the electrons confined to an interface between two semiconductors (i.e. along z-direction) to an additional modulation potential V(x,y). Contrary to the classical superlattices (1D/3D, that is 1D modulation of electrons in 3D bulk) described above, this is typically achieved by treating the heterostructure surface: depositing a suitably patterned metallic gate or etching. If the amplitude of V(x,y) is large (take V(x,y)=-V_0(\\\\cos 2\\\\pi x/a+\\\\cos 2\\\\pi y/a), V_0>0 as an example) compared to the Fermi level, V_0\\\\gg E_f, the electrons in the superlattice should behave similarly to electrons in an atomic crystal with square lattice (in the example, these \\"atoms\\" would be located at positions (na,ma) where n,m are integers). The difference is in the length and energy scales. Lattice constants of atomic crystals are of the order of 1Å while those of superlattices (a) are several hundreds or thousands larger as dictated by technological limits (e.g. electron-beam lithography used for the patterning of the heterostructure surface). Energies are correspondingly smaller in superlattices. Using the simple quantum-mechanically confined- particle model suggests E\\\\propto 1/a^2. This relation is only a rough guide and actual calculations with currently topical graphene (a natural atomic crystal) and artificial graphene (superlattice) show that characteristic band widths are of the order of 1 eV and 10 meV, respectively. In the regime of weak modulation (V_0\\\\ll E_f), phenomena like commensurability oscillations or fractal energy spectra (Hofstadter butterfly) occur. Artificial two- dimensional crystals can be viewed as a 2D/2D case (2D modulation of a 2D system) and other combinations are experimentally available: an array of quantum wires (1D/2D) or 3D/3D photonic crystals.  Applications  The superlattice of palladium-copper system is used in high performance alloys to enable a higher electrical conductivity, which is favored by the ordered structure. Further alloying elements like silver, rhenium, rhodium and ruthenium are added for better mechanical strength and high temperature stability. This alloy is used for probe needles in probe cards.

It originated in Genoa and later became a typical food of the Ligurian Sea coast, from Nice to Elba island. History The origin of the dish is unknown, although various flat-bread techniques predate written history, as do chickpeas, and presumably chickpea flour. One origin-story says farinata was invented by a group of Roman soldiers who roasted chickpea-flour on a shield. Names In standard Italian, the dish is called farinata (\\"made of flour\\") while in Ligurian, specifically in the Genoese dialect, it goes by the name of fainâ . In Nice and the Côte d'Azur, it is called socca, in Tuscany, cecina (\\"made of chickpeas\\") or torta di ceci (\\"chickpea pie\\") and in Sardinia fainè. In Uruguay and Argentina it is massively popular and is called fainá. Cooking method It is made by stirring chickpea flour into a mixture of water and olive oil to form a loose batter, pouring it into a pan to make a pancake typically 4mm thick, and baking it for a few minutes, traditionally in an open oven in a tin-plated copper baking-pan. Farinata may be seasoned with fresh rosemary, pepper and sea salt. Traditionally farinata is cut into irregularly shaped triangular slices, and eaten (with no toppings) on small plates with optional black pepper. Elsewhere in Italy - traditionally in Tuscany, where it is called cecina (from the Italian word for chickpea, ceci) - it is served stuffed into small focaccia (mainly in Pisa) or between two slices of bread, as it is traditional in Livorno. It is sold in pizzerias and bakeries. Italian variations On the Tuscan coast, south of Liguria, especially in the province of Pisa, Livorno, Lucca, Massa Carrara cecina or, in Livorno, torta (di ceci) is baked (with no rosemary used for toppings). In Sassari, Sardinia, due to the historical ties with Genoa, la fainé genovese (genoese fainé), is a typical dish. In Savona province (near Genoa), a version of farinata called farinata bianca (white farinata) is used. It is made with wheat flour instead of chickpea flour. The name panissa or paniscia in Genoese indicates a solidified boiled polenta-like paste, made with the same ingredients as farinata. It can be cut into strips and fried, called panissette. In Genoa, variants of the farinata include sometimes onions or artichokes, but the most famous derivative recipe is the fainâ co i gianchetti (\\"farinata with whitebait\\"), at times hard to find due to fishing regulations, but traditionally seen as the quintessential fainâ. French variations Socca of Nice also known as La Cade in Toulon Socca, just coming out of the oven, in the old town of Nice, on the French Riviera Slices of socca at a Nice market *Socca is also a specialty of southeastern French cuisine, particularly in and around the city of Nicehttps://theculturetrip.com/europe/france/articles/a-brief-history-of- socca-frances-chickpea-pancake, and is the same as farinata. It may be baked on a tinned copper plate more than a meter in diameter. *Panisse is a specialty of Marseille, and is a similar dish, but thicker, and is typically cut into rectangles and fried. Elsewhere In Algeria, karantita is a similar dish which is very popular. It is served hot and dressed with cumin and harissa.La calentita , afaulxbriole.free.fr. In Argentina and Uruguay (where many thousands of Ligurian people emigrated between the 19th and the 20th centuries) farinata is known as fainá, similar to the original Genoese name fainâ. It is often eaten on top of pizza (a caballo). In Uruguay, \\"el fainá\\" (called \\"la fainá\\" in Argentina) is considered a traditional Uruguayan dish, brought by immigrants in 1915, so much so that 27 August has been called \\"Fainá Day\\". Olive oil, which is expensive, is not necessarily used; other vegetable oils may be used, which affects the flavour to some extent. In Gibraltar, where a significant portion of its population is of Genoese origin, it is known as calentita when it is baked or panissa when it is fried. They are typically eaten plain, without any toppings. These are considered to be Gibraltar's national dishes. In India, the dal (the word for pulses) \\"chila\\" (pronounced \\"cheela\\") or besan (the word for chickpea flour) \\"puda\\" (pronounced \\"poora\\"), depending on the region, is a similar dish made by cooking chickpea (or another pulse) flour and water on an oiled skillet. Vegetables such as onions, green chillies, cabbage and herbs and spices such as coriander are also added in certain versions of the preparation.

The nebula is embedded within the much larger Carina Nebula, a large star-forming H II region. From the Latin homunculus meaning Little Man, the nebula consists of gas which was ejected from Eta Carinae in 1841. It also contains dust which absorbs much of the light from the extremely luminous central stellar system and re-radiates it as infra-red (IR). It is the brightest object in the sky at mid-IR wavelengths. Within the Homunculus is a smaller Little Homunculus, and within that a shell of shocked material from stellar winds that has been called Baby Homunculus. Observational history In 1914, Eta Carinae was reported to have a faint companion and also to be non-stellar. Observations in 1944 and 1945 showed a somewhat elongated nebulosity around wide and long. It was measured to be expanding at a rate which was consistent with having originated in an explosion in the mid 19th century. At that time the shape of the nebula showed a central bulge with a single large lump to the northwest and two smaller extensions to the southeast, which was described as a Homunculus. Other observations at around the same time described a strongly orange central region in a larger fainter green nebulosity. One paper described it as looking like a \\"red spade-beard\\". Shape A 3D model of the Homunculus Nebula. The Homunculus consists of two lobes, referred to as northwest (NW) and southeast (SE) based on their orientation as seen from Earth. Each is approximately wide by long. There is also a ragged equatorial skirt of material which can be seen faintly in deep images at certain wavelengths. The lobes are mostly hollow with the material strongly concentrated towards the poles. The equatorial skirt appears to contain material of the same age and younger than the lobes. It contains a much smaller mass of material than the lobes, shining mainly by reflected light which escapes most easily at equatorial latitudes. There is less dust and little molecular hydrogen compared to the lobes. The bipolar nebula is angled so that the NW lobe is further away from Earth than the SE lobe is. The whole nebula is expanding so that the SE lobe is blue-shifted and the NW lobe is red-shifted, relative to the central source. The lobes contain the majority of the material in the Homunculus Nebula, in relatively thin shells concentrated towards the poles. The shells consist of two components, an inner warm region and a more massive outer cool skin. The shells are smooth and thin suggesting they were ejected in as little as five years, but there are streaks of thicker dust detectable within the shells. Detailed look on Eta Carinae. Carina Nebula (left), Homunculus Nebula (center), and high resolution image of Eta Carinae (right). Each lobe has polar \\"hole\\" although it is not known whether it is an actual gap in the shell of the lobe or just a deep indentation. Surrounding each polar hole is a \\"trench\\". The trenches are visible as approximate semicircles centred on the axis of the lobes but may form complete circles. There are other smaller irregular indentations and protrusions to the lobes, which are symmetrical with the same features appearing on each lobe. These include flattened protrusions at about 10° latitude, one on each lobe, with other smaller protrusions near the equatorial skirt. The mass of the nebula cannot be determined directly. However, the amount of dust can be measured fairly accurately and estimates of the gas to dust ratio used to calculate the total mass. The total dust mass is calculated at , leading to estimates that up to of gas are contained in the Homunculus itself. Nearly as much material is detected within outer ejecta, which formed earlier, but within the last thousand years. Older calculations had produce consensus estimates of Weigelt Blobs Early speckle interferometry showed that the central region of the Homunculus contains four point-like sources, originally designated A1, A2, A3, and A4. The four speckle objects were later referred to as A, B, C, and D. Higher resolution studies showed that only the brightest source A was truly stellar, and the other three were small nebular condensations. The three Weigelt Blobs are visible primarily in light directly reflected from the Eta Carinae stars. The blobs are believed to lie near the equatorial plane of the stellar system, but their origin is unclear. Their speed has been measured, but within uncertainties they could have been emitted in the 1890 outburst or a 1941 event. The situation is complicated further by the likely acceleration of their slow movement due to the intense stellar winds. Spectrum Hubble The spectrum of the Homunculus is complex, consisting of reflected, thermal, and emission components at wavelengths across the electromagnetic spectrum. The dominant feature is blackbody radiation from dust heated by the stars within. Overlaid on this is some light from the stars themselves reflected mostly from dense features within the nebulosity, showing strong visual and UV spectral lines in emission. There are also emission lines from ionised gas where it collides with slower moving material or is excited by high energy electromagnetic radiation from the stars. The ionisation emission is similar to a planetary nebula but at lower levels of ionisation due to the lower temperatures of the central stars. The strongest lines are [Fe ] and [N ], similar to those from the stellar winds of the stars themselves, but with narrower profiles. Shock waves at the outer edge of the ejecta are heated to millions of kelvin and emit x-ray radiation. The lobes of the Homunculus emit copious radio waves, including emission in the 21 cm line of hydrogen. The reflected spectrum of the Homunculus lobes varies with position, due to the central star emitting different radiation at different latitudes on its surface. This is the only star for which such an effect can be observed. Formation The Homunculus was ejected in an enormous outburst from Eta Carinae. Light from this event reached Earth in 1841, when Eta Carinae briefly became the second-brightest star in the sky, after Sirius; the ejected gas and dust have since obscured much of its light. The near-supernova explosion produced two polar lobes, and a large but thin equatorial disk, all moving outward at up to . The Homunculus Nebula is a virtually unique structure, believed to result from the extremely young age. This means that the shape and structure is almost entirely due to the original eruption rather than the interaction with surrounding interstellar material. Suggestions that the waist between the two lobes was formed by \\"pinching\\" from a dense surrounding material have been disproved, and the bipolar shells are now believed to be caused by concentrated polar outflows of material, with the equatorial skirt formed by breakout of faster ejected material through the thinnest parts of the shells. The ejection of material preferentially along the axis of rotation of the stars, or of the binary orbit, may be due to the rotation of Eta Carinae A itself resulting in stronger mass loss towards the poles. The thinness of the bipolar shells argues for their ejection within approximately five years. Irregularities in the otherwise very smooth structure of the shells are conjectured to result from interactions between the winds of the two central stars, and from their orbital motion. Analysis of the expansion of the nebula has given a time for its formation at . This date is inconsistent with the peaks in brightness and with estimates of the periastron passage of the secondary star. Distance Homunculus Nebula around Eta Carinae (HST UV and visual image) The Homunculus and Eta Carinae are assumed to be at approximately the same distance as Trumpler 16 and the Carina Nebula, but the distances to these objects are not known with any great accuracy. Instead, the distance of the Homunculus Nebula itself can be calculated using measurements of its expansion. The velocity of particular locations within the thin shell of the Homunculus lobes can be measured using the doppler shift of the spectral lines at that point, assuming the lobes are symmetrical. There are two different doppler shifts visible in the spectrum: one for direct emission lines; and one for reflected lines from Eta Carinae A. The direct line doppler shift gives the expansion velocity of the shell project onto the line of sight. Assuming an origin in Eta Carinae's Great Eruption and a constant expansion velocity, this gives the linear distance of the shell from the central star projected along the line of sight. The difference between the reflected line doppler shift velocity and the direct line velocity gives the distance of the shell from the central star, again assuming expansion at constant velocity since the Great Eruption. Observations of the spectrum of the Homunculus at a particular angular distance from the central star has shown the actual linear distance of that point from the central star, which defines the distance. Values obtained using this method are around with a margin of error around . The same calculations also return the inclination of the axis of the Homunculus relative to the line of sight. This turns out to be 41°, or 49° relative to the plane of the sky, which means it is slightly more \\"end on\\" than \\"side on\\".

At a distance of 163,000 light- years, it is the third closest galaxy to the Milky Way. Intergalactic travel is the hypothetical crewed or uncrewed travel between galaxies. Due to the enormous distances between the Milky Way and even its closest neighbors--tens of thousands to millions of light-years--any such venture would be far more technologically demanding than even interstellar travel. Intergalactic distances are roughly a hundred-thousandfold (five orders of magnitude) greater than their interstellar counterparts. The technology required to travel between galaxies is far beyond humanity's present capabilities, and currently only the subject of speculation, hypothesis, and science fiction. However, theoretically speaking, there is nothing to conclusively indicate that intergalactic travel is impossible. There are several hypothesized methods of carrying out such a journey, and to date several academics have studied intergalactic travel in a serious manner. Difficulties Due to the distances involved, any serious attempt to travel between galaxies would require methods of propulsion far beyond what is currently thought possible in order to bring a large craft close to the speed of light. According to our current understanding of physics, an object within space-time cannot exceed the speed of light, which means an attempt to travel to any other galaxy would be a journey of millions of earth years via conventional flight. Manned travel at a speed not close to the speed of light, would require either that we overcome our own mortality with technologies like radical life extension or traveling with a generation ship. If traveling at a speed closer to the speed of light, time dilation would allow intergalactic travel in a timespan of decades of on-ship time. Additional constraints include the variety of unknowns regarding the durability of a spaceship for such complex travel. Fluctuating temperatures as in the warm-hot intergalactic medium could potentially disintegrate future spacecraft if not properly shielded. These challenges also mean a return trip would be very difficult, and the time for a return trip might possibly exceed the species lifetime of humans on Earth (see discussion of civilization lifespan within the Drake Equation). Therefore, all future studies on the risks and feasibility of intergalactic travel would have to include a wide range of simulations to increase chances of a successful payload. Possible methods =Extreme long-duration voyages= Voyages to other galaxies at sub-light speeds would require voyage times anywhere from hundreds of thousands to many millions of years. To date only one design such as this has ever been made. =Hypervelocity stars= Theorized in 1988, and observed in 2005, there are stars moving faster than the escape velocity of the Milky Way, and are traveling out into intergalactic space. There are several theories for their existence. One of the mechanisms would be that the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way ejects stars from the galaxy at a rate of about one every hundred thousand years. Another theorized mechanism might be a supernova explosion in a binary system. These stars travel at speeds up to about 3,000 km/second. However, recently (November 2014) stars going up to a significant fraction of the speed of light have been postulated, based on numerical methods. Called Semi-Relativistic Hypervelocity Stars by the authors, these would be ejected by mergers of supermassive black holes in colliding galaxies. The authors think these stars will be detectable by forthcoming telescopes. These could be used by entering into an orbit around them and waiting. =Artificially propelling a star= Another proposal is to artificially propel a star in the direction of another galaxy. =Time dilation= While it takes light approximately 2.54 million years to traverse the gulf of space between Earth and, for instance, the Andromeda Galaxy, it would take a much shorter amount of time from the point of view of a traveler at close to the speed of light due to the effects of time dilation; the time experienced by the traveler depending both on velocity (anything less than the speed of light) and distance traveled (length contraction). Intergalactic travel for humans is therefore possible, in theory, from the point of view of the traveler. Accelerating to speeds closer to the speed of light with a relativistic rocket would allow the on-ship travel time to be drastically lower, but would require very large amounts of energy. A way to do this is space travel using constant acceleration. Traveling to the Andromeda Galaxy, 2.54 million light years away, would take 28 years on-ship time with a constant acceleration of 1g and a deceleration of 1g after reaching half way, to be able to stop. Going to the Andromeda Galaxy at this acceleration would require 4 100 000 kg fuel per kg payload using the unrealistic assumption of a 100% efficient engine that converts matter to energy. Decelerating at the halfway point in order to stop dramatically increases the fuel requirements to 42 trillion kg fuel per kg payload. This is ten times the mass of Mount Everest required in fuel for each kg of payload. As the fuel contributes to the total mass of the ship, carrying more fuel also increases the energy required to travel at a certain acceleration and extra fuel added to make up for the increased mass would further contribute to the problem. The fuel requirements of going to the Andromeda Galaxy with constant acceleration means that either the payload has to be very small, the spaceship has to be very large or it has to collect fuel or receive energy on the way through other means (e.g. using a Bussard ramjet). =Possible faster-than-light methods= The Alcubierre drive is a hypothetical concept that is able to impulse a spacecraft to speeds faster than light (the spaceship itself would not move faster than light, but the space around it would). This could in theory allow practical intergalactic travel. There is no known way to create the space- distorting wave this concept needs to work, but the metrics of the equations comply with relativity and the limit of light speed.

Among these antibodies are some which attack antigens on the red blood cells in the fetal circulation, breaking down and destroying the cells (hemolysis). The fetus can develop reticulocytosis and anemia. This fetal disease ranges from mild to very severe, and fetal death from heart failure (hydrops fetalis) can occur. When the disease is moderate or severe, many erythroblasts (immature red blood cells) are present in the fetal blood, and so these forms of the disease can be called erythroblastosis fetalis (or erythroblastosis foetalis). HDFN represents a breach of immune privilege for the fetus or some other form of impairment of the immune tolerance of pregnancy. Various types of HDFN are classified by which alloantigen provokes the response. In order of incidence, the types include ABO, anti-RhD, anti- RhE, anti-Rhc, anti-Rhe, anti-RhC, multiantigen combinations, and anti-Kell. Signs and symptoms Signs of hemolytic disease of the newborn include a positive direct Coombs test (also called direct agglutination test), elevated cord bilirubin levels, and hemolytic anemia. It is possible for a newborn with this disease to have neutropenia and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia as well. Hemolysis leads to elevated bilirubin levels. After delivery bilirubin is no longer cleared (via the placenta) from the neonate's blood and the symptoms of jaundice (yellowish skin and yellow discoloration of the whites of the eyes, or icterus) increase within 24 hours after birth. Like other forms of severe neonatal jaundice, there is the possibility of the neonate developing acute or chronic kernicterus, however the risk of kernicterus in HDN is higher because of the rapid and massive destruction of blood cells. It is important to note that isoimmunization is a risk factor for neurotoxicity and lowers the level at which kernicterus can occur. Untreated profound anemia can cause high-output heart failure, with pallor, enlarged liver and/or spleen, generalized swelling, and respiratory distress. HDN can be the cause of hydrops fetalis, an often-severe form of prenatal heart failure that causes fetal edema. =Complications= Complications of HDN could include kernicterus, hepatosplenomegaly, inspissated (thickened or dried) bile syndrome and/or greenish staining of the teeth, hemolytic anemia and damage to the liver due to excess bilirubin. Conditions that may cause similar symptoms in the newborn period include: acquired hemolytic anemia, congenital toxoplasma, congenital syphilis infection, congenital obstruction of the bile duct, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. *High at birth or rapidly rising bilirubin *Prolonged hyperbilirubinemia *Bilirubin Induced Neurological Dysfunction *Cerebral Palsy *Kernicterus *Neutropenia *Thrombocytopenia *Hemolytic anemia – Must NOT be treated with iron *Late onset anemia – Must NOT be treated with iron. Can persist up to 12 weeks after birth. Pathophysiology Antibodies are produced when the body is exposed to an antigen foreign to the make-up of the body. If a mother is exposed to a foreign antigen and produces IgG (as opposed to IgM which does not cross the placenta), the IgG will target the antigen, if present in the fetus, and may affect it in utero and persist after delivery. The three most common models in which a woman becomes sensitized toward (i.e., produces IgG antibodies against) a particular antigen are hemorrhage, blood transfusion, and ABO incompatibility. Fetal-maternal hemorrhage, which is the movement of fetal blood cells across the placenta, can occur during abortion, ectopic pregnancy, childbirth, ruptures in the placenta during pregnancy (often caused by trauma), or medical procedures carried out during pregnancy that breach the uterine wall. In subsequent pregnancies, if there is a similar incompatibility in the fetus, these antibodies are then able to cross the placenta into the fetal bloodstream to attach to the red blood cells and cause their destruction (hemolysis). This is a major cause of HDN, because 75% of pregnancies result in some contact between fetal and maternal blood, and 15–50% of pregnancies have hemorrhages with the potential for immune sensitization. The amount of fetal blood needed to cause maternal sensitization depends on the individual's immune system and ranges from 0.1 mL to 30 mL. The woman may have received a therapeutic blood transfusion. ABO blood group system and the D antigen of the Rhesus (Rh) blood group system typing are routine prior to transfusion. Suggestions have been made that women of child-bearing age or young girls should not be given a transfusion with Rhc-positive blood or Kell1-positive blood to avoid possible sensitization, but this would strain the resources of blood transfusion services, and it is currently considered uneconomical to screen for these blood groups. HDFN can also be caused by antibodies to a variety of other blood group system antigens, but Kell and Rh are the most frequently encountered. The third sensitization model can occur in women of blood type O. The immune response to A and B antigens, that are widespread in the environment, usually leads to the production of IgM or IgG anti-A and anti-B antibodies early in life. Women of blood type O are more prone than women of types A and B to making IgG anti-A and anti-B antibodies, and these IgG antibodies are able to cross the placenta. For unknown reasons, the incidence of maternal antibodies against type A and B antigens of the IgG type that could potentially cause hemolytic disease of the newborn is greater than the observed incidence of \\"ABO disease.\\" About 15% of pregnancies involve a type O mother and a type A or type B child; only 3% of these pregnancies result in hemolytic disease due to A/B/O incompatibility. In contrast to antibodies to A and B antigens, Rhesus antibodies are generally not produced from exposure to environmental antigens. In cases where there is ABO incompatibility and Rh incompatibility, the risk of alloimmunization is decreased because fetal red blood cells are removed from maternal circulation due to anti-ABO antibodies before they can trigger an anti-Rh response. =Antibody specific= *Anti-D is the only preventable form of HDN. Since the 1968 introduction of Rho-D immunoglobulin, (Rhogam), which prevents the production of maternal Rho-D antibodies, the incidence of anti-D HDN has decreased dramatically. *Anti-C and anti-c can both show a negative DAT but still have a severely affected infant. An indirect Coombs must also be run. *Anti-M also recommends antigen testing to rule out the presence of HDN as the direct coombs can come back negative in a severely affected infant. *Anti-Kell can cause severe anemia regardless of titer. Anti-Kell suppresses the bone marrow, by inhibiting the erythroid progenitor cells. *Kidd antigens are also present on the endothelial cells of the kidneys *One study done by Moran et al., found that titers are not reliable for anti-E. Their most severe case of hemolytic disease of the newborn occurred with titers 1:2. Moran states that it would be unwise routinely to dismiss anti-E as being of little clinical consequence. Diagnosis The diagnosis of HDN is based on history and laboratory findings: Blood tests done on the newborn baby * Biochemistry tests for jaundice including total and direct bilirubin levels. * Complete blood count (CBC) which may show a decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit due to red blood cell destruction * Reticulocyte count which will usually be increased as the bone marrow makes new red blood cells to replace the ones that are being destroyed, and a peripheral blood smear to look at cell morphology. In the presence of significant hemolysis the smear will show schistocytes (fragmented red blood cells), reticulocytosis, and in severe cases Erythroblasts (also known as nucleated red blood cells). * Positive direct Coombs test (might be negative after fetal interuterine blood transfusion) Blood tests done on the mother * Positive indirect Coombs test Blood tests done on the father (rarely needed) * Erythrocyte antigen status = Types (classified by serology) = Types of HDN are classified by the type of antigens involved. The main types are ABO HDN, Rhesus HDN, Kell HDN, and other antibodies. ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn can range from mild to severe, but generally it is a mild disease. It can be caused by anti-A and anti-B antibodies. Rhesus D hemolytic disease of the newborn (often called Rh disease) is the most common form of severe HDN. Rhesus c hemolytic disease of the newborn can range from a mild to severe disease – is the third most common form of severe HDN. Rhesus e and rhesus C hemolytic disease of the newborn are rare. Combinations of antibodies, for example, anti-Rhc and anti-RhE occurring together can be especially severe. Anti-Kell hemolytic disease of the newborn is most commonly caused by anti-K 1 antibodies, the second most common form of severe HDN. Over half of the cases of anti-K 1 related HDN are caused by multiple blood transfusions. Antibodies to the other Kell antigens are rare. Prevention In cases of Rho(D) incompatibility, Rho(D) immunoglobulin is given to prevent sensitization. However, there is no comparable immunotherapy available for other blood group incompatibilities. Early pregnancy *IVIG – IVIG stands for Intravenous Immunoglobulin. It is used in cases of previous loss, high maternal titers, known aggressive antibodies, and in cases where religion prevents blood transfusion. IVIG can be more effective than IUT alone. Fetal mortality was reduced by 36% in the IVIG and IUT group than in the IUT alone group. IVIG and plasmapheresis together can reduce or eliminate the need for an IUT. *Plasmapheresis – Plasmapheresis aims to decrease the maternal titer by direct plasma replacement and physical removal of antibody. Plasmapheresis and IVIG together can even be used on women with previously hydropic fetuses and fetal losses. Mid- to late- pregnancy *IUT – Intrauterine Transfusion (IUT) is done either by intraperitoneal transfusion (IPT) or intravenous transfusion (IVT). IVT is preferred over IPT. IUTs are only done until 35 weeks. After that, the risk of an IUT is greater than the risk from post birth transfusion. *Steroids – Steroids are sometimes given to the mother before IUTs and early delivery to mature the fetal lungs. *Phenobarbital – Phenobarbital is sometimes given to the mother to help mature the fetal liver and reduce hyperbilirubinemia. *Early Delivery – Delivery can occur anytime after the age of viability. Emergency delivery due to failed IUT is possible, along with induction of labor at 35–38 weeks. Rhesus-negative mothers who are pregnant with a rhesus-positive infant are offered Rho(D) immune globulin (RhIG, or RhoGam) at 28 weeks during pregnancy, at 34 weeks, and within 48 hours after delivery to prevent sensitization to the D antigen. It works by binding any fetal red blood cells with the D antigen before the mother is able to produce an immune response and form anti-D IgG. A drawback to pre-partum administration of RhIG is that it causes a positive antibody screen when the mother is tested, which can be difficult to distinguish from natural immunological responses that result in antibody production. Without Rho(D) immunoglobulin, the risk of isoimmunization is approximately 17%; with proper administration the risk is reduced to less than 0.1–0.2%. After birth testing *Coombs – in certain instances (when there is concern for blood group incompatibility between mom and baby for example), after birth a baby will have a direct Coombs test run to confirm the antibodies attached to the infant's red blood cells. This test is run on the infant's cord blood. In some cases, the direct Coombs will be negative but severe, even fatal HDN can occur. An indirect Coombs needs to be run in cases of anti-C, anti-c, and anti-M. Infants with Anti-M are also recommended to receive antigen testing to rule out the presence of HDN. The below tests are often useful in cases of hemolytic disease of the newborn, but are not required for treatment of all newborns. *Hgb – the infant's hemoglobin should be tested from cord blood. *Reticulocyte count – Reticulocytes are elevated when the infant is producing more red blood cells in response to anemia. A rise in the retic count can mean that an infant may not need additional transfusions. Low retic is observed in infants treated with IUT and in those with HDN from anti-Kell. *Neutrophils – as neutropenia is one of the complications of HDN, the neutrophil count should be checked. *Thrombocytes - as thrombocytopenia is one of the complications of HDN, the thrombocyte count should be checked. *Bilirubin should be tested from cord blood. *Ferritin – because most infants affected by HDN have iron overload, a ferritin must be run before giving the infant any additional iron. *Newborn Screening Tests – Transfusion with donor blood during pregnancy or shortly after birth can affect the results of the Newborn Screening Tests. It is recommended to wait and retest 10–12 months after last transfusion. In some cases, DNA testing from saliva can be used to rule out certain conditions. Treatment After birth, treatment depends on the severity of the condition, but could include temperature stabilization and monitoring, phototherapy, transfusion with compatible packed red blood, exchange transfusion, sodium bicarbonate for correction of acidosis and/or assisted ventilation. *Phototherapy – Exposure to ultraviolet light (phototherapy) is recommended when the cord bilirubin is 3 or higher. Some doctors use it at lower levels while awaiting lab results. This converts unconjugated bilirubin to an conjugated form that is easier for the infant to clear. *IVIG - IVIG has been used to successfully treat many cases of HDN. It has been used not only on anti-D, but on anti-E as well. IVIG can be used to reduce the need for exchange transfusion and to shorten the length of phototherapy. The AAP recommends \\"In isoimmune hemolytic disease, administration of intravenousγ- globulin (0.5-1 g/kg over 2 hours) is recommended if the TSB is rising despite intensive phototherapy or the TSB level is within 2 to 3 mg/dL (34–51 μmol/L) of the exchange level. If necessary, this dose can be repeated in 12 hours (evidence quality B: benefits exceed harms). Intravenous γ-globulin has been shown to reduce the need for exchange transfusions in Rh and ABO hemolytic disease.\\" *Exchange transfusion – Exchange transfusion is used when bilirubin reaches either the high or medium risk lines on the nonogram provided by the American Academy of Pediatrics (Figure 4). Cord bilirubin >4 is also indicative of the need for exchange transfusion. Transfusion reactions Once a woman has antibodies, she is at high risk for a future transfusion reaction if she is in need of a blood transfusion. For this reason, she must carry a medical alert card at all times and inform all doctors and emergency personnel of her antibody status. The absence of antibodies however does not preclude a woman from having a transfusion reaction: \\"Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions may be either immune-mediated or nonimmune-mediated. Immune-mediated hemolytic transfusion reactions caused by immunoglobulin M (IgM) anti-A, anti-B, or anti-A,B typically result in severe, potentially fatal complement-mediated intravascular hemolysis. Immune-mediated hemolytic reactions caused by IgG, Rh, Kell, Duffy, or other non-ABO antibodies typically result in extravascular sequestration, shortened survival of transfused red cells, and relatively mild clinical reactions. Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions due to immune hemolysis may occur in patients who have no antibodies detectable by routine laboratory procedures.\\" For a summary of transfusion reactions in the US, see reference.

Life He was born at Austin Friars, London, 11 May 1730. The appearance of the Great Comet of 1744 gave him, then a schoolboy at Geneva, a permanent bias towards astronomy; he diligently prepared, however, for a mercantile career in counting-houses at Geneva, Leghorn, and Genoa, and visited Rome in the jubilee year (1750). Returning to London in 1751, he was in the following year taken into partnership by his father. In 1753 he became a director, and some years later governor, of the London Assurance Company. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1772, and of the Society of Antiquaries in 1784. In 1793 he received a diploma of admission to the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. He observed the transit of Venus of 3 June 1769 at Austin Friars,(Phil. Trans. lix. 378) and that of Mercury, 4 May 1786(Phil. Trans. Lxxvii. 47) at an observatory built by him at Loampit Hill, near Deptford, and furnished with the best instruments by Short, Bird, Ramsden, and Dollond. Except that of Count Brühl, it was at that period the only well-equipped private establishment of the kind in England. In 1788 he purchased Highbury House, Islington, for 6,000 guineas, and erected on the grounds, with the assistance of his friend John Smeaton, the celebrated engineer, a new observatory on improved plans of his own. His mechanical knowledge caused him to be appointed chairman of the trustees for the completion of Ramsgate Harbour, and his energy contributed materially to the ultimate success of Smeaton's designs. In 1792 Aubert headed a society for the suppression of sedition, and in 1797 he organised, and was appointed lieutenant-colonel of, the 'Loyal Islington Volunteers.' While staying in the house of Mr. John Lloyd, of Wygfair, St. Asaph, he was struck with apoplexy, and died 19 October 1805, at the age of 75, highly esteemed both in scientific and commercial circles, and widely popular, owing to his genial manners and unstinted hospitality. His valuable astronomical library and instruments were sold and dispersed after his death. Amongst the latter were a Dollond 46-inch achromatic, aperture 3¾ inches, and the one Cassegrain reflector constructed by Short, of 24 inches focus and 6 aperture, known among opticians as 'Short's Dumpy.' Both had been originally made for Topham Beauclerk. Works Two slight papers by Aubert appeared in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society: *A New Method of finding Time by Equal Altitudes (lxvi 92-8) *An Account of the Meteors of 18 Aug. and 4 Oct, 1783 (lxxiv, 112-15).

Cache coloring is typically employed by low-level dynamic memory allocation code in the operating system, when mapping virtual memory to physical memory. A virtual memory subsystem that lacks cache coloring is less deterministic with regards to cache performance, as differences in page allocation from one program run to the next can lead to large differences in program performance. Details of operations Illustration of cache coloring. Left is virtual memory spaces, center is the physical memory space, and right is the CPU cache. A physically indexed CPU cache is designed such that addresses in adjacent physical memory blocks take different positions (\\"cache lines\\") in the cache, but this is not the case when it comes to virtual memory; when virtually adjacent but not physically adjacent memory blocks are allocated, they could potentially both take the same position in the cache. Coloring is a technique implemented in memory management software, which solves this problem by selecting pages that do not contend with neighbor pages. Physical memory pages are \\"colored\\" so that pages with different \\"colors\\" have different positions in CPU cache memory. When allocating sequential pages in virtual memory for processes, the kernel collects pages with different \\"colors\\" and maps them to the virtual memory. In this way, sequential pages in virtual memory do not contend for the same cache line. Implementations This code adds a significant amount of complexity to the virtual memory allocation subsystem, but the result is well worth the effort. Page coloring makes virtual memory as deterministic as physical memory with regard to cache performance. Page coloring is employed in operating systems such as Solaris, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and Windows NT. References  External links  *\\"Page Placement Algorithms for Large Real-Indexed Caches,\\" by R. E.

The company was sold in 1997 to Imperial Tobacco. The name \\"Rizla\\" came in 1886 (\\"Riz\\" being the French word for rice and \\"La+\\" as an abbreviation of Lacroix). Rizla rolling papers are available in a range of thicknesses, indicated by the colour of the packaging, and sizes. History =Creation= Pierre Lacroix was inspired to begin the production of rolling papers when, in the year 1532, he traded some paper for a bottle of fine champagne and realized their potential market.History on Rizla website (7 Sep 2020) =The company breaks out= 1881 Rizla- no glue strip In 1660, having perfected the first paper specifically designed for rolling, the Lacroix family began production. Despite the early success, it was not until 76 years later in 1736 that the family acquired their own paper-mill, purchased by François Lacroix, founder of the Lacroix Rolling Paper company. In 1796 Napoleon granted the Lacroix company a licence to produce rolling papers for his troops. In 1865, a change was made to the formula—the tissue previously used in the papers was replaced with paper made from rice. It is this change to rice paper that caused the name \\"RizLa+\\" to emerge: a combination of the French word riz (meaning rice) with \\"La\\" and a cross, representing the Lacroix family name, which literally means \\"The Cross\\". = 20th century and beyond= Rizla 1917 advertisement Rizla produced some of the first flavoured papers in 1906, with the release of menthol and strawberry. The first Rizla Blue fine-weight rolling papers were produced in 1910, with thinner paper and a more pronounced tobacco flavour. RizLa also released one of the first rolling machines. In 1942, the Rizla brand revolutionized the world of rolling papers when the Lacroix brothers acquired a patent for applying gum to the edge of rolling papers. This new feature solidified Rizla's position as a leader in the rolling paper industry, placing them at the top of the market. In 1977, thirty-three years after the brand name change, Rizla released the first of their King Size rolling papers. The standard sized papers measure 69x35mm. In most countries they are packed in a single interleaved stack of 50 papers, but in Belgium the packages contain two parallel stacks totalling 100 papers, which typically retail for €0.80-€1.00. Different thicknesses are colour-coded as follows: * 26.5 gm−2 liquorice * 23 white * 20 orange * 17.5 red (with cut corners green) * 14.5 blue, pink * 13.5 silver In 1978 Fernand Painblanc took control of Rizla, bringing the tradition of Lacroix family ownership to an end. The liquorice- flavoured paper was released in 1981. In 1986, Rizla began rapid growth and large-scale advertising. One successful advertising campaign in 1986 was a popular series of calendars, T-Shirts and posters. A café franchise, which was featured at various concerts in the UK in 1996, was also extremely popular. In 1997 they produced a limited edition King Size Rizla+ Purple medium-weight, extra width, king size rolling paper, in celebration of the Phoenix music festival. Pack of Rizla Silver pictured in 2019 In 1997, Rizla was sold to Imperial Tobacco. One year later, Rizla continued their string of expansion and large-scale advertising, going so far as to release their own line of clothing, sold at their cafés. In 2002 Rizla closed a deal with Suzuki and became one of their top motor-bike racing sponsors, forming the Rizla-Suzuki racing team. The Caterham Superlight R500 sports is available with Rizla markings following its launch in collaboration with Rizla-Suzuki. Rizla added a new paper to its lineup in 2003, with the introduction of the Rizla+ Silver, Ultra-Thin, King Size rolling paper. In 2003 the UK Advertising Standards Agency upheld a complaint that Rizla+ had alluded to their products' association with cannabis in a print advertisement that bore the caption \\"twist and burn\\". In 2004, two more types of Rizla papers were released; one, the Rizla Red, Medium Weight, Slim paper is exclusive to the United Kingdom and The Republic of Ireland. The other variety released in 2003 was the Rizla+ Silver (regular size) Ultra-Thin rolling paper. In 2002, Imperial Tobacco closed Rizla's historic factory at Mazères-sur-Salat near Saint-Gaudens (south of France). In September 2005 Imperial Tobacco announced the closure of Rizla's Treforest factory at Pontypridd near Cardiff in South Wales with a loss of 134 jobs. After the closure of the factory, Rizla production is now concentrated at Wilrijk, Belgium. From 2006 until 2011, Rizla sponsored the Suzuki MotoGP bike under Rizla Suzuki MotoGP team, which was ridden by Álvaro Bautista.

It is the only visible polar star in either hemisphere, and has long been used for navigation due to its constant fixed and unmoving appearance due north in the night sky. The commercial park north of Swindon Station is called North Star after the engine and includes streets named North Star Avenue and Polaris Way. * Morning Star (1839–1869) :This, the second Star Class, was not delivered until 14 months after the North Star. It had smaller wheels, as had been intended when it was constructed for the New Orleans Railway; the wheelbase was . :Named after 'the morning star', the common periodic name for the planet Venus (at times the brightest object in the night sky) when seen in the eastern sky just before sunrise, its motion then appearing to \\"lead\\" the sun for many mornings. Later locomotives * Bright Star (1841–1864) :A 'bright star' is one clearly visible in the night sky, and generally denotes one of a few that appear to shine more than most. * Dog Star (1839–1869) :After withdrawal, Dog Star was used as a stationary boiler at Paddington. Named after 'the dog star', the common name for Sirius, brightest star in the night sky and found in the constellation Canis Major (Lat: 'greater dog', from whence Sirius' common name). * Evening Star (1839–1871) :Named after 'the evening star', the common periodic name for the planet Venus (at times the brightest object in the night sky) when seen in the western sky just before sunset, its motion then appearing to \\"follow\\" the sun for many evenings. * Lode Star (1841–1870) :A 'lodestar' denotes any easily found star that is used to aid navigation (for example Polaris). Now an archaic term, in Middle English it meant 'course star' or 'lead star'. * Polar Star (1840–1870) :This locomotive was built with cylinders. It was rebuilt as a 4-2-2T tank locomotive. Its name is assisted with navigation: a polar star is one that appears fixed and unmoving over the Earth's North or South Pole and is thus used for a guide. The only one visible is Polaris (aka. the Pole Star or North Star). * Red Star (1840–1865) :This locomotive was rebuilt as a 4-2-2T tank locomotive. Its name has no particular association with any specific star, although prominent red stars visible from the northern hemisphere include Aldebaran, Arcturus, Antares and Betelgeuse. * Rising Star (1840–1871) :This locomotive had a wheelbase; at some time it was rebuilt as a 4-2-2T tank locomotive. On 7 September 1841 it ran over an earthslip near Chippenham, but the rest of the train (including Tiger, coupled behind) was derailed. The locomotive's name reflected the company's status: a 'rising star' is the term for any star appearing to climb the sky (rather than moving low across the horizon), and is often used metaphorically to mean someone \\"new\\" whose reputation is increasing rapidly. * Royal Star (1841–1871) :This locomotive was built with cylinders and a wheelbase. The four Persian 'royal stars' are Aldebaran, Regulus, Antares and Fomalhaut, said to guard the four quarters of the annual night sky. * Shooting Star (1841–1871) :This locomotive was rebuilt as a 4-2-2T tank locomotive. A 'shooting star' is the descriptive term for a meteor. * Western Star (1841–1866) :This locomotive was built with cylinders and a wheelbase. After withdrawal it was used as a stationary boiler at Oxford. Its name reflected the GWR's westerly direction: 'the western star' has no particular association with any specific star (although Antares was the quarter guardian of the western gate in Persian 'royal star' mythology). Replica North Star replica (built in 1923 using some parts of the original) on display at Swindon, England, 2008 A non-working replica of North Star was constructed for the 1923 Cavalcade, and is now housed at Swindon Steam Railway Museum. It made use of some of the parts of the original North Star, scrapped as recently as 1906, but is not capable of being steamed. Although it was featured in the railway's centenary film in 1935, it was pushed by another locomotive.

Etymology The village takes its unusual name from the more famous Canadian city of Quebec. The fields in the area were enclosed in 1759, the year Quebec was captured from France. It was common at the time for fields distant from their home farm to be given the names of foreign lands, and cases where these names have come to be applied to whole villages are numerous throughout the North East of England. For example, not far away is the village of Toronto. Sport In 1902, after the village's Hamsteels Rugby Club was beaten 77-0 in a match at Quebec against Hartlepool Rovers, the West Hartlepool Mail's rugby correspondent described Quebec as an \\"outlandish place\\". Today, the village has only football teams. Two of these, Hamsteels Inn FC and the Hammers FC, play at Quebec's Hamsteels Colliery Welfare Ground, while a third, Steelers FC, is based in Langley Park. At the age of 20, Chris Waddle was working in Quebec's former meat factory, Hamsteels Frozen Foods, when he was signed by Newcastle United in 1980 from nearby Northern League side Tow Law Town for £1,000.

Ortega is an icon of Argentinian popular music, and is considered one of the main representatives of the musical style called New wave that marked the Hispanic-American music between the years '60 and '70. He reached international fame, particularly in Latin America and Spain, during the 1960s, when the rock en español style of rock and roll music was popularised among teenagers in the region. Biography = Youth = Ortega was born to a very poor family in Lules, and had to work from a young age, selling newspapers in San Miguel de Tucumán, and finding a job at a store. His real passion, however, was music, as he had been dreaming of becoming a singer since early childhood; as a teenager, Ortega was an admirer of Elvis Presley. Ortega moved to Buenos Aires in 1956, where he sold coffee in the city's parks, corners, and streets. He used his work as a coffee seller to get into show business by setting up a coffee-selling spot near Buenos Aires' Channel Seven Public Television station. This worked well for Ortega, as many entertainers would stop by to buy coffee from his stand, and he became acquainted with some of the best known Argentine rock musicians of the era. Ortega also worked near Radio Belgrano, where many of the singers he met while selling coffee near the television station would recognise him and form a bond with the young star in the making. Ortega became friends with members of a famous group called \\"Carlinhos y su Banda\\". He learned to play drums during band practice sessions, eventually joining the group. A period of wild success across South America followed for the band, with Ortega being one of their most popular members. Ortega left the group to follow a solo career, confident that the recognition the group had given him would guarantee him success as a solo artist. = Career in entertainment = Ortega performing in 1970 His first solo album, La Edad del Amor (\\"The Age of Love\\"), was recorded under the artistic name of Nery Nelson. This album, as well as the next one (Yo no Quiero, translated to \\"I Don't Want To\\"), were not hits. Both albums were recorded in Mendoza with low budgets and no recording company to back them up. Ortega also used the artistic nickname of Tony Varano for some of his live shows at the time, and he became a member of \\"The Lyons\\" when the Argentine rock legend, lead singer Peter Rock, left the band. His interests, however, remained in being a successful solo singer, and he left The Lyons within months of joining that band. Ortega met songwriter Dino Ramos in 1962; this would prove important in Ortega's career as Ramos would write a large number of Ortega's hits. By 1963, in the midst of Argentina's own \\"new wave\\" (La nueva ola) movement (similar to those in the United States and many other countries), Ortega began to become a television regular, as he was featured multiple times on a popular Canal 11 show of the time, Club del Clan (\\"The Clan Club\\") along with Cachita Galán; the word clan in Spanish has nothing to do with racist groups; \\"clan\\" has the same meaning as \\"group\\" in Spanish. In 1963, he signed with RCA Records, and began recording immediately. His television appearances led to a career in cinema. Ortega recorded 27 albums, and starred in 26 films at the time, becoming a teen idol as a consequence. He acted and sang in those films, and shared the big screen with many of Argentina's most important actors and actresses of the time. His fame acquainted him with Evangelina Salazar, a television actress known for her role as a country schoolteacher; the couple were married in 1967, and had six children.Revista Noticias. September 12, 1991. Palito Ortega would travel extensively through the rest of the 1960s and the 1970s. He went on to record for RCA in Mexico, Italy, England, and Nashville, Tennessee. In 1966 while in Nashville Palito Ortega recorded the hit song \\"Sombras\\" by music composer and visual artist Gil Veda. Ortega's status as a teen idol declined during that period, and he reduced his television and movie appearances, as well as his album recordings. He did, however, become a successful music promoter, and in August 1981, produced a show for Frank Sinatra in Argentina. The sharp devaluation of the peso following the collapse of Economy Minister José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz's exchange rate timetable made his US dollar- denominated contractual obligations unaffordable, however. Ortega reportedly lost one million dollars after paying the legendary crooner for his Luna Park Stadium show, and was forced to sell a significant portion of his estate. Ortega relocated with his wife and six children to Miami in 1985, which by then was becoming a mecca for Latino entertainers. Ortega joined the likes of Iris Chacón, Charytín, Celia Cruz, Gloria Estefan, Julio Iglesias and others as a resident of the south Florida city. Ortega sang the United States national anthem before the 1986 world middleweight championship boxing fight between Marvin Hagler and John Mugabi. = Politics and retirement = Ortega performing at a musical revival in 2009 Ortega retired from show business for a while after that, focusing on his career as a businessman and eyeing a career as a con politician instead. Two of his children (son Emanuel and daughter Julieta) followed in their father's footsteps as entertainers, and, with Emanuel moving to Mexico, Ortega decided to return to Argentina. He was elected Governor of Tucumán Province in 1991, narrowly defeating former military Governor Antonio Domingo Bussi. One of his brothers, Juan, supported Bussi, though another brother, Luis, was elected Mayor of General Sarmiento (a suburb of Buenos Aires). Ortega governed as a close ally of President Carlos Menem. Aligned with Menem's free market policies, he privatized the Bank of Tucumán and the Provincial Water Authority, moves which cost him approval. The Vice-Governor, Julio Díaz, broke with Ortega, and in 1993 accused the governor of ordering politically motivated investigations of students and labor union officials;Microsemanario. Number 114. July 19, 1993. Ortega declined to run for re-election in 1995, and was instead elected to the Argentine Senate. The Justicialist Party nominated him for the Vice-Presidency in 1999, but his party lost the general elections that year. Ortega left politics, and in 2002, began to tour as a singer again.

Explanation TVM guidance requires a radar ground station and a missile with a radar receiver. As with semi-active homing missiles, the ground-based radar illuminates the target with radar energy which is then reflected off the target and detected by the missile. However, unlike a SARH missile, the missile itself does not compute interception with this information. Instead, data from the radar returns is relayed back to the ground station via a data link which also serves for passing the guidance commands to the missile. Advantages * Unlike an active radar homing missile, the missile does not alert the target to the fact that it is homing in on it by illuminating it with radio waves. Typically, the target will be aware that it is being illuminated by the SAM radar, but it will not know for certain if it has been engaged. Modern phased-array radars, by virtue of their thin beams and low sidelobes make detection by the aircraft even more difficult.http://www.ausairpower.net/APA-Grumble-Gargoyle.html * Unlike semi- active radar homing missiles, the electronics needed to calculate and follow an interception path do not need to be built into each missile, reducing their complexity, weight and cost. It is also possible to make the missiles more accurate by using more sophisticated algorithms for calculating interception than would be possible in the limited processor in a missile. In addition, it is possible for operators to adjust the missile's flight path throughout the engagement, even during the terminal homing phase. * Unlike radio command guided missiles, because the missile's radar receiver is much closer to the target than the ground station, more accurate tracking information can be generated for the system's computer. It is also more difficult to jam or spoof the tracking signal. It is also possible for the ground station to receive direct radar reflections from the target (rather than the data downloaded by the missile) and combine the two sources of information to generate the interception course. This adds an extra element of ECM resistance to the system. Disadvantages TVM also has some disadvantages. For example, the data link could potentially be jammed, which is not possible with an active homing or “fire and forget” missile. Additionally, this technique requires the ground-based radar to be active throughout the engagement potentially aiding aircraft equipped with anti-radiation missiles as they attempt to detect and engage the SAM radar. Another potential disadvantage compared to active radar homing is that the missile must rely on the ground-based radar for guidance, so if the target is able to put an obstacle between itself and the fixed radar system (e.g. a hill), or if it manages to get outside of the radar's tracking envelope (e.g., fly outside of the tracking “fan” of a PATRIOT radar, or fly outside the effective range of another system) then the missile will not be able to detect reflected radiation from the target and thus will be unable to continue the engagement. Examples Most very modern long-range SAM systems use the track-via-missile technique. This includes: * The Chinese HQ-9 medium- to long-range, semi-active radar homing missile. * The Russian S-300PS/S-300F/S-300-PMU (NATO designation SA-10 \\"Grumble\\") anti- aircraft/anti-Cruise missile with Anti-ballistic missile capability. * The U.S. MIM-104 Patriot anti-aircraft and anti-cruise missile system (with some limited anti-ballistic missile capability) References Missile guidance ","title":"Track-via-missile"},{"id":"1381451","text":"Ghabdellatif (; Abdul Latyf, Abd al Latif; Tatar: Ğäbdellatíf ) or Abdullatif (ca. 1475 – after 1502) was the khan of Kazan Khanate in 1496-1502. Ghabdellatif was the youngest son of Ibrahim and Nur Soltan. When his father died in 1479, his mother married Meñli I Giray and moved to Crimean Khanate. Around 1490 Meñli I Giray sent Abdul to Muscovy for service, where he received town of Zvenigorod. His brother Moxammat Amin ruled Kashira. That was considered great honor because these towns were usually given to own sons of Grand Duke of Muscovy. After a 1495 coup against pro-Muscovy Moxammat Amin, Mamuq quickly discredited himself. Ghabdellatif was chosen as a weaker alternative to his brother Moxammat Amin. Moscow approved the candidate. In 1499 another attempt was made to restore Siberian dynasty to Kazan throne. Uraq attempted to establish Agalaq as Kazan khan. The attempt was repelled. Ghabdellatif grew up in Crimean Khanate, which had closer ties with Ottoman Empire than with Muscovy. As he became older, he started to conduct more independent politics. That was unacceptable to the faction which selected him for the throne. In 1501 a group of Kazan nobles headed by Qol (Kel) Axmat visited Moscow. In January 1502, an embassy from Muscovy came to Kazan. Ghabdellatif was ousted, taken from Kazan under guard to Moscow and then exiled to Beloozero (now Belozersk, Russia). Moxammat Amin was installed as khan once again. The conflict resulted in a number of inquiries from Crimean Khanate, but it did not cause hostilities. It could be explained by the facts that the throne passed to another step son of Meñli I Giray, and that Crimean Khanate was busy with a war against Big Horde. It's possible that Ghabdellatif lived in exile at least until 1511, when he was visited by his mother.

Governance Coningsby is the most populous parish in the electoral ward of Coningsby and Tattershall. The population of this ward taken at the 2011 Census was 6,943. Geography Bridge over the River Bain The village takes its name from the Old Norse konungr meaning \\"King\\" and the Old Norse noun by meaning \\"settlement\\", which gives \\"settlement of the King\\". Coningsby is about south of Horncastle on the A153 Horncastle to Sleaford road, with the Lincolnshire Wolds to the west and the Fens to the east. The B1192 Kirton to Woodhall Spa road passes through the village. At the village's western end it is separated from the village of Tattershall by the River Bain. A railway line passing through the village opened on 1 July 1913 but closed on 5 July 1970. The Coldham Road Industrial Estate now occupies the site of the former Coningsby railway station. The line was known officially as the Kirkstead and Little Steeping Railway, though it was universally known by the local people and the railway workers as the \\"New Line\\". Education Coningsby St Michael's C of E Primary School is on School Lane. The secondary school is Barnes Wallis Academy, the Gartree Community School, is just outside the Coningsby boundary in Tattershall, near the A153. Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School provides sixth form education to pupils graduating from Gartree and other secondary modern schools. RAF Coningsby Nursery and Kids Club provides childcare for military personnel and the community. The nearest further education college is in Boston. In late March 2008, renovation of the Tattershall/Coningsby Library included a small learning centre provided by Boston College. Parish church Church of St Michael and All Angels Coningsby is overlooked by the tower of its 15th century parish church, St Michael's, with its one-handed clock face - one of the few in the country (although there is another at St Andrew's in Holt, Norfolk). The face is painted directly onto the wall of the tower and was probably installed in the 17th century. It is 16½ feet (5 metres) in diameter and its hand is nearly 9 feet (2.7 metres) long. The driving weights are large stones and its pendulum swings once every two seconds. The pendulum is not attached to the clock but some distance away, linked by a connecting rod. There are three wheels in the timekeeping mechanism, which needs winding once a day. The tower on which the clock face is painted is on the outside of the building. There is an arched passage under the tower which is part of a public footpath from the A153 High Street to the school in School Lane, through the churchyard. There is also a canonical sundial, dating from the 12th century, on the south wall of the church. In 1730, Britain's youngest Poet Laureate, Laurence Eusden, was buried in the church, where he had been Rector.DNB at Wikisource Two decades later another poet, John Dyer, was appointed as Rector and while living in the village completed his poem “The Fleece”. He died there of consumption in 1757 and was buried without memorial in the church chancel.The Poetical Works of Mark Akenside and John Dyer, ed. Rev.

Directed by Frank Launder and written by him and Sidney Gilliat, it was the third in a series of four films.  Plot  The St. Trinian's Girls burn down the school building and are, subsequently, put on trial at the Old Bailey in London, found guilty, and await sentencing the next day by Judge Slender (Raymond Huntley). This leads to rejoicing at the Ministry of Education, and in Barset, the school's village home, where Sergeant Ruby Gates (Joyce Grenfell) and Superintendent Samuel Kemp-Bird (Lloyd Lamble) can finally plan their marriage, which is predicated on the end of St. Trinian's. However, beautiful Sixth-Form pupil Rosalie Dawn (Julie Alexander) has been flirting with Slender during the trial, where she gives him her telephone numbers, and continues flirting at the sentencing session. Consequently, when Professor of Philosophy Canford (Cecil Parker) of the University of Baghdad suggests that, rather than punishment, the girls need sympathy, and explains that he has funds to buy a new school building, and with the help of noted educator Matilda Harker-Packer (Irene Handl), the girls can be rehabilitated, Judge Slender ignores the guilty verdict and gives him a year to accomplish his aims. This causes dismay at the Ministry, where Butters (Thorley Walters), on the advice of his psychiatrist, does a pastoral dance to calm his nerves. The revival of St. Trinian's also means the end of Gates' and Kemp-Bird's marriage plans. The girls, led by Prof. Canford, new Headmistress Harker-Packer, and the new teaching staff, move into the former Hannington Manor, now the new St. Trinian's school building. To demonstrate the positive effects the sympathetic educational approach is having on the girls Harker- Packer, acknowledging it will be a disaster, suggests the school present a cultural festival in a month, featuring a fashion show, a painting demonstration, and a dramatic presentation. Ministry officials Culpepper Brown (Eric Barker) and Butters are invited and their superior, Under Secretary Gore Blackwood (Dennis Price), encourages them to go and make detailed notes about the show, which they all believe will be a fiasco, in the hope that, with their report, they can convince the Minister of Education (John Le Mesurier) to shut the school. The show is indeed a fiasco: the fashions displayed by the girls are scandalous; the action-painting demonstration turns into a paint- flinging fight; and the dramatic presentation by Rosalie is Hamlet's soliloquy accompanied by a striptease. Certain the Minister will close the school when they present their report, Culpepper Brown, Butters and Blackwood are crushed when the Minister explains that the fashions are due to be shown in London, a reputable gallery will exhibit the art, and the Stratford theatre will present the girls' Hamlet. All three now use the pastoral dance to calm their nerves. Back at St. Trinian's, the sixth form girls and Flash Harry Cuthbert Edwards (George Cole) see Alphonse O'Reilly (Sidney James), sporting a \\"cowboy-style\\" hat (and immediately dubbed \\"Wyatt Earp\\" by the girls), arrive in a big car, stay for a short time and leave. Harry thinks that something is amiss, but doesn't know what. Now Canford suggests that he take the sixth form girls on a cultural tour of the Greek Islands, which will be financed by his backer, and the Ministry approves the voyage. Kemp-Bird feels there is something fishy going on and gets Sgt. Gates to stowaway on the yacht. Harry also goes along and, one day while he and the girls are on deck, they find that \\"Wyatt Earp\\" is also aboard the yacht. This gives Harry a very uneasy feeling: something is amiss. That night, someone - obviously a woman - manages to look at the ship's log and finds that they are off the East African coast. Meanwhile, uneasy at not having seen land for days, Canford confronts O'Reilly regarding their destination and money due to him: O'Reilly tells Canford that he will get no more money and, when they did the deal, he was told their destination. Upset by this answer, he goes to see Harry, but someone knocks at Harry's cabin door, and Canford tells Harry to meet him on deck in a half hour. The interruption was caused by the telegraph operator Octavius (Monte Landis), who has been lured away from his post by a message to him as \\"Lover Boy\\", asking him to meet \\"Lavinia\\" in the cabin actually occupied by Harry. While Octavius is gone, someone sends a telegraph message. Harry meets Canford on deck but, before they can talk, they notice the smell of gravy and discover Gates, cooking her dinner, in the covered lifeboat next to them. When they hear someone coming, they climb into the lifeboat with Gates. While she explains that they are not near Greece, but off the East African coast, O'Reilly and the ship's captain discover them, and O'Reilly has the lifeboat lowered into the sea. The three begin rowing, eventually spot a desert island and land there as castaways. Back in Barset, Kemp-Bird receives Gates' telegram and contacts the Ministry, who contact the army. The army sends word of the problem to the only unit in the East Arabian area, a mobile bath unit led by Major Hargreaves (Nicholas Phipps) and Captain Thompson (Cyril Chamberlain), and tells them that a plane carrying supplies, liquor and Ministry of Education officials is on the way. Blackwood sends Culpepper Brown and Butters on the mission, as they are the only Ministry officials who can identify the girls. Back at St. Trinian's, the fourth form girls manage to find out some of this news, then break into the Ministry to find out the rest. After the plane takes off, Culpepper Brown and Butters find that it is loaded with fourth form girls, who eventually throw them, with parachutes and an inflatable raft, into the East Arabian Sea. They wind up on the same desert island as the other castaways. When the Ministry men mention they could see land when they were pushed from the plane, the whole group packs up and heads for Arabia and the nearest town, Makrab. At the army camp, the girls have been rounded up and confined, surrounded by barbed wire. The captain then receives news that the Ministry officials are in Makrab and is ordered to go there, with a back-up group of soldiers, to find them. When they leave, the girls use the liquor from the plane to get the remaining soldiers so drunk that they pass out, and take over the base. In Makrab, the Captain and Major find the Ministry group at a cafe. Culpepper Brown and Butters go of to find the British consul (Harold Berens), who pairs them with two girls, who get the men so drunk they pass out. When Harry notices \\"Lover Boy\\" on the street, he, Canford, Gates, the Captain and the Major follow him to a striptease club, where Harry recognises Rosalie on a poster advertising \\"Farida\\". That night they go to the club and find Rosalie who tells them that \\"Lover Boy\\" smuggled her off the boat, but the other girls are in danger, imprisoned at the palace of a local Emir (Elwyn Brook-Jones), whose sons want to marry them which, with Canford's collusion, had been O'Reilly's plan all along. The officers go to muster their forces, while Harry and Canford go to visit the Emir. Gates gets there on her own and enters the palace by helping to carry in the laundry. To the Emir's displeasure, the girls are defending themselves quite well. Harry, Canford and Gates offer to reason with the girls, and are allowed to visit them for five minutes: when they can't provide results, the Emir's men attack again, again with little success. Just as this fight is ending, the army arrives but is promptly captured. Things look bleak, when they hear the St. Trinian's school song in the distance, followed by the arrival of the fourth form girls in army vehicles, who smash their way into the compound, forcing the Emir and his forces to run away. Back in Britain, the girls and Sgt. Gates are hailed as heroes. In Barset, Gates, after 16 years of being engaged, is about to get married, when the ceremony is interrupted with news that the girls are again burning down the school, and Kemp-Bird runs off, even as Gates is walking down the aisle. As the film ends, the staff at the Ministry and the officers at the East Arabian army camp are all doing a pastoral dance to calm themselves.

It and its sequels were inspired by British cartoonist Ronald Searle. Directed by Frank Launder and written by Launder and Sidney Gilliat, it was the first of a series of four films. Alastair Sim stars in a dual role as the headmistress Miss Millicent Fritton and her twin brother Clarence Fritton.  Plot  The Sultan of Makyad (Eric Pohlmann) wants to send his daughter Fatima to a school in England, and asks her governess Miss Anderson to recommend one: she recommends St Trinian's in the county of Barchester. This suits the sultan perfectly: as his racehorses are trained there, he will be able to visit Fatima and his horses at the same time. At St Trinian's, Miss Holland the accountant, explains to headmistress Millicent Fritton (Alastair Sim) that they need cash, not cheques. Then Fritton's twin brother, bookmaker Clarence (Alastair Sim), arrives with his previously expelled sixth form daughter Arabella (Vivienne Martin). He gets his sister to re-enroll her so she can befriend Fatima and get information on Arab Boy, the Sultan's horse that will run in the upcoming Cheltenham Gold Cup against Blue Prince, the horse he and his associates have backed. Assistant headmistress/physics mistress Buckland (Mary Merrall) enters the office to introduce Fatima and two other new girls to Fritton, and Fatima meets Arabella. Fritton explains St Trinian's to the new girls: \\"At most schools, girls are sent out quite unprepared for a merciless world but, when our girls leave here, it is the merciless world which has to be prepared.\\" Fritton takes the new girls to meet the staff: Miss Brimmer (Renée Houston), arts and handicrafts mistress; Miss Wilson (Beryl Reid), maths mistress; Mlle. de St Emilion (Balbina Gutierrez), French mistress; Miss Drownder (Hermione Baddeley), geography mistress; Miss Gale (Irene Handl), English literature mistress; Miss Waters (Betty Ann Davies), the scripture and needlework mistress; and Miss Dawn (Joan Sims). Barchester Police Superintendent Kemp Bird (Lloyd Lamble), in the hope of getting help to stop the crime wave that has occurred in his area since the new term started at St Trinian's, goes to London and meets the Ministry of Education official Manton Bassett (Richard Wattis). Bassett refuses to help: the two inspectors he has sent there have both disappeared. Kemp Bird arranges to send his girlfriend, Sgt. Ruby Gates (Joyce Grenfell), to St Trinian's, undercover, as games mistress Chloe Crawley. When Crawley arrives, Fritton takes her around the school: she finds the fourth form girls using the science lab to make gin, which Flash Harry (George Cole) sells for them; and the sixth form girls learning about French wine regions from the geography mistress. Florrie (Jill Braidwood), the school snoop, hears Arabella tell her father about a trial run the next day and after teasing the fourth form girls about what she has heard, is forced to tell them about the trial. The next morning Arab Boy goes through the trial run timed by the trainer, by Arabella with some other sixth form girls, and by a hidden group of fourth form girls. Now both the sixth and fourth form girls need to find out the weight of that day's jockey, stable boy Albert Faning (Michael Ripper): the sixth form girls have Amanda (Belinda Lee) seduce him to get his weight, while the fourth form girls calculate it. The result is that Arab Boy is sure to win the race. The fourth form girls ask Harry to place a bet for them on Arab Boy but, he tells them, they won't make much with the little more than £3 they have, even at the 10-1 odds. So, the girls ask Fatima if they can borrow her pocket money for the bet. Fritton is told by the bookkeeper that they have £400 in the bank and are £4000 in debt. When Fatima, accompanied by four girls, asks for the £100 that Fritton is holding for her, the girls explain that they want to place a bet on Arab Boy, who is a sure winner at 10-1 odds; Fritton doesn't give Fatima the money, but does get an idea. She summons Harry, who tells her that he places bets for the girls, and asks him to bet the school's remaining £400 on Arab Boy in order to win the £4000 needed to cover the school's debt. Arabella tells her father the disastrous news of Arab Boy's strength and suggests they \\"nobble\\" the horse, but Clarence rejects that idea. Arabella suggests he give it some thought and, should he change his mind, come to St Trinian's the next day, ostensibly for the field hockey match. Crawley and some of the sixth form girls are setting up the net for the match, when the girls run off. Crawley chases them and finds them, with two men and Miss Drownder, having a \\"French lunch\\", as she later reports to Fritton. Fritton explains that she need not worry: the men are former ministry inspectors Eric Rowbottom-Smith (Guy Middleton), now the school's gardener, and Wilfred Woodley (Arthur Howard), the new fencing master. Before the match starts Arabella, with some of the field hockey team members, meets with Clarence and his partner Benny (Sidney James). They opt for Arabella's plan to \\"borrow\\" the horse until the race is over, which is overheard by Florrie, who is tortured by the fourth form girls for this information. When Crawley goes back to the match, Harry goes to Fritton with a letter he has stolen, which proves that Crawley is really Sgt. Gates. The next morning, with the stable boy's collusion, the horse theft is carried out – almost; in fact, the fourth form girls have taken him. Clarence and Benny are told by their henchman that when they went to get the horse, it was not at the stable. Fritton sees Maudie (Marigold Russell) riding Arab Boy up the stairs, and goes to the fourth form dorm to investigate. She finds the girls, Harry, and Arab Boy and insists they get the horse out of the school before dawn, when Fatima will pretend to find and return him. She gets the girls to promise to carry out this plan. The next morning Florrie sees Arab Boy's head sticking out of the fourth form dorm window and tells Arabella. The sixth form girls barricade the dorm and Arabella calls Clarence with the news and suggests he come quickly with a group of henchmen to make sure they can maintain the barricade. The fourth form girls try to break through the barricade, but fail. Then the entire teaching staff tries to break through but also fail. Clarence, Benny, and some henchmen arrive, and block the staircase to the dorm. It is parents' day at St Trinian's. Parents arrive, as does Manton Bassett, who has been sent to inspect the school. At the school entrance, Harry diverts all the parents to the Brownies' camp fire area and sends Bassett to the summerhouse to meet his missing inspectors. Florrie climbs up some vines to reach the fourth form dorm, with news of the sixth form barricade, which is being re-enforced by Fritton's men. Then the milkman arrives in a horse-drawn cart, and the fourth form girls see a way to free Arab Boy. They throw smoke bombs out of the window to cover Florrie's climb back down the vines to tell the staff to create a diversion. The staff is suddenly joined by a busload of wild former students, and overcome the blockaders, but Clarence escapes. Meanwhile, the girls lower the horse from the second floor dorm using a sling made of bed- sheets they have tied together, hitch him to the milk cart, and take him to the racetrack. Fritton, back in her office, is being berated by some parents over the way St Trinian's is run (the goateed man is Ronald Searle with first wife Kaye Webb on far right), when Harry bursts in with the news that Arab Boy has won the race. The sultan comes to the school to present the good conduct trophy to one of the girls, but it and, subsequently, all the other trophies on display are stolen during two blackouts. Finally, the dais collapses, save the part on which a resigned and exasperated Fritton is sitting.  Cast  Ronald Searle appeared in a cameo role as a visiting parent. Roger Delgado plays the Sultan's aide. It was also the first film appearance of Barbara Windsor, then a teenager. Production The film was based on the cartoons of Ronald Searle. He started doing sketches at the beginning of the war and continued to do them as a POW in Singapore. After the war they became very successful. By the time the film was made Searle had become tired of them. Filming took place in April–May 1954. The opening scenes of the girls returning to school were filmed at the All Nations Christian College (now the All Nations Christian College) near Ware, Hertfordshire. This includes the entrance gate of Holycross Road and the outside shots of the school. The bulk of the film was shot at Shepperton Studios in London. Filmink said \\"Lee played a Dors-style student sent to seduce a jockey to get inside information – the only one of the females in the movie to be truly sexualised.\\" Reception =Box Office= The film was the third most popular movie at the British box office in 1954, after Doctor in the House and Trouble in Store. =Critical= The New York Times wrote, \\"Credit Alastair Sim with doing excellently by the dual roles he essays...Joyce Grenfell makes a properly gangling, awkward and gullible lady sleuth; George Cole does a few delightful turns as the conniving Cockney go-between and last, but not least, the 'Belles of St. Trinian's' rate a vote of confidence for the whacky freedom of expression they exhibit. They all help make St. Trinian's a wonderfully improbable and often funny place to visit.\\" =Censorship= The film was banned for children under 16 in South Africa.

Directed by Frank Launder and written by him and Sidney Gilliat, it was the second of the series of four films. The film stars Terry- Thomas, George Cole, Joyce Grenfell, Lionel Jeffries and Richard Wattis. The plot is based around a secret marriage agency for the sixth-form girls, that has caught the attention of an Italian prince, based in Rome. The girls break into the Ministry of Education and replace the official (disastrous) school record with a glowing version that qualifies them for a UNESCO tour of Europe, ending in Rome. In line with St Trinian's tradition, chaos reigns as the girls run amok in Europe.  Synopsis  Flash Harry (George Cole) has set up a marriage bureau for the sixth form St Trinian's girls and is in Rome negotiating with Prince Bruno (Guido Lorraine), who is interested in marrying one of them. The Prince suggests that Harry bring the girls to Rome before July, at the Prince's expense, so he can make a decision. Coincidentally, UNESCO is offering the best academically qualified school in England an expenses paid tour to various European cities, ending in Rome: they will play at the Vienna Music Festival and play in a series of field hockey and water polo matches against school teams. Of course, St Trinian's is the last possible candidate for the tour. Harry returns with the news of the Prince's offer, but is at a loss how to get the girls to Rome before their term ends in July. The UNESCO tour provides the solution, when the girls, led by sixth form girls Bridget Strong (Dilys Laye), Cynthia (Jose Read), and Annabel (Rosalind Knight), break into the Ministry of Education in London and replace their file with one containing outstanding essays, assuring they will be chosen. At St Trinian's, with neither a headmistress nor teachers, chaos reigns. Things are so bad that an army unit, headed by Major Whitehart (Thorley Walters), has been called in to restore order; but the best they can do, while suffering debilitating casualties, desertions and/ or kidnappings, is to confine the mischief to the school. Meanwhile, Culpepper-Brown (Eric Barker) at the Ministry of Education has hired a new headmistress, Dame Maud Hackshaw (Judith Furse), who is on her way from Australia. Further complications develop when Joe Mangan (Lionel Jeffries), who has just carried out a large diamond robbery and is on his way by train to St Trinian's to visit his daughter Myrna (Lisa Gastoni), is recognized by Roberts, his former prison governor. After Mangan leaves the train, the former prison governor reads a newspaper account of the theft, which has all the hallmarks of Mangan's approach, and alerts the police of Mangan's whereabouts. Mangan, while walking to the school, stops to ask directions at a parked car, where he finds Superintendent Kemp-Bird (Lloyd Lamble) having a tryst with his fiancée Police Sergeant Ruby Gates (Joyce Grenfell). Mangan reaches St Trinian’s well before Kemp-Bird returns the car radio to the police frequency and realizes that the stranger they saw was Mangan. Mangan reaches the school grounds, meets his daughter and tells her he has done a \\"small\\" job. They reach Harry's rooms, when police cars are seen heading there, and the sixth form girls decide to hide Mangan in the school. The police arrive just as the army is withdrawing because Dame Maud will arrive shortly to take control of the school. When Dame Maud arrives, she is kidnapped by the girls and hidden, shackled, in the bell tower. Mangan, disguised in women's clothes, becomes the new headmistress, unable to escape because the police have surrounded the school and plan to stay there indefinitely, and is forced by the girls to lead the UNESCO tour. The girls intercept a letter sent by the Ministry to Dame Maud, asking her to withdraw St Trinian's from the UNESCO tour, and replace it with a forged letter insisting the girls go on the tour. The Ministry has no alternative but to comply. The Superintendent, criticized by his superior for having bungled the search for Mangan, is in danger of losing his job. He thinks that Mangan is at the school and plans to leave with the tour, and decides to send Gates, undercover, along on the tour as an interpreter. Culpepper Brown assigns Manton Bassett (Richard Wattis) to deal with the problem of transport. When no coach company will take the job Bassett, in desperation, calls Kemp-Bird for help. He reports back that no-one will do it except, possibly, the Dreadnought Motor Transport Co. near Wantage in Berkshire, whose phone is disconnected, and may be so needy that it will take the job. Dreadnought owner Captain Romney Carlton-Ricketts (Terry-Thomas), agrees to rent the Ministry two dilapidated coaches. As they arrive at St Trinian's, Cynthia spies Mangan stuffing the diamonds into the water polo ball, but doesn't tell anyone. Also on the tour are Eric the Liftman (Michael Ripper), the only Ministry representative who would go, and Gates posing as interpreter Ursula Blewitt. Harry leads the entourage in his bubble car, accompanied by the three sixth form leaders, to whom he reveals Gates’ identity. On the boat to France, the impoverished and opportunistic Ricketts begins to make a play for Gates, thinking she will come into an inheritance when her grandmother dies. By the time they reach Rome, Gates has told Ricketts about her engagement, her real identity, and her mission. In Rome, just before the water polo match, Mangan retrieves the gem-filled ball, but one of the girls takes it back. Cynthia, believing Prince Bruno will choose her, tells Harry about the loaded ball. At the match, Mangan takes the ball, insisting that the girls use the ball provided by the Italian team. During the match, the empty ball is thrown out of the pool, caught by Harry, and replaced by the gem-laden ball. Harry, believing he has the loaded ball, runs off with it to the police, finds the ball empty, and returns to the match. When the ball with the diamonds is thrown out of the pool, Mangan runs off with it, with Harry and the fourth form girls in pursuit. The girls' team leaves the pool and Prince Bruno makes it clear that his choice of bride is Myrna Mangan. Mangan hides in the Coliseum, but is found by the girls. At a press conference to announce his wedding to Myrna, Prince Bruno is hit in the eye by a piece of fruit thrown, as revenge, by Cynthia. Somewhere between Rome and return to the UK, the bus acquires a Russian-English-German sign indicating a side trip into the Berlin enclave, and stencils suggesting 6 more dead (or missing) soldiers and further as-yet undocumented manoeuvres for the girls. Back at St Trinian's, Amelia Fritton (Alastair Sim) has been restored as headmistress and, reward cheque in hand, is greeted warmly by the returning girls. She then agrees to pay Harry his percentage. Sergeant Gates finds that Kemp-Bird is now back on the beat, says goodbye to a chagrined Ricketts, and runs off to chase Kemp-Bird down the street.

A leading model at the time, Sabrina got high billing, appearing in all the posters and publicity stills in school uniform, but she actually had a non-speaking part in which she was only required to lounge in bed reading a book while men hovered around her. She is described as the \\"school swot\\", the only pupil to go to bed on time and where she reads the works of Dostoyevsky. Thorley Walters was to re-appear in The Pure Hell of St Trinian's, effectively replacing Richard Wattis as Culpepper- Brown's nerve-racked assistant. He was also to play the part of Culpepper- Brown himself in The Wildcats of St Trinian's in 1980. It was Rosalind Knight's first credited film role. She too later appeared in The Wildcats film, this time as a teacher. Box office Kinematograph Weekly listed it as being \\"in the money\\" at the British box office in 1958. Critical reception Bosley Crowther wrote in The New York Times, \\"what is important and delightful is that the spirit of knockabout farce, evolved in \\"The Belles of St. Trinian's,\\" is retained uninhibited in this film...it is wild but generally funny—explosively funny in spots, especially when that fellow Terry-Thomas, who was the mustachioed major in \\"Private's Progress,\\" is dragooned as a bus driver to transport the girls to Rome. And since he has toothy Joyce Grenfell to accompany him on the trip—she's \\"a crazy, mixed-up police-woman,\\" as she dubs herself—the fun is as much in their behavior as it is in that of the belles. None of the latter is notable as an actress; all are lissome and lively girls. They make for pleasant company on a mad excursion. It's only too bad that Mr. Sim had to languish in jail.\\" More recently, David McGillivray noted in Time Out, \\"Inventive situations utilising a classic British blend of comedy and crime make it the best (if you like this sort of thing) in the series which followed The Belles of St Trinian's.\\" References External links Blue Murder At St Trinians at St Trinians World 1957 films 1957 comedy films St Trinian's films British films British sequel films Films directed by Frank Launder Films set in schools Films with screenplays by Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat ","title":"Blue Murder at St Trinian's"},{"id":"1381483","text":"The Great St. Trinian's Train Robbery is a British comedy film, directed by Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat, written by Sidney and Leslie Gilliat, and released on 4 April 1966. It is the last of the original series of films based on the St Trinian's School set of images and comics, and the only one to be produced in colour. The film stars a selection of actors from previous films in the series, including George Cole, Richard Wattis, Eric Barker, Michael Ripper, and Raymond Huntley, alongside Frankie Howerd, Reg Varney, Dora Bryan, and the voice of Stratford Johns. The film's story focuses on St Trinian's becoming caught up in a train robbery, after the gang who conducted it attempts to reclaim their loot from the building that the students and teachers now inhabit. The story itself is based on the actual Great Train Robbery that took place in 1963, and includes numerous parodies of the technocratic ideas of the Harold Wilson government and its support of the comprehensive school system, and spoof elements based upon those from the James Bond spy films of the Sixties. Plot Gang leader \\"Alphonse\\" Askett, who operates under the guise of a hairdresser, is contacted by his anonymous employer, a secret mastermind, on a plan for a major train robbery. The gang are instructed to rob a mail van of £2.5 million, and hide the loot at Hamingwell Grange, a deserted country mansion, until it is safe to reclaim it. Meanwhile, Amber Spottiswood, the headmistress of St Trinian's, has an affair with Sir Horace, the new head of the Ministry of Schools (a fictional government department) and a corrupt politician, who recently took over following a Labour Party election triumph. Much to his department staff's shock, he willingly provides the school a grant in order to relocate following a fire at their previous building. St Trinian's moves into Hamingwell as a result, which subsequently spook Askett's gang when they attempt to return to recover their loot. Learning of what happened, the gang's mastermind instructs Askett to find a means to retrieve the stolen money without raising suspicions from the school. Askett decides on sending his delinquent daughters into St Trinian's as new pupils, instructing the pair to gather any useful information that the gang can make use of. Unknown to Askett, one of the students at St Trinian's comes across some of the stolen money and brings it to Flash Harry, the school's turf accountant. Discovering it is part of the proceeds from the train robbery reported in the papers, he decides to claim the reward money from Edward Noakes, an insurance assessor. However, Noakes is put off by the secretive manner Harry conducts the meeting under, and decides to keep St Trinian's under observation instead. The gang soon receive instructions to take advantage of an upcoming Parents' Day at the school, and pose as caterers in order to recover the money. Whilst waiting for the school to be preoccupied with a dance routine in the main hall, the gang lose a camera to one of the students, housing a hidden two-way radio. When the camera is brought to Harry in order to be fenced, he and some of the students intercept a message for Askett from the mastermind and realise the train robbers are in the school. The gang manage to recover the stolen money and escape, just as the school is alerted to what is happening; while Harry and the students chase after the gang, Spottiswood leads the teachers in hopes of claiming the reward money. A chaotic chase with trains soon ensues. While the gang use a stolen train to make their escape, the students commandeer a passenger train to pursue them, and subsequently seize a van car from them carrying the stolen money. At the same time, police are alerted by Noakes, and commandeer another passenger train to pursue both. The students swiftly manage to evade the robbers and leave them being chased by the police, with the gang cornered at a station. While officers arrest most of the gang, Askett manages to escape in the chaos. Meanwhile, the students bring the stolen money to a station further up the railway line, planning to claim it for themselves, but are prevented from doing so by the arrival of more police. However, the officers applaud the girls for recovering it, causing the students to be awarded with medals, much to the shock of others that know them too well.

The locomotives used were: *Longmoor Military Railway WD Austerity 2-10-0 AD601 'Kitchener' as the express locomotive in mock-up green livery and carrying a fake BR-pattern numberplate on the smokebox door until its scrapping in 1967. *Two Ministry of Supply \\"Austerity\\" 0-6-0ST Tank Engines, one of which was mocked up to resemble a J50 and temporarily renumbered 68961, but in reality was WD157 Constantine (this locomotive was scrapped in 1968 by Pollock Brown at Southampton), the other one, WD196 Errol Lonsdale, painted black and given the number 68011. Errol Lonsdale was later saved for preservation, spending time at the Kent & East Sussex Railway, the Mid Hants Railway, and the South Devon Railway, but is now at Stoomcentrum Maldegem. *One LMS diesel shunter {BR Class 11} in Longmoor colours. *A DEMU in BR livery as the commuter train commandeered by the police (number 1102, Class 205). *A Wickham trolley used in the school staff's attempt to join the chase. *A pump action Handcar used by two junior girls to switch trains between tracks. The extras on board the St Trinian's train were pupils from a local convent school. In addition, the school used for much of the filming was Little Abbey Preparatory School, near Liss. The school was in fact the other side of the moor from Longmoor. This was previously a boys preparatory school based at Burghclere near Newbury, which had merged with a girls preparatory school at the location at Liss nine months prior to the making of the film Reception The film was among the 15 most popular movies at the British box office in 1966.\\"Most popular star for third time.\\" Times [London, England] 31 December 1966: 5.

It was first published in 1895. Poem > I never saw a Purple Cow, I never hope to see one; But I can tell you, > anyhow, I'd rather see than be one. Publication history The May 1895 issue of The Lark in which Burgess's \\"Purple Cow\\" first appeared The poem was first published in the first issue of Burgess's magazine The Lark in May 1895 and became his most widely known work. It originally had the longer title \\"The Purple Cow's projected feast/Reflections on a Mythic Beast/Who's Quite Remarkable, at Least\\". This publication of the poem also included an illustration by Burgess featuring a cow jumping over an art nouveau fence heading towards a naked human, with both the cow and the human filled in black. A poster version of his illustration is part of the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The poem became popular, eventually becoming what one commentator called \\"[t]he most quoted poem in twentieth-century America, after 'The Night Before Christmas'\\". In addition to being widely anthologized, it was often transmitted orally without credit to Burgess. Many years after its appearance, publicist Jim Moran appeared at Burgess' home with a cow he had painted purple. Burgess came to resent its popularity. A few years after writing the poem, Burgess wrote another short poem in response, titled \\"Confession: and a Portrait Too, Upon a Background that I Rue\\", which appeared in the final issue of The Lark in April 1897: > Ah, yes, I wrote the \\"Purple Cow\\"— I'm Sorry, now, I wrote it; But I can > tell you Anyhow I'll Kill you if you Quote it! Afterlife of the poem Several parodies of \\"The Purple Cow\\" have been written by others, including O. Henry. United States President Harry S. Truman was once asked by UFO researcher and publisher James W. Moseley if he'd ever seen a UFO. Truman reportedly responded by reciting lines from Burgess's poem. \\"Purple Cow\\" is also the name of the ice cream shop found inside Meijer stores. Founder Fred Meijer handed out cards for free ice cream at any Meijer Purple Cow ice cream shop to customers as part of a promotional campaign. Marketer Seth Godin has used the phrase \\"Purple Cow\\" for the concept of marketing a product as \\"intrinsically different\\". The phrase has also been used for the marketing concept of choosing a name which \\"makes your audience stop in their tracks and wonder why the title was chosen.\\" A purple cow is the mascot of Williams College, a private liberal arts college in Williamstown, Massachusetts, which was named after the college's humor magazine Purple Cow, which, in turn, took its name from Burgess's poem. A slightly modified version of the final line of the poem is referenced in the book Fletch and the Man Who (1983) by Gregory Mcdonald in the line in which Filby is making fun of not only Fletch but his albatross of a first name, which is a recurring theme in the series of books. Purple Cow is a pipe tobacco blend manufactured by Cornell & Diehl blended by the late Bob Runowski and crafted for the Chicago Pipe Show years ago.

Usually credited as Betty E. Box, she is considered one of the best of her generation, with a flair for making popular films, especially comedies. Early life and career Born in Beckenham, Kent, England, she initially planned to be a commercial artist or journalist. She entered the motion picture industry in 1942, joining her brother Sydney and his wife Muriel at Verity Films, where she helped produce more than 200 wartime propaganda shorts. Box: > Sitting around was no good for me, my brother said, and he asked me to work > for him. He was running an organisation that made training and recruitment > films. I went along as a general dogsbody, and as more men were called up, > there were more opportunities for me. We worked from 7 a.m. until 10 or 11 > at night. I learnt more in those two years than I would in ten years in > peacetime. Following World War II, she made an easy transition to feature films, beginning with The Years Between (1946). When her brother assumed control of Gainsborough Pictures that year, he named her Head of Production at the Poole Street, Hoxton studio, where she produced ten films during the next two years. While tight budgets and shooting schedules compromised the quality of some of them, others – such as When the Bough Breaks (1947) – proved to be among the most politically interesting films of the period. \\"Every story I have at the moment has a murder in it\\", she said in 1947. \\"It's no wonder I'm being called 'Bloodthirsty Box'.\\" She was also known for the trio of popular Huggetts films, starting with Here Come the Huggetts (1948) and followed by Vote for Huggett and The Huggetts Abroad (1949). The Rank Organisation When the Gainsborough studios were closed by Rank in 1949, Box moved to Pinewood Studios, where she collaborated with director Ralph Thomas on some 30-odd films. They began by making thrillers such as Venetian Bird (1952) but then concentrated on comedy. The biggest success of their career commercially was the seven-film Doctor series, beginning with Doctor in the House (1954) and ending with Doctor in Trouble (1970). The comedies contained a wacky irreverence which clearly struck a chord with contemporary audiences and helped to make stars of the young Dirk Bogarde and Donald Sinden.Morley, Sheridan (1999). Dirk Bogarde: Rank Outsider. Bloomsbury (London) (second edition). . Towards the end of her career, Box said the genre she preferred was comedy: > You can assess laughter. I get pleasure out of making a movie, but to listen > to people laughing at what we have made – this is great. I'm a natural > pessimist. Comedies are difficult. You can make a good adventure story if > you have the money, good actors, and a good story (more often than not a > best-selling book), and you'll know the film will please. Comedy is more of > an instinctive thing. Personal life Betty Box was married to Peter Rogers, producer of the Carry On film series, from 24 December 1948 until her death. It was her second marriage; her first, to a pilot during the war, ended in divorce. Box and Rogers did not have any children, but their godson was actor and theatre producer Marc Sinden, the son of Sir Donald Sinden, who starred for Betty Box in, amongst other films, Doctor in the House, Doctor at Large and Mad About Men. \\"We made the choice not to have children\\", said Box in 1973. \\"I don't think I would have made a very good mother. You know making a movie is like having a baby – it takes eight weeks to film and nine months to produce.\\" Box was awarded the OBE in 1958. She died in Chiltern, Buckinghamshire aged 83 from cancer in 1999. A posthumous autobiography Lifting the Lid: The Autobiography of Film Producer Betty Box was published in 2000.

The Plaza de Armas of Ayacucho is in the city center of Ayacucho, Peru. Central plazas in Peru are typically called the Plaza Mayor. The Plaza de Armas is so named because it was the place where the city's defenders assembled during emergencies. In Ayacucho it is known as Sucre Park. Overview The Plaza de Armas is surrounded by the Cuzco, Portal Constitución, Portal Independencia, and the Portal Municipalidad avenues. It is surrounded by buildings which mostly date from the 16th and 17th centuries. It is Peru's largest square and monuments of great historical and architectural value. It has a level of harmony that unites all its components and it is made in the style of the plazas of Spain, such as the ones in Mérida and Trujillo. The buildings surrounding the square are works of Baroque architecture, with stone arches and red clay roofs. It is the only plaza in Peru with portals of columns and stone arches on all four sides. The east side has 16 arcs or archos (). The south side has 32, the west side has 30, and the north has 33. On the perimeter of the square are houses made of white stone, which serve as headquarters for major institutions such as the Municipality, the Cathedral, the Prefecture, the Superior Court, and San Cristóbal of Huamanga University. The monument that stands in the center of the square was erected in honor of the Gran Mariscal de Ayacucho Antonio José de Sucre, which is surrounded by the coats of arms of the Bolivarian countries. In the 1990s, it was remodeled with the addition of two water sources on the east and west sides. Churches and convents The city of Ayacucho has 33 Catholic churches, which makes it a religious destination for Christians. Each of those temples (the oldest was built in 1540) has some associated relic, object d'art, or legend. The Santo Domingo Temple, built in 1548 and the San Francisco de Paula church, built in 1713, show the evolution of style and taste of its builders. The Santo Domingo Temple has Romanesque and Byzantine arcs. The San Francisco de Asís church has Greco-Roman facades with raised images. The Society of Jesus temple has baroque interiors.

The development of the IEEE 802.22 WRAN standard is aimed at using cognitive radio (CR) techniques to allow sharing of geographically unused spectrum allocated to the television broadcast service, on a non-interfering basis, to bring broadband access to hard-to-reach, low population density areas, typical of rural environments, and is therefore timely and has the potential for a wide applicability worldwide. It is the first worldwide effort to define a standardized air interface based on CR techniques for the opportunistic use of TV bands on a non-interfering basis. IEEE 802.22 WRANs are designed to operate in the TV broadcast bands while assuring that no harmful interference is caused to the incumbent operation: digital TV and analog TV broadcasting, and low power licensed devices such as wireless microphones. The standard was expected to be finalized in Q1 2010, but was finally published in July 2011. IEEE P802.22.1 is a related standard being developed to enhance harmful interference protection for low power licensed devices operating in TV Broadcast Bands.. IEEE P802.22.2 is a recommended practice for the installation and deployment of IEEE 802.22 Systems. IEEE 802.22 WG is a working group of IEEE 802 LAN/MAN standards committee which was chartered to write the 802.22 standard. The two 802.22 task groups (TG1 and TG2) are writing 802.22.1 and 802.22.2 respectively. Technology In response to a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) issued by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in May 2004, the IEEE 802.22 working group on Wireless Regional Area Networks was formed in October 2004. Its project, formally called as Standard for Wireless Regional Area Networks (WRAN) - Specific requirements - Part 22: Cognitive Wireless RAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications: Policies and procedures for operation in the TV Bands focused on constructing a consistent, national fixed point-to-multipoint WRAN that will use UHF/VHF TV bands between 54 and 862 MHz. Specific TV channels as well as the guard bands of these channels are planned to be used for communication in IEEE 802.22. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), together with the FCC, pursued a centralized approach for available spectrum discovery. Specifically each base station (BS) would be armed with a GPS receiver which would allow its position to be reported. This information would be sent back to centralized servers (in the USA these would be managed by the FCC), which would respond with the information about available free TV channels and guard bands in the area of the BS. Other proposals would allow local spectrum sensing only, where the BS would decide by itself which channels are available for communication. A combination of these two approaches is also envisioned. Devices which would operate in the TV white space band (TVWS) would be mainly of two types: Fixed and Personal/Portable. Fixed devices would have geolocation capability with an embedded GPS device. Fixed devices also communicate with the central database to identify other transmitters in the area operating in TVWS. Other measures suggested by the FCC and IEEE to avoid interference include dynamic spectrum sensing and dynamic power control. Overview of the WRAN topology The initial drafts of the 802.22 standard specify that the network should operate in a point to multipoint basis (P2MP). The system will be formed by base stations (BS) and customer-premises equipment (CPE). The CPEs will be attached to a BS via a wireless link. The BSs will control the medium access for all the CPEs attached to it. One key feature of the WRAN Base Stations is that they will be capable of performing a cognitive sensing. This is that the CPEs will be sensing the spectrum and will be sending periodic reports to the BS informing it about what they sense. The BS, with the information gathered, will evaluate whether a change is necessary in the channel used, or on the contrary, if it should stay transmitting and receiving in the same one. An approach to the PHY layer The PHY layer must be able to adapt to different conditions and also needs to be flexible for jumping from channel to channel without errors in transmission or losing clients (CPEs). This flexibility is also required for being able to dynamically adjust the bandwidth, modulation and coding schemes. OFDMA will be the modulation scheme for transmission in up and downlinks. With OFDMA it will be possible to achieve this fast adaptation needed for the BS's and CPEs. By using just one TV channel (a TV channel has a bandwidth of 6 MHz; in some countries they can be of 7 or 8 MHz) the approximate maximum bit rate is 19 Mbit/s at a 30 km distance. The speed and distance achieved is not enough to fulfill the requirements of the standard. The feature Channel Bonding deals with this problem. Channel Bonding consists in using more than one channel for Tx / Rx. This allows the system to have higher bandwidth which will be reflected in a better system performance. An approach to the MAC layer This layer will be based on cognitive radio technology. It also needs to be able to adapt dynamically to changes in the environment by sensing the spectrum. The MAC layer will consist of two structures: Frame and Superframe. A superframe will be formed by many frames. The superframe will have a superframe control header (SCH) and a preamble. These will be sent by the BS in every channel that it's possible to transmit and not cause interference. When a CPE is turned on, it will sense the spectrum, find out which channels are available and will receive all the needed information to attach to the BS. Two different types of spectrum measurement will be done by the CPE: in-band and out-of-band. The in-band measurement consists in sensing the actual channel that is being used by the BS and CPE. The out-of-band measurement will consist in sensing the rest of the channels. The MAC layer will perform two different types of sensing in either in-band or out-of-band measurements: fast sensing and fine sensing. Fast sensing will consist in sensing at speeds of under 1ms per channel. This sensing is performed by the CPE and the BS and the BS's will gather all the information and will decide if there is something new to be done. The fine sensing takes more time (approximately 25 ms per channel or more) and it is used based on the outcome of the previous fast sensing mechanism. These sensing mechanisms are primarily used to identify if there is an incumbent transmitting, and if there is a need to avoid interfering with it. To perform reliable sensing, in the basic operation mode on a single frequency band as described above (the \\"listen-before-talk\\" mode) one has to allocate quiet times, in which no data transmission is permitted. Such periodic interruption of data transmission could impair the QoS of cognitive radio systems. This issue is addressed by an alternative operation mode proposed in IEEE 802.22 called Dynamic frequency hopping (DFH) where data transmission of the WRAN systems are performed in parallel with spectrum sensing without any interruption. Encryption, authentication, and authorization Only the AES-GCM authenticated encryption cipher algorithm is supported.IEEE 802.22-2011 § 8.4.1, p. 281 EAP-TLS or EAP-TTLS must be used for authentication and encryption key derivation.IEEE 802.22-2011 § 8.1.2, p. 252IEEE 802.22-2011 § 8.5, p. 286 IEEE 802.22 defines an X.509v3 certificate profile which uses extensions for authenticating and authorization of devices based on information such as device manufacturer, MAC address, and FCC ID (the Manufacturer/ServiceProvider certificate, the CPE certificate, and the BS certificate, respectively).IEEE 802.22-2011 § 8.5, pp. 286-292 This could allow for a type of customer lock-in where the network providers refuse network access to devices that have not been vetted by manufacturers of the network providers' choice (i.e. the device must possess a private key of an X.509 certificate with a chain of trust to a manufacturer certificate authority (CA) that the network provider will accept), not unlike the SIM lock in modern cellular networks and DOCSIS \\"certification testers\\" in cable networks. Comparison with 802.11af In addition to 802.22, the IEEE has standardized another white space cognitive radio standard, 802.11af. While 802.22 is a wireless regional area network (WRAN) standard, for ranges up to 100 km, 802.11af is a wireless LAN standard designed for ranges up to 1 km. Coexistence between 802.22 and 802.11af standards can be implemented either in centralized or distributed manners and based on various coexistence techniques.

Described by British critic Everett True as sounding like \\"a very aggressive Suicide\\",True, Everett (8 January 2009). \\"True Tales: Melbourne's musical treasures\\", The Guardian. Retrieved 20 May 2017. the band is known for its mix of harsh guitar noise, fast and repetitive drum machine beats, and abrasive synthesizers. Along with fellow Melbourne act Whirlywirld, the Primitive Calculators played a leading role in founding the experimental Little Band Scene in the late 1970s, wherein both bands and numerous other acts formed large numbers of short-lived bands by frequently swapping members and inviting non-musicians to join in at live shows. History =First era= They met as teenagers in Springvale, a working- class outer suburb of Melbourne, and moved together in 1977 to St Kilda, then the centre of the punk rock scene. The band in its initial form was Denise Rosenberg, Dave Light, Frank Lovece and Stuart Grant. Despite socialising with the likes of Nick Cave from The Boys Next Door they remained outsiders to this scene (most of which consisted of people from middle-class backgrounds with private-school educations), and in 1978 moved to Fitzroy. In Fitzroy, they settled on a four-piece lineup for recording and found like-minded friends, such as Ollie Olsen and John Murphy of Whirlywirld. They drew influence from proto-punk acts like The Godz and The Velvet Underground, Texan 1960s psychedelic punk, James Brown, and The Silver Apples, as well as Australian bands like Billy Thorpe and the Aztecs. The band were instrumental in organising a series of gigs named \\"Little Band nights\\", where hastily formed bands would play for 15 minutes each; this led to the recording of a compilation EP. They became known for their use of a screeching Mosrite Ventures model guitar, primitive synthesizers (a Wasp and Roland SH2), an electronic organ played through effects pedals and an extra fast drum machine (Roland CR-78). The Primitive Calculators played their last gig in March 1980, though their self-titled live album came out in the early 1980s. The band reformed briefly in 1986 to perform a live version of their song \\"Pumping Ugly Muscle\\" in the Richard Lowenstein film Dogs In Space (they later appeared in Lowenstein's 2009 documentary \\"We're Livin' on Dog Food\\"). =Second era= In 2001, a 1979 live recording of \\"Pumping Ugly Muscle\\" was included in \\"Can't Stop It\\", a compilation of Australian post-punk bands from 1978 to 1982, released by Chapter Music. The title of the CD was taken from the Calculators' only studio recording, made in December 1979, which was a 7\\" single of the songs \\"I Can't Stop It\\" and \\"Do That Dance\\". This led to a renewed interest in the band that led to the 2003 release of the Glitter Kids EP, which featured three live recordings from 1979, by Meeuw Muzik in the Netherlands. The Primitive Calculators' album was reissued on CD by Chapter Music in 2004, with the inclusion of extra tracks from related projects (their first band The Moths from 1978 and other live recordings from 1979). In March 2007, Chapter Music released \\"Primitive Calculators and Friends, 1979 to 1982\\", a CD that contained the only studio recordings of the band (the 7\\" single from 1979), the \\"Little Band\\" single, also from 1979, and live tracks from Little Band nights. It also contained other recordings from bands the members formed after 1980, such as a song called \\"Zye Ye Ye\\" (recorded in London in 1981 with Olsen and Murphy), and bands formed after the return of some of the band members to Australia from Europe, in 1982. In January 2009, the band reformed for the inaugural Australian All Tomorrow's Parties music festival, curated by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds and held at Mount Buller in Victoria. The band subsequently commenced the recording of a new album, called The World Is Fucked, released in 2013. Stuart Grant explained the album title in a December 2013 interview: > The album is called The World is F---ed because that's what we believe. The > world's not any better now – in fact, it's worse.

It often occurs in association with Cedrus deodara and Pinus wallichiana. Description The trees are 10-20(-25) m tall with usually deep, wide and open crowns with long, erect branches. However, crowns are narrower and shallower in dense forests. The bark is very flaky, peeling to reveal light greyish-green patches, similar to the closely related lacebark pine (Pinus bungeana). The branchlets are smooth and olive-green. The leaves are needle-like, in fascicles of 3, 6–10 cm long, spreading stiffly, glossy green on the outer surface, with blue-green stomatal lines on the inner face; the sheaths falling in the first year. The cones are 10–18 cm long, 9–11 cm wide when open, with wrinkled, reflexed apophyses and an umbo curved inward at the base. The seeds (pine nuts) are 17–23 mm long and 5–7 mm broad, with a thin shell and a rudimentary wing. Ecology This species is listed as lower risk, near threatened. Overcutting, and intensive grazing causing poor regeneration, may result in the extinction of this pine species. The Himachal Pradesh State Forest Department has tried artificial regeneration of chilgoza pine at many places. However, performance of seedlings was found to be very poor. Cones and leaves The scientific name commemorates Captain Patrick Gerard, a British army officer in India. It was introduced to England in 1839, where it grows well in the warmer drier areas of the southeast, but is very rarely planted. Uses Chilgoza pine is well known for its edible pine nuts, rich in carbohydrates and proteins. The seeds are locally called and marketed as \\"chilgoza\\", \\"neja\\" (singular) or \\"neje\\" (plural). Chilgoza is one of the most important cash crops of tribal people residing in the Kinnaur tribal district and the tribal Pangi Valley of Chamba district of Himachal Pradesh, India.http://www.uniindia.com/challenge-to-save-chilgoza-wild-mushrooms-in- hp/states/news/1268329.html. The seed is very expensive and fetches good money to the local people in Kinnaur. Sold at approximately PKR 2500-4500, INR 2000-3600 ($20–$53) per kilogram.

Groats are whole grains that include the cereal germ and fiber-rich bran portion of the grain, as well as the endosperm (which is the usual product of milling). Groats can also be produced from pseudocereal seeds such as buckwheat. Culinary uses Groats are nutritious but hard to chew, so they are often soaked before cooking. Groats are used in soups and porridges: steel-cut oats are simply sliced oat groats. Groats of many cereals are the basis of kasha, a porridge-like staple meal of Eastern Europe and Eurasia. In North America kasha or kashi usually refers to roasted buckwheat groats in particular. In North India, wheat groats are known as dalia and are commonly prepared with milk into a sweet porridge or with vegetables and spices into salty preparations. Parboiled and cut durum wheat groats, known as bulgur, are an essential ingredient of many Middle Eastern dishes such as mansaf and tabbouleh. Groats are also used in some sausages, such as black puddings. A traditional dish from the Black Country in England is groaty pudding (not to be confused with groats pudding). Groaty pudding is made from soaked groats, leeks, onions, beef, and beef stock, and baked up to 16 hours; it is a traditional meal on Guy Fawkes Night. Coarse barley flour is made by milling barley groats. Production From the top: fine, medium, and coarsely cut oat groats (i.e. steel-cut oats) Bottom: uncut oat groats The grain is cleaned, sorted by grain, size and peeled (if necessary) before being hulled.

Until 1811 the parish of the same name also included Nailsea and Flax Bourton. It is now within the parish of Wraxall and Failand. History The origin of the name Wraxall, which is shared with other villages in Somerset, Wiltshire and Dorset, is thought to be \\"a nook of land frequented by buzzards\\". Earthworks of an oval defended settlement, surrounded by a bank and ditch, indicated the site of an Iron Age defended settlement south of Manor Farm. Wraxall Court was the original manor house. After the Norman conquest the Manor belonged to the De Wrokeshale family until it passed to the Moreville and then Gorges family by marriage. The parish of Wraxall was part of the Portbury Hundred. In Victorian times the Ford family lived at the Court. it was taken over by the Admiralty during the Second World War and later became a Hall of Residence for Bristol University. Earthworks from a deserted medieval settlement, east- south-east of Wraxall House, indicate houses, enclosures and possibly a watermill which were occupied in the Middle Ages. The only waterwheel still operating on the Land Yeo is at Watercress Farm. The diameter wheel, which was built before 1885 and is housed in a small brick building, is used as a water pump. The other mill in the parish of Wraxall operated in the 18th and 19th centuries. It fell out of use by 1885 and was a ruin by 1950. The mill was demolished in 1961 to allow for the road widening and straightening of Wraxall Score. Today the only remains are crumbling walls by the entrance to Wraxall House. An area known as \\"The Rocks\\" stretches north from the Battleaxes to Failand, its many quarries being the source of some of the local building stone (oolitic conglomerate). Failand once had a chapel of ease, but now has the Victorian church of St Bartholomew; the village is relatively modern. The Battleaxes free house, which was previously known as the Widdicombe Arms, was built in 1838 and is a grade II listed building. It was built originally as the meeting house for the workers at Tyntesfield Estate. Wraxall Cross Tree, a large elm, used to be found on in the small triangle of land where Wraxall Hill meets with the Bristol Road (B3130). The original tree had become hollow and local children were often seen climbing inside it. It eventually succumbed to Dutch Elm disease and was felled in May 1977. Children at Wraxall School were given the day off to see the spectacle of the tree being craned and transported to Watercress Farm where it was burned for a large barbecue. An oak tree has been planted in its place. A new housing estate, built at the edge of Nailsea in the mid 1990s, is now referred to as Lower Wraxall. Much more housing has been built since then with Wraxall becoming a largely dormitory town for Bristol. In April 2007 a new children's hospice opened at Charlton Farm, part of the Tyntesfield Estate associated with the medieval Charlton House. Children's Hospice South West provides in-patient palliative care for eight children and their families, plus outpatient and day-care facilities for a number of other children. The opening follows years of fund raising in the Bristol and Somerset area. Archaeology In 1950-53 an archaeological dig was undertaken at Tower House Farm towards the lower end of Tower House Lane. A Roman Villa was found. There are other Roman features scattered throughout the valley. Cadbury Camp is located just over away. Church Sir Edmond Gorges (d.1512) and his wife Ann Howard, north wall of east end of chancel, Wraxall Church The Church of England parish church of All Saints was built in the 12th century, with tower, clock and bells being added in later centuries. It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building. There are painted stone figures of Sir Edmond Gorges and his wife in the chancel. The large churchyard contains several monuments to the Tynte family which gave its name to the nearby Tyntesfield Estate. The church tower has a peal of eight bells in the key of E flat. The oldest bell was cast in Chew Stoke in the early 18th century and the heaviest bell (tenor) is just over 1.1 tonnes. The nearby rectory was built in the 17th century. To the south east of the churchyard, next door to the village blacksmith, Wraxall once had a public house called \\"Remember Lot's Wife.\\" It was demolished by Colonel George Gibbs, in about 1920, when he gave the lower churchyard to the village as an extension. Tyntesfield Estate Two large manor houses were situated on the estate before the estate was split after Baron Wraxall's death in 2001: Tyntesfield is a Victorian Gothic Revival house which used to be part of a much larger estate. The National Trust bought the house in 2002 after the property gained worldwide interest. A number of celebrities were reportedly interested including Kylie Minogue. The house and some of the grounds are slowly undergoing renovations and restoration, but local trades people have questioned the way in which the Trust is managing the restoration projects. During the 1940s \\"Tyntesfield Camp\\" was built as an American hospital with a vast network of centrally-heated hot-water radiators. After the war it was returned to the fields which remain there now. The lesser known Belmont House is situated about to the east. It contains a real tennis court. Schools A dame school was recorded as early as 1801 and several schools followed, the present one being built in 1856. This is the current school, Wraxall Church of England (VA) School, which educates children between the ages of five to twelve years. Across the road from this was the village blacksmith, and nearby were the stocks and whipping post, for centuries the site of the annual \\"Stumps Fair\\". This area is locally referred to as Wraxall Cross Tree. The old Boys' School was located just over towards Bristol. The school was built in 1856 on land donated by Sir G Smyth with building expenses donated by William Gibbs. The school closed in 1938, and became a private residence, which it has remained ever since. Another school in the village is the private Downs Preparatory School, which occupies Charlton House. Amenities and annual events =Swimming pool= On the southern side of the B3130 road, opposite the old American Hospital, a natural spring was captured to create a cold bathing pond, in around 1890. The construction comprises two pools of concrete, undressed and dressed natural stone. The small north pool is about two feet deep and feeds the southern pool which is about five feet deep. The southern pool has an iron handrail. The pool, which has not been used for many decades, has now fallen into disrepair. The south pool is mostly full of organic matter. It is referred to by the ordnance survey as 'Bathing Pond Wood.' =Noah's Ark Zoo= A tourist attraction in the village is the Noah's Ark Zoo Farm. This zoo has a large collection of animals and offers hands-on experience and children's play areas. The zoo promotes creationism. It has been the subject of animal cruelty allegations on more than one occasion, and now has to undergo six-monthly inspections by an independent veterinary surgeon. =North Somerset Show= On May Day Bank Holiday the annual North Somerset Show agricultural fair is held at the North Somerset Showground. The show was formed in 1840 from the North Somerset Ploughing Society and its purpose was to further agricultural development by communicating agricultural issues and providing a showpiece to the local, general public. The event was previously held at Ashton Court, until the mid-1990s, when the show committee moved it to its current location.

It protected the Confederate capital of Richmond from Union naval attacks throughout most of the war. Drewry's Bluff On 17 March 1862 Captain Augustus H. Drewry a local landowner (after whom the name Drewry's Bluff is taken) moved in with his artillery unit and began constructing earthworks, defenses and installing 3 large guns (1 ten-inch and 2 eight-inch columbiads), the installation of which was overseen by General Robert E. Lee's eldest son Brigadier General G.W.C. Lee. Fort Darling was to defend Richmond the capital of the Confederacy in anticipation of a Union attack by gunboats from along the river. Defenses Bolstered & Their First Test Obstructions placed in the James River around Fort Darling In May the garrison was joined by the crew of the CSS Virginia, who had scuttled their ship with the fall of Norfolk on May 9. With them, defenses were expanded further and obstacles sunk into the James River and 6 more guns placed in a battery upriver. Men worked around the clock for the anticipated battle. Then on May 15, 5 Union Navy vessels steamed towards Richmond. Led by Commander John Rodgers, the USS Monitor, USS Galena, Port Royal, Aroostook and Naugatuck engaged the defenses at Fort Darling at 7.45am. The concussion from the 10-inch gun was so strong that eight miles away the windows in Richmond rattled with the firing of the Confederate's cannons; however, it broke its carriage with the first shot and was inactive for the rest of the battle. The 5 Union ships lined up against Fort Darling, Richmond's only defense For 3 hours and 20 minutes the battle ensued. The fire from Fort Darling high on the bluff and the battery on the riverside made it too dangerous for the 3 wooden ships to advance, the ironclad Monitor and Galena advanced on the defenders. After 18 hits pierced Galena's armor and caused fires to start, the attack was called off and Rodgers turned around. It became known as the Battle of Drewry's Bluff. Preparations For two years Fort Darling saw no more action, in that time the naval Captain Sydney Smith Lee (General E. Lee's brother) took command. Defenses were strengthened along with better accommodations, barracks, chapel, etc. In that time Fort Darling served as a training site for training ground for the Confederate Naval Academy, as well as the Confederate Marine Corps Camp of Instruction. Then on May 5, 1864 the Union returned, this time landing 30,000 troops at Bermuda Hundred only 15 miles south of Richmond, under the command of Major General Benjamin F. Butler. Within a few days they had reached Fort Darling managing to take over some of the outer defenses, but indecisive generals failed to consolidate their hold. Soon 18,000 Confederate infantry under General P.G.T Beauregard arrived and routed the attackers on May 16. Fort Darling and Richmond had again seen the Union driven off. Evacuation Following the Battle of Namozine Church began the evacuation of Petersburg and Richmond on April 2, 1865. The troops, marines and sailors of Fort Darling joined the movement westwards and eventually surrendered after the Battle of Appomattox Court House on April 9. On April 4 the obstacles in the James River were cleared and Abraham Lincoln passed the fort on his way to Richmond.

It was directed and produced by John and Roy Boulting, from a script by John Boulting and Frank Harvey. Plot During the Second World War, young undergraduate Stanley Windrush (Ian Carmichael), is conscripted into the British Army. Unlike his friend Egan (Peter Jones), Windrush is a most reluctant soldier and struggles through basic training at Gravestone Barracks under Sgt. Sutton (William Hartnell) (Author Hackney spent the first year of his National Service at Maidstone Barracks). Alan Hackney, Daily Telegraph Failing his officer selection board, he is posted to a holding unit, under the command of Major Hitchcock (Terry-Thomas). Most of the soldiers there are malingerers and drop-outs, with one of them Private Cox (Richard Attenborough) becoming his mentor in escaping work details and riding the railways without a ticket. Windrush is finally posted to train as a Japanese interpreter, where he becomes the prize pupil. He is then contacted by his uncle, Brigadier Tracepurcel (Dennis Price), who rapidly rose from the rank of Major for facilitating profitable business deals for his superior officers and is now a senior officer in the War Office, to join a secret operation known only as Hatrack. He is quickly commissioned and the operation is launched, Windrush becoming an unwitting participant in a scheme ostensibly to recover looted artworks from the Germans but really to steal them and sell them to two crooked art dealers. All are astounded that Windrush was trained in Japanese, rather than German that initially made him desirable to the operation. Windrush survives the operation where he is captured by British forces whilst in German uniform. No one believes he is British until he comes across Major Hitchcock who is commanding the prisoner of war camp Windrush is at. After being hospitalised for alleged mental illness he is discharged from the army. Tracepurcel and his associate, Private Cox, fake their deaths. Windrush returns to university after the war and is surprised to receive a visit from Cox, who brings him an attaché case. Cox is arrested as he leaves by Sergeant Sutton, now a Royal Military Policeman; Windrush and Tracepurcel having been tracked as the source of a counterfeit copy of one of the artworks.

The equipment was later removed, though the class continued to work suburban trains on GWR lines in London. The class was introduced into service between June 1862 and October 1864, and withdrawn between June 1871 and December 1877. Twenty-two locomotives were built to the 2-4-0T tank locomotive arrangement from 1862 to 1864., Metropolitan, 2-4-0T The locomotives were built by three workshops, each with a different naming system.

It is named for its ability to \\"walk\\" and wiggle across dry land, to find food or suitable environments. While truly, it does not walk as most bipeds or quadrupeds do, it has the ability to use its pectoral fins to keep it upright as it makes a wiggling motion with snakelike movements to traverse land. This fish normally lives in slow-moving and often stagnant waters in ponds, swamps, streams, and rivers, as well as in flooded rice paddies, or temporary pools that may dry up. When this happens, its \\"walking\\" skill allows the fish to move to other aquatic environments. Considerable taxonomic confusion surrounds this species and it has frequently been confused with other close relatives.Ng, Heok Hee, and Kottelat, Maurice (2008). The identity of Clarias batrachus (Linnaeus, 1758), with the designation of a neotype (Teleostei: Clariidae). Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society 153: 725–732. One main distinction between the walking catfish and the native North American ictalurid catfish with which it sometimes is confused, is that the walking catfish lacks an adipose fin.  Characteristics and anatomy  The walking catfish has an elongated body shape and reaches almost in length and in weight. Often covered laterally in small white spots, the body is mainly coloured a gray or grayish brown. This catfish has long-based dorsal and anal fins, as well as several pairs of sensory barbels. The skin is scaleless, but covered with mucus, which protects the fish when it is out of water. This fish needs to be handled carefully when fishing it due to its embedded sting or thorn-like defensive mechanism hidden behind its fins (including the middle ones before the tail fin, similar to the majority of all catfishes).  Taxonomy, distribution, and habitat  These fish for sale in HAL market, Bangalore, India are not likely to be C. batrachus (see confused species in text) The walking catfish is a tropical species native to Southeast Asia. The native range of true Clarias batrachus is confirmed from the Indonesian island of Java only, but three closely related and more widespread species frequently have been confused with this species. These are C. magur of northeast India and Bangladesh, a likely undescribed species from Indochina, and another likely undescribed species from the Thai-Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, and Borneo. Both of these undescribed species have been referred to as, Clarias aff. batrachus. At present, the taxonomic position of the Philippines population (called hito or simply \\"catfish\\" by the locals) is unclear, and it also is unclear whether South Indian populations are C. magur or another species. As a consequence, much information (behavioral, ecological, related to introduced populations, etc.) listed for C. batrachus, may be for the closely related species that have been confused with true C. batrachus. True C. batrachus, C. magur and the two likely undescribed species are all kept in aquaculture. Walking catfish thrive in stagnant, frequently hypoxic waters, and often are found in muddy ponds, canals, ditches, and similar habitats. The species spends most of its time on, or right above, the bottom, with occasional trips to the surface to gulp air.  Diet  In the wild, this creature is omnivorous; it feeds on smaller fish, molluscs, and other invertebrates, as well as detritus and aquatic weeds. It is a voracious eater that consumes food supplies rapidly, so it is considered harmful when invasive.  As an invasive species  Within Asia, this species has been introduced widely. It has also been introduced outside its native range where it is considered an invasive species. It consumes the food supplies of native fish and preys on their young. It also is regarded as an invasive species because they can destroy fish farms. Clarias batrachus, captured by a juvenile double-crested cormorant, at the Anhinga Trail in Everglades National Park, Florida, United States In the United States, it is established in Florida.Krueger, Radha, Facts: Walking Catfish in Florida, Florida Museum of Natural History, October 26, 2017 It is reported in California, Connecticut, Georgia, Massachusetts, and Nevada. The walking catfish was imported to Florida, reportedly from Thailand, in the early 1960s for the aquaculture trade. The first introductions apparently occurred in the mid-1960s when adult fish imported as brood stock escaped, either from a fish farm in northeastern Broward County or from a truck transporting brood fish between Dade and Broward Counties. Additional introductions in Florida, supposedly purposeful releases, were made by fish farmers in the Tampa Bay area, Hillsborough County in late 1967 or early 1968, after the state banned the importation and possession of walking catfish. Aquarium releases likely are responsible for introductions in other states. Dill and Cordone (1997) reported this species has been sold by tropical fish dealers in California for some time. They also have been spotted occasionally in the Midwest. In Florida, walking catfish are known to have invaded aquaculture farms, entering ponds where they prey on agricultural fish stocks. In response, fish farmers have had to erect fences to protect ponds. Authorities have also created laws that ban possession of walking catfish. In 2017, Clarias were recovered from the River Tonge, near Bolton, Northern England.  As food  In Thailand, this fish is known as, pla duk dan (). It is a common, inexpensive food item, prepared in a variety of ways. It often is offered by street vendors, especially grilled or fried.Pla duk This fish is one of the most common freshwater catfish in the Philippines where it is known as hito in the local language. In Indonesia, it is called lele, and it is the main ingredient in several native dishes, such as pecel lele. It is a delicacy in the Indian state of Assam, where it is called magur mas (মাগুৰ মাছ). It is eaten in West Bengal মাগুর মাছের ঝোল and is considered good during illness, particularly weakness in body. It is prepared in a light curry sauce with coriander powder and cinnamon powder. It reportedly is fed to children to develop body strength. In Karnataka, it is called murgodu (ಮುರ‍್ಗೋಡು).http://parisaramahiti.kar.nic.in/fish/f169.htm In coastal Karnataka, it is called mugudu () and is considered a delicacy. Neither the Thai nor the Indian population is likely to be the true C. batrachus, however.  Aquarium  A white variation with black patterns is commonly seen in the aquarium fish trade. However, this color variation also is prohibited where walking catfish are banned. Very well-rooted plants and large structures that provide some shade should be included in an aquarium with these fish. Any small tankmates will be eaten by this fish.

Bolton, 410 U.S. 179 (1973), was a decision of the United States Supreme Court overturning the abortion law of Georgia.. The Supreme Court's decision was released on January 22, 1973, the same day as the decision in the better-known case of Roe v. Wade.. Background The Georgia law in question permitted abortion only in cases of rape, severe fetal deformity, or the possibility of severe or fatal injury to the mother. Other restrictions included the requirement that the procedure be approved in writing by three physicians and by a three-member special committee that either (1) continued pregnancy would endanger the pregnant woman's life or \\"seriously and permanently\\" injure her health; (2) the fetus would \\"very likely be born with a grave, permanent and irremediable mental or physical defect\\"; or (3) the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest. In addition, only Georgia residents could receive abortions under this statutory scheme: non-residents could not have an abortion in Georgia under any circumstances. The plaintiff, a pregnant woman who was given the pseudonym \\"Mary Doe\\" in court papers to protect her identity, sued Arthur K. Bolton, then the Attorney General of Georgia, as the official responsible for enforcing the law in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The anonymous plaintiff has since been identified Sandra Cano, young mother of three who was nine weeks pregnant at the time the lawsuit was filed. Cano, who died in 2014, described herself as pro-life and claimed her attorney, Margie Pitts Hames, lied to her in order to have a plaintiff.White, Gayle. \\"Roe v. Wade Role Just a Page in Rocky Life Story\\", The Atlanta Journal and Constitution (2003-01-22). On October 14, 1970, a three-judge panel of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia consisting of Northern District of Georgia Judges Albert John Henderson, Sidney Oslin Smith Jr., and Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Lewis Render Morgan unanimously declared the conditional restrictions portion of the law unconstitutional, though upheld the medical approval and residency requirements. The court also declined to issue an injunction against enforcement of the law, similarly to the district court in the case Roe v. Wade. The plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court under a statute, since repealed, permitting bypass of the circuit appeals court. The oral arguments and re-arguments followed the same schedule as those in Roe. Atlanta attorney Hames represented Doe at the hearings, while Georgia assistant attorney general Dorothy Toth Beasley represented Bolton. Opinion of the Court The same 7–2 majority that struck down a Texas abortion law in Roe v. Wade invalidated most of the remaining restrictions of the Georgia abortion law, including the medical approval and residency requirements. The Court reiterated the protected \\"right to privacy,\\" which applied to matters involving marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child rearing, and education. Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote the majority opinion for the Court, in which he explained \\"the sensitive and emotional nature\\" of the issue and \\"the deep and seemingly absolute convictions\\" on both sides. Justice Blackmun went on to conclude that as a constitutional matter, the right to privacy was \\"broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.\\" Together, Doe and Roe declared abortion as a constitutional right and overturned most laws against abortion in other U.S. states. Roe legalized abortion nationwide for approximately the first six months of pregnancy until the point of fetal viability. =Definition of health= The Court's opinion in Doe v. Bolton stated that a woman may obtain an abortion after viability, if necessary to protect her health. The Court defined \\"health\\" as follows: \\"Whether, in the words of the Georgia statute, \\"an abortion is necessary\\" is a professional judgment that the Georgia physician will be called upon to make routinely. We agree with the District Court, 319 F. Supp., at 1058, that the medical judgment may be exercised in the light of all factors - physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the woman's age - relevant to the well-being of the patient. All these factors may relate to health\\". Subsequent developments In 2003, Sandra Cano filed a motion to re-open the case claiming that she had not been aware that the case had been filed on her behalf and that if she had known she would not have supported the litigation.“'Mary Doe' of Doe v. Bolton Files Motion To Overturn Companion Case to Roe v. Wade” , Kaiser Daily Reproductive Health Report, (2003-08-27). The district court denied her motion, and she appealed. When the appeals court also denied her motion, she requested review by the United States Supreme Court. However, the Supreme Court declined to hear Sandra Cano's suit to overturn the ruling.Mears, Bill. \\"Court won't rethink 'Mary Doe' abortion case\\", CNN (2006-10-10).

Great Seal of King James I appended The Alienation Office was a British Government body charged with regulating the 'alienation' or transfer of certain feudal lands in England by use of a licence to alienate granted by the king, during the feudal era, and by the government thereafter. Establishment The first regulatory structure for controlling the alienation of feudal lands was created during the reign of Henry III (1216-1272), who issued an ordinance prohibiting his tenants-in- chief from alienating their lands held from him without his specific licence. Rationale During the feudal era the king was the only true \\"owner\\" of land under his allodial title, and the rest of the population merely \\"held\\" estates in land from him under various forms of feudal tenure, directly in the case of his tenants-in-chief, and indirectly in the case of sub-tenants of the latter. The king's tenants-in-chief formed the backbone of the royal army.Bracton, who called them \\"barons\\" stated \\"sunt et alii potentes sub rege qui barones dicuntur, hoc est robur belli\\" (\\"there are other magnates under the king, who are called barons, that is the hardwood of war\\"), quoted in Sanders, I.J., Feudal Military Service in England, Oxford, 1956, p.3; \\"Bracton's definition of the baro\\" (plur barones) \\"proves that tenants of this class were considered to be the military backbone of the realm\\" (Sanders, p.3) King William the Conqueror had granted all the land he conquered in England to his principal military commanders, and others to the church and to other of his supporters and servants. These were the first tenants-in-chief of the Anglo-Norman feudal system. The principal was that an estate (or fee) would supply the needs of one knight so that he would be able to appear fully armed, mounted and attended by esquires and retinue, for royal military service for a certain number of days per year. The king wanted to ensure that any new occupant of the fee would be an effective soldier, thus a licence to alienate was effectively a royal veto on a new tenant-in-chief. Penalties for non- compliance Originally the penalty for not obtaining a royal licence was forfeiture of the lands concerned. The next major change occurred in 1327, when the penalty for non-compliance was changed from forfeiture to a fine, payable into the Hanaper of the Chancery. As with many English legal and regulatory systems a gradual evolution occurred to deliver a settled system. The penalty for alienating land without a royal licence became one year's revenue from that land, and the payment required to obtain a licence to alienate was one third of the value of the land to be alienated. Alienation Office In 1576 the Alienation Office was first established on a proper basis. Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester was granted a 10-year farm of the revenues due under the alienation of property licensing regime. The farm also covered monies payable from 'pre-fines' payable during the applicant's hearing in the Court of Final Pleas. The Office developed from the structures created by Dudley during this period. Ten years later an extension of the farm was granted to Thomas Dudley and Robert Wrotte, acting as agents for Robert Dudley. Dudley died in 1588, but the regime he created continued in place, and in 1595 was further extended to cover fines imposed for writs of entry in the process of common recovery. The office was established in premises on today's site of King's Bench Walk, Temple, London, which now house legal chambers. During the period of the Commonwealth (1649-1660) there was a brief gap in the office's existence. It was abolished in September 1653, but was resurrected a year later once the full-extent of loss in revenue to the state had been fully appreciated. More drastic change occurred in 1661, shortly after feudal tenures were abolished by the Tenures Abolition Act 1660. The concept of tenancy-in-chief was removed from English law, and regulations restricting the free conveyance of land were removed. The Alienation Office however continued in existence for nearly another 200 years. Following the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the ascension of the throne by William III and Mary II, a new form of control over the Alienation Office was created when in May 1689 the Commissioners of the Treasury started to exercise control over the Office by use of letters patent created under the Privy Seal. In 1758 a small extension of the jurisdiction of the Office took place when post fines were dealt with directly by the Office, which both assessed and collected them. However sheriffs still continued to remit to the Exchequer a sum of equal value to the post fines due from their county, formerly collected by them. The 18th. century closed with an extensive inquiry by a House of Commons select committee into the workings and financing of the Office. The pace of reform in the United Kingdom gathered pace in the 1830s, and the structure of the Alienation Office did not survive that decade. In 1834 land conveyancing was reformed and the system of fines and recoveries was abolished, which left the Alienation Office with no substantial function. It was consequently abolished in 1835.

The station's current configuration consists of a temporary footbridge and two platforms, one for trains inbound towards the city center, the other outbound towards Ostkreuz and Lichtenberg. The first station building opened on 11 August 1884 and stood until 1903. The second station building, designed by Karl Cornelius, stood from 1903 until 1924. The third station building, designed by Richard Brademann and constructed in 1924, was heavily damaged due to the destruction of Warschauer Bridge during World War II and required extensive reconstruction and alteration. The station remained largely unchanged for decades. Warschauer Straße station was reconstructed in 1983, and a new platform opened on 20 December 1986. This was in order to provide greater transport access to the increasingly developed northeast districts of the city, Neu-Hohenschönhausen and Marzahn. Due to a lack of maintenance, the station building developed acute structural defects and was closed in late 2004. Soon after, the station building and platform access were demolished in April 2005 and replaced with a temporary walkway and stairs. As part of a long term renovation and reconstruction project for S-Bahn Ostkreuz, Warschauer Straße, and Ostbahnhof stations, a new reception building and two new central platforms are being built at S-Bahn Warschauer Straße station. March 2012 saw the removal from service and demolition of platforms B and C. The newly rebuilt platform B returned to operation in May 2013 with only one edge of the platform active. Construction planners initially planned to begin construction of the new entrance hall in the summer of 2013, with an opening in 2016. Construction began in 2016 and has progressed quickly to the point where the concrete and steel of the new building has been completed. On Sunday 2 July, two of the temporary Imbiss street food huts were torn down, to be followed in time by the remainder, when the temporary foot bridge along the side of the new station building is also removed. Nearby landmarks The Oberbaumbrücke, the East Side Gallery as well as the Mercedes-Benz Arena (former O2 World arena) can be reached on foot. Three discothèques are located in the basement vaults of the U-Bahn building: The Matrix Club, since 1996, one of the biggest venues in Berlin with up to nine bars and five dancefloors, the Narva Lounge and the Busche. Line information The station is served by the S-Bahn lines S3, S5, S7, S75 and S9, as well as the subway line U1. Access to tram lines M10 and M13, as well as the city bus is also locally possible.

He developed an activistic anthropological philosophy with a definite program of social change. He was called the Serbian Nikolay Dobrolyubov. Early life Marković was born in the town of Zaječar on 9 September 1846, the son of a police clerk. Marković's childhood was spent in the village of Rekovac and then the town of Jagodina. The family moved to Kragujevac in 1856. He reached adolescence at about the time Mihailo Obrenović became the Prince of Serbia. In 1860 he began to study at the gymnasium in Belgrade and in 1863 at the Velika škola of Belgrade, the highest educational body in Serbia at that time, founded in 1808. While at the Grandes écoles (Velika škola) he became interested in literature and politics, falling under the influences of Vuk Karadžić and Vladimir Jovanović, a leading Serbian Liberal. Because of his outstanding record as a student at the Belgrade college, his professors unanimously nominated him for a post-graduate scholarship to study abroad. He chose to study in Russia, in St. Petersburg in particular. For the next three years, he lived in Russia and came under the influence of Russian radicals of the 1860s, but his political agitation forced him to leave Russia for Switzerland. At the ETH Zurich, a STEM university in the City of Zurich, Marković resumed his interrupted studies and in his spare time continued to write articles on social and political issues. There too, politics got in the way of his studies, and when his scholarship was suspended, he returned to Belgrade with new ideas. Marković immediately began attracting attention and from 1868 until his early death, became one of the leading figures in Serbia's quest to reclaim its lost ancestral territories and enter into the comity of nations. Study abroad In 1866, he received a scholarship to study at the Alexander I Institute of Communication Engineers in St. Petersburg.Svetozar Marković in Russia, Gale Stokes, Slavic Review, Vol. 31, No. 3 (Sep., 1972), pp. 611-612 Here he became involved with the Russian socialist underground who, in the main, were followers of the agrarian socialists Nikolai Chernyshevsky, who wrote and edited Nikolay Nekrasov's The Contemporary magazine. There he also met Dmitry Pisarev and Lyuben Karavelov, who in the autumn of 1876 took part as a volunteer in the Serbian campaign against the Ottomans, and subsequently joined the Bulgarian irregular contingent with the Russian army in the war of 1877–78. Together with a few other men of birth and education, Mikhail Katkov, Konstantin Pobedonostsev, and Aleksey Suvorin, Marković began secretly to sow the sentiments of democracy among the peasants. His sympathetic nature was influenced by indignation against the brutal methods adopted towards activists, especially political prisoners, and by the stern measures which the authorities felt compelled to adopt in order to repress the revolutionary movement. His indignation carried him into accord for a time with those who advocated the acceptance of constitutional methods. In consequence, he exposed himself to danger by remaining in Russia, and in 1869 he was obliged to leave the country. In March of that year, he left Russia, suspecting, rightly, that he was in danger of being arrested by the Russian authorities for his socialist sympathies with the revolutionaries. He succeeded in making his escape—possibly he was permitted to leave on account of his youth and immediately began a more rigorous campaign against autocracy. He settled for a time in Switzerland, then known as the haven of revolutionary leaders, such as Johann Philipp Becker and others. He resumed his studies at Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zurich (better known as ETH Zurich) but after a semester or two, after criticizing Serbia's Jovan Ristić and Milivoje Petrović Blaznavac, he lost his scholarship. He then abandoned his education and went back to Serbia, where he met journalist Pera Todorović, one of the future founders of the 'People's Radical Party and his wife journalist Milica Ninković, and other young intellectuals who wanted to make a change. Back to the Balkans Shortly after he arrived, he gathered a small group of students, which included the future Radical leader Nikola Pašić. At the time, Serbia was ruled by a regency on behalf of Prince Milan, in place since 1868. In the spring of 1869, the Serbian Liberal Party signed an accord with the Regency and a constitution with a toothless assembly was set up. Marković denounced this deal as a sellout and formed a minuscule radical party. Marković now sought to wrest control of the youth wing Omladina from the Liberal Party. The Congress of Omladina met in late August 1870 in the Serbian city of Novi Sad, which in those days was in the hands of Austria-Hungary yet close to the then Serbian border. Marković and his fellow radicals proposed a resolution calling for decentralization and a number of social measures which began with: \\"The solution of the nationality problem in Austria-Hungary, and the Eastern Question, on the principle of 'free humanity'.\\" Vladimir Jovanović's liberal supporters countered with a call for an aggressive foreign policy saying that domestic policies had to take second place to unification of the South Slavs. A compromise was reached calling for decentralization and an expansionist foreign policy. On 1 June 1871, Marković launched Serbia's first socialist newspaper with Đura Ljočić as editor. The paper, Radenik (\\"The Worker\\") struck a careful balance between outspokenness while avoiding printing anything that would get it banned. The paper proved very successful. It was soon being denounced by the establishment as the first socialist paper in the Balkans. A group of deputies of the Serbian National Assembly accused Radenik of propagating communism \\"thus striking at the very foundations of the state; faith morals and property.\\" In March 1872, the government decided to arrest Marković however, warned in advance, he escaped across the Sava into Hungarian territory. Finally Radenik overstepped the mark once too often when it published an article in which Christ was described as a communist and a revolutionary. Using that as a pretext, the government banned the paper in May 1872 for blasphemy and treason. In Realni Pravac u Nauci i Zivotu (\\"The Real Trend in Science and Life\\") which appeared in Letopis Matice Srpske, (1871–72) and other works, he developed an activistic anthropological philosophy with a definite program of social change. By this time the ideas of Stankevich, Chernyshevsky, Dobrolyubov, Pisarev and other Russian revolutionary democrats, the materialistic philosophies of Buchner, Vogt, and Moleschott, and the revolutionary theories of Darwin and Spencer had gained considerable ground among Serbian intellectuals. He emphasized the role of science and of an educated minority in the historical process. He held that there are objective laws governing social progress but that they depend on the laws of human nature, which can be discovered by an analysis of the history of mankind. Genuine intellectuals help their people to become aware of their sufferings and their real needs and to produce a radical change in their conditions. A social revolution, therefore, presupposes the total intellectual power of the people. In time, Ljubomir Nedić, another philosopher and literary critic, took issue with Marković's premise. Serbia in the East He opened his literary career in June 1872 by a work on Srbija na istoku (\\"Serbia in the East\\"), published in Novi Sad, wherein he analyses the history of Serbia, interpreting the Serbian society before the First Serbian Uprising of 1804 as a society divided not so much on religious lines as by class. Marković argued that the Serbian revolt against the Ottomans had a social character rather than a religious one. He saw the social organization of the Serbian peasants who played the leading role in eventual successful overthrow of Ottoman rule as insufficient to prevent the new state becoming a despotism which soon brought to life a parasitic bureaucracy. Marković argued that growth of Serbia while this bureaucracy was in control would not lead to greater freedom, but merely strengthen the power of that bureaucracy. As an alternative to this Marković advocated democratic federalism. Marković idealized the old Balkan family structure, the zadruga, and believed that the state should merely serve to coordinate the activities of opštine, or small communities organized on the zadruga principle. In fact, he preferred a federal and revolutionary Serbia: At the time Marković was making an intensive study of socialism. And, from this framework for an analyses of Serbia came the basis for the growth of a movement of which Marković became the spiritual father and which years later, according to some, would become the Serbian Democratic Party under the leadership of Dimitrije Tucović. Return to Serbia As an exile, Marković had carried on his former line of thought and activity. Owing to his political activities in Novi Sad, Marković was expelled by the Hungarian authorities, but was promptly arrested upon his arrival in Serbia. He was already known in Eastern Europe by his book, Serbia in the East, which had been published recently (1872). The new Prime Minister, Jovan Ristić, immediately released him. Ristić owed his position to the whim of Prince Milan, and as a result, was opposed by both the liberals and the conservatives. Ristić hoped that releasing Marković would keep the socialists off his back. On 8 November 1873, a new newspaper, Javnost (\\"The Public\\") began publication in Kragujevac with Marković as editor. Marković was initially quite gentle on the new conservative government that had come to power only a few weeks before Javnost began publication. Javnost's criticism quickly became more strident. The government lost patience and on 8 January 1874, Marković was arrested, even though he had handed over editorship by then. In the meanwhile, his supporters were running another newspaper, Glas Javnosti, which was started in anticipation of Javnost being banned. Trial Marković had been in ill health for some time and being kept in a damp, poorly heated cell in a Požarevac gaol made matters worse. His trial for \\"press crimes\\" began on 19 February 1874. Defending himself against the charges that he had \\"insulted\\" the National Assembly by dismissing it as a mere debating society, Marković answered that he had written the truth. He then launched into a defense of the freedom of the press. On the charge that he had defended the right of the people \\"to overthrow a prince who does them evil and replace him with a good one\\", he denied that this was a call for revolution. He had been talking in the abstract. 16 years before the Marković trial, the Serbian people and the National Assembly exercised this right and in 1858 deposed Prince Alexander Karađorđević and recalled the reigning prince's father, Miloš Obrenović to the throne. The trial attracted a large audience, including many of the local peasants. As a result of the trial Marković became a symbol of the growing discontent against the government. Marković's conviction was a foregone conclusion but the sentence, 18 months in prison, was relatively light. However, by now his general health problems had developed into full blown tuberculosis. The sentence was further reduced to nine months; it was far from certain that he would survive his term in prison. He was released on 16 November 1874, and went to Jagodina to convalesce. Socialist success During Marković's imprisonment and building on the publicity created by Marković's trial, for the first time socialists succeed in getting elected to the National Assembly and small but vocal group, advocating Marković's ideas, formed round the Serb from Croatia, Adam Bogosavljević. Ignoring warnings that he needed to recover his health first, Marković was unable to stay in the background. On 1 January 1875 Oslobođenje (Liberation) came out, with Marković at the helm. He was as outspoken as ever at a time when harassment of socialists was in full swing. When, however, the police told him he had the choice either to submit to arrest or leave Serbia, he chose the latter. This time he had no illusions that prison would be anything other than a death sentence. Death Marković caught a Danube steamer for Vienna. Here the doctors told him that there was little hope for him, and they recommended he go to Dalmatia where the climate was warmer. He reached Trieste but collapsed in his hotel. He did not recover and died on 26 February 1875, at the age of 28. He is buried in Jagodina where he spent most of his youth. Literature and politics A major literary critic of this time was Svetozar Marković, who was also the first to introduce the doctrine of social reform among the Serbs. In contrast to previous trends, he believed that literature should actively serve the needs of the majority of the people and deal with the basic problems of everyday life. The acknowledged catalyst of the new trend, Svetozar Marković's influence was an indirect one; he was primarily a social and political thinker and publicist. In the 1870s Marković in Serbia and Vaso Pelagić in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia were what their teachers Chernishevsky, Dobrolyubov, and Pisarev were in Russia in the 1860s. Immediately after the war and revolution of 1870–71, the nonviolent antistatism of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon reasserted its appeal to a new and chastened generation of social revolutionaries, this movement gained a new following in agrarian southern and eastern Europe. Seminal protagonists of populism like Russia's Nikolay Mikhaylovsky and Serbia's Svetozar Marković translated the works of Proudhon. Marković in particular exerted tremendous influence on his contemporaries recommending them to be positivists in science, republicans in politics, and realists or rather utiliterians in literature. He proudly subscribed to the realistic novels of Jakov Ignjatović. Practically all the new writers — Milovan Glišić, Laza Lazarević, Janko Veselinović, and Simo Matavulj, to name only the best, were in one way or another under the influence of realism, including Jaša Tomić and poet Vladimir M. Jovanović (1859–1898). Under Marković's influence, Glišić undertook to translate Gogol's Dead Souls and Tolstoy's War and Peace. In the elections of 1875 the socialist-radicals made significant gains and were for a time a significant force in Serbian politics. It was not however able to stay united in the long term. In 1881 Nikola Pašić and other followers of Marković founded a new radical party. Socialist ideas of Svetozar Marković lived after him. For example, Jovan Skerlić began to work for various socialist and opposition newspapers, such as Socijaldemokrat (\\"Social Democrat\\"), Radničke novine (\\"Worker's Herald\\"), and Delo (\\"Work\\"). Altogether, Marković ought to be seen as a thinker of depth and originality, independence and earnestness, whose short and difficult life did much towards the knowledge and appreciation of Serbian thought. Many Serbian traditionalists regard him as the heretic and a dangerous modernist. There is no doubt that when he treats more purely theological questions he sometimes lays himself open to a charge of that kind. Marković is at his best and surest in the philosophy of history and in ethics. He is the chief representative of an important philosophical school of which many members whose thought is largely occupied with the nature and destiny of man and society—a school which is not without a certain influence on Christians. Legacy The Socialism of the new radical party did not survive the failure of the 1883–1884 Timok uprising, after which the radicals repackaged themselves as a nationalist party. For the Yugoslav communists, Marković was merely a Utopian. Nevertheless, his writings (extensive considering how young he died) remained influential even though no political party claimed to follow in his footsteps. Anarchist Krsta Cicvarić, speaking in 1920, said \\"all of us in Serbia who are democrats or socialists learned the political ABC's from Marković.\\" A Yugoslav film on his life, Svetozar Marković, directed by Eduard Galić, was first shown in 1980. The Belgrade University Library is named after Svetozar Marković, along with numerous institutions in Serbia. He is included in The 100 most prominent Serbs.

T. Raju (1954), The Concept of the Spiritual in Indian Thought, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 4, No. 3 (Oct., 1954), pp. 210 To a karma yogi, right action is a form of prayer. It is one of the paths in the spiritual practices of Hindus, others being Jnana yoga (path of knowledge) and Bhakti yoga (path of loving devotion to a personal god).John Lochtefeld (2014), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Rosen Publishing New York, , pages 98-100, also see articles on bhaktimārga and jnanamārgaKaren Pechelis (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, , pages 14-15, 37-38 The three paths are not mutually exclusive in Hinduism, but the relative emphasis between Karma yoga, Jnana yoga and Bhakti yoga varies by the individual. Of the paths to spiritual liberation in Hinduism, karma yoga is the path of unselfish action.Robert A. McDermott (1975), Indian Spirituality in the West: A Bibliographical Mapping, Philosophy East and West, University of Hawai'i Press, Vol. 25, No. 2 (Apr 1975), pp. 228-230 It teaches that a spiritual seeker should act according to dharma, without being attached to the fruits or personal consequences. Karma Yoga, states the Bhagavad Gita, purifies the mind. It leads one to consider dharma of work, and the work according to one's dharma, doing god's work and in that sense becoming and being \\"like unto god Krishna\\" in every moment of one's life. Concept According to Lord Krishna in Bhagavad Gita, Karma yoga is the spiritual practice of \\"selfless action performed for the benefit of others\\". Karma yoga is a path to reach moksha (spiritual liberation) through work. It is rightful action without being attached to fruits or being manipulated by what the results might be, a dedication to one's duty, and trying one's best while being neutral to rewards or outcomes such as success or failure. The tendency for a human being to seek the fruits of action is normal, state Hindu texts, but an exclusive attachment to fruits and positive immediate consequences can compromise dharma (ethical, rightful action). Karma yoga, states Bilimoria, is \\"ethically fine-tuned action\\". According to Stephen Phillips, a professor of philosophy and Asian studies, \\"only dharmic action\\" is suitable in karma yoga, where one downplays one's own exclusive role or one's own exclusive interests. Instead, the karma yogi considers the interests of all parties impartially, all beings, the elements of Prakṛti and then does the right thing. However, adds Phillips, there are commentators who disagree and state \\"any action can be done as karma yoga\\" and it doesn't have to be consistent with dharma. Karma yoga, states Bilimoria, does not mean forfeiture of emotions or desires, rather it means action driven by \\"equanimity, balance\\", with \\"dispassion, disinterest\\", avoiding \\"one sidedness, fear, craving, favoring self or one group or clan, self-pity, self-aggrandizement or any form of extreme reactiveness\\". A Karma yogi acts and does his or her duty, whether that be as \\"a homemaker, mother, nurse, carpenter or garbage collector, with no thought for one's own fame, privilege or financial reward, but simply as a dedication to the Lord\\", states Harold Coward – professor of Religious Studies with a focus on Indian religions. According to Phillips, Karma yoga applies to \\"any action in any profession or family activities\\", where the yogi works selflessly to others' benefit. This is in contrast to other forms of yoga which focus on self-development and self-realization, typically with isolation and meditative introspection. The \\"disinterested action\\" idea, states Phillips, is not unique to Hinduism, and similar disinterested non-craving precepts for monks and nuns are found in Buddhism and Jainism. =Bhagavad Gita= According to the Bhagavad Gita, selfless service to the right cause and like-minded others, with the right feeling and right attitude, is a form of worship and spirituality. Verse 3.4 of the Bhagavad Gita states that avoiding work or not starting work is not the path to become free of bondage, just as renouncing the world and wearing monk's dress does not automatically make one spiritual. Not acting is a form of action with consequences and karmic impact, and the nature of existence is such that human beings are always acting in their environment, body or mind, and never for a moment are they not, according to verse 3.5. The verses 3.6 to 3.8 of the Bhagavad Gita state that the action can be motivated by body or manipulated by external influences. Alternatively, it can be motivated by one's inner reflection and true self (soul, Atman, Brahman). The former creates bondage, the latter empowers freedom. The spiritual path to the liberated state of bliss is to do the best one is able to while being detached to outcomes, to fruits, to success or failure. A karma yogi who practices such nishkama karma (niṣkāmakarma), states Bhawuk, is following \\"an inward journey, which is inherently fulfilling and satisfying\\". A part of the premise of \\"disinterested action\\" is that the more one acts with the hope of getting rewards, the more one is liable to disappointment, frustration or self-destructive behavior. Further, another part of the premise is that the more one is committed to \\"disinterested action\\", the more one considers the dharma (ethical dimension), focuses on other aspects of the action, strives to do one's best, and this leads to liberating self-empowerment. According to chapter 5 of the Bhagavad Gita, both sannyasa (renunciation, monastic life) and karma yoga are means to liberation. Between the two, it recommends karma yoga, stating that anyone who is a dedicated karma yogi neither hates nor desires, and therefore such as person is the \\"eternal renouncer\\". The Bhagavad Gita gives a summary of the karma yoga process.Maharishi Mahesh Yogi on the Bhagavad-Gita, a New Translation and Commentary, Chapter 1-6. Penguin Books, 1969, p 131 (v 45), p 144 (v.51), p 149-150 (v.54) The Gita itself is a chapter from the epic known as Mahabharata, wherein a dialogue takes place between the prince Arjuna, and his friend and chariot driver, Lord Krishna, on the brink of a great dynastic war. Their conversation is prompted by Arjuna as he is engulfed by sorrow and misgivings regarding the oncoming battle in which he has friends and relatives on both sides. In reply, Krishna then elucidates upon a number of philosophical yoga systems and practices (including karma yoga) by/through which Arjuna should indeed continue with the fight on righteous principles. In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna says: > \\"tasmad asaktah satatam karyam karma samacara asakto hy acaran karma param > apnoti purushah\\" > Therefore, without being attached to the results of activities, one should > act as a matter of duty, for by working without attachment one attains the > Supreme.Chapter 3, Text 19, Bhagavad Gita =Other Hindu texts= The earliest texts that are forerunners of the karma yoga ideas in the Bhagavad Gita are the ancient Upanishads, such as the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad. Other Vedic texts as well as post-Vedic literature of the Mimamsa school of Hindu philosophy mention karma marga, but these contextually refer to the path of rituals. According to Raju, the Mimamsa ideas, though orthodox, were the fertile grounds on which the later ideas of Karma yoga developed.P. T. Raju (1954), The Concept of the Spiritual in Indian Thought, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 4, No. 3 (Oct., 1954), pp. 212-213 Karma yoga is discussed in many other Hindu texts. For example, the section 11.20 of the Bhagavata Purana states that there are only three means to spiritual liberation: jnana yoga (knowledge), karma yoga (action) and bhakti yoga (devotion). Those who are of philosophical bent, prefer the \\"knowledge path\\". Those who are inclined to productive application of arts, skills and knowledge, prefer the \\"karma path\\". Those who prefer emotional connection, prefer the \\"devotional path\\". These three paths overlap, with different relative emphasis. Discussions on Karma yoga are also found in chapter 33 of Narada Purana. Later, new movements within Hinduism added raja yoga as the fourth spiritual path, but this is not universally accepted as distinct to other three. Karma yoga versus Kriya yoga According to Constance Jones and James Ryan, karma yoga is \\"yoga of action\\" while kriya yoga is \\"yoga of ritual action\\". Kriya yoga is found in tantric texts, and believed by its practitioners to activate chakra and energy centers in the body. In that sense, kriya yoga is a subset of karma yoga.

At the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, Davis became the first African American athlete to win a gold medal in an individual event at the Olympic Winter Games, winning the speedskating 1000 meter event. He also won a silver medal in the 1500 meter event. At the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, he repeated the feat, becoming the first man to successfully defend the 1000 meters and repeating as the 1500 meter silver medalist. Davis won the silver medal at the 2004 World Allround Speed Skating Championships. He then proceeded to win the World Allround Championships in both 2005 and 2006. In 2009, he won the World Sprint Championships in Moscow, the site of his first World Allround Championship victory. When Davis won those events, he became the second male skater to win both the Sprint and Allround in his career, after Eric Heiden. He has won six World Single Distance Championships titles, three at 1500 meters (in 2004, 2007 and 2009) and three at 1000 meters (in 2007, 2008 and 2011), and he led the United States to its first and only World Championship gold medal in the Team Pursuit event in 2011. He has won ten career Overall World Cup titles, six at 1000 meters (in 2006, 2008–10, 2012, 2014) and four at 1500 meters (2008–2011). Davis also earned the title of Grand World Cup Champion for the 2013–14 season, earning the most points across all distances. His 58 career individual victories on the ISU Speed Skating World Cup circuit (through March 2014) place him second all-time among men. Davis has set a total of nine world records. He held the top spot on the world Adelskalender list after taking the lead from Sven Kramer in March 2009 for a little over ten years until Patrick Roest surpassed him in March 2019.http://www.speedskatingstats.com/index.php?file=adelskalender The Adelskalender ranks the all-time fastest long track speed skaters by personal best times in the four World Allround Championship distances. Davis is known for his consistency and technical proficiency.Prospero, Linda (2006). \\"Shani Davis makes history\\" La Stampa (accessed June 26, 2006). Davis is a native of Chicago, Illinois, and trains at two U.S. Olympic training facilities, the Pettit National Ice Center in West Allis, Wisconsin, and the Utah Olympic Oval in Salt Lake City, Utah. Early life Davis was born on Friday, August 13, 1982, in Chicago, Illinois, to Reginald Shuck and Cherie Davis. His father selected the name \\"Shani\\" from an African name dictionary; the name translates \\"to adventure.\\" His mother, Cherie, worked for a man who was a local lawyer as well as a speed skating official. The lawyer's son was an elite level speed skater. At her lawyer's suggestion, Cherie enrolled Shani at the Robert Crown Center in nearby Evanston when he was six years old. Cherie was determined that her son would reach his maximum potential. She would wake Shani up in the morning to run a mile on a nearby track to build up his endurance. In order to be closer to his skating club, she and Davis moved from the neighborhood of Hyde Park to Rogers Park. Career =Junior-level competition= At 16, Davis was invited to Lake Placid, New York, to participate in a development program for young speed skaters. After training there for a year, Davis decided to pursue his Olympic dreams and moved to Marquette, Michigan, to further his training. There, he would graduate from Marquette Senior High School, where he ran track his senior year. Davis earned spots on both the long track and short track teams at the 1999 junior world championship, simultaneously making the national team. In 2000, he made history by becoming the first U.S. skater to make the long and short track teams at the Junior World Teams, a feat he would accomplish again in 2001 and 2002. His height has always made him unique among short trackers, who are much shorter. The extra height made it easier for Davis to race low to the ice. Davis would go on to win a bronze medal in the Team Relay at the 2005 World Short Track Championships in Beijing, China, shared by U.S. teammates Apolo Ohno, Rusty Smith and Alex Izykowski. =2002 Winter Olympics= Olympic qualification controversy In December 2001, Davis traveled to Utah to compete for a spot on the 2002 Winter Olympics short track team. Teammates Apolo Ohno and Rusty Smith already had slots on the six-man team due to points earned from earlier races, and Ron Biondo was a lock for the third spot. In order for Davis to qualify, he would have to win the final race. Ohno and Smith were both participating, and it would be necessary for Davis to cross the finish line first. Ohno had been dominant in the meet up to this point because he won every race with ease. A win by Davis seemed to be a long shot. In a major surprise, Davis won the 1000m race, with Smith second and Ohno third. Davis's first-place finish earned him enough points to move past Tommy O'Hare (whom Davis had beaten earlier in the semi-final) in the final point standings; he now qualified for sixth place. Davis now became the first African-American skater to earn a spot on the team. The euphoria of the victory was short- lived, however. Rumors began to swirl that Ohno and Smith—both good friends of Davis—intentionally threw the race in order to let Davis win the event.Price, S.L. (2002): \\"Launch of Apolo\\" Sports Illustrated (accessed May 24, 2007). After returning to Colorado Springs, O'Hare would file a formal complaint. For three days, Ohno, Smith and Davis stood before an arbitration panel as three of their fellow skaters testified that they heard Ohno telling Smith that he was going to let Davis win.Outside the Lines: Was the Fix In? ESPN. Ohno would later confess that he had subconsciously held back for fear of suddenly crashing into Davis or Smith, a common occurrence in the sport. He pointed out that he did not need to win the race because he already had a spot on the team. Questions persisted as to whether Ohno had really held back, since he kept passing Biondo. Some speculated that Ohno was holding off Biondo from challenging Smith, as Smith also needed to finish ahead of Biondo in order to secure a spot in the 1000 m for Salt Lake. Even this scenario would have been a violation of the rules of team skating. Both claims went unproven in the arbitration case, and all three were absolved of guilt. On February 13, 2002, Sports Illustrated writer Brian Cazeneuve published an article stating that, after reviewing the race, \\"To this day, there is no concrete proof that any skaters violated the spirit of competition.\\"Cazeneuve, Brian (2002): Did they or didn't they? More on the great short-track speed skating controversy Sports Illustrated (accessed May 30, 2007) Cazeneuve however, also published the comments of Outdoor Life Network commentator Todd Harris and 1998 Winter Olympian speed skater Eric Flaim, which were made during the broadcast of the race; both men agreed that Ohno and Smith had not skated to the best of their abilities. Davis wanted to be able to concentrate on both long track and short track. At the time, he was living in Marquette, Michigan, a town with no long track. In 2003, he decided to move to Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Once there, he trained with 1998 short track gold medalist Derrick Campbell. Davis arrived in Salt Lake City for the 2002 Winter Olympics. After the opening day ceremonies, he decided to leave the Games early to compete in the 2002 Junior Country March and Junior World Championships held in Italy, where he won the 1500m at both competitions. Davis became the only U.S. skater to ever make both short track and long track junior world teams three years in a row. =Turning pro= Davis made the jump from junior competition to men's speed skating in 2003. In February of that year, he earned the title of North American long track champion, which qualified him for the World Championship in Gothenburg, Sweden. During the competition, Davis was not yet adjusted to skating in the men's division, and his scores were much lower than usual; he finished 16th overall. In January 2004, Davis became a North American champion for the second consecutive year. He finished in second place overall in the 2004 World Allround Long Track Championships in Hamar, Norway. In March, Davis won the 1500 m at the men's World Single Distance Championships in Seoul, finishing the race in 1:48.64 in March 2004. Davis set three world records in 2005 – two of them in Salt Lake City. At the World Championship Qualifier on January 9, 2005, he broke the 1500 m world record, recording a time of 1:43.33. He also set the world record for best overall time in the history of the Qualifiers – 149.359. A month later, Davis would win the World Champion all-round, scoring 150.778 points. In November, Davis would break another world record at the third World Cup match in the fall of 2005, skating the 1000 m in 1:07.03. Davis did not participate at the Olympic Trials in Salt Lake City in December 2005 because his performances in the Fall World Cup events had already pre- qualified him for the Olympic Team in the 1000 m, 1500 m and 5000 m events. =2006 Winter Olympics= Davis won the gold medal in the 1000 m and the silver medal in the 1500 m in Turin. Turin and the team pursuit controversy The team pursuit event had its inception at the senior level during the 2004–05 season. Davis had never practiced or participated in the event, and U.S. Speedskating never expressed an interest in having Davis skate in the team pursuit event. In April 2005, U.S. Speedskating voted that it could appoint skaters to the Olympic Pursuit Team who had not otherwise made the team in an individual event. Having never skated the pursuit event, Davis submitted his declaration to U.S. Speed skating; he informed them of his intention to skate the 1000 m, 1500 m, and 5000 m. On December 31, 2005, U.S. Speed skating named the maximum allotted 5 member team (K. C. Boutiette, Chad Hedrick, Charles Leveille, Clay Mull and Derek Parra). The U.S coaches arrived in Turin and named Davis as a substitute to the pursuit team without his knowledge or consent. In the event of an injury after the team had entered the competition track, substitution would be permitted if an International Skating Union (ISU) Withdrawal Form had been presented to and accepted by the referee.QUALIFICATION AND ENTRIES FOR THE SPEED SKATING EVENTS AT THE 2006 OLYMPIC WINTER GAMES (OWG 2006) INTERNATIONAL SKATING UNION Communication No. 1336 No such injuries occurred, which meant that Davis was not even eligible to skate the team pursuit event at the Olympics. The lineup for Team USA was announced on Saturday, February 11. Hedrick would skate with Mull and Leveille in the preliminary races; veteran Olympians Boutiette and Parra were reserved for the finals.U.S. announces team pursuit skaters. USA Today (2006-02-12) Within hours, articles that denounced Davis as unpatriotic, selfish, and a poor teammate were posted on the Internet. Those same stories hit the newspapers the next day. Davis had to defend himself and make up excuses for not skating in an event he was never eligible to compete in from the start. U.S. Speedskating remained silent during the controversy. Hedrick directed much of the criticism towards Davis. Two days before the official announcement, Hedrick stated, \\"I don't see what his logic is. We can't be beat if he skates. It's his decision. I'm not going to get in the middle of it. I would like him to be in the pursuit, but am I going to beg him? No.\\"NewsDaily The two skaters who had not earned spots in any individual event had been brought to Turin specifically to skate the team pursuit. Ironically, Davis said that he did not want to skate the pursuit event so that those skaters would have a chance to compete; this was a chance that Davis had been denied during the 2002 Games. \\"It was a difficult decision for me,\\" Davis said. \\"Athletes came here just for [team] pursuit. I came here just for the 1000 meters, the 1500 meters, the 5000 meters.\\" In an email sent by U.S Speedskating Executive Director on February 3, 2005, USS terminated Davis' athlete agreement effective February 4, 2005, discontinuing Davis' USS benefits and terminating USS rights to the use of Davis' name and image. Davis remained estranged from U.S. Speedskating.Shani Davis, Chad Hedrick full of positive vibes. The Washington Post. (2010-02-14). =Post-Olympic performance= Davis during the World Cup in Heerenveen in 2007 Davis won the final 1000 m World Cup event of the 2006 season at Thialf, Heerenveen, with a time of 1:08.91, becoming the first skater to skate below 1:09 in Heerenveen and also winning the overall World Cup on the 1000 meters. He placed fourth overall in the 1500 meters World Cup, despite only competing in three of the five races. Davis then defended his World Allround Championships title in Calgary in March 2006 with a world record allround score of 145.742. At the competition, Davis was paired with teammate Chad Hedrick in the 1500 meter race, and dramatically broke Hedrick's own world record with a time of 1:42.68, which Davis would later rebreak that year with a time of 1:42.32. Regarding his world allround title, Davis said, \\"To me, this is bigger than the Olympics. This medal is prestigious. Not only do you have to skate 500 meters, but you have to skate 10000, you have to skate a 1500 and a 5000 and you only have two days to do it.\\"Shani Davis (Long Track Speedskating). chicago.about.com In the 2006–07 season, Davis placed third at the World Sprint Championships held in Hamar in January 2007 and also won world titles in the 1000 m and 1500 m events at the World Single Distance Championships held in Salt Lake City in March 2007. In the 2007–08 season, Davis won overall world cup titles in the 1000 m and 1500 m, defended his 1000 m world title at the World Single Distance Championships held in Nagano, Japan, and tied for second in the 1500 m with Sven Kramer of the Netherlands. In the 2008–09 season, Davis defended his world cup titles in the 1000 m and 1500 m. He broke world records in the 1000 m and 1500 m and won the 1500 world title at the World Single Distance Championships held in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. He placed third in 1000 m and won the 2009 World Sprint Speed Skating Championship in Moscow. He became only the second male skater in history—joining Eric Heiden—to win both the World Allround and World Sprint titles. =2010 Winter Olympics= Davis with the medals that he won in the 2010 Winter Olympics At the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, Davis competed in four long-track speed skating events: the 500, 1000, 1500 and 5000 meter races. All four of these events were held at the Richmond Olympic Oval, where Davis had held the track record in the 1000 and 1500 meter races, setting those records in 2009. Davis won the 1000-meter speed skating event, becoming the first man to win back-to-back 1000-meter Olympic speed skating gold medals and the only gold medal for speed skating from the United States at these games.

American flagbearer voting controversy  One day before the February 9 opening ceremonies for the 2018 Winter Olympics, Davis Tweeted his displeasure with the process for choosing the American team flag bearer. Following a vote among representative athletes from each of the eight winter sports federations, Davis and four-time Olympic luger Erin Hamlin had each received four votes. Following the pre-determined procedure for settling a tie vote, a coin toss was made. Hamlin won the toss and was therefore selected to carry the flag. Davis's Tweet called the coin toss \\"dishonorable\\" and included the hashtag #BlackHistoryMonth2018, implying that race was, or should have been, a factor in the selection voting process. Hamlin is a white female. Davis decided to boycott the opening ceremony. Reaction to Davis's tweet and his opting out of the opening ceremony was overwhelmingly negative—so much so that on the evening of February 9, he \\"protected\\" his Twitter profile so that only his confirmed followers could see or reply to any of his tweets.https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/winter- olympics-2018/2018/02/08/tweet-says-speedskater-shani-davis-upset-sel ection- u-s-flag-bearer-olympics/318701002/ =Retirement= He announced his retirement from skating in November 2019.

A needle was used to inject the pink dye in this example. Painted fish are ornamental aquarium fish which have been artificially coloured to appeal to consumers. This artificial colouring, also known as juicing, is achieved by a number of methods, such as injecting the fish with a hypodermic syringe containing bright fluorescent colour dye, dipping the fish into a dye solution, or feeding the fish dyed food. This controversial process is usually done to make the fish a brighter colour and more attractive to consumers. The colouring of the fish is not permanent, and usually fades away in six to nine months. Methods There are a number of methods for introducing artificial colour into fish. =Dyes= A common method of creating \\"painted fish\\" is through dye injection via syringe. Generally, fish are injected multiple times. Fish may also be dipped in a caustic solution to strip their outer slime coat, then dipped in dye. These methods are reported to have a very high mortality rate. Many varieties of \\"colour-enhancing\\" foods for aquarium fishes are available to the consumer. Generally, these foods contain natural dyes, such as beta-carotene, and are not harmful to fish, although, as with other dye methods, the effect is temporary. One source reports that harmful dyes are sometimes used by wholesalers, however. =Lasers= Fish can also be tattooed using a low- intensity laser with a dye, a process that was developed by scientists for fisheries but is now applied to ornamental fish. = Hormones = Hormone administration can sometimes increase colouration, although it can also render female fish infertile.http://www.thekrib.com/Fish/steroids.html thekrib.com =Genetic modification= Introduction of genes for fluorescent pigments, derived from corals and jellyfish, results in permanent colouration that is also passed on to offspring, without the need to inject or physically modify the fish themselves. Aquarium fish genetically modified to fluoresce in bright colours under white or ultraviolet light are now available commercially, under the trade name GloFish. The technology was originally developed to produce a fish capable of detecting environmental pollution. These zebrafish and tetras are available in several fluorescent colours, protected by a United States patent. Varieties Painted blood parrot cichlids Some species, such as albino Corydoras and \\"painted\\" glassfish, are injected with dye using a hypodermic needle. In more recent times (2004-2005), injection dyed albino Plecostomus and rift lake cichlids have also become available. Other than the Indian Glassy Fish, most dyed fish are albinos. =Some commonly painted species= *Indian Glassy Fish (Parambassis ranga).

Health hazards to painted fish A 1998 survey carried out in the South of England revealed that over 40% of painted glassfish showed signs of a Lymphocystis infection, compared to 10% of unpainted glassfish. The infection may have been caused by transmitting the virus from fish to fish via an infected needle, or by a reduced resistance to the infection due to stress from the injection process. In addition, fishes injected with dye often die without apparent external disease symptoms, presumably due to kidney disease caused by injection. Efforts to stop fish painting Some members of the aquarium trade want to ban this practice. For example, the British publication Practical Fishkeeping started a campaign in 1996 to ask retailers to stop selling dyed fish, which led to a significant decrease in the number sold in the United Kingdom. Practical Fishkeeping has launched a similar campaign with a global scope and maintains a register of stores which do not stock dyed fish. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) regards the practice as cruel and unnecessary cosmetic mutilation. A campaign in Australia and in the UK has limited the sale of these fish. Dyed fish are still available and are generally imported from Southeast Asia. In February 2006, the UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) confirmed that it would not be making it illegal to sell dyed fish in the UK under the Animal Welfare Bill.

It is played throughout the territory of the former USSR. The aim is to knock the opponent's pieces off the board. The game is named after the Russian Civil War hero, Vasily Chapayev.  Equipment  The game requires a checkerboard and checkers, eight pieces of each colour. Pieces are of small size (smaller than the squares on the board, or the game may be too easy), and usually made of wood.  Rules  The game is played in several rounds, with two players (or potentially with two teams of players alternating turns or shots during their turn). During the first round, white pieces are placed on the first row, and black on the last. White opens the game. (To neutralize the advantage, the pie rule can be used, allowing the black player to choose to switch places after the first move; this is similar to the in the pocket billiards game nine-ball.) A player takes their turn by flicking one of his pieces with the index finger to shoot it at one or more of the opponent's pieces. If the move pushes one or more of the opponent's pieces off the board while all of the shooting player's own pieces remain, the player gets an extra move. When a move fails to dislodge an opponent's piece, or the player dislodges one of the player's own pieces, the opponent's turn to move begins. The game continues until only one colour remains on the board, winning the round. Then the winner starts the next round, with that player's pieces one row further forward. When the seventh round starts, the black and white rows will be next to each other. If a piece is flipped upside-down after an impact, it is called a traitor and the opponent gets control of it. For the seventh and subsequent rounds, not only does a successful shooter move forward one row, but the loser is forced to move backwards. When one of the players reaches the final row, the opponent has no place left for their pieces and therefore loses the game. Variations The rules of Chapayev differ from region to region. In some variations, an allowed move is to put the thumb and index finger on two pieces of one's own colour and quickly move them together towards centre, pushing an opponent's piece toward the middle off of the board – sometimes called a \\"scissors\\" move. In another variant, the game is not finished when one player's remaining pieces have retreated to the back row and one of the opponent's pieces has reached that row: The next step is adding a second checker atop the piece of the advancing side (the figure is called a horse or tank; this is similar to being \\"crowned\\" in Western draughts/checkers). The game continues until one player's pieces are all eliminated. Computer versions Several variants of chapayev have been created as computer simulations. Implementations include Chapay (dating to 1999) at Pyva.net; Chapayev 3D (') from Narod.ru; Shuffle, Shuffle Challenge, and Shuffle Snakebites by WildSnake Software and Shockwave.com; the Battle Checkers and Chapayev iOS games at Apple's iTunes Store; and Chapayev for Android on the Google App Market (now Google Play; this game typically requires a checkers board and 8 to 16 Android devices).

This is a distance of . Route description Illinois Route 4 starts at Illinois 13 and Illinois 127 at a point about north of Murphysboro. It zigzags through small southern towns such as Steeleville, Sparta, and Marissa, before straightening out near Mascoutah. IL Route 4 is an important road in St. Clair and Madison counties as it connects many suburbs and exurbs on the eastern edge of St. Louis, including Mascoutah, Lebanon, Troy, Highland, Edwardsville, Hamel, Staunton, Benld, and Gillespie. From Carlinville northwards the route is important since it connects many medium- sized rural towns and bedroom communities in Macoupin and Sangamon counties, such as Girard, Virden, Auburn, and Chatham, with Springfield. The road passes directly through Chatham, a fast-growing city that has transformed into a southern suburb and bedroom community for Springfield, which directly abuts the north edge of Chatham. Within the City of Springfield, IL Route 4 is known as Veterans Parkway. It completes the western loop around the city, and is a divided four-lane highway that serves the major commercial area centered around the intersection of Veterans Parkway and Wabash Avenue, which includes White Oaks Mall. It is also worth noting that the northbound lane of IL 4 is in Washington County for less than , on its southwest corner near the unincorporated town of Clarmin where it runs concurrently with IL 13. History Illinois State Bond Issue Route 4 was the first numbered through route between Chicago and St. Louis, as shown on the 1924 Illinois Road Map. As such it was the forerunner of more famous routes US 66 and Interstate 55. In 1926, a new alignment for Route 4 was opened between Joliet and Lyons, on the north side of the Des Plaines River. The old alignment on the east and south sides of the curving river through Lemont was renamed Illinois Route 4A and then renamed again in 1967 as Illinois Route 171. Illinois Route 4A generally followed Archer Avenue from the Chicago city limits to Lemont. When U.S. Route 66 was first designated in 1926, it coincided with IL 4 for its entire length; however, the earliest state map in 1927 erroneously showed Route 66 coinciding with IL 4A through the near Chicago suburbs instead of IL 4. Also, the section of IL 4 from just south of Staunton to Springfield was originally shown only as \\"Temporary U.S. Route 66,\\" whereas the permanent routing of Route 66 was shown as proposed or under construction on a more eastern route, away from IL 4 through Litchfield. The new path of U.S. Route 66 was completed as SBI 16 and SBI 126 in 1930, and the Route 66 designation was then removed from IL 4 between Staunton and Springfield. Illinois Route 4 and U.S. Route 66 remained as coincident, co-signed routes between the Mississippi River and Staunton and between Springfield and Chicago until 1935, when the IL 4 designation was dropped from portions where it overlapped with Route 66, leaving only the portion from Staunton to Springfield as IL 4. This left IL 4A as an orphan alternate route of IL 4 from Lyons to Joliet, until it was renumbered as IL 171 in 1967. The section of modern IL 4 from Staunton to its southern end near Murphysboro was originally IL 43. In 1964, IL 4 was extended on this highway, and the number IL 43 was eventually reused in the Chicago metro area to mark parts of Waukegan Road and Harlem Avenue. Historical designation A bypassed portion of old route 4 north of Auburn is listed in the National Register of Historic Places as \\"Illinois Route 4-North of Auburn\\". It was added in 1998 as structure #98000979 and consists of two c.1920 bridges over Little Panther Creek and portions of Curran and Snell roads.

It is the opposite of disinflation, which seeks to return the economy back down to the long-term trend. Reflation, which can be considered a form of inflation (increase in the price level), is contrasted with inflation (narrowly speaking) in that \\"bad\\" inflation is inflation above the long-term trend line, while reflation is a recovery of the price level when it has fallen below the trend line. For example, if inflation had been running at a 3% rate, but for one year it falls to 0%, the following year would need 6% inflation (actually 6.09% due to compounding) to catch back up to the long-term trend. This higher than normal inflation is considered reflation, since it is a return to trend, not exceeding the long-term trend. This distinction is predicated on a theory of economic growth where there is long-term growth in the economy and price level, which is widely accepted in economics. Just as disinflation is considered an acceptable antidote to high inflation, reflation is considered to be an antidote to deflation (which, unlike inflation, is considered bad regardless of its magnitude).

As the parade commander and his second in command approach the grandstand in their vehicles, the two officers, together with their adjutants, salute on the eyes right. They are followed by the infantry battalions, and followed on by a double past of parachute special forces personnel, which had jumped from an Air Force transport plane into the parade ground during the march past, and then by the mobile column and fly past of Air Force fighter and trainer aircraft as well as helicopters. = Order of parade march past in quick time = * Massed colour guard regiment of formation colours of the armed forces (three battalions) * Veterans of the Liberation War * 1st Battalion, President Guard Regiment * Battalion from the Armoured Corps * Regiment from the Infantry Corps ** Battalion from the East Bengal Regiment ** Battlaion from the Bangladesh Infantry Regiment * Bangladesh Regiment of Artillery * Bangladesh Corps of Engineers * Bangladesh Signals Corps * National Standards colour guard * Composite battalion of army service support branches * Para-Commando Brigade Battalion * Battalion of army servicewomen * Navy * Air Force * Bangladesh National Cadet Corps * Border Guard Bangladesh * Bangladesh Police * Bangladesh Ansar * Bangladesh Jail * Battalion of female Police and Ansar servicewomen * Infantry battalion wearing modern combat equipment and rifles * Army K-9 company and Army and Police combined mounted squadron Events commemorating Victory Day *1971: State Bank of Pakistan became Bangladesh Bank. *1972: The constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh was enacted on December 16. *1973: Gallantry awards of war were declared by Bangladesh Gazette on 15 December. *1996: Silver jubilee of victory was celebrated. *2013: New world record of the largest human flag was set when 27,117 volunteers gathered at the National Parade Ground holding red and green blocks to form the national flag of Bangladesh.

In various East-Central and Eastern European countries, kasha can apply to any kind of cooked grain. It can be baked but most often is boiled, either in water or milk, and therefore the term coincides with the English definition of porridge, but the word can also refer to the grain before preparation, which corresponds to the definition of groats. This understanding of kasha concerns mainly Belarus (каша), Czechia (kaše), Lithuania (košė), Poland (kasza), Russia (каша), Slovakia (kaša) and Ukraine (каша), where the term, besides buckwheat, can apply to wheat, barley, oats, millet and rye.

The most popular kasha recipe in Russia is that of crumbly cooked buckwheat seasoned with butter. Buckwheat kasha can be eaten at any time of the day, either as a separate dish or as a side dish. Other popular kasha recipes are made with millet, semolina (манная каша) and oatmeal. Cooked with milk and sugar, they are often seen as a breakfast staple, especially for children. Pearl barley porridge is less popular but also eaten. Kasha is one of the Russian national dishes, together with shchi. This fact is commemorated in the Russian saying, \\"щи да кашапища наша\\" (shchi da kashapishcha nasha), which literally translates as \\"shchi and kasha are our food\\" or \\"cabbage soup and porridge are what we eat\\". The expression has an implied figurative meaning of \\"it is enough to eat that two meals to live\\" or \\"it doesn't matter what happens in Russia at large, we still live the same way.\\" Butter is often eaten with most kasha recipes, hence another Russian saying: \\"you'll never spoil kasha with a lot of butter\\".Nourish Your Language: Foodie Words Refashioned In Poland J.P.

A listed building is one considered to be of special architectural, historical or cultural significance, which is protected from being demolished, extended or altered, unless special permission is granted by the relevant planning authorities. Of these buildings, 27 are classified as Grade I (buildings of outstanding architectural or historic interest) and 85 are classified as Grade II* (particularly significant buildings of more than local interest). The remainder are classified as Grade II. The city has been described by English Heritage as England's finest Victorian City. The wide range and depth of architectural styles represented in Liverpool has been recognised by UNESCO, with six areas throughout the city centre being designated as a World Heritage Site in 2004. The areas, collectively known as the Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City were added in recognition of the city's role in the development of International trade and docking technology. Due to the way in which buildings are listed by English Heritage and due to the large number of buildings within the city, they have been subdivided in Grade I, II* and II buildings lists, with the Grade II buildings being further split up by postcode. __TOC__ Listed buildings in the United Kingdom Within the United Kingdom, a listed building is a building or structure that is of special architectural, historical or cultural significance. Listed building status is used widely in the country to protect historic sites and has been applied to around half a million buildings. A listed building may not be demolished, extended or altered without special permission from the local planning authority (who typically consult the relevant central government agency, particularly for significant alterations to the more notable listed buildings). Although most structures appearing on the lists are buildings, other structures such as bridges, monuments, sculptures, war memorials, and even milestones and mileposts may also be listed. Ancient, military and uninhabited structures (such as Stonehenge) are sometimes instead classified as scheduled monuments and protected by much older legislation whilst cultural landscapes such as parks and gardens are currently \\"listed\\" on a non-statutory basis. Architecture of Liverpool Liverpool has a wide variety of architectural styles represented within the city, dating from as far back as the 13th century, right up to modern contemporary styles.Hughes (1999), p11 Much of the urban fabric of Liverpool that exists today dates from the last 200 years, the period during which the city developed into a major port city within the United Kingdom.Hughes (1999), p10 There are over 2,500 listed buildings in Liverpool (of which 27 are Grade I listed and 85 are Grade II* listed). The city also has a greater number of public sculptures than any other location in the United Kingdom aside from Westminster and more Georgian houses than the city of Bath. This richness of architecture has subsequently seen Liverpool described by English Heritage, as England's finest Victorian city. The value of Liverpool's architecture and design was recognised in 2004, when several areas throughout the city were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The original design The original TPC was invented by David R. Nygren, an American physicist, at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in the late 1970s. Its first major application was in the PEP-4 detector, which studied 29 GeV electron–positron collisions at the PEP storage ring at SLAC. A time projection chamber consists of a gas-filled detection volume in an electric field with a position-sensitive electron collection system. The original design (and the one most commonly used) is a cylindrical chamber with multi- wire proportional chambers (MWPC) as endplates. Along its length, the chamber is divided into halves by means of a central high-voltage electrode disc, which establishes an electric field between the center and the end plates. Furthermore, a magnetic field is often applied along the length of the cylinder, parallel to the electric field, in order to minimize the diffusion of the electrons coming from the ionization of the gas. On passing through the detector gas, a particle will produce primary ionization along its track. The z coordinate (along the cylinder axis) is determined by measuring the drift time from the ionization event to the MWPC at the end. This is done using the usual technique of a drift chamber. The MWPC at the end is arranged with the anode wires in the azimuthal direction, θ, which provides information on the radial coordinate, r. To obtain the azimuthal direction, each cathode plane is divided into strips along the radial direction. In recent years other means of position-sensitive electron amplification and detection have become more widely used, especially in conjunction with the increased application of time projection chambers in nuclear physics. These usually combine a segmented anode plate with either just a Frisch gridDemonchy et al. 2007. or an active electron-multiplication element like a gas electron multiplier.Fenker et al. 2008, Laird et al. 2007. These newer TPCs also depart from the traditional geometry of a cylinder with an axial field in favour of a flat geometry or a cylinder with a radial field. Earlier researchers in particle physics also usually made use of a more simplified box-shaped geometry arranged directly above or below the beam line, such as in the CERN NA49 and NA35 experiments. The Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) In 1977, Carlo Rubbia devised a liquid-argon time projection chamber, or LArTPC.Rubbia, C. 1977. The LArTPC operates under many of the same principles as Nygren's initial TPC design, but uses liquid argon as a sensitive medium instead of gas. =Detector design and properties= Liquid argon is advantageous as a sensitive medium for several reasons.Acciarri et al. 2015. The fact that argon is a noble element and therefore has a vanishing electronegativity means that electrons produced by ionizing radiation will not be absorbed as they drift toward the detector readout. Argon also scintillates when an energetic charged particle passes by, releasing a number of scintillation photons that is proportional to the energy deposited in the argon by the passing particle. Liquid argon is also relatively inexpensive, making large-scale projects economically feasible. However, one of the primary motivations for using liquid argon as a sensitive medium is its density. Liquid argon is around one thousand times denser than the gas used in Nygren's TPC design, which increases the likelihood of a particle interacting in a detector by a factor of around one thousand. This feature is particularly useful in neutrino physics, where neutrino–nucleon interaction cross sections are small. A diagram of LArTPC design and basic operating principles The body of a typical LArTPC is formed of three parts. On one side of the detector is a high-voltage cathode plane, used to establish a drift electric field across the TPC. Although the exact electric potential at which this is set is dependent on the detector geometry, this high-voltage cathode typically produces a drift field of 500 V/cm across the detector. On the side opposite of the cathode plane is a set of anode wire planes set at potentials much higher (less negative) than that of the cathode. Each plane is separated from its neighbors by a small gap, usually on the order of 1 cm. A plane consists of many parallel conducting wires spaced by a few millimeters, and the angle at which the wires are oriented relative to the vertical varies from plane to plane. Together, these planes read out signals from the drift electrons. For a detector with N anode wire planes, the inner N − 1 planes are called induction planes. These are set at lower (more negative) potentials than the outer plane, allowing drift electrons to pass through them, inducing signals that are used for event reconstruction. The outer plane is called the collection plane because the drift electrons are collected on these wires, producing additional signals. Having multiple planes with different wire orientations permits two- dimensional event reconstruction, while the third dimension is found from electron drift times. The third part is a field cage between the cathode and anode. This field cage maintains a uniform electric field between the cathode and the anode, so that drift electron trajectories deviate as little as possible from the shortest path between the point of ionization and the anode plane. This is intended to prevent distortion of particle trajectory during event reconstruction. A light-collection system often accompanies the basic LArTPC as a means of extracting more information from an event by scintillation light. It can also play an important role in triggering, because it collects scintillation light only nanoseconds after the particle passes through the detector. This is comparatively (on the order of 1000 times) shorter than the time taken by the freed electrons to drift to the wire planes, so it is often sufficient to demarcate the collection time of scintillation photons as a trigger time (t0) for an event. With this trigger time, one can then find electron drift times, which enables three-dimensional reconstruction of an event. While such systems are not the only means by which a LArTPC can identify a trigger time, they are necessary for studying phenomena like supernovae and proton decay, where the particles undergoing decay or interaction are not produced in a human-made accelerator and the timing of a beam of particles is therefore not known. Photomultiplier tubes, light guides, and silicon photomultipliers are examples of instruments used to collect this light. These are typically positioned just outside the drift volume. =Signal readout= In a typical LArTPC, each wire in each anode plane is part of an RC circuit, with the wire itself located between the resistor and capacitor. The other end of the resistor is wired to a bias voltage, and the other end of the capacitor is wired to the front-end electronics. The front-end electronics amplify and digitize the current in the circuit. This amplified and digitized current as a function of time is the \\"signal\\" that is passed to the event reconstruction. For a given anode plane wire, the signal produced will have a specific form that depends on whether the wire is located in an induction plane or in a collection plane. As a drift electron moves toward a wire in an induction plane, it induces a current in the wire, producing a \\"bump\\" in output current. As the electron moves away from a wire, it induces a current in the opposite direction, producing an output \\"bump\\" of the opposite sign as the first. The result is a bipolar signal.Joshi, J., Qian, X., 2015. In contrast, signals for a collection plane wire are unipolar, since electrons do not pass by the wire but are instead \\"collected\\" by it. For both of these geometries, a larger signal amplitude implies that more drift electrons either passed by the wire (for induction planes) or were collected by it (for the collection plane). The signal readout of all of the wires in a given anode plane can be organized into a 2D picture of a particle interaction. Such a picture is a projection of the 3D particle interaction onto a 2D plane whose normal vector is parallel to the wires in the specified anode plane. The 2D projections corresponding to each of the anode planes are combined to fully reconstruct the 3D interaction. Dual- phase TPC The technique itself was first developed for radiation detection using argon in the early 1970s. The ZEPLIN programme pioneered the use of two- phase technology for WIMP searches. The XENON and LUX series of detectors represent the state-of the art implementation of this instrument in Physics.

The nearest major north-south highway, Interstate 39, runs parallel to Illinois 29, but approximately fifty miles to the east. Illinois 29 is long.  Route description  Northern terminus of IL 29 at US 6 and IL 89 Illinois 29 runs near the right bank (going down stream) which is (north and west) of the Illinois River from Spring Valley to Peoria. Starting at U.S. 6/Illinois 89 at the north edge of Spring Valley, the road passes through the small towns of Putnam and Henry, intersecting Illinois Route 18 at Henry. In Sparland, Illinois 29 intersects Illinois Route 17. It then runs beneath the bluff at Hopewell before becoming 4th Street, the main north-south artery through Chillicothe. From the north end of Illinois Route 6 at Mossville south through Peoria and Peoria Heights, Route 29 is named Galena Road until it crosses U.S. Route 150 at the McClugage Bridge; from there the road is named Adams Street. In downtown Peoria, 29 splits from Adams Street onto Interstate 74 on the Murray Baker Bridge, where it crosses the Illinois River to East Peoria. In East Peoria, Route 29 splits from Interstate 74 and proceeds south, entering Creve Coeur on Main Street and providing an interchange with Interstate 474. It enters Pekin as 8th Street and forks off as 5th Street before a short concurrency with Illinois Route 9 near the Pekin Bridge. Splitting onto 2nd Street (southbound) and 3rd Street (northbound) before crossing the bridge, Route 29 exits Pekin as 2nd Street, passing the Federal Correctional Institution, Pekin, and from there goes substantially directly south through Mason City to Springfield. IL 29 in Peoria just north of the McClugage Bridge Route 29 enters Springfield at the Abraham Lincoln Capital Airport, and runs around the north and east sides of the city. After leaving Springfield at an interchange with Interstate 55/Interstate 72/U.S. Route 36, Route 29 runs southeast through Taylorville, passing the end of Illinois Route 104 and crossing Illinois Route 48, then ending at U.S. Route 51/Illinois Route 16 in Pana.  History  Route 29 was established in 1918, and ran from DePue to Peoria. It was extended twice over Illinois Route 24 in 1936 and 1940, and in 1942 replaced an old alignment of U.S. Route 6 from Bureau Junction to Spring Valley. The routing of Route 29 through Peoria was changed in 2012. That same year, U.S. Route 24 was rerouted over the river along a more southwestern alignment. 29 was relocated from the Cedar Street Bridge to the Murray Baker Bridge, which carries Interstate 74.  Future  Illinois' Rte. 29 has long been slated as one of the roads to be upgraded as part of a Peoria-to-Chicago Highway. While there are no longer funded plans to build the expressway, there are plans to attempt to reduce congestion on Illinois 29 by widening it from a narrow two-lane highway to a four-lane divided highway. In September 2001, the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) began the Illinois 29 Study to determine feasible upgrade paths for this corridor. The Illinois 29 Study covers Route 29 from Interstate 180 across the Illinois River from Hennepin, south to Illinois Route 6 at Mossville. Along most of this stretch, the road is a striped, two lane (one northbound, one southbound) highway. In Chillicothe, the speed limit is reduced to 35 mph (56 km/h), though there are now four lanes (two northbound, two southbound). Truck traffic is relatively heavy along this stretch, owing to various industrial factories located in the towns. = Proposed solutions = IDOT is considering a western bypass of Henry, Sparland, Hopewell, and Chillicothe. It is referred to as the \\"Bluff Alternate\\" because the highway would be relocated (south of Putnam) onto a bluff overlooking the Illinois River. Another alternate still under consideration is to merely upgrade the roads through Hopewell and Sparland to a divided four-lane highway. Some other considerations have already been withdrawn, including an eastern bypass of Putnam. All solutions result in the lengthening of Illinois Route 6 to meet the new Illinois 29 just north of Peoria.

The Underwater Demolition Badge was established as a decoration for members of Navy Underwater Demolition Teams (UDTs) and is considered a predecessor decoration to the modern day Special Warfare Badge. The Underwater Demolition Badge was originally worn as a patch on the upper sleeve of a Navy uniform. The badge was awarded to the members of the U.S. Navy Underwater Demolition Teams and became a breast badge in the 1950s. As Underwater Demolition Teams began to be phased into the Navy SEALs, the Underwater Demolition Badge was used as a template for the new SEAL Badge. During the Vietnam War, the Underwater Demolition Badge was issued side by side with the Special Warfare Badge (SEAL Badge). By 1975, the Underwater Demolition Badge had been declared obsolete and was no longer issued for uniform wear. Service members who had previously held the Underwater Demolition Badge could apply for the award of the SEAL Badge in lieu of the obsolete decoration. The Underwater Demolition Badge appears as a crossed anchor, trident and pistol insignia. The decoration is identical to the Special Warfare Badge with the exception of the eagle upon which the SEAL badge is based. In 2006 the Navy created the Special Warfare Operator rating, which consists entirely of SEALs.

The south east side of the larger 10×13 km caldera contains a caldera lake. The inner 7.5-kilometer-wide caldera, which was formed during emplacement of the Bali (or Ubud) ignimbrite, has been dated at about 23,670 and 28,500 years ago. The first documented eruption was in 1804 and the most recent was in 2000. Active volcano and Lake Batur in the caldera The eruption that brought this volcano to be visible above the ocean is one of the most forceful across the earth. This volcano is marked by a collapsed top, called a caldera. The southeast wall of the inner caldera lies beneath Lake Batur; Batur cone has been constructed within the inner caldera to a height above the outer caldera rim. The Batur stratovolcano has produced vents over much of the inner caldera, but a NE-SW fissure system has localized the Batur I, II, and III craters along the summit ridge. Historical eruptions have been characterized by mild-to-moderate explosive activity sometimes accompanied by lava emission. Basaltic lava flows from both summit and flank vents have reached the caldera floor and the shores of Lake Batur over its history. The caldera contains an active, 700-metre-tall stratovolcano rising above the surface of Lake Batur. The first documented eruption of Batur was in 1804, and it has been frequently active since then, most recently in 2000. The substantial lava field from the 1968 eruption is visible today when viewed from Kintamani, a town on the southwest ridge of the caldera. Villages in the caldera The caldera is populated and includes the four main villages of Kedisan, Songan, Trunyan and Toya Bungkah, among a total of 15 villages. The locals largely rely on agriculture for income but tourism has become increasingly popular due to the relatively straightforward trek to the summit of the central crater. Global Geoparks Network On 20 September 2012 UNESCO made Mount Batur Caldera a part of the Global Geoparks Network. Sedimentation Heavy sedimentation in Mount Batur Caldera decreases the water in the lake. A plan was devised to restrict locations around the lake for tourist accommodations, to inform residents of the problems of fish farm cages in the lake, and perhaps to dredge some of the natural sedimentation from volcanic ash. The lake is subject to water pollution from fishing and agricultural run off, promoting the growth of too many water hyacinths, further worsening conditions in the lake, causing some to wonder if the lake will disappear between heavy sedimentation at the bottom and a dense cover of water hyacinths.

Gjøco's total sales were approximately (about $25 million) in 2004. Agriculture is also an important industry for the area. Torvikbukt has several small- and medium- sized farms, which makes a big impact at the villages surroundings and way of living. More recently, many farms have been abandoned, mainly because of the lack of relatives that will continue the production after their retirement of the farmer. Agriculture at Western Norway can be very inefficient because of the alpine landscape, and it makes the business not very profitable. =Tourism= Torvikbukt's typical Norwegian surroundings of fjords and mountains makes it an excellent starting point for mountain hiking, fishing, and boat-safari.

Reinsfjellet is a mountain with a very good view and is frequently hiked by tourists. Education Torvikbukt has its own elementary school which includes students in first through seventh grades. This is a private school called Torvikbukt Skule. The school has approximately 30 pupils. The school was founded in 2009 as an alternative, after the public school Torvik Skole (government founded) was closed down because of a lack of funds in the budget of the Gjemnes municipality.

Constructed in the second-half of the 18th-Century, the Church of Nossa Senhora da Saúde, incorporated the older chapel of the same name, originally initiated by D. Margarida Bettencourt da Câmara in her last will and testament on 12 July 1627. In 1764 and 1765 it was subject to remodelling that expanded the structure to the current dimensions. Designed in the Baroque-style of the post-modern period, this structure consists of a single tower and white-facade typical of Azorean churches, while the interior altar and sacristy have ornate gold-leaf cornices and niches. In the area of Piedade, another chapel was constructed in the name of Nossa Senhora da Piedade, and ordered constructed by João Dias Caridade at the beginning of the 16th-Century, and subject to major renovations in 1791. Further, the Church of Nossa Senhora dos Milgares, constructed after 1816, by the community and completed in 1831. It was this church that was responsible for elevating the community to the status of parish on 3 April 1959. Romarias and associated festivals are celebrated from this church on the first Sunday after 15 August. Geography Sete Cidades It is situated northeast of the urbanized core of Ponta Delgada and constituted from three main localities: Piedade, Saúde and Milagres. Also, it extends from these communities toward the north-northeast until Serra Gorda, making it the largest parish in the municipality, and one of the largest on the island. Other localities are Arribanas, Castanheira, Grotinha, Nordela and Recantos. Landlocked, Arrifes is surrounded by Capelas to the north, São Jose (Ponta Delgada) to the south, São Sebastião and Fajã de Cima to the east, and fronts the parish of Relva and Covoada to the west. Economy Its extensive size allows the support of dairy-cattle; in fact, Arrifes is the largest milk-producing region of the Azores, and home of the islands main dairy factories, responsible for supporting most of the island's demand, as well as export requirements. Architecture * Church of Nossa Senhora da Piedade (), based on a 15th-century, later remodelled in the 20th century comprising a single nave and belltower, illuminated by a uniform series of windows along the lateral wings. The principal facade is decorated by a curvilinear pediment and oculus, the two-story belltower, decorated in cornices and balustrades, similar to the parochial Church of Candelária and Church of Ginetes; * Church of Nossa Senhora da Saude (), a 17th-century chapel transformed into church, comprising single nave, prebystery, annexes and belltower on its left, illuminated intensely by rectangular lateral windows.

Overview The platform level of the station, in 1984 It is located in eastern Kreuzberg, near Oberbaumbrücke, in the Bohemian quarter commonly known as SO36 (named after its former postal code). The station is named after one of the former city gates of Berlin built in the early 18th century; the road that ran through it led southeastward to the province of Silesia. The exceptionally richly designed station opened on 18 February 1902, on the first Berlin U-Bahn line erected by the Siemens & Halske company (the Stammstrecke). On 11/12 March 1945, this station was directly hit, and the track area was severely damaged. During the division of Berlin after 13 August 1961, the station was the eastern terminus of the U1, as the final station, Warschauer Straße, was in East Berlin. The link was reopened in 1995. An intermediate station at the Spree river, Stralauer Tor, had been destroyed in 1945 and never reopened. Schlesisches Tor was an atmospheric location in the 1966 espionage film The Quiller Memorandum starring George Segal and Alec Guinness.

Accreditations and recognitions *Sponsored by the Summer Institute of Linguistics *Accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, USA. *Recognised by the Department of Education, Papua New Guinea. *Established examining centre for University of London, UK. *Pre-school ulkomaankoulu, Finland *The Papua New Guinea National Department of Education approves the school for instruction *through the School Certificate (Year 10). History Throughout the history of the school there has been an emphasis on preparing students for re-entry to their home country education systems. This has led to a steady broadening of the curriculum and the inclusion of Mother Tongue Studies when needed and staffing permitted. In 1962 the High School began with five pupils, from Canada and the USA, and three teachers. The students did correspondence lessons from Blackfriars in NSW Australia. The building was a 10 foot by 12 foot bamboo walled building situated on the \\"Circle' near Lovings and Vincents houses. In 1963 the first permanent building was built on the present site of the school and the pupils grew in number to 13, some came from Kainantu and Aiyura. The original school building was used as a place to store sports equipment for a number of years. In 1996 the primary and secondary campuses were incorporated into one school to facilitate a K- 12 curriculum under the common name of Ukarumpa International School. Ukarumpa International School has served a student body of approximately 175 in Kindergarten through grade 6 and approximately 180 in 7-12. However, student and staff population fluctuates with the coming and going of missionaries each year. In 2010, the school yearbook, The Silhouette, recorded a population of 258 students and 77 staff. Approximately 80% of the students are children of members or area mission groups. There are 15 nationalities represented in the school with the majority being students from North America. In 1997 a Finnish School (Ukarumpan Suomalainen Ulkomaankoulu, USKO) was established with 11 students. In July 2003 the primary campus was relocated into the centre, away from the Aiyura airport. In 2017, the sixth grade was relocated from the primary campus to the secondary campus. Teachers The 50+ teachers come from many countries. They allow home schooling families at Ukarumpa and allow them to participate in school programs along with their peers. Primary school In July 2003, the primary campus (Grades 1-6) moved to their new campus on the Centre from the old campus about 3 kilometers away. Facilities on the campus include eight classrooms, three double classrooms, a computer lab, art room, assembly hall, library and six classrooms for Mother Tongue Studies. The large playground has two fields and a large outside basketball court. Covered walkways allow students and staff to traverse the campus in the rain without getting wet. Originally the kindergarten and the preschool for 3-year-olds (Pukpuks) and 4-year-olds (Kapuls) were located on a separate campus. However, in June 2004 the kindergarten moved to the new primary campus. Then in July 2008 the preschool moved to the new campus. Secondary school The campus consists of eight utility classrooms, two social studies rooms, five small MTS/Language study rooms; two computer rooms; three science classroom/laboratories; one room each for home economics, shop, art and audio visuals (seating about 90); library and music block consisting of rehearsal room, practice rooms, offices and workshop. Other facilities include a teachers’ lounge/kitchen area, workroom for teachers, offices (main and other offices), storerooms, MTS library, maintenance workshop, and a lounge for the senior class. Sports facilities The campus has a sports oval (used for soccer, softball, track and field, touch rugby, frisbee, etc.), a basketball court, volleyball court and a foursquare court. The school has access to tennis courts and an indoor basketball court close by. One of the more prominent sports activities includes sports day where the school is divided up into two teams, Alpha and Beta, who compete against each other in a variety of track and field activities. Alpha has won the past five years (2015-2019). Sports day 2020 was cancelled due to the impact of the COVID-19 virus. Student resources Computers with internet access are available in the computer labs and the library. Textbooks are provided for students and are obtained mainly from the United States and Australia.
