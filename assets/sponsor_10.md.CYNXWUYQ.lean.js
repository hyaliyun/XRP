About  The AYSB and AWO are both community concert bands based in Auckland, New Zealand. The AYSB primarily consists of members from year 7 (age 12) to university age, while members of the AWO are typically of university age to adults. Instruments in both groups include: piccolo, flute, oboe, clarinet (including bass clarinet), bassoon, saxophone, French horn, trumpet, trombone, euphonium, tuba, orchestral percussion and drum kit. Repertoire and Performances Both bands play a variety of music, including classical transcriptions, folk tunes, film music, musicals, dance accompaniments and dances, and original compositions. There is a focus, however, on dedicated Concert Band repertoire. This has changed somewhat from the band's early days of primarily light music and marches. Both bands typically play in concerts in Auckland as standalone performances, however do often combine. Occasionally, they have performed as a part of a larger event. History The Auckland Youth Symphonic Band was established in 1967 by Hugh Dixon, as an opportunity for amateur woodwind and brass musicians to perform in a group after dissatisfaction with orchestral parts. In 1970, the Band was renamed from the Auckland Junior Symphonic Band (AJSB) to the Auckland Youth Symphonic Band (AYSB) and in 1971, became an Incorporated society. The Junior Division was formed in 1973 after the number of players reached 86. This was called the Junior Division (as opposed to the Senior Division) of the AYSB. In 1974, an ensemble consisting of flute and clarinet players was formed, under the direction of Tony Webster. This was disbanded in 1975. In 1980 the Senior Division toured Singapore, and in 1986 the Junior Division toured Fiji. In 1988, the Junior Division played in Brisbane, for the 1988 World Expo. In 1998, the AYSB travelled to Australia to perform in the 21st Manly International Jazz Festival. In 1999, the Senior Division of the AYSB was renamed to the Auckland Wind Orchestra.

It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Idavine, a residence at 2 Burnett Street, West Ipswich, is a timber house for which existing evidence indicates a construction date during the Federation Period. The allotment on which this residence is situated was first alienated in 1855 as allotment 100, parish of Ipswich, county Stanley ({{convert1rood32.5sqperch), by Henry Mort at a cost of . Mort was a pastoralist and company director as well as a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council between 1881 and 1900. The allotment appears to have remained unoccupied during the 11 years of Mort's ownership. In August 1866, the title to allotment 100 was transferred to William Berry, an Ipswich district farmer. Although extant records indicate Berry was a farmer by occupation, it is known that he was also a land owner and was referred to in his death documents as a freeholder. Between 1852 and 1854 he purchased three town lots in Cleveland, Brisbane, and in 1855 was the owner of the property, adjacent to 2 Burnett Street, at 1 Burnett Street (allotment 101). Berry resided in a modest timber cottage at 1 Burnett Street until when he built a brick house and Ipswich Municipal Council Valuation Registers indicate he utilized allotment 100 (2 Burnett Street) as his garden. By 1870, Berry had also acquired Lots 98 and 99 next to 2 Burnett Street, and the area became generally known as Berry's Hill. Despite Berry's real estate interests in Burnett Street, allotment 100 remained unimproved during his ownership. In 1886 title to the land was transferred to August Knopke and it appears that Knopke erected a timber house on the property -88 as his residence, as indicated in the Ipswich Municipal Council Valuation Register for 1888. No documentary evidence exists to definitively date the residence which is now located at 2 Burnett Street, however the overall form of the house, ascertained through site inspection, suggests it was built in the Federation period, possibly after the turn of the century. It is unlikely that the current house was constructed by August Knopke and the link between the name \\"Idavine\\" and its owner in 1913, Ida Retschlag (n√©e Boettcher), may be significant. Retschlag remained as the registered owner of the property until 1918 when it passed into the hands of Sophia Helena Lewis, daughter of Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Runge & Wilhelmine Charlotte Runge. The property remained in the Lewis-Runge family for the next 60 years and it was reputedly during this period that the house was at one-time used as flats. It is significant to note that following the establishment of an immigration incentive scheme in Germany during the late 19th century, German emigrants formed close communities in many Queensland towns and the association of this house with German owners from 1886 onwards is symptomatic of their influential presence in the Ipswich area. Since the mid-1970s the property has passed between several owners and remains a well-preserved example of the architectural style of its era.  Description  House viewed from across street, 2015 Idavine is located on a compact lot facing Burnett Street to its north-east. It sits atop a hill approximately from the Ipswich town center. The house is situated approximately from the front fence line at its narrowest point and at its widest. The eastern face of the building is approximately from the side boundary, and the western face is approximately from the boundary at the narrowest point. The front verandah provides the visitor with an uninterrupted vista along Limestone Street, the approach route from the town centre. The house is timber-framed and externally clad on its exposed faces in chamferboards. All its original timber stumps have been replaced with concrete ones. While the timber floor framing appeared to be in good condition, it was noted that a number of steel bearers had been introduced. Painted timber battens screen the gaps between each exterior concrete stump. The building has two gable projections on the front facade. The smaller of the two sits above the verandah, while the other incorporates a triple window. The main roof is short-ridged and slopes continuously to the edge of the verandah. Where the kitchen abuts the dining room, the main roof is joined to another short-ridged roof sloping at right angles to it. The entire roof is of corrugated galvanized iron with recently installed vents in each ridge. The bargeboards to the verandah gable are shaped and rounded at each end, with a star pattern cut out from the resulting panel of timber. The triangular gable infill is made of decorated timber. A similarly ornate infill panel adorns the other larger gable. It projects approximately from the wall below and is supported by carved timber brackets. A double set is located either side of the triple window below. A finial projects from the gable's ridge. Entry to the verandah is gained via stairs at right angles to the gable projection and through a set of double lattice doors. Its open edge is decorated with tapering, chamfered timber posts. Between each post is an arched frieze panel in-filled with timber battens and divided by a carved timber drop. The ends of the arched friezes rest on timber capitals. The open edge is also decorated with cast iron baluster panels and balusters beneath a timber handrail. The panels display a cornucopia design motif featuring two horns, one filled with fruit and the other with vegetables. Below the symmetrically curved horns are bunches of wheat and another plant. Located centrally at the bottom of the panel, where the ends of each bunch cross, is a horseshoe. The balustrading pattern matches one registered in Victoria on 7 April 1892 by J Cochrane & G Scott. The combined effect of the cast iron balustrading and the decorative timberwork to the verandah is to give the house a strong street presence. This is despite the fact that these elements are hidden somewhat by foliage. The cast iron balustrading and handrail continues for almost the entire length of the eastern face of the house; however part of the verandah is enclosed with windows. The framing is exposed on the exterior face of the building adjoining the verandah. This wall is single skin, vertically-jointed tongue and groove boarding. Exposed framing is found elsewhere facing the kitchen and sleep-out areas. A tripartite, double-hung sash window opens from the verandah into the current living room. A casement window opens between the sleep-out and verandah. The front door, consisting of one side panel and a pivoting glass fanlight, also opens off the verandah. Next to the front door is fixed a timber plaque on which the name \\"Idavine\\" is painted in gold. It was in place when the current owners took possession of the property in 2001. The front door opens onto a hall with an approximately high ceiling. The ceilings in all rooms, except the kitchen, laundry and sleep-out (enclosed verandah), are this height. The hall is divided in two by an arched doorway, on either side of which are fixed glass panels. The walls are lined with vertically-jointed tongue and groove boarding, as are all other walls in the house. In the hall are located the only skirting boards to be found in the house. The floor is polished timber boarding, as are all others excluding those in the bathroom, ensuite, kitchen and laundry. The ceilings in both segments of the hallway are pressed metal, as are the cornices. There are further pressed metal ceilings in the living room, kitchen and main bedroom. All other ceilings, excluding those in the sleep-out and verandah, which are sheeted, are lined with vertically-jointed tongue and groove boarding. Six rooms open off the hallway, two to the left, three to the right and one to the rear. Above each doorway (all fitted with timber doors) is a decorated frieze panel, except above the rear door where there is a pivoted fanlight. The rooms to the left are the current living and dining rooms, which are joined by a large, rectangular shaped opening. Its shape and the difference in ceiling finishes in each room suggest that this was an amendment to the original plan. Both rooms have doorways onto the sleep-out that feature frieze panels. The living room's pressed metal ceiling incorporates a border and concave cornice. In the centre is located a single square featuring a cherub. In the rear wall of the dining room there is an unusual shaped opening. Above a long rectangular servery is centered a square fixed glass panel. This panel's head height matches those of the doors, as does its width. Therefore, it could have been a door at some point. The framing for the hallway walls is exposed in the rooms opening off it. The majority of rooms with windows opening through the western and southern facades of the house have skillion hoods. Those that do not are sheltered by the overhang of the ensuite's skillion roof. The hoods feature flat, galvanized iron roofs, timber battens to each side and carved timber brackets. All windows are double-hung sashes, except three opening off the ensuite, which are casement. The last room to open to the right off the hallway has a picture rail fixed at a height of approximately . In its western wall a door opens into an ensuite. This was built after an application was made by the current owners to the Heritage Branch in November 2001. The ensuite fills in what had been a small entry verandah accessed by a short flight of stairs. The stairs remain, as does the lattice door that once opened into the verandah. One of the ensuite's three casement windows has been covered, although it is visible on the exterior. The door between the bedroom and ensuite has a fixed glass panel above and a timber threshold. In plan, the kitchen is \\"L\\" shaped and one enters from the hallway at its corner. Three more rooms open off this space. The first is currently (2003) a main bedroom, the second is the main bathroom, and the third room is a small laundry. A bank of timber, casement windows line the external wall of the kitchen, and open onto a patio, which is recent and roofed with clear PVC sheeting. Both doors accessing these rooms from the kitchen have timber thresholds. The main bathroom has a tiled floor from the later part of the twentieth century. Its walls are lined with vertically-jointed tongue and groove, and pine boarding divided by a picture rail at door head height. The bedroom's only window is divided into three parts. The ceiling to the kitchen slopes to match that found in the sleep-out and verandah areas. In the south-west corner of the house, where the kitchen opens into the sleep-out, there are two windows. One is fixed glass and visible on the rear facade. The other window can only be seen from inside the toilet, which has been added to the building, possibly when it was used as flats. Taking the evidence of the slope in the ceilings and the location of timber thresholds, fixed glass panels above doors, and exposed framing, it is likely that the kitchen space was open at some point.  Grounds  The front fence consists of painted timber frame and palings atop a low, stepped brick wall. The pedestrian and driveway entry gates are made of white, painted tubular steel. A brick pathway leads from the pedestrian gate to the entry stairs. A large palm tree shelters part of the front facade, extending the height of the house's western gable end. There is some small to medium size shrubbery situated within the zone of the front setback. When moving around the exterior of the house, it becomes clear that a number of level changes occur on the lot. In general terms, a continuous step divides the eastern and western sides of the lot. The western area is flat and allows cars to be driven along the driveway and under the rear of the house. A step of approximately runs perpendicular from the rear boundary and meets the underside of the house where the patio has been attached. It moves underneath the house and the difference in level is dissipated toward the front boundary. The eastern half of the yard is also largely flat. Adjoining the verandah are three established trees and some low planting. A large brick BBQ sits against the eastern fence at the point where the patio stairs empty out.  Heritage listing  Idavine was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Idavine at 2 Burnett Street is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history and is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places insofar as it is a representative example of Federation-style residential architecture in a precinct of Ipswich containing historically significant timber and brick houses. Its long association with German owners from 1886 onwards is also indicative of the influential presence of German emigrants in Queensland following the well-planned immigration scheme established in Germany during the late 19th century.

It is also important because of its aesthetic significance, which contributes to the overall historical character of the Burnett Street precinct. As a whole, the streetscape of Ipswich abounds with significant examples of early Queensland housing and architecture and this residence remains an important and well-preserved example of Federation housing in the area. Its well-maintained state also gives it individual aesthetic value, with many of its original internal and external features intact.

O'Leary's work was passed on for many generations purely by oral tradition. Her poetry, while it was sung or recited, is recognized as an early form of the spoken word art form. She was unknown to the English-speaking world, but a minority of Gaelic-speaking and Gaelic-reading Irish people kept her voice alive for almost a hundred years until it was documented. In the early 20th century, Father Donagh O'Donoghue compiled and published a book of O'Leary's poetry in Gaelic titled the \\"Filiocht Mhaire Bhuidhe Ni Laoghaire\\". It was later translated into English by Fr. Sean Sweeney of the Society of African Missions and Fr. Richard P. Burke of the College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts. The title translates to \\"The Poetry of Maura Bwee O'Leary\\" and was first published in 1931, with a second printing in 1933 and finally in 1950. A passage is devoted to O'Leary in Robert Welch's Oxford Companion to Irish Literature, 1996 Edition; and a second book, Songs of An Irish Poet: The Mary O'Leary Story by Brian Brennan which is available on Google Books. O'Leary clan The O'Leary's were a clan or sept from the region of Corca Laoighe (Curk-a-Lee) in West Cork. The invading Normans forced them north to the River Lee where they settled on a territory known as the land of the O'Leary's. At Carrignacurra, Carrignageelagh and at Dromcarra, they built three castles. Maura O'Leary was the first of eight children born to Dermot Bwee and his wide Siobhan (Joanna). She was raised in Tureenanane on 50 acres of land, but eloped with Seamus Burke (de Burca) in 1792. Burke, from Skibbereen, came from a family of soldiers but was a horse dealer by trade. They married in Inchigeelagh and bought a farm in Avnagh Beg Island where they raised six sons and three daughters. Inspiration The war of 1641‚Äì53 decimated Ireland's population as Protestant England broke the power of the Irish lordships in an effort to \\"civilize\\" and Anglicize Catholic Ireland. Over time it became forbidden to speak the Gaelic language but early poets such as O'Leary kept it alive. Maura (Mary) was known as \\"Yellow Mary\\" because of her sallow complexion. A woman of the people, she understood the hardships around her and composed poetic songs to express the troubles and lift the spirits of her generation. Laments, love songs, songs of devotion and mourning, ballads of drinking songs, merriment and keening verses were all within her work and vision. While O'Leary was unable to read or write, her songs were sung at markets, at fairs and around campfires. As her songs were sung only in Gaelic, she was part of a group of Irish poets in the region who kept the language alive during the period before the Great Famine of the 1840s. Death O'Leary died in 1848 in Gougane Barra where a stone now stands next to the church to commemorate her life and work. Work O'Leary used words to vent the ongoing threat of the English: \\"I'll cease from verse- making; old age is creeping; The big-bellied beasts, my heart hates to the core; No more shall I say, then - may that not relieve them - But havoc and quaking be dogging their door!\\" \\"On A Sunny Hillside\\" To each on the road bring the news that they come! They're coming in force, powder bullets and gun! Swift doughty supporters ‚Äì Louis and Spaniard as one To Banba's green shore in full hope, by the grace of God's son. Her work is still taught in schools across Ireland as part of preserving the Gaelic language. \\"The Poor Gaels Are Tormented\\": When we overhaul them, let nobody talk of A pint or a quart to put on the score, But barrels, full tall ones, piled in the hallway, For thousands of callers, gallons galore!

It was built . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The residence at 6 Burnett Street, West Ipswich, is a brick house built for David McLaughlin. The allotment on which this residence is situated was first purchased on 11 May 1855 as allotment 97, parish of Ipswich, county Stanley (1r 32.5p), by Patrick O'Sullivan at a cost of . O'Sullivan was born in 1818 in Ireland and at the age of 19 he was found guilty of assault with a bayonet at Canterbury, England, and transported to Australia. By 1847, O'Sullivan had settled in Ipswich where he worked as a shopkeeper and was elected to the Queensland Legislative Assembly in 1860. By March 1857, the title to allotment 97 was transferred to David McLaughlin, an Ipswich builder. He was born in Newtown Limavardy, in Ireland, and it appears that it was there that McLaughlin first became acquainted with William Lackey Ferguson, a bricklayer. Following Ferguson's emigration in 1860, McLaughlin and his fellow Irishman from Newtown began a building contracting business in Ipswich known as McLaughlin & Ferguson and which successfully tendered for work on the Ipswich Grammar School. As a builder, McLaughlin was in an advantageous position to have his own house built and Ipswich Municipal Council Valuation Registers indicate that a brick cottage and workshop existed on the allotment in Burnett Street as early as 1863. In 1870, Council records indicate that Alfred Dann was the occupant. When sold it was described as \\"just the thing for a gentleman on the lookout for a town house\\" and intriguingly said to enjoy \\"sea breezes\\". Despite the enticements, the property remained in the ownership of David McLaughlin until June 1872, when title to the land was registered in the name of John North. North was born in Hertfordshire, England, and migrated with his sister to Australia in 1854 on board the Genghis Khan. Within 2 years North was living in Ipswich and working for the major department store, Cribb & Foote, where he remained in employment for over 40 years. By 1876, he had acquired allotment 98 adjacent to 6 Burnett Street from William Berry, the then owner of 1 Burnett Street. Ipswich Municipal Council records indicate that North demolished a timber cottage that had stood on this allotment and utilized it for the next 22 years as his garden. North died at his Burnett Street residence in August 1898 and the property was passed to his wife, Laura Ann North, who remained there until she sold the estate on 1 February 1907 to George William Wesley Rylatt, a dentist of Brisbane Street, Ipswich. Ownership was then passed to Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Runge who was listed as the registered owner of the property in April 1920. Runge, who also owned 2 Burnett Street at the time, did not live in the house at 6 Burnett Street and continued to rent it until his death in 1923, after which time it was held in trust and eventually transferred to his son, also named Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Runge. After taking possession of the property, Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Runge junior sold allotment 98 as subdivisions. By 1934, the title to the land had once again changed hands and George Hawley was registered as the owner of the property. The Hawley family had migrated to Australia from England and were farmers in the Fassifern Valley. The Burnett Street estate remained in the family for 56 years and it was named \\"Notnel\\" (Lenton backwards) by George Hawley in memory of Lenton Avenue where he had lived in England. In 1990, the title to 6 Burnett Street was transferred to a family which undertook substantial refurbishments and repairs to the property.  Description  Rooftop, 2015 Notnel occupies a very large, long allotment that is in size and located less than one km from the Ipswich town centre. The house is sited close to the Burnett Street boundary, the front verandah edge being set back from it by only . Notnel does not enjoy the same elevated positions No.1 Burnett Street (William Berry residence) and Idavine do, however it overlooks a wide area to the west where the Ipswich Grammar School is located. The front part of the single-storey house features a steeply pitched, short-ridge roof surrounded on three and a half sides by separate verandah roofs. Two dormer windows protrude to the north and east from this main roof structure. Their sides are clad in corrugated iron and their roofs are short-ridged. At the rear is a smaller pyramid-roofed structure separated from the front section by a short gabled roof. A small skillion roof abuts the rear sloping away from the pyramid-roofed structure. On the eastern facade the verandah roof continues over enclosed space to meet the rear skillion. On the western facade the verandah roof extends in front of the pyramid-roofed structure. The entire roof is clad in corrugated iron, with two brick chimney stacks protruding through it. External walls are predominantly brick. Facing the eastern boundary and Burnett Street, the verandah edges are defined by square timber posts with simply carved capitals. Centred on the front facade is a set of double lattice doors held in place by recent, unpainted timber posts without capitals. Between the verandah posts are simple, timber handrails, and cross- braced balustrades and valances. On the western facade, aligned to the house's front brick face, a set of four full-height sash windows have been installed. The southern end of this facade is completed in brick. Under the main short- ridge roof facing Burnett Street are four rooms. The front two are living and dining spaces. Entry is from the verandah and through the living room, which has a fireplace centred on its eastern wall. Entry to the dining room is through a door on the western wall. A further door from the living room opens into the short central hallway that separates the two rear rooms. The stairs to the single attic room start in this hallway space. All four rooms open onto the verandah with timber double doors. A door from the short hallway opens onto the rear verandah area. Off this space to the left, access is gained to a single bedroom contained partly under the gable roof and the extension of the verandah roof. A fireplace is located on its eastern wall. To one's right is a bathroom, which occupies a corner of space contained under the west-facing verandah roof. To the left along the rear, west-facing verandah, access is gained to the kitchen, which is contained under the pyramid roof. The overall height of this space and a remaining rim of skirting boards at approximately , suggest that there was once a room above the kitchen and access to this space is now gained by a set of narrow stairs. In the kitchen's southern wall is a large stove alcove. A door in the room's eastern wall opens onto a small covered space. This opens into a storage room. These spaces are under the last part of the extension of the verandah roof, the storage area abutting the skillion-roofed laundry on its southern wall. The laundry is accessed from the rear yard space.  Heritage listing  Notnel was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Built , Notnel is one of Ipswich's earliest brick houses and remains important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history and in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The house was constructed in a period characterized by high unemployment and poor economic conditions, however Ipswich emerged as a centre of business and industrial activity. The house remains one of Ipswich's finest and most significant examples of early Queensland domestic architecture from a period when the growing strength of the city was reflected in the more substantial residential buildings being constructed from the mid-1860s onwards. Built originally for David McLaughlin, a contractor, is an example of a substantial early house in the Ipswich area and remains of interest for its unique features such as the attic and dormer windows.

It was an adaptation of the Nickelodeon Latin American telenovela, Toni, la Chef, and was created by Mariela Romero & Catharina Ledeboer, the same writers who made Every Witch Way & WITS Academy. On March 4, 2015, Nickelodeon ordered 40 episodes for the series, all the episodes making up the first season. The season premiered on July 6, 2015, and continued on November 30, 2015. Before the next set of episodes, a sneak peek of the set aired on November 25, 2015. A majority of the episodes aired in July and December 2015. Very few episodes were shown in- between those months. On January 12, 2016, it was confirmed that the show was cancelled.http://www.twistmagazine.com/posts/talia-in-the-kitchen-is- canceled-86990 Plot 14-year-old Talia Parra has her passion for cooking take flight when she and her younger sister visit their grandmother in Miami for the summer and later move in with her. With help from her new friends and her late father's magical spices, Talia revives business in her family restaurant by cooking truly life-changing meals that are just what each customer needs. Cast and characters *Talia Parra (Maria Quezada): An optimistic girl who loves everything and is fond of cooking, ready to help Lola's. She doesn't like the Fuccinellis due to their rivalry after them closing Lola's. Debbie Fuccinelli, Talia's greatest rival, works at Fuccinelli's. The two are constantly competing to see who is the better one of the two. Talia dislikes Debbie because of her self-absorbed personality, and also being somewhat jealous of her. Not only is Debbie more attractive, popular, and intelligent than Talia, but is also a more exceptional chef as well. Talia has made it her goal to try and surpass Debbie, and dislikes anyone affiliated with her. However, she did have a crush on Tyson, Debbie's twin brother. Her two best friends are Rudy & Valerie. Her little sister is Julia, a child prodigy who helps to get Lola's back into shape. Talia finds magic spices her father has been hiding from her after a long time, and she later discovers she is a SpiceMaster, someone special who can use these spices with the effects. *Deborah \\"Debbie\\" Fuccinelli (Gail Soltys): Maria's main rival. Debbie Fuccinelli astonishingly pretty, popular, and smart and is an extremely talented and amazing chef with unrivaled skills in the kitchen and cooks at the Fuccinelli's Restaurant. She dreams of ruling the restaurant world with an iron fist, and will ruin the life of anyone who dares oppose her. Which is why she has chosen Lola's, the Fuccinelli's rival restaurant, as her target. Debbie is seen constantly competing with Talia Parra, a chef at Lola's and her greatest rival, to see who's the better one between the two. Debbie despises Talia because of her ignorance. She finds it irritating to meet someone who has the \\"nerve\\" to try compete against her. So, Debbie has taken it upon herself to teach Talia, and anyone who helps her, a lesson in what means to mess with Debbie Fuccinelli. Debbie acts like no one can beat her, but she is secretly tends has little confidence in her skills, believing that her best isn't good enough. This was shown during the second half of the series, when she inadvertently accepts a win against Talia in a cooking contest when her cousin and teacher, Frenchie, cheated. Debbie loses her self- confidence because her win wasn't fair. She eventually learns to not have so much doubt and regains her confidence in the kitchen. She also becomes more nicer and kind towards Lola's, no longer trying to sabotage them and even helping them. All Debbie basically wants to do is be best chef she can be. She obviously cares a lot about her family and their business, and is willing to do anything to protect the Fuccinelli name. *Julie Parra (Galilea La Salvia): Julia is Talia's younger sister who's the incomer of Lola's. She is smart, creative, gifted, and talented. Even though she is younger, Julia is often the one to take the role as older sister, being more responsible and mature than Talia. She is a child prodigy with a knack for making complex and amazing inventions that never fail to hold other people in awe. She has a passion for fixing things such as the sign of Lola's and making the stove hotter. After they move to Miami to live with their grandma for the summer, Julie helps Talia jump-start the mission to save Lola's. Julia is quite arguably the most important person in Talia's life, often giving her words of advice and helping her out of jam. However, that doesn't mean that they don't have their bad moments. Julia uses her superior intellect to easily outwit and manipulate Talia to do whatever she wants. Julia can also often get her in trouble, and the two of them also argue a lot, not always seeing eye to eye. Julia can get infuriated by Talia's unseriousness, while Talia is annoyed by Julia's mischievousness. Even so, at the end of the day, the two still love each other. Like her sister, she's is also a very talented chef. Julia isn't just good with her hands when it comes to making machines, but also making delicious meals. Julia uses her bright and brilliant mind and her many other abilities to help put Lola's back on track. Especially if it means she can do it in her own unique and amazing way. *Rudy Rosales (Joshua Hoffman): Talia's best friend. He is great at fixing things, such as putting Mexican music, which everybody hates, in Miami; he also can make Mexican into Punk Rock just for Talia. At first, Talia didn't like Rudy because he would be every other typical guy, but they developed feelings in \\"Sugar Rush\\", though Talia had a crush on Tyson. Rudy is great friends with Valerie too and doesn't like Fuccinelli's as much as Lola's. *Valerie Landry (Ellis Ann Jackson): Talia's best friend. She is very kind and sweet but she is very scared to commit any crimes. She confesses a lot because she wants to tell the truth. She also doesn't like getting into trouble due to her parents grounding her, or for some other reason. Valerie tries to be in her good side and bad side, but it has to work. She is great friends with Talia & Rudy. *Tyson Fuccinelli (Liam Obergfoll): Debbie's twin brother who couldn't be any more different from her. He's charming, polite and a little bit clueless, but he's got a good heart. He's a total heartthrob, awesome athlete and thanks to his killer smile, he is Talia's love interest. *Federico \\"Frenchie\\" Fuccinelli (Miguel Luciano): Debbie's cousin and the head chef of the Fuccinelli's Restaurant who doesn't want to make the business fall if Lola's was reopened by Talia. Frenchie is very strict, egotistical, and wants everything perfect. He is even a bigger enemy to them, because he is not a nice guy to be around, and he does bad actions, like taking down the posters for Lola's in \\"Don't Cry Over spilt Tres Leches\\". He is sworn enemies with Lola's and tries to close it again, but Talia's plans could keep it open for years. He is unable to realize his envy against Lola's, due to his belief is that he \\"looks good on everything\\". *Dolores Parra (Jeannette Lehr): Talia and Julie's grandmother and a sweet lady who wants to share her taste in culinary arts. She taught Talia how to cook, and she was the owner of Lola's until it was closed down by the Fuccinellis. She encourages Talia to step in and be the best. *Rocky Palroso (Ethan Estrada): A 12-year-old boy whom Julie meets at the local community center. He has helped Talia, Julie, Rudy, and Valerie many times (most likely because has a crush on Julie), always stating that he \\"knows a guy.\\" *Avery (Marika Dumancas): Debbie's best friend who stays with Debbie and Frenchie at Fuccinelli's. She's usually seen with a deadpan expression and is always texting or taking pictures, including selfies. Her sarcasm and one liners are a stark contrast to Debbie. *Jayden Grubb (William Wilson): A chef introduced in the episode \\"Storm and Grubb\\" who is a SpiceMaster just like Talia. He and his brother Michael work in a food truck called Brothers in Grubb. Jayden has a crush on Talia, but since they are both SpiceMasters, they have to compete against each other. *Michael Grubb (Cooper Rowe): Jayden's brother who works with Jayden in their food truck. He helps Jayden train to go against Talia. *Will (Tommy Goodman): A chef who used to work at Lola's before moving to Fuccinelli's after Lola's was closed. He later returned to Lola's, but was after the magic spices.

The development was designed to supply the State's expanding oil, gas and mineral resources sectors' operations in the north and west of the state. It allows South Australia to import fuel from ships carrying cargoes in excess of 100,000 tonnes- approximately four times the size of vessels currently importing diesel via Port Adelaide. The project is owned by Petro Diamond Australia, a wholly owned subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corporation. The first stage of the project was officially opened in May 2016.  Petroleum importation in South Australia  Prior to establishment of Port Bonython Fuels, South Australia imported hydrocarbons at ports with significant depth constraints. The two berths receiving hydrocarbons were at Kirton Point, Port Lincoln (with a draught of 9.9 metres) and at Inner harbor, Port Adelaide (with a draught of 10.7 metres). With a depth of approximately 20 metres, Port Bonython will be able to receive cargoes from much larger tankers than at the state's shallower ports.  Ownership  The terminal is owned by IOR Terminals Pty Ltd, an Australian company based in Adelaide, South Australia. The facility is operated by Coogee Chemicals. The pre-existing 2.4 kilometre long jetty at Port Bonython is used by Port Bonython Fuels to import hydrocarbons. The jetty was constructed by Santos Ltd in 1982, and was sold to the Government of South Australia in 1983 for $48.2 million. As of 2015, the jetty remains Government infrastructure but has been used exclusively by Santos for the export of hydrocarbon products.  Operations  Fuel will be imported to a land-based tank farm then distributed via tankers up to A-Triple in size. Vessels will berth at the existing wharf at Port Bonython, which is capable of accommodating vessels of 120,000 DWT. Two new loading arms were added to the jetty to support the facility's needs, along with 5.2 km of pipeline which connects the berth with the land-based facility. Three tanks have been constructed, each with a capacity of 27 million litres. The tank farm at Stage 1 has an aggregate storage capacity of 81 million litres. The facility was designed to offer a 24-hour, 7-day-per-week service.  History  Port Bonython Fuels was originally conceived by Stuart Petroleum and the Scott Group of Companies in August 2007, as a $45 million joint venture project. It was disclosed as part of the Government of South Australia's plan to support the growth of the mining sector in 2008. A Development Application was lodged with the Government of South Australia by Stuart Petroleum in May 2009. The Port Bonython Fuels project received development approval in January 2010. Senex Energy acquired Stuart Petroleum, then sold Port Bonython Fuels to Mitsubishi Corporation in 2012-13. The project was re-announced in 2014, and valued at $110 million. Treasurer Tom Koutsantonis described the facility as providing a \\"competitive and reliable supply and helping underpin future economic growth.\\" The proposal was met with opposition from the Alternative Port Working Party, which has campaigned for the relocation of industrial development projects away from the Point Lowly peninsula. Spokesperson Sid Wilson told the ABC in 2014: > \\"We still have the concern that they are degrading the natural environment - > as much as they'll create 10 new jobs full-time they'll degrade the tourism > and recreation appeal of that area. Really our concern is that they're > developing the best piece of coastal marine land within 100 kilometres of > Whyalla.\\"  References  Economy of South Australia Energy in South Australia ","title":"Port Bonython Fuels"},{"id":"47116366","text":"Sri Aurobindo College (Evening) is a co-ed constituent college of the University of Delhi in New Delhi, India.

The fortress, which lies from the Turkish border, was built in response to the Russo-Turkish War of 1828‚Äì1829. It is a national cultural heritage monument in Armenia. History Gyumri, which lies on the border with Turkey, became part of the Russian Empire after the Treaty of Gulistan. Gyumri was renamed Alexandropol in 1837 after the visit of Tsar Nicholas I, in honor of his wife, Empress Alexandra Fyodorovna. The fortress was built on top of a hill, and the full fortification took a decade after the first stones were laid in 1834. The fortress is a 360-degree round structure made of black stone, from which it gets its name. After Russia's loss in the Crimean War, Sev Berd was upgraded and designated a \\"first-class\\" fortress. It never underwent a siege, but was of strategic importance in victories over the Turks in subsequent wars that lasted through 1878. The fortress was downgraded to \\"second-class\\" status in 1887, after the final Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878 that saw Russia gain strongholds in Kars and Batumi. The Russian 102nd Military Base was built in the 1940s next to Sev Berd. The base remains active today for the Russian military, which provides national defense support for Armenia. Current status The fortress was purchased by the Balasanyan family in 2012. Owner Misak Balasanyan intends to turn Sev Berd into a tourist attraction. Archeological efforts are ongoing at the site.

Career Early career Ripp began his career as a singer, initially informally harmonizing rock and roll songs with friends from high school. In 1957, Ripp formed an official singing group with neighborhood friends; the group was signed by ABC-Paramount Records as backup singers for ABC solo artists. The singers sang backup for Paul Anka on his 1957 hit \\"Diana\\" and broke up shortly thereafter. Ripp rejoined with some of his informal singing partners (Mario \\"Skippy\\" Scarpa, Stu Silverman, and Joe Tedesco) to form \\"The Four Temptations\\". The quartet wrote its own songs and was signed by ABC-Paramount Records, which released the group's first single in 1958. The A-side, \\"Cathy\\" (named after Scarpa's newly born niece), was written by Scarpa and Ripp; the B-side was \\"Rock & Roll Baby\\", written by Scarpa, Ripp, and Silverman. When the group rejected opportunities offered by the record company to record others' songs, the record company withheld further recording opportunities, and the group disbanded. Ripp shifted from performing to being behind-the-scenes in the music business. About his potential as a performer, Ripp states, \\"I sucked. I was no Elvis Presley and I wasn't a writer.\\" Additionally, Ripp states, \\"I started walking around Broadway and I‚Äôd see these kids who were making records and not getting paid. They could have a number one record on the charts and end up owing the record company a half a million dollars...I thought, 'This business has some system.'...\\" In 1958, Ripp targeted George Goldner to be a potential mentor. Goldner, based in New York City, was a music industry entrepreneur who owned copyrights, produced records, and owned record companies. Goldner was, in the words of American blues singer and songwriter Jerome \\"Doc\\" Pomus, a \\"very hip, New York kind of tough guy.\\" After Ripp spent weeks informally observing Goldner at work, Goldner formally hired Ripp to be a go-fer. Ripp worked with songwriter and producer Richard Barrett within Goldner's organization, where Ripp got a \\"street education in the record business equal to none\\". Ripp learned how Goldner worked a studio, structured a record contract, and got records played on the radio. Functioning as manager instead of performer, Ripp put together the New York vocal group \\"The Temptations\\", (formed at least a year before the name was used by the different Motown group). Ripp's Temptations recorded for Goldner's Goldisc Records; its three singles were released in 1960 and 1961. The song \\"Barbara\\" charted nationally, reaching number 29 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the spring of 1960. Ripp quickly rose in the music publishing, recording, and distribution business. In 1961, after Goldner transferred his Gone and End record labels to music industry executive Morris Levy, Ripp became national promotion director at Nevins/Kirshner Associates, Inc., founded by Al Nevins and Don Kirshner. (Nevins/Kirshner was the parent company of Dimension Records and its music publishing division Aldon Music (BMI). Aldon, located at 1650 Broadway in Manhattan, played a significant role in shaping the so-called \\"Brill Building Pop\\" sound of the late 1950s and early 1960s.) In 1962, Ripp partnered with music publisher Aaron \\"Goldie\\" Goldmark and was named vice president of three of Goldmark's newly established businesses: Goldie Records, Inc., Armada Music, Inc. (ASCAP), and Fredella Music, Inc. (BMI) (which were together known as Goldmark Music, Ltd. in association with Chappell, Ltd.). During the summer of 1962, Goldmark and Ripp collaborated to generate worldwide distribution arrangements that were described by Billboard as having \\"angles never before achieved in the business.\\" In 1963, when Goldmark was selected to head Premier Albums' newly established publishing and master-production operations, Ripp followed and was named chief of \\"A&R;\\" (Artists and Repertoire) for Premier's subsidiary, Award Music, which was the master-production business. As A&R; Chief, Ripp signed singer Carl Dobkins, Jr. Also under contract with Award during Ripp's tenure were Jimmy Jones and The Hollywood Flames, both of whom were on the Vee-Jay record label. In 1963, Ripp produced \\"Just One Look\\" for Doris Troy. The song peaked at number ten on the Billboard pop chart and at number three on the Rhythm and Blues chart. It was listed as one of the 7,500 most important songs of the Rock-n-Roll era and was covered by The Hollies as their first single. Kama Sutra In 1964, Ripp, with Hy Mizrahi and Phil Steinberg, founded Kama Sutra, initially an independent production company based in New York. As a production house, the company established a \\"consistent and impressive track record\\" in the singles market; Kama Sutra hit \\"immediately and often.\\" Ripp's work included an association and collaboration with the songwriting-and-production team of Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, who had co-founded the Red Bird Records label with Goldner in 1964. In 1964, Red Bird released \\"Remember (Walkin' In The Sand)\\", which became a hit for the girl group The Shangri-Las; Ripp is credited within having \\"discovered\\" the group and shares a producer credit with Jeff Barry on the song. (American singer-songwriter Billy Joel, whom Ripp as a future record-label owner would sign to a recording contract about seven years later, recalls playing piano on the single; whether his playing was used on the demo version that had been produced by \\"Shadow\\" Morton or on the master version that had been produced by Barry and Ripp is unclear.) Also, when Leiber and Stoller's time-consuming work with The Drifters and The Coasters demanded much of their attention, Ripp was selected to take over production of singles for Jay and the Americans, released on United Artists. When the band \\"hit\\" in 1964 with the Ripp-produced \\"Come A Little Bit Closer\\", the band was invited to participate in the first Beatles' tour of the U.S., along with The Righteous Brothers, and played with The Rolling Stones at Carnegie Hall. Although Kama Sutra signed a major production contract in early 1965 with record label Columbia Records (with whom Ripp as principal of Family Productions would later negotiate regarding control of Billy Joel's contract in the 1970s), its primary and most significant distribution deal, established in mid-1965, was with MGM. In 1965, after accountant Art Kass (a former employee of MGM Records) joined the management team, Kama Sutra expanded and became a record label, with Ripp as musical director. It opened a location in California, which was becoming the center of American popular music production. The west coast office was ultimately headed by Bob Krasnow; Ripp shifted to operate out of California in 1967. The label's first single, produced by Ripp, was The Vacels' \\"You're My Baby (And Don't You Forget It)\\", which peaked at 63 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart on August 21, 1965. Ripp also negotiated a deal with the production team that handled The Lovin' Spoonful; it is said that the band carried the label through its first year. In 1966, Ripp and his two co-principals negotiated a deal with Ashley Famous Agency (AFA) for AFA to act as the exclusive booker for the majority of Kama Sutra's artists and all its writers and producers. Buddah Records In 1967, Kama Sutra leadership, sensing that the MGM distribution deal was limiting the company's output, created the Buddah Records label as a subsidiary with distribution handled by Kama Sutra. Neil Bogart, who later co-founded Casablanca Records, was hired as vice president and general manager. Staff writers and producers included Peter Anders and Vini Poncia (who had created hits for The Ronettes), Bo Gentry and Ritchie Cordell (associated with Tommy James & the Shondells), Levine and Resnick, Elliot Chiprut, and Bobby Bloom. Bogart steered the label in the direction of Bubblegum pop, and the label had hits with Ohio Express and the 1910 Fruitgum Company. At its first anniversary in 1968, Buddah was ranked seventh in the U.S. in sales of singles; the company's estimated first-year sales were $5.8 million. In 1968, Viewlex, a Long Island, New York company that made projectors and slides primarily for the school market, acquired Buddah by purchasing all its stock, and the three original partners (Ripp, Mizrahi, and Steinberg) left. (When Bubblegum's appeal faded, so did Buddah's fortunes; parent company Viewlex went bankrupt in 1976. Buddah changed ownership and continued to release new music until 1983. In 1986, Buddah and its back catalogue were sold, and through a series of acquisitions, Buddah‚Äîsince renamed \\"Buddha\\"‚Äîbecame a reissue label owned by Sony Music Entertainment.) Together, the Kama Sutra and Buddah labels released almost 100 Billboard Top 40 singles and almost fifty hits on the Billboard Rhythm & Blues chart. This productivity amounted to about one chart hit for every five releases; major record labels of the day realized about one chart hit for every twenty to thirty releases. Family Productions After obtaining financial and a promise of logistical backing from Ampex and Famous Music Corp. (the music publishing division of Paramount Pictures which was itself a subsidiary of Gulf + Western), Ripp founded Family Productions, Inc. (originally called \\"A. Ripp Family Productions) in 1970. The agreement included a \\"built-in promotion fund\\" and a commitment from Paramount to promote the output from the production house. The company's logo was an image of the Capitoline Wolf. =Association with Billy Joel= In 1971, Family Productions signed 22-year-old Billy Joel to a long-term recording-and-publishing contract as a solo artist. (Joel had previously come to the attention of producer Michael Lang, co-creator of Woodstock and principal of Just Sunshine Records.) Lang had given Joel a monetary advance, but then passed Joel along to Ripp‚Äîwhile still retaining rights to profit from Joel's output‚Äîbecause he wanted to focus his attentions on a different artist instead.) Ripp produced Joel's first solo album Cold Spring Harbor, and Paramount distributed it. Jon Troy, an early Joel manager, was promotions director at Family Productions. Despite the occurrence of a mastering snafu that altered its pitch, Cold Spring Harbor showed critical promise but was a commercial failure; distribution was poor, and promotion was insufficient. Joel states, \\"We [including touring bandmates Rhys Clark, Larry Russell, and Alan Hertzberg] didn't make any money, nobody got paid. We were touring around in one of these little camper trailer things, eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.\\" While Joel has blamed the failure of Cold Spring Harbor on Ripp, stating, for example, that Ripp had run out of money to fix the mastering error, Ripp states that he spent $450,000 in developing Joel. Others describe parent company Gulf + Western's commitment to music production and distribution as having been lackluster; Joel biographer Fred Schruers describes the Paramount record label as being \\"too dysfunctional to do the kind of marketing and promotion that would trigger really profitable album sales.\\" Later, in 1974, when Gulf + Western sold Paramount's subsidiary Famous‚Äîand thus the majority of Famous' labels‚Äîto ABC Records, a Famous Music employee stated, \\"Frankly, I don't think Gulf & Western really wanted to be in the music business. They were never particularly enthusiastic about it and the picture company [Paramount] was making an awful lot more money than we were.\\" The relationship between Joel and Ripp deteriorated and in 1972, Joel jumped ship to Columbia Records. In exchange for releasing Joel from his contract with Family, Ripp agreed to receive about four percent - then 28 cents - of the retail price of each sale of Joel's first ten albums released with Columbia; Lang agreed to receive about two percent.https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/60930/billy-joel-the-life- times-of-an-angry-young-man-continued The Capitoline Wolf logo from Family Productions continued to appear on Joel's albums for a period of time. Ripp retained publishing rights until Walter Yetnikoff, head of Columbia in the 1970s and 1980s, bought them and gave them to Joel as a birthday gift in 1978. Fidelity Recording In 1971, Ripp founded Fidelity Recording, a Studio City, California recording studio. In 1976, Fidelity's Studio B was where The Runaways, an all-female rock band which included a young Joan Jett, recorded the punk-influenced hard rock single \\"Cherry Bomb\\". Band manager Kim Fowley describes Studio B as being \\"a remade storeroom...It was awful. But it wasn't scary. It was the kind of studio you wanted a garage product out of...[If] you walk into a room where they store stuff, you're not going to be intimidated. You're going to swagger about: ‚ÄòWhat a horrible place. Oh, well, we've played a lot of horrible places. This is nothing new.‚Äô‚Äù Ripp describes Studio B as being convertible from a different use into a studio when need be. He states, \\"...there was an intimacy in the room and there was a sound that was tight and alive, despite its lack of, shall we say, visual amenities.‚Äù Fowley states that the practice at Fidelity was \\"...no guests. No visitors. No parents, no record company, nothing. We were at war. We didn't have time to entertain in the foxhole. No drugs or alcohol either. Fast food. You always play obnoxious rock 'n' roll when you eat bad fast food.‚Äù Fidelity is where the soundtrack of a Hanna-Barbera production in The Cat in the Hat franchise was recorded in 1981. The studio is also where Ripp and Woodstock-planner Artie Kornfeld re- mixed Survivor's Premonition album in 1981, although the group's founding member Jim Peterik states that he and others did a final mix. Fidelity is also where Ripp and engineer Larry Elliot substantially overdubbed and re-mixed Joel's Cold Spring Harbor album in 1983; the remix was reissued by Columbia. Other artists who recorded work at Fidelity include Mandrill, Melanie, Peter Yarrow, and G√°bor Szab√≥. In 2002, Ripp sold the studio to Tom Weir, who renamed it Studio City Sound and went on to win a 2004 Grammy Award for mixing the year's Best Reggae Album, True Love. Later career Ripp has been the principal of Ripp Entertainment Group, Inc. since 1977. Additionally, Ripp established the Home Grown Music, Inc. (BMI) publishing company in 1979, and in 1980, Ripp established the Ripparthur Music, Inc. (ASCAP) publishing company, thereby controlling many aspects of music production: publishing companies, a production company, and a recording studio. Neither Home Grown Music nor Ripparthur Music remains an independent entity. In the late 2000s, Ripp Entertainment Group was named the exclusive distributor of the short- lived DVCD+ digital storage technology, which Ripp co-invented and which became available in 2008. In 2014, he established Artful Results, Inc., through which he is producer and \\"navigator\\". Ripp has also had a career in other media outlets as a film actor, film producer, and consultant. In the 1978 film American Hot Wax, a biopic about disc jockey Alan Freed that was directed by Floyd Mutrux, Ripp played Freed's manager and talent scout. He also played \\"Rotweiler\\" in the 1987 movie \\"Number One With a Bullet,\\" starring Valerie Bertinelli. Ripp served as a consultant on the development of the play Baby It's You!, co-written by Mutrux and music journalist Colin Escott, about the life and music industry career of housewife-turned-record-label-founder Florence Greenberg. The play opened on Broadway in 2011 and its lead actress, Beth Leavel, was nominated for a 2011 Tony Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role in a Musical for her performance as Greenberg. In addition, Ripp served as Music Consultant on the 2014 film \\"Everly\\", starring Salma Hayek. Controversies While he was with Family Productions, Ripp allegedly had \\"an industry reputation of taking advantage of acts he signed.\\" For example, musician Neil Merryweather says of the eponymous album his \\"Heavy Cruiser\\" band put out, \\"Artie made a chunk of money and we never made a dime. But that's the way it was the whole time we were with Family Productions.\\" Merryweather also describes an incident in which a Family employee withheld plane tickets from his Mama Lion band unless the band signed a contract. Merryweather says, \\"This extortion squeeze play thing was typical of Family Productions.\\" The long-term deal Ripp signed with Joel in 1971 serves as another example; its terms have been described as being so severe as to almost \\"deprive Joel of the right to earn a living.\\" Joel calls it \\"a horrible deal,\\" stating, \\"I signed away everything ‚Äì the copyrights, publishing, record royalties, everything. My first child. I gave it all away...\\" About the Cold Spring Harbor album, which Ripp produced in 1971, Joel states, \\"The whole thing was completely overproduced.\\" Joel recalls that making the album had been \\"a torturous process\\" and that it had been \\"misery\\" working with Ripp. Nevertheless, despite these difficulties and others, Joel gives Ripp credit as having been \\"the guy who got me on the radar screen.\\" Joel states, \\"After all the people in the industry who passed on me, Artie Ripp was the guy who wanted me to be his artist. Nobody else heard it, nobody else wanted to sign me, nobody else was making me a deal. Artie made me a deal. He heard something.\\" Persona Former Rolling Stones manager and producer Andrew Loog Oldham describes Ripp's persona as being well-suited to Manhattan's rough-and-tumble world that was the hustling epicenter of American popular music production in the early 1960s; Ripp could slickly persuade his listener to believe in any song he was working on. In 1980, Ripp was filmed driving his Excalibur kit car in a segment about Billy Joel that was produced for the 20/20 television newsmagazine. Personal life Ripp was married to Phyllis Ripp, who died in 1993. He has two children. His son Adam Ripp is the co-writer and director of the film Gang Tapes.

Proponents say that segregation of cyclists from fast or frequent motorized traffic is necessary to provide a safe and welcoming cycling environment. A 2010 Montreal study found that cycle tracks resulted in fewer injuries when compared to comparable parallel roads with no cycling facilities.Lalonde, Michelle. \\"Bike paths reduce injuries: study\\" 10 February 2011. There has also been research showing that separate infrastructure increases crash rates, and critiquing the Montreal study among others for methodological errors.A Review of cycle Track Safety Paul Schimek, 2014 A 2006 report by the National Cooperative Highway Research Program in the US concludes that \\"bicycle safety data are difficult to analyze, mostly because bicycle trip data (and thus accident probability per trip) are hard to uncover\\".NCHRP Report 552, 2006, \\"Guidelines for Analysis of Investment in Bicycle Facilities\\", National Cooperative Highway Research Program, Transportation research Board of the National Academies, page F-1 One major reason for the inability to draw definite conclusion may be that facilities with different risks are often categorized together so that off-road paths ‚Äì paved or unpaved, bicycle-only or multi-use ‚Äì were lumped together, as found by research at the Cycling in Cities program at the University of British Columbia. Studies showing greater benefits A 1997 study by Moritz of North American bicycle commutershttp://www.bicyclinglife.com/Library/Moritz1.htm calculated a relative danger of different facilities based on the survey results of \\"[fraction of crashes] divided by the [fraction of miles ridden on that facility]\\". Moritz calculated a relative danger of 1.26 on a major street with no cycling facilities, 1.04 on a minor street with no cycling facilities, 0.5 for streets with bike lanes, and 0.67 for mixed use/\\"bike\\" path. The \\"other\\" category which mostly included sidewalks had a relative danger of 5.32. Moritz made it clear that this was \\"[n]ot a statistical or random sample of BCs [bicycle commuters].\\" Denmark A large study undertaken by S.U. Jensen et al.Road safety and perceived risk of cycle facilities in Copenhagen, S.U. Jensen, C.

The cycle tracks constructed have resulted in increases in accidents and injuries of 9‚Äì10% on the reconstructed roads.\\" The number of accidents and injuries increased at intersections but decreased mid-block. These changes in road safety have been estimated taking both general trends in safety and changes in car and cycle traffic into account. The Copenhagen study also found accident and injury rates were related to the amount of car parking and number of turn lanes, blue cycle crossing markings, and raised exits at non-signalised intersections, suggesting that risk is dependent on making various improvements to the cycle tracks. For instance, recent planning guidelines in the US advise that cycle tracks drop to a bike lane before arriving at an intersection to increase the visibility of cyclists. Canada In 2009, the University of British Columbia Cycling in Cities Research Program looked at injury and crash data separated by bicycle facility type and found that \\"purpose-built bicycle-only facilities have the lowest risk of crashes and injuries\\". They found such bike-only facilities had lower risk than cycling on-road with motor traffic as well as off-road with pedestrians on sidewalks or multi-use paths. The highest risk of crashes and injuries were found to be on sidewalks and unpaved off-road trails. A 2010 study in Montreal, Quebec, Canada authors found 2.5 times as many cyclists rode on the cycle tracks (physically separated bicycle-exclusive paths along roads) compared to the reference roads (a parallel road with approximately the same intersection frequency and cross traffic) and that the relative risk of injury was lower on a cycle track than on the comparable reference road (the average being 0.72 the relative risk). They concluded that \\"[c]ycle tracks lessen, or at least do not increase, crash and injury rates compared to bicycling in the street\\" A final report from Cycling in Cities in 2012 found that cycling on segregated tracks had approximately one ninth the risk of cycling on major streets with parked cars and no cycle infrastructure, concluding that, \\"Transportation infrastructure with lower bicycling injury risks merits public health support to reduce injuries and promote cycling.\\" New York The New York City Department of Transportation implemented a bicycle path and traffic calming pilot project for Prospect Park West in Brooklyn in 2010 and published their results in early 2011. It created a two-way bicycle path with a three-foot parking lane buffer and the removal of one lane from motor vehicles. They found that weekday cycling traffic tripled after the implementation; cyclists riding on the sidewalk fell to 3% from 46% (the count included children who are legally allowed to ride on the sidewalk); speeding dropped from 74% to 20% of all vehicles; crashes for all road users were down 16% and injuries to all road users were down 21%.Prospect Park West Bicycle Path and Traffic Calming NYC Department of Transportation. Accessed on 7 February 2011 Texas Transportation engineers Ian Hallett, David Luskin, and Randy Machemehl, by studying the interactions of drivers and bicyclists on Texas roads, have discovered that having painted bike lanes on streets and roads helps both commuters stay in safer, more central positions in their respective lanes. Without a marked bike lane, there appears to be a lot of uncertainty about how much space each person needs‚Äîeven when adequate road space is provided. Studies not supporting separation United States In the 1970s, the California Statewide Bicycle Committee commissioned Kenneth D. Cross to study car-bike collisions. The Committee had supposed that many collisions would occur when cars overtook bicycles and that such a finding would help to justify their plans to offer segregation between junctions. Unexpectedly, Cross found that only 0.5% of car-bike collisions had occurred between straight-ahead cyclists and overtaking straight-ahead motorists. Cross in 1977 had a contract with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to produce an improved study (on a pseudo-random national sample), and the results were much the same. In second study by Cross, he argues that, \\"although a reduction in overtaking accidents may not be sufficient justification for the widespread use of on-street bicycle lanes, it is possible that their cost could be justified when considering all the problem types that might be positively affected by such facilities. There is virtually no doubt that off-street bicycle lanes would reduce the incidence of overtaking accidents, if such facilities were available and used by bicyclists who would otherwise be riding on roadways.\\" Diagram showing relative increases in collision rates for users of a common type of segregated cycle pathGalway Cycling Campaign http://www.eirbyte.com/gcc , compiled Wachtel and Lewiston and other studies A 1994 study in Palo Alto, California by A. Wachtel and D. LewistonRisk factors for bicycle-motor vehicle collisions at intersections, A. Wachtel and D. Lewiston, Journal of the Institute of Transportation Engineers, pp 30‚Äì35, September, 1994. concluded that \\"Bicyclists on a sidewalk or bicycle path incur greater risk than those on the roadway (on average 1.8 times as great), most likely because of blind conflicts at intersections. Wrong-way sidewalk bicyclists are at even greater risk, and sidewalk bicycling appears to increase the incidence of wrong-way travel.\\" and \\"Separation of bicycles and motor vehicles leads to blind conflicts at these intersections.\\" It concluded \\"the aim of a well-designed roadway system should be to integrate bicycles and motor vehicles according to the well-established and effective principles of traffic law and engineering, not to separate them. This conclusion is in accord with the 1981 and 1991 AASHTO Guides and the California Highway Design Manual\\". Anne C. Lusk et al. noted that the study by Wachtel and Lewiston only considered intersection crashes, \\"omitting non- intersection crashes that include being hit from behind, sideswiped, or struck by a car door.\\" If the non-intersection crash data is included, as Lusk et al. calculated in their study, it appears that sidewalk bikeways carry half the risk of the street, for bicyclists riding in the same direction as traffic. Lusk et al. claim that the \\"Wachtel and Lewiston data, when corrected to include non-intersection crashes, corroborate our findings that separated paths are safer or at least no more dangerous than bicycling in the street.\\" Canada Aultman-Hall et al. produced a 1998 study based on a survey of Ottawa commuter cyclists and a survey of Toronto commuter cyclists. The surveys were conducted to create \\"estimates of travel exposure on roads, off- road paths and sidewalks\\". They found that \\"the relative rates for falls and injuries suggest it is safest to cycle on-road followed by off-road paths and trails, and finally least safe on sidewalks.\\" The relative rates of collisions on the three different facility types, however, were not statistically significant in the Ottawa study. Aultman-Hall et al. admitted that the limitations to the data and a fuller analysis needed \\"bicycle travel exposure information and the use of more than just collision databases\\". Europe A Danish study by Agerholm et al. in 2008http://vbn.aau.dk/files/14344951/agerholm_et_al._bicycle_paths.pdf concluded that \\"Through the years many studies have shown that bicycle paths in built-up areas impair traffic safety. A new Danish study presented in this article confirms these results... the main results are that bicycle paths impair traffic safety and this is mainly due to more accidents at intersections, and that there has been no improvement in the design of new bicycle paths compared to the older ones.\\" Researchers in other countries have pointed to risk implications of cycle tracks. In Germany, for instance, the Berlin police conducted a 1987 study which came to a negative conclusion about cycle tracks.Berlin Police Department study, 1987, in English translation and in the original German, with commentaries (accessed 8 July 2007) The German Cycling Federation at the 1990 V√©lo Secur conference on cyclingV√©lo Secur 90 - Issues of bicycling Safety. Report from the German Cycling Federation claimed \\"Because the separation of different types of traffic by means of sidepaths behind curbs makes excessive demands on users and leads to crashes, other solutions are being increasingly recommended for channeling bicycle traffic.\\" The cycle tracks in Berlin, however, were not removed and Berlin continues to have an extensive network of bicycle facilities on- and off-road, including cycle tracks.

Jensen, K.V. Andersen and E.D. Nielsen, Velo-city ‚Äò97 Barcelona, Spain In the United Kingdom, the UK Cycle Campaign Network made a 2007 statement that they know \\"of no evidence that cycle facilities and in particular cycle lanes, generally lead to safer conditions for cycling\\".Proposed revised Highway Code Response to the further changes to rules 61 and 63, Cycle Campaign Network, June 2006 British cycling safety educator John Franklin has argued that the vast majority of research implies increases in the rate and severity of car-bicycle collisions due to such segregation, based on an overview of studies published up to 1999. Crash types at arterials and junctions Motorist overtaking cyclist on arterial crashes One benefit of cycle tracks is the reduction of motorist- overtaking collisions. There are more rear impacts with cyclists in arterial/rural-type roads. When they occur in such circumstances, they are also associated with significantly increased risk of fatality. Rear-end type collisions by overtaking motorists who didn't see the cyclist (Type 13 in the Cross-Fisher study) have been characterized as negligibly few in one analysis by John Forester and another analysis by Kenneth Cross characterized them as being the most deadly of crashes ‚Äì three times the fatalities of other crash types (both used the same data). All motorist overtaking crashes were combined by Cross into a category called \\"Problem Class D‚ÄìMotorist Overtaking/Overtaking Threat\\" accounting for 37.8% of fatal crashes and 10.5% of non-fatal crashes in their study. One possible explanation for the low overall number of collisions is that motorists coming from behind have plenty of time to see and avoid the collision, but another \\"possible explanation for the low number of overtaking collisions is that, as noted earlier, bicyclists fear and avoid roads where the overtaking threat seems greatest\\". Though such crashes were not in the majority they both had a perception of being quite dangerous by the majority of cyclists as well as having a high percentage of the fatal crashes.Chapter 2 Car-Bike Crashes 1 Those Bothersome Bumps From Behind, Listening to Bike Lanes Jeffrey A Hiles, September 1996. (accessed 12 June 2006) In the UK, cycling collision data recorded by police indicates that at non-junction locations, where a cyclist was struck directly from behind there was an overall fatality rate of 17%. The rate of fatality increases with speed limit of the road: *5% on , *13% on , *21% on and *31% on roads. The use of appropriately designed segregated space on arterial or interurban routes appears to be associated with reductions in overall risk. In Ireland, the provision of hard shoulders on interurban routes in the 1970s reportedly resulted in a 50% decrease in accidents. It is reported that the Danes have also found that separate cycle tracks lead to a reduction in rural collisions.Collection of Cycle Concepts , Danish Roads Directorate, Copenhagen, 2000  Crashes at intersections/junctions  Remedial measures have been developed in an attempt to reduce the risk of junctions for cycle tracks. In some environments these represent established engineering practice while in others they may have to be retroactively applied in response to complaints and safety concerns. Examples include the addition of a separate system of traffic signals for bicycle traffic; markings ‚Äì either coloured or sharrows continued through the intersection; bike boxes with no right turn on red lights for motorists, raised intersections, and elimination of car parking or the barrier as the cycle track approaches the intersection. Some treatments involve raising the cycle track onto a speed ramp-type structure where it crosses side roads. In addition, various road markings have been developed in an attempt to remedy the issue of increased junction collisions. Examples of these include the use of special road markings, e.g. \\"sharks teeth\\" or \\"elephants footprints\\", and treatments using red, green or blue coloured tarmac. Other approaches include efforts to \\"traffic calm\\" the bicycle traffic by introducing tight curves or bends to slow the cyclists down as they near a junction. Alternatively, traffic engineers may remove priority from the cyclists and require them to yield to turning traffic at every side road. In 2002, engineers proposing a sidepath scheme in the Irish university city of Galway stated that cyclists would be required to dismount and \\"become pedestrians\\" at every junction on the finished route. Protected intersection design based on a common Dutch model, preserving the physical segregation of the cycle lane throughout the intersection. A common Dutch model for improving the safety of cycle tracks at junctions involves separating cars turning right by a car length from crossing cyclists and pedestrians, providing increased reaction times and visibility. Alta Planning & Design popularized this as the \\"protected intersection\\" model. The majority of crashes take place at junctions so there is a risk of crashes where cycle paths meet roads. In the Crash-Type Manual by Tan (following a similar categorization to Cross-Fisher) the majority (approximately 2/3) of all crashes on urban roads occurred at junctions.Crash-Type Manual for Bicyclists by Carol Tan, Turner Fairbank Highway Research Center FHWA-RD-96-104, 1996.

Relative risks of crossing an intersection. Crossing on a set-back cycle path was found to be up to 11.9 times more risky in one study than straight crossing on a road. When the path entrance is set back from the road, motorists often have difficulty seeing cyclists approaching from the path. Research presented at a conference at Lund University in 1990 found that \\"crash risk\\" for cycle users crossing the intersection on a set-back path are up to 11.9 times higher than when cycling on the roadway in a bike lane (see diagrams).\\"Russian roulette\\" on sidepaths ‚Äì sidepaths are the target of criticism ‚Äì Rauh, W. (ARGUS Vienna), p. 78 of the proceedings of the Velo Secur 90 conference, Issues of Bicycling Safety, Lund University, 1990 Roundabouts and cycle lanes/tracks In the United Kingdom and Germany there is some concern to the use of cycle lanes in large urban roundabouts, though it is still common to see such facilities in the Netherlands and elsewhere. In 2002, cycle lanes were removed from a roundabout in the English town of Weymouth after 20 months because the casualty rate had increased significantly, according to the local cycling campaign. German research has indicated that cyclists are safer negotiating roundabouts in traffic rather than on separate cycle lanes or cycle paths.

Bundesanstalt f√ºr Strassenwesen BASt, Bergisch Gladbach, 1992 A recent paper on German roundabout design practice states \\"Cycle lanes at the peripheral margin of the circle are not allowed since they are very dangerous to cyclists\\".Roundabouts : A State of the Art in Germany, Werner Brilon, paper presented at the National Roundabout Conference, Vail, Colorado, USA, 22‚Äì25 May 2005 In the Netherlands, researchers focused on separating bicycle tracks from motorised traffic. They found that \\"roundabouts with separate bicycle tracks have a much lower number of casualties per roundabout than roundabouts with bicycle lanes, van Minnen (1995)\\".SWOV Factsheet: Roundabouts This meant that Dutch planners focused more on designing roundabouts and cycle tracks with appropriate priority rather than mix cyclists with other traffic or put them on cycle lanes at the edge. For adults, the standard advice in the vehicular cycling philosophy for handling roundabouts is to try to maintain a prominent position while circulating.Cyclecraft: Skilled Cycling Techniques for Adults, John Franklin, The Stationery Office Books, UK, 2004 The use of cycle lanes runs counter to this vehicular cycling approach and places cyclists outside the main \\"zone of observation\\" of entering motorists, who represent the major source risk.Pedal Cyclists at Roundabouts, Layfield R.E. and Maycock G., Traffic Engineering and Control, June 1986  Risk to pedestrians  The provision of bikeways may result in additional risk to pedestrians. This is particularly likely to be the case where cycle lanes are not readily distinguishable from pedestrian areas, e.g. due to the choice of surfacing or lane markers, or if the layout is confusing, or if the pedestrians area is inadequate for the numbers of people using the space. Pedestrians may easily stray into the cycle lanes without realising they have done so. Potential hazards arise where the cycle lane is bidirectional on the \\"wrong\\" side of the road, in which case the pedestrian crossing the cycle lane may look in the wrong direction, and at crossings where traffic lights apply to vehicles on the carriageway but not to the cycle lane. Although cyclists pose a risk to pedestrians, the risk for pedestrians is minor. In the United Kingdom, from 2012 to 2016, 2,120 pedestrians were killed by a vehicle ‚Äî 0.8% of these involved a bicycle and 66% involved a car.How many cyclists are killed each year?, fullfact.org (accessed 8 October 2019)  Indirect benefits  Safety in numbers effect There is evidence that one of the main factors influencing the individual safety of cyclists is the number of cyclists using the roads, commonly called the safety in numbers effect. Cycling facilities increase the perception of safety, leaving aside the evidence supporting or detracting from their actual risk. Cycling increases on routes with cycling facilities, particularly if they are separated cycle tracks. With greater numbers of cyclists in relation to motorists, the safety in number effect is seen. A wide ranging study by P L Jacobsen found that as cycling and walking increase, the chance that a given cyclist will be struck by a motor vehicle actually decreases. This pattern is consistent across communities of varying size, from specific intersections to cities and countries, and across time periods. Jacobsen found that doubling the number of cyclists on the road tends to bring about a 1/3 drop in the per-cyclist frequency of a crash with a motor vehicle. By the same token, tripling the rate of cycling cuts the crash rate in half. A study of the accident impacts of re-engineering bicycle crossings in the Swedish city of Gothenburg appears to corroborate those findings by attributing collision rate reductions in part to significant increases in cyclist volumes at the treated sites. Detractors argue that the most prominent examples of \\"successful\\" cycle networks were implemented in towns that already had significant numbers of cyclists.Getting rid of the Cyclists: Frank Urry and the 1938 DoT Advisory Committee by Jeremy Parker, Bikereader.com (accessed 27 January 2007) In the Netherlands, for example, drivers know to expect a high volume of cyclist traffic and bicycle paths are widespread and (in the cities) closed to scooters. Due to this expectation, some argue, the number of car-bike collisions with serious consequences is not alarmingly high in the Netherlands. In such cases, it is speculated that an existing large cycling population might already exert a \\"safety in numbers\\" effect, and it is this, rather than their diversion onto off-road tracks, that accounts for the better safety record. More people might start cycling if the perceived safety of doing so improved sufficiently. Health benefits In addition, it has been shown that in western countries the health benefits of regular cycling significantly outweigh the risks due to traffic danger.Cycling Towards Health and Safety, Hillman et al., British Medical Association, Oxford University Press, 1992Briefing Note: The Health Benefits of Cycling, Adam Coffman, Cyclists Touring Club (accessed 8 June 2007) Therefore, notwithstanding their effect on crashes and injuries, measures that promote cycling should produce an overall societal health benefit. Dutch analysts have argued as a statistical exercise that given that three times as many cyclists as car occupants are injured in collisions, and that cars harm about three times the number of other road users that bicycles do, in situations where casualties due to car traffic predominate, increasing the number of cycling journeys and reducing the number of car journeys will reduce the total number of casualties With the number of cyclists growing due to the bike lanes, it would create less pollution in the air, reducing health problems such as asthma, especially for those most at risk such as children.

It was built . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The single-storey, Federation brick villa, \\"To-Me-Ree\\", is one of four houses George Williams built on the southern side of Denmark Hill around 1910. Williams and his wife lived opposite \\"To-Me-Ree\\", at \\"Almondsbury\\", a brick house with steeply pitched gables similar in style to \\"To-Me-Ree\\". Williams' daughter, Nellie (Mary Ellen), and her husband, Sydney May, lived at \\"To-Me- Ree\\". The name \\"To-Me-Ree\\" stems from May's interest in Aboriginal words and is thought to relate to Port Stephens headland. It is said that May had an extensive collection of Aboriginal artefacts which he displayed in the west room converted from the side verandah. The collection of Artefacts were donated to the Ipswich Art Gallery and are now on display there. May moved to Ipswich in 1905 to be organist and choir master at the Ipswich Congregational Church. He also lectured at the University of Queensland's school of music and initiated music summer schools. A bush house and rock garden were maintained during the May's time, and their garden was an attraction for city visitors. Sydney May died in 1968, Nellie May died in 1972 and one of their daughters, Barbara, continued living at \\"To-Me-Ree\\" until her death in 1980. The house is a fine example of the affluent settlement around Denmark Hill which continued from the latter 19th century into the early 20th century. The house is situated amongst grand residences and substantial brick and timber dwellings which give the area a cohesive character  Description  Residence in 2015 \\"To-Me-Ree\\" stands on the north-west corner of Moffat and Macalister Streets on the southern side of Denmark Hill with extensive southern views. \\"To-Me- Ree\\" is a substantial, brick villa with a complex gabled roof-line. Its southern facade has two projecting gables, connected by a verandah which has been enclosed with boarding and coloured glass casement windows. The gables each have round ventilator \\"windows\\" and decorative timber pediments and finials. Each of the gables has cream render quoins which contrast with the home's red brick body. One of the gables has a projecting bay window, with its own three-sided roofing. The chimney is made from a decorative combination of red, cream and ash coloured bricks. A verandah on the eastern side of the house is supported by timber posts with moulded capitals and elegantly plain, timber brackets and valance. The verandah wraps around to the rear of the house where a pergola extends from the roofline over a large square rockery. The pergola is supported by ornate Italianate pillars on the eastern side. The rockery is bounded at the rear by the driveway which has original decorative iron gates to Macalister Street. Beyond the driveway to the rear of the property is the garden with evidence of a previous structure amongst the established plantings. The southern and eastern sides of the property are surrounded by an original low brick wall including an original decorative single iron gate displaying the name \\"To-Me-Ree\\" fronting Macalister Street which leads to the front verandah steps. The entrance to the interior is via a door on the eastern verandah which is surrounded by coloured, patterned glass (matching the glass on the verandah enclosure facing Moffat Street). The entrance leads into a hall-way, with a central timber arch, which extends to the rear of the house with rooms extending from either side. The kitchen is in the south-western corner of the house which still displays one of two central fireplaces. The other fireplace is in a mirrored position in the living room on the opposite side of the wall to the kitchen fireplace. A room on the Western side of the house is an enclosed verandah which leads to the bathroom and laundry in their original positions on the north-west corner of the house.  Heritage listing  Ipswich City Council plaque To-Me-Ree was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. To-Me-Ree is important in demonstrating the pattern affluent suburban development around Denmark Hill in Ipswich from the late nineteenth century to the early twentieth century. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. It has high aesthetic value as a Federation brick villa which displays fine building and detailing and is part of a group of four house similar in style but architecturally atypical in the area. It also presents high streetscape value being on a prominent corner block on the southern side of Denmark Hill surrounded by substantial houses of varying ages and design. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. It has special association with the May family who occupied the house from its construction in 1910 until 1980, in particular Sydney May, a lecturer in Music at the University of Queensland, who was an active member of Ipswich society contributing to the musical life of the city.

It was built . It is also known as William Berry residence. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The residence at 1 Burnett Street, West Ipswich, is a brick house built for William Berry. The allotment on which this residence is situated was first purchased on 11 May 1855 as allotment 101, parish of Ipswich, county Stanley (1r 32.5p), by William Berry at a cost of ¬£35. Berry was an Ipswich district farmer who was born in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, and by 1843 was resident in the Moreton Bay region. In March of that year he was one of the signatories to a petition to Sir George Gipps, Governor of New South Wales, requesting the sale of Crown Lands in the Moreton Bay area to be transferred from Sydney to Brisbane where the petitioners, \\"being Men of limited Capital\\", could afford to attend to purchase allotments. The appeal proved to no avail and in the subsequent Crown auction held in Sydney on 11 October 1843 Berry was among the first purchasers of Ipswich allotments. It is not clear exactly when Berry moved to Ipswich, however he was reputedly living there by 1848 and quickly acquired a distinct local patriotism. In 1849, he signed a petition that urged the then New South Wales Governor, Sir Charles Augustus Fitzroy, not to introduce more than a fair proportion of Crown prisoners to the Ipswich and Moreton Bay region on the grounds that their presence in the area would reduce the future prosperity of the district. Twelve years later Berry was again placing his signature to a petition, this time objecting to the incorporation of Ipswich as a municipality, which the petitioners believed \\"would be impolitic and injurious to the interests of the inhabitants\\". Although extant records indicate Berry was a farmer by occupation, it is known that he was also a land owner and was referred to in his death documents as a freeholder. Between 1852 and 1854 he purchased three town lots in Cleveland, Brisbane, and in August 1866 the title to 2 Burnett Street was transferred to Berry. By 1870, Berry had also acquired Lots 98 and 99 next to 2 Burnett Street, and the area generally became known as Berry's Hill. Ipswich Municipal Council Valuation Registers indicate he utilized these allotments as his garden and he resided in a modest timber cottage at 1 Burnett Street until when Council records show a brick house was built on the property. The construction of this larger residence was indicative of both Berry's burgeoning financial status and the increasing economic prosperity of the Ipswich region during the mid to late 1870s. It was an impressive house which Berry described, in an advertisement for sale in September 1886, as having a slate roof, eight rooms, kitchen, servant's room, bathroom and bath, large underground tank, two-stalled stable, buggy shed, wash house and other offices. In April the following year, Berry died suddenly at his Burnett Street house, aged 76 years. Following Berry's death the property was held in trust by his wife, Margaret Berry, and George Miles Challinor, a clerk of Esk, until July 1889 when title to the land was transferred to William Berry's son, Alexander, although Margaret Berry appears to have remained as occupant of the house. By March 1900, title to the property had been transferred to Paul Marcel Terlier who retained title to the property until 1945. During this period the allotment was subdivided, with one subdivision sold to the then owners of 2 Burnett Street, Sophia Helena Lewis and Norman Lewis, for use as a garden. The house remained on a reduced parcel of 24 perches and four-tenths of a perch. It was also during Terlier's ownership of 1 Burnett Street that the house was reputedly divided into flats and the verandahs enclosed with fibro sheeting. In the 30 years after 1945, the property passed between 5 owners, until 1974 when it was registered in the name of Allan and Lily Maude Whybird. Allan Whybird had served as an alderman on the Ipswich City Council in 1964 and as Deputy Mayor between 1970 and 1973. He was also the grandson of John Whybird who established the first removalist company in Ipswich in 1857. The Whybirds carried out some internal renovations during their 10 years of ownership and replaced the original balustrading on the upper verandah with cast iron inserts obtained from the local branch of the Bank of New South Wales, which was demolished in the second half of the 20th century. By 1984, the property was used as a shelter for homeless youths and was owned by the Ipswich Independent Youth Service, before passing into the hands of new owners, who restored the building to its original function as a family home.  Description  The house at 1 Burnett Street sits on a compact allotment, at a corner with Omar Street, approximately from Ipswich town centre. It occupies a prominent position on a hill overlooking a wide expanse of the town. It is clearly visible at a distance when travelling along Limestone St and from the northern end of Burnett St where Ipswich Grammar School is located. There are a number of other houses on the eastern section of Burnett Street that are entered on Queensland's Heritage Register, including Idavine on the adjacent allotment and Notnel at 6 Burnett Street. Across the street, a number of timber vernacular cottages have been converted into a single restaurant. Building in 2015 The original house of rendered and painted brick is sited in the front eastern corner of the 617 sqm lot. The render has been scored to create the illusion of large masonry blocks. Its main roof is hipped with a short-ridge and sheeted in corrugated iron. The timber verandahs face the two streets with the eastern verandah edge sitting on the fence-line and the other setback approximately . Their roof is continuous with the main roof at a slightly reduced pitch. The upper storey's balustrading is cast iron obtained from elsewhere by the Whybirds. A number of balusters are missing, and some aluminium frieze pieces have been fitted around the lower storey. A photo taken late in the 19th century shows the original verandah edge made up of simple timber columns with capitals, carved brackets and horizontal pieces between them. One chimneystack protrudes from the main roof at the eastern end of the ridge and there is a lone acroteria decorating it. There is also a lone decorated soldered rainwater head fitted to the western face. A flight of stairs rise through the vernadah space overlooking Omar Street. They were likely built in the period prior to the end of the Second World War when the house was converted to flats. The stairs are screened with lattice and run between the two window rows on this facade. One end of the gable-roofed, single storey kitchen abuts the main house on its southern facade. Its eastern face is in line with that of the main house. The steeply pitched corrugated iron roof has no overhang with the fascia fixed to the outer wall. This structure has painted brick walls and two hooded windows facing Omar Street and the east. The hoods are skillion with timber battening to the sides and a carved timber piece to the front. The two upper storey rear windows also have these hoods. The kitchen windows are sash with 6 panes in each leaf. A sunroom, laundry and covered patio separate the kitchen structure from the small square of garden to the house's west facing the neighbouring property. The sunroom's walls appear to follow a similar scheme to the main house using scored render. A steel sheeted skillion roof (Lysaght Klip-Lok profile) covers both, having no gutters. Access to the tiled lower-storey verandah is gained from Burnett Street up a short flight of concrete stairs. The front door has a pivoting glass fanlight and opens onto a central hallway divided in two by an arched opening. The walls are plastered brick and a scraping has revealed a two-part colour scheme (light green atop dark, separated by a thin maroon band). Two rooms open to each side of this hallway. A set of stairs begins at its end and an opening to the sunroom fits under them. To the right are the living and dining spaces, which are joined by a broad archway. There is evidence that this wall was originally complete and featured a two-way fireplace, matching that which is found between the two rooms opening to the left of the hall. A section of brick chimneystack remains within the roof space. The ceilings are in height and lined with wide beaded tongue-and-groove boarding. The boarding features a central dummy bead. The hallway's ceiling is lined in a similar manner. A fibro sheet ceiling has been removed to reveal the ceilings boards, 2-part cornices and picture rail fitted at . The walls are plaster with a shaped timber skirting, matching the other rooms on this level of the main house. One window opens to the front and back of the house. They, as are all the others in the 8 main rooms are sash with 4 panes in each leaf. The windows and doors throughout feature painted timber architraves and reveals. The floors in the hallway, dining and living rooms are pine boards. The two rooms opening to the left off the hallway are yet to have their fibro sheet ceilings removed. The mantelpiece to the fireplace in the front room is possibly polished Cedar, while the opposite one has been painted. It consists of a simple mantel top supported by two columns in relief. The arched cast register grates are still in place, the front rooms' being painted white. In the rear room, used as a bedroom, the brick hearth extends some with slates laid under the grate. The front room's hearth appears to be stone or concrete. The stairs have been sanded back in places and appear to be made of Hoop Pine. They complete a 180 degree turn in making their way to the upper storey. Its layout reflects exactly that found below. The outer stringer is not continuous at the bend, suggesting some change has been made. A high window overlooks the stairwell. All internal walls are plaster as the ones below are. However the internal wall corresponding to that which separates the hall and living room below, has been breached to reveal boarding that matches the ceilings downstairs. There is matching joinery to all windows and doors. The room above the dining room has been converted into a bathroom. All ceilings are lined with fibro sheeting. They slope down to meet each external wall in a wide zone. The upper storey hall opens via a door onto the verandah. It is reported that the Whybirds lowered the level of this verandah, and this is evident in the three steps leading off this doorway. When this change occurred the original verandah timberwork was replaced. Bolts and nuts can be seen on the interior of certain walls where the verandah roof has been tied back. On the ground floor, from the rear of the central hallway opens the sunroom. To the left are two doors leading through a thick wall to the large kitchen. Above the doors are fixed frames of rough painted lattice. Its ceiling is lined as the living and dining rooms' are and is sloped at each side. The boards at the south end of the flat section of the ceiling are all cut at a distance of approximately from the wall. This might suggest the existence of an earlier hearth. In the sunroom, on the wall shared with the main part of the house is a faintly visible curved line suggesting a curved roof may have been removed when the skillion was constructed. The line stops short of the current width of the sunroom.  Grounds  The fences to both streets consist of small columns and a base of concrete blocks cast to resemble rough-hewn stone. They are capped by red clay-bricks with bullnose edges that are laid stretcher face down. Between the columns of the Omar Street fence are fitted painted steel frames with bracing. A two-storey pavilion, said to have been built by the Whybirds, occupies the rear western corner of the allotment, which is believed to be previously the site of the stables. On the ground floor is a double garage accessed by a driveway coming off Omar Street. Above this are bedrooms.

Heritage listing  The William Berry residence was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The residence at 1 Burnett Street was constructed and is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history in that it is representative of the burgeoning economic fortunes of the Ipswich region during the mid to late 1870s. The original owner of the residence was a farmer and the construction of this large brick house is indicative of the prospect of rising social and financial status offered to early settlers as Ipswich developed into a wealthy commercial and industrial centre of Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The house also assumes a prominent position in the Burnett Street area and is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places and because of its aesthetic significance. The house remains a well- preserved example of 1870s residential architecture and contributes to the overall historical character of the Burnett Street precinct. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. With its rich historical milieu, Ipswich abounds with significant examples of early Queensland housing and architecture and as such this residence represents an important landmark in the local area and forms an integral part of the overall streetscape of the city.

Other dissenters say safety is better served by using the road space for parking.  Context controversy  Some detractors argue that one must be careful in interpreting the operation of dedicated or segregated bikeways/cycle facilities across different designs and contexts; what works for the Netherlands won't necessarily work elsewhere. Proponents argue that segregated cycle facilities have been implemented and are both popular and safe. The Netherlands, detractors argue, is a flat country and the compact design of Dutch towns keeps cycling distances short as reflected in the Dutch people's choice of bicycle, i.e. the typical Dutch roadster, which has either no gears or a three-speed hub gear and back pedal brakes. Other countries may have different common urban designs, such as sprawling suburbs, and different cycling cultures where riders may ride bicycles with a wider range of gears and like to travel more quickly, such as those who cycle regularly for sport and exercise, who may choose to ride to incorporate some aerobic exercise into their day. So, while a sidepath system may work for slower cyclists, detractors argue, they might not work for cyclists using faster bicycle types who cannot use such a system safely at their higher normal cycling speeds.The Bikeway Controversy, J Forester, Transportation Quarterly, Vol 55 No 2. Spring 2001 However, this is contradicted by members of the Royal Dutch Cycling Union, who state that Dutch competitive cyclists have no problems with training in the Netherlands.

There are instances where cycle tracks / sidepaths can accommodate fast cycling as evidenced in this video of a velomobile on a Dutch cycle track. As more cycle tracks are built in North American cities, more research is being conducted on the uptake and safety of cycle tracks. North American cities that have recently installed cycle tracks have seen significant growth in cyclists using these roads.More people cycling, thanks to bike paths , posted by Monique Beaudin, Montreal Gazette. 24 Dec. 2010. It is useful, therefore, to use North American examples of cycle tracks/side paths and compare them to similar roads used by cyclists. This will provide better data using cyclists on similar terrain and presumably similar bicycles and experience. A minivan merging into cycling traffic on Foothill Expressway in Los Altos, California. Cycling activists in favour of vehicular cycling have opposed cycle tracks and paths on the principle that they might not be created with the \\"fast cyclist type\\" in mind. The UK‚Äôs Sustrans guidelines for the National Cycle Network are based on recreational use with a design user who is an unaccompanied twelve-year- old. The Dublin Transportation Office has advertised their cycle facilities as being based on an unaccompanied ten-year-old design user. This raises the issue of what happens if different cyclist types find themselves forced onto such devices either by legal coercion or as a result of motorist aggression. This issue is captured in a 1996 review of the Sustrans approach from the Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers. > The fast cycle commuter must not be driven off the highway onto a route that > is designed for a 12-year-old or a novice on a leisure trip, because if that > happens, the whole attempt to enlarge the use of the bicycle will have > failedBook reviews, The National Cycle Network-guidelines and practical > details, M.N.

Some locales have issues with debris in the cycle paths, such as Milton Keynes, UK, finding that cycle path users are seven times more likely to get punctures than are road cyclists.Two decades of the Redway cycle paths of Milton Keynes, J. Franklin. Traffic Engineering and Control, August 1999. In Ireland some cyclists have demanded simultaneous commitment to maintenance and sweeping as cycle paths are built. Achieving a Cycling-Friendly Ireland: A National Cycling Promotion Policy Version 1.1, Cyclist.ie 19 October 2008. In areas subject to high leaf-fall in autumn, or high snowfall in winter, any cycle facilities must be subject to regular clearing if they are to remain usable. Danish guidance specifies three different categories of cycle track. Category \\"A\\" tracks must be kept clear of snow 24 hours a day, category \\"B\\" tracks are swept or cleared daily, and category \\"C\\" receive less regular winter maintenance. In 2007 the city of Copenhagen spent DKK 9.9 million (US$1.72 million, ‚Ç¨1.33 million) annually on maintaining its cycle track network. German federal law requires local authorities to declassify cycle tracks that do not conform to strict design and maintenance criteria.New rights for cyclists, Allgemeine Deutsche Fahrrad Club (ADFC), November, 1997 In the UK, facilities for non-motorized traffic are not normally salted or gritted in icy conditions, potentially making them dangerous or unrideable. Cycle lanes avoid this problem, as they are part of the road and can be easily accessed by maintenance vehicles operating on that road, incurring no extra cost. They only becomes filled with debris if the road is not maintained or the lane is purposely avoided. Tracks used at night can be illuminated by conventional means, or by paving with glowing material.Britain Experiments with Glowing Bike Lanes by John Metcalf, Atlantic Cities  Usage controversy  Copenhagen inner city cycle traffic peak hour There are many factors, such as cycle tracks and other cycling infrastructure, which contribute to cycling levels. A number of cities have demonstrated that particular cycle tracks will increase bike traffic on those routes, as shown, for example, in Montreal, New York City and Copenhagen. Bike usage increased by 40% in areas of Montreal where the city invested in bike paths and lanes. In Copenhagen bike traffic increased by about 20% because of the construction of cycle tracks.Road safety and perceived risk of cycle facilities in Copenhagen , S.U. Jensen, C. Rosenkilde, N Jensen, Road & Park, City of Copenhagen, Presentation to European Cycling Federation AGM 2006 The construction of separated bike lanes on Dunsmuir Street and Viaduct in Vancouver, Canada, saw bike traffic volumes on the street more than double from before the construction.Dunsmuir Results.

NYC likewise saw cycling rates nearly triple on weekdays and doubled on weekends when the bike path was installed alongside Prospect Park West.Prospect Park West Bicycle Path and Traffic Calming NYC Department of Transportation. Accessed on 7 February 2011 Seville, Spain, is an example of what is possible on a city scale when a large investment is made in cycling infrastructure over a short period of time. In 2006 there were around 6000 bike trips made daily in the city of around 700,000. By 2009 there were about 50,000 daily bike trips. During those three years 8 urban bike paths totaling 70 km were built; the city centre was closed to motorised traffic; school projects were funded to create safe school paths; traffic calming measures were provided in school districts and the bicycle sharing system ‚ÄòSevici‚Äô was launched. The combination of all these factors helped to create a dramatic change in cycling rates.Promotion of Cycling Directorate General for Internal Policies, Structural and Cohesion Policies. European Parliament, 2010. Retrieved 13 February 2011. After a certain trip modal share it may take more than just installing cycle tracks to create large increases in cycle rates. Cycling rates in the Netherlands peaked in the 1960s and dropped dramatically until the mid-1970s. The decline in bicycle use was \\"not only caused by mass motorization but also by the related, fairly unco-ordinated process of urbanization and by scores of social, spatial and economic developments\\", such as a decrease in population density and increased travel distances. The bicycle was almost completely left out of the national government's vision. Certain cities, however, such as Amsterdam and Eindhoven, were slowly implementing more bicycle-positive policies: for example, bike-only streets and allowing cyclists to ignore one way streets. Throughout the 70s cycling rates increased, but the investments in bike paths made in the subsequent period had less effect. Between the late 1980s and early 1990s the Netherlands spent 1.5 billion guilders (US$945 million) on cycling infrastructure, yet cycling levels stayed practically the same.The autumn of the Bicycle Master Plan: after the plans, the products. Ton Welleman, Dutch Ministry of Transport, Velo-city conference Basle, 1995 When the flagship Delft Bicycle Route project was evaluated, the Institute for Road Safety Research claimed that the results were \\"not very positive: bicycle use had not increased, neither had the road safety. A route network of bicycle facilities has, apparently, no added value for bicycle use or road safety\\".SWOV Fact sheet Bicycle facilities on road segments and intersections of distributor roads, SWOV Institute for Road Safety, Leidschendam, Netherlands, October 2004 The study by Louisse, C.J. et al. however, did find that \\"[a]lthough the total number of victims among cyclists did not decline, the percentage of fatalities and severely injured did drop dramatically.\\"Louisse, C.J.; Grotenhuis, D.H. ten & Vliet, J.M.C. van (1994).

A more comprehensive policy change in addition to bicycle routes, on the other hand, helped to raise the cycling rates in Groningen where 75% of all traffic is by bike or foot. Groningen focused on land use policy, city planning and economic policy changes to achieve very high cycling rates. In the UK, a ten-year study of the effect of cycle facilities in eight towns and cities found no evidence that they had resulted in any diversion from other transport modes.UK: Cycle Routes, Traffic Advisory Leaflet 5/95, UK Department for Transport, 1995 The construction of of \\"Strategic cycle network\\" in Dublin has been accompanied by a 15% fall in commuter cycling and 40% falls in cycling by second and third level students. In some locales bike traffic increases first and bike paths and lanes are installed in order to catch up to the demand. For instance, bike planning in Davis, California was driven by the prior existence of a \\"dramatic volume\\" of cyclists in the 1960s.Comprehensive Bicycle Plan, City of Davis Public Works Department, May, 2001 Research on the German bicycle boom of the 1980s paints a picture of German local authorities struggling to keep up with the growth of cycling rather than this growth being driven by their interventions. In relation to the UK, it has been argued that locally high levels of cycling are more likely to result from factors other than cycle facilities. These include an existing cycling culture and historically high levels of cycle use, compact urban forms, lack of hills and lack of barriers such as high speed intersections.Assessing the Impact of Local Transport Policy Instruments Susan Grant-Muller (Editor), ITS Working Paper 549, Institute of Transport Studies, Leeds University, April 2000 However, Pucher and Buehler, U.S.-based researchers, have stated that \\"the provision of separate cycling facilities\\" appears to be one of the keys to the achieving of high levels of cycling in the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany.  Segregating cyclists controversy  In some cases, cycle paths have been constructed so bicycles could be prohibited from the main roadway. There is a debate among cyclists as to whether this is for the benefit of motorists or bicyclists. In 1996 the UK Cyclists' Touring Club and the Institute of Highways and Transportation jointly produced a set of Cycle-Friendly Infrastructure guidelines that placed segregated cycling facilities at the bottom of the hierarchy of measures designed to promote cycling.Cycle-Friendly Infrastructure: Guidelines for Planning and Design, Institution of Highways and Transportation, Cyclists Touring Club, 1996. Planners at the Directorate Infrastructure Traffic and Transporthttp://www.ivv.amsterdam.nl in Amsterdam place cyclists and motorists together on roads with speed limits at or below , and segregate them through bicycle lanes at higher limits. This is in a context where most of the measures prioritised by Cycle-Friendly Infrastructure (HGV restrictions, area-wide traffic calming, speed limit enforcement etc.) are already in place ‚Äì see Utility cycling for more detail.

It was designed by George Brockwell Gill and built in 1920 by Frank Williams & Co. It is also known as Esk Memorial Park. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Esk Memorial Park was proclaimed a reserve for memorial purposes in 1979, but a First World War memorial has stood on the site, at the intersection of Highland and Ipswich Streets, since 1921. The memorial was commissioned by the Esk Patriotic Committee on behalf of the Shire of Esk. Subscriptions commenced in 1916, and tenders were called in April 1919 by prominent Ipswich architect George Brockwell Gill. The foundation stone was laid on 30 November 1920, and the memorial was unveiled on 28 September 1921 by General Lachlan Chisholm Wilson. The masonry work was carried out by the Ipswich firm of Frank Williams & Co., and the art metalwork was supplied by Wunderlich Ltd of Sydney. It cost . This was not the first war memorial in the shire. Colinton had erected an honour board at the local School of Arts building in 1916, and a stone memorial in 1917. The Toogoolawah War Memorial had been unveiled in March 1917. In 1983 the memorial park was extended, and a stone memorial to Captain Patrick Logan, commandant of the Moreton Bay Penal Settlement who was murdered while exploring the Brisbane Valley in 1830, was erected in the park in 1984. The site was landscaped in 1985. In 1988 some of the lettering on the First World War memorial was restored, and two plaques commemorating Australian sacrifice in post-1945 conflicts were affixed. In 1991 another plaque was attached, honouring those who fell in the Second World War.  Description  Esk Memorial Park Esk Memorial Park, which contains two stone monuments and landscaped paths and gardens, is located in the main street of Esk. The First World War memorial consists of a sandstone plinth with four ionic corner pilasters and an entablature sheeted in bronze. Recessed into each of the four faces is a marble tiled panel with a bronze honour roll of 462 shire residents who enlisted together with the letters AIF and its emblem. The memorial sits on a stepped base of concrete aggregate. Three bronze honour rolls bearing the names of 83 local men who fell during the First World War are fixed to the side and rear of the plinth. Four commemorative plaques bearing inscriptions 1939 ‚Äì World War II 1945, 1914 ‚Äì The Great War ‚Äì In Honour Of Our Boys ‚Äì 1919, Korea ‚Äì Malaya, and Borneo ‚Äì Vietnam are fixed to the front of the plinth. Also located within the park is a memorial to Captain Logan. This consists of a single, upright sandstone block. Fixed to the northern face is a bronze plaque bearing an inscription in white lettering. The park is landscaped with native trees and palms, and includes pathways, a barbecue area, seating and a children's playground.  Heritage listing  Esk War Memorial was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Esk War Memorial, erected in 1921, is important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history, being evidence of a widespread social movement expressing Australian patriotism and nationalism during and immediately following the First World War [1914‚Äì18]. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The First World War Memorial demonstrates the principal characteristics of a class of commemorative structures erected as a record of the local impact of a major historical event and intended to endure, and is a major regional example of its type. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The place exhibits aesthetic characteristics valued by the community, including the landmark quality and aesthetic value and craftsmanship of the First World War memorial, and the contribution of the park and memorial to the Esk townscape. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The place has a special association for the Esk community as a form of public recognition of local participation in a major historical event. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The memorial is significant as an unusual example of the work of Ipswich architect GB Gill.

In a racing career which lasted less than six months she won four of her six races. As a three-year-old in 1996 she won a Listed race on her debut and then finished third in the Poule d'Essai des Poulains before winning the Prix de Sandringham at Chantilly and the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot. She was narrowly beaten in the July Cup and ended her career with a six length win in the Prix du Rond Point. After being retired from racing she came a broodmare and produced several minor winners. Background Golden Opinion was a chestnut filly with white socks on her front feet bred in Kentucky by her owner, Sheikh Mohammed's Darley Stud. She was from the first crop of foals sired by Slew o' Gold an outstanding performer on dirt in the United States who won Eclipse Awards in 1983 and 1984. Golden Opinion was the first foal of her dam Optimistic Lass who showed top-class form in a brief racing career, winning the Musidora Stakes and the Nassau Stakes in 1984. She later produced Joyful, the grand-dam of the Irish 1,000 Guineas winner Samitar. Golden Opinion was sent to Europe and entered training with Andr√© Fabre in France. She was ridden in all of her races by Cash Asmussen. Racing career 1989: three-year-old season Golden Opinion was unraced as a two-year-old and never contested a maiden race, beginning her racing career with a win in the Listed Prix Montenica over 1600 metres at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse on 21 April. She was then stepped up to Group One class for the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches at Longchamp Racecourse on 14 May. She turned into the straight in fourth place before taking the lead 200 metres from the finish but was overtaken in the closing stages and finished third behind Pearl Bracelet and the Cheveley Park Stakes winner Pass the Peace. The unplaced runners included Tersa (Prix Morny), Oczy Czarnie (Prix de la Salamandre) and Mary Linoa (Prix Marcel Boussac). On 4 June, the filly started 3/5 favourite for the Group Three Prix de Sandringham at Chantilly Racecourse and won by three quarters of a length from Bubbling Danseuse. Seventeen days after her win at Chantilly, Golden Opinion was sent to England to contest the 140th renewal of the Coronation Stakes over one mile at Royal Ascot. She was made the 7/2 favourite in a twelve-runners field which included Tessla (Fillies' Mile), Aldbourne (third in the 1000 Guineas) and Comic Talent, the winner of her last five races. Asmussen tracked the leaders and was third on the final turn before making a challenge in the straight. Golden Opinion overtook the outsider Magic Gleam inside the final furlong and won by half a length, with a gap of four lengths back to Guest Artiste in third place. She was the first French-trained winner of the race since Barbaresque in 1960.French winners of Group One races in England In July the filly was dropped in distance as well as being matched against colts and older horses when he returned to England to contest the Group One July Cup over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse. Racing against specialised sprinters she started 11/4 second favourite behind the colt Danehill. She appeared to be outpaced in the early stages but finished strongly and failed by only a head to catch the four-year-old Cadeaux Genereux. Danehill was two and a half lengths away in third. After a late summer break, Golden Opinion returned in the Group Three Prix du Rond-Point over 1600 metres at Longchamp on 8 October. Starting the 2/5 favourite against eight opponents, she took the lead 200 metres from the finish and drew away in the closing stages to win \\"easily\\" by six lengths. Assessment In the official International Classification for 1989, Golden Opinion was the top-rated female racehorse of any age in Europe. Breeding record After her retirement from racing, Golden Opinion became a broodmare for her owner's Darley Stud. She produced at least ten foals and five minor winners between 1991 and 2007: *Sun Music, a bay colt, foaled in 1991, sired by Sadler's Wells. Failed to win in two races. *Legal Opinion, bay filly, 1993, by Polish Precedent. Failed to win in two races. *Meiosis, bay filly, 1997, by Danzig.

The park was built by Frank Williams & Co. It is also known as McConnel Park. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The site was established as a public park and recreational facility c.1906, on land donated by James Henry McConnel of Cressbrook. James' father, David Cannon McConnel, was the first European to settle in the Brisbane Valley, taking up the Cressbrook run in 1841. In the late 1890s, JH McConnel established a condensed milk factory on Cressbrook Creek, and subdivided a large part of the run into dairy farms and the township of Cressbrook Creek (later Toogoolawah). Such private town subdivisions were not unusual in Queensland; other towns originating in this manner include Beaudesert, Nambour and Childers. The McConnel family was deeply involved in the economic and social development of Toogoolawah, encouraging cultural, religious, sporting recreational and economic activity. They employed a contractor to build homes for their farmers; donated land for church purposes; and promoted a variety of district clubs, organisations and societies. Their establishment of a recreational facility in the centre of town remains testimony to the family's genuine concern for community welfare. In 1919 a brass band was formed in Toogoolawah, and about this time a small bandstand, understood to have been provided by the McConnel family, was erected in the recreational ground. By 1924 the park also contained a tennis court and a public shower, water for which was supplied from a public well and windmill on the site. A cricket pitch was laid down c.1930, and a Guide hut and Scout den were erected in the 1970s. The property was placed under trusteeship in 1926, and the Esk Shire Council became the trustees in 1940. The First World War stone memorial was commissioned by the citizens of Toogoolawah in 1916. It was crafted by Ipswich monumental masons Frank Williams & Co., who later supplied most of the First World War memorials in the district. The memorial, which cost ¬£300, was unveiled on 31 March 1917 by Rev Chaplain Merrington. It was the second such memorial erected in Queensland, and the first outside a cemetery. Originally the memorial enclosure was separated from the rest of the park by a picket fence. Gardens were laid out by 1921, and on Anzac Day that year a First World War gun was unveiled beside the memorial. A metal plate, honouring 15 local citizens who gave their lives in the Second World War, was attached to the memorial in 1955. In 1988 two additional plaques were attached commemorating those who had served in post-1945 conflicts. A cairn containing a time-capsule was placed in the park for the 1988 bi-centenary.  Description  McConnel Park is a 2.7 hectare site fronting Cressbrook Street to the east and Gunyah Street to the north, St Andrews Anglican Church precinct to the west and residential to the south. Access is via a bitumen drive from the western end of Gunyah Street which encircles the sportsground around to the south west. A row of trees lines the drive to the east and the entrance is between square gateposts. Next to these is a single-storeyed weatherboard library with a corrugated iron skillion roof. Two park benches with cast iron supports which contain the letters McCP are located here. The south east corner contains a First World War memorial, bandstand, pioneer memorial, barbecue, tennis courts and children's play equipment. The First World War memorial stands in a fenced enclosure fronting Cressbrook Street. It consists of a sandstone pedestal and obelisk standing on a stepped base of concrete and rock faced sandstone. Recessed into each side of the pedestal are First World War marble honour rolls. The entablature has egg and dart carving and the gable above features leaf carving. The east side of the base to the obelisk has a wreath with the words OUR BOYS HONOUR. Metal plaques have been added in remembrance of those who served in Korea, Malaya, Borneo and Vietnam. The memorial is surrounded by concrete paths with garden borders which lead from the north and east entrances. Two mature pencil pines border the east entrance with one at the north. A metal flagpole and two small pencil pines are situated on the west side and the perimeter has a low metal framed wire mesh fence. The octagonal timber bandstand sits on timber stumps and has a corrugated iron pitched roof with a central metal finial. The building features decorative timber brackets and valance with a perimeter seat against the railing. Access is via timber stairs to the north and the ceiling has plywood sheeting with timber cover strips. The Pioneer Memorial is a low square structure with sloping sides which is clad with slate tiles. It sits on a square slate tiled base and also contains a time capsule. To the south of the sportsground there is a concrete block public toilet with a skillion roof and a single-storeyed weatherboard Guide hut with timber stumps and a gabled roof. The Scout hut is located in the south west and consists of a single- storeyed slab-on-ground building with fibrous cement sheeting and a corrugated iron gabled roof. The sportsground contains a cricket pitch and mature trees to the perimeter.

Tiwanaku was one of the most significant Andean civilizations. Its influence extended into present-day Peru and Chile and lasted from around 550 to 1000 AD. Its capital was the monumental city of Tiwanaku, located at the center of the state's core area in the southern Lake Titicaca Basin. This area has clear evidence for large-scale agricultural production on raised fields that probably supported the urban population of the capital. Researchers debate whether these fields were administered by a bureaucratic state (top-down) or through collaboration of a segmented state or federation with local autonomy (bottom-up; see review of debate in Janusek 2004:57-73). One obsolete theory suggests that Tiwanaku was an expansive military empire, based on comparisons to the later Inca Empire, but supporting evidence is weak. Tiwanaku was a multi-cultural \\"hospitality state\\" that brought people together to build large monuments, perhaps as part of large religious festivals. This may have been the central dynamic that attracted people from hundreds of kilometers away, who may have traveled there as part of llama caravans to trade, make offerings, and honor the gods. Tiwanaku grew into the Andes' most important pilgrimage destination and one of the continent's largest Pre-Columbian cities, reaching a population of 10,000 to 20,000 around AD 800. Outside of the state's core area in the southern Lake Titicaca Basin, there were Tiwanaku colonies on the coast of Peru, where highland people imitated Tiwanaku temples and ceramics, and cemeteries in northern Chile with elaborate grave goods in the Tiwanaku style. Despite the clear connections to these enclaves, there is little evidence that the state controlled the territory or people in between, that is, its territory was not contiguous. With a few important exceptions, the state's influence outside the Lake Titicaca Basin was \\"soft power\\" that blossomed into a powerful, widespread, and enduring cultural hegemony. General view of Kalasasaya complex Ruins of Pumapunku complex Rise The site of Tiwanaku was founded around 110 AD during the Late Formative Period, when there were a number of growing settlements in the southern Lake Titicaca Basin. Between 450 and 550 AD, other large settlements were abandoned, leaving Tiwanaku as the pre-eminent center in the region. Beginning around 600 AD its population grew rapidly, probably due to a massive immigration from the surrounding countryside, and large parts of the city were built or remodeled. New and larger carved monoliths were erected, temples were built, and a standardized polychrome pottery style was produced on a massive scale. Closeup of a carved stone tenon-head embedded in wall of Tiwanaku's Semi-subterranean (Sunken) Temple Tiwanaku's influence, most clearly documented by the presence of its decorated ceramics, expanded into the Yungas and influenced many other cultures in Peru, Bolivia, and northern Argentina and Chile. Some statues at Tiwanaku were taken from other regions, where the stones were placed in a subordinate position to the Gods of the Tiwanaku. They displayed the power that their state had over others.Blom, Deborah E. and John W. Janusek. \\"Making Place: Humans as Dedications in Tiwanaku\\", World Archaeology (2004): 123‚Äì41. Archaeologists have documented Tiwanaku ceramics at a large number of sites in and beyond the Lake Titicaca Basin, attesting to the expansive influence of Tiwanaku symbols and attached messages of power. The population grew rapidly between 600 and 800, becoming an important regional power in the southern Andes. William H. Isbell states that \\"Tiahuanaco underwent a dramatic transformation between 600 and 700 that established new monumental standards for civic architecture and greatly increased the resident population.\\"Isbell, William H. 'Wari and Tiwanaku: International Identities in the Central Andean Middle Horizon'. 731-751. Early estimates suggested the city covered approximately 6.5 square kilometers at with 15,000 to 30,000 inhabitants. More recent surveys estimate the site's maximum size between 3.8 and 4.2 square kilometers and a population of 10,000 to 20,000. In the rest of the southern Lake Titicaca Basin, hundreds of smaller settlements have been found. Some of the largest and most important were Lukurmata, Qeya Kuntu, Kirawi, Waka Kala, Sonaji, Kala Uyuni, and Khonko Wankane. Colonies and diaspora Archaeologists such as Paul Goldstein have showed that the Tiwanaku diaspora expanded outside of the altiplano area and into the Moquegua Valley in Peru. After 750 AD, there is growing Tiwanaku presence at the Chen Chen site and the Omo site complex, where a ceremonial center was built. Excavations at Omo settlements show signs of similar architecture characteristic of Tiwanaku, such as a temple and terraced mound. Evidence of similar types of artificial cranial deformation in burials between the Omo site and the main site of Tiwanaku is also being used for this argument. Tiwanaku established several colonies as far as 300 km away. One of the better researched is the colony in Moquegua Valley in Peru, which is 150 km from lake Titicaca and flourished between 400 and 1100. This colony was an agricultural and mining center, producing copper and silver.Experience on the Frontier: A Tiwanaku Colony's Shifts Over Time Small colonies were also established in Chile's Azapa Valley. Agriculture Tiwanaku's location between the lake and dry highlands provided key resources of fish, wild birds, plants, and herding grounds for camelids, particularly llamas., 424 pp. Tiwanaku's economy was based on exploiting the resources of the lake Titicaca, herding of llamas and alpacas and organized farming in raised field systems. Llama meat was consumed and potatoes, quinoa, beans and maize grown. Storage of food was important in the uncertain high altitude climate, so technologies for freeze-dried potatoes and sun-dried meat were developed. The Titicaca Basin is the most productive environment in the area, with predictable and abundant rainfall. The Tiwanaku culture developed expanded farming. To the east, the Altiplano is an area of very dry arid land. The Tiwanaku developed a distinctive farming technique known as \\"flooded-raised field\\" agriculture (suka qullu). Such fields were used widely in regional agriculture, together with irrigated fields, pasture, terraced fields and artificial ponds. Water from Katari and Tiwanku rivers was used to water raised fields, that covered up to 130 square km. Artificially raised planting mounds were separated by shallow canals filled with water. The canals supply moisture for growing crops, but they also absorb heat from solar radiation during the day. This heat is gradually emitted during the bitterly cold nights and provided thermal insulation against the endemic frost in the region. Traces of similar landscape management have been found in the Llanos de Moxos region (Amazonian flood plains of the Moxos).. Over time, the canals also were used to farm edible fish. The resulting canal sludge was dredged for fertilizer. Though labor-intensive, a suka qullu produces impressive yields. While traditional agriculture in the region typically yields 2.4 metric tons of potatoes per hectare, and modern agriculture (with artificial fertilizers and pesticides) yields about 14.5 metric tons per hectare, suka qullu agriculture yields an average of 21 tons per hectare. Modern agricultural researchers have re- introduced the technique of suka qullu. Significantly, the experimental suka qullu fields recreated in the 1980s by University of Chicago¬¥s Alan Kolata and Oswaldo Rivera suffered only a 10% decrease in production following a 1988 freeze that killed 70-90% of the rest of the region's production.Kolata, Alan L. Valley of the Spirits: A Journey into the Lost Realm of the Aymara, Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley and Sons, 1996. Development by the Tiwanaku of this kind of protection against killing frosts in an agrarian civilization was invaluable to their growth. As the population grew, occupational niches developed, and people began to specialize in certain skills. There was an increase in artisans, who worked in pottery, jewelry and textiles. Like the later Incas, the Tiwanaku had few commercial or market institutions. Instead, the culture relied on elite redistribution.Smith, Michael E. (2004), \\"The Archaeology of Ancient Economies,\\" Annu. Rev. Anthrop. 33: 73-102. In this view of Tiwanaku as a bureaucratic state, elites controlled the economic output, but were expected to provide each commoner with all the resources needed to perform his or her function. Selected occupations include agriculturists, herders, pastoralists, etc. Such separation of occupations was accompanied by hierarchichal stratification.Bahn, Paul G. Lost Cities. New York: Welcome Rain, 1999. The elites gained their status by control of the surplus of food obtained from all regions, which they then redistributed among all the people. Control of llama herds became very significant to Tiwanaku. The animals were essential for transporting staple and prestige goods. Collapse Suddenly around 1000 AD, Tiwanaku ceramics stopped being produced as the state's largest colony (Moquegua) and the urban core of the capital were abandoned within a few decades. The end date for the Tiwanaku state is sometimes extended to 1150 AD, but this only considers raised fields, not urban occupation or ceramic production. One proposed explanation is that a severe drought rendered the raised-field systems ineffective, food surplus dropped, and with it, elite power, leading to state collapse. However, this narrative has been challenged, in part because of more refined cultural and climate chronologies, which now suggest that the drought did not start until 1020 or 1040 AD, shortly after the state's explosive collapse. This lends greater support to alternative theories of collapse that suggest social dynamics within the Tiwanaku state led to its demise. Some areas of the capital show signs of intentional destruction, though this could have taken place at any time. Monolithic gates, like Gateway of the Sun, were tipped over and broken. By the end of Tiwanaku V period the Putuni complex was burned and food storage jars smashed. This indicates an event of destruction, followed by abandonment of the site. Colonies in Moquegua and on Isla del Sol were also abandoned around this time.The Role of Silver Ore Reduction in Tiwanaku State Expansion Into Puno Bay, Peru It has been conjectured that the collapse of the Tiwanaku empire caused a southward migratory wave leading to a series of changes in Mapuche society in Chile.Dillehay, Tom D.; Pino Quivira, Mario; Bonzani, Ren√©e; Silva, Claudia; Wallner, Johannes; Le Quesne, Carlos (2007) Cultivated wetlands and emerging complexity in south-central Chile and long distance effects of climate change. Antiquity 81 (2007): 949‚Äì960 This explains how the Mapuche language obtained many loanwords from Puquina language including antu (sun), calcu (warlock), cuyen (moon), chadi (salt) and √±uque (mother). Tom Dillehay and co-workers suggest that the decline of Tiwanaku would have led to the spread of agricultural techniques into Mapuche lands in south-central Chile. These techniques include the raised fields of Budi Lake and the canalized fields found in Lumaco Valley.  Religion  Gateway of the Sun What is known of Tiwanaku religious beliefs is based on archaeological interpretation and some myths, which may have been passed down to the Incas and the Spanish. They seem to have worshipped many gods. The Gateway of the Sun is a monolithic structure of regular, non-monumental size. Its dimensions suggest that other regularly sized buildings existed at the site. It was found at Kalasasaya, but due to the similarity of other gateways found at Pumapunku, it is thought to have been originally part of a series of doorways there. It is recognized for its singular, great frieze. This is thought to represent a main deity figure surrounded by either calendar signs or natural forces for agricultural worship. Along with Viracocha, another statue is in the Gateway of the Sun. This statue is believed to be associated with the weather: It has twelve faces covered by a solar mask, and at the base thirty running or kneeling figures. Some scientists believe that this statue is a representation of the calendar with twelve months and thirty days in each month. Other evidence points to a system of ancestor worship at Tiwanaku. The preservation, use, and reconfiguration of mummy bundles and skeletal remains, as with the later Inca, may suggest that this is the case. Later cultures within the area made use of large \\"above ground burial chambers for the social elite... known as \\"chullpas\\". Similar, though smaller, structures were found within the site of Tiwanaku. Kolata suggests that, like the later Inca, the inhabitants of Tiwanaku may have practiced similar rituals and rites in relation to the dead. The Akapana East Building has evidence of ancestor burial. The human remains at Akapana East seem to be less for show and more for proper burial. The skeletons show many cut marks that were most likely made by defleshing or excarnation after death. The remains were then bundled up and buried rather than left out in the open. The Tiwanaku conducted human sacrifices on top of a building known as the Akapana. People were disemboweled and torn apart shortly after death and laid out for all to see. It is speculated that this ritual was a form of dedication to the gods. The type of human sacrifice included victims being hacked in pieces, dismembered, exposed to the elements and carnivores before being deposed in trash. Research showed that one man who was sacrificed was not a native to the Titicaca Basin, leaving room to think that sacrifices were most likely of people originally from other societies.  Architecture and art  Ponce stela in the sunken courtyard of the Tiwanaku's Kalasasaya temple  Architecture and sculpture  Tiwanaku monumental architecture is characterized by large stones of exceptional workmanship. In contrast to the masonry style of the later Inca, Tiwanaku stone architecture usually employs rectangular ashlar blocks laid in regular courses. Their monumental structures were frequently fitted with elaborate drainage systems. The drainage systems of the Akapana and Pumapunku structures include conduits composed of red sandstone blocks held together by ternary (copper/arsenic/nickel) bronze architectural cramps. The \`I\`-shaped architectural cramps of the Akapana were created by cold hammering of ingots. In contrast, the cramps of the Pumapunku were created by pouring molten metal into \`I\`-shaped sockets.Lechtman, Heather N., MacFarlane, and Andrew W., 2005, \\"La metalurgia del bronce en los Andes Sur Centrales: Tiwanaku y San Pedro de Atacama\\". Estudios Atacame√±os, vol. 30, pp. 7-27. The blocks have flat faces that do not need to be fitted upon placement because the grooves make it possible for the blocks to be shifted by ropes into place. The main architectural appeal of the site comes from the carved images and designs on some of these blocks, carved doorways, and giant stone monoliths.Isbell, W. H., 2004, Palaces and Politics in the Andean Middle Horizon. in S. T. Evans and J. Pillsbury, eds., pp. 191-246. Palaces of the Ancient New World. Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection Washington, D.C. The quarries that supplied the stone blocks for Tiwanaku lie at significant distances from this site. The red sandstone used in this site's structures has been determined by petrographic analysis to come from a quarry 10 kilometers away‚Äîa remarkable distance considering that the largest of these stones weighs 131 metric tons.Ponce Sangin√©s, C. and G. M. Terrazas, 1970, Acerca De La Procedencia Del Material L√≠tico De Los Monumentos De Tiwanaku. Publication no. 21. Academia Nacional de Ciencias de Bolivia. The green andesite stones that were used to create the most elaborate carvings and monoliths originate from the Copacabana peninsula, located across Lake Titicaca. One theory is that these giant andesite stones, which weigh over 40 tons, were transported some 90 kilometers across Lake Titicaca on reed boats, then laboriously dragged another 10 kilometers to the city.Harmon, P., 2002, \\"Experimental Archaeology, Interactive Dig, Archaeology Magazine, \\"Online Excavations\\" web page, Archaeology magazine. Tiwanaku sculpture is comprised typically of blocky, column-like figures with huge, flat square eyes, and detailed with shallow relief carving. They are often holding ritual objects, such as the Ponce Stela or the Bennett Monolith. Some have been found holding severed heads, such as the figure on the Akapana, who possibly represents a puma-shaman. These images suggest the culture practiced ritual human beheading. As additional evidence, headless skeletons have been found under the Akapana. Anthropomorphic receptacle  Other arts  The people of Tiwanaku also made ceramics and textiles, composed of bright colors and stepped patterns. Common textile forms included tapestries and tunics. An important ceramic artifact is the qiru, a drinking cup that was ritually smashed after ceremonies and placed with other goods in burials. Over time, the style of ceramics changed. The earliest ceramics were \\"coarsely polished, deeply incised brownware and a burnished polychrome incised ware\\". Later the Qeya style became popular during the Tiwanaku III phase, \\"Typified by vessels of a soft, light brown ceramic paste\\". These ceramics included libation bowls and bulbous-bottom vases.Bray, Tamara L. The Archaeology and Politics of Food and Feasting in Early States and Empires, New York: Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, 2003 The Staff God was a common motif in Tiwanaku art. The effigy objects typically depicted herders, trophy heads, sacrificial victims, and felines, such as puma and jaguars. Such small, portable objects of ritual religious meaning were a key to spreading religion and influence from the main site to the satellite centers. They were created in wood, engraved bone, and cloth and included incense burners, carved wooden hallucinogenic snuff tablets, and human portrait vessels. Like those of the Moche, Tiwanaku portraits expressed individual characteristics. One of the best collections of Tiwanaku human effigy vessels was found on the island of Pariti, a pilgrimage center in Lake Titicaca. These vessels bear individualistic human likenesses and reveal much information about Tiwanaku clothing and jewellery styles. Radiocarbon dating revealed that they were interred in the ground between 900 and 1050 AD, so they were probably broken as part of a ritual abandonment of the island's temple by local elites and pilgrims during the collapse of the Tiwanaku state.  Lukurmata  Lukurmata, located in the Katari valley was the second great city of the Tiwanaku state. Between 600 and 800 it expanded from 20 hectares to 120 hectares. First established nearly two thousand years ago, it grew to be a major ceremonial center in the Tiwanaku state, a polity that dominated the south-central Andes from 400 to 1200. After the Tiwanaku state collapsed, Lukurmata rapidly declined, becoming once again a small village. The site shows evidence of extensive occupation that antedates the Tiwanakan civilization. Relationship with Wari The Tiwanaku shared domination of the Middle Horizon with the Wari culture (based primarily in central and south Peru) although found to have built important sites in the north as well (Cerro Papato ruins). Their culture rose and fell around the same time; it was centered 500 miles north in the southern highlands of Peru. The relationship between the two polities is unknown. Definite interaction between the two is proved by their shared iconography in art. Significant elements of both of these styles (the split eye, trophy heads, and staff- bearing profile figures, for example) seem to have been derived from that of the earlier Pukara culture in the northern Titicaca Basin. The Tiwanaku created a powerful ideology, using previous Andean icons that were widespread throughout their sphere of influence. They used extensive trade routes and shamanistic art. Tiwanaku art consisted of legible, outlined figures depicted in curvilinear style with a naturalistic manner, while Wari art used the same symbols in a more abstract, rectilinear style with a militaristic style.

He was a founding member of the pre- Stonewall activist group, Queens Liberation Front and in the 1970s and 1980s published Drag magazine. Brewster helped to raise funds for the very first U.S. celebration of Pride, Christopher Street Liberation Day 1970. He continued to help raise funds and organize Christopher Street Liberation Day for several years. Lee Brewster was active in the homophile and gay liberation movements, working with the Mattachine Society of New York as well as the Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries.  Personal life  Lee Brewster was born in a log cabin in Honaker, Virginia on April 27, 1943. He was primarily raised in West Virginia, where his father was a coal miner. He moved to New York City in the 1960s after being fired from the Federal Bureau of Investigation for being a homosexual. Brewster died of cancer on May 19, 2000 in New York City. He was survived by a sister and three brothers.  Professional life  Brewster worked for the Federal Bureau of Investigation as a file clerk in the early 1960s, until he was fired for being a homosexual. In the 1970s and 1980s, he published Drag magazine.  Lee's Mardi Gras Boutique  Brewster owned Lee's Mardi Gras Boutique (now Michael Salem Boutique), a clothing store in a loft on West 14th Street in New York City's Greenwich Village. The store catered heavily to drag performers. He announced its opening on October 31, 1969 at a ball he was hosting. He described it as the first one devoted to cross-dressers. Initially the business was mail order based, but after so many people began coming directly to his apartment, he opened a store around the corner from his Hell's Kitchen apartment. It included a bookstore with a comprehensive collection of books on topics related to transvestites. The store moved several times before arriving at its location on West 14th Street. His boutique made efforts to provide privacy to its customers, including never having a street-level entry. However, some customers have been public about utilizing the store. Among its public and notable customers were Lady Bunny, and costume designers for The Birdcage, To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar, and Tootsie. Brewster described his clientele in an interview in The Village Voice saying, \\"Half of my clients are respectable-looking businessmen,\\" and that they were \\"very normal, but they know better than to present that side of themselves.\\"  Drag performances  Brewster staged numerous balls and often performed as a drag queen. Following the tradition of old-time drag performers, Brewster preferred to be called by male pronouns, rather than female pronouns, as has become more popular in modern time.  Activism  Brewster advocated for people who wanted to engage in cross-dressing, notably at times when this was an unpopular position in the LGBT movement in the United States. He became active in the Mattachine Society after moving to New York City in the 1960s, and was even nominated for the position of Secretary of the organization. He coordinated the organization's drag balls and fundraising events. Some members of the organizations disliked public cross-dressing, so he began holding the balls at the Diplomat Hotel on West 43rd Street. The balls, held from 1969 to 1973, became notable enough that the final one was attended by Carol Channing, Shirley MacLaine and Jacqueline Susann. In the 1970s, Brewster financed a successful legal challenge to a New York City ordinance that allowed people to be removed from public places because they were homosexuals. Though seldom enforced, he felt the regulation gave law enforcement an opportunity to harass LGBT people.  Queens Liberation Front  At his first ball in February 1969, he announced plans to form what would become known as the Queens Liberation Front, with October 31, 1969 to be its formal founding date. Lesbian Feminist Liberation opposed the performance by drag queens at the 1973 LGBT Pride March in New York City. As they passed out flyers, Sylvia Rivera, of Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries, took the microphone from emcee Vito Russo and spoke against the sentiment and spoke of the harassment and arrests of drag queens on the street, some of whom had been involved with the Stonewall riots. Lesbian Feminist Liberation's Jean O'Leary then insisted on responding by denouncing drag as misogynist and criticizing the march for being too male-dominated. This prompted Brewster to denounce anti-transgender lesbian feminists. The increasingly angry crowd only calmed when Bette Midler, who heard on the radio in her Greenwich Village apartment, arrived, took the microphone, and began singing \\"Friends\\". This was one of many events in early 1970s where lesbian and transgender activists clashed.  Collaboration with Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (S.T.A.R.)  = March on Albany = The Queens Liberation Front, including founders Lee Brewster and Bunny Eisenhower, joined with S.T.A.R. including Sylvia Rivera to lead a protest for the repeal of crossdressing laws in New York. They marched to the Capital in Albany, \\"...in support of the bills currently before the legislators in behalf of liberalized laws on homosexuality. Amongst them are bill for the repeal of impersonation laws...\\". The groups and their supporters travelled to Albany on four buses that had been chartered by the NY Gay Activists Alliance. Other notable protest attendees included Reverend Troy Perry. Drag Magazine includes two full pages of photographs from the protest, including Lee Brewster and Sylvia Rivera together holding their protest signs. = Panel Discussion with Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson = In 1972, Lee Brewster was part of a panel discussion on \\"transvestism\\" with S.T.A.R. representatives Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson and \\"Bebe\\" representing of the Queens College Group. The coverage of this event and a corresponding photograph of the panel can be found in Drag magazine Vol.2 No.7, near the end of the article on Male Prostitution.

Levine was one of the top players in Oak Park High School (California) basketball program's history. Levine was known as an excellent three-point shooter and was named Tri-Valley League (CIF) MVP in 2009 after his senior year. In 2013, Levine died after accidentally falling to his death at a hotel in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. After his death, Levine's friends and the University of Southern California have hosted events for charity in his honor. Early life and family Levine was born and raised in Oak Park, California. Levine is the son of Debra and Michael Levine. He was the youngest of three boys: Ryan, Andrew, and Samuel. Levine attended Brookside Elementary School and Medea Creek Middle School. In addition to being an athlete, Levine was also a drummer in a band with Bryan Lazar called The Bassix, and they had performed at Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza. High school Levine then attended Oak Park High School, where Levine played basketball for four years. Levine was also elected homecoming king at Oak Park High School (California) for four straight years. During his first year, Levine played on the junior varsity team where he was coached by Aaron Shaw. From 2006‚Äì2007, Levine played on the Oak Park basketball varsity team as a sophomore, and the team went 10‚Äì2. During his junior campaign, Levine made second team Tri-Valley League (CIF) honors. The Eagles made it to the CIF semi-final, playing Price High School. The Eagles were Tri-Valley League Champions. In 2009‚ÄîLevine's senior year‚ÄîLevine starred for the Eagles. Eleven players graduated from the 2008 varsity team, and Levine took a leadership role during the 2009 season. Levine averaged 17.1 points and six rebounds per game. After his 2009 campaign, Levine won the Tri-Valley League (CIF) Most Valuable Player award. Levine was known as an excellent three-point shooter, and came in second in a three-point shooting contest at the Battle of the Valley Skills Contest. Levine had the opportunity to play college basketball, but instead chose to pursue his dream of attending the University of Southern California. Levine became one of the best players in Oak Park's history. Levine's coach, Tim Chevalier, said of Levine's career: \\"Sam goes down as perhaps the best, pure (basketball) shooter in the history of Oak Park High.\\" After Levine's death, Oak Park High School (California) set up a basketball scholarship in his name. In 2015, OPHS will be retiring Levine's No. 12. College After graduating from high school, Levine attended Moorpark College for one year before transferring to USC in 2010. While at Moorpark, Levine worked as an assistant coach to the sophomore/freshman team at Oak Park High School. Levine was initially asked to be head coach of the freshman/sophomore team. Levine, however, wasn't sure he was ready at the age of eighteen, and he agreed to be an assistant coach under another former Oak Park High School Basketball player who graduated in 2000. University of Southern California Levine was a practice player on the USC Women's Basketball Team‚Äîhis second year‚Äîand was a marketing director for USC Trojans baseball his junior year. While at USC, Levine was an active member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. In 2012, Levine worked as an intern at several companies, including Wasserman Media Group and Lineage Interactive, which are sports and entertainment marketing agencies. Death In 2013, Levine died after falling six floors at a hotel in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, while on spring break from University of Southern California. The night before his funeral, his fraternity brothers at Sigma Chi held a memorial for Levine. On March 27, a funeral was held at St. Maximilian Kolbe Catholic Church in Westlake Village, California. Levine was well-regarded by members of his community. Levine's former basketball coach and the then-basketball coach at Ventura College, Joey Ramirez, gave the eulogy for Levine. Foundation and fundraising In January 2014, Levine's friends donated basketballs to children at the Boys and Girls Club in Claremont, California. On March 28, 2014, Bryan Lazar and other musicians gave the inaugural concert in Levine's name to raise funds for the Samuel Joseph Levine Memorial Trust Fund at USC. The money in the trust fund went toward the USC's Trojan Kids Camp. In December 2014, two of Sam's friends put together an event called \\"Excel like 12\\" in conjunction with A Better LA. A Better LA joined with USC to have a \\"Samuel Levine Memorial Day event.\\" They brought 90 children and their parents to a USC men's basketball game, got a tee-shirt with Excel Like 12, and a brand new basketball was given at the end of the game.

It was designed by John Henry Burley and built in 1917 by D A Menzies. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Inverness was erected in 1917 for the Nestle & Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company Limited, as the manager's residence associated with their Toogoolawah condensed milk factory. The enterprise had been established in 1898 by the McConnel family on part of their Cressbrook estate, and was known as the Cressbrook Dairy Company's Condensed Milk Factory. An early manager's residence of timber and iron was erected adjacent to the factory about the same time. The village of Cressbrook grew around the factory. With the arrival of the railway linking the town to Ipswich in 1904, the town expanded and was renamed Toogoolawah. In 1907 the Nestle & Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company bought out the Cressbrook Dairy Company, comprising the condensed milk factory and at least eight Cressbrook farms. At the time, Queensland was the only place in the world in which Nestle invested in company-owned farms. The factory was expanded and the number of employees doubled. Production rose during the First World War, and in 1917 a more prestigious company residence, Inverness, was erected on part of Nestle's Bellambi Farm, on the hill adjacent to the township. The large home reflected the manager's status in a prosperous factory town. It was designed by Brisbane architect John Henry Burley. His use of asbestos cement roofing tiles and interior wall sheeting was amongst the earliest application of these products in Queensland. The builder was local contractor DA Menzies, who erected most of the buildings constructed in Toogoolawah until the mid-1920s. The residence was occupied in 1917 by Archibald C Munro, manager of the factory from 1909 to 1931, and his family. The Munros named the house Inverness, after the district in Scotland from which AC Munro's father had emigrated. They employed a permanent gardener, cook and housemaid. Nestle closed the bulk of the factory in 1929, retaining some secondary production until December 1930. The farms were sold, and the population of Toogoolawah halved. The Munros left the manager's residence in 1931. During the Second World War, Nestle stored their Brisbane records in the old factory, and female staff were accommodated at Inverness. In 1948 the house was sold. It remains a private residence on just over . The factory was destroyed by fire in 1951, and the site was sold in 1956.  Description  Inverness is a large, single-storeyed timber house, situated on the hill top above Toogoolawah. The building shows influences of stylistic trends popular around Federation in the treatment of decorative elements. The hipped roof has projecting gables above the front entrance, side verandah entrance and billiards room. The roof features decorative eaves and gables with diamond patterned asbestos (Durabestos) shingles and decorative terra-cotta ridges and finials. The two chimneys are tapered and rendered. The building sits on timber stumps. Verandahs are situated on the eastern, northern and western elevations with tapered timber brackets and valances and vertical timber paling balustrading. Corners are treated differently, with verandah posts being closer together and the timber valance consisting of open vertical railing. The main entrance is approached from a circular drive to a double staircase and symmetrical entrance porch. The entrance features floral motif leadlight panels in the door and fanlight. Internal walls are clad in asbestos cement with timber cover strips, the patterns of which vary from room to room. Service rooms are clad in VJ boards. Internal doors feature fanlights above, and rooms open onto the verandahs via French doors. Rooms to the rear of the building have double-hung sash windows with window hoods of timber and Durabestos shingles. The entrance hall features a fireplace with timber surrounds and a decorative screen to the rear. Fireplaces also feature in the dining room and bedrooms one and two. A wall between the entrance hall and drawing room has been removed, and the kitchen layout has been altered. A laundry structure with a skillion roof is attached to the rear of the building with a brick cellar under the kitchen area.

It was built from 1876 to 1929. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 11 June 2003.  History  The former St Andrews Presbyterian Church is a simple timber building located on the south bank of Sandy Creek and was built in 1876 on the first site of the new settlement at Esk. The church site also contains a timber church hall and a manse. The town of Esk stands on the former Mount Esk pastoral run which was taken up in 1842 by Gideon Scot and purchased by the Bigges of Mount Brisbane run in 1849. European settlement began with a teamsters' camp at the crossing of Sandy (or Esk) Creek and the coach road north. This road became the main North Road from Ipswich to the Burnett. A township site was surveyed in 1872 on land excised from Mount Esk run and the first building known to have been constructed there was a hotel. In 1873, stimulated by a copper mining boom at nearby Biarra, plans for a township were lodged and a postal receiving office opened. The township was officially named \\"Gallanani\\", though more commonly called Sandy Creek or Mount Esk, and quickly developed to include a range of government and commercial buildings and houses. David and Mary McConnel of Cressbrook, two of the first European settlers in the Brisbane Valley, donated 20 acres of land for the construction of a Presbyterian Church to mark their silver wedding anniversary. They purchased, cleared and fenced the land. Mary McConnel, in particular, was a staunch Presbyterian and she and her family encouraged the establishment and support of other churches in the Valley. Alexander Raff, Bigge's financial manager, and other local graziers donated money towards the building of St Andrews. The gift of land and capital for the establishment of a church by local pastoralists reflects the relationship between early pastoral stations and the local settlements that served and traded with them reflecting a landowner and village pattern inherited from Europe. The land for the new church was in a choice position, being at the corner of Ipswich and Middle Streets in the commercial centre of the new township and close to the Sandy Creek crossing. A church was built to hold a congregation of 120 and a timber manse was also constructed. The church was built in 1875 and on 12 February 1876 the Reverend David Watt, who had travelled from Scotland to serve as minister, conducted the first recorded service at St Andrew's. As it was the first church to be built in the area it served at first as a Union Church accommodating all denominations. The area developed quickly and within five years had five separate preaching areas and was long. In 1884, two sawmills were opened and in 1886 the Brisbane Valley railway reached Esk, though it was located away from the established settlement. In time the commercial centre of town shifted to be closer to the railway station and yards. Most buildings moved to the northern bank of Sandy Creek or were built there, including the Roman Catholic (1884/1905) and Anglican (1889) churches. The Methodist church built on the south side was moved to Toogoolawah in 1906 and the current church is on the northern side of the creek. Now only the church, school and some houses survive marking the first settlement on the southern bank of Sandy Creek. Later churches were built on the opposite bank, nearer to the later settlement. Although the 1890s were a hard time for Esk due to flooding and the general financial recession of that decade, the 1900s were a period of growth. Dairying in the area expanded and a butter factory was built. In 1900 the church and manse were renovated and by 1908 the Sunday school had an enrolment of 91 pupils and a Women's Guild was formed. Around this time the population of Esk passed 600. In 1913, the town was officially renamed Esk. The date of construction of the timber church hall is unknown, but by 1929 there was a hall in existence on the site that was used as a Sunday school and for a variety of social activities. It is locally believed that the building was formerly the billiard room of the Commercial Hotel in Esk. It has been extended at the eastern end. The manse was sold for removal in 1947 and a replacement building was constructed in 1948. In 1951 the land to Main Street was sold. The church was considerably extended at the eastern end, almost doubling its capacity and suggesting a marked increase in the congregation. The extension can clearly be traced in joints to the walls and in the floorboards. The former church is now privately owned and the altar has been removed. On 17 March 2020 the owners of the property applied to remove the church from the Queensland Heritage Register.  Description  St Andrews Presbyterian Church, side view The former St Andrews church is a rectangular timber building set on low stumps and stands on a prominent site on the main Brisbane Valley Highway facing Middle Street. The hall is on the northern part of the site also facing Middle Street. There is a garage and an outhouse behind the hall. The manse stands to the west side of the complex facing the Brisbane Valley Highway (formerly known as Ipswich Road). The site is grassed and fenced with a plain timber and wire fence and there is a gate connecting the manse garden to the church site. The church is a landmark driving southwards out of Esk because of its location immediately opposite the crossing and its plain but distinctive form. Driving into town from the South it is the first church in a fine precinct of historical timber churches, associated buildings and mature trees on both sides of the Creek crossing. The church has a central porch with a scalloped bargeboard and lancet windows reached by timber steps to each side. The body of the church is lit by lancet windows and there are lancet windows flanking the porch and a louvred lancet high under the roof. This is gabled and clad in corrugated iron sheeting with a belfry on the roof ridge. The church has wide diagonal beaded boards on eaves, soffit and doors. Scissor trusses support the roof and the ceiling is lined with diagonal beaded boarding. The walls are lined with horizontal beaded boards and clearly shows the evidence of extension. The sanctuary is one step up from the body of the church and there is a vestry behind the altar area. The altar has been removed, but the building currently retains the rail and lectern and simple painted pews. There is an honour board. The church hall is a smaller building, also of weatherboard, with a gabled roof clad in corrugated iron. It has a porch and narrow rectangular windows shaded with hoods. The rear has been extended with part of a building, possibly recycled from elsewhere and incorporating a verandah and a large fixed window. This rear section, which does not contain windows along the side, may be the recycled billiard hall of local memory. The interior of the main room of the hall is lined with fibrous cement sheeting and cover strips. The floor is of narrow tongue and groove boards. There is a weatherboard garage with a gabled roof behind the hall. The manse is located at the corner of the black facing Ipswich Street. It is a weatherboard building on low stumps with a hipped corrugated iron roof. The windows are casements with horizontal glazing bars and there is a small porch.  Heritage listing  The former St Andrews Presbyterian Church was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 11 June 2003 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former St Andrews Church is associated with the early development of the Brisbane Valley and of Esk in particular. It was constructed in 1875 on land donated by the McConnel family, important early pastoralists in the district, and was built with financial assistance from the McConnels and other local landholders. Its location indicates the position of the first township at a dray route and near a river crossing before the arrival of the railway in 1886 caused a relocation of the town centre. Being the first church in Esk, its initial use as a Union church demonstrates cooperation between different denominations common in the early stages of establishing townships. The extension carried out to accommodate an expanding congregation also reflects the development of Esk. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The former St Andrews church is a good example of the type of simple timber church that served many new settlements as their first church, and was adapted for continuing use. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The position of the church on a prominent site at the entry to the town makes it an important landmark and in its form, scale and detail the church makes a makes an important contribution to the built character of Esk The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The former St Andrews church has a long association with the people of Esk and the surrounding district, being a place of worship and social focus for over 125 years. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. It is also important for its connection with the McConnels of Cressbrook, notable as benefactors of the Church.

History  Hugh Conroy Castleholme was established in the 1870s, following Hugh Conroy's selection and purchase of the then property in 1875. By 1916 a small cedar dwelling at Castleholme had become a rambling, fourteen-roomed house with wide verandahs. By that time the grounds included flowerbeds, shrubs and shade trees, and substantial outbuildings, and the principal activity was dairying. Castleholme remained in the Conroy family until 1978 when it became part of the Wivenhoe Dam reclamation area.  Description  Bryden cemetery Castleholme consists of the remains of a homestead, slab barn, cottage, stables and associated farm buildings and stockyards with a number of mature trees. It is located in the Brisbane Valley on a northeastern slope, is visible from the Bryden-Crossdale Road and borders the Bryden Catholic Cemetery.

Early Iranians had rhytons with an animal head at the end of the vessel; Later in Achaemenid period the animal part of the rhyton was usually located in front of it and has a 90 degree angle to the vessel. The rhyton has been created in 500 B.C by estimates. It has 6.7 in. height (about 17 cm.) and is totally made up of gold. The different parts of the artifact are joined together by soldering so skilfully done that observers can't even see any trace.

The museum was founded in 1969 by the Greek Archaeological Service under the auspices of the Ephorate of Antiquities of Olympia. At the time, the latter included in its jurisdiction the larger part of Messenia. The museum building The museum was built to shelter and exhibit finds from the excavations of Carl Blegen at the Palace of Nestor in Epano Englianos, as well as those of Spyridon Marinatos in the regions of Pylia and Trifylia. Because of their contributions to the museum, the busts of both archaeologists are positioned at the staircase leading to the museum's entrance. On either side of the entrance stand large burial pithoi of the Middle Helladic period, from the tumuli of Kokorakou, Peristeria, and Agios Ioannis, Papoulia.Davis, J., A guide to the Palace of Nestor, Mycenaean Sites in its Environs and the Museum of Hora, ASCSA 2001. The building has two stories: the exhibition space is on the elevated ground floor, and the basins are used as storage for the archaeological material and as a study area. The exhibition space is divided into three consecutive galleries as well as a vestibule that is used as a cloakroom, museum shop and ticket office. The galleries hold finds from the excavations of the Palace of Nestor, the tholos tombs of the Englianos area, and other nearby archaeological sites. Most of the finds are grouped according to the location where they were found. Room 1 The first room of the museum contains items from the excavations in Pylia and Trifyliaare.For a collective presentation of the finds of these excavations see Marinatos, Sp., Anaskafai Messenias 1952-1966, ed. Sp. Iakovides, Athens 2014 (in Geek). Cases 1, 2, 4, 6, 7 and 8 display finds from the extensive cemetery at Volimidia, dated to the Late Helladic I-IIIB (Mycenaean) period (1550‚Äì1200 BC). Cases 1 and 2 Cases 1 and 2 contain grave goods from the tombs of the Angelopoulos group and the Vorias-Tsouleas group at Volimidia, excavated by Marinatos in 1952‚Äì54. Some of the most important finds are small stirrup jars, jugs, keftiu-type cups, composite vessels consisting of two or three alabaster pieces joined together with one single handle, and a small prochous (jug for pouring water) covered on the lid and spout with a sieve. Case 3 Case 3 contains finds from the Middle and Late Helladic burials at Routsi, Mysinochori, which is only a few kilometers from Englianos and Chora. The chamber and tholos tombs at Routsi were in use from 1680‚Äì1300 B.C. The first excavations were carried out by Marinatos, and the site was further investigated by G.S. Korres in the 1980s. The Middle helladic tumuli contained burials in pithoid jars. The Late Helladic tholos tombs, although relatively small (average diameter 5 meters) were rich in grave goods, particularly in luxury items. Tholos tomb II, which was found intact, apparently contained members of the local elite, as attested by the finds. They include a copper sword, three copper daggers with inlay decoration of niello, pottery, jewelry, gems, and seals. Some of the objects were made of gold and precious stones, such as amber, and were used for necklaces. In total, the tholos contained five burials in pit graves, one of which was a little \\"princess\\". Among the pottery exhibits is an alabaster, with alternating black and off-white slip in a wavy pattern, a bevelled jug with spiral motives, and a pithoid jar decorated with schematic ivy leaves. All of these items are either directly imported from Minoan Crete or imitating Minoan models. There is also a pair of small scale discs; scholars believe that scales were symbolically placed in tombs in order to weigh the soul of the deceased in the underworld. The copper pan on display is of particular interest because of its muddy content which were the remains of food, apparently from the last supper on behalf of the deceased. Case 4 Between cases 3 and 4 stands an enormous burial jar from the tomb (literally a grave circle) of Agios Ioannis, Papoulia. The burial jars were arranged radially around a horseshoe-shaped construction in the middle of the tumulus, possibly serving as a cenotaph. Next to the jar is a two-eared hydria from the same tumulus, dating from the Early Helladic or Middle Helladic period. Case 4 contains grave goods from the tombs of the Kefalovryso group at Volimidia. Among these items is a pottery type mentioned in Homer as a two-handled cup. It is a composite vessel, consisting of two drinking cups connected on the rim with a small handle and on the belly with a small tube. The case also contains two containers of unknown function. Marinatos suggested that one of them is a dimiteus which is an object that helps divide weaving threads. Case 4 also contains pottery from Tragana- Voroulia, dated to the Late Helladic I period including Keftiu cups. The term Keftiu is derived from Egyptian texts, where it denotes a particular nation, which Egyptologists identified as the Minoans from Crete. Most of the pottery vessels on this shelf were discovered in a storage building, where pottery of various periods was stored. Near to case 4 stands an amphora with a depiction of an octopus from Tholos tomb II at Routsi. Case 9 Case 9 contains the finds from the \\"gold-bearing\\" tombs of Peristeria, excavated by Marinatos in 1965. There is a golden diadem and two cups of the keftiu type that are golden with embossed spiral motives, from tholos tomb 3. These items resemble those found in the Royal pit tombs of Mycenae. There are also smaller items, such as golden bees, tassels, discs, lamellae and leaves. At the back side of the case is a representation of the floor of the Throne Room at the Palace of Nestor. Case 5 Case 5 contains more items from the grave circle of Peristeria, including an early figurine from Messenia representing a female figure in a long dress. Her bosom is naked and she prays in the Petsofas position of the Middle Minoan period. Case 5 also contains finds from the tholos tombs of Viglitsa, Tragana, dated to the 17th century BC. Among the items from this tomb were three pithoid amphorae with floral decorations consisting of lilies and ivy leaves and a squeezed bronze two-eared vessel. Case 6‚Äì8 Cases 6, 7, and 8 contain finds from the extensive Volimidia cemetery. Case 6 displays items from the Kefalovryso and Koroniou tomb groups including a large beaker (or stamnos) decorated with double axes, similar to those found in Royal pit I of Mycenae. In case 7, there is a flask with concentric circles, a figurine of a bovine, a Mycenaean figurine of the Œ® type, and Roman items made of terra sigillata. Case 8 contains exhibits from chamber tombs 1, 2, 4, 5, 9, and 10 of the Angelopoulos group at Volimidia. Tomb 4 contained items of the Mycenaean period, as well as a large number of pottery and glass artifacts of the Roman period. Tomb 5 contained items of the late Helladic and Protogeometric periods, including two medium-sized jugs, one decorated with a maeander design, and a copper double axe. Room 2 The second central room of the Museum is dedicated to the Palace of Nestor and the hill of Englianos. Case 10 Case 10 contains large stemmed beakers, kylikes, kraters and ladles from pantry 20 of the Palace of Nestor. Case 19 also contains pottery and drinking vessels from pantry 20, as well as some pottery from room 38, including stripes for sealing jars. One krater is mattpainted with wavy decoration, similar to a krater from the excavations at Vlachopoulo that is displayed in the museum of Pylos. There is also a stone oil lamp of Minoan origin made of white marble and decorated with spiral patterns. Cases 11, 12, 17, and 18: The wallpainting cases Cases 11, 12, 17 and 18 contain fragments of the palace's wall paintings. On the walls over the cases there are painting recreations of the wall paintings by Piet de Jong. Jong was an architect and designer with the British School at Athens, who worked on several Mycenaean and Minoan sites.Although the wall paintings of the Palace of Nestor have been thoroughly studied by Lang, M., The Palace of Nestor at Pylos in Western Messenia, v.II, Princeton 1969, they still constitute a huge puzzle, being the focus of study both on the artistic level and on the physicochemical level, thus yielding information about the technological and the artistic level of the kingdom of Pylos. Case 11 contains fragments from the backfilling of the palace vestibule which depict hunting dogs. There are also fragments of wall paintings from the room of the Queen, which depict lions and griffins. In case 12, the fragments depict male figures from the vestibule of the palace of Nestor, a man leading dogs and another man carrying tripods. There is a frieze with nautilus-shells from corridor number 48 and a fa√ßade of a building decorated with consecration horns, a typical cult symbol of the Minoans, from the courtyards south of the vestibule. Case 17 contains more painting fragments including rosettes (from staircase 54), a battle scene over a river (from vestibule 64), and lyre player who was probably the last figure on a large wallpainting depicting a procession. The lyre player alludes to Apollo and to Thamyris, a musician from Pylia, who boasted about his musical prowess and therefore was punished by the muses (Iliad, 2 594-600). In case 18 there are a collection of painting fragments showing a female head named ‚ÄúThe White Goddess‚Äù, nautilus shells, blue birds, and a bull-leaper that was found in a pit in the floor of the wine magazine. Cases 32 and 33 Case 32 contains miniature kylikes, possibly used for ritual purposes, as well as replicas of Linear B tablets. Two golden Venetian coins suggest that the hilltop of Englianos was used as a quarry for building materials in a later period. In case 33 there are fragments of jewellery and golden lamellae. Cases 13‚Äì15 These cases all contain pottery found in the palace's pantries. Case 13 displays jars from storeroom 32, case 14 contains drinking cups, scoops and bowls from pantry 60, and case 15 has similar items from pantry 18. The items in these cases include cooking pots, stemmed kylikes, scoops and ladles, probably used for cooking, drinking and feasting. Free- standing displays Room 2 contains several items that are not in cases. There are two free-standing, large amphorae for storing goods. One is decorated with a checkerboard pattern. The other is a Minoan-style clay table of offerings found next to the hearth in the throne room. In the middle of the room is a model of the palace, donated by a Dutch highschool. Room 3 The third room contains exhibits from the palace as well as from the broader region of Englianos. Cases 20‚Äì23: The lower town Case 20 contains finds from Kokkevis' chamber and protogeometric tombs at Chora. These finds include amphoras, a krater with a depiction of a hunting scene, and a stemmed open cup or bowl with a linear white decoration, reminiscent of pottery from Early Modern Greece. There are also grave goods from Tsakalis' chamber tombs and from the tholos tomb 4 of Kanakaris including a copper bowl with long rectangular handles, a feeding bottle, a female figurine, necklaces of gold or semi-precious stones, and a set for personal care containing a razor and two mirrors. Case 21 is dedicated to finds from the lower town and Tsakalis tombs. A conical rhyton decorated with palm trees and nilotic floral motives in a Minoan style. The case also contains a stirrup jar with an ivy-leaf decoration, a prochous with the same floral pattern and two tall Keftiu cups with a spiral decoration. Case 22 contains pottery from the Palace's pantries and from the dumps of the acropolis including cups, kyathoi, kraters and some beveled jugs. Case 23 contains pottery items which were blackened and deformed by the fire which consumed the Palace, as well as grave goods from the pit grave in room 97. The grave goods include Carnelian, amethyst, and gold beads, and another golden bead in the form of a warrior's head. Cases 24, 25: The palace's pantries Case 24 contains storage vessels from the palace's pantry 68, workshop 55, and wine magazine 105 including a brazier made of clay. Case 25 contains two types of pots, tripod cookpots and clay shovels for charcoal. Some of the items are blackened by fire. In addition to the cases, there is a large ringed jar with a lid that was used for storage of goods, such as oil, and a clay pipe and basin-shaped lid which formed part of the chimney above the hearth in the Queen's apartments. Case 26: The aromatic oil Case 26 contains well-preserved stirrup jars which were the most typical vessels for transporting good quality aromatic oil. Cases 27 and 28 Case 27 contains mainly drinking vessels, such as stemmed drinking cups, and some deformed and burned items including an askos. Case 28 contains daily use pottery, such as bowls, basins, scoops and sauce-boat, and twists for making Linear B tablets. Case 29: Burial customs Case 29 contains finds and grave goods from Vayenas Tholos tomb 5 which is actually a grave circle. The items from this tomb belonged mainly to warriors but a few suggest at least one female burial. The items include Late Helladic pottery, prochoi, a three-eared amphora, a pair of copper scales, a personal care set made of copper and ivory, sheaths for daggers which apparently formed part of a Mycenean warrior's armour, and a large number of daggers and swords, some of which are bent. The bent swords allude to the fact that their owners, former warriors, will never again need them. Cases 30 and 31 Case 30 contains pottery sherds, small copper daggers and parts of an ivory helmet. In case 31 is a miniature ring prochous as well as a set of pestles.  Free-standing displays  Free-standing exhibits include a pithos and a large copper basin with handles ending in a human hand shape from the Vayenas grave circle, and large consecration horns.

Since then, Danish expeditions and Danish travelers brought home a substantial number of Oriental and North African manuscripts that are of interest to scholars, for book history, for the research in Eastern religions and culture (Islam, Buddhism, Tibet, etc.) and for researchers dealing with language, literature and history. Denmark holds today in some areas collections, which are among the most significant outside Asia.

Westergaard and A.F. Mehren. The collection of Oriental manuscripts grew steadily in Denmark during the following hundred years, and in 1952 the philologist, professor dr. phil. Kaare Gr√∏nbech, University of Copenhagen, in close cooperation with the Royal Danish Library initiated a new edition. Kaare Gr√∏nbech was the first editor. Head of the Oriental Department at the Royal Library Stig T. Rasmussen has since 1992 been the main editor of the edition. The edition is particularly aims at the international research community. The edition therefore offers not only a catalogue of each manuscript, but also a more detailed description of the manuscripts with representations of texts, the cultural background and the historical significance. These descriptions are complemented by photographic reproductions, in order for international researchers to get a pretty good idea of what each manuscript contains.

Because the consular officials satisfied notice requirements, there was no need for the Court to address the constitutional question about the right to live with one's spouse.Din, slip op. at 6 (Kennedy, J., concurring). Writing for a plurality of the court, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote that there is no constitutional right to live with one‚Äôs spouse, and because Din was not denied ‚Äúlife, liberty, or property,‚Äù she was not entitled to due process.Din, slip op. at 15 (2015) (plurality opinion). Justice Stephen Breyer wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that Din was denied liberty without due process of law, and that there is a fundamental right for spouses to ‚Äúlive together and to raise a family,‚Äù which enjoys basic due process protections.Din, slip op. at 1-2 (plurality opinion). In the weeks following the announcement of the Court's decision, some analysts suggested the Justices' opinions in Kerry v. Din would foreshadow the outcome in Obergefell v. Hodges.See, e.g., Kevin Johnson, Opinion Analysis: Limited judicial review of consular officer visa decisions ‚Äì foreshadowing the result in the same-sex marriage case? , (Jun. 15, 2015, 5:02 PM); Ruthann Robson, , Does Immigration Marriage Case Foreshadow Same-Sex Marriage Case? (Accessed June 15, 2015); Ian Millhiser, , Justice Scalia Turns Obscure Immigration Case Into A Proxy War Over Marriage Equality (Accessed June 29, 2015). Background Immigration and Nationality Act visa requirements The Immigration and Nationality Act prohibits non-citizens from entering the United States without a visa.66 Stat. 163, as amended, 8 U.S.C. ¬ß 1101 et seq. The Act allows individuals classified as \\"immediate relatives\\" of those living in the United States to apply for a visa at a United States Embassy or consular office. However, non-citizen \\"immediate relatives\\" are ineligible for admission into the United States if they provide \\"material support to a terrorist organization\\" or serve \\"as a terrorist organization‚Äôs representative.\\"Din, slip op. at 2 (plurality opinion) (citing 8 U.S.C. ¬ß 1182(a)(3)(B)). Kanishka Berashk's visa application Fauzia Din arrived to the United States from Afghanistan as a refugee in the year 2000, and she became a naturalized citizen in 2007.Din, slip op. at 2-3 (plurality opinion). In 2006, she married Kanishka Berashk, who was a former civil servant in Afghanistan during the Taliban regime.Din, slip op. at 1, 3 (plurality opinion). Din filed paperwork to classify Berashk as an \\"immediate relative,\\" and Berashk filed a visa application to gain entry to the United States.Din, slip op. at 3 (plurality opinion). The United States Embassy in Islamabad, Pakistan reviewed Berashk's application and conducted an interview but ultimately denied his visa application. A consular official informed Berashk he was ineligible for entry under the portion of the Immigration and Nationality Act that precludes admission for individuals with connections to terrorist organizations, but the official provided no further explanation for this determination. Initial legal challenges Because Berashk was an unadmitted, non-resident alien, he had no right of entry into the United States and could not challenge his denial of his visa application.Din, slip op. at 1 (plurality opinion) (citing Kleindienst v. Mandel, ). Consequently, Din filed suit in United States District Court, where she claimed the government denied her due process of law by depriving her of her \\"constitutional right to live in the United States with her spouse\\" and for denying her husband's visa application without adequate explanation. The District Court rejected Din's claims, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that Din had \\"a protected liberty interest in marriage that entitled [her] to review of the denial of [her] spouse‚Äôs visa.\\"Din, slip op. at 1, 3 (plurality opinion) (citing Din v. Kerry, 718 F.3d 856, 860 (9th Cir. 2013)) (internal quotations omitted). The United States appealed, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari on October 2, 2014.Kerry v. Din, 135 S.Ct. 44 (2014). Judgment of the Court In his dissenting opinion, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote that the constitution protects \\"the right of spouses to live together and to raise a family.\\"Din, slip op. at 2-3 (Breyer, J., dissenting). In his plurality opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote that there is no constitutional right to live in the United States with one's spouse.Din, slip op. at 1 (plurality opinion). He argued that under the Fifth Amendment's due process clause, citizens are only entitled to redress if they are denied \\"life, liberty, or property.\\" Din, slip op. at 3-4 (plurality opinion) (citing Swarthout v. Cooke, (per curiam)). Because visa applications have not historically been understood as \\"life, liberty, or property,\\" the denial of a visa application does not implicate Fifth Amendment due process protections.Din, slip op. at 4-5 (plurality opinion). Additionally, Justice Scalia rejected the argument that the denial of the visa application implicated a fundamental liberty interest.Din, slip op. at 6-11 (plurality opinion). Although Justice Scalia conceded that Loving v. Virginia and its progeny ‚Äúinvok[e] a fundamental right to marriage,‚Äù the parties ‚Äúimplicitly concede that no such right has been infringed in this case.‚ÄùDin, slip op. at 7, 11‚Äì15 (plurality opinion). Justice Kennedy's concurring opinion In Justice Anthony Kennedy's opinion concurring in the judgment, he argued that the Court need not rule upon whether Din has a right to live with her spouse.Din, slip op. at 1-2 (Kennedy, J., concurring). Even if the Court assumed that Din did have a fundamental liberty interest in living with her spouse, \\"the notice she received regarding her husband‚Äôs visa denial satisfied due process.\\"Din, slip op. at 1 (Kennedy, J., concurring). Justice Kennedy concluded that notice requirements ‚Äú[do] not apply when, as in this case, a visa application is denied due to terrorism or national security concerns.‚ÄùDin, slip op. at 5-6 Kennedy, J., concurring). Justice Breyer's dissenting opinion Justice Stephen Breyer wrote a dissent in which he argued that consular officials had denied Din due process by preventing her from living with her husband.Din, slip op. at 2-4 (Breyer, J., dissenting). He wrote that the Supreme Court \\"has long recognized, the institution of marriage, which encompasses the right of spouses to live together and to raise a family, is central to human life, requires and enjoys community support, and plays a central role in most individuals‚Äô 'orderly pursuit of happiness.'\\"Din, slip op. at 2-3 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (citing Meyer v. Nebraska, ). Additionally, Justice Breyer argued that the notice provided to Berashk was inadequate, and was the equivalent of \\"telling a criminal defendant only that he is accused of 'breaking the law.'\\"Din, slip op. at 7-9 (Breyer, J., dissenting). Commentary and analysis Reaction to the Court's decision In the weeks following the Court's decision, some analysts criticized the Court's ruling for focusing too much attention on \\"social norms\\" and not enough attention on the realities of the immigrant experience.See, e.g., Elizabeth Keyes, , Symposium on Kerry v. Din: Another Choiceless Choice (Accessed June 29, 2015). The Los Angeles Times' editorial board criticized the Court for allowing consular officials to deny a visa \\"simply by asserting a vague connection to terrorism.\\"Los Angeles Times Editorial Board, , The \\"Terrorist\\" Who Didn't Get A U.S. Visa (June 17, 2015). Others noted that the lack of a majority opinion meant that the case would likely have little precedential value in the future.See, e.g., Chuck Roth, , Symposium on Kerry v. Din: What Is the \\"Holding\\" of Kerry v. Din? (Accessed June 29, 2015). Because Justice Kennedy was the only Justice to not author a majority opinion from the February sitting, some commentators believed that he was initially assigned the role of writing an opinion for the majority of the Court, but three justices defected sometime after the assignment was made.Josh Blackman, Who Will Write The Remaining Three Opinions Since AMK (Probably) Lost Ayala Majority? (Accessed June 29, 2015). In June 2015, Nina Totenberg reported that Din was in the process of submitting further character evidence about her husband to the State Department so that officials can re-evaluate Berashk's visa application.Nina Totenberg, , High Court Sides With Government On Spousal Visa Denial (Accessed June 29, 2015). Speculation about Obergefell v. Hodges In light of the case's extensive discussion about fundamental rights associated with marriage, analysts suggested the Justices' views in Kerry v. Din would foreshadow the outcome of Court's upcoming decision in Obergefell v. Hodges.See, e.g., Kevin Johnson, Opinion Analysis: Limited judicial review of consular officer visa decisions ‚Äì foreshadowing the result in the same-sex marriage case? , (Jun. 15, 2015, 5:02 PM); Ruthann Robson, , Does Immigration Marriage Case Foreshadow Same-Sex Marriage Case? (Accessed June 15, 2015). Some commentators even described the opinion as a \\"proxy war\\" for the debate in Obergefell.Ian Millhiser, , Justice Scalia Turns Obscure Immigration Case Into A Proxy War Over Marriage Equality (Accessed June 29, 2015). Other commentators opined that Justice Kennedy's narrow concurrence in Kerry v. Din was evidence he would ultimately write the majority opinion in Obergefell.Nicholas Datlowe, Former Taliban Civil Servant‚Äôs Wife Not Entitled to Visa Denial Explanation, 83 1899 (June 16, 2015). When the Court ultimately released its decision in Obergefell, Justice Kennedy was the author of the majority's opinion, while Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Alito, Justice Scalia, and Justice Thomas all wrote dissenting opinions.Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.S. ___ (2015).

Early life and career  Born in Dublin, Megaw was the son of Irish (later Northern Irish) politician and judge Robert Megaw and the brother of the crystallographer Helen Megaw. After the creation of the Irish Free State, his father, a strong Protestant, relocated the family to Belfast. He was educated at the Royal Academical School in Belfast, before being elected to an open scholarship in Classics at St John's College, Cambridge. After gaining a first in Part I of the classical tripos, he switched to Law, gaining a first in Part II of the law tripos and in the LLB (which, at the time was a postgraduate law degree). He then attended Harvard Law School on a Choate fellowship. He also played rugby union internationally for Ireland, delaying his called to the bar for a term to take part in a match. Megaw was called to the bar by Gray's Inn in 1934, having gained a certificate of honour in the bar finals. He became a pupil of Henry Willink at 3 Essex Court, and became a tenant there. Through devilling for Willink, Megaw became known to the India Office, and was regularly retained by the Indian government to appear in front of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. His practice was mainly in commercial law, in which he distinguished himself. Megaw married in 1938. The same year, disapproving of the Munich Agreement, he joined the Territorial Army. Called up as a gunner in 1939, he saw active service in London during the Blitz, before being posted to a staff position in Washington DC. He was demobilized with the rank of colonel and was awarded the US Legion of Merit. Returning to the bar after the war, Megaw took silk in 1953, and was made silk in Northern Ireland, even though he did not practice there. He was appointed Recorder of Middlesbrough in 1957 and elected a bencher of Gray's Inn in 1958, serving as treasurer in 1976. During his career at the bar he acted as pupilmaster to Michael Kerr (also later a Lord Justice of Appeal) and was a chambers contemporary of John Donaldson (later Master of the Rolls).  Judicial career  In 1961, on the recommendation of Lord Kilmuir, he was appointed to the High Court, receiving the customary knighthood. Assigned to the Queen's Bench Division, he also became President of the Restrictive Practices Court, but resigned from the latter in 1968, in protest against the government's use of legislation to overrule the court. In December 1964, he sentenced Ronald Cooper to death for murder, becoming the last judge to pronounce a death sentence at the Old Bailey. He was promoted a Lord Justice of Appeal in 1969, and was sworn of the Privy Council. Having become dissatisfied with judicial work and aware that he would not be promoted to the House of Lords, he retired during the Long Vacation with little fanfare. After his retirement, he occasionally sat on the Privy Council and as an arbitrator. In 1981‚Äì82, he chaired the Committee of Inquiry into Civil Service Pay (Megaw Committee), formed in the aftermath of a Civil Service strike.  Honours  In addition to the customary knighthood and appointment to the Privy Council, Megaw received the American Legion of Merit in 1946, the Territorial Decoration in 1951, and was appointed CBE in 1956 for service as a member of the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council. He was an honorary fellow of St John's College, Cambridge, and received an honorary LLD from Queen's University Belfast.  Family  Megaw married Eleanor Grace Chapman in 1938; they had one son and two daughters. Notable cases Notable judicial decisions of Lord Justice Megaw included: *Ward v Tesco Stores Ltd *Re Baden's Deed Trusts (No 2) *Nettleship v Weston *Maredelanto Compania Naviera SA v Bergbau-Handel GmbH *Tenax Steamship Co v Owners of the Motor Vessel Brimnes *Lawrence v Metropolitan Police Comr (in the Court of Appeal) *Thornton v Shoe Lane Parking Ltd *Bunge Corp v Tradax Export SA (in the Court of Appeal) *Aluminium Industrie Vaassen BV v Romalpa Aluminium Ltd Rugby Union John Megaw was also capped twice as an international rugby union player for Ireland in the 1930s, once 1934 against Wales and again in 1938 against England, both times playing at Number Eight. Ireland lost both tests.

The lagoon, together with Voidokilia Bay, belongs to a unique ecosystem which constitutes a protected zone, in terms of both natural and cultural heritage. From the natural point of view, the entire area, together with Navarino Bay and the island of Sphacteria, forms part of the network Natura 2000 and has been named a Zone of Special Protection, with code GR2550008, and an Area of EU Importance, with code GR2550004.  Fauna  It serves as a wildlife habitat, particularly for migratory birds, which stop here first on their way from Africa to Northern Europe. A multitude of mammals, reptiles, amphibians and fish live there. Prominent among them is the African Chamelaeon, which is threatened by extinction. It is thought that this species came to the region during the Roman period, as it appears also in other regions of the Pax Romana, such as the Iberian peninsula, Malta and Cyprus.  Archaeology  The region has been proclaimed a zone of archaeological protection. It contains unique sites of archaeological interest, such as the tomb of Thrasymedes at Voidokoilia, the remains of Classical Pylos at Koryphasion, Palaiokastro or Palaionavarino, the cave of Nestor. In the 1960s at Yalova proper at the site called Divari, N. Yalouris, then director of the local archaeological service, excavated a Hellenistic necropolis. The excavations revealed several unspoiled shaft graves. Apart from the skeletal material, the graves were full of grave goods, mainly pottery, as well as coins, objects made of various metals and jewellery. Among these finds stand out a delta-shaped askos, known also as ‚Äúhot-water bottle‚Äù, a clay sieve, a small aryballos made of faience and fish- plates. These finds are kept in the Archaeological Museum of Pylos.  Threats and protection  The lagoon had been endangered in the recent past due to plans to divert the rivers, and other sources of water that feed into the ecosystem and turn the area into arable land, but is now protected.

At the end of the same month, he participated in a war council held at Arkadi Monastery. There, together with other monks and the chieftain Georgios Daskalakis he disagreed with the proposal of colonel Panos Koronaios to abandon Arkadi, because it was not strong enough for effective defense in a possible Turkish attack. At the same time, he rejected another proposal of Koronaios to destroy the stables and the mill that could provide a bridgehead for enemy forces.

Their most notable trademark was the use of white ceramic tiles for the treatment of external fa√ßades inspired by Le Corbusier's use of tiles on the entrance drum of the Arm√©e de Salut (1929) in Paris and the General Pensions Institute (1929-34) in Prague designed by Josef Havl√≠ƒçek and Karel Honz√≠k and worked on by Rosenberg.

The television show airs regularly on Xinjiang Television Channel 9. The show is recorded at the Xinjiang Arts Institute Concert Hall. The show premiered on 31 October 2014 as the first Uyghur televised singing competition of its kind and received positive reviews from the start. Format The television program is primarily conducted in Uyghur with Mandarin Chinese subtitles; occasionally, particularly when there are non-Uyghur, Mandarin-speaking contestants, participants and/or judges may converse in Mandarin, with Uyghur subtitles provided. Songs are typically sung in Uyghur, sometimes in Mandarin Chinese and occasionally in English. Contestants are typically, but not always, aspiring singers from Xinjiang or surrounding areas, including residents of other parts of China as well as Central Asia. The format is similar to that of other television shows in The Voice franchise. The series consists of three phases: a blind audition, a battle phase, and live performance shows. Prior to the start of the show there is a pre-screening process, to determine who may enter the competition; successful contestants may enter the blind audition phase of the competition. Only a select few contestants advance to the blind audition phase which is broadcast live on television. At the start of the series four judges choose teams of contestants through a live blind audition process; these teams will be coached by their selected judge during the competition. Contestants come forward to sing a selected song on stage with the judges' backs turned. A judge who likes the contestant's performance and would like to mentor that performer may then press a button attached to his/her seat to indicate that the judge has accepted the performer for his/her team. Each judge has the length of the auditioner's performance to decide if he/she will accept that singer on his/her team. After the live blind audition, all judges turn around their chairs, the singer introduces himself/herself, and then the judges may elect to provide feedback or ask further questions. Judges cannot retroactively select a performer after the live blind audition has finished. It is possible that no judges may accept a performer, in which case that performer may automatically be eliminated from the competition. If only one judge accepts the performer, that singer is automatically on his/her team. If two or more judges accept the same singer, as happens frequently, the singer has the final choice of coach; during this time the accepting judges may also attempt to convince the performer to choose his/her team. Finally, the performer chooses his/her coach among the accepting judges and joins that team. The singer then competes with other singers in the battle phase, in which singers from the same team compete head to head while singing the same song and the best singers are selected to continue. The performances are no longer blind; judges will see both singers on stage simultaneously and compare their performance. Judges then evaluate the performers and provide feedback, selecting the stronger performers to remain on the team and continue with the competition. Following that is the live performance shows phase. Contestants are gradually eliminated until one winner remains. Judges The judges for the current season are: * Erkin Abdulla (2014‚Äìpresent), known for pop music, world music, fusion, and flamenco guitar * Abdulla Abdurehim (2014‚Äìpresent), known for acting and pop music * Mahmut Sulayman (2014‚Äìpresent), known for pop music and rock music * Nurnisa Abbas (2014‚Äìpresent), known for opera singing * Sanubar Tursun (2016‚Äì2018), known for classical songs References See also * The Voice worldwide franchise of reality singing competitions * The Voice of Holland, the original show on which subsequent The Voice shows are based * The Voice of China, a sister show in Mandarin Chinese language featuring aspiring singers from across mainland China Chinese reality television series Chinese music television series Uyghur- language television shows 2010s Chinese television series Xinjiang Television original programming ","title":"The Voice of the Silk Road"},{"id":"47117795","text":"mono.kultur is a quarterly magazine publishing interviews with creatives in the arts and culture in a wider sense.

All aboard were killed, along with 17 people on the ground. At the time of the crash, the aircraft was transporting military personnel and their families, and possibly some civilian passengers. Shortly after the crash, the Chief of Staff of the Indonesian Air Force grounded their entire C-130 fleet for inspection at Abdul Rachman Saleh Airport, from which the aircraft involved originated. Accident The plane took off at 12:08 p.m. (0508 GMT) from Soewondo Air Force Base, after refuelling and taking on passengers. It crashed near Djamin Ginting Road in Medan about two minutes later. The crash site was approximately from the base. According to Indonesian Chief of Staff of the Air Force Marshal Agus Supriana, before crashing, the pilot had requested permission to return to base. According to eyewitnesses and Indonesian media, after the pilot indicated the aircraft would return to base, it drastically rolled to the right. An eyewitness reported that after the aircraft rolled, it then clipped a radio tower belonging to Joy FM, dove and then exploded. After it dove, multiple explosions were heard from as far as away. The aircraft became inverted, and the nose clipped the Golden Eleven Hotel. It then struck three other buildings, one of which was a crowded massage parlor, at a nearly perpendicular angle. It finally exploded in what onlookers described as \\"a hell-like scene\\", with bodies ejected onto the street. It was the deadliest C-130 Hercules crash in Indonesian history, surpassing the 1991 Hercules crash in East Jakarta, the third-deadliest air disaster in the province of North Sumatra, after Garuda Indonesia Flight 152 and Mandala Airlines Flight 091, and the second air disaster in Indonesia within six months, after Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501 in December 2014. The crash occurred only away from the 2005 Mandala Airlines crash, in a residential area in Medan, and also occurred minutes after takeoff. Both happened on the Djamin Ginting Road. Passengers and crew The aircraft was transporting military personnel and their families for duty rotations. The passengers included those who boarded the aircraft from Malang, Jakarta and Pekanbaru; the aircraft was scheduled to continue to Tanjung Pinang, Natuna, and Pontianak before returning to Malang. Such flights are common in Indonesia, and it is common for families to be transported together in military aircraft. There were 110 passengers and 12 crew members on board. At least 7 people on the ground were reported missing and feared dead. The son of the former Indonesian President, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, a young army officer and acquaintance of the pilot, claimed that the captain of the aircraft, Sandy Permana, was very experienced and \\"one of the best pilots in the Indonesian Air Force\\". Identification of the victims started on 1 July 2015. The National Search and Rescue Agency (BASARNAS) stated that around 100 bodies were found in the crash site, along with 60 body parts. The bodies were transported to Adam Malik Hospital in Medan for identification. By 4 July, at least 119 bodies had been identified and returned to their families. Crash site The crash took place in a crowded residential neighborhood in Medan, Indonesia's third-largest city. The aircraft took off from Soewondo Air Force Base, formerly Polonia airport. Polonia had been the city's main commercial airport until it was replaced by Kualanamu International Airport in 2013, partly due to concerns arising from its proximity to urban areas (2 km from the city center). Soewondo now serves as the headquarters of the Air Force's Western Surveillance Wing. Moments after the crash, onlookers began searching through the wreckage for survivors. Thousands of local residents attempted to approach the site. Crowds attempted to bring hoses to the site while soldiers also aided in the search. At least four people survived the initial impact and were later admitted to the nearest hospital for serious burn injuries. These were later confirmed as \\"survivors on the ground\\", not passengers or crew. All 122 people on board died in the accident. Investigation Because the aircraft was not fitted with a flight recorder, the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee primarily relied on the wreckage pattern and the pilot's flight history for the investigation. On 1 July 2015, all of the ammunition and two engines from the aircraft were successfully removed from the crash site. The Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI) said that they would pay the insurance claims, which totaled Rp 2.25 trillion (roughly US$170 million). The investigation was expected to be completed in two weeks. The preliminary report was not made public. The aircraft was one of ten C-130Bs given to Indonesia by the United States in exchange for an imprisoned CIA pilot, captured during Sulawesi rebellion 1957‚Äì1961. The aircraft suffered from a shortage of spare parts after the US enacted an embargo (9 September 1999 ‚Äì 22 November 2005) on Indonesia over their part in the 1999 East Timorese crisis. In view of the aircraft's age, the crash sparked public outcry over the state of the Indonesian Air Force Hercules fleet. However, Indonesian officials denied that the aircraft's age was a factor in the crash, and insisted it was in \\"good condition\\". On 3 July 2015, it was reported that the number four engine propeller had malfunctioned before the aircraft hit the tower, indicating a mechanical failure. All four of the aircraft's engines have been recovered from the crash site as part of the investigation. Roughly 90% of witnesses reported that the aircraft struck a cellphone tower before it crashed. The tower itself was found to be illegal, according to an Indonesian official. As a result, the Indonesian People's Representative Council advised that \\"illegal towers\\" anywhere in Indonesia had to be removed, as they were \\"ugly\\" to the scenery and \\"dangerous\\" for safety. President Joko Widodo and Vice President Jusuf Kalla agreed to the need to retire old aircraft in the Indonesian Air Force's fleet, to prevent a similar tragedy.

They were created for use on lines electrified using both third rail and overhead lines. Background A Toshiba EMU on the Sarmiento Line before the purchase of the CSR trains. By 2013, the rolling stock of Buenos Aires' commuter rail network was ageing and deteriorating rapidly. At the same time, high-profile accidents in Flores and Once in previous years had led the national government to revise the concession-based railway privatisation, which was largely blamed for the deterioration of the network.\\"El gobierno nacional estatiz√≥ los ferrocarriles Sarmiento y Mitre\\", Infobae The government thus decided to intervene, revoking concessions to companies such as Trenes de Buenos Aires and setting up Trenes Argentinos to manage the lines.\\"Nueva empresa estatal para el Belgrano Cargas\\", P√°gina/12, 23 May 2013 This was followed by a series of rolling stock purchases from China CNR Corporation and CSR Corporation Limited (and later some Argentine companies) to replace trains on both diesel and rail segments. For the electrified lines, CSR won the contract to provide the electric multiple units, and an order was placed in January 2013 for 405 cars for the Mitre and Sarmiento lines, with another order for 300 cars for the Roca Line signed in August of that same year.Decreto 9/2013 - Ministerio del Interior, 10 January 2013.Decisi√≥n Administrativa 584/2013 - Ministerio del Interior, 15 August 2013.

King International Airport in Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas, United States Virgin Islands and Isla Verde International Airport in Carolina, Puerto Rico, a suburb of San Juan. On 5 March 1969, the flight, operated by de Havilland Heron 2D N563PR, crashed into a mountain near Fajardo, killing all 19 occupants on board. Flight Prinair Flight 277 left Charlotte-Amalie at 5:15 pm on Wednesday, March 5, 1969 for a short flight to the San Juan area's main airport in Carolina. It was an uneventful flight until the airplane entered mainland Puerto Rico. This was the point in which the airplane's pilot contacted San Juan's approach control, letting them know that they were flying at and maintaining that flight level. Then, the airport's approach controller responded with, \\"Prinair two seven seven San Juan Approach Control radar contact three miles east of Isla Verde fly a heading of two five zero for a vector to ILS final maintain four thousand.\\" The approach controller, who was a trainee on the fateful afternoon, mistakenly thought that Prinair Flight 277 was near San Juan, but it was instead near Luquillo at what is described as the \\"Fajardo intersection\\". One minute after this communication, Prinair Flight 277 was asked to go to flight level 3, or and prepare for landing. The airplane was vectored for a landing into runway 7. The plane's pilots, trusting that the information given to them was correct, followed the instructions and prepared for landing, soon finding themselves in front of an unavoidable mountain instead. At 5:38 pm, 23 minutes after the flight took off from St. Thomas, it crashed into some trees on the Sierra Luquillo mountains, killing everyone on board. Investigation An NTSB investigation that followed discovered that this accident would not have been survivable in any way. The controller's home and belongings were investigated as part of the investigation and it was found he had a typical family life, along with some of the furnishings and electrical objects found at a typical family house. On March 17, 1969, the controller revealed to investigators, that 3 years before, a flight surgeon had sent him to see both a psychiatrist and a psychologist, and that on March 5, the day of the accident, he was feeling very tense and anxious. It was noted also that the accident area had several peaks that were over and that the weather conditions during that day would have prevented the pilots from seeing the peaks ahead of them. The controller's erroneous indications meant he thought the aircraft was further west than it actually was. About 5:33 pm, or five minutes before the crash, the flight coordinator's supervisor ordered him to go perform other duties, and then proceeded to give the controller's instructor instructions to go and do collateral duties. By then, the controller was directing 5 flights, including Prinair Flight 277. Some pilots on these five flights were heard complaining because the instructor's own transmissions were interrupting the controller's. Several other key elements were discovered by the investigation.

Bacchus Ladies () are elderly female prostitutes in Seoul, South Korea. Bacchus Ladies are women in their 50s, 60s, and some even their 80s, who solicit men in Seoul's parks and plazas for sex in nearby motels for about 20,000 to 30,000 won ($18‚Äì26 USD), or even less if the man is a regular client. Bacchus Ladies traditionally sold bottles of Bacchus-F energy drink in parks popular with elderly men who became their clientele, but younger men in their 20s to 40s are also increasingly becoming regular clients. According to Dr. Lee Ho-Sun, a researcher, about 400 women work in Jongmyo Park in Seoul. Background The poverty rate of elderly people in South Korea is the highest among the OECD countries Poverty rate in South Korea (age 65+) in 2011 The Bacchus Ladies phenomenon is believed to have originated after the 1997 Asian financial crisis, with South Korea being one of the countries most affected by the financial contagion.Ng, Desmond (January 29, 2017) \\"Granny prostitutes reflect South Korea's problem of elderly poverty\\" Channel NewsAsia In South Korea's traditionally Confucian society, elderly parents were highly respected and in their old age could have relied on their children for care regardless of the economic situation. However, South Korea's rapid development since the 1960s, known as the Miracle on the Han River, led to an uprooting of this culture among many younger and more transient generations of South Koreans. Subsequent rapid changes in society and attitudes of children has resulted in a poverty rate of 47.2% for South Korean women over the age of 65, the highest among the OECD countries. This figure rises to 76.6% for single elderly women. The state pensions provided by the South Korean welfare system are often inadequate to cover the rising medical bills of old age. The historic male-dominated culture of Korean society meant many older women had no savings or private pension because their youth did not provide the equal education and job opportunities of their male counterparts. Professor Lee Ho- Sun of the Korea Soongsil Cyber University in Seoul has carried out research and found many of the women who became Bacchus Ladies were involved in prostitution during their earlier years in karaoke bars and teahouses, returning to prostitution in later years because of financial pressures. At first, Bacchus Ladies had made livings by selling bottles of Bacchus-F, a popular energy drink in South Korea, which they sold to elderly men who socialized in the parks and plazas in Seoul. Eventually, many of these men became their main clientele after transitioning into prostitution. Policing Prostitution in South Korea is illegal, and the police patrol the areas frequented by Bacchus Ladies, primarily in Seoul's north-central Jongno District. Seoul police conduct periodic crackdowns on Bacchus Ladies, but women who are arrested are usually given a warning or a small fine. Thirty three women, including an 84-year-old woman, were arrested as part of a crackdown in early 2015. After the raid, the number of working Bacchus Ladies fell to about 200. Local police believe the problem cannot be solved by crackdowns and that policies needs to be changed. STIs There is an epidemic of Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among the South Korean elderly, primarily caused by the Bacchus Ladies' use of erection enhancing substances on their clients which are often injected into a vein, but the hypodermic needles may be reused 10 to 20 times. A 2014 local survey found 40% of the men were infected, while not testing for some of the most common diseases. The local government now offers sex education classes to the elderly.

CBS romance with royalty wins Nielsen-race crown, Arizona Republic (Associated Press) John J. O'Connor, television critic for The New York Times, found that the movie was \\"much more fixated on the purely romantic possibilities of the story\\" of Charles and Diana compared to its ABC competition. Instead of touching on any contemporary problems in Britain, the film provides \\"an outrageously gooey theme song and periodic helicopter shots of stunning countryside,\\" and \\"emotional high points\\" such as Diana deciding to get a hair cut.

He called it a piece of \\"slack-jawed heraldic voyeurism incapable of, and apparently uninterested in, transforming remote news figures into believable mortals.\\" Shales preferred the ABC movie, calling it \\"48 times better,\\" and decrying Diana's representation as \\"something of a Pollyanna, or a Cinderella - a sweet innocent sprite upon whom a fairy godmother bestowed a few crucial wishes.\\"Shales, Tom (20 September 1982).

CBS had planned to show Royal Romance in December as a Hallmark-sponsored pre- Christmas film, but then moved the air date back to September, even before the official start of the new ratings season.

The movie has never been officially released on VHS or DVD. In 2012, the New York Times reported on a brief spat over the credits for the film, which is likely the most ever written about the movie since 1982, albeit about a minor issue.

It was first printed by the Shakers in 1812.  Background The Shakers began writing down their hymns as a means of conveying their religious philosophy to new converts. Thousands of handwritten hymns were recorded in hundreds of manuscripts. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the Shakers began moving west from New York, into Ohio and Kentucky. By the first decade of the nineteenth century, there were at least five communities and as many as twenty in Ohio and Kentucky. This western expansion brought about the idea for collecting the hymns into a printed book. The scribes could no longer keep up with the pace of copying new hymns that were being composed both at New Lebanon in New York and in the western communities, where fully two-thirds of the hymns were being written. From this body of handwritten hymns were selected the 140 hymns published in Millennial Praises. Description Millennial Praises was the first published Shaker hymn book. Many printed Shaker hymn books followed. The Millennial Praises hymnal contained only the words of the 140 hymns, without any musical notation. The hymns were about Christ, God, love, praise, work, and the growth of the Shaker communities. The hymns also conveyed the idea that males and females are equal - an idea connected to the value of celibacy in Shakerism. The first hymn in the Millennial Praises reflects the Shaker viewpoint that God is both male and female. The Shakers claimed that nearly all the words in the hymn book were spiritual \\"gifts\\", and that only a few words were derived from other sources. The first edition, compiled by Seth Y. Wells and edited by Richard McNemar of the Union Village Shaker settlement, was titled Millennial Praises Parts I and II Containing a Collection of Gospel Hymns. It was printed at Hancock, Massachusetts, in 1812. The 1813 edition, again published in Hancock, had four parts and was titled Millennial Praises, Containing a Collection of Gospel Hymns in Four Parts, adapted to the day of Christ's second appearing - composed for the use of his people. McNemar composed about 70 of the 140 hymns and about a dozen were written by Issachar Bates, a Shaker poet. In Spiritual Wine (see hymn illustration), Bates uses the drunkenness one gets from wine as a metaphor for the Shakers' philosophy of drunkenness through spiritual wine.  Adaptation to music  About the time of the publication of Millennial Praises, the Shakers began to record song melodies using different systems. The \\"letteral notations\\" for adaptation of the hymns to music was slowly developed over the next few decades. There were debates as to which system was the best to achieve uniformity among all the Shaker villages. They developed a \\"tone-ometer\\" to set a consistent pitch for the songs and a \\"mode-ometer\\" to set the tempo. In 1843 Isaac N. Youngs published his instruction manual, A Short Abridgement of the Rules of Music. In 1847 Russell Haskell published his instruction manual, The Musical Expositor. The first hymn book published with musical notation, using many of the Millennial Praises hymns, was produced in 1852 by Henry Blinn under the title, A Sacred Repository of Hymns.

It is available in Polish at https://rejestr.kwalifikacje.gov.pl/. The IQR can include various types of qualifications awarded in Poland. Qualifications will be entered into the IQR regardless of whether they are included in other registers (lists, inventories) of qualifications kept by various ministries, sectors, communities and institutions. The entry of a qualification into the Integrated Register means that the credibility of such qualification has been confirmed by public authorities and that a given qualification has been assigned to a PQF level. Qualifications not entered into the IQR will not be assigned to a Polish Qualifications Framework level. The terms and conditions for entering qualifications into the IQR shall be determined by provisions of the law. The descriptions of all qualifications in the IQR will be presented in a uniform format. The information gathered in the IQR will be accessible through an NQS internet portal, integrated with the EQF portal. The IQR will play the role of a unique \\"link\\" between qualifications sub-systems that have been operating autonomously until now. The Integrated Qualifications Register will be a collaborative effort of central and local government institutions, the education system and higher education institutions, employer organisations, trade unions, other employee organisations and civil society organisations. The entry of a qualification into the national register will mean that such a qualification has been assigned to a PQF level. Therefore, a registered qualification (both \\"full\\" and \\"partial\\") will also be referenced to a level of the European Qualifications Framework. The integrated qualifications register will be operated as a repository of all data relevant to the qualifications it includes, stored in electronic format. The integrated qualifications system will be the core component of the national qualifications system. The integrated qualifications system features elements which are already present in the social and economic life of Poland, as well as currently developed measures that will facilitate the effective integration of the entire system, i.e., the Polish Qualifications Framework, the Integrated Qualifications Register, common terminology and general principles for the quality assurance of qualifications. Qualifications outside of the integrated system for which there is a social demand will continue to be available in Poland, but they will not be assigned to a Polish Qualifications Framework level or entered into the Integrated Qualifications System. The integrated qualifications system is a key lifelong learning policy tool. Its effectiveness depends not only establishing sound legal and organisational regulations or the commitment of institutions and organisations operating within its framework, but also on society's understanding of these solutions. In the long-term perspective, society's understanding of the national qualifications system, of the new opportunities that will emerge as a result of its modernisation, may be the most important factor in achieving the goals for which these activities were undertaken. Therefore, it will be essential to promote and popularise information about these issues, among other ways, by publishing periodical reports about Polish qualifications. The integrated qualifications system will include all aspects related to the validation of learning outcomes undertaken in Poland. It will become a tool to facilitate implementation of the state's lifelong learning policy based on a partnership of central government, territorial government, employers, employees and civil society. Developing the national qualifications system is a task of state authorities. Ministers directly accountable for qualifications will have a special role to play. Implementation of the integrated qualifications system will provide the substantive support for their activities. A pivotal role within the system will also be played by an internet portal (the NQS portal), facilitating access to information and contributing to greater transparency of the overall system. The effectiveness of the system will also depend on social partners; therefore, it is essential to adequately identify their role and joint responsibilities. The ongoing commitment of stakeholders is vital for the successful implementation of the national qualifications system. The integrated qualifications register is an essential lifelong learning policy tool to benefit various stakeholder groups: * It creates new prospects for personal development and career planning in Poland and abroad for individuals seeking to obtain qualifications. * It provides employers with assistance not only in hiring persons with the appropriate competences, but also in better planning activities to support the professional development of their employees. * It provides public agencies, institutions and non-governmental organisations performing various public tasks with greater access to a repository of information about the qualifications available in the market.

He held office at a time of social unrest and declining interest in the priesthood. In 1966 he was an episcopal member of the Pontifical Commission on Birth Control. After his retirement in 1974 due to health problems he returned his award of the Legion of Honour in protest against the law on abortion. Early years Claude Marie Joseph Dupuy was born in Chevri√®res, Loire on 13 September 1901. His older brother died in 1916 during the Battle of the Somme when he was preparing to become a priest. This may have inspired Claude Dupuy to become a priest. He studied at the S√©minaire universitaire de Lyon. He was ordained a priest on 20 March 1926. He received a doctorate in theology with a thesis on the \\"Triumph of the Cross\\", an apologetic work on Savonarola. Priest and Bishop In 1928 Dupuy was appointed vicar of the working-class Izieux parish of Saint-Chamond, Loire, and iron and coal region. In 1946 Cardinal Pierre-Marie Gerlier called him to manage diocesan works. He was named diocesan chaplain of students, and was placed in charge of the press and the Semaine religieuse journal. From 1953 he was vicar-general of the archdiocese of Lyon and part of Rh√¥ne Nord. On 7 March 1955 he was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Lyon and Titular Bishop of Selia. He was ordained Titular Bishop of Selia on 27 April 1955. Archbishop On 4 December 1961 Dupuy was appointed Archbishop of Albi. As archbishop Dupuy instituted the Council of the Presbytery, the Diocesan Committee of Pastoral Care and many diocesan commissions. He placed great emphasis on collegiality, delegating authority and insisting that the work of the diocese be shared between the bishop and the priests. In the spirit of ecumenism he twinned the diocese with the Anglican Diocese of Chester in 1972. The diocese struggled during his time in office with a decline in priests, and in 1963 he had to drop Sunday services in the smaller rural parishes. He also consolidated urban and rural parishes. However, he built new places of worship in the growing suburbs of Albi, Castres and Graulhet. He was involved in social issues, including mining conflicts in 1962‚Äì63, returnees from Algeria, the threatened closure of the Saut-du-Tarn steel plant in 1968 and the other social disturbances of 1968. Dupuy was an episcopal member of the Pontifical Commission on Birth Control. He was named to the fifth and final session of the Commission, which started in April 1966 and lasted almost three months until the end of June. This was the session where decisions were to be made. Dupuy was responsible for the \\"pastoral approaches\\" letter. This said \\"the church remains faithfully attached to the divine imperatives of the unity, stability and fecundity of marriage. It said that procreation was one of the ends of marriage, but that there were other ends including love between the married couple, education and upbringing of children and providing a basic unit for society. On the issue of contraception it said \\"what is always to be condemned is not the regulation of conception, but an egotistic married life, refusing a creative opening-out of the family circle ... this is the anti- conception that is against the Christian ideal of marriage. The pastoral introduction in French accompanied the draft Document concerning Responsible Parenthood (Schema Documenti de Responsabili Paternitate), the one part of the final report that was leaked. The commission could not reach agreement, and in the end Pope Paul VI set out the official church position in the encyclical Humanae vitae issued on 25 July 1968. The pastoral letter was published in The Tablet on 21 September 1968. Last years Dupuy retired on 15 June 1974. He was suffering from heart problems, and in July 1974 moved to the retirement home for priests of the diocese in Vernaison. Towards the end of 1974 he returned the award of the Legion of Honour to President Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing in protest against the new law on abortion. Claude Dupuy died on 13 February 1989.

It is located on the southern shore of Tutuila, the largest island of American Samoa, a short way south of the village of Vaitogi. The feature known as Turtle and Shark is a U-shaped cove, set between Vaitogi Beach to the north and a basalt cliff to the south. The cove is about measured from east to west and measured from north to south. The topography of the cove is such that it is frequently subjected to high-energy wave action, with spray thrown high into the air. The cove is believed by the Samoan populace to be the location of the climactic scene of the Turtle and Shark legend, one of the island's best-known and popular tales. The earliest documented form of the Turtle and Shark legend was published in 1884 by a missionary: > A story is told of a woman and her child, who in a time of great scarcity > were neglected by the family. One day they cooked some wild yams, but never > offered her a share. She was vexed, asked the child to follow her, and when > they reached a precipice on the rocky coast, seized the child and jumped > over. It is said they were changed into turtles, and afterwards came in that > form at the call of the people of the village. By the early 20th century, the tale had been altered to involve a ritual for avoiding famine, and had become strongly attached to the cove at Vaitogi. The village was described by anthropologist Margaret Mead as the site of the \\"famous\\" legend. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014.

Built between about 1844 and 1858 were four houses in a row, three of which exhibit classical Greek temple-front facades, and assemblage that is unique in the rural interior of the state. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The village of North Anson is located on the north bank of the Carrabassett River, shortly before it empties into the Kennebec River in southern Somerset County, Maine. Madison Street extends eastward from the village center. On the south side of Madison Street stand four houses that are remarkably similar in construction and style. Three stand to the west of Winter Street, and one to the east. All are 1-1/2 stories in height, with wood framing and clapboard siding. All have a front-facing gable roof, and three of them have a Greek temple portico supported by three Doric columns. The two westernmost houses are virtually identical, with a detailed Doric entablature encircling the eave and an ornamented Greek Revival entrance surround. The house at the eastern end is similar to these, but has less detailing on the entablature and entrance surround. The fourth house lacks a temple front, although it may at one time have had one. It has thick pilasters at the corners and a simple entablature, and is fronted by a Colonial Revival porch. Its front facade is also finished in flushboard, and there is an Italianate round-arch window in the gable. The exact date of construction of the houses is not known, nor is the identity of the (likely single) builder. They were probably built between about 1844 and 1852, late in the Greek Revival period. The house with Italianate features was owned by a carpenter, Ebenezer F. Witherill, and the other three were owned by businessmen and merchants. It is surmised that Witherill built all four houses, and added the Italianate features to his own house (removing its temple front) to showcase architectural fashion trends.

Alongside contemporary feminists Mohtaram Eskandari and Noor-ol-Hoda Mangeneh, she co- founded the radicalist Patriotic Women's League of Iran in Tehran in 1922. She became the society's president in 1925 and held the position until 1932.Women and the political process in twentieth-century Iran. Cambridge University Press, 1997, ,  Early life  Mastoureh Afshar was born in 1898 in Urmia, West Azerbaijan. She was the daughter of Majd al Saltaneh Afshar, an intellectual Iranian nationalist. Afshar was educated in Russia and spoke Persian, Azeri, Turkish and French. She had four siblings; her eldest brother was Jalal Afshar Orami, the father of Iranian entomology. Her sister Turan Afshar was also an entomologist whereas her other two sisters Alca and Heide were active politically as members of the Patriotic Women's League alongside Mastoureh. In the aftermath of the Persian Constitutional Revolution, multiple women's rights organizations came into existence. Afshar, alongside her contemporaries Sediqeh Dowlatabadi, Mohtaram Eskandari and others, advocated for the creation of girls schools and development of political rights for women. She co-founded the Patriotics Womens League in 1922 which was headed by Mohtaram Eskandari until 1925 after Eskandari died of spinal surgery complications at the age of 29. She assumed the leadership role until 1932. She attended the first conference on Muslim women held in Damascus in 1930, as part of the Iranian delegation alongside Sediqeh Dowlatabadi and Tabatai. In 1932, she was invited by the Iranian government to organize and open the second Eastern Women's Congress in Tehran from November 27 to December 2 of the same year. The congress was attended by women from 15 countries ranging from Australia and Afghanistan to Zanzibar. The Congress passed a 22-point resolution which promoted women's suffrage, equal opportunities in education and work, the reformation of family law, and prohibition of polygamy and prostitution. However, after the Congress ended, the government took over the Patriotics Womens League and it ceased to exist. She remained unmarried and died in Tehran in 1951 of breast cancer.

The Hoher Ochsenkopf is the sunlit kuppe in the right half of the picture; its summit is just below the Hornisgrinde transmission tower. The Hoher Ochsenkopf (\\"High Ochsenkopf\\", literally \\"High Oxen Peak\\") is a mountain in the Northern Black Forest in the municipality of Forbach in south Germany. At it is the highest point in Forbach and also in the county of Rastatt. The mountain, whose domed summit or kuppe was already a nature reserve lies in the Black Forest National Park which was founded in 2014.Bonde: Nationalpark in den Gebieten Ruhestein und Ochsenkopf. In: Stuttgarter Zeitung online dated 4 June 2013 Its name (which means \\"high oxen- peak\\") recalls its former use as wood pasture.Rudolf Metz: Mineralogisch- landeskundliche Wanderungen im Nordschwarzwald, besonders in dessen alten Bergbaurevieren. 2nd, fully revised edition, Schauenburg, Lahr, 1977, , p. 79.  Location  The Hoher Ochsenkopf lies about six kilometres northeast of the highest mountain in the Northern Black Forest, the Hornisgrinde, which is 108 metres higher. Like the Badener H√∂he three kilometres north it is part of an eastern spur of the main chain of the northern Black Forest, which runs between the Upper Rhine Plain and the Murg valley. This spur is bounded by two western side valleys of the Murg, the valley of the Hundsbach with the Forbach village of Hundsbach in the south and the Schwarzenbach valley with the village of Herrenwies in the north and the Schwarzenbach Dam in the northeast. The Hoher Ochsenkopf is linked to the Mittlerer Ochsenkopf (\\"middle oxen- peak\\", 1,004.9 m) to the south over the Kegelplatz, a 977-metre-high saddle. The 964-metre-high Vorderer Ochsenkopf (\\"anterior oxen-peak\\") adjoins the Mittlerer Ochsenkopf to the south and, further east, is the N√§geliskopf (994 m). In the northwest, the 948-metre-high saddle of Dreikohlplatten links the Hoher Ochsenkopf to the Mehliskopf (1008 m).  Hoher Ochsenkopf Nature Reserve  The flat and once deforested domed summit or kuppe, then a typical grinde of the Northern Black Forest, was used in past centuries as pasture. The forest recolonised the area after grazing ended. In 1970 a Bannwald forest, 41.1 hectares in area, was declared around the summit and, in 1975, it was turned into a nature reserve. In 1986, in order to protect the capercaillie, a bird reserve, 600 ha in area, was declared around the Hoher Ochsenkopf. In 2000 the Bannwald was extended to an area of 100.7 ha and complemented by the surrounding, 427 ha of Schonwald, a form of semi-protected forest, called the N√§geliskopf. Numerous rare and endangered animal and plant species have settled here, including the three-toed woodpecker, which had been extinct for many years in the Black Forest.  Development  The Teufelskamin (\\"Devil's Chimney\\") on the Hoher Ochsenkopf The Hoher Ochsenkopf is accessible on foot from Hundseck on the Black Forest High Road over a roughly three- kilometre-long ridgeway or after a steep climb from Herrenwies or Hundsbach- Aschenplatz/Bridge along the Kirchweg. The start point is the √∂stlichen Dreikohlplatten. From there a path marked by blue and white wooden posts leads initially gently uphill. Later it becomes unmarked and climbs steeply uphill to the point, where there used to be a seven-metre-high observation tower, built in 1902, that was replaced in 1927 by a 12-metre-high stone tower. After a lightning strike, it was blown up by the Technisches Hilfswerk in 1971. Even today the rubble pile of stone blocks is still visible. The path continues uphill towards the Teufelskamin (\\"Devil's Chimney\\"), an open fault in the Bunter sandstone that appears as a 20-metre-deep cave. Around the Hoher Ochsenkopf runs the almost level Becker Way (Beckerweg), a circular walk re- established by the Black Forest Club branches of Hornisgrinde, Achern, B√ºhl and Baden-Baden in 2003. The path is named after Daniel Becker from Frankfurt, who stayed in the old Kurhaus at Hundseck more than 100 years ago and explored the region around the Hoher Ochsenkopf.

It was founded in 1856. The high school was established in the Ottoman Empire as a missionary school for girls only. It was later transformed into a co-educational status. Education from preparatory class through twelfth grade is in the French and Turkish language, and takes four years after a preparatory class of one school year. History A group of eleven French nuns travelled to Istanbul arriving on October 7, 1856. They took over the administration of Maison du Saint- Esprit, a boarding school in Pangaltƒ± neighborhood, which was named after the 1846-built Cathedral of the Holy Spirit next to it, and was run by the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul (), a society of apostolic life for women within the Catholic Church. The official opening of the French boarding school under the name Lyc√©e Notre Dame de Sion took place on November 27 the same year. It became the first ever girls' school in Turkey. Inƒ±tially a boarding school for Christian girls, it shortly after attracted Jewish pupils. From 1863 on, Muslim girls attended the school following the interest of the notable families in the Empire and the approval of the Ottoman Sultan. The school closed down during World War I when the French nuns left the country as a result of the war being so hard and their country being at war with Turkey. In 1919, the school reopened. With the foundation of the Turkish Republic in 1923, the school was subordinated to the Ministry of National Education, and Turkish administrators and teachers joined the school staff. It began also to serve as a day school. The primary school section was abandoned in 1971, and the boarding school in 1972. From 1989 on, the head of the school administration was handed over to a secular rector while the nuns remained serving in the school as well. After a 140-year long tradition of girls only school, it went co-educational, accepting boys with the 1996‚Äì97 school year. Cultural projects An international piano contest was organized by the school in 2013. A chamber music concert was performed in the school in 2014 in commemoration of harpist Fatma Ceren Necipoƒülu, who died at the Air France Flight 447 accident in 2009. In 2015, the art gallery of the school hosted an exhibition titled \\"Osmanlƒ±'dan Cumhuriyet'e Kadƒ±nlar\\" (literally:Women from the Ottoman Empire to the Turkish Republic) showing Christian, Jewish and Muslim women mainly on postcards from 1880 to 1930.

In its official website, Ni una menos defines itself as a \\"collective scream against machista violence.\\" The campaign was started by a collective of Argentine female artists, journalists and academics, and has grown into \\"a continental alliance of feminist forces\\". The movement regularly holds protests against femicides, but has also touched on topics such as gender roles, sexual harassment, gender pay gap, sexual objectification, legality of abortion, sex workers' rights and transgender rights. The movement became nationally recognized with the use of the hashtag #NiUnaMenos on social media, title under which massive demonstrations were held on June 3, 2015, having the Palace of the Argentine National Congress as a main meeting point. The protest was organized after the murder of 14-year-old Chiara Paez, found buried underneath her boyfriend's house on May 11, beaten to death and a few weeks pregnant. A viral phenomenon which extended to countries such as Uruguay and Chile, it managed to congregate around 200,000 people in Buenos Aires alone. On June 3, 2016 the multitudinous demonstration took place once again throughout Argentina's most important cities, under the new slogan #VivasNosQueremos (English: #WeWantUsAlive); the march was also replicated in Montevideo, Uruguay and Santiago, Chile. A #NiUnaMenos march also took place in Lima, Peru on August 13, 2016, with thousands of people gathering in front of the Palace of Justice. Newspaper La Rep√∫blica considered it the largest demonstration in Peruvian history. On October 19, 2016 the Ni una menos collective organized a first-ever women mass strike in Argentina, in response to the murder of 16-year-old Luc√≠a P√©rez, who was raped and impaled in the coastal city of Mar del Plata. It consisted of a one-hour pause from work and study early in the afternoon, with protesters dressed in mourning for what was known as Mi√©rcoles negro (Spanish for \\"Black Wednesday\\"). These protests became region-wide and gave the movement a greater international momentum, with street demonstrations also taking place in Chile, Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico and Spain. A week later, a protest also took place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which has been considered \\"yet another clear sign that Ni una menos has become a rallying cry for the region.\\" On March 8, 2017, Ni una menos took part of the International Women's Strike. The strike was spearheaded in the United States by the leaders of the Women's March on Washington, who in a call to arms letter in The Guardian pointed to Ni una menos as an inspiration. In 2016, Argentine scientists Juli√°n Petruleviƒçius and Pedro Guti√©rrez named Tupacsala niunamenos, a dragonfly species found in La Rioja, after the movement. The genus Tupacsala was chosen in honor of T√∫pac Amaru II and Milagro Sala's organization named after him. Origin The collective takes its name from a 1995 phrase by Mexican poet and activist Susana Ch√°vez, \\"Ni una muerta m√°s\\" (Spanish for \\"Not one more [woman] dead\\"), in protest to the female homicides in Ciudad Ju√°rez. Ch√°vez herself was assassinated in 2011, moment in which the phrase became a \\"symbol of struggle\\". The first protest organized by Ni una menos was held in Recoleta, Buenos Aires on March 26, 2015, and consisted of a reading marathon, performance art and screenings; the catalyst of the event was the murder of Daiana Garc√≠a, found dead in a garbage bag on March 16.

The site has been radiocarbon dated to c. 8550 BCE, and is a rare example in the state of a completely undisturbed (unplowed), stratified site. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Description The Hedden Site, named for its discoverer, Maine archaeologist Mark Hedden, is in an area composed of dune-like wind-blown sands that have been stabilized by grasses and blueberry bushes that have taken hold. There is no evidence that colonial or modern agriculture has taken place, although it was probably pine forest that was cleared at some time. These dune formations are consistent with others in Maine that were apparently deposited about 11,000 years ago (c. 8000 BCE), most of which have been disturbed in some way. There is some evidence that fire had swept the area, although it was unclear if the fire was caused by humans. The site was discovered during a test survey in 1990, whose test pits had largely had negative results, when Hedden spotted a stone flake on the surface. Most of the materials recovered were found in test pits dug around this find site.Spiess, Arthur (1991). NRHP nomination for Hedden Site; redacted version available by request from the National Park Service Finds at the site include stone fragments from a variety of regional sources, ranging from sources in the Hudson River valley to Munsungan quarries of northern Maine. One well-shaped stone tool, a chert \\"endscraper\\", was found, as was a second, fragmentary piece, still razor sharp, that had apparently been used once and then discarded.

The society believed that the church should follow the liturgical development of the European continental church and remain faithful to the Roman Rite used by Rome, and that the best means to accomplish this was to produce missals and other prayer books for this liturgical tradition. The society worked closely with the illustrator Martin Travers to produce the desired aesthetic for this movement. The society was responsible for the creation of the Anglican Missal, a liturgical book still used by some Anglo-Catholics and other high-church Anglicans as a supplement to the Book of Common Prayer.

Other artists whose Canadian debuts he orchestrated included Jos√© Carreras, Pl√°cido Domingo, Samuel Ramey, and Beverly Sills. A graduate of the Strathcona Academy in Montr√©al (1941‚Äì1946) and The Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto (1947‚Äì1952), Guttman was awarded Honorary Doctor of Letters from the University of Winnipeg (1995) and the University of British Columbia (2009).

She spent 55 years in India treating leprosy and tuberculosis patients, associating with the state and central governments or independently under the aegis of the trust she founded in 1955. The Government of India awarded her the fourth highest Indian civilian honour of Padma Shri in 1981. Biography Claire Marie was born on 29 October 1926 in Antwerp, Belgium to Lucie Roebroek and Fernand Evariste Marc Alfred Vellut, an insurance inspector, as the youngest of their six children. She completed her schooling at Institut Saint- Andr√©, Ixelles and secured her graduate degree in medicine in 1952 from the Catholic University of Leuven during which period she was involved with the activities of the International Fraternal Association, an organization founded by Vincent Lebbe, a Lazarist priest. She also did an advanced course, Diploma in Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and did English language training in 1953. In 1954, she received the offer to work at the Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute and Hospital, New Delhi but chose to accept the invitation from Frans Hemerijckx, a Belgian leprologist, to join him in India to open an ambulatory leprosy control project at Polambakkam, a leprosy endemic small village near Kanchipuram in the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Clinic Under the Trees Claire, along with Frans Hemerijckx, established a Leprosy Centre based at Polambakkam in 1955. The centre, with Vellut and Hemerijckx in the lead, started mobile clinical service called, Clinic under the Trees, a set up where patients were treated in makeshift open clinics set up under the trees. The system carried on for five years till the local government took over the operations with Vellut continuing as its medical officer. She also did a short training course in leprosy at the Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine during this time. Vellut continued with the activities of the trust for 55 years till 2009 and continued her association till her final departure from India in 2012. During her time in Polambakkam, she is reported to have treated over 31000 patients. She was a member of the Damien Foundation in Belgium and in 1992, founded the Indian chapter of the organization under the name, Damien Foundation Trust India. She was also associated with Setukaran Project', an initiative by a group of women led by Kavari, the daughter in law of Frans Hemerijckx, for providing mass education to the rural women, as a co-founder and a member of their governing council. Later years Death of a few people close to her in 2008 influenced Vellut to think about returning to Belgium and she spent most of the next three years travelling between Belgium, Mauritius and India. From 2009 onwards, she started engaging herself with the activities of the International Fraternal Association in Brussels by looking after the office duties and routine chores of the organization. She left India for the final time in July 2012. Claire Vellut, who remained a spinster throughout her life, died on 20 September 2013, at the age of 87, at her room at the premises of the Little Sisters of the Poor in Brussels. Her mortal remains were buried at Banneux cemetery in Brussels. After the death, her friends and relatives shared their memories and testimonies which have been compiled and hosted in a web site, , as a tribute to the Belgian humanist. Awards and honours The Government of India awarded her the civilian honour of Padma Shri in 1981. The Catholic University of Louvain conferred a doctorate (honoris causa) on her in 1989. When the Government of India celebrated the 50th anniversary of Indian independence in 1997, Claire Vellut was one among the 50 women awarded with Stree Ratna honour.

It is independent of the state, and can follow its own teaching approach, which is structured and places great stress on repetition to drive home what has been learned. The school has many well-known alumni including the actress Brigitte Bardot and the French President Jacques Chirac. Hattemer is located in Paris, in the 8th and 16th districts. Description The school was founded by Rose Hattemer of Alsace in 1885. The founder taught some of the great Parisian families towards the end of the 19th century, and developed a method of teaching by correspondence for the children of diplomats, which is still followed today. The school was originally located on rue Clapeyron in the 8th arrondissement of Paris. It is now housed in a five-story building erected nearby on rue de Londres in 1935 to accommodate a growing number of pupils. There is a cafeteria, gym and playground. The school provides flexible hours, so a student may take time to practice an instrument or train for a sport. When Brigitte Bardot was admitted to the Cours Hattemer at the age of seven during World War II (1939‚Äì45) she only had to go to school three days a week, and otherwise studied at home. This gave her time to take dancing lessons. In the period after World War II the school was one of the few that encouraged art, and thereby attracted pupils from the families of actors or public figures. It catered to children who were \\"special cases\\" such as Fran√ßoise Sagan and her classmate Florence Malraux, daughter of Andr√© Malraux, who attended in the early 1950s. There are about 1,500 students from kindergarten to the Baccalaur√©at (high school certificate), half of whom learn by correspondence. Classes have 15‚Äì25 students. Syllabus Hattemer is a private school that is not under contract to the government and so has freedom to set its own curriculum and teaching methods. Students and their parents are screened to ensure they agree that a child who is learning is a happy child. The school's teachers write the textbooks. The school uses structure and repetition in its classes. Constant repetition of content in oral and written questions includes reviews of what was learned in a day, a week and a year. In 2017, Hattemer joined the international NACE Schools group. Notable alumni The walls of the school are lined with photographs of famous alumni, including Brigitte Bardot, Jacques Chirac, Christophe Dechavanne, Jean d'Ormesson, Michel Polnareff, V√©ronique Sanson and Anne Sinclair. Other notable alumni include: *Aga Khan IV (born 1936), businessman, Imam of Nizari Ismailism *B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i (1913‚Äì97), last emperor of Vietnam *Alain Calmat (born 1940), skater, surgeon, politician *Claude Cheysson (1920‚Äì2012), politician *Bruno Cremer (1929‚Äì2010), actor *Bernard Debr√© (born 1944), urologist, politician *Patrick Dewaere (1947‚Äì82), film actor *Dominique Fr√©my (1931‚Äì2008), creator of the Quid encyclopedia *Jacques Friedel (1921‚Äì2014), physicist, material scientist *Jacques de Lacretelle (1888‚Äì1985), novelist *Jacques Laffite (born 1943), racing driver, TV commentator *Christine Ockrent (born 1944), journalist *Michel Poniatowski (1922‚Äì2002), politician *Anne Queff√©lec (born 1948), classical pianist *Rainier III, Prince of Monaco (1923‚Äì2005), ruler of Monaco *√âdouard de Rothschild (born 1957), businessman *Fran√ßoise Sagan (1935‚Äì2004), playwright, novelist *Jean-Paul Sartre (1905‚Äì80), philosopher, playwright, novelist *Princess St√©phanie of Monaco (born 1965), singer, fashion model.

Pit brow women or pit brow lasses were female surface labourers at British collieries. They worked at the coal screens on the pit bank (or brow) at the shaft top until the 1960s. Their job was to pick stones from the coal after it was hauled to the surface. More women were employed in this capacity on the Lancashire Coalfield than in any other area. Background In the early coal industry women and girls worked underground alongside men and boys in small coal pits. It was common practice in Lancashire and Cumberland, Yorkshire, the East of Scotland and South Wales. The death of Elizabeth Higginson working underground was recorded in the register of Wigan Parish Church in 1641. An article in the Gentleman's Magazine in 1795 described Betty Hodson aged nine who worked underground with her brother, aged seven, dragging baskets of coals for their father. From the 1600s in Lancashire it was common for whole families to be employed in the pits. Colliers relied on their wives, sons and daughters who were employed as drawers. The daughters of colliers usually married within the mining community. As the industry grew the population expanded and more members of extended mining families obtained work. Pitwork in south-west Lancashire resulted in the area around Wigan having the highest rates of female employment in the country in the 19th century. On 4 July 1838, a flash flood at the Huskar Pit near Silkstone in Yorkshire caused the deaths of 26 children aged from seven to 17 who were drowned while trying to escape. The disaster led to a public outcry and subsequent Royal Commission led by Anthony Ashley Cooper. Until the Mines and Collieries Act 1842 was passed prohibiting boys under ten years of age and all women and girls from working underground in coal mines, it was common for women and children to work shifts of 11 or 12 hours underground. Children as young as five or six worked as trappers opening and closing ventilation doors before becoming hurriers, pushing tubs of coal to the shaft bottom. After the 1842 Act The prohibition of underground female labour caused much suffering and hardship and was greatly resented in south-west Lancashire. The employment of women did not end abruptly in 1842, with the connivance of some employers, women dressed as men continued to work underground for several years. Penalties for employing women were small and inspectors were few and some women were so desperate for work they willingly worked illegally for less pay. Children continued working underground at some pits. At Coppull Colliery's Burgh Pit, three females died after an explosion in November 1846, one was eleven years old. A photo of pit girls in South Wales, from the late Victorian period Not all women who had worked underground gained employment as surface workers. Lighter work on the surface had traditionally been reserved for older men and men who had been injured below ground and some colliery owners considered pits unsuitable places for women. Other colliery owners were happy to employ women who had proved themselves reliable and strong workers and were used to the language and habits of the miners. Male surface workers earned twice the wages of the women who worked twelve-hour shifts, five days a week and a shorter shift on Saturdays. Women surface workers were concentrated in Scotland, South Wales, Cumberland, Shropshire and South Staffordshire and Lancashire. Dress Pit-brow women working outside in the cold and dirt developed a distinctive \\"uniform\\", they wore clogs, trousers covered with a skirt and apron, old flannel jackets or shawls and headscarfs to protect their hair from coal dust. The women's unconventional but practical dress drew them to the attention of the public and carte de visite and cabinet card portraits and later postcards of them in working clothes were produced commercially and sold to visitors as noveties. Photographic studios in Wigan which produced such work were Louisa Millard (in the late-1860s), Cooper (between 1853 and 1892) and Wragg (which produced a series of at least 18 studio images). Arthur Munby, a Cambridge University academic with an interest in women who worked in dirty and unusual conditions, commissioned many photographs. Munby visited the Wigan area many times over many years, interviewing working-class women and recording in his diaries what they had to say about their jobs, pay and living-conditions.

History The land on which the school location stands was originally part of the Louis Barthelemy Macarty plantation. After Macarty died in 1846, philanthropist John McDonogh purchased the property and donated it to the City of New Orleans. McDonough also donated other properties and money for use of New Orleans public schools. McDonogh No. 12 From 1880 to 1939, McDonogh No. 12, was located on the site on St. Claude Avenue. Francis T. Nicholls High School McDonogh No. 12 was demolished to make way for Francis T. Nicholls High School. Initially named for Francis T. Nicholls, a former Confederate general, governor of Louisiana, and Chief Justice of the Louisiana Supreme Court, the school opened as a segregated white institution on January 29, 1940. The Nicholls High school newspaper was named The Rebel Yell. Frederick Douglass Senior High School During the middle 1990s, having since long been desegregated, Nicholls High School was renamed Frederick Douglass Senior High School in honor of the African-American abolitionist Frederick Douglass of Maryland. The renaming of the school was part of a campaign to remove the names of Confederate leaders from public schools in Orleans Parish. During the 1990s, Nicholls/Douglass faced increased narcotics usage and crime in the surrounding area. Stronger students abandoned the school for magnet schools with selective admissions, such as McDonogh 35. \\"People considered Douglass totally out of control,\\" said Vincent Lee Nzinga (born November 1941), a Ninth Ward resident who became the principal in 1997. Custodians even declined to stock the school with trash cans and toilet paper. The school had seven principals in a four-year period and a large turnover of teachers. In 2008, Orleans Parish had about 33,000 students, compared to its peak of 115,000 in 1970. In recent years, white flight to the suburbs, a weak economy with lack of employment prospects, and Hurricane Katrina all took their toll on the community, its schools, and families. In December 2008, unruly pupils set six fires at Douglass High School in either trash cans or bathrooms. Because of repeated poor academic performance, Douglass High School was taken over and governed by the statewide Recovery School District. In 2010, the school had only 291 pupils (since 296) in grades nine through twelve, virtually all blacks, ten students for every instructor. More than 70 percent were then eligible for free or reduced-priced lunches. KIPP Renaissance High School In 2010, KIPP Renaissance High School was founded in the former Nicholls High School and Douglass High School building. The school became a public charter school under the management of KIPP New Orleans Schools. In 2016, KIPP Renaissance earned an \\"A\\" letter grade from the Louisiana Department of Education. Frederick A. Douglass High School In 2019, KIPP Renaissance High School name was reverted to Frederick A. Douglass High School. The high school remained a public charter school under the management of KIPP New Orleans Schools. Athletics Douglass High School athletics competes in the LHSAA. The Nicholls High School sports teams were nicknamed the \\"Rebels\\". The Douglass Senior High School sports teams were renamed \\"Bobcats\\" in the early 1990s.

Working alongside some of the world‚Äôs greatest magicians, Macknik and Martinez-Conde studied how conjuring techniques trick the brain. Sleights of Mind considers the greater implications of magic and misdirection for clinical conditions such as autism, and for everyday life situations, including choice and trust in personal and business relationships. Sleights of Mind is the result of Macknik and Martinez-Conde‚Äôs yearlong, world-wide exploration of magic and how its principles apply to human behavior. Sleights of Mind introduces Neuromagic as a new area of scientific endeavor, a discipline aimed to uncover the interaction between brain science and the art of magic. Macknik and Martinez-Conde propose that understanding how the mind perceives magic and illusion will provide a greater understanding of perception and cognition at large. Synopsis Macknik and Martinez-Conde say that magic tricks fool us because humans have hardwired processes of attention and awareness that are hackable. Good magicians use our inherent mental and neural limitations against us by leading us to perceive and feel what we are neurologically inclined to. Working with renowned magicians like Apollo Robbins, Teller, Mac King, and James Randi, Macknik and Martinez-Conde research the ways in which the perceptual and cognitive elements of magic relate to more than simple deceits. The authors reveal the neural underpinnings of the magical methods that explain how our brains perceive magic. Through their exploration, Macknik and Martinez-Conde uncover how our brains work in everyday situations. They describe how if you have ever bought an expensive item you had sworn you would never buy, the salesperson was creating the ‚Äúillusion of choice,‚Äù a core technique of magic. They also relate the use of magic to Bernie Madoff‚Äôs ‚Äúillusion of trust‚Äù. Through these examples, Macknik‚Äôs and Martinez-Conde‚Äôs Sleights of Mind illuminates the reasons for studying magic, and its implications for research on, and renewed understanding of, perceptual and cognitive processes.

The aim of the society was and still is the promotion of the visual arts.  Early history  In 1946, a period of renewed optimism after the Second World War, a group of young artists eager to exhibit together founded the Colchester Art Society. Some of its founding members were Roderic Barrett, Edward Bawden, Henry Collins, Reg Hazel, Cedric Morris, John Nash, Joyce Pallot, Rowland Suddaby, and Sylvia St. George. The Colchester Art Society was founded following a meeting of local artists called by Reg Hazell who at the time was the head of the Colchester School of Arts. The initial meeting was attended by Henry Collins, Roderic Barrett and the children's illustrator Jenny Ward. Following this initial meeting Cedric Morris and Arthur Lett-Haines who ran the East Anglian School of Painting and Drawing joined the group alongside Joyce Pallot, Sylvia St George and others. The painter John Nash RA was invited to be the Society's first president and remained president until his death in 1977.Stokes, V. 2008 Colchester Institute: Selected works from the Colchester Art Society Collection Exhibition Catalogue, The Minories Other presidents of the Society have included Cedric Morris, Roderic Barrett and Anthony Atkinson.

After the 2014‚Äì15 South Pacific cyclone season had officially ended, a rare subtropical cyclone was identified outside of the basin near Easter Island, during early May, and was unofficially dubbed Katie by researchers. Katie was one of the few tropical or subtropical systems ever observed forming in the far Southeast Pacific, outside of the official basin boundary of 120¬∞W, which marks the eastern edge of RSMC Nadi's and RSMC Wellington's warning areas, during the satellite era. Due to the fact that this storm developed outside of the official areas of responsibility of the warning agencies in the South Pacific, the storm was not officially included as a part of the 2014‚Äì15 South Pacific cyclone season. However, the Chilean Navy Weather Service issued High Seas Warnings on the system as an extratropical low. Meteorological history On April 29, 2015, near the end of the 2014‚Äì15 South Pacific cyclone season, an extratropical disturbance developed in the far Southeastern Pacific, before transitioning into a subtropical depression soon afterward. The storm transitioned into a subtropical depression at 102.9¬∞W, well to the east of the South Pacific basin's eastern boundary of 120¬∞W. Around this time, the Chilean Navy Weather Service began including the storm in their High Seas Warnings, continuing this until May 4. During the next couple of days, the system drifted to the southwest, before turning to the southeast. On May 1, the storm intensified into a subtropical cyclone of tropical storm intensity, and looped westward. During this time, the system encountered water temperatures about 1 ¬∞C above average and low wind shear, due to an extremely strong El Ni√±o event, allowing the storm to organize further. On May 2, the storm reached its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds of ,All wind speeds in the article are maximum sustained winds sustained for one minute, unless otherwise noted. and a minimum low pressure of . Around this time, the storm was identified by researchers and unofficially named Katie. During the next day, Katie slowly tracked westward while gradually weakening. On May 4, Katie weakened into a subtropical depression and began accelerating to the northwest, passing to the east of Easter Island, before weakening further into a remnant low. With this degeneration, the Chilean Navy Weather Service ceased issuing warnings on the storm. On May 6, Katie's remnant low dissipated. During Katie's entire existence, the storm remained east of 120¬∞W, outside of the South Pacific basin's official boundary. Records Subtropical Cyclone Katie is unofficially the second-easternmost tropical or subtropical cyclone ever observed to form in the South Pacific Ocean, transitioning into a subtropical system near 102.9¬∞W. This broke the previous record of around 110¬∞W, set by a tropical depression in May 1983. \\"Katie\\" was also the first tropical or subtropical system to form east of the South Pacific basin's official eastern boundary of 120¬∞W since another tropical depression in May 1983. However, in May 2018, Katie's record was broken by Subtropical Cyclone Lexi, which formed just a few hundred miles off the coast of Chile, near 80¬∞W. Tropical cyclogenesis is extremely rare in the far southeastern Pacific Ocean, due to the cold sea-surface temperatures generated by the Humboldt Current, lack of tropical disturbance formation, and also due to unfavorable wind shear; as such, there are no records of a tropical cyclone impacting western South America. Tropical cyclone formation in this extreme part of the Southeast Pacific is so rare that no warning agencies have yet been assigned to the region east of 120¬∞W. Subtropical Cyclone Katie formed during an extremely strong El Ni√±o event; the abnormally-warm waters 1 ¬∞C above average and low wind shear across the region may have contributed to the system's rare formation. Although Katie's observed characteristics were consistent with that of a subtropical cyclone, detailed analysis revealed that the storm may have briefly transitioned into a tropical cyclone, around the time of its peak intensity.

It was the location of the Lindbergh kidnapping, after which it was turned into a rehabilitation center. The home was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. Construction The Lindberghs built Highfields in 1931 on a secluded spot of the Sourland Mountain so as to escape the spotlight brought on by their celebrity status. After his pioneering solo flight from New York to Paris in 1927, four million people had attended the ticker tape parade in Charles Lindbergh's honor, and he had received two million congratulatory telegrams, making him one of the most famous Americans of the century. The Sourland Mountain location, while secluded, afforded easy access by air and automobile to the Lindberghs' offices in New York City and to the laboratories of nearby Princeton University, to which they had been granted access. Lindbergh kidnapping The home was the site of one of the most notorious crimes of the 20th century, the Lindbergh kidnapping, often called the \\"Crime of the Century\\". On the evening of March 1, 1932, the Lindberghs' oldest son, 20-month-old Charles Lindbergh, Jr., was abducted by means of a ladder from a second floor window of Highfields, aided by a warped shutter which could not be closed. Over two months later, the baby's body was discovered a short distance from Highfields in Hopewell Township with a massive skull fracture. After a more than two-year investigations, Bruno Richard Hauptmann was arrested, tried in one of the so-called trials of the century, and convicted of the crime. He was executed by electric chair in the New Jersey State Prison on April 3, 1936. Nevertheless, speculation has continued to run rampant, as most investigators at the time of the initial investigation, as well as contemporary researchers, believe there was inside help. Rehabilitation center The headquarters of the search for Charles Lindbergh, Jr. was in the garage of Highfields. After Lindbergh identified the body of his son they left the house never to spend another night there, returning to Anne's family home in Englewood, New Jersey. The attention from the trial led the Lindberghs to a self-imposed exile in Europe from 1935 to 1939. In June 1933, Anne wrote that the house would be turned over to a board of trustees, and she named it \\"Highfields,\\" saying the name carried some secret meaning. One biographer has speculated that it commemorates the young Lindbergh's special greeting to his father. In 1941 the home was conveyed to the State of New Jersey by the Highfields Association, in memory of Charles Lindbergh. It has been used since July 1, 1952 as a juvenile rehabilitation center by the New Jersey Department of Corrections.

(accessed 5 March 2020) History In the 1920s and 1930s, few universities in the American South employed geographers. While there was evidence of interest in geography both in and outside the University of Kentucky, educators deplored the meager offerings and the ineffective teaching of geography in the state's secondary schools. Indeed, there were preparatory courses in geography in the course catalog of the University of Kentucky at the founding of the institution; the earliest course on record being Ancient and Modern Geography in 1865.University of Kentucky Course Catalogues, 1865 (accessed 5 August 2015) Educators were pleading for more effective geographic instruction and the business world was demanding a content of more practical value. Among the prominent American geographers, Ellen Churchill Semple, a native of Louisville, Kentucky, informally encouraged Frank L. McVey, President of the University of Kentucky, to establish a geography program, when in 1920 she donated to the university the Cullum Geographical Medal (awarded to her in 1914 by the American Geographical Society). The need for a separate geography program was clearly demonstrated during the next two decades, but it was the decision of the recently appointed president, Herman Lee Donovan, to recommend the establishment of a Geography Department within the College of Arts and Sciences early in the summer of 1944. UK Geography would begin active work at the opening of the fall semester in September 1944.The Louisville Courier-Journal (July 22, 1944) Since 1923, well before the establishment of the department, courses titled Physiography, Elements of Geography, Economic Geography, Conservation of Natural Resources, Land Problems, Geography of North America, and Geographic Basis of American History had been offered in departments of Geology, Economics, History, and Agriculture. These geography courses were transferred to the new department and additional course offerings in geography were approved for undergraduate and master's degree programs. Joseph R. Schwendeman, who earned a PhD from Clark University in 1941, was appointed head of the new department.University of Kentucky Archives, King Library-North, The Lexington Leader (September 24, 1944) With J. R. Schwendeman as head, and three assistant professors, Harry K. Hutter and Guy N. Parmenter (also from Clark) and Thomas P. Field (from UNC- Chapel Hill) and an associate professor, Richard L. Tuthill (Columbia University), the new department had five full-time faculty and an enrollment of 354 students from 1944 to 1945. In 1952, James Shear (Clark) and Daniel Jacobson (LSU) joined the department to teach climatology and cultural geography. The department, along with anthropology and sociology, established an interdisciplinary general education course for first year students attending the university after World War II entitled Societies Around the World. This two-semester program was taught by members of the three departments for most of the next two decades. Three societies were studied each semester. The first course examined the Eskimo, the Navajo, and Buganda in East Africa; the second analyzed three other areas: China, the Cotton South (in the U.S.), and the British Midlands. Thousands of students were enrolled in these courses to satisfy lower level requirements. It was a bold academic enterprise in multidisciplinary and cross-disciplinary studies led by the geography department. With the support of the Sears Roebuck Foundation, the department also maintained a summer field studies program at this time in Monterrey, Mexico. In the mid-1960s the department added new faculty to replace those who accepted positions elsewhere. William Withington (Northwestern University) joined to teach economic geography and North America; P. P. Karan (Indiana University) to teach Asia and physical geography; and Forrest McElhoe (Ohio State University) to teach regional and human geography. Faculty members were also involved in various international activities. James Shear spent 1957 to 1959 in Antarctica as part of the International Geophysical Year program; P.P. Karan spent 1957 to 1958 in Nepal as an assistant on the United Nations team that developed the first Five Year Plan for the country, and in 1964 to 1966 as leader of the Geographical Expedition to Bhutan Himalaya project supported by the National Geographic Society. Between 1950 and 1960 the department averaged about 70 majors each year. There were twenty-one master's degrees awarded and 2,841 students were enrolled in geography courses from 1966 to 1967. Three of these earned a PhD in geography: Paul Cooper at University of Georgia; Sanford Bederman at University of Minnesota, and Richard Silvernail at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The first MA was granted in 1948 to Wilton Tucker, who taught at a college in Lake Worth, FL. The department's influence was strongest on education throughout Kentucky and in neighboring states. Kentucky MA degree students were employed at Eastern Kentucky University, East Tennessee State University, Marshall University, Morehead State University, Appalachian State University, Minnesota, Southeastern Louisiana, Austin Peay, Western Carolina University, and as high school teachers, climatologists, and city planners in various places throughout the South. In 1967, Schwendeman received the Meritorious Achievement award from the American Association of Geographers, the AAG's highest honor. That summer, he retired after serving as head of department for twenty-three years. There have been nine chairs of the department since Schwendeman's term as Head (a designation no longer used at the university), # Joseph R. Schwendeman, 1944‚Äì67 (Head) # P.P. Karan 1967‚Äì75 # Karl Raitz, 1975‚Äì80, 1991 (interim), 1996‚Äì2008 # Stan Brunn, 1980‚Äì88 # Richard Ulack, 1988‚Äì96 # Susan Roberts 2008‚Äì12 # Anna Secor, 2012‚Äì13 (interim) # Richard Schein, 2013‚Äì2017 # Patricia Ehrkamp, 2017-present # Matthew Zook, 2019-20 (interim) The first doctorates were awarded in 1972 to Thomas P. Grimes and Robert Daniel Joseph. The first PhDs awarded to women were Janice Averitt (1975), Helen Parson (1976), who taught at Wilfrid Laurier University, Macel Marteva Wheeler (1977), who taught at Northern Kentucky University, and Wilma Walker (1977) who taught at Eastern Kentucky University. Graduate program P.P. Karan led the department in the creation of the graduate program in 1968. Following a national search, Karan was named as chair in 1967. In 1967, the old Social Sciences Building which housed the department (on the site of the present Fine Arts Library) was gutted by fire. The department moved to temporary quarters in Breckinridge Hall for two years (1967 to 1969). In the fall of 1969, the department moved to the fourteenth floor of Patterson Office Tower. A doctoral program was established in 1968 and the faculty size increased from four (Field, Karan, Withington, and McElhoe), to twelve by the mid 1970s: Dietrich Zimmer (Heidelberg), Donald Blome (Iowa), Paul Cooper (Georgia), Melvin Albaum (Ohio State), Gary Fowler (Syracuse), Roger McCoy (Kansas), Philip Phillips (Minnesota), Geoffrey Wall (Hull), Karl Raitz (Minnesota), Richard Jones (Ohio State), Ronald Garst (Michigan State), Richard Ulack (Penn State). Wilford Bladen (Kentucky) joined the department in 1973 to strengthen the program on Kentucky geography. In subsequent years, some of the departing faculty were replaced by new appointments, including Richard Towber (Washington) and Allan Fitzsimmons (UCLA). In 1975 Karl Raitz was named chair. Student enrollment in the program approached 2500 students each semester in the 1970s. Between 1967 and 1980, the department awarded 53 MA and 23 PhD degrees. Graduates of the department were employed at universities in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Kansas, Ohio, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Canada in addition to colleges and universities in Kentucky. Others held positions in state and city planning boards, in the U.S. government, and in civil service programs. Departmental interest in overseas areas grew rapidly during this period. The faculty conducted research in the Philippines, Indonesia, Sumatra, Western Australia, and the Himalaya and Japan with support from various funding agencies. This period also marked increased interest in the department's immediate surroundings with the publication of the first comprehensive Atlas of Kentucky (1976), an effort that involved the entire faculty. To improve its standing on campus and in the state, the department received permission to hire two mid-level faculty members with established research records. In 1977 the department hired Tom Leinbach (Penn State) and Gary Shannon (Michigan) who moved to Lexington, from the University of Vermont and the University of Florida respectively. At the same time, several recent PhDs were added to the program; they included Robert Cromley (Ohio State), Justin Friberg (Syracuse), Hank Bullamore (Iowa), and Jim Hufferd (Minnesota). The department was authorized to conduct a national search for a new chair, and Stan Brunn (Ohio State) was appointed chair, moving from Michigan State University in 1980. During the next several years, the department experienced growth in a number of areas, including bringing in new faculty members. Some came on tenure lines, others as temporary, especially during tight budget times, and still others replacing those who moved elsewhere. The temporary faculty played important roles in the department's instruction, research and service missions. They included Percy Dougherty (Boston), George Hepner (Arizona State), Susan Macey (Illinois), Susan Trussler-Black (Penn State), and Jacqueline Pryce-Harvey (Tennessee). Lizbeth Pyle (Minnesota) was the first woman employed on a tenure stream line; she joined the department in 1983. Carl Amrhein (SUNY Buffalo) was in the department for two years in the mid-1980s. John Paul Jones III (Ohio State), Graham Rowles (Clark), and John Watkins (Colorado) also came in the mid-1980s to bolster the department's strengths in human geography. A number of faculty, including Ulack, Watkins, Raitz, and Brunn, worked with faculty in the College of Education; they offered summer classes for teachers and worked with other professional geographers in the state, with teachers in the Kentucky Geographic Alliance (associated with the National Geographic Society) and with staff in the state's Department of Education. Brunn and Raitz also served as State Geographer. Rowles, Ulack, Watkins, Raitz, and Brunn at the same time worked with the director and others in the Appalachian Studies Center on various research projects and outreach programs. Other faculty established linkages with units on campus, including the Patterson School (Bladen, Karan, Brunn), Behavioral Sciences (Shannon), Center on Aging (Rowles and Watkins), Economics (Leinbach), Anthropology (Raitz), and the College of Communications (Brunn). A number of faculty cooperated with colleagues throughout the university on a variety of programs to internationalize the university; these included Leinbach, Ulack, Karan, Withington, and Brunn. Discipline-wise the department increased its visibility with Stan Brunn editing The Professional Geographer and later the Annals of the AAG, and with Tom Leinbach's appointment as NSF Program Director for Geography and Regional Science and his editing of Growth and Change. Several faculty became active in SEDAAG, especially Brunn and Raitz, who served as president (1991‚Äì93). A summer field station in Kyushu, Japan was established to train students for field research in Japan and the international field experiences of the department were expanded in the late 1990s to include Oaxaca, Mexico. 1980s and 1990s: geography and social theory Richard Ulack's appointment as chair of the department in 1988 energized the department's upward trajectory in the college, on campus, and in the discipline. It was during his tenure that the department began to develop one of its current major strengths: a center for critical social theory. The department played a central role in initiating and advancing this program during the late 1980s and early 1990s on campus and in by in the discipline. John Paul Jones, Ted Schatzki from Philosophy, and Wolfgang Natter (Johns Hopkins) in Germanic Studies established the innovative multidisciplinary Committee on Social Theory in 1989. This program grew with contributions from additional faculty members in the department, including John Pickles (Penn State), Susan Roberts (Syracuse) and Richard Schein (Syracuse), the later two who joined the department in 1991 and 1993 respectively. Under the auspices of the Committee on Social Theory, geographers worked closely with colleagues in Philosophy, English, History, Sociology, and Political Science. Committee founder Wolfgang Natter later joined the department in 1998 (leaving the department in 2005 for Virginia Tech) and Ted Schatzki took up a joint appointment (Philosophy and Geography). During this time, the department's international visibility remained strong with John Paul Jones serving as editor of the Annals of the AAG (1997‚Äì2000), Jones and Roberts organizing a 1995 workshop on New Horizons in Feminist Geography, a number of faculty being active on AAG committees and in AAG specialty groups, and actively participating in numerous national and international conferences. The department's annual research productivity, including books, chapters, and presentations, etc. was instrumental in attracting strong applicants for entrance into the graduate program from the 1980s through the present. Students were active in contributing papers at SEDAAG and AAG meetings, working with faculty on research grants, and publishing articles with faculty or on their own. The department's commitment to human geography was strengthened through participation in the women's studies program (now the Department of Gender & Women's Studies). Heidi Nast's (McGill) addition as a visiting assistant professor in 1994 was instrumental in the department's development of coursework and seminars on geography and gender. Haripriya Rangan (UCLA) took up a visiting assistant professor position in the department in 1995 and taught courses on resource use, non- Western environmental movements, and regional development. A further commitment to working with colleagues in women's studies was made with the faculty supporting the transfer of Paola Bachetta (Sorbonne) from the UK Department of Sociology in 1999 and the hiring of Anna Secor (Colorado) in 2000, when Bachetta left the department to accept a position at Berkeley. When John Pickles departed to take up an endowed chair at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and John Paul Jones III became Dean of the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences at the University of Arizona in 2003, the chair, Karl Raitz, convinced the administration to authorize a mid-rank faculty hire. The department offered this position to Tad Mutersbaugh who moved from the University of Iowa in 2003, deepening the department's strengths in political ecology. The department also hired Matthew Zook (Berkeley) in 2001 and Michael Crutcher (LSU) in 2003 (he left the department in 2011), with strengths in economic and internet geographies and cultural and historical geography, respectively. The intellectual life of the department during the 1990s and early 2000s was also enriched by a number of postdoctoral fellows and visiting scholars, including: Miguel de Oliver (Penn State), Heidi Nast (McGill), Amy Mills (UT-Austin), Alan Hudson (Cambridge), Ian Hay (Adelaide), Kristine Miranne (Wayne State), Caroline Nagel (Colorado), Tara Maddock (Ohio State), Perry Carter (Ohio State), Shantha Hennayake (Peradeniya), Nalini Hennayake (Peradeniya), Michael Crutcher (LSU), and Kathleen O'Reilly (Iowa). This period also saw the formation of a productive faculty exchange program with the School of Geography at the University of Nottingham that ran from 2003 to 2007. The department grew from strength to strength when in 2006, two assistant professor lines and two associate professor lines were authorized. Michael Samers (Oxford) and Andrew Wood (Ohio State University) were appointed as associate professors from the University of Nottingham and University of Oklahoma, respectively, to extend course offerings in economic and urban geography. Patricia Ehrkamp (Minnesota) and Morgan Robertson (UW-Madison) joined as assistant professors from Miami University and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, respectively. Ehrkamp, with strengths in feminist and political geographies, and Robertson, as a political ecologist, orchestrated the return of the Mini-Conference on Critical Geography to the UK the following fall in 2007. Marshall Wilkinson (Macquarie) also joined as visiting faculty in physical geography and geomorphology in 2006 and promoted to tenure-track in 2007 (he left the department in 2010). Jeff Levy (BA Kentucky) was also hired as department GIS analyst in 2006, joining Gilbreath in the cartography lab. Dick Ulack retired from the department in 2007 (he died in April 2011). 2000: strengthening physical geography During the late 1990s, Linda Roth (Clark) offered courses in physical geography and biogeography a few years before her untimely death. The faculty for years, including in five-year plans, agreed that it was important to develop on such concentrations, following university commitment in 1989, not only to provide balanced course instruction for the undergraduate students, but also to appeal to existing and potential graduate students interested in human/environmental interfaces. The department's standing as a state-recognized Research Challenge Trust Fund department in the 1990s, one of only ten such programs on campus, enabled the department to hire a full professor to develop the physical geography program. Jonathan Phillips moved to the department in 2000 from Texas A&M.; He was given a broad set of responsibilities that included oversight in hiring new physical geography faculty, building a physical geography component to the graduate program, offering additional physical geography classes, setting up a physical geography lab, and working with other university faculty in the earth sciences and environmental studies. The department hired Alice Turkington (Queens- Belfast) in 2001 and Sean Campbell (Arkansas) in 2002 to strengthen the physical cluster (Campbell left in 2006). Rosemary Sherriff (Colorado) joined faculty in 2008 to offer courses in landscape ecology (she left the department in 2010). Daehyun Kim (Texas A&M;) was appointed in 2009 to extend offerings in biogeography and spatial analysis. In 2011, the physical geography faculty expanded with the hiring of Tony Stallins (Georgia) from Florida State and Liang Liang (UW-Milwaukee), with interests in human-organism geographies and phenology, respectively. Late 2000s: political ecology Susan Roberts was named chair of the department in 2008. Tom Leinbach retired in May 2009 (he died in December 2009). Morgan Robertson's appointment augmented Mutersbaugh's work and catalyzed political ecology within the department. In the Spring of 2011, the graduate students hosted the first Dimensions of Political Ecology (DOPE) conference, which has since grown to become an internationally recognized event. Robertson returned to UW-Madison in Spring of 2013. Trushna Parekh (UT-Austin) served as a postdoctoral fellow, 2008 to 2011, and Sandra Zupan (UW-Milwaukee) was lecturer, 2010 to 2013. Following Roberts's term, Anna Secor served as interim chair, 2012 to 2013. Around this time, a number of faculty won Fulbright awards. Schein was the Bicentennial Chair in North American Studies at the University of Helsinki, Finland, 2012 to 2013. Fulbright Fellowships were also won by Roberts (University of Turku, Finland, 2012 to 2013), Samers (Universit√© de Lille II, France, 2013 to 2014), and Zook (University of Tartu, Estonia, 2013 to 2014). In addition, Matthew W. Wilson (hired in 2011) was a visiting assistant professor at Harvard University. In 2013, Lynn Phillips moved to the tenure track, following several years of service as a lecturer in the department, after receiving a PhD in city planning at the University of Louisville. Secor received recognition in 2015 when the university named her named the Hajja Razia Sharif Sheikh Islamic Studies Professor. Rich Schein was appointed the eighth chair of the department in 2013. Betsy Beymer-Farris (Illinois) joined the faculty from Furman University in 2014 to further expand offerings in political ecology, with research concentrations in Africa. Raitz retired in 2014 and Brunn retired in 2015. Carolyn Finney (Clark) joined the faculty from Berkeley in 2015, with research interests in the cultural geographies of the environment. Early 2010s: critical mapping Miller Hall In the early 1970s, Gyula (Julius) Pauer (Kentucky) was appointed director of the department's cartography laboratory. In addition to teaching introductory and advanced cartography courses, he operated the laboratory, initially in a small room in Patterson Office Tower before it moved to the nearby and renovated Miller Hall basement in 1987. When Michael Kennedy joined the department from the College of Architecture in 1991, he began the department's GIS program with only a single computer. The hiring of Francis Harvey (Washington) in 1998 strengthened the department's GIS and social theory offerings. This concretized interests of the faculty in the GIS & Society debates of the 1990s. Edited by Pickles, Ground Truth was published in 1995 with contributions from Roberts, Schein, Jon Goss (Kentucky), and Pat McHaffie (Kentucky) -- this text quickly catalyzed the development of critical GIS. When Julius Pauer retired in 1997, the department received permission to hire a permanent staff line a director of the Cartographic Laboratory: Richard (Dick) Gilbreath (MA Kentucky). In 1998, Ulack, Raitz, and Pauer also edited a second Atlas of Kentucky. Michael Kennedy's phased retirement created an opportunity to grow the GIS and cartography faculty. Drawing on the GIS & Society tradition begun by Pickles and Harvey (who left for Minnesota in 2001), the department appointed two new faculty in 2011: Jeremy Crampton (Penn State) from Georgia State and Matthew W. Wilson (Washington) from Ball State. Crampton, Wilson, and Zook founded the New Mappings Collaboratory in Fall of 2011, joining another UK-centered research activity on internet geographies, led by Zook since 2009: Floating Sheep. With support to establish online certificate and degree programs in digital mapping, the department hired Rich Donohue (Wisconsin) as a postdoctoral researcher in 2014. Donohue, along with Zook, Wilson, and Crampton, developed New Maps Plus, expanding cartography and GIS coursework in web-based interactive cartography, geovisualization, and map design. New Maps Plus offers an entirely online graduate certificate in digital mapping and an online Master of Science in Digital Mapping. The first students to earn this MS degree graduated in 2019. Late 2010s: expanding the faculty The late-2010s included a number of changes in the faculty, including the death of P.P Karan in 2018 after over 60 years of serving the department and university. In 2016, after serving a year as Associate Dean of International Affairs, Sue Roberts was appointed Associate Provost for Internationalization. Upon promotion to Associate Dean of Faculty in 2017, Rich Schein stepped down as chair. Patricia Ehrkamp was appointed chair, only the ninth chair of the department in nearly 75 years. After several years as an affiliated member of the department, Ted Schatzki (Berkeley) joined the department, having previously served as Associate Dean of Faculty and Professor of Philosophy at Kentucky. Daehyun Kim left the department in 2017, returning to Seoul National University and Jeremy Crampton left the department in 2018 to join the faculty at Newcastle University. Carolyn Finney also left the faculty in 2018. In 2018, the department welcomed four new assistant professors. Jack Gieseking (CUNY) and Nick Lally (Wisconsin) expanded the offerings in digital geographies. Nari Senanayake's (Penn State) research and teaching in health geographies and Priscilla McCutcheon's (Georgia) work in food justice represent new offerings for the department. Boyd Shearer was also made a permanent lecturer. In 2019, Anna Secor joined the faculty at Durham University, while Rich Donohue was appointed as assistant professor. As part of an effort to support the African American and African Studies program, Lydia Pelot-Hobbs (CUNY) was hired in 2019, but deferred for a year to complete post-doctoral research at NYU. Early 2020s: COVID-19 The arrival of COVID-19 in Kentucky led to the first video conference meeting for the entire department (with over 30 participants) on 25 March 2020. On May 6, 2020, the department conducted a virtual graduation ceremony/Semple Day (renamed Geography in the Bluegrass Day) to recognize the accomplishments of graduating students. After over 40 years of service to the department, Gary Shannon retired in June of 2020. The interdisciplinary major of environmental studies moved under the department's administration, led by efforts of Betsy Beymer-Farris. This followed a revision of the undergraduate major in the summer of 2020, including the offering of a new minor in urban studies. A new online graduate program in applied environmental studies was also launched, with support from a postdoctoral hire: Kathryn Gillespie (Washington).

It was Thorry's directorial debut, though he had gone to Venezuela to act, and was commercially successful. The film has been analyzed as part of Venezuelan film history, in particular by Central University of Venezuela academic Mar√≠a Gabriela Colmenares. Plot Lindolfo Chaves is the president of a Havana- based tobacco company, but also president of a group dedicated to virtue and morals. In reality, he is an incorrigible libertine until, after a wild night out, his doctor diagnoses him with a heart murmur and advises him to rest somewhere peaceful. Lindolfo goes to his nephew's, lawyer Ruperto Chaves, house in Caracas. However, Ruperto is not prepared for Lindolfo's arrival: as well as having serious economic problems, his recently released wife Ana Mar√≠a has decided to leave him after a heated argument concerning Lindolfo's apparent moralistic and demure character. Ruperto looks for her, promptly finding Silvia, their dressmaker. Desperate, Ruperto proposes that she temporarily pretend to be his wife. Silvia accepts the offer and, with the help of Ruperto's butler S√≥crates, the three characters play out the farce in front of Uncle Lindolfo. He believes the ruse and ends up naming his nephew president of a new branch of his tobacco company that is being set up in Venezuela. Ana Mar√≠a then returns home to apologize, but then threatens her husband to reveal everything to Lindolfo when they tell her of the act. At the same time, Vuitremundo, an aspirational singer and Silvia's fianc√©, has been looking for her for several hours, coming to fight Ruperto because he thinks he has kidnapped her. Cast * Olga Zubarry as Ana Mar√≠a * Francisco √Ålvarez as Lindolfo Chaves * H√©ctor Monteverde as Vuitremundo * Amador Benday√°n as S√≥crates * Luis Salazar as Ruperto Chaves * Elena Fern√°n as Silvia * Leon Bravo * Esther Monasterio * Pura Vargas * Amparo Riera Carmen Porras * Martha Olivo Production A frame from a scene in the film, preserved in Venezuelan archives The director of That's the Woman I Want, Juan Carlos Thorry, was one of a group of filmmakers brought to Venezuela from Argentina and Mexico by film company Bol√≠var Films, which had seen some success producing shorts and newsreels. Bol√≠var Films intended to invigorate the national film production with features in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The Argentine Thorry had starred in his compatriot Carlos Hugo Christensen's Venezuela-produced film El demonio es un √°ngel, which was released the same year (1950) as That's the Woman I Want, which also stars an Argentine actor in the main role. The film was the first to be directed by Thorry. In about 1995, Thorry recalled how the film came to be. Having been in the group summoned to Venezuela, he had only intended to act, however, after El demonio es un √°ngel and while director Christensen began filming The Yacht Isabel Arrived This Afternoon, Thorry found himself with three months to spare. Having been an assistant director on some productions in Argentina, he was encouraged by producers to use the time as an opportunity to create his own feature film in Venezuela. He received the approval of the production company, and had Juan Corona's story in mind when he briefly returned to Buenos Aires to hire Olga Zubarry and Francisco √Ålvarez. He then passed the story to the Venezuelan poet and comic Aquiles Nazoa to adapt as a screenplay, and hired Venezuelan actors for the other roles and used the same crew from El demonio es un √°ngel. This movement of Argentine stars for the film was reported on by Variety in early 1950, in regards to the national Argentine film production unit expanding to the United States ‚Äì Variety contrasted the news with the fact that \\"from time to time more Argentine talent clippers off to Venezuela for work [at] Bol√≠var Films\\" with the \\"latest departures [of] Olga Zubarry and comedian Francisco √Ålvarez\\"; it refers to the film with the direct English translation I Want a Wife Like That. Some of the film was shot in La Guaira, specifically scenes of Lindolfo arriving at the airport and Ruperto driving him up the mountains to enter the city of Caracas. It features music by Billo's Caracas Boys and composer Eduardo Serrano. Marketing and release Mar√≠a Gabriela Colmenares of Central University of Venezuela looks at the marketing and release of the film as part of its paratext and of Bol√≠var Films' commercial strategy. She writes that the published materials prior to the film's release follow a pattern similar to the studio system and star system of Hollywood. In terms of the film, the marketing had \\"explicit genre labels, [...] elements such as the production company and the participation of national artists and international stars\\" as well as slogans. Some of these slogans explicitly promoted the Venezuelan composer Eduardo Serrano, while others took on the style of a notice to advertise the leisure opportunity of cinema, one reading: \\"Forget the war and the earthquakes and foot-and-mouth disease watching the comic hit of the year! [...] 99 minutes of unbroken laughter!\\" Some of the promotions of the film before its release also include newspaper interviews, which lean more into the 'star' aspect by introducing Argentine actor Francisco √Ålvarez as \\"the popular comedian\\". This form of marketing also highlighted the \\"accentuated local flavor\\" of the film's Venezuelan setting as an attraction of it. In terms of distribution, she writes that Bol√≠var Films had a good handle on the commercialization of its films, but was weaker in the market as it did not have a distribution-exhibition branch of its own. Unlike other Venezuelan attempts at production houses, Bol√≠var Films was not afraid to market to outside of its country as well as the local market. Regarding the press release issued by Bol√≠var Films on the day of the premiere, Colmenares explains that it \\"[highlighted] its industrial creation, production values and the seal of the production company, [referred] to musical attractions, [...] the comic situations of the plot and the comic feats of some of its actors\\", writing both of the fame of its international stars and the successful debuts of the Venezuelans. The film was successful, staying in Caracas cinemas for two weeks. This would have been very lucrative, but the typical arrangement of the time was for the production to only receive a quarter of the profits.  Analysis  Colmenares writes that \\"the analysis of That's the Woman I Want [...] shows great pitfalls derived from the unavailability of studies on comedy as a genre\\", but that comedy was important within production at the time nevertheless. Colmenares then examines the genre of the film, writing that the plot is driven by a hypocrisy and moral double standard in some of its characters and by the humorous use of a more-stable facade by others, explaining that \\"ambiguity, deception and impersonation articulate the whole story\\" until the plots are resolved and truth uncovered. She concludes that the film, therefore, demonstrates the \\"beliefs and values of the petty bourgeoisie\\". In terms of storytelling, Colmenares notes the use of dramatic irony and juxtaposition, saying that: Colmenares compliments the use of this system, but notes that the film feels \\"disharmonious\\" because of a disparity between the styles of the Venezuelan and Argentine actors in it. In his thesis, Jes√∫s Ricardo Azuaga Garc√≠a adds to Colmenares' analysis by writing that \\"the truth is that this comedy tries to respond [...] to a mode of representation institutionalized by Hollywood and followed by the Argentine industry\\", aligning the format whereby viewers know even the characters' most hidden secrets and those between the lines to a United States ideal. Azuaga Garc√≠a also notes that That's the Woman I Want, along with The Yacht Isabel Arrived This Afternoon, are \\"the most representative, due to the reception they received from public and critics,\\" of Venezuelan popular film in the early development period, but it is harder to tell how it relates to the typical Argentine films of the time. However, he still says that in certain canons it is classed in the generic style of Argentine comedy. In 2009, Colmenares observed the credits of the film, writing that the style of them \\"authorized the reading of [the film] in comic terms\\" by the use of \\"drawings and animated cartoons that represent the characters of the plot\\" and \\"music that [...] is cheerful and goes from tropical to playful\\" among other light sounds.

He died of a heart attack at the age of 27, while working in Florence. Sue Chowles, who had a work placement with Flett before working in fashion and later as a fashion academic, has said: \\"He would have been more influential than Galliano now...he was the most inspirational pattern cutter, a true genius\\". The Independent included John Flett at number 17 in an article about 50 great British fashion moments, saying: \\"Flett's last collection in London was exquisite, watery, shimmery and full of ideas\\". Early life John Flett was from a Jewish background, according to his friend and former \\"soulmate\\" John Galliano ‚Äì who has described Flett as: \\"the love of his life\\". After studying fashion and textiles at West Sussex College of Design. He then moved on to Central Saint Martins (then St Martins), where he studied fashion under Sheilagh Brown. Brown would later say: \\"When John Flett came for his interview his work was incredible, one of the tutors said not to give him a place as he looked like trouble. I replied 'that kind of trouble I love'.\\" At Central Saint Martins, Flett was part of a hothouse of talent ‚Äì both in fashion and the London scene; his early 1980s peer group included not only Galliano, but also Stephen Jones, Darla Jane Gilroy, Sade and Chris Sullivan. Flett's work attracted attention and his graduation collection was bought by key names, including Joseph Ettedgui (head of the London-based Joseph retail empire) and by buyers for Bloomingdales in New York. Career From 1985, Flett became a part of the London high-fashion scene, exhibiting at London Fashion Week and at New York and Paris fashion weeks. Menswear was introduced to his range in 1986 and in 1987 he added a diffusion (lower-priced) line. By 1988, John Flett designs were available worldwide in 70 stores. Brand hallmarks The Guardian described Flett's brand signature as distinctively different for the times: \\"Along with John Galliano, who was a [sic] schoolfriend, he pioneered a new type of bias- cutting technique which imbued garments with a special fluidity and grace\\". Kevin Almond has said: \\"much of Flett's skill was in his cutting, intricate and inventive, with which he developed clothes that seemed to cling to the body. In fact, many of his garments were difficult to understand on the hanger and needed to be worn to be appreciated\\". Sue Chowles, who worked with him on his spring/summer 1989 collection as an intern while studying at the Royal College of Art, has described his technique in more detail: \\"he never pattern cut his designs ‚Äì instead he would drape the fabric and create the pattern on a mannequin\\". Not all his early catwalk collections attracted acclaim. Writing in The Times about his first show in spring 1988, Liz Smith said that he: \\"has to learn to polish his act\\". But there was no doubt about his appeal to most of the British press and fashion buyers. An interview and double-page spread of photos of his collection in The Observer described his autumn 1988 catwalk show as: \\"triumphant\\". The interviewer said Flett's trademarks were about intricacy, involving clever draping on items such as a backless dress with no visible means of support. She described his finale outfit as: \\"a wondrous white creation that looked like a cross between a meringue and a crinkle-cut crisp\\". Later career and death Despite the acclaim from both buyers and majority of the British fashion press, Flett was unable to sustain his business venture. His business affairs were described as a \\"rocky road\\" and he parted company with his backers in 1988/9. He moved on to Paris to work for Claude Montana on the designer's debut collection for Lanvin. Flett relocated to Florence in 1990, where he worked for Italian designer Enrico Coveri on a menswear range (Coveri died in 1990). Flett's obituaries in both The Times and The Guardian noted that at the time of his death, aged 27, he was on the point of signing a contract with the Milan fashion house Zuccoli to create a womenswear collection and relaunch his career.

Originally interested in teaching, she eventually gained interest in psychology, for which she went on to obtain her Ph.D. in from the University of Iowa in 1926. Within two years, Bayley had accepted a position at the Institute for Child Welfare (now called the Institute for Human Development) at the University of California, Berkeley. There she began the longitudinal Berkeley Growth Study, which worked to create a guide of physical and behavioral growth across development. Bayley also examined the development of cognitive and motor functions in children, leading to her belief that intelligence evolves over the course of child development. In 1954, Bayley began working on the National Collaborative Perinatal Project (NCPP) with the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), where she applied her work to infants. After retiring in 1968, Bayley synthesized her work and published the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, which is still in use today. For her efforts in the field of psychology, Bayley became the first woman to receive the Distinguished Scientific Contribution award from the American Psychological Association (APA), of which she was a fellow, amongst other honorary awards. Bayley was also a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. She died at the age of 95 from a respiratory illness.  Biography   Early life and education  Bayley was born on September 28, 1899, in Dalles, Oregon. She was the fourth of five children born to Prudence Cooper Bayley and Fredrick W. Bayley. She came from a family of pioneers. Until the age of 8, Bayley was a sickly child and could not attend school. Yet, even with her delayed enrollment at public school, she quickly caught up. Later, she enrolled in the University of Washington to become an English teacher, but after taking an introductory psychology course she changed her path. In 1922, she completed her Bachelor of Science in psychology, which was followed by a Master of Science in the same field in 1924. During her years at the University of Washington, she got the opportunity to work as a laboratory assistant in the Gatzert Foundation for Child Welfare. Bayley earned her doctoral degree at the University of Iowa in 1926.  Career and marriage  Bayley started her career in 1926 at the University of Wyoming, where she was an instructor until 1928. There she published her first of almost 200 papers. In 1928, Bayley moved to the University of California, Berkeley, to work in the Institute of Child Welfare. It was here that Bayley began work on the Berkeley Growth Study. On April 7, 1929, she married her husband, John, R. Reid. He was at the University of California, Berkeley completing his own doctoral work in philosophy. In 1954, she went to the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Maryland, where she worked on child development in the Laboratory of Psychology. In 1964, Bayley returned to Berkeley and published the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. She retired in 1968 but continued to revise the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. Bayley and her husband lived the remainder of their lives in Carmel, California. She died at the age of 95 from respiratory illness.  Berkeley Growth Study  In 1928, Bayley began work at the Institute for Child Welfare at the University of California, Berkeley, on what is referred to as the Berkeley Growth Study. The study aimed to study human development from infancy to adulthood on a range of physical, psychological, and physiological characteristics. Bayley became the director of the program in 1931. Through her efforts, Bayley was able to publish the California First-Year Mental Scale in 1933 and the California Infant Scale of Motor Development in 1936, precursors to her later Bayley Scales of Infant Development.  Sample demographics  The Berkeley Growth Study had 61 participating children born between September 25, 1928, and May 15, 1929. The children were white, raised in English-speaking homes within the Berkeley area, and were of above average socioeconomic status. Measurements began four days after birth, at which time all children were considered to be of normal health. The sample decreased to 42 participating children by 1941, due primarily to family relocation.  Measurements  Bayley assessed the children on their physical, motor, mental, and physiological development. An analysis of trends in the data was then conducted, with particular reference to the age of developments, as well as a correlational investigation of relating factors. Assessments were conducted once a month from birth to 15 months, once every three months from 15‚Äì36 months, and every six months after 36 months. Initial measurements focused on reflexes and bodily measurements, such as blood pressure and breathing rates. Additionally, information was gathered regarding the maternal and prenatal history. Subsequent assessments were conducted at the Institute for Child Welfare, as well as at home visits, pediatric centers, and at play- based field group outings. Mental measurements included the California First- Year Mental Scale, the California Pre-school Mental Scale, vocabulary tests, and Stanford-Binet intelligence tests. Motor assessments examined speed, dexterity, and reflexes, amongst other things. Participants completed the California Infant Scale of Motor Development, as well as examinations of footprint records. Physiological tests assessed exercise and exertion abilities, the galvanic skin reflex, and metabolism. Additional assessments involved body dimensions, x-rays, and tests of emotion and personality.  Outcomes  Variations in intelligence across the lifespan led Bayley to conclude that intelligence is not fixed at birth, but instead impacted by encounters with environmental factors. Bayley thus argued that hindrances in development stemmed from social influences, such as poverty, rather than psychological influences. Other factors Bayley considered vitally important to development were parenting attitudes and behaviors. Examinations of x-rays and physiological growth led Bayley to become the first scientist to recognize the predictability of adult height based on infant size. Additionally, Bayley discovered no gender differences in terms of physical and psychological development. Measures of assessment were later published by Bayley, including the California First-Year Mental Scale and the California Infant Scale of Motor Development, which collectively lead to the development of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development.  Bayley Scales of Infant Development   Developing the scales  The original version of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development were published by Nancy Bayley in 1969, though they have since been revised to the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-II (BSID-II) and the currently used BSID-III. The original BSID was developed by combining three previous scales: the California First-Year Mental Scale, the California Preschool Mental Scale, and the California Infant Scale of Motor Development. The purpose of the BSID-III is to gain further information about a child's developmental milestones and abilities, as well as to intervene at an early age if a learning disability presents itself.  Measurements  The Mental and Motor Scales have remained relatively the same through all versions, with some changes made to the Behavior Rating Scale. These changes include: age range, norms altered to function more successfully with modernization, and greater validity and reliability. The Mental Scale presented in BSID-II assesses children using a normalized standardized scoring system ‚Äì the Mental Development Index (MDI) ‚Äì and a standard scoring system ‚Äì the Psychomotor Development Index (PDI). The MDI is used to measure mental capabilities in children, including sensory and perceptual acuities, object constancy, memory, learning, problem solving, early verbal communication, early abstract thinking ability, and early number concepts. The PDI is used to gauge control of the body, such as fine and gross motor skills. The Behavior Rating Scale presents a numerical assessment of a child's attention, arousal, orientation/engagement, emotional regulation, and motor ability. The BSID-III is most beneficial for studies regarding developmental, psychological, and neuropsychological information in children up to 42 months old; after 42 months of age the information becomes less reliable. The amount of time required to administer the test depends greatly on the age of the child. This variability occurs because each portion of the test has specific instructions on how to administer it to the child. For instance, in the motor tasks there are certain positions the child is to be placed in. When scoring the test, each task throughout both motor and cognitive is either given or not given credit based on how the child responds to the task that is presented. Notes are made along the way while administering the test if there are refusals made, items are omitted, or there is an issue with the caregiver report. In these cases, an examiner will go back and administer another exam to obtain data for that test. Selected works Bayley, N., & Jones, H. E. (1937).

Henry Lawrence Hitchcock (Oct. 31, 1813-July 6, 1873) was and American minister and the third President of Western Reserve College, now Case Western Reserve University. He was mayor of the village of Hudson, OH in 1861. Biography Hitchcock was born in Burton, Geauga County, Ohio, Oct. 31, 1813. His father, Hon. Peter Hitchcock, a native of Cheshire, Conn., was a member of the US Congress and Chief Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court. His mother was Nabby, daughter of Elam Cook, of Cheshire. He graduated from Yale College in 1832. On his graduation he returned home and for two years had charge of the Burton Academy, at which he had been prepared for college. He remained in town a year longer, engaged partly in teaching privately, and partly in studying theology. In the autumn of 1835 he entered Lane Theological Seminary, then under the care of Dr. Lyman Beecher, where he spent two years. In 1837 he was licensed to preach, in Burton, and during the same year was ordained pastor of the Congregational Church in Morgan, Ashtabula County, where he labored for two and a half years. In 1840 he was called to Columbus to take charge of the Second Presbyterian Church, then recently formed. Here he continued, and with remarkable success, until elected President of Western Reserve College, May 31, 1855. He found the college in a languishing condition, and by his untiring energy relieved it of debt and placed it on a firmer foundation. Besides his duties of President, he was the College Pastor, and instructed in the department of Natural Theology and the Evidences of Christianity. Hitchcock also served as mayor of the village of Hudson, OH in 1861. Under this burden of labor, his health declined, and he spent the winter of 1867 in Europe, remaining abroad until June. For three years longer he continued at the head of the college, and then insisted on retiring, retaining only the duties of pastor and professor. Notably, he brought on chemist Edward Morley as a professor. Hitchcock died at Hudson, after two weeks' illness, of typhoid fever, July 6, 1873, in the sixtieth year of his age. Hitchcock served as president of Western Reserve from 1855 to 1871, where he most notably pulled the institution out of debt. Hitchcock was also the Professor of Christian Theology from 1855 to 1873, teaching until his death in 1873 of typhoid. He received the degree of Doctor of Divinity from Williams College in 1855. President Hitchcock was married in Dec, 1837, to Miss Clarissa Maria Ford, daughter of Stephen Ford, of Burton, Ohio. He had eleven children, of whom five, with their mother, survived him. His daughter Sarah Melissa Hitchcock married Thomas Day Seymour. Two of their sons were graduates of Western Reserve College in 1859; the elder of whom was a clergyman, and the younger was killed at the battle of Stone River, in Tennessee, Dec. 31, 1862. Hitchcock married Clarissa Ford. Together they had eleven children; four of which were graduates of Western Reserve College.

He grew up in Bendigo and following his education worked for the State Electricity Commission of Victoria. After serving in the Royal Australian Air Force during World War II, he commenced work at the Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Board (MMTB) in 1953, being appointed the MMTB's fifth and last Chairman in 1976. Following the dissolving of the MMTB into the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) in 1983, he became General Manager of the MTA Bus and Tram Division. Snell worked for the MMTB, MTA, and Leighton on Hong Kong's Tuen Mun light rail system, and died in Hong Kong in 1988. Early life Frederick Dudley Snell was born in Eaglehawk, Victoria on 14 December 1924. He was educated at Eaglehawk State School and later attended the Bendigo School of Mines where he attained a Diploma of Electrical Engineering. In 1940 Snell commenced a cadetship with the State Electricity Commission of Victoria (SEC). During World War Two, he served with the Royal Australian Air Force, primarily in New Guinea. On 4 December 1948 he married Joan Buckie, with whom he had two daughters. Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Board In 1953 Snell left the SEC, and started working at the Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Board (MMTB) as an electrical engineer. He was later promoted to Methods Engineer, and was appointed Chief Engineer in 1969. In 1970 Snell became the MMTB's Deputy Chairman under Francis Kirby. He succeeded Kirby as Chairman in 1976 for a five-year term, which was renewed in 1981. Snell faced the same financial challenges as Kirby did as Chairman of the MMTB, but nonetheless managed some reforms. New ticketing systems, which arrested patronage declines by making public transport more cost effective, were implemented under his administration. Additional Z-class trams and new Volvo B59 and MAN buses were also ordered under Snell, and he also raised the introduction of trolley buses. Snell's era also saw the first tram extensions since 1956, made with an extension from East Burwood to Middleborough Road opening on 23 July 1978, and from East Preston to Boldrewood Parade opening on 19 May 1983. However, the little-used Holden Street line was abandoned under Snell. Despite these reforms, the MMTB remained in a poor financial situation, and the shift from purchasing to leasing buses later become a financial liability for the Cain Labor government. Snell was critical to the MMTB's successful involvement in the construction and operation of Hong Kong's Tuen Mun light rail systems. Metropolitan Transit Authority Public transport in Victoria was reorganised on 1 July 1983, with Melbourne's railway services and MMTB tram and bus services amalgamated into the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA), leaving Snell the MMTB's final chairman. Snell continued working with the Melbourne tramway system, as General Manager of the MTA's Bus and Tram Division, also managing the MTA's interests in the Tuen Mun light rail system. Tuen Mun light rail Comeng built Tuen Mun light rail vehicle 1070, named in honour of Snell. Snell retired from the MTA in 1985 and relocated to Hong Kong to work for Leighton Contractors, who were involved in consortium with the MTA, becoming project manager of the Tuen Mun light rail. The light rail opened in September 1988, with Snell commenting that opening day was \\"packed in true Hong Kong style\\". Snell died in Hong Kong on 14 December 1988. He was survived by his wife Joan and their two daughters. Organisational involvement Snell was on the Management Committee of the International Union of Public Transport (UIPT), the first Australian representative, and was founding member of the UIPT Light Rail Commission. In this capacity, he aided in the creation of Light Rail Transit standards, and was one of a group of three Members of the Commission who presented at the UITP 46th International Congress in Brussels in May 1985. Snell's work in advocating for light rail saw him elected as the Honorary Vice President of the Light Rail Transit Association of the UK. Along with his Diploma of Electrical Engineering, he was a graduate of the Australian Administrative Staff College, and held professional affiliations as a member of The Institution of Engineers Australia, and a fellow of The Chartered Institute of Transport. He served as vice-chairman of the general committee of the latter institute for eight years. He was also involved in Rotary International from 1978, being active in Melbourne Rotary and in the Welfare of the Young Committee.

QLF was formed in 1969 and active in the 1970s. They published Drag: A Magazine About the Transvestite, beginning in 1971. The Queens Liberation Front collaborated with a number of other LGBTQ+ activist groups, including the Gay Activists Alliance and the Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries.  Formation  Queens Liberation Front was founded as Queens by Lee Brewster in 1969. At his first ball in February 1969, Brewster announced plans to form the group, with October 31, 1969 (Halloween ‚Äì particularly popular holiday in the drag community) to be its formal founding date. The organization was founded in part to oppose the relegation of drag queens to the back of the March at the first Christopher Street Liberation Day in June of 1970. In protest, the street queens from STAR moved to the front and marched at the front of the parade, anyway.  Activities  Queens Liberation Front participated in many activities to advocate for the rights of LGBT people, particularly transvestites. The organization also participated in LGBT events such as the LGBT Pride March. Members sometimes wore drag while lobbying New York state legislators. The organization often collaborated with other local LGBT organizations, such as Gay Activists Alliance and Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries. In the early 1970s, the organizations successfully used litigation to overturn a New York City ordinance against cross-dressing. In 1973, Queens Liberation Front agreed to a compromise amendment to New York City's anti-discrimination ordinance that added sexual orientation to the ordinance, but clarified the ordinance did not cover cross-dressing. The organization's director, Bebe Scarpie, met with the bill's sponsor at City Hall and agreed to the compromise. The organization's lawyer, Richard Levidow, believed the exclusionary clause violated the United States Constitution and was therefore unenforceable. Lesbian Feminist Liberation opposed the performance by drag queens at the 1973 LGBT Pride March in New York City. As they passed out flyers, Sylvia Rivera, of Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries, took the microphone from emcee Vito Russo and spoke against this sentiment, delivering a speech about spending time in jail, and being harassed and beaten by the straight men who were preying on all the members of the gay community. Rivera ended by leading a chant for \\"Gay Power!\\"Rivera, Sylvia, \\"Queens In Exile, The Forgotten Ones\\" in Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries: Survival, Revolt, and Queer Antagonist Struggle. Untorelli Press, 2013. Lesbian Feminist Liberation's Jean O'Leary then read a statement on behalf of 100 women that read, in part, \\"We support the right of every person to dress in the way that she or he wishes. But we are opposed to the exploitation of women by men for entertainment or profit.\\" June, 1973. Accessed Oct 13, 2015. Queens Liberation Front's Lee Brewster replied in support of drag and the drag queens in the community. The increasingly angry crowd only calmed when Bette Midler, who heard on the radio in her Greenwich Village apartment, arrived, took the microphone, and began singing \\"Friends\\". This was one of several events in early 1970s where lesbian feminists, gay men, and drag queens at times found themselves in conflict; while other events, such as those led by the GLF women's caucus, often had harmonious participation between these sometimes contentious factions.Shepard, Benjamin Heim and Ronald Hayduk (2002) From ACT UP to the WTO: Urban Protest and Community Building in the Era of Globalization.

It is now a free house and restaurant and is a Grade II listed building, having been added to the register on 11 August 1972. History The current building was erected in the late 17th or early 18th century. The site was owned by Bath Priory until the Dissolution of the Monasteries. It was then owned by Hugh Sexey. An inn is known to have stood on the site in 1718 when it is described in a document as \\"a new erected tenement or dwelling house...now a Public House on Odwood Down\\". At that time, the lease cost forty-two pounds and there was an annual rent charge of one pound ten shillings. In the mid 18th century the lease was held by Ralph Allen who was the postmaster of Bath and made a fortune by reforming the postal delivery system. The inn was situated strategically on a crossroads, with major roads going to Bristol, Warminster, Bath and Wells. It served as a coaching inn. The front of the building was altered in the 19th century. Sexey's Hospital was the owner until 1896 when it was sold to Oakhill Brewery. It remained under the control of breweries or pub management companies until 2014, when the freehold was purchased privately. It is now a free house and restaurant. Architecture The building has late seventeenth century or early eighteenth century origins, and was extensively modified in the second half of the nineteenth century. It was built out of squared off rubble stone and has a roof of Roman tiles. Originally the building was a single room deep with two gable ends and a stair at the centre of the rear wall. It had coped front and end gables, with cross saddle-stones, and an ashlar chimney stack at each end. Since then, right and left wings have been added to the building at the rear and an ashlar extension with entrance added at the front. The building consists of three storeys and a cellar, the front extension is two storeys high and has a flat roof. There is a central tall chimney stack at the front, between the two gable ends. The interior of the building is reported to have an original staircase and fireplace.

A.O.

Harootunian (born 1929) is an American historian of early modern and modern Japan with an interest in historical theory. He is Professor Emeritus of East Asian Studies, New York University, and Max Palevsky Professor of History and Civilizations, Emeritus, University of Chicago. Harootunian edited volumes on 20th-century politics in Japan, but is best known for a series of wide-ranging monographs on the development of Japanese social and intellectual thought from late Tokugawa period through the middle of the 20th century. Career Harootunian took his Ph.D. in History in 1958 from University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, where he studied under John Whitney Hall, after earning a master's degree there in Far Eastern Studies in 1953. He is a 1951 graduate of Wayne State University. He has taught at University of Rochester, University of Chicago, University of California, Santa Cruz, where he was Dean of Humanities, and New York University. He was Editor, Journal of Asian Studies, Coeditor, Critical Inquiry, and with Rey Chow and Masao Miyoshi, co-edited the Asia-Pacific series for Duke University Press. Scholarship on Japanese intellectual history Harootunian's first monograph, Toward Restoration; the Growth of Political Consciousness in Tokugawa Japan (1970), deals with the period when a stable feudal Japan began to show tensions, leading up to the opening of the country in the 1850s and the Meiji Restoration in 1868. Kenneth Pyle, reviewing the book in the American Historical Review, wrote that many historians saw the Meiji Restoration not as a revolution but as a change carried out in the name of tradition by men who did not foresee its social ramifications. Harutoonian, said Pyle, ‚Äúhas little patience with this view.‚Äù The book attacked the ‚Äúinordinate effort to minimize the revolutionary dimensions of the Meiji Restoration and argued instead that the activists were ‚Äúno less eager to repudiate history than French revolutionaries in 1789. The values they espoused were traditional in name only.‚Äù Only the vocabulary was traditional. Pyle adds that ‚Äúthis is not an easy book‚Äù but the approach to intellectual history is ‚Äúnonetheless intelligent and imaginative.‚ÄùKenneth B. Pyle, ‚ÄúReview‚Äù The American Historical Review 76.1 (1971): 179-180. Things Seen and Unseen: Discourse and Ideology in Tokugawa Nativism (1988) focuses on Kokugaku, which Harootunian translates as \\"nativist,\\" a loosely related group that resisted Sinocentric, or Chinese, traditions and developed new frameworks which emphasized home-grown thought. Their ideas were then used by groups, especially agrarian elites, outside the capital and major cities to assert their legitimacy on the basis of Japanese traditions. The thinkers included such men as Kamo Mabuchi (1697-1769), Motoori Norinaga (1730-1801), and their successors, such as Hirata Atsutane (1776-1843). Samuel H. Yamashita, writing in the Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies, said ‚Äúwithout a doubt\\" this is \\"an extraordinary book... offering nothing less than a reinterpretation of the kokugaku movement, one that diverges in content and form from the existing scholarship, both Western and Japanese.‚Äù Yamashita saw echoes of Michel Foucault in Harootunian's drive to uncover the rules, rituals, and education that determine what is right and what is wrong and what it is possible to think. He also saw the influence of Hayden White in Harootunian's attention to language and formal structure, Harootunian, wrote Yamashita, wants to show how kokugaku scholars resisted and contested the prevailing \\"official culture and ideology.\\" The last chapters of the book show that this kokugaku thought was misappropriated by political figures in the early 20th century for chauvinistic purposes. Yamashita added that this ‚Äúis not, by conventional standards, a very readable book, but the puzzling and occasionally obtuse prose was partly intended\\" and that \\"readers unfamiliar with the issues being discussed and the theoretical material invoked will miss the main points of the book.‚ÄùSamuel Hideo Yamashita,\\"Review,\\" Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies 52.2 (1992): 763-776. Overcome by Modernity (2000) deals with the artists, critics, philosophers, poets, and social scientists of the 1920s and 1930s, a period when Japan had entered into the ‚Äúheroic phase of capitalism.‚Äù They were caught in the dilemma of explaining why Japan had to overcome ‚Äúmodernity‚Äù while explaining why it could not. Jeffrey Hanes of the University of Oregon, wrote in the American Historical Review, that ‚Äúthis is a formidable book‚Äù that is a ‚Äúchallenging sometimes maddening read, but one that rewards us with a terrifically insightful and poignant evocation of Japan‚Äôs attempts to come to grips with the modern world into which it was thrust and into which it then threw itself.‚Äù Cultural studies, critical theory, and critique of Area Studies Harootunian was a proponent of the movement to adapt and apply critical theory in a way that would put Japan in the same frame of analysis as other capitalist countries rather than making it exotic. John Lie, a University of California, Berkeley sociologist, reviewed the use of cultural studies in the Japan field and saw Harutoonian and his University of Chicago colleague Tetsuo Najita as pioneers whose impact spread from Chicago through their example and the graduate students they trained. Lie referred to the two collectively as \\"Najitunian\\" The University of Hawaii historian Patricia G. Steinhoff talked of the \\"paradigm shift\\" in the 1980s in which the field of Japanese studies learned to \\"speak Najitunian.\\" Both Lie and Steinhoff showed caution. Lie in particular objected to the influence of Edward Said's Orientalism and used the \\"University of Chicago School\\" as an example. Lie's objection was that this approach put all Asian countries into one category, did not give enough weight to historical change, and did not place enough emphasis on class differences. In reply to a review by Ian Buruma, however, Harutoonian stated \\"I am not now nor have I ever been either a 'deconstructionist' or for that matter a Maoist.\\" Harry Harootunian, A Case of ‚ÄòInverted Commas‚Äô (Letter to the editor) New York Review October 24, 2002 Harootunian deplored the overuse of modernization theory in the development of the field, especially the involvement and distorting influence of government agencies and private foundations such as the Rockefeller Foundation and the Ford Foundation. The volume Harutoonian edited with Masao Miyoshi in 2002, Learning Places: The Afterlives of Area Studies is a collection of essays that critically examine the rise of Area Studies during the Cold War, then analyze the late 20th century, post-Cold War \\"need of foreign governments, mostly outside Euro-America, to pay American universities and colleges to teach courses on their histories and societies.\\" The Japanese, Korean, and Taiwanese governments especially felt this need. The editors argue that Area Studies movement was based on the wartime need to study the enemy, but \\"fifty years after the war's end, American scholars are still organizing knowledge as if confronted by an implacable enemy and thus driven by the desire to either destroy it or marry it.\\" Universities seek to maintain this structure by soliciting these foreign donations. The Association for Asian Studies, continue Harutoonian and Miyoshi, therefore missed the opportunity to make the study of Asia into a part of the general learning of the world rather than closing off the study of individual nations. Areas Studies also suffers from accepting the traditional disciplines. The newer cultural studies, on the other hand, rise above national borders or dissolve disciplinary boundaries.Harootunian, Harry, and Masao Miyoshi. 2002. ‚ÄúIntroduction: The ‚ÄòAfterlife‚Äô of Area Studies.‚Äù In Learning Places: The Afterlives of Area Studies, edited by Masao Miyoshi and H.D.Harootunian, Durham, N.C., and London: Duke University Press p. 1, 5-6, 8. In Marx after Marx: History and Time in the Expansion of Capitalism (2015) Harootunian argues that \\"Western Marxism\\" should not be allowed to offer a purely European explanation of capitalism, since Marx himself offered a \\"deprovincialized\\" analysis rooted in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.Marx After Marx Columbia University Press Website (Accessed July 2, 2015) Selected publications History's Disquiet: Modernity, Cultural Practice and the Question of the Everyday Life, Columbia University Press, 2000. . *Overcome by Modernity: History, Culture and Commodity in Interwar Japan, Princeton University Press, 2000.

It is a type of dance performed with a dummy horse having a gap inside so that a person can fit into it to perform the dance. Materials The dummy figure of a horse's body is made of light- weighted materials (jute, cardboard, paper, and glass) and the cloth at the sides of the dummy swings to and fro covering the legs of the dancer. The dancers tie wooden legs to their feet so that sound is evoked when they are tapped on the floor, which sound like the hooves of the horse. The dancer brandishes either a sword or a whip. Performers This folk dance needs much training and skill to perform. The show is performed by men as well as women. This artistic performance is generally arranged during religious festivals and provides entertainment to the masses. Background music This dance is rendered to the accompaniment of music such as clarionet, drum, south Indian folk dance instruments such as Kundalam, Naiyaandi Melam, Thavil, Nadhaswaram, Pambai and Thalam.

The palace is one of the few Renaissance buildings of the rione Borgo to have outlived the destruction of the central part of the neighborhood due to the building of Via della Conciliazione, the grand avenue leading to St. Peter's Basilica. Location The palace is located in Rome, in rione Borgo, between Via della Conciliazione and Borgo Santo Spirito, with the main front facing east along Via dei Cavalieri del Santo Sepolcro. It lies east of Palazzo Cesi-Armellini and faces to the east Palazzo Della Rovere, two remarkable Renaissance buildings.Gigli (1992), Inside front cover History Renaissance plate of Averardo Serristori, the founder of the palace At the end of the 15th century on this area lay a small palace property of Cesare Borgia, one of the children of Pope Alexander VI (r. 1492‚Äì1503).Gigli (1992) p. 100Cambedda (1990) p. 46 Afterwards, the building was owned by Cardinal Bartolomeo Della Rovere, a staunch enemy of the Borgias. In 1565 it was pulled down, and a new palace was erected by Averardo Serristori, ambassador of Grand Duke of Tuscany Cosimo Medici to Pope Pius IV (r. 1559‚Äì65).Castagnoli (1958) p. 419 The building became the seat of the embassy of Tuscany before this was moved to Palazzo Firenze in rione Campo Marzio, and remained property of the Serristori family until 1821. In that year the Apostolic Camera bought it and transformed it in the barracks of the Papal Zouaves. In 1867, at the eve of the happenings leading to the Battle of Mentana, Giuseppe Monti and Gaetano Tognetti, two revolutionaries fighting for the annexation of Rome to the Kingdom of Italy, placed a mine in a storeroom under the palace.Gigli (1992) p. 102 This exploded on 22 October 1867 destroying a whole wing of the building and killing 23 Zouaves (nine of them Italians, members of the unit's musical ensemble, then soldiers under duty or punishment) and four civilians.Severini (2012) The two revolutionaries were both captured, sentenced to death and executed one year later. After 1870, the year when Rome was annexed to Italy, the edifice became a barrack () of the Bersaglieri, first named \\"Caserma Serristori\\" and after 1904 \\"Caserma Luciano Manara\\" after the hero of the Roman Republic of 1849.Borgatti (1926) p. 156 In 1920 the palace became a dwelling-place. In 1927, the building hosting the \\"Scuola Pontificia Pio IX\\", founded by Pope Pius IX (r. 1846‚Äì78) in 1859, lying in Piazza Pia (at the entrance of Borgo near the Tiber) and led by the religious institute of the Brothers of Our Lady of Mercy, had to be pulled down since the square had to be enlarged. Two years later, within the framework of the Lateran Pacts the Holy See got back the ownership of Palazzo Serristori, and the school was moved there, with the financial help of Pope Pius XI and of the city of Rome. The palace was modified by architect Alberto Calza Bini to adapt it to the new function. As of 2015 the school remains one of the most important in the city, hosting about one thousand students, attending primary and secondary school, Liceo Classico and scientifico. From the school depend also the sports society \\"Fortitudo 1908\\", one of the most traditional in Rome, whose football section (whose members were nicknamed \\"The lions of Borgo\\") merged with other two clubs in 1927 to form the A.S. Roma, and the \\"Filodrammatica Roma\\", an amateur dramatic society attended by some among the best 20th century Italian actors, like Renato Rascel, Amedeo Nazzari and Andreina Pagnani. Description The front of the palace looking towards Borgo Santo Spirito The building, according to a description from the time of Pope Clement VIII (r. 1592‚Äì1605), had a front with 9 windows, a yard, and was 50 Roman feet long and 85 Roman feet wide (ca. 15m √ó 25 m). The main front has square windows and at its center a portal framed by rustication.Gigli (1992) p. 104 The motif of the Keys of Heaven is repeated all around the cornice. Above the portal is located a window framed by two lesenes surmounted by a triangular pediment. The window is surmounted by a shield bearing the coat of arms of Pope Pius XI (r. 1922‚Äì39). Originally above the portal there was a Latin inscription referring to Averardo Serristori, now moved on the side facing Via della Conciliazione. A new Latin inscription, which recites \\"AD CHRISTIANAM PUERORUM UTILITATE\\" (\\"For the Christian profit of the children\\"), coming from the destroyed school in Piazza Pia, near Castel Sant'Angelo, has been put in its place.Gigli (1992) p. 106 Internally, the palace still maintains the original, large square Renaissance yard with a loggia with arches bearing up on pillars, and an open gallery, also with arches. A fountain, originally placed at the yards center, has been remounted near the yard's west side. Over the nearby wall it has been placed a Latin inscription praising Pope Pius XI. The interior of the building still shows remains of frescoes with military and patriotic subjects painted after 1870. The palace includes also a chapel, devoted to the Virgin of Mercy. The chapel has a rectangular plan, ended up with a palladian window which introduces into a cantoria covered by a groin vault. The chapel is decorated with frescoes painted in 1934 by Fra Aureliano Scaffoletti. The 19th century altar comes from the destroyed school of Piazza Pia and is surmounted by a representation of the Virgin of Mercy flanked by two angels.

It is performed by removing the solvent from a liquid-polymer solution, leaving a porous, solid membrane. Process Phase inversion is a common method to form filtration membranes, which are typically formed using artificial polymers. The method of phase inversion is highly dependent on the type of polymer used and the solvent used to dissolve the polymer. Phase inversion can be carried out through one of four typical methods: *Reducing the temperature of the solution *Immersing the polymer solution into anti-solvent *Exposing the polymer solution to a vapor of anti- solvent *Evaporating the solvent in atmospheric air or at high temperature The rate at which phase inversion occurs and the characteristics of the resulting membrane are dependent on several factors, including: *Solubility of solvent in the anti-solvent *Insolubility of the polymer in the anti-solvent *Temperature of the anti-solvent Characterization Phase inversion membranes are typically characterized by their mean pore diameter and pore diameter distribution. This can be measured using a number of established analytical techniques such as the analysis of gas adsorption-desorption isotherms, porosimetry, or more niche approaches such as Evapoporometry. A Scanning electron microscope (SEM) can be used to characterize membranes with larger pore sizes, such as microfiltration and ultrafiltration membranes, while Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) can be used for all membrane types, including small pore membranes such as nanofiltration and reverse osmosis, though optical techniques tend to analyze only a small sample area that may not be representative of the sample as a whole.

It is now in the Museo del Prado in Madrid, Spain. The painting was created and sent from Rome, and it was so successful that many copies of the original were eventually made. The painting is a remarkable example of the Spanish historical painting genre. It obtained the medal of honor in the National Exposition of Fine Arts (Spanish: Exposici√≥n Nacional de Bellas Artes) of 1878, as well as having success in the Universal Expositions of Paris in 1878, as well as that of Berlin. In the painting, Pradilla represents Joanna of Castile watching over the casket of her dead husband, Philip I of Castile. She stands upright with an expression of emptiness on her lean face and hands clenched at her side. Around her, the courtiers gather with varied expressions. Philip I of Castile died suddenly of typhoid fever, and it was said she carried his casket around with her everywhere, believing one day he would wake from slumber. This depicts a common ritual for her, and the courtiers faces all have looks of boredom and fatigue. The effects of lighting have been described as reminiscent of Rembrandt.

Evans, son of William and Catharine (Howell), was born Jan. 6, 1827 in Llangyfelach, near Swansea, South Wales. His parents moved to Bradford County, Pa., in 1831, where he obtained his early education. He graduated from Yale College in 1851. He studied theology at New Haven for about a year, and then became principal of the Delaware Literary Institute, in Franklin, N. Y. From this position he was called to a tutorship at Yale, which he resigned, however, after one year's service (1855-6). In 1857 he was appointed Professor of Natural Philosophy and Astronomy at Marietta College, Ohio, and filled that place until 1864. He was then for three years occupied in Mining Engineering, and spent a fourth year in European travel. He was the first professor appointed in Cornell University, N. Y., and from the opening of that institution, in the fall of 1868, until 1872, filled the chair of Mathematics. He resigned on account of failing health, and after an absence of a few months at the South, returned to Ithaca, and gradually sank, until his death of consumption, May 22, 1874. Professor Evans was a general scholar, and while excelling in mathematics, was perhaps the most thorough Celtic student in this country. He was married, Aug. 6, 1856, to Helen E., daughter of Rev. Dr. Tertius S Clarke, then of Franklin, N. Y. She survived him, with several children.

Origins He was born in 1706, the third son of Rev. Frederick Cornewall (1677-1748), Vicar of Bromfield, Shropshire, and his first wife Elizabeth Trice (d. 1730). He was baptised in his father's church on 3 August 1706. Career Following the example of his uncle, Admiral Charles Cornewall, he embarked on a naval career, being promoted to the rank of Lieutenant on 13 March 1734. By February 1744, he was First Lieutenant aboard under the command of his cousin James Cornewall. On 11 February 1744, in the Battle of Toulon, Marlborough was immediately astern of Admiral Thomas Mathews' Flagship and the only ship to follow the Admiral into the midst of the Franco-Spanish fleet. Outgunned by the enemy, she came under a heavy bombardment during which James Cornewall was mortally wounded when a Chain- shot carried away both his legs. Frederick took command of the ship, but he too was soon incapacitated when he lost his right arm. When Cornewall was promoted to the rank of Captain soon after, his commission was dated from the date of the battle. Cornewall's career as an independent commander did not begin auspiciously. Given command of the newly built in 1744, he was sailing the ship under the guidance of a pilot out of the Nore anchorage and on to the Downs on 21 October when it ran aground between Long Sand and the Kentish Knock. The ship could not be freed, and as her situation worsened the following day, Cornewall ordered her scuttled. It was not until 23 October that a rescue was completed and the Captain and 365 of the crew were taken off. A Lieutenant and 40 men were drowned. The subsequent Court-martial sentenced the pilot to 12 months in the Marshalsea prison. In February 1745 he was given command of , followed by in 1747. In June 1749 he made a generous donation to Thomas Coram's Foundling Hospital, and encouraged the officers and crew of the Sunderland to raise money for the same cause. In May 1755 he was appointed to , in command of which he took part in the Battle of Minorca. It was Cornewall's evidence to the court-martial that followed that was largely responsible for Admiral John Byng being convicted and executed. Frederick's final command was , shortly after it was launched in 1761 and named in honour of his late cousin. In 1752 he purchased Delbury Hall, near to Diddlebury in Shropshire, from the Bawdewin family. He was elected to represent Montgomery Boroughs on 15 June 1771, serving until the general election of 1774.

The house was built for Sabrina (Sabra) Boddie Lawrence, who inherited a large plantation and the previous house in 1841. She personally managed the plantation and at the start of the American Civil War was a prominent local landowner, owning more slaves and almost as much land as any other person in the county. After Lawrence died in 1867, her heirs sold or leased the house for an Episcopal school for boys around 1880, known has Otey school; the house was used for a few years as a dormitory.

New York: Atheneum. 1968. > Print Ardrey writes that the th√©√¢tre engag√© was part of a larger flourishing of dramatic talent that began in 1920s New York. Among the playwrights important to this moment he identifies Eugene O'Neill, Sidney Howard, Maxwell Anderson, Elmer Rice, Marc Connelly, Philip Barry, S. N. Behrman, Robert E. Sherwood, George S. Kaufman, Moss Hart, Howard Lindsay, Russel Crouse, Charles MacArthur and Ben Hecht. But the necessity for an avant garde movement, he writes, came with the Great Depression. Ardrey graduated from the University of Chicago in 1930, after having become the writing protege of Thornton Wilder. His graduation came during the beginning of the Great Depression. He writes that the lack of career prospects gave him plenty of time to write while he made a living on odd jobs. Among these were working (without qualifications) as a statistician, lecturing in anthropology at the Chicago World's Fair, conducting door-to-door surveys in Chicago's West Side slums, and forging medieval plainsongs. He also writes that the Great Depression required that artists become engaged with the times. The beginning of serious engagement in the theater he identifies as Clifford Odets' play of 1935, Waiting for Lefty. Waiting for Lefty was produced by the radical theater collective the Group Theatre, who would eventually produce several of Ardrey's plays, including Thunder Rock. Ardrey writes that after Waiting for Lefty many significant socially engaged plays followed: Sidney Kingsley's Dead End, Irwin Shaw's Bury the Dead, Odets' third play, Golden Boy, and Lillian Hellman's The Little Foxes and Watch on the Rhine. His own first three contributions to the movement were Star Spangled (produced in 1937), Casey Jones (1938), and How to Get Tough About It (also 1938). Though all three of these plays received significant critical praiseWood, E.R. \\"Introduction\\" in Ardrey, Robert, Thunder Rock. London, 1966, p. 16.Atkinson, Brooks.

New York: Applause Books. p. 71. the overall reviews were mixed and the plays were commercially unsuccessful. In recognition of Casey Jones, though, Ardrey was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for promise as a young playwright.The Robert Ardrey Estate Website. \\"About\\" At the end of the decade, Ardrey writes, the Great Depression ceased to be the most important issue which a socially engaged theater would have to address. \\"The threat of war began to overshadow the reality of want.\\" It was in response to this threat, motivated especially by the exigency of the Munich Agreement, that Ardrey wrote Thunder Rock. Thunder Rock In his introduction to Plays of Three Decades Ardrey writes that he conceived of the play in New York following a long vacation to Nantucket. He wrote the play in New Orleans during the winter and spring of 1939. Thunder Rock concerns a journalist, Charleston, who, distraught at the state of the world, withdraws into isolation as a lighthouse attendant. Amid the solitude he conjures in his imagination persons who drowned many years earlier when their steam-packet foundered in the lake. Charleston begins to argue with these characters, and in the process of refuting their hopelessness he comes to renounce his own. He rejoins the world of action. (For a complete synopsis, see Thunder Rock (play).) The play, which called for American intervention in the crisis in Europe, was lambasted by American critics, who were by and large isolationist. In New York it received bad reviews and closed after a short run. However a production was mounted in a small theatre in wartime London, where it quickly garnered major attention and huge audiences.

Jeb Jeb was presented in 1946 by Herman Shumlin. It received widespread critical praise but failed to find popularity with audiences and also closed after a short run. According to the critical consensus, Jeb was far ahead of its time. It is the story of a black veteran returning from service in the Pacific. During the war he has lost one of his legs, but he has gained the ability to run an adding machine. Back home in the rural south he seeks employment, but is faced with discrimination and violence. (For a full synopsis, see Jeb (play).) Shadow of Heroes Shadow of Heroes, a play in five acts from the Hungarian Passion, was Robert Ardrey's last play. Written in 1958 and presented by Toby Rowland in October of the same year, it dramatized the events that led up to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, as well as the brutal suppression that followed it. The play is in the style of a documentary drama, and is often cited as an early example of Verbatim theatre.Billington, Michael. \\"V is for Verbatim.\\" The Guardian May 8, 2012 The play follows L√°szlo Rajk and his wife, Julia, two members of the anti-Nazi Hungarian resistance. It details the arrest and torture of L√°szlo, his signing of a false confession under the promise of safety for him and his family, and his subsequent trial and hanging. The play then follows Julia through the uprising and subsequent Soviet repression. The play depicts her arrest and ends with the announcement that she and her son are still under arrest. (For full synopsis see Shadow of Heroes.) The play opened on October 7, 1958 at the Piccadilly Theatre in London and resulted in the release, just eleven days later, of Julia Rajk and her son.

The Governor of Adana (Turkish: Adana Valiliƒüi) is the bureaucratic state official responsible for both national government and state affairs in the Province of Adana. Similar to the Governors of the 80 other Provinces of Turkey, the Governor of Adana is appointed by the Government of Turkey and is responsible for the implementation of government legislation within Adana. The Governor is also the most senior commander of both the Adana provincial police force and the Adana Gendarmerie. Appointment The Governor of Adana is appointed by the President of Turkey, who confirms the appointment after recommendation from the Turkish Government. The Ministry of the Interior first considers and puts forward possible candidates for approval by the cabinet. The Governor of Adana is therefore not a directly elected position and instead functions as the most senior civil servant in the Province of Adana. Term limits The Governor is not limited by any term limits and does not serve for a set length of time. Instead, the Governor serves at the pleasure of the Government, which can appoint or reposition the Governor whenever it sees fit. Such decisions are again made by the cabinet of Turkey. The Governor of Adana, as a civil servant, may not have any close connections or prior experience in Adana Province. It is not unusual for Governors to alternate between several different Provinces during their bureaucratic career. Functions The Governor of Adana has both bureaucratic functions and influence over local government. The main role of the Governor is to oversee the implementation of decisions by government ministries, constitutional requirements and legislation passed by Grand National Assembly within the provincial borders. The Governor also has the power to reassign, remove or appoint officials a certain number of public offices and has the right to alter the role of certain public institutions if they see fit. Governors are also the most senior public official within the Province, meaning that they preside over any public ceremonies or provincial celebrations being held due to a national holiday. As the commander of the provincial police and Gendarmerie forces, the Governor can also take decisions designed to limit civil disobedience and preserve public order. Although mayors of municipalities and councillors are elected during local elections, the Governor has the right to re-organise or to inspect the proceedings of local government despite being an unelected position. A list of formal duties are as follows: *To oversee the implementation of government legislation, decisions and constitutional requirements within the Province of Adana *To preside over provincial ceremonies and celebrations during national holidays. *To ensure that government legislation is compatible with all institutions that it affects within Adana. *To both supervise and re-organise local government institutions if necessary. *To command both the provincial police and Gendarmerie forces. *To take decisions to limit civil disobedience and maintain peace and security. *To adjust the remit of public institutions if necessary.

First mentioned in the 14th century, the current church was built in 1869 by Pierre Cuypers. It was extended by Harry Koene in 1953, creating a larger choir, and adding an apse and sacristy. The building has been in continues use as a parish church for the Bocholtz saint James the Greater parish since 1873. The church holds a relic of pope Cornelius, which was subject of a yearly pilgrimage during the early and mid 20th century, and was listed as a national monument in 1967.  History  The first mention of a chapel in Bocholtz dates from 1373, which was part of the parish of Simpelveld in the diocese of Li√®ge. This chapel was built near a local guest house for pilgrims traveling between Aachen and Santiago de Compostela.Margry, p. 119-121 Archeological evidence of earlier buildings on this location was found during work on the clergy house in 1953, when the foundations were found of a single nave building dating back to the 12th century, surrounded by foundations of a larger building from the late Middle Ages.Jacobus de Meerdere, Kerkgebouwen-in-limburg.nl, reviewed on 14 January 2016Kerk H. Jacobus de Meerdere (Bocholtz), rijckheyt.nl, reviewed on 14 January 2016 Mass for the people in Bocholtz was the responsibility of the parson from Simpelveld, which was a common cause for dissatisfaction. Records from 1487 describe a request for the bishop of Liege to rebuild the chapel dedicated to James the Greater in Bocholtz, which was granted as long as mass was taken in Simpelveld.Van der Werf, p. 109 In 1559 Simpelveld and Bocholtz became part of the diocese of Roermond when Philip II of Spain reorganised the dioceses in the Netherlands. Clergy house During the 17th century the chapel came into disrepair, and was completely rebuilt from 1696-1697.Stenvert, p. 85 The parson from Simpelveld refused to consecrate the new chapel or give mass. In 1714 a priest from Aachen was the first to hold mass in the chapel. In 1794 the Southern Netherlands were occupied by France and eventually annexated. By law all priests had to take an oath of fidelity. Parson Augustinus Sougnez of Simpelveld refused to take the oath and fled to Dortmund afraid of being arrested. He returned in 1795, to find that another parson had temporarily taken his place, but had not sufficiently attended to Bocholtz. In 1794 Bocholtz had formed its own parish, the saint James the Greater parish, under parson Jean Benedictus Dautzenberg, meaning Bocholtz was no longer part of the parish of Simpelveld. In 1794 Bocholtz also became an independent municipality. In 1796 a clergy house was built north of the church, and after a long period of procedures the parish was eventually recognised in 1803, making the local chapel its parish church.http://www.parochiesimpelveld.nl/?page_id=217Archives of the municipality of Bocholtz, (1668) 1794-1940 (1970), Rijckheyt, p. 8 Due to population growth the old church was taken down and a new and larger parish church was built on the same location by Pierre Cuypers between 1869 and 1873. The design was based on an unused design for a church in Baarlo.http://www.cuypersroermond.nl/landkaart.html During the 19th and 20th century the population of Bocholtz increased, and the church was considered to be too small. Between 1953 and 1954 the choir was taken down and a new larger choir was built by Harry Koene, also adding an apse and sacristy.  Description  The church stands in the center of Bocholtz, and follows liturgical orientation, with the choir facing east and the main entrance in the bell tower on the west. The tower adjoins a small square in the west, which it shares with a detached clergy house north west of the church. In the far west behind the square is the churchyard. To the north is a wide sidewalk, with a parking space at the east side, and a green space with a Sacred Heart statue to the south. Besides the main entrance there are side entrances on both sides of the church and an entrance in the back to the sacristy. It is a neogothic cross shaped church made of brick, with the original 1869 design using a different color brick from the 1953 extension. The 1869 church has a tower in the west, three naves, a transept and a choir. Connected to the original choir is the extension from 1953, which stands wider than the original transept. The extension includes a second transept, and a new choir, with a sacristy attached to the northeast.Stenvert, p. 85Van Agt, p. 66 A turret projects from the left of the main entrance, standing against the main tower, with a wooden road cross against the outside turret wall. Around 50 stained glass windows, with two rose windows above the main entrance and one on both sides of the original transept.  Inventory  A black marble baptismal font from 1796 and a wooden wayside cross against the church tower. (Click on \\"33600\\" to view)  Relic  The church holds a relic, in the form of a bone fragment, of pope saint Cornelius. The relic holder is a silver- white neo-gothic metal monstrance of 33,5 centimetre height, with a round theca of about 4 centimetre diameter, which contains the bone fragment. The backside of the theca holds a red wax seal, around which the words Elenchi Dioecesi Brugenni 22.052 are written in pencil. It is not certain when the relic was acquired. Worship of Cornelius spread through Europe during the 7th to 10th century when his relics were taken to Germany, with the main center of worship at Kornelim√ºnster Abbey in Aachen, just over the border from Bocholtz. During the 19th and 20th century worship of Cornelius became popular in the Dutch provinces of North Brabant and Limburg, and the James the Greater parish acquired a statue of Cornelius. The statue is a wooden neo-gothic 132 centimetre high statue of a beardless young man in mass vestment wearing a tiara, with his right hand holding a horn and his left hand a staff. The statue stands against a column in the back of the church, on the right side of the center nave, just below the rood screen. on a neo-gothic corbel, on which the words St. Cornelius are written. In the early 20th century a yearly pilgrimage to Bocholtz was held on Cornelius' feast day of 16 September. The first mention of a pilgrimage dates from the 1930s, though it is argued that this might have existed since around 1900. People would travel in small groups on foot from Vijlen via Mamelis and the Bocholtzerheide to the James the Greater Church, where the statue of Cornelius would be on display on the choir. On Sundays during the octave a children's blessing would be given to children from the region. During the 1960s the pilgrimages stopped. The regional popularity of the children's blessing would continue through the 1970s, eventually diminishing and only drawing local attendance.Bocholtz, H. Cornelius, Meertens Institute  Monument  In 1903 the Dutch government created a national committee to document its monuments.Geschiedenis van de monumentenzorg, Is geschiedenis, reviewed on 11 September 2015 Starting in 1908 the committee published a series of books called 'Preliminary list of Dutch monuments of history and art' (Dutch: Voorloopige lijst der Nederlandsche monumenten van geschiedenis en kunst ). Each book described a province and the book about Limburg was published in 1926. The James the Greater Church was amongst six listed monuments in Bocholtz, with a specific mention for several pieces of its inventory.Oosthoek, p. 35 Starting in 1937 the preliminary lists were followed by a series of books called 'The Dutch Monuments of History and Art' (Dutch:De Nederlandse Monumenten van Geschiedenis en Kunst). The book about South Limburg was published in 1962. The James the Greater Church was listed, again with specific mention of several pieves of its inventory. A wayside cross, which was moved from its original location to the church tower and a gable stone on the clergy house were listed separately. In 1961 the Dutch parliament passed a law on monuments, replacing a temporary law from 1950. The church was listed as a national monument (nr 33600) on 16 January 1967. Two pieces of inventory were specifically mentioned, namely a black marble baptismal font from 1796 and a wooden wayside cross against the church tower. The clergy house was listed as a separate monument on 24 January 1984. (Click on \\"33601\\" to view)  Church choir  The Church Choir Saint Joseph (Dutch: Kerkelijk Zangkoor St. Joseph) was founded on 1 March 1865 under the French name Soci√©t√© Chorale St.Joseph. Originally only for men, it became a mixed choir in 1953, and had around 60 members in 2015. The choir has performed across Europe, most notable the Deutscher S√§ngerbund invited the choir to Berlin in 1964, and in 1992 the choir had an audience with Pope John Paul II, and sang in the St. Peter's Basilica and the Church of Saints Michael and Magnus. After the 1992 performance in Rome a group called Sympathisers of Church Choir Saint Joseph (Dutch: Sympathisanten Kerkelijk Zangkoor St. Joseph) was created. It consists of around 40 people who do not sing in the choir, but pay contribution and are invited to events. Best known for its Missa Luba, of which it has performed over 250 concerts since 1960, the choir celebrated its 150-year existence in 2015 with several guest choirs singing in the James the Greater Church, including a performance by the Aachen Cathedral Choir.

Koren said he originated KST after practicing on himself to relieve his own pain. Koren wrote on his website that \\"KST is an analysis protocol not a chiropractic technique.\\" He resides in Hatfield, Pennsylvania. Biography In 1977, Tedd graduated from Sherman College of Chiropractic in Spartanburg, South Carolina. He practiced as a chiropractor in Philadelphia, and during that time helped to found the (now defunct) Pennsylvania College of Chiropractic. Koren publishes brochures under the name Koren Publications, Inc. which is one of the most prolific publishers of chiropractic literature. His publications cover over 60 topics related to chiropractic care, with titles such as Allergies, Asthma & Emphysema, Blood Pressure, and more. In 1995, Koren was under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) after an anonymous complaint for \\"false and misleading advertising\\". Koren rewrote a number of his pamphlets as a result of the proposed FTC consent order, given to him in 1997. No charges were pressed and the investigation was subsequently dropped in 2001. In 2008, the World Federation of Chiropractic (WFC) accused Koren of \\"serious professional misconduct\\" by offering seminars in the technique to non-chiropractic practitioners. Koren believes chiropractic is about more than treating back pain. He believes the chiropractic method of adjusting subluxations may have positive results that range from asthma to premenstrual syndrome according to his pamphlets.

The film premiered on July 11, 2015 on HBO and July 8 on HBO Now.http://www.indiewire.com/article/6-must-watch-tv-shows-and-movies-coming- to-hbo-now-in-july-2015-from-the-drop-to-7-days-in-hell-20150702 The film was inspired by the Isner‚ÄìMahut marathon men's singles match at the 2010 Wimbledon Championships. Plot The film is framed as a fictitious HBO Sports documentary incorporating BBC footage. It explores the backgrounds of the competitors Aaron Williams (Andy Samberg) and Charles Poole (Kit Harington), two professional tennis players who face off in what becomes the longest match in history. Aaron Williams is considered \\"The Bad Boy of Tennis.\\" He is an American orphan who was found on the streets and adopted by Richard Williams, who raised Aaron with his daughters, Venus and Serena Williams. At the 1996 Wimbledon Finals, his serve hits a line judge, who has an immediate heart attack and dies. Williams falters and loses the championship. At the ceremony following the match, Williams pushes Prince Edward, the Duke of Kent (Howie Mandel), and disappears. Charles Poole is a British child prodigy forced into a tennis career by his domineering mother (Mary Steenburgen), who threatens to disown him if he loses. He appears on a sports talk show hosted by Caspian Wint (Michael Sheen) as a 15 year old and is on track to become the youngest professional tennis player in history. He tells Wint that he idolizes Aaron Williams. Williams resurfaces in Sweden creating a male underwear line, but the line is discontinued when it is found to cause groin chafing and infertility. When Williams runs out of funds, he descends into pornography and an addiction to PCP. He is arrested, convicted, and is sent to a Swedish prison. Two weeks before 2001 Wimbledon starts, Poole is asked by a reporter if he is a better player than Williams, he says yes. This comment reaches Williams, who escapes prison and becomes a free man, according to Swedish law. Williams claims he will be playing in Wimbledon. The All-England Chair Committee, led by the Duke of Kent, refuses to let him play. Edward Pudding (Fred Armisen), also a member of the committee, believes that letting Williams play will spike interest for the tournament, and he suggests that Williams play an Englishman who is likely to beat him, which turns out to be Poole. The night before the match, Poole receives a call from Queen Elizabeth (June Squibb), who tells him to \\"win.\\" On the first day of the match, Poole wins the first set 6-0. Before the second set starts, a thunderstorm suspends play for the rest of the day. On the second day, a revitalized Williams takes the second and third sets under the influence of cocaine. That night, Poole gets another call from the Queen. On the third day, neither Williams and Poole are willing to surrender the match. After eight hours of intense tennis, the match is suspended. On the fourth day, a female streaker (Lyssa Roberts) runs onto the court. Williams tries to subdue her, but ends up having sex with her. After they finish, a male streaker (Chris Romano) runs onto the court, with whom Williams also has sex. The female streaker runs back onto the court, and a threesome takes place until the match is suspended on account of darkness. Before the fifth day, Williams arranges a press conference to announce he has located his birth father, British singer Engelbert Humperdinck. He claims he will dedicate his performance at Wimbledon to all Englishmen. After darkness again suspends the match, Poole is beaten in an elevator by the Queen. Before the sixth day, Williams is hit by a truck, which is implied to be driven by Poole. Williams leaves the hospital and elects to play with one arm. In the 196th game, with Poole serving 98-97 and triple match point, David Copperfield magically appears on Poole's shoulders. Copperfield later claims he was supposed to appear on the Statue of Liberty. Poole, visibly distracted, fails to win the match in the sixth day. Before the seventh day, Poole and Williams meet at a joint press conference. Williams reveals that a sex tape of himself and Poole's ex-girlfriend Lily has been leaked, enraging Poole. Poole attacks Williams and removes his wig, revealing Williams's bald scalp. The two elect to settle their matters on the court. Queen Elizabeth makes an appearance at the match, and the two players challenge each other to fight. Although the judges try to separate them, the Queen orders that they be released allowed to fight. Poole and Williams charge the net and kill each other after simultaneously hitting each other in the head with their rackets. The two are buried together in the same coffin. The documentary ends with video flashbacks of Poole and Williams praising each other.

The office is defined by the Constitution of Russia and Chapters 1, 3 and 4 of Russia's Federal Law No. 184-FZ \\"On the General Principles of the Organization Of the Legislative (Representative) and Executive Organs Of State Power of the Subjects of the Russian Federation\\" which came into force in 1999. According to the current revision of the Russian Constitution, the Russian Federation consists of 85 federal subjects therefore there are 85 offices of head of region in Russia (see List of current heads of federal subjects of Russia). The certain title of office is defined by the federal subject's Constitution or Charter. The names include: Governor, President ( - president), Head of Administration ( - glava administratsii), Head of Republic ( - glava respubliki), Mayor ( - mer), non- officially and collectively referred to as Governors for short. The official title \\"Governor\\" is most used in Russia and traditionally it is used in Oblasts of Russia. Presidents of Russia's republics, mayor of Moscow and mayor of St. Petersburg are also governors in this sense. A head of the subject in Russia is said to serve a administration or executive office, colloquially referred to as gubernatorial administration. Role and powers The Constitution preserves the notion that the country is a federation of semi- sovereign federal subjects and that powers not specifically granted to the federal government are retained by the federal subjects. Federal subjects, therefore, are not administrative divisions. Regional governments in Russia are relatively powerful; each federal subject has its own independent criminal and civil law codes, as well as manages its internal government. The governor thus heads the executive branch in the federal subjects and, depending on the individual jurisdiction, may have considerable control over government budgeting, the power of appointment of many officials (including many judges), and a considerable role in legislation. The governor may also have additional roles, and in many territories the governor has partial or absolute power to commute or pardon a criminal sentence. All governors serve five-year terms for no more than two terms in a row. In all federal subjects, the governor is directly elected, and in most cases has considerable practical powers, though this may be moderated by the legislature and in some cases by other elected executive officials. A governor may give an annual address about his achievements in order to satisfy a constitutional stipulation that a governor must report annually (or in older constitutions described as being \\"from time to time\\") on the territory or condition of the republic/oblast. Governors of oblasts may also perform ceremonial roles, such as greeting dignitaries, conferring state decorations, issuing symbolic proclamations. The governor may also have an official residence. History In modern Russia, the governor - is the highest official figure in the Russian Federation (territory, region, autonomous region, city), heads the executive branch in the Republics and oblasts of the Russian Federation. On November 30, 1991, Presidential decree of Yeltsin, appointed Boris Nemtsov to the post of governor of the Nizhny Novgorod region in and the first week of work at the new location, Nemtsov then issued a decree according to which he, the head of the regional government, is to be officially called the governor. Thus, he became the first governor of the new Russia. From 1995 to 2005, governors were elected by the residents of the Russian Federation in the framework of direct, equal and secret ballot. From 2005 to 2012, governors were appointed by the legislative (representative) bodies of subjects of the Russian Federation by the recommendation of the President of Russia. On June 1, 2012, an Act came into force, which returns the direct election of senior officials in the regions. In 2015, governors were restricted to a term of five years, with no more than two consecutive terms. Demographics Party As of June 2019 there are 73 members of United Russia, 3 Communists, 3 Liberal Democrat, one member of A Just Russia, and five independents serving as governors. Tenure For each term, governors serve five years in office. The longest-serving current governor is Yevgeny Savchenko of Belgorod Oblast, who has served seven consecutive terms since 18 December 1993. Gender The first female governor was Valentina Bronevich who was governor of Koryak Autonomous Okrug from 1996 to 2000. There are currently 84 male state governors and one female governor: Natalya Komarova of Khanty‚ÄìMansi Autonomous Okrug.

The Governor of Aƒürƒ± (Turkish: Aƒürƒ± Valiliƒüi) is the bureaucratic state official responsible for both national government and state affairs in the Province of Aƒürƒ±. Similar to the Governors of the 80 other Provinces of Turkey, the Governor of Aƒürƒ± is appointed by the Government of Turkey and is responsible for the implementation of government legislation within Aƒürƒ±. The Governor is also the most senior commander of both the Aƒürƒ± provincial police force and the Aƒürƒ± Gendarmerie. Appointment The Governor of Aƒürƒ± is appointed by the President of Turkey, who confirms the appointment after recommendation from the Turkish Government. The Ministry of the Interior first considers and puts forward possible candidates for approval by the cabinet. The Governor of Aƒürƒ± is therefore not a directly elected position and instead functions as the most senior civil servant in the Province of Aƒürƒ±. Term limits The Governor is not limited by any term limits and does not serve for a set length of time. Instead, the Governor serves at the pleasure of the Government, which can appoint or reposition the Governor whenever it sees fit. Such decisions are again made by the cabinet of Turkey. The Governor of Aƒürƒ±, as a civil servant, may not have any close connections or prior experience in Aƒürƒ± Province. It is not unusual for Governors to alternate between several different Provinces during their bureaucratic career. Functions The Governor of Aƒürƒ± has both bureaucratic functions and influence over local government. The main role of the Governor is to oversee the implementation of decisions by government ministries, constitutional requirements and legislation passed by Grand National Assembly within the provincial borders. The Governor also has the power to reassign, remove or appoint officials a certain number of public offices and has the right to alter the role of certain public institutions if they see fit. Governors are also the most senior public official within the Province, meaning that they preside over any public ceremonies or provincial celebrations being held due to a national holiday. As the commander of the provincial police and Gendarmerie forces, the Governor can also take decisions designed to limit civil disobedience and preserve public order. Although mayors of municipalities and councillors are elected during local elections, the Governor has the right to re-organise or to inspect the proceedings of local government despite being an unelected position.

The youngest one, Oscar II's robe coronation robe from 1873 is in the Treasury at Stockholm Palace. The oldest coronation robes are in a deep purple colour, which differes from the more bright red colour that were in fashion from the 18th century and onward. The purple colour was charged with symbolism and reserved for the elite. The princely mantles, unlike the monarch's, were not purple but blue. This type of mantle has been used by Swedish princes and princesses since at least the 18th century.  Royal mantles   Eric XIV of Sweden  Eric XIV's coronation robe is the oldest garment that has been kept from a Swedish coronation. It is a velvet robe in a deep purple colour. Originally the robe was decorated with 455 golden crowns. The crowns are embroidered with golden, white, blue and pink silk, and on each crown ten small pearls were attached. Today only 296 of the crowns remain. When king Eric was crowned the robe also had a trimming and a collar made out of ermine. After Eric XIV, John III, Charles IX and Gustav II Adolf have used the robe during their coronations.  Christina of Sweden  Queen Christinas coronation robe was ordered in Paris for the coronation in 1650. The blue and violet, purple velvet robe was originally decorated with 764,5 embroidered crowns in gold, and sewn on pearls. Both the crowns and the pearls were ripped out during the 18th century. The ermine collar and trimming is also missing today. The robe has also been worn by Charles XI, Charles X Gustav and Charles XII. The last one to be crowned in Christina's robe was Frederick I in 1720.  Ulrika Eleonora of Sweden  For queen Ulrika Eleonora the younger's coronation in 1718 a blue and violet, purple robe, originally made for Charles X Gustav, was used. The decor consisted of golden flames and crowns. The robe was also worn by Hedwig Eleonora during her son's, Charles XI's, coronation. The ermine lining was removed in 1770.  Adolf Frederick of Sweden  Adolf Frederick's coronation robe is made out of red and violet, purple velvet and it was bought in Paris in 1751. It is decorated with groups of crowns embroidered with gold and silver threads. The lining is made of ermine, and the robe has been worn by Gustav III, Gustav IV Adolf, Charles XIII and Charles XIV John at their coronations. The train was extended for the coronation of Gustav III in 1772.  Princely mantles  Swedish princely mantle from 1772. At the Swedish court since the 18th century, there emerged the distinction of using blue for princes and purple for the king; mantles, boots and headgear followed this distinction. This distinction can be observed at the coronation of King Adolf Frederick and Queen Louisa Ulrika in 1751: The king and queen arrived at the ceremony wearing blue princely mantles and left wearing the purple royal mantles. The colour used for the mantle is described in the documents as Bleu Royal, i.e. royal blue. The mantles themselves were worn until 1907, during the state opening of the Riksdag. As King Gustaf V would not undergo a coronation, the practice of wearing the mantles, both royal and princely, stopped. However, the royal mantle was still laid out over the silver throne at solemn ceremonies, such as the Riksdag's formal opening until 1974.

As of 2015, 11 monographs of his photography have been published by houses such as New York Graphic Society; Little, Brown; Wesleyan University Press; and Steidl. The transfer of Trager's archive of photographic prints, negatives, and marked proofs to the Library of Congress began in 2006. As C. Ford Peatross ‚Äî founding director and curator for the Library of Congress's Center for Architecture, Design and Engineering ‚Äî remarked: \\"[Trager's] careful eye, his sensitivity to the slightest nuances of light and atmosphere and his finely honed understanding of structure have allowed him to capture‚Äîand us to see anew‚Äîsubjects ranging from the gritty vernacular of American cities to the works of Palladio and the monuments of Paris, from the clouds framing and defining landscapes to frozen moments in the drama of the dance.\\"\\"Library of Congress is Repository for Photographs by Philip Trager, Now Featured in National Building Museum Exhibition,\\" in \\"News from the Library of Congress,\\" July 16, 2009. https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2009/09-141.html Once the transfer of Trager's work is complete, ‚Äúthis exceptional trove of artistic images will be available to scholars, photographers, and the public for generations to come.‚Äù Biography Trager was born in 1935 in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where he attended high school. He completed his undergraduate studies in history at Wesleyan University, which conferred an honorary Doctor of Arts degree on him in 2008.Olivia Drake, \\"2008 Honorary Degree Recipients Announced,\\" in \\"news@Wesleyan,\\" April 4, 2008. https://newsletter.blogs.wesleyan.edu/2008/04/04/0408honorarydegrees-htm/ He next attended Columbia University School of Law in New York. He pursued dual careers in law and photography until 1992, when he ceased practicing law and commenced devoting his focus to photography exclusively. Trager lives in Connecticut, his home for most of his life, with his wife, Ina.  Photography As Library Journal said in 2006, \\"Trager has spent more than 40 years making photographs that transform our physical world into moments of clarity and brightness unique to the medium.\\"[Debora Miller, ‚ÄúPhilip Trager‚Äù [review]. Library Journal, December 2006, p. 121.] Initially, his images' subjects centered on buildings and their settings, but less from the viewpoint of architect or engineer than from what Peter Schjeldahl has termed \\"place portraiture.\\"[Peter Schjeldahl], ‚ÄúThe Instant Age,‚Äù in Legacy of Light, ed. Constance Sullivan. New York: Knopf, 1987, p. 13.] In 1987, Trager published Villas of Palladio (New York Graphic Society), about which Schjeldahl wrote that, ‚Äúthe place-portraiture of Philip Trager‚Äôs Palladian villas [is] . . . as beautiful, it seems to me, as any photographs I have ever seen.‚Äù By the time this book was released, however, Trager was already devoting himself to making images of modern dancers in motion. His book Dancers was published in 1992. Trager does not use stop-action strobes, a photographic device popular with many dance photographers; instead, his images of dancers such as Mark Morris, Eiko & Koma, David Parsons, and Bill T. Jones (among many others), show them soaring through space or sagging heavily to the ground. Trager made almost all of these dance images outdoors in natural light. In the LA Times, Donna Perlmutter said that, \\"this collection of startling black-and-white museum pieces, using lush alfresco settings. . . besieges the eye with its bold sense of mystery, contradiction and surprise.\\"Donna Perlmutter, \\"Nonfiction,\\" LA Times, October 18, 1992. http://articles.latimes.com/1992-10-18/books/bk-669_1_philip-trager Returning to architecture in the mid-1990s, Trager began work on a collection of photographs of the built environment bordering the Seine in Paris. From the start, Trager has used large-format view cameras (particularly 4 x 5 and 5 x 7, occasionally 11 x 14) for his images of architecture. During a 2005 interview with Stephanie Wiles, then director of the Allen Memorial Art Museum at Oberlin College, Trager said, ‚ÄúI happen to be a Type-A personality and quick by nature, and with the view camera somehow you have to slow down. The dance photographs, of course, were totally different.‚Äù To communicate his vision fully and accurately, Trager personally prints all his gelatin silver prints, and relies on a master photographic-printmaker for the palladium and platinum prints often seen in exhibitions. As Jeremy Adamson, chief of the Prints and Photographs Division of the Library of Congress, wrote: ‚Äú[Trager‚Äôs] keen eye for expressive form and shape, his emotional sensitivity to the effects of light and atmosphere, his intellectual appreciation of the dynamics of structures, both architectural and human, and his command of the temporal moment have resulted in extraordinarily evocative compositions.‚Äù  Monographs Although Trager's photographs have been reproduced in many publications dealing with the art of photography, architecture, and dance, he is best known for the meticulously prepared and produced monographs of his black-and-white photographs. Many of his early architectural images were collected in two such monographs: Photographs of Architecture (1977) and Philip Trager: New York (1988), and in the introduction to the latter art historian Samuel M. Green II situated Trager's visual acuity, saying, ‚Äúthe success of these photographs‚Ä¶derives from the penetration of [Trager‚Äôs] vision, his ability to state the quintessential.‚Äù[Quoted in ‚ÄúLight and Line: Lawyer Makes His Mark as Art Photographer.‚Äù ABA Journal 70 (November 1984), p. 37.] His next publication, The Villas of Palladio (1987), was widely and favorably reviewed. For example, in Progressive Architecture, John DiGregorio wrote: ‚ÄúWith this volume Trager has done something extraordinary‚Äîhe has managed to transcend the boundary between the use of the photographic image as visual documentation and its use as a vehicle for artistic expression.‚Äù[John DiGregorio, ‚ÄúThe Villas of Palladio‚Äù [review]. Progressive Architecture 68 (August 1987), p. 115.] Changing Paris: A Tour along the Seine (2000), Trager's eighth monograph, was the last to be published by a United States- based publisher. The German publisher Steidl released Faces in 2005 and Philip Trager, the catalogue to a major traveling retrospective exhibition of his work, the following year. The same house is publishing New York in the 1970s (2015), which draws on negatives recently rediscovered by the photographer. In 2016, Steidl will release Photographing Ina.

It debuted in October 2011. Itfeatures historical, horror, pop culture, and Judeo-Christian references. Premise Luther Strode, a skinny teenager, lives with his mother. After orders a Charles Atlas analog, the Hercules Method, which gives him enhanced physical abilities. The creators intended the story as a slasher movie combined with the premise Spider-Man, if Peter Parker had not had the moral anchor of his Uncle Ben. Plot Luther comes home with his best friend Pete to find his mail order exercise manual for the Hercules Method has come in. He starts planning to use it immediately after Pete has left for the day. Luther trains by himself that night, but to his disappointment there are no visible results. A man bound from head to toe in a mysterious location is confronted by a bald man, identified as the Librarian; he approaches and tells the bound man they've found a candidate. Luther, meanwhile, has gained inhuman reflexes and speed, as seen when he catches a falling dish. At school, Pete pushes Luther into Petra, a girl who he's been pining for. Later at P.E. Pete is hit during a game of dodge ball; a bully, named Paul, takes a cheap throw at Luther, who isn't seemingly paying attention. Luther's reflexes kick in and he catches it and throws it back with enough force that it's later revealed he broke Paul's nose. Aboard a ship in an unknown location a single crewman is hunted and seemingly killed by the Librarian. Back at school, Pete and Luther are cornered by Paul and his friends in the bathroom; Luther at first takes the beating from Paul until Paul mentions Petra. Luther responds with a single punch that shatters Paul's jaw and disgusts everyone else. A few weeks later, Luther returns to the school after being suspended for the punch. Paul again tries to pick a fight. Uncharacteristically, as he stops Paul from going after Pete, Luther starts having visions of him starting a school massacre with just his bare hands. After relaxing and letting Paul go on his way, he begins to notice he is starting to see people as their musculature, but it appears to stop. Petra approaches, and after some talk that makes Pete leave her alone with Luther, Petra admits she mutually has feelings for Luther. Later that night, Paul is attacked and killed by the Librarian, who has already slaughtered his parents. Luther is training when Petra comes into his room, catching him in just his underwear. An unknown amount of time later, Luther recounts the night with Petra to Pete as they go to a liquor store, which gets held up. Luther uses his abilities to stop the robbery and Pete declares him a superhero. A few nights later, Pete gives Luther a makeshift costume consisting of all black clothing and a homemade mask. After debating about the costume and his powers with Pete, it's revealed that Luther's father abused his mother and he felt helpless to stop it. After trying to slip out of the house and being caught by his mother, he tells he her he'll protect her if his father does find them. He goes on patrol in costume, but finds nothing until he discovers a man pulling a woman with him forcefully after leaving the club, he tries to intervene but the woman defends the man before Luther can do much. Luther decides to visit Petra, but after a brief talk her father catches her and he has to leave. It's shown later that the robbers that Luther stopped are killed by the Librarian, when Pete talks to Luther about it they're interrupted by Petra, who has been physically abused but is hiding it and being evasive. Luther in his frustration visits the guy who was defended by the woman the previous night, and beats him half to death. After throwing the beaten man across the room, the Librarian enters and tells Luther to finish it. Luther believes it's finished, but the Librarian attacks saying he's wrong and telling Luther how he's been cleaning up behind him. Luther loses the brawl and is knocked out, when he awakens he finds his father being offered to Luther by the Librarian. It is only when Luther ask why he's picked that it's revealed it starts with biblical Cain, who then passed down his teachings of unlocking power through the years in the form of a manual that only some can unlock the potential, one of which is revealed to be the serial killer Jack the Ripper. It's revealed that Luther's father had the potential but he wasted it, Luther refuses to kill his father and the Librarian kills the elder Strode. After Luther recovers the Librarian tells him that he sent the friends of man Luther attacked to attack someone he cares for. Luther believes it's his mother, but after running off to help her, he finds her at home, safe and talking to Pete. It's only then which it occurs that it was Petra the Librarian was talking about. Luther goes after Petra's father for information of where they took her and beats him bloody. Pete however is stuck explaining everything to Mrs. Strode, when the Librarian comes and kidnaps Mrs. Strode leaving Pete for dead after pinning him to a cabinet with knives. At the same time Luther mounts a rescue for Petra, and is shot, but it's revealed he's now impervious to small arms fire. Luther slaughters the kidnappers in front of Petra. She passes out and wakes up to find they're in Luther's home and Pete's barely alive still as Luther deduces the truth. Pete dies and Luther goes after the Librarian while telling Petra to warn the police. The Librarian is holed up in an old wooden fishery as he explains his work of spreading the \\"Hercules Method\\" to Luther's mother revealing that Luther is the first in decades to be gifted enough. Then the Librarian pulls Luther out of a hiding place, which begins their final fight, however it's interrupted as Luther accidentally kills his own mother as the Librarian dodges in a way that puts her in the path of Luther's attack. After lamenting his loss, Luther continues fighting, even after being disemboweled. Their fighting destroys the fishery revealing the cops have arrived with Petra as the building comes down. At first the Librarian appears victorious, but then Luther suddenly appears to rip his spine and head out of his back. Luther seeing no way out of this charges at the police and they gun him down. However, after being placed in the morgue Luther punches his way out of the body bags before cutting away to the man who is bound giving a chuckle.

The bridal train  The bridal entourage began its journey at 9.30 in the morning on November 25. In the bridal carriage was Maria Eleonora who just turned 21, and her mother Duchess Anna of Prussia. The bridal train started at Bergshamra outside of Stockholm, and in it was the bride's sister and aunt, eight maids, seven junkers and many carriages, amongst others. The train was greeted by Gustav II Adolf's impressive entourage when they reached Stockholm. The king himself came up to the bride's carriage together with Axel Oxenstierna to greet her. The bridal train continued to The Royal Castle, where the king's mother Christina of Holstein-Gottorp and the old dowager queen Catherine Stenbock met them.  The wedding  In the afternoon on November 25 the bride and the groom were brought in a procession to the hall of state at the Royal Castle. First came the marshal Svante Ban√©r and six timpanists. After them came a long line of noblemen, privy councils and more timpanists. Then came the bridal couple, followed by their mothers. Archbishop Petrus Kenicius officiated the wedding in Swedish. After that, the couple were taken to their nuptials in a red gold-embroidered velvet bed. There the bridal couple got to eat confectionery, listen to speeches and drink wine. The hall of state was converted and made up for the wedding dinner. The festivities were ended, as they should, with the newly weds dance. Maria Eleonora was crowned three days later in Storkyrkan in Stockholm. The festivities continued the days after the wedding and the coronation, for instance with a wedding tournament.

It was located at the junction of the Central Massachusetts Railroad and the Framingham and Lowell Railroad slightly north of Boston Post Road (U.S. Route 20) in South Sudbury. The station was incorporated into the MBTA Commuter Rail system's Central Massachusetts Branch, but was closed in November 1971 when the branch's last remaining round trip was discontinued. The 1952-built station building is now a private business. History South Sudbury Union Station in 1911 Abandoned diamond crossing at South Sudbury in April 2016 The Framingham and Lowell Railroad (F&L;) opened between its namesake cities on October 1, 1871. Its South Sudbury station and freight house were located on the east side of the tracks, on the north side of Boston Pond Road. The Central Massachusetts Railroad (CM) opened from Boston to Hudson, Massachusetts in October 1881. After going out of business in 1883, it was reopened by the Boston and Lowell Railroad (B&L;) in 1885, which was, in turn, acquired by the Boston and Maine Railroad (B&M;) in 1887. The Old Colony Railroad, which had acquired the F&L; in 1879, constructed a union station at the southeast corner of the junction of the two lines around 1887-91. This Victorian-style station included a three-story tower. The Old Colony Railroad was leased by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad (often referred to as just the \\"New Haven Railroad\\") in 1893, making South Sudbury one of a small number of stations which served both of New England's two largest railroads. Passenger service ended on the F&L; in 1933 (although freight service between South Sudbury and West Concord lasted until 1982, and between South Sudbury and Framingham Centre into the 1990s). Service on the CM past Clinton Junction ended in 1932 and on the branch to Marlborough in 1939; by 1950, there were just four daily round trips. With such drastically-reduced traffic levels, it was no longer economical for the B&M; to maintain the large Union Station. A small wooden station was built around 1952; after failed attempts to move and preserve it, Union Station was demolished. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority was formed in August 1964 to subsidize suburban commuter rail service. On January 18, 1965, northside services were cut back to the boundaries of the MBTA funding district. Although the MBTA initially intended to discontinue the single remaining trips on the Central Massachusetts Branch and the Lexington Branch, they were kept at the last minute. However, the remaining CM trip was cut from Hudson to South Sudbury. On November 26, 1971, the remaining South Sudbury round trip was discontinued due to poor track conditions and dwindling ridership. The circa-1952 station building is still extant, and is in use as a private business. Part of the platform, a station sign reading \\"Sudbury\\", and a Railway Express Agency cart remain at the building.
