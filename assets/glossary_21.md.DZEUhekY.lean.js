In the Oxford Program, every minute is a ‚Äòteaching moment‚Äô and every action, attitude and interaction is undergirded with an unwavering commitment to each child as a unique and delightful individual; an individual that should be guided through an exciting, sequential journey of self- discovery and personal creativity, as they develop a sense of character, good judgment, and positive self-worth while building foundational language and mathematical skills in an environment rich in social development.\\"Journal of Character Education\\", Oxford Developmental Preschool Program Comes to Wisconsin, Madison: March, 2011  History  The Oxford Development Preschool Program was founded in Great Britain in the early 1980s, as part of a growing recognition that lifelong character traits and social skills are inculcated in the earliest years of childhood development.Character Matters: How to Help Our Children Develop Good Judgment, Integrity, and Other Essential Virtues, Thomas Lickoma, New York: Simon & Schuster, 2004 Drawing on the ground-breaking insights of the Oxford Preschool Research Project, the Program began with the hope that every child's first five years might be put to their fullest use towards the goals of lifelong physical, emotional, spiritual and relational health along with personal contentment, self-awareness discipline, a strong moral character and a sense of community responsibility.Under Five in Britain: the Oxford Preschool Research Project, Jerome Bruner, London: Grant McIntyre, 1980  Philosophy  The activities and daily schedule of the Oxford Preschool Developmental Program optimize sensory, motor, perceptual, language and mathematical skill advancement and enhancement through child-centered, active, creative involvement.\\"Early Childhood Research Quarterly\\", Influences on Children's Competence in Early Childhood Classrooms, Susan Kontos and Amanda Wilcox-Herzog, Lafayette, Indiana: 1997, pp. 247-262 In the Oxford Program, the process as is important as the product, therefore, children learn through a meaningful symmetry of projects and activities balancing teacher- directed structure and free choice, reinforced through repetition. Fundamental to the Oxford Preschool Developmental Program is respect for each child as an individual and an understanding of the uniqueness of every family situation and structure. An Oxford Developmental Preschool seeks to work as a ‚Äòteam‚Äô with parents and guardians to create a consistent and dynamic developmental synthesis between home and school so that each child ‚Äì beginning at their stage of development and progressing without anxiety or pressure ‚Äì will attain their greatest potential while developing a love and excitement for learning.Journal of Teacher Education, \\"Dispositions as Virtues: The Complexity of the Construct\\", Hugh Sockett, Washington: May/June, 2009, pp. 292-303  Sequential Development  The Oxford Preschool Developmental Program fosters a sense of security and consistency as essentials for healthy emotional, social and mental development, therefore, all activities and schedule follow an easily understood, child-centered, gently teacher-directed sequence. Children are guided through a wide range of interconnection, ‚Äòhands- on‚Äô activities and encouraged to use their personal creativity and curiosity in focused Discovery Centers. In Life Discovery Centers, children are introduced to nature (and in the growing months, to outdoor vegetable and flower gardens); in the Arts and Crafts Center, children are free to experiment and create within a safe and encouraging space; in the Mathematics Center, some puzzles, games and manipulatives stimulate cognitive development through play and interaction; and, in the Home and Health Center, children learn household safety, housekeeping and healthy habits through dramatic play.  Character Education  The Oxford Preschool Developmental Program is committed to an intentional, focused and individually sensitive effort to instill in the child entrusted to their care core universal, ethical values such integrity, honesty, fairness, responsibility, and respect for themselves and for others.

The attack occurred around 12:20 WIB (UTC+7) during Friday prayers. The bomber was killed and at least 28 people were injured, most of whom were praying in the mosque.  Background  Detachment 88 of the Indonesian National Police, the special unit for anti-terrorism, has been successful in capturing and killing numerous terrorist suspects, especially those affiliated with Jemaah Islamiyah. The bombing, which targeted the Police, marked a shift in terrorist attacks in Indonesia, as previous attacks have been targeted at symbols of Western influence such as hotels (2003 and 2009 Marriott bombings), embassies (2004 Australian embassy bombing), or night clubs (2002 Bali bombings). The target of the attack is Az-Zikra mosque in the local Police office compound. Like most mosques in Indonesia, the mosque in the police compound didn't have any security. It is Indonesia's first terrorist attack after two years of peace following 2009 Jakarta bombings.  Bombing  The bomber arrived in the mosque approximately 12.10 when the khatib was finishing the sermon. The perpetrator was approximately 25 to 30 years old and 165‚Äì170 cm tall and carried a backpack. The bomber showed up in the mosque wearing a full black dress, and concealed the explosives behind his black jacket. The bomber was probably targeting the Cirebon police chief, Adjutant Senior Commander (Police) Herukoco, since he chose to stand near him. As the imam leading the prayer, the bomber detonated his explosives. Following the loud explosion, the bomber is killed with his stomach destroyed. The explosion injured at least 28 victims. Most of these are the praying police officers, while one is a civilian who happen to use the mosque for Friday prayer. Most of the victims are injured from nails and screws attached to the bomb. The victims -including the police chief of Cirebon, were evacuated to the nearby hospitals.  Reactions  Following the attack, Indonesian police increased security in all of it regional branches. Street merchants, which have been a common feature in front of Indonesian Police stations, have been banned temporarily. Indonesian Police sent a forensic team from West Java Police to identify the perpetrator. Detachment 88 anti-terrorism unit has also deployed. According to early observation Al Qaeda (with its local Jemaah Islamiyah affiliates) could be behind the attack. Security analyst predict that the attack was revenge for Indonesian Police clampdown on terrorism, as several high-profile militants suspected of involvement in past bombings in Indonesia have recently been arrested or killed by the police. The attack was condemned by various leaders and public figures in Indonesia. Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono strongly condemned the attack and called on the society as a whole to work together to eradicate terrorism. Religious Affairs Minister Suryadharma Ali, who is also chairman of United Development Party (PPP) urged the public not to be provoked by the terrorist attack. Governor of West Java province, Ahmad Heryawan also condemned the bombing and urged the police to completely investigate the attacks. Nahdlatul Ulama, the largest Muslim organization in the country condemned the attack. The organization's chairman Said Aqil Siradj called the attack \\"very irresponsible\\" and concurring the observation that terrorism has shifted from aiming at western symbols to focusing on domestic targets. Investigation The body of the perpetrator is badly mangled but his head is still intact, enabling the Police to obtain his face photograph. This photograph was released in order to identify the suspect. After the photo was released it was identified as Muhammad Syarif, 24, a Cirebon resident. He was identified by his mother, who came forward hours after the police released the photo. This identification was confirmed by the suspect's family and his neighbors. His identity is further confirmed by DNA test.

J., Shane Crossagh, The County Derry Rapparee. Royal Society of Antiquities of Ireland Background Shane Crossagh's father, Donal, lived in Tullanee, Faughanvale, in the barony of Keenaght, County Londonderry, until his family where evicted when a bailiffs son was insulted in Donal's house. When Shane was later caught cutting grass at the property, the family in an attempt to escape punishment relocated to Lingwood in the mountains above Claudy. Here lived many people whose fathers had been dispossessed to make way for settlers from Great Britain. With Lingwood as his base, Shane would form a gang made up of people who were either greedy for plunder or for vengeance, becoming rapparees carrying out attacks and raids throughout the Sperrins mountain range. Shane was eventually caught and hanged with his sons in the Diamond in Derry in the 1720s, being possibly interred between 1725 and 1735 in the cemetery of Banagher. The Glenshane Pass, through which the main road between Derry and Belfast runs, is named after him. Crossagh His nickname, Crossagh, came from the Irish word \\"Crosach\\" meaning \\"pock-marked\\".

See also Devotion (disambiguation). In ancient Roman religion, the devotio was an extreme form of votum in which a Roman general vowed to sacrifice his own life in battle along with the enemy to chthonic gods in exchange for a victory. The most extended description of the ritual is given by the Augustan historian Livy, regarding the self-sacrifice of Decius Mus.Livy 8.9; for a brief introduction and English translation of the passage, see Mary Beard, J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, Religions of Rome: A Sourcebook (Cambridge University Press, 1998), p. 157 online. The English word \\"devotion\\" derives from the Latin. Devotio may be a form of consecratio, a ritual by means of which something was consecrated to the gods.Donald G. Kyle, Spectacles of Death in Ancient Rome (Routledge, 1998), p. 87 online; Matthew Leigh, Lucan: Spectacle and Engagement (Oxford University Press, 1997), p. 131 online. The devotio has sometimes been interpreted in light of human sacrifice in ancient Rome,Paul Plass, The Game of Death in Ancient Rome: Arena Sport and Political Suicide (Wisconsin University Press, 1995), pp. 226‚Äì227 online; Alison Futrell, Blood in the Arena: The Spectacle of Roman Power (University of Texas Press, 1997, 2001 reprint), p. 194 et passim. and Walter Burkert saw it as a form of scapegoat or pharmakos ritual.Walter Burkert, Structure and History in Greek Mythology and Ritual (University of California Press, 1979), p. 59ff. online. By the 1st century BC, devotio could mean more generally \\"any prayer or ritual that consigned some person or thing to the gods of the underworld for destruction.\\"James B. Rives, \\"Magic, Religion, and Law: The Case of the ',\\" in Religion and Law in Classical and Christian Rome (Franz Steiner, 2006), pp. 56‚Äì57. The invocation Livy preserves the prayer formula used for making a devotio. Although Livy was writing at a time when the religious innovations of Augustus were often cloaked in old-fashioned piety and appeals to tradition, archaic aspects of the prayer suggest that it is not an invention, but represents a traditional formulary as might be preserved in the official pontifical books. The attending pontifex even dictates the wording. The syntax is repetitive and disjointed, unlike prayers given literary dress during this period in the poetry of Ovid and others.Matthias Klinghardt, \\"Prayer Formularies for Public Recitation: Their Use and Function in Ancient Religion.\\" Numen 46 (1999), pp. 4, 20‚Äì21. The deities invoked ‚Äî among them the Archaic Triad of Jupiter, Mars, and Quirinus ‚Äî belong to the earliest religious traditions of Rome. Livy even explains that he will record the archaic ritual of devotio at length because \\"the memory of every human and religious custom has withered from a preference for everything novel and foreign.\\"Livy, 8.11.1: omnis divini humanique moris memoria abolevit nova peregrinaque omnia praeferendo; Andrew Feldherr, Spectacle and Society in Livy's History, (University of California Press, 1998), p. 41, note 125. The prayer is uttered by Publius Decius Mus, the consul of 340 BC, during the Samnite Wars. He vows to offer himself as a sacrifice to the infernal gods when a battle between the Romans and the Latins has become desperate: > The pontifex instructed him to don the toga praetexta, to veil his head and, > with one hand held out from under his toga touching his chin, to stand on a > spear laid under his feet and speak as follows: 'Janus, Jupiter, Mars Pater, > Quirinus, Bellona, Lares, divine Novensiles,That the novensiles would appear > in such a list at all, and before the indigetes, is surprising if they are > \\"new,\\" one of the explanations for the nov- element of their names.

The band consists of James New (lead vocals and synthesizers), James Arguile (synthesizers) and Josef Page (electronic drums). They prefer to describe their music as 'electronic soul' and 'pop noir' with their main instruments being analogue synthesizers. Their brand of synthesizer driven pop music is commonly compared to the sound of bands such as Kraftwerk, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, Depeche Mode and Blancmange. They released their d√©but album in February 2011 called Lights and Offerings which was promoted by a number of singles in 2010 and 2011.  History  = Formation (2008) = Mirrors were formed by James New and Ally Young after Mumm-Ra broke up in 2008. The two met in Brighton in 2008 and started working on the idea of, according to them, the ideal group, in May 2008. James: \\"This ideal group would have visuals as part of their live experience. It would have things going on on pavements. It would play in the middle of a room.\\" So the pair met up one day in May 2008 and plotted a strategy to transform all this disappointment into inspiration. They specifically talked about what an ideal group should be. Once the basics were set, James Arguile would soon join the group followed by Josef Page, leaving behind him a promising career in hospital administration, as the final member and they started working on their visuals which would include suits and ties and keeping control over their artwork and videos. = \\"Look at Me\\" / \\"Into the Heart\\" (2009) = Their first live performance was in May 2009 at New Hero in Brighton. After demoing some songs that year such as \\"Fear of Drowning\\", \\"Hide and Seek\\", \\"Searching in the Wilderness\\" and \\"Write Through the Night\\" (called \\"Organ Song\\" as a demo, because of the heavy usage of organ-soundlike synthesizers), the first single would become \\"Look at Me\\", released through the Pure Groove label, supposedly to be limited to just 200 copies on a one-sided red vinyl 7\\". Soon after their first release they signed up with Moshi Moshi and released their second single, \\"Into the Heart\\" in November, which also featured a new B-side called \\"Lights and Offerings\\", a title they would use in 2011 for their d√©but album. = Lights and Offerings (2010‚Äì2011) = After this they came to the attention of Skint Records. Skint Records appeared to be an obvious choice, because the label is from Mirrors' home town Brighton, making face-to-face contact much easier. The label also understand their goals and artistic direction. Mirrors continued with performing the occasional gigs in the United Kingdom until they headed into the studio in June 2010, working on their d√©but album. Having written most of the material already in 2009, the album sessions could be finishing in just one month. The first single from these sessions was \\"Ways to an End\\", released on 23 August as a download and 7\\" vinyl single. They toured as a support act for Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark in November 2010 and released two more singles and a special tour EP before their d√©but album Lights and Offerings was released on 28 February 2011 in the UK and on 18 March in Europe. They started touring as a headline act on 12 April 2011 in Cologne, Germany and supported Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark in Spain in June. A fourth single from the d√©but album was released on 6 June 2011 being \\"Look at Me\\" with the double A-side \\"Perfectly Still\\". The single was previously released in 2009 on the Pure Groove label. The new single features a new remix by Simon Thornton. Mirrors' first documentary was aired on Channel 4 on 9 June 2011 at 0:35am GMT as part of the 4Play program. On 8 July 2011 they performed live in Berlin, Germany, at the Michalsky Stylenite fashion show which was streamed live on the internet On 16 August 2011 Mirrors announced that they cancelled the September performances with OMD plus their performance at Bestival, Isle Of Wight, as they were working on new material. Radioactive Man released a remix of the Mirrors' track \\"Ways to an End\\" on 12 September 2011. The digital bundle contains a remix and an instrumental version of the aforementioned remix. On 13 October Ally Young announced he was leaving the band. Two new songs were made available on the band's Myspace account and SoundCloud on 19 October 2011. They also confirmed that the remaining three band members will continue and are back in the studio recording further tracks. Skint released a digital compilation EP of previously released remixes plus a few new ones, entitled Deconstructed. = This Year, Next Year, Sometime . . . ? (2012‚Äìpresent) = Mirrors released a new digital EP on 26 January 2012, called This Year, Next Year, Sometime . . . ?, in order to finance their potential second studio album. The EP contains the two new songs that were made available in October 2011 plus 5 previously unreleased demos, which were recorded either in the last couple of months or during their first album session in June 2010.

She studied drama at Vassar College. After graduating in 2003, she relocated to Paris to study acting at the International Theatre School of Jacques Lecoq. Becoming \\"disenchanted with theater school,\\" she moved to Baltimore in 2004. She is the niece of the French composer Michel Legrand and Christiane Legrand of The Swingle Singers. As a teenager, she was part of a Led Zeppelin cover band. Career In 2004, Legrand met Baltimore-native Alex Scally, and they quickly formed a two-piece band. Legrand often mentions how organically they work together, and how, in Scally, she found her \\"musical soulmate.\\" The two have recorded seven studio albums as Beach House: Beach House (2006), Devotion (2008), Teen Dream (2010), Bloom (2012), Depression Cherry and Thank Your Lucky Stars (2015), and 7 (2018).

Some music outlets have compared her vocals to those of Nico and Mazzy Star's Hope Sandoval. =Songwriting and influences= Legrand and Scally write music anywhere between eight and 16 hours a day, and strive to create thoughtful music they feel strongly about. Legrand often emphasizes the honesty, thoughtfulness, and authenticity Beach House tries to get across in their music. Legrand laments the references to Beach House as being \\"wafty, wavy, floaty, dreamy,\\" and insists on the band's loudness and all-encompassing soundscapes they create: \\"We are a loud band. OK, so it's not abrasive, but it's not soft.\\" Legrand has said in interviews that she wishes audiences would focus on the craft of their songwriting; She commented, \\"what you're feeling is the craft, that everything is there with intention,\\" as opposed to the individual sounds that surround \\"the real meat of it all....There's a lot of great sounds in music, but it's not gonna necessarily make you feel something.\\" She is protective of the identity of the band and cautiously chooses how they expose themselves to their audience.

Symptoms  The defining characteristic of BPT is a tilting of an infant's head in recurrent episodes, for varying periods of time.Deonna, T. & Martin, D. (1981) Benign paroxysmal torticollis in infancy. Archives of Disease in Childhood. 56:956-959. Furthermore, the child's trunk may bend in the same direction as the head, giving the baby an overall curved shape; this complaint is known as tortipelvis.Drigo, P. Carli, G. & Laverda, A.M. (2000) Benign paroxysmal torticollis of infancy. Brain and Development. 22:169-172. In addition to this, the individual may also, but not necessarily, experience vomiting, pallor, ataxia, agitation, infantile migraine, unsteadiness of gait upon learning to walk, general malaise and nystagmus. The periods in which the child's head is tilted and other symptoms appear can last anywhere from a few minutes to a few weeks, with a frequency of anywhere from two per year to two per month.  Causes  The cause of benign paroxysmal torticollis in infants is thought to be migrainous. More than 50% of infants have a family history of migraine in first degree relatives. The cause is likely to be genetic.  Pathophysiology  The mechanism of action of benign paroxysmal torticollis is not yet understood.Eviatar, L. (1994) Benign Paroxysmal Torticollis. Pediatric Neurology. 11:72. It has been suggested that unilateral vestibular dysfunction or vascular disturbance in the brain stem may be responsible for the condition.  Diagnosis  Diagnosis of BPT can be difficult because it is rare.  Treatment  No known treatment for BPT currently exists. However, the condition it is self-limiting and resolves after about eighteen months.  Prognosis  Benign paroxysmal torticollis disappears in the early years of life with no medical intervention. However, some cases of benign paroxysmal torticollis cases can evolve into benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood, migrainous vertigo or typical migraines.

He was captured during the Ottoman conquest of Bosnia in 1463, after which he converted to Islam and became a companion of Mehmed the Conqueror, eventually rising to the post of sanjak-bey.  Childhood  Sigismund was born into the House of Kotromaniƒá, the Bosnian royal dynasty, as the son of King Thomas and his second wife, Queen Catherine. The King notified the authorities of the Republic of Ragusa of the birth of a son in 1449, most likely referring to Sigismund; the Ragusans sent gifts to the parents as well as the infant according to custom. His birth was followed by that of a sister, Catherine. Sigismund also had half-siblings born of the canonically invalid first marriage of his father. Sigismund's maternal family may have been poised to claim the crown for him, but it was nevertheless his older half-brother Stephen who became King of Bosnia following the death of their father in July 1461. Sigismund's maternal grandfather, Stjepan Vukƒçiƒá Kosaƒça, the kingdom's most powerful magnate, realized that Bosnia needed an adult monarch due to the imminent threat of Ottoman conquest, and refrained from pressing Sigismund's claim. Although often said to have resided at the castle of Kozograd above Fojnica with his sister and mother during King Stephen's reign, it seems unlikely that the King would not have wanted his half-siblings at his side, at the royal court in Jajce - especially since Sigismund was probably seen as heir presumptive.  Captivity  The Ottomans invaded Bosnia in May 1463. The royal family apparently intended to confuse and mislead them by splitting and fleeing towards Croatia and the coast in different directions. Sigismund and his sister, separated from their mother, fell captives in the town of Zveƒçaj, near Jajce. The King surrendered in Kljuƒç and was executed shortly afterwards, while Queen Catherine succeeded in escaping to the coast. She left her husband's silver sword in Ragusa and instructed the authorities to hand it over to Sigismund, should he ever be \\"liberated from Turkish captivity\\". Having settled in Rome, she continuously made effort to pay ransom for Sigismund and Catherine. In 1474, Sigismund's mother travelled to the Ottoman border, probably wishing to make contact with her half-brother, Hersekzade Ahmed Pasha, who had converted to Islam and become an Ottoman statesman. The plan failed, however. Sigismund took part in the Battle of Otlukbeli as member of Mehmed's retinue, which saw the Ottoman victory over Uzun Hassan, in 1473. He was notably close to the Sultan. Together they dined and played backgammon, with Sigismund often becoming upset during the game and entertaining Mehmed with his \\"crude jests\\". Around 1475, when the last attempt of his mother to pay ransom for him failed, Sigismund converted from Roman Catholicism to Islam and became known as Ishak Bey the King's Son (). He was certainly Muslim by the time the Ottomans enthroned his cousin Matthias as puppet king of Bosnia, in the spring of 1476, as otherwise he would have been considered for the post. Shortly before her death, in October 1478, Queen Catherine devised a will by which she named Sigismund heir to the Bosnian throne on the condition of converting back to Christianity.  Military career  Ishak Bey served under his uncle Ahmed Pasha and his quick advance in military career continued during the reign of Mehmed's son and successor, Bayezid II. He rose to the post of sanjak-bey of Karasi in Anatolia and took part in the Ottoman‚ÄìMamluk War (1485‚Äì91), fighting first under Hadƒ±m Yakup Pasha and then with his uncle near Adana. Ahmed Pasha and Ishak Bey were defeated and captured by the Mamluk army along with other Ottoman sanjak-beys in 1486. Ishak was freed from Egypt by 17 August 1488, when he participated in another unsuccessful battle against the Mamluks. Having been part of the right flank, which left the battlefield early and contributed to the loss, Ishak Bey was judged and acquitted. Ishak was last mentioned as recounting the events of the Battle of Krbava Field, which took place on 9 September 1493 and in which the Ottoman army was victorious. Ishak Bey was the last known member of the House of Kotromaniƒá.

Centred on the nucleus of musicians William Wilding and Blatt (Nanette Greenblatt), they are best known for their 1980 single, \\"There Goes Concorde Again\\", which attracted the attention of BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel, and reached number five on the UK Independent Charts. The song was listed by New Musical Express in their \\"NME Writers 100 Best Indie Singles Ever\\" in 1992. AllMusic called the Native Hipsters \\"[o]ne of the more bizarre groups\\" from the late-1970s and early-1980s. Biography ...And the Native Hipsters was a London-based duo of musicians William Wilding from Romford England, and Blatt (Nanette Greenblatt) from Cape Town, South Africa. They had previously worked together as the Wildings, and then the Patterns with Robert Cubitt and Tom Fawcett. The Patterns became the Native Hipsters in 1979 when they recorded \\"There Goes Concorde Again\\", a 6:45 minute song featuring Blatt repeating with \\"childlike enthusiasm\\" the refrain \\"Ooh, look, there goes Concorde again\\", with reference to sightings of the famed \\"silverbird\\". AllMusic described the song as a \\"formless composition\\" with \\"perfectly- devoid-of-skill vocals, a wobbly funhouse synth, the occasional guitar pling, and not much bass\\". \\"There Goes Concorde Again\\" was a home recording that was privately released by the group as a single in a limited edition of 500 copies. Each disc had its label hand-stamped by the group, and the sleeves were cut from advertising posters (including one of Kevin Keegan, an English footballer), making each cover virtually unique. They sent the records to Rough Trade, an independent record shop in London, and about a month later BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel picked up a copy and began playing the song extensively on his radio program. Soon the group had an order for another 1,000 copies, and then a further 4,000. The song entered the UK Independent Charts in August 1980, where it remained for ten weeks, peaking at number five. Wilding received an offer from producer Tony Visconti to re-record the song, but turned it down for fear of it becoming \\"too commercial\\". The song was later listed by New Musical Express in their \\"NME Writers 100 Best Indie Singles Ever\\" in 1992. In 1982 the Native Hipsters released a four-track EP, \\"Tenderly Hurt Me\\" which was well received by the music press. Over the next few years the group performed live several times, including opening for Bauhaus, and recorded a number of songs with the help of various musicians, including guitarist Lester Square from The Monochrome Set, and Annie Whitehead, a session trombonist. By the mid-1980s the group had stopped recording, but interest in them was revived in 2001 when Rough Trade included \\"There Goes Concorde Again\\" in a box set, Rough Trade Shops ‚Äì 25 Years. This prompted Wilding to release two CDs, There Goes Concorde Again... (2001) and Songs to Protest About (2006) containing their singles, previously unreleased songs and new material. Interest in the Native Hipsters was renewed again in 2009 when a compilation set, Kats Karavan: The History of John Peel on the Radio included \\"There Goes Concorde Again\\". Rock music critic Peter Paphides said in a review of the album that ...And the Native Hipsters was one of the artists always associated with John Peel.

The Kingdom was founded in 1625 by the Fon people who developed it into a powerful military and commercial empire, which dominated trade with European slave traders on the Slave Coast until the late 19th century, to whom they sold their prisoners of war.Royal Palaces of Abomey, Benin Save Our History The History Channel. Accessed 14 January 2008 At its peak the palaces could accommodate for up to 8000 people. The King's palace included a two-story building known as the \\"cowrie house\\" or akuehue. Under the twelve kings who succeeded from 1625 to 1900, the kingdom established itself as one of the most powerful of the western coast of Africa. UNESCO had inscribed the palaces on the List of World Heritage Sites in Africa. Following this, the site had to be included under the List of World Heritage in Danger since Abomey was hit by a tornado on 15 March 1984, when the royal enclosure and museums, particularly the King Guezo Portico, the Assins Room, King's tomb and Jewel Room were damaged. However, with assistance from several international agencies the restoration and renovation work was completed. Based on the corrective works carried out and reports received on these renovations at Abomey, UNESCO decided to remove the Royal Palaces of Abomey, Benin from the List of World Heritage in Danger, in July 2007. Today, the palaces are no longer inhabited, but those of King Gh√©zo and King Gl√©l√© house the Historical Museum of Abomey, which illustrates the history of the kingdom and its symbolism through a desire for independence, resistance and fight against colonial occupation. History Royal Palaces of Abomey Statue of Behanzin in Abomey The opulent palaces built by the 12 rulers of the kingdom within the cloistered site of Abomey, functioned between 1695 and 1900, as the traditional cultural hub of the empire. The first ruler to initiate the building of palaces was King Houegbadja who had founded the city. According to folklore, the descendants of the royal family of Abomey who built the 12 Royal Palaces of Abomey are the progeny of Princess Aligbonon of Tado and a panther. Their kingdom existed in the southern part of the present day Republic of Benin in Abomey. Recorded history is, however, traced to the 17th century to two of their descendants, namely Do-Aklin and Dakodonou. Houegbadja (1645‚Äì1685) was the king who established the kingdom on the Abomey plateau and set the legal framework for the kingdom's functioning, political role, succession rules and so forth. King Agaja (1718‚Äì1740) defeated the kingdom of Allada in 1724 and the Kingdom of Whydah in 1727. This resulted in killing of several prisoners. Many of the prisoners were also sold as slaves at Ouidah, then called Gl√©w√©. These wars marked the beginning of the dominance of Dahomey's slave trade (which was carried out through the port of Whydah with the Europeans. In the 19th century, however, with the rise of the antislavery movement in Great Britain, King Gu√©zo (1818‚Äì1858) initiated agricultural development in the country, which resulted in further economic prosperity of the kingdom achieved through exports of agricultural products such as corn and palm oil. In 1892-1894, France went to war with Dahomey. Initially, Dahomey won many battles when even the chief of the French army was killed at the battle. King B√©hanzin, the last independent reigning king of was betrayed by his brother rivalry to the throne who exposed the secret to France this was why B√©hanzin set fire to Abomey. The French eventually deported him to Martinique. His successor King Agooli Agbo could rule only till his deportation to Gabon in 1900. In 1960, when the present-day B√©nin attained independence from France, it originally bore the name Dahomey. The official history of the kingdom were recorded and followed through a series of polychrome earthen bas-reliefs. Culture Dahomean culture was deep rooted with intense reverence for the kings of Dahomey and with great religious significance. Each king was symbolised on a \\"common appliqu√©d quilt\\". Ceremonies were part of the culture; with human sacrifice as one of the practice. Traditional architecture =Layout= The town where the palaces were built was surrounded by a mud wall with a circumference estimated at , pierced by six gates, and protected by a ditch deep, filled with a dense growth of prickly acacia, the usual defence of West African strongholds. Within the walls were villages separated by fields, several royal palaces, a market-place and a large square containing the barracks. The average thickness of the walls was about , which maintained cool temperatures inside the palace rooms. Each palace had a distinct design to suit the whims of the kings. The Kpododji through the Honnouwa formed the first interior courtyard of the palace while the second interior courtyard Jalalah√®nnou was by the Logodo. The Ajalala, a unique building, which has many types of openings, is in the second courtyard; the walls have decorations of suggestive images in bas-relief. The palaces of Gl√®l√® and Gu√©zo, which survived the intentional fire of 1894 set by B√©hanzin, were restored and they are now part of the museum. The materials used for construction consisted of earth for the foundations, floors and raised structures. The wood work was made with palm, bamboo, iroko and mahogany species. Roof was made of straw and sheet-metal. =Bas reliefs= The bas reliefs functioned as a record book (in the absence of written documents) to record the significant events in the evolution of the Fon people and their empire, relating the military victories and power of each king and documenting the Fon people's myths, customs and rituals. However, in 1892, in defiance of French occupation, King Behanzin (1889‚Äì1894) ordered that the city and the palaces be burned. Providentially, most monuments survived the fire and many palaces have been since restored. Copper and brass plaques adorned the walls. The bas-reliefs were inlaid in walls and pillars. They were made out of earth from ant-hills mixed with palm oil and dyed with vegetable and mineral pigments. They represent one of the most impressive highlights of the palaces, which are now on display in the museum and replaced by replicas. Many of the objects exhibited in the museum, which were part of the religious ceremonies conducted by the kings in the past, are used even now by the royal family of Dahome in their religious rites. UNESCO recognition In recognition of the unique cultural significance of these monuments, UNESCO inscribed the Royal Palaces of Abomey under the List of World Heritage Sites in 1985 under Culture ‚Äì Criteria IV. The site inscribed consists of two zones namely, the palaces which form the principal zone and the Akaba Palace Zone on the north-northwest part of the site; both zones are enclosed within a partially preserved cob walls. The UNESCO inscription states: \\"From 1625 to 1900 twelve kings succeeded one another at the head of the powerful Kingdom of Abomey. With the exception of King Akaba, who used a separate enclosure, they each had their palaces built within the same cob-wall area, in keeping with previous palaces as regards the use of space and materials. The royal palaces of Abomey are a unique reminder of this vanished kingdom.\\" The Royal Palaces of Abomey were taken off the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger in July 2007. Museum The Abomey Historical Museum is housed in a building built over an area of , which was established in 1943 by the French colonial administration. Its coverage includes all the palaces within an area of , and particularly the palaces of King Gu√©zo and King Gl√®l√®. The museum has 1,050 exhibits, most of these belonged to the kings who ruled Danhom√®. The museum has many exhibits, which fully represent the culture of the Kingdom of Dahomey. Some of the significant exhibits are: appliqu√©d ‚Äúking‚Äù quilt, traditional drums, and paintings of ceremonies and the war between France and Dahomey.  Damages  On 21 January 2009, many of the buildings of the Royal Palaces were destroyed by a bushfire; although it was unknown where the fire had originated. The extent of the flames spread rapidly as a result of the Harmattan winds, and demolished the straw roof and framework of several of the surrounding buildings. Tombs belonging to Kings Agonglo and Ghezo and their wives were also destroyed in the flames. Authorities acted swiftly in a state of emergency to discuss plans to restore the dilapidated buildings. Such plans included the desiccation of water from the structural remains, and fire extinguishing equipment to aid in the prevention of similar incidents. Restoration works were supported by International Organisations, as a request from the Benin Authorities and the World Heritage Centre. Conservation and protection  Extensive conservation work, extensions of buildings and collections have been carried out since 1992. The Italian Cooperation programme has been a generous donor, financing it under the ‚ÄúPREMA-Abomey programme‚Äù. Conservation work and the enhancement of buildings and collections has been implemented since 1992. This work was possible due to funds to an amount of US$450,000 arranged through UNESCO trust. Other donors who also contributed to the work were ICCROM's PREMA programme, the Getty Conservation Institute and Sweden. The bas-reliefs that once decorated the palaces have been restored with special efforts of the Getty Conservation Institute, since 1993; in one palace as many as fifty of the fifty-six bas-reliefs have been conserved with \\"hands-on\\" involvement of the members of the Benin Cultural Heritage staff. Many of the artists employed at the palaces came from the Ou√©m√© area. In August 2007, Republic of Benin adopted Law No. 2007-20 of 23 on the protection of cultural heritage and natural heritage of cultural significance. In 2006, the City of Avomey decreed on an urban and planning regulation, which provides a secure framework for the protection of the site. The site of the Royal Palaces of Abomey has always included sacred spaces that are respected by the royal families and populations. The organisation of ritual ceremonies is another manner of appropriate safeguard.

For Fedlim [O Conchobair] was bidden to build it at his own cost and to take the stones and lime of the spital house of the Trinity for the building, though the Justiciar had previously given that site to Clarus Mag Mailin in honour of the Holy Trinity. But Master John, elected to the bishoprick of Elphin by Clarus, Archdeacon of that see, and by Malachy the Cathedral Dean and Gelasius the Sacristan, proceeded to visit the Lord Pope at Lyons-sur-Rhone, where he was in exile, having been expelled from the Holy See by the Roman Emperor; and he found such favour in the eyes of the Lord Pope and of the papal court that the election of Comarba Comain by the junior canons of the choir of Elphin was quashed, while his own election by the elder clergy, though fewer in number, was honoured, the Lord Pope giving him letters for the Archbishop of Tuaim ordering his consecration as bishop in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord. He was consecrated, and on the day of his consecration the faithful of Christ and seekers to preserve the truth answered: \\"Thanks be to God.\\" * 1247 - Cathal and Toirrdelbach, sons of Aed O Conchobair, made a hosting to help Cathal Mag Ragnaill expel Mac Gosdelb from Feda Conmaicne.

And Toirrdelbach came to Trinity Island to fetch Clarus Mac Mailin, since the Galls had refused to come out of the castle unless the Archdeacon would escort them westwards across the Shannon to Tumna. So they came away with him, and the Clann Gosdelb were expelled from the whole territory. * 1250 - White Canons of the Premonstrant Order were taken shortly before Christmas by Clarus Mac Mailin from Trinity Island in Loch Key to Trinity Island in Loch Oughter in Brefne, and canons of the Order were instituted there by permission of Cathal O Raigillig, who presented the site as an absolute and perpetual alms in honour of the Holy Trinity.

He is the author of several well-known historical novels, including: Boves, el Urogallo (1972), Los Amos del Valle (1979) and La Luna de Fausto (1983). He was the son of Francisco Herrera Guerrero and Mar√≠a Luisa Luque Carvallo. In 1956, he married to Maria Margarita Ter√°n Austria, with whom he had five children. Herrera Luque studied in the Central University of Venezuela (UCV) and later at the University of Salamanca (1952), where he obtained his title of physician. In Madrid he specialized in psychiatry, a field on which he wrote several scientific papers. His PhD thesis served as basis for his book: Los Viajeros de Indias (1961), about the psychopathic loads left on the Venezuelan population by the Spanish conquistadors. His interest in understanding the origins of the personalities of Latin America people took him to the study of heritage and genetics. Herrera Luque founded the department of psychiatry of the UCV, becoming full professor. He was appointed ambassador of Venezuela in Mexico in the mid-1970s. As writer and novelist, his historical work is based on accurate and documented research. His late books: Los Cuatro reyes de la baraja, Bol√≠var en vivo, 1998 and El Vuelo del Alcatraz, were published posthumously. During the final years of his life and after his death his works gained great popularity, making him one of the best-selling writers of Venezuela. His success resulted from the combination of typical Venezuelan stories with historical facts; in his works, Herrera Luque looked beyond the official history of the country and created a parallel narrative to it. Francisco Herrera Luque died in Caracas from a heart attack on 15 April 1991. In 1992 the Francisco Herrera Luque Foundation was created. In 2010 the novel Boves, el Urogallo, was adapted into a film by director Luis Alberto Lamata, with the title of Taita Boves.

The most prominent leaders were Thomas and Alexander Campbell. The group was committed to restoring primitive Christianity. It merged with the Christians (Stone Movement) in 1832 to form what is now described as the American Restoration Movement (also known as the Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement). History Thomas CampbellThe Campbell wing of the American Restoration Movement was launched when Thomas Campbell published the Declaration and Address of the Christian Association of Washington in 1809. The Presbyterian Synod had suspended his ministerial credentials. In The Declaration and Address he set forth some of his convictions about the church of Jesus Christ, as he organized the Christian Association of Washington, in Washington County, Pennsylvania, not as a church but as an association of persons seeking to grow in faith.McAlister, Lester G. and Tucker, William E. (1975), Journey in Faith: A History of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), St. Louis, MO: Chalice Press, On May 4, 1811, the Christian Association constituted itself as a congregationally governed church. With the building it constructed at Brush Run, Pennsylvania, it became known as Brush Run Church. When their study of the New Testament led the reformers to begin to practice baptism by immersion, the nearby Redstone Baptist Association invited Brush Run Church to join with them for the purpose of fellowship. The reformers agreed, provided that they would be \\"allowed to preach and to teach whatever they learned from the Scriptures.\\"Davis, M. M. (1915). How the Disciples Began and Grew, A Short History of the Christian Church, Cincinnati: The Standard Publishing Company Alexander Campbell Thomas' son Alexander immigrated to the US to join him in 1809, and before long assumed the leading role in the movement.C. Leonard Allen and Richard T. Hughes, Discovering Our Roots: The Ancestry of the Churches of Christ, Abilene Christian University Press, 1988, The Campbells worked within the Redstone Baptist Association during the period 1815 through 1824. While both the Campbells and the Baptists shared practices of baptism by immersion and congregational polity, it was soon clear that he and his associates were not traditional Baptists. Within the Redstone Association, some of the Baptist leaders considered the differences intolerable when Alexander Campbell began publishing a journal, The Christian Baptist, which promoted reform. Campbell anticipated the conflict and moved his membership to a congregation of the Mahoning Baptist Association in 1824. Alexander used The Christian Baptist to address what he saw as the key issue of reconstructing the apostolic Christian community in a systematic and rational manner. He wanted to clearly distinguish between essential and non-essential aspects of primitive Christianity. Among what he identified as essential were \\"congregational autonomy, a plurality of elders in each congregation, weekly communion and immersion for the remission of sins.\\" Among practices he rejected as non- essential were \\"the holy kiss, deaconesses, communal living, footwashing and charismatic exercises.\\" Walter Scott In 1827, the Mahoning Association appointed Walter Scott as an evangelist. Through Scott's efforts, the Mahoning Association grew rapidly. In 1828, Thomas Campbell visited several of the congregations formed by Scott and heard him preach. Campbell believed that Scott was bringing an important new dimension to the movement with his approach to evangelism. Several Baptist associations began disassociating congregations that refused to subscribe to the Philadelphia Confession.Philadelphia Confession The Mahoning Association came under attack. In 1830, The Mahoning Baptist Association disbanded. The younger Campbell ceased publication of the Christian Baptist. In January 1831, he began publication of the Millennial Harbinger. Influence of the Enlightenment John Locke by Herman Verelst. The Age of Enlightenment had a significant influence on the Campbell movement. Thomas Campbell was a student of the Enlightenment philosopher John Locke. While he did not explicitly use the term \\"essentials,\\" in the Declaration and Address, Campbell proposed the same solution to religious division as had been advanced earlier by Herbert and Locke: \\"[R]educe religion to a set of essentials upon which all reasonable persons might agree.\\" The essentials he identified were those practices for which the Bible provided \\"a 'Thus saith the Lord,' either in express terms or by approved precedent.\\" Unlike Locke, who saw the earlier efforts by Puritans as inherently divisive, Campbell argued for \\"a complete restoration of apostolic Christianity.\\" Thomas believed that creeds served to divide Christians. He also believed that the Bible was clear enough that anyone could understand it and, thus, creeds were unnecessary.Ron Rhodes, The Complete Guide to Christian Denominations, Harvest House Publishers, 2005, Alexander Campbell was also deeply influenced by Enlightenment thinking, in particular the Scottish School of Common Sense of Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart. This group saw the Bible as providing concrete facts rather than abstract truths, and advocated a scientific or Baconian approach to interpreting the Bible that would begin with those facts, arrange the ones applicable to a given topic, and then use them to draw conclusions. Alexander Campbell reflected this approach, when arguing that \\"the Bible is a book of facts, not of opinions, theories, abstract generalities, nor of verbal definitions.\\" He believed that if Christians would limit themselves to the facts found in the Bible, they would necessarily come to agreement. He saw those facts as providing a blueprint or constitution for the church. Characteristics of the movement Thomas Campbell combined the Enlightenment approach to unity with the Reformed and Puritan traditions of restoration. The Enlightenment affected the Campbell movement in two ways. First, it provided the idea that Christian unity could be achieved by finding a set of essentials that all reasonable people could agree on. The second was the concept of a rational faith that was formulated and defended on the basis of a set of facts derived from the Bible. Alexander Campbell's millennialism was more optimistic than Stone's.Richard Thomas Hughes and R. L. Roberts, The Churches of Christ, 2nd Edition, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2001, , , 345 pages He had more confidence in the potential for human progress and believed that Christians could unite to transform the world and initiate a millennial age. Campbell's conceptions were postmillennial, as he anticipated that the progress of the church and society would lead to an age of peace and righteousness before the return of Christ. This optimistic approach meant that, in addition to his commitment to primitivism, he had a progressive strand in his thinking. Those following the Campbells were called \\"Reforming Baptists\\" because of the associations with the Baptist at the beginning of the movement; this was sometimes shortened to \\"Reformers.\\" (paper), (cloth) \\"Disciples\\" was the name Alexander Campbell preferred. Opponents of the movement nicknamed them \\"Campbellites.\\" Merger with the Christians (Stone Movement) \\"Raccoon\\" John Smith The Campbell movement was characterized by a \\"systematic and rational reconstruction\\" of the early church, in contrast to the Stone movement which was characterized by radical freedom and lack of dogma. Despite their differences, the two movements agreed on several critical issues. Both saw restoring apostolic Christianity as a means of hastening the millennium. Both also saw restoring the early church as a route to Christian freedom. And, both believed that unity among Christians could be achieved by using apostolic Christianity as a model. The commitment of both movements to restoring the early church and to uniting Christians was enough to motivate a union between many in the two movements. The Stone and Campbell movements merged in 1832.Garrison, Winfred Earnest and DeGroot, Alfred T. (1948).

Stone and \\"Raccoon\\" John Smith. Smith had been chosen, by those present, to speak in behalf of the followers of the Campbells. A preliminary meeting of the two groups was held in late December 1831, culminating with the merger on January 1, 1832. Two representatives of those assembled were appointed to carry the news of the union to all the churches: John Rogers, for the Christians and \\"Raccoon\\" John Smith for the reformers. Despite some challenges, the merger succeeded. Many believed the union held great promise for the future success of the combined movement, and greeted the news enthusiastically. With the merger, there was the challenge of what to call the new movement. Clearly, finding a Biblical, non-sectarian name was important. Stone wanted to continue to use the name \\"Christians.\\" Alexander Campbell insisted upon \\"Disciples of Christ\\". As a result, both names were used.Douglas Allen Foster and Anthony L.

Early life and medical career Jos√© Gerson da Cunha was born in Arpora, Bardez on 2 February 1844, the eldest of twelve children to a Goan Catholic couple, Francisco Caetano da Cunha and Leopoldina Maria Gon√ßalves. Francisco was an infantry lieutenant in the Portuguese army stationed in Goa who had taken part in the military campaign against the Marathas at Uspa and Rarim in Savantvadi. The family traced its descent to Balkrishna Shenoy, also known as Balsa Sinai; a 16th-century Goud Saraswat Brahmin from Cortalim in Salcette. Upon his employment by the Portuguese authorities in 1555, Balkrishna moved to Pilerne in Bardez with his two nephews Mangappa and Panduranga Shenoy. There he converted to Christianity and adopted the surname \\"Cunha\\". He later settled down in Arpora. His conversion had been preceded by that of his nephew Mangappa who changed his name to Pero Ribeiro and earned the distinction of being the first Christian of Bardez. Cunha did his primary studies and study of humanities in Panjim. He then moved to Bombay and enrolled in the Grant Medical College to pursue his medical studies. While there, Cunha distinguished himself by winning many prizes. However, he failed to obtain his licentiate in Medicine, and instead obtained the first degree of Licentiate of the University of Bombay in 1864. He moved to London in 1867 to obtain his degree and in the same year, obtained the diplomas of L.R.C.P. Lond. and M.R.C.S Eng. Cunha specialised in obstetrics at Edinburgh and London. He returned to Bombay in 1868, where he soon acquired a large practice. Works Cunha wrote several papers on obstetrics which attracted much attention at the Medico-Physical Society of Bombay. After an epidemic of dengue in the city, he wrote an essay on dengue entitled Dengue: its history, symptoms and treatment. Besides medicine, Cunha's interest spanned across diverse subjects such as history, archaeology, linguistics, numismatics and Sanskritology (study of Sanskrit). He wrote and distinguished himself more by creating works of historical value on these subjects. Besides papers, he was the author of 20 books on these subjects. His decision to write his works in English gained him greater recognition amongst English readers than those Goan authors who had chosen to write on these subjects only in Portuguese. =History= Cunha wrote the first book on the history of Bombay, The Origin of Bombay which was published posthumously by the Bombay branch of the Royal Asiatic Society in 1900. His other best known historical works include Memoir on the history of the tooth-relic of Ceylon; with a preliminary essay on Gautama Buddha The life and system of Gautama Buddha (1875), Historical and Archeological Sketch of the Island of Angediva (1875), and The History and Antiquities of Chaul and Bassein (1876). =Linguistics= Cunha was inspired by the Portuguese civil servant Joaquim Heliodoro da Cunha Rivara's efforts to revive Konkani in Goa. In 1881, he wrote a scholarly work on the language entitled The Konkani Language and Literature, wherein he discussed its origin and issues. Using the arguments of the Language theory, he demonstrated that Konkani was an independent language in its own right with its own dialects, such as Kudali, Goadesi and the Southern. Cunha concluded that while Konkani bears close similarities to Marathi, it is quite distinct from, through cognate with Marathi and has a predominance of Sanskrit words and a faint Turanian or Dravidian element. It possesses an elaborate grammar of its own and a rich vocabulary which is derived from various sources (Sanskrit, Persian, Kannada and Portuguese, with all the contributing elements having lost their autonomy in the course of time and becoming so fused together that only a careful analysis can discover their etymology. Cunha was greatly concerned with the increasing corruption of Konkani's purity, as he felt that the incorporation of Portuguese, Persian, Kannada and Marathi loanwards were distancing the language from its original source, Sanskrit. He further had serious misgivings about the language's future. In The Konkani Language and Literature, he states: =Numismatics= Cunha was an avid coin collector. He began collecting coins in 1876 and in addition to his own collection, purchased the collections of James Gibbs and Bhau Dhaji. By 1888, his personal collection had expanded to include over 27,000 pieces of Gold, Silver and other baser metals. The collection of coins catalogued by Cunha was generally believed to be among the best in the British Empire. This catalogue was published in Bombay in 1888. He wrote a book on numismatics, Indo-Portuguese Numismatics which was published in 1956 by Agencia Geral do Ultramar in Lisbon. This work is generally believed to be one of the few valuable studies in this field. Associations In view of his work, Cunha acquired significant fame as an Orientalist and was invited to International seminars and conferences. In addition to his affiliation with various medical associations in Bombay, his prolific contributions to Indian history and linguistics earned him the fellowship of the Instituto Vasco da Gama in Goa in 1871, and of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bombay in 1873. He received a price at the Congress of Orientalists in Florence in 1877, and was a prominent figure at the Twelfth Congress held in Rome in 1899. In the latter conference, Cunha was hailed by the Count Angelo de Gubernatis as the \\"leading Orientalist of the day\\". He served as the President of the Bombay chapters of the Royal Asiatic Society and the Anthropological Society. He was a Knight of the Order of the Crown of Italy, of the Order of St. Gregory the Great, and of the Order of Saint James of the Sword. Personal life Cunha was married to Ana Rita da Gama, daughter of Ant√≥nio Jos√© da Gama, knight of the Order of the Immaculate Conception of Vila Vi√ßosa, by decree of 5 September 1861, retired chief surgeon of Goa. The couple had three children; which included two daughters and one son. The eminent lawyer, jurist and orientalist Lu√≠s da Cunha Gon√ßalves (1875‚Äì1956) was a nephew of Cunha, through his sister Leoc√°dia Maria Francisca. He was a hyperpolyglot, possessing knowledge of Konkani, Marathi, Portuguese, Italian, French, English, German, Pahlavi, Persian, Latin and Sanskrit.

According to the Travelmania Ireland website, * \\"Clarus Mac Mailin, son of the erenach of Inchmacnerin, who died 1251, founded the monastery of the Premonstratensians (reformed Augustinians), dedicated to the Holy Trinity, in 1215. The ranks of Canons were augmented in 1228 by the defection of monks from the Cistercian Abbey of Boyle, which was seen by the Cistercian Council of that year as having become too gaelicized. The monks brought with them their manuscripts and learning, which, under Clarus' direction, developed eventually into the great manuscripts of the Annals of Lough Key and the Annals of Connacht.\\" In the Annals of Connacht * 1237 - Clarus Mac Mailin began the building of a monastery for Canons on Trinity Island in Loch Oughter, the gift of Cathal O Raigillig. * 1237 - Drommann Iarthair and the land between Lathach Cille Brain and the lake, with wood and plain and bog, was presented to the community of the Trinity on Loch Key and to Clarus Mac Mailin by Donnchad son of Muirchertach Luathsuilech [Mac Diarmata] during the time that he ruled as king; and this was not long, since he reigned only for a month and Cormac reigned again. * 1242 - The hospital of Sligo was presented by the Justiciar to Clarus Mag Mailin, in honour of the Trinity. * 1245 - The castle of Sligo was built by Mac Muiris Fitz Gerald, Justiciar of Ireland, and by the Sil Murray. For Fedlim [O Conchobair] was bidden to build it at his own cost and to take the stones and lime of the spital house of the Trinity for the building, though the Justiciar had previously given that site to Clarus Mag Mailin in honour of the Holy Trinity. But Master John, elected to the bishoprick of Elphin by Clarus, Archdeacon of that see, and by Malachy the Cathedral Dean and Gelasius the Sacristan, proceeded to visit the Lord Pope at Lyons-sur-Rhone, where he was in exile, having been expelled from the Holy See by the Roman Emperor; and he found such favour in the eyes of the Lord Pope and of the papal court that the election of Comarba Comain by the junior canons of the choir of Elphin was quashed, while his own election by the elder clergy, though fewer in number, was honoured, the Lord Pope giving him letters for the Archbishop of Tuaim ordering his consecration as bishop in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord. He was consecrated, and on the day of his consecration the faithful of Christ and seekers to preserve the truth answered: \\"Thanks be to God.\\" * 1247 - Cathal and Toirrdelbach, sons of Aed O Conchobair, made a hosting to help Cathal Mag Ragnaill expel Mac Gosdelb from Feda Conmaicne. They captured the crannog and the lake and broke down the castle of Lecc Derg on the Saturday before Pentecost. And Toirrdelbach came to Trinity Island to fetch Clarus Mac Mailin, since the Galls had refused to come out of the castle unless the Archdeacon would escort them westwards across the Shannon to Tumna. So they came away with him, and the Clann Gosdelb were expelled from the whole territory. * 1250 - White Canons of the Premonstrant Order were taken shortly before Christmas by Clarus Mac Mailin from Trinity Island in Loch Key to Trinity Island in Loch Oughter in Brefne, and canons of the Order were instituted there by permission of Cathal O Raigillig, who presented the site as an absolute and perpetual alms in honour of the Holy Trinity. And Clarus so acted, in the name of God, for this reason‚Äîthat the Premonstratensians enjoy a privilege similar to that of the monks, in that they can pass [from their own] to any other house. * 1251 - Clarus Archdeacon of Elphin, a provident and prudent man, who mortified the flesh with fasting and prayer, who kept the law of patience and his tonsure, who was persecuted by many on account of his righteousness, the revered founder of the houses of the community of the Holy Trinity at Loch Key, where he chose a place of burial for himself, rested in Christ in that same place on the Saturday before Pentecost Sunday; on whose soul may almighty God in Heaven, Whose servant he was in the world, and to the honour of Whom he built the church at Randoon, the monastery of the Holy Trinity in Loch Oughter and the church of the Holy Trinity at Cell Ras, have mercy.

In 1950, she played 21 games mostly as a catcher and hit .161 with 11 runs and nine RBI. She continued her college education, but joined the league at the end of each semester to play ball.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book ‚Äì W. C. Madden.

Smooth at the plate, she was just as splendid in the field, turning in seemingly effortless catches between all three outfield spots. She finished her rookie season with a .205 average (64-for-312), including 11 doubles, one triple and 23 stolen bases, driving in 23 runs while scoring 35 times.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book Moffet opened 1952 with Kalamazoo, but was dealt to the Battle Creek Belles during the midseason, as the league usually switched players as needed to help new teams to be competitive. She posted a combined .238 average in 56 games, while dividing her playing time at first base and the outfield. At the end of four years, Moffet quit the league and remained in New Jersey because her mother was terminally ill. Then, she finished her master's degree at Rutgers University and worked in the education area for more than four decades. Eventually, she became a high school principal at Saddle Brook High School until her retirement in 1994.The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Since 1988 Moffet is part of Women in Baseball, a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League rather than individual baseball personalities. Besides this, in 2002, during the Women's Equality Day, Moffet and fellow AAGPBL player Ernestine Petras were honored by New Jersey Governor Jim McGreevey prior to a Trenton Thunder minor league baseball game at Mercer County Waterfront Park. After the ceremony, Moffet threw out the ceremonial first ball. It's funny, she explained. I worked in education for 42 years, but people remember me best for baseball.

It is one of the most popular techniques for implementing a read-only memory. A diode matrix is used as the control store or microprogram in many early computers. A logically equivalent transistor matrix is still used as the control store or microprogram or 'decode ROM' in many modern microprocessors. At any one instant, a single row of the diode matrix (or transistor matrix) is activated. Charge flows through each diode connected to that row. That activates the column corresponding to each row. The only activated control signals during that instant were those whose corresponding column wire was connected with a diode to that row.  History  A diode matrix ROM was used in many computers in the 1960s and 70s, as well as electronic desk calculators and keyboard matrix circuits for computer terminals. A keyboard matrix circuit has a very similar grid of diodes, but is used differently. The microsequencer of many early computers, perhaps starting with the Whirlwind I, simply activated each row of the diode matrix in sequence, and after the last row was activated, started over again with the first row. The technique of microprogramming as first described by Maurice Wilkes in terms of a second diode matrix added to a diode matrix control store.Mark Smotherman, \\"A Brief History of Microprogramming\\", 1999. cs.clemson.edu, staff.ncl.ac.uk Later computers used a variety of alternative implementations of the control store, but eventually returned to a diode matrix or transistor matrix. A person would microprogram the control store on such early computers by manually attaching diodes to selected intersections of the word lines and bit lines. In schematic diagrams, the word lines are usually horizontal and the bit lines are usually vertical. The control store on some minicomputers was one or more programmable logic array chips. The \\"blank\\" PLA from the chip manufacturer came with a diode matrix or transistor matrix with a diode (or transistor) at every intersection. A person would microprogram the control store on these computers by destroying the unwanted connections at selected intersections. Some modern microprocessors and ASICs use a diode matrix or transistor matrix control store. Typically a blank grid is designed with a diode (or transistor) at every intersection, and then a mask is prepared that leaves out the unwanted connections at selected intersections. When reverse engineering integrated circuits that include such a mask-programmed decode ROM, one of the key steps is to take photographs of that ROM with enough resolution to separate each intersection site and enough color depth to distinguish between the \\"connected\\" and \\"not connected\\" intersections.visual6502.orgcl.cam.ac.uk Since the control store is in the critical path of computer execution, a fast control store is an important part of a fast computer. For a while the control store was many times faster than program memory, allowing a long, complicated sequence of steps through the control store per instruction fetch, leading to what is now called complex instruction set computing. Later techniques for fast instruction cache sped that cache up to the point that the control store was only a few times faster than instruction cache, leading to fewer and eventually only one step through the control store per instruction fetch in reduced instruction set computing.

Williams itself was decided under analogous rules found in the Civil Aviation (Working Time) Regulations 2004. It held that variable components in pay, such as bonuses, must be included in the amount of pay people receive while they are on holiday.E McGaughey, A Casebook on Labour Law (Hart 2019) ch 6, 286 Facts Williams, and other pilots who worked for British Airways claimed that their holiday pay was too low, because it only reflected his fixed salary, and not his bonuses. Williams' comprised a fixed annual salary, a \\"flying pay supplement\\" that went up the more he flew, and a \\"time away from base\\" which went up the more he was away from home. The flying and time away allowances were capped. Properly construed, his contract suggested that his holiday pay would be at the rate of only his fixed salary. Williams, however, contended that this was contrary to the Civil Aviation Working Time Directive, as implemented by the Civil Aviation (Working Time) Regulations 2004, (sector- specific implementations with the same objective as the Working Time Directive and the Working Time Regulations 1998 in this respect). In absence of particular provisions, the pay while on leave should be \\"normal remuneration\\". British Airways contended that because the Employment Rights Act 1996 sections 221 to 224 did not have provisions on how to determine a week's pay, the rate should be determined with reference to the contract. Under the Civil Aviation (Working Time) Regulations 2004, which enacted the European directive 2000/79/EC, airline crew are entitled to a minimum of four weeks 'paid annual leave'. Under UK law, this meant that airline crew were in general entitled to 'normal or comparable pay' whilst on leave. BA crew were paid a basic fixed wage, but they also received additional payment in the form of a 'Flying Pay Supplement' and a 'Time Away from Base Allowance'. During periods of statutory leave, staff, including the appellants, were paid according to their basic wage, without any allowance for time that they would have spent flying, or away from base, had they been working according to their usual patterns. A case was brought in the Employment Tribunals by approximately 2,750 BA pilots, who argued that the 'normal pay' condition under UK law meant that BA were obliged to pay them as though they had spent time away from base and on flights during their annual leave. Their claim was successful in both the Employment Tribunal and Employment Appeals Tribunal. Judgment =Court of Appeal= The Court of Appeal found for BA, holding that whilst European Directives set out a broad principle that employees were entitled to four weeks leave at a rate of pay which was comparable to their regular pay, BA were not in breach of any domestic statutory obligations by failing to pay employees exactly what they would have earned had they worked through their holiday. =Supreme Court= The Supreme Court declined to address the issues presented by the case and instead opted to refer a series of questions to the European Court of Justice regarding the Directives and the issues raised in the appeal. The certified questions asked: #to what extent the process of defining 'normal or comparable pay' fell within EU and/or domestic law, #whether it was sufficient that the level of pay agreed between employers and employees did not dissuade employees from taking their annual leave, #was it a requirement that employees were paid either (a) precisely their 'normal' pay or (b) at a comparable level to their 'normal' pay, or was neither option explicitly required by EU law, #assuming one of the options suggested by question 3 was correct, what period of time is relevant in determining a worker's 'normal' pay, #assuming one of the options suggested by question 3 was correct, what approach should be taken when a level of pay is dependent on a worker's level of engagement in particular activities (i.e. flying), what approach should be taken when a statutory limit to the amount of engagement a worker is permitted to undertake would have been breached had the worker actually carried it out. =European Court of Justice= The European Court of Justice subsequently ruled in 2011 that all pay components which relate to the personal and professional status of an airline pilot must be maintained during that worker's paid annual leave, and it was up to the national court to assess that the criteria have been met. The UKSC then ruled in 2012 that the claims were to be remitted back to the employment tribunal for further consideration of the appropriate payments to be made to the pilots in respect of the periods of paid annual leave in issue.

Recorded on May 15, 1981, it was released as a single, and reached No. 8 in Norway. A live version of the composition was released on Biograph in 1985. Artists who have covered the song include Norah Jones, Mountain, Steve Gibbons, Blake Mills, Maria Muldaur, and Ulf Lundell. Recording The music of \\"Heart of Mine\\" has been described as having a \\"loose, garagey\\" feel encompassing a \\"vaguely Latin/Caribbean vibe\\", and featuring \\"loosey-goosey piano\\" by Dylan. Dylan's piano playing has also been described as \\"honky- tonk\\".

The B-side was \\"Let It Be Me\\", written by M. Curtis, P. Delanoe, and G. Becaud. Dylan had released a different version of the song on his 1970 album Self Portrait, but the non-album B-side of \\"Heart of Mine\\" was newly recorded during the Shot of Love sessions. As a single, \\"Heart of Mine\\" reached No. 8 in Norway, and spent six weeks in the Norwegian Top 10. \\"Heart of Mine\\" was released on Shot of Love in August 1981. In the United States, the single was released in September 1981, with \\"The Groom's Still Waiting at the Altar\\" as the B-side. \\"The Groom's Still Waiting at the Altar\\" originally did not appear on the Shot of Love album; it first appeared on Biograph in 1985, but was later added to subsequent releases of Shot of Love. Also on Biograph, Dylan included a live version of \\"Heart of Mine\\", recorded on November 10, 1981, in New Orleans, Louisiana. Reception Writer Jeff Perkins describes \\"Heart of Mine\\" as a highlight of Shot of Love. Critic Sean Egan calls the song \\"sweet and vulnerable\\", but considers the live version on Biograph \\"immediately superior\\", due to the \\"suffocatingly bad production\\" on Shot of Love. Bill Janovitz of Allmusic considers the Shot of Love version to have a \\"good feel\\", characteristic of the \\"warm and natural\\" sound of the album as a whole, and describes the lyrics as \\"clever\\". Clinton Heylin, by contrast, writes that \\"the song... rambles from clich√© to clich√©\\", giving the examples of \\"If you can't do the time, don't do the crime\\" and \\"Give her an inch and she'll take a mile\\". Heylin describes the take used on Shot of Love as \\"half-assed\\" and \\"ill-conceived\\"; he believes Dylan should have instead released a version recorded in April 1981 that is \\"more engaging\\" and \\"pop-friendly\\". Covers Norah Jones and Peter Malick recorded the song for their 2003 album New York City and which featured in the 2003 film Runaway Jury being used in the closing credits.

Early years  Custer was born Raymond Glenn in Kentucky's capital city, Frankfort, and graduated from the University of Kentucky with a degree in engineering.  Career  Using his original name Raymond Glenn, Custer appeared in non-Western films, including The Return of Boston Blackie (1927) as the title character. He was billed as Bob Custer for Western films, beginning in 1924 when he worked for Films Booking Office. In 1927, he formed Bob Custer Production, and from 1928 through 1931 he acted in 20 Westerns for Syndicate. After he left acting, he became a building inspector in Redondo Beach and El Segundo, California. He eventually became chief building inspector in the nearby seaside city of Newport Beach.  Personal life and death  On November 23, 1926, Custer married Anne Elizabeth Cudahy, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. J. P. Cudahy and a member of the Cudahy Packing Company family.

He then continued with his doctoral studies, culminating in a PhD in neuroscience (1994).\\"Made at the Institute: Blending Art and Science,\\" Interface Magazine, Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel, Spring-Summer, 2008 During his time at the Weizmann Institute, his research focused on the visual brain. With his advisor, Professor Dov Sagi, he was able to resolve a 30-year-old scientific dilemma, which tried to understand how the human visual system is able to effortlessly discriminate between different types of visual textures, such as tree bark. They published their findings in the Optical Society of America (1990).Barton S Rubenstein and Dov Sagi, \\"Spatial variability as a limiting factor in texture-discrimination tasks: implications for performance asymmetries,\\" Journal of the Optical Society of America A, Vol 7, pp 1632-1643, (1990). Another accomplishment of his laboratory was elucidating the learning process in the brain. It was determined that after practicing a visual task, a consolidation period of at least six hours was needed before any improvement occurs. The expressions, \\"cramming before a test will not be of any benefit\\" and \\"sleeping on it\\" are adages that are supported by this research. To further this research, Rubenstein and colleagues wondered whether a certain stage of sleep was responsible for this consolidation. Their findings, reported in the Journal of Science (1994),A Karni, D Tanne, BS Rubenstein, JJ Askenasy, and D Sagi, \\"Dependence on REM Sleep of Overnight Improvement of a Perceptual Skill,\\" Science, Vol 265, pp.679-682 (1994). show conclusively that the consolidation of visually learned tasks occurs during the dream stage (REM). These findings began a resurgence in the study of sleep.

He enrolled at the Corcoran College of Art and Design for a semester to learn the techniques of welding, mold making, and the lost wax process. He created a body of sculptures incorporating water. These water sculptures launched him into the art world (1994), beginning a cascade of exhibitions and commissions in the United States and internationally. His work, primarily of stainless steel and bronze, is human scale and monumental in size. One of his works, Ray of Light, won an arts competition in Redwood City, California and also serves as a bird bath. In addition to his water sculptures, Rubenstein also creates wind kinetic sculpture. These sculptures use a novel design, invented by the artist, which creates a slow back-and- forth movement in his art.www.RubensteinStudios.com This movement has a dance- like quality and has been likened to the waltz. Rubenstein also creates what he calls \\"sculpture in suspension,\\" which juxtaposes sculptural elements so they appear to be swooping across space and \\"ignoring gravity.\\" Among the modernist sculptors who have influenced Rubenstein are George Rickey and Henry Moore.

The design progressed as far as making mock-ups of the cockpit area and wind-tunnel models of the overall layout. After studying the design, Douglas concluded that the SST would not work economically, and declined to enter the Model 2229 in the National Supersonic Transport (NST) program in 1963. Development =Background= Through the 1950s, understanding of supersonic aerodynamics had improved to the point where sustained operation at high Mach was first becoming possible. A combination of new engines, engine intakes, new planforms like the delta wing, and new materials like titanium and stainless steel had solved many of the problems of earlier designs. By the late 1950s, the United States was in the midst of building two supercruising aircraft, the Lockheed A-12 and B-70 Valkyrie, and the UK was considering the Avro 730. The concept of a supersonic transport seemed like a natural evolution of existing designs, which had long striven for \\"higher, faster\\". However, at supersonic speeds, lift works in a very different way that subsonic, and always less efficient. Subsonic transports of the era were reaching lift-to-drag ratios of about 19, whereas even the most advanced wing designs for SSTs were around 9.Joseph Chambers, \\"Innovation in Flight\\", NASA SP-2005-4539, 2005, p. 9. This was not a concern for military aircraft, where speed was life, but an SST would require twice as much fuel to move a passenger, increasing operational costs. To offset the operational costs, proponents of the SST concept suggested the lower trip times would command higher ticket prices. This would make them attractive to a segment of the market that currently paid higher ticket prices for first class seats. In theory, the faster trip times would also allow a reduction in costs needed to fly a given number of passengers, as fewer aircraft would be needed to cover a given route. By 1960, several companies had shown models or mock- ups of SST designs, but most of these were trial balloons with no serious study behind them. But in an era when progress generally meant faster, there was a widespread feeling that the SST was the next natural step in aircraft design. =Douglas Model 2229= Like other companies, Douglas had been considering the SST concept since the late 1950s.After Invariably they were unimpressed with the results. In one case, the only room to be found for the required fuel load was in the fuselage, prompting one designer to sketch a cartoon showing the passengers sitting in diving suits immersed in the fuel under large signs saying \\"No Smoking!\\"Conway, p. 85. But as the market turned to the SST idea, Douglas started the 2229 project. This was one of the first serious efforts to be shown to the press. The 2229 broadly followed the layout introduced in the B-70, although it used the compound delta layout. The B-70 had a shoulder-mounted wing to best use compression lift generated by the nose and engine intakes, but this was not suitable for a transport where the fuselage is best situated above the wing for better visibility and easier loading. The wing stretched from the single vertical rudder at the rear almost to the front of the fuselage, where two much smaller delta canards were mounted high on the fuselage. The four engines were situated in an 80 foot long box under the wing, like the B-70. Douglas' design differed in using two shock cones at the front of the intake, rather than the large splitter in the B-70. This led into a single large duct with three-part variable-profile walls that slowed the intake air to subsonic speeds. Behind this were separate ducts leading to the engines. The landing gear folded into the space beside the duct. Other features were taken directly from the B-70. At high speeds the outer 20 feet of each wing folded down to improve compression lift, although to a much lower angle than the B-70's 75-degree droop. The nose area used the rising ramp from the B-70, as opposed to the drooping nose of the Concorde or Boeing 2707. =National Supersonic Transport= By early 1963 a number of forces were gathering to propel Bristol and Sud Aviation to consider merging features of their designs into a joint effort. Caught by patriotic pride, especially the support of Charles de Gaulle,Conway, p. 76. these meetings gathered steam. By mid-1963 it was becoming clear that these efforts were likely to reach an agreement. Around the same time, it became known that the Soviet Union had started development of their own SST design.Conway, p. 116. This set off something of a panic in the US. Although their estimates and financial predictions continuously demonstrated very poor operating economics,Conway, p. 82-84 political considerations overturned these concerns. By the spring of 1963 the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was well into the process of defining an SST development program, and the private announcement in May that Pan American Airlines had placed options on the Concorde overrode any remaining concerns.Conway, p. 78. The SST program was announced on 5 June 1963. =Douglas declines= By this point the Model 2229 effort had progressed to detail design. The 100-passenger aircraft had settled at about 420,000 lb, heavier than the Boeing 707 while holding 20% fewer passengers. As the operational costs of an aircraft are roughly defined by the aircraft fuel use, a function of weight, divided by the number of passengers, these numbers were not encouraging. The marketing department was no more impressed; examining a report by the Stanford Research Institute (SRI), they found that SRI had calculated a market for 325 aircraft based on the assumption that every route over 1000 miles would use an SST. Their own assumption was that only routes with high utilization would use them, leading to a market of only 151 aircraft. Considering that Douglas had yet to turn a profit on the DC-8 in spite of sales of over 200 aircraft, they were highly skeptical that there was any profit to be had.Conway, p. 86 On 26 August, Donald Douglas Jr. wrote a letter to the head of the FAA, Najeeb Halaby, saying that they would not be entering the 2229 into the NST program. In the letter, Douglas stated their main reasons were the problems involved in introducing new models of the DC-8 and DC-9, along with various military commitments, which left them struggling for development resources. In spite of Douglas' letter glossing over their serious concerns, the press still felt their withdrawal from the program was serious. The New York Times reported that it was an example of \\"widespread industry caution\\" about the program. By this point, however, the program was well entrenched and led to the selection of the Boeing 2707 for the NST program.

Redrawn from Toga & Thompson. Mapping brain asymmetry. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 4, 37‚Äì48 (2003). DOI 10.1038/nrn1009. Yakovlevian torque (also known as occipital bending (OB) or counterclockwise brain torque) is the tendency of the right side of the human brain to be warped slightly forward relative to the left and the left side of the human brain to be warped slightly backward relative to the right. This is responsible for certain asymmetries, such as how the lateral sulcus of the human brain is often longer and less curved on the left side of the brain relative to the right. Stated in another way, Yakovlevian Torque can be defined by the existence of right-frontal and left-occipital petalias, which are protrusions of the surface of one hemisphere relative to the other. It is named for Paul Ivan Yakovlev (1894-1983), a Russian-American neuroanatomist from Harvard Medical School.Carter, Rita, The Human Brain Book, p. 57, , Dorling Kindersley Limited, 2009 Effects =Handedness= A 2012 literature review showed that morphometry studies had consistently found that handedness-related effects corresponded to the extent of the Yakovlevian Torque; increased torque, as measured by increased size of the right-frontal petalia and the left-occipital petalia, tends to be more common in right- handed individuals. Individuals with mixed-handedness or left-handedness show reduced levels of Yakovlevian torque. =Developmental stuttering= Reduced right-frontal and left-occipital petalias and reversed petalia asymmetries (that is, left-frontal and right occipital petalias) have been associated with developmental stuttering in both adults and pre-adolescent boys. This may be tied to the lateral sulcus housing Broca's area, which plays a significant role in production of language. =Bipolar disorder= Increased size of the left-occipital petalia, resulting from an abnormally high degree of Yakovlevian torque has been associated with bipolar disorder. Maller et al. 2015 found that increased asymmetry of the occipital lobe, or occipital bending, was four times more prevalent in subjects with bipolar disorder than in healthy controls. This applied both to patients with bipolar disorder type I and type II. Presence in primates Yakovlevian torque is found in modern humans and fossil hominids, appearing reliably as early as Homo erectus. The patterning of petalias in extinct human ancestors is examined via endocasts, wherein a cast is made of the cranial vault: the asymmetries of human ancestors can be measured from these casts because petalias leave impressions inside the cranial vault. Some authors have reported that similar petalia patterns are found in a number of primates including Old World monkeys, New World monkeys and Great apes, but others report different protrusions; these differences seem to be tied to which techniques are used to measure the petalia, so it is not well-understood if all primates demonstrate Yakovlevian torque.

Australia In Australia, a voter anonymously registered is known as a silent elector. To be a silent elector, a voter must satisfy the Divisional Returning Officer that their safety or that of any other person living in the same household would be at risk if their name and address were printed in the electoral register. Application for silent status occurs through an online form on the Australian Electoral Commission website or by uploading a scanned paper form. Silent electors may register as a general postal voter so that their ballot papers are automatically mailed to them when an election or referendum is called. Otherwise, silent electors are able to vote via the same options as the rest of the population, either by attending a polling place on polling day or a pre-poll in the lead up to an election, or applying for a one-off postal vote. New Zealand An eligible elector who believes that having their details entered on the publicly viewable electoral roll could threaten their personal safety or that of their family can apply for their details be included only on the unpublished roll. The application must be accompanied by evidence, such as a copy of a protection order that is in force under the Domestic Violence Act 1995, a copy of a restraining order that is in force under the Harassment Act 1997, a statutory declaration from a member of the New Zealand Police, or a letter from either a barrister or solicitor, the employer, a justice of the peace, or the like, supporting the application on the grounds that the applicant's personal safety, or that of their family, could be prejudiced by the publication of their name and details. An elector remains on the unpublished roll until such time as their circumstances change. As unpublished rolls are not made available at polling booths, voters on the unpublished roll must cast a special vote. United Kingdom A person who qualifies to register to vote can be registered anonymously if they can satisfy the electoral registration officer that their safety or that of any other person living in the same household would be at risk if their name and address were printed in the electoral register. A voter can apply to be an anonymous elector at any time by using registration forms available from local electoral registration officers or the Electoral Commission's website. The applicant must state a reason about why they or someone else in the same household would be at risk should their name and address be publicly available in the electoral register. In addition, the application must be supported either by a court order or an attestation. Attestations can be made by a police officer of or above the rank of superintendent of any UK police force, the Director General of the Security Service or the National Crime Agency, a director of adult social services or children‚Äôs services in England, a director of social services in Wales, any chief social work officer in Scotland or any director of social services of a Health and Social Services Board or executive director of social work of a Health and Social Services Trust in Northern Ireland. Application forms can be returned to the local electoral registration officer by post, by fax or by e-mail as a scanned attachment.Representation of the People Regulations 2001, Regulation 6 (also, Regulation 31I(2) states that copies ‚Äì rather than the original ‚Äì of the court order/attestation is acceptable as evidence) Once the anonymous elector application has been accepted by the electoral registration officer, the applicant's entry in the Electoral Register appears as an elector number and the letter N, rather than their name and address. Only the returning officer, the jury service in England and Wales, the security services and police forces have access to the name and address of anonymous electors. A 'certificate of anonymous registration' is then issued to the anonymous elector in case they need to prove their identity and address in order to obtain credit or to donate money or loan money to a political party/candidate (but as this involves handing over name and address details to a third party, the anonymous elector should only do this if they are absolutely confident that the other party will keep the information secure). The anonymous elector application lasts twelve months, after which it must be renewed. To vote in person, an anonymous elector must take the poll card received in the post.

This includes creating a false address, and can applies to different government departments depending on the state.https://portal.ct.gov/SOTS/Business- Services/ACP/Address-Confidentiality-Program All states except Arkansas apply their Confidential Address Programs to voter registration.

The purpose-built hotel opened in 1868 as the Crieff Hydropathic Establishment, and is locally known as the Hydro. It was founded in 1868 by Dr Thomas Henry Meikle, who had received treatment at a centre in Gr√§fenberg, Austria (now known as L√°znƒõ Jesen√≠k, Czech Republic), where Vincenz Priessnitz had built such an establishment. Preissnitz based his pharmacopeia on water, exercise, fresh mountain air, water treatments in the brooks and simple country food. History In 1857, Dr Meikle, a recent medical graduate from the University of Edinburgh, observed Priessnitz's work and whilst being personally disparaging of him for his non-medical background, took back some of his principles for his new hydropathic establishment in Aberdeen, Scotland. When Priessnitz came to Britain on a visit promoted by the publications of Captain R. T. Claridge, a prominent booster of his methods, The Lancet was particularly scathing about his work, describing him as a charlatan and a fraud. However, Dr James Manby Gully, also an Edinburgh medical graduate, picked up on the \\"water cure\\", his most famous patient being Charles Darwin, who attended Gully's establishment in Malvern, Worcestershire. Built in the second wave of such establishments in the UK in the latter part of the 19th century, Crieff Hydro utilised the Caledonian Railway to bring a prosperous, sober clientele from the lowlands of Scotland to take the cure in upmarket conditions. The architect of the original Scots-Jacobean style building, built at a cost of ¬£30,000, was Robert Ewan, but the original building was extended in the later heyday of hydropathic spas in 1893‚Äì94. It was successful from the start and, from a stable of 20 such establishments across Scotland at the peak, is one of only two left, the other being Peebles Hydro in Peebles in similar upland surroundings. Priessnitz considered mountain scenery an essential background to his Nature Cure. By 1874, as medical superintendent, Dr Meikle was drawing a salary of ¬£500 per annum, receiving dividends on his investment at the maximum of 7% and getting an extraordinary ¬£279 as an ex gratia payment. It was rather self-contained, farming its own estate until recently, and possessing its own hydroelectricity station, fed from Loch Turret until 1968, (now part of the seven-station Breadalbane hydroelectric scheme) and its own laundry. The company still has only 160 shareholders. During the Second World War, the government took over the Hydro, and Free Polish forces were billeted there, to the chagrin of some of the residents of the town, who felt scarce food supplies were being diverted to the Poles' exclusive use. It has been a Category B listed building since 1971. =Regime= The principles of the establishment were decidedly firm and of a Protestant religious character (notably the United Presbyterians and the Evangelical Union favoured the establishment), with a fine of one penny being levied for those who missed grace before meals. It still has a large room, used for worship services, with a full-size organ. The establishment was teetotal until 1994 when the first bar was placed within the Highlandman Room - Today the hotel has several bars including The Meikle, The Hub and The Brasserie that have adjoining eateries. It is run by the great, great, great, grand nephew of the original founder and medical superintendent. It became a favourite destination for alcoholics to dry-out. It offered and continues to offer cheap rates for Church of Scotland ministers out of season, though they are not required now to lead daily prayers. Smoking was also disapproved of, though not banned, a small and obscure room being set aside for smokers' use. Today The hotel operates as a 4/5* resort with over 200 bedrooms, over 50 self-catering properties and a dozen meeting rooms for conferences. The main restaurant, a Victorian dining room, is named after the founder. The hotel has over 60 facilities for indoor and outdoor pursuits such as a golf course, riding stables, a gym, swimming pools, 5-a-side football pitches and, basketball, badminton and squash courts. In 2006 the Resort opened BIG Country, a registered childcare facility offering free childcare to over 100 children of resort guests simultaneously. It is run by Stephen Leckie, the great-great-great-grand nephew of the founder. In February 2014, Crieff Hydro announced it would start operating five other hotels in Scotland and one in Harrogate. These included Peebles Hydro, the Park Hotel in Peebles, the Ballachulish Hotel, the Isles of Glencoe Hotel and Leisure Centre, the Oban Caledonian Hotel and the Yorkshire Hotel.

It presents as a reddening of the eye due to the infection of the conjunctiva. The conjunctiva is the thin transparent tissue that covers the eye from the Corneal limbusCorneal limbus to the lid margin. Many conditions can lead to the inflammation of the conjunctiva. They include allergies, bacterial infection, viral infection etc. A common form of the condition that occurs every rainy season is the seasonal conjunctivitis popularly referred to as \\"Apollo\\" by West Africans because the reports of its first epidermic in Accra coincided with the Apollo 11 moon landing.REISAKU KONO; APOLLO 11 DISEASE OR ACUTE HEMORRHAGIC CONJUNCTIVITIS: A PANDEMIC OF A NEW ENTEROVIRUS INFECTION OF THE EYES, American Journal of Epidemiology, Volume 101, Issue 5, 1 May 1975, Pages 383‚Äì390, https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a112106 Every year prior to the rainy season in the country, various health warnings are given to remind citizens of the condition.http://www.ghananewsagency.org/s_health/r_27342/health/ophthalmological- society-of-ghana-warns-public-on-apollo-outbreak Signs of the disease Acute Haemmorrhagic Conjunctivitis is normally recognized by the affected individual upon waking. The eyelids stick together requiring great effort in separating them. Intense whitish mucopurulent discharge is observed throughout the day with the eye having a reddish hue. There is pain which is worse upon looking up or at light. Other symptoms include sore eyes, feeling of grittiness or burning, redness, watery discharge, swelling of eyelids. Infection rate AHC has a very fast rate of infection. Upon affecting one eye, the condition is known to infect the other eye in a short while (maximum three days). As an infected person goes around his house or work, the conditions spreads. This is because the things that the individual touches normally become sources of infection. As such it is advised that once infected, the individual should keep a high level of hygiene so that the rate of infection can be regulated. Effect on the Visual system Once the infection start, there are a lot of effects that the infected individual would have. They include: *Inability to do near work comfortably *Blurry vision due to the discharge *Covering of the eyes with the palm to limit the amount of light entering it *Eye discomfort due to the false feeling of foreign body (sand) on the eye Prognosis The forecast of the disease in terms of its resolution is very good. Though self limiting the condition can resolve faster if antibiotics are administered onto the eye. Topical doses of most ophthalmic medication are effective in treating the condition. Public health issue AHC is of an annual occurrence which affects hundreds of thousands of people in Ghana every year. Because of the ease of spread - from person to person, it requires prompt treatment. This causes a major health challenge to health workers especially ophthalmologist and optometrist as the large number of cases require various treatments tailored to address the condition. Once an individual is affected, he or she is advised to stay away from crowded areas etc. to limit the person to person infection. The temporal change in activities of the infected individual leads to decrease productivity and visual function. The effect of this has a telling implication on both the infected individual and those around him or her. It is for these reasons that the ministry of health of Ghana considers the education and prompt treatment of those with the condition a vital tool in increased productivity across all field of the national development especially prior to the rainy season.

However, not all exiled Tibetans are content with pursuing the current CTA policy of the Middle Way Approach and many expressed their frustration in 2008, against the Dalai Lama's wishes, by agitating for independence. With the 14th Dalai Lama announcing his retirement from political life just before the April 2011 elections for Prime Minister or Sikyong, who will henceforth be Tibet's political leader, the nature of resistance may be moving into yet another phase, although the three leading candidates currently favor the Middle Way Approach.\\"Investigating The Candidates On The Middle Way\\" Tibetan Political Review March 15, 2011 accessed April 15, 2011 Background Isolated geography has naturally defined Tibet as a unique entity, however, its governance and political status have been in flux for centuries. The minor kingdoms and tribal states of the region were first united under Songtsen Gampo to form the Tibetan Empire in the seventh century CE Under the influence of his Chinese bride and first Nepali wife Bhrikuti, the Emperor converted to Buddhism and established it as the religion of Tibet. An influx of Chinese culture, the Indian alphabet, and Buddhist monks followed, combining with the native customs and animistic religion B√∂n to give birth to what has become today's ethnic Tibetan people and Tibetan Buddhism, also known as Lamaism,Hutheesing, Raja (1960).

ASIN: B000JOE01W Thubten Gyatso, the 13th Dalai Lama photographed in Calcutta in 1910 who declared Independence of Tibet in 1913 by written proclamationleft334x334px After the break-up of the Tibetan Empire in the mid-9th century, central rule was largely nonexistent over the region for 400 years. But Buddhism survived and when the Mongols conquered the region, Buddhism was adopted as the official religion of their empire. In 1271, Kublai Khan established the Yuan Dynasty and Tibet remained a semi- autonomous entity within it. From the second half of the 14th century until the early 17th, Tibet was ruled by competing Buddhist schools. However, it was during this period that the Gelug order was founded in 1409 and the institution of the Dalai Lama was established in 1569 with the priest-patron relationship between the Altan Khan and the 3rd Dalai Lama (the first two were bestowed the title retroactively). The Dalai Lamas are said to be the reincarnates of the Bodhisattva of Compassion, Avalokite≈õvara. It was when the 5th Dalai Lama Ngawang Lobsang Gyatso succeeded in establishing the Ganden Phodrang government and Gelug supremacy in Tibet, with the help of the G√ºshi Khan of the Khoshut Khanate, that the post took on the dual role of political and religious leadership (however, the 9th‚Äì12th Dalai Lamas died before adulthood). After Lobsang Gyatso's mortal passing in 1682, which was kept a secret for 15 years, there was a period of anarchy and invasions that eventually led to the establishment of Qing protectorate over Tibet in 1720 that would reach its peak in the 1790s in response to attacks by Nepal, be renewed in 1903 when the British invaded, and would last until 1912.Stein, Rolf Alfred (1972). Tibetan Civilization. Stanford University Press. Chambers' Encyclopedia, Pergamon Press, New York, 1967, p. 637 Tibet became independent with the demise of the Manchu Qing dynasty and would remain so until 1950. Early resistance In his essay Hidden Tibet: History of Independence and Occupation published by the Library of Tibetan Works and Archives at Dharamsala, S.L. Kuzmin, quoting the memoirs of Soviet diplomat A. M. Ledovsky, claims that on January 22, 1950, during his negotiations with Joseph Stalin in Moscow, Mao Zedong asked him to provide an aviation regiment because he was preparing to advance towards Tibet. Stalin approved these preparations and provided military support with Soviet pilots and airfield personnel dressed in Chinese clothes, because this aid was illegal.Kuzmin, S.L. Hidden Tibet: History of Independence and Occupation. Dharamsala, LTWA, 2011, pp. 165‚Äì166. In 1950, the People's Liberation Army of the People's Republic of China (PRC) entered Tibet and the US government made contact with the Dalai Lama's brother Gyalo Thondup, who was living in India, to offer US help, which was rejected. In May 1951, a delegation representing the Dalai Lama, 15 years old at the time, and led by Ngapoi Ngawang Jigmei, traveled to Beijing to be presented with the Seventeen Point Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, which established a PRC sovereignty over Tibet: assuming responsibility for Tibet's external affairs while leaving the domestic governance to the Lhasa government and assuring religious freedoms. The treaty was signed by the Lhasa delegation and the 10th Panchen Lama, who had already switched his loyalty to the PRC after flirting with the Kuomintang and conspiring against the central Tibetan government, which still refused to recognize him as the true Panchen Llama. Later there would be much controversy over the validity of the agreement stemming from claims it was signed under threat of arms and disagreements about whether the delegates had the authority to sign. But at the time, in Lhasa, the Kutra aristocrats mingled with Chinese officials and prospered from this association. Mixed parties were thrown throughout the year and even by the Dalai Lama himself. The burden on farmers and peasants of supplying the troops with food led to shortages and rising prices, coupled with influenza and smallpox outbreaks, weighted heavy on the majority of Tibetans, who were only marginally surviving before. Protests called \\"people's assemblies\\" began in Lhasa, where organizers sent letters of grievances to the government and posted anti-Chinese slogans in public places. The leaders were promptly arrested and the protests stifled.Knaus, John Kenneth (1999). \\"Orphans of the Cold War: America and the Tibetan Struggle for Survival\\". Public Affairs. p. 133(106‚Äì108) In early 1952, Thondup returned to Lhasa with an economic reform plan that would include lowering taxes and land reform. With the Dalai Lama in agreement, Thondup went about implementing the reforms only to meet with strong resistance from the wealthy old guard who labeled him a radical communist. The label sparked the interests of the Chinese who invited him to Beijing to study, but instead he fled back to India, where he began working with the CIA to form and train a Tibetan insurgency. Again the US tried to convince the Dalai Lama to do the same with an offer of \\"full aid and assistance\\", but he refused.Knaus p. 112‚Äì120. The Dalai Lama saw the need to modernize Tibet and was open to Marxism.\\"His Journey: Exile\\" The Dalai Lama. Time magazine. October 4, 1999 On the Tibetan leader's journey home from his year in China, Khampa and Amdowa clan leaders informed his chief of staff of their plans to rebel against the Chinese in retribution for land confiscation and attacks on monasteries. But all was relatively quiet in Lhasa and in April 1956 he received a Chinese delegation to inaugurate the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region of Tibet: a 51-man committee composed mostly of Tibetans.Knaus p. 126‚Äì127. Meanwhile, open rebellion began with the massacre of a Communist garrison in Kham which left an estimated 800 Chinese dead, sparking air strikes that killed more Tibetans. In addition, the CIA met with the Dalai Lama's two brothers Thubten Jigme Norbu and Gyalo Thondup in India and offered to train a pilot group of six Khampas in guerrilla warfare and radio communications in Saipan. They were smuggled out of Tibet and would later be parachuted back in to train others and to report back to the CIA on the insurgency's progress and needs.Knaus p. 136‚Äì140. According to the Dalai Lama, his visit to India in November 1956, during which he met with Tibetan \\"freedom fighters\\" which included two of his elder brothers, \\"spoiled good relations with China.\\" The exiles encouraged him to stay and join their fight for independence but Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru warned him that India could not offer support. Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai, who was also in Delhi, assured him of Mao's decision to postpone for six years further reforms in Tibet. Both Nehru and Enlai counseled the Lama to return to Lhasa.Dunham, Mikel.

In July 1957, the Dalai Lama hosted a large ceremony in the Potala Palace, during which he accepted a golden throne and petition from representatives of the Chushi Gangdruk Tibetan resistance movement, and in return gave them a blessing touch on their foreheads, and issued them with a talisman. They would soon become a 5,000-man strong \\"Defenders of the Faith Volunteer Army\\" under the leadership of Gompo Tashi Andrugtsang that would struggle against the Chinese for years.Knaus p. 150.\\"Ngapoi recalls the founding of the TAR\\", China Tibet Information Center, 18-08-2005. However, in September 1957 when the first two CIA trainees dropped into Tibet to deliver a message from the CIA offering support to the Tibetan leader, it was refused. The second drop of four men was disastrous: only one managed to escape alive. Meanwhile, by 1958 Gompo's army was doing quite well taking control of large portions of central Tibet.Knaus p. 153 1959 Tibetan uprising \\"By sunset on March 9 [1959] thousands of men, women, children started to gather outside the walls of the Summer Palace.\\" On March 10, 1959, the crowd surrounded the summer palace in response to fear that the Communist Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) were planning to arrest the Dalai Lama at \\"a theatrical performance at the Chinese military camp at Silling-Bhuk.\\" The people were determined not to allow the Dalai Lama to leave Norbulingka palace. Some members of the crowd directed aggression at Tibetan officials that were thought to be Chinese collaborators. Tenpa Soepa, who was staying at a house on the night of March 10 near Norbulingka said, \\"When I arrived at the gate I found Kalon Sampho lying on the ground unconscious.\\" Sampho, \\"...had arrived at Norbulinka [sic] in a car with his Chinese bodyguard. They got out of their car and when the crowd saw the Chinese guard they began throwing stones.\\" \\"Phakpalha Khenchung ...had been killed by the protestors. He was a government official, and it was rumored that he had a very close relationship with the Chinese.\\" PLA General Tan Kuan-sen considered the Dalai Lama to be in danger and offered him refuge if he could make it to the Chinese camp. He declined the offer. A week into the fighting, the general ordered two mortar rounds shot toward the palace. At that point, the Dalai Lama decided the time had come to slip out over the mountains, with a very small party, arriving a few days later at the Indian border.Knaus p. 164Shakya, Tsering. The Dragon In The Land Of Snows (1999) Columbia University Press. He was granted asylum by the Nehru government with the stipulation that he would not engage in politics on Indian soil. Meanwhile, Enlai dissolved the Tibetan government and appointed the Preparatory Committee for the Founding of the Tibet Autonomous Region to take its place. In 1959, Tenpa Soepa and other prisoners of war near Toema in Amdo said, \\"Along the road we could see why our guards were so jumpy. We saw many burnt-out guardposts and even some tanks that were destroyed by Tibetan guerillas. This was Amdo, where the guerrilla war had gone on for years.\\" Once in exile, the Dalai Lama's discourse changed from cooperative autonomy to independence. He cited the 17-Point Agreement as proof of Tibet's claim to sovereignty, while at the same time he declared it void because the Chinese had violated it and because, he claimed, it had been signed under duress. He also made clear that he was in favor of economic, social and political reforms, but that the Chinese had not acted in good faith.Knaus p. 177 He closed his first press conference in India in April 1959 by subtly establishing the government-in-exile by declaring, \\"wherever I am accompanied by my Government, the Tibetan people will recognize such as the Government of Tibet.\\"http://www.tibet.net/en/index.php?id=83&rmenuid;=11 The UN General Assembly responded by passing three resolutions in the first half of the decade calling for \\"respect for the fundamental human rights of the Tibetan people and for their distinctive cultural and religious life\\" and recognising the right of the Tibetan people to self-determination. The US responded differently. Each year of the 1960s, the CIA provided the Tibetan government- in-exile with $1.7 million for guerrilla operations and $180,000 for cultural centers and international lobbying. As he was announcing his whereabouts, the Khampa rebels were met by massive Chinese forces and were nearly obliterated. While they spent several months regrouping, the US failed to form a coalition of nations willing to recognize the Tibetan government-in-exile or even to find countries who would host the Dalai Lama on a tour to explain his cause. Tibetan resistance movement Already in July 1958, air drops of arms to the Chushi Gangdruk Tibetan resistance movement had begun, the CIA had relocated Tibetan guerrilla trainees to Camp Hale in Colorado, USA (where a Tibetan community still resides today), and parachute dispatch officers had been recruited from among the Montana US Forest Service smoke jumpers (who became known as the \\"Missoula Mafia\\").Knaus p. 154John B. Roberts, Elizabeth A. Roberts, Freeing Tibet: 50 Years of Struggle, Resilience, and Hope, AMACOM Div American Mgmt Assn, 2009, 288 pages, p. 40: \\"Many of the CAT pilots and crew members were Eastern European emigr√©s who had signed on with the CIA, but some were also \\"smoke jumpers\\" - firefighters who parachuted into wildfire blazes - from the American West. The smoke jumpers had been specially recruited because of their skill at ridge-hugging flying and skydiving in mountainous terrain. Because many came from Montana, the smoke jumpers were nicknamed the \\"Missoula Mafia.\\" But according to Thundrop, the Dalai Lama did not know about CIA involvement until he reached India. In autumn, the CIA parachuted four groups of Camp Hale trainees inside Tibet. The first was met by Chinese and the men fled for their lives. Two groups arrived safely and even facilitated successful arms drops, but the Chinese caught on and within a month all but a few of the team members and thousands of Khampa families were massacred. The CIA guerrilla training failed to take into account that the Khampa warriors travelled with family and livestock in tow. The fourth group had about the same luck. They arrived, received arms drops, were joined by two more teams, but in February 1960 the Chinese killed them along with another 4,000 rebel fighters and their parties.Knaus p. 224\\"The CIA Circus: Tibet's Forgotten Army How the CIA sponsored and betrayed Tibetans in a war the world never knew about\\" by Ramananda Sengupta. Outlook. February 10, 1999. accessed April 2011. One last group was dropped in 1961, but all but one were killed only three months after landing. The survivor was captured and as he says, tortured, until he told the entire story of Colorado. He was released from prison in 1979. At the proposal of Thundop and Gompo Tashi in early 1960, a Tibetan guerrilla base was established in Mustang, Nepal, where some 2,000 mostly ethnic Khampa amassed in such a disorderly fashion that the first year was a challenge for survival given that the US could not get food supplies to them due to a suspension of overflights stemming from the U-2 incident.Knaus p. 240 By spring 1961, Mustang guerrilla units had begun raids along a 250-mile stretch inside Tibet. In addition, some 12,000 Tibetans eventually joined the Special Frontier Force that manned the Sino-Indian border.Knaus p. 281 But as the years passed without any bases established inside Tibet, US enthusiasm over the Mustang fighters dwindled and already sparse and insufficient arms drops ceased in 1965, leaving an aging and barely armed guerrilla force in dire straits.Knaus p. 126‚Äì279 The 25 small teams of Colorado-trained Tibetans who were sent into Tibet from 1964 to 1967 on fact-finding missions had no better luck. Only two were able to operate in-country for more than two months, finding no support from compatriots. Meanwhile, the CIA provided the government-in-exile money to open offices in Geneva and New York, to arrange for resettlement of Tibetan orphans in Switzerland, and to educate a few dozen Tibetans at Cornell University.Knaus p. 283 By the time Nixon came to the White House, the CIA had already informed Thundrop that they were terminating support. (296) Years later, he would have this to say about the affair: According to author and scholar Carole McGranahan of the University of Colorado, today the history of the Tibetan resistance is purposefully down- played, uncelebrated, and even ignored by the Tibetan government in exile as it does not fit well into the global image it wishes to project and the current official position of seeking a peaceful coexistence with China.McGranahan, Carole (2010). Arrested Histories: Tibet, the CIA, and Memories of a Forgotten War. Duke University Press Books. Middle Way Approach According to the office of the Dalai Lama the essence of the Middle Way Approach seeks coexistence based on equality and mutual co-operation.His Holiness's Middle Way Approach For Resolving the Issue of Tibet. Accessed April, 2011. It is a: The seeds of the Middle Way Approach were sewn in the early 1970s in a series of internal government and external consultations. The Dalai Lama was encouraged in 1979 when Deng Xiaoping told his brother Gyalo Thondup that \\"except independence, all other issues can be resolved through negotiations\\". The Dalai Lama agreed to pursue negotiations for a mutually beneficial and peaceful resolution rather than fighting to restore independence. He sent three fact finding missions into Tibet and wrote Deng Xiaoping a long personal letter before his representatives traveled to Beijing in 1982 to open negotiations. However, they reported that their Chinese counterparts were not interested in discussing the situation in Tibet, only the personal status and future of the 14th Dalai Lama.Five Point Peace Plan Address to the U.S. Congressional Human Rights Caucus. September 21, 1987. Accessed April 2011. Nevertheless, during the 1980s, the Dalai Lama would send 6 delegations to China. In 1987, before the U.S. Congressional Human Rights Caucus the Dalai Lama unveiled the Five Point Peace Plan as a \\"first step towards a lasting solution\\".Congressional Gold Medal awarded to \\"Tenzin Gyatso the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet\\". The back side quotes him, \\"World Peace Must Develop From Inner Peace. Peace Is Not The Absence Of Violence. Peace Is The Manifestation Of Human Compassion.\\" #Transformation of the whole of Tibet into a zone of peace; #Abandonment of China's population transfer policy which threatens the very existence of the Tibetans as a people; #Respect for the Tibetan people's fundamental human rights and democratic freedoms; #Restoration and protection of Tibet's natural environment and the abandonment of China's use of Tibet for the production of nuclear weapons and dumping of nuclear waste; #Commencement of earnest negotiations on the future status of Tibet and of relations between the Tibetan and Chinese peoples. The next year, the Dalai Lama addressed the European Parliament and offered what was later called the Strasbourg Proposal 1988, which elaborated on the Middle Way Approach and a vision of reconciliation, resembling what some historians say was a suzerainty relationship between China and Tibet. The proposal basically calls for the establishment of a democratic Tibet with complete sovereignty over its domestic affairs and non-political foreign affairs, with China retaining its responsibility for Tibet's foreign policy and maintaining its military presence temporarily. The periodic meetings between the Central Tibetan Administration's envoys and the Chinese government were, Tundrop felt, \\"like one hand clapping\\"Gyalo Thondup: Interview Excerpts. Wall Street Journal. February 20, 2009. and so the CTA suspended them in 1994. They resumed at the pace of one per year between 2002 and 2008. In 2008, at the 8th round of talks, CTA envoys presented a document called Memorandum on Genuine Autonomy for the Tibetan People and a Note in response to Chinese government's statement asking what degree of autonomy is being sought by Tibetans. The Memorandum states that \\"in order for the Tibetan nationality to develop and flourish with its distinct identity, culture and spiritual tradition through the exercise of self-government on the above mentioned 11 basic Tibetan needs, the entire community, comprising all the areas currently designated by the PRC as Tibetan autonomous areas, should be under a single administrative entity. It further mentions that \\"bringing all the Tibetans currently living in designated Tibetan autonomous areas within a single autonomous administrative unit is entirely in accordance with the constitutional (Chinese) principle contained in Article 4, also reflected in the Law on Regional National Autonomy LRNA (Article 2), that \\"regional autonomy is practiced in areas where people of minority nationalities live in concentrated communities.\\" According to Central Tibetan Administration, the Middle Way Approach enjoys widespread support from the international community. In 2008, a group of 29 Chinese dissidents urged Beijing to open direct dialogue with Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama. In June 2012, the European parliament in Strasbourg passed a resolution commending the new CTA leadership for its commitment to resolve the issue of Tibet through Middle Way Approach. US President Barack Obama after meeting with Dalai lama on 21 February 2014, issued a statement applauding the Dalai Lama's commitment to non-violence and dialogue with China and his pursuit of Middle Way Approach. On 5 June 2014, Central Tibetan Administration launched an international awareness campaign on the Middle Way Approach. According to CTA, the campaign was to counter Chinese government's deliberate attempts to spread misinformation on the Middle Way Approach. During the campaign, CTA created a series of documents, website, documentary film and social media handles. =Criticism= The Middle Way Approach has been criticized by Elliot Sperling as a part of larger \\"self-delusion\\" of the CTA. The Tibetan Review points out how the Kashag \\"effectively edits out even crystal-clear voices for independence\\". 2008 protests and uprisings Sporadic and isolated outbursts by Tibetans against the Chinese continued especially during the unrest between September 1987 until March 1989 in the Tibetan areas of the PRC. But it wasn't until 2008 that a large-scale and coordinated uprising erupted coinciding with international protests accompanying the Olympics torch relay that would end in Beijing where the 2008 Summer Olympics were held. During the annual observance of both the 1959 Tibetan Uprising Day and the escape of the 14th Dalai Lama to India, monks from two different monasteries began marches into Lhasa on 10 March. Peaceful street protests and demonstrations grew, and were met by excessive force from Chinese police and military units on 14 March. Crowd control, shootings, beatings and arrests escalated the tensions, eventually setting off clashes between thousands of Tibetans in the Ramoche section of Lhasa and Chinese security forces. The clashes spread to include arson. Reports indicate more than 1200 Chinese shops, offices, and residences were burned, and fire was set to nearly 100 cars, including police vehicles. Monks were arrested at monasteries, and the number of Tibetans killed varies between 140 and 219 deaths.Wangpo Tethong, The 2008 uprising and the Olympics, (22 June 2018), Tibetan Review, https://www.tibetanreview.net/the-2008-uprising-and-the- olympics/ Other Tibetans were arrested, and Amnesty International reports 1000 Tibetans remained \\"unaccounted for\\" by June.Tibet protestors missing, Amnesty says, (19 June 2008), CNN, http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/06/19/oly.tibet.torch/ The paramilitary People's Armed Police were sent in and 50-100 Tibetans were killed. The international community condemned the suppression of the protests, which spread through the Tibetan plateau. Other reports on the clashes estimate among Han settlers, 22 were dead and 325 injured. Damage was estimated at $40 million USD. In the Gansu Province, another demonstration by 400 monks was met with Chinese security forces, igniting a clash by more than 5000 Tibetans who again burned down the establishments of local Han and Hui settlers before the forces arrived.

However, it was the chairman of the Chinese Communist Party who was dispatched to Tibet to deal with the situation and the Tibetan officials remained in other provinces. Eventually 90 locations erupted in protests. Their common slogans and Tibetan flags indicated desires for independence or autonomy.Smith, Warren W. Jr. (2009). Tibet's Last Stand?: The Tibetan Uprising of 2008 and China's Response. Rowman & Littlefield Publishers. pp. 1‚Äì10. Simultaneously, in India a coalition of Tibetan exile organizations- Tibetan Youth Congress (YTC), Tibetan Women's Association, Tibetan political prisoners' movement, Students for a Free Tibet and National Democratic Party of Tibet- calling itself the Tibetan People's Uprising Movement (TPUM) struck out on a \\"Return March to Tibet\\" on March 10. Carrying Tibetan flags and calling for independence, they planned to reach Tibet on foot just in time for the opening of the Olympic Games. Both India and Nepal reminded the Dalai Lama that the Tibetans' welcome in the area was predicated on the agreement of no anti-China political maneuvers from their territories.

Self-immolation protests As of June 15, 2012 there have been 38 reported self-immolations by Tibetan monks and nuns in China since February 27, 2009 when Tapey, a young monk from Kirti Monastery set himself on fire in the marketplace in Ngawa City, Ngawa County, Sichuan. Some of the protesters who set themselves on fire were teenagers. Most such incidents have taken place in Sichuan province, especially around the Kirti Monastery in Ngawa City, Ngawa County, Sichuan, others in Gansu and Qinghai provinces and Tibet Autonomous Region. Self-immolation protests by Tibetans also occurred in India and Kathmandu, Nepal. In 2011 a wave of self-immolations by Tibetans in China, India and Nepal occurred after the Phuntsog self-immolation incident of March 16, 2011 in Ngawa County, Sichuan. The Dalai Lama has said he does not encourage the protests, but he has praised the courage of those who engage in self-immolation and blamed the self-immolations on \\"cultural genocide\\" by the Chinese. Premier Wen Jiabao said that such extreme actions hurt social harmony and that Tibet and the Tibetan areas of Sichuan are integral parts of Chinese territory. According to The Economist, the self-immolations have caused the government's attitude to harden. Self-immolations by Tibetans protesting Chinese domination of Tibet have had a greater impact than earlier protests; despite considerable loss of life during the Tibetan protests in 2008 on the part of both the Tibetan and Han population in Tibet, casualties were simply not reported by the Chinese government. Self-immolations, on the other hand, result in dramatic images of the protester while burning or afterwards which can be easily transmitted over the internet to news media and supporters. Internet access has reached even remote areas in the parts of China where Tibetans live. Tibetan-Muslim sectarian violence In Tibet, the majority of Muslims are Hui people. Tension between Tibetans and Muslims stems from events during the Muslim warlord Ma Bufang's rule in Qinghai such as Ngolok rebellions (1917‚Äì49) and the Sino-Tibetan War. In the past riots have broken out between Muslims and Tibetans. The repression of Tibetan separatism by the Chinese government is supported by Hui Muslims. In addition, Chinese-speaking Hui have problems with Tibetan Hui (the Tibetan speaking Kache minority of Muslims). The front gate of the main mosque in Lhasa was burned down by Tibetan rioters attempting to storm the building while Chinese Hui Muslims were violently assaulted and their shops and restaurants destroyed in the 2008 Tibetan unrest.: \\"Police closed off Lhasa's Muslim quarter on Friday, two weeks after Tibetan rioters burned down the city's mosque amid the largest anti-Chinese protests in nearly two decades.\\"Barbara Demick, Tibetan-Muslim tensions roil China, Los Angeles Times, June 23rd, 2008: \\"Among China's dozens of minorities, few get along as badly as Tibetans and Muslims.

One way China has done this is by declaring that the next Dalai Lama must be born in China, thereby excluding anyone born outside their political control.

Picard is notable for having bound many books for the bibliophile Jean Grolier. He may also have worked at the French royal bindery. While the Grolier bindings have long been sought after, the identities of the binders who made them were forgotten until twentieth-century scholarship threw light on Picard and other binders. The British Library's bindings catalogue attributes a number of bindings to Picard: they are almost all on books bound for Grolier around 1540 in Paris. (binding dated circa 1540 on book published \\"In aedibus Aldi et Andreae Asulani\\": Venice, 1523) The Biblioth√®que nationale de France has a larger collection. Picard and the Aldine Press Some of Picard's bindings are on books in the celebrated editions of the classics by the Aldine Press. The press had been founded in 1494, and after the death of its founder, Aldus Manutius, in 1515, his family continued to run the business. As well as binding some of the books, Picard appears to have had a more direct connection with this press, as a man called Jean Picard managed its Parisian agency in the 1540s, selling books on commission. Not all sources agree that the bookseller can be assumed to be the same person as the bookbinder, although the possibility that he was the same person is obvious. The bookseller Picard's premises were identified by the sign of the dolphin and anchor, the emblem of the Aldine Press. They were in the Rue Saint-Jacques, a street in the Latin Quarter, which was a centre of the book trade.The Book Trade in the Italian Renaissance. Angela Nuovo In 1547 he encountered financial problems and fled his creditors. The Aldine Press then appointed a printer called Le Riche as its new agent. Le Riche was replaced after a couple of years by the bookbinder Gomar Estienne, who had been working at the royal bindery, the so- called Atelier de Fontainebleau. Estienne appears to have acquired some of the bookbinding tools used by Picard. Picard designs Picard is associated with a decorative style for which the French term is entrelacs g√©om√©triques. This style, which was favoured by Grolier, has interlaced designs which can be described as strapwork or interlaced ribbons. He also worked in other styles.

It was originally broadcast on ABC on April 13, 1987.  Plot  A happily married couple, Ellie and Nick Denato, are living in the wildlife of Africa with their young daughter, Melissa. Even though they have everything that they had ever wanted there, they return to San Francisco so Nick can focus on his career as a photographer and Ellie can give birth to their second child. Soon, life goes on a downward spiral for the high-powered, two-career couple, as Ellie is not satisfied in their surroundings. She misses her life as a doctor in Africa and suspects that Nick is not faithful to her when Scott's young and attractive assistant, Robin, arrives. When his partner, Scott, convinces Nick to go on a business trip to Nepal for six weeks, she reluctantly accepts the situation. Shortly after his departure, Ellie suffers a miscarriage. Instead of dealing with her loss, she feels scattered and disconnected, pretending that nothing has happened and she even claims that Nick should have never returned from Nepal to support her. The marriage continues to crumble, and Nick eventually commits infidelity by sleeping with Ellie's best friend, Eileen, the one woman who took care of him when his wife did not. To worsen the matters, Ellie changes her behavior shortly after, realizing that she was a \\"maniac\\" and mistreated her husband and loves him very much. When Ellie finds Nick's watch in Eileen's bed, she finds out about the indiscretion. Left with a broken heart, she takes Melissa and leaves for Africa, despite Nick and Eileen's attempts to assure her that their one night together meant nothing. In Africa, Ellie throws herself on her work and meanwhile raises Melissa. Six months later, Eileen is out of the picture in Nick's life, and he is still devastated by his wife's absence. Ellie, however, enjoys life and falls for the charms of French doctor Etienne. She accompanies him to London, where she walks into Nick and Robin at the airport. Initially, Ellie refuses to speak with Nick, though he is able to tell her that cheating on her has been the biggest mistake in his life. Ellie, nevertheless, goes through with the divorce and even takes off her wedding ring. However, she is unable to consummate her relationship with Etienne due to the past, much to Etienne's frustration. Meanwhile, Nick and Robin grow closer, but he rejects her when she wants to sleep with him, explaining that he is still in love with Ellie. The following morning, Nick is informed that his uncle Vito has died. Simultaneously, Ellie and Melissa return to San Francisco for a short stay. There, old memories, dedications and an emotional funeral make Ellie realize that Nick still loves her very much. Even though she kisses him, she is not ready to take him back and says goodbye. Instead, she travels to Paris to meet with Etienne. After spending one night with him, she packs her stuff and returns to Africa. Nick accompanies her there shortly after, and reunites with her.

He was a close friend of Abdul Karim (the Munshi), the Indian secretary of Queen Victoria. Victoria was instrumental in involving Ahmed in diplomatic approaches to Sultan Abdul Hamid II of the Ottoman Empire in the late 1890s, and unsuccessfully suggested that he be appointed to the British embassy in Constantinople. He was a prominent member of the Muslim Patriotic League, and under the Montagu‚ÄìChelmsford Reforms, which introduced greater self-government to British India, he was elected to the council of the Bombay Presidency. In 1928, he was appointed Minister of Agriculture and then as Minister of Education where he served till 1934. For his work in government, he was knighted in 1932. He died in his native Pune, where he had lived for the last 20 years of his life.

Laura X changed her name in 1962 to Laura Shaw Murra, which remains her legal name, and each of her other two sets of names she uses as an AKA. She took the name Laura X, on September 17, 1969, to symbolize her rejection of men's legal ownership of women and the anonymity of women's history, which was stolen from women and girls. She declared that, like Malcolm X, \\"I don't want to have my owner's name, either.\\" Education and background After attending Vassar College for three years, Laura X moved to New York City, became a Head Start Program teacher in the pilot program, having trained at the University of Puerto Rico. She also rose to Picket Captain in CORE (Congress of Racial Equality), attended New York University (NYU), and took graduate courses at Bank Street College of Education.

In 1963, she moved to Berkeley, California and graduated from the University of California, Berkeley (UC-Berkeley), in 1971, having participated in the Free Speech Movement as well as other social justice movements. Red W.I.T.C.H. Red W.I.T.C.H., a socialist spin-off of W.I.T.C.H., was created by teaching staff at UC Berkeley after they witnessed the W.I.T.C.H. actions in Chicago, and led by Laura X. Red W.I.T.C.H. responded to the patriarchal elements of socialist organization in the early 60's, criticising the contradictions between ideals of radical males and their behavior. Women's History Research Center Laura X is the founder and was the director of the Women's History Research Center, in Berkeley, California, which was the first historical archive connected to the feminist movement. Laura X founded the Women's History Research Center in 1968 after a University of California, Berkeley professor expressed doubt that there was enough material on women to fill a quarter's course in history. By 1970 the Women's History Research Center was widely listed in early feminist publications. The Center put many of the early feminist writings on microfilm, making them available in libraries across the country. The Women's History Research Center eventually closed, and its collections are now held in the women's history archive at the Schlesinger Library, which is part of Harvard University's Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, and at other institutions. Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press Associate In 1977, Laura X became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media. National Clearinghouse on Marital and Date Rape In 1978 the Women's History Research Center established the National Clearinghouse on Marital and Date Rape in Berkeley, California, with Laura X as director. Marital and Date Rape Legislation In 1979 Laura X led a successful campaign to make marital rape a crime in California.ABOUT LAURA X, on the National Clearinghouse on Marital and Date Rape website She also acted as a consultant to 45 other state campaigns on marital and date rape, as well as collecting and maintaining documents about the status of exemptions from prosecution in rape laws. Repeal of date and marital rape exemptions occurred in 45 states, in Federal and military law, in the laws of Guam and the laws of twenty other countries.

Laura X World Institute In 2015, Laura X formed the 'Laura X - Laura Rand Orthwein, Jr. World Institute on Social Justice Movements.' Located physically in St. Louis, Missouri, the Institute serves as the home of both the physical archive which total over 400,000 individual items of history, the virtual museum, and the interpretation center for archival materials extant at UC Berkeley, Harvard, University of Illinois and other institutions, including guides to the Women's History Research Center (WHRC). Total items at universities around the world are over 1,000,000 items of history. Laura X serves as the Institute's activist-in-residence and together with others offers interpretation and teaching to enrich communities in St Louis via in- person events and around the world through online virtual exhibitions. The collection pertains to the Women's Movement and a wide array of precursors and overlapping social movements from the second half of the 20th century, including materials from Laura X's successful state-by-state campaign to abolish the legal privilege for marital and date rape. She began collecting materials in 1964 and has been committed to this effort ever since. The Institute's Archives make historical research and presentation possible. Archive staff is currently engaged in cataloging the 580+ boxes of materials, in order to keep them vibrant, accessible, and available for researchers and other interested parties. Once finished, this archive will be a resource for students, professors, historians, film documentarians, museums, exhibitions, high school teachers, and the general public.

It is the mirror process of In Situ Chemical Oxidation (ISCO). ISCR is usually applied in the environment by injecting chemically reductive additives in liquid form into the contaminated area or placing a solid medium of chemical reductants in the path of a contaminant plume.http://www.epa.gov/ada/gw/iscr.html It can be used to remediate a variety of organic compounds, including some that are resistant to natural degradation. The in situ in ISCR is just Latin for \\"in place\\", signifying that ISCR is a chemical reduction reaction that occurs at the site of the contamination. Like ISCO, it is able to decontaminate many compounds, and, in theory, ISCR could be more effective in ground water remediation than ISCO. Chemical reduction is one half of a redox reaction, which results in the gain of electrons. One of the reactants in the reaction becomes oxidized, or loses electrons, while the other reactant becomes reduced, or gains electrons. In ISCR, reducing compounds, compounds that accept electrons given by other compounds in a reaction, are used to change the contaminants into harmless compounds. History ISCR is a relatively new type of ground water remediation technology. The most work on this method of remediation has been done in the past 10‚Äì15 years, so there are still many gaps in the understanding of the chemistry behind this process. The development of ISCR started out when K.H. Sweeny conducted research with zero-valent copper and iron in the late 1970s. He was able to treat a number of different chlorinated substances such as DDT, endrin, chloroform, and hexachlorocyclopentadiene to name a few. His work has been the basis of ISCR today. In the 1990s, Gillham, Tratnyek, Kriegman, Zhang, and Batchelor all made significant contributions in testing different metals and oxides for the use of ISCR. Gillham and Tratnyek in particular applied the reductive chemistry to groundwater treatment with the emplacement of ZVI barriers. Although it has been shown that other metals like aluminum and magnesium can produce the same effect in the laboratory, ground water treatment most generally focuses on the use of iron. Other major contributions in this field includes Zhang, who researched nanoscale iron, and Batchelor, who researched zero-valent iron clay (ZVI Clay). This past decade, more aspects of ISCR have been researched and new methods of implementation, such as ZVI clay and emulsified ZVI (EZVI), have been created. Scientists have also found that certain iron minerals, like green rust, magnetite, and pyrite, also have reductive capabilities although they contain ferrous iron rather than ZVI. Reductants =Zero valent metals (ZVMs)= Zero Valent Metals are the main reductants used in ISCR. The most common metal used is iron, in the form of ZVI (zero valent iron), and it is also the metal longest in use. However, some studies show that zero valent zinc (ZVZ) could actually be up to ten times more effective at eradicating the contaminants than ZVI. Some applications of ZVMs are to clean up Trichloroethylene (TCE) and Hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)). ZVMs are usually implemented by a permeable reactive barrier. For example, iron that has been embedded in a swellable, organically modified silica creates a permanent soft barrier underground to capture and reduce small, organic compounds as groundwater passes through it.http://www.clu- in.org/techfocus/default.focus/sec/Nanotechnology:_Applications_for_Environmental_Remediation/cat/Application/ =Iron minerals= There are also many iron minerals that can actively be used in dechlorination. These minerals use . Particular minerals that can be used include green rust, magnetite, pyrite, and glauconite. The most reactive of the iron minerals are the iron sulfides and oxides. Pyrite, an iron sulfide, is able to dechlorinate carbon tetrachloride in suspension. These substances are very interesting because they are naturally present, and learning about how they produce reductive zones could lead to the development of better reductants for ISCR. =Polysulfides= Polysulfides are compounds that have chains of sulfur atoms. This is a relatively new reactant, but it has been tested on the field in treating TCE and in comparison to EHC. The use of Polysulfides is a type of abiotic reduction and works best in anaerobic conditions where iron (III) is available. The benefit of using polysulfides is that they do not produce any biological waste products; however, the reaction rates are slow and they require more time to create the DVI (dual valent iron) minerals that are needed for the reduction to occur.Svendsen, B. G., D. Brown, and E. Dmitrovic. \\"Chemical Reduction of TCE with EHC and Calcium Polysulfide.\\" http://www.adventusgroup.com/pdfs/presentations/Chemical%20Reduction%20of%20TCE%20with%20EHC%20and%20Calcium%20Polysulfide.pdfERM. Keynote. =Dithionite= Dithionite () can also be used as a reductant. It is usually used in addition to iron reduce contaminants. A number of reactions take place and eventually the contaminant is removed. In the process, ditionite is consumed and the final product of all the reactions is 2 sulfur dioxide anions. The dithionite is not stable for a long period of time. =Bimetallic materials= Bimetallic materials are materials that are made out of two different metals or alloys that are tightly bonded together. A good example of a bimetallic material would be a bimetallic strip which is used in some kinds of thermometers. In ISCR, bimetallic materials are small pieces of metals that are coated lightly with a catalyst such as palladium, silver, or platinum. The catalyst drives a faster reaction and the small size of the particles allows them to effectively move into and remain in the target zone. =Proprietary materials= One proprietary material present today for ISCR is the EHC technology created by Adventus. This particular product is actually a mixture of carbon, nutrients, and zero-valent iron. The theory behind this product is that the carbon in the mixture will promote bacterial growth in the subsurface. The growing bacteria consume oxygen, which easily accepts electrons, present in the subsurface which increases reducing potential. The growing bacteria also ferment and produce fatty acids that act as electron donors to other bacteria and substances. Adventus uses this combination of biotic and abiotic processes to implement ISCR. EHC is injected as a \\"slurry\\" (a mixture that is 15 to 40% solids and weight with the rest being liquid) into the substratum.http://www.adventusgroup.com/products/ehc.shtml Another material worth mentioning is EZVI (emulsified ZVI) which is a NASA technology. EZVI is used mainly to treat halogenated hydrocarbons and DNAPLs. EZVI is nanoscale iron that is placed into a biodegradable oil emulsion. The emulsion is then injected into the substratum.Parrish, Lew. \\"Emulsified Zero-Valent Iron (EZZVI.\\" Technology. NASA, n.d. Web. 18 Mar 2011. . Reactions in ISCR =Reductive processes= In ISCR, there are many reductive processes that can take place. There are hydrogenolysis, Œ≤-elimination, hydrogenation, Œ±-elimination, and electron transfer. The specific combination of reductive processes that actually take place in the subsurface depends on the species of contaminant that is present and also the type of reduction being used. The natural and biological processes that take place in the substratum also affect the kinds of reductive processes that are found. =Surface catalyzed reactions= The reactions that occur with permeable reactive barriers and ferrous iron are surface based. The surface reactions take three different forms: direct reduction, electron shunting through ferrous iron, and reduction by production and reaction of hydrogen. Pathway A represents direct electron transfer (ET) for Fe0 to the adsorbed halocarbon (RX) at the metal/water point of contact, resulting in dechlorination and production of Fe2+. Pathway B shows that Fe2+ (resulting from corrosion of Fe0) may also dechlorinate RX, producing Fe3+. Pathway C shows that H2 from the anaerobic corrosion of Fe2+ might react with RX if a catalyst is present. =Enhancement of reductive pathways= The reductive processes discussed above can be enhanced in two ways. One is by increasing the amount of usable iron in the subsurface to increase the rate of the reduction by chemical or biological means. The second method is to enhance the reducing ability of the iron by coupling it with other chemical reductants or using biological reduction with it. Using this processes, scientists combined sodium dithionite with iron to treat Chrominum VI and TCE effectively. Combining bacterial action and biological processes with iron is also known to be effective. The most evident uses of biological processes are with the EZVI technology created by NASA and with the EHC product created by Adventus. Both of these materials have iron within some biological matrix (iron is suspended in vegetable oil in EZVI and in organic carbon in EHC) and use microbial organisms to enhance the reduction zone and to create a more anaerobic environment for the reactions to take place in. Implementation The most common type of implementation of ISCR is the installation of permeable reactive barriers (PRBs), but there are instances when the reductant can be directly injected into the subsurface to treat source areas. =Semi-permeable reactive barrier= These barriers are usually made out of zero-valent iron (ZVI) but can also be made with any other zero- valent metal. The most common way they are made is by filling a trench with ZVI, nanoscale iron, or palladium. Nanoscale iron particles can also be injected directly into the subsurface to treat plumes, and they have large surface areas and, therefore, high reactivities and can be distributed more evenly in the contamination site. Palladium's reaction rates are rapid. The main advantages of PRBs are that it can reduce many a variety of contaminants and it has no above-ground structure. Problems with PRBs include that even with well constructed barriers, there might be the problem of hydraulic short- circuiting.\\"Chemical oxidation and reduction for chlorinated solvent remediation.\\" In In Situ Remediation of Schlorinated Solvent Plumes; Stroo, H.F.; Ward C.H. (Eds); New York, NY: Springer. pp. 293-294. . =Direct injection of reductants= Nanoscale iron can be directly into the subsurface because they are small enough to be distributed thoroughly. Because the particles are so small, they have a comparatively large reactive surface, providing a more effective reaction. As of now, nanoscale iron is the only material that has been used with this injection strategy, and it is probably the only material that is effective in injection. Future of ISCR ISCR is a relatively new technology, so there much scope for research and improvement. Right now, although the reactions that make up ISCR have been studied extensively, there is not much background on what factors most contribute to the effectiveness of ISCR. One thing that needs to be done is find out exactly what reactions are taking place in the subsurface. ISCR is fairly more complex than ISCO because there are substances in the subsurface that will naturally reduce contaminants. The pathways that a contaminant can go through are consequently more diverse. Also, questions that need to be kept in mind are: #Which reducing agent will work best with a particular conaminant? #How can we improve the ISCR technology that is already commercially available?

LaserPerformance is also well known for its Sunfish Stand Up Paddleboards and Seitech dollies and racking systems. Background On a phone call between Canadians Bruce Kirby and Ian Bruce in 1969, the pair discussed the possibility of a car-topped dinghy (a boat small enough to be carried on a roof rack of a typical car) for a line of camping equipment. Kirby resultantly sketched out what would be known as \\"the million dollar doodle.\\" Following his \\"doodle\\" Kirby developed working drawings that Ian Bruce used to develop the Laser. The plans stayed with Kirby and Bruce until 1970 when One Design and Offshore Yachtsman magazine held a regatta for boats under $1000, called \\"America's Teacup.\\" After a few sail modifications, the Laser easily won its class. The prototype was originally named the \\"Weekender\\"; the sail held the letters TGIF, a common American abbreviation for \\"Thank God It's Friday.\\" Ian Bruce renamed the boat the \\"Laser\\" (after the scientific mechanism), and officially unveiled at the New York Boat Show in 1971. The first world championship was held in 1974 in Bermuda. The Laser became a men's Olympic-class boat at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, with a special Olympic edition of the boat released that year in commemoration. A version with a smaller sail, the Laser Radial, was first sailed as a women's Olympic-class boat at the 2008 Summer Olympics.http://uk.laserperformance.com/company/history?site_id=na2010 Followed by a youth version known as the 4.7. History Neither Bruce nor Kirby had the financial or manufacturing capability to mass-produce and market the boat, and so sold a series of manufacturing licenses to existing boat manufacturers, each with an exclusive geographic sales region: *Europe: Performance Sailcraft based in Long Buckby, Northampton, England *North America: Vanguard Sailboats of Portsmouth, RI *Australia and Oceania: Performance Sailcraft Australia Each was licensed to manufacture the basic craft, under strict one design rules. Each builder produced the Laser 1 and 2 but it was LaserPerformance Europe which diluted the brand most by introducing boats such as the Laser 2000, Laser 4000, Laser 5000, Laser Bahia, Laser SB3. The company was also responsible the Dart Catamaran brand, and a range of rotomoulded plastic dinghies. In 2007 Performance Sailcraft Europe and Vanguard merged to create LaserPerformance. This changed the business model from being a licensed boat builder, to a lifestyle brand that manufactured and distributed dinghies and other water sports related products. LaserPerformance also introduced SailLaser centers with the goal of promoting sailing and bringing the community of sailors together through training programs, events, leasing of boats and social activities. Sailors are globally connected to pursue common interests by becoming members of LaserPerformance United, where LaserPerformance helps facilitate activities and suggests member-run initiatives. Sunfish The Sunfish sailboat is a personal size, beach launched sailing dinghy utilizing a pontoon type hull carrying a lateen sail mounted to an un-stayed mast. Sunfish was developed by Alcort, Inc. and first appeared around 1952 as the \\"next generation\\" improvement on their original boat, the Sailfish. In contrast, the Sunfish has a wider beam for more stability, increased freeboard and the addition of a foot-well for a more comfortable sailing position. Sunfish began as a wood hull design and progressed to fiberglass construction just a few years after its introduction. Having a lateen sail with its simple two line rigging makes a Sunfish simple to learn sailing on and to set up. Upgrades can be added to enhance sail control for competitive sailing,Sunfish Class Association making the boat attractive to both novice and experienced sailors alike. Due to the broad appeal of the Sunfish, in 1995 it was commended by The American Sailboat Hall of Fame for being \\"the most popular fiberglass boat ever designed, with a quarter million sold worldwide\\" (at that point in time). Today, the Sunfish brand-name has become so widely known it is often misapplied generically to refer to any brand board-style boat sporting the characteristic lateen sail.Clonefish article ‚Äì other brands of boats commonly misperceived of as Sunfish Currently manufactured by LaserPerformance.

Plot Cavalier and Lindon play versions of themselves, starting work on a film in which they will play the president of the republic and a politician who will be prime minister, respectively. Though improvised conversations, they sketch out both their fictional and actual relationships. Cavalier's President character calls on Lindon's Prime Minister character to pass a law on the maximum salary at the national level. The project met with strong opposition and the two men can not muster a majority of MPs behind the project. Having the feeling of not being sufficiently supported by the President, Lindon decides to run for president himself.

Variety described it as the \\"epitome of an in-joke, best appreciated by director Alain Cavalier and his slender cast, Pater is a confounding slog for most anyone else. Curiously tapped for a Cannes competition slot, this sloppily improvised film about filmmaking doesn't bother to make clear whether and how it's a mock-docu account of the shooting of a French prime minister biopic, as Cavalier cavalierly squanders the chance to represent his meta-narrative in stylistically coherent terms.\\" Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian wrote: \\"It is a very verbose film - yet with interesting things to say.\\" The A.V.

The two-mass and skates aspects of the model were chosen to eliminate design parameters so that the nine that remain, the locations of the masses and the steering geometry, could be more easily analyzed. Instead of full inertia tensors, the total mass of the bike is reduced to just two point masses, one attached to the rear frame and one attached to the front fork. Instead of rotating wheels, the non- holonomic ground contacts are provided by small-radius skates. History The self-stability of bicycles was reported as early as 1876. Emmanuel Carvallo in 1897 and Francis Whipple in 1899 both developed equations of motion for a bicycle that showed this self-stability. In 1970, David Jones explained in Physics Today how he experimented with a traditional bicycle to see if cancelling the gyroscopic effect of the front wheel would make it unridable. He added a second, counter-rotating front wheel that did not touch the ground. He reported that his particular bicycle would no longer stay up without a rider, but he could still easily ride it, and he could even just barely ride it no-handed. It was no longer self-stable, it was still controllable, but it was no longer easily controllable. Jones also tried increasing trail, by reversing the front fork, and found that self-stability was dramatically increased, but that this made it more difficult to ride - \\"it was too stable to be steered.\\" Finally, he made a bike with negative trail, by adding forward extensions to the ends of the fork, and found that it had negligible self- stability and was \\"indeed very dodgy to ride, though not as impossible as [he] had hoped.\\" By evaluating which modifications made a bicycle easy to ride, with hands on and off, Jones concluded that gyroscopic effects were less important than trail for bicycle stability. The scientific and popular literature continued to report that positive trail, also called caster trail, was necessary for stability, although not always making a clear distinction between self-stability and controllability. The researchers who developed the two-mass skate bicycle focused solely on self-stability, although they do mention that \\"rider-controlled stability of bicycles is indeed related to their self-stability.\\" Implications The existence of the TMS and the self- stability it exhibits suggests that the design envelope of rideable bikes is larger than previously thought. For example, rear-wheel steering may not be as impossible as has been claimed. In the case of the TMS bike, the authors explain that the front assembly center of mass is lower than the rear frame center of mass ‚Äì so it falls faster in a lean; and it is in front of the steering axis so it tends to steer the front end in the direction of the lean. They conclude: > As a rule we have found that almost any selfstable bicycle can be made > unstable by mis-adjusting only the trail, or only the front-wheel gyro, or > only the front-assembly center-of-mass position. Conversely many unstable > bicycles can be made stable by appropriately adjusting any one of these > three design variables, sometimes in an unusual way. Physical implementation A physical example has been created that closely approximates the TMS model and exhibits self-stability without gyroscopic effects from the wheels and without positive trail. Since point masses do not exist in nature, the model can only approximate them with pieces of dense material (lead), mounted on a frame of light materials (carbon fiber and aluminum). To prevent the bike with just two masses, as pictured above, from tipping forward, a third mass is located just above the rear wheel contact patch where it does not alter the dynamics. In place of skates, small-radius wheels that drive nearly identical counter-rotating wheels are used to provide the non-holonomic ground contact with minimal gyroscopic effect. This physical example closely mimics the self-stability of the theoretical model.

The book was first published on November 27, 2012 through Roc Hardcover and continues the adventures of wizard detective Harry Dresden. Plot summary As the story begins, Harry is in Arctis Tor where he is nursed back to health by Sarissa, a member of the Winter Court and a servant of Mab, the Winter Queen. His recovery culminates in a Winter Court party, serving both as an introduction of the new Winter Knight and as Harry's surprise birthday party. During the party he is set up by Maeve, the Winter Lady, who sets a number of events in motion in an attempt to kill him. With help from Sarissa and advice from Kris Kringle, he defeats Maeve's minions and asserts himself as the Winter Knight before the entire Winter Court. Mab, quite satisfied at this outcome, gives Harry his first mission as the new Winter Knight: Kill Maeve. Harry returns to Chicago and consults Bob, to find out how to go about killing an immortal. Bob is initially reluctant to give out such dangerous information, but eventually tells Harry that immortals can be killed during certain conjunctions, such as on Earth on Halloween night, the day after tomorrow. Harry meets up with Molly, who informs him that energy is growing on Demonreach and she thinks it might explode. He travels to the island and speaks to the spirit of Demonreach, learning that the island is a prison which was created by Merlin himself to contain a massive number of various unspeakable supernatural horrors. Because of his connection to the island, he is now the prison's de facto Warden. The island is under attack, and if the attack is not stopped, the prison's fail-safe will trigger, releasing enough magical energy to destroy the prison as well as level a significant portion of the Midwest. In trying to figure out how to proceed, Harry consults with many magical powers, including Donar Vadderung, Lily, Titania, the Faerie Mothers, and Rashid. Harry learns that Outsiders are constantly attempting to get past the Outer Gates, which are defended by the Winter Fae. He discovers that Outsiders are behind his present troubles, and that an Outsider infiltrator named Nemesis has been behind many challenges faced by Harry and by the world in general for many years. He also figures out that the ritual that will be used to destroy Demonreach will be performed at the island itself at some point in the near future. While preparing for the assault against the hundreds of Outsiders attacking Demonreach, Harry is chased and attacked by the Wild Hunt. With Karrin Murphy's assistance, he is able to evade the Hunt temporarily, and after shooting the Erlking, he takes command of the Hunt and leads it against the Outsiders. With the reinforcement of the Hunt, Harry is able to disrupt the ritual and repel the Outsider attack. Harry and his friends head for the top of the island, where they find Lily and Maeve magically assaulting Demonreach. Harry, having determined that Maeve has been corrupted by the Nemesis, attacks Maeve. She defeats him soundly but he is rescued by his friends. Harry, out of options, summons Mab, who appears and confronts Maeve. Maeve refuses to yield to her mother and shoots and kills Lily, resulting in the mantle of the Summer Lady passing to Sarissa. Murphy then shoots Maeve, resulting in the mantle of the Winter Lady passing to Molly. Harry decides to remain on the island for the time being so that he can learn more about it and establish a new base of operations, and takes a branch from its oldest oak tree to use in making a new staff.

The method is a hybrid of branch and bound and column generation methods. Description of the algorithm Branch and price is a branch and bound method in which at each node of the search tree, columns may be added to the linear programming relaxation (LP relaxation). At the start of the algorithm, sets of columns are excluded from the LP relaxation in order to reduce the computational and memory requirements and then columns are added back to the LP relaxation as needed. The approach is based on the observation that for large problems most columns will be nonbasic and have their corresponding variable equal to zero in any optimal solution. Thus, the large majority of the columns are irrelevant for solving the problem. Outline of branch and price algorithm. Adapted from The algorithm typically begins by using a reformulation, such as Dantzig‚ÄìWolfe decomposition, to form what is known as the Master Problem. The decomposition is performed to obtain a problem formulation that gives better bounds when the relaxation is solved than when the relaxation of the original formulation is solved. But, the decomposition usually contains many variables and so a modified version, called the Restricted Master Problem, that only considers a subset of the columns is solved. Then, to check for optimality, a subproblem called the pricing problem is solved to find columns that can enter the basis and reduce the objective function (for a minimization problem). This involves finding a column that has a negative reduced cost. Note that the pricing problem itself may be difficult to solve but since it is not necessary to find the column with the most negative reduced cost, heuristic and local search methods can be used. The subproblem must only be solved to completion in order to prove that an optimal solution to the Restricted Master Problem is also an optimal solution to the Master Problem. Each time a column is found with negative reduced cost, it is added to the Restricted Master Problem and the relaxation is reoptimized. If no columns can enter the basis and the solution to the relaxation is not integer, then branching occurs. Most branch and price algorithms are problem specific since the problem must be formulated in such a way so that effective branching rules can be formulated and so that the pricing problem is relatively easy to solve. If cutting planes are used to tighten LP relaxations within a branch and price algorithm, the method is known as branch price and cut. Applications of branch and price The branch and price method can be used to solve problems in a variety of application areas, including: *Graph multi-coloring. This is a generalization of the graph coloring problem in which each node in a graph must be assigned a preset number of colors and any nodes that share an edge cannot have a color in common. The objective is then to find the minimum number of colors needed to have a valid coloring. The multi-coloring problem can be used to model a variety of applications including job scheduling and telecommunication channel assignment. *Vehicle routing problems. *Generalized assignment problem.

It first aired on April 11, 2011. This is the 150th episode of the series and marks the return of Thirteen, whose whereabouts have been unknown to House's team for the last year. Wilson and Cuddy do not appear in this episode. Plot The episode starts with House waiting outside Middlebury Correctional Institute in New Jersey. It turns out he is picking up the freshly-released Thirteen who is surprised to see House. As they drive away, House asks her what she did. When she replies that she was in jail for \\"excessive prescribing\\", House states that this was only her plea bargain and not the truth. Thirteen avoids the question. Meanwhile, back at the hospital, Masters presents a case to her teammates: a 36-year-old teacher coughing up blood. House pages the team that he will be away for three days. Chase and Foreman ignore Masters' case. Chase plans to go on vacation to Cabo while Foreman plans to go skiing. House is, however, listening on Masters' phone and forces the team to test the patient. House avoids telling the team about Thirteen. After talking with the patient, Chase diagnoses a Serratia infection which is immediately ruled out by patient coughing up blood. House mentions he is going to a spud-gun competition. They take a detour to buy fresh clothes for Thirteen and around a residential neighborhood where Thirteen knees an unidentified man (portrayed by Lost co-creator Damon Lindelof) in the groin at his house. House tells Thirteen about his relationship with Cuddy and their recent breakup. Thirteen tells House that she killed a man. Foreman and Taub search the patient's house and find out that he is a hoarder and come up with aspergillosis for a diagnosis. However, this is ruled out as well by Taub and Masters. Chase and Masters search the house again and come up with a diagnosis of Q fever, but also find the patient's wife hidden at the house, who is revealed to be the actual hoarder. House and Thirteen plan to build a powerful spud gun to defeat House's nemesis Harold Lam, who has already defeated him four times at the same competition. Although initially reluctant, Thirteen throws herself into the project. At the competition, Thirteen indirectly lets slip that she had a brother. House figures out that Thirteen had euthanized her brother who, like her mother, suffered from Huntington's disease. Thirteen admits this and explains that her brother had asked her to end his life in one of his increasingly short periods of lucidity. She tells him that she knows that she will one day reach similar state and that there will be no one to help her in the same way, a plaintive declaration that clearly troubles the silent and pensive House. However, Thirteen takes his silence as a lack of emotional response, and tells him that \\"it's no wonder Cuddy broke up with you\\". Back at the competition, House threatens Lam with the spud gun, getting only a warning from the police because of Lam's having put the moves on the sheriff's daughter earlier. Thirteen waits for House outside the sheriff's station in the same manner he waited for her in the opening scene. House mentions to Thirteen that it would have been his and Cuddy's one year anniversary that day. Meanwhile, Taub mentions his date with a new hospital employee to Foreman. However, Foreman finds out that Taub is also sleeping with his ex-wife Rachel. Foreman tells Taub that he is being selfish. Taub later meets Rachel and apologizes for being selfish and not letting her move on with her life. Rachel, however, tells him that she does not mind their relationship in its patently dysfunctional state. Back at the hospital, treatment for presumed Q fever helps the husband but not the wife. House asks the team to consider the wife as the only patient. The team comes up with a diagnosis of hydrogen sulfide gas exposure. Chase and Masters return to the patient's house to check for the gas. Masters finds baby clothes among the hoarded stuff at the house and confronts the couple about this, bringing a new symptom to the table - infertility. House, driving back from the competition with Thirteen, asks the team to confirm the validity of the symptom by checking both husband and wife, ignoring Thirteen's attempt to quietly suggest another option without participating in the discussion. Thirteen finally enters the discussion openly, suggesting that infertility is not the only option. The team is excited to hear from Thirteen, but House asks them to save their chatter with her for when she returns the next week. Thirteen suggests an alternative symptom - miscarriage. The final diagnosis of the wife is Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. In the last scene, House drops Thirteen by her house, sarcastically noting that she owes him $87 for the fuel. When he sees her staring in depression, House tells her; \\"I'll kill you, when the time comes, if you want\\". Thirteen nods to him, accepting the offer as she leaves the car. Reception =Critical response= IGN critic Jonah Krakow gave the episode a score of 8.5 out of 10, mentioning \\"I really enjoyed this episode because it allowed House to show a compassionate side of himself to a well-known character, while still being rude and inappropriate.\\" Zack Handlen of The A.V.

It also stars Joeystarr, Karin Viard, Marina Fo√Øs, Nicolas Duvauchelle, Emmanuelle Bercot and Riccardo Scamarcio. The film centres on the Child Protection Unit (Brigade de Protection des Mineurs) of the Paris Police, and a photographer who is assigned to cover the unit. The title is derived from Ma√Øwenn's son's misspelling of the word \\"police\\". The film won the Jury Prize at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival and in 2012, was nominated for thirteen C√©sar Awards. Plot The members of a Child Protection Unit police squad try to safeguard their mental health and home lives in the face of their stressful and disruptive work: tracking paedophiles, arresting parents suspected of mistreating their children, following teenage pickpockets, runaways or those sexually exploited and helping in the protection of homeless children and victims of rape. During brief periods of relaxation, the squad gossip, quarrel, drink, dance; relationships are put under strain, break and are remade or newly made. Their boss is an ambitious and politically astute policeman, not wholly sympathetic to the demands of their consciences, and ready to tighten the leash if the suspect whom they are questioning has powerful friends. At the heart of the story is a hard-edged, bitter yet tender policeman (Joeystarr), and a photographer (played by director Ma√Øwenn), whose assignment is to follow the squad in their work.

She was allowed to stay with the officers of the unit to research the subject and get to know what kind of people they were. All the cases in the screenplay were based either on things the director had witnessed during her time with the unit or older cases they told her about. Not letting the viewers know the verdicts of the defendants was a conscious choice, because the police officers seldom get to know it either. Ma√Øwenn wrote a first draft for the screenplay on her own, and was then joined by Emmanuelle Bercot. The film was produced for ‚Ç¨6.14 million through Les Films du Tr√©sor in co-production with Arte France Cin√©ma and Mars Films. The production received pre-sales investment from Canal+ and Cin√©Cin√©ma. Ma√Øwenn only wanted to cast actors who would be credible in the roles of policemen: \\"In my opinion all of them had to have a common feature - they had to look like working class people and speak in vernacular Parisian French.\\" Two former members of the CPU were hired to train the actors. Filming took place in Paris between 30 August and 29 October 2010. The film was digitally recorded with two or three cameras in each scene. Editing took three months. Release The world premiere took place at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, where the film was screened in the main competition on 13 May. The regular French release was on 19 October through Mars Distribution. Reception At the Cannes Film Festival, Jordan Mintzer of The Hollywood Reporter compared the film to \\"a whole season of The Wire packed into a single two-hour-plus film, ... and even with its loose threads and frenzied structure, it convincingly jumps from laughter to tears and back again, never losing sight of the brutal realities at its core.\\" In Screen Daily's review from the festival, Jonathan Romney called Ma√Øwenn \\"undeniably a very strong director of actors, especially when it comes to the delicate scenes involving the various children. She's less adept, though, at judging what is dramatically essential and what is surplus to requirements\\". The film won the Cannes Film Festival's Jury Prize. Peter Bradshaw from the Guardian newspaper was much less positive. He described the film as \\"a strong contender for the most awful film of the competition\\" and \\"much of it feels like a pretty dodgy evening in front of the television: less The Wire, more The Bill. But I don't think any director of The Bill would have permitted the toe-curlingly embarrassing overacting we get in this movie\\". Peter Sch√∂ning, defined in his review for German Der Spiegel \\"Poliss(e)\\" as \\"a cry for help which became a film.\\" (\\"Poliezei\\", das ist ein Film gewordener Hilferuf...) He added this was \\"not merely because of the abused children and young delinquents whose cases Ma√Øwenn mentions in her film without showing pictures of them...\\" (Nicht nur der kindlichen Missbrauchsopfer und jugendlichen Misset√§ter wegen, deren F√§lle Ma√Øwenn in ihrem Film zur Sprache bringt, ohne sie im Bild selbst vorzuf√ºhren...) but \\"...as well because of those policemen who have to enforce the law but moreover have to perform a great deal of social work - hereby permanently being overstrained.\\" (... auch aufgrund jener Polizisten, die zwar der Strafverfolgung dienen, vor allem aber Sozialarbeit leisten - und dabei durchweg √ºberfordert sind.) He concludes: \\"Despite all the ugly things told in this film Polisse has a beauty which derives from its pursuit of truthfulness.\\" (\\"Poliezei\\" besitzt bei all dem H√§sslichen, von dem der Film zu berichten hat, eine Sch√∂nheit, die aus seinem Streben nach Wahrhaftigkeit stammt).

After graduating, he's taken under the wing of his father's former partner, Captain Joe Sarcone, who invites him to join the Street Vice Crime Task Force. Under Sarcone's tutelage, he becomes part of a rogue task force that consists of dirty cops. After he learns from the District Attorney's office that his father was murdered by Sarcone after turning state's evidence, Maldonado frames Sarcone for a theft from powerful mob boss Gabriel Baez. Baez orders Maldonado to kill one of his friends as a sign of loyalty, which he reluctantly does. With Baez's help, Maldonado then kills the dirty cops responsible for his father's death.

He is also a strong proponent to the view of a dinosaurian origin of birds.Dyke G.J. & Kaiser G.W., Living Dinosaurs: The Evolutionary History of Modern Birds, John Wiley & Sons, London, 2011. =Research= Dyke's research is concerned with ‚Äúthe evolutionary history of birds and their dinosaurian relatives and encompasses anatomy, phylogenetics, functional morphology, palaeoecology, taphonomy, sedimentology and aerodynamics as well as the analysis and interpretation of large fossil-record datasets.‚Äù That research is ‚Äúgrounded in the fossil record,‚Äù but ‚Äúdraws extensively on living animals.‚Äù He has described himself as ‚Äúemphasising and building three over-arching themes,‚Äù namely: #Quantifying dinosaur biodiversity in geological time with emphasis on fossils from southern England; #Birds survivorship at the end-Cretaceous and the evolution of modern avifaunas; #Flight evolution and refinement in the context of global climate change. He has published in Scientific American, Science, Nature, as well as in leading journals in both Biology and Earth Sciences. He describes his work as being located on ‚Äúthe interface between these two fields.‚Äù In 1999, Dyke and a colleague reported that while the ‚Äútraditional view, based largely on the fossil record,‚Äù was that most modern birds ‚Äúdid not appear until the Tertiary, after the end-Cretaceous extinction event,‚Äù new molecular divergence data ‚Äúsuggested that most, or all, of the major clades were present in the Cretaceous2,3.‚Äù In a 2002 article, Dyke and a colleague reported that recent data had yielded ‚Äú[d]ramatic new perceptions of the life history, growth and development of early birds.‚Äù Dyke and three colleagues reported in 2005 that while there has been considerable uncertainty as to the reliability of the fossil record of Mesozoic birds, their own analysis had gone ‚Äúsome way towards‚Äù resolving the uncertainty.http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/benton/reprints/2005fountaine.pdf In 2005, the Times of London quoted Dyke as saying that ‚Äúfossil evidence that [predatory] dinosaurs were feathered is now 'irrefutable'.‚Äù In a 2007 article, Dyke and a colleague described a ‚Äúsmall galliform bird from the Lower Eocene Fur Formation in northwestern Denmark.‚Äù In 2008, Dyke was one of a team of researchers who discovered ‚Äúthe oldest known parrot fossil ‚Äì a wing bone from a bird that lived 55 million years ago.‚Äù The parrot was discovered in Denmark, where at the time the climate was tropical. The new species was named Mopsitta tanta, or the Danish Blue Parrot.http://www.avibushistoriae.com/Two_New_Parrots.htm Dyke and three colleagues reported in 2009 ‚Äúthat low-cost analysis of satellite image data (derived from Landsat ETM+) can be used efficiently for the ‚Äòremote prospecting‚Äô of a large field area.‚Äùhttp://www.uv.es/pe/2009_2/164/164.pdf As reported in 2009, Dyke and four colleagues discovered the first dinosaur fossil ever to be found in Bulgaria. In 2010, Dyke and a colleague reported in Science Magazine on the flight capabilities of fossil birds Archaeopteryx and Confuciusornis. In a 2010 Scientific American article entitled ‚ÄúWinged Victory: Modern Birds Now Found to Have Been Contemporaries of Dinosaurs,‚Äù Dyke reported that ‚Äú[m]odern birds, long thought to have arisen only after the dinosaurs perished, turn out to have lived alongside them.‚Äù Noting that ‚Äúmolecular studies and a smattering of equivocal fossil finds have hinted that modern birds might have‚Äù originated earlier than previously thought, recent analysis of ‚Äúfossils of ancient modern birds confirm this earlier origin, raising the question of why these birds, but not the archaic ones, survived the mass extinction.‚Äùhttp://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=winged- victory In a 2011 Scientific American article entitled ‚ÄúThe Dinosaur Baron of Transylvania,‚Äù Dyke wrote about Franz Nopcsa, ‚Äúa turn-of-the-century Transylvanian nobleman who loved fossils,‚Äù who ‚Äúis well known for having discovered and described some of the first dinosaurs from central Europe,‚Äù and whose ‚Äútheories about dinosaur evolution turn out to have been decades ahead of their time.....Only in the past few years, with new fossil discoveries, have scientists begun to appreciate how right he was.‚Äù Also in 2011, Dyke and Evgeny Kurochkin described Eostrix tsaganica found in Mongolia, the first find of this primitive owl in Asia. It was reported in January 2013 that a European/Chinese team including Dyke had discovered ‚Äúa new bird-like dinosaur from the Jurassic period,‚Äù which challenged ‚Äúwidely accepted theories on the origin of flight.‚Äù He was quoted as saying that the discovery ‚Äúsheds further doubt on the theory that the famous fossil Archaeopteryx ‚Äì or ‚Äòfirst bird‚Äô as it is sometimes referred to ‚Äì was pivotal in the evolution of modern birds.‚Äù In a 2013 article for Nature, Dyke and five colleagues reported that while the ‚Äú[d]iscovery of feathered theropod dinosaurs in China during the past two decades have prompted dramatic revisions of our ideas of the evolution of birds and the origins of flight ‚Äî including the suggestion that the iconic fossil Archaeopteryx might have lain some distance from the ancestry of modern birds,‚Äù a new fossil discovery ‚Äúrestores Archaeopteryx as an early diverging avialan.‚Äù Dyke was part of a British/Romanian/Brazilian team that discovered ‚Äúa new kind of pterosaur, a flying reptile from the time of the dinosaurs,‚Äù as reported in February 2013. Dyke was quoted as saying that experts have long disagreed about ‚Äúthe lifestyle and behaviour of azhdarchids,‚Äù and that the new discovery supported the contention ‚Äúthat azhdarchids walked through forests, plains and other places in search of small animal prey.‚Äùhttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/02/130204111548.htm In 2013, Dyke and seven colleagues reported ‚Äúthe first evidence for a nesting colony of Mesozoic birds on Gondwana.‚Äù In 2013, Dyke and three colleagues described ‚Äúa new taxon of medium-sized...azhdarchid pterosaur from the Upper Cretaceous Transylvanian Basin (Sebe≈ü Formation) of Romania.‚Äù It was ‚Äúthe most complete European azhdarchid yet reported.‚Äù In a 2013 article, Dyke and two colleagues argued that bone measurements ‚Äúcannot be used to distinguish flight modes in extant birds, and so cannot be used to infer flight mode in fossil forms,‚Äù and that ‚Äúmore data from fossil birds...is required if we are to be able to predict the flight modes of extinct birds.‚Äù =Current research= As of September 2013, Dyke's current research subjects were the anatomy and evolution of Lower Eocene birds, the Cretaceous palaeoenvironments of Transylvania, the evolution of wings in dinosaurs and birds, Pterosaur flight biomechanics, the diversity and disparity of Cretaceous birds, and the evolution and diversity of galliform birds. At the time he was working on books about fossils of the Carpathian Basin and about ‚ÄúNopcsa, the Dinosaur Baron of Transylvania.‚Äù Other professional activities Dyke is on the Editorial Board of PLOS ONE, is Editor-in-Chief of Historical Biology, and is on the Reviewing editorial board of Cell Reports.

Archibald Hugh Conway Fargus MA (15 December 1878 ‚Äì 6 October 1963) was an English cricketer who was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm fast. He was also a scholar and clergyman and served in the Royal Navy. Early life and cricket Born in Clifton, Bristol,\\"Clifton College Register\\" Muirhead, J.A.O. p167: Bristol; J.W Arrowsmith for Old Cliftonian Society; April, 1948 Fargus was the son of novelist Frederick John Fargus and Amy Spark. He was later educated at Clifton College and Haileybury before attending Pembroke College, Cambridge. Fargus made his first-class debut for Gloucestershire in the 1900 County Championship against Middlesex. In that same season he also made his first-class debut for Cambridge University against Surrey. Fargus played first-class cricket for both teams in 1900 and 1901, typically playing for Cambridge University in the months of June and July and for Gloucestershire in August. He played 12 matches for the University, from whom he won a Cambridge Blue in 1900 and 1901, and 15 for Gloucestershire, plus one match for the Gentlemen in 1900. Overall, Fargus was a superior batsman while playing for Cambridge University, scoring 292 runs at a batting average of 16.22, plus scoring his only half century in first-class cricket, a score of 61. For Gloucestershire he batted in 27 innings, scoring 210 runs at an average of 9.13. With the ball, the reverse was true; his bowling with Gloucestershire was more successful. For the county he took 33 wickets at a bowling average of 26.54, with best figures of 7/55, one of two five wicket hauls he took. His best figures came in his debut match against Middlesex, with the 7/55 coming in the Middlesex second-innings and following on from the 5/32 in their first-innings. These figures were the best by any player on debut in the County Championship at that time, it would be a record which would stand for 14 years, until it was beaten by Cec Parkin who took match figures of 14/99 on his Lancashire County Cricket Club debut in 1914 Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 2005, p. 784. In contrast, for the University he took 27 wickets at an average of 41.66, with best figures of 4/35. His first-class career ended at the end of the 1901 season. However, in 1904 he represented Devon in that season's Minor Counties Championship, playing a single match against Glamorgan. Outside of cricket, Fargus played rugby for Devon. Naval career and later life Fargus was ordained by the Bishop of Winchester in 1906. He initially took up duties at Forton, Hampshire. He joined the Royal Navy in 1907 as a Chaplain, serving aboard HMS Encounter from 1908‚Äì1910, in 1910 and 1911, in 1911 and 1912, in 1912 and in 1912 and 1913. In 1913 he was appointed as the vicar of Askham Richard, Yorkshire. In order to take up this post he allowed to withdraw from the Royal Navy with a gratuity. Later in the First World War he rejoined the navy, where he served as a Temporary Chaplain on board and was seemingly present during its sinking in the battle Battle of Coronel in the Pacific. Indeed, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack included an obituary for him in its 1915 edition. But by a quirk of fate he missed the train and was thus unable to board the ship, instead being posted to another. He remained a Temporary Chaplain until 1919. He later became Chancellor of St. Paul‚Äôs Anglican Cathedral in Valletta, Malta from 1919 to 1923. Later in 1923, Fargus took the post of Chaplain in Huelva, Spain, a position he held until 1925. By 1941 he was resident at Horfield rectory in Bristol. He died in Eastville, Bristol on 6 October 1963. Unlike his 'death' in 1914, his actual death was not reported in the 1964 Wisden Cricketers' Almanack and his obituary did not appear until the 1994 edition.

He is the founder, current executive chairman and owner, and former CEO of Reputation.com, Inc. a Redwood City technology company that sends take-down requests to websites hosting embarrassing content, attempts to influence search results, and help clients obtain positive reviews. He advocates that the internet be cautious to respect the privacy and reputations of people and businesses. Career Fertik earned a degree from Harvard Law School. While earning his undergraduate, he co-founded and sold a software company called TruExchange. After he graduated, he served as a clerk for the Sixth Circuit of the United States Court of Appeals. During his position with the court, he was reading media stories about cyber-bullying and the effect it had on people's lives in the real world. According to Fertik, \\"I noticed something about the Internet that really bothered me: Anyone could say anything about anybody with impunity. Right or wrong, true or false, outdated or misleading ‚Äî it didn‚Äôt matter.\\" He turned down a job offer he had in Washington and moved to Silicon Valley to start Reputation.com (formerly ReputationDefender) in 2006. Reputation.com issues take down requests to websites hosting content that is embarrassing to their client. At a larger cost it attempts to influence search rankings to obtain a higher position for positive information or a lower position for negative content. Reputation.com raised $67 million in venture capital. Originally it was intended for parents that wanted to protect their children's online reputation, but it ended up being professionals that were primarily interested in the service. As social media became more prevalent, it introduced more features for it. Fertik became known for pioneering the field of online reputation management. According to Forbes he \\"more or less invented the sector of online reputation management.\\" He was named \\"Entrepreneur of the Year\\" by TechAmerica in 2010 and became a regular commenter on internet privacy issues in national broadcast media. In 2010 Fertik co-authored a book with David Thompson entitled \\"Wild West 2.0: How to Protect and Restore Your Online Reputation on the Untamed Social Frontier\\". Fertik is on the Global Agenda Council on Internet Security for the World Economic Forum. He also blogs for the Harvard Business Review, and maintains a guest column for Inc. Magazine. Fertik also participates in and provides direction for various advocacy programs. He sits on the Advisory Boards of the Internet Keepsafe Coalition (iKeepSafe) and the Future of Privacy Forum. In 2017, Fertik participated in the mockumentary Bubbleproof from Femto Films. Views Fertik is an advocate for respecting an individual's online privacy. He advocates for either regulation of the internet or raising awareness. Critics of Fertik's business say that it inhibits free speech or allows wealthy individuals to manipulate search results and marginalize their critics. Over time, the public's views on privacy have grown more aligned with Fertik's perspective. In an interview with The New York Times, Fertik said that companies should not manufacture fake reviews, because it is \\"inherently sleazy\\" and illegal. Instead, business can generate legitimate positive reviews from actual customers. He also advises that companies should respond to negative comment calmly. Regarding Twitter, he stated that \\"For all its trendiness, social media is often a waste of their time.\\" References External links * Michael Fertik's personal website 1978 births Living people American computer businesspeople American technology chief executives Harvard Law School alumni Businesspeople from New York City Harvard College alumni ","title":"Michael Fertik"},{"id":"31508894","text":"1,1‚Äô-diethyl-2,2‚Äô-cyanine chloride (pseudoisocyanine chloride, PIC chloride) Fiber-like J-aggregates (yellow) and light-guiding microcrystallites (red) A J-aggregate is a type of dye with an absorption band that shifts to a longer wavelength (bathochromic shift) of increasing sharpness (higher absorption coefficient) when it aggregates under the influence of a solvent or additive or concentration as a result of supramolecular self-organisation.W√ºrthner, F., Kaiser, T. E. and Saha-M√∂ller, C. R. (2011), J-Aggregates: From Serendipitous Discovery to Supramolecular Engineering of Functional Dye Materials. Angewandte Chemie International Edition, 50: 3376‚Äì3410.

M√§rz 1937 Scheibe and Jelley independently observed that in ethanol the dye PIC chloride has two broad absorption maxima at around 19,000 cm‚àí1 and 20,500 cm‚àí1 (526 and 488 nm respectively) and that in water a third sharp absorption maximum appears at 17,500 cm‚àí1 (571 nm). The intensity of this band further increases on increasing concentration and on adding sodium chloride. In the oldest aggregation model for PIC chloride the individual molecules are stacked like a roll of coins forming a supramolecular polymer but the true nature of this aggregation phenomenon is still under investigation. Analysis is complicated because PIC chloride is not a planar molecule. The molecular axis can tilt in the stack creating a helix pattern. In other models the dye molecules orient themselves in a brickwork, ladder, or staircase fashion. In various experiments the J-band was found to split as a function of temperature, liquid crystal phases were found with concentrated solutions and CryoTEM revealed aggregate rods 350 nm long and 2.3 nm in diameter. J-aggregate dyes are found with polymethine dyes in general, with cyanines, merocyanines, squaraine and perylene bisimides. Certain œÄ-conjugated macrocycles, reported by Swager and co-workers at MIT, were also found to form J-aggregates and exhibited exceptionally high photoluminescence quantum yields.

J. Detmold in The Fables of Aesop (1909) The Trees and the Bramble is a composite title which covers a number of fables of similar tendency, ultimately deriving from a Western Asian literary tradition of debate poems between two contenders.Dispute poems and dialogues in the ancient and mediaeval Near East, ed's G. J. Reinink, Herman L. J. Vanstiphout, Leuven, Belgium 1991 Other related plant fables include The Oak and the Reed and The Fir and the Bramble. The fables One of Aesop's Fables, numbered 213 in the Perry Index, concerns a pomegranate and an apple tree debating which is the most beautiful. In the midst of it, a bramble bush in a nearby hedge appeals to them, 'Dear friends, let us put a stop to our quarrel.' The account is brief and leads to the humorous moral that 'when there is a dispute among sophisticated people, then riff-raff also try to act important'.Aesopica The story was for a long time limited to Greek sources and, though versions of a similar debate between other trees gained some currency in the 16th and 17th centuries, it soon fell out of favour again. In 1564 the Neo-Latin poet Hieronymus Osius versified the story under the title \\"The Apple and the Pear\\", with the moral that the humble become overweening when the great fall out.Phryx Aesopus, fable 223 Charles Hoole's influential Aesop's fables English and Latin (1657) included it under the title \\"Of the Peach-tree and the Apple-tree\\" with the moral that \\"meaner men do oftentimes settle the controversies of their betters\\",Fable 123 and is followed more or less by Roger L'Estrange, who concludes that \\"Every thing would be thought greater in the World than it is\\".Fable 136 An idea of what such a debate would have been like is gained from a related poem of 116 lines by the Alexandrian poet Callimachus (Iamb 4), which is given the separate number of 439 in the Perry Index. There a laurel and an olive tree are in dispute concerning their relative importance and when a bramble attempts to bring peace it is rebuked by the furious laurel.There is an analysis of the poem in Arnd Kerkhecker's Callimachus' Book of Iambi, Oxford University Press, 1999, pp.83-115 It has been observed that the poem is in the tradition of poetical disputes of Sumerian origin that spread throughout the Near East.West, Martin L., Near Eastern material in Hellenistic and Roman literature, Harvard Studies in Classical Philology 73 (1969), pp.113-134 In the oldest form of these, the two in debate call for a judgment on which is superior from a presiding god. An echo of that tradition, in which the trees instance their chief useful characteristics, is found in the earliest evidence of a fable among Jews occurring in the Hebrew Bible. The story is told to illustrate the folly of electing a ruler rather than relying on non-hereditary 'judges'. When the trees decide to seek a king, they offer the throne to the olive, the fig and the vine; each in turn refuses, preferring to keep to their own fruitful role. Only the bramble accepts, and makes threats of what will happen to those that do not accept him (Judges 9.8-15).Judges chapter 9 in Wikisource The story began to be included in European fable collections in the Middle Ages.Aesopica It also appears among Giovanni Maria Verdizotti's Cento favole morali (1570)Fable 93, pp.272-5 Available on Google Books and Robert Dodsley placed it at the start of his Select fables of Esop and other fabulists (1764) with the comment at the end that ‚Äòthe most worthless persons are generally the most presumptuous‚Äô.Available online, pp.3-5 Dating from the time of Aesop in about 500 BCE, what appears to be an excerpt of an actual West Asian literary debate between a bramble and a pomegranate is inserted in the Aramaic story of Ahiqar that was only discovered at the start of the last century. There the bramble reproaches the pomegranate for the thorns that hinder people reaching its fruit in a display of pot calling the kettle black. But a commentator on the text remarks that its context in the midst of a discussion of the distinction between the bad and the just man gives it a new meaning. The pomegranate, bearing the fruits of righteousness, arms itself against those who would misuse them, for 'a man knows not what is in his fellow's heart. So when a good man sees a wicked man, let him not join with him on a journey or be a neighbour to him - a good man with a bad man. The bramble sent to the pomegranate tree saying, ‚ÄúWhat good is the multitude of thy thorns to him that toucheth thy fruit?\\" The pomegranate tree answered and said to the bramble, \\"Thou art all thorns to him that toucheth thee.\\" All perish that assault the righteous man.'P.

It is the first album by Slough Feg to be released by label Profound Lore Records. A vinyl pressing of the album was released on February 21, 2011 by Cruz del Sur Music. The album was remastered for vinyl release by Justin Weis to play at high resolution (24 bit/96 kHz .wav). Promotion Leading up to the album's release, Mike Scalzi debuted a series of articles on popular metal blog Invisible Oranges. These pieces, entitled \\"Bullpen Bulletins\\" featured Scalzi philosophizing about the current state of the metal scene, particularly about the elements that he felt are causing stagnation of musical creativity. While some readers saws these postings as too critical of the genre, Scalzi reiterated that by voicing his opinions he was trying to stir up debate and engage in discussion with fans of differing viewpoints. Regarding the seemingly harsh nature of some of his comments, Scalzi affirmed, \\"In fact, I am definitely a MUSICAL SNOB!! How can one not be in today‚Äôs musical climate?!\\"Scalzi, Mike. , \\"Invisible Oranges\\", October 26, 2010, accessed April 29, 2011. In total, Scalzi contributed four \\"Bullpen Bulletins,\\" including two after The Animal Spirits was released. While Scalzi comments tangentially about certain aspects of the album, such as Bob Wright's inclusion as a guest vocalist, the subject matter of the articles are decidedly not focused on the album itself. These articles also received a moderate amount of praise from the heavy metal journalistic community. On his NPR-based blog, heavy metal journalist Lars Gotrich defended the frankness of Scalzi's writing, saying, \\"It's a damning clarion call for quality control, and while Scalzi may come off as a curmudgeonly metal purist, he's really just a bleeding heart.\\"Gotrich, Lars. , \\"NPR.org\\", December 30, 2010, accessed April 29, 2011. While no named tour was organized to promote the album's release, Slough Feg organized several shows in 2011 along the west coast and in the Midwest. Several European festival dates are also schedule to take place during the summer of 2011. Stylistic Elements According to lead singer and guitarist Mike Scalzi, the album's title refers to an Aristotelian theory of perception that postulated a fluid called \\"animal spirits\\" that flowed through the veins of human beings, carrying information of perception in order to be stored in the heart., \\"Profound Lore\\", accessed April 29, 2011. Unlike many of Slough Feg's albums that are united under a single concept or theme, the songs on The Animal Spirits cover many different subject with their lyrical content, such as \\"Medieval Catholic theology,\\" \\"horror themes,\\" and \\"frustration, misery and madness.\\" In an interview with Adam Kohrman of The Metal Crypt, Scalzi revealed that some of his ideas for lyrics come from his experience as a professor of philosophy. Specifically addressing the lyrics to the song \\"95 Thesis,\\" Scalzi said, \\"It's all just Martin Luther, and putting the different things together that you've read about what he did [for a lecture], and lyrics come [from that process]. . . . So then because you're going through that process of reconfiguring it, making it into a form that people can understand more clearly and all that. Naturally, that's the same process you go through in songwriting.\\"Kohrman, Adam. , \\"The Metal Crypt\\", December 22, 2010, accessed April 29, 2011. The Animal Spirits is the first Slough Feg album to exclusively feature art done by lead singer and guitarist Mike Scalzi. The rough-looking, stylized priest that appears on the cover is a departure from the more intricate, fantasy- and sci-fi-inspired artwork featured on previous releases. In a November 2010 interview, Scalzi commented on the choice of not getting a professional artist, saying, \\"[T]hat‚Äôs how the music looks to me. The scratchy pen and ink, that‚Äôs how it looks to me. That‚Äôs how Slough Feg music always looks to me. We‚Äôve always had artwork that‚Äôs too modernized, too slick.

Griffin also gave a glowing appraisal of Scalzi's vocals, saying in summation, \\"Frankly, he's never sounded better.\\" Adam Kohrman, another reviewer from The Metal Crypt, gave The Animal Spirits a slightly lower, but still favorable, score of four and one-quarter out of five. Kohrman highlighted a stylistic shift from earlier albums by pointing out that this release \\"is more of a gritty record made with sheer emotion mixed with punk-like rawness\\" and that the \\"epic themes that marked their earlier work are close to gone.\\"Kohrman, Adam. , \\"The Metal Crypt\\", November 16, 2011, accessed April 29, 2011.

Plot The film's title character is an insurance broker who lives a quiet, unassuming existence -- and who secretly keeps a 10-year- old boy called Wolfgang in his soundproof basement. He sexually abuses the boy, but they otherwise have something of a father‚Äìson relationship. In the evenings, after Michael locks the door and closes the blinds, Wolfgang is allowed into the living room for dinner and to watch TV. When in hospital after an accident, Michael is in a hurry to be released and return to Wolfgang. When Wolfgang gets sick Michael digs a grave in the woods, in case Wolfgang dies. However, he recovers. The boy writes a letter to his parents, to be mailed by Michael, but Michael does not send it and lies to Wolfgang, saying his parents don't want him back. Sometimes he takes the boy on a pleasure trip outside the town, where people do not know Michael. On one occasion he goes on a skiing trip with friends for multiple days, leaving extra food for Wolfgang, who has water, a toilet, simple cooking facilities and a TV in his room. Seeing that Wolfgang is lonely, Michael promises to bring another child for company. Together they assemble a bunk bed in advance. Michael attempts to abduct another boy by luring him away, but the boy is called back by his father, who scolds him for walking off with a stranger. Michael tells Wolfgang that he did not succeed in providing him a friend. One day Wolfgang throws boiling water into Michael's face, nearly blinding him, but does not succeed in escaping.

In addition to gaining note in the spiritual community, Segal became a model case of the dissociative condition known as depersonalization disorder (DPD). Along her journey some therapists formally diagnosed her with DPD, while others did not have clear explanations. Two years after her shift into a \\"sense of unity\\", Segal relapsed into the uncomfortable state of constant anxiety she had first experienced. At this point she returned to exploring psychological themes from her childhood which included recovered memories of abuse and persistent migraines. Shortly thereafter, in 1997, Segal's health began rapidly deteriorating, and she was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor. She died two months later that year, leaving many questions about the root cause of her experience unanswered. Early life Segal's childhood was filled with attempts to evoke a state of psychological detachment from her identity. She experienced moments which she described as \\"vastness\\" after repeating her name as a mantra. She started studying Transcendental Meditation and found the experience similarly awakening, but left the organization when she began to dislike the rigidity of the format. Segal moved to California and received a degree in English from the UC Berkeley. She then moved to Paris, where she had a daughter, and where her marked depersonalization experience began. In the fall of 1986 she enrolled in the John F. Kennedy University in their clinical psychology masters programSegal, 1996, p.89. transferring to the Wright Institute's PhD program in the fall of 1987. She completed her dissertation and received her doctorate in Psychology in 1991.ProQuest, Dissertation Database, ref# AAT9127791 Enlightenment experience One day in 1982, while boarding a bus in Paris, the 27-year-old Segal experienced a sudden shift in her consciousness. She described the experience in her book, Collisions With the Infinite: > \\"I lifted my right foot to step up into the bus and collided head-on with an > invisible force that entered my awareness like a silently exploding stick of > dynamite, blowing the door of my usual consciousness open and off its > hinges, splitting me in two. In the gaping space that appeared, what I had > previously called 'me' was forcefully pushed out of its usual location > inside me into a new location that was approximately a foot behind and to > the left of my head. 'I' was now behind my body looking out at the world > without using the body's eyes.\\"Segal, 1996, p. 49. Segal described this first period of her experience as \\"witnessing\\", since she was aware of herself but also critically detached from it. This was tremendously unpleasant for her, full of anxiety and fear: > The moment the eyes opened the next morning, the mind exploded in worry. Is > this insanity? Pscyhosis? Schizophrenia? Is this what people call a nervous > breakdown? Depression? What happened? And would it ever stop?... The mind > was in agony as it tried valiantly to make sense of something it could never > comprehend, and the body responded to the anguish of the mind by locking > itself into survival mode, adrenaline pumping, senses fine-tuned, finding > and responding to the threat of annihilation in every moment.\\" Having a background in meditation, Segal questioned whether this break could be the first step in a positive journey but dismissed it: > \\"The thought did arise that perhaps this experience of witnessing was the > state of Cosmic Consciousness Maharishi had described long before as the > first stage of awakened awareness. But the mind instantly discarded this > possibility because it seemed impossible that the hell realm I was > inhabiting could have anything to do with Cosmic Consciousness.\\" In the years after her break Segal continued to function with seeming normalcy, completing a doctorate in psychology at the Wright Institute.Segal, 1996, p. 102. She continued to feel completely depersonalized, literally as if her own name did not refer to anyone. She described it as if her \\"... body, mind, speech, thoughts, and emotions were all empty; they had no ownership, no person behind them. I was utterly bereft of all my previous notions of reality\\".Segal, 1996, p. 144; as quoted in Simeon & Abugel, 2006, p. 63. Segal's state of mind terrified her, and she sought advice from California's Buddhist community. Buddhism intentionally cultivates loss of ego and a sense of emptiness and oneness, and spiritual teachers tried to help Segal see her condition positively. Several even congratulated her: \\"This is a wonderful experience. It has to stay eternally with you. This is perfect freedom. You have become (moksha) of the realized sages,\\" read one letter she received.Segal, 1996, p. 122; as quoted in Simeon & Abugel, 2006, p. 145. Twelve years after her initial break, Segal dramatically entered another phase of her experience, centered around a sense of unity of perception between herself and the world: > \\"In the midst of a particularly eventful week, I was driving north to meet > some friends when I suddenly became aware that I was driving through myself. > For years there had been no self at all, yet here on this road everything > was myself, and I was driving through me to arrive where I already was. In > essence, I was going nowhere because I was everywhere already. The infinite > emptiness I knew myself to be was now apparent as the infinite substance of > everything I saw.\\" This sense of cognitive and spiritual oneness remained with Segal for two years, up through the publishing of Collisions in 1996. Spirituality =Analysis= Segal's story also received attention by many writers and publications. Collisions was reviewed by Yoga Journal magazine in 1997, the reviewer writing, \\"This frank and engaging account is a fascinating view of the unfolding of a realization without a spiritual practice or intention.\\" The 2004 book The Biology of Transcendence tried to characterize Segal's state of mind during her second phase of union: \\"[It was] fusion with 'the vastness' and her discovery that the vastness perceived its universe through her own sensory system, which was at that point the sensory system of the vastness itself... [she] essentially perceived the universe perceiving itself, but without her, that perception did not exist.\\" A 2008 graduate dissertation by Arvin Paul used Segal's experience as an example of \\"Shift/s in the Locus of Identity Upon Initial Awakening\\", \\"a shift from the conventional sense of self to the uninvolved witness, and/or allpervasive presence, and/or boundless spaciousness, and/or pure awareness, and/or Being, and/or emptiness/void, and/or the Self, and/or the simple recognition of nonseparateness.\\" Paul quotes Segal: > \\"That recognition doesn‚Äôt change who you really are, ever. You have always > been That. And yes, there is a way that the Vastness Itself can perceive > Itself so directly, without any fogging or shadowing or taking anything else > to be who you are. I guess you could call it a waking up, but what seems > most important to convey is that this is who everyone is all the time > whether the direct awareness of it is there or not.\\" Segal was interviewed for the chapter devoted to her in the 2003 book The Awakening West by Lynn Marie Lumiere and John Lumiere-Wins. =Segal's own teaching= After Segal's second shift she began sharing her insights with the public and with a group of psychologists in a \\"training group\\". She says, \\"I started training groups for therapists because I want this to be conveyed to those who are in the business of trying to help end suffering\\". She wants people to see \\"things to be what they are\\" instead of pathologizing \\"a broad range of human experience\\".Segal, 1996, p.167. Experience with depersonalization disorder After her initial break, Segal sought to determine what had happened to her and consulted various psychologists and psychiatrists.Segal, 1996, p. 101. Though some had no clear explanation for the experience, one labelled it depersonalization disorder,Segal, 1996, p.88. stating \\"I don't know what else it could be but symptoms of depersonalization\\". Segal went on to read up on depersonalization, derealization, and dissociation, finding some related to her experience but none were a perfect fit and they ultimately failed to capture the sensation of lacking a self in conjunction with normal, or even improved functioning.Segal, 1996, p.92-3. Segal's story was profiled in the 2006 book Feeling Unreal: Depersonalization Disorder and the Loss of the Self by Daphne Simeon and Jeffrey Abugel. It was suggested for a book review in The Journal of the American Psychological Association that rather than representing depersonalization, Segal's experiences may represent a dissociative disorder. The 2011 book Stranger to My Self: Inside Depersonalization; the Hidden Epidemic by Jeffrey Abugel contextualized Segal's experience as following: \\"Sometimes, however, even a person well-versed in eastern philosophy may find themselves depersonalized in a way that seems to be anything but part of the road to enlightenment.\\" Stranger noted that Segal's reportedly sudden depersonalization experience was part of a longer‚Äîpossibly compulsive‚Äîhistory of searching for and at times experiencing that phenomenon: > As a young girl, Segal would sometimes repeat her own name in her head over > and over. Eventually, \\"a threshold was crossed and the identity, as that > name, broke like a ship released suddenly from its mooring to float > untethered on the ocean waves... Vastness appeared... There was no person to > whom that name referred, no identity as that name. No one.\\" Then came fear, > eventually followed by a return to normalcy. But the compulsion to do the > same thing once again always returned. Many people with DPD have cited > similar early life incidents. They may involve repeating words until they > lose their meaning, or looking intently in the mirror until an overwhelming > sense of strangeness emerges. Usually these episodes pass, are forgotten, > and remain in the realm of youthful mind games. Yet for Segal, as she became older the episodes became much more prominent rather than less. Segal's autobiography was completed in 1996 and she had begun giving presentations and leading weekly dialogues as well as a \\"training group\\" for therapists. By late spring Segal began having even more intense experiences in which, \\"the vastness became even vaster to itself.\\"Segal, 1996, p. 173-6. The experiences entranced her but became increasingly disruptive. By the end of the summer she was exhausted, and doctors encouraged her to rest. Around the same time, she noticed that the fear from years before had returned. Suzanne spent that fall at her home in Stinson Beach, California. During this period she recovered memories of childhood abuse. Spiritual teacher Stephan Bodian, who counseled Segal during that time wrote, \\"They seemed to explain some of the fear she had experienced during the 10 lonely years of being no one before realizing that she was everything. When I suggested that perhaps the fear originated from a part of herself that was split off or dissociated from conscious awareness, she immediately agreed.\\" Stranger documented this period as a retreat from the earlier spiritual themes that had defined her experience. \\"As a psychologist, she was well tutored in a possible ramification of childhood abuse‚Äîdissociation. Once again, Segal began to perceive things differently, this time from the psychological viewpoint rather than that of transcendent spirituality.\\" Death Segal did not have time to discover what the source of her dramatic shifts in perception had been. By February 1997, at the age of 42, her physical and mental capabilities began to quickly decline. She entered the hospital on February 27, and doctors discovered a malignant brain tumor, having surgery but refusing chemotherapy or radiation. On March 10 she married her fianc√© Steve Kruszynski. After the wedding they traveled to Oklahoma to seek out alternative treatments, but Segal's debilitation returned during the trip and they had to return home, and she entered a coma several days later. She died on the morning of Tuesday, April 1. Bodian described her funeral: > Following a Tibetan custom, the body was wrapped in a cloth, surrounded by > flowers, and left untouched for three days. On the third day we sat with her > body as a local rabbi performed a traditional Jewish ceremony at her > mother's request. > > The following Saturday, nearly 100 people gathered to celebrate her life, > appreciate her gifts to us, and share our grief.

It is in Primm Historic Park on the grounds of Boiling Spring Academy, a historic schoolhouse established in 1830. The 15-acre site consists of the remains of a late Mississippian culture mound complex and village roughly dating to 1050-1475 AD. The site, which sits on the western bank of the Little Harpeth River, has five mounds, some used for burial and others, including the largest, were ceremonial platform mounds. The village was abandoned for unknown reasons around 1450. The site is named in honor of Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, the Chief of the Bureau of American Ethnology in 1920, who had visited the site and recognized its potential. While it was partially excavated by the landowner in 1895, archaeologist William E. Myer directed a second, more thorough excavation in October 1920. The report of his findings was published in the Bureau of American Ethnology's Forty-First Annual Report. Many of the artifacts recovered from the site are now housed at the Smithsonian Institution. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 21, 1980, as NRIS number 80003880. Inhabitants Two different groups of people lived at the Fewkes Site. The first group, who built the mounds and left the majority of artifacts, buried their dead with their bodies tightly flexed in hexagonal and circular stone box graves. This was probably achieved by tightly binding the body after death, because the bones appear to be in their proper places. These people appear to have lived in circular houses. This occupation dates to the Mississippian period, between 1000 ‚Äì 1450. A second group moved into the area toward the end of the period. This group buried its dead with the bodies fully extended, on their backs, in rectangular stone box graves. Archaeological research done within the Middle Cumberland River Valley marks a virtual abandonment of the area around 1450. It is unknown what caused this, but the large amount of broken pottery on the floors of their homes may indicate that they were forced to leave in a hurry. This abandonment of the region is part of a larger pattern seen in parts of the Ohio, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Cumberland River valleys known as the \\"Vacant Quarter\\" hypothesis. As of 2010, officials at the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, Division of Archaeology, have been unable to identify modern tribal descendants of the inhabitants of the site. Site description 1920 Map of Fewkes Group There are five mounds at the Fewkes site. Four of them are located opposite of each other on each side of a level town plaza, and the fifth (smallest) mound is situated on the riverbank directly to the north of mound No. 1, outside the town center. (Looking at the site today, the Boiling Spring Schoolhouse now sits between mound No.1 and mound No. 5). Mound No. 1 is the largest at the site, being in height. Remnants of about a dozen house circles were found scattered around the outer edges of the group of mounds, mostly between mounds No.1 and No. 5. The most important houses adjoined mound No. 1 on the northeast side. These are represented on the 1920 map by circles. Traces of a stone box cemetery were also found on the property, not far from the mound complex. =Mound No. 1= Mound No. 1 is the largest mound at the complex and is located on the northern side of the town square. The platform mound is and measures by across. It was left unexcavated in 1920 because of a lack of funding, although archaeologist William Myer believed its use to be ceremonial, and possibly the location of a chief's residence. =Mound No. 2= Pottery found in Mound No. 2, in the 1920 excavation Mound No. 2 is located on the western side of the plaza. It is across from north to south, and across east to west. At the time of excavation it reached high. Less than one-fifth of the area of the mound was excavated; because of this, it is impossible to know the number of structures constructed upon it. The mound was raised in four stages. The first level, at the base of the mound, was the original ground surface of the soil. In this layer, archaeologists discovered a fire bed filled with ashes and broken animal bones, indicating that a structure had existed there before the mound was built over top of it. After the house was torn down, the high mound was constructed in its place. On the second level there is evidence that at least one building, and probably more, were constructed. The floor of this structure was packed down and layered with stone slabs, much like pavement. A small pile of maize and maize meal were also found. In the southwestern segment of the mound were found the ruins of a structure, named by Myer the \\"Sacred Image House\\" because among the items found were the remains of a sacred idol, a shrine, and traces of fire ceremonies. After the buildings were torn down the mound was raised a few more inches for the third construction level. Many items were found on this level, such as a metate and muller, arrowheads, shell tempered pottery, multiple fire beds, and objects made from deer bones. However, the most important was a structure dubbed the \\"House of Mysteries\\". The building was an important civic structure, probably used for sacred rites and town gatherings, and had two rooms. Myers described the floor as being made of \\"black, glossy earth\\". The walls and roof of the building were built using the cane matting technique and an arched roof. The woven cane matting was then covered inside and outside with a coating of clay plaster known as wattle and daub. Inside the building was an altar, complete with an oval altar bowl. The bowl, filled with white, powdery ashes, was made of fired red clay. The fire was allowed to burn without being put out. The structure was eventually destroyed by fire. Mound No. 2 was in constant cultivation for at least 85 years, and as a result, only limited structural evidence exists for the final stage. However, numerous postholes indicate that there was a building constructed atop the mound during this phase. It is also important to note that a few burials from the later group of rectangular stone grave people were found close to the surface of Mound No. 2. These were discovered in 1895, when the farmer who owned the land plowed over them and decided to take a closer look. =Mound No. 3= Stone box grave demonstrating flexed burial Mound No. 3 is a burial mound of the first inhabitants of the Fewkes group. It is a low oval mound on the southwestern corner of the plaza. The mound is about high and by across, but slopes very gradually into the soil, so it is impossible to determine its exact boundaries. Originally, it probably held 10-15 graves, but unfortunately all except two have been destroyed by looters and plowing. These two graves were very different from the usual method of burial during the Mississippian period in the Middle Tennessee region. Typically, the deceased were buried on their backs with their legs fully extended, as in a modern-day burial. The remains found in the two graves from this mound had been buried on their backs with their bodies tightly flexed. Their stone-slab graves were octagonal, hexagonal, or nearly round. When the first grave was opened, the slabs on top were missing and the bones had been slightly disturbed, probably by looters. It was octagonal and made from limestone slabs. Grave goods found with the deceased included five large shell beads and a clay pot. The second grave was similar in size to the first, but it was hexagonal. As with the first grave, it had been disturbed by looters and the body was slightly repositioned. The grave goods found with the second set of remains included a small effigy burial vase (somehow overlooked by the looters) and a mussel shell, which was most likely a spoon. =Mound No. 4= Mound No. 4 is located on the east side of the plaza. It is low and oblong, about high, and by across. No evidence of fire pits, pottery, or graves were discovered in this mound. William Myer believed it to be a natural knoll in the field, given its shape by the removal of soil used for the construction of Mound No. 1. Erosion and years of cultivation have destroyed any evidence of possible of associated structures atop the mound. =Mound No. 5= Mound No. 5 is a small oval mound across and high. It is located about north of Boiling Spring Academy overlooking the bank of the Little Harpeth River. There was no evidence of buildings or burials in this mound, although broken animal bones and pottery fragments were found scattered throughout the soil. Traces of a fire pit and two bone tools were also found. =Structures= Original image of child buried against the fire basin found during a house excavation at Fewkes was removed due to a standing request by Native American tribal members as to not have images of ancestral remains on display to the public. Many saucer-like depressions were discovered around the north side of Mound No. 1 and in an adjoining field that are thought to be the remains of domestic structures. There is also a large number of these depressions to the west of Mound No. 2 and Mound No. 3. These buildings appear to have been made similarly to the ceremonial buildings found on top of the mounds, with cane matting and plastered walls. Objects found in and around these depressions include bear teeth, arrowheads, broken animal bones, traces of plastered walls, stone disks, and a store of yellow ochre that was most likely used as body paint. Upon excavation, one circular depression was found to be a nearly smooth, level, hard-packed floor. In the center of this structure was an upright, stone-slab fire basin, one side of which had been cut out; this was to allow room for the upright stone slab of a child's grave. The child, thought to be about 12 years old, was found buried against the slab, with its head resting within the edges of the bowl. Ashes remained in the bowl and also along the back and top of the child's head, although the bones do not appear to have been burned at all. Graves of two other children, whose stone box graves were also found in and below the floor. =Other burials= Two burials were found about southeast of Mound No. 3. The first was a woman whose body was loosely flexed on her right side. There were no grave goods found. The second burial, located on the woman's right, was simply a pile of bones. There were no grave goods or stone box coffin found in the burial. It is not known if this person had a connection with the deceased woman. Other burials were discovered scattered around the site, from the later group of people who inhabited the area. Grave goods for these burials included conch shells, pottery, spearheads, playing dice crafted from deer bones, and a black stone female statuette. Excavations in 1998 The remains of at least 21 individuals, along with their funerary objects, were removed from the Fewkes group site during a road construction project by the Tennessee Department of Transportation in 1998. Grave goods removed included ceramic ear plugs, effigy jars, projectile points, a drilled dog tooth and a bone awl. As of April 23, 2010, efforts are being made to reinter the culturally unidentifiable remains from the Fewkes site.

Michael O'Brien, Darren Hall and Ellis Sherwood were arrested and spent 11 years in prison before being released. Their conviction in 1988 was largely based on a confession made by Darren Hall that he had acted as a lookout for the others for a \\"robbery that went wrong.\\" In 1999, the Criminal Cases Review Commission ordered an appeal, during which the unreliability of Hall's \\"confession\\" was emphasised, on the basis that he was suffering from antisocial personality disorder at the time the statement was made, and had since retracted it. The conduct of South Wales Police was also questioned, particularly with regard to their interrogations of the suspects. Miscarriage of justice On Friday, 17 December 1999, the Court of Appeal quashed their convictions. Upon his release, Michael O'Brien and Darren Hall announced that they would be taking legal action against South Wales Police, and also called for an inquiry into the police's investigations, pointing to other cases that had recently been overturned on appeal. At this point, O'Brien stated, \\"The only way this is going to come out is to have a full, open public inquiry. If it takes me another 10 years I am going to do it. I am going to become South Wales Police's worst nightmare.\\" In 2001, O'Brien announced that he would be suing South Wales Police. Later that year the Police Complaints Authority stated that no action would be taken against any officers involved in the murder investigation. O'Brien pursued a civil case against South Wales Police alleging malicious prosecution and misfeasance in public office by police officers involved in the case. As a result, in October 2006, O'Brien and Sherwood were given out-of-court settlements of ¬£300,000 and ¬£200,000 respectively by South Wales Police. At the time, these were the biggest out- of-court settlements ever given by an English or Welsh police force. Despite this, O'Brien continued to call for a public inquiry, expressing disappointment at the lack of admission of liability on the part of the police force. O'Brien has also supported Jeremy Bamber, whom he met in prison and is convinced is another victim of a miscarriage of justice.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=r5r3YbKFOFs References External links * Michael O'Brien's website 1987 crimes in the United Kingdom 1987 in Wales 1999 in Wales Crime in Cardiff False confessions Murder in Wales Overturned convictions in the United Kingdom Police misconduct in Wales 1987 murders in the United Kingdom 1980s in Cardiff ","title":"Cardiff Newsagent Three"},{"id":"31509357","text":"Figment was an online community and self-publishing platform for young writers.

They recorded and released two albums, Get the Silver and White Hot in the Black, before changing their name to Comes with the Fall, following the departure of Jeffrey Blount in 1999. History =Formation, Get the Silver and White Hot in the Black (1996-98)= After the demise of his previous band No Walls, William DuVall said he had been branded as someone playing music that was \\"difficult\\" or \\"ahead of its time\\" and he felt compelled to crush that perception as fast and as thoroughly as he could, which he said was essentially the purpose when he formed Madfly, \\"an over-the-top glam-pop group (that) took a complete 180 from his prior efforts.\\" This project marked the first time DuVall would occasionally perform live without a guitar and focus strictly on singing, becoming \\"a full-fledged spectacle of a front man, complete with flashy costumes and body paint.\\" A few months after their formation, Madfly released their debut album Get the Silver towards the end of 1996. Two years later, they put out a second album called White Hot in the Black, featuring the same cover as Get the Silver and a shorter track listing, half of which also appeared on its predecessor. =Transformation into Comes with the Fall (1999-present)= When bassist Jeffrey Blount left the band for medical reasons and was subsequently replaced by Adam Stanger, they quickly changed their name to Comes with the Fall. DuVall felt \\"my personal compass was telling me it was time to drop the mask, pick up the guitar (full-time) and kick out the jams again. It was time to take the music back to a darker, more dynamic place ‚Äî the place I most naturally live ‚Äî while drawing on everything I'd learned over the years with all my bands. It was also time to start writing more directly from the heart again, something I'd put on hold somewhat since No Walls, perhaps as a protection device.\\" Comes with the Fall recorded their self-titled album over an eight-week period from August to October before relocating to Los Angeles, California in February 2000.

Class of accuracy  Measuring devices are labelled for the class of accuracy. This figure is the percentage of the inherent error of the measuring device with respect to full scale deflection. For example, if the class of accuracy is 2 that means an error of 2 volts in a full scale 100 volt reading.Pocket Handbook on Electrical Measurements, Siemens, AG, 1966, p.29  Measurement  In electrical engineering characteristics like current or voltage can be measured by an ammeter, a voltmeter, a multimeter, etc. The ammeter is used in series with the load, so the same current flows through the load and the ammeter. The voltmeter is used in parallel with the load, so the voltage between the two terminals of the load is equal to the voltage between the two terminals of the voltmeter. Ideally the measuring device should not affect the circuit parameters i.e., the internal impedance of the ammeter should be zero (no voltage drop over the ammeter) and the internal impedance of the voltmeter should be infinite (no current through the voltmeter). However, in actual case, ammeters have a low but non zero impedance and voltmeters have a high but not infinite internal impedance. Thus the measured parameters are somewhat altered during the measurements.  Example  Let V be the voltage (EMF) of the source R be the resistance of the load and r be the resistance of the ammeter. The current through the load is I :I=frac{V}{R} When the ammeter is connected in series with the load the current I2 is :I_2=frac{V}{R+r} The difference introduced by the measuring device is then, :Delta I = I-I_2 =frac{Vcdot r}{R^2+Rcdot r}approxfrac{Vcdot r}{R^2} The ratio of the difference to the actual value is Georg Rose: Elektroteknik ve Elektronik Form√ºller (translation: Haluk Erna), ƒ∞nkƒ±lap and Aka Bookhouses, ƒ∞stanbul, 1975, p.175 :frac{Delta I}{I}approxfrac{r}{R}  References  Electronic test equipment Measuring instruments ","title":"Class of accuracy in electrical measurements"},{"id":"31509430","text":"Strubby is a village in the East Lindsey district of Lincolnshire, England.

She served in the Channel, where she engaged in one action that would eventually result in her crew qualifying for the Naval General Service Medal. She grounded in 1811 and her crew had to destroy her before abandoning her. Service history Lieutenant Cornellius Collett commissioned Firm in July or August 1804. On 9 January 1805 she left on a cruise.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 13, p.83. Early in the morning of 24 April 1805, sighted twenty-six French vessels rounding Cap Gris Nez. Honyman immediately ordered , , , , , , , , , , Firm, and to intercept. After a fight of about two hours, Starling and Locust had captured seven armed schuyts in an action within pistol-shot of the shore batteries on Cap Gris Nez.A schuyt was a Dutch flat- bottomed sailboat, broad in the beam, with square stern; usually equipped with leeboards to serve for a keel. The schuyts were all of 25 to 28 tons burthen, and carried in all 117 soldiers and 43 seamen under the command of officers from the 51st Infantry Regiment. The French convoy had been bound for Ambleteuse from Dunkirk. On the British side the only casualty was one man wounded on Archer. The seven schyuts were: *Schuyt No. 52, under the command of a Sub-Lieutenant of Infantry Loriol, armed with three 24-pounders; *Schuyt No. 48, under the command of A. Joron of the 51st the Infantry, armed with two 6-pounders, one 24-pounder and one brass howitzer; *Schuyt No. 57, under the command of Lieutenant Loriol of 51st Infantry, armed with one 24-pounder and two 6-pounders; *Schuyt No. 45 under the command of Sub-Lieutenant Litner of the 51st Infantry, armed with one 24-pounder, one 12-pounder and one 6-pounder; *Schuyt No. 3. under the command of Mr. Calder, the senior commander, who left her before the British took possession of her; *Schuyt No. 54, under the command of Sub-Lieutenant Bragur of the 51st Infantry, armed with one 24-pounder and two 6-pounders; *Schuyt No.43, Sub Lieutenant Billa of the 51st Infantry, armed with one 24-pounder and two 6-pounders. The next day Archer brought in two more schuyts, No.s 44 and 58, each armed with one 24-pounder and two 12-pounders. On 25 April 1805 Railleur towed eight of the French schuyts into the Downs. Starling, which had received a great deal of damage, followed Railleur in. As part of the British squadron, Firm shared in the prize money for eight Dutch armed schuyts (No.'s 43, 44, 45, 48, 52, 54, 57, and 58) and the unarmed Transport No.3. At the end of April 1806 Firm detained and sent into Dover both the Danish galiot Mercurius, and the Prussian Mercurius.Lloyd's List, no.4049, - accessed 2 March 2015. On 28 August 1807, Firm, still under Collett's command, captured the Dutch vessel Baer. Firm was paid off later that year. Lieutenant Henry Montressor recommissioned her in April 1808. Lieutenant John Little assumed command of Firm in August 1808. She was under the orders of Commodore Philippe d'Auvergne, and was stationed at Guernsey. There he helped people secretly communicating with supporters of the House of Bourbon.Marshall (1835), Vol. 4, Part 2, p.73-4. arshall (1835), Vol. 4, Part 2, p. 73-4. On 6 January 1809 Firm captured St Jean and Amies. Ten months later, on 15 October 1809 Firm captured the Danish galiot Dageraag. On 20 April 1810 the boats of Firm, , and , under the command of Lieutenant Hodgkins of Firm, and Mr Lagaw, 2nd Master of Sharpshooter, cut out the French privateer cutter Alcide from the mouth of the Pirou River, where she had taken refuge after the British vessels had chased her. Alcide was moored under the protection of 400 troops on shore, who kept up an incessant fire while the boarding party carried her. Alcide had thrown her four 4-pounder guns overboard during the chase to lighten her. One man was killed and another wounded, both from Firm.{refnFrench records show Alcide as being from from Bordeaux and commissioned in 1808 under a Captain Brun, with 30 men and 4 guns. The French records report that she was sunk on 30 April 1810 by HMS Surey [sic] off Granville.group=Note}} In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with the clasps \\"Firm 24 April 1810\\" and \\"Surly 24 April 1810\\", to all survivors of the action. Firm was at Jersey in July. There Little saved a marine by jumping into the water to rescue him. In October 1810 Firm detained and sent into Portsmouth Christiana Elizabeth, Hamphall, master, a Swedish vessel sailing from Buenos Ayres.Lloyd's List, no. 4505, - accessed 2 March 2015. On 12 March 1811 Firm and were off the √éle de Batz, with the rest of the British blockading squadron hull down on the horizon. Firm and Challenger sighted two strange sails, which turned out to be the French frigates Pr√©gel and Revanche. Challenger sent Firm to carry the news to the nearest British port, while trying to sail so as to draw the French vessels towards the rest of the British squadron. After a chase of three hours and the loss of two men killed on Challenger, the French frigates succeeded in capturing her; they then evaded the British squadron and took Challenger into Le Conquet. On 28 June 1811, in company with the , Firm attacked two praams off Granville. The praams were attempting to drive off British boats that were reconnoitering, but were then unable to return to harbour. The praams were in water too shallow for Firm to approach and she was unable to engage them with much effect. The following night, while wearing round to sail out of Cancalle Bay, Firm grounded at the top of high water. Her crew set her on fire to avoid the French capturing her. Fylla took Lieutenant Little, his officers, and crew to Jersey.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 26, pp.53-4. A court martial acquitted him of blame.

The film is the last silent film directed by Lewis Milestone, the last silent performance by Gary Cooper, the last silent performance by Germany's Emil Jannings, and the only onscreen pairing of Cooper and Jannings. It is considered a lost film. Plot Swiss peasant girl Vroni (Esther Ralston) is having a secret summer romance with Viennese artist Andre Frey (Gary Cooper). When Andre later returns to Switzerland, he learns that Vroni has been forced to marry wealthy burgomeister Poldi Moser (Emil Jannings). Explaining Andre's appearance, Vroni introduces him as a young man who has just lost his sweetheart, and in sympathy, Poldi invites Andre to be a guest in his house. Several times over the next few years Andre visits, during which time Poldi and Vroni have two children. Andre is overwrought by his repressed feelings toward Vroni, and after seven years, begs her to run off with him. She refuses, but agrees to one last tryst. While speeding down a dangerous run on a toboggan together, Vroni is killed and Andre fatally injured. Poldi learns the truth of the relationship while attending Vroni's funeral, and swears vengeance but discovers that Andre has died from the severity of his injuries.

The aircraft types can include advanced trainers, ground-attack aircraft, transports and helicopters. Some countries have sufficiently large military reservations for such training to take place without affecting the civilian population. In smaller countries, such as in Europe, there can be tension between the military and the local population‚Äîmainly because of aircraft noise. Hazards Low-level flying involves air safety hazards such as: * Collision with the ground, electricity wires etc. as a result of pilot error (e.g. Cavalese, 1998) or failure of aircraft systems - at low level and high speed there is little time to react to any problem. * Mid-air collision with light aircraft (e.g. Norfolk, 1974) or other military aircraft. * Bird strike. The noise can also disturb animals and hence cause a hazard to horse-riders etc. By country =Canada= NATO tactical ultra-low-level flight training in Canada is located at CFB Goose Bay in Labrador. In response to lessons learned from the Vietnam War and the growing sophistication of Soviet anti-aircraft radar and surface-to-air missile technology being deployed in Europe, NATO allies began looking at new doctrines in the 1970s‚Äì1980s which mandated low-level flight to evade detection. CFB Goose Bay's location in Labrador, with a population of around 30,000 and area of , made it an ideal location for low-level flight training. Labrador's sparse settlement and a local topography similar to parts of the Soviet Union, in addition to proximity to European NATO nations caused CFB Goose Bay to grow and become the primary low-level tactical training area for several NATO air forces during the 1980s. During the 1980s‚Äì1990s, CFB Goose Bay hosted permanent detachments from the Royal Air Force, Luftwaffe, Royal Netherlands Air Force, and Aeronautica Militare, in addition to temporary deployments from several other NATO countries. Goose Bay Weapons Range is the only tactical bombing range in eastern Canada. The thirteen million hectare (130,000 square km) range includes ultra-low-level flying training to 30.5 m (100 feet) above ground level, supersonic flight areas, and an inert conventional and precision guided munitions bombing range.\\"Goose Bay The Freedom to Fly.\\" National Defence Canada: 5 Wing Goose Bay .

Learning how to use the plasma cutter in the sculpture studio of the University of Iowa Visual Arts Building.  History  The arts were an important part of the curriculum at the University of Iowa long before The School of Art and Art History was officially established in 1936. As far back as 1882, University of Iowa students were required to take \\"free-hand drawing\\" courses. Art history was added around 1900 through the departments of Philosophy and Classical Archaeology. In the 1920s, the university brought art history and studio art into one department, creating a rich learning environment where studio artist would benefit by learning the history of art and art historians could better understand the studio experience. This innovative idea was copied by many institutions calling it the \\"Iowa Idea\\". Iowa was the first major university to accept creative works, rather than written theses for graduate degrees in the arts. In 1924 the University of Iowa conferred the first graduate degree \\"Master's in Graphic and Plastic Arts\\" to Eve Drewelowe. In 1940 Elizabeth Catlett was awarded the first Master of Fine Arts degree at the University of Iowa. The University of Iowa conferred more graduate arts degrees in the nation between 1946-62 than any other university. Grant Wood taught painting at the School from 1934-41. H. W. Janson, renown art historian, taught art history at the School from 1938-41. Philip Guston taught painting from 1941-45. Many of Guston's painting from this time show Iowa City buildings in the backgrounds. Recognizing Iowa's innovative approach, Peggy Guggenheim donated Jackson Pollock's \\"Mural\\" to the art department in 1951. Mauricio Lasansky taught at the School of Art and Art History from 1945-86. In September 1962, Time Magazine called Lasansky \\"the nation's most influential printmaker\\" and his University of Iowa studio \\"the printmaking capital of the United States.\\" Ana Mendieta received an MFA in Intermedia from the University of Iowa in 1972. Born in Cuba, her family fled to the United States in 1961 to escape the Cuban Revolution. Mendieta's work focused on the female body and the landscape. She created photographs, videotapes and films that documented her performances and landscape sculptures. Mendieta died in September 1985 from a fall from a 34th floor apartment in New York City. In 1969 the University of Iowa Museum of Art (UIMA) opened with collections from the School of Art and Art History, including the Pollock \\"Mural\\" and the Beckmann triptych \\"Karneval\\"; and the Elliott Collection, which included works by Braque, DeChirico, Kandinsky, L√©ger, Marc, Matisse, Picasso and Vlaminck. In the 1980s, Maxwell and Elizabeth Stanley donated one of the most important collections of African art to the Museum. 1936 University of Iowa Art Building  Facilities  In 1936, The University of Iowa constructed a new home for the School of Art and Art History. Built with help from the Rockefeller and Carnegie foundations, the building's design is based on Palladian villas. Several new buildings were added to the arts campus in 1968 including a new printmaking wing, ceramics studios, sculpture foundry, and jewelry/metalsmithing studios. In 2006 Steven Holl designed a new building for the School adjacent to quarry pond. Art Building West received the RIBA International Award and the American Institute of Architects Honor Award for Architecture in 2007. The Iowa Flood of 2008 damaged the 1936 Art Building and Steven Holl's Art Building West. Art Building West was restored and re-opened January 2012. The 1936 Art Building will be retained on campus as an historic property, but many of its functions have been moved to a new Visual Arts Building designed by Steven Holl opened in the fall of 2016.

It was designed by the German architect J√ºrgen Mayer and completed in April 2011. It has dimensions of 150 by 70 metres (490 by 230 ft) and an approximate height of and claims to be the largest wooden structure in the world. Its appearance, location, delays and cost overruns in construction resulted in much public controversy. The building is popularly known as Las Setas de la Encarnaci√≥n (Incarnation's mushrooms). Description Panorama The structure consists of six parasols in the form of giant mushrooms (\\"Las setas\\" in Spanish), whose design is inspired by the vaults of the Cathedral of Seville and the ficus trees in the nearby Plaza de Cristo de Burgos. Metropol Parasol is organized in four levels. The underground level (Level 0) houses the Antiquarium, where Roman and Moorish remains discovered on site are displayed in a museum. Level 1 (street level) is the Central Market. The roof of Level 1 is the surface of the open-air public plaza, shaded by the wooden parasols above and designed for public events. Levels 2 and 3 are the two stages of the panoramic terraces (including a restaurant), offering one of the best views of the city centre. Restaurant Metropol Parasol Sevilla History From the 19th century a market was located in the plaza, housed in a dedicated building. The building was partially demolished in 1948 in accordance with plans for urban renewal. The market itself remained, however, until 1973, when the rest of the dilapidated building was finally demolished. The land remained dormant until 1990, when the city decided to construct underground parking with space for a market on top. However, in the midst of construction, ruins dating to the Roman and Al- Andalus eras were discovered, and construction was frozen after an expenditure of 14 million euros. In 2004, the city decided to attempt to develop the area again, and opened an international competition to solicit bids. Construction Antiquarium, under Metropol Parasol. The Parasol under construction, May 7, 2007. Construction began on June 26, 2005, with an estimated cost of 50 million euros and a projected completion date in June 2007. However, unknown to the public, the project soon faced difficulties. By May 2007 engineering firm Arup informed the municipal authorities that the structure was technically unfeasible as designed, given that a number of structural assumptions had not been tested and the design appeared to violate the limitations of known materials. The wood used was birch, imported from Finland, because of its straight qualities.Marmol, Carlos. \\"Un proyecto imposible\\" diariodesevilla.es February 2, 2010. Accessed September 30, 2012 Much time was spent developing feasible alternative plans to buttress the structure, which themselves proved impractical because of the added weight. A feasible design using glue as reinforcement was finally settled on only at the beginning of 2009.

According to one source, the decree has \\"no parallel in other countries\\". This law, like all laws applying to dhimmi, was applied more or less ruthlessly depending upon the inclination local and royal officials. It was aggressively enforced at least some of the time and in some regions under Imam Yahya (1918‚Äì1948).Simon, Reeva Spector; Laskier, Michael Menachem & Reguer, Sara, eds. (2003) The Jews of the Middle East and North Africa in Modern Times. New York: Columbia University Press; p. 392 Although forced conversion is not widely recognized under Islamic laws, historian and Arabist Shelomo Dov Goitein believes that a forced conversion of orphans could have been justified by the revelation attributed to Muhammad that states: \\"Every person is born to the natural religion [Islam], and only his parents make a Jew or a Christian out of him.\\" Before Ottoman rule There are only some fragmentary and isolated accounts about the enforcing of the decree before Ottoman rule. It was not enforced equally in every part of Yemen. There were places where Jews were able to hide orphaned children and protect them from being forcibly converted to Islam. Still there are several accounts about the enforcement of the decree. Shalom Shabazi, a Jewish poet who lived in 17th century Yemen, wrote in one of his poems about \\"stealing orphans\\". A translation of the poem runs thus: \\"Thousands of orphaned souls, both boys and girls, were wrested from the arms of their parents, grandfather and grandmother, by force by the nations all the days of the many kings of Yemen.\\" Rabbi Hayyim Habshush writes that by the end of Al-Mansur Ali I's rule in 1809 the Imam built palaces for his sons \\"and when he settled his sons in those palaces he ordered that the orphaned Jewish children be seized and converted and made servants and scribes in the palaces.\\" In the same account Habshush testifies that there were some \\"who concealed the children in their homes until they were fully grown.\\" One more account is dated to 1850. Jewish scholar Amram Qorah recalls a story about his orphaned father, who was hidden by a Jewish family in their home and thereby escaped a forced conversion. After the end of Ottoman rule Tudor Parfitt compares the Orphans' Decree to \\"draconian measures introducing the forced conscription of Jewish children into the Czarist's army\\" in Russia. Concerning the reintroduction of the Orphans' Decree in Yemen in 1921, after the end of Ottoman rule, Parfitt says that \\"in the first ten years\\" it \\"was implemented with great rigour.\\" Once again the decree was not implemented equally in every part of Yemen. In some places the authorities turned \\"a blind eye\\" to escaped and hidden children, but, in the places the Decree was implemented, troops were sent to search for escaped children, and the leaders of Jewish communities that were suspected of hiding the children were \\"imprisoned and tortured\\". In 1923 the Jewish community of Al Hudaydah suffered the abduction of 42 orphaned children, some of whom managed to escape. A witness account from Sana'a recalls an abduction of two fatherless siblings, a brother and a sister. The children were forcibly taken from their mother's arms and beaten to make them convert to Islam. The Jewish community offered to pay for the children's release to their family, but Islamic law prohibits accepting money to avert such a conversion. The witness compares the ceremony of the conversion of the siblings to a \\"funeral procession\\". After getting out of the orphanage, converted Jewish boys were often enlisted as soldiers. The girls made a valuable asset as brides because there were no relatives who needed to be paid a bride price in order to marry them. Jewish communities responded by acting quickly when children were orphaned, sometimes taking children and placing them with Jewish families living in dense Jewish settlements, especially Sana, large enough that a Jewish family might lack Muslim neighbors who would notice the addition of a child to a family. However, because \\"hidden\\" children might be discovered and forcibly converted, relatives or the Jewish community sometimes arranged to take them out of the Yemen; cases are recorded of Jews making the arduous journey to settle in the Land of Israel with orphaned relatives or unrelated children they had adopted in order to escape the threat that the children might be taken for conversion. In the first-half of the twentieth-century, the Chief Rabbi of Yemen, Yihya Yitzhak Halevi, worked tirelessly to save Jewish orphans from falling into the hands of Muslims.Yehiel Hibshush, Sh…ônei Ha- me'oroth (◊©◊†◊ô ◊î◊û◊ê◊ï◊®◊ï◊™), Tel-Aviv, 1987, pp. 10‚Äì11 (Hebrew) From about 1920, British imperial control of Aden provided a safe haven to which orphaned children could be taken; clandestine caravans carrying orphans and traveling by night are known to have gone from various parts of Yemen to take orphaned children to the sanctuary of the British Empire. An orphaned boy or boy or girl could also be very quickly married, since married people had the legal status of adults and could not be taken for forcible conversion. Modern day expression The Orphans' Decree has left its imprint in Modern Israel, where playwright, Shlomo Dori, in his play A New Life (1927), raises the concern of being imprisoned for hiding two Jewish orphans, and where actor and composer, Sa'adia Dhamari, in the musical The Bearer [of Good Tidings] (1957), makes his chief protagonists Jewish orphans who had converted to Islam.Rachel Yedid & Danny Bar-Maoz (ed.), Ascending the Palm Tree ‚Äì An Anthology of the Yemenite Jewish Heritage, E'ele BeTamar: Rehovot 2018, p. 388 ; S.

The forms were sent to these enumerators and they commenced the work of taking the census. One enumerator was appointed for Labrador. A Bishop Martin, of Nain, enumerated the far northern Moravian Mission stations in Labrador.

It can be seen today as a ruin on a low ridge to the south of the village of Lochwinnoch, Renfrewshire, Scotland. History Barr Castle was constructed in the 15th or early 16th century. It passed into the hands of the Hamiltons of Ferguslie at the end of the 16th century. They retained the castle until the late 18th century, when they sold and abandoned it for a new mansion. The castle is protected as a scheduled monument. Architecture The tower is a simple rectangle on plan, measuring about 7.80m east to west by 10.70m transversely, which stands to the level of the corbelling of the four angle turrets, now gone, about 12.0m high; on its south side, the chimney stack and part of the gable remain. Externally the castle is very plain, and it depends for its appearance on its mass. The tower has walls of roughly-coursed, square-faced masonry with dressed stone corner-quoins. The only remaining ornamental feature is the pediment above the main entrance, inscribed with the initials of Margaret Hamilton and John Wallace. Barr Castle in 2010 The main entrance to the castle is at ground level on the west side. This is a later alteration; the original doorway was on the first floor, reached by a stairway. Window openings survive on all four sides of the building. Also visible on the tower walls are several elements which indicate later alterations, probably in the late 17th century, when the tower was converted into a larger residence. Little now survives of the courtyard as drawn by McGibbon & Ross in the 19th century. Extant photographs and plans indicate that the courtyard supported various subsidiary buildings, including a wing attached to the southern wall of the tower, now gone. The ground floor was divided into two apartments, both of which had low vaulted ceilings. The entrance doorway opened into a small passage, from which the two apartments could be formally accessed and where the circular stair to the upper floor started. The kitchen possessed a large and very low arched fireplace. The hall occupied the whole of the first floor, with light entering from the four sides. The hall differed from the great majority in Scottish castles, the ceiling having been flat and low instead of the usual loftily arched form. It is evident from the existing plans of the second floor that it had been divided into two apartments by a light partition starting from between the doors of the two garderobes in the south wall. The two staircases would have given separate access from the hall below to each of these two rooms. The third floor had, like the second floor, been divided into two apartments, with a garderobe for each and separate access from the hall as on the floor below. Closets are formed in the thickness of the walls. The plan of the battlements shows the common arrangement for the protection of the walls before lead came into use. The stones overlap at the joints, and gargoyles are formed on the lower ones. Formerly stairs at the north-west angle led to the battlements as well as the main stair. There was a complete passageway round the top of the building. The corner turrets had been roofed, and checks previously existed for small doors at each, and iron crooks for the hinges. A large gutter, made of stone hollowed on the surface, formed the junction between each turret and the main roof. Inscriptions Various inscriptions are carved into the fabric of Barr Castle. These include IW and MH on the pediment above the main entrance, IH and IC 1680 above the lintel at the head of the stair, and WO 1699 on the battlements. The carvings are the initials of various Hamilton Lairds of Barr, John Wallace and his wife Margaret Hamilton, John Hamilton and Jean Cochrane. The Lands of Barr The Poll Tax Roll of 1695 details the farms and settlements comprising the Lands of Barr: these were Sunnyaykers on the Lynthills, Bridgend, Johnshill leaving the village of Lochwinnoch, Cruiks, Knockbarton, Kame and the Barneich farms. The Glens of Barr Barr Castle was built by the Glen family. On the death of Alexander Glen in April 1629, the castle passed to the Hamiltons of Ferguslie. The Hamiltons of Barr Alexander Hamilton of Barr GravestoneMargaret Hamilton, eldest daughter of Allan Hamilton of Ferguslie, married John Wallace, second son of William Wallace of Elderslie. It was a term of the contract that the husband was to assume the name and arms of Hamilton. Accordingly on 9 July 1647 a grant under the Great Seal was made to John Wallace of the right to do so, hence the Hamiltons of Barr. Alexander Hamilton of Barr, great-grandson of Margaret and John, was born in 1670. Listed as 'of Barr,' his name appeared on the 1695 Poll Tax roll for Lochwinnoch. He was appointed a Commissioner of Supply for Renfrewshire the following year. Alexander died in 1747 and was buried in the graveyard of St John‚Äôs Kirk in Lochwinnoch. Alexander's grandson John Hamilton sold the estate to the MacDowall family. He died in 1825 and was buried in the family tomb at Lochwinnoch. Macdowall of Garthland As of 2011, Barr Castle is owned by Fergus MacDowall of Garthland, Chief of the Clan MacDowall. Because of his status, it is regarded as the clan seat. The MacDowall family have little historical connection with the castle, other than ownership since the 18th century of the land on which the castle was earlier built. The surviving inscriptions, both internal and external, relate to the Hamilton family of the 17th century.

It was the childhood home of two American patriots and signers of the Declaration of Independence: Richard Lee and Francis Lee. A plantation complex in the Southern United States is the built environment (or complex) that was common on agricultural plantations in the American South from the 17th into the 20th century. The complex included everything from the main residence down to the pens for livestock. Southern plantations were generally self-sufficient settlements that relied on the forced labor of enslaved people, similar to the way that a medieval manorial estate relied upon the forced labor of serfs. Plantations are an important aspect of the History of the Southern United States, particularly the antebellum era (pre-American Civil War). The mild temperate climate, plentiful rainfall, and fertile soils of the southeastern United States allowed the flourishing of large plantations, where large numbers of enslaved Africans were held captive as slave labor and forced to produce crops to create wealth for a white elite. The Seward Plantation is a historic Southern plantation-turned-ranch in Independence, Texas, United States. Today, as was also true in the past, there is a wide range of opinion as to what differentiated a plantation from a farm. Typically, the focus of a farm was subsistence agriculture. In contrast, the primary focus of a plantation was the production of cash crops, with enough staple food crops produced to feed the population of the estate and the livestock. A common definition of what constituted a plantation is that it typically had or more of land and produced one or two cash crops for sale. Other scholars have attempted to define it by the number of people who were enslaved by the owner. The plantation complex Gothic Revival-style Afton Villa in St. Francisville, Louisiana. Built from 1848 to 1856, the masonry structure burned in 1963. The vast majority of plantations did not have grand mansions centered on a huge acreage. These large estates did exist, but represented only a small percentage of the plantations that once existed in the South. Although many Southern farmers did enslave people before emancipation in 1862, few enslaved more than five. These farmers tended to work the fields alongside the people they enslaved. Of the estimated 46,200 plantations known to exist in 1860, 20,700 had 20 to 30 enslaved people and only 2,300 had a workforce of a hundred or more, with the rest somewhere in between. Many plantations were operated by absentee-landowners and never had a main house on site. Just as vital and arguably more important to the complex were the many structures built for the processing and storage of crops, food preparation and storage, sheltering equipment and animals, and various other domestic and agricultural purposes. The value of the plantation came from its land and the enslaved people who toiled on it to produce crops for sale. These same people produced the built environment: the main house for the plantation owner, the slave cabins, barns, and other structures of the complex. 1862 photograph of the slave quarter at Smiths Plantation in Port Royal, South Carolina. The slave house shown is of the saddlebag type. The materials for a plantation's buildings, for the most part, came from the lands of the estate. Lumber was obtained from the forested areas of the property. Depending on its intended use, it was either split, hewn, or sawn. Bricks were most often produced onsite from sand and clay that was molded, dried, and then fired in a kiln. If a suitable stone was available, it was used. Tabby was often used on the southern Sea Islands. Freeman Plantation House in Jefferson, Texas. Few plantation structures have survived into the modern era, with the vast majority destroyed through natural disaster, neglect, or fire over the centuries. With the collapse of the plantation economy and subsequent Southern transition from a largely agrarian to an industrial society, plantations and their building complexes became obsolete. Although the majority have been destroyed, the most common structures to have survived are the plantation houses. As is true of buildings in general, the more substantially built and architecturally interesting buildings have tended to be the ones that survived into the modern age and are better documented than many of the smaller and simpler ones. Several plantation homes of important persons, including Mount Vernon, Monticello, and The Hermitage have also been preserved. Less common are intact examples of slave housing. The rarest survivors of all are the agricultural and lesser domestic structures, especially those dating from the pre-Civil War era. = Plantation house= =Slave quarters= 1870s photo of the brick slave quarters at Hermitage Plantation (now destroyed) near Savannah, Georgia. Slave housing, although once one of the most common and distinctive features of the plantation landscape, has largely disappeared from most of the South. Many were insubstantial to begin with. Only the better- built examples tended to survive, and then usually only if they were turned to other uses after emancipation. Slave quarters could be next to the main house, well away from it, or both. On large plantations they were often arranged in a village-like grouping along an avenue away from the main house, but sometimes were scattered around the plantation on the edges of the fields where the enslaved people toiled, like most of the sharecropper cabins that were to come later. Woodland Plantation in West Pointe a la Hache, Louisiana. Slave houses were often one of the most basic construction. Meant for little more than sleeping, they were usually rough log or frame one-room cabins; early examples often had chimneys made of clay and sticks. Hall and parlor houses (two rooms) were also represented on the plantation landscape, offering a separate room for eating and sleeping. Sometimes dormitories and two-story dwellings were also used as slave housing. Earlier examples rested on the ground with a dirt floor, but later examples were usually raised on piers for ventilation. Most of these represent the dwellings constructed for enslaved people who worked the fields. Rarely though, such as at the former Hermitage Plantation in Georgia and Boone Hall in South Carolina, even field slaves were provided with brick cabins. More fortunate in their accommodations were the house servants or skilled laborers. They usually resided either in a part of the main house or in their own houses, which were normally more comfortable dwellings than those of their counterparts who worked in the fields. A few enslavers went even further to provide housing for their household servants. When Waldwic in Alabama was remodeled in the Gothic Revival style in the 1852, the household servants were provided with large accommodations that matched the architecture of the main house. This model, however, was exceedingly rare. Remnants of the slave quarter at Faunsdale Plantation near Faunsdale, Alabama. Famous landscape designer Frederick Law Olmsted had this recollection of a visit to plantations along the Georgia coast in 1855: =Other residential structures= Oakland Plantation near Natchitoches, Louisiana. A crucial residential structure on larger plantations was an overseer's house. The overseer was largely responsible for the success or failure of an estate, making sure that quotas were met and sometimes meting out punishment for infractions by the enslaved. The overseer was responsible for healthcare, with slaves and slave houses inspected routinely. He was also the record keeper of most crop inventories and held the keys to various storehouses. A gar√ßonni√®re (bachelor's quarters) at The Houmas, near Burnside, Louisiana. The overseer's house was usually a modest dwelling, not far from the cabins of the enslaved workers. The overseer and his family, even when white and southern, did not freely mingle with the planter and his family. They were in a different social stratum than that of the owner and were expected to know their place. In village-type slave quarters on plantations with overseers, his house was usually at the head of the slave village rather than near the main house, at least partially due to his social position. It was also part of an effort to keep the enslaved people compliant and prevent the beginnings of a slave rebellion, a very real fear in the minds of most plantation owners. Economic studies indicate that fewer than 30 percent of planters employed white supervisors for their enslaved laborers. Some planters appointed a trusted enslaved person as the overseer, and in Louisiana free black overseers were also used. Another residential structure largely unique to plantation complexes was the garconni√®re or bachelors' quarters. Mostly built by Louisiana Creole people, but occasionally found in other parts of the Deep South formerly under the dominion of New France, they were structures that housed the adolescent or unmarried sons of plantation owners. At some plantations it was a free-standing structure and at others it was attached to the main house by side-wings. It developed from the Acadian tradition of using the loft of the house as a bedroom for young men. =Kitchen yard= Lowry Plantation outside of Marion, Alabama. The main house is wood-frame with brick columns and piers. A variety of domestic and lesser agricultural structures surrounded the main house on all plantations. Most plantations possessed some, if not all, of these outbuildings, often called dependencies, commonly arranged around a courtyard to the rear of the main house known as the kitchen yard. They included a cookhouse (separate kitchen building), pantry, washhouse (laundry), smokehouse, chicken house, spring house or ice house, milkhouse (dairy), covered well, and cistern. The privies would have been located some distance away from the plantation house and kitchen yard. The cookhouse or kitchen was almost always in a separate building in the South until modern times, sometimes connected to the main house by a covered walkway. This separation was partially due to the cooking fire generating heat all day long in an already hot and humid climate. It also reduced the risk of fire. Indeed, on many plantations the cookhouse was built of brick while when the main house was of wood-frame construction. Another reason for the separation was to prevent the noise and smells of cooking activities from reaching the main house. Sometimes the cookhouse contained two rooms, one for the actual kitchen and the other to serve as the residence for the cook. Still other arrangements had the kitchen in one room, a laundry in the other, and a second story for servant quarters. The pantry could be in its own structure or in a cool part of the cookhouse or a storehouse and would have secured items such as barrels of salt, sugar, flour, cornmeal and the like. 1940 photograph of the washhouse (laundry) at Melrose Plantation in Melrose, Louisiana. The washhouse is where clothes, tablecloths, and bed-covers were cleaned and ironed. It also sometimes had living quarters for the laundrywoman. Cleaning laundry in this period was labor-intensive for the domestic slaves that performed it. It required various gadgets to accomplish the task. The wash boiler was a cast iron or copper cauldron in which clothes or other fabrics and soapy water were heated over an open fire. The wash-stick was a wooden stick with a handle at its uppermost part and four to five prongs at its base. It was simultaneously pounded up and down and rotated in the washing tub to aerate the wash solution and loosen any dirt. The items would then be vigorously rubbed on a corrugated wash board until clean. Items were wrung out by hand until the 1850s, when they would be passed through a mangle. The items would then be ready to be hung out to dry or, in inclement weather, placed on a drying rack. Ironing would have been done with a metal flat iron, often heated in the fireplace, and various other devices. Wheatlands near Sevierville, Tennessee. The milkhouse would have been used by enslaved people to make milk into cream, butter, and buttermilk. The process started with separating the milk into skim milk and cream. It was done by pouring the whole milk into a container and allowing the cream to naturally rise to the top. This was collected into another container daily until several gallons had accumulated. During this time the cream would sour slightly through naturally occurring bacteria. This increased the efficiency of the churning to come. Churning was an arduous task performed with a butter churn. Once firm enough to separate out, but soft enough to stick together, the butter was taken out of the churn, washed in very cold water, and salted. The churning process also produced buttermilk as a by-product. It was the remaining liquid after the butter was removed from the churn. All of the products of this process would have been stored in the spring house or ice house. 1937 photograph of one of two identical pigeonniers at Uncle Sam Plantation in Convent, Louisiana. One of the most ornate and complete plantation complexes left at that time, it was bulldozed in 1940 for levee construction. The smokehouse was used to preserve meat, usually pork, beef, and mutton. It was commonly built of hewn logs or brick. Following the slaughter in the fall or early winter, salt and sugar were applied to the meat at the beginning of the curing process, and then the meat was slowly dried and smoked in the smokehouse by a fire that did not add any heat to the smokehouse itself. If it was cool enough, the meat could also be stored there until it was consumed. The chicken house was a building where chickens were kept. Its design could vary, depending on whether the chickens were kept for egg production, meat, or both. If for eggs, there were often nest boxes for egg laying and perches on which the birds to sleep. Eggs were collected daily. Some plantations also had pigeonniers (dovecotes) that, in Louisiana, sometimes took the form of monumental towers set near the main house. The pigeons were raised to be eaten as a delicacy and their droppings were used as fertilizer. Few functions could take place on a plantation without a reliable water supply. Every plantation had at least one, and sometimes several, wells. These were usually roofed and often partially enclosed by latticework to keep out animals. Since the well water in many areas was distasteful due to mineral content, the potable water on many plantations came from cisterns that were supplied with rainwater by a pipe from a rooftop catchment. These could be huge aboveground wooden barrels capped by metal domes, such as was often seen in Louisiana and coastal areas of Mississippi, or underground brick masonry domes or vaults, common in other areas. =Ancillary structures= Thornhill near Forkland, Alabama. Some structures on plantations provided subsidiary functions; again, the term dependency can be applied to these buildings. A few were common, such as the carriage house and blacksmith shop; but most varied widely among plantations and were largely a function of what the planter wanted, needed, or could afford to add to the complex. These buildings might include schoolhouses, offices, churches, commissary stores, gristmills, and sawmills. Found on some plantations in every Southern state, plantation schoolhouses served as a place for the hired tutor or governess to educate the planter's children, and sometimes even those of other planters in the area. On most plantations, however, a room in the main house was sufficient for schooling, rather than a separate dedicated building. Paper was precious, so the children often recited their lessons until they memorized them. The usual texts in the beginning were the Bible, a primer, and a hornbook. As the children grew older their schooling began to prepare them for their adult roles on the plantation. Boys studied academic subjects, proper social etiquette, and plantation management, while girls learned art, music, French, and the domestic skills suited to the mistress of a plantation. Waverley near West Point, Mississippi. Most plantation owners maintained an office for keeping records, transacting business, writing correspondence, and the like. Although it, like the schoolroom, was most often within the main house or another structure, it was not at all rare for a complex to have a separate plantation office. John C. Calhoun used his plantation office at his Fort Hill plantation in Clemson, South Carolina, as a private sanctuary of sorts, with it used as both study and library during his 25-year residency. The \\"Negro Baptist Church\\" at Friendfield Plantation near Georgetown, South Carolina. Another structure found on some estates was a plantation chapel or church. These were built for a variety of reasons. In many cases the planter built a church or chapel for the use of the plantation slaves, although they usually recruited a white minister to conduct the services. Some were built to exclusively serve the plantation family, but many more were built to serve the family and others in the area who shared the same faith. This seems to be especially true with planters within the Episcopal denomination. Early records indicate that at Faunsdale Plantation the mistress of the estate, Louisa Harrison, gave regular instruction to her slaves by reading the services of the church and teaching the Episcopal catechism to their children. Following the death of her first husband, she had a large Carpenter Gothic church built, St. Michael's Church. She latter remarried to Rev. William A. Stickney, who served as the Episcopal minister of St. Michael's and was later appointed by Bishop Richard Wilmer as a \\"Missionary to the Negroes,\\" after which Louisa joined him as an unofficial fellow minister among the African Americans of the Black Belt. Chapel of the Cross at Annandale Plantation near Madison, Mississippi. Most plantation churches were of wood-frame construction, although some were built in brick, often stuccoed. Early examples tended towards the vernacular or neoclassicism, but later examples were almost always in the Gothic Revival style. A few rivaled those built by southern town congregations. Two of the most elaborate extant examples in the Deep South are the Chapel of the Cross at Annandale Plantation and St. Mary's Chapel at Laurel Hill Plantation, both Episcopalian structures in Mississippi. In both cases the original plantation houses have been destroyed, but the quality and design of the churches can give some insight into how elaborate some plantation complexes and their buildings could be. St. Mary Chapel, in Natchez, dates to 1839, built in stuccoed brick with large Gothic and Tudor arch windows, hood mouldings over the doors and windows, buttresses, a crenelated roof-line, and a small Gothic spire crowning the whole. Although construction records are very sketchy, the Chapel of the Cross, built from 1850 to 1852 near Madison, may be attributable to Frank Wills or Richard Upjohn, both of whom designed almost identical churches in the North during the same time period that the Chapel of the Cross was built. Oakland Plantation near Natchitoches, Louisiana. Another secondary structure on many plantations during the height of the sharecropping-era was the plantation store or commissary. Although some antebellum plantations had a commissary that distributed food and supplies to slaves, the plantation store was essentially a postbellum addition to the plantation complex. In addition to the share of their crop already owed to the plantation owner for the use of his or her land, tenants and sharecroppers purchased, usually on credit against their next crop, the food staples and equipment that they relied on for their existence. Planters maintained a record of the purchases, often adding exorbitant interest rates. A 1909 estimate by the Department of Agriculture concluded that the average sharecropper cleared only about $175 from his crops before settling his accounts at the plantation store. However, afterward the tenant farmer had to pay for the coming year's staples, thereby keeping himself permanently indebted to the plantation owner. This type of debt bondage, for blacks and poor whites, led to a populist movement in the late 19th century that began to bring blacks and whites together for a common cause. This early populist movement is largely credited with helping to cause state governments in the South, mostly controlled by the planter elite, to enact various laws that disenfranchised poor whites and blacks, through grandfather clauses, literacy tests, poll taxes, and various other laws. =Agricultural structures= Melrose in Natchez, Mississippi. The agricultural structures on plantations had some basic structures in common and others that varied widely. They depended on what crops and animals were raised on the plantation. Common crops included corn, upland cotton, sea island cotton, rice, sugarcane, and tobacco. Besides those mentioned earlier, cattle, ducks, goats, hogs, and sheep were raised for their derived products and/or meat. All estates would have possessed various types of animal pens, stables, and a variety of barns. Many plantations used specialized structures that were crop-specific and only found on that type of plantation. Plantation barns can be classified by function, depending on what type of crop and livestock were raised. In the upper South, like their counterparts in the North, barns had to provide basic shelter for the animals and storage of fodder. Unlike the upper regions, most plantations in the lower South did not have to provide substantial shelter to their animals during the winter. Animals were often kept in fattening pens with a simple shed for shelter, with the main barn or barns being used for crop storage or processing only. Stables were an essential type of barn on the plantation, used to house both horses and mules. These were usually separate, one for each type of animal. The mule stable was the most important on the vast majority of estates, since the mules did most of the work, pulling the plows and carts. Tobacco barn near Lexington, Kentucky. Barns not involved in animal husbandry were most commonly the crib barn (corn cribs or other types of granaries), storage barns, or processing barns. Crib barns were typically built of unchinked logs, although they were sometimes covered with vertical wood siding. Storage barns often housed unprocessed crops or those awaiting consumption or transport to market. Processing barns were specialized structures that were necessary for helping to actually process the crop. Tobacco plantations were most common in certain parts of Georgia, Kentucky, Missouri, North Carolina, Tennessee, South Carolina, and Virginia. The first agricultural plantations in Virginia were founded on the growing of tobacco. Tobacco production on plantations was very labor-intensive. It required the entire year to gather seeds, start them growing in cold frames, and then transplant the plants to the fields once the soil had warmed. Then the slaves had to weed the fields all summer and remove the flowers from the tobacco plants in order to force more energy into the leaves. Harvesting was done by plucking individual leaves over several weeks as they ripened, or cutting entire tobacco plants and hanging them in vented tobacco barns to dry, called curing. Winnowing barn (foreground) and rice pounding mill (background) at Mansfield Plantation near Georgetown, South Carolina. Rice plantations were common in the South Carolina Lowcountry. Until the 19th century, rice was threshed from the stalks and the husk was pounded from the grain by hand, a very labor-intensive endeavor. Steam-powered rice pounding mills had become common by the 1830s. They were used to thresh the grain from the inedible chaff. A separate chimney, required for the fires powering the steam engine, was adjacent to the pounding mill and often connected by an underground system. The winnowing barn, a building raised roughly a story off of the ground on posts, was used to separate the lighter chaff and dust from the rice. Laurel Valley Plantation in Thibodaux, Louisiana. Sugar plantations were most commonly found in Louisiana. In fact, Louisiana produced almost all of the sugar grown in the United States during the antebellum period. From one-quarter to one-half of all sugar consumed in the United States came from Louisiana sugar plantations. Plantations grew sugarcane from Louisiana's colonial era onward, but large scale production did not begin until the 1810s and 1820s. A successful sugar plantation required a skilled retinue of hired labor and slaves. The most specialized structure on a sugar plantation was the sugar mill (sugar house), where, by the 1830s, the steam-powered mill crushed the sugarcane stalks between rollers. This squeezed the juice from the stalks and the cane juice would run out the bottom of the mill through a strainer to be collected into a tank. From there the juice went through a process that removed impurities from the liquid and thickened it through evaporation. It was steam-heated in vats where additional impurities were removed by adding lime to the syrup and then the mixture was strained. At this point the liquid had been transformed into molasses. It was then placed into a closed vessel known as a vacuum pan, where it was boiled until the sugar in the syrup was crystallized. The crystallized sugar was then cooled and separated from any remaining molasses in a process known as purging. The final step was packing the sugar into hogshead barrels for transport to market. Cotton press from the Norfleet Plantation, now relocated to Tarboro, North Carolina. Cotton plantations, the most common type of plantation in the South prior to the Civil War, were the last type of plantation to fully develop. Cotton production was a very labor-intensive crop to harvest, with the fibers having to be hand-picked from the bolls. This was coupled with the equally laborious removal of seeds from fiber by hand. After the invention of the cotton gin, cotton plantations sprang up all over the South and cotton production soared, along with the expansion of slavery. Cotton also caused plantations to grow in size. During the financial panics of 1819 and 1837, when demand by British mills for cotton dropped, many small planters went bankrupt and their land and the enslaved people trafficked to larger plantations. As cotton-producing estates grew in size, so did the number of enslavers and the average number of people enslaved there. A cotton plantation normally had a cotton gin house, where the cotton gin was used to remove the seeds from raw cotton. After ginning, the cotton had to be baled before it could be warehoused and transported to market. This was accomplished with a cotton press, an early type of baler that was usually powered by two mules walking in a circle with each attached to an overhead arm that turned a huge wooden screw. The downward action of this screw compressed the processed cotton into a uniform bale-shaped wooden enclosure, where the bale was secured with twine. Plantation complexes in the 21st century While large farms still exist, they are largely mechanized, and the economic incentive for a laboring community of enslaved people or sharecroppers has disappeared. Owners no longer want or need to live on the plantation. Many manor houses survive, and in some cases former slave dwellings have been rebuilt or renovated. To pay for the upkeep, some, like the Monmouth Plantation in Natchez, Mississippi, and the Lipscomb Plantation in Durham, North Carolina, have become small luxury hotels or bed and breakfasts. Monticello, Mount Vernon, and some 375 other former plantation houses are museums that can be visited. There are examples in every Southern state. Centers of plantation life such as Natchez run plantation tours. Traditionally, these museum houses presented an idyllic, dignified \\"lost cause\\" vision of the antebellum South. Recently, and to different degrees, some have begun to acknowledge the \\"horrors of slavery\\" that made that life possible. In 2019, efforts by Color of Change led \\"five major websites often used for wedding planning\\" to pledge to \\"cut back on promoting and romanticizing weddings at former slave plantations.\\" As well, the New York Times decided \\"to exclude couples who were being married on plantations from wedding announcements and other wedding coverage.\\" Personnel =Plantation owner= Three planters, after 1845, The Metropolitan Museum of Art The Old Plantation: How We Lived in Great House and Cabin before the War, 1901, by Confederate chaplain and planter James Battle Avirett An individual who owned a plantation was known as a planter. Historians of the antebellum South have generally defined \\"planter\\" most precisely as a person who owned real estate and enslaved 20 or more people.Peter Kolchin, American Slavery 1619‚Äì1877, New York: Hill and Wang, 1993, xiii The wealthiest planters, such as the Virginia elite with plantations near the James River, owned more land and enslaved more people than other farmers. Tobacco was the major cash crop in the Upper South (in the original Chesapeake Bay Colonies of Virginia and Maryland, and in parts of the Carolinas). The later development of cotton and sugar cultivation in the Deep South in the early 18th century led to the establishment of large plantations which enslaved hundreds of people. In the \\"Black Belt\\" counties of Alabama and Mississippi, the terms \\"planter\\" and \\"farmer\\" were often synonymous;Oakes, Ruling Race, 52. a \\"planter\\" was generally a farmer who enslaved many people. Planters are often spoken of as belonging to the planter elite or to the planter aristocracy in the antebellum South. The historians Robert Fogel and Stanley Engerman define large planters as those enslaved more than 50 people, and medium planters as those who enslaved between 16 and 50 people. Historian David Williams, in A People's History of the Civil War: Struggles for the Meaning of Freedom, suggests that the minimum requirement for planter status was enslaving 20 people, especially since a Southern planter could exempt Confederate duty for one white male per 20 Black people enslaved.David Williams, A People's History of the Civil War: Struggles for the Meaning of Freedom, New York: The New Press, 2005. In his study of Black Belt counties in Alabama, Jonathan Weiner defines planters by ownership of real property, rather by enslaving people. A planter, for Weiner, owned at least $10,000 worth of real estate in 1850 and $32,000 worth in 1860, equivalent to about the top eight percent of landowners. In his study of southwest Georgia, Lee Formwalt defines planters in terms of size of land holdings rather than in terms of numbers of enslaved people. Formwalt's planters are in the top 4.5% of landowners, translating into real estate worth $6,000 or more in 1850, $24,000 or more in 1860, and $11,000 or more in 1870. In his study of Harrison County, Texas, Randolph B. Campbell classifies large planters as those who enslaved 20 people, and small planters as those who enslaved between 10 and 19 people. In Chicot and Phillips Counties, Arkansas, Carl H. Moneyhon defines large planters as those who enslaved 20 or more people, and of or more. Many nostalgic memoirs about plantation life were published in the post-bellum South. For example, James Battle Avirett, who grew up on the Avirett-Stephens Plantation in Onslow County, North Carolina, and served as an Episcopal chaplain in the Confederate States Army, published The Old Plantation: How We Lived in Great House and Cabin before the War in 1901. Such memoirs often included descriptions of Christmas as the epitome of anti-modern order exemplified by the \\"great house\\" and extended family. Novels, often adapted into films, presented a romantic, sanitized view of plantation life. The most popular of these were The Birth of a Nation (1916), based on Thomas Dixon Jr.,'s best-selling novel The Clansman (1905), and Gone with the Wind (1939), based on the best-selling novel of the same name (1936) by Margaret Mitchell. =Overseer= On larger plantations an overseer represented the planter in matters of daily management. Usually perceived as uncouth, ill-educated, and low-class, he had the difficult and often despised task of middleman and the often contradictory goals of fostering both productivity and the welfare of the enslaved work-force. =Slavery= Southern plantations depended upon enslaved people to do the agricultural work. \\"Honestly, 'plantation' and 'slavery' is one and the same,\\" said an employee of the Whitney Plantation in 2019. \\"Many plantations, including George Washington's Mount Vernon and Thomas Jefferson's Monticello, are working to present a more accurate image of what life was like for slaves and slave owners.\\" \\"The changes have begun to draw people long alienated by the sites' whitewashing of the past and to satisfy what staff call a hunger for real history, as plantations add slavery-focused tours, rebuild cabins and reconstruct the lives of the enslaved with help from their descendants.\\" McLeod Plantation, focuses primarily on the forced labor of enslaved people. \\"McLeod focuses on bondage, talking bluntly about ‚Äúslave labor camps‚Äù and shunning the big white house for the fields.\\" \\"'I was depressed by the time I left and questioned why anyone would want to live in South Carolina,' read one review [of a tour] posted to Twitter.\\" Plantation crops Crops cultivated on antebellum plantations included cotton, tobacco, sugar, indigo, rice, and to a lesser extent okra, yam, sweet potato, peanuts, and watermelon. By the late 18th century, most planters in the Upper South had switched from exclusive tobacco cultivation to mixed-crop production. In the Lowcountry of South Carolina, even before the American Revolution, planters typically enslaved hundreds of people. (In towns and cities, families enslaved people to work as household servants.) The 19th-century development of the Deep South for cotton cultivation depended on large tracts of land with much more acreage than was typical of the Chesapeake Bay area, and for labor, planters enslaved dozens, or sometimes hundreds, of people. Plantation architecture and landscape Antebellum architecture can be seen in many extant \\"plantation houses\\", the large residences of planters and their families. Over time in each region of the plantation south a regional architecture emerged inspired by those who settled the area. Most early plantation architecture was constructed to mitigate the hot subtropical climate and provide natural cooling. Some of earliest plantation architecture occurred in southern Louisiana by the French. Using styles and building concepts they had learned in the Caribbean, the French created many of the grand plantation homes around New Orleans. French Creole architecture began around 1699, and lasted well into the 1800s. In the Lowcountry of South Carolina and Georgia, the Dogtrot style house was built with a large center breezeway running through the house to mitigate the subtropical heat. The wealthiest planters in colonial Virginia constructed their manor houses in the Georgian style, e.g. the mansion of Shirley Plantation. In the 19th century, Greek Revival architecture also became popular on some of the plantation homes of the deep south. Common plants and trees incorporated in the landscape of Southern plantation manors included Southern live oak and Southern magnolia. Both of these large trees are native to the Southern United States and were classic symbols of the old south. Southern live oaks, classically draped in Spanish moss, were planted along long paths or walkways leading to the plantation to create a grand, imposing, and majestic theme. Plantation landscapes were very well maintained and trimmed, usually, the landscape work was managed by the planter, with assistance from slaves or workers. Planters themselves also usually maintained a small flower or vegetable garden. Cash crops were not grown in these small garden plots, but rather garden plants and vegetables for enjoyment.

During his voyage across the globe Charles Darwin realised that vertical crustal motion must be responsible for the formation of continents and ocean basins, as well as isolated atolls in the Pacific. He deduced that the central basin of the Pacific had subsided while surrounding areas had risen. In 1964 U.S. geologist Henry Menard subsequently named the uplifted area in the Pacific after the English naturalist.; : When later dealing with other continents he became so fixed in his belief in vertical movements of the crust and the erosive power of the sea that he excluded other possible explanations[‚Ä¶] ; Geological context Covering an area of , the Darwin Rise is limited to the east by the Izu-Bonin and Mariana trenches, to the west by the Line Islands. Two major plateaux, the Shatsky Rise to the north and the Ontong Java Plateau to the south, border the Darwin Rise. How these plateaux relate to the rise remains disputed. There are six major chains of seamounts on the rise ‚Äî the Japanese, Magellan, Wake, Marshall Islands, Line Islands seamounts and the Mid-Pacific Mountains ‚Äî and numerous minor clusters. The ages of these seamounts in general follow the motion of the Pacific Plate from 130 to 180 , as predicted by conventional hotspot theory, and decrease from west to east and north to south. This age- distance pattern is, however, not corroborated by the limited data available. Origin In 1964, Henry Menard proposed that this was a superswell raised by volcanism during the Cretaceous (120-80 mya).For an illustration of Menard's model of the evolution of the Darwin Rise see A problem with this conjecture is that this region actually has a sea floor at a normal depth that happens to possess an abundance of sea mounts. Instead this feature may have formed from diapirs or plumes rising from the Earth's upper mantle, which results in chains of sea mounts along the direction of the plate motion. However, this idea remains in dispute and an alternate hypothesis involving multiple \\"plumelets\\" has been proposed. In the 1980s it was proposed that the Darwin Rise was the South Pacific Superswell 100 Ma and that the volcanoes of the Darwin Rise erupted over the same mantle region as the volcanoes of French Polynesia today. Hence, U.S. geologist Marcia McNutt proposed that the Darwin Rise is a palaeo-superswell.

Tetris Friends featured 6 single-player modes and 5 multiplayer modes. Playing any game mode gave a user Tokens. They could be used to unlock new skins and Tetrimino styles, although a premium \\"ruby\\" currency also existed. The version available on Facebook only has 4 of the modes available on the official website and it has no coin system, but it does feature a special mode available only on Facebook. All game modes except Tetris 1989 and N-Blox used the SRS rotational system, featured the hold function which allowed players to save a block for future use, and had a quad- Tetrimino preview that allows players to see the next few upcoming blocks. Tetris Online, Inc ceased all operations on May 30th, 2019. As such, Tetris Friends permanently shut down on that date.  Game Modes  = Single Player =  Marathon  In Marathon Mode, players have to clear a specified number of lines while trying to score as many points as possible. Clearing multiple lines with one piece is worth more than the actual number cleared. For instance, clearing a single line is worth only one, while clearing four lines with a single piece is worth eight lines. Once the goal has been reached, the level and speed increases and a new, higher goal is set. There are fifteen levels in total. The game ends once level fifteen is completed, and the score is recorded and added to the high score list if the user has a registered account.  Sprint  Sprint Mode requires players to clear forty lines as quickly as possible. The time required to clear all the lines is recorded as the score. The speed is automatically set to the lowest setting.  Ultra  Ultra Mode challenges players to score as many points as possible in two minutes. Clearing multiple lines with a single piece scores more points. Special moves called t-spins are also worth extra points. If the player loses by reaching the top, the score does not count and is not recorded in the high score list.  Survival  Survival Mode is similar to Marathon Mode. Players have to clear ten lines per level while scoring as many points as possible. Every line cleared is worth only one, unlike in Marathon Mode. There are a total of twenty levels, each one at a higher speed than the last. Once all twenty levels are beaten, the player enters the bonus level. The bonus level is a semi-invisible level. Blocks alternate between being visible and invisible. The blocks are invisible for increasing longer time periods as the level progresses. There is no limit on how many lines the player can clear, and the player only loses when the blocks reach the top of the field. This game mode is not available on the Facebook version.  Tetris 1989  This mode attempts to simulate the classic Game Boy version of Tetris. There are two modes within this game. Mode A challenges players to clear as many lines as possible. Once certain goals are reached, the speed increases. Mode B requires players to clear a specified number of lines. These are similar to other game modes, but the rotational system of the blocks is slightly different, and there is no hold feature, making this mode more difficult. This game mode is not available on the Facebook version.  N-Blox  N-Blox mode is developed by British web designer Paul Neave. It does not use many of the new features such as the hold function and the four block preview. Players are also not allowed to change the keyboard controls, which they can in every other mode. The goal is to score as many points as possible. The speed increases after a certain number of lines are cleared. This is similar to other standard Tetris modes available in other games. This mode is not available on the Facebook version.  BlockStar  This mode is similar to the N-Blox and Tetris 1989 modes. There are no hold pieces, ghost pieces, or four piece preview. The game is endless and challenges players to achieve the high score. This game is a remake of the first Tetris game that was released on Facebook. It is only available to play on Facebook, and is not found on the Tetris Friends website. = Multiplayer =  Battle 2P  In Battle 2P, the player plays against a previously recorded game that was played by another person, or even the player himself. The goal is to knock out the other player three times by forcing them to reach the top of the screen. Players can send garbage, blank lines of tiles that cannot be cleared normally, to the other player by clearing multiple lines with a single piece, by clearing lines with consecutive pieces, or by performing the t-spin maneuver. There is a two-minute time limit. If no one has won by the end of two minutes, the player that has been knocked out the most times loses. If both have the same number of knock-outs, then the player that sent the most lines of garbage to the other player is the winner. Players earn stars when they win. Once enough stars have been earned, the player is promoted to the next rank where he is matched up with better players. There are a total of twenty ranks attainable.  Battle 6P  This mode is very similar to Battle 2P. The player is pitted against five other opponents this time. The opposing players are also recordings as in Battle 2P. There is a target that constantly alternates between the other five players. When garbage is sent by the player, the person that the target is current pointing at is the one that receives the garbage. Knock-outs are awarded to the person that sent the most garbage to the knocked-out player, so timing of attacks is important in earning knock-outs. The player with the highest knock-out-to-knocked-out ratio after two minutes is the winner. If that is tied, then number of lines of garbage sent is the tie-breaker, as in Battle 2P. By doing well, the players can earn stars, which promotes them to new ranks. Doing poorly will cause players to lose stars. As in Battle 2P, there are twenty ranks in the mode. This mode is not available on the Facebook version.  Sprint 5P  In Sprint 5P, the player is playing against four others players in the basic Sprint Mode. The players are previously recorded as in Battle 2P. The goal is to clear forty lines before the other players. Players earn stars by placing first or second, and they lose stars by placing fourth of fifth. Once enough stars are earned, they advance to a new rank just as in Battle 2P.  Arena  Arena is the only live multiplayer mode. It pits up to six players against each other in real time. It works similarly to Battle 6P, except that when a player is knocked out, they are out of that round. There are also items available in the game. When special flashing blocks are cleared, the player is awarded with a randomly selected item that harms the opponent in some way. Items can cause more garbage, speed up the game for the opponent, or even make the blocks invisible, among other things. The player is awarded points based on how well they do, how many lines of garbage they sent, and how many people they knocked out. Once a player earns 1,000 points, they are promoted to the next rank. If their points reach 0 because they lost points in a match, they are demoted a rank. This mode is not available on the Facebook version.  Rally 8P  In Rally 8P, the player has to race to the bottom of the field by clearing all the blocks. The player has to race against 7 other previously recorded players. The mode features cascade rules, which allows blocks to fall all the way down if the blocks below them are removed. Items are also available in this mode as in Arena. Wins earn stars, which allow promotion like most of the other multiplayer modes. This mode is not available on the Facebook version.

Other abnormal mental symptoms in the early stages are, as a rule, absent. The patient is most usually quiet and orderly, with a good memory. It has often been a matter of the greatest difficulty to decide under which heading of the recognized classifications individual members of this group should be placed. As the hallucinations give rise to slight depression, some might possibly be included under melancholia. In others, paranoia may develop. Others, again, might be swept into the widespread net of dementia praecox. This state of affairs cannot be regarded as satisfactory, for they are not truly cases of melancholia, paranoia, dementia praecox or any other described affection. This disease, as its name suggests, is a hallucinatory case, for it is its main feature. These may be of all senses, but auditory hallucinations are the most prominent. At the beginning, the patient may realize that the hallucination is a morbid phenomenon and unaccountable. They may claim to hear a \\"voice\\" speaking, though there is no one in the flesh actually doing so. Such a state of affairs may last for years and possibly, though rarely, for life, and the subject would not be deemed insane in the ordinary sense of the word. It's probable, however, that this condition forms the first stage of the illness, which eventually develops on definite lines. What usually happens is the patient seeks an explanation for the hallucinations. As none is forthcoming he/she tries to account for their presence and the result is a delusion, and, most frequently, a delusion of persecution. Also, it needs to be noted that the delusion is a comparatively late arrival and is the logical result of the hallucinations.A paper read at the Quarterly Meeting of the Medico-Psychological Association on February 24th, 1920, written by Robert Hunter Steen, King's College Hospital, London References  External links  Psychosis Paranoia ","title":"Chronic hallucinatory psychosis"},{"id":"31510309","text":"Ace of Spades was a team-based first-person shooter and voxel-based sandbox video game developed and published by Jagex. Originally created by Ben Aksoy and released as a prototype in April 2011, the game was acquired by Jagex in 2012 and fully released in December that year. Following poor reception and several minor downloadable content package releases, the game was shut down in March 2019.  Development  = Ben Aksoy prototype = Ace of Spades was originally developed by Ben Aksoy. The first of version of the game, Beta 0.1, was released on 4 April 2011, and was available for Microsoft Windows. This version of the game played as a 16-versus-16 team-based first-person shooter with a capture the flag game mode, in which players were to obtain the opposing team's intelligence briefcase and return it to the own team's base. Due its use of voxel-based graphics and emphasis on block-building techniques aside from gunplay, it was quickly labelled as \\"Minecraft with rifles\\". The gunplay itself was compared to that of Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45. Ace of Spades was received well, despite its early and unfinished state, and was listed amongst Kotaku \\"Best Indie Games of 2011\\" list and PC Gamer April 2011 \\"Best Free PC Games\\" list. As of November 2012, the beta of Ace of Spades had been installed 2.5 million times and had roughly 550,000 monthly active users. = Jagex version = Around 2012, Ace of Spades was acquired by British developer Jagex, which had previously started creating a new version of the game in mid-2011. Aksoy was reported to have agreed to the deal due to his critical financial state at the time, though was subsequently offered a position in Jagex' Cambridge headquarters. He continued working on the game from Jagex' offices until late 2012, when his laptop was physically damaged by one of the company's system administrators. According to a former developer for Ace of Spades, who held a Reddit AMA on the topic, Jagex provided work- for-hire developer Blitz Games with Aksoy's code in November 2012, asking for it to be rewritten within eight weeks to meet the Christmas 2012 deadline. Jagex themselves stated that they had worked with \\"a handful of indie developers\\" to have the game finished in time. The remade Ace of Spades was announced by Jagex on 1 November 2012, with a tentative release date set for the following month. The game was to be released for Microsoft Windows via the Steam digital distribution platform. On 5 December 2012, the release date was formalised to 12 December. Pre-registrations for the game were launched alongside, and by 11 December, one day before the release, Jagex reported that 500,000 users had pre-registered for the game. Ace of Spades launch trailer, released alongside the game itself, highlighted the characteristics of the game's new characters. In reference to the game's title, the trailer also featured Mot√∂rhead's eponymous 1980 song, \\"Ace of Spades\\". Unlike previous games released by Jagex, such as RuneScape, Ace of Spades was not released in a free-to-play model and was instead provided as a one-off purchase costing , described as a \\"small one-off fee\\". Mark Gerhard, chief executive officer of Jagex at the time, explained that this was \\"what's right for the game\\". Shortly following the release, on 21 December, Ace of Spades was updated with free downloadable content (DLC) containing four new maps, a new weapon and the reintroduction of the capture the flag game mode. On 24 January 2013, Jagex released, alongside other new content, the \\"Classic Mode\\" that aimed to play similarly to the 2011 prototype of the game. On Valentine's Day on 14 February 2013, the game received its first paid DLC package, named St. Valentine's Day Massacre, which introduced a new \\"VIP mode\\" wherein teams defended one randomly chosen players of their own team while trying to defeat that of the other team's. A port of Ace of Spades to OS X was released on 16 May 2013. As means of promotion, the game received a \\"free weekend\\", through which people could play the full game for a limited time, and overall offered at half- price. On 2 October 2013, the game received a native map editor which could be used to produce maps shared through the Steam Workshop. Alongside this update, the previously paid St. Valentine's Day Massacre DLC was made available for free. Following onto the map editor integration, the game was updated with a custom, 24-player mode wherein players could build maps within a limited time. To reflect the new mode, the game was rebranded as Ace of Spades: Battle Builder. A second paid DLC package, Hurt + Heal, was released on 8 December 2015 and introduced two new character classes, as well as one new weapon for each of the four previous classes. = Closure = On 3 April 2018, Jagex announced that Ace of Spades would be discontinued. The game was taken off sale immediately, while dedicated game servers were to stay online through 3 July. However, on 2 July, Jagex stated that Ace of Spades shutdown would be postponed as they considered alternative futures for the game. Considering an open-source release, the company reviewed the game's codebase, but finally decided to retire the game. Jagex clarified on 1 March 2019 that an open- source release would pose \\"potential technical, legal and licensing implications\\", and that the game's servers would be shut down on 6 March.  Reception  The Jagex release of Ace of Spades received \\"generally unfavorable\\" reviews, according to review aggregator website Metacritic.  Successor  On 20 November 2014, Jagex announced Block N Load as a free-to- play successor to Ace of Spades. Block N Load developed stemmed from Alex Horton, chief creative officer at Jagex at the time, who acknowledged that Ace of Spades was not \\"launched well\\", because of which he asked Jagex' board to create a new title in the same genre.

Multicultural marketing acknowledges differences in perception, motives and beliefs among consumers with different cultural backgrounds, utilises cultural norms of several cultures to maximise exposure of the business's product or services by demonstrating interest and appreciation of different cultures (De-Mooij, 2015). For a multicultural marketing strategy to succeed, cultural differences must be identified, understood, and respected. Businesses must communicate on different \\"wavelengths\\" and adapt to different markets around the world (Wilkinson & Cheng, 1999). International marketing generally works with national-level data (De-Mooij, 2015). International marketer analyses nations with respect to GNI/capita, education levels, available mass media, social media used, retail infrastructure and product category data, all at the national level (De-Mooij, 2015). Applying cultural values at the same national level is useful for understanding differences in consumer product ownership, brand preferences and motives. This cannot be established by differences in income or other demographic characteristics but may be explained by cultural differences (Demangeot, Broderick & Craig, 2015). Cultural value data tends to be assessed using either primary or secondary data. Primary data is derived directly from assessing values through surveys or experiments. Secondary data includes scores of proportions of national culture. For individual-level studies, data is collected and analysed at the individual level and tied to the individual level outcome. For measuring culture at the national level, individual data are combined by country and linked to the country-level outcome or pre-existing country-level measures. (Demangeot et al., 2015) Multicultural marketing (aka, ethnic marketing or cross-cultural marketing) applies unique marketing techniques to access the ethnic market. \\"Ethnic market\\" refers to cultures other than the majority culture in a company's home area. Multicultural marketing strategies involve recognising a culture's traditions, beliefs, values, norms, language, and religion‚Äîand applying those aspects to market to that culture's needs. (Rugimbana & Nwankwo, 2003).  History  Multiculturalism was regarded as a problem, in Australia attempts were made to reduce cultural heterogeneity by restricting immigration to white Europeans (Wilkinson & Cheng, 1999). This idea was swiftly abandoned. Other issues included adapting to the customs and traditions of new countries, tensions between ethnic communities of historical origins (Wilkinson & Cheng, 1999). Recently the focus has shifted onto the benefits of multiculturalism, and how it can potentially increase domestic and international brand recognition (De Mooij, 2015). Economical, political, and social suggestions of this cultural mix cannot be ignored and has become widely recognised, for example the Australian Broadcasting Commission in 1995 took a significant step in ensuring that several cultures were taken into consideration and allowed for the best television programs to be sourced from around the world to cater to the needs of different cultural groups, airing programs from Asia and Europe, this directly influenced its ratings and achieved larger audiences (Wilkinson & Cheng, 1999). Various other types of products and services have been developed or adapted for the multicultural domestic market. For example, Chtaura Dairy products introduced Middle Eastern recipes for their dairy products. Multi-cultural marketing did not increase in general society until the late 1960s where the potential of the ethnic market was first addressed. (Rugimbana & Nwankwo, 2003). Since then, multicultural marketing has slowly developed and the 1990s hit a peak when businesses began to recognize the value of targeting the ethnic market. Large companies such as Coca-Cola have invested in a multicultural marketing scheme, after realizing the potential of the ethnic market for the growth of their business. (Rugimbana & Nwankwo, 2003). Multicultural markets Two types of needs in a multicultural domestic market need to be considered. Firstly, the needs of people with different cultural backgrounds and secondly, the needs resulting from these values, perceptions, and preferences of cultural groups in the role products and services play in their lives (Demangeot et al., 2015). Multicultural markets represent an important focal lens for international marketing and cross-cultural consumer research, in view of their growing economic importance and of their theoretical difference from other types of marketplaces. Changes in infrastructure, technology, economic development and consumer mobility have increased cultural interactions consequently an increase in multicultural market demand. Traditionally marketing research was based on static values; marketing is now viewed as more dynamic (Demangeot et al., 2015). Multicultural marketing is becoming a focal point of marketing research (De-Mooij, 2015). Multicultural marketing strategy Marketing strategy is centred around a goal of increasing sales and achieving a competitive advantage, marketing strategies can be short and long term (Kotler, Burton, Deans, Brown, & Armstrong, 2013). Multicultural marketing strategies focus on adapting businesses value propositions to specific cultural groups to establish a multicultural target market (Demangeot et al., 2015). The marketing mix and the 4Ps (product, price, promotion and place (channels) play a role in establishing a marketing strategy (Kotler et al., 2013). A marketing mix allows you to focus on goals and establish channels to communicate with the target market of the product or service. For a multicultural strategy to succeed, several factors must be addressed including creating a brand message that appeals to people of several different cultures and ethnicity using the available promotion channels that are touch points for the target market (including television, social media, radio, and websites) (Burrell, 2015). To create a good multicultural marketing strategy, it is also important to work with individuals and agencies that understand the targeted consumer's lifestyles. Multicultural thinking must be incorporated into core overall brand strategy to respect cultures and build mutual trust. (Burrell, 2015) Consumer purchases are influenced by cultural, social, personal and psychological influences (Kotler et al., 2013). These factors cannot be controlled but they can be accounted for while coming up with a marketing mix (Kotler et al., 2014). Culture is the base of a person's wants and behaviour. Growing up in society, a child learns basic values, perceptions, wants and behaviours from their family and other role models. Marketers decide to which degree they adapt their product and marketing programs to meet the unique cultures and needs of consumers in various markets Promotion needs to be in the context of today's social and cultural differences. Companies can adapt to the same promo strategy to as the home market or adapt for each local market. The product, communication adoption involves modifying the message so that it fits with different cultural environments (Kotler et al., 2013). Product adaptation is changing the product to meet local needs, condition or wants or creating something new for the forging market is Product intervention (Kotler et al., 2013). The reasons for multicultural advertising The word ‚Äúmulticultural‚Äù is including people who have different customs and beliefs and multicultural consumer is any consumer who has two or more cultural or ethnic background or affiliation; in fact, they exhibit a contextual cultural identity that allows them to show different features of lifestyle, culture, etc. (the Wharton University of Pennsylvania, n.d). Therefore, marketers have to spot that they must develop their approach to account for this dynamic and fluid identity (Perez & Frank, 2011). While overall standards for a ‚Äúgood ad‚Äù are similar across group, cross-cultural customers actually need personal relevant to create ads more attractive to them. In multicultural environments, the overall makeup of society is diverse, influencing the need for a multi- cultural approach to marketing strategies (Rugimbana & Nwankwo, 2003). The saying ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù no longer applies and strategies must be established to successfully communicate with all cultures through marketing techniques. ‚ÄòCulture‚Äô has a large influence on marketing strategies as it affects communication channels, consumer behaviour and advertising standards and norms. (De-mooij, 2014) De-mooij also acknowledges that consumers are not the same worldwide, and their thought patterns and purchasing decisions differ depending usually on overall wealth of the country and other socio-economic factors (2014). Adopting multicultural marketing strategies also allows businesses to gain a unique competitive advantage. It has been proven that consumers make purchasing decisions based on social, personal, cultural and physiological factors. (Kotler, Burton, Deans, Brown, & Armstrong, 2013). Once these factors are recognized and the marketer knows what factors entice a multicultural consumer to purchase, strategies can be executed to appeal to the market through their physiological needs. Value of Multicultural Marketing There are three main values of Multicultural Marketing (Rayo & Artieda, 2011). First of all is innovation ‚Äì thanks for this type of marketing, the marketer and the companies have to be always creative to find a new solution, develop new products and marketing strategies. The second value of multicultural marketing is growth ‚Äì which is the increase in sales and marketplace for the company's brand. Finally, collaboration can be considered as the third value of cross-cultural marketing, which can bring people together and promote the brand and company. Skills required It is suggested that the following skills are required in the field of multicultural marketing. # To spot patterns that allow subcultures to be grouped together, so that a common marketing strategy may be extended to several subcultures in a group (‚Äútranscultural‚Äù marketing) # To develop a distinct marketing strategy for each subculture, if there is a significantly distinct cultural dimension that is important to the specific culture (multicultural marketing) # To further segment audiences in a subculture, if needed, in terms of cultural affinity, cultural identity or acculturation level (tactical adaptation within a subculture) # To develop parameters of culturally acceptable marketing stimuli; and # To establish a protocol for measuring cultural effectiveness of the stimuli. This process is also known as ethnic marketing. Creating and refreshing a multicultural marketing strategy Creating a multicultural marketing strategy Multicultural marketing focuses on customizing messaging and marketing channels for each target group, as opposed to simply translating a general message into different languages, or including token representation of different ethnic groups in imagery (Stachura & Murphy, 2005). A successful multicultural marketing strategy should be: multi-faceted, realistic and implemented consistently over time. In addition, there are 4 rules to make a cross-cultural marketing strategy: make your marketing bilingual ‚Äì in world market in general and some large market in specific, most of the consumers are speaking more than one language, make sure digital marketing tactics match values and behavior, use entertainment and music as marketing tools, and develop cohesive content and programming (Wright, 2015). There are 5 orders for a description of marketing strategy: detail specific activities that are intended to be undertaken, identify the target audience for each activity, specific how to measure success, be flexible enough for allowing adjustments, and finally, stipulate who is responsible for each activity (Klausner, 2013). There are several steps to create a multicultural marketing strategy (Rayo & Artieda, 2011). The first step is to identify objectives and markets, and the target customer and their characteristics. Secondly, the strategy should identify potential consumer touch points like a comfort zone, language or tradition, culture, etc. The next step is to identify the media that makes sense for the marketing goals. Fourthly, the marketer must evaluate the approach and learn from others‚Äô mistakes. Finally, the strategy must connect to the culture by understanding and respecting customers‚Äô culture and tradition, building trust and connection with them in evocative ways, then making the company‚Äô brand multicultural friendly. Refreshing a multicultural marketing strategy The fastest increasing population segment is multicultural audiences with expanding cultural beliefs that lead to the need of refreshing multicultural marketing strategy from companies to target products and services on this new growing population (Vachet, 2015). In 2013, Forbes presented 5 tips to refresh a cross-cultural marketing strategy, which are: socialize and mobilize ‚Äì as the multicultural audiences is leading in social media usage and mobile technology, the marketer also must be socialized and mobilized; secondly, thinking multiculturally mean being multicultural is one of the biggest mistakes, actually, marketers do not have to be in a specific ethnicity to think as the above-mentioned community. The next tip is prioritizing the multicultural strategy which means the cross-cultural mind must be incorporated into the core strategy and the multicultural customer should be target in overall brand strategy. In addition, understanding all meanings of ‚Äúmulticultural‚Äù is considered as the fourth tip as marketers must reach all the potential customers. The final tip is trying new media platform and marketing vehicles or in other words, marketers have to try new media platforms and tools of marketing as the consumers have already done. Pioneers Pioneers in the field of multicultural marketing include Madam C. J. Walker, African-American businesswoman, hair care entrepreneur, Procter and Gamble, McDonald's, Pepsi cola and Benetton, and the entrepreneur Francesco Costa with My Own Media and ISI Holding in the foreigner services sector, Joseph Assaf with Ethnic Business Awards, Alan M. Powell CEO of AP & Associates, and Saad Saraf with Mediareach Advertising (UK). Some of the first agencies in New York City to tackle the multicultural - and specifically Hispanic marketing - space were FOVA (Font and Vaamonde), The Bravo Group and Conill Advertising. Other pioneers in the US include Nick Mendoza and Dick Dillon, Loretta Adams, former owner of Market Development, Inc. The Multicultural Marketing Society of Canada was founded by veteran marketing guru Gautam Nath. The Multicultural Marketing Alliance Canada (MMAC) is a national, non-profit organization, founded in 2016 by Canada's leading multicultural agencies in order to champion the cause of the multicultural advertising industry in Canada.

On the Isle de France he was befriended by Pierre Poivre (1719‚Äì1786), administrator of the Isle de France and Ile Bourbon (R√©union), who he assisted in the cultivation of spices. When Poivre was recalled to France in 1773 C√©r√© was appointed Director of the Royal Garden at Monplaisir (now Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam Botanical Garden), a position he held from 1775 to the time of his death in 1810. During his time on the island C√©r√© encouraged plant exchange, making a considerable contribution to economic botany by sending living plants to many countries, raising numerous peppers, cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg trees which he distributed to the neighbouring French islands, and also introducing to Mauritius useful plants from Malaysia, America, China and elsewhere. Biography Details of C√©r√©‚Äôs life, on which the following account is based, have been researched by J. Deleuze. Jean-Nicolas C√©r√© was the son of Fran√ßois- Toussaint C√©r√©, a naval officer who, according to the memoirs of Bertrand- Fran√ßois Mah√© de La Bourdonnais, was at the age of five posted to France to study, his father having died in Martinique. He arrived at Brest as a ward of the state. For several years he was a student at the College of Valves, finishing his studies in Paris. In 1757, he served in two campaigns under the command of Count Anne Antoine d'Ach√© being promoted to officer. In 1759 he settled on the Isle de France, his father leaving him a considerable fortune. On the Isle de France C√©r√© married Bernardine Marie de La Roche du Ronzet on 27 January 1763. His son Jean-Auguste C√©r√© (17 May 1764 to 18 November 1831) succeeded him as Director of the garden. On his death C√©r√© left two sons and five daughters, the eldest son living at home with three of his sisters. The second son was in the service of France. His other two daughters were married, Constance-Jos√©phine C√©r√© (19 July 1769 to 23 June 1842) to General Louis Marie Fran√ßois C√©sar Ange d'Houdetot, their grandson being the historian C√©sar Lecat de Bazancourt, the other to Mr. Barb√©, former Royal Judge in the Isle-of- France: both were living in Paris. Association with Pierre Poivre Assuming a date of establishment of 1735 the Jardin du Roi at Pamplemousses was the world's first tropical botanic garden and, situated on the trade route between Europe and Asia, it had accumulated many of the new botanical treasures of the day. The gardens had evolved on the 'Mon Plaisir' estate of Pierre Poivre. It had been sold to the French crown at the end of his directorship with a recommendation that C√©r√© be appointed the next director. During his directorship it was renamed Jardin Royal. C√©r√© became assistant to Pierre Poivre who had in 1766 been appointed Administrator of the islands of France and Bourbon administering trade the country. When Poivre left the island in 1772 C√©r√© was named Director of the Pamplemousses Botanical Garden in 1775. Plantations of peppers, cloves, cinnamons, and nutmeg were established on the Isle de France and Bourbon, the plants then being sent to the West Indies and Cayenne. In the garden C√©r√© acclimatised plants and trees from America, India and China as well as European fruits and vegetables. He maintained correspondence with other horticulturists and naturalists including Georges- Louis Leclerc de Buffon, Edme-Louis Daubenton, Andr√© Thouin, Jacques Labillardi√®re and others, sending briefs to the Royal Agricultural Society of the G√©n√©ralit√© de Paris, which awarded him in 1788 with a gold medal. Napoleon confirmed his title as director of the botanical garden. He also introduced an Indian species of fish, the gourami, and made observations to assist the prediction of tropical cyclones on the island. C√©r√© was asked by the Habsburg Emperor Joseph II to assist in expanding the famous Gardens of Sch√∂nbrunn and hosted Franz Boos, botanist of Sch√∂nbrunn, in 1787-1788. Then he hosted Joseph Martin, from the Jardin du Roy of Paris. C√©r√© was director of the gardens at the time of a visit to the island in 1795 after the demise of the Bruni d'Entrecasteaux expedition to New Holland in search of La P√©rouse. Botanist Labillardi√®re noted that the coco de mer palm (Lodoicea maldivica) from the island of Praslin in the Seychelles (botanically notable for its 'double' coconut, the largest seed in the world) was cultivated at the Pamplemousses gardens where it had been planted in 1769. This remarkable palm had been discovered in 1768‚Äì69 on an expedition to the Seychelles organised by Marc- Joseph Marion Dufresne. One reason for the visit would have been to prepare the way for the arrival of Breadfruit plants collected by himself and gardener F√©lix Delahaye in Tonga and which at that time were being tended by gardener botanist Delahaye in Java in preparation for the journey to Isle de France. Honours C√©r√© was awarded the medal of the Soci√©t√© d‚ÄôAgriculture on 28 November 1788.

Leadgate Park entered the FA Cup for the first time in 1892, receiving a bye in the first qualifying round in place of Sunderland Albion. However, the team was eliminated by Tow Law in the next round. The club applied for election to the Northern League in July 1895 as the number of clubs was being increased from nine to ten. However, the application was unsuccessful as Crook Town and Darlington St Augustine's were chosen to replace Howden-le-Wear. Nevertheless, Leadgate Park were accepted into the league soon afterwards, and finished eighth in the division in the 1896‚Äì97 season. In 1899, Leadgate Park switched to the Northern Football Alliance. They played in the league for two seasons, ending each campaign in eighth place. The club was forced to return to the Northern League in 1906 when the Northern Alliance banned clubs from County Durham. Leadgate Park attained their highest league finishes in 1906‚Äì07 and 1911‚Äì12, placing fourth out of 12 teams. Competitive football was stopped in 1915 due to the outbreak of the First World War, and upon resumption of league play in 1919 Leadgate Park joined the North Eastern League. In the same season, the team reached the fifth qualifying round of the FA Cup for the first time, but were knocked out by West Stanley. The club struggled in the league over the following years, never finishing in the top half of the table. In 1925, having conceded over 100 goals in 38 matches, Leadgate Park left the North Eastern League and subsequently disbanded.

She was the younger full sister of King Abdullah with whom she was very close with. She had also a full sister, Nouf bint Abdulaziz, who died in August 2015. Activities Seeta bint Abdulaziz was very active in charitable efforts. But, she was also active in forming women groups such as the Princesses' Council. Furthermore, the first and second Saudi Women's Forum was carried out under her patronage in 2009 and 2010, respectively. In May 2011, a conference entitled ‚ÄúSaudi Women of Tomorrow‚Äù was also organized under her patronage. She sponsored many charities within the Kingdom and made donations to various research programs and family welfare projects, too. Under her patronage, career days were organized towards female employment. =Princesses' council= In 2003, Princess Seeta initiated the Princesses‚Äô Council. The Council was designed to involve one member of each of the royal family‚Äôs sub-branches. It was the first family council for female royals in Saudi Arabia. All members of the council were asked to be interested in social work such as health-care, children, women, and business. The council became an important body in the House of Saud. Instead of focusing on charity work, it functions as a think tank and lobbying body. The council was designed to meet at a regular period, twice a month, every second week lasting for two or three hours. Societal issues focusing on women-related topics were discussed in the meetings. The outcomes of these meetings were mostly non-binding suggestions for solving certain issues, and petitions to relevant governmental institutions.

Only two prototype G1 and six production G2 gliders were built. Design and development The G1 glider was designed to meet a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) requirement for a transport glider to specification 5/42. Two prototype gliders, sometimes known as Experimental Glider 1, were ordered from de Havilland Australia (DHA). As DHA were already committed to build Tiger Moth basic trainers and Dragon navigation trainers, most of the work was to be done by subcontractors, with much of the build work on the two prototypes being carried out on the fifth floor of a Mill in Camperdown, Sydney.Issacs Air International July 1976, p. 23. It was a high-wing cantilever monoplane of all wooden construction, making extensive use of plywood. It used the cockpit canopy of the DH.84 Dragon, but was otherwise an original design. The aircraft's undercarriage used a single mainwheel behind a long nose skid, and a wooden tailskid. The crew consisted of a single pilot with seats for six passengers.Issacs Air International July 1976, pp. 23‚Äì24. The first prototype made its maiden flight on 14 June 1942, and was accepted by the RAAF on 11 October 1942, with the second prototype following on 17 November. A production order was placed with DHA for a modified version, but with the threat of invasion less likely, as well as the availability of Douglas Dakota transports and Waco Hadrian gliders from the United States, only six were ordered.Issacs Air International July 1976, p.25. The G2 was of similar layout to the G1, but had a slightly larger fuselage and a shorter span wing that could be broken into three parts to aid transportation. The first production G2 flew on 20 March 1943 and was delivered to the RAAF on 6 May 1943, with the remaining 5 following in July that year. They saw little use, with most of the gliders being stored, with the first G2 being used for glider conversion training.Issacs Air International July 1976, pp.25‚Äì26. The surviving gliders were reduced to components in 1952. The first G2, serial number A57-1, was modified in 1948 by the Government Aircraft Factory for trials of a suction airfoil, the modifications included the fitting of a Mercury 95A engine.

USPS 499-920 Design and development After the failure of the HP-15 to perform well in the 1969 US Nationals Schreder started the HP-16 with a new design philosophy. Avoiding the extremely high aspect ratio that the 15 had, he opted for a more modest 21.5:1 aspect ratio and larger wing area to improve performance in weak conditions. The HP-16's wing has 50% more wing area than the HP-15 and uses a Wortmann 67-150 airfoil. Like other Schreder designs the HP-16 is of all-metal construction, but with the wing skins bonded to foam ribs rather than using rivets to provide a smoother surface. The bonded construction also cut building time. The wing features the signature Schreder 90¬∞ flaps that allow steep descents and the use of small fields for landing. The HP-16s were all amateur-built aircraft and about 20 were completed and flown.

The episode was written by Phil Klemmer and Craig DiGregorio and directed by Robert Duncan McNeill. It originally aired on May 2, 2011. In the episode, Chuck Bartowski's (Zachary Levi) bachelor party turns up some uninvited guests. Meanwhile, Ellie Bartowski-Woodcomb (Sarah Lancaster) discovers the true identity of Agent X while investigating her father Stephen's computer. \\"Chuck Versus Agent X\\" received generally positive reviews from critics. According to the Nielsen ratings system, it drew 4.097 million viewers, the second-lowest number in Chuck history, after \\"Chuck Versus the Family Volkoff\\". It had a 2.5/4 share among all households and 1.4/4 share among those aged 18‚Äì49. Plot As Chuck Bartowski (Zachary Levi) contemplates confronting his sister Ellie (Sarah Lancaster) about her secret research into their late father Stephen's laptop, Chuck and his fianc√©e Sarah Walker (Yvonne Strahovski) prepare for their bachelor and bachelorette parties. At her bachelorette party, hosted by Ellie, Sarah is notified by General Diane Beckman that Stephen's laptop is being tracked by Volkoff Industries agents Riley (Ray Wise) and Jasmine (India de Beaufort), who, due to the imprisonment of international arms dealer Alexei Volkoff, are now under the leadership of Volkoff's daughter Vivian. Thinking that Riley and Jasmine are going to arrive at Ellie's apartment, Sarah tells Ellie that Chuck knows Ellie lied to him and still has the laptop. However, Ellie and Sarah then realize that the laptop has been mistakenly taken by Ellie's husband Devon Woodcomb (Ryan McPartlin) to Chuck's bachelor party. Meanwhile, despite Chuck and his guests' belief that Devon was hosting Chuck's bachelor party in Las Vegas, Nevada, they are taken to Las Vecas National Park. As some of the guests attempt to escape the camping trip, they are ambushed by Riley's mercenaries, who are tracking the laptop Devon unknowingly brought with him. Chuck and his friends escape, but the laptop is stabbed by Jasmine in the process. When Chuck returns, he and Ellie tell each other the truth, with Ellie revealing that she is still investigating her father's research, and Chuck revealing that he is still a CIA agent. Chuck then brings Ellie to Castle and demonstrates martial arts skills from the Intersect. When Chuck claims to be Agent X, the first human Intersect, Ellie informs him that, according to the laptop, someone had originally uploaded the Intersect to their brain before Chuck's birth. After Chuck repairs the computer, they find a redacted file on British scientist Hartley Winterbottom. Chuck, Sarah, and John Casey (Adam Baldwin) travel to Winterbottom's home in Somerset, UK, and confront Winterbottom's mother (Millicent Martin), who blames the CIA for corrupting her son. However, Chuck is revealed to be Stephen Bartowski's son, earning her trust, as Hartley and Stephen were once colleagues and close friends. When Riley and Jasmine arrive with an assault team, Mrs. Winterbottom sends Chuck and Sarah to retrieve Hartley's \\"spy will\\" while she and Casey fight back the assault team. When they run out of ammunition, Mrs. Winterbottom sets a trap that explodes and kills Jasmine and the assault team. When Ellie, Chuck, Sarah, Casey, and Morgan Grimes (Joshua Gomez) return to the Castle, open Hartley's spy will, they discover a photograph of Volkoff, realizing that Volkoff is actually Agent X - Hartley. Startled, the team reads the files on his last mission; which was to assist on a complicated cover-up, a black operation posing as international arms dealer Alexei Volkoff. The personality and knowledge of Volkoff was uploaded into the prototype Intersect by Stephen Bartowski and downloaded into the mind of Hartley so he could use it as a cover. However, the prototype Intersect was so unstable that the Volkoff personality pushed out and replaced Hartley's own identity. Subsumed by his new identity Hartley, as Volkoff, established his criminal empire. With the realization, Casey closes the spy will and orders everyone to keep quiet about this, since the information about CIA creating its \\"own worst enemy\\" was simply hidden and buried to ensure secrecy, and that they will be most likely eliminated if anything is told. However, Ellie objects and dedicates herself to help Volkoff restore his identity, to which Chuck agrees. Casey grudgingly and reluctantly supports them, before sealing the will in a secret safe deep in the Castle. Production \\"Chuck Versus Agent X\\" was one of many episodes to be directed by producer Robert Duncan McNeill, and was written by Phil Klemmer and Craig DiGregorio. It originally aired in the United States on May 2, 2011, on NBC as the 22nd episode of Chuck's fourth season and the 76th episode overall. Chuck cast members revealed at the 2011 Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo that the season would include a \\"funny, camping-themed\\" bachelor party episode featuring Casey, Big Mike, and the fictional band Jeffster!. The cast also confirmed that Ray Wise would reprise his role of Alexei Volkoff's lawyer, Riley. India de Beaufort guest starred as Jasmine, and Millicent Martin as Hartley Winterbottom's mother. Sarah Lancaster revealed to IGN that the Snakes of Toluca Lake, the strippers which Ellie hires for Sarah, were played by the real-life Hollywood Men. Lancaster enjoyed filming the scene, which took hours to perform, solely due to Yvonne Strahovski's discomfort. Strahovski stated that the men became \\"bolder\\" with each take, gradually moving closer to her. Principal photography for \\"Chuck Versus Agent X\\" ended on April 10. Series co-creator Chris Fedak stated in a later interview that the inspiration for Volkoff's true identity being a gun- shy British scientist was Timothy Dalton's portrayal of Gregory Tuttle, Volkoff's guise as Mary Elizabeth Bartowski's MI6 handler, in his first appearance on the series. A photograph of Dalton before his portrayal of James Bond is used to represent a young Hartley Winterbottom. Cultural references * Osama bin Laden's image is featured on a target for Casey's shooting range. Coincidentally, bin Laden was killed in a raid on May 1, 2011, around 16:00 Eastern Daylight Time, one day before the episode was aired. * In the Somerset home of Agent X, Casey briefly wields an M60 machine gun during the shoot-out.

Reception \\"Chuck Versus Agent X\\" drew 4.097 million viewers, the second-lowest number in Chuck's history, after \\"Chuck Versus the Family Volkoff\\". According to the Nielsen ratings system, it had a 2.5/4 share among all households and 1.4/4 share among those aged 18‚Äì49. The episode received positive reviews from critics. Ryan McGee of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A- on an A+ to F scale. He found the episode's \\"reconfiguration of previous mythology\\" successful, and, though he found it obvious that Volkoff was Agent X, McGee wrote that \\"seeing a pre-Bond Dalton inside that spy will was great payoff all the same.\\" However, McGee continued, \\"Much less successful was anything involving Chuck's bachelor party and Big Mike/Jeffster's subsequent desire to save their manly weekend.\\" Eric Goldman of IGN gave this episode a score of 8.5 out of 10, writing that \\"the best element in all of this was the introduction of Volkoff, or make that Hartley Winterbottom's, mother and the bonding that occurred between her and John Casey.\\" HitFix Senior Editor Alan Sepinwall, however, wrote that the episode \\"was kind of a hodge podge. It's a transitional episode setting up the end game with Volkoff that the season's final two episodes will focus on, but it also felt like an hour two or three different ideas that nobody could quite flesh out to fill up an entire episode, and so were compressed together.\\" Like McGee, Sepinwall enjoyed Wise's return, though he felt that the actor was given little to do.

In that role he worked with and/or introduced many iconic stars, with famed artists and groups as varied as Janis Joplin, The Tubes, The Cars, Tool (band), Huey Lewis, Carlos Santana, and others. Artists to whose efforts Daly has contributed have sold recorded music in vinyl, CD, and digital form over 40 years in excess of 300 million copies. Moving from the Washington, DC area to San Francisco in the ‚Äò60's, Daly befriended Janis Joplin and, due to that link, was soon hired by Columbia Records as San Francisco Head of A&R; spanning the Clive Davis and Goddard Lieberson eras. Daly followed this up with being named head of A&R; at Elektra/Asylum Records, followed by his direct hiring as Atlantic Head of Artist & Repertoire by legendary label chief Ahmet Ertegun at Atlantic Records (WMG), and Zoo Entertainment (Bertelsmann Music Group /BMG) where he was again named Vice President and head of A&R.; Daly is the recipient of multiple Gold and Platinum recording awards. As a significant executive in the music industry, Daly has discovered such original music talents as the seminal new- wave group The Cars (whom he signed to a long-term Elektra/Asylum deal on a paper napkin, after their live performance at Harvard University where his sister was attending) whose first album, The Cars, stayed on the charts for an astonishing 139 Weeks and sold over six million copies in the US, the radical Bay Area surreal pop performers, The Tubes, who he brought to A&M; Records, as well as contracting modern theatrical rockers, Green Jelly, who morphed into modern edge Multi-Platinum rockers, Tool and many others. In addition, in various roles Mr. Daly has also worked professionally with many of the classic music legends, such as Roy Buchanan and Nils Lofgren and including writing with Boz Scaggs his seminal ballad 'Slow Dancer', of the Scaggs album of the same name, considered by some as Scaggs' greatest musical achievement, producing Huey Lewis as well as Carlos Santana by serving as the Executive Producer and Line Producer of the Carlos Santana interactive video life story DVD, working closely with Santana as well as Alice Coltrane for the included John Coltrane Material and the Jimi Hendrix family for the Hendrix material in the award-winning The River of Color and Sound  Early life - science and music  Born George William Daly Jr., the second of six siblings, at the US Naval Medical Hospital at Annapolis, MD of Captain George William Daly, Sr., former Deputy Chief of Industrial Relations for the US Navy and Frances Helen Daly, a housewife and artistic mentor to the young George. He showed an aptitude in his early years for both science and invention as well as music, writing his first song in 4th grade and crafting early electric guitars and sound amplifier circuits. In the eighth grade he created a sound over optical light-wave link - his own invention for a school science fair. By his early teens he was playing guitar, bass and keyboards and writing songs resulting in the formation of several garage bands, culminating in the seminal DC garage band, The Hangmen, credited on record with the singles \\"What a Girl Can't Do\\", \\"Faces\\" and \\"Bad Goodbye\\" among others and all released on DC to Nashville's Monument Records, of which \\"...Girl...\\", with its Everly Brothers' Wake Up Little Susie guitar riff and powerful drumming (written and recorded by Hangman Tom Guernsey with Joe Tripplet, also recording included Hangmen drummer Bob Berberich and other session musicians), plus the crowd-pleasing riot-causing Hangmen band's live performance, all pushed the band past the Beatles to the number one position in the DC and Baltimore region, while Daly's original song, Faces, is noted in the 21st century as a prototypical and classic YouTube garage punk rock anthem, still artistically powerful today.  Music industry  250x250px Daly's first post after joining Columbia Records in 1969 was heading the San Francisco A&R; division of Columbia Records under the guidance of Clive Davis This was a time when Columbia Records entered the West Coast rock market with a vengeance, opening both a state-of-the art recording studio (CBS recording studio, Folsom St, San Francisco) and establishing major label Columbia Records' A&R; offices in San Francisco at Fisherman's Wharf. Including that entry point in the music business, Daly has been a senior executive at Columbia Records, Elektra/Asylum Records, Atlantic Records and BMG, four of the all-time biggest U.S. record labels and is presently the CEO of About Records distributed by Universal Music Group/UMG/Fontana. As an A&R; executive, Daly has had responsibility for, and sometimes introduced the world to, many of the ground-breaking music acts that eventually defined their genre and became legends, including Joplin, Carlos Santana, The Cars and Tool among others. Throughout his career he had the opportunity to work directly under such historically significant music business icons such as the all-time legendary \\"golden-eared\\" and ground- breaking executive, A&R; man and producer Clive Davis, the renowned Atlantic Recording Company founder Ahmet Ertegun, as well as \\"songman\\" and longtime music business serial president, CEO and Chairman, of Atco, Atlantic, Warner Music, MCA, Universal Music Group and Sony Music Entertainment, Doug Morris. Daly's tenure in the music businesses' modern high-sales era coincides almost exactly with the rise of the modern \\"tonnage\\" popularity of recorded music, through and up to the present post-modern growth and dominance of the contemporary cloud online streaming delivery systems of social media-oriented and iPhone-format mobile phone channels of distribution including advertiser- based and subscription-based services provided by trillion dollar market value companies such as Apple Inc., Google Alphabet, Amazon Music, Spotify, Pandora Radio and more.  Song writing and music performance  Daly's music career as a songwriter and performer initially involved founding and performing in three historically noteworthy DC bands - The Hangmen, The Dolphin, and Grin. Initially playing guitar and keyboards and writing songs for The Hangmen in 1964, the band, which toured behind a #1 regional hit that pushed the Beatles off the #1 position in local radio charts. Daly's, The Hangmen band performances instigated as least one 3000+ person fan riot in suburban Virginia, written up in Billboard magazine as one of the first such '60's US \\"rock & roll riots\\" prior to the Beatles complete dominance of the charts. He followed this by creating the rarely heard but historically important and short-lived DC folk-blues band, The Dolphin (Sire Records/London Records), in 1967, which included Daly, Berberich, Paul Dowell, and later Nils Lofgren and originally included the guitar immortal Roy Buchanan,American Axe by Phil Carson (c) 2001, BackBeat Books, SF; p.125 called in Rolling Stone Magazine in 1968 \\"one of the three greatest living guitarists\\". He followed up in 1968 by forming the band the Grin, which he founded with fellow Hangmen alumni and drummer friend Bob Berberich and, again with the young accordionist turned telecaster guitarist extraordinaire Nils Lofgren, before Lofgren recorded on several Neil Young albums and later joined Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band. The Daly/Boz Scaggs composition, Slow Dancer, has been recorded by multiple international artists resulting in platinum sales, and used in major market advertising as far away as Japan. Daly's latest song co-writing has been with singer/songwriter Tim Hockenberry, who in May 2012, was judged by Howard Stern on America's Got Talent, and praised with \\"What a breath of fresh air you are! I love you!\\" (Stern) and \\"You are a phenomenal talent!\\" and \\"Out of all the singers we‚Äôve ever seen, Tim Hockenberry is my favorite.\\" http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xquz6k_tim-hockenberry-49-america-s-got- talent-2012-san-francisco-auditions_tv  Technology and patents  Daly holds six US patents for audio and musical devices and is inventor of various audio devices including the early electrical guitar processor, the Moan Tone used by Nils Lofgren and others in live performance and recording and the recording studio device, Master Mount (later sold to Tandy Corp.) and is holder of multiple US Patent beginning with US Patent # 4,151,971 and US Patent 4,074,883, with his latest US DSP and audio-involved patents awarded in 2016 and 2017. As well as the US Patent App. for a DSP audio enhancing technology, HaloField. During a break from the music business of several years, Daly consulted for the US Government's Comcast STC Satellite Television Corporation and designed for Comcast/STC, the PSR2000, the first prototype desktop appliance for digital music downloads, done in conjunction with Hartford Gunn, then President of STC, and prior first president of PBS. In 1997 Daly, at the request of Keith Richards and his producer at the time, fellow industry icon Rob Fraboni, went on the road with The Rolling Stones during their Bridges To Babylon tour and recorded the Stones for six nights on the tour in California and Nevada using Daly's experimental Aura-Live recording technology. These recordings have not been released as of 2019 and are the possession of the Rolling Stones band. At the long-time behest of Fraboni, Daly experimented with multiple technologies over several years before ultimately creating a DSP sound processor, HaloField, a digital audio altering process said to give the same listener perception as the original live sound prior to recording.  Film, video, TV, digital multimedia, and music production  As head of A&R; at three of the largest major record labels as well as his own, Daly has overseen many hundreds of artist signings and productions of album recordings, including multi-platinum artists Janis Joplin, the Cars, Carlos Santana, Tool, Boz Scaggs, Green Jell√ø and many others as well as live recordings of The Rolling Stones, as well as rehearsals and demos with, chronologically, The Hangmen, (originally with himself, David Ottley, Thomas Guernsey, Robert Berberich and Paul Dowell with their album Bittersweet/Monument Records); the Dolphin with Dowell, Berberich, Lofgren and Roy Buchanan on Sire Records; The Grin with Nils Lofgren; The Tubes (rehearsals and studio recording sessions for CBS Records; and other sessions co-produced with Stephen Barncard); Huey Lewis (in Clover, Summers Here/Pyramid Records); recorded his multiple later compositions with famed Byrds singer-songwriter Gene Clark; Marc V (Too True/Elektra Records); Family Brown (Imaginary World/United Artists Records); Grammy‚Ñ¢ Award nominated composer Michael Hopp√© (Simple Pleasures/Seventh Wave); Pamela Polland (Pamela Polland/Columbia Records); Boulder (Boulder, Elektra Records);the earliest recordings of famed singer songwriter Alejandro Escovedohttps://web.archive.org/web/20171014092107/http://www.alejandroescovedo.com/biography// in the early punk/new wave band The Nuns, with Jennifer Miro; Blue Train, (Blue Train, All I Want Is You/BMG) which gave Bertelsmann/BMG/Zoo its first pop Top 40 US Hit; Laura Allan, the singer often cited as the important inspiration to Joni Mitchell in her Blue and post Blue vocal style; Booker T.

Daly also wrote and produced what is believed to be the first digitally recorded (SoundStream‚Ñ¢ system) live music video and TV series, StudioLive‚Ñ¢, short- listed in the Emmy's technical category and starring noted jazz trumpeter Freddie Hubbard and directed by Ric Trader with music composed and conducted by noted TV and jazz composer, Allyn Ferguson. The digital audio music for this production was released on Elektra Records/WEA as the album Fly Like The Wind and the one-hour TV pilot is marketed to consumers by Sony Home Video and is broadcast on PBS. Daly also wrote, produced and served as an Executive Producer of the multimedia life story of Carlos Santana, The River of Color and Sound for Polygram Multimedia. Daly and Colin Farish created the pilot television show Sanctuary of Sound‚Ñ¢ with Daly on-screen and in discussion with such music business notables as Narada Michael Walden and Ben Fong-Torres. As a filmmaker, Daly co-directed and co-wrote, along with Gary Yost, the multiple award-winning documentary film on the restoration of Marin County's iconic Mount Tamalpais: The Invisible Peak. Additionally, Daly produced all the music and sound design in the film, which includes soundtrack compositions by composers Grammy nominated Michael Hopp√©, and multiple Emmy award-winning Ron Alan Cohen. Daly has also served as a consultant to the Smithsonian Institution, where he produced the long-running Star Spangled Banner original instrument exhibit recording at the National Museum of American History site in Washington, DC. Daly consulted with the Smithsonian Institution to record and produce for the Federal institution a unique version of the 1844 version of Francis Scott Key's original Star Spangled Banner using a modern studio orchestra playing in a state-of-the art recording studio, but using the original and rare musical instruments from the early 19th century; these instruments were made available to Daly for his music production by the National Museum of American History with the help of and in conjunction with Dr. Arthur Mollela, then department Chairman of the National Museum of American History at the Smithsonian Institution. Advising as a chief consultant, Daly was integral to the development and launch of the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) Ultimate Sound streaming service.https://advisorintel.com/?page_id=22  Teen Hoot  To give back to youth in music, Daly co-founded the Teen Hoot with iconic Nashville super- producer David Malloy.

Description Six stone circles are visible on the moor immediately east of the derelict Moss Farm.Machrie Moor Stone Circles, Historic Scotland, accessed 1 May 2014 Some circles are formed of granite boulders, while others are built of tall red sandstone pillars. The moor is covered with other prehistoric remains, including standing stones, burial cairns and cists. The stone circles are positioned over previous timber circles. A radiocarbon date of 2030 ¬± 180 BCE has been found for the timber circle at Machrie Moor 1. Several hut circles can also be seen as low rings of turf-covered stone. Map of the Machrie Moor Stone Circles The six stone circles are situated below a prominent notch on the skyline to the northeast where Machrie Glen divides into two steep-sided valleys. At the summer solstice the notch is intersected by the sun at sunrise, and this may explain why the circles were sited in this location. The stone circles were recorded in 1861 by James Bryce, and numbered 1 to 5.\\"Machrie Moor\\" in Current Archaeology (1988), page 35 Five other monuments in the area were numbered 6 to 10, and when subsequently a further stone circle was discovered almost completely submerged in peat in 1978, it was numbered Machrie Moor 11. Around 1 kilometer to the west is the remains of the Moss Farm Road Stone Circle,Moss Farm Road Stone Circle, Historic Scotland, accessed 1 May 2014 (Machrie Moor 10). =Machrie Moor 1= Machrie Stone Circle 1 Machrie Moor 1 () is an ellipse with axes 12.7 metres and 14.6 metres. It is formed from six granite boulders and five sandstone slabs, arranged alternately. Four of the granite blocks have fallen. =Machrie Moor 2= Machrie Stone Circle 2 Machrie Moor 2 () is the most visually striking of the circles on Machrie Moor. This circle has a diameter of 13.7 metres, and may originally have consisted of seven or eight tall sandstone slabs, three of which survive intact, while stumps of others may be seen. The heights of the three intact stones range from 3.7 metres to 4.9 metres. Within the circle are two large stones, apparently cut from a fallen pillar, one of which now has a central hole as if for conversion to a millstone. Excavations in 1861 revealed a cist in the centre of the circle. A food vessel was found in this central cist. A second, empty, short cist was found between the centre and the northeast upright stone. =Machrie Moor 3= Machrie Stone Circle 3 Machrie Moor 3 () originally consisted of nine stones. Only one still stands, 4.3 metres high, but the stumps of others are still partially visible in the peat. The stones form a geometrical egg- shape. Excavations in 1861 uncovered a small cist in the centre containing an urn with some fragments of burnt bone and flint flakes. A second cist was found 1 metre south of the centre; it contained a crouched burial, also with some flint flakes. =Machrie Moor 4= Machrie Stone Circle 4 Machrie Moor 4 () consists of four granite blocks, about 0.9 metres high. Excavations in 1861 uncovered a cist in the centre. In it was an inhumation accompanied by a food vessel, a bronze awl, and three flint flakes. =Machrie Moor 5= Machrie Stone Circle 5 Machrie Moor 5 () called \\"Suidh Coire Fhionn\\" or \\"Fingal's Cauldron Seat\\" consists of two concentric rings of granite boulders. The inner circle is 12.0 metres in diameter and consists of eight granite boulders. Excavations in 1861 uncovered an empty, ruined cist in the centre. The outer circle is approximately 18.0 metres in diameter and is formed of fifteen granite boulders. The outer circle is said to form a geometrical egg-shape. =Machrie Moor 11= Machrie Stone Circle 11 Machrie Moor 11 () is a low stone circle with a diameter of around 13 metres. The tallest of the stones is about 1.2 metres high on the western side. Excavations in 1978-9 revealed 10 upright stones, with a pit between each stone possibly representing a post- hole. =Other prehistoric remains= James Bryce listed five other antiquities to the west of the stone circles in 1861. Machrie Moor 6 () is the remains of a possible chambered cairn consisting of two touching upright stone slabs at right angles. Machrie Moor 7 () is a standing stone 1.6 metres tall. Machrie Moor 8 () is the remains of a probable chambered cairn comprising an oval spread of stones approximately 20 metres by 16 metres. The most obvious feature is a 1.8 metre tall standing stone within the east edge of the cairn surrounded by several smaller stones which may have been part of a chamber or facade. Machrie Moor 9 () was a standing stone of which no obvious trace remains. Machrie Moor 10 () is the Moss Farm Road Stone Circle.

Longo (born October 9, 1967) is an Italian-American biogerontologist and cell biologist known for his studies on the role of fasting and nutrient response genes on cellular protection aging and diseases and for proposing that longevity is regulated by similar genes and mechanisms in many eukaryotes. He is currently a professor at the USC Davis School of Gerontology with a joint appointment in the department of Biological Sciences as well as serving as the director of the USC Longevity Institute.  Early life and education  Longo was born in Genoa, Italy to Calabrian parents.Longo, Valter, during XII Premio Simpatia della Calabria, Reggio di C, 4 September 2018 He moved to Chicago in the United States as a teenager in order to become a professional rock guitarist, and lived with extended relatives. While there, he observed that his relatives in the United States, who were eating diets rich in fat, meat and sugar, were suffering from cardiovascular disease, which was rare among his family living in Italy. He joined the United States Army Reserve as a way to pay for college, attending recruit training in Fort Knox. He then attended the University of North Texas College of Music due to its renown as a jazz school, studying under Dan Haerle and Jack Petersen, among others. While in college, Longo decided to change focus and study nutrition and longevity instead, inspired in part by his observations about his relatives, as well as his experience in military training. He graduated from the University of North Texas in 1992 with a degree in biochemistry. In 1992 he joined the laboratory of \\"calorie restriction\\" pioneer Roy Walford at UCLA where he studied calorie restriction and aging of the immune system. He completed his PhD work in Biochemistry studying antioxidant enzymes and anti- aging genes under Joan Valentine at UCLA in 1997 and his postdoctoral training in the neurobiology of Alzheimer's Disease under Caleb Finch at the University of Southern California.  Career  Since 1997, Longo has been a faculty member at the USC Davis School of Gerontology and Ethel Percy Andrus Gerontology Center. He is a member of the formation of USC's Biology of Aging program as well as the director of the USC Longevity Institute, also launched the USC Davis School of Gerontology's first study-abroad program, a summer class in the nutrition and genetics of aging in Italy. In 2011, he was profiled on Through the Wormhole with Morgan Freeman for his longevity-related research.  Fasting mimicking diet  Longo's fasting-mimicking diet is a low-calorie, low-protein, moderate-carbohydrate, moderate-fat meal program that is claimed to mimic the effects of periodic fasting or water fasting over the course of five days, while still aiming to provide the body with nutrition. FMD is considered a periodic fast. Longo developed the diet at the University of Southern California. He believes that it is possible to mimic the effects of fasting with a meal program that is designed to inhibit the same metabolic pathways fasting would, thereby providing the body with nutrients that do not trigger the body‚Äôs growth responses. Fasting mimicking diet is trademarked by L-Nutra, a company partially owned by Longo with financial interest by USC, though Longo does not receive any financial benefits from the company.

History The castle is first mentioned in 1219 as in arce Clanx, named after the Sax family holding in the Calanca valley. It was built by the Abbot of St. Gall Ulrich von Sax (1204‚Äì20) and his brother, the Abbey-Vogt Heinrich. The castle quickly became the center of the Abbey's lands in Appenzell. In 1236 Heinrich's uncle, the famous knight and minnes√§nger Heinrich III von Sax, took over the castle. During a contested election for Abbot of St. Gall in 1272, Ulrich von G√ºttingen received support from the Habsburgs in exchange for a promise to take the castle and lands away from the Sax family. Two years later, in 1274, Heinrich III was forced out and the Habsburg knight Ulrich von Ramschwag was given the castle. In 1277 Abbot Rumo von Ramstein traded Blatten Castle and other estates with Ulrich von Ramschwag, bringing Clanx back under the Abbey's control. In 1278 the Appenzellers revolted against the Abbot and unsuccessfully attacked Clanx. In 1289, the Habsburgs attacked Clanx in an attempt to gain control over Appenzell. After a six-week siege, the Habsburg forces paid the castle's defenders a bribe to open the castle gates. The defenders departed in peace and the castle was burned. The Abbot was eventually victorious in the war against the Habsburgs. In 1298 he rebuilt Clanx Castle and continued to administer and control Appenzell from it. Over the following century the relationship between the Abbot and Appenzell worsened. In 1401 Appenzell revolted and began the Appenzell Wars. One of the first actions of the Appenzell army was to besiege and apparently quickly take Clanx. However, a few months later, the castle was back under the Abbot's control. In the following year a combined army from Appenzell and the city of St. Gallen attacked and captured Clanx. This time the victorious army decided to burn the castle before they left. After the Appenzell Wars, the Abbey retained control over the ruined castle and the hill on which it stood. In 1491, they sold the ruins and surrounding land to a private owner. In 1885, the castle ruins were rediscovered during construction of a restaurant. The restaurant was completed, but destroyed in a storm in the same year. In 1949 the foundations of a strong square tower, a smaller corner tower on the highest point of the hill and parts of the walls were excavated. Castle site Today the eastern half of the castle as well as part of the western wall have been excavated and repaired. The castle gate, south-east of the main tower, was reconstructed in 1949. The main tower is a large, square building in size with walls that are up to thick.

Der Tod Jesu (The Death of Jesus) is an oratorio libretto by Karl Wilhelm Ramler. In its setting by Carl Heinrich Graun in 1755, it was the most often performed Passion of the 18th century in Germany. The poem is part of the Empfindsamkeit movement of the 1750s. It is the middle of three oratorio texts by Ramler ‚Äì Die Hirten bei der Krippe zu Bethlehem, Der Tod Jesu, and Die Auferstehung und Himmelfahrt ‚Äì which may have been viewed by Ramler as a libretto cycle, though they were never set as a cycle by any composer.Howard E. Smither A History of the Oratorio 2000 p. 88 \\"One might also view the three texts by Carl Wilhelm Ramler ‚Äì Die Hirten bei der Krippe zu Bethlehem, Der Tod Jesu, and Die Auferstehung und Himmelfahrt ‚Äì as a libretto cycle, but these seem never to have been set by a single composer.\\" The libretto was intended for Graun but a copy of Ramler's text was somehow received by Telemann who produced his own setting of the oratorio (TWV 5:6) in Hamburg before Graun could perform the premiere in Berlin. Ramler revised his text in 1760. The text is not a full retelling of the Passion of Christ and it does not quote Bible texts. Instead, it presents emotively various aspects of the Passion. Settings * Georg Philipp Telemann, Hamburg 1755, TWV 5:6 * Carl Heinrich Graun, Berlin 1755 ‚Äì the best known of the settings; it was performed yearly in many cities in Germany throughout the second half of the 18th century. The Australian premiere of Graun's passion cantata took place on Good Friday 2012 in St John's Cathedral in Brisbane with the Badinerie Players and the Brisbane Chamber Choir under Michael O'Loghlin and with Shelli Hulcombe (soprano), Bethany Shepherd (soprano), Gregory Massingham (tenor), Jason Barry-Smith (bass).\\"Good Friday Musical devotion\\", The Cathedral Chamber Choir perform Der Tod Jesu Adolf Friedrich Hesse (1809‚Äì1863) composed an Organ Introduction, Op. 84, to Graun's work. * Johann Christoph Friedrich Bach, cantata (1769) BR D 2 / Wf XIV:1, based on Ramler's revised version from 1760 * Joseph Martin Kraus to his own libretto (1776), in the Sturm und Drang style * Anna Amalia, Abbess of Quedlinburg, used by Johann Kirnberger as models of counterpoint in his Die Kunst des reinen Satzes in der Musik (The art of pure musical composition) (1779) Compositional style Unlike Bach's Passions, Graun's setting does not imbue the tenor soloist with the role of narrator or Evangelist, nor is the bass cast as Vox Christi. The music is post-Baroque, an italianate galant style, and contains little counterpoint (notably in the duet, no. 17) or fugal movements (chorus no. 14 is a double fugue). Instead, it gives prominence to melody and voice. All arias are da capo arias with stylistic borrowings from opera arias. Grauner's recitative settings are highly expressive, culminating in the moving simplicity of the bass's recitative no. 23 on the death of Jesus, \\"\\" (He is no more!). The last chorus starts quite powerfully, but then ebbs away into a mystical silence. Movements Graun's settings consists of 25 movements: ;Part 1 #Chorale ‚Äì Du, dessen Augen flossen #Chorus ‚Äì Sein Odem ist schwach #Accompanied recitative (soprano) ‚Äì Gethsemane!

He has been a regular member of the Tango Concertino and Trio Troika in Trondheim, and now plays in ensembles Quinteto Nidaros (piazzollaquintet - bandoneon, violin, electric guitar, piano and double bass) and Cholo tango duet/trio.  Biography  = Education = Simonsen is basically self-taught musician from the early 60 - century with accordion as the main instrument. As early as 12 years old he accompanied Elisabeth Granneman on a show in Oppdal. In 1962 he formed, along with Harald S√¶ther on guitar and Harald √òiamo on percussion the dance orchestra Simonsens Trio. The trio disbanded in 1964. In 1969 he started his musical education at the Veitvet Music Conservatory in Oslo accordion as the main instrument. After two years at this institution he continued his studies up to the musician / music teacher at the Trondheim Conservatory of Music in Trondheim until the spring of 1974. In 1996 he went to Paris to study bandoneon with Juan Jos√© Mosalini. This study took two years. Later, he has repeatedly been in Buenos Aires where he received further training for N√©stor Marconi. In 2013, he took executive master's degree on the bandoneon at NTNU Trondheim Conservatory of Music. In recent years Simonsen has also regularly traveled to Rosario in Argentina to seek inspiration and delve deeper into the Latin American tango culture. His association with Rosario has always been the bandoneonist Rodolfo (Cholo) Montironi who has also been his tutor and contact in this environment. = Career = His main career as a music teacher, he has held in Trondheim municipal Culture School. At this institution he founded accordion group Bajan in 1979. Bajan participated in several competitions and won several 1st Prices in chamber music and entertainment music. Here he also built up the only provision that exists in the Nordic countries for the instrument bandoneon. One result of this is building up the tango orchestra Tangueros del norte, established by Simonsen in 2003, with students from Trondheim Municipal Music School. Simonsen was musical director for Tangueros del norte until 2008. Simonsen otherwise has given its name to all the ensembles he has been the initiator or co-creator of Tango Conertino (initiated by Sveinung Lillebjerka, √òrnulf Lillebjerka and K√•re Simonsen), Quinteto Nidaros, Trio Troika, Cholo Tango Duet / Trio and Tangueros Del Norte.

Her paternal grandmother and namesake was the writer Sophia Bledsoe Herrick. Sophie was educated at home and had a brief marriage at age 21 that gave her the surname of Aberle. Aberle started to attend University of California in Berkeley but switched to Stanford University, earning a bachelor's degree in 1923, a master's degree in 1925, and a Ph.D. in genetics in 1927.

A Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire Miners' Association was founded in 1863 or 1864, but this became moribund during the 1870s. However, some branches at local mines remained active, including trade unionists such as Samuel Smith, Aaron Stewart and William Hardy. In 1881, they constituted a new Nottingham Miners' Federation based on the rules of the old union, and by the start of 1884, membership had risen to more than 2,000. That year, two unsuccessful strikes took place and membership halved. In response, the union elected new officials and adopted a new name, the \\"Nottinghamshire Miners' Association\\", and constitution.Alan R. Griffin, A History of the Nottinghamshire Miners, Part I, pp.11-39 In 1889, the Association was a founder member of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain.Alan R. Griffin, A History of the Nottinghamshire Miners, Part I, p.64 In 1926, at the height of the General Strike, General Secretary George Alfred Spencer on behalf of the Nottinghamshire Miners Association, negotiated a deal with the local mine owners at the request of miners from the Digby pit near Eastwood, Nottinghamshire in Nottinghamshire. However, this brought him into conflict with the Miners' Federation of Great Britain, who wished to see the strike continue. Unhappy with the influence of the MFGB, Spencer led a breakaway from the NMA, supported by moderates such as John Hancock, setting up the Nottinghamshire and District Miners' Industrial Union (NMIU) based mostly in The Dukeries. The NMIU lasted for eleven years separate from the Miners' Federation of Great Britain. In 1937, an agreement was reached between the NMA and the NMIU and they merged to form the Nottinghamshire Miners' Federated Union, with Spencer becoming the President. In 1945, the union became the Nottinghamshire Area of the National Union of Mineworkers. During the 1984-1985 miners' strike, the majority of the members broke away to form the Union of Democratic Mineworkers.

Los Angeles County Museum of Art, M.2007.211.3. A caraco is a style of woman's jacket that was fashionable from the mid-18th to early 19th centuries. Caracos were thigh- length and opened in front, with tight three-quarter or long sleeves. Like gowns of the period, the back of the caraco could be fitted to the waist or could hang in pleats from the shoulder in the style of a sack back. Caracos were generally made of printed linen or cotton.Cumming et al. (2010), p. 40Takeda and Spilker (2010), p. 141. The caraco emerged as an informal style in France in the 1760s, based on working-class jackets. It was worn with a petticoat and, if open in front, a stomacher or decorative stays. The English caraco was generally closed in front. A similar garment with a wrap front, called in English a bedgown or short gown, was the standard working woman's costume of the later 18th century.

The square supports the PATH network connection between Metro Hall and nearby buildings such as Metro Centre. Glass pavilions provide access to the PATH network. History Pecaut Square was built as part of Toronto's postmodern Metro Hall project, meant to house the government of the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto, which existed from 1954 to 1998. The agreement to build Metro Hall was signed in 1988, and the project was completed in 1992. It was formerly known as Metro Square but was renamed in April 2011 by a unanimous Toronto City Council vote to honour the late civic leader David Pecaut. Culture and amenities The public space features Canadian sculptor Bernie Miller's The Poet, The Fever Hospital, a 1992 piece made up of galvanized steel, bronze, granite, and marble. The sculpture incorporates a fountain and reflecting pool. The title refers to the poet Isabella Valancy Crawford, who stayed for a brief time in a house that was demolished for the construction of Metro Hall at the southeast corner of King and John Streets. The fever hospital refers to one of Toronto's first hospitals, which stood at the northeast corner of King and John Streets from 1829 to 1856. Sheltered by a large granite wall, four bronze boxes evoking television monitors stacked nearly 5 metres high form a fountain. The water flows into a marble basin and into the reflecting pool. The boxes are framed with a semi-circular steel beam, perforated with small holes and mounted at a gentle tilt. The reflecting pool also has an eternal flame fueled by natural gas, unveiled in 1996. The Eternal Flame of Hope is inspired by the perseverance of disabled people, and burns as a reminder that society must be all-inclusive. Also located at the southwestern part of the square is Jaan Poldaas' Surface Design for Tampered Windscreens (1992), a sculpture composed of tempered glass screens which functions as a windbreak. The screens are etched with vertical and horizontal lines to create different relationships, and are arranged so that people can walk between them. Cynthia Short's Remembered Sustenance (1992) is piece composed of 19 small and generic bronze animals on the grass just off the sidewalk on Wellington Street West. Half the animals appear to be headed for a bronze feeding dish while the other half seem to be walking away. Pecaut Square also has a lawn and trees along its outer edges. The public space allows for unique views of Metro Hall, Roy Thomson Hall and the Royal Alexandra Theatre. It is frequently used for free concerts, film screenings, and other events; for the state funeral of Jack Layton on August 27, 2011, the square was used to accommodate a screening for overflow crowds not able to be seated inside Roy Thomson Hall.

It flanks the end of Frederiksborggade, where it turns into the Queen Louise Bridge, at the intersection with √òster and N√∏rre S√∏gade. History =Background= When Copenhagen was still a fortified city, Frederiksborggade, passing through the Northern City Gate, used to be one of the main roads leading in and out of town, taking travellers north toward Frederiksborg Castle. After the Northern City Gate was demolished in 1853 and a law definitively provided for the decommissioning of the fortifications in 1868, redevelopment of the land outside the gate began and the present day N√∏rrebro district emerged with N√∏rrebrogade, the continuation of Frederiksborggade on the other side of The Lakes, as its central artery. =Construction= The S√∏torvet development was built from 1873 to 1875 by the Copenhagen Building Company, a real estate company founded the previous year by Carl Frederik Tietgen together with a circle of prominent citizens including Carlsberg-founder J. C. Jacobsen, manufacturer Lauritz Peter Holmblad, later Prime Minister Tage Reedtz-Thott, and later Speaker of the Danish Landsting Carl Christian Vilhelm Liebe. The architects were Ferdinand Vilhelm Jensen and Vilhelm Petersen under supervision of Ferdinand Meldahl, one of the leading Danish architects of the period. =After the inauguration= S√∏torvet When the buildings were completed, Johanne Luise Heiberg was one of the first residents. At this point, the Queen Louise Bridge had still not been built. It was constructed a decade later to the design of Vilhelm Dahlerup, another leading architect of the time. In about 1900, the Caf√© de la Reine opened at S√∏torvet 2, further contributing to the French ambiance of the locale. It had outdoor service under a roof and was therefore nicknamed Caf√© la' det regne (\\"Caf√© let it rain\\"), a play on how the French name sounds in Danish. In the 1930s, the caf√© became a hangout for poets such as Sigfred Pedersen and Otto Gelsted who would often recite their poems standing on the tables. Niels Clemmensen sat behind the piano. When Nazi Germany occupied Denmark in 1940, the caf√© closed. The corner of Vendersgade and N√∏rre S√∏gade Architecture S√∏torvet stands as a gateway to the Inner City, coming from N√∏rrebro, but was not planned as such. Supposedly it aggravated Meldahl that a development of similar prominence was never built on the N√∏rrebro end of the bridge. The development consists of four buildings, symmetrically arranged with the two buildings on one side of Frederiksborggade mirroring the two on the other side. Named Gothersgade and Venthersgade, a reference to the Goths and the Wends in the title King of the Goths and the Wends which was used by Danish kings from the 14th century until 1972, the two streets separating the buildings on each their side of Frederiksborggade repeat the symmetry. The design of the buildings in the 19th-century Neo-Renaissance style was inspired by the architecture of French castles and Haussmann's developments in Paris. The buildings have rich stucco ornamentation and are topped with towers and spires. Statury There are two bronze statues on the square, the Tiberen and the Nilen which are replicas of two 1st century statues discovered during excavations in Rome in the 16th century. They were donated by Carl Jacobsen's Albertina Trust.

The case was brought by Sharp as receivers for Albyn Construction Ltd, a building company who had sold a house in Aberdeen to the Thomsons, a brother and sister. Albyn had agreed to sell the house to the Thomsons leading to the completion of the missives and the delivery of the disposition and the payment of the purchase price. However, before the disposition was registered by the Thomsons, Albyn defaulted on a loan taken by them from the Bank of Scotland. The default lead to the crystallization of a floating charge held by the bank over all of Albyn's \\"Property and Undertaking\\", and Sharp was appointed Receiver to collect this for the Bank. Sharp raised an action before the Court of Session contesting that, since the disposition hadn't been registered, the ownership of the house remained with Albyn at the time of Crystallization and that it and the purchase price was available to the Bank as holder of the charge. The Thomsons responded that the act of delivering the disposition divulged Albyn of any \\"Beneficial Interest\\" in the house and that this was enough to remove it from the scope of the charge. The Inner House of the Court of Session found in favour of Sharp. In giving the leading opinion, The Lord President (Hope) drew on historical sources to argue that Scotland has, and has always had, a unitary system of property law and that ownership could only lie with the holder of the recorded title. As the Thomsons had not recorded the disposition, title remained with Albyn and so the house was available to Sharp. The Thomsons appealed to the House of Lords. The Court overruled the Inner House and found in favour of the Thomsons. The House gave two main reasons for its decision. Lord Jauncey upheld the Thomsons' argument that, because in delivering the disposition, Albyn could no longer make use of or sell the house, it had no \\"Beneficial Interest\\" in the house and this was enough to remove it from being part of its property. Lord Jauncey commented that the ability to sell the house in fraud of the disposition did not amount to a right in property. Lord Clyde offered different reasoning. He said that the term \\"Property and Undertaking\\" used in the Charge Agreement and the legislation had to be construed in its context. He said the Court of Session was wrong to ascribe it a technical meaning. He said that a proper construction of the term was to include only what the company could make use of in its day-to-day business dealings and not all its property in a strict legal sense. The case caused great confusion in Scottish Conveyancers and academics who saw it as over-turning the long established Scots law principle that ownership could not be divided. However, the effect of the case was greatly reduced by the House of Lords in 2004 in Burnett's Trustee v Grainger [2004] UKHL 8 where the Court held that Sharp v Thomson was authority only for holders of floating charges. For all other sales of property where the seller goes bankrupt or into sequestration, the rule that applies is that owner is the holder of the registered title.

Separate buckles remained fashionable until they were abandoned along with high-heeled footwear and other aristocratic fashions in the years after the French Revolution,Tortora and Eubank (1995), p. 272 although they were retained as part of ceremonial and court dress until well into the 20th century. In Britain in 1791 an attempt was made by buckle manufactures to stop change in fashion by appealing to the then Prince of Wales Prince George. While the prince did start to require them for his court this didn't stop the decline of the shoe buckle. It has been suggested that the decline drove the manufacturers of steel buckles to diversify into producing a range of cut steel jewellery.  Knee buckle  Knee buckles are used to fasten the knee- high boots just below the level of the knee.

It is one of the oldest noble families in Scandinavia. The family surname appears, in the form of Guildenstern, in William Shakespeare's tragedy The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark (see Rosencrantz and Guildenstern). The surname should not be confused with Gyldensteen (\\"Golden Stone\\"), the name of another short-lived Danish noble family, first recorded in 1717 and which became extinct in 1749. The family has a prominent position in Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish history. It belonged to the higher nobility, and paradoxically, in Sweden it supported the absolute monarchy. The member with the highest standing was the noblewoman Kristina Nilsdotter Gyllenstierna, who as Sten Sture the younger's wife was regent consort of Sweden. Denmark The oldest known man in the family is the knight Lord Nils Eriksson of √Ög√•rd in Jutland, who is mentioned in 1314 in relationship to Store Restrup Manor (Store Restrup Herreg√•rd) in Aalborg. He was the father of Lord Erik Nilsson of √Ög√•rd, who had a son Lord Nils Eriksson of √Ög√•rd. With this Nils's sons Knud, Peder, and Erik Nilss√∏ner, the family was divided into three primary branches: Restrup, √Ög√•rd, and Demstrup. The family in Denmark became extinct in 1729. Norway The Danish knight Mogens Henriksen Gyldenstierne (‚Ä† 1569) was from 1527 feudal lord of Akershus. In 1532, he was succeeded at Akershus Fortress by his relative Erik Olufsen Gyldenstierne (‚Ä† 1536). The Danish minister Axel Gyldenstierne (ca. 1542‚Äì1603) was Governor-general of Norway during the period 1588‚Äì1601. Sweden In the first part of the 15th century, the family came to Sweden with Erik Eriksson of F√•gelvik, who after a while married Kristina Karlsdotter (1432-ca 1500), the daughter of King Charles VIII of Sweden. Among their children was Nils Eriksson Gyllenstierna (d. 1495), who was the father of Kristina Nilsdotter Gyllenstierna, regent consort of Sweden. In 1569, Nils G√∂ransson (1526‚Äì1601) was elevated to a baronial estate as baronial Gyllenstierna af Lundholm. Lundholmen Manor is located in Vrigstad parish within J√∂nk√∂ping. Members of this branch of the family are still living in Sweden. After Scania was included as a part of Sweden by the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658, a now extinct branch of the Danish family was introduced to the House of Nobility. The Vinstrop branch became barons in 1651, while four branches were given the rank of count. All these are extinct. File:Gyllenstierna_Bj%C3%B6rkesund_G45.jpgCounts of Bj√∂rkesund.

Led by Douglas Mawson, the party aimed to explore the area far to the east of their main base in Ad√©lie Land, pushing about towards Victoria Land. Accompanying Mawson were Belgrave Edward Ninnis, a lieutenant in the Royal Fusiliers, and Swiss ski expert Xavier Mertz; the party used sledge dogs to increase their speed across the ice. Initially they made good progress, crossing two huge glaciers on their route south-east. On 14 December 1912, with the party more than from the safety of the main base at Cape Denison, Ninnis and the sledge he was walking beside broke through the snow lid of a crevasse and were lost. Their supplies now severely compromised, Mawson and Mertz turned back west, gradually shooting the remaining sledge dogs for food to supplement their scarce rations. As they crossed the first glacier on their return journey Mertz became sick, making progress difficult. After almost a week of making very little headway Mertz died, leaving Mawson to carry on alone. For almost a month he pulled his sledge across the Antarctic, crossing the second glacier, despite an illness that increasingly weakened him. Mawson reached the comparative safety of Aladdin's Cave‚Äîa food depot from the main base‚Äîon 1 February 1913, only to be trapped there for a week while a blizzard raged outside. As a result, he missed the ship back to Australia; the had sailed on 8 February, just hours before his return to Cape Denison, after waiting for more than three weeks. With a relief party, Mawson remained at Cape Denison until the Aurora returned the following summer in December 1913. The causes of Mertz's death and Mawson's related illness remain uncertain; a 1969 study suggested hypervitaminosis A, presumably caused by the men eating the livers of their Greenland huskies, which are now known to be unusually high in vitamin A. While this is considered the most likely theory, dissenting opinions suggest prolonged cold exposure or psychological stresses. In 1976 explorer and mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary described Mawson's month-long journey as \\"probably the greatest story of lone survival in Polar exploration\\".Edmund Hillary (1976) in Bickel (2000), p. x.  Background  Last photo of the Far Eastern Party, 17 November 1912 The Australasian Antarctic expedition, commanded by Douglas Mawson, explored part of East Antarctica between 1911 and 1914. The expedition's main base was established in January 1912, at Cape Denison in Commonwealth Bay, Ad√©lie Land.Ayres (1999), p. 63. This was much farther west than originally intended; dense pack ice had prevented the expedition ship from landing closer to Cape Adare, the original eastern limit.Bickel (2000), p. 43. Only after the Aurora‚Äîheading west‚Äîhad rounded the ice tongue of the Mertz Glacier, was a landing made. Battling katabatic winds that swept down from the Antarctic Plateau, the shore party erected their hut and began preparations for the following summer's sledging expeditions. The men readied clothing, sledges, tents and rations, conducted limited survey parties, and deployed several caches of supplies.Ayres (1999), p. 67.Riffenburgh (2009), p. 87. The most notable of these depots was Aladdin's Cave, excavated from the ice on the slope to the south of the main hut.Riffenburgh (2009), p. 90. On 27 October 1912, Mawson outlined the summer sledging program.Riffenburgh (2009), p. 98. Of the seven sledging parties that would depart from Cape Denison, three would head east. The Eastern Coastal Party, led by the geologist Cecil Madigan, was charged with exploring beyond the Mertz Glacier tongue;Mawson (1996), p. 135. they would initially be supported by the Near Eastern Party led by Frank Leslie Stillwell, which would then turn to mapping the area between Cape Denison and the glacier.Riffenburgh (2009), p. 99. The final party, led by Mawson, would push rapidly inland to the south of the Coastal Party towards Victoria Land, an area he had explored during Ernest Shackleton's Nimrod Expedition in 1908‚Äì1909. He hoped to travel about east, collecting geological data and specimens, mapping the coast, and claiming territory for the crown.Bickel (2000), pp. 78‚Äì79. Assisting him on this Far Eastern Party was Belgrave Edward Ninnis, a lieutenant in the Royal Fusiliers, and the Swiss ski expert Xavier Mertz.Riffenburgh (2009), p. 42. They were in charge of the expedition's Greenland huskies, who would be crucial if the party was to cover the distance at the speed Mawson intended. Ninnis and Mertz had spent the winter preparing the dogs for the journey, sewing harnesses and teaching them to run in teams with the sledges.Bickel (2000), p. 67.Bickel (2000), p. 77. Each of the parties was required to return to Cape Denison by 15 January 1913, to allow time for the Aurora to collect them and escape Antarctic waters unencumbered by the winter sea ice.Bickel (2000), p. 81.  Journey eastwards  Mawson at Aladdin's Cave during the outward journey Blizzards prevented the parties from leaving Cape Denison until 10 November 1912, four days after the scheduled start date. In his diary, Mertz recorded the clearing weather as \\"definitely a good omen\\".Ayres (1999), p. 70. Mawson wrote a short letter to his fianc√©e, Paquita Delprat: \\"The weather is fine this morning though the wind still blows. We shall get away in an hour's time. I have two good companions, Dr Mertz and Lieut. Ninnis. It is unlikely that any harm will happen to us, but should I not return to you in Australia, please know that I truly loved you. I must be closing now as the others are waiting.\\" Allowing Madigan and Stillwell's parties a head-start, Mawson, Ninnis, Mertz and the seventeen dogs left Cape Denison early in the afternoon, reaching Aladdin's Cave four hours later.Bickel (2000), pp. 86‚Äì87.Riffenburgh (2009), p. 103. Stopping for the night, they took on extra supplies and rearranged the sledges. The first team of dogs would haul a train of two sledges, which collectively carried half the weight of the party's supplies. The remaining supplies were put on the third sledge, towed by the second dog team. Heading south the following day to avoid crevasses to the east, they travelled about before poor weather forced them to stop and camp. Strong winds confined them to the tent until 13 November, and they were able to travel just a short distance before the weather picked up again. For three more days they remained in their tent, unable even to light the stove.Bickel (2000), pp. 90‚Äì91. When the weather cleared on 16 November, Madigan and Stillwell's parties joined them.Riffenburgh (2009), p. 105. The three parties travelled together for much of the following day, before Mawson's party separated and pushed on ahead in the late afternoon.Bickel (2000), p. 92. = Mertz and Ninnis Glaciers = Heading south-east towards the Mertz Glacier, with Mertz skiing ahead and Mawson and Ninnis driving the dogs, the party covered on 18 November.Riffenburgh (2009), pp. 106‚Äì107. This was despite encountering sastrugi‚Äîridges in the ice caused by wind‚Äîas high as , that caused the dogs to slip and the sledges to roll.Bickel (2000), p. 96.Mawson (1988), p. 132. During the day they passed two peaks, which Mawson named Madigan Nunatak and Aurora Peak, after the leader of the Eastern Coastal Party and the expedition's ship.Riffenburgh (2009), p. 106. The following day they began the steep descent to the Mertz Glacier. After the sledges several times overtook the dogs, the huskies were allowed to run free down the slope.Riffenburgh (2009), p. 108. Following a particularly steep descent the following day, half of Mawson's team of dogs‚Äîreattached to his sledges‚Äîwere almost lost when they fell into a crevasse. They were hauled out, but Mawson decided to camp when one of the dogs, Ginger Bitch, gave birth to the first in a litter of 14 pups.Bickel (2000), pp. 99‚Äì100. Over the next several days, the party continued across the glacier. They developed a method of crossing the many crevasses; the forerunner, on skis, would cross the snow covering the hole‚Äîthe lid‚Äîand once across the first of the two dog teams would follow. Only after the first dog team was across would the second follow, \\"otherwise\\", wrote Mawson, \\"the dogs in the rear would make a course direct for wherever the front dogs happened to be, cutting across corners and probably dragging their sledge sideways into a crevasse\\".Riffenburgh (2009), pp. 109‚Äì110. But despite their precautions Ninnis fell down and was rescued from three crevasses, once when they found they had pitched their tent on its lip.Riffenburgh (2009), pp. 108‚Äì109. After Mawson slipped into a crevasse, they began to tie themselves to their sledges as a precaution.Bickel (2000), p. 102. Ninnis developed photokeratitis (snow-blindness), which Mawson treated with zinc sulfate and cocaine hydrochloride.Mawson (1996), p. 146. They were also losing dogs; one broke his leg and was shot, another fell ill, and a third was lost down a crevasse.Bickel (2000), p. 101. On 24 November, the party reached the eastern side of the glacier and ascended to the plateau.Mawson (1996), p. 151. On level ground again, they began to make quick progress. They awoke on the morning of 27 November to find another glacier (later known as the Ninnis Glacier) far larger than the first.Bickel (2000), p. 105.Riffenburgh (2009), p. 110. As with the first glacier, they had to unhitch the dogs from the sledges and slowly make the treacherous descent. Once at the bottom of the glacier they spent four days crossing fields of crevasses, battling strong winds and poor light that made navigation difficult.Riffenburgh (2009), pp. 110‚Äì111. In the harsh conditions, the dogs began to grow restless; one of them, Shackleton, tore open the men's food bag and devoured a pack of butter, crucial for their nourishment to supplement the hoosh.Bickel (2000), p. 106. On 30 November, the party reached the eastern limit of the glacier and began the ascent to the plateau beyond, only to find themselves confronted at the top by sastrugi so sharp-edged the dogs were useless.Bickel (2000), p. 107. Worse still, temperatures rose to , melting the snow and making pulling difficult; the party switched to travelling at night to avoid the worst of the conditions.Riffenburgh (2009), p. 112. From atop the ridge on the eastern side of the Ninnis Glacier, Mawson began to doubt the accuracy of the reports of land to the east by Charles Wilkes during the 1838‚Äì1842 United States Exploring Expedition. By Wilkes' reckoning, Mawson recorded in his diary, \\"We now appear to be off the real continent edge.\\"Mawson (1988), p. 140. Concerned about overlap with Madigan's party to the north, he turned his party south. They made good progress initially, but beginning on 6 December a blizzard confined them to their tent for three days. On 9 December, they set off again, but Ninnis was struggling. He had developed neuralgia on the left side of his face and a whitlow on one of his fingers. The latter was making sleep difficult for him, and, on 13 December, Mawson lanced the finger.Bickel (2000), pp. 109‚Äì112. = Death of Ninnis = \\"We could do nothing,\\" wrote Mertz in his diary after Ninnis' death. \\"We were standing, helplessly, next to a friend's grave, my best friend of the whole expedition.\\" On the evening of 13 December Mawson and Mertz rearranged the sledges. The rear-most sledge, which had carried the most weight, was well-worn, and they decided to abandon it. The remaining supplies were re-distributed between the remaining two sledges. Most of the important supplies‚Äîthe tent and most of the food‚Äîwere stored on the new rear sledge;Bickel (2000), p. 113. if they were to lose a sledge down a crevasse, they reasoned, it would be the front, less-vital sledge.Riffenburgh (2009), p. 115. As the rear sledge was heavier, the strongest of remaining dogs were assigned to pull it. At the camp they left a small amount of supplies, including the abandoned sledge and a tent cover, without the floor or poles.Hall and Scanlan (2000), p. 126. By noon the next day they had covered from the Cape Denison hut. Mertz was ahead on skis, breaking trail. Mawson sat on the first sledge; Ninnis walked beside the second. In his diary that night, Mertz recounted: \\"Around 1 pm, I crossed a crevasse, similar to the hundred previous ones we had passed during the last weeks. I cried out \\"crevasse!\\", moved at right angle, and went forward. Around five minutes later, I looked behind. Mawson was following, looking at his sledge in front of him. I couldn't see Ninnis, so I stopped to have a better look. Mawson turned round to know the reason I was looking behind me. He immediately jumped out of his sledge, and rushed back. When he nodded his head, I followed him, driving back his sledge.\\" Ninnis, his sledge and dog team had fallen through a crevasse wide with straight, ice walls.Mawson (1988), p. 148. On a ledge deep in the hole, Mawson and Mertz could see the bodies of two dogs‚Äîone still alive, but seriously injured‚Äîand the remains of Ninnis' sledge. There was no sign of their companion.Bickel (2000), p. 119. They measured the distance to the ledge as , too far for their ropes to reach.Ayres (1999), p. 73. \\"Dog ceased to moan shortly\\", wrote Mawson in his diary that night. \\"We called and sounded for three hours, then went a few miles to a hill and took position observations. Came back, called & sounded for an hour. Read the burial service.\\"  Return  Along with the heavy- weather tent, most of their own food and all of the dogs' food, they had lost the pickaxe, the shovel, and Mertz's waterproof overpants and helmet. On Mawson's sledge they had their stove, fuel, sleeping bags, and ten days' worth of food.Bickel (2000), p. 121. Their best immediate hope was to reach the camp of two days earlier where they had left the abandoned sledge and supplies, west. They reached it in five-and-a-half-hours, where Mertz used the tent cover, with the runners from the abandoned sledge and a ski as poles, to erect a shelter.Ayres (1999), p. 74. They were faced with two possible routes back to Cape Denison. The first option was to make for the coast, where they could supplement their meagre supplies with seal meat, and hope to meet with Madigan's party; that would considerably lengthen the journey, and the sea ice in summer could not be relied on. Or, pushing slightly to the south of their outward route, they could hope to avoid the worst of the crevasses and aim for speed.Ayres (1999), pp. 74‚Äì75. Mawson chose the inland route, which meant that in the absence of fresh seal meat they would have to resort to eating their remaining dogs.Ayres (1999), p. 75. The first dog‚ÄîGeorge‚Äîwas killed the following morning, and of his meat some was fried for the men and the rest fed to the now starving dogs. \\"On the whole it was voted good\\" wrote Mawson of the meat, \\"though it had a strong, musty taste and was so stringy that it could not be properly chewed\\".Riffenburgh (2009), p. 121. Mertz at Cape Denison Before setting off again they raised the flag‚Äîwhich they had forgotten to do at their furthest point‚Äîand claimed the land for the crown. With the temperature rising, they switched to travelling at night to take advantage of the harder surface the cold provided. With the five remaining dogs, Mawson and Mertz pushed on. Starving, the dogs began to struggle; two more‚ÄîJohnson and Mary‚Äîwere shot and divided between men and dogs over the following days.Riffenburgh (2009), p. 148. Mawson and Mertz found most of the meat tough, but enjoyed the liver; it, at least, was tender.Bickel (2000), p. 121. With the pulling power of the dogs now severely depleted, Mertz stopped making trail and instead helped Mawson to pull the sledge. Despite the challenges, they made good progress; in the first four nights they travelled .Bickel (2000), p. 147. As they approached the Ninnis Glacier on 21 December, Haldane‚Äîonce the largest and strongest of the dogs‚Äîwas shot.Mawson (1988), p. 152.Riffenburgh (2009), pp. 123‚Äì124. = Death of Mertz = Both men were suffering, but Mertz in particular started to feel ill. He complained of stomach pains, and this began to slow them down.Bickel (2000), p. 153. Pavlova was killed, leaving only one remaining dog. Mawson decided to lighten their sledge, and much of the equipment‚Äîincluding the camera, photographic films, and all of the scientific equipment save the theodolite‚Äîwas abandoned.Riffenburgh (2009), p. 125. On 29 December, the day they cleared the Ninnis Glacier, the last dog was killed. Mawson recorded: \\"Had a great breakfast off Ginger's skull‚Äîthyroids and brain\\".Mawson (1988), p. 155.Riffenburgh (2009), p. 127. Two days later Mawson recorded that Mertz was \\"off colour\\"; Mertz wrote that he was \\"really tired [and] shall write no more\\".Mawson (1988), p. 156. They made on 31 December, no progress for the following two days, and 5 miles more on 3 January. \\"[The] cold wind frost-bit Mertz's fingers\\" recorded Mawson, \\"and he is generally in a very bad condition. Skin coming off legs, etc‚Äîso had to camp though going was good.\\" Not until 6 January did they make any more progress; they went before Mertz collapsed.Ayres (1999), pp. 76‚Äì77. The following day Mawson placed Mertz onto the sledge in his sleeping bag and continued, but was forced to stop and camp when Mertz's condition again deteriorated. Mawson recorded: \\"He is very weak, becomes more and more delirious, rarely being able to speak coherently. He will eat or drink nothing. At 8 pm he raves & breaks a tent pole. Continues to rave & call 'Oh Veh, Oh Veh' [O weh!, 'Oh dear!'] for hours. I hold him down, then he becomes more peaceful & I put him quietly in the bag. He dies peacefully at about 2 am on morning of 8th.\\"Mawson (1988), p. 158.Ayres (1999), p. 77. Strong winds prevented Mawson from continuing for two days. Instead, he prepared for travelling alone, removing the rearmost half from the sledge, and rearranging its cargo. To save having to carry excess kerosene for the stove, he boiled the remainder of the dog meat. Dragging Mertz's body in the sleeping bag from the tent, Mawson constructed a rough cairn from snow blocks to cover it, and used two spare beams from the sledge to form a cross, which he placed on the top. The following day he read the burial service.Riffenburgh (2009), pp. 131‚Äì133. = Alone = Mawson's half sledge, which he used during the final stage of the journey As the weather cleared on 11 January, Mawson continued west, estimating the distance back to Cape Denison at .Ayres (1999), p. 79. He travelled before pain in his feet forced him to stop; he found that the soles of his feet had separated as a complete layer. Applying lanolin to his feet and wrapping them in several pairs of socks under his boots, he continued.Riffenburgh (2009), p. 135. \\"My whole body is apparently rotting from lack of nourishment\\" he recorded, \\"frost-bitten fingertips festering, mucous membrane of nose gone, saliva glands of mouth refusing duty, skin coming off whole body\\".Mawson (1988), p. 159. Averaging around a day, he began to cross the Mertz Glacier. On 17 January, he broke through the lid of a crevasse, but the rope around his waist held him to the sledge and halted his fall.Bickel (2000), pp. 198‚Äì199. \\"I had time to say to myself \\"So this is the end\\" [Mawson recorded], expecting every moment the sledge to crash on my head and both of us to go to the bottom unseen below. Then I thought of the food left uneaten in the sledge‚Äîand, as the sledge stopped without coming down, I thought of Providence again giving me a chance. The chance looked very small as the rope had sawed into the overhanging lid, my finger ends all damaged, myself weak ... With the feeling that Providence was helping me I made a great struggle, half getting out, then slipping back again several times, but at last just did it. Then I felt grateful to Providence ... who has so many times already helped me.\\"Mawson (1988), pp. 161‚Äì162.Ayres (1999), pp. 79‚Äì80. To save himself from future crevasses, Mawson constructed a rope ladder, which he carried over his shoulder and was attached to the sledge. It paid off almost immediately, and twice in the following days it allowed him to climb from crevasses.Riffenburgh (2009), p. 139. Once out of the Mertz Glacier his mileage increased, and on 28 January, Madigan Nunatak came into view. The following day, after travelling , a cairn covered with black cloth appeared about to his right. In it he found food and a note from Archibald Lang McLean, who along with Frank Hurley and Alfred Hodgeman had been sent out by Auroras captain, John King Davis, to search for the Far Eastern Party.Ayres (1999), p. 81.Bickel (2000), p. 215. From the note, Mawson learned he was south-east of Aladdin's Cave, and near two further food depots. The note also reported on the other parties of the expedition‚Äîall had returned to the hut safely‚Äîand on Roald Amundsen's attainment of the South Pole in December 1911. The cairn had been left there just six hours before, when the three men had returned to the hut.Riffenburgh (2009), p. 142. Struggling on his injured feet and lacking crampons‚Äîhe had thrown his away after he crossed the Mertz Glacier‚ÄîMawson took three days to reach Aladdin's Cave.Riffenburgh (2009), p. 143. Although supplies had been left in Aladdin's Cave‚Äîincluding fresh fruit‚Äîthere were not the spare crampons he had expected. Without them he could not hope to descend the steep ice slope to the hut, and so he began to fashion his own, collecting nails from every available source and hammering them into wood from spare packing cases.Bickel (2000), pp. 229‚Äì230.Riffenburgh (2009), p. 144. Even when completed, a blizzard confined him to the cave, and only on 8 February was he able to begin the descent. Nearing the hut, he was spotted by three men working outside, who rushed up the hill to meet him.Ayres (1999), p. 82.  Aftermath  Mawson shortly after his return to Cape Denison The Aurora arrived at Cape Denison on 13 January 1913. When Mawson's party failed to return, Davis sailed her east along the coast as far as the Mertz Glacier tongue, searching for the party. Finding no sign and reaching the end of the navigable ice-free water, they returned to Cape Denison. The oncoming winter concerned Davis, and on 8 February‚Äîjust hours before Mawson's return to the hut‚Äîthe ship departed Commonwealth Bay, leaving six men behind as a relief party. Upon Mawson's return, the Aurora was recalled by wireless radio, but powerful katabatic winds sweeping down from the plateau prevented the ship's boat from reaching the shore to collect the men.Ayres (1999), pp. 86‚Äì87. The Aurora returned to Cape Denison the following summer, in mid-December, to take the men home.Bickel (2000), p. 257. The delay may have saved Mawson's life; he later told Phillip Law, then-director of Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions, that he did not believe he could have survived the sea journey so soon after his ordeal.Riffenburgh (2009), p. 154. The cause of Mawson and Mertz's illnesses remains in part a mystery. At the time, McLean‚Äîthe expedition's chief surgeon and one of the men who had remained at Cape Denison‚Äîattributed their sickness to colitis; Mawson wrote in The Home of the Blizzard, his official account of the expedition, that Mertz died of fever and appendicitis.Bickel (2000), p. 259.Riffenburgh (2009), p. 136. A 1969 study by Sir John Cleland and R. V. Southcott of the University of Adelaide concluded that the symptoms Mawson described‚Äîhair, skin and weight loss, depression, dysentery and persistent skin infections‚Äîindicated the men had suffered hypervitaminosis A, an excessive intake of vitamin A. This is found in unusually high quantities in the livers of Greenland Huskies, of which both Mertz and Mawson consumed large amounts. While hypervitaminosis A is the generally accepted medical diagnosis for Mertz's death and Mawson's illness, the theory has its detractors.Riffenburgh (2009), p. 137. Law believed it was \\"completely unproven ... The symptoms that were described are exactly the ones you get from cold exposure. You don't have to predicate a theory of this sort to explain the soles coming off your feet.\\"Ayres (1999), pp. 80‚Äì81. A 2005 article in The Medical Journal of Australia by Denise Carrington-Smith suggested it may have been \\"the psychological stresses related to the death of a close friend and the deaths of the dogs he had cared for\\", and a switch from a predominately vegetarian diet that killed Mertz, not hypervitaminosis A.Carrington-Smith (2005), p. 641. Memorial cross erected at Cape Denison Suggestions of cannibalism‚Äîthat Mawson may have eaten Mertz after his death‚Äîsurfaced during Mawson's lecture tour of the United States following the expedition. Several reports in American newspapers quoted Mawson as saying he considered eating Mertz, but these claims were denied by Mawson, who labelled them \\"outrageous\\" and an \\"invention\\".Riffenburgh (2009), pp. 131‚Äì132. Mawson's biographers believe the suggestion of cannibalism is probably wrong; Beau Riffenburgh notes that Mawson nursed Mertz for days, even at the possible risk to his own life. Moreover, he notes, Mawson had no way of knowing why Mertz died; eating his flesh could possibly have been very dangerous.Riffenburgh (2009), pp. 132‚Äì133. These sentiments are echoed by Philip Ayres, who also notes that with Mertz's death Mawson had sufficient rations without having to resort to cannibalism.Ayres (1999), pp. 78‚Äì79. Law, who knew Mawson well, believed \\"He was a man of very solid, conservative morals. It would have been impossible for him to have considered it.\\"Ayres (1999), p. 78. In November 1913, shortly before the Aurora arrived to return them to Australia, the men remaining at Cape Denison erected a memorial cross for Mertz and Ninnis on Azimuth Hill to the north-west of the main hut. The cross, constructed from pieces of a broken radio mast, was accompanied by a plaque cut from wood from Mertz's bunk.Bickel (2000), p. 254. The cross still stands, although the crossbar has required reattaching several times, and the plaque was replaced with a replica in 1986. The two glaciers the Far Eastern Party crossed‚Äîpreviously unnamed‚Äîwere named by Mawson for Mertz and Ninnis. At a celebration in the centre of Adelaide on his return from Antarctica, Mawson praised his dead companions: \\"The survivors might have an opportunity of doing something more, but these men had done their all\\". Mawson's return was celebrated at the Adelaide Town Hall, in an event attended by the governor- general, Lord Denman. A typical speaker stated that \\"Mawson has returned from a journey that was absolutely unparalleled in the history of exploration‚Äîone of the greatest illustrations of how the sternest affairs of Nature were overcome by the superb courage, power and resolve of man\\".Riffenburgh (2009), pp. 177‚Äì178. Including the Far Eastern Party, sledging parties from the Cape Denison base covered over of previously unexplored land; the expedition's Western Base Party on the Shackleton Ice Shelf, under Frank Wild, covered a further .Ayres (1999), pp. 95‚Äì96. The expedition was the first to use wireless radio in the Antarctic‚Äîtransmitting back to Australia via a relay station established on Macquarie Island‚Äîand made several important scientific discoveries. First published in 1915, Mawson's account of the expedition, The Home of the Blizzard, devotes two chapters to the Far Eastern Party;Mawson (1915), pp. 214‚Äì273. one contemporary reviewer commented that \\"undoubtedly to the general public the interest of the book centres in [this] moving account\\".Mill (1915), p. 424. A later analysis by J. Gordon Hayes, while commending most of the expedition, was critical of Mawson's decision not to use skis, but Fred Jacka, writing in the Australian Dictionary of Biography, suggests that \\"for Mawson and Ninnis, who were manoeuvring heavy sledges, this would have been difficult much of the time\\". In his 1976 foreword to Lennard Bickel's book on the Australasian Antarctic Expedition, explorer and mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary described Mawson's journey as \\"probably the greatest story of lone survival in Polar exploration\\".

It is a federally listed threatened species.USFWS. Threatened status of Hexastylis naniflora (dwarf-flowered heartleaf). Federal Register April 14, 1989. This is a rhizomatous perennial herb forming a small patch on the ground, the leaves emerging from the underground rhizome. The evergreen leaves have leathery heart-shaped blades. The plant produces one new leaf per year.Hexastylis naniflora. Center for Plant Conservation. The fleshy brown flowers are jug- shaped and may remain buried in the leaf litter.Hexastylis naniflora. The Nature Conservancy. This plant occurs in oak-hickory-pine plant communities. It typically grows on slopes near streams in moist, acidic soils. It is associated with Kalmia latifolia (mountain-laurel) and can often be found growing beneath it.Hexastylis naniflora. Flora of North America. It is associated with several species of oak, particularly Quercus coccinea (scarlet oak), Quercus montana (chestnut oak), and Quercus velutina (black oak). The plant is known from eleven counties in southern North Carolina and northern South Carolina. In 2004 there were about 150 populations known, but many of these are very small. The main threat to the species is the loss and degradation of its habitat. Much of the plant's historical habitat has been converted to agriculture, particularly peach orchards, and developed into residential areas. Remaining populations can be found on land which is threatened by cattle grazing, agriculture, expanding residential and commercial areas, timber harvesting, and construction of ponds and lakes.

Nimbus is a 2-inch tall Littling tween who fell to Earth when she was just a baby. She has long, brown hair and purple eyes. She wears a semi-transparent, starry hairband and clothing resembling rose pedals. Nimbus has fairy-like pointy ears and is often barefooted.  Character  Nimbus has no recollection of her past, and is therefore driven by a world of unknowns. She is on a journey of self- discovery, and has felt isolated at times, as she believed she was the only one of her kind for most of her life.  Special abilities  As with all Littlings, Nimbus has a special gift. She has the ability to create puffy, white clouds just by exhaling. It is important to note that there have been instances where sneezing has resulted in the formation of clouds as well. It is also important to note that Nimbus was not born with this ability. It remains a mystery why such an ability remained dormant until her tween years. Nimbus uses her clouds as a method of transportation. Riding them like a surf board, she is capable of attaining high speeds, which is especially useful in helping those in urgent need.  History  In May 2005, author and creator, Frankie Santelli (May 13, 1978), born Franco Louis Santelli, began drawing early sketches of Nimbus Littling. His vision was to create a character whom all children could relate to in one form or another. Nimbus was first conceptualized as a Littling male, and his original name was Cloud Littling. Santelli felt the name was too obvious, and later changed the name to a specific type of cloud, Nimbus. Frankie then changed his protagonist's gender to female in 2009 once he learned his wife, Angeliki Psaradellis, was pregnant with their first daughter, whom they named Evelina Francesca Santelli, after Frankie's mother. Santelli's vision to create epic stories based on tiny little creatures was an effort to teach children that ‚Äúno matter how little you are, there is nothing you cannot do‚Ä¶no challenge is too big.‚Äù Santelli's favorite children's book author is Theodor Seuss Geisel, aka Dr. Seuss. The Littling stories began as simple one-page poems. Santelli never felt the format did his stories justice. In June 2009, he began to research other forms of media to fully embrace the Littling experience. Using 3D software, Santelli brought Nimbus to life in vivd CGI and used his own macro photography as his illustration's backgrounds and settings. The experience was somewhat improved, but still not immersive enough. Santelli later decided to give Nimbus a voice, a soundtrack and animation in the form of children's ebooks. As Santelli continued to write, Nimbus Littling's lore continued to develop. As of 2011, Nimbus has appeared in 10 stories so far, and eight additional stories are in production. In March 2011, Santelli egg was quoted saying, ‚ÄúA Littling story is not about a lesson to tell, but an adventure to embark upon.‚Äù Santelli made it a point to never flesh out a story beforehand, but rather, follow the story to wherever it brings him. He believes a good story ‚Äúfolds in on itself.‚Äù Hidden deep within his 10th book, there are several lessons including social acceptance, the importance of friendship and cooperation, as well as the repercussions of over-consumption and greed.

Frankie and Audrey worked as project managers at a video game QA firm in 2009. Frankie has been quoted saying, ‚ÄúThe moment I heard her voice, I knew I had found my Nimbus.‚Äù Ensign Oppy Abol is voiced by Frankie's younger sister, Debora Santelli. Captain Oprom Abol is voiced by Frankie's wife, Angeliki Psaradellis.  Interesting banter  It has been said that the Nebtunian creatures are somewhat frightening in appearance. This was later revealed to have been done on purpose to reiterate the lesson of social acceptance despite one's external characteristics. Some readers have commented that some of the language used in the Littlings series is advanced, being described as appropriate for children over 8 years of age. This too was later revealed to have been done intentionally to follow Santelli's belief that ‚Äúchildren will challenge themselves to learn if they are passionate about the subject. It‚Äôs human nature.‚Äù Nimbus Littling's orphaned friend Annie has been compared to the original protagonist in the classic Broadway musical of the same name.  Books and plots  Nimbus Littling has appeared in the following stories: * Nimbus Littling & the Land of the Giants ‚Äì In her first book, we are introduced to a young orphan named Annie Swanson. While out playing in the yard during a cold November day, Annie finds a little creature trembling due to the extremely cold weather. Annie quickly brings the Littling inside and sits by the fire to warm her up. Years pass, and Annie has taught Nimbus how to walk, talk and bake bread. They become inseparable friends. Nimbus soon begins to question her youth and her past more and more. She becomes increasingly curious to know if there are more of her kind that exist. Annie unfortunately has no answers for Nimbus, but is confident that she is not the only Littling out there. One day, Nimbus decides to leave the comforts of Annie Swanson's bedroom to take off on an adventure to discover her past. * Nimbus Littling & the Puffy White Cloud ‚Äì Nimbus accidentally discovers her incredible ability and a world of adventure ensues. * Nimbus Littling & the Marbled Glass Stairwell ‚Äì In this exciting tale, Nimbus captures the first glimpse of another Littling. * Nimbus Littling & the Realm of Slumber ‚Äì Nimbus Littling meets Imber and Somnium Littling. Sleepers attack and Nimbus falls into the Realm of Slumber, unable to awaken without her friends‚Äô help. * Nimbus Littling & the Vorythan Legend ‚Äì Nimbus Littling comes across a little Littling village where he witnesses a beautiful play about Troy and Vale Littling. * Nimbus Littling & the Cave of Masks ‚Äì Nimbus finds a mysterious treasure map and discovers the Cave of Masks as well as three other Littlings. * Nimbus Littling & the Giant Pink Flood ‚Äì Nimbus returns to the orphanage where she first fell to Earth only to find Annie's bedroom empty, except for a new Littling who has taken Nimbus‚Äô spot under Annie's pink bed. * Nimbus Littling & the Lair of Lying Robots ‚Äì A knock at Nimbus‚Äô door reveals a little Robot who pleads for Nimbus‚Äô help in saving his robot family from the evil scientist named Dr. Darts. * Nimbus Littling & the Great Gynormous Growth Machine ‚Äì Texo Littling builds a machine capable of growing Littlings to human size. * Nimbus Littling & the Flu From Nebtune 2 ‚Äì Nimbus helps two Nebtunian creatures repair their space vessel and return home with ingredients to help save their planet from destruction. Nimbus Littling will soon be appearing in 8 other storybook adventures and ebooks: * Nimbus Littling & the Wittling Castle * Nimbus Littling & the Jungle of Jumbles * Nimbus Littling & the Hall of Music * Nimbus Littling & the Garden of Gifts * Nimbus Littling & the Door to Krondor * Nimbus Littling & the Peanut Butter Secret * Nimbus Littling & the Tower of Time * Nimbus Littling & the Mirror of ? The title of book 17 remains a secret. Santelli will be accepting plot submissions from Littlings fans to thank them for their enormous contribution to the franchise. Despite ‚ÄúNimbus Littling & the Flu from Nebtune 2‚Äù being the 10th book in the series, Santelli decided to release it as the first ebook because he believes ‚ÄúNimbus Littling‚Äôs adventures are timeless, and each adventures stands on its own.‚Äù He believes ‚Äúchildren will enjoy discovering Nimbus Littling‚Äôs past at their own pace, and in their own way.‚Äù  Backstory  Although it is never explicitly revealed in Nimbus‚Äô stories, she was born in Stratus City, above Earth, high among the clouds. After the Sleepers learn of her current whereabouts, they quickly descend to Earth to capture Nimbus inside their Realm of Slumber. Sleepers were, at one time, Littlings as well, but they were stricken of their powers after the Littling Gods in Haven witnessed their hearts turn evil. Ashamed, the Gods cloaked the Sleepers in dark gowns, hiding their faces in embarrassment, in an attempt to teach them that good always prevails. Sleepers retain only one ability ‚Äì to capture others and confine them to the Realm of Slumber. The Sleepers hunt Nimbus Littling because they believe that she holds the key to restoring their powers.  About the author  Frankie Santelli is the father of Evelina Francesca Santelli. She continues to provide the inspiration behind all of his Littling adventures. Santelli is a firm believer in interactive edutainment. He is devoted to providing children with more ‚Äúimmersive, engaging experiences that bounce off the page‚Äù. Santelli is an avid storyteller, CGI illustrator, and photographer. He is a Concordia University Marketing graduate and currently works in SEO web development. Santelli's first creative bout was a boardgame he invented in 2001 called ‚ÄúMarianopoly‚Äù ‚Äì a Monopoly-inspired boardgame based on the various locations of the college he attended, Marianopolis. Six other boardgames, countless comic strips, and one sci-fi novel soon followed. Santelli is a trekker. He is fond of Star Trek's ideal view of the future. He believes that it is through education and opportunity that future generation thrive.  Littling facts  * All Littlings are left- handed * Although not a word, gynormous is often used to describe something big throughout the Littling series * All Littlings love the rain * Believing in Littlings allows them to be seen * All Littling stories rhyme * Nimbus loves peanut butter and chocolate milk * Nimbus birthday is the 13th of May * Nimbus' astrological sign is Taurus  Artwork  Littling Ebook illustrations undergo a progressive blurring process to mimic the look of macro photography. As Littlings are only about 2 inches tall, their photos would typically contain contour warping and a softened lens effect around the edges.  Music  Music as well as sound effects play an important role in any Littling adventure. Nimbus' ebooks contain big band soundtracks similar to epic Hollywood films including The Shawshank Redemption, Braveheart, and Star Wars.  Nimbus' favorite things  Food: * Peanut Butter * Sweet Apple Pie * Chocolate Milk Hobbies & interests: * Making clouds * Adventuring * Helping those in need  About the Littlings  There are Littlings among us.

Biography Nicholas Holloway was born in Isleworth, London. He began playing records in the disco pub scene around the Old Kent Road in 1980. He first started to organise club nights, such as Special Branch in London Bridge in 1984 alongside Pete Tong and Gilles Peterson. Holloway (with Paul Oakenfold, Johnny Walker and Danny Rampling) was one of the \\"Ibiza four\\" - four DJs who travelled to the island for a holiday in the summer of 1987. They visited a club called Amnesia and met an Argentine DJ called Alfredo Fiorito, who inspired them to promote Balearic beats back in the UK. Holloway opened the clubnight Trip at the London Astoria in Charing Cross Road at the end of May 1988, and was one of the first legal acid house clubs. Trip changed its name to Sin, after the previous name's close association with drug culture. In April 1990, he opened the Milk Bar venue at 12 Sutton Row, London, W1.New Musical Express, 1988 It hosted Paul Oakenfold on Friday nights and Pete Tong and Dave Dorrell on Saturday nights, Darren Emerson on Mondays, Danny Rampling's Pure Sexy and Glam on Wednesday Brandon Block and Lisa Loud playing FUBAR on the Sunday night. Dave Morales, Tony Humphries, the Brand New Heavies and Jamiroquai got signed after doing spots at the club. During the summer of 1992 he opened venues in Ibiza under the Milk Bar banner which ran for a couple of seasons, but later went bankrupt and had to attend rehabilitation. Pete Tong, Paul Oakenfold, Lynn Cosgrove and Lincoln Cheng a club owner of Zouk (club) in Singapore all chipped in to get him into the Charter Nightingale rehab clinic and for seven years he remained sober. Since cleaning his life up in 1998 Nicky has continued to produce music and is widely known as one of the first DJs in the UK to go digital, many of his Peers mocked him for this, however they soon realised the benefits outweighed the downside and within a few years where doing the same. Maverick producer Arthur Baker walked into his own club one night, The Elbow Room in Islington and was blown away by what he Nicky doing using a piece of software called PCDJ at that time laptop hard drives where too small so he had to carry around a full desktop PC. In 1999 Nicky helped create a DJ based website called Trust The DJ with his close friend Lynn Cosgrove, which was so ahead of its time it ran out of funding before most people had broadband. Lynn Cosgrove still manages DJ Carl Cox. In 2008 Nicky started to run classic house club nights under the name of Desert Island Disco however after a few good years decided to stop doing the events as the format was being copied by many other promoters and he simply got bored. After a few years living in a pub called the Queens Head in Brixton Nicky is now currently living in Barnet north London and now organizing parties called Now & Then where the format is new and old music and still plays regularly for such events as Promised Land & Summer Solstice and was recently included in a list of 50 DJs over 50 still cutting it.

It was established in a wake of criticism over the failure of the previous regulatory regime to halt the failure of a large number of finance companies and to stem investor losses in the period between 2006 and 2010.

Popeye (1963 ‚Äì November 27, 1997) was a Mexican high-ranking member of the Logan Heights Gang, the Mexican Mafia and a hitman for the Tijuana Cartel under the command of drug lord Ramon Arellano Felix. Barron recruited and led a band of Mexican-American Logan Heights gang members as hired enforcers for the Arellano-Felix organization.  Background  David \\"Popeye\\" Barron Corona was a member of the Barrio Logan Heights gang and later the Mexican Mafia (La Eme) prison gang who committed his first murder at the age of 16. Convicted of murder, Barron Corona was sent to prison. In 1989, he got out of prison and soon thereafter began working as a bodyguard and hitman for the Arellano-Felix brothers of the Tijuana Cartel (AFO). While in Mexico, he was trained in paramilitary tactics by the Tijuana Cartel, which included heavy weapons training. This training helped to make Barron Corona highly proficient in the crimes of kidnapping and murder. Barron successfully recruited dozens of San Diego gang members to cross the border to work for him and the AFO as kidnappers and hitmen. Barron Corona was personally recruited when the Tijuana Cartel were waging a war with their hated rivals, the Sinaloa Cartel, led by Joaquin \\"Chapo\\" Guzman. The beef stemmed from who would control the drug smuggling routes from Tijuana to the border city of San Diego, California. On November 8, 1992 the rival Sinaloa Cartel struck out against the Tijuana Cartel at the discotec \\"Christine\\" in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, Mexico. Eight Tijuana Cartel members were killed in the shootout but the Arellano-F√©lix brothers successfully escaped from the location with the assistance of Barron. In retaliation, the Tijuana Cartel with the assistance of Barron Corona attempted to set up Guzm√°n at a Guadalajara airport on May 24, 1993. In the shootout that followed, six civilians were killed by the hired gunmen from the Logan Heights Gang. The deaths included that of Roman Catholic Cardinal Juan Jes√∫s Posadas Ocampo. The church hierarchy originally believed Ocampo was targeted as revenge for his strong stance against the drug trade. Mexican officials, however believe Ocampo just happened to be a victim of mistaken identity. The Cardinal arrived at the airport in a white Mercury Grand Marquis town car, known to be popular amongst drug barons, making it a possible target. Intelligence received by Barron was that Guzm√°n would be arriving in a white Mercury Grand Marquis town car. This explanation, however, is often met with skepticism due to Ocampo's dress (he was wearing a long black cassock and large pectoral cross), as well as his dissimilar appearance to Guzm√°n and the fact he was gunned down from only two feet away. Barron Corona was killed on November 27, 1997 in Tijuana, Baja California during the attempted assassination of journalist Jesus Blancornelas.http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2006/11/24/index.php? It is believed a bullet fired by one of his own henchmen ricocheted into Barron Corona's eye, killing him instantly.http://cpj.org/2008/01/mexican-drug-cartel-gunman- arrested-for-attempted.php References 1963 births 1997 deaths Deaths by firearm in Mexico Gang members Tijuana Cartel traffickers ","title":"David Barron Corona"},{"id":"31512305","text":"Elizabeth Adams may refer to: * A.

Mineralization of the iliac apophyses begins at the anterolateral crest and progresses medially towards the spine. Fusion of the calcified apophyses to the ilium then progresses in opposite direction, from medial-to-lateral. A typical five-point grading scale is as follows: * Grade 1 is given when the ilium (bone) is calcified at a level of 25%; it corresponds to prepuberty or early puberty. * Grade 2 is given when the ilium (bone) is calcified at a level of 50%; it corresponds to the stage before or during growth spurt. * Grade 3 is given when the ilium (bone) is calcified at a level of 75%; it corresponds to the slowing of growth. * Grade 4 is given when the ilium (bone) is calcified at a level of 100%; it corresponds to an almost cessation of growth. * Grade 5 is given when the ilium (bone) is calcified at a level of 100% and the iliac apophysis is fused to iliac crest; it corresponds to the end of growth. Risser grading is traditionally used to estimating the future growth potential of the adolescent spine, particularly in the setting of spinal scoliosis. Risser originally recognized that ossification of the iliac apophyses approximately parallels the ossification of the vertebral apophyses. The earlier the stage of growth, the greater the likelihood of a scoliosis progressing and potentially needing intervention.http://www.aafp.org/afp/2002/0501/p1817.html Note that although Risser first described his findings during a 1948 lectureRisser JC. Important practical facts in the treatment of scoliosis. Instr Course Lect 1948;V:248-260. and published the eponymous paper in 1958, formalized staging systems were developed at a later time.  Controversy  The Risser grading system has been criticized as being an inaccurate proxy for skeletal maturity. Comparison of predicted future growth and progression of scoliosis to actual measured changes show that the Risser system is variably accurate. Specifically, because the progression from stages 1 to 4 (apophyseal \\"excursion\\") is rapid and only takes an average of approximately 1 year, these stages are of limited value in pinpointing stage of growth. Cessation of trunk growth as predicted by Risser stage is also earlier than actual growth. In 2008, Sanders et al proposed an alternative system for assessing skeletal maturity, using hand x-rays in a manner similar to \\"gold standards\\" (Greulich and Pyle, Tanner-Whitehouse-III) skeletal maturity assessments. Whether the use of the Sanders vs Risser staging for management of scoliosis would lead to different treatment decisions is being debated.

He was born and died in Paris. Lagache became was one of the leading figures in twentieth century French psychoanalysis. Career Daniel Lagache began higher education at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure (ENS) in 1924. Becoming interested in psychopathology under the influence of Georges Dumas, he began to study medicine ‚Äî alongside such figures as Raymond Aron, Paul Nizan, and Jean-Paul Sartre ‚Äî as well as psychiatry. By 1937 he had become chief physician in the clinic directed by Henri Claude. Appointed lecturer in psychology at the University of Strasbourg in 1937, he succeeded to the chair of psychology at the Sorbonne in 1947, before obtaining the chair of psychopathology in 1955. After a training analysis with Rudolph Loewenstein in the thirties, Lagache focused his research interests on Freudian psychoanalysis, bolstered by his knowledge of German; and in 1937 his article on \\"Mourning, melancholia and mania\\" enabled him to become a full member of the SPP'Rosenblum ‚Äî the Paris psychoanalytical society. =Psychoanalytic politics= After the war, Lagache's views on training came into increasing conflict with those of the society's establishment, as he sought in a liberal synthesis of psychology and psychoanalysis leverage against the medical authoritarianism upheld by Sacha Nacht.√âlisabeth Roudinesco, Jacques Lacan (Oxford 1997) p. 196 and p. 201 In 1953, Lagache led a break-away from the central body of French psychoanalysis, to form the new Societe Francaise de Psychanalyse (French Society for Psychoanalysis, or SFP),Michael Radich, Being Irrational (2004) p. 32 accompanied by such leading figures as Francoise Dolto and Jacques Lacan.L. D. Kirtzam et al., The Columbia History of Twentieth-Century French Thought (2007) p. 507 Despite earlier disputes, Lacan and Lagache thereafter worked together side by side in the new Society during the fifties, Lagache predominantly as supervisor, Lacan as training analyst. Lacan's fulsome tribute in Ecrits belongs to this era: ‚ÄúIt is to the work of my colleague Daniel Lagache that we must turn for a true account of the work which...has been devoted to the transference...introducing into the function of the phenomenon structural distinctions that are essential for its critique...between the need for repetition and the repetition of need‚Äù.Jacques Lacan, Ecrits: A Selection (London 1997) p. 241 In a more critical vein, Lacan also took up Lagache's work on the ego ideal,√âlisabeth Roudinesco, Jacques Lacan (Oxford 1997) p. 284 as a springboard for his own article \\"Remarque sur le rapport de Daniel Lagache\\" on the distinction of the ideal ego and the ego ideal'.Jacques Lacan, The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis (Penguin 1994) p. 144 The major problem that had however faced the new Society from the start was that of obtaining recognition from the International Psychoanalytical Association; and here Lacan increasingly appeared as the main obstacle to success. Although both men had been analysed by Loewenstein, Lacan unlike Lagache had reacted violently against his ego psychology, and by 1961 he was publicly attacking Lagache for \\"personalism\\" due to the latter's mix of psychology and psychoanalysis.Jean-Michel Rabate, The Cambridge Companion to Lacan (2003) p. 134 and p. 13 The result was that for the IPA - in Andr√© Green's view - the problem became ‚Äúhow to accept Lagache, while leaving Lacan out‚Äù.Quoted in Gregorio Kohon, The Dead Mother (1993) p. 21 The conflict was only resolved in 1964 with the dissolution of the SFP, and the division of its assets and membership between two new organizations. Lagache became the first president of the new Association Psychanalytique de France (APF), an institution that was swiftly recognized by the IPA in 1965.Rosenblum Writings In his teaching, Lagache addresses various areas of psychology, seeking constantly to draw them into a conscious synthesis, in the spirit of his remarkable inaugural lecture on \\"The Unity of Psychology: experimental psychology and clinical psychology\\"(1949). But his work is essentially psychopathological, though also inspired by phenomenology. His little book The Psychoanalysis (1955) was called by Didier Anzieu \\"a model in terms of accuracy and an example of openness to diversity of fields of application\\". Numerous other articles and communications testify to his clinical experience and his extensive research in psychoanalysis. Founder and director of a series called \\"Library of Psychoanalysis and Clinical Psychology\\", Daniel Lagache was also the project leader of the Dictionary of Psychoanalysis (1967), written under his direction by Jean Laplanche and Jean-Bertrand Pontalis. He sought to introduce Freudian concepts into social psychology (for which he established a laboratory at the Sorbonne); and in Criminology, he devoted several studies to criminogenesis. Three central areas of investigation can perhaps be singled out in his work ‚Äì on mourning, the transference, and jealousy . *A pioneer in re-opening the study of mourning prewar,Jean Laplanche, Essays on Otherness (1999) p. 254 Lagache considered the ritual aspects of mourning as establishing the necessary distance between the living and dead.M. Nixon/L.

Nixon/L. Bourgeois, Fantastic Reality (2005) p. 160-1 *Using ideas from Structuralism and Gestalt psychology, Lagache in his 1951-2 'Report on Transference' stressed its pervasiveness.Jean Laplanche, Essays on Otherness (1999) p. 225 and the need to complete the unfinished business of the mind expressed in it ‚Äì supporting Freud's earlier view of transference as the repetition of need, as opposed to his later emphasis on the death drive.R. Horatio Etchegoyen, The Fundamentals of Psychoanalytic Technique (London 2005) p. 94 and 116 *On jealousy Lagache singled out the desire 'to possess the object totally and exclusively; the \\"loved object is seen as a thing, not as an independent consciousness: the possessive lover refuses to acknowledge the alterity of the Other\\"'.Elizabeth Fallaize, Simone de Beauvoir (1998) p. 178 Criticism Critics like √âlisabeth Roudinesco would argue that Lagache's attempt at the \\"integration of Freudianism into Janetism\\",√âlisabeth Roudinesco, Jacques Lacan & Co (London 1990) p. 219 through his emphasis on clinical psychology, was a dead end. Certainly his rival Lacan maintained that \\"that extraordinary lateral transference, by which the categories of a psychology that re- invigorates its menial tasks with social exploitation acquire a new strength in psychoanalysis\\", was foredoomed: \\"I regard the fate of psychology as signed and sealed\\".Lacan, Ecrits p. 297 Roudinesco concluded that Lagache lost his battle for unification at the same time that he won fame through it.√âlisabeth Roudinesco, Jacques Lacan & Co (London 1990) p. 221 See also References Further reading * Daniel Lagache, The Works of Daniel Lagache: Selected Papers, 1938-1964 (1993) * Alain de Mijolla, Freud and France, 1885-1945 (2010) External links * Regine Prat, \\"La Jalousie Amoureuse\\" (English) French psychologists French psychoanalysts 1972 deaths 1903 births 20th-century psychologists ","title":"Daniel Lagache"},{"id":"31512435","text":"Jimmy Christopher Banks Jr. (born August 24, 1989), known as J.

It is the oldest institution of higher learning in the state of New York, and the fifth oldest in the United States. Founding of King's College The period leading up to the school's founding was marked by controversy, with various groups competing to determine its location and religious affiliation. Advocates of New York City met with success on the first point, while the Church of England prevailed on the latter. However, all constituencies agreed to commit themselves to principles of religious liberty in establishing the policies of the College. Samuel Johnson, first president of King's College Although the City of New York had come under the control of the English in 1674, no serious discussions as to the founding of a university began until the early eighteenth-century. This delay is often attributed to the multitude of languages and religions practiced in the province, which made the founding of a seat of learning difficult. Colleges during the colonial period were regarded as a religious, no less a scientific and literary institution. The large gap between the founding of New York province and the opening of its first college stands in contrast to institutions such as Harvard University, which was created only six years after the founding of Boston, Massachusetts, a colony with a more homogenous Puritan population. Discussions regarding the founding of a college in the Province of New York began as early as 1704, when Colonel Lewis Morris wrote to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, the missionary arm of the Church of England, persuading the society that New York City was an ideal community in which to establish a college. The lands on which Morris had initially designed the college to be built, known as \\"King's Farm, were vested to Trinity Church by Lord Cornburry, and nothing came of the proposition to form a college in the provence until almost fifty years later. The founding of Harvard in 1636 and Yale in 1701 had set no competitive juices flowing among New York's merchants. But the announcement in the summer of 1745 that New Jersey, which had only seven years before secured a government separate from New York's and was still considered by New Yorkers to be within its cultural catch basin, was about to found the College of New Jersey, now Princeton University, demanded an immediate response. In 1746 an act was passed by the general assembly of New York to raise a sum of ¬£2,250 by public lottery for the foundation of a new college, despite the fact that the University had neither a founding denomination nor a location for its first campus. In 1751, the assembly appointed a commission of ten New York residents, seven of whom were Church of England members, to direct the funds accrued by the state lottery towards the foundation of a college. Funds were also provided by many of the wealthiest individuals of the period, including numerous slave owners and slave traders. In March of the following year, the vestrymen of Trinity Church offered the commission the six-northernmost acres of its property for the foundation of the college, which settled the problem of the college's first campus; however, considerable outcry from William Livingston and other members of the commission who believed that the college should be nonsectarian caused further delay in the college's founding. Despite Livingston's objections, the commission voted to accept the lands from Trinity Church on the condition that the college's affiliation be Church of England. The commission chose as the college's first president Dr. Samuel Johnson, a preeminent scholar who had received his doctorate from The University of Oxford, and had been sought in similar capacity to preside over the College of Philadelphia, now The University of Pennsylvania. King's College (1754‚Äì1784) King's College Hall, 1770 :Includes the administrations of Samuel Johnson (1754‚Äì1763) and Myles Cooper (1763‚Äì1785) Classes were initially held in July 1754, the delay stemming from the inability of the college to secure adequate faculty. Dr. Johnson was the only instructor of the college's first class, which consisted of a mere eight students. Instruction was held in a new schoolhouse adjoining Trinity Church, located on what is now lower Broadway in Manhattan. The college was officially founded on October 31, 1754, as King's College by royal charter of King George II, making it the oldest institution of higher learning in the state of New York and the fifth oldest in the United States. On June 3 of the following year, the Governors of the College adopted a design prepared by Dr. Johnson for the seal of King's College, which continues to be that of Columbia College with the alteration in name. In 1760, King's College moved to its own building at Park Place, near the present City Hall, and in 1767 it established the first American medical school to grant the M.D. degree. Controversy surrounded the founding of the new college in New York, as it was a thoroughly Church of England institution dominated by the influence of Crown officials in its governing body, such as the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Fears of the establishment of a Church of England episcopacy and of Crown influence in America through King's College were underpinned by its vast wealth, far surpassing all other colonial colleges of the period. Alexander Hamilton was an early alumnus of King's College. In 1763, Dr. Johnson was succeeded in the presidency by Myles Cooper, a graduate of The Queen's College, Oxford, and an ardent Tory. In the political controversies which preceded The American Revolution, his chief opponent in discussions at the College was an undergraduate of the class of 1777, Alexander Hamilton. On one occasion, a mob came to the College, bent on doing violence to the president, but Hamilton held their attention with a speech, giving Cooper enough time to escape. The next year the Revolutionary War broke out and the College was turned into a military hospital and barracks. The American Revolution and the subsequent war were catastrophic for the operation of King's College. It suspended instruction for eight years beginning in 1776 with the arrival of the Continental Army in the spring of that year. The suspension continued through the military occupation of New York City by British troops until their departure in 1783. The college's library was looted and its sole building requisitioned for use as a military hospital first by American and then British forces. Although the college had been considered a bastion of Tory sentiment, it nevertheless produced many key leaders of the Revolutionary generation ‚Äî individuals later instrumental in the college's revival. Among the earliest students and trustees of King's College were five \\"founding fathers\\" of the United States: John Jay, who negotiated the Treaty of Paris between the United States and the Kingdom of Great Britain, ending the Revolutionary War, and who later became the first Chief Justice of the United States; Alexander Hamilton, military aide to General George Washington, author of most of the Federalist Papers, and the first Secretary of the Treasury; Gouverneur Morris, the author of the final draft of the United States Constitution; Robert R. Livingston, a member of the Committee of Five, that drafted the Declaration of Independence; and Egbert Benson who represented New York in the Continental Congress and the Annapolis Convention, and who was a ratifier of the United States Constitution. Post Revolutionary War Recovery (1784‚Äì1800) =Columbia College under the Regents= DeWitt Clinton, one of the first students enrolled in \\"Columbia College\\" King's college had been in a state of abeyance for eight years by the time the war ended, with many of the members of the college's Board of Governors either absent or killed during the revolution. The college turned to the State of New York in order to restore its vitality, promising to make whatever changes to the schools charter the state might demand. The Legislature agreed to assist the college, and on May 1, 1784, it passed \\"an Act for granting certain privileges to the College heretofore called King's College.\\" The Act created a Board of Regents to oversee the resuscitation of King's, giving them the power to hire a college president and appoint professors, but prohibiting the College from administering any \\"religious test-oath\\" to its faculty. Finally, in an effort to demonstrate its support for the new Republic, the Legislature stipulated that \\"the College within the City of New York heretofore called King's College be forever hereafter called and known by the name of Columbia College.\\" On May 5, 1784, the Regents held their first meeting, instructing Treasurer Brockholst Livingston and Secretary Robert Harpur (who was Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy at King's) to recover the books, records and any other assets that had been dispersed during the war, and appointing a committee to supervise the repairs of the college building. In addition, the Regents moved quickly to rebuild Columbia's faculty, appointing William Cochran instructor of Greek and Latin. In the summer of 1784, after the legislature passed the act restoring the college, Major General James Clinton, a hero of the revolutionary war, brought his son DeWitt Clinton to New York on his way to enroll him as a student at the College of New Jersey. When James Duane, the Mayor of New York and a member of the Regents, heard that the younger Clinton was leaving the state for his education, he pleaded with Cochran to offer him admission to the reconstituted Columbia. Cochran agreed ‚Äî partly because DeWitt's uncle, George Clinton, the Governor of New York, had recently been elected Chancellor of the College by the Regents ‚Äî and DeWitt Clinton became one of nine students admitted to Columbia in the year 1784. During the period under the Regents, many efforts were made to put the University on respectable footing, resolving to organize the college into the four faculties of Arts, Divinity, Medicine, and Law. A number of different professorships were created within each faculty, while the college remained under the supervision of the Regents. The staff of the entire university - which included numerous aforementioned professors, a president, a secretary, and a librarian ‚Äì operated under the yearly budget of ¬£1,200. During this period no president was able to be appointed due to the college's inadequate funds, which rendered it unable to offer a salary as would induce a suitable person to accept the office. Instead, the duties of the president's office were held by the schools various professors, which led to discord between the school's faculty members. The Regents finally became aware of the college's defective constitution in February 1787 and appointed a revision committee, which was headed by John Jay and Alexander Hamilton. In April of that same year, a new charter was adopted for the college, still in use today, granting power to a private board of twenty-four Trustees. =Columbia College= :Includes the administration of William Samuel Johnson (1787‚Äì1800) College Hall in 1790 On May 21, 1787, William Samuel Johnson, the son of Dr. Samuel Johnson, was unanimously elected President of Columbia College. Prior to serving at the University, Johnson had participated in the First Continental Congress and been chosen as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention. For a period in the 1790s, with New York City as the federal and state capital and the country under successive Federalist governments, a revived Columbia thrived under the auspices of Federalists such as Hamilton and Jay. Both President George Washington and Vice President John Adams attended the College's commencement on May 6, 1789, as a tribute of honor to the many alumni of the school that had been instrumental in bringing about the independence of the fledgling United States of America. During the period of Johnson's presidency, the College's campus began to expand, and in 1792 a new library extension was built to accommodate the College's growing library with the help of a grant from the Legislature of New York State. In December 1793, the Professorship of Law was filled by the election of James Kent, who gave the first instruction of law at any American University and was a forerunner to the University's Law School. On July 16, 1800, the seventy-four-year-old Dr. Johnson resigned his presidency of the College. In 1801, the Board of Trustees appointed Charles Henry Wharton as Dr. Johnson's successor. Wharton was to assume the office of president at the August commencement ceremonies, but he did not appear for them, and resigned in the fall. College stagnation (1800‚Äì1857) Despite the College's liberal acceptance of various religious and ethnic groups, during the period from 1785‚Äì1849 the institutional life of the college was a continuous struggle for existence, owing to inadequate means and lack of financial support. The curriculum of the college during the beginning of the 19th century was mostly focused on study of the classics. As a result, the major prerequisite for admission into the College was familiarity with Greek and Latin and a basic understanding of mathematics. In 1810, following the advice of a committee put together by members of the school, the College greatly tightened its admission standards; nonetheless, admission of qualified students increased, with 135 students matriculating in 1810. In the preceding decade, the average size of the graduating class had been seventeen. Because the school had no athletic program, student life during this period was mainly focused around literary groups such as the Philolexian Society, which was founded in 1802. In 1811, the College's new president William Harris presided over what became known as the \\"\\"Riotous Commencement\\" in which students violently protested the faculty's decision not to confer a degree upon John Stevenson, who had inserted objectionable words into his commencement speech. The main building which housed the College was decayed and unsightly in appearance; however, the funds of the College were augmented somewhat by the growing importance of its investments in real estate, although the true value of some of these acquisitions would not come to light until over a century later. For example, in 1814 the New York Legislature responded to the College's appeal for financial assistance by giving the school the Elgin Botanic Garden, a twenty-acre tract of land that had been privately developed as the nation's first botanical garden by physician David Hosack, but which Hosack had closed and resold to the state at a loss. The site, which had been outside of the city limits in 1801, was leased by Columbia to John D. Rockefeller Jr. in the 1920s for the construction of Rockefeller Center. It was still owned by Columbia until 1985, when it was sold for $400 million. In November 1813, the College agreed to combine its medical school with The College of Physicians and Surgeons, a new school created by the Regents of New York, forming Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. During the 1820s, the College renovated its campus and continued to seek grants from the state while it slowly expanded the scope of its academic catalog, adding Italian courses in 1825. The College's enrollment, structure, and academics stagnated for the remaining forty years, with many of the college presidents doing little to change the way that the College functioned. Adding to the woes of the College during this period, in 1831 the school began to face direct competition in the form of the University of the City of New York, which was later to become New York University. This new university had a more utilitarian curriculum, which stood in contrast to Columbia's focus on ancient literature. As a demonstration of NYU's popularity, by the second year of its operation it had 158 students, whereas Columbia College, eighty years after its founding, only had 120. Trustees of Columbia attempted to block the founding of NYU, issuing pamphlets to dissuade the Legislature from opening another university while Columbia continued to struggle financially. By July, 1854 the Christian Examiner of Boston, in an article entitled \\"The Recent Difficulties at Columbia College\\", noted that the school was \\"good in classics\\" yet \\"weak in sciences\\", and had \\"very few distinguished graduates\\". When Charles King became Columbia's president in November 1849, the College was in large amounts of debt, having exceeded their annual expenditure by about $2200 for the past fifteen years. On his formal inauguration, King spoke on the duties and responsibilities of the university staff, and espoused the virtues of copying the English university system.Columbia University, Addresses at the Inauguration of Mr. Charles King (1848), Ch. 4, pp. 3‚Äì53 By this time, the College's investments in New York real estate, particularly the Botanical Garden, became a primary source of steady income for the school, mainly owing to the city's rapidly increasing population. Expansion and Madison Avenue (1857‚Äì1896) In 1857, the College moved from Park Place to a primarily Gothic Revival campus on 49th Street and Madison Avenue, where it remained for the next fifty years. The transition to the new campus coincided with a new outlook for the college; during the commencement of that year, College President Charles King proclaimed Columbia \\"a university\\". During the last half of the nineteenth century, under the leadership of President F.A.P. Barnard, the institution rapidly assumed the shape of a true modern university. Columbia Law School was founded in 1858, and in 1864 the School of Mines, the country's first such institution and the precursor to today's Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science, was established. Barnard College for women, established by the eponymous Columbia president, was established in 1889; the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons came under the aegis of the University in 1891, followed by Teachers College, Columbia University in 1893. The Graduate Faculties in Political Science, Philosophy, and Pure Science awarded its first PhD in 1875. This period also witnessed the inauguration of Columbia's participation in intercollegiate sports, with the creation of the baseball team in 1867, the organization of the football team in 1870, and the creation of a crew team by 1873. The first intercollegiate Columbia football game was a 6‚Äì3 loss to Rutgers. The Columbia Daily Spectator began publication during this period as well, in 1877.Columbia College Student Life Timeline Morningside Heights (1896‚ÄìPresent) Columbia University, 1910In 1896, the trustees officially authorized the use of yet another new name, Columbia University, and today the institution is officially known as \\"Columbia University in the City of New York.\\" Additionally, the engineering school was renamed the \\"School of Mines, Engineering and Chemistry.\\" At the same time, university president Seth Low moved the campus again, from 49th Street to its present location, a more spacious (and, at the time, more rural) campus in the developing neighborhood of Morningside Heights. The site was formerly occupied by the Bloomingdale Lunatic Asylum. One of the asylum's buildings, the warden's cottage (later known as East Hall and Buell Hall), still stands today.\\"Columbia University's Lunatic Past.\\" Ephemeral New York website. May 5, 2008 The building often depicted as emblematic of Columbia is the centerpiece of the Morningside Heights campus, Low Memorial Library. Constructed in 1895, the building is still referred to as \\"Low Library\\" although it has not functioned as a library since 1934. It currently houses the offices of the President, Provost, the Visitor's Center, and the Trustees' Room and Columbia Security. Patterned loosely on the Classical Pantheon, it is surmounted by the largest all-granite dome in the United States. Under the leadership of Low's successor, Nicholas Murray Butler, Columbia rapidly became the nation's major institution for research, setting the \\"multiversity\\" model that later universities would adopt. On the Morningside Heights campus, Columbia centralized on a single campus the College, the School of Law, the Graduate Faculties, the School of Mines (predecessor of the Engineering School), and the College of Physicians & Surgeons. Butler went on to serve as president of Columbia for over four decades and became a giant in American public life (as one-time vice presidential candidate and a Nobel Laureate). His introduction of \\"downtown\\" business practices in university administration led to innovations in internal reforms such as the centralization of academic affairs, the direct appointment of registrars, deans, provosts, and secretaries, as well as the formation of a professionalized university bureaucracy, unprecedented among American universities at the time. Archetypal Columbia man, from a 1902 poster In 1893 the Columbia University Press was founded to \\"promote the study of economic, historical, literary, scientific and other subjects; and to promote and encourage the publication of literary works embodying original research in such subjects.\\" Among its publications are The Columbia Encyclopedia, first published in 1935, and The Columbia Lippincott Gazetteer of the World, first published in 1952. In 1902, New York newspaper magnate Joseph Pulitzer donated a substantial sum to the University for the founding of a school to teach journalism. The result was the 1912 opening of the Graduate School of Journalism‚Äîthe only journalism school in the Ivy League. Columbia does not, however, offer an undergraduate degree in journalism. In New York City, there are only two universities that offer such degrees:St. John's University (New York) and New York University. The school is the administrator of the Pulitzer Prize and the duPont-Columbia Award in broadcast journalism. In 1904 Columbia organized adult education classes into a formal program called Extension Teaching (later renamed University Extension). Courses in Extension Teaching eventually give rise to the Columbia Writing Program, the Columbia Business School, and the School of Dentistry. In 1928, Seth Low Junior College was established by Columbia University in order to mitigate the number of Jewish applicants to Columbia College. The college was closed in 1938 due to the adverse effects of the Great Depression and its students were subsequently taught at Mornington Heights, although they did not belong to any college but to the university at large.Asimov, I. (1979) In Memory Yet Green, Avon Books, pp. 157, 159‚Äì160, 240 There was an evening school called University Extension, which taught night classes, for a fee, to anyone willing to attend. In 1947, the program was reorganized as an undergraduate college and designated the School of General Studies in response to the return of GIs after World War II. In 1995, the School of General Studies was again reorganized as a full-fledged liberal arts college for non- traditional students (those who have had an academic break of one year or more) and was fully integrated into Columbia's traditional undergraduate curriculum.https://gs.columbia.edu/what-makes-gs-different-columbias- traditional-undergraduate-colleges Within the same year, the Division of Special Programs‚Äîlater the School of Continuing Education, and now the School of Professional Studies‚Äîwas established to reprise the former role of University Extension.http://senate.columbia.edu/archives/resolutions_archives/resolutions/01-02/CEres.htm While the School of Professional Studies only offered non-degree programs for lifelong learners and high school students in its earliest stages, it now offers degree programs in a diverse range of professional and inter- disciplinary fields.http://sps.columbia.edu/about/history By the late 1930s, a Columbia student could study with the likes of Jacques Barzun, Paul Lazarsfeld, Mark Van Doren, Lionel Trilling, and I. I. Rabi. The University's graduates during this time were equally accomplished‚Äîfor example, two alumni of Columbia's Law School, Charles Evans Hughes and Harlan Fiske Stone (who also held the position of Law School dean), served successively as Chief Justices of the United States. Dwight Eisenhower served as Columbia's president from 1948 until he became the President of the United States in 1953. Research into the atom by faculty members John R. Dunning, I. I. Rabi, Enrico Fermi and Polykarp Kusch placed Columbia's Physics Department in the international spotlight in the 1940s after the first nuclear pile was built to start what became the Manhattan Project. Following the end of World War II, the School of International Affairs was founded in 1946, beginning by offering the Master of International Affairs. To satisfy an increasing desire for skilled public service professionals at home and abroad, the School added the Master of Public Administration degree in 1977. In 1981, the School was renamed the School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA). The School introduced an MPA in Environmental Science and Policy in 2001 and, in 2004, SIPA inaugurated its first doctoral program ‚Äî the interdisciplinary Ph.D. in Sustainable Development. During World War II, Columbia, Morningside Heights campus, was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission. During the 1960s Columbia experienced large-scale student activism centering over the Vietnam War and the demand for greater student rights. Many students, led by the Students for a Democratic Society and its President Mark Rudd protested the University's ties with the defense establishment and its controversial plans to build a gym in Morningside Park. The fervor on campus reached a climax in the spring of 1968 when hundreds of students occupied various buildings on campus. The incident forced the resignation of Columbia's then President, Grayson Kirk and the establishment of the University Senate. Columbia College first admitted women in the fall of 1983, after a decade of failed negotiations with Barnard College, an all female institution affiliated with the University, to merge the two schools. Barnard College still remains affiliated with Columbia, and all Barnard graduates are issued diplomas authorized by both Columbia University and Barnard College.Link text. During the late 20th century, the University underwent significant academic, structural, and administrative changes as it developed into a major research university. For much of the 19th century, the University consisted of decentralized and separate faculties specializing in Political Science, Philosophy, and Pure Science. In 1979, these faculties were merged into the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. In 1991, the faculties of Columbia College, the School of General Studies, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the School of the Arts, and the School of Professional Studies were merged into the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, leading to the academic integration and centralized governance of these schools. In 2010, the School of International and Public Affairs, which was previously a part of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, became an independent faculty.http://fas.columbia.edu/home/about-faculty-arts-and-sciences/history In 1997, the Columbia Engineering School was renamed the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science, in honor of Chinese businessman Z. Y. Fu, who gave Columbia $26 million. The school is popularly referred to as \\"SEAS\\" or simply \\"the engineering school.\\" See also * Columbia College of Columbia University, the oldest liberal arts undergraduate college at Columbia University, New York * Columbia Daily Spectator, a student newspaper at Columbia University, New York * Columbia Journal, the graduate writing program's student-founded, student-run literary journal Columbia University School of the Arts * Columbia Journalism Review, a bimonthly journal published by the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism * Columbia Law School :* Columbia Business Law Review, a monthly journal published by students at Columbia Law School * The Pulitzer Prize * The School at Columbia University, New York City * Teachers College, Columbia University's Graduate School of Education  References  =Citations= =Sources=  *  External links  * Columbia University website Columbia University Universities and colleges in Manhattan Columbia University Columbia University ","title":"History of Columbia University"},{"id":"31512468","title":"Fred Ward Memorial Show"},{"id":"31512476","text":"Elsie Ruth Anderson (23 June 1907, Newport, Rhode Island ‚Äì 24 November 1989, Boston, Massachusetts) was an American musicologist, meteorologist, and editor.

Biography =Early life= Antoni Sadowski was born in about 1669 in Poland. He hailed from Ostrowiec ≈öwiƒôtokrzyski near the town of Kielce. His father was Marcin Sadowski, who was a chamberlain at the Polish king's castle in Gosty≈Ñ and, as a deputy of the Polish Sejm, an inspector of the king's land holdings in Ukraine. Though it is not known which schools Antoni attended in his youth, he did receive a classical education. During the Great Northern War in 1701, Sadowski was taken captive with his brother at Riga. He managed to escape captivity, and made his way to Scotland and England. He sailed to the British colonies, landing in New York City in 1704. =In America= A historical marker commemorating Sadowski on the exterior of the Allegheny County Courthouse in downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. After Sadowski moved to the colony of New York, he married Marya Bordt (anglicized as Mary Bird), daughter of Andrew Bird of Newtown, New York. They had six children together. Their eldest son Andrew Sadowski and three daughters, Justina, Anna, and Sofia, all married and had children. Two of their grandsons through son Andrew, James and Jacob Sadowski, became noted Kentucky pioneers. Sadowski moved his family from New Jersey to Pennsylvania in 1712, to a property along the Schuylkill River. He, along with George Boone‚Äîgrandfather of the noted frontiersman Daniel Boone‚Äîwas a founder of Amity Township in Berks County in 1719. Sadowski worked to establish friendly relations with the Native Americans in the area, learning the Delaware (Lenape) and Iroquois languages. He served as an interpreter to other settlers. He became an Indian trader, traveling as far as Logstown (a village near the site of modern Ambridge, Pennsylvania).See image of historical marker at Wikimedia Commons. With two other Indian traders, he established a trading post at present-day Kittanning, Pennsylvania, in June 1729. He became a citizen of Pennsylvania in 1735. =Death and legacy= Sadowski died on April 22, 1736, in Amityville, Pennsylvania, and is buried in the cemetery of Old St. Gabriel's Episcopal Church in Douglassville. His grave marker bears the following inscription: > Whether or not he opened an Indian trading post on the shores of Lake Erie > and gave his name to Sandusky, Ohio, here lies the greatest Polish > frontiersman of colonial times, an organizer of Amity Township in 1719, and > founder of the Sandusky family in America.

It is endemic to Texas, where it is known from only two counties. It persists in small remnants of its gulf coastal prairie habitat. It is a federally listed endangered species of the United States. This is a small perennial herb growing up to 15 centimeters tall from a woody taproot. It may grow in colonies.USFWS. Slender Rushpea Five-year Review. July 2008. The plant has leaves up to 6 centimeters long which are made up of 5 to 7 pairs of leaflets. The flowers have petals about half a centimeter long in shades of yellowish pink, orange, coral, or salmon.Hoffmannseggia tenella. The Nature Conservancy The blooming season is in March through June, and more blooming may occur later if there is adequate rainfall.Hoffmannseggia tenella. Texas Parks & Wildlife. The fruit is a flat, straight legume pod just over a centimeter long. This plant is known only from Nueces and Kleberg Counties in Texas. The natural habitat of this species is a type of coastal shortgrass prairie dominated by native grasses such as buffalograss (Buchloe dactyloides), Texas wintergrass (Stipa leucotrica), and Texas grama (Bouteloua rigidiseta). Other plants in the habitat include huisache (Acacia farnesiana), huisachillo (Acacia schaffneri), spiny hackberry (Celtis laevigata), brasil (Condalia hookeri), retama (Parkinsonia aculeata), lotebush (Ziziphus obtusifolia), tasajillo (Opuntia leptocaulis), and Engelmann's prickly pear (Opuntia engelmannii). The rushpea sometimes grows alongside the South Texas ambrosia (Ambrosia cheiranthifolia), another endangered species. It has a patchy distribution in remaining strips of appropriate habitat, occurring in just 15% of its former range. Most of its habitat has been converted to agricultural use as cropland and pastures. The land has also been invaded by non-native plant species that compete with the rare plant. The worst offender is Kleberg bluestem (Dichanthium annulatum), a large grass. It grows very quickly and tall, shading out the slender rushpea. The dense habit of the grass may hold in heat and humidity, which foster the growth of fungi on the seedlings of the rushpea. It drains nutrients and water from the soil, and it may produce allelopathic substances that discourage growth of the rushpea.

Many of these places and structures have been placed on the National Register of Historic Places. The pre-Park Service structures include homestead cabins from the earliest settlement of Jackson Hole, working ranches that once covered the valley floor, and dude ranches or guest ranches that catered to the tourist trade that grew up in the 1920s and 1930s, before the park was expanded to encompass nearly all of Jackson Hole. Many of these were incorporated into the park to serve as Park Service personnel housing, or were razed to restore the landscape to a natural appearance. Others continued to function as inholdings under a life estate in which their former owners could continue to use and occupy the property until their death. Other buildings, built in the mountains after the initial establishment of the park in 1929, or in the valley after the park was expanded in 1950, were built by the Park Service to serve park visitors, frequently employing the National Park Service Rustic style of design. Homesteads Cunningham Cabin The earliest remaining built object in Grand Teton National Park is a diversion ditch, now known as Mining Ditch, which carried water in the vicinity of Schwabacher's Landing for prospecting activities. Dug around 1871-72, the ditch lent its name to nearby Ditch Creek. The prospectors left no other trace in Jackson Hole. The valley's first permanent settlers did not arrive until 1884, when John Holland and John Carnes claimed a homestead to the north of Jackson, of which no trace remains.Kaiser, Harvey (1997). \\"Landmarks in the Landscape\\", San Francisco: Chronicle Books , pp. 158-159 The Cunningham Cabin is the earliest remaining relic of settlement in the northern portion of Jackson Hole. It was built by J. Pierce Cunningham in 1885, at about the same time as the town of Jackson was established at the southern end of Jackson Hole. William D. Menor established Menor's Ferry across the Snake River in 1892, homesteading the lands on the western bank of the river, and operating the ferry until a bridge was built in 1927. The Luther Taylor Cabins near Kelly were built beginning in 1916. The cabins were featured in the 1953 Western movie Shane. The Manges Cabin was built by James Manges, the second homesteader after Bill Menor to settle on the west side of the Snake. Manges' operation grew to become a working ranch, later the Elbo Dude Ranch, which featured a racetrack and rodeo grounds. The perceived blight of the Elbo development, so close to the mountains, led Struthers Burt and other local citizens to consider strategies for land preservation in the valley in the 1920s. The Elbo was acquired by the Park Service in 1956, and after some time as employee lodging, was gradually demolished to allow the site to return to its natural state. The Manges Cabin is the only remnant. Homestead buildings were crude, using hewn timber harvested locally and resting on minimal foundations, excavation being difficult in the valley's stony soil. Log construction was employed almost universally, given the absence of local sawmills. This rustic local construction practice was to make a return as the economic focus of the valley shifted from agricultural development to tourism. Working ranches Hunter hereford barn With the advent of large-scale ranches worked by extended families with staffs of cowboys, wranglers and hired help, Jackson Hole saw the construction of planned complexes of buildings, as opposed to ad hoc assemblages of sheds and cabins. The new structures used milled lumber and typical western carpentry details in keeping with Wyoming construction practices. The working ranches moved away from rustic design, reflecting a maturing social order in the newly populated valley, which by 1909 had three sawmills to provide sawn lumber. One of the earliest ranchers was Josiah David Ferrin, also known as \\"Uncle Si,\\" who became a successful cattle rancher selling beef to crews building Jackson Lake Dam. The Elk Ranch at its height had 2000 cattle on near Moran. Ferrin sold the property to the Snake River Land Company in 1928. In the first decade of the 20th century, Mormon settlers established a farming community in the Antelope Flats area of Jackson Hole. Becoming known as Mormon Row, the settlement extends as a line of farms, or \\"line village,\\" along the former Jackson-Moran Road, with irrigated farmsteads running perpendicular to the road. The six homestead complexes once covered the area between the Gros Ventre River and Blacktail Butte. Individual farms included the Andy Chambers, John Moulton and T.A. Moulton homesteads. The Andy Chambers Ranch is the most complete of the surviving ranches. The Hunter Hereford Ranch was a 1909 homestead on the eastern side of Jackson Hole that became a hobby ranch for William and Eileen Hunter in the 1940s. Its spectacular location led to its use as a movie set in the 1950s. The property was sold to the Park Service in 1957, but operated as a ranch even after Eileen Hunter's death in 1969. While the residential areas have been demolished, much of the working ranch facility remains. Joe Pfeifer, a former miner from Butte, Montana, established a homestead near Mormon Row in November 1910. The homestead's well-preserved remains were burned in a 1994 brush fire, but were documented by the Historic American Buildings Survey in 1979 and 1992. Geraldine Lucas arrived in Jackson Hole following her 1912 retirement from teaching in New York at the age of 47. She built a cabin in 1912, eventually amassing several hundred acres of lands and becoming a significant opponent of the Rockefeller-backed Snake River Land Company. However, following Lucas' death, the Lucas property was acquired in 1944 by the Snake River Land Company and was used as the residence for its general manager, whose life estate ran until 1975, after which it was turned over to the Park Service. Dude ranches and guest ranches =Dude ranches= Map of the historical structures of Grand Teton National Park The first dude ranch in Jackson Hole was the JY Ranch, which was converted from a working ranch. It became the property of the Rockefeller family when the Rockefellers started acquiring land in Jackson Hole, remaining an inholding as the family gradually donated portions to the Park Service. The final portion of the JY became the Laurance S. Rockefeller Preserve in Grand Teton National Park in 2008. The Bar B C Dude Ranch was the first dude ranch in Jackson Hole to be conceived as a dude ranch from its inception. Established in 1912, it strongly influenced later dude ranch development and had a significant role in the development of tourism in Jackson Hole. The Bar BC owed much of its success to its co-owner, author Struthers Burt, who had started the JY and who published Diary of a Dude Wrangler in the Saturday Evening Post in 1924. The White Grass Dude Ranch was established in 1913, when George Tucker Bispham, a former Bar B C employee, and Harold Hammond consolidated their adjoining working ranches right at the foot of the Tetons. The White Grass inholding operated as a dude ranch until 1985, when its life estate expired, the longest-active dude ranch in the valley. After a period of abandonment and deterioration, the White Grass was rehabilitated as the Western Center for Historic Preservation in a joint venture between the National Trust for Historic Preservation and the National Park Service. The Double Diamond Dude Ranch was started in 1924 by Joseph Clark and Fran William, initially catering primarily to boys from Eastern families. While most of its buildings were destroyed by a wildfire in 1985, the ranch's 1945 dining hall survives. The area is now known as the Climbers Ranch, used as a base camp for mountain climbers. Double Diamond Ranch, also known as Climbers' Ranch The Flying V Ranch was established in 1921 as a dude ranch, but was sold in 1935 to Gustav Koven and Paul Petzoldt, who intended to operate the ranch as a climbing school. After changing the name to the Ramshorn Dude Ranch, the partnership fell apart. After acquisition by the Park Service in 1956 the Ramshorn was operated as a concession under the Elbo Ranch name, which had been displaced from its previous location at the foot of the mountains when the original Elbo-Manges ranch was purchased and used for Park Service personnel housing. The Ramshorn now houses the Teton Science School. Another 1920s establishment was Leek's Lodge on upper Jackson Lake, close to the AMK, which continued to operate as a concession associated with the Signal Mountain Lodge into the 1970s. Although the Park Service had removed most of the buildings, the main lodge stood until 1998, when it was destroyed by fire, leaving only the lodge's chimney standing. The original Jackson Lake Lodge was established nearby by Eugene Amoretti, and featured the first hot and cold running water in the valley. It was replaced by the present Jackson Lake Lodge in 1955. The Triangle X Ranch was established in 1926 on the east side of Jackson Hole and is the last dude ranch operating in the park. The Turner family was from Utah, and after failing to grow potatoes, took to guiding hunting trips. The Triangle X operated both as outfitters and as dude ranchers. The Triangle X Barn, built in 1928 of salvaged materials, is listed on the National Register. The STS Dude Ranch was established by Buster and Frances Ester on the west bank of the Snake River a little south of Menor's Ferry in 1921. The unprofitable operation was purchased by conservationists Olaus Murie, his wife Margaret (Mardie) Murie and scientist Adolph Murie and his wife Louise. Adolph and Louise lived in the original ranch complex, while Olaus and Mardie lived in a house they built nearby on the property. The Murie Ranch hosted some of the first meetings of The Wilderness Society in the 1950s. The Murie Ranch was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2006, and is operated as the Murie Center conference facility by the National Park Service. =Vacation houses= Other ranches took the form of rustic family retreats, rather than as guest ranches. The 4 Lazy F Dude Ranch was started as a working ranch in 1914 by Philadelphian Bryant Mears, who called it the Sun Star. The Mears family sold it to William Frew, a dude from Pittsburgh, who renamed it the 4 Lazy F for the \\"four lazy Frews.\\" The Frews operated the ranch as both a family retreat and as a dude ranch for a few selected guests. It remains in the Frew family as a life estate inholding. The AMK Ranch, established in the 1920s on the east side of Jackson Lake, was a personal retreat for William Johnson of The Hoover Company. Alfred Berolzheimer of the Eagle (later Berol) pencil company bought the ranch in 1936, greatly expanding it in a high-rustic style. The Brinkerhoff, on the shore of Jackson Lake near Signal Mountain, was a pure vacation lodge, built in 1946 by oil executive Zach Brinkerhoff and furnished with Thomas C. Molesworth furniture. The Sky Ranch at the outlet of Death Canyon was established in 1953 as a summer retreat for the Balderston family, close to the White Grass ranch. William Balderston had been a surveyor and photographer for the Jackson Lake Dam project in 1914, going on to eventually become the president of the Philco Corporation. The Balderston family were regular guests at the White Grass, and friends of the Muries. They bought of White Grass property from Frank Galey in 1952. Balderston hired Philadelphia architect John Arnold Bower to design a small group of cabins, a barn and support structures. Retired politician John Hogan bought a homestead on the east side of the park in 1926 for use as a guest ranch and fox farm. In 1930 the ranch was purchased by the Snake River Land Company and was its headquarters while the Rockefeller-owned company was assembling lands in Jackson Hole for donation to the Park Service. The main house was occupied by SRLC manager Harold Fabian and his wife Josephine until 1945, when they moved to the Geraldine Lucas homestead on the other side of the valley. Donated as part of the SRLC lands in the 1950s, the house was used as a dormitory by the Park Service for a time. Other significant extant vacation homes, dude ranches and small working ranches include Dick and Ethel Reimer House, built in 1938 between Moose and Mormon Row at the end of Blacktail Butte, and the McCollister residential complex farther to the east on Antelope Flats Road. Paul W. McCollister was the primary developer of Teton Village. The McCollister compound was built and expanded between 1953 and 1987. The Aspen Ridge Ranch, in the same area, is a complex of modest log residential and agricultural buildings, built in 1910 and expanded in 1946. The Wolff Ranch, located farther north near Moran, is small dude ranch complex established in the 1940s by Stippy Wolff and Frank Allen. =Tourist camps= The central Teton Range with the Highlands Historic District in the foreground In the 1930s increasing numbers of visitors began to arrive in the park by automobile, and accommodations were developed to suit the new, more transient tourists. The Kimmel Kabins, established in 1937 by J.D. and Lura Kimmel, are the last example of as many as twelve similar motor court-type lodgings in the park. Its remaining structures are used to house Park Service personnel. Harry and Elizabeth Sensenbach were earlier pioneers in this market, opening their homestead in front of the Cathedral Group to automobile tourists. The Sensenbach operation was bought in 1946 by Charles Byron, Jeanne Jenkins and Gloria Jenkins Wardell, who expanded the operation as the Highlands guest ranch. The Highlands was acquired by the Park Service in 1972 and used for employee housing. The Signal Mountain Lodge was one of several ventures by the Wort family, starting in the 1920s as Ole Warner's fishing camp. The Worts developed the property after they purchased it in 1931, adding cabins and a small lodge. They sold the camp in 1940, when it acquired its present name. Apart from a few cabins, most of the resort is of relatively recent construction. Jimmy Manges, whose old ranch became the first Elbo Ranch, had built a cabin on his remaining land near the Double Diamond in 1926. He gradually created a guest camp on the property, calling it the X Quarter Circle X. The camp expanded to twenty cabins by the 1940s, when his nephew Irwin Lesher and Irwin's wife Marvel took over management and improved the camp's standard of hygiene. The Leshers continued to manage the camp after Jimmy's death in 1960 until Lesher sold out to the Park Service in 1980. The 1925 Chapel of the Transfiguration catered to the tourist trade. Built and owned by St. John's Episcopal Church, the chapel was built near Menor's Ferry, in an area that became known as Moose. The grounds and church interior focus on the Cathedral Group of peaks, all in a consciously rustic style that emphasizes the natural environment over the built environment. The Chapel of the Sacred Heart was built in similar rustic style near Signal Mountain by the Our Lady of the Mountains Catholic Church of Jackson in 1958. The dude ranches and guest ranches were overwhelmingly rustic in style, representing a return to log construction and deliberately \\"Western\\"-looking details, as a way of appealing to eastern dudes looking for an informal retreat reminiscent of the frontier. Park Service infrastructure =Early development= Superintendent's Residence at Beaver Creek Grand Teton National Park was designated in 1929 to encompass only the Teton Range and a narrow strip of land at the foot of the mountains including Jenny Lake and several smaller lakes. Nearly all of Jackson Hole was excluded from the park in the face of opposition from ranching interests. At the same time, the Rockefeller family, using the shield of the Snake River Land Company, began to buy lands in the valley for preservation and eventual donation to an expanded park. The SRLC lands were added to Jackson Hole National Monument in 1949, and Grand Teton National Park absorbed the monument lands in 1950. During the 1930s the Park Service began to build visitor and administrative facilities in the original park lands.The park's first point of visitor contact was, for many years, at Jenny Lake. The Jenny Lake Ranger Station comprised purpose-built structures as well as structures moved to the site from elsewhere. Chief of these relocated structures were the former Lee Manges cabin, built about 1925 and moved to the site to become the ranger station, and the Crandall Photo Studio, built around 1925-26 and later moved to the site. In the 1930s the Park Service added rustic public toilet facilities, called \\"comfort stations.\\" The White Grass Ranger Station was built to a standardized Park Service plan in 1930. The park had already inherited a number of similar structures built by the U.S. Forest Service prior to the 1929 establishment of the park, including the Leigh Lake Ranger Patrol Cabin and the Lower Berry Creek Patrol Cabin in the northern reaches of the park. As the Great Depression wore on, the Park Service received help from Civilian Conservation Corps labor, and a CCC camp was established at Jenny Lake. The CCC built the Cascade Canyon and Death Canyon barns, as well as the Moran Bay and Upper Granite Canyon patrol cabins. Despite their names, the barns were patrol cabins, built to standard Park Service designs from the Branch of Plans and Designs, and intentionally designed in the National Park Service Rustic style. The CCC built three comfort stations as well, including the String Lake Comfort Station, originally located at Jenny Lake. The largest concentration of structures from this era comprise the Old Administrative Area Historic District at Beaver Creek. The park headquarters, superintendent's residence, four employee residences and three warehouses were designed in Park Service Rustic style and built by the CCC between 1934 and 1939. The Moose Entrance Kiosk was built nearby, and has since been moved to Moose. Private development in the 1930s included the Jenny Lake Boat Concession Facilities, built by Charles Wort, who held a legacy concessioner's permit originally issued by the Forest Service, and who built a boathouse on Jenny Lake. Wort's family went on to establish the Wort Hotel in Jackson and the Signal Mountain Lodge. Robert Reimer, who took over the Wort concession at Jenny Lake in 1935, added a personal residence to the Jenny Lake ensemble. =Park expansion= Jackson Lake Lodge The expansion of the park into Jackson Hole brought a requirement for new facilities at the new park gateway at Moose. The Mission 66 program was conceived in 1955 to deal with the dramatic increase in visitation, particularly automobile-borne tourism, being experienced Park Service-wide. The Moose Visitor Center, a new administration building, and employee residences were built at Moose, just downstream from Menor's Ferry, where a bridge crossed the Snake River. At about the same time the Colter Bay Village complex was developed on Jackson Lake in the northern part of the park, providing camping, lodging and marina services. The largest development of this era was the new Jackson Lake Lodge, a reinterpretation of the traditional Park Service lodge concept in a modern style by architect Gilbert Stanley Underwood. Underwood, who had designed the rustic Bryce Canyon and Grand Canyon lodges as well as Yosemite's Ahwahnee Hotel, made a sharp break from the naturalistic rustic style, using concrete and steel and straight, sharp lines while he incorporated traditionally rustic colors and textures, framing a view of Mount Moran from the main lobby. The Jackson Lake Lodge was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2003. Context The historical structures of Grand Teton National Park span a period of little more than a century. They share a common heritage of rustic design and construction, first from necessity, and later from a common desire on the part of dude ranch operators and the National Park Service to evoke the aesthetics of the Western frontier. Grand Teton is unusual in its extensive inventory of structures from the pre-park period, a legacy of its expansion into areas that had been previously settled.

It is written from the point of view of Leo Hertzberg, an art historian living in New York. The author herself grew up in Northfield, Minnesota, and then moved to New York in 1978. In a discussion of the September 11 attacks, she describes New York as \\"as much an idea as an actual place\\".Siri Hustvedt, \\"Siri Hustvedt raconte le 11 septembre\\", booksmag, 11 September 2009 The work follows the relationship between Leo and artist, Bill Wechsler and the close ties between each of the characters' families. It explores themes of love, loss, art and psychology. Some specific psychological themes explored in the novel are grief, eating disorders and hysteria. Hustvedt discusses hysteria further in a talk entitled, \\"A writer's adventures in psychiatry and neuro-science\\"Siri Hustvedt, A writer's adventures in psychiatry and neuro-science, Key West Literary Siminar audio archives, 14 January 2007 and her sister, Asti Hustvedt, has written a book about the state entitled Medical muses : the culture of hysteria in nineteenth-century Paris.Asti Hustvedt, Medical muses : the culture of hysteria in nineteenth-century Paris.OCLC Number 712132172, Bloomsbury Publishing, 2011 Plot summary What I Loved opens with a painting of a woman 'wearing only a man's T-shirt', with the artist's shadow across the canvas. The protagonist, art historian Leon Hertzberg (Leo), purchases the painting and some time afterwards befriends the artist, Bill Wechsler. Bill is, at this stage, an unknown artist, though as the novel progresses, so too does his career in the New York art scene. This is in part due to Leo's writing, which brings Bill's work into the public eye. Bill is married to Lucille, a highly strung poet, and Leo is married to Erica, a literary academic. The two couples become close and move into the same apartment block. Erica and Lucille fall pregnant around the same time and have sons, Mathew and Mark. The first half of the novel explores their quiet, domestic lives, through the eyes of Leo. Lucille and Bill separate after he forms a relationship with Violet, the model who posed for the painting which opens the text. The opening of part Two of the novel is described by Robert Birnbaum, in an interview with the author, as like a punch in the faceRobert Birnbaum, Author of What I Loved talks with Robert Birnbaum, Identity Theory, 6 May 2003 and the pace of the novel accelerates after this point. Leo and Erica's son, Mathew, dies suddenly. Grief-stricken, Leo eventually loses Erica, who moves away for distance as well as work. Leo forms a close relationship with Bill's son Mark. Mark is, however, an insincere and somewhat amoral character, and a pattern is repeated between the two, of trust and betrayal, until Leo and the reader realise Mark is probably not capable of affection. Mark befriends performance and installation artist Teddy Giles, whose art is designed to shock, but seems empty and only designed to serve that one purpose. Bill eventually dies in his studio and Violet attempts to curtail her grief by cleaning manically. Leo becomes embroiled in a thriller- like plot attempting to track down Mark who has become lost in Teddy Giles's scene. Leo finally professes his love for Violet. She tells him he can have her for one night, but that she's then moving away. He declines and returns to his apartment alone. A minor character throughout the novel, Lazlo Finkelman, moves amongst similar circles to Teddy Giles and Mark, but with very different intentions and values. At the close of the novel, an aging Leo finds comfort in playing with Lazlo's young son. Reviews Andrew Roe in the San Francisco Chronicle had criticized several aspects of the novel including the author's \\"repetitive use of time transitions\\", but concluded that the novel is \\"another accomplished performance from‚Ä¶a writer of undeniable talent and someone from whom we can expect even better things in the future.Andrew Roe, N.Y. art-scene pals talk out their issues , San Francisco Chronicle, 9 March 2003\\" Janet Burroway in the New York Times Book Review writes of the protagonist in part One that his \\"parental concerns seem banal, and his ambivalent speculations less than engaging\\".

Camarillo Public Library will issue a free library card to any applicant with acceptable identification, as provided in the library's registration policy.Camarillo Public Library Registration Policy. Camarillo Public Library is located at 4101 Las Posas Road, on the corner of Las Posas Road and Fieldgate Drive.  History  The first library in Camarillo, which opened in 1895, consisted of a set of readers in a hallway at Pleasant Valley School. On April 8, 1915, Adolfo Camarillo spoke at a public hearing before the Ventura County Board of Supervisors in favor of establishing a countywide library system. The Camarillo Branch of the Ventura County Free Library opened on January 6, 1919, with a collection of 75 books. It was located in Mr. Israel Hernandez's Camarillo Mercantile Company until 1920, when it moved to a room in the Conejo Inn, owned by Mr. & Mrs. F.B. Merrill who welcomed borrowers anytime. After the Inn went out of business in 1931, Mrs. Ruth Fellows offered her sun porch as a temporary library. In December 1933, Adele Flynn became the Branch Library Assistant and moved the collection of 350 books to a cubbyhole in the post office and then to the Cawelti building. It was open for 2 hours on Mondays and Fridays. From April 1, 1941, to 1962, the library was located in a room in the new Community Center on Ventura Boulevard. The collection grew to 8,000 books. The two most popular library books in 1952 were The Caine Mutiny and The Old Man and the Sea. On May 18, 1962, a new branch was dedicated at Dizdar Park with room for 15,000 books, and a large reading area. Adele Flynn became the Children's Librarian and organized storytimes, the annual summer reading program, and other events to attract children to the library. On October 27, 1974, the library opened at 3100 Ponderosa Drive. Additionally, The Friends of the Camarillo Library was organized that year. The computerized circulation system was installed in 1982, replacing the card catalogue. The internet center for public use was dedicated in January, 1999. By 2007, the collection had grown to 120,000 items that included video cassettes, DVDs, music CDs, audiobooks, periodicals, and books. On March 31, 2007, the library opened in a state-of-the-art building at 4101 Las Posas Road.Richard, Sam.

Petersen Foundation Study Center  Financing  The building was funded by a grant of $15,621,473 from the California Public Library Construction & Renovation Act of 2000 and $11 million from the City of Camarillo. The Esper A. Petersen Foundation provided a $375,000 grant for the Esper A. Petersen Foundation Study Center.  Size  The current library location is four times larger than the old building that opened in 1974. The building includes the Friends of the Camarillo Library Book store, Giant Steps Cafe, an Adult Literacy Center, the library community room, a board room, a conference room, a technology lab, five study rooms, and the Esper A. Petersen Foundation Study Center.  Books & Materials  For the opening of the new building on March 31, 2007, 40,000 items were added to the 120,000 items that had been housed in the previous building. In 2008, the collection grew to 176,000 items. Since opening as a municipal library, the collection has grown to over 209,000 items. The library also subscribes to a variety of electronic databases, which provide patrons with remote access to thousands of periodical articles, e-books, e-audiobooks, online music, and more. Furthermore, the library houses, on loan, the Ventura County Genealogical Society's reference collection.  Technology  The library has 54 computers that are internet accessible, wireless internet access throughout the building, and a technology lab with six computers. The library also uses RFID in concert with self checkout computers.  Artwork  The pirate ship, book columns, and all of the artwork was created by Scenario Design, Inc., who has also produced work for Disneyland. The plaques next to each of the works of art give information about the inspiration for the piece and the name of the artist. The California Mission style tiles were made by the California Tile Company. The fountain, tile \\"carpets\\", and peacock were inspired by 1930s era Malibu tile, seen at the Adamson House in Malibu.

Early life and education Adam was born the youngest of three children near Highbury, North London, where her father was a teacher at Drayton Park School. With the start of World War I, he enlisted and was killed in action at Ypres in 1918 causing her mother and siblings to relocate to Yorkshire to live with her mother's parents. She became ill at the age of nine and spent a year at the Liverpool Open-Air Hospital to treat her skeletal tuberculosis of an elbow and rickets. On her release from hospital, Adam won a scholarship to Doncaster High School in South Yorkshire, where she gained a life-long passion for science and mathematics. In 1931, she enrolled in St Hugh's College, Oxford with a scholarship in physics, becoming \\"the first woman to achieve a first in physics at Oxford\\". There she gained an MA followed by a D.Phil. from Lady Margaret Hall. Career When a new director of the Oxford observatory, who had just installed the university's first solar telescope, announced his research program in solar physics, Adam (who had just earned a first in physics) knocked on his door and said, \\"How about me?\\" By joining the research team, she became the first postgraduate student and solar physicist at the university's observatory. Over the years, she became a key figure there for the remainder of her life, eventually becoming acting director during World War II after the director left to work on aircraft production. She became permanent assistant director thereafter and took over the observatory's financial accounts. She was appointed an assistant tutor at St. Hugh's, and also \\"taught astronomy courses, with an emphasis on astronavigation, to Royal Navy and RAF cadets\\". She was \\"internationally known for her work on the nature of sunspots and on their magnetic fields.\\" She was a lecturer at the University of Oxford in the Department of Astrophysics from 1937‚Äì1979, and was a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society.

His rule began in 112 BC and ended in the next year. Life Zhao Jiande was the eldest son of Zhao Yingqi and a Yue woman. Although the eldest, Jiande was passed over for kingship in preference for his half-brother, Zhao Yingqi. Han War During Zhao Xing's reign, Emperor Wu of Han sent missions to Nanyue to summon Zhao Xing to the Han court for an audience with the emperor. Xing and his mother decided to submit to the Han, but the prime minister L√º Jia (ÂëÇÂòâ), who held military power in Nanyue at that time, opposed this. Emperor Wu dispatched Han Qianqiu (ÈüìÂçÉÁßã) with 2000 soldiers to arrest L√º Jia. After hearing of these developments, L√º Jia conducted a coup d'√©tat, killing Xing and all of his supporters in 112 BC. Jiande was crowned king of Nanyue. The 2000 men led by Han Qianqiu defeated several small towns but were defeated as they neared Panyu, which greatly shocked and angered Emperor Wu. The emperor then sent an army of 100,000 to attack Nanyue. The army marched on Panyu in a multi-pronged assault. Lu Bode advanced from the Hui River and Yang Pu from the Hengpu River. Three natives of Nanyue also joined the Han. One advanced from the Li River, the second invaded Cangwu, and the third advanced from the Zangke River. In the winter of 111 BC Yang Pu captured Xunxia and broke through the line at Shimen. With 20,000 men he drove back the vanguard of the Nanyue army and waited for Lu Bode. However Lu failed to meet up on time and when he did arrive, he had no more than a thousand men. Yang reached Panyu first and attacked it at night, setting fire to the city. Panyu surrendered at dawn. Jiande and L√º Jia fled the city by boat, heading east to appeal for Minyue's aid, but the Han learned of their escape and sent the general Sima Shuang after them. Both Jiande and L√º Jia were captured and executed. Aftermath When the neighboring kingdoms of Cangwu, Xiou (Western Ou), and Luoluo heard of the fall of Nanyue, they all submitted to the Han. Their kings were made marquises. Legacy Based on many temples of L√º Jia (L·ªØ Gia), his wives, and soldiers scattering in Red River Delta of northern Vietnam, the war might have lasted until 98 BC.

He was arrested and executed by the Kuomintang (KMT) in 1928. Early life Xia was born in 1900, in Zigui County, Hubei Province to Xia Shaofan (Â§èÁªçËåÉ) and Lu Yunfeng (ÈôÜ‰∫ëÂá§). He was born in a well-educated family, and his family had been government officials for generations. His father was an officer, but died when Xia was young. Xia joined in founding Xiangnan Student Union and served as the chief secretary, leading a student movement against feudalism and imperialism. In 1920, Xia led the Xiangnan Student Union to fight against General Zhang Jingyao. Xia was a pioneer of the Chinese Communist Party. in 1922, Xia was in charge of the Hunan Student Union, leading a strike of rickshaw drivers and a boycott of Japanese products. Xia participated in many other movements such as the Autumn Harvest Uprising. At the beginning of 1928, Xia was sent to work in Hubei as the commissioner of the CPC Hubei District Committee. On March 18, he was betrayed and arrested by the Kuomintang in Wuhan. He was executed two days later. Xia Minghan and Mao Zedong In 1917, Xia attended the Third Provincial Public Industrial School in Hunan province. With the help of He Suheng, he went to Changsha, and became a student of Mao Zedong in 1920. He was inducted into the CPC by Mao Zedong and He Shuheng In 1921. In 1927, he was Mao's secretary. Revolutionary movement Xia became a committeeman of the Hunan Branch of the CPC in 1924. In 1927, Xia was made a member of the newly formed Hunan Provincial Committee along with Mao Zedong. The committee's two main purposes were to decide who should own land and how the Autumn Harvest Uprising should take place, if at all. The committee met in August 1927. Xia's view on land ownership was that \\"all land must be confiscated and placed under state control.\\" Xia thought the uprising should take place, but with the military and peasants. In the beginning of 1928, Xia was transferred to Hubei to be the commissioner of the CPC Hubei District Committee. On 28 March 1928, he was arrested by the Kuomintang in Wuhan. He was killed by the KMT two days later. Death  Xia Minghan and wife Zheng Jiajun Early in 1928, Xia Minghan was transferred to Hubei Province, as a member of Hubei Provincial Committee of CPC, and worked with Guo Liang, the newly appointed secretary of Hubei Provincial Committee. Betrayed by a traitor, on March 18, Xia Minghan was arrested in Wuhan. Two days later, in the morning of March 20, he was escorted to the Wuhan-Yuji execution ground. He was survived by his wife, Zheng Jiajun () and his daughter, Xia Yun (). Before his execution, he wrote his last poem: Translation: Beheading is nothing to me, A true communist who'd be. Though you kill Xia Minghan today, Numerous will follow my way. Legacy On 10 September 2009, he was voted to be one of the 100 heroes who made significant contribution to the establishment of the People's Republic of China.

Acacia leiocalyx (black wattle, early flowering black wattle, lamb's tail wattle, curracabah) grows in Queensland, Australia and as far south as Sydney. It is widespread and common in eucalypt woodlands, especially on well-drained, shallow soils. It is short- lived and grows 6‚Äì7 metres (20‚Äì23 ft.) tall, with a trunk about 180 mm (7 inches) in diameter.Acacia leiocalyx (Early flowering wattle). www.ttit.id.au/treepagesAcacia leiocalyx World Wide Wattle Description A small Acacia tree with furrowed bark; sickle-shaped green leaves with prominent veins, the bottom two joined near the base. Flowers yellow, in narrow spikes. Narrow, rather curly pods in loose bunches. It usually flowers June to October.NSW PlantNet: Acacia leiocalyx Taxonomy There were several closely related trees which used to all come under the name of Acacia cunninghamii, but have been now identified as a number of separate species. The Acacia cunninghamii 'group' all have spiky inflorescences and large phyllodes. They are closely interrelated and taxonomically 'difficult' species, and are often confused and poorly defined.Acacia leiocalyx: Look for diagnosis A. leiocalyx is most closely related to Acacia concurrens, but the differences between the two species are subtle. In A. leiocalyx the small branches are smooth, sharply angular and usually red-brown, the pulvinus is short and red, and the calyx is hairless, or almost so. A. concurrens, on the other hand, has stouter, angular branchlets which are scaly and usually not distinctly reddish, a long grey-green pulvinus, and calyces with a few stiff short hairs towards their base. Some intermediates or hybrids between the two species occur in northern N.S.W. It is also related to Acacia crassa. Two subspecies are recognised: Acacia leiocalyx (Domin) Pedley subsp. leiocalyx and Acacia leiocalyx subsp. herveyensis\\" Pedley, Austrobaileya 1: 180 (1978) A. leiocalyx flowers and foliage Distribution \\"The species includes many different forms which are widespread in Queensland from the coast to more than 325 km inland, mostly on stony or gravelly soils. It is eaten by livestock in times of scarcity but is not of major importance as a drought fodder (Everist, 1969).\\"Atlas of Living Australia (ALA): Acacia leiocalyx Distribution Uses The timber is colourful but splits easily even with the end grain sealed. The seeds and gum are apparently edible, but caution should be taken - especially as there are so many difficult to identify similar species.Acacia leiocalyx: Noosa's Native Plants References External links *Australian Plant Name Index *A. leiocalyx World Wide Wattle website. *For Photo - Australian Plant Image *International Plant Name Index. leiocalyx Flora of New South Wales Flora of Queensland ","title":"Acacia leiocalyx"},{"id":"31512838","text":"The fourth season of iCarly began airing on Nickelodeon July 30, 2010, and ended on June 11, 2011.

In November of this season, the iCarly crew accidentally starts a fan war at WebiCon over who should date, Carly and Freddie (Creddie), or Sam and Freddie (Seddie). Despite the three confirming that none of them are dating, the fan war still seemingly remains unresolved. However, five months later, the three complete their two-month search for an intern for iCarly, at which point Sam ‚Äî much to Carly's and Freddie's confusion and suspiciousness ‚Äî begins hanging out with Freddie and Brad, the new intern, every time she gets the chance to. When Freddie tests his selfmade \\"MoodFace\\" app on Sam, it confirms that she is actually in love. Thinking that Sam still hates Freddie, he and Carly misunderstand the results, believing that Sam is in love with Brad, and Carly takes great steps into proving this. Sam still tries to convince her that she is not in love with him though. Freddie later finds Sam in the school yard and gives her a heart-to-heart talk about opening up and taking a risk when it comes to romantic feelings, not realizing that he is actually referring to himself. In the middle of the talk, Sam grabs Freddie and kisses him passionately, revealing that in fact he is the one she is in love with, as a shocked Carly watches through the window.

It became part of the W3C Recommendation on 28 October 2014. This feature is in the process of being removed from the Web platform. Using any of the offline Web application features at this time is highly discouraged and use of service workers is recommended instead. Background Web applications consist of web pages that need to be downloaded from a network. For this to happen there must be a network connection. However, there are many instances when users cannot connect to a network due to circumstances beyond their control. HTML5 provides the ability to access the web application even without a network connection using the cache manifest. Web applications consist of resources identified by URLs. These can be HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images or any other source that is required for a web application to be rendered. Their addresses can be copied into a manifest file, which can be updated regularly by the author of the web application, indicating any new web addresses that are added or deleted. When connecting to a network for the first time, a web browser will read the HTML5 manifest file, download the resources given and store them locally. Then, in the absence of a network connection, the web browser will shift to the local copies instead and render the web application offline.  Basics  In order for the offline applications to work, a cache manifest file must be created by the web developer. If the web application exceeds more than one page then each page must have a manifest attribute that points to the cache manifest. Every page referencing the manifest will be stored locally. The cache manifest file is a text file located in another part of the server. It must be served with content type \`text/cache-manifest\` The attribute \`manifest=\\"\\"\` must be added to the html element in order for the cache manifest file to work. Example: ‚Ä¶ The argument to the manifest attribute is a relative or absolute path to the manifest file. Consider the HTML file given below. The element indicates a file named cache.appcache will contain the list of resources (i.e., test.js, test.css) needed for this web page to work offline. Common names for this file are cache.manifest and manifest.appcache. Testing the manifest file.  Syntax  The manifest file must start with the line \`CACHE MANIFEST\`. Comments start with a \`#\`, spaces and blank lines are ignored. Given below is an example of a cache manifest file. Example 1: CACHE MANIFEST /test.css /test.js /test.png This manifest file lists three resources: a CSS file, a JavaScript file and a PNG image. When the above file is loaded, the browser will download the test.css, test.js and test.png files from the root directory in the web server. As a result, whenever one's network is not connected, the resources will be available to them offline. Cache manifests can also use relative paths or even absolute URLs as shown below. Example 2: CACHE MANIFEST /main/features.js /main/settings/index.css http://files/images/scene.jpg http://files/images/world.jpg  File headers  The cache manifest file consists of three section headers. # Explicit section with the header CACHE. # Online whitelist section with the header NETWORK. # Fallback section with the header FALLBACK. Note: Example 1 and Example 2 above, do not indicate any section header and are therefore considered an explicit section by default. = Online whitelist section with the header NETWORK = Example 3: CACHE MANIFEST NETWORK: /checking.cgi CACHE: /test.css /test.js /test.png This example consists of headers. The line, NETWORK: is the start of the \\"online whitelist\\" section. The resources listed under this section are never cached and are not available offline. As a result, an error will occur when an attempt is made offline to load the resource. There is a shift to the explicit section by the header CACHE: and the resources (the CSS stylesheet, JavaScript and the image file) can be downloaded and used offline. = Fallback section with the header FALLBACK = The fallback section in a cache manifest file can be used to substitute online resources that cannot be cached or were not cached successfully. Example 4: CACHE MANIFEST FALLBACK: / /offline.html NETWORK: ‚Ä¶ In Example 4, the fallback section consists of a single line. i.e., / /offline.html. The single character (/) before ‚Äòoffline‚Äô will match any URL pattern on one's site. If the browser does not find the page in the appcache, the application will display the page /offline.html.

Suggested Furu languages are: :Bikya (Furu), Bishuo, Busuu, ?Lubu Word lists for the first three languages were compiled by Michel Dieu, but after his death they were apparently lost. His lexicostatistical calculations were published in Breton (1993, 1995). Roland Kiessling revisited the remote area in 2007, and was able to show that they are normal Bantoid languages; they may perhaps be Beboid (Blench 2011).

It is considered one of the largest churches in South Korea. The former South Korean President, Lee Myung- bak, also serves as the elder of this church. Relationship with the Lee Myung-bak Government The Somang Presbyterian Church is Lee Myung-bak's main source of socio-political connections. Many prominent figures of the Lee Myung-bak government attend the Somang Presbyterian Church. Controversies On January 3, 2011, three ministers fought violently inside the church allegedly due to their conflicting theological differences. This resulted in a facial injury to the head minister. It is later revealed that the two subordinate ministers were threatened that they couldn't assign time slots to their service. There had been two more violent incidents before this. Choi Seung-ho, the producer of MBC's investigative journalist program called PD Notebook was suddenly replaced by another staff on early March 2011 after investigating the Somang Presbyterian Church. There were concerns whether the South Korean President Lee Myung-bak was involved in this censorship-like action. The staffs from MBC criticized this action as \\"an intention to purge the journalists who are pursuing critical investigative journalism\\" and took actions against it. The producer of KBS's investigative journalist program called Chujeok 60 Bun was also later found out that was suddenly appointed to the International Department to stop any investigation towards the church. On April 8, 2011, a former subordinate minister of Somang Presbyterian Church was arrested for banking fraud. Park Tae-kyu, the representative lobbyist of Busan Savings Bank, once affiliated with the Somang Presbyterian Church. Park Tae- kyu was responsible for bribing the now-resigned Senior Secretary of Public Relations of the Blue House, Kim Du-woo.
