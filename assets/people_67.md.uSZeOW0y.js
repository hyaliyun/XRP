The Chicago Christmas Tree is the city of Chicago's official Christmas tree. It is located in Millennium Park. Historically, the tree was located in Grant Park and Daley Plaza. History The Chicago Christmas Tree in December 2012. The first official Christmas tree in the city of Chicago was installed in 1913 in Grant Park and lit on Christmas Eve by then-mayor Carter Harrison. This first tree was a tall spruce tree. In December 1956 the official tree, though still installed in Grant Park (at Michigan Avenue and Congress Parkway), was not an individual tree. The tree was a combination of many smaller trees, stood tall, and was decorated with over 4000 lights and 2000 ornaments. Beginning with Christmas 1966 the official Chicago Christmas tree was placed in Civic Center Plaza, now known as Daley Plaza. With the exception of 1981, the tree was installed in Daley Plaza each year until 2015. The city continued to use multiple trees to constitute the official Chicago Christmas Tree through Christmas 2008, that year the tree was constructed from 113 individual trees and stood . Following a report from CBS 2 in Chicago which revealed the erection of the frame and construction of the tree cost the city $300,000, the city decided to do away with the multiple trees and erect an individual tree in Daley Plaza.\\"Christmas Tree Lighting Kicks Off in Daley Plaza\\", CBS 2, November 24, 2010, accessed December 15, 2010. This was billed as a way to save the city money during the economic recession. The 2009 Daley Plaza Christmas tree was an individual tree donated by a family in Palos Heights, Illinois. The 2009 tree cost was reduced by more than half of the $300,000 the 2008 tree cost to erect, decorate and maintain. Because the 2009 tree was just one tree, as opposed to multiple smaller trees, it could not support the weight of the many ornaments that usually adorn the Daley Plaza tree and thus it was decorated only with lights. In 2010, for the first time, the Daley Plaza Christmas tree was chosen through a contest.\\" The contest began in July 2010 but the deadline was extended after none of the original submissions met the height requirement. The contest winner was decided based on the results of an online poll. Chosen from three finalists, the winning tree, donated by a McHenry, Illinois family, received 2,678 votes out of 5,182. For 2015, the Chicago Christmas Tree was moved to a new location in Millennium Park. Description The official Chicago Christmas tree has varied in height from the spruce used in 1913 to the tree used in 2008. The contest rules in 2010 laid out a number of prerequisites that were required of the winning tree. The winning tree had to be at least tall, the tree chosen measured , and had to be a spruce or fir tree as pine trees were deemed not sturdy enough. In addition the tree had to be found within of the Chicago Loop and in a location that it could safely be removed from. The tree used in 2010 was decorated with 7000 LED lights and the tree topper was a lighted star. The fir used in 2010 weighed in at .

Moore in a paper published in 1945.Davis, Kingsley and Wilbert E. Moore. (1970 [1945]). \\"Some principles of stratification.\\" American Sociological Review, 10 (2), 242-9. The hypothesis is an attempt to explain social stratification. As a structural functionalist theory, it is also associated with Talcott Parsons and Robert K. Merton. Argument The hypothesis is an attempted explanation of social stratification, based on the idea of \\"functional necessity\\". Davis and Moore argue that the most difficult jobs in any society are the most necessary and require the highest rewards and compensation to sufficiently motivate individuals to fill them. Once the roles are filled, the division of labour functions properly, based on the notion of organic solidarity advanced by Emile Durkheim. Criticism This argument has been criticized as fallacious from a number of different angles.De Maio, F. (2010). Health & Social Theory. New York: Palgrave MacMillan, 29-30. The first problem is that they posit rewards as a guarantee of performance, when rewards are supposed to be based on merit in their argument. It is argued that if abilities were inherent, there would be no need of a reward system. Secondly, Davis and Moore do not clearly indicate why some positions should be worth more than others, other than the fact that they are remunerated more, claiming, for example, that teachers are equally, if not more, functionally necessary than athletes and movie stars, yet, they receive significantly lower incomes. These critics have suggested that structural inequality (inherited wealth, family power, etc.), is itself a cause of individual success or failure, rather than a consequence of it.Tumin, M. M. (1953). \\"Some principles of stratification: a critical analysis.\\" American Sociological Review, 18, 387-97. Class analysts point out that it is not merely income that determines inequality but wealth, access to social networks, and cultural practices that put some individuals in better positions than others to succeed.The New York Times.

Biography  Born in Korçë, in the Manastir Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire in 1876. Dako later migrated to Bucharest, Romania, where he finished high school and later the Faculty of Mathematics. Dako was also a student of literature at Bucharest University. Though he had studied mathematics, Dako's passion was in ancient history. He was the strong supporter of the thesis that Albanians are descendants of the ancient Illyrians, Epirotes, and Macedonians, one of the pillars of Albanian Nationalism. While in Bucharest Dako along with Aleksandër Stavre Drenova founded Qarku i studentëvet shqiptarë (Circle of Albanian students) in 1899 and by March 1902 had become the Shpresa (Hope) Society consisting of young nationalists that aimed to enlighten Albanians on the national question. Dako represented Shpresa at the Congress of the Subjugated People of Turkey held in Vienna, 1902 and presented proposals relating to the creation of Albanian schools, Albanian language liturgy being conducted in Orthodox churches, and release of all political prisoners. Dako was the husband of Sevasti Qiriazi, Albanian patriot and pioneer of female education in Albania, from the well known Kyrias () family of Monastir. The couple met in Bucharest, and moved to the US in 1907. Dako pursued there a degree in philosophy. He is remembered for initiating and opening the first Albanian school in US in 1908, located in Natick, MA. Petro Nini Luarasi taught there between others. Dako returned shortly in Albania in June 1911, right in the middle of the Albanian Revolt of 1911, together with Charles Richard Crane of Chicago. There he would be imprisoned for a short time due to his nationalistic activities. He was released afternoon with Crane's intervention, and his persecutor Şevket Turgut Pasha immediately removed from the Ottoman authorities. Charles Crane would become one of the few lobbyists of Albania at that time, allegedly managing to influence the American government on lobbying for Albania towards the British during the London Conference of 1912–13. Monastir, 1911 An editor of the Dielli magazine and chairman of Vatra, the Pan-Albanian Federation of America in 1913. In 1914, he shortly visited his home town in Albania. Due to later divergences with Fan Noli, he partly retired from Vatra. In 1918 he would join the \\"Albanian Political Party\\" (Albanian: Partia Politike Shqiptare). In 1916, he published the short-lived (8 issues) newspaper Bilioteka Zeri i Shqiperise (\\"Voice of Albania Library\\") in Southbrigde, MA. Dako later participated in the Paris Peace Conference, 1919. He met twice with then United States president Woodrow Wilson, and explained to him the Albanian national aspirations. Dako also became minister of education in one of Ahmet Zogu's cabinets. Apparently Zogu showed respect for Dako, and shortly met him in the eve of the Italian Invasion of 1939, asking for US support through Dako's connections. Because of this affiliation, Dako's name would be thrown in darkness during the communist regime of post WWII. His family would be persecuted (including his sister in law Parashqevi) and two sons would be arrested and imprisoned. Probably the most important achievement of Dako is the founding of the Higher Institute of Girls \\"Qiriazi\\", in Korçë and later in Kamëz, Tiranë. Works *Cilet jane Chqipetaret?

Early life  Mustafa was an Albanian and born in Avlonya (modern Vlorë in Albania) in 1592.History page of Yıldızeli mayor He was an officer in the Janissary corps.

On 24 December 1638, after the death of the former grand vizier Tayyar Mehmet Pasha during the siege, Sultan Murad IV appointed Kemankeş Mustafa as the new grand vizier, the highest post of the empire next to that of the sultan.  As a grand vizier  Baghdad was conquered the next day, and Kemankeş Mustafa represented the Ottoman side in the consequent peace talks.

Set in the American Revolutionary War, the novel follows Lionel Lincoln, a Boston-born American of British noble descent who goes to England and returns a British soldier, and is forced to deal with the split loyalties in his family and friends to the American colonies and the British homeland. At the end of the novel, he returns to England with his wife Cecil, another American born cousin. The novel was originally conceived as part of a 13 volume series of historical novels by Cooper; however, he was generally dissatisfied with his work as a historical novelist. Both contemporary and modern critics regard the novel as one of the poorest novels written by Cooper. Background After the success of The Spy: A Tale of the Neutral Ground, The Pioneers, and The Pilot: A Tale of the Sea, Cooper intended to try his hand at historical fiction with a series of 13 novels called Legends of the Thirteen Republics, wishing to reflect on the role of each colony in the revolution in each novel. However, Lionel Lincoln was the first and last of the novels to be written and published. Generally, Cooper was disappointed with the reception of his novel by the American audience and dissatisfied with his first attempt at historical fiction. Plot  Characters  = List = * Lionel Lincoln – British Major, Protagonist of the novel, Said to be Mrs. Pray’s son. * Sir Lionel Lincoln – Father of Lionel Lincoln, who is in asylum, due to the cunningness of his relatives * Ralph – Strange and Moody Old Man * Job Prey – Simple minded boy, retarded son * Mrs. Priscilla Lechmere – Lincoln’s Great Aunt * Abigail Prey – Job Pray’s Mother and Friend of Mrs. Pricilla * Cecil Dynevor – Pricilla’s Grand Daughter, Mother of Agnes Danforth * Agnes Danforth – Great-niece of Mrs. Priscilla Lechmere, Daughter of Cecil Dynevor * Colonel Dynevor – Father Agnes Danforth. * Captain Peter Polwarth – Good Natured Man, Friend of Lincoln * M’Fuse – Friend of Lincoln, Professional Soldier who interested in warfare. * Seth Sage – Landlord * General Gage – Commander in Chief * General Clinton * General Burgoyne * Rev. Dr. Liturgy – Anglican Rector of King’s Chapel  Analysis  Both Lionel Lincoln and his eventual American bride, Cecil, come from British Aristocratic families. For the American audience and for Cooper, such nobility represented the corrupt and promiscuous British nobility. Though the novel was supposed to be about American republicanism and the praising the American revolution, the titular character Lincoln and his wife return to Britain at the end of the war.Woolf 36-37 One major theme is whether Lincoln will in fact be moved to join the American cause. Throughout the novel, he is repeatedly given arguments of reason to favour the American cause over the British. But as critic Donald Donnell points out, the obstinate loyalty to the King which results in Lincoln's return to England at the end of the war, seems to be a deliberately negative trait with which Cooper endows many of Loyalist characters. In his dissertation, Paul Jonathan Woolf examines the effect the decision for these aristocratic characters to leave the United States at the end of the novel: > Arguably, though, Cooper wrote himself into a corner. To keep Lionel and > Cecil in America would have had disturbing implications. If Lionel and > Cecil, whose own branch of the Lincoln family is tainted by her > grandmother’s diabolical scheming, remained in America, the new nation would > not be rid of what Cooper depicts as the endemic insanity, sexual deviancy > and deceit of the English aristocracy. Furthermore, to invest in Lionel and > Cecil the leadership of the new republic would raise some unsettling > political questions... for Cecil and Lionel to become leaders in the United > States would surely risk blurring the line between natural and titled > aristocracy; they would here be one and the same.Woolf 37. =Genre= Joseph Steinbrink called Lionel Lincoln Cooper's \\"first and ultimately his only strict attempt at historical fiction\\". According to Steinbrink, Cooper was one of the few early American authors who appreciated the early history of the United States, and saw that the American Revolution was really the gem which Americans could enjoy, if there were to be historical novels. However, the generally poor reception of the novel by contemporaries led to Cooper being dissatisfied with the genre of historical fiction, believing that the American literary audience was not yet ready to explore the Historical fiction genre. According to Steinbrink, however, the novel's failure resulted from Cooper's inability to integrate character and plot development into the history of the American Revolution. =King Lear= Scholar W.B. Gates strongly links the plot of Lionel Lincoln to that \\"King Lear,\\" emphasizing the similarity between Lionel Lincoln's plot and that surrounding the Duke Gloucester. He compares the plot of the two: > Both Lionel Lincoln and the Gloucester plot involve a distinguished > gentleman who has an illegitimate son; in the play the son (Edmund) proves > to be a villain; in the novel the son (Job Pray) proves to be a half-witted > creature who embodies many of the traits of Lear's Fool. Similarly to the > Fool, he attaches himself to a man whom he likes but whom he chides > unmercifully (Major Lincoln, his half-brother). In each story, the > distinguished gentleman later has a legitimate son of noble character whom > circumstances place in opposition to his father. In the play, Edgar is > wrongly accused of plotting against his father and is forced to flee; in the > novel, Major Lincoln is a British officer, whereas his father is an ardent > (though mad) supporter of the colonists. Critical reception Contemporary critics of Cooper had a decidedly negative reception of Lionel Lincoln. American writer John Neal was very disappointed: \\"It is not such a book, as we might have, and shall have, we do hope yet; a brave, hearty, original book, brimful of descriptive truth-of historical and familiar truth; crowded with real American character; alive with American peculiarities; got up after no model, however excellent; wove [sic] to no pattern, however beautiful; in imitation of nobody, however great.\\" To Neal, Lionel Lincoln was an unrealistic imitation of the Scottish historical novelist Sir Walter Scott, and was completely unsatisfactory. Modern critic Joseph Steinbrink points out that the historical retelling of battles and events by Cooper is very good, but that this is obscured by both a very weak character of Lionel Lincoln and too much \\"gothicism and sentimentality\\". Steinbrink suggests that Cooper may have concentrated too hard on researching the historical information, rendering the art of storytelling unduly hard, because the knowledge of the American Revolution didn't come naturally to him.

The Committee's report suggested 6 options of which options 1 through 4 were advised to be not feasible. The Fifth option is to bifurcate the State into Telangana with Hyderabad as its capital and Seemandhra which is to have a new capital city. The Committee noted that \\"Separation is recommended only in case it is unavoidable and if this decision can be reached amicably amongst all the three regions.\\" (Page 454) The Sixth and the option that the Committee recommended as the \\"way forward\\" is to keep the state and \\"establishment of a statutory and empowered Telangana Regional Council with adequate transfer of funds, functions and functionaries in keeping with the spirit of Gentlemen's Agreement of 1956\\" (Page 454) The six options presented in the report were as follows: #Maintaining Status Quo – Keeping the Andhra Pradesh State as it is with no change in the Telangana, Rayalaseema and Coastal Andhra regions. #Bifurcating the state of Andhra Pradesh into Seemandhra and Telangana regions with both of them developing their own capitals in due course of time. Hyderabad to be converted to a Union Territory – This proposal was similar to the Punjab-Haryana-Chandigarh model. #Dividing Andhra Pradesh into two states – One of Rayala-Telangana with Hyderabad as its capital and second one of the Coastal Andhra Pradesh #Dividing Andhra Pradesh into Seemandhra and Telangana with enlarged Hyderabad Metropolis as a separate Union Territory that will be linked geographically to district Guntur in coastal Andhra via Nalgonda district in the southeast and via Mahboobnagar district in the south to Kurnool district in Rayalaseema #Bifurcation of the State into Telangana and Seemandhrâ as per existing boundaries with Hyderabad as the capital of Telangana and Seemandhra to have a new capital. #Keeping the State united and providing for creation of a statutorily empowered Telangana Regional Council for socio-economic development and political development of Telangana region. Findings #The SKC remarked that \\"It is a fact that most of the economic and developmental parameters show that Telangana (excluding Hyderabad) is either on par with or a shade lower than coastal Andhra; but once Hyderabad is included, the situation in Telangana is far better.\\" (2.15.03 on Page 119) #In comparison with the Rayalaseema region, the SKC remarked that \\"Thus, on the whole, it would appear that the deprived region is Rayalaseema not Telangana\\" (2.15.03 on Page 119) #Overall, in spite of 50-plus years of policy protected planning and execution, one finds regional variations in the economic development of AP. The rate of growth in the development parameters summed up below is found to be robust both in Telangana (even after excluding Hyderabad) and coastal Andhra. (p. 118). #The SKC noted that the Planning Commission had notified as backward nine of the ten Telangana districts, with the exception of Hyderabad, and resources have been allocated under its Backward Region Grant Fund (BRGF). These districts contain, as the SKC says, 87% of the population of Telangana. (p. 81) #Considering the allegation that \\"Telangana has lower per capita income, lower access to employment, lower business opportunities and low access to education and so on\\", SKC says, \\"At the outset, some or all such allegations appear true when absolute amounts, numbers and percentages are reviewed\\" (p. 117). #\\"The implementation of G.O. 610 during 1975 to 2005 was, at best, tardy, which remains a grievance of Telangana employees. This issue continues to be highly contentious even today (p.48).\\" Girglani Report on GO. 610 estimated 140,000 Telangana jobs diverted to Seemandhra persons. However SKC noted in para 5.29.01, only 18,856 employees are identified in total by Girglani commission and 14,784 employees are already repatriated to their native Zones. Most of the violations are in education and health departments due to shortage of qualified people from the local zones. There are also violations from zone 6 to zone 5 and vice versa which are part of Telangana area. #\\"However, the data received from the State Government shows (Appendix 3.16) that the combined amount released to government and aided colleges together is Rs. 930 million in Telangana while it is 2.24 billion in coastal Andhra (with college-going population similar to that in Telangana) and 910 million in Rayalaseema (with population share being less than half that in Telangana)\\" (p. 153). #\\"The real income of the agricultural wage labourers has declined considerably in Telangana whereas it has increased considerably in coastal Andhra region. Similarly, the SCs, STs and minorities in Telangana region have suffered a decline in income during the past about decade or more, whereas these communities have gained substantially in Coastal Andhra (p.119)\\". #\\"Although as a sub-regional movement, the Telangana movement does not pose a threat to national unity\\" (p. 344). #\\"The Telangana movement can be interpreted as a desire for greater democracy and empowerment within a political unit. As stated earlier, sub-regionalism is a movement, which is not necessarily primordial but is essentially modern – in the direction of a balanced and equitable modernisation. Our analysis shows that cutting across caste, religion, gender and other divisions, the Telangana movement brings a focus on the development of the region as a whole, a focus on rights and access to regional resources and, further, it pitches for a rights-based development perspective whereby groups and communities put forth their agendas within a larger vision of equitable development\\" (p. 415). #\\"However, given the long-standing history of the demand for a separate State, the deep penetration of the sense of grievance and the widespread emotion around the issue, unless genuine steps are taken to address both real and perceived disparities, the demand is unlikely to go away permanently even if it is subdued temporarily\\" (p. 417). #\\"Thus, from the point of view of sheer size of economy, Telangana as a new State can sustain itself both with and without Hyderabad. The other combination of regions – coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema together can also sustain themselves as a State; in fact, they can also sustain themselves separately\\" (p. 121). #\\"In view of the complex background of the situation and the rather serious and sensitive emotional aspects involved, the Committee is of the unanimous view that it would not be practical to simply maintain the status quo in respect of the situation\\" (p. 442). #\\"Given the above first hand observations of the Committee during its tours of the regions, the Committee feels that the issue of sentiment has to be considered only as one among several factors to be evaluated. While not discounting people's wishes or sentiments, the overall implications of bifurcation (or trifurcation as the case may be) have to be carefully delineated to arrive at a responsible recommendation\\"(p. 352–353). #\\"The Committee is of the view that given the long history of the demand for a separate Telangana, the highly charged emotions at present and the likelihood of the agitation continuing in case the demand is not met (unless handled deftly, tactfully and firmly as discussed under option six), consideration has to be given to this option. The grievances of the people of Telangana, such as non-implementation of some of the key decisions included in the Gentleman's Agreement (1956), certain amount of neglect in implementation of water and irrigation schemes, inadequate provision for education infrastructure (excluding Hyderabad), and the undue delay in the implementation of the Presidential order on public employment, etc., have contributed to the felt psyche of discrimination and domination, with the issue attaining an emotional pitch. The continuing demand, therefore, for a separate Telangana, the Committee felt, has some merit and is not entirely unjustified\\" (p. 453). #\\"Therefore, after taking into account all the pros and cons, the Committee did not think it to be the most preferred, but the second best, option. Separation is recommended only in case it is unavoidable and if this decision can be reached amicably amongst all the three regions\\" (p. 453). # The delay in the formation of Telangana will create Political crisis and the Maoist movement is likely to get a fillip in such a situation(page 411) Criticism Telangana leaders rejected the recommendations of the Sri Krishna committee report and insisted on the formation of a different Telangana State with Hyderabad as its capital.Clashes continue in Osmania University, protests rock Telangana Pro-Telangana student protesters set an APSRTC bus and a police vehicle on fire, and broke windowpanes of at least eight buses. They hurled stones, forcing police to use teargas to disperse the mobs. The stone throwing resulted in injuries to many policemen, including an Additional DCP (District Commissioner of Police). Some activists also damaged the statue of Potti Sriramulu at Vanasthalipuram junction in Hyderabad after alleged remarks by Ongole MP on KCR. Criticism of the Sri Krishna Committee report includes that it compared regions (Seema-Andhra vs Telangana), not people (Seema-Andhrites vs Telanganites). The State government did not or could not provide all the data the committee asked for; they had only 10 years worth of data. The Telangana JAC steering committee, comprising experts from different fields, studied the Sri Krishana Committee report and came to the conclusion that the report was a \\" bunch of lies\\", while proponents of the United State Movement, including Samaikhya Andhra JAC and the Praja Rajyam party, welcomed the recommendations of the committee. Economist and former Planning Commission member C. H. Hanumantha Rao said that the Srikrishna Committee's recommendations are at variance with its own analysis. He said the committee did not study the reasons for the failures of earlier protections, and how future protections will do justice to Telangana. He said that even while the committee's own analysis and data supports the formation of an independent Telangana, it only recommended this as the second-best option.Srikrishna Committee on Telangana: Recommendations at Variance with the Analysis – C. H Hanumanth Rao Protests in Telangana continue in the form of strikes, hunger strikes, suicides, giving petitions and roses to public officials, and the boycotting of public events. The state government's RacchaBanda program (which promises social benefits for everyone) in Telangana has been obstructed by protesters and had to be conducted by using the police, who used preventative arrests and other measures. In some areas, the programme had to be cancelled due to uncontrollable protests. Telangana proponents boycotted this program, saying it was intended to dilute the pro-Telangana agitation. KCR, in a meeting in Hyderabad, said \\"Sherwani, qubani (a sweet made of dates) and biryani are what we in Hyderabad have known for ages. People from Andhra who came here without even footwear are claiming that they have taught us how to make biryani\\" and allegedly remarked that Andhra Biryani tasted like cow dung. This triggered protests across the state. A movie called Jai Bolo Telangana based on the Telangana movement received censor clearance only after protests by Telangana supporters. Journalist Kuldip Nayar said that if the state is divided, development will take a back seat. He remarked that Andhra Pradesh could achieve rapid economic growth only if it remains united. Yoga guru Baba Ramdev supported the demand for a separate Telangana state and warned the centre that the movement may turn violent if there is a delay in the formation of the state. Another Hindu guru, Chinna Jeeyar Swamy, supported the Telangana demand when his stance was sought by some students. 8th Chapter of Sri Krishna committee Report In January, a petition was filed pleading to declare the Committee Report as 'invalid' since it did not make public the contents of the eighth chapter of its report, which deals with the law and order situation. The Attorney General of India arguing the case said that the Report was only a committee submitting its advice and the Union government was not obliged to act on its recommendation. The central government submitted that the contents would not be made public since it was a privileged document under Sections 123 and 124 of the Indian Evidence Act of 1872. On 17 February, the justice hearing this case said \\"It is unfortunate that this report and its related exercise was presided over by a former judge of the Supreme Court... this committee has spent Rs 400 million of public money for preparing its report. Any person with a semblance of faith in the system of democracy would lose faith in it. The report prepared by the front office of an MP would have been more sensible than this report. Even the high command of a political party would have hesitated to prepare such a report\\"Srikrishna report full of blatant lies: HC judge On 23 March, Justice L Narasimha Reddy of Andhra Pradesh high court ordered central government to make public the contents of 8th chapter of Sri Krishna Committee, which was submitted in a sealed secret cover to the centre. Justice in his 60 page judgement said \\"The Committee went beyond the terms of reference in its endeavour to persuade the Union of India not to accede to the demand for Telangana\\". SKC secret report as quoted in paras 68–72, argued against Telangana state while discussing communal violence, Maoist violence and social tensions. The supplementary note to secret report has three parts, .. *\\"a) Political management: Action also needs to be initiated for softening the TRS to the extent possible .. Inputs indicate that this agitation can be tackled if Congress Leaders do not give an impression indicating any covert / overt support to it. Hence the Congress MPs / MLAs need to be taken into confidence and asked not to lend any form of support to the agitation. The Congress High Command must sensitise its own MPs and MLAs and educate them about the wisdom for arriving at an acceptable and workable solution. With the ruling party and main opposition party (for Telangana demand) being brought on the same page, the support mechanisms have a higher probability of becoming successful.\\"(para 75) *\\"b) Media Management: ..Andhra Pradesh has got about 13 Electronic Channels and 5 major local Newspapers which are in the forefront of moulding the public opinion. Except for two Channels (Raj News & hmtv), the rest of them are supporters of a united Andhra Pradesh. The equity holders of the channels except the above two and the entire Print Media are with the Seemandhra people. The main editors/resident and sub-editors, the Film world etc. are dominated by Seemandhra people. A coordinated action on their part has the potential of shaping the perception of the common man. ..In the Print Media all major Newspapers are owned by Seemandhra people and the Regional contents published by them play a vital role. .. The editorial opinions, the banner headlines, the Regional content, the District editions need to be managed ..\\" (para 80). \\"The print media is hugely dependent on the Government for advertisement revenue and if carefully handled can be an effective tool to achieve this goal\\". (para 91) * c) Full preparedness: As under each of the options there is a high possibility of agitational backlash, notwithstanding the actions taken in advance as suggested in (a) and (b) above, an appropriate plan of deployment grid of police force (both Central and State) with full technical support needs to be immediately drawn up. ..The likely troubled spots (e.g. Osmania, Kakatiya, Krishna Devraya Universities etc.) and the trouble creators in the three regions must be identified in advance and suitable action plan prepared. In my discussions with Chief Secretary and DGP, the kind of equipment and weaponry to be used were also discussed and it was agreed that weaponry used should be such as not to cause fatal injuries, while at the same time effective enough to bring the agitationists quickly under control. \\"(para 94) Justice said (in para 96) \\"If the committee has suggested use of arsenal of lesser degree, it is not because there is any pity or sympathy towards the agitators. Obviously, it is to avoid the wrath of the human rights agencies\\". The justice further said(in para 103) \\"The maneuver suggested by the Committee in its secret supplementary note poses an open challenge, if not threat, to the very system of democracy. If the source of inputs that gave rise to this is the Government, it (the Government) owes an explanation to the citizens. If, on the other hand, the origin of inputs is elsewhere, the Government must move in the right earnest to pluck and eradicate such foul source and thereby prove its respect for, and confidence in, the democracy.\\" Telangana JAC and Telangana leaders from all political parties demanded prosecution of Sri Krishna Committee members. On 26 April, a division bench comprising the Chief Justice of the AP high court has stayed the order of Justice L Narasimha Reddy who had directed the Centre to make public the secret Chapter.

Ambrose Bierce's Civilians and Soldiers in Context: A Critical Study. Kent State University Press, 2004. . P. 74.  Plot  \\"Killed at Resaca\\" begins with the narrator describing a lieutenant, Herman Brayle, he serves with during the American Civil War. Brayle, a tall man with fair features, consistently wears full uniform and never takes cover during battle. Despite being questioned for his reasoning to behave so foolishly in battles and with little regards for his safety, he never explains or changes his actions. One day when given an order to deliver a message, rather than taking a safe path to do so, Brayle charges out into an open field and is fired upon by Confederate troops. Watching his heroic figure galloping through the gunshots, the Union soldiers also put forth their own efforts to defend and battle. Even when presented with an opportunity for salvation in the form of a hiding place, Brayle awaits death with a defiant stance. After he falls, the battle is ended and Confederate soldiers assist in his removal from the field and even play a dirge. Included among the possessions of the slain hero is a letter from a woman, who writes that she had heard he hid behind a tree once during a battle, and would rather he were dead than learn that he was the sort of coward who would take cover. Bitter at the loss the letter has caused, the narrator vows to pay a visit to the woman and reveal the destruction of her words. She throws the letter into the fire because it's stained and she \\"can't stand the sight of blood\\", howevermuch she enjoyed the thought of it being shed. When she asks how Brayle died, he does not relate the story of his heroic actions.

These special conditions have given the rich fens a specialized and species rich flora, which often consists of orchids, sedges and mosses (Rydin et al. 1999). The rich fens are often classified into the categories moderately rich fen and extremely rich fen. The extremely rich fens have a higher pH and more vascular plants (Rydin et al. 1999).  Threats  Historically rich fens have been used as meadows and pastures, but the practices ceased during the 20th century (Emanuelsson 2009). Many wetland areas, among them the rich fens, were drained in the 19th and 20th century to create new agricultural land or to increase productivity in the forestry (Emanuelsson 2009). There are several other threats though, that might cause degradation and loss of rich fens such as acidification, eutrophication and overgrowth by trees and bushes because of lack of management. Habitat fragmentation is an ongoing threat that leads to reduced connectivity within the landscape. Small and isolated fragments hold in general fewer species than larger and less isolated areas. One reason is that it is more difficult for the species to disperse between the isolated fragments (Hunter et al. 2007).  References  * Emanuelsson, 2009.

The French at Quebec under Governor Frontenac wished to disrupt the negotiations and sent Claude-Sébastien de Villieu in the fall of 1693 into present-day Maine, with orders to \\"place himself at the head of the Acadian Indians and lead them against the English.\\"Webster, John Clarence.

Raid  The English settlement of Oyster River was attacked by Villieu with about 250 Abenaki Indians, composed of two main groups from the Penobscot and Norridgewock under command of their sagamore Bomazeen (or Bomoseen). A number of Maliseet from Medoctec took part in the attack. The Indian force was divided into two groups to attack the settlement, which was laid out on both sides of the Oyster River.

The city features mild winters, hot and dry summers and a monsoon season. The monsoon, though substantial in Agra, is not quite as heavy as the monsoon in other parts of India. The average monsoon rainfall during June to September is 628.6 millimeters. Agra has a reputation of being one of the hottest and the coldest towns in India. In summers the city witnesses a sudden surge in temperature and at times, mercury goes beyond the 46 °C mark in addition to a very high level of humidity. During summer, the daytime temperature hovers around 46-50 °C. Nights are relatively cooler and temperature lowers to a comfortable 30 °C. Winters are bit chilly but are the best time to visit Agra. The minimum temperature sometimes goes as low as -2 or -2.5 °C but usually hovers in the range of 6 to 8 °C.Agra Weather - Agra Climate - Agra Weather Forecast - Climate and Weather of Agra India Factors The monsoon and the Western Disturbance are the two main factors which alter the weather over Agra; otherwise, Continental air prevails for rest of the year. Like most cities of North western India, the weather and climate of Agra is extreme and subtropical in nature. Following are the main factors that influence the weather in Agra: *Western Disturbances mostly occur during the winter months and cause light to moderate showers, temperature also decreases due to it. *Southwest Monsoon occurs in summer from the month of June till September. Monsoon rains bring much awaited relief from the scorching heat. These monsoon rains are quite heavy by nature and can cause significant flooding. *Continental air prevails during the period when there is no precipitation in Agra.

Currently, the total separate 3572 passenger trains are running of all railway zones of IR. History The country's first passenger train from Western India, which ran between Bombay's (now Mumbai) Bori Bunder station (Now ) and Thane on 16 April 1853, was dedicated by Lord Dalhousie. The 14-carriage train was hauled by three steam locomotives: the Sahib, Sindh, and Sultan. Travelling , the train carried 400 people. The passenger line was built and operated by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway (GIPR).It was built in broad gauge, which became the country's standard for railways. Later the country's second passenger train from Eastern India, which ran from Howrah (near Calcutta, now Kolkata) to Hoogly, a distance of , on 15 August 1854. The line was built and operated by the East Indian Railway Company (EIR). And After that, the country's third passenger train from Southern India, which ran from Royapuram–Veyasarapady (Madras) (now Chennai) to Wallajah Road in Arcot, a distance of , on 1 July 1856. It was built and operated by the Madras Railway. In 1897 lighting in passenger coaches was introduced by many railway companies. In 1902 the Jodhpur Railway became the first to introduce electric lights as standard fixtures. Whereas The railway budget has commissioned to the electrification of railway lines in India which also started from Bombay (now Mumbai) to spread all over India with this aim, the first electric passenger train ran from Victoria Terminus (now ) to Kurla on the Harbour Branch of Great Indian Peninsula Railway on 3rd February 1925 using 1500 V DC Overhead Traction.core.indianrailways.gov.com, Retrieved 07 July 2020 After that, In the year 1957, the First Diesel locomotive WDM-1 was introduced in India for reducing the usage of steam locomotives for goods and passenger transport. and also begins the aim of replacing steam locomotives from Indian Rails after recommendation of Karnail Singh Fuel Committee. And also that, Indian Railways began looking at various diesel-electric designs. After that 1994, The Integral Coach Factory started production of DMU's and MEMU's with aim of this for connecting minor railway stations and stops on the mainline where most express trains don't have a halt. After productions of both series, the first MEMU train was started running between Asansol and Burdwan (now Barddhaman) on 11th July 1994.irfca.org, Retrieved 07 July 2020 And later, the first DEMU train was started running between Jalandhar and Hoshiarpur on 23rd October 1994.indianexpress.com, Retrieved 07 July 2020 On 15 July 2017, The new type of Solar-Powered DEMU train was launched on the route of and of Haryana for connecting Capital of India to the small town with the aim reducing the usage of diesel and more usage of electricity for a better environment and economically.jagranjosh.com, Retrieved 07 July 2020 About With the aim of connecting small towns and cities to another, this type of trains has an important priority to Indian Railways network. Mostly these trains are unreserved coaches, for short-distance unreserved seating coaches are used and for the long-distance unreserved sleeper and seating coaches are used. Passenger trains are classified into four types: * Slow passenger trains are slow ordinary passenger trains in India. They stop at every station on the route, except abandoned ones. * Fast passenger trains are fast ordinary passenger trains in India. They skip some stops on the route, mostly less- booked ones. * Diesel Electric Multiple Unit (DEMU) are also comes in passenger trains of India. Stops at every station of the electrified and non- electrified route. * Mainline Electric Multiple Unit (MEMU) are also comes in passenger trains of India. Stops at every station only of the electrified route for connecting suburban and rural areas. In some cases, trains run as fast passengers on one section, while running as slow passengers on another section. Fast passenger trains generally run on longer routes as compared to slow passenger trains. Mostly, the number of slow and fast passenger trains has an average trip up to 300km of distance on the other hand DEMU's and MEMU's have an average trip of more than 200km of distance. =Locomotives of Passenger trains= The passenger trains are usually hauled by locomotives by WAM4, WAG5, WAG7, for electrified route and WDM-2 for non-electrified and electrified route mostly, so the attachment and detachment of locomotives are done for changing and reversing the route which is time consumable and should be the higher risk of accidents. =DEMU and MEMU= On the other hand, the DEMU's and MEMU's have two-sided engines for changing and reversing the route which is a bigger advantage on the attachment-detachment process of rakes and locomotives. On this basis, Indian Railways is progressively replacing all locomotive-hauled slow and fast passenger and intercity trains with various EMU's. After replacing with EMUs, passenger trains would be re-branded as MEMU and DEMU.

The listing included one contributing building and three contributing structures. The district dates to 1897 and includes notable Queen Anne architecture. The district includes the powerhouse, an earth embankment, a concrete non-overflow dam, and a 700-foot- long concrete gravity overflow dam. They were built in 1897–1898 by the Hudson River Power Transmission Company and span the western channel of the Hudson River between the Saratoga County shore and Bluff Island. See also: Accompanying eight photos It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. The station was designed to produce 5000 kilowatts from seven hydraulic turbine-generator units. Extensive renovations starting in 2003 have turned the plant into a working museum. Project origins and construction Robert Newton King (1846–1943), president of the Stillwell-Bierce & Smith- Vaile Company of Ohio, selected the site for its hydro potential and proximity to industrial areas of Albany, Troy and Schenectady. Hudson River Power Transmission was the company formed to develop the project. The Hudson River watershed runs to the Adirondack Mountains and covers . Construction started July 1897 but was delayed by a major storm in November; the first generator was tested in May 1898 and power delivered to the General Electric plant in July 1898. The original five turbines were completed by August 1898. Turbines and generators The initial design of the plant used seven horizontal Francis-type turbines manufactured by King's SB&SV; company, each equipped with four runners in diameter, producing 1000 HP. These turbines drove a 750 kW generator at 114 rpm. The generators produced 12,000 volts three-phase power at 38 Hz. Two exciter turbine/generators were initially installed to provide 125 V and 250 kW of DC excitation power for the main generators, but DC power has been provided by a static system for more than 50 years. Generators and controls were designed by Charles Proteus Steinmetz. Only five of the initial turbines had been completed when all seven units were replaced with new turbines in 1902. The new turbines were made by the S. Morgan Smith company and were now rated at and 125 rpm. The water passage for the turbines was modified and the operating frequency of the generators raised to 40 Hz. At the same time, a reciprocating Corliss steam engine was installed in the plant to provide supplemental capacity during low water flow; this drove the No.7 hydraulic generator through a rope drive. This was only kept for 5 years. One turbine failed in 1932 and has not been replaced. Each of the turbines has three water-lubricated lignum vitae wood bearings in the turbine chamber and an oil-bath bearing in the generator hall. Up until about 1950, the speed of the turbines was regulated by a hydraulic governor. Civil structures Exterior of the Mechanicville New York Hydroelectric plant in 1898 The project consists of a spillway feet long, an earth embankment dam about long and high, and a powerhouse. The powerhouse is wide and long, made of reinforced concrete. The horizontally mounted turbines in upstream water passages drive shafts running through packing boxes on the upstream headwall which is thick concrete. The arrangement of horizontal runners, packing box and generators was patented at the time; the layout of the station was a model for many future projects. Electrical switchgear and distribution Most of the power generated by the Mechanicville plant was sent to the General Electric plant in Schenectady. Some 40 Hz power was used locally for lighting and motors until 1949. In 1899, the Hudson River Power Company took over control of the plant from the original developers, and began operating the plant in parallel with a new larger plant called Spier Falls; regulation of the Mechnicville units speed was done manually until automatic governors were installed in 1902. From 1935 through to the end of WWII, the HVDC Mechanicville–Schenectady DC transmission system sent power to the GE plant and also served to convert from 40 Hz to 60 Hz. The original 12 kV switchgear used open switches operated by wooden sticks. This arrangement was quite dangerous by modern standards and resulted in one fatality and several near miss accidents. In 1902 the switchgear was replaced by oil-enclosed lever- operated switches, and in 1920 the system was again renovated with remotely controlled oil-filled circuit breakers. The 1920 switchboard has been retained to the present day. In 1949 two motor-generator frequency changer sets were installed so that the plant could provide power to standard 60 Hz networks.  Restoration and conversion to a museum In the 1960s, Niagara Mohawk Power Company, which owned many hydroelectric facilities in New York State, had begun a program of demolition of older, smaller facilities in favor of larger central stations. Although Niagara Mohawk (which owned the Mechanicville plant) planned to demolish it, by 1985 a competitive plan for developing waterpower at the site encouraged retention of the plant. A new 50-year water license, required for continued operation of the plant, was obtained in 1993 but in 1997 the company shut down the plant since it appeared power generated at a refurbished plant would not be competitive with other sources. The plant remained closed until, after litigation, ownership was transferred to Albany Engineering Company in 2003 and generation restarted. Extensive structural repairs and enhancements were carried out to modernize the plant. Renovation plans include restoration to the original 1898 exterior appearance while maintaining output from the plant. In 2005 Albany Engineering obtained permission to study a possible additional, underground, generator unit of 20 MW rating. References *James A.

Club career  = Early career = Born in Milan, Schenetti started playing football with amateur football academy Olmi, before joining A.C. Milan in 2001. He spent nine seasons in the club's youth system and was a member of both the under-19 squad who won the Campionato Berretti in 2009, and the under-20 side who triumphed in the Coppa Italia Primavera in 2010, 25 years after the team's last success in the competition. = Lucchese and Prato = At the beginning of the 2010–11 season, Schenetti was loaned out to Prima Divisione club Lucchese. Nevertheless, in the last week of August he suffered a calf injury, which prevented him to play for 45 days. The 19-year-old striker eventually made his official debut for the club on 17 November 2010, in a group stage game of the Coppa Italia Lega Pro against Carpi; he played 70 minutes and also scored the opener, before the opponents fought back in the second half to earn a 2–1 win. On 5 December, Schenetti made his league debut, coming on in the 75th minute of a 0–0 draw against Juve Stabia. That game, however, marked his last appearance for the club, as his loan spell was terminated on 26 January 2011, due to lack of playing time. Subsequently, Schenetti was sent out on another loan deal to Seconda Divisione club Prato for the remainder of the season. He made 10 league appearances and scored one goal, as the team finished third in the table and qualified for the promotion play-offs, where he made four further appearances and scored two more goals. However, they lost the final 2–1 on aggregate to Carrarese. = Südtirol = For the 2011–12 season, Schenetti joined Prima Divisione side Südtirol on another loan deal. = Sorrento = On 31 August 2012, Schenetti moved to Prima Divisione club Sorrento for an undisclosed fee, signing a two-year deal. =Entella= On 9 August 2019, he joined Entella.  Style of play  Due to his fast pace, Schenetti usually plays as a winger in a 4–3–3 formation, but he has also been employed as a striker, alongside a more physical forward.

Her delicate health forced them to live in Bourgogne until they moved in Paris in 1815. At that time, he became interested in what was then the new process of lithography. His first work in that medium was a view of the church in Sceaux. He focused on historical landscapes, however and, to this end, took numerous trips to the Chartreuse Mountains (1823), the Pyrénées (1825) and Italy (1830).

During this period, he was introduced to the literary salon at the Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal, where he became friends with many leading artists and writers; including David d'Angers, who would create a medal with his profile, and Charles Nodier, who wrote the preface to Habitations.... In 1835 Céleste died. Two years later, he married Élisa Honorine Petiet, a watercolorist and lithographer who specialized in floral still- lifes,Dictionnaire Benézit and they had a daughter in 1840.

Simple styling such as bold and italics are supported, but italicized text is replaced by underlined text on the terminal.. \\"Font styles are applied by using back-spaced encoding...\\" mandoc has built-in support for the troff soelim (inclusion) preprocessor and partial built-in support for tbl and eqn. It has strong support for UTF-8 output. It can also use the semantic information in mdoc manuals to implement semantic search, which before version 1.4.1, relied on sqlite.  History  Development began in November 2008 specifically to produce CSS-enabled HTML forms of manuals in response to the limitations of groff. mandoc gained initial text-mode output in February 2009. It was then showcased at AsiaBSDCon-2009. In summer of 2010, mandoc was the subject of a NetBSD-mentored Google Summer of Code project for producing PostScript and PDF output alongside the existing text, HTML, and XHTML outputs. This work was completed in August 2010. mandoc became the default formatter of manuals for OpenBSD 4.8, released in November 2010. It later became the default formatter in NetBSD, FreeBSD, illumos, Void Linux and Alpine Linux, and is also included in DragonFlyBSD, MINIX 3, Debian, Ubuntu, Gentoo, and Fedora. Its advantages were stated as high speed, license, and clean reimplementation. Sample usage The following demonstrates running \`mandoc\` on its own. Usually, it would be called via the man utility. In this example, \`foo.1\` is the name of an mdoc UNIX manual. # Pipe output to a pager. $ mandoc foo.1  less # HTML output with a style-sheet. $ mandoc -Thtml -Ostyle=style.css >foo.1.html Multibyte (localised) manuals may also be rendered without preprocessing. In this example, \`foo.jp.1\` is a Japanese manual encoded in UTF-8. mandoc will automatically detect the encoding. # Pipe wide-character output to a pager. $ mandoc foo.jp.1  less The included apropos implementation can use semantic information in search: # Search for all functions starting with 'str' having return type size_t: $ apropos -s 3 Ft=size_t -a Nm~^str  Other features  * \`mandoc\` supports HTML 5, PostScript, and PDF output via the parameter. * \`man.cgi\` is a CGI program designed to display manual pages on the web. OpenBSD uses it to format all its manual pages.

It is a UNESCO initiative that was first celebrated in the United States in the late ’80s, where there was a move to create a broad celebration of adult learning by the American Association for the Advancement of Education (AAAE). In 1990, governments met in Jomtien for the Education for All World conference. The aim of this conference was to set goals for universal access to and completion of primary education and to reduce the adult illiteracy rate to one half its 1990 level by 2000. Today Adult Learners’ Week is celebrated in many countries across the globe. It is a grass roots campaign led by the community education sector. Adult Learners' Week in the UK In the United Kingdom, the National Institute of Adult and Continuing Education first coordinated Adult Learners’ Week in 1992. Today Adult Learners’ Week is the UK’s largest festival of learning, and the overall purpose of the initiative is to raise demand for learning and skills. It highlights the benefits of learning of all kinds, learning for work, informal learning as well as learning for personal development. 14 to 20 May 2011 marked the twentieth Adult Learners’ Week in England. Adult Learners' Week in the UK is now known as the Festival of Learning The initiative is supported by the European Social Fund, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, Next Step, BBC, Open University and Pearson PLC. Adult Learners' Week in Australia Adult Learners' Week is supported in Australia by the Commonwealth Department of Education and Training and coordinated by Adult Learning Australia. Adult Learners' Week runs from 1–8 September and incorporates International Literacy Day, which is celebrated annually on September 8. ‘[T]he origins of Adult Learners’ Week in Australia can be directly traced to the UK experience’. In 1995, Adult Learning Australia (then the Australian Association of Adult Education) received a grant to conduct a national pilot of Adult Learners’ Week. Government funding was then made available, and has continued for the national coordination of Adult Learners’ Week. For 23 years, Adult Learners’ Week has been supported by successive Australian governments for a variety of reasons but largely because it attracts adults with some or all of the following characteristics: * Adults who are not engaged in formal or non-formal learning activities either in the workplace or in the community. * Adults who have had negative past experiences of formal education. * Adults with low levels of literacy and numeracy. * Adults who have an ambivalence about returning to learning. * Adults who lack of an understanding of the learning options available to them. In Australia, adult and community education providers support Adult Learners’ Week. Adult and community education (ACE) is recognised for reaching adults with low skills who may experience barriers to participation in formal learning settings. The ACE sector offers disadvantaged and disengaged learners points of access to vocational education and training, and work particularly for people who have struggled to complete mainstream schooling or for whom English is not their first language. ACE organisations are also major providers of foundation skills programs and adult literacy support. The twentieth year of Adult Learners Week was celebrated in Australia in 2015.

The defining characteristics of this event are that it is separate from and subsequent to salvation (the first work of grace), and that it brings about significant changes in the life of the believer.  Methodist and Holiness Christianity  John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist movement, taught that there were two distinct phases in the Christian experience. In the first work of grace, the new birth, the believer received forgiveness and became a Christian. During the second work of grace, sanctification, the believer was purified and made holy. Wesley taught both that sanctification could be an instantaneous experience, and that it could be a gradual process. Entire sanctification removes original sin and that those who experience it do not experience internal temptation to commit sin proper; the free will to backslide into sin and commit apostasy, however, exists (cf. conditional preservation of the saints). After Wesley's death, mainstream Methodism \\"emphasized sanctification or holiness as the goal of the Christian life\\", something that \\"may be received in this life both gradually and instantaneously, and should be sought earnestly by every child of God.\\" The Holiness movement emerged in the 1860s with the desire to re-emphasize Wesley's sanctification doctrine. Holiness preachers taught that sanctification was an instantaneous experience. In the Holiness movement, the second work of grace is considered to be a cleansing from the tendency to commit sin, an experience called entire sanctification which leads to Christian perfection. The Core Values of the Bible Methodist Connection of Churches thus teaches that: Reflecting this, they have emphasized Wesley's doctrine of outward holiness, which includes practices such as the wearing of modest clothing and not using profanity in speech.  Keswickian theology  Keswickian theology teaches a second work of grace that occurs through \\"surrender and faith\\", in which God keeps an individual from sin. Keswickian denominations, such as the Christian and Missionary Alliance, differ from the Wesleyan-Holiness movement in that the Christian and Missionary Alliance does not see entire sanctification as cleansing one from original sin, whereas holiness denominations espousing the Wesleyan-Arminian theology affirm this belief. Pentecostalism Pentecostalism was born out of the Holiness movement. William J. Seymour and Charles Fox Parham were both Holiness ministers and were seen by their followers as being used by God to restore Pentecost to the Church. Pentecostalism teaches that the believer could, in addition to becoming sanctified, receive power from God and the gifts of the Holy Spirit. In early Pentecostal thought, and the classic form of Pentecostalism influenced by Wesleyan-Arminian theology, this was considered the third work of grace that followed the new birth (first work of grace) and entire sanctification (second work of grace). Pentecostals who believe in the doctrine of Finished Work, however, reject the second work of grace to mean entire sanctification.

Built on the remains of outbuildings of Malmesbury Abbey, it lays claim to being the oldest existing hotel in England, standing on foundations dated to 1220, and is a Grade I listed building. It is located in Abbey Row adjacent to the abbey, which was built to accommodate scholars studying at the abbey. The bell of the inn sign refers to St Aldhelm's bell, the great bell in a peal of ten that once hung in the former west end tower of the abbey church, noted by John Leland's ItineraryLeland, Itinerary ii.21, noted in Mackenzie Edward Charles Walcott, The Mitred Benedictine Abbey of S. Aldhelm, Malmesbury, a guide-memoir 1876:21. and in William Camden's Britannia.Moffatt 1805:203. Architecture =Exterior= The inn has been extended and altered from a core built in 1220 for visiting monks, re-using material from the old keep built by Bishop Roger c1130, which had been demolished on the same site in 1216 by permission of King John. The abbey guest house was extended at the east end in the late 15th or early 16th century and the older structure partly refaced and reroofed. Following the dissolution of the monasteries, the house was referred to as the Steward's Lodging and was used for some time as weavers' lodgings: \\"every corner of the vast houses of office which belonged to the abbaye\\", Leland noted in 1540, \\"be fulle of lumbes to weve clothe yn\\"Leland, quoted in Walcott 1876:35. The present roofline and dormers date to the 17th century, and the west extension was added in 1908. The Old Bell The Old Bell was listed as a Grade I listed building on 28 January 1949. The 4-bay inn is built in limestone rubble with limestone dressings. Mullion windows are a feature and the front is heavily covered in vegetation. The inn has a central cross-axial stack, with a 16th- century two-bay extension and two large gable dormers on the east side. The doorway here is dated to the 18th century with an architrave and shell hood. On the west side is the main porch and entrance. =Interior= The interior of the hotel and restaurant is a fusion of styles; from Medieval to Edwardian in the main building, to Japanese in the coach house. The hotel has 33 rooms and 8 suites with four poster beds, and 3 single rooms. A prominent feature of the inn is an ashlar fire hood which is believed to be one of the earliest domestic-style ground-floor fireplaces, served by a flue, in England; it is dated to the initial building in 1220. It was restored around 1980. The central room to the first floor has a late 15th-century and early 16th-century compartmental ceiling with deeply moulded beams, and 17th-century dormers are cut through large trenched purlins. The current stairway is relatively new, replaced some time after 1950. A corridor connects the main building to the coaching house, which has six rooms on the ground floor, and several of the rooms are adjoining. Beneath the lounge to the inn is a vaulted cellar which has been reported to contain eight stone coffins. The dwarf walls with iron railings attached to the property are also part of the Listed Building designation. The hotel and restaurant has been awarded the AA 3 Stars and AA 2 Rosettes. The restaurant, which serves modern British Cuisine, is run by Head Chef Richard Synan.

Until 1964 the medical treatment of dependent drug users was separated from the punishment of unregulated use and supply. Under this policy drug use remained low; there was relatively little recreational use and few dependent users, who were prescribed drugs by their doctors as part of their treatment. From 1964 drug use was decreasingly criminalised, with the framework still in place largely determined by the Misuse of Drugs Act. History Until 1916 drug use was hardly controlled, and widely available opium and coca preparations commonplace.An Analysis of UK Drug Policy - A Monograph Prepared for the UK Drug Policy Commission, Peter Reuter, University of Maryland, Alex Stevens, University of Kent, April 2007 Between 1916 and 1928 concerns about the use of these drugs by troops on leave from the First World War and then by people associated with the London underworld gave rise to some controls being implemented. The distribution and use of morphine and cocaine, and later cannabis, were criminalised, but these drugs were available to addicts through doctors; this arrangement became known as the \\"British system\\" and was confirmed by the report of the Departmental Committee on Morphine and Heroin Addiction (Rolleston Committee) in 1926. The Rolleston Report was followed by \\"a period of nearly forty years of tranquillity in Britain, known as the Rolleston Era. During this period the medical profession regulated the distribution of licit opioid supplies and the provisions of the Dangerous Drugs Acts of 1920 and 1923 controlled illicit supplies.\\"THE BRITISH EXPERIENCE WITH HEROIN REGULATION, TREVOR BENNETT, Senior Research Associate, Institute of Criminology, Cambridge, England, 1988 The medical treatment of dependent drug users was separated from the punishment of unregulated use and supply. This policy on drugs was maintained in Britain, and nowhere else, until the 1960s. Under this policy drug use remained low; there was relatively little recreational use and few dependent users, who were prescribed drugs by their doctors as part of their treatment. The import of Marijuana via exportation is 1% of the trade within the drug industry in the UK. It has been argued that the main legal innovations between 1925 and 1964 were in response to international pressures, not domestic problems. In the 1960s a few doctors prescribed large amounts of heroin, some of which was diverted into the illegal market. Also substances such as cannabis, amphetamines and LSD started to become significant in the UK. In 1961 the international Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs was introduced. To control global drug trading and use, it banned countries from treating addicts by prescribing illegal substances, allowing only scientific and medical uses of drugs. It was not itself binding on countries, which had to pass their own legislation.h2g2: The UK's Misuse of Drugs Act (1971), 19 February 2009 Following pressure from the US, the UK implemented the Drugs (Regulation of Misuse) Act in 1964. Although the Convention dealt with the problems of drug production and trafficking, rather than the punishment of drug users, the 1964 Act introduced criminal penalties for possession by individuals of small amounts of drugs, as well as possession with intent to traffic or deal in drugs. The police were soon given the power to stop and search people for illegal drugs. In 1971 the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA) was passed, continuing measures in previous legislation, and classifying drugs into classes A (the most highly regulated), B, and C. Penalties for trafficking and supply were increased in the 1980s. In 1991 a new phase of UK drug legislation started with an attempt to integrate health and criminal justice responses via Schedule 1A6 Probation Orders. This reduced the separation between medical and punitive responses that had characterised the British system in the past. =Legislation= Drug related legislation:UK government: UK Public General Acts, searchable database *1868 – Pharmacy Act.

Emotional well-being is influenced by a variety of demographic, economic, and situational factors. For example, the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak, lowered emotional well-being by 74%. The implications of decreased emotional well-being are related to mental health concerns such as stress, depression, and anxiety. These in turn, contribute to physical health concerns such as digestive disorders, sleep disturbances, and general lack of energy. The profile of a person prone to emotional distress is likely someone with low self-esteem, pessimistic, emotionally sensitive, very self-critical…, people who need to constantly assert themselves through their emotions. They also tend to be timid, overly worried about the future, and focused on the past. As Dr. Marisa Navarro says in her book La Medicina Emocional (Emotional Medicine), \\"no one is safe from suffering this emotional state. It is a very serious problem that can result in constant states of anger, sadness, worry and even anxiety or depression\\". On the positive side, enhanced emotional well-being is seen to contribute to upward spirals in increasing coping ability, self-esteem, performance and productivity at work, and even longevity. Thoughts determine our feelings, and thoughts are nothing more than firings of neurons. And those feelings that our thoughts generate make our body release extremely addicting substances like adrenaline and cortisol. Like with any other addiction, the need to continually feed off these addicting substances tends to make the body think and feel in a certain way. When someone decides to disengage from these emotional addictions, they have to learn to think differently. The connection between the mind and the body is so strong that mental and physical states feed into each other in both a positive and negative way. Feelings depend on thoughts and both determine attitudes and actions. This is the first thing that children would have to learn at a young age in order to learn that they can take the reins of their lives. And their feelings would not depend on what is happening around them, but rather their interpretation about what is happening. Emotional well-being is also one of two aspects of personal well-being that can be measured in quantitative quality of life assessments, the other being 'life evaluation', the evaluation of one's life in general against a scale. It is a term receiving attention from many groups, from new-age therapists to management consultants, from outdoor recreation enthusiasts to carers for the elderly. It is also of interest to many parents, youth workers, school teachers, anti-bullying campaigners and those thinking about retirement, as well as to psychologists and other health professionals. Good emotional health leads to better physical health, prevents diseases, and makes it possible to enjoy life and be happier. In this way one can become a \\"medicine person\\" through mirror neurons, those that lead to empathy and fire to imitate the emotions of others. Mirror neurons are what make people feel good when they are with someone who is positive, cheerful and motivational. At the other extreme are the so-called \\"toxic people\\", who make others around them feel bad. The Surgeon General of the United States has made emotional well-being one of his priorities and spoke about its importance at the Aspen Ideas Festival 2016. Physicians must take a holistic approach to patients by caring for physical, psychological, and social health. To that end, they need to become aware of the importance of emotional medicine in order to help their patients decrease and manage negative feelings that can damage their health and teach them to enhance the positive feelings that can prevent and help heal illness.

Within the scope of global aspirations for a community of nations, Israel has faced international criticism since its declaration of independence in 1948 relating to a variety of topics, both historical and contemporary. The government of Israel has been criticized for issues regarding Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territories, its treatment of Palestinian Arabs, the conduct of Israeli Defense Forces during conflicts and the blockade of the Gaza Strip, with its impact on the economy of the Palestinian territories, the country's apparent nuclear weapons arsenal, and their targeted killings program. Other historic issues with ongoing consequences have also been criticized including: the refusal to allow post-war Palestinian refugees to return to their homes, and the prolonged occupation of territories gained in war and the construction of settlements therein. Israel's status as a representative democracy has also been questioned because Israeli residents of the occupied territories are allowed to vote in Israel's elections while Palestinian residents are not. Another source of criticism is the friction generated by the conversion issue between Israel's Orthodox rabbinate and non-Orthodox segments of the Jewish diaspora. At one end of the spectrum are attempts to delegitimize Israel's right to exist.Want to Delegitimize Israel? Be Careful Who You Mess With Eroding Israel’s Legitimacy in the International Arena http://reut- institute.org/en/Publication.aspx?PublicationId=3766 This has led to an ongoing debate regarding at what point criticism of Israel crosses the line to antisemitism. One of the effects of international criticism has been the impact on social psychology of the Israeli Jewish public—according to a survey, more than half of Israelis believe \\"the whole world is against us\\", and three quarters of Israelis believe \\"that no matter what Israel does or how far it goes towards resolving the conflict with the Palestinians, the world will continue to criticize Israel\\". Criticisms of Israeli policies come from several groups: primarily from activists, within Israel and worldwide, the United Nations and other non-governmental organizations including European churches, and mass media. Media bias is often claimed by both sides of the debate. Since 2003, the UN has issued 232 resolutions with respect to Israel, 40% of all resolutions issued by the UN over the period and more than six times that of the second placed country, Sudan. Subjects of criticism =Palestinian refugees= Palestinian refugees are defined by the UN as Arabs who lived in Palestine for at least two years prior to 1948 and their descendants, and who fled or were expelled from their homes during and after the 1948 Palestine War. The causes and responsibilities of the exodus are a matter of controversy among historians and commentators of the conflict.Shlaim, Avi, \\"The War of the Israeli Historians.\\" Center for Arab Studies, 1 December 2003 (retrieved 17 February 2009) Whereas historians now agree on most of the events of that period, there remains disagreement as to whether the exodus was the result of a plan designed before or during the war by Zionist leaders or was an unintended consequence of the war.Benny Morris, 1989, The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, 1947-1949, Cambridge University Press; Benny Morris, 1991, 1948 and after; Israel and the Palestinians, Clarendon Press, Oxford; Walid Khalidi, 1992, All That Remains: The Palestinian Villages Occupied and Depopulated by Israel in 1948, Institute for Palestine Studies; Nur Masalha, 1992, Expulsion of the Palestinians: The Concept of \\"Transfer\\" in Zionist Political Thought, Institute for Palestine Studies; Efraim Karsh, 1997, Fabricating Israeli History: The \\"New Historians\\", Cass; Benny Morris, 2004, The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited, Cambridge University Press; Yoav Gelber, 2006, Palestine 1948: War, Escape and the Palestinian Refugee Problem, Oxford University Press; Ilan Pappé, 2006, The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine, OneWorld Significant international pressure was placed on both sides during the 1949 Lausanne Conference to resolve the refugee crisis. The parties signed a joint protocol on the framework for a comprehensive peace, which included territories, refugees, and Jerusalem, in which Israel agreed \\"in principle\\" to allow the return of all of the Palestinian refugees. According to New Historian Ilan Pappe, this Israeli agreement was made under pressure from the United States, and because the Israelis wanted United Nations membership, which required Israeli agreement to allow the return of all refugees. Once Israel was admitted to the UN, it retreated from the protocol it had signed because it was completely satisfied with the status quo and saw no need to make any concessions with regard to the refugees or on boundary questions. This led to significant and sustained international criticism. Allegations of ethnic cleansing \\"New Historian\\" Ilan Pappe argued in The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine that Israel's policy between 1947 and 1949, when \\"over 400 Palestinian villages were deliberately destroyed, civilians were massacred, and around a million men, women, and children were expelled from their homes at gunpoint\\" is best described as ethnic cleansing.Benny Morris. The Liar as Hero, MARCH 17, 2011Ian Black Divided Loyalties February 17, 2007David Pryce-Jones Raus Mit Uns, Literary Review However, Pappe's work has been subject to significant criticism and allegations of fabrication by other historians. For example, Israeli historian Benny Morris called Pappe \\"At best... one of the world’s sloppiest historians; at worst, one of the most dishonest.\\" When asked about the 1948 Palestinian exodus from Lydda and Ramle, he responded \\"There are circumstances in history that justify ethnic cleansing. I know that this term is completely negative in the discourse of the 21st century, but when the choice is between ethnic cleansing and genocide - the annihilation of your people - I prefer ethnic cleansing. [...] There was no choice but to expel that population. It was necessary to cleanse the hinterland and cleanse the border areas and cleanse the main roads. It was necessary to cleanse the villages from which our convoys and our settlements were fired on.\\" He also added in 2008, that \\"There was no Zionist \\"plan\\" or blanket policy of evicting the Arab population, or of \\"ethnic cleansing\\". Plan Dalet (Plan D), of 10 March 1948 ... was the master plan ... to counter the expected pan-Arab assault on the emergent Jewish state\\".Benny Morris, \\"Benny Morris on fact, fiction, & propaganda about 1948\\", The Irish Times, 21 February 2008, https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/letters/israel-and-the- palestinians-1.896017 =Occupation and annexation of neighboring territories= The territories occupied by Israel from Egypt, Jordan, and Syria after the Six-Day War of 1967 have been designated as occupied territory by the United Nations and many other international organisations, governments and others. They consist of the West Bank and much of the Golan Heights. From the Six-Day War until 1982, the Sinai Peninsula was occupied by Israel, but it was returned to Egypt in the Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty. The Gaza Strip was also occupied by Israel until its unilateral disengagement. UN Security Council resolution 242, emphasized \\"the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war,\\" setting the stage for controversy on the legal status of areas captured in 1967, and in 1948. There are two interpretations of international law on this matter: The Israeli position: * The wars in 1956 and 1967 were waged by Israel to ensure the state's survival. As most hostilities were initiated by the Arab side, Israel had to fight and win these wars in order to ensure the state's sovereignty and safety. Territories captured in the course of those wars are therefore legitimately under Israeli administration for both security reasons and to deter hostile states from belligerence. *In the absence of peace treaties between all the parties at war, Israel has under all circumstances the right to maintain control of the captured territories. Their ultimate disposition should be a result of peace treaties, and not a condition for them. Even so, Israel asserts that: **The 1956 war was caused by a pattern of Egyptian belligerence against Israel, culminating with the nationalization of the Suez Canal and the blockage of the canal for Israeli traffic in violation of the Convention of Constantinople and other relevant treaties, in their view a clear casus belli (i.e., an act justifying war) **The 1967 war was similarly caused by the closing of the Straits of Tiran, the rejection of UN forces in the Sinai desert, and the redeployment of Egyptian forces. Jordan and Syria entered the war in spite of Israeli efforts to keep these frontiers peaceful. **The 1973 war was a surprise attack against Israel by Syria and Egypt. The Arab position: *The 1956 war was a result of a conspiracy between France, the United Kingdom and Israel in violation of Egypt's sovereignty. Egypt claimed several legal justifications for refusing Israel use of the Suez Canal, including the right of self-defence. *The war in 1967 was an unprovoked act of aggression aimed at expanding the boundaries of Israel, and the territories captured during this war are illegally occupied. *As a result, the territories must be ceded in order for peace to be achieved. Israel's annexation of East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights in 1980-1 by the Jerusalem Law and the Golan Heights Law has not been recognised by any other country.See also UN Security Council Resolution 497 The Palestinian Authority, the EU, and the UN Security Councils:United Nations Security Council Resolution 478 consider East Jerusalem to be part of the West Bank, a position disputed by Israel. International bodies such as the United Nations have condemned the Jerusalem Law as a violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention and therefore hold that the establishment of the city as Israel's capital is against international law. Consequently, countries have established embassies to Israel's government outside of Jerusalem. Israel unilaterally disengaged from Gaza in September 2005, and declared itself no longer to be in occupation of the Strip. This has been contested by the UN, which though not declaring Gaza \\"occupied\\" under the legal definition, has referred to Gaza under the nomenclature of \\"Occupied Palestinian Territories\\". Some groups do assert that Gaza is legally occupied.\\"Human Rights Council Special Session on the Occupied Palestinian Territories\\" July 6, 2006; Human Rights Watch considers Gaza still occupied. Alleged lack of democracy Despite the fact that Israeli security legislation for Palestinian territories does not state that, military law applies only to Arab residents of the territories, and not to Jews or to Israeli citizens. Israeli citizens are governed by Israeli law whereas Palestinians are governed by military law. Some Israeli individuals such as Avraham Burg, Ilan Pappé, Gershom Gorenberg, David Remnick, Oren Yiftachel, and Miko Peled and organisations as Human Rights Watch, B'tselem, Peace Now and others have questioned Israel's status as a democracy. These questions focus on the lack of democracy in the Israeli- occupied territories, not Israel proper. Such criticisms are based on the belief that both Israeli citizens in settlements and Palestinians should be given the right to suffrage, considering the Palestinians are effectively under Israeli authority and thus should benefit from it. They share a concern that the occupation of the territories is not temporary, given the over forty- five year duration and the large and the permanent nature of the Israeli settlements. =Israeli settlements= The participating High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention,point 12 numerous UN resolutions, the International Court of Justice and other instances have ruled that Israel's policy of establishing civilian settlements in territories considered occupied, including in East Jerusalem, is illegal. Israel disputes the notion that the West Bank and in particular East Jerusalem are occupied under international law, though this view is dismissed internationally. Israel's settlement policy has drawn harsh criticism from the United States and the European Union. Ali Jarbawi called the policy as “one of the only remaining settler-colonial occupations in the world today.”. In his book “Hollow Land: Israel's Architecture of Occupation”, Eyal Weizman describes Israel's policy as a “political system at the heart of this complex and terrifying project of late-modern colonial occupation.” The international community criticized Israel for 'failing to protect the Palestinian population' from Israeli settler violence. =Human rights= Human Rights Watch (HRW) has said Israel operates a \\"two-tier\\" judicial system in areas of the occupied Palestinian territories it administers, to an effect which provides preferential services, development, and benefits for Israelis living in settlements in the occupied territories while imposing harsh conditions on Palestinians and other non- Israeli citizens. In some cases Israel has acknowledged differential treatment of Palestinians and Israelis, such as having separate roads for both communities and operating checkpoints for Palestinians, asserting that the measures are necessary to protect Israelis from attacks by Palestinian armed groups. In 2011 the Israeli parliament passed a law criminalizing participation in boycotts of Israeli settlements. The law drew criticism from the EU, the United States and the Anti-Defamation League. Imprisonment Amnesty International reported that in 2009 hundreds of Palestinians were detained and held incommunicado for extended periods of time by Israel. While most were later released without charge, hundreds were tried before military courts whose procedures often failed to meet international standards for fair trial. According to Amnesty, almost all Palestinian prisoners were held in violation of international humanitarian law, which prohibits the transfer of detainees to the territory of the occupying power (i.e., Israel proper). It claimed that about 300 minors and 550 adults were held without charge or trial for more than a year. In 2011, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon said Israel held thousands of Palestinians as prisoners, and called on Israel to release them. Ban said the release of political prisoners would \\"serve as a significant confidence-building measure\\" and boost prospects of peace in the region. Also Amnesty International has called on Israel to release political prisoners, saying \\"all political prisoners held without charge or trial should be tried in fair trials or immediately released\\".ISRAEL/OCCUPIED TERRITORIES/PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY \\"Developing a human rights agenda for peace\\" (Amnesty, 26 March 2001) Israel objects to releasing prisoners, many of whom have been convicted by Israeli courts for violent crimes such as murder . However, several prisoner release deals have been conducted by Israel as a gesture in negotiations, many which involved the release of hundreds or more prisoners. According to Amnesty International, methods of torture used by Israel on Palestinian prisoners include prolonged tying in painful stress positions, sleep deprivation and threats to harm detainees’ families. Beatings and other ill-treatment of detainees are common during and following arrest and during transfer from one location to another. Treatment of ethnic and religious minorities Organizations such as Amnesty International, the Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI), the Israeli government- appointed Or Commission, and the United States Department of State have published reports that document racism and discrimination directed towards racial and ethnic groups in Israel. According to a study commissioned by Israel's Courts administration and Israel Bar Association, Arab Israelis who have been charged with certain types of crime are more likely than their Jewish counterparts to be convicted, and once convicted they are more likely to be sent to prison. The study also found differences in lengths of prison sentences given, with the average prison sentence at nine and a half months for Jews and 14 months for Arabs. Rights groups have said that anti- discrimination employment laws in Israel are rarely enforced. A coalition of nine Israeli rights groups has opposed a practice under which companies can advertise their policy to hire only Jewish Israelis, and no Arab Israelis. Companies advertising under a \\"Hebrew labor\\" banner adhere to a segregated employment philosophy derived from a practice by Jewish immigrants in Palestine in the first half of the 20th century which was meant to strengthen emerging Israeli industry from British and Arab influence. =Stagnating peace process= In February 2011, Netanyahu called German Chancellor Angela Merkel to complain about Germany's vote in favor of a resolution at the United Nations Security Council to declare Israeli settlements to be illegal and she responded \\"How dare you! You are the one who disappointed us. You haven't made a single step to advance peace.\\"Ravid, Barak. \\"Merkel chides Netanyahu for failing to make 'a single step to advance peace'.\\" Haaretz Newspaper, 25 February 2011. A few days later veteran Israeli diplomat Ilan Baruch resigned saying that Netanyahu's policies were leading to Israel's delegitimization.Ravid, Barak. \\"Veteran Israeli diplomat: Netanyahu and Lieberman harming Israel's stance in international community.\\" Haaretz Newspaper, 2 March 2011. =Military practices= Human shield allegations The IDF acknowledged using the \\"Neighbor Procedure” or the “Early Warning Procedure”, in which the IDF would encourage a Palestinian acquaintance of a wanted man to try to convince him to surrender. This practice was criticized by some as using \\"human shields\\", an allegation the IDF denied, saying that it never forced people into carrying out the Neighbor Procedure; and that Palestinians volunteered to prevent excess loss of life. Amnesty International and Human Rights WatchHuman Rights Watch, Jenin: IDF Military Operations, VII. Human Shielding and the Use of Civilians for Military Purposes, May 2002. are among the groups who made the \\"human shield\\" comparison. The Israeli group B'Tselem also made the comparison, saying that \\"for a long period of time following the outbreak of the second intifada Operation Defensive Shield, in April 2002, the IDF systematically used Palestinian civilians as human shields, forcing them to carry out military actions which threatened their lives\\".B'Tselem, \\"20 July 2006: Israeli Soldiers use civilians as Human Shields in Beit Hanun\\", July 20, 2006. The Neighbor Procedure was outlawed by the Supreme Court of Israel in 2005 but some groups say the IDF continues to use it, although they say the number of instances has dropped sharply.\\"Israel Probes \\"Human Shield\\" Allegations\\", CBS News, 11 April 2007. Possession of weapons of mass destruction Israel is seen to possess a nuclear arsenal of about 150 weapons, and Israel has been criticised for maintaining nuclear weapons and for not agreeing to a nuclear- free Middle East zone. In September 2009, the IAEA passed a resolution that \\"expresses concern about the Israeli nuclear capabilities, and calls upon Israel to accede to the NPT and place all its nuclear facilities under comprehensive IAEA safeguards...\\" Israel has signed the Chemical Weapons Convention but not ratified it, citing neighbouring states that have not done so either. Israel is widely believed to have chemical weapons but officials have never directly admitted it, although in 1990 Science Minister Yuval Neeman threatened to retaliate against an Iraqi chemical-weapons strike \\"with the same merchandise\\". Israel has not signed the Biological Weapons Convention. Targeted killings of terrorists Amnesty International has condemned Israel's policy of assassinations targeting individuals.ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES: ISRAEL MUST PUT AN IMMEDIATE END TO THE POLICY AND PRACTICE OF ASSASSINATIONS (Amnesty, 3 July 2003) \\"Amnesty International calls for an immediate end to the policy and practice of assassinations. For many years the Israeli army and security services have pursued a policy of extrajudicially executing Palestinians, without offering any proof of guilt and no right of defence. The pursuit of this policy has also resulted in the unlawful killing of scores and injury of hundreds of bystanders, including children\\" Israeli officials have admitted that the policy exists and is being pursued, saying it helps prevent acts of terrorism from being committed against Israel. The United States has a very similar policy. Criticism against has been raised also from some on the Israeli left, who say assassination policy is \\"gangster behavior\\" unbecoming of a government and is against Israeli law. Israel's Supreme Court has ruled that assassinations are illegal, but leaked documents suggest that Israel's army has ignored the ruling. =Judaization of Jerusalem= The term Judaization of Jerusalem refers to the view that Israel has sought to transform the physical and demographic landscape of Jerusalem to correspond with a vision of a united and fundamentally Jewish Jerusalem under Israeli sovereignty.This definition is drawn largely from Valerie Zink's, and is supported, among others, by that of Hassassian in Ginat et al., who defines the Judaization of Jerusalem as \\"impos[ing] a Jewish landscape both physically and demographically.\\" The United Nations has criticised Israel's efforts to change the demographic makeup of Jerusalem in several resolutions. All legislative and administrative measures taken by Israel, which have altered or aimed to alter the character, legal status and demographic composition of Jerusalem, are described by the UN as \\"null and void\\" and having \\"no validity whatsoever\\". Richard Falk, an investigator with the U.N. Human Rights Council, said that Israel's expansion of East Jerusalem settlements and evictions of Palestinian residents can \\"only be described in its cumulative impact as a form of ethnic cleansing\\". In a 2008 report, John Dugard, independent investigator for the United Nations Human Rights Council, cites the Judaization of Jerusalem among many examples of Israeli policies \\"of colonialism, apartheid or occupation\\" that create a context in which Palestinian terrorism is \\"an inevitable consequence\\". =The Law of Return= Israel has enacted a Law of Return that allows Jews a fast- track to Israeli citizenship. Palestinian refugees cannot apply for Israeli citizenship under the law since they are not Jewish, though they can apply for Israeli citizenship through the conventional channel. The law has drawn criticism from the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies which says the law is a \\"main example of Israeli laws that discriminate against Palestinian Arabs\\". The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee says the contrast between the Law of Return and Israeli opposition to the right of return of Palestinian refugees exhibits \\"barefaced racism\\".THE PALESTINIAN RIGHT OF RETURN (ADC issue paper 30, 2001) More than 1,000 American Jews have backed a campaign entitled “Breaking the Law of Return”, saying the Law of Return creates an ethnically exclusive citizenship, which they see as unjust. Critics claim that the guaranteed right for Jews to immigrate to Israel is discriminatory to non-Jews and therefore runs counter to the democratic value of equality under the law. =Current Government= Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak stated the current Israeli government is “infected by seeds of fascism” and \\"needs to be brought down.\\" Zionist Union MK Tzipi Livni stated the government was in a state of \\"crisis — not only of leadership but of ethics.” Criticism at the United Nations The UN has issued 232 resolutions with respect to Israel since 2003, representing 40% of all resolutions issued by the UN over the period and more than six times that of the second placed country, Sudan. According to testimony by the pro-Israel human rights NGO UN Watch to the United States Congress in January 2011 with respect to the United Nations Human Rights Council, Israel has been the focus of 70% of approximately 50 condemnatory resolutions by the council, 60% of the ten Special Sessions of the council and 100% of the council's five fact- finding missions or inquiries. Analogies =Accusations of apartheid= Comparisons between apartheid South Africa and Israel are increasingly made. Israelis recoil at the analogy, but the parallel is widely drawn in international circles.Settler policy imperils Israel’s foundations, Financial Times, Feb. 21st, 2013: \\"Faced with widely drawn international parallels between the West Bank and the Bantustans of apartheid South Africa, senior figures in Mr Netanyahu’s Likud party have begun to admit the danger.\\" The Association for Civil Rights in Israel, a group in Israel with support from several EU states, asserted in 2008 that the separate road networks in the West Bank for Israelis and Palestinians, the expansion of Jewish settlements, restriction of the growth of Palestinian towns and discriminatory granting of services, budgets and access to natural resources are \\"a blatant violation of the principle of equality and in many ways reminiscent of the Apartheid regime in South Africa\\". Israel has also been accused of apartheid by Michael Ben- Yair, Israel's attorney-general from 1993 to 1996. and Shulamit Aloni, who served as Minister for Education under Yitzhak Rabin. =Comparisons with Nazi Germany= Some key aspects of Israeli society are sometimes compared to Nazi Germany, directly or by allusion. Examples include: equating the Gaza Strip with concentration camps in Nazi-occupied Europe, and equating the idea of Jews as the chosen people with the Nazi idea of the Master Race. The IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism defines such comparisons as antisemitic. Following the 1967 Six-Day War, the Soviet Union compared Israeli tactics to those of Nazi Germany.Druks, Herbert, The Uncertain Alliance: The U.S. and Israel from Kennedy to the Peace Process, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2001, p.50. A similar comparison was made by the Israeli Arab author Nimer Nimer.Gordis, Daniel, Saving Israel: How the Jewish People Can Win a War That May Never End, John Wiley and Sons, 2010, p. 97. Yeshayahu Leibowitz, one of Israel's most prominent and acclaimed public intellectuals, philosophers, and scientist, and an Orthodox Jew, warned in 1982 that if the occupation continued, Israel would be in danger of succumbing to “Judeo-Nazism\\".Haaretz: \\"Prof. Yeshayahu Leibowitz's famous comment at the beginning of the First Lebanon War about \\"phenomena of Judeo-Nazism\\" as the inevitable consequences of an \\"occupation regime,\\" stirred a furor in Israel. There are some things you must not say aloud, or even think to yourself. This was in 1982.

He said the law is designed to strengthen Israel's identity as the \\"national home of the Jewish people\\" which showed that the soul of the Nazi leader had \\"risen again within some of Israel's officials\\". He added: \\"There's no difference between Hitler's obsession with a pure race and the understanding that these ancient lands are just for the Jews.\\" *Hajo Meyer, physicist and Jewish Holocaust survivor from Auschwitz, spent the final years of his life comparing Israel's treatment of Palestinians to the Nazis in Germany. The European Forum on Anti-Semitism stated that \\"drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis\\" amounted to anti- Semitism. In 2006, the British All-Party Parliamentary Group against Antisemitism recommended that the UK Government adopt the same stance. Sociologist David Hirsh accuses anti-Zionists of double standards in their criticism of Israel, and notes that other states carry out policies similar to those of Israel without those policies being described as \\"Nazi\\". He suggests that to describe Israel as engaged in \\"genocide\\" carries an unspoken accusation comparison with the Holocaust and an equation of Zionism with Nazism.Hirsh, David. 2007. Anti-Zionism and Antisemitism: Cosmopolitan Reflections. Working Paper. Yale Initiative for the Interdisciplinary Study of Antisemitism (YIISA) Occasional Papers, New Haven, CT. British author Howard Jacobson has suggested that comparisons between conditions faced by Palestinians and those of the Warsaw Ghetto are intended \\"to wound Jews in their recent and most anguished history and to punish them with their own grief\\" and are a form of Holocaust denial which accepts the reality of Jewish suffering but accuses Jews \\"of trying to profit from it\\". \\"It is as though,\\" he says, \\"by a reversal of the usual laws of cause and effect, Jewish actions of today prove that Jews had it coming to them yesterday.\\" In May 2018, Jewish Voice for Labour and Free Speech on Israel produced a definition of antisemitism. In notes posted on the Jewish Voice for Labour website they argued that comparing Israel's actions to those of the Nazis should not automatically be seen as antisemitic: \\"Drawing such parallels can undoubtedly cause offence, but potent historical events and experiences are always key reference points in political debate. Whether such comparisons are anti- Semitic must be judged on their substantive content, and on the inferences that can reasonably be drawn about the motivation for making them, rather than on the likely degree of offence caused.\\" In September, JVL contributed to the consultation on Labour's new code of conduct rejecting suggestions that comparisons between Israel and \\"features of pre-war Nazi Germany\\" or apartheid-era South Africa were \\"inherently antisemitic\\", and that \\"Such comparisons are only anti-Semitic if they show prejudice, hostility or hatred against Jews as Jews.\\" Criticism of Israel and antisemitism Some criticisms of Israel or Israeli policies have been characterized as anti- Semitic. Proponents of the concept of New Antisemitism, such as Phyllis Chesler, Gabriel Schoenfeld and Mortimer Zuckerman, argue that, since the 1967 Six-Day War, many criticisms of Israel are veiled attacks on Jews and hence are essentially antisemitic. Abba Eban, Robert S. Wistrich, and Joschka Fischer focus on criticism of Zionism, and contend that some forms of anti- Zionism, particularly attacks on Israel's right to exist, are anti-Semitic in nature. Critics of this view often portray this view as an \\"equation\\" of criticism with anti-Semitism. Some critics of Israel or Israeli policies, including Ralph Nader, Jenny Tonge, Noam Chomsky, and Desmond Tutu suggest that equating criticism of Israel with antisemitism is inappropriate or inaccurate. Other critics, such as John Mearsheimer, Alexander Cockburn, Norman Finkelstein, and William I. Robinson, claim that supporters of Israel sometimes equate criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism in a deliberate attempt to prevent legitimate criticism of Israel and discredit critics. However, proponents of the view usually argue that the equation of criticism with antisemitism is rarely made. For example, Alvin H. Rosenfeld considers this argument to be disingenuous, dismissing it as \\"the ubiquitous rubric 'criticism of Israel,'\\" He states that \\"vigorous discussion of Israeli policy and actions is not in question,\\" but rather statements that go well beyond legitimate criticism \\"and call into question Israel's right to continued existence.\\"Alvin H. Rosenfeld, \\"Rhetorical Violence and the Jews,\\" The New Republic, February 27, 2007. Alan Dershowitz claims that some enemies of Israel pretend to be victimized by accusations of anti-Semitism, in order to garner support for their position. Dina Porat (head of the Institute for Study of Anti-semitism and Racism at Tel-Aviv University) characterizes some anti- Zionist ideals as anti-Semitic, because they amount to singling-out Jews for special treatment, while all other comparable groups of people are entitled to create and maintain a homeland. She contends that anti-Zionism is anti-Semitic because it is discriminatory: \\"...antisemitism is involved when the belief is articulated that of all the peoples on the globe (including the Palestinians), only the Jews should not have the right to self-determination in a land of their own.Dina Porat, Defining Anti-Semitism, http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti- Semitism/asw2003-4/porat.htm#_edn23 accessed 15 November 2008 See also Emanuele Ottolenghi https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/nov/29/comment Hannah Rosenthal of the United States State Department said UN double standards against Israel constitute \\"profound anti-semitism\\". However, many commentators have suggested singling out Israel for disproportionate criticism is warranted as a result of Israel's actions. =Distinguishing legitimate criticism of Israel from antisemitism= The European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC) prepared a report in 2003 that distinguished criticism of Israel from anti-Semitism by testing whether \\"Israel is seen as being a representative of 'the Jew'\\": if the speaker is considering Israel as a representative of Jews in general, then anti-Semitism is deemed to be underlying the criticism. \\"Manifestations of Antisemitism in the EU 2002-2003\\", European Montoring Centre on Racisma and Xenophobia (EUMC), 2003, online, pp 13, 240: :\\"ARE ANTI-ISRAELI AND ANTI-ZIONIST EXPRESSIONS ANTISEMITIC? If we turn to the crucial question of defining the point where anti-Israeli and anti-Zionist expressions are to be considered as antisemitism, then we could conclude, on the basis of our definition of antisemitism, that anti-Israeli or anti-Zionist attitudes and expression are antisemitic in those cases where Israel is seen as being a representative of “the Jew”, i.e. as a representative of the traits attributed to the antisemitic construction of “the Jew”. But what if the opposite is the case and Jews are perceived as representatives of Israel? What if Jews are criticised or offended for Israel’s policies toward the Palestinians? If we stick to our definition, then, strictly speaking, we would have to qualify hostility towards Jews as “Israelis” only then as antisemitic, if it is based on an underlying perception of Israel as “the Jew”. If this is not the case, then we would have to consider hostility towards Jews as “Israelis” as not antisemitic, because this hostility is not based on the antisemitic stereotyping of Jews... What should not be considered as antisemitic and therefore does not have to be monitored under the heading of “antisemitism”, is hostility towards Israel as “Israel”, i.e. as a country that is criticised for its concrete policies. Hostility towards Israel as “Israel” (as opposed to criticism of Israel as representative of the stereotypical “Jew”) should only then become a matter of general public concern, when there is explicit evidence that criticism of Israel as “Israel” produces attacks on Jews as either “the Jew” or “Israeli”. If there is no such evidence, the case of criticism and hostility towards Israel as “Israel” should not be part of monitoring activities under the heading of “antisemitism”. Natan Sharansky, former Soviet dissident and Israeli Minister, suggested a three-part test to distinguish legitimate criticism of Israel from anti-Semitic attacks. Sharansky's tests that identify a criticism as anti-Semitic are: *Sharansky, Natan, \\"3D Test of Anti-Semitism: Demonization, Double Standards, Delegitimization\\", in Jewish Political Studies Review 16:3-4 (Fall 2004), online * See also: Congressional record of the 108th congress, Second session, volume 150, part 14, September 15, 2004 to September 28, 2004, page 18505: :\\"[Senator Norm Coleman of Minnesota speaking] Natan Sharansky … has talked about three ways to determine whether criticism of Israel rises to the level of anti-Semitism. He talks about the three Ds\\" Demonization, double standards, and delegitimization. Demonization - when Israeli actions are blown so far out of proportion that the account paints Israel as the embodiment of all evil; Double Standards - when Israel is criticized soundly for thing any other government would be viewed as justified in doing, like protecting its citizens from terrorism. Delegitimization: a denial or Israel's right to exist or the right of the Jewish people to live securely in a homeland.\\" #Demonization - when Israeli actions are blown so far out of proportion that the account paints Israel as the embodiment of all evil. #Double Standards - when Israel is criticized soundly for an action or policy that any other government would be viewed as justified in doing, like protecting its citizens from terrorism. #Delegitimization: a denial of Israel's right to exist or the right of the Jewish people to live securely in a homeland. Demonization and double standards are often used as evidence of anti-Semitism in relation to criticism of Israel. Sharansky believes that some criticisms involve applying an especially high moral standard to Israel, higher than applied to other countries (particularly compared to surrounding countries), yet the only special characteristic of Israel is that it is a Jewish state, hence there is an element of anti-Semitism.Sharansky, Natan, \\"3D Test of Anti-Semitism: Demonization, Double Standards, Delegitimization\\", in Jewish Political Studies Review 16:3-4 (Fall 2004), online Delegitimization was a factor addressed by Abba Eban, who claimed that efforts to deny \\"the equal rights of the Jewish people its lawful sovereignty within the community of nations\\" constituted anti-Semitism.Quoted by Oliver Kamm, \\"Chomsky, antisemitism and intellectual standards\\", : :Kamm quotes Eban: \\"There is no difference whatever between anti-Semitism and the denial of Israel's statehood. Classical anti-Semitism denies the equal right of Jews as citizens within society. Anti-Zionism denies the equal rights of the Jewish people its lawful sovereignty within the community of nations. The common principle in the two cases is discrimination\\". (New York Times, November 3, 1975). =European Union 2006 report on antisemitism = The European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC, recently renamed to Fundamental Rights Agency) published a draft of an operational definition of antisemitism called Working Definition of Antisemitism which accompanied a report by the EUMC on report that summarized antisemitism in Europe.EUMC report The EUMC working definition included five kinds of behaviors related to criticism of Israel that might be manifestations of antisemitism: # Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor. # Applying double standards by requiring of it a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation. # Using the symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism (e.g., claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel or Israelis. # Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis. # Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel. This part of the definition has proved highly contentious and is seen by many as attempting to proscribe legitimate criticism of the human rights record of the Israeli Government by attempting to bring any criticism of Israel into the category of antisemitism, and as not sufficiently distinguishing between criticism of Israeli actions and criticism of Zionism as a political ideology, on the one hand, and racially based violence towards, discrimination against, or abuse of, Jews.Paul Igansky points out that one of the EUMC anti-Semitic behaviors, comparisons between Israeli policy and those of the Nazis, is \\"arguably not intrinsically antisemitic\\", and that the context in which they are made is critical. Igansky illustrates this with the incident where Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin was described by fellow Jewish Israelis as cooperating with the Nazis, and depicted wearing an SS uniform. According to Igansky, the \\"Nazi\\" label was merely used as \\"charged political rhetoric\\" in this case.Igansky, Paul, \\"Conceptualizing Anti-Jewish Hate Crime\\", in Hate Crimes, Barbara A. Perry (Ed.), Greenwood Publishing Group, 2009, pp 114-115 =EISCA 2009 report on criticism of Israel= Following the 2006 EUMC report, the European Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism (EISCA) published a report in 2009 entitled Understanding and Addressing the ‘Nazi Card' - Intervening Against Antisemitic Discourse which discussed comparisons of Israel with Nazi Germany.Ignasky, EISCA Report. A brief excerpt from the report's introduction, p. 4: :\\"Playing the ‘Nazi card’ is a discursive act involving the use of Nazi or related terms or symbols (Nazism, Hitler, swastikas, etc.) in reference to Jews, Israel, Zionism or aspects of the Jewish experience. It manifests in words uttered in speech or in writing, or in visual representations such as artwork, drawings, caricatures, cartoons, graffiti, daubings and scratchings, or visual expressions such as a Nazi salute or the clicking of heels. In many instances, the playing of the Nazi card is unquestionably antisemitic. However, the inclusion of particular modes of criticism of Israel in definitions of antisemitism has provoked controversy. The result has been a war of words which has stagnated into an intellectual and discursive cul-de-sac of claim and counter-claim about what does and does not qualify as antisemitism…. One of the most challenging components of antisemitic discourse in general, and the discursive theme of the Nazi card in particular, concerns the problem of when the Nazi card is played against Israel and its founding movement, Zionism. In this case playing the Nazi card involves equating the Israeli state collectively, or the state embodied by its leaders or its military practices, with Nazis, Nazi Germany, and the genocidal actions of the Nazi regime….\\" The 2009 report incorporated from the 2006 report the five specific kinds of criticism of Israel that should be considered as anti-Semitism (see above for a list of the five).EISCA report, p 34 The report does not say all criticism of Israel is anti-Semitic: \\"Abhorrence and protest against the policies, practices, and leaders of the Israeli state can be expressed in numerous forceful and trenchant ways, as they could against any other state - none of which would be antisemitic…\\",EISCA report, p 24 and \\"Drawing attention to the consequent harms in [playing the Nazi card against Israel] should not be intended, or taken, in any way as an attempt to suppress criticism of Israel and its military practices.\\"EISCA report, p 32 Antony Lerman criticized the report, and suggested that it could be used to suppress legitimate criticism of Israel, and suggests that the report's authors do not adequately address that possibility.Lerman Should we ban ..\\": :\\"While much of the [report's] definition [of anti-Semitism relating to criticism of Israel] is unexceptionable, it cites five ways in which antisemitism could be seen to \\"manifest itself with regard to the state of Israel taking into account the overall context\\". One of these – \\"using the symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism... to characterize Israel or Israelis\\" – is fully justified. The other four are contentious: \\"Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination\\"; \\"Applying double standards by requiring of [Israel] a behaviour not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation\\"; \\"Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis\\"; \\"Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel\\". None of these four are self-evidently antisemitic. But all could be used to justify labeling legitimate criticism of Israel as antisemitic. So the authors' approval of them makes their claim that \\"Drawing attention to the consequent harms in [playing the Nazi card against Israel] should not be intended, or taken, in any way as an attempt to suppress criticism of Israel and its military practices\\" both naïve and flimsy.\\" =Objections to characterizing criticism of Israel as anti-Semitism= Some commentators have objected to the characterization of criticisms of Israel as anti-Semitic, and have often asserted that supporters of Israel equate criticism with anti- Semitism or excessively blur the distinction between the two. Examples include Michael P. Prior, Noam Chomsky, Norman Finkelstein, Michael Lerner, Antony Lerman, Ralph Nader, Jenny Tonge, Ken Livingstone, and Desmond Tutu. They provide a variety of reasons for their objections, including stifling free expression, promoting anti-Semitism, diluting genuine anti-Semitism, and alienating Jews from Judaism or Israel. Vague and indiscriminate Michael Lerner claims that the American Jewish community regularly tries to blur the distinction between legitimate criticism of Israel and anti-Semitism, and says it is a \\"slippery slope\\" to expand the definition of anti-Semitism to include legitimate criticism of Israel.Lerner: :\\"The New York Times reported on January 31 [Patricia Cohen, \\"Essay Linking Liberal Jews and Anti_Semitism Sparks a Furor\\", 2007] about the most recent attempt by the American Jewish community to conflate intense criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism. In a neat little example of slippery slope, the report on 'Progressive Jewish Thought and the New Anti-Semitism,' written by Alvin H. Rosenfeld [and published by American Jewish Committee in 2006], moves from exposing the actual anti-Semitism of those who deny Israel's right to exist—and hence deny to the Jewish people the same right to national self-determination that they grant to every other people on the planet—to those who powerfully and consistently attack Israel's policies toward Palestinians, see Israel as racist the way that it treats Israeli-Arabs (or even Sephardic Jews), or who analogize Israel's policies to those of apartheid as instituted by South Africa.\\" Philosophy professor Irfan Khawaja asserts that it is a \\"false equation\\" to equate anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism, writing \\"The point is not that the charge of 'anti-Semitism' should never be made: some people deserve it…. But the equation of anti-Semitism with anti-Zionism is a farce that has gone on long enough, and it’s time that those who saw through the farce said so…\\"Khawaja, Irfan, \\"Poisoning the Well: The False Equation of Anti-Zionism and Anti-Semitism\\", History News Network, online, 28 March 2005: :\\"… Schoenfeld takes umbrage at questions about the power of “the Jewish lobby,” and construes the asking of such questions as evidence of anti-Semitism. In some cases, he thinks that a particular criticism of Israel is overwrought, and takes its being overwrought as evidence of anti-Semitism. In some cases the claim is that a Jewish author is self-hating, which becomes evidence of anti-Semitism. In some cases we are told that a person draws attention to his Jewish friends while criticizing Israel, which only proves that the person wishes to be insulated from charges of anti-Semitism—which proves, in advance of any actual accusation, that he must be an anti-Semite.... The point is not that the charge of “anti-Semitism” should never be made: some people deserve it. Nor must it always be made with trepidation: some people obviously deserve it. Nor must anti-Zionists be thought immune to the charge: too many of them are guilty.... But the equation of anti-Semitism with anti-Zionism is a farce that has gone on long enough, and it’s time that those who saw through the farce said so—at length, if necessary....I’ve mentioned just a few examples here, but whatever its virtues (and there are some, as I’ve been at pains to suggest), the deficiencies I’ve described characterize the “new anti-Semitism” literature as a whole. For examples, consult Phyllis Chesler’s The New Anti- Semitism (pp. 4, 171-179, 182-185), Abraham Foxman’s Never Again: The Threat of the New Anti-Semitism (pp. 17-21), Alan Dershowitz’s The Case for Israel (p. 210), the writings of Bat Ye’or, as well as scattered essays in Rosenbaum’s anthology, Commentary, at WorldNet.Daily, or in your local Jewish paper. The modus operandi is more or less the same: First we are informed, accurately enough, of the existence of the new anti-Semitism. Then we are told that anti-Zionism is now ubiquitously used as a cover for that anti-Semitism. From there we skate imperceptibly to the equation of anti-Zionism with anti- Semitism. And from there we are blackmailed into accepting the equation on pain of being accused of anti-Semitism.\\" Palestine Monitor, a Palestinian advocacy group, is critical of what it characterizes as a modern trend to expand the definition of the term \\"antisemitic\\", and states that the new definitions are overly vague and allow for \\"indiscriminate accusations\\".: An article reviewing Finkelstein's book Beyond Chutzpah: :\\"For a more profound explanation of Israeli's emerging opponents, the Zionist lobby blames 'new anti-Semitism'; a term nebulous and versatile enough to fit most any opponent. Arnold Foster and Benjamin Epstein define it as 'callous indifference to Jewish concerns, a failure to understand the most profound apprehension of Jewish people.' A 2007 British government investigation into racism counted 'perceptions of Anti-Semitism' as an example of it. Naturally such vagaries allow for almost indiscriminate accusations. Phyllis Chesler, author of A New Anti-Semitism casts her net wide to include as Israeli's enemies 'western- based international human rights organisations, western anti-capitalist, anti- globalist, pro-environment, anti-war and anti-racist activists, progressive feminists, Jewish feminists and the left and liberal American media'.\\" Brian Klug argues that anti-Zionism sometimes is a manifestation of antisemitism, but that \\"[t]hey are separate\\" and that to equate them is to incorrectly \\"conflate the Jewish state with the Jewish people.\\"Klug: :\\"There is a long and ignoble history of \\"Zionist\\" being used as a code word for \\"Jew,\\" as when Communist Poland carried out \\"anti-Zionist\\" purges in 1968, expelling thousands of Jews from the country, or when the extreme right today uses the acronym ZOG (Zionist Occupied Government) to refer to the US government. Moreover, the Zionist movement arose as a reaction to the persecution of Jews. Since anti-Zionism is the opposite of Zionism, and since Zionism is a form of opposition to anti-Semitism, it seems to follow that an anti-Zionist must be an anti-Semite. Nonetheless, the inference is invalid. To argue that hostility to Israel and hostility to Jews are one and the same thing is to conflate the Jewish state with the Jewish people. In fact, Israel is one thing, Jewry another. Accordingly, anti-Zionism is one thing, anti-Semitism another. They are separate. To say they are separate is not to say that they are never connected. But they are independent variables that can be connected in different ways.\\" Earl Raab, founding director of the Nathan Perlmutter Institute for Jewish Advocacy at Brandeis University writes that \\"[t]here is a new surge of antisemitism in the world, and much prejudice against Israel is driven by such antisemitism,\\" but argues that charges of antisemitism based on anti-Israel opinions generally lack credibility. He writes that \\"a grave educational misdirection is imbedded in formulations suggesting that if we somehow get rid of antisemitism, we will get rid of anti-Israelism. This reduces the problems of prejudice against Israel to cartoon proportions.\\" Raab describes prejudice against Israel as a \\"serious breach of morality and good sense,\\" and argues that it is often a bridge to antisemitism, but distinguishes it from antisemitism as such.Raab, Earl. \\"Antisemitism, anti- Israelism, anti-Americanism\\" , Judaism, Fall 2002. Irfan Khawaja suggests that some legitimate criticisms of Israel are improperly attacked by deliberately conflating them with criticisms that are anti-Semitic in nature.Khawaja: :\\"These claims [that critics of Israel are anti-Semitic] are a textbook example of the fallacy of poisoning the well—the fallacy, in logic, of rebutting someone’s argument by adducing the ulterior motives he might have had for making it. Well poisoning is a ubiquitous feature of our misologistic culture, but Hanson’s commission of the fallacy differs from the run-of-the- mill variety by its subtle introduction of the issue of anti-Semitism. The claim here is not the truism that Arab anti-Semitism finds resonance in Europe, but that such interest as “the world” expresses in Palestine is merely a cover for its anti-Semitism. This claim is a casual instance of a broader trend: the reflexive equation, by defenders of Israel, of anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism, itself part of the emerging literature on “the new anti- Semitism.” Focusing on the undeniable fact that many anti-Zionists are anti- Semites, and that anti-Zionism can easily be used as a disguise for anti- Semitism, writers in this genre simply insist over and over that no one can be an anti-Zionist without simultaneously being an anti-Semite.\\" Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair, in the book The Politics of Anti-Semitism, write \\"Apologists for Israel's repression of Palestinians toss the word 'anti- Semite' at any critic of what Zionism has meant in practice for Palestinians on the receiving end. So some of the essays in this book address the issue of what constitutes genuine anti-Semitism – Jew-hatred – as opposed to disingenuous, specious charges of 'anti-Semitism' hurled at rational appraisals of the state of Israel's political, military, and social conduct.\\"Cockburn, p vii Represents Jews as victims Norman Finkelstein and Steven Zipperstein (professor of Jewish Culture and History at Stanford University) suggest that criticism of Israel is sometimes inappropriately considered to be anti-Semitism due to an inclination to perceive Jews as victims. Zipperstein suggests that the common attitude of seeing Jews as victims is sometimes implicitly transferred to the perception of Israel as a victim; while Finkelstein suggests that the depiction of Israel as a victim (as a \\"Jew among nations\\") is a deliberate ploy to stifle criticism of Israel. * Zipperstein, p 61: :Steven Zipperstein, argues that a belief in the State of Israel's responsibility for the Arab-Israeli conflict is considered \\"part of what a reasonably informed, progressive, decent person thinks.\\" He argues that Jews have a tendency to see the State of Israel as a victim because they were very recently themselves \\"the quintessential victims.\\" * Finkelstein p 16: :\\"To evade the obvious, another stratagem of the Israel's lobby is playing The Holocaust and 'new anti-Semitism' cards. In a previous study, I examined how the Nazi holocaust had been fashioned into an ideological weapon to immunize Israel from legitimate criticism. In this book I look at a variant of this Holocaust card, namely, the 'new anti-Semitism'. In fact, the allegation of a new anti-Semitism is neither new nor about anti-Semitism. Whenever Israel comes under renewed international pressure to withdraw from occupied territories, its apologists mount yet another meticulously orchestrated media extravaganza alleging that the world is awash in anti-Semitism. This shameless exploitation of anti-Semitism delegitimizes criticism of Israel, makes Jews rather than Palestinians the victims, and puts the onus on the Arab world to rid itself of anti-Semitism rather than on Israel to rid itself of the Occupied Territories. A close examination of what the Israel lobby tallies as anti-Semitism reveals three components: exaggeration and fabrication; mislabeling legitimate criticism of Israeli policy; and the unjustified yet predictable 'spillover' from criticism of Israel to Jews generally.\\" *Finkelstein p 33: :\\"The dominant trope of the new 'new anti-Semitism' is that Israel has become the 'Jew among nations'…. In their 1982 study the Perlmuters pointed out the 'transformation … from anti-Semitism against Jews to anti- Semitism the object of which is the Jews' surrogate: Israel'… The transparent motive behind these assertions is to taint any criticism of Israel as motivated by anti-Semitism and - inverting reality - to turn Israel (and Jews), not Palestinians, in the victim of the 'current siege' (Chesler).\\" * Finkelstein quotes four authors (who support the notion of New Antisemitism) who he claims rely on the victim perception: Chesler, Zuckerman, Cotler, and Schoenfeld \\"Self-hating\\" Jews Sander Gilman has written, \\"One of the most recent forms of Jewish self-hatred is the virulent opposition to the existence of the State of Israel.\\"Sander Gilman, \\"Jewish Self-Hatred: Anti- Semitism and the Hidden Language of the Jews,\\" Baltimore:Johns Hopkins University Press 1986, pp. 361. He uses the term not against those who criticize Israel's policy, but against Jews who oppose Israel's existence. Michael Lerner, editor of Tikkun magazine, asserts that the equation of Criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism has resulted in conflict within the Jewish community, in particular, proponents of the equation sometimes attack Jewish critics of Israeli policies as \\"self-hating Jews\\".Lerner: :\\"Yet there is nothing \\"new\\" about this or about this alleged anti-Semitism that these mainstream Jewish voices seek to reveal. From the moment I started Tikkun Magazine twenty years ago as \\"the liberal alternative to Commentary and the voices of Jewish conservatism and spiritual deadness in the organized Jewish community,\\" our magazine has been attacked in much of the organized Jewish community as \\"self-hating Jews\\" (though our editorial advisory board contains some of the most creative Jewish theologians, rabbis, Israeli peace activist and committed fighters for social justice). The reason? We believe that Israeli policy toward Palestinians, manifested most dramatically in the Occupation of the West Bank for what will soon be forty years and in the refusal of Israel to take any moral responsibility for its part in the creation of the Arab refugee problem, is immoral, irrational, self- destructive, a violation of the highest values of the Jewish people, and a serious impediment to world peace.\\" Lerner also claims that the equation of Criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism and the resulting charges of \\"self hating Jew\\" has resulted in the alienation of young Jews from their faith. Lerner: The impact of the silencing of debate about Israeli policy on Jewish life has been devastating. We at Tikkun are constantly encountering young Jews who say that they can no longer identify with their Jewishness, because they have been told that their own intuitive revulsion at watching the Israeli settlers, with IDF support, violate the human rights of Palestinian civilians in the West Bank, or their own questioning of Israel's right to occupy the West Bank, are proof that they are \\"self-hating Jews.\\" The Jewish world is driving away its own young. Antony Lerman believes that many attacks on Jewish critics of Israel are \\"vitriolic, ad hominem and indiscriminate\\" and claims that anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism have been defined too broadly and without reason.Lerman, \\"Jews attacking Jews\\": :\\"Anti-Semitism can be disguised as anti-Zionism, and a Jew can be an anti-Semite. In principle, therefore, exposing an alleged Jewish anti-Semite is legitimate. But if you read the growing literature that does this - in print, on Web sites and in blogs - you find that it exceeds all reason: The attacks are often vitriolic, ad hominem and indiscriminate. Aspersions are cast on the Jewishness of individuals whom the attacker cannot possibly know. The charge of Jewish \\"self-hatred\\" - another way of calling someone a Jewish anti-Semite - is used ever more frequently, despite mounting evidence that it's an entirely bogus concept. Anything from strong criticism of Israel's policies, through sympathetic critiques of Zionism, to advocacy of a one-state solution for the Israel- Palestine conflict, is defined as anti-Zionism, when none of these positions are prima facie anti-Zionist. Many attackers endow their targets with the ability to bring disaster and dissolution to the Jewish people, thereby making it a national and religious duty for Jews to wage a war of words against other Jews.\\" Lerman also states that the \\"redefinition\\" of anti-Semitism to include anti-Zionism has caused Jews to attack other Jews, because many Jews are leaders in several anti-Zionist organizations.Lerman: Jews attacking Jews: :\\"The equation 'anti-Zionism = anti-Semitism' has thus become the new orthodoxy, and has even earned the seal of approval of the European Union. Its racism and anti-Semitism monitoring center (the [Fundamental] Rights Agency) produced a 'working definition' of anti-Semitism, with examples of five ways in which anti-Israel or anti-Zionist rhetoric is anti-Semitic. The 2006 report of the U.K.'s All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Anti-Semitism urged the adoption of the EU definition, and the U.S. State Department's 2008 report 'Contemporary Global Anti-Semitism' is also based on it. The redefinition of anti-Semitism has led to a further radical change in confronting the phenomenon. Many Jews are at the forefront of the growing number of anti- Israel or anti-Zionist groups. So, perceived manifestations of the 'new anti- Semitism' increasingly result in Jews attacking other Jews for their alleged anti-Semitic anti-Zionism.\\" Nicholas Saphir, Chair of the Board of Trustees of the New Israel Fund in the UK published an open letter defending non- governmental organizations (NGOs) that operate within Israel to promote civil rights. He said that several organisations such as NGO Monitor, Israel Resource News Agency, WorldNetDaily and the Near and Middle East Policy Review \\"associate moral and ethical criticism of any activity by Israel or the policies of its Government as being anti-Israel, anti-Semitic and when conducted by Jews, as evidence of self-hatred.\\" : :\\"Several organisations such as the self-styled NGO Monitor, Israel Resource News Agency, WorldNetDaily and the Near and Middle East Policy Review are promoting the view that the work of Human Rights NGOs working in Israel is, by its very nature, anti-Israel. Their charge is to associate moral and ethical criticism of any activity by Israel or the policies of its Government as being anti-Israel, anti-Semitic and when conducted by Jews, as evidence of self-hatred.\\" Scare tactics The International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network is also opposed to the use of the antisemitic label to suppress criticism, and objected to the \\"fear tactics\\" employed when the anti-Semitic label was applied to supporters of Israel Apartheid Week, claiming that it was reminiscent of the anti-Communist scare tactics of the 1950s.: :\\"We are appalled by recent attempts of prominent Jewish organizations and leading Canadian politicians to silence protest against the State of Israel. We are alarmed by the escalation of fear tactics. Charges that those organizing Israel Apartheid Week or supporting an academic boycott of Israel are anti-Semites promoting hatred bring the anti-Communist terror of the 1950s vividly to mind. We believe this serves to deflect attention from Israel’s flagrant violations of international humanitarian law…. We recognize that anti-Semitism is a reality in Canada as elsewhere, and we are fully committed to resisting any act of hatred against Jews. At the same time, we condemn false charges of anti-Semitism against student organizations, unions, and other groups and people exercising their democratic right to freedom of speech and association regarding legitimate criticism of the State of Israel.\\" Michael Lerner suggests that some United States politicians are reluctant to criticise Israel because they are afraid of being labelled anti-Semitic. Lerner, referring to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC): :\\"But the most destructive impact of this new Jewish Political Correctness is on American foreign policy debates. We at Tikkun have been involved in trying to create a liberal alternative to AIPAC and the other Israel-can-do-no-wrong voices in American politics. When we talk to Congressional representatives who are liberal or even extremely progressive on every other issue, they tell us privately that they are afraid to speak out about the way Israeli policies are destructive to the best interests of the United States or the best interests of world peace—lest they too be labeled anti-Semitic and anti-Israel. If it can happen to Jimmy Carter, some of them told me recently, a man with impeccable moral credentials, then no one is really politically safe.\\" Lerner also states that groups that promote peace in the mid-East are afraid to form coalitions, lest they be discredited by what Lerner terms the \\"Jewish Establishment\\". Lerner: \\"Even better if we could succeed in creating a powerful alternative to AIPAC. Unfortunately, that path is not so easy. When we approached some of the Israel peace groups to form an alliance with us to build the alternative to AIPAC we found that the hold of the Jewish Establishment was so powerful that it had managed to seep into the brains of people in organizations like Americans for Peace Now (not the Israeli group Peace Now which has been very courageous), Brit Tzedeck ve'Shalom and the Israel Policy Forum or the Religious Action Center of the Reform movement. As a result these peace voices are continually fearful that they will be \\"discredited\\" if they align with each other and with us to create this alternative to AIPAC. Meanwhile, while they look over their right shoulders fearfully, the very people that they fear will \\"discredit\\" them for aligning with each other and with us are already discrediting them as much as they possibly can.\\" Draws attention away from genuine antisemitism Brian Klug asserts that proponents of New Antisemitism define antisemitism so broadly that they deprive the term \\"antisemitism\\" of all meaning. Klug writes: \\"... when anti-Semitism is everywhere, it is nowhere. And when every anti- Zionist is an anti-Semite, we no longer know how to recognize the real thing-- the concept of anti-Semitism loses its significance.\\" Klug: :\\"In defense of her [Chesler's] assertion that there is a global \\"war against the Jews,\\" Chesler wields the ultimate weapon. \\"In my opinion,\\" she says, \\"anyone who denies that this is so or who blames the Jews for provoking the attacks is an anti-Semite.\\" Since I deny that there is such a war, this makes me an anti- Semite. But since her argument empties the word of all meaning, I do not feel maligned. In his contribution to A New Antisemitism?, historian Peter Pulzer, faulting the way \\"the liberal press\\" sometimes reports the activities of the Israel Defense Forces in the occupied territories, makes a telling point about the misuse of words. He says: \\"When every civilian death is a war crime, that concept loses its significance. When every expulsion from a village is genocide, we no longer know how to recognize genocide. When Auschwitz is everywhere, it is nowhere.\\" Point taken. But equally, when anti-Semitism is everywhere, it is nowhere. And when every anti-Zionist is an anti-Semite, we no longer know how to recognize the real thing--the concept of anti-Semitism loses its significance.\\" In the book The Politics of Anti-Semitism Scott Handleman writes: \\"Partisans of Israel often make false accusations of anti- Semitism to silence Israel's critics. The 'antisemite' libel is harmful not only because it censors debate about Israel's racism and human rights abuses but because it trivializes the ugly history of Jew-hatred.\\"Handleman, Scott, \\"Trivializing Jew-Hatred,\\" in The Politics of Anti-Semitism, ed. Alexander Cockburn. AK Press, 2003, p. 13. Excessive accusations of antisemitism may result in backlash Brian Klug argues that excessive claims of anti- Semitism (leveled at critics of Israel) may backfire and contribute to anti- Semitism, and he writes \\"a McCarthyite tendency to see anti-Semites under every bed, arguably contributes to the climate of hostility toward Jews\\" Klug: :\\"a McCarthyite tendency to see anti-Semites under every bed, arguably contributes to the climate of hostility toward Jews. The result is to make matters worse for the very people these authors mean to defend.\\" Tony Judt also suggests that Israel's \\"insistent identification\\" of criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism is now the leading source of anti-Jewish sentiment in the world. *Judt: :\\"In many parts of the world this is in danger of becoming a self-fulfilling assertion: Israel's reckless behavior and insistent identification of all criticism with anti-Semitism is now the leading source of anti-Jewish sentiment in Western Europe and much of Asia. But the traditional corollary - if anti-Jewish feeling is linked to dislike of Israel then right-thinking people should rush to Israel's defense - no longer applies. Instead, the ironies of the Zionist dream have come full circle: For tens of millions of people in the world today, Israel is indeed the state of all the Jews. And thus, reasonably enough, many observers believe that one way to take the sting out of rising anti-Semitism in the suburbs of Paris or the streets of Jakarta would be for Israel to give the Palestinians back their land.\\" *See also Finkelstein, p xxxv: :\\"In a feature Haaretz article marking the fifty-eighth anniversary of Israel's founding, a leading American-Jewish academic now gives expression to the identical analysis: 'Israel's reckless behavior and insistent identification of all criticism with anti-Semitism' Tony Judt writes, 'is now the leading source of anti-Jewish sentiment in Western Europe and much of Asia …. One way to take the sting out of rising anti-Semitism in the suburbs of Paris or the streets of Jakarta would be force Israel to give the Palestinians back their land'.\\" [Finkelstein is citing Judt] Michael Lerner echos those thoughts and suggests that the continued \\"repression\\" of criticism of Israel may eventually \\"explode\\" in an outburst of genuine anti-Semitism. Lerner: :\\"When this bubble of repression of dialogue explodes into open resentment at the way Jewish Political correctness has been imposed, it may really yield a \\"new\\" anti-Semitism. To prevent that, the voices of dissent on Israeli policy must be given the same national exposure in the media and American politics that the voices of the Jewish establishment have been given.... We hope that the creation of our interfaith Network of Spiritual Progressives (NSP at spiritualprogressives.org) can provide a safe context for this kind of discussion among the many Christians, Muslims, Unitarians, Hindus, Buddhists and secular-but-not-religious people who share some of the criticisms of Israel and who will eventually try to challenge the kind of anti-Semitism that might be released against Jews once the resentment about Jewish Political Correctness on Israel does explode.\\" Attacking the messenger rather than the message Michael Lerner claims that some supporters of Israel refuse to discuss legitimate criticisms of Israel (such as comparisons with apartheid) and instead attack the people who raise such criticisms, thus deliberately \\"shifting the discourse to the legitimacy of the messenger and thus avoiding the substance of the criticisms\\". Lerner: :\\"The Anti-Defamation League sponsored a conference on this same topic in San Francisco on January 28, conspicuously failing to invite Tikkun, Jewish Voices for Peace and Brit Tzedeck ve Shalom, the three major Jewish voices critiquing Israeli policy, yet also strong supporters of Israel's security. Meanwhile, the media has been abuzz with stories of Jews denouncing former President Jimmy Carter for his book Palestine: Peace or Apartheid. The same charges of anti-Semitism that have consistently been launched against anyone who criticizes Israeli policy is now being launched against the one American leader who managed to create a lasting (albeit cold) peace between Israel and a major Arab state (Egypt). Instead of seriously engaging with the issues raised (e.g. to what extent are Israel's current policies similar to those of apartheid and to what extent are they not?), the Jewish establishment and media responds by attacking the people who raise these or any other critiques --shifting the discourse to the legitimacy of the messenger and thus avoiding the substance of the criticisms. Knowing this, many people become fearful that they too will be labeled \\"anti-Semitic\\" if they question the wisdom of Israeli policies or if they seek to organize politically to challenge those policies.\\" Exaggerating the equation in order to draw sympathy Alan Dershowitz distinguishes between legitimate criticism of Israel and anti-Semitism, but he claims that some \\"enemies of Israel\\" encourage the equation of the two, because it makes the enemies appear to be victims of false accusations of anti-Semitism, which the enemies use in an attempt to gain sympathy for their cause. Dershowitz: The Case Against Israel's Enemies, pp 3-4: :\\"No one should ever confuse criticism of Israel or of Israeli policies with anti-Semitism. And no one should ever accuse mere critics of Israel with anti-Semitism. If criticism of Israel or Israeli policies constituted anti-Semitism then the highest concentration of anti-Semites would be in Israel, where everybody is a critic… The claim that critics of Israel are branded as anti-Semites is a straw man and a fabrication of Israel's enemies who seek to play the victim card. Yet this big lie persists. Susannah Heschel, a professor of Jewish studies at Dartmouth, has charged, 'We often hear that criticism of Israel is equivalent to anti-Semitism'. Michael Lerner, the editor of Tikkun, has made a similar charge. So has Noam Chomsky. More recently, a vocal professor at Harvard, Lorand Matory, has made this accusation…. Thomas Friedman of the New York Times [wrote]… 'Criticizing Israel is not anti-Semitism, and saying so is vile. But singling out Israel for opprobrium and international sanction - out of all proportion to any other party in the Middle East - is anti-Semitism, and no saying so is dishonest.\\" Suppression of criticism A number of commentators have debated whether public criticism of Israel is suppressed outside of Israel, particularly within the United States. Stephen Zunes writes that \\"assaults on critics of Israeli policies have been more successful in limiting open debate, but this gagging censorship effect stems more from ignorance and liberal guilt than from any all-powerful Israel lobby.\\"Stephen Zunes, The Israel Lobby: How Powerful is it Really? , Foreign Policy in Focus, May 16, 2006. Retrieved August 27, 2006. He goes on to explain that while \\"some criticism of Israel really is rooted in anti-Semitism,\\" it is his opinion that some members of the Israel lobby cross the line by labeling intellectually honest critics of Israel as anti-Semitic. Zunes argues that the mainstream and conservative Jewish organizations have \\"created a climate of intimidation against many who speak out for peace and human rights or who support the Palestinians' right of self-determination.\\" Zunes has been on the receiving end of this criticism himself: \\"As a result of my opposition to US support for the Israeli government's policies of occupation, colonization and repression, I have been deliberately misquoted, subjected to slander and libel, and falsely accused of being \\"anti-Semitic\\" and \\"supporting terrorism\\"; my children have been harassed and my university's administration has been bombarded with calls for my dismissal.\\" In an opinion piece for The Guardian, Jimmy Carter wrote that mainstream American politics does not give equal time to the Palestinian side of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and that this is due at least in part to AIPAC.Jimmy Carter, Israel, Palestine, peace and apartheid, Guardian Newspaper George Soros has claimed that there are risks associated with what was in his opinion a suppression of debate: > \\"I do not subscribe to the myths propagated by enemies of Israel and I am > not blaming Jews for anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism predates the birth of > Israel. Neither Israel's policies nor the critics of those policies should > be held responsible for anti-Semitism. At the same time, I do believe that > attitudes toward Israel are influenced by Israel's policies, and attitudes > toward the Jewish community are influenced by the pro-Israel lobby's success > in suppressing divergent views.\\"Soros, George. \\"On Israel, America and > AIPAC.\\" New York Review of Books, April 12, 2007. On the other hand, in his book, The Deadliest Lies, Abraham Foxman referred to the notion that the pro-Israel lobby is trying to censor criticism of Israel as a \\"canard.\\"Foxman, Abraham. “The deadliest lies: the Israel lobby ....” Google Books. 20 July 2009. Foxman writes that the Jewish community is capable of telling the difference between legitimate criticism of Israel \\"and the demonization, delegitimization, and double standards employed against Israel that is either inherently anti-Semitic or generates an environment of anti- Semitism.\\" Jonathan Rosenblum expressed similar thoughts: \\"Indeed, if there were an Israel lobby, and labeling all criticism of Israel as anti-Semitic were its tactic, the steady drumbeat of criticism of Israel on elite campuses and in the elite press would be the clearest proof of its inefficacy.\\"Rosenblum, Jonathan. \\"Paper on ‘Israel Lobby’ Poses Threat.\\" Jewish Journal. 27 April 2006. 20 July 2009. Alan Dershowitz wrote that he welcomes \\"reasoned, contextual and comparative criticism of Israeli policies and actions.\\"Dershowitz, Alan. \\"The Big New Lie.\\" Alan M. Dershowitz. 20 July 2009. If one of the goals of the pro-Israel lobby was to censor criticism of Israel, Dershowitz writes, \\"it would prove that 'the Lobby' is a lot less powerful than the authors would have us believe.\\" =Criticism stifled by accusations of antisemitism= Several commentators have asserted that supporters of Israel attempt to stifle legitimate criticism of Israel by unfairly labeling critics as antisemitic. Norman Finkelstein author of Beyond Chutzpah: On the Misuse of Anti-Semitism and the Abuse of History One of the major themes of Norman Finkelstein's book Beyond Chutzpah: On the Misuse of Anti-Semitism and the Abuse of History is that some supporters of Israel employ accusations of anti-Semitism to attack critics of Israel, with the goal of discrediting the critics and silencing the criticism.Finkelstein. This is a major theme of the book, but is especially discussed in the Introduction and chapter 1. Professors Judy Rebick and Alan Sears, in response to Israel Apartheid Week activities at Carleton University, wrote an open letter to the University president which claimed that accusations of anti-Semitism are sometimes made with the goal of \\"silencing\\" criticism of Israel.Sears, Alan and Rebick, Judy, \\"Memo to Minister Kenney: Criticism of Israel is not anti- Semitism\\", online: \\"Defenders of Israeli policy routinely attempt to direct our attention to abuses happening in other places and insist that a hidden agenda must underlie any focus on Israeli brutality in this unjust world. This argument would lead to paralysis in human rights activism by claiming that one must address all cases at once, or only the \\"worst\\" cases. Should we have told Rosa Parks, who refused to go the back of a segregated bus in Alabama in 1955, to quit whining as conditions were even worse in South Africa, or colonized Kenya, or for that matter for Palestinians in refugee camps? The deployment of anti-Semitism as an accusation to silence criticism of Israel is also a serious setback in genuine struggles against anti-Semitism and other forms of discrimination. It is based on a claim that the State of Israel is the single outcome of the history of the Jewish people, the final end of generations of diasporic existence. It attempts to make the Zionist project of a Jewish nation the only legitimate project for all Jews.\\" They were writing regarding Israel Apartheid Week controversy described in Haaretz. Journalist Peter Beaumont also claims that some proponents of the concept of New Antisemitism conflate criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism.Beaumont, Peter, \\"The new anti-semitism?\\", The Observer, February 17, 2002: \\"But the problem with all this talk of a 'new anti-Semitism' is that those who argue hardest for its inexorable rise are dangerously conflating two connected but critically separate phenomena. The monster that they have conjured from these parts is not only something that does not yet exist - and I say 'yet' with caution - but whose purported existence is being cynically manipulated by some in the Israeli government to try to silence debate about the policies of the Sharon government…. As data collected by the Stephen Roth Institute at Tel Aviv University, and other research, makes clear, the rise in anti-Semitism in Europe coincided with the beginning of al-Aqsa intifada - and Israel's heavy- handed response…. What they are talking about is the criticism in the media and political classes of Europe of the policies of Sharon. Israel's brutal response to the often equally reprehensible anti-Israeli Palestinian violence of the intifada has produced one of the most vigorous media critiques of Israel's policies in the European media in a generation. The reply to this criticism, say those most vocal in reporting the existence of the new anti- Semitism, particularly in the Israeli press, is devastating in its simplicity: criticise Israel, and you are an anti-Semite just as surely as if you were throwing paint at a synagogue in Paris.\\" Tariq Ali, a British-Pakistani historian and political activist, argues that the concept of new antisemitism amounts to an attempt to subvert the language in the interests of the State of Israel. He writes that the campaign against \\"the supposed new 'anti-semitism'\\" in modern Europe is a \\"cynical ploy on the part of the Israeli Government to seal off the Zionist state from any criticism of its regular and consistent brutality against the Palestinians.... Criticism of Israel can not and should not be equated with anti-semitism.\\" He argues that most pro-Palestinian, anti- Zionist groups that emerged after the Six-Day War were careful to observe the distinction between anti-Zionism and antisemitism.Ali, Tariq. \\"Notes on Anti- Semitism, Zionism and Palestine\\" , Counterpunch, March 4, 2004, first published in il manifesto, February 26, 2004. Jewish Voice for Peace has spoken against what they see as the abuse of the antisemitic label. For example, in an opinion piece, they wrote \\"For decades, some leaders of the Jewish community have made the preposterous claim that there is complete unity of belief and interest between all Jews and the Israeli government, no matter what its policies. They must believe their own propaganda, because they see no difference between criticism of the Israeli government and anti-Semitism, and they do everything they can to silence critical voices. If the brand of anti- Semitism is not sufficiently intimidating, the silencing has been enforced by organized phone and letter-writing campaigns, boycotts, threats of, and actual withdrawal of funding support from 'offending' institutions and individuals.\\" Accusations are public relations efforts John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt claim that the accusations of anti-Semitism leveled at critics of Israel are deliberately timed to defuse the impact of the criticisms. They suggest a pattern where accusations of antisemitism rise immediately following aggressive actions by Israel: following the Six-Day War, following the 1982 Lebanon War, and following exposure of \\"brutal behavior in the Occupied Territories\\" in 2002.Mearsheimer and Walt, p 190: \\"Supporters of Israel have a history of using fears of a \\"new antiSemitism\\" to shield Israel from criticism. In 1974, when Israel was under increasing pressure to withdraw from the lands it had conquered in 1967, Arnold Forster and Benjamin Epstein of the ADL published The New Anti-Semitism, which argued that anti-Semitism was on the rise and exemplified by the growing unwillingness of other societies to support Israel's actions. In the early 1980s, when the invasion of Lebanon and Israel's expanding settlements triggered additional criticisms, and when U.S. arms sales to its Arab allies were hotly contested, then ADL head Nathan Perlmutter and his wife, Ruth Ann Perlmutter, released The Real Anti-Semitism in America, which argued that anti-Semitism was on its way back, as shown by the pressure on Israel to make peace with the Arabs and by events like the sale of AWACS aircraft to Saudi Arabia. The Perlmutters also suggested that many \\"anti-Semitic\\" actions, which they define as acts not motivated by hostility to Jews, may nonetheless harm Jewish interests (and especially Israel's well-being), and could easily bring back genuine anti-Semitism. The troubling logic of this argument is revealed by the fact that there was little mention of anti-Semitism during the 1990s, when Israel was involved in the Oslo peace process. Indeed, one Israeli scholar wrote in 1995 that 'never before, at least since the time Christianity seized power over the Roman Empire, has anti-Semitism been less significant than at present'. Charges of anti-Semitism became widespread only in the spring of 2002, when Israel came under severe criticism around the world for its brutal behavior in the Occupied Territories. … Natan Sharansky, the former Soviet dissident who is now a prominent Israeli author and politician, declares, 'The new anti- Semitism appears in the guise of 'political criticism of Israel', consisting of a discriminating approach and double standard towards the state of the Jews, while questioning its right to exist.' The implication is that any one who criticizes Israel's actions … is opposed to its existence and is therefore hostile to Jews. But this is a bogus charge, because it conflates criticism of Israel's actions with the rejection of Israel's legitimacy.\\" Norman Finkelstein says that to further a public relations campaign, apologists for Israel make accusations of what they call a \\"new anti-Semitism\\" against those they oppose, and that they do so deliberately in order to undermine critics and bolster the nation's image. Finkelstein: *page xxxiii: :\\"The 'new anti- Semitism' is a spin-off of the Holocaust industry. Whenever Israel comes under international pressure to resolve its conflict with the Palestinians diplomatically or faces a public relations debacle, its apologists mount a campaign alleging that the world is awash in a new anti-Semitism. … the purpose of these periodic extravaganzas is not hard to find: on the one hand, the perpetrators are turned into the victims, putting the spotlight on the alleged suffering of Jews today and diverting it from the real suffering of Palestinians; on the other hand, they discredit all criticism of Israeli policy as motived by an irrational loathing of Jews.\\" *page 16: :\\"To evade the obvious, another stratagem of the Israel's lobby is playing The Holocaust and 'new anti-Semitism' cards. In a previous study, I examined how the Nazi holocaust had been fashioned into an ideological weapon to immunize Israel from legitimate criticism. In this book I look at a variant of this Holocaust card, namely, the 'new anti-Semitism'. In fact, the allegation of a new anti- Semitism is neither new nor about anti-Semitism. Whenever Israel comes under renewed international pressure to withdraw from occupied territories, its apologists mount yet another meticulously orchestrated media extravaganza alleging that the world is awash in anti-Semitism. This shameless exploitation of anti-Semitism delegitimizes criticism of Israel, makes Jews rather than Palestinians the victims, and puts the onus on the Arab world to rid itself of anti-Semitism rather than on Israel to rid itself of the Occupied Territories. A close examination of what the Israel lobby tallies as anti-Semitism reveals three components: exaggeration and fabrication; mislabeling legitimate criticism of Israeli policy; and the unjustified yet predictable 'spillover' from criticism of Israel to Jews generally.\\" Finkelstein also asserts that \\"American Jewish organizations\\" purposefully increase vocal accusations of anti-Semitism during episodes when Israel is coming under increased criticism (such as the during the Intifada), with the goal of discrediting critics of Israel. Finkelstein: :\\"Whenever Israel faces a public relations debacle such as the Intifada or international pressure to resolve the Israel-Palestine conflict, American Jewish organizations orchestrate this extravaganza called the 'new anti-Semitism.' The purpose is several-fold. First, it is to discredit any charges by claiming the person is an anti-Semite. It's to turn Jews into the victims, so that the victims are not the Palestinians any longer. As people like Abraham Foxman of the ADL put it, the Jews are being threatened by a new holocaust. It's a role reversal – the Jews are now the victims, not the Palestinians. So it serves the function of discrediting the people leveling the charge. It's no longer Israel that needs to leave the Occupied Territories; it's the Arabs who need to free themselves of the anti- Semitism.\\" Critics of Israel who have been accused of antisemitism Critics of Israel who have been accused of antisemitism and have denied the allegation include Ralph Nader, John Mearsheimer, Cindy Sheehan, Jenny Tonge, Ken Livingstone, Desmond Tutu, and Helen Thomas. Professor J. Lorand Matory is a vocal critic of Israel who supports disinvestment from Israel. Larry Summers, president of Harvard, called efforts by Matory and others to divest from Israel \\"anti-Semitic in effect, if not intent.\\" According to Matory, \\"the knee jerk accusation that targeted criticism of Israel singles out Israel is as absurd as stating that the anti-apartheid movement was singling out South Africa.\\" Professor Noam Chomsky argues that Israel's foreign minister Abba Eban equated anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism in an effort to \\"exploit anti- racist sentiment for political ends\\", citing statement Eban made in 1973: \\"One of the chief tasks of any dialogue with the Gentile world is to prove that the distinction between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism is not a distinction at all.\\" Commenting on Eban's statement, Chomsky replied: \\"That is a convenient stand. It cuts off a mere 100 percent of critical comment!\\"Quoted by Menachem Wecker, \\"In Defense of Self-Hating Jews\\", May 2007, Jewish Currents, online at . In 2002, Chomsky wrote that this equation of anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism was being extended to criticism of Israeli policies, not just criticism of Zionism. Chomsky also wrote that, when the critics of Israel are Jewish, the accusations of anti-Semitism involve descriptions of self-hatred. *Chomsky, Necessary Illusions, p 316: :\\"There have long been efforts to identify anti- Semitism and anti-Zionism in an effort to exploit anti-racist sentiment for political ends; 'one of the chief tasks of any dialogue with the Gentile world is to prove that the distinction between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism is not a distinction at all,' Israeli diplomat Abba Eban argued, in a typical expression of this intellectually and morally disreputable position (Eban, Congress Bi-Weekly, March 30, 1973). But that no longer suffices. It is now necessary to identify criticism of Israeli policies as anti-Semitism -- or in the case of Jews, as 'self-hatred,' so that all possible cases are covered.\\" In 2004, Chomsky said \\"If you identify the country, the people, the culture with the rulers, accept the totalitarian doctrine, then yeah, it's anti- Semitic to criticize the Israeli policy, and anti-American to criticize the American policy, and it was anti-Soviet when the dissidents criticized Russian policy. You have to accept deeply totalitarian assumptions not to laugh at this.\\" However, Oliver Kamm contends that Chomsky inaccurately interpreted Eban's comments.Quoted by Oliver Kamm http://oliverkamm.typepad.com/blog/2005/02/chomsky_antisem.html \\"Chomsky, antisemitism and intellectual standards\\" \\"But note that by 2002, in his remarks to the Scottish Palestine Solidarity Campaign, Chomsky is giving a flatly different account of Eban’s argument. What Eban is saying in the genuine quotation is that the denial of Israel’s statehood is equivalent to antisemitism. This is not at all the same thing as claiming that criticism of Israeli policies is equivalent to antisemitism. Chomsky’s interpolation – “By anti-Zionism he meant criticisms of the current policies of the State of Israel” – is not remotely supportable from the quotation. Chomsky has doctored his source in order to set up a straw man.\\" Musician Roger Waters is a critic of Israel's treatment of Palestinians, and was accused by the ADL of using anti-Semitic imagery in one of his recent musical productions. Waters responded by stating that the ADL regularly portrays critics of Israel as anti-Semitic, and that \\"it is a screen they [the ADL] hide behind\\". *Smith, Lewis, \\"Anti-Semitic? Not me, says Roger Waters\\", The Independent, 4 October 2010, online: :\\"Abraham Foxman, the director of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), said using the dollar sign and the Star of David in sequence [during Water's performance] echoed the stereotype that Jews were avaricious. Referring to criticism Waters has previously made of Israel for its treatment of the Palestinians, Mr. Foxman said the musician should have 'chosen some other way to convey his political views without playing into and dredging up the worst age-old anti-Semitic stereotype about Jews and their supposed obsession with making money'. … [Waters replied:] 'If I don't respond [to the suggestion of antisemitism] people will see the story and will come to believe I'm anti-Semitic, and I'm not. Nothing could be further from the truth….' Waters has spoken against Israeli policies and accused the ADL of painting critics as anti-Semitic. 'It's a screen that they hide behind. I don't think they should be taken seriously on that. You can attack Israeli policy without being anti-Jewish,' he [Waters] said.\\" Desmond Tutu In 2002 Desmond Tutu is a critic of Israel who has compared Israel's policies to apartheid South Africa. Tutu wrote that criticism of Israel is suppressed in the United States, and that criticisms of Israel are \\"immediately dubbed anti-Semitic\\". * Tutu, Desmond, “Apartheid in the Holy Land,” The Guardian (Britain), April 29, 2002. online :\\" I've been very deeply distressed in my visit to the Holy Land; it reminded me so much of what happened to us black people in South Africa. I have seen the humiliation of the Palestinians at checkpoints and roadblocks, suffering like us when young white police officers prevented us from moving about.... But you know as well as I do that, somehow, the Israeli government is placed on a pedestal [in the US], and to criticise it is to be immediately dubbed anti-semitic, as if the Palestinians were not semitic. I am not even anti-white, despite the madness of that group. And how did it come about that Israel was collaborating with the apartheid government on security measures? People are scared in this country [the US], to say wrong is wrong because the Jewish lobby is powerful - very powerful.\\" Michael Prior was a vocal critic of Israel's treatment of Palestinians, and who was frequently accused of anti- Semitism, yet he was careful to distinguish between anti-Zionism and anti- Semitism. *\\"Father Michael Prior: Roman Catholic priest and scholar who campaigned for the rights of Palestinians\\", in The Times, 21 August 2004, online: :\\"In an interview in Witness in 2003, Father Prior said: “The God they portray looks to me to be a militaristic and xenophobic genocide who would not be even sufficiently moral to conform to the Fourth Geneva Convention. How, I constantly ask myself, are such people so unconcerned about others being kicked out of their homes, children being shot, people struggling for survival against very oppressive forces of occupation?” Needless to say, he was sometimes accused of being anti-Semitic. But he was careful to distinguish between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism. He believed that Muslims, Jews and Christians could and should live in equality and harmony. In his last article, published in The Tablet shortly before his death, he warned that the Catholic- Jewish liaison committee’s decision to equate antiZionism with anti-Semitism was a grave mistake. He was convinced that Zionism flew in the face of the Hebrew Scriptures.\\" *See also: \\"Professor Michael Prior: Controversial priest and theologian who was an outspoken supporter of Palestinian rights\\" in The Independent, online Ken Livingstone, former mayor of the City of London, was accused of antisemitism for a variety of comments, including remarks criticizing Israel's treatment of Palestinians. In response, Livingstone wrote \\"For 20 years Israeli governments have attempted to portray anyone who forcefully criticizes the policies of Israel as anti-semitic. The truth is the opposite: the same universal human values that recognize the Holocaust as the greatest racist crime of the 20th century require condemnation of the policies of successive Israeli governments - not on the absurd grounds that they are Nazi or equivalent to the Holocaust, but because ethnic cleansing, discrimination and terror are immoral.\\" Peace activist Cindy Sheehan claims she has been improperly accused of being anti-Semitic because of her anti-war position, particularly her criticism of the Israel lobby and Israel's actions towards Palestinians. Sheehan emphasized that her criticism of Israel is \\"not to be construed as hatred of all Jews\\". *Sheehan, Cindy, \\"The Audacity of Israel\\" on Cindy Sheehan's Soapbox online blog, June 4, 2010. :\\"Since my son was killed in Iraq and I have come to prominence in the peace movement, the name I am called with the second highest frequency (behind “anti-American”) is “anti-Semitic.\\" First of all, isn’t it interesting if one is anti-violence and pro-peace, that automatically makes one anti-American and anti-Semitic? That just tells us that violence and oppression are so inherently institutionalized in our cultures, that if one is against these things, that makes one against the entire culture, race or way of life. It should be fundamentally understood that criticism of Israel’s program of Palestinian pogrom and the US’s demented foreign policy is not to be construed as hatred of all Jews or all Americans.\\" =Critics that suggest censorship or suppression= Political scientists John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt wrote an article critical of the Israel lobby in the United States, in which they asserted that the Israel lobby uses accusations of anti-Semitism as a part of a deliberate strategy to suppress criticism of Israel. Mearsheimer and Walt themselves were accused of anti- Semitism as a result of that article and the book they wrote based on the article. *Harrison, pp 194-195: :\\"… Mearsheimer and Walt were widely accused of anti-Semitism and responded forcefully that, in their opinion, such accusations were baseless and were being leveled purely in order to suppress legitimate criticism of Israel and its supporters…. [their] thesis includes as a subordinate contention the claim that the Israel lobby uses the accusation of anti-Semitism purely as a tool to suppress criticism of Israel. All talk of a 'new anti-Semitism' is asserted to be part of a deliberate strategy: 'Israel's advocates, when pressed to go beyond mere assertion, claim that there is a new anti-Semitism which they equate with criticism of Israel. In other words, criticise Israeli policy, and you are by definition an anti- semite'.\\" *Harrison is quoting from Mearsheimer and Walt's 2006 article \\"The Israel Lobby\\" published in London Review of Books, vol 28, no. 6, 23 March 2006. Jenny Tonge, member of the UK House of Lords, has frequently criticized Israel's policies, and has been labelled antisemitic. In response, she said during a speech in Parliament: \\"I'm beginning to understand ... the vindictive actions the Israel lobby [and] AIPAC ... take against people who oppose and criticize the lobby.... [I understand] ... the constant accusations of antisemitism - when no such sentiment exists - to silence Israel's critics.\\" Ralph Nader Ralph Nader, United States politician and consumer advocate, has criticized Israel's policies, expressed support for Palestinian causes, and criticized the excessive influence of the Israel lobby on the U. S. government. In response, Nader wrote a letter to the director of the Anti- Defamation League entitled \\"Criticizing Israel is Not Anti-Semitism\\" in which he said \\"Your mode of operation for years has been to make charges of racism or insinuation of racism designed to slander and evade. Because your pattern of making such charges, carefully calibrated for the occasion but of the same stigmatizing intent, has served to deter critical freedom of speech.... The ADL should be working toward this objective [peace] and not trying to suppress realistic discourse on the subject with epithets and innuendos.\\"Nader, Ralph, \\"A Letter to Abraham Foxman: Criticizing Israel is Not Anti-Semitism\\", in Counterpunch, 16 October 2004, online William I. Robinson, a professor at UCSB, was accused of being antisemitic due to a class assignment that revolved around Israel's attack on the Gaza strip, and he replied by stating that the Israel lobby labels \\"any criticism\\" of Israel as anti-Semitic In response, Robinson said: \\"The fact that I did include my interpretation of the Israeli- Palestinian conflict is totally within what is normal and expected.... One of the most pressing affairs of January was the Israeli assault on Gaza - there was nothing that could be more relevant to this course at that time. When you bring up delicate, sensitive, inflammatory, controversial material in the classroom, we as professors are carrying out our mission to jar students in order to challenge them to think critically about world issues.... The Israel lobby is possibly the most powerful lobby in the United States, and what they do is label any criticism of anti-Israeli conduct and practices as anti- Semitic\\" Robinson said. \\"This campaign is not just an attempt to punish me. The Israel lobby is stepping up its vicious attacks on anyone who would speak out against Israeli policies.\\" Rosenfeld, Elliot, \\"Investigation of Professor Forges Ahead\\", Daily Nexus, online Dr. Steven Salaita, an American expert on comparative literature and post-colonialism, became embroiled in a controversy regarding freedom of speech for faculty at American universities when his offer of employment was withdrawn from UIUC by Chancellor Dr. Phyllis Wise, a move some regard as an infringement on Salaita's freedom of speech. During the 2014 conflict between Israel and Gaza, he had published tweets that were seen as criticism of the Israeli government, Prof. Fired for Criticism of Israel Files Federal Lawsuit Salon, 31 Jan 2015 and Salaita claims that as a result, pro-Israel advocates associated with the university accused him of anti- Semitism and pressured the university to rescind its offer of employment to him. As a result of his outspoken critique of the university's handling of his situation, Haaretz notes that Salaita has established \\"celebrity status on the lecture circuit.\\"\\"Alexander, Netta 'I am no anti-Semite' says Steven Salaita, lecturer-cum celeb who was fired for tweeting: A few rude anti-Israel tweets during the Gaza war cost Dr. Steven Salaita an academic appointment, but earned him celebrity status on the lecture circuit. So, is there still freedom of speech in the U.S.?' (Dec 5, 2014) Haaretz\\" http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/.premium-1.630098 In November 2015, Salaita and UIUC reached a settlement which included a payment of $600,000 to Salaita and covering his attorney's costs; the university did not admit any wrongdoing. Responses to criticism =Claims of media bias= Mudar Zahran, a Jordanian of Palestinian heritage, writes that the \\"tendency to blame Israel for everything\\" has provided Arab leaders an excuse to deliberately ignore the human rights of the Palestinian in their countries. As an example, he said that while the world is furious over the blockade on Gaza, the media choose to deliberately ignore the conditions of the Palestinians living in refugee camps in Lebanon and other Arab countries.Demonizing Israel is bad for the Palestinians, by Mudar Zarhan, 01/08/2010, Jerusalem Post George Will claims that the \\"blame Israel first (and last, and in between) brigade\\" is \\"large and growing\\".The leveling wind: politics, the culture, and other news, 1990-1994. George Will. Viking, 1994. p. 336 =Claims of United Nations bias= The United Nations has never condemned China's occupation of Tibet or recognized the Tibetans' right to self-determination. Alan Dershowitz finds the UN position hypocritical, as he concludes China's occupation of Tibet has been longer, more brutal, deadlier and less justified than Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. =Foreign Ministry= Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel) has encouraged the use of social media to counteract criticism of Israel's policies. One member of the diplomatic corps proposed more aggressive action regarding Israel's critics. In June 2012, Israel's Channel 10 published an e-mail in which Nurit Tinari-Modai, deputy head of Israel's mission in Ireland and wife of the ambassador, Boaz Moda'i, proposed harassing expatriate Israelis who criticized Israeli policies, posting photos of them and publishing disinformation that would embarrass them. She claimed that they were critical of Israel because of their sexual identity. Following the publicity about Tinari-Modai's tactics, the Foreign Ministry quickly distanced itself from her letter. Her recommendation included the following :\\"You have to try and hit their soft underbellies, to publish their photographs, maybe that will cause embarrassment from their friends in Israel and their family, hoping that local activists would understand that they may actually be working on behalf of Mossad.\\"\\"Round, Simon 'Israeli envoy: activists have 'sexual identity problems (June 14, 2012) The Jewish Chronicle\\"http://www.thejc.com/news/world-news/68791/israeli-envoy-activists- have-sexual-identity-problems\\"Silver, Jonny 'Israel’s Ireland embassy: Hitler would have liked the UN' (Aug. 6, 2013) Haaretz\\"http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/.premium-1.540074 =Israeli public opinion= International criticism is an important focus within Israel. According to an August 2010 survey by Tel Aviv University, more than half of Israelis believe \\"the whole world is against us\\", and three quarters of Israelis believe \\"that no matter what Israel does or how far it goes towards resolving the conflict with the Palestinians, the world will continue to criticize Israel\\". As a result, public diplomacy has been an important focus of Israeli governments since Independence. The Israeli Ministry of Public Diplomacy & Diaspora Affairs seeks to explain government policies and promote Israel in the face of what they consider negative press about Israel around the world. =Criminalization of Nazi comparisons= The EISCA Report recommends that the British government criminalize certain kinds of anti- Semitism, particularly use of the Nazi analogy to criticize Israel, as well as other forms of criticism of Israel.Igansky, EISCA Report, pp 28-30 Paul Craig Roberts and Antony Lerman have questioned the recommendations of the EISCA report, expressing concerns that the recommendations of the report may be adopted as a hate-crime law within Europe, which may lead to infringement of free speech, and may criminalize legitimate criticism of Israel. Author Paul Craig Roberts is opposed to legislation in the United States will make it a crime to criticize Israel, and as examples he cites the Global Anti-Semitism Review Act of 2004 and the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009. Roberts asserts that lobbyists for Israel are pressing for laws that will make it a crime to discuss the power of the Israel lobby, or to discuss alleged war crimes of Israel.Roberts, Paul Craig, \\"Criminalizing Criticism of Israel\\", Counterpunch 7 May 2009, online: :\\"On October 16, 2004, President George W. Bush signed the Israel Lobby’s bill, the Global Anti-Semitism Review Act. This legislation requires the US Department of State to monitor anti-semitism world wide. To monitor anti-semitism, it has to be defined. What is the definition? Basically, as defined by the Israel Lobby and Abe Foxman, it boils down to any criticism of Israel or Jews. Rahm Israel Emanuel hasn’t been mopping floors at the White House. As soon as he gets the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 passed, it will become a crime for any American to tell the truth about Israel’s treatment of Palestinians and theft of their lands. It will be a crime for Christians to acknowledge the New Testament's account of Jews demanding the crucifixion of Jesus. It will be a crime to report the extraordinary influence of the Israel Lobby on the White House and Congress, such as the AIPAC-written resolutions praising Israel for its war crimes against the Palestinians in Gaza that were endorsed by 100 per cent of the US Senate and 99 per cent of the House of Representatives, while the rest of the world condemned Israel for its barbarity. It will be a crime to doubt the Holocaust. It will become a crime to note the disproportionate representation of Jews in the media, finance, and foreign policy. In other words, it means the end of free speech, free inquiry, and the First Amendment to the Constitution. Any facts or truths that cast aspersion upon Israel will simply be banned…. Criminalizing criticism of Israel destroys any hope of America having an independent foreign policy in the Middle East that serves American rather than Israeli interests. It eliminates any prospect of Americans escaping from their enculturation with Israeli propaganda. To keep American minds captive, the Lobby is working to ban as anti-semitic any truth or disagreeable fact that pertains to Israel. It is permissible to criticize every other country in the world, but it is anti-semitic to criticize Israel, and anti-semitism will soon be a universal hate-crime in the Western world. Most of Europe has already criminalized doubting the Holocaust. It is a crime even to confirm that it happened but to conclude that less than 6 million Jews were murdered.\\" Antony Lerman criticized the 2009 EISCA report, and claims that criminalizing criticism of Israel (particularly, comparing Israel actions to Nazi actions) would constitute an excessive infringement of freedom of speech in Britain, postulating, for example, that \\"if you said 'the way the IDF operated in Gaza was like the way the SS acted in Poland', and a Jew found this offensive, hurtful or harmful, you could, in theory, go to jail.\\"Lerman, \\"Should We Ban..\\": :\\"Using Nazi analogies to criticise Israel and Zionism is offensive, but should it be banned, criminalized or branded as antisemitic? … The authors of a new report, Understanding and Addressing the \\"Nazi Card\\": Intervening Against Antisemitic Discourse, from the European Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism (EISCA), take a different line.... While the principle that freedom of speech is not absolute is accepted in English law, not all offensive speech is criminalized. So, merely showing that comparing Israeli behaviour to the Nazis is offensive is no reason to outlaw such discourse. The authors try to get round this by arguing that such comparisons are especially offensive to Jews, because of their history. They say: \\"Most people would accept that it's completely unacceptable to call a Jewish person a Nazi.\\" The implication here – that it may, therefore, be acceptable in some circumstances to call a non-Jew a Nazi – is unfortunate to say the least. If one is against the use of Nazi comparisons in public debate, it's unacceptable to call anyone a Nazi. In which case, the argument of exceptional offensiveness for Jews doesn't hold.... The authors write: 'although the playing of the Nazi card is not always antisemitic, it unquestionably always harms'. As a result, where this occurs, it could already be defined as a criminal act, and if not, Iganski and Sweiry say, consideration should be given to changing the law so that it would be. In other words, if you said 'the way the IDF operated in Gaza was like the way the SS acted in Poland', and a Jew found this offensive, hurtful or harmful, you could, in theory, go to jail.\\" =Boycotts and divestment from Israel= Boycotts of Israel are economic and political cultural campaigns or actions that seek a selective or total cutting of ties with the State of Israel. Such campaigns are employed by those who challenge the legitimacy of Israel, Israel's policies or actions towards the Palestinians over the course of the Arab–Israeli and Israeli–Palestinian conflict, oppose Israeli territorial claims in the West Bank or Jerusalem or even oppose Israel's right to exist. Arab boycotts of Zionist institutions and Jewish businesses began before Israel's founding as a state. An official boycott was adopted by the Arab League almost immediately after the formation of the state of Israel in 1948, but is not fully implemented in practice. Similar boycotts have been proposed outside the Arab world and the Muslim world. These boycotts comprise economic measures such as divestment; a consumer boycott of Israeli products or businesses that operate in Israel; a proposed academic boycott of Israeli universities and scholars; and a proposed boycott of Israeli cultural institutions or Israeli sport venues. Many advocates of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign, including Archbishop Desmond Tutu use the 1980s movement against South African apartheid as a model. Disinvestment from Israel is a campaign conducted by religious and political entities which aims to use disinvestment to pressure the government of Israel to put \\"an end to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories captured during the 1967 military campaign.\\" The disinvestment campaign is related to other economic and political boycotts of Israel. A notable campaign was initiated in 2002 and endorsed by South African bishop Desmond Tutu.Israel: Time to Divest. Desmond Tutu, New Internationalist, January / February 2003Of Occupation and Apartheid Do I Divest? , Desmond Tutu, CounterPunch, October 17, 2002 Tutu said that the campaign against Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories and its continued settlement expansion should be modeled on the successful, but controversial, disinvestment campaign previously imposed against South Africa's apartheid system.

Life Armstrong was born in Dublin 23 July 1841. As a boy he was distinguished by his adventurous spirit, romantic temper united with humour and love of frolic, and his passionate delight in music and literature. Long rambles among the Dublin and Wicklow mountains gave inspiration and colour to his verse. At the age of seventeen or eighteen his religious faith yielded before turbulent moods of scepticism; a disappointment in love added to the gloom of this period. In 1859 he entered Trinity College, Dublin, distinguishing himself highly by his compositions in Greek and Latin verse. Immoderate work and intellectual excitement in the spring of 1860 were followed by severe illness; a blood- vessel in the lung burst, and the lung seriously injured. A summer of convalescence was passed in Wicklow, and then he found it possible to trace back his way towards Christian beliefs. He spent the winter of 1860–61, in Jersey — a joyous and fruitful season for him, during which much was seen, felt, and thought. Here began a long correspondence on religious questions with a friend as yet unseen, G. A. Chadwick. Having returned from a delightful visit to Brittany, he left Jersey reluctantly in midsummer 1861, and spent the warmer months of the year in Ireland. On the approach of winter he again returned to Jersey, now accompanied by a younger brother, G. F. Armstrong (professor of English literature at Queen's College, Cork). In April 1862 the brothers started for Normandy, thence visited Paris, and once more returned to Jersey, to bid it a final farewell. Armstrong had now sufficiently recovered to accept a tutorship in the north of Ireland. During his vacation in the summer of 1862, he walked much among the Wicklow mountains, and Avas engaged in writing his poems, \\"The Dargle\\" and \\"landalough\\". In October 1862, now looking forward to the clerical profession, he continued his college course. In April 1863 he read before the Undergraduate Philosophical Society an essay on Shelley, designed partly as a recantation of his earlier antichristian opinions. In May of the same year he was rapidly producing his longest poem, \\"The Prisoner of Mount Saint Michael\\", a romantic tale of passion and crime in blank verse, the landscape and local colour having been furnished by Armstrong's wanderings in France. This was followed by the idyllic poem \\"Ovoca\\", partly dramatic, partly narrative in form. In October 1863 he came into residence at Trinity College, Dublin, and attracted much attention by speeches delivered before the Historical Society, and essays read before the Undergraduate Philosophical Society. Of this latter society he was elected president, and in October 1864 delivered his opening address, 'On Essayists and Essay-writing.' In the winter his health broke down, and he went to reside at Kingstown, where, after an illness of several weeks, he died, 24 February 1865. He was buried at Monkstown, co. Dublin. Works As a memorial of his genius, his college and other friends published the volume Poems by the late Edmund J. Armstrong (Moxon, 1865). It includes the two longer poems named above, with many lyrical pieces which show much ardour of imagination and mastery of verse. A short memoir by Mr. Chadwick is prefixed. His poems appeared in a new edition, with many added pieces, edited by G. F. Armstrong, in 1877 (The Poetical Works of Edmund J. Armstrong, Longmans, Green, and Co.) At the same time, and by the same publishers, were issued a volume of his prose (Essays and Sketches by Edmund J. Armstrong, edited by G. F. Armstrong), including essays on Coleridge, Shelley, Goethe's Mephistopheles, E. A. Poe, essayists and essay-writing,etc. In the Life and Letters of Edmund J. Armstrong, edited by G. F. Armstrong (1877), a portrait is given. An article on Armstrong, by Sir Henry Taylor, appeared in the Edinburgh Review of July 1878.

The Grotto that extends for 426 meters (till now) lies on Ain Wazein-Batloun road, near the northern end of Ain Wazein. The grotto was discovered in 2003. The preparation process lasted three years thanks to personal efforts. The grotto includes a set of passageways, crevices or halls, and vaults of varied width and height. These natural formations resulted from accumulated water and its pressure. The grotto includes many distinct formations of stalagmites and stalactites, and other dangling rock formations. It is one of the most beautiful grottos found in Lebanon, with its varied natural calcareous formations. Ain W Zain Grotto. Ain Wazein natural grotto is considered an important highly visited tourist site. It is situated in a beautiful natural environment. The grotto enjoys a scientific, as well as a historic significance. It is considered to be a continuous underground tourist site, and it serves in discovering the subsurface world. Ain Wazein grotto has beautiful calcareous formations found in its passages and sides. It is possible to organize scientific tours for high school and university students. This is possible because all geologic elements are clear in the grotto. It is possible also to carry out scientific research on its structural features. Cavities and tunnels just like galleries, carved silently by the hands of water in the hollows of earth. Creating worlds of domes, and sculptures is a wonderful work that lasted for a million years. Human hands and imagination did not participate in creating its beauty. Carving and painting schools met together in this grotto, in order to reconcile and embrace in a common cause; to produce a distinguished sculpture added to the worlds of the charming Lebanese nature.

Located in the Chouf region, Mount Lebanon, at 40 km from Beirut and 45 km from Saida, the Establishment’s original role was to fulfill the needs of a region deprived and destroyed by war. By the year 1978, spiritual leader of the Druze community, Shiek Akl Druze, Sheikh Mohammad Abu Chakra founded the “aged home” with the aim to provide superior quality health and residential care for the elderly. Later on, this “home” improved to become an elderly care center serving 75 residents. Since the world is undergoing significant demographic changes. Epidemiological studies indicate that due to the progress of medicine and medical sciences, the percentage of elderly people is expected to increase from 8% currently to 12% by the year 2025. At the moment, and due to the increasing number of elders in the community, the current center cannot provide long term care services those who are in need. The board of trustees and the Establishment’s management have planned for a new geriatric center that would be able to provide inpatient services to 300 residents in addition to outpatient services. The foundation stone was laid on September 2004, and the construction of the new geriatric care center is underway.

Caristico is the current champion, he is the eighth champion overall and he is in his first reign. For over 62 years CMLL controlled the NWA World Middleweight Championship, even after leaving the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) in the late 1980s. Up until 2010 the NWA more or less ignored CMLL's use of the championship, but in March 2010 Blue Demon Jr., the president of the newly formed NWA Mexico, sent letters to CMLL, demanding that they stop promoting the NWA-branded championships since they were not part of the organization. NWA Mexico had previously tried to reclaim the three NWA-branded championships promoted by CMLL, but was ignored by CMLL. Finally, on August 12, 2010, CMLL debuted the new NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship belt and named Averno, the final CMLL-recognized NWA World Middleweight Champion, as the inaugural champion. Background alt= A close of up of a masked wrestler, wearing a blue fabric mask with white horns. In 1933 the Mexican National Middleweight Championship was introduced as Yaqui Joe won it in a tournament. The same year Salvador Lutteroth founded Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (EMLL; \\"Mexican Wrestling Enterprise\\") and would later be allowed to host matches for the Mexican National Middleweight Championship although they did not have exclusive rights to the championship. In either late-1938 or early-1939 Lutteroth and EMLL declared that Gus Kallio, due to holding the National Wrestling Association World Middleweight Championship was also recognized as the World Middleweight Champion in Mexico. On February 19, 1939 Kallio lost the championship to EMLL wrestler Octavio Gaona, to create EMLL's main championship for the middleweight division. In 1952 EMLL joined the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and the middleweight championship was rebranded as the NWA World Middleweight Championship from that point forward. In 1989 EMLL left the NWA because the promoters did not want to deal with the internal politics of the NWA at the time. While they left the NWA they kept promoting the NWA World Middleweight Championship as well as the NWA World Light Heavyweight Championship and the NWA World Welterweight Championship that they had controlled for years. In 1991. EMLL changed their name to \\"Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre\\" (CMLL; \\"World Wrestling Council\\") and began to introduce a number of CMLL branded championships. On December 18, 1991, Blue Panther won the CMLL World Middleweight Championship in a tournament, giving CMLL control of three different middleweight championships at the time. In 1992, then-CMLL promoter Antonio Peña left CMLL along with a number of CMLL wrestlers, and founded rival promotion Asistencia Asesoría y Administración, later known simply as AAA. One of the wrestlers that left CMLL was Octagón, who was the reigning Mexican National Middleweight Champion. The Mexico City Boxing and Wrestling Commission granted AAA the rights to promote the Mexican National Middleweight Championship from that point on. On December 4, 1993, Corazón de León won the NWA World Middleweight Championship on a CMLL show and then took the title with him when he began working in Japan. On November 8, 1994, Último Dragón won the championship and for the next 10 years the title was promoted primarily in Japan. On September 3, 2004, Averno defeated Zumbido to win the vacant championship, bringing it back under CMLL's control. In March 2010, Blue Demon Jr., the president of the newly formed NWA Mexico, reached out to CMLL, demanding that they stop promoting the NWA-branded championships since they were not part of the NWA. While the NWA had previously tried to reclaim the three NWA-branded championships promoted by CMLL, those requests were ignored by CMLL. The promotion did not directly respond to the latest request either; instead the then-NWA Welterweight Champion, Mephisto, commented on the situation, simply stating that the titles belonged to CMLL. Finally, on August 12, 2010, CMLL announced that they were replacing the NWA World Middleweight Championship with the CMLL World Historic Middleweight Championship and named Averno, the final CMLL-recognized NWA World Middleweight Champion, as the inaugural champion. When Averno made his first appearance with the championship it had been rebranded as the \\"NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship\\" (Campeonato Mundial Historico de Peso Medio de la NWA in Spanish). Reigns alt=Color photo of Mexican wrestler Volador Jr. during a match Caristico is the current NWA World Historic Middleweight Champion, having defeated the previous champion, Ultimo Guerrero, on August 21, 2018 in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico. Caristico is the eighth overall champion, with no wrestler holding the championship more than once so far. The championship has not been declared vacant since its creation in 2010 and has been defended in both Mexico and in Japan. Volador Jr. was the shortest reigning champion, holding the title for 45 days in early 2012, while La Sombra currently holds the record for the longest reign, 953 days or over two-and-a-half years. When La Sombra defeated Dragón Rojo Jr. to win the championship during the Fantastica Mania 2013 show in Bunkyo, Tokyo, it marked the first time the championship changed hands outside of Mexico. With his victory on August 31, 2015, Último Guerrero became the oldest wrestler to win the championship, being 43 years, 183 days old, while La Sombra was the youngest wrestler to win the championship, 23 years, 78 days old.

After practising pharmacy at Hampstead, he qualified as a physician, moved to London, and established in 1769, the first dispensary, called the Dispensary for the Infant Poor, supported by contributions, for the relief of poor children. This institution existed for more than twelve years, and it was calculated that 35,000 children were relieved during that time. But it met with small financial support, and in December 1781 it was closed. In 1767, Armstrong published an Essay on the Diseases most Fatal to Infants; a second edition appeared in 1771, and a third edition, dedicated to Queen Charlotte, in 1777. An enlarged edition appeared in 1808, edited by A. P.

The same year he received calls to Clonmel and Strand Street, Dublin (2 October); choosing the latter, he was ordained 25 December 1806 by Dublin Presbytery (non-subscribing) as colleague to John Moody,(b. 11 Dec. 1742, d. 15 July 1813), after whose death William Hamilton Drummond, became (25 December 1815) his colleague. He was one of the founders of the Irish Unitarian Society (1830) and of the Association of Irish Nonsubscribing Presbyterians (1835), and he represented the latter body at the celebration of the tercentenary of the reformation at Geneva in August 1835. In the previous year he had received the degree of DD from the university of Geneva. He was a member of the Royal Irish Academy. He died very suddenly at Stonehouse, Stillorgan Road, Dublin on Wednesday, 4 December 1839, having preached on the previous Sunday, and married a couple that very morning. He married Mary Allman, and left two sons (John Strong Armstrong, A.B., president of the Dublin Historical Society, and Rev. George Allman Armstrong, A.B., originally a barrister, who succeeded him in 1841 at Strand Street) and four daughters. A petition from his widow is printed in Parliamentary Debates on the Dissenters' Chapels Bill, 1844. Works He published: * 'A Discourse on Presbyterian Ordination,' and an 'Appendix, containing some account of the Presbyterian Churches in Dublin,' both included in the 'Ordination Service' for James Martineau, London 1829. * 'The Sin against the Holy Ghost,' London 1836 (sermon before the British and Foreign Unitarian Association). * 'A Sermon vindicating the Principles of Unitarian Christianity,' Dublin, 1838 (a discourse originating in local controversy).

A postmodern interpretation of religion emphasises the key point that religious truth is highly individualistic, subjective, and resides within the individual.Eve, Raymond. \\"Wiccans vs. Creationists: An Empirical Study of How Two Systems of Belief Differ\\". The University of Texas. Eclecticism and non-dogmatic theology According to postmodern philosophy, society is in a state of constant change. There is no absolute version of reality, no absolute truths. Postmodern religion strengthens the perspective of the individual and weakens the strength of institutions and religions that deal with objective realities. Postmodern religion considers that there are no universal religious truths or laws, rather, reality is shaped by social, historical and cultural contexts according to the individual, place and or time. Individuals may seek to draw eclectically on diverse religious beliefs, practices and rituals in order to incorporate these into their own religious world view. In Japan, Shinto and Buddhist ideas are woven together and co-exist. Some people who practice Buddhism may be syncretic in their approach. Syncretism occurs among the Eastern religions.BBC Religions: Postmodernism http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/atheism/types/postmodernism.shtml Similarly, versions of HinduismHatcher, B. (1999).

A postmodern religion can be non-dogmatic, syncretic, and eclectic: in drawing from various faiths and traditions, it challenges the notion of absolute truths. Historical bias History may be written by powerful groups in society, who may marginalise, silence or misrepresent other, less powerful or oppressed groups. As Winston Churchill famously remarked, \\"History is written by the victors.\\"World War 2 in Europe, Africa, and the Americas, with general sources By Loyd E. Lee, Robin D. S. Higham - Page 29. A postmodern interpretation of religion emphasises the importance of questioning and considering historical bias when studying religion from a historical perspective. For example, doctoral studies in religion at Harvard emphasise studying religion using wider contexts of history and comparative studies. It is these \\"wider contexts\\" that makes religion a valid subject of postmodern contemplation.Patton, K.; Ray, B. (2008). A Magic Still Dwells: Comparative Religion in the Postmodern Age, p. 132. University of California Press, Berkeley Studies of religion are often approached from a historical perspective. A postmodern interpretation of a religion acknowledges that history can be represented in an inherently biased way, reinforcing the mainstream ideologies of those in power. Versions of truth Postmodern religion acknowledges and accepts different versions of truth. For example, rituals, beliefs and practices can be invented, transformed, created and reworked based on constantly shifting and changing realities, individual preferences, myths, legends, archetypes, rituals and cultural values and beliefs. Individuals who interpret religion using postmodern philosophy may draw from the histories of various cultures to inform their religious beliefs - they may question, reclaim, challenge and critique representations of religion in history based on the theories of postmodernism, which acknowledge that realities are diverse, subjective and depend on the individual's interests and interpretations.Heelas, Paul (1998) Religion, modernity, and postmodernity - page 4 and 5 Appeal to marginalized groups Members of groups in society who face discrimination or who are marginalized, such as women, the gay community or other ethnic minority groups, may be drawn to postmodern religious thinking. For example, the interpretation of Christianity from a postmodern perspective offers the potential for groups in society, such as the Gay community or women, the ability to connect with a version of reality or truth that does not exclude or marginalize them. A postmodern interpretation of religion may focus on considering a religion without orthodox assumptions (that may reflect power differences in society rather than universal truths). In Semitic Neopaganism, a postmodern approach to this tradition of Neopaganism involves challenging or reclaiming mainstream versions of reality and truth that may be more inclusive of women.Raphael, Melissa (April 1998). \\"Goddess Religion, Postmodern Jewish Feminism, and the Complexity of Alternative Religious Identities\\", ‌Nova Religion, Vol. 1, No. 2, Pages 198–215 (abstract can be found on \\"This paper argues that Jewish Goddess feminism illustrates the complexity of alternative religious identities and their fluid, ambiguous, and sometimes intimate historical, cultural, and religious connections to mainstream religious identities. While Jewish Goddess feminists find contemporary Judaism theologically and politically problematic, thealogy (feminist discourse on the Goddess and the divinity of femaleness) can offer them precisely the sacralization of female generativity that mainstream Judaism cannot\\". Minority groups and the socially or economically disadvantaged may be drawn to follow a postmodern approach to religion, because of the way that postmodern philosophy empowers the individual and provides an \\"emancipatory framework\\"Patricia M.

Postmodern interpretations of religion =Christianity= Interpreting Christianity using theories of postmodernism usually involves finding the balance between acknowledging pluralism, a plurality of views and historical influence on doctrine and avoiding the extremes of postmodernism. John Riggs proposes that postmodernism and Christianity have much to offer each other. He asserts that Christians who have adopted elements of postmodern thinking still need to acknowledge that some notions of reality need to be fixed and real in order to have \\"meaningful claims about vital topics such as ethics and God\\".Riggs, J. (2003). Postmodern Christianity: Doing Theology in the Contemporary World, pp. ix-x. Trinity Press International. An example of a specific religious movement that uses postmodern thinking is the Emerging Church. =Neopaganism= Neopaganism can be interpreted from a postmodern perspective. Postmodern religion can be non-dogmatic, syncretic, eclectic, and draw from various faiths and traditions and challenges the notion of absolute truths. Wicca, the largest tradition of Neopaganism, can be interpreted using postmodern philosophies.Lewis, James (1996). Magic religion and Modern Witchcraft. New York University Press. Page 46, \\"... While premodern themes form the foundation for this movement it is the manner that such themes are reworked to be appropriate in the contemporary context that form the greatest relevance to the significance of Witchcraft as a postmodern form of spirituality\\". Postmodern interpretations of Wicca often lead to the practitioner adopting a more eclectic approach, because the very nature of postmodern theory involves the acceptance of many versions of truth and reality. Eclectic Wicca is the most widely adapted form of Wicca in America todaySmith, Diane.

There he directed PR films and documentary films, while also participating in the \\"Blue Group\\" (Ao no kai) with other Iwanami filmmakers such as Noriaki Tsuchimoto, Shinsuke Ogawa, and Yōichi Higashi, a group that was exploring new paths in documentary. Kuroki left Iwanami after experiencing conflicts with the sponsors of his Hokkaido, My Love (1960), and it was his Record of a Marathon Runner (1964) that helped spark changes in the Japanese documentary world. Kuroki switched to fiction film, independently producing Silence Has No Wings (1966) and showing it at the Art Theatre Guild. He became one of the representative figures of ATG and independent Japanese cinema, and was particularly known for a series of works dealing with the atomic bombings of Japan, such as Tomorrow (1988) and The Face of Jizo (2004). These were in part spurred by his growing up near the city of Nagasaki. Kuroki's work also dealt with his own feelings of guilt from the war, as he felt responsible when some of his fellow students, who had been conscripted to work in a local factory, died in Allied bombings and he did not help.

Her sister ships were , , , , and . Heimdall was built by the Kaiserliche Werft Wilhelmshaven shipyard between 1891 and 1894, and was armed with a main battery of three guns. She served in the German fleet throughout the 1890s and was rebuilt in 1900-1902\\\\. She served in the VI Battle Squadron after the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, but saw no action. Heimdall was demobilized in 1915 and used as a barracks ship thereafter. She was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1921. Design Line-drawing of in 1910 In the late 1880s, the German Kaiserliche Marine grappled with the problem of what type of capital ship to build in the face of limited naval budgets (owing to parliamentary objections to naval spending and the cost of dredging the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal). General Leo von Caprivi, the new Chef der Admiralität (Chief of the Admiralty), requested a series of design proposals, which ranged in size from small coastal defense ships to heavily-armed ocean-going battleships. Caprivi ordered ten coastal defense ships to guard the entrances to the canal, since even opponents of the navy in the Reichstag (Imperial Diet) agreed that such vessels were necessary. The first six of these, the , were based on the smallest proposal. Heimdall was long overall and had a beam of and a maximum draft of . She displaced at full combat load. Her propulsion system consisted of two vertical 3-cylinder triple-expansion engines. Steam for the engines was provided by four coal-fired boilers. The ship's propulsion system provided a top speed of and a range of approximately at . Heimdall had a crew of 20 officers and 256 enlisted men. The ship was armed with three 24 cm K L/35 guns mounted in three single gun turrets. Two were placed side by side forward, and the third was located aft of the main superstructure. They were supplied with a total of 204 rounds of ammunition. The ship was also equipped with eight 8.8 cm SK L/30 guns in single mounts. Heimdall also carried four torpedo tubes, all in swivel mounts on the deck. One was at the bow, another at the stern, and two amidships. The ship was protected by an armored belt that was amidships, and an armored deck that was thick. The conning tower had thick sides. Heimdalls armor consisted of new Krupp steel, a more effective type of armor than the compound steel the other members of the class received. Service history Heimdall was laid down in 1891 at the Kaiserliche Werft shipyard in Wilhelmshaven. She was launched on 27 July 1892, and completed on 7 April 1894.

Her secondary battery was increased to ten 8.8 cm guns, and the 35 cm torpedo tubes were replaced with three tubes. Work was completed by 1902.

Although not used commercially for insect control, epoxiconazole exhibits a strong anti-feeding effect on the keratin- digesting common clothes moth larvae Tineola bisselliella.Sunderland, M. R.; Cruickshank, R. H.; Leighs, S. J. (2014). “The efficacy of antifungal azole and antiprotozoal compounds in protection of wool from keratin-digesting insect larvae”. Textile Research Journal 84 (9): 924–931. http://trj.sagepub.com/content/84/9/924 Resistance Certain plant pathogens develop resistance to fungicides. In contrast to the relatively rapid development of resistance to strobilurins, azole fungicides like Epoxiconazole have maintained their effectiveness controlling key wheat diseases for over two decades. According to a study conducted by the Home Grown Cereals Authority (HGCA), Epoxiconazole was one of two triazole fungicides (the other being prothioconazole) reported to still provide a high level of eradicative and protective control of Septoria tritici. Additional classes of fungicides like contact fungicides, strobilurins or carboxamides are available to farmers. In the latter case, the best activity rates are achieved in mixtures with triazoles. Mode of Action As an azole, Epoxiconazole, actively stops the production of new fungi spores and inhibits the biosynthesis of existing hostile cells. Epoxiconazole works as an eradicant by encapsulating fungal haustoria, which are then cut off from their nutrient supply and therefore die. Some fungicide interactions can actually lead to increased production of mycotoxins, which are normal metabolic products of fungi, and it has been found that the inclusion of triazoles, like Epoxiconazole, in the fungicide mix may be necessary to limit mycotoxin levels.Xu X, Nicholson P and Ritieni A.: Effects of fungal interactions among Fusarium head blight pathogens on disease development and mycotoxin accumulation. In: International Journal of Food Microbiology Nr. 119 (1-2), 2007, pg. 67-71. Regulation The EU’s pesticide directive (91/414 EEC) currently lists Epoxiconazole in Annex I. Only active ingredients listed there may be used in plant protection products and sold to farmers. Substances can only be listed in Annex I if extensive data regarding the physical chemical properties, the fate and behaviour in the environment and certain toxicological properties have been evaluated by EU authorities and EFSA. Only if a substance has been proven to be safe for users, consumers and the environment when used according to instructions it is included. Annex I listings are granted for ten years. Epoxiconazole’s listing expires on 30 April 2019; European farmers can use products containing Epoxiconazole, depending on their national registration, at least until the date of expiration for Annex I listing.

Design Line-drawing of in 1910 In the late 1880s, the German Kaiserliche Marine grappled with the problem of what type of capital ship to build in the face of limited naval budgets (owing to parliamentary objections to naval spending and the cost of dredging the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal). General Leo von Caprivi, the new Chef der Admiralität (Chief of the Admiralty), requested a series of design proposals, which ranged in size from small coastal defense ships to heavily-armed ocean-going battleships. Caprivi ordered ten coastal defense ships to guard the entrances to the canal, since even opponents of the navy in the Reichstag (Imperial Diet) agreed that such vessels were necessary. The first six of these, the , were based on the smallest proposal. Beowulf was long overall and had a beam of and a maximum draft of . She displaced at full combat load.

The ship was armed with three 24 cm K L/35 guns mounted in three single gun turrets. Two were placed side by side forward, and the third was located aft of the main superstructure. They were supplied with a total of 204 rounds of ammunition. The ship was also equipped with eight 8.8 cm SK L/30 guns in single mounts. Beowulf also carried four torpedo tubes, all in swivel mounts on the deck. One was at the bow, another at the stern, and two amidships. The ship was protected by an armored belt that was amidships, and an armored deck that was thick. The conning tower had thick sides. Service history Painting of Beowulf in 1902 Beowulf was laid down in 1890 at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen. She was launched on 8 November 1890, and completed on 1 April 1892. Among the crew that commissioned the ship was the officer Franz von Hipper, who would go on to command the German battle fleet during World War I. Directly after her commissioning, she joined the I Division of the fleet for its annual training exercises, along with the three ironclads , , and . Beowulf remained on active service through the winter of 1892-1893, when she and her sister ship joined the elderly ironclads and for a winter training cruise in the Mediterranean Sea. In 1893, Beowulf again participated in the annual fleet maneuvers, this time alongside her recently- commissioned sister and several old ironclads. On the first set of maneuvers, Beowulf and the other capital ships performed as the hostile French fleet, which was \\"attacked\\" by torpedo boats in the North Sea. The second set of maneuvers took place in the Baltic Sea, and Beowulf and the ironclads again simulated a French fleet. In 1897, Beowulf again participated in the annual summer maneuvers in the III Division, along with Siegfried and . Her other three sisters were assigned to the IV Division.Notes on Naval Progress, p. 107 Following her service in the 1899 summer maneuvers, Beowulf was placed in reserve, as the flagship of the reserve squadron in the North Sea.Webster, p. Beowulf served on active duty with the fleet until 1900, when she was taken into drydock at the Kaiserliche Werft shipyard in Danzig for an extensive reconstruction. The ship was lengthened to , which increased displacement to . Her old boilers were replaced with eight new Marine type boilers, and a second funnel was added. Her secondary battery was increased to ten 8.8 cm guns, and the 35 cm torpedo tubes were replaced with three tubes. Work was completed by 1902. She then returned to service with the fleet, and in 1903, was assigned to the II Division, along with three of her sister ships.Brassey, pp. 89 - 90 She remained in the fleet until the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, when she was mobilized into VI Battle Squadron for coastal defense, along with her sister ships and the two s. In May 1915, Beowulf participated in a combined naval and ground assault on the port of Libau in the Baltic. The attack took place on 7 May, and consisted of Beowulf, the armored cruisers , , and , and the light cruisers , , and . They were escorted by a number of destroyers, torpedo boats, and minesweepers. The IV Scouting Group of the High Seas Fleet was detached from the North Sea to provide cover for the operation. The bombardment went as planned, though the destroyer struck a mine in Libau's harbor, which blew off her bow and destroyed the ship. German ground forces were successful in their assault however, and took the city. On 31 August 1915, the VI Battle Squadron was demobilized, and Beowulfs crew was transferred to other warships. She was then used as a target ship for U-boats. Starting in 1918, she was used as an icebreaker in the Baltic Sea. On 17 June 1919, she was stricken from the naval register. She was sold to Norddeutsche Tiefbaugesellschaft in Berlin. Beowulf was broken up for scrap in 1921 in Danzig.

Origin of the name Noviodunum is a name of Celtic origin, meaning \\"new fort\\": It comes from nowyo, Celtic for \\"new\\", and dun, the Celtic for \\"hillfort\\" or \\"fortified settlement\\", cognate of English town. It was the urban center of the larger Colonia. Although the name of the city, Noviodunum, is certainly Celtic in origin, it is first mentioned in written sources in about 400AD. The name Colonia Iulia Equestris is more descriptive. A colonia was originally a Roman outpost established in conquered territory to secure it. Eventually, however, the term came to denote the highest status of Roman city. Iulia refers to either Julius Caesar or Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus. The first settlers in the Colonia were army veterans, especially cavalrymen or equester which led to the name Equestris. History =Foundation= Colonia Iulia Equestris was most likely founded by Julius Caesar in 46-44 BC. It was established on land taken from the Helvetii as a Colonia for cavalry veterans. The original functions of the Colonia were to provide land for veterans and military bases in conquered territory. Noviodunum was part of a loose network of settlements that radiated out from Lugdunum (modern Lyon, France) and helped to control the Rhone Valley. It served, along with other Roman colonies in the area, to control the Helvetii who were settled in the area against their will after their defeat at the Battle of Bibracte in 58 BC. =The early Colonia= The first colonists received land lots, which had been divided into uniform units, known as Centurions. Traces of the ordered system have been found in recent studies. Under Emperor Augustus, the colony experienced a boom. A rectangular grid pattern divided the area of the wall-less city. A monumental center, housing everything needed for the economic, religious and social life of the colony, was established. Only portions of this first forum have been discovered. At its east end was a two-story basilica, whose ground floor was divided, by a centrally located row of wooden columns, into two naves. Within the basilica, there were, probably, public baths or thermae. Under Tiberius, the forum was expanded and redesigned into a familiar pattern for the provinces. The sacred area was surrounded on three sides by colonnades, which were built on half-sunken Cryptoporticus. In the center would have been the main temple, though the remains of that building have not been discovered. A new basilica was built. It now consisted of a nave with two vestibules, the nave was enclosed by a colonnade, which formed a gallery. Two outbuildings, including most likely the seat of the Curia, flanked the building. A market building (macellum) with a central courtyard around which were the sales rooms, and the baths (tepidarium with geometric shapes and mosaics) were renovated. The forum witnessed further transformations, particularly the establishment of another large building. During the same building phase a large mosaic on the central part of the north portico was built. The amphitheater, which was discovered in 1996, was probably built in the early 2nd Century AD. Its arena, which was flanked by two prisons and provided with sewers, is about . The ruins of theater, that should have been in the Colonia, have not been discovered. The residential quarters consisted of modest homes, in addition to some domi with beautiful gardens and pools. The buildings were originally made of wood and clay, but after the mid-1st Century AD were built from masonry. Some villa suburbana stood in the west of the village, while the artisan and merchant quarter, presumably, developed in the southwest. A long aqueduct which ran from the Divonne area to the colony, provided the water supply. Sewage canals, that followed the road networks, dumped sewage into the lake. The city remained unwalled throughout its history. However, from the location of cemeteries, it appears that the city did not expand. Cremation graves were discovered in the north of the square of Perdtemps and in Clémenty. Iulia Equestris was a colony in Roman law with close ties to Vienne, the capital of the Allobroges. The city was governed by two duumviri which presided over the decurion council. At times the duumviri were replaced by a praefectus pro duumviri. The city also had an official list of aediles and a praefectus arcendis latrociniis who was commissioned to combat banditry. The Flaminica Augustae were responsible, along with a six- member college of priests (seviri Augustales), for the imperial cult. =Decline= After a long period of peace and prosperity, signs of crisis and general insecurity were increasing in the early 3rd Century. As a result of Alamanni invasions of 259 or 260 AD, the forum and the public buildings in the city were razed. The stone blocks were scattered all over the Lake Geneva region. The stones were re-used as building material, especially in Geneva, where about 300 were used in the construction of the wall. But the settlement was not abandoned and a number of signs of settlements after the 3rd Century have been discovered. These include; the large necropolis at Clémenty has tombs from the 5th to 8th Centuries, the stone box graves in the Grand-Rue, near an early medieval building with apses, and the mention of a Civitas Equestrium in the Notitia Gallic around 400 AD. Nyon-Noviodunum, which had already lost much of its prestige and reputation was as a regional capital, now separated from Geneva. Geneva became the center and seat of the diocese which initially fought to administer the territory that had been part of the Colonia. =Rediscovery= In the 18th Century, there were sporadic discoveries of Roman items from the Colonia. Due to the research of local scholars, especially Théophile Wellauer, in the 19th Century these discoveries became frequent and regular. In 1841, the municipality set up a museum to store, catalog, research and display the items that had been found. In 1875 Johann Jakob Müller published, in Zurich, the first overall map of the Colonia. In 1974, the significant discovery of the basilica in the forum, gave the research additional momentum. In 1979, a new museum dedicated to the Roman Colonia was built near the basilica. Colonia site The territory of the Colonia stretched between the Jura, Rhone river and Lake Geneva. The border with the Helvetii probably ran to Aubonne and later formed the dividing line between the dioceses of Lausanne and Geneva. However, it is possible (based on some milestones) that the border ran to the Venoge and Morge rivers (Morga is Gaulish for border). The center of the Roman city was on an elevated plateau between the Asse and Cossy rivers, at the same point as the later medieval castle and old town of Nyon. The easily defended hill dominated the lake on which human settlements date back the Neolithic era. On the hill itself, no traces of a pre-Roman settlement have been discovered. Trade The Colonia, which was located along roads with Lyon, the capital of the Gauls, Aventicum, Augusta Raurica, Valais and Italy and connected by waterways to the Mediterranean and the Rhine was benefited from trade across the western Roman Empire. A port, likely in what is now district Rive, allowed the Colonia to participate in the Lake Geneva trade. Imports included: luxury tableware or products from the Mediterranean, such as amphorae of wine, oil, or fish sauce. However very little is known about exports from the Colonia. The only evidence of exports is a bronze tablet, found near Regensburg (Castra Regina). It bore the name of the bronze craftsman L. Cusseius Ocellio, who worked in Noviodunum. The agricultural estates on the outskirts of the Colonia are expected to had been profitable. But the lack of archaeological findings about the type of management, the size of farms and density of the farmers, mean that very little is known about the early farms. Later, a number of villas, large landed estate with luxurious mansions, were built around the town. The villas brought city comforts and Roman lifestyle on the rural areas. One example of this form of romanization, the villa of Commugny with its peristyle, baths, mosaics and high quality wall paintings was built in the years between 35 and 45 AD.

He represented Durham in the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada from 1830 to 1836 as a Conservative. A native of County Cavan in Ireland, Brown came to Port Hope from New York in 1818 to make a new home for his family in Upper Canada. By 1823, he was so well-established that he had built the first brick building in the village as a home for his family, at the foot of Walton Street. As a businessman involved in many fields, he owned a cut nail factory, a distillery, a general store, and, one mile north, a complex he called 'Brown Stone Mills', comprising flouring mills, a saw mill, a blacksmith shop, a cooper shop, store houses, and a granary. In 1829, he was elected president of the Harbour Company of Port Hope, of which he was the principal owner. As a supporter of the Tory Party, he was elected to the Upper Canada Legislature in 1830 and 1835 as a Member of Parliament for Durham County. On 7 April 1834, Brown became the first elected Head of the Board of Police for Port Hope, of which Marcus Whitehead was chosen president. He was also a justice of the peace for the Newcastle District. It was said, \\"With his feuds and shenanigans, he (John Brown) made Port Hope an interesting place in which to live (and) with his enterprise he did much to lift the village from its primitive state\\". Brown and his wife were the parents of four daughters: Ann, married to Francis H.

The two wound up fighting with swords in a duel just outside the gates of the Louvre. Godefroid was pierced in the ribs and died on the spot, on the Cour Carrée, or in a nearby church.

Arnold was a citizen of London, dwelling in the parish of St Magnus, London Bridge. It would appear from his own book that he was a merchant trading with Flanders. He was an executor of the will of John Amell the elder, citizen and cutler of London, which was drawn up in 1473, and he is there described as a haberdasher. He was in the habit, for purposes of business, of paying visits to Flanders, and was in 1488 confined in the Castle of Sluys on suspicion of being a spy. He was apparently hard pressed by creditors at one period of his life, and sought shelter in the sanctuary at Westminster. He had a wife named Alice and a son Nicholas. The date of his death is uncertain. Francis Douce, who fully investigated the matter, concluded that he died shortly after the publication of the last edition of his book, in 1520-1. Work Arnold's work is a book dealing with London antiquities. It contains the chief charters granted to the city, accounts of its customs, and notes on a variety of topics chiefly but not entirely connected with commerce. Thomas Hearne called it a chronicle; but its only claim to that title rests on its opening section, which gives, with occasional historical notes, a list of the names of the 'Balyfs, Gustos, Mayers, and Sherefs' of London between 1189 and 1502. The greater part of this list was evidently borrowed direct from a manuscript now in the Cottonian Library at the British Museum. Arnold himself gives the book no name; Douce, its latest editor, christens it the 'Customs of London.' Its most interesting feature is its introduction of the 'Ballade of ye Nottebrowne Mayde,' which occurs, without any explanation, between an account of the tolls payable by English merchants sending merchandise to Antwerp, and a statement of the differences between English and Flemish currencies. No earlier version of the ballad is known, and according to Capel, Warton, Douce, and Collier, it is probable that it had been composed only a few years before Arnold transcribed and printed it. Hearne, however, assigns it to the time of Henry V, and Thomas Percy to the early part of Henry VII's reign. Its authorship is unknown; but Douce assumes, on very just grounds, that it was translated from an old German ballad by some Englishman whom Arnold met at Antwerp. It was frequently reprinted separately in the sixteenth century, and enjoyed very great popularity for many years; interest in it was revived by its republication in the 'Muse's Mercury' for June 1707, where it was first seen by Prior, who paraphrased it in his 'Henry and Emma' about 1718. From typographical evidence it is clear that Arnold's book was first published at Antwerp in 1502 by John Doesborowe, who published other English books. This edition is without date, place, or printer's name. A second edition, in which the list of the mayors and sheriffs is brought down to 1520 — doubtless the date of publication — is ascribed by typographical experts to Peter Treveris, the first printer who set up a press at Southwark. It is also without date, place, or printer's name. A third edition, with introduction by Francis Douce, appeared in 1811. Copies of the two original editions, which are now of excessive rarity, are in the British Library, and other copies may be found at the Huntington Library, the Folger Shakespeare Library, and other archives. A copy may be viewed through Early English Books On Line (subscription required).

When the 1929 Great Depression made the use of 'swimming garages' impractical, Bernstein then turned his cargo ships into passenger ships, with just one travel class (which he called tourist class) rather than the three that were usual. One of the first Jewish 'merchant princes', he was one of the victims of the Nazi appropriation policies. Early life The eldest son of the Jewish businessman Max Bernstein and his wife Franziska Altmann, Arnold Bernstein was born 23 January 1888 in Breslau, capital city of the Prussian province of Silesia (today Wrocław, Poland). He had three sisters - Else, Alice, and Rose. Arnold considered himself to be a lazy student contrary to the values of his family. His primary education ended by age 14 and his attitude began to change when he apprenticed to his father in 1902. By the age of 21 he had adopted his father's culture of a strict work ethic and honor code for business which he carried in 1909 to the Hanseatic port city of Hamburg. He fought in the German artillery during the First World War rising from sergeant to captain (but not allowed into the Officer Corps because of his religion). He fought in battles at Noyon, Ypern, and at the Somme, and was awarded the Iron Cross first class.Siegel, Björn. \\"Arnold Bernstein.\\" In Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German-American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present, vol. 5, edited by R.

Career He founded his first shipping company then became a soldier in World War One, then returned to his business as the Arnold Bernstein Line. Over the course of the next decade, he grew the value of his shipping enterprises. During the early 1930s, Bernstein personally experienced the growing anti-Semitism even though he did not consider himself a practicing religious Jew. Bernstein did not trust Hitler's promise to Hindenburg that he would not harm Jews who had fought in the first World War, but his wife did not want to emigrate. Bernstein founded the Palestine Shipping Company (1934),Arnold Bernstein is a Backer of New Palestine Shipping Line, JTA archive, 1935 January 14. Accessed February 2020. which emerged as an important link for Jewish emigration to Palestine during the late 1930s. Bernstein was tried in 1937 and imprisoned on charges of foreign exchange offenses, but released in 1939. At the time of his arrest, he was the owner of one of the largest Jewish businesses in Germany. After making a payment of $30,000 in U.S. currency (), he was allowed to leave Germany for Holland. The funds were raised by friends, who withheld payment until Bernstein arrived at the border crossing. Bernstein and his wife Lilli left Europe for New York aboard the SS Nieuw Amsterdam at Southampton on August 25, 1939, and arrived in New York on September 1, the day that Germany invaded Poland. On board were 1286 passengers, about 150 more than normal capacity. The Nieuw Amsterdam, a ship owned by the Holland America Line, was called the \\"first war refugee\\" ship, since it was the first to take on passengers in excess of capacity because of the fear of war breaking out. He had very little money but was highly regarded in his business skills. He recruited investors while assets and credit were difficult to obtain during wartime. In 1940 he founded the Arnold Bernstein Steamship Corporation in New York. In 1945, Bernstein sued in US District Court for the recovery of his two shipping lines, arguing that he had been forced under threat of death to sign them over to the Nazi government. Some ships from the Arnold Bernstein Line had been taken over by the Allies, but the Red Star Line had been sold to the Holland America Line. The two lines were valued at $4,800,000 (). Bernstein was a flexible thinker who preferred straightforward methods, but would develop complex transactions to match the needs of investors, customers and regulators. Along with other shipping industry executives, in the late 1940s he saw an opportunity to provide a quality passenger cruise ship experience that would allow visits to smaller and older ports that the larger trans-Atlantic cruise ships were not able to meet. Bernstein once said, \\"All business is a kind of war and you stand a fair chance of winning if you stick to your guns.\\"New York Times: Arnold Bernstein Dead at 83, 9 March 1971, page 41. Accessed February 2020. His first attempt to purchase the defunct partially converted cargo ship Nilla, previously the World War II-era LST HMS Bruiser, for conversion to a small passenger cruise ship began with a negotiation with its owners. Using Triora S.A., Panama, his investor group planned to purchase the ship and rename her Silver Star (not Silverstar). Triora S.A. was named in honor of the people of Triora who aided Francesco Moraldo in hiding two Jewish orphans from the Nazis. On 2 February 1950 the vessel left Antwerp under tow for Hamburg. However the sale to Triora S.A. had fallen through. Finally in May 1950 her owners closed the sale of Nilla to a \\"Swiss\\" investor, Mr. Vasile Ladislau \\"Leslie\\" Winkler (b. 12 Aug 1914 in Romania), who had a residence in Paris at the time. He registered the ship in Panama, owned by Compania de Naviera Rio Grande. (The brilliant Mr. Winkler was an example of a highly capable shipping industry agent displaced by war.Ships and Friendships. Author: Arne Larsson, pp. 193-197; accessed January 2020American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) Archives: Italy, Transfer of Funds: V.

Excerpt from Records & Briefs New York State Appellate Division, 30 AD 2nd, pages 950, Volume 216. Accessed January 2020.) The Nilla was still an attractive vessel to Bernstein because it could be converted for either full passenger ship or partial passenger/car carrier ship. Mr. Winkler's purchase was a way to fulfill Bernstein's assurance of a sale to the original sellers. In 1951 Bernstein arranged the purchase of the vessel by SGS Société de Surveillance S. A. in Geneva, Switzerland (with registered owner: Compania Naviera Estrella de Plata S. A., Panama, call sign: HOHX) and renamed Silverstar. (Estrella de Plata is the specific Spanish language way of translating Silver Star, the award first granted during World War II to U.S. Forces for gallantry in action against an enemy.) Because of his vast and detailed knowledge and experience in passenger shipping, Bernstein involved himself in the details of conversion. A successful operation of the vessel would be essential to the growth of his personal wealth; every penny he could save would make the possibility of success more likely. Every aid to efficient operation he could add during conversion would potentially increase profitability and safety. The Silverstar was brought into the ship yard of Howaldtswerke AG, Hamburg for conversion into a cruise liner while at the same time she was lengthened by 22 feet (6.71 m) at the stern. Bernstein had personal and professional connections with executives of the shipyard, and so did Winkler. To accommodate a maximum of 420 passengers, 171 air-conditioned passenger cabins were provided at time when air-conditioned cabins were not standard. Beginning in 1952 the Bernstein-controlled Silver Star Line sailed the Silverstar for \\"informal\\" vacation cruises from Washington DC,The Second Supplemental Appropriation Bill, 1955: Hearings Before Subcommittees of the Committee on Appropriations, House of Representatives, Eighty-fourth Congress, First Session, page 298. Accessed February 2020 Charleston, Miami, and New Orleans to the Caribbean Sea, calling mainly in ports like Bermuda, Nassau, Havana and Vera Cruz. At the end of each summer, she sailed to West Germany for annual dry docking. In March of 1955 Silverstar made a port of call in Tunis on a Mediterranean cruise. In December of 1956 the charter on the vessel was transferred to Caribbean Cruise Lines and she sailed for one additional voyage. In January of 1957, Silverstar was sold to state-owned Flota Argentina de Navegación Fluvial (Buenos Aires) and renamed Ciudad de Santa Fé. In 1957, Bernstein founded the American Banner Lines in New York and arranged the financing for purchase and conversion of the freighter Badger Mariner into a passenger ship. In 1958 it was put into service as the passenger vessel Atlantic in the New York-Antwerp- Amsterdam trade but burgeoning airline competition underlay difficulty in financing a sister ship. In 1959 the Atlantic was sold to American Export Lines to be refitted as a warm weather cruise liner and at the age of 71, Bernstein retired from business to his home in New Rochelle, New York because of his declining health. He spent the last years of his life in Florida and died of a heart ailment in Ocean Ridge, Florida at the age of 83. Personal life Surviving his death were his widow, the former Lilli Kimmelstiel (born 20 June 1896 in Hamburg, married 1 May 1919); a son, Ronald Barnes; a daughter, Mrs. Stephanie Lanxner, and two sisters, Mrs. Else Kugelman and Mrs. Alice Wolff.

Monash Research's Curt Monash defines it as \\"data that was produced entirely by machines OR data that is more about observing humans than recording their choices.\\"Monash, 12/30/2010 Meanwhile, Daniel Abadi, CS Professor at Yale, proposes a narrower definition, \\"Machine- generated data is data that is generated as a result of a decision of an independent computational agent or a measurement of an event that is not caused by a human action.\\"Abadi Regardless of definition differences, both exclude data manually entered by a person.Monash, Three Broad Categories of Data Machine-generated data crosses all industry sectors. Often and increasingly, humans are unaware their actions are generating the data.Deloach, Machine Generated Data  Relevance  Machine-generated data has no single form; rather, the type, format, metadata, and frequency respond to some particular business purpose. Machines often create it on a defined time schedule or in response to a state change, action, transaction, or other event. Since the event is historical, the data is not prone to be updated or modified. Partly because of this quality, the U.S. court systems consider machine-generated data as highly reliable.Federal Evidence Review, Machine Generated Data was Not Statement and Raised no Hearsay Machine-generated data is the lifeblood of the Internet of Things (IoT). Growth In 2009, Gartner published that data will grow by 650% over the following five years.ScienceLogic Most of the growth in data is the byproduct of machine- generated data. IDC estimated that in 2020, there will be 26 times more connected things than people., Chuck's Blog Wikibon issued a forecast of $514 billion to be spent on the Industrial Internet in 2020., Wikibon = Processing = Given the fairly static yet voluminous nature of machine- generated data, data owners rely on highly scalable tools to process and analyze the resulting dataset. Almost all machine-generated data is unstructured but then derived into a common structure. Typically, these derived structures contain many data points/columns. With these data points, the challenge lies mostly with analyzing the data. Given high performance requirements along with large data sizes, traditional database indexing and partitioning limits the size and history of the dataset for processing.

The NGOs work with the communities to meet various needs: social care, education, sports, music, and so on. These NGOs were established or founded by various ethnic groups ranging from Chinese to Nepalese themselves. Some of them have their own communicating channels within the community or even to their fellow countrymen outside. Most NGOs are periodically active. A few NGO groups operate continuously and are active in different levels. NGOs serving Nepalese in Hong Kong can be mainly categorised into two types: either founded by Hong Kong Nepalese or Hong Kong Chinese. Some NGOs, of which organisers are hardly traceable, are categorised as “others”. Some Nepalese NGOs organised purely by Nepalese, like the Hong Kong Integrated Nepalese Society, focuses on providing services and aid for Nepalese in Hong Kong.

flows during dry months, the mean annual runoff was estimated as about 1,207 million cubic meters (million cubic metres) and that at 95% availability as 730 million cubic metres. Therefore, the live storage in the reservoir was fixed at 1,032.3 million cubic metres. However, subsequent to the commissioning of the project in 1987, availability of the flows was reassessed. It was noted that flows reduced to 1,178 million cubic metres in dry season and reached 4,361 million cubic metres during the monsoon. The total annual flow was assessed as 5,539 million cubic metres. As irrigation requirements are not critical during monsoon season the assessment of dry weather flows is relevant for irrigation. Further, Idamalayar storage is being supplemented from diversion of flows from the Peringalkuthu Reservoir during the monsoon season through the Vachumaram diversion canal constructed during 1997. The water stored in the reservoir is used for energy generation during the monsoon season by adopting a suitable reservoir operational schedule so that the water diverted from the diversion canal is not spilled out. Structural details The dam built across the Idamalayar River is a gravity concrete structure with a total height of above the deepest foundation level with a length of at the crest level. The full reservoir level is elevation and the minimum draw down level (MDDL) is . The dam has created a reservoir with a water spread of . The reservoir has a gross storage capacity of 1,089.0 million cubic metres of which the effective storage is 1,017.8 million cubic metres. The spillway has been designed to pass a design flood discharge of . The storage in the reservoir created behind the high concrete gravity dam is utilized for power generation by diversion through a water conductor system comprising a long power tunnel, surge shaft and two lines of penstocks connected to the turbines installed in a surface power station for generation of 75 MW of power with two units of 37.5 MW capacity each. Instrumentation is provided in the Idamalayar Dam and the observations carried out are analysed regularly to monitor the safety of the structure. However, a rehabilitation project envisaging improving the safety and operational performance of selected structures such as dams, barrages and regulators, which covers 19 projects under the Irrigation Department and 12 projects of the Kerala State Electricity Board, has been approved under the World Bank funded \\"Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project (DRIP)\\" to be implemented from January 2011. Idamalayar Dam is one of the projects included in this programme. However, the rehabilitation work on this dam is proposed to be taken up in the second stage. =Irrigation benefits= Upstream view of the dam from the reservoir Irrigation benefits from the water stored in the Idamalayar Reservoir are proposed by utilizing the tail-race water released from the Idamalayar Power house. For this purpose, the project titled \\"The Idamalayar Irrigation Project\\" is under implementation. Under this project, the tail race discharge from the Idamalayar powerhouse is picked up at the barrage constructed across the Periyar River at Bhoothathankettu and diverted through a canal system on the right bank of the barrage. The irrigation benefits envisaged covers an area of of wet and dry agricultural lands, out of which the cultivable command area is . The project is under implementation since 1981. The cost of the project was initially Rs 18.5 crores (about US$411.11 million), which as per latest reports of 2007 is stated to be Rs. 539.50 crores (US$1198.9 million). According to the Annual Plan 2010–2011 of the State Government, substantial work of the main canal, the low level canal and the link canal still needs to be completed to derive full planned benefits of irrigation. Apart from power and irrigation benefits, the project situated in scenic forest area also provides recreational benefits of boating in the reservoir, bird watching and trekking. Construction delays The Idamalayar Dam project was started in 1970 and completed after 17 years. In an analysis carried out in 2001 on the reasons for the delay in completion of Hydropower Projects resulting in immense cost overruns in Kerala, it was noted that the Idamalayar project could be commissioned only in 1987 with a time overrun of 9 years and consequent cost overrun of 285% resulting in a capital cost of Rs 2.81 per kWh of generation. While technical reasons for the delays were fully documented, the delay highlighted, however, was attributed to the \\"irrational behaviour of the organized militant labour\\". A High Level Committee set up by the Government of Kerala, which examined this issue, observed that the Idamalayar Dam project has been the \\"victim of recurring and long inertial periods of labour unrest\\". There was also controversy over the contract awards. The government appointed Justice K. Sukumaran to inquire into allegations related to the Idamalayar and Kallada dam construction contracts. Based on his report, Minister R. Balakrishna Pillai and others were prosecuted by a Special Court. The Kerala high court later acquitted them, but in February 2011 the Supreme Court of India sentenced R. Balakrishna Pillai and two others to a year in prison for abusing their positions when awarding the contracts.

Design In the late 1880s, the German Kaiserliche Marine grappled with the problem of what type of capital ship to build in the face of limited naval budgets (owing to parliamentary objections to naval spending and the cost of dredging the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal). General Leo von Caprivi, the new Chef der Admiralität (Chief of the Admiralty), was able to secure approval from the Reichstag (Imperial Diet) for ten small coastal defense ships, the first six of which became the , which carried three main battery guns in individual barbette mounts. Proposals for the last four included redesigning the vessels to add another main battery gun in two-gun turrets came to nothing owing to the cost of other naval programs—most notably the s.

The ship was also equipped with ten 8.8 cm SK L/30 guns in single mounts. Odin also carried three torpedo tubes, two in swivel mounts on the deck amidships and one in the bow, submerged below the waterline. The ship was protected by an armored belt that was thick amidships, and an armored deck that was thick. The conning tower had thick sides.

She was commissioned into the German fleet on 22 September 1896. She served in the fleet for her entire peacetime career. Odin participated in the 1900 summer fleet exercises, where she served in the squadron that simulated the German navy, alongside the recently-commissioned battleship and the coastal defense ship .Notes on Naval Progress, p. 416 In 1901, Odin was taken in hand at the Kaiserliche Werft in Danzig for an extensive reconstruction. Her old boilers were replaced with eight new Marine type boilers and her length was increased to . This increased her displacement to at full load.

It was first published in the United States by MonkeyBrain Books in 2008.Hal Duncan (2008), Escape from Hell!, Monkeybrain, Austin (TX), Introduction The prologue of the book introduces the reader to four characters, who in it meet their death in different ways. Eli (a clear reference to the biblical prophet of the same name) is a beggar sometimes defined a hobo, who commits suicide; Seven (probably referring to the seven deadly sins or to the David Fincher film Seven) is a hitman who ends up killed by his paymaster; Matthew (clearly Matthew Shepard, already referred to by the author in his previous novels Vellum and Ink) is a young homosexual man who was beaten to death; Belle is a prostitute and a drug addict who is killed by her pimp for having tried to leave \\"the profession\\". The four characters see each other (but do not interact) on the ferry that takes them across the Styx and into Hell. After having been walked through gates bearing the Dante Alighieri words \\"Abandon Hope\\", gates that are described as very similar to those of Auschwitz concentration camp, they are assigned to four different sections. Eli is let loose in the streets of a dystopian version of Manhattan, where he struggles to hide from police-like vigilantes; Seven is locked in a structure resembling a prison where he is constantly tortured; Belle is kept in a room where she is regularly raped; Matthew is in an institution similar to a psychiatric hospital where doctors try to \\"cure\\" him from his homosexual tendencies. In different ways, they all manage to escape from their situation and join forces; they rescue Lucifer from Gabriel the archangel, who is running Hell in his stead, and try to get him back into Heaven too.

The travel director of Oslo stated that his claim was wrong, pointing to Oslo Municipality's recent investments like Det Norske Teatret. In 1986 Skjærpe wanted to become editorial chief of NRK P1. He instead returned to his position as a journalist in NRK before becoming editor-in-chief of A/S Avis. After A/S Avis was discontinued after a few months, Skjærpe became editor of Radio Nettverk. In 1992 Skjærpe was hired as a fellow worker for NRK Radio in Oslo. In 1994 he was hired as information manager for the Norwegian Association of Local and Regional Authorities. In 1997 Weber Skjærpe was promoted to director of communications and strategy in the same association, where he has been ever since. Skjærpe was also the acting chief executive of the association in 2009. He took over from Olav Ulleren, until Sigrun Vågeng took over. Weber stayed in the association as director of communications and strategy.

Their primary function originally was anti-submarine warfare. During the war they carried out many additional roles from supporting landing operations to escorting convoys. Over 350 ships were built.Military Ships of Russia , p. 80 Background In early 1930s, the main focus of Soviet shipbuilding was building small patrol ships and boats with various duties. Among them, a large part consisted of submarine hunter boats. The MO class was the first Soviet built submarine hunter ship class, with the abbreviation meaning \\"Small Hunter\\". Unlike torpedo boats, MO boats had no torpedo weapons, but instead had depth charge launchers. Design history =MO-1, MO-2 and MO-3 types= The first ship of the class was a border patrol boat PK-139, which was given the class designation of MO-1 in 1935. The production series was a slightly faster ship, given the designation MO-2. Some 27–36 ships of this class were built in 1935–1936. A slightly modified MO-3 was in limited production resulting in four ships built. =MO-4 type= MO-4 was the most produced type of the class, with approximately 250 built. It was a slightly modified MO-2 variant, with a more vertical stern and slightly lower. It was designed at the NKVD \\"No. 5 construction bureau\\" in Leningrad. The ship had no armor and had a wooden structure, but consisted of nine sections isolated from each other, allowed to stay afloat even after suffering heavy damage. Three GAM-34BS had a power of , but many production series ships had the engine power reduced to , to increase engine life. The main weapons of the ship were the depth charges and 45 mm semi-automatic guns. The ships also had a pair of DShK machine guns. MO-4 ships were built at several shipyards including Leningrad, Murmansk and Astrakhan from 1937 to 1943. =BMO type= In summer 1943, the Leningrad shipyards designed a new variant to remedy the MO-4's lack of armor. The letter \\"B\\" stood for \\"бронированный\\" (; ). The new ship was made of steel, with armor of up to protecting the engine. One of the 45mm guns was replaced with a 37mm 70K anti-aircraft gun, which had higher performance in the anti aircraft role. 48 were built during the war and another 18 in the second half of 1945.охотник \\"БМО\\".

Some distinguished individual ships are listed below. =MO-103= This is one of the most famous MO ships. On July 30, 1944 she sank the German submarine U-250 in shallow waters of the Baltic Sea. The commander of U-250 and five crewmen survived and were captured. The submarine was raised by Soviet forces in early September and moved to Leningrad.

Under his management the Lyceum Theatre, London became the English Opera House, and staged the first English productions of many operas, including in 1824 Carl Maria von Weber's Der Freischütz. Life Arnold was the son of the composer Samuel Arnold, and was given an artistic education. In 1794 at the Haymarket Theatre he produced Auld Robin Gray, a musical play in two acts; and this was followed by other works of the same class: Who Pays the Reckoning? produced at the Haymarket in 1795; The Shipwreck, produced at the Drury Lane Theatre in 1796; The Irish Legacy, produced at the Haymarket in 1797; and The Veteran Tar, produced at Drury Lane in 1801. Foul Deeds Will Rise, first played at the Haymarket in 1804, was described by the critic John Genest as \\"an unnatural mixture of tragedy and farce\\". The Prior Claim, produced at Drury Lane in 1805, was a comedy written in conjunction with Henry James Pye. Man and Wife, or More Secrets than One, a comedy produced at Drury Lane in 1809, was performed thirty times. In 1809 Arnold obtained from the Lord Chamberlain a license to open the Lyceum in the Strand as an English opera house. The building was previously devoted to subscription concerts, picture exhibitions, feats of horsemanship and conjuring. Upon the destruction of the Drury Lane Theatre by fire in the same year, the Drury Lane Company moved to the Lyceum, and remained there for three seasons. The license had been originally granted in the belief that the house would be open only for four months in the summer, and would become a nursery of singers for the winter theatres. Up All Night, or The Smuggler's Cave, Britain's Jubilee, The Maniac, or Swiss Banditti, and Plots, or The North Tower are the titles of musical plays by Arnold presented by the Drury Lane Company during their occupancy of the English Opera House. The theatre was afterwards open under his own management, when his operas The King's Proxy, The Devil's Bridge, The Americans, Frederick the Great, Baron Trenck, Broken Promises and dramas including Two Words and Free and Easy were produced in succession. In 1811 he staged M.P., a comic opera to a libretto by Thomas Moore. William Hazlitt wrote in 1816 of Arnold's The King's Proxy that it was \\"the essence of four hundred rejected pieces … with all that is threadbare in plot, lifeless in wit, and sickly in sentiment\\" and that \\"Mr. Arnold writes with the fewest ideas possible; his meaning is more nicely balanced between sense and nonsense than that of any of his competitors; he succeeds from the perfect insignificance of his pretensions, and fails to offend through downright imbecility.\\" Arnold's Two Words, however, Hazlitt pronounced \\"a delightful little piece. It is a scene with robbers and midnight murder in it; and all such scenes are delightful to the reader or spectator. We can conceive nothing better managed than the plot of this.\\" In 1812 Arnold had been invited to undertake the direction of the Drury Lane Theatre; he resigned his office on the suicide of Samuel Whitbread in 1815. In 1816 the English Opera House was reopened by Arnold, having been rebuilt on an enlarged scale by Samuel Beazley, the architect, at a cost of £80,000. In 1824 Arnold produced for the first time in England a version of Carl Maria von Weber's Der Freischütz, which had been previously refused by the two patent theatres. Other foreign operas of note, the Tarare of Antonio Salieri, The Freebooters by Ferdinando Paer, The Robber's Bride by Ferdinand Ries, and Heinrich Marschner's Der Vampyr, were afterwards produced at the English Opera House for the first time in England. In 1830 the theatre was destroyed by fire. In 1834 the rebuilt Lyceum, also by Samuel Beazley, was opened to the public. The English operas Nourjahad by Edward Loder and The Mountain Sylph by John Barnett were produced under Arnold's management. Arnold was a magistrate. Family In 1803 Arnold married the daughter of Henry James Pye, the Poet Laureate. Thomas James Arnold was his son.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The church stands in the highest point in the village, adjacent to the A1101 road between Mildenhall and Bury St Edmunds. This was formerly the ancient trackway of Icknield Way, and Icklingham is close to an important junction on this trackway. History A Roman Christian graveyard exists in Icklingham, and a baptismal font was found on the same site. The Icklingham font is made of lead, and is visible in the British Museum. Some of the fabric in the nave is Norman dating from the 11th or 12th century. The church was almost completely rebuilt in the 14th century, a time of great prosperity in the area. A south porch was added in the 15th century. The church has been unused for over 100 years, and its benefice has been united with that of St James, the other church in the village. It was declared redundant in the 1970s. Since passing into the care of the Churches Conservation Trust, its roof has been re-thatched in the traditional manner. Architecture =Exterior= The church is constructed in flint rubble with freestone dressings. The roof is thatched. Its plan consists of a four-bay nave with a south aisle and a south porch, a chancel, and a southwest tower. The tower is in three stages with a plain parapet and gargoyles, and has diagonal buttresses. In the lowest stage is a simple blocked doorway with a lancet window above it. In the middle stage is a circular window on the west side. The top stage contains large bell openings with Y-tracery on each side. The north nave wall contains the Norman fabric, which includes large areas of coursed flint walling and two blocked lancet windows. It also contains a doorway and 14th-century windows, and there are similar windows on the north and south walls of the chancel. The north wall of the chancel contains a doorway, and the east window has three lights. The east window of the south aisle has five lights, flanked by canopied niches. The niches show traces of colour, suggesting that they were originally painted. Its south wall contains a three-light window, and under the eaves is a cornice decorated with ball flowers. The porch has a pilastered doorway and two-light windows on each side. The south doorway into the church dates from the 14th century. =Interior= The south arcade has four bays carried on octagonal piers with moulded capitals. On the north and south walls is a cornice carved with a frieze containing a variety of motifs. There is a trefoil-headed piscina in the south wall of the aisle, and another in the south wall of the chancel. Also in the chancel is a double aumbry. The chancel also contains many 14th- century mosaic tiles with line-impressed decorations, dating from the 14th century. The rood screen is still partly present, and there is a door and stairs to the previous rood loft. The limestone font dates from the 14th century. It is carried on five columns, and its octagonal bowl is carved with different tracery on each face. The pulpit is also octagonal; it dates from the 17th century. Some of the stained glass dates from the 14th century. The pews are carved with poppyheads and date from between the 15th and the 17th centuries. There is a ring of three bells. Two of these were cast between 1424 and 1513 by Brasyers of Norwich, and the other in 1608 by John Draper of Thetford.

The special live edition was to celebrate fifty years of the programme being on air. The sixty-minute episode was directed by Tony Prescott, who had directed the soap's 40th anniversary live episode in December 2000. The episode, the 7487th in the series, was written by Jan McVerry and produced by Phil Collinson for ITV Studios. It was filmed at the Granada Studios complex in Manchester. To celebrate the show's 50th anniversary, episodes had been broadcast every day during the week 6–10 December 2010 under the advertisement banner \\"Four Funerals and a Wedding\\". An episode broadcast the preceding Monday showed a gas explosion in local bar The Joinery, causing a tram to crash from the viaduct into the Corner Shop and The Kabin opposite. The live episode continued to depict the aftermath of the accident, such as the rescue attempts and deaths of the characters Ashley Peacock (Steven Arnold) and Molly Dobbs (Vicky Binns), an emergency marriage between Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) and Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson) on Peter's hospital bed, Fiz Stape (Jennie McAlpine) giving birth prematurely to her daughter Hope, and Molly's revelation to Sally Webster (Sally Dynevor) that her husband Kevin (Michael Le Vell) fathered Molly's recently born baby Jack. The episode attracted an average of 14 million viewers, peaking at 14.9 million, the show's highest audience for seven years. Critical reception was mainly positive. According to Daniel Kilkelly of the Digital Spy website the opening of the episode featured the first computer-generated imagery in live television. Jennie McAlpine (who plays Fiz Stape) also became the first actress ever to act out a birth live on a soap opera. Plot summary The special anniversary was marked with a storyline in which the residents had to deal with a tragic accident and its aftermath. In the storyline, Nick Tilsley (Ben Price) and Leanne Battersby's (Jane Danson) bar - The Joinery - explodes during Peter Barlow's (Chris Gascoyne) stag party. As a result, the viaduct running above the restaurant is destroyed, sending a tram careering onto the street, destroying D&S; Alahan's Corner Shop and The Kabin. Two characters, Ashley Peacock (Steven Arnold) and Molly Dobbs (Vicky Binns), and an unnamed taxi driver perished as a result of the disaster. Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox) survives despite being trapped under the rubble of her destroyed shop, while Fiz Stape (Jennie McAlpine) prematurely gives birth to a baby girl, Hope, after her husband John (Graeme Hawley) strikes his stalker Charlotte Hoyle (Becky Hindley) with a hammer to silence her. He later poses as Colin Fishwick (David Crellin), Charlotte's supposed partner, attempting to turn off her life support. Peter marries Leanne in an emergency hospital ceremony, shortly before going into cardiac arrest, although he later rallies and makes a slow recovery. Production =Origins= Early episodes of Coronation Street were broadcast live. A live episode was produced in December 2000 to celebrate the programme's 40th anniversary. As the show's 50th anniversary approached, speculation began to grow as to whether another live edition would be broadcast, particularly after rival soap EastEnders aired its own live edition to celebrate its 25th anniversary on air in February 2010. In April 2010, William Roache, who has portrayed Ken Barlow since the show's first episode, said that ITV would not be airing another live edition of Coronation Street, saying, \\"We're not going to do a live episode, we did that in the Millennium year [the show's 40th anniversary], we don't want to do that again.\\" Reflecting upon the 2000 episode in November 2010, Roache said that he was glad when it was over and that \\"they won't do that again\\". He joked \\"anyone who said that they enjoyed the live episode are either not telling the truth or they're masochists.\\" However, on 29 August, actor Keith Duffy said that Coronation Street would air a live episode to celebrate its 50th anniversary, something which was confirmed on 1 September by ITV. It was later confirmed that the episode would be aired as part of a week-long celebration of the soap's 50th birthday. Phil Collinson, who had only recently taken over as producer, explained: > I thought we wouldn't go live, but quickly realised we should. I think we > can deliver the most spectacular piece of live television people have ever > seen. Coronation Street has such a heritage - the first episodes were filmed > that way, and we did it ten years ago. My ambition is for the episode to be > like a disaster movie with stunts. It'll be action-packed. I want people to > sit at home and think, 'There's no way they did that live, not in a million > years!' The anniversary was celebrated with a storyline involving an explosion in The Joinery, causing a tram to crash from the viaduct into the Kabin and Corner Shop. The storyline was a sign that TV shows now have to strive harder to make an impact, according to producer Phil Collinson. \\"Television has changed. Programmes like Coronation Street have to stand up against massive pieces of event television like Strictly Come Dancing and The X Factor. So we had to do something extraordinary. When drama pushes the boat out, it has to push it out really far. I think the days are over when television drama can sit back and leave it to your imagination. We have to compete against those great big juggernauts.\\" The tram crashed during an episode broadcast on Monday 6 December, with episodes later that week, including the live episode, depicting the rescues and aftermath. =Filming= The Coronation Street exterior set surrounded by the Granada Studios complex and Manchester city centre (photographed in Oct 2007). The live show involved 65 actors and a 300-strong crew. The episode opened with a wide shot of other streets in the fictional Weatherfield, reported by Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly to have been the first computer-generated imagery to be produced live. In reality, the Coronation Street set is surrounded by the Granada Television complex in Manchester city centre. The special effect was produced by The Mill, the post-production company that had worked on the tram crash. Collinson had worked with The Mill during his tenure as producer of Doctor Who. The episode was directed by Tony Prescott, who had directed the 40th anniversary live episode in December 2000. Prescott also directed the two episodes surrounding this live episode to gain some continuity. The live episode provided some challenges for dressing the set. The other episodes during the 50th anniversary week, including the tram crash, were filmed in October. As episodes are usually filmed weeks in advance, the tram had to be removed from sight for the filming of the Christmas and New Year episodes, and then put back in place over the weekend 4–5 December in time for rehearsals and transmission. Also, the cast and crew had to deal with extreme cold on the outdoor set during the days of rehearsals and broadcast as the UK was plunged into record levels of cold weather for the time of year. The producers reportedly banned the actors from drinking alcohol for 24 hours before the transmission to reduce the chances of accidents.

The Sun false story On the day of transmission, tabloid newspaper The Sun published a front-page headline \\"Al-Qaeda Corrie Threat\\", with a banner reading \\"Exclusive: Soap Terror Alert\\". The story suggested that \\"Cops are throwing a ring of steel around tonight's live episode of Coronation Street over fears it has been targeted by terrorist group Al-Qaeda.\\"The Sun, 9 Dec 2010, News Corporation Later that morning, however, Greater Manchester Police issued a statement saying that they \\"have categorically not been made aware of any threat from Al-Qaeda or any other proscribed organisation.\\" The statement said that Granada had approached the police to assist a private security firm to help ensure that the \\"live programme went ahead without outside interference\\", but \\"to reiterate there is no specific intelligence threat to Coronation Street or any such event\\" The Sun published a correction on 28 December. The Guardian pointed out that the apology had been negotiated by the Press Complaints Commission.

His gallantry was rewarded by his promotion, probably by Sir George Byng, to the rank of commander; in 1727 he was advanced to be a captain, appointed to command HMS Fox, and sent to the coast of Carolina, where he was for some time under the orders of Captain George Anson.

It corresponds to the present provinces of Misamis Occidental, Misamis Oriental, Camiguin, Bukidnon, part of Zamboanga del Norte, Lanao del Sur and Lanao del Norte, and part of Cotabato. History Misamis takes its name from an old settlement at the mouth of the Panguil Bay once populated by Subanen, now the city of Ozamiz. Misamis is believed derived from the term kuyamis, a term for a sweet variety of coconut. However, as a result of continued raids by Moros from Lanao, the Subanens retreated into the interior and Visayan and Bukidnon settlers occupied the coast. Misamis was part of the province of Cebu until it was made into separate corregimiento in the late 18th century. By 1818, Misamis was organized as a province covering the region from Dapitan in the west, up to Gingoog in the east and as far as Cotabato and Lanao del Sur in the south. Effective control, however, was limited to the coast. For most of the 17th and 18th centuries, Misamis remained vulnerable to the Moro slave raiders. Forts were constructed, the principal ones being in Misamis (Fuerte dela Concepcion y del Triunfo), Iligan and Cagayan de Misamis. The population of Misamis gradually increased during the 19th century due largely to the influx of settlers from Cebu and Bohol. Misamis used to be a part of Cebu. In 1818, it became a \\"corregimento\\" made up of four \\"partidos\\" or divisions: Partido de Misamis, Partido de Dapitan, Partido de Cagayan and Partido de Catarman. During the latter part of the 19th century, Misamis was one of the six districts of Mindanao and, later, one of the seven districts in Mindanao and Sulu at the close of the Spanish era with Cagayan de Misamis (now Cagayan de Oro) as its capital. When it was still a part of the district of Cebu, there were twelve Spaniards and nine Filipinos who successively served as \\"governadore\\" with Mayor Carabello as the first governor in 1874. In 1917, following the organization of the Department of Mindanao and Sulu, the province of Misamis lost the territory of Iligan to the province of Lanao. In 1929, the Philippine Legislature passed Act No. 3537 creating the provinces of Misamis Occidental and Misamis Oriental.

Thomas Arnold, MD Life Arnold was born in Leicester. He was educated at the University of Edinburgh, where he took an MD, and became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, and of the Royal Medical Society of Edinburgh. While studying medicine at the University of Edinburgh under William Cullen (1710-1790) he became a Freemason and was initiated in the Lodge Holyrood House (Saint Luke), No.44 in 1763.Cooper, Robert L D, Ed. 2010. Famous Scottish Freemasons, pp 17-18. He practised in Leicester, where he became owner and conductor of a large lunatic asylum. The Leicester Infirmary was established in 1771 to provide medical care to paupers and the poor. Arnold was appointed physician to the infirmary that year. The need for accommodation of insane people soon became evident and an asylum to house lunatics was constructed in 1782 but remained vacant until 1794 because of financial problems. When the asylum opened for patients, Arnold, James Vaughn, and later Robert Bree were appointed physicians. Arnold and Vaughn, both psychiatrists in Leicester were professional rivals over the years. Arnold’s tenure with the Infirmary and asylum lasted from 1721-1776 and 1784-1815. His son, Thomas Graham Arnold received his Medicinae Doctor (MD) at Cambridge University in 1795 and appointed physician to the asylum that same year serving with his father until 1800. Another son, William Withering Arnold, received his MD at Cambridge and served on the asylum staff from 1800 to 1840. Arnold published a two-volume work titled Observations on the Nature, Kinds, Causes and Prevention of Insanity, the first volume appearing in 1782 and the second in 1806. Volume one included chapters on whether insanity was more common in England than elsewhere, chapters on the definition and arrangement of insanity, and a chapter on the dissected brain. Volume two discussed the causes of insanity and its prevention. A third volume on treatment appeared in 1809. Arnold’s approach to the treatment of insane people was humane. A set of rules for patients’ treatment included firm management, temperance in food and drink, sleep, exercise, regulation of passions, rational views of God and religion, and attention to the imagination. He opposed the use of chains to control; yet used the straitjacket on patients at times. He proposed a new classification of insanity based upon symptoms when causation was unknown. He noted in his books that the operation of mind and body influenced each other. Arnold’s classification divided mental illness into two major groups: \\"ideal\\" and \\"notional.\\" Each group contained numerous subdivisions and many were interchangeable. He defined ideal insanity \\"as that state of mind in which a person imagines he sees, hears or otherwise perceives or converses with persons or things that have no existence … or if he perceives external objects as they really exist has yet erroneous and absurd ideas.\\" (Observations on the Nature, Kinds, Causes and Prevention of Insanity, vol. 1, p. 56.) He described notional insanity as \\"that state of mind in which a person sees, hears or otherwise perceives external objects as they really exist as objects of sense, yet conceives such notions of powers, properties … as often grossly erroneous or unreasonable to the common sense of the sober and judicious import of mankind.\\" (Observations on the Nature, Kinds, Causes and Prevention of Insanity, vol. 1, p. 57.) Arnold’s classifications of mental illness proved too detailed for general acceptance. He died at Leicester 2 September 1816. Works His main works are: *Observations on the Nature, Kinds, Causes, and Prevention of Insanity, Lunacy, or Madness, London and Leicester, 1782, 1786. *A Case of Hydrophobia successfully treated, 1793. *Observations on the Management of the Insane, 1809. In the first of these he examined and compared the opinions of ancient and modern writers on the subject. It includes cases related from the author's experience.

He and his family left after Israel occupied the Sinai Peninsula during the 1967 War. His wife Fatima reportedly lost her eyesight due to an Israeli air strike and they moved to Cairo. Mossad When Al-Hawan couldn't find a job in Cairo, he traveled to Greece to earn his living on a ship. He met a woman with whom he fell in love, but who was reportedly a Mossad agent and who convinced him to work at her father's company. There he met an undercover Mossad agent posing as a Syrian who asked Al-Hawan to return to Egypt and gather information regarding the ships that were sailing in the Egyptian channel. Egyptian Intelligence Al-Hawan opened a grocery store and began to collect information for his bosses but he soon developed some doubts about their intentions. He went to the headquarters of the General Intelligence Service (GIS) and met with Rais Zakariya (General Mohammed Abdul Salam Al-Mahgoub) whom he informed him about his experiences with the people he worked with. The GIS recruited him to provide the Israelis with false information for the next six years. Israel provided Al-Hawan with the most advanced transmitting device at the time, but once Al-Hawan arrived in Egypt he sent a message with it saying, \\"From Egyptian intelligence to Mossad, thank you for your cooperation with us during the recent period.\\" http://gate.ahram.org.eg/News/336932.aspx Retirement In January 1976, while collecting some info for the Mossad under the supervision of the Egyptian intelligence, an army vehicle hit Al-Hawan causing him a major injury in his right leg that he says could have easily been cured, had the doctors been more competent. The injury was followed by damage to the right eye as a result of using invisible ink. He requested retirement which was approved by President Sadat in December 1977.

But, although scarce any > attention has been paid to the state of criminal jurisprudence, by revising > the penal statutes; yet, with the increasing mildness of manners, the > officers of the law have declined to raise prosecutions for inflicting those > rigorous punishments.H Arnot, The History of Edinburgh (1799), reprinted > Edinburgh 1988, pp.172-3 In 1777 Arnot published a \\"fanciful metaphysical treatise\\", called an 'Essay on Nothing,' which originally was read before the debating club called the Speculative Society, and made himself unpopular by his sarcasms. However, he was later a regular participant in church activities, and his contributions to the Society were recognised by the Edinburgh magistrates, who gave him the freedom of the city. Arnot was a favourite subject with John Kay, the Edinburgh caricaturist, who took full advantage of the extreme slimness of his figure.

At the Cabildo of 22 May 1810, he voted along with Juan Nepomuceno Solá, who proposed to substitute the Viceroy and that the Buenos Aires Cabildo take control of the government until such time a congress of representatives to the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata could be convened.Actas capitulares desde el 21 hasta el 25 de mayo de 1810 en Buenos Aires. On 27 May he replaced Manuel Belgrano as secretary of the Commerce Consulate of Buenos Aires, as the former became a member of the Primera Junta. Castex was a representative for Catamarca Province to the assembly gathered in 1812 and dissolved by the First Triumvirate. In 1813 he became acting secretary to the Supreme Court of Argentina, with the legal reforms instituted by the Asamblea del Año XIII. = Appellate court = On the same year he served as council to the Appellate court.

On 2 March 1815 he became a member of the Appellate Court — which replaced the Real Audiencia de Buenos Aires — under the direction of Miguel Mariano de Villegas. On 20 April of the same year the administration of Carlos María de Alvear fell, after the rebellion of colonel Ignacio Álvarez Thomas, chief of the army sent against José Artigas, the opposition of the interior of the country, and the lack of support in Buenos Aires. On 23 April the Appellate Court, through Castex and Tagle initiated a process for excesses in handling the public administration, by order of the Cabildo, against Agustín José Donado, Gervasio Posadas, Juan Larrea, Nicolás Herrera, and Elías Galván among others, all adherents of the recently deposed regime. The accused suffered the loss of their property and exile. Castex took part in the writing of the instruction Project to the representatives of the Provincias Unidas del Río de la Plata to the Congress of Tucumán, which established Argentina's independence from Spain in 1816. = Mission to Santa Fe = Juan Martín de Pueyrredón.

Like many conceptual artists, she uses materials not usually perceived as artistic in nature; her assemblage are based on the phenomenal cultural American icon of Barbie the fashion doll. She then uses found object methods and a variety of craft skills to accrue her pieces of recycled art. Background and early life Salleé was born in Roswell, New Mexico on January 18, 1946. Her father was a cartoonist who worked for Walt Disney; her mother was a seamstress who also worked as waitstaff. They were divorced when Salleé was four. Salleé's mother would subsequently remarry; this short marriage would result in two more daughters, who were separated from the family after the divorce. Salleé grew up with no particular attachment to Barbie; she did not even own one while growing up. She was also a bit of a tomboy. Salleé did not settle anywhere for a long period; by age 25, she had lived in 35 different places in four states and attended nine schools. As an adult, Salleé became a successful bank teller. However, she began to develop medical problems; from about 1993 onwards, she was plagued by fibromyalgia as well as some ill effects of menopause. By the time of her early retirement, she had over 25 years expertise in the field of bank fraud investigation. Her retirement at age 55 was caused by the debilitating effects of the fibromyalgia. Although unable to be employed, she wished to remain active. Career as an artist Salleé's first artistic creations were in fabric arts, where she used a technique she dubbed \\"Fabricollage\\" to fabricate portraits and pictures from scraps of cloth glued together. Besides works of fabric art, she also created beadwork, as well as doll clothing and accessories. Salleé segued into altering Barbies after constructing a series of unique mermaids. Salleé then turned to altering Barbies as her medium in 2006, when she first saw them in an art gallery on Market Street in San Francisco. In the altered Barbie movement, Barbie is \\"...a kind of three-dimensional blank canvas that allows artists to display their reverence, humor or biting satire.\\" Salleé was at first hesitant to venture into altering Barbies, as Mattel has a history of legal action against parodists. In Salleé's specific case, she stated her motivation as, \\"I can do just about anything I think of with a Barbie. With any other medium, it just gets boring.\\" Her re-creations of Barbie usually feature satiric commentary on social mores and political trends; the \\"wickedly funny\\" pieces often flaunt a dark humor that not everyone appreciates. As part of her creative process, Salleé re-sculpts Barbies, which takes expertise developed through systematic trial and error because Mattel manufactured Barbies in varying formulations of plastic. Salleé also uses her skills as carpenter, fashion designer, and craftsperson to alter the Barbies in her dioramas. The constituents of her dioramas and sculptures come from garage sales, flea markets, and thrift stores. While Salleé's creations sometimes feature passive Barbies being \\"Barbie-Q-ed\\", turned into chess pieces, or the like, they also fight monsters, engage in kinky rituals, or are transmogrified into hybrid beings such as centaurs, insects, or trees. They include Barbie's Last Sleepover, a restaging of da Vinci's The Last Supper, as well as showing Barbie as a pregnant Virgin Mary, or as Mary comforting a dying Christ figure. However, even more than religious references, Barbie's nudity seems to provoke strong responses from viewers. Salleé's penchant for adding nipples to bare-chested Barbies riles some people. As Salleé remarks, \\"Nipples are my specialty...I can give her a beautiful set of nipples. She likes that.\\" Salleé has also denoted her critics' attitude as, \\"Heaven forbid that Barbie should have nipples.\\" Salleé is adamant that she does not create pornographic Barbies; indeed, she insists she is not into defaming Barbie. As a result of the controversy, Salleé's lease on her studio contains a provision forbidding display of her religious-themed or nude creations in a manner that would be visible from outside the shop. In 2007, at the National Barbie Doll Convention, Salleé entered nine of her works in the altered Barbie juried show. One was rejected as \\"too distasteful\\"; the other eight all won prizes, including three first place ribbons. She then moved from San Francisco to Vallejo, California to open her One of a Kind Barbies gallery to display her work. Lavonne Salleé has altered over 250 Barbies to date; they have been acquired by collectors both nationally and worldwide, from patrons as far- flung as Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. Her activities have widened to include offering workshops in Barbie alteration to other aspiring artists.

It is bordered by railways to the east, Paula López and Parque Alameda to the north, El Peral to the west, and the South External Round of Valladolid. It was developed in the 1980s and it was not completed until nearly 2008, being one of the youngest zones in the city.  History  Some builders of the city who compounded the \\"Industrial Cooperative of Valladolid Construction\\" set the idea: a new neighbourhood following the models of the Garden city movement and provide ground as cheap as possible. To move forward they create a society called in Spain \\"Constructures Vallisoletanos Reunidos S.A.\\". That's the origin of the zone name. They choose the current location, in the south of the city, because the low number of owners would make easier the development. 200 hectares were bought and the first estimations include 47.300 inhabitants, around 61 houses per hectare, and a density of 273 inhabitants per hectare. Few hectares among the 200 acquired belong to the Asuncion College, owned by a group of nuns who wanted to retain it and to enable it to serve the new neighborhood as a church. Finally the nuns rejected the College and the Society COVARESA installed there its headquarters. In 1983 the Junta of Castile and León was formed and some voices purposed the Asuncion College as a headquarters for the new administration. In October 1983 the Society COVARESA give the building to the Junta of Castile and León. Another idea was seize the wooded zones surrounding some irrigation canals. Although the \\"green aparience\\" of the development, some groups and associations claim that the wooded zone of \\"Pinar de Antequera\\" was in danger because this expansion to the south. The difficulties to start the works and the doubts about the huge size of the project make the Society reconsider some aspects, reducing from 200 hectares to 70 hectares. At last, between 1988 and 1989 the zone was urbanized: streets, paths, pipeline, electrification,... The construction companies acquired parcels and designed the publicity, crowding the local radios and newspapers. A problem promptly noticed by the developers was the lack of public ground on which to locate services as schools, sport or commercial equipment,... What had space was a church, opened by the Valladolid Bishop in 1991. Newsagents, supermarkets, and other commercial services began to be opened soon. A neighbour association was created to remind of the problems that the zone suffers, based on the lack of equipment.  Transport  It is connected to the centre city by bus. Three lines, two of them with a frequency of about ten minutes link the neighborhood with main malls, bus and rail station, and other important places of Valladolid, such as Paseo Zorrilla – a highly commercial avenue – or some colleges of Universidad de Valladolid.

Ashbury was born in London in 1638, into a prominent family, was educated at Eton College, and entered the army. Quartered in Ireland when the protectorate of Richard Cromwell came to an end, he was one of the officers who were dismissed under the régime of the revived Rump Parliament, and he was also one of those who, in the royalist interest, seized Dublin Castle in December 1659. At the Restoration he was rewarded by the lieutenancy of a company of foot which Charles II granted to the city of Dublin, and the new lord-lieutenant, the Duke of Ormond, made Ashbury in 1662 one of the gentlemen of his retinue and deputy master of the revels. In 1682 he became master of the revels and patentee. The duties or privileges of the latter post seem to have been nominal, since for years the only playhouse in Dublin, the Smock Alley Theatre or Orange Street Theatre, had been closed. But Ashbury, whose first wife was the sister of an actor, seems at this time to have turned his attention to professional acting and to have given instructions in the art with eminent success. About 1674 both he and Mrs. Betterton are mentioned as teaching the Princess Anne, afterwards queen, to play Semandra in Lee's 'Mithridates,' when acted at Whitehall by persons of high rank.cf. Agnes Strickland's Queens of England (1852), vii. 16 When, in celebration of the overthrow of the Stuart cause in Ireland, 'Othello' was acted (December 1691) at Dublin by amateurs, most of them officers of the garrison, Ashbury, who superintended the performance and played Iago, is spoken of as the only professional actor among the performers. About the same time he engaged in London a company which included Wilks, and attempted to revive the drama in Ireland by reopening the theatre in Orange Street with 'Othello' on 23 March 1692. By skilful management and by encouraging promising histrionic talent – Booth and Quin were introduced by him to the boards - Ashbury secured for the Dublin stage a great reputation. He himself was an excellent actor, and his second wife, also an actress, gave him material assistance. Colonel Careless in the 'Committee,' and Don Quixote were among his best parts. In his 78th year he continued to act with success, and he survived to the age of 82, dying in the summer or autumn of 1720.

The resolution was adopted by 14 votes to one against from Turkey and no abstentions. The Turkish representative said that the island did not have a single government since 1963, though it would continue to implement the resolution. Resolution =Observations= The Security Council noted that the Cypriot government had agreed to the continued presence of UNFICYP on the island. A solution to the conflict was down to the Cypriots themselves, and there was a unique opportunity to achieve a lasting settlement. There was progress in the peace talks though the Council remained concerned that progress was slow. It welcomed the implementation of confidence-building measures by both Cyprus and Northern Cyprus and encouraged further crossing points to be opened along the Green Line. The Limnitis crossing opened in October 2010 which was further welcomed. The Council remained convinced that a durable settlement of the Cyprus dispute would be beneficial for all Cypriots and the situation in the buffer zone would improve if both sides accepted the 1989 aide-mémoire used by the United Nations. It was convinced that undermining the credibility of the United Nations was detrimental to the peace process. Furthermore, the Council welcomed progress in demining activities, the efforts of the Committee on Missing Persons, and agreed that the active participation of civil society groups and bi-communal contacts was essential to the political process. =Acts= The resolution welcomed the progress of negotiations and the prospect of progress in the near future towards a settlement. In this regard, it called on the two Cypriot leaders to intensify negotiations, improve their atmosphere, and increase the participation of civil society. Furthermore, both sides were called upon to participate in consultations on the demarcation of the buffer zone and the 1989 aide-mémoire. The Turkish Cypriot side was urged to restore the military status quo in Strovilia that existed there before June 30, 2000. Finally, the Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon was requested to submit a report by June 1, 2011 on the implementation of the current resolution.

He also served as alcalde ordinario (ordinary mayor) in Mexico City.  Early life  Ceballos was born between the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. He settled in Texas in 1723, living there for twelve years.  Governor in Texas  For seven of those years (1724–1731) he served as captain of the Presidio of Our Lady of Loreto in La Bahia del Espiritu Santo. In 1730, he helped restore Querétaro missions in San Antonio. His success in this mission was such that the following year, in 1731, the viceroy of New Spain, Juan de Acuña, appointed him governor of Texas. He arrived to Los Adaes, Texas' capital, on April 28, 1731, carrying several hundred of heads of livestock and many supplies. He promoted the establishment of Spanish settlers from the Canary Islands in San Antonio in 1731 and the military campaign against the Apaches between the rivers of San Xavier (San Gabriel) and San Saba in 1732. The expedition consisted of 160 Spaniards and sixty Native Americans. However, the Apaches defeated them. A brief period of peace followed. Later, in 1734, Bustillo resigned as governor, replaced by Manuel de Sandoval, and he returned to Mexico.  Mexico  In Mexico, he won major political offices. He was appointed alcalde ordinaro (ordinary mayor) of Mexico City. In 1751, he was a member of the Audiencia Real, the highest administrative court of New Spain. The Audiencia approved the founding of the San Xavier missions, although this had raised objections in 1746. Three years later, on December 21, 1754 (when he was deputy governor and acting governor of Coahuila), Bustillo and Franciscan Alonso Giraldo de Terreros founded Mission San Lorenzo Apache, near San Fernando de Austria, Coahuila.  Legacy  The San Saba River was named by Bustillo y Ceballos in 1732. He called it Río de San Sabá de las Nueces, because he and his troops had arrived on the feast day of St. Sabbas, a 6th-century monk.  References   External links  * Technology.php?

November 23, 2010, Provincetown, Massachusetts, U.S.) was a Greek-born American abstract painter, sculptor and tree peony breeder.  Army Service: 1942–1945  Daphnis served in the United States Army from 1942 to 1945. During his service he was asked to put his skills as a painter to use and created camouflage for use on enormous military relief maps. It is speculated by some art critics that it was while painting camouflage that Daphnis developed the signature flatness later recognizable in his abstract geometric paintings.  Education and Training  While Daphnis is generally regarded as a self-taught artist, he did pursue some formal training. Following his military service, Daphnis trained at the Art Students League of New York. From 1949-1951, Daphnis studied in Paris. From 1951-1952, he continued his studies at the Istituto Statale D'Arte in Firenze, Italy. In 1952 he returned again briefly to Paris for additional study. Biomorphic Paintings: 1945–1949  Daphnis' artistic style evolved throughout his career. He began as a realist and following the war, moved on to biomorphic forms with a Surrealist influence. From March 24-April 11, 1947, Daphnis had an eponymous solo exhibition at the Contemporary Arts Gallery at 106 E 57th St, New York at which his biomorphic paintings were featured. The exhibition included both oil paintings and watercolors. It was his second show at the gallery and in his catalog essay, art historian Gordon B. Washburn found new promise in the works: \\"There is hardly one of them, nevertheless, which in its far distances or on its horizon, has failed to keep a promise of renewed life and ultimate happiness. Once, in his youthful years, Daphnis painted a vision of heaven and hell; but in those days his purgatory was as charming as his paradise, the devils a toy army. A new definition of good and evil has now been found, and in returning to a world of greater hope and faith he seizes the beauty of the natural world - especially its plant-life whose forms he has always deeply loved - with a thicker complex of emotions. His self-taught art, once picked out with one finger, its tunes like those heard on a sweet but lonely hillside from a shepherd's flute, are not polyphonic. Planning, close organization, and definition enter the pictures; and with those controls comes an abstraction which is increasing.\\"Washburn, Gordon. \\"Daphnis\\". Contemporary ArtsGallery, New York, 1947. In a 1985 exhibition review, Grace Glueck described these works for the New York Times: \\"Before developing his reductive line-color- plane approach...Daphnis was involved with biomorphic imagery. Part of his inspiration came from a botanical hobby: hybridizing tree peonies, an avocation he pursues to this day. At Kouros, a group of rarely seen canvases and watercolors from 1947-48 deals with organic, floral and undersea forms, in poetic compositions of luminous color. Despite their amorphous look, they have a well-ordered structure that doesn't seem too far removed from the artist's later concerns. In one of the strongest - called, in fact, Hybridization - plant leaves and stems, bathed in a shimmering light, are beautifully locked in a harmonious balance of shapes and hues.\\" Color-plane theory and hard- edge painting: 1950s-2010  In the 1950s, Daphnis traveled back to Greece with the assistance of the G.I. Bill. While there he began to see the stark, clear light change his perception of the buildings and forms around him. Structures were simplified and became geometric planes of pure color. Following this trop, Daphnis developed his color-plane theory and focused on geometric abstraction with a restricted color palette of only black, white and primary colors. This became his signature style and these works are often characterized as being painted in the Hard-edge style of geometric abstraction. His style is frequently compared with Piet Mondrian; however, Daphnis saw Mondrian's approach as a jumping off point. Daphnis was also described as an abstract imagist, a term which arose from a 1961 exhibition at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York City, called American Abstract Expressionists and Imagists, in which he participated. In the late 1980s, Daphnis' style evolved again as he began to integrate new forms of computer technology into his practice. Expanding on his color palette, he also incorporated a few additional colors. Daphnis' employment of computer- generated graphics and use of the Atari ST to develop his radical digital landscapes can best be understood as a proto New Media attitude. Gallery Representation For nearly forty years Nassos Daphnis was represented by the Leo Castelli Gallery. Castelli gave him 17 solo exhibitions in his gallery and regularly included his work in group exhibitions featuring artists such as Jasper Johns, Frank Stella, Robert Rauschenberg and Lee Bontecou. Castelli also regularly submitted Daphnis' works to exhibitions at a variety of galleries and institutions. For instance, from November 9-December 9, 1964, Daphnis' EPX 28-64 was included in \\"Art in Wood Today\\" as presented by the United States Plywood Corporation with the assistance of Dr. Richard McLanathan of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts at the company's new New York headquarters. Other artists in this exhibition included Robert Indiana, Louise Nevelson and Andy Warhol. Similarly, from May 16-June 10, 1967, Daphnis' work was exhibited in dialogue with Nicholas Krushenick's in \\"Paintings/Collages Krushenick/Daphnis\\" at the Franklin Siden Gallery in Detroit. In his later years, Daphnis also exhibited at the Eaton/Schoen Gallery in San Francisco and the Anita Shapolsky Gallery in New York. From May 6-July 4, 2008, Anita Shapolsky Gallery's \\"Masters of Abstraction\\" included work by Daphnis along with Seymour Boardman, Grace Hartigan, Joan Mitchell and Aaron Siskind. In August 2015, Richard Taittinger Gallery announced its exclusive representation of the Estate of Nassos Daphnis. Daphnis received his first solo exhibition at the gallery, Pixel Fields, from September 17-October 24, 2015 and his diptych 4-A-78, 4-B-78, 1978 was included in the group exhibition, Ballet Mecanique from January 16-February 20, 2016. Reviewing Ballet Mecanique for Whitewall Magazine, Emory Loppicolo discussed with the gallery how Daphnis' work could be contemplated in dialogue with Mario Merz's work from the 1970s and 1980s: \\"Merz and Daphnis were both iconic masters of the 20th century and both had first-hand experience with wartime. Their contact with World War II affected their artistic practice and theoretical perspectives, since machines played a critical role. Meanwhile, the younger generation’s concern with process, format and the relationship to industrial mediums can act as a continuity to Merz and Daphnis’ achievements.\\" City Walls, Inc. In 1969, Daphnis was commissioned by City Walls. Incorporated to do a wall painting at 26th Street and Madison Avenue in New York City. In 1971, he was commissioned again to do a wall painting at West Side Highway and 47th Street in New York. From 1971 to 1980, City Walls, Inc. installed public murals in New York City. Neither of Daphnis' murals remains today. Public Collections Today Daphnis' work is in the collections of many significant public art institutions.

He created approximately 500 tree peonies and 48 of them were named and registered with the American Tree Peony Society and further propagated. His interest in tree peonies began in 1938 when he met William H. Gratwick of Linwood Gardens, a prominent breeder of tree peonies. Daphnis eventually became partners with Gratwick in the business and art of hybridizing tree peonies, creating many beautiful cultivars and naming them after artists and figures in Greek mythology. In a 1984 interview Daphnis described the beginning of his relationship with the tree peony: \\"...In those days (1938), the trip from New York to Pavilion took at least 10 hours. I arrived late in the evening, so it wasn't until the next morning that I had a chance to walk around the grounds. Bill Gratwick and I were strolling down the long driveway when suddenly my breath was taken by the incredible color of rows of tree peonies in full bloom. I was familiar with all types of cultivated flowers from having worked for seven or eight years in my uncle's flower shop in New York. But in all that time, I had never seen blossoms like these. Fascinated by their beauty, I asked Bill Gratwick what they were. Tree peonies from Japan, he replied, and he began to tell me how he had gotten the plants. Some he had imported from Japan; some he had grown from seed. All were part of a collection of rare plants he was raising at the nursery he then maintained at the Pavilion estate. ...As a painter, my first impulse was to capture the beauty and elegance of these flowers by doing portraits of each variety. At that time, the Gratwicks were growing about 110 varieties of tree peonies, each of which had been selected for the beauty and perfection of its petal arrangement, color, shape, foliage and length of stem. I did paint a few of the varieties, some singly and others in arrangements. This continued for several years, as I came back each spring until 1942, when I was inducted into the Army...\\" References External links * artnet news Nassos Daphnis' Vibrant Digital Landscapes Dazzle at Richard Taittinger * Richard Taittinger Gallery: Nassos Daphnis Pixel Fields Exhibition September 17-October 25, 2015 * ARTNEWS Richard Taittinger Gallery Now Reps Nassos Daphnis Estate, Plans Show * Richard Taittinger Gallery: Nassos Daphnis Artist Page * Nassos Daphnis at the Anita Shapolsky Gallery * New York Times DANCE REVIEW: A Canvas for Evoking a Formal Spirit by Jack Anderson (2-11-1998) * New York Times Art in Review by Pepe Karmel (11-3-1995) * New York Times ART: 'Color: Pure and Simple' is Displayed in Stamford by Vivien Raynor (11-8-1987) * New York Times 5 Artists to Get Greenburger Awards (3-25-1987) * New York Times GARDENING: Choosing Plants for Windy Roofs by Linda Yang (2-5-1987) * New York Times ART: Daphnis Paintings on View at 3 Galleries by Grace Glueck (3-1-1985) * Smithsonian Archive of American Art Nassos Daphnis Oral History Interview (4-9-1968) * Smithsonian Archive of American Art Nassos Daphnis Oral History Interview (9-6-1964) * New York Times Obituary 1914 births 2010 deaths 20th-century American painters American male painters 21st-century American painters Disease-related deaths in Massachusetts Greek emigrants to the United States ","title":"Nassos Daphnis"},{"id":"30076152","text":"Susta () is a rural municipality located in Parasi District of Province No. 5 of Nepal.

It screened eight films from around the world that dealt with human rights issues at a macro as well as at a micro level; from global concerns to indigenous issues. The festival coincided with the International Human Rights Day on 10 December 2010.  Program  The eight documentaries screened at Flashpoint Human Rights Film Festival were part of the Matter of Act program at Movies That Matter film festival 2010 held in March 2010 at The Hague, Netherlands. The films highlight the work done by human rights defenders across the world and the dangers they face in their work, which are not always in countries where civil liberties are honored. Festival director Sridhar Rangayan said, \\"I saw these films as a jury member at the festival in the Netherlands and was so moved by the films, I was determined to bring them to India to share with audiences here.\\" The films dealt with human rights issues like human trafficking and prostitution of children; Violations of international laws on war and peace; Atrocities under military regimes; Religious fundamentalism and homophobia; women's rights and honor killings; and civil war and the killing of innocents. Each day of the screenings, panel discussions were held on each topic screened. The panelists included filmmakers Bishakha Datta, Vinta Nanda; rights activist Priti Patkar, advocates Colin Gonsalves, PA Sebastian, Flavia Agnes and Usha Andevar. The panels were moderated by Vinta Nanda, Dalip Daswani and Gargi Sen respectively. Three of the activists portrayed in the documentaries: Rebiya Kadeer, Somaly Mam, and Mu Sochua, have been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Messages sent by them and some of the film-makers were shared with the audience at the festival. Film director and rights activist Mahesh Bhatt inaugurated the festival by asking \\"how do we as a society... go about igniting change in 'this climate of collective apathy to human suffering'\\" together with theatre actress and director Dolly Thakore. Of the festival, she said \\"This will open up avenues and provide a direction to youngsters\\". A wide range of questions and discussions emerged from the audience of social activists, filmmakers, and film buffs, such as whether honor killings are different from stonings, how different are democracies with cartels and autocracies, what the relationship is between violence and families, and how individuals can effect change in the world.  Organizers  The festival was conceived and founded by Sridhar Rangayan, who is also the festival director. Gargi Sen is the co-director. The festival was organized by Solaris Pictures (Mumbai) along with Magic Lantern Foundation (New Delhi) and Movies That Matter (Netherlands) in association with the Alliance française.

Publication history  The Orcs of Thar (GAZ10) was written by Bruce Heard, with cover art by Clyde Caldwell, and interior illustrations by Jim Holloway. It was published by TSR in 1988 and included two 48-page books, a large color map, cardstock counters, and an outer folder. Editing was by Gary L. Thomas, and cartography by Dave Sutherland. The Orcs of Thar was the tenth in TSR's series of D&D; Gazetteers; each Gazetteer detailed part of D&D;'s Known World campaign setting, providing information on culture, society, history, geography, economics, and prominent NPCs of a given nation. The \\"Orc Wars\\" board game first appeared in Dragon Issue 132, although the game's counters in The Orcs of Thar are printed on heavier stock than was used in the magazine.  Contents  The Orcs of Thar covers the fictional Broken Lands that are inhabited by humanoids such as orcs, goblins, and bugbears. The \\"Player's Guide\\" is written for those who want to play orc player characters, and includes a description of the orcish view of the world, an overview of the Broken Lands, character creation rules, and \\"Thar's Manual of Good Conduct\\". The \\"Players' Guide\\" provides the history of the various humanoid races as seen through their own eyes, and describes the situation in the Broken Lands with an account of the ten tribes, their beliefs, and the areas they inhabit. It includes rules for generating humanoid player characters such as kobolds, goblins, orcs, hobgoblins, gnolls, bugbears, ogres, and trolls. Tables and suggestions for generating height, physical appearance, outlook, and various skills are available to add depth to the characters. \\"Thar's Manual of Good Conduct\\", a guide to portraying characters' obnoxious behavior and battle- lust, comes as part of the \\"Players' Guide\\" but is intended to be pulled out of the booklet, cut up, and stapled into a smaller booklet. The booklet covers orcish shamans, important humanoid leaders, campaigning in the Broken Lands, and an adventure scenario. The gazetteer includes rules for adaptation to AD&D;, and rules for a simple orc-conquest boardgame. The \\"Dungeon Master’s Booklet\\" gives the “real” history of the humanoids and details on the major NPCs in the Broken Lands. It includes new rules for playing shamans and wiccas as character classes, as well as nonhuman spell-casters described in the D&D; Master Set, clerics and magic-users of the humanoid races. The \\"Dungeon Master’s Booklet\\" provides information about the best way to stage and present humanoid adventures, along with adventure outlines. It presents details of the orcish city Oenkmar, allowing humanoids and humans to explore, and lists the rules for tlachtli, a ball game played in Oenkmar. The board game included is called Orc Wars, and is set in and around the Broken Lands and features a power struggle to become the top humanoid.  Reception  Jim Bambra reviewed The Orcs of Thar for Dragon magazine #148 (August 1989). Bambra wrote that the original 1974 version of D&D; gave \\"very skimpy\\" guidelines on using monsters as player characters, and that subsequent editions became more human and demihuman oriented. With The Orcs of Thar, \\"the D&D; game returns to its roots by allowing players to take on the roles of monsters: dirty, smelly, depraved humanoids, the kind of scum that players love to hate. [...] Now, The Orcs of Thar gives the opportunity to play the bad guys in a detailed and humorous campaign.\\" He considered the material \\"fun to read and informative\\", which \\"does an excellent job of describing the lifestyles of orcs and other humanoids\\". He enjoyed Jim Holloway's \\"fun-filled art\\", which does \\"an excellent job of capturing the flavor of humanoid life\\". Bambra stated that the character generation system handles the different types of humanoid creatures in a smooth and integrated manner: \\"Being big has its advantages, since you start with more Hit Dice than the other creatures, but it takes you far longer to gain additional Hit Dice than it does for the lowly kobolds, goblins, or orcs.\\" He wrote that the adventure outlines \\"do a superb job of capturing the flavor and atmosphere of humanoid adventuring, with plenty of opportunities for groveling and attacking the hated humans\\". He also called the \\"Orc Wars\\" board game \\"good fun\\". Bambra concluded the review by saying, \\"The Orcs of Thar combines neat monster descriptions and backgrounds with a colorful and humorous narrative style of presentation. Couple this with its high-quality graphic presentation, and you end up with a product that no one should be without. The Orcs of Thar is wonderfully conceived and executed. Even if the idea of having humanoid characters doesn’t appeal to you, the background material in The Orcs of Thar still makes it a valuable contribution to your campaign.\\" According to Lawrence Schick in his 1991 book Heroic Worlds, The Orcs of Thar is \\"written in a humorous style that presents orcs as lovable goofballs who just happen to enjoy slaughter and pillage\\".

It belongs to the Ottilien Congregation. History The abbey was established as a mission on 3 August 1922, after the Ottilien Congregation received permission to do missionary work in the Apostolic Vicariate of Natal. The mission was headed by apostolic vicar Thomas Spreiter, who had been working in German East Africa since 1900. With the help of the Benedictine Sisters of Tutzing, a high school was built, where Spreiter taught religion. A newly built monastery building was finished in 1949, and a church was consecrated in 1953. On 21 June 1968, the abbey was promoted to the rank of conventual priory, and on 25 February it became an abbey. Since 29 June 1998, the abbey's monks also oversee the former mission house of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, the St. Boniface House Waldfrieden, 50 km north- west of Windhoek, where they work with the Missionary Benedictine Sisters of Tutzing. A training school for Inkamana's young monks was founded in 1992 in Howick, and moved in 1998 to nearby Cedara. Its current abbot is Godfrey Sieber, also the author of a history of the mission. The abbey's priest is also the custodian of the Ngome Marian Shrine, where between 1955 and 1971 the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared ten times to Sister Reinolda May of the Missionary Benedictine Sisters. Sister Reinolda, who died on 1 April 1981, is buried at Inkamana Abbey. During a 1997 fire in the hospice, three bed-ridden patients died, as did Sr. Ann Thole, who tried to rescue them.

Headquartered in Duisburg, Germany, the PCC Group has more than 3,500 employees worldwide. It comprises some 80 subsidiaries located at 41 sites in 18 countries, with production facilities in Europe, Asia and the USA. The sole shareholder of the group´s parent and holding company PCC SE is Waldemar Preussner, chairman of the administrative board.  History  In October 1993, Waldemar Preussner and partners established Petro Carbo Chem Rohstoffhandelsgesellschaft mbH (today PCC Trade & Services GmbH), a commodity trading company, in Duisburg. In 1998, PCC AG was formed as a spin-off and in February 2007 converted into a Societas Europaea (SE). The PCC group has expanded and diversified through acquisitions and project investments. Particularly in Poland and elsewhere in Central and Eastern Europe, PCC acquired various previously state-owned companies, which it then modernized and expanded. In 2010, PCC completed the takeover of a Polish chemicals producer, known today as PCC Rokita SA, the largest group subsidiary. PCC SE has placed minority stakes of two Polish chemical companies on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, PCC Rokita SA (initial public offering in 2014) and PCC Exol SA (2012). Logistics company PCC Intermodal S.A. (IPO in 2009) was delisted from the Warsaw Stock Exchange in 2018. As a major divestiture, in 2009, PCC sold its Polish subgroup PCC Logistics to Deutsche Bahn AG (today DB Cargo Polska). Investments further afield include US specialty surfactants developer PCC Chemax, Inc. Activities are also being pursued in Asia through the acquisition of a total of 50% of Thai polyols and polyurethane producer IRPC Polyol Company Ltd. In Iceland, PCC commissioned, in 2018, a silicon metal production plant at a cost of around US$300 million powered by geothermal energy. In 2018, PCC generated consolidated revenue of €767.5 million. Earnings before interest and other financial items, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) amounted to €99.0 million, and earnings before taxes (EBT) were €19.3 million.  Divisions  The group annual report for 2019 lists 51 material portfolio companies as affiliated entities of PCC SE, allocated to the four divisions: Chemicals, Logistics, Energy and Holding/Projects. = Chemicals = Accounting for a share of around 85 percent, the group´s main revenue generator is the Chemicals division and its five segments Polyols, Surfactants, Chlorine, Specialty Chemicals (including Phosphorus derivatives and Alkylphenols), and Consumer Products, which together realized sales in 2019 of €646.3 million. Its production activities are located primarily in Poland. The largest company is PCC Rokita SA, headquartered in Brzeg Dolny. Among its products are polyether polyols, a feedstock used in the manufacture of PU foams for items such as mattresses. It is also a chlorine producer. PCC Exol SA, Brzeg Dolny, is a Polish manufacturer of surfactants. The largest commodity trading company in the group is PCC Trade & Services GmbH. = Logistics = The Logistics division is dominated by PCC Intermodal S.A., a combined road and rail logistics services provider in Eastern Europe with five wholly owned container transshipment terminals in Poland and Germany. The company operates container block train services between the Polish inland terminals of PCC, seaports located in Germany, and the Benelux countries, among other destinations. = Energy = The Energy division is engaged both in combined heat and power generation and in renewable energy generation with five small hydropower plants (SHPP) in North Macedonia and Bosnia & Herzegovina. = Holding/Projects = This division provides group-wide services such as information technology and finance.

It was signed by U.S. Army Lieutenant General William Harrison, Jr. representing the United Nations Command (UNC), North Korean General Nam Il representing the Korean People's Army (KPA), and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA). The armistice was signed on 27 July 1953, and was designed to \\"ensure a complete cessation of hostilities and of all acts of armed force in Korea until a final peaceful settlement is achieved.\\" During the 1954 Geneva Conference in Switzerland, Chinese Premier and foreign minister Zhou Enlai suggested that a peace treaty should be implemented on the Korean peninsula. However, the US secretary of state, John Foster Dulles, did not accommodate this attempt to achieve such a treaty. A final peace settlement has never been achieved. The signed armistice established the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), the de facto new border between the two nations, put into force a cease-fire, and finalized repatriation of prisoners of war. The DMZ runs close to the 38th parallel and has separated North and South Korea since the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed in 1953. South Korea never signed the Armistice Agreement, due to President Syngman Rhee's refusal to accept having failed to unify Korea by force. China normalized relations and signed a peace treaty with South Korea in 1992. In 1994, China withdrew from the Military Armistice Commission, essentially leaving North Korea and the UN Command as the only participants in the armistice agreement.https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/24/world/chinese-and- south-koreans-formally-establish-relations.html . Retrieved 21 February 2019.https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/03/world/china-backing-north-korea-quits- armistice-commission.html . Retrieved 21 February 2019. In 2011, South Korea stated that North Korea had violated the armistice 221 times. Background By mid-December 1950, the United States was discussing terms for an agreement to end the Korean War. The desired agreement would end the fighting, provide assurances against its resumption, and protect the future security of UNC forces. The United States asked for a military armistice commission of mixed membership that would supervise all agreements. Both sides would need to agree to \\"cease the introduction into Korea of any reinforcing air, ground or naval units or personnel... and to refrain from increasing the level of war equipment and material existing in Korea.\\" The U.S. wished to create a demilitarized zone that would be roughly wide. The proposed agreement would also address the issue of prisoners of war which the U.S. believed should be exchanged on a one-for-one basis. While talk of a possible armistice agreement was circulating, in late May and early June 1951, the President of the Republic of Korea (ROK, South Korea) Syngman Rhee opposed peace talks. He believed the ROK should continue to expand its army in order to march all the way to the Yalu River and completely unify the nation. The UNC did not endorse Rhee's position. Even without UNC support, Rhee and the South Korean government attempted to mobilize the public to resist any halt in the fighting short of the Yalu River. Other ROK officials supported Rhee's ambitions and the National Assembly of South Korea unanimously passed a resolution endorsing a continued fight for an \\"independent and unified country.\\" At the end of June, however, the Assembly decided to support armistice talks, although President Rhee continued to oppose them. Like Syngman Rhee, North Korean leader Kim Il-sung also sought complete unification. The North Korean side was slow to support armistice talks and only on 27 June 1951seventeen days after armistice talks had begundid it change its slogan of \\"drive the enemy into the sea\\" to \\"drive the enemy to the 38th parallel.\\" North Korea was pressured to support armistice talks by its allies the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, whose support was vital to enabling North Korea to continue fighting. Armistice discussions The site of negotiations in 1951 Talks concerning an armistice started 10 July 1951, in Kaesŏng, a North Korean city in North Hwanghae Province near the South Korean border. The two primary negotiators were Chief of Army Staff General Nam Il, a North Korean deputy premier, and United States Vice Admiral Charles Turner Joy. After a period of two weeks, on 26 June 1951, a five-part agenda was agreed upon and this guided talks until the signing of the armistice on 27 July 1953. The items to be discussed were: # Adoption of an agenda. # Fixing a military demarcation line between the two sides so as to establish a demilitarized zone as a basic condition for the cessation of hostilities in Korea. # Concrete arrangements for realization of a ceasefire and armistice in Korea, including the composition, authority and functions of a supervisory organization for carrying out the terms of a truce and armistice. # Arrangements relating to prisoners of war. # Recommendations to the governments of the countries concerned on both sides. Korean Armistice Agreement in English; Records of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Record Group 218; National Archives at College Park, College Park, MD [available through the National Archives Catalog (NAID: 6852876)] After the agenda was decided, talks proceeded slowly. There were lengthy intervals between meetings. The longest gap between discussions started on 23 August 1951, when North Korea and its allies claimed that the conference site in Kaesŏng had been bombed. North Korea requested the UNC conduct an immediate investigation, which concluded there was evidence a UNC aircraft had attacked the conference site. The evidence, however, appeared to be manufactured. The Communists subsequently refused to permit an investigation during daylight hours. Armistice talks did not start again until 25 October 1951. The U.S. would not allow further discussion to take place in Kaesŏng. Panmunjom, a nearby village in Kyŏnggi Province, close to both North and South Korea, was chosen as the new location for deliberations. This was conditional on responsibility for protection of the village being shared by both powers. Colonel-level discussions between the US and North Korean militaries on 11 October 1951 A major, problematic negotiation point was prisoner of war (POW) repatriation. The Communists held 10,000 POWs and the UNC held 150,000 POWs. The PVA, KPA, and UNC could not agree on a system of repatriation because many PVA and KPA soldiers refused to be repatriated to the north, which was unacceptable to the Chinese and North Koreans. In the final armistice agreement, signed on 27 July 1953, a Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, chaired by Indian general K. S. Thimayya, was set up to handle the matter. In 1952, the United States elected a new president, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and on 29 November 1952 the president-elect went to Korea to investigate what might end the Korean War. With the United Nations' acceptance of India's proposed Korean War armistice, the KPA, the PVA, and the UNC ceased fire with the battle line approximately at the Kansas line, a line of U.N. positions north of the 38th parallel which had been established in Operation Rugged. (Library of Congress Catalog Card Number: 56–60005) Upon agreeing to the armistice, the belligerents established the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which has since been patrolled by KPA, ROKA, United States, and Joint UNC forces. Discussions continued slowly because of difficulties regarding demarcation of the border between North and South Korea. China and North Korea expected the line to remain at the 38th Parallel. Within weeks, however, both nations accepted the Kansas Line. In March 1953 the death of Joseph Stalin helped spur negotiations. While Chinese leader Mao Zedong was not willing to compromise then, the new Soviet leadership issued a statement two weeks after Stalin's death, calling for a quick end to hostilities. The building where the armistice was signed, now housing the North Korea Peace Museum On 19 July 1953 delegates reached agreement covering all issues on the agenda. On 27 July 1953 at 10:00 a.m., the Armistice was signed by Nam Il, delegate of the KPA and PVA, and William K. Harrison Jr., UNC delegate. Twelve hours after the signing of the document, all regulations approved in the armistice commenced. The agreement provided for monitoring by an international commission. The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC) was established to prevent reinforcements being brought into Korea, either additional military personnel or new weapons, and NNSC member inspection teams from Czechoslovakia, Poland, Sweden and Switzerland operated throughout Korea. Effects Demilitarized Zone compared to the earlier 38th parallel de facto border The signed Armistice established a \\"complete cessation of all hostilities in Korea by all armed force\\" that was to be enforced by the commanders of both sides. The armistice is however only a cease-fire between military forces, rather than an agreement between governments to normalize relations. No formal peace treaty was signed and normalized relations were not restored. The armistice established the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) and the DMZ. The DMZ was agreed as a fortified buffer zone between the two Korean nations. The DMZ follows the Kansas Line where the two sides actually confronted each other at the time of the signing of the Armistice. The DMZ is currently the most heavily defended national border in the world . The Armistice also established regulations regarding prisoners of war. The agreement stated that: Ultimately, more than 22,000 KPA or PVA soldiers refused repatriation. On the opposite side, 327 South Korean soldiers, 21 American soldiers and 1 British soldier also refused repatriation, and remained in North Korea or in China. (See: List of American and British defectors in the Korean War.) With the signing of the Armistice, the war ended. Despite the three-year war, the international border remained at a similar location as at its start. Subsequent events =Failure of the Geneva Conference= Article IV (Paragraph 60) of the Armistice Agreement calls for a political conference to be held within 3 months of the signing of the agreement in order \\"to ensure the peaceful settlement of the Korean question\\". A conference was held in Geneva, Switzerland in April 1954, missing the 3 month timeline by 6 months. The conference focused on two separate conflicts: the conflict in Korea; and the conflict in Indochina. Participants in the talks on the conflict in Korea were the US, the USSR, France, China, and North and South Korea. The peace agreement on the Korean peninsula was officially raised at the conference, by Chinese diplomat Zhou Enlai with the US Secretary of Defense, John Foster Dulles, but no progress was made. The United States intentionally avoided discussing the \\"Peace Treaty on the Korean Peninsula\\", in spite of criticism from the other representatives at the conference about the negative attitude of the United States. =United States abrogation of paragraph 13(d)= Deployment of U.S. atomic weapons in Korea in 1958 Paragraph 13(d) of the Armistice Agreement mandated that neither side introduce new weapons into Korea, other than piece-for-piece replacement of equipment. In September 1956 the U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Radford indicated that the U.S. military intention was to introduce atomic weapons into Korea, which was agreed to by the U.S. National Security Council and President Eisenhower. The U.S. unilaterally abrogated paragraph 13(d), breaking the Armistice Agreement, despite concerns by United Nations allies. At a meeting of the Military Armistice Commission on 21 June 1957, the U.S. informed the North Korean representatives that the United Nations Command no longer considered itself bound by paragraph 13(d) of the armistice. In January 1958 nuclear armed Honest John missiles and 280mm atomic cannons were deployed to South Korea, followed within a year by atomic demolition munitions and nuclear armed Matador cruise missiles with the range to reach China and the Soviet Union. North Korea believed the U.S. had introduced new weapons earlier, citing NNSC inspection team reports for August 1953 to April 1954. The U.S. believed that North Korea had introduced new weapons contrary to 13(d), but did not make specific allegations. Following the abrogation of paragraph 13(d), the NNSC largely lost its function, and became primarily office based in the DMZ with a small staff. North Korea denounced the abrogation of paragraph 13(d). North Korea responded militarily by digging massive underground fortifications resistant to nuclear attack, and by the forward deployment of its conventional forces so that the use of nuclear weapons against it would endanger South Korean and U.S. forces as well. In 1963 North Korea asked the Soviet Union and China for help in developing nuclear weapons, but was refused. =United Nations statements= In 1975, the U.N. General Assembly adopted resolutions endorsing the desirability of replacing the Armistice Agreement with a peace treaty and dissolving the UNC. This was followed by North Korean attempts to start peace discussions with the U.S. The U.S. however believed influencing China to restrict North Korean actions would be more effective. In October 1996, the U.N. Security Council, by a statement of the President of the Security Council, Honduras, urged that the Armistice Agreement should be fully observed until replaced by a new peace mechanism. Approving nations included the United States and the People's Republic of China, two of the armistice's signatories, effectively refuting any suggestion that the armistice was no longer in force. =North Korean announcements to withdraw from the agreement= a 1989 student festival in Pyongyang, prior to calls from North Korea to leave the agreement. North Korea has announced that it will no longer abide by the armistice at least six times, in 1994, 1996, 2003, 2006, 2009, and 2013. On 28 April 1994, North Korea announced that it would cease participating in the Military Armistice Commission, but would continue contact at Panmunjom through liaison officers and maintain the general conditions of the armistice. North Korea stated it regarded the U.S. deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea as terminating the armistice. On 3 September 1994 China joined North Korea in withdrawing from and ceasing participation in the Military Armistice Commission. In January 2002 U.S. President George W. Bush, in his first State of the Union Address, labeled North Korea a part of an Axis of Evil. In October 2006 North Korea conducted its first nuclear weapons test. There were two isolated violent incidents in 2010: the ROKS Cheonan sinking, which was attributed to North Korea, despite denials; and the North Korean Bombardment of Yeonpyeong. In 2010, the U.S. position regarding a peace treaty was that it could only be negotiated when North Korea \\"takes irreversible steps toward denuclearization\\". In 2011, South Korea stated that North Korea had violated the armistice 221 times. In 2013 North Korea argued that the Armistice was meant to be a transitional measure and that North Korea had made a number of proposals for replacing the armistice with a peace treaty, but the U.S. had not responded in a serious way. It further argued that the Military Armistice Commission and the NNSC had long been effectively dismantled, paralysing the supervisory functions of the Armistice. North Korea believes the annual U.S. and South Korean exercises Key Resolve and Foal Eagle are provocative and threaten North Korea with nuclear weapons. JoongAng Ilbo reported that U.S. vessels equipped with nuclear weapons were participating in the exercise, and the Pentagon publicly announced that B-52 bombers flown over South Korea were reaffirming the U.S. \\"nuclear umbrella\\" for South Korea. In March 2013, North Korea announced that it was scrapping all non-aggression pacts with South Korea. It also closed the border and closed the direct phone line between the two Koreas. North Korea further stated it had the right to make a preemptive nuclear attack. A United Nations spokesman stated that the Armistice Agreement had been adopted by the U.N. General Assembly, and could not be unilaterally dissolved by either North Korea or South Korea. On 28 March 2013, the U.S. sent two B-2 Spirit stealth bombers to South Korea to participate in ongoing military exercises in the region, including the dropping of inert munitions on a South Korean bomb range. This was the first B-2 non-stop, round-trip mission to Korea from the United States. Following this mission, North Korean state media announced that it was readying rockets to be on standby to attack U.S. targets.North Korea readying rockets to aim at U.S. targets, state media says . CNN. Retrieved 12 July 2013. In May 2013, North Korea offered to enter into negotiations for a peace treaty to replace the armistice agreement. In August 2016, North Korea installed anti-personnel mines to prevent the defection of its front-line border guards around the \\"Bridge of No Return,\\" situated in the Joint Security Area (JSA). The UN Command protested this move as it violates the Armistice Agreement which specifically prohibits armed guards and anti- personnel mines. In 2016, when North Korea proposed formal peace talks, the U.S. adjusted its position from the pre-condition that North Korea should have already taken \\"irreversible steps toward denuclearization\\", to a negotiating stance that includes North Korea halting its nuclear program. The discussions did not take place. A State Department spokesman said that \\"[North Korea] periodically raise[s] the idea and it never really gets far\\". =Panmunjom Declaration= On 27 April 2018 the Panmunjom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity and Unification on the Korean Peninsula was signed by South Korean President Moon Jae-in and the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un which commits the two countries to denuclearization and talks to bring a formal end to conflict. The two leaders agreed to, later in the year, convert the Korean Armistice Agreement into a full peace treaty, formally ending the Korean War after 65 years. The DPRK later called off talks with South Korea scheduled for 16 May, blaming U.S.-South Korean military exercises, and threw the planned 12 June summit into doubt, saying it might not attend if Washington continues to demand it unilaterally abandon its nuclear arsenal. The 2018 North Korea–United States Summit was held in Singapore on 12 June 2018 at Capella Hotel despite previous tensions before the summit. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and United States President Donald Trump signed a joint declaration that declared the following: # The United States and the DPRK commit to establish new U.S.-DPRK relations in accordance with the desire of the peoples of the two countries for peace and prosperity. # The United States and the DPRK will join their efforts to build a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula. # Reaffirming the April 27, 2018 Panmunjom Declaration, the DPRK commits to work towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. # The United States and the DPRK commit to recovering POW/MIA remains including the immediate repatriation of those already identified. The joint statement also includes Trump's commitment to providing security guarantees to North Korea and that there will be follow-up negotiations between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and an undetermined high-level North Korean official thereafter. At the start of a three-day summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in in Pyongyang, the pair's third meeting of 2018, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un stated that his meeting with Trump \\"provided geopolitical stability and that he expects more progress in talks between his nation and Washington.\\" Kim also credited Moon with making the “historic” U.S.-DPRK summit in Singapore possible.kim-trump-singapore-summit- stability-827908 The third day of the Moon-Kim summit yielded a joint statement from the two leaders announcing an agreement to pursue a co-host bid for the 2032 Olympic Games. Further, the joint statement announced that the two nations will now \\"participate jointly\\" at international competitions, including the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. Commemorations Over the years, United States Presidents have made proclamations in support of the National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day.

After having moved the launch training facility named \\"Heimat- Artillerie-Park 11 Karlshagen/Pomerania\\" from Köslin near Peenemünde, the Training and Testing Battery 444 () conducted \\"live warhead trials\\" from the Heidelager military area near Blizna, Poland, into the target area at the Pripet Marshes to the northeast. With the advances by the Russian armies, the Blizna testing was evacuated on September 8, 1944 to the Heidekraut testing- ground in the Tuchola Forest in Polish Pomerania. In mid-January 1945, testing moved to the forests to the south of Wolgast, and then to the area of Rethun on the Weser river west of Hannover though no launches were conducted from either location. Plans for production facilities at Demag-Fahrzeugwerke in Berlin-Falkensee, Raxwerke, and the Zeppelin Works in Friedrichshafen were never completed. The initial production plant at Peenemünde and the plant's forced laborers were transferred to the Mittelwerk underground plant and nearby Dora camp of KZ Dachau to produce the operational V-2 rockets. Near the Mittelwerk was a servomotor production facility in a salt mine and a quality control facility at Ilfeld. After the Operation Hydra bombing of the Peenemünde Army Research Center, the supersonic wind tunnel was moved to Kochel and engine testing and calibration was moved to Lehesten. Near the end of World War II in Europe, Peenemünde scientists were evacuated to the Alpine Fortress () A research and test facility planned since early 1944 in the Austrian Alps (under the codename Salamander) were never implemented; the target areas would have been in the Tatra Mountains, the Arlberg range, and the area of the Ortler mountain. V-2 rocket documents and drawings were hidden in a mine at Dörnten (14 tons from Peenemünde) and buried at Bad Sachsa (260 lbs from Walter Dornberger's headquarters at Schwedt-an-der-Oder). Launch and support facilities A World War II map shows the two areas where the Germans were setting up their secret \\"V\\" weapons to bombard England (right, center). These are the areas in which the Royal Air Force and 8th Air Force heavy bombers concentrated their bombs in order to knock out the weapons -- part of the pre-invasion plan. This event was given the operational code name Crossbow during World War II. Initial plans for large launch bunkers at Watten and Wizernes with a radar station at Prédefin were abandoned due to the Allied bombing targeted against them. Additional plans for small launch bunkers such as at Thiennes on the edge of the Foret de la Nieppe, at Rauville, and at Colombières near Trévières; as well as for exposed concrete pads (39 north of the Somme and 6 in Western Normandy) were switched to use firings from mobile launch platforms instead. Mobile launching sites included the Haagse Bos and the Duindigt Racecourse at The Hague. Eight main storage dumps were planned and four had been completed by July 1944. These were all captured before being used. The storage depot at Mery-sur-Oise was bombed on August 2, 1944. Work had been started in August 1943 and completed by February 1944; and the depots (including those at Bergueneuse and Villiers-Adam) included \\"service buildings for testing V2 sub-assemblies in the vertical position\\". Testing of production motors at the Southern Works was originally conducted in late 1943 at Oberraderach near Friedrichshafen, but was shut down shortly after going into operation because firings were visible from Switzerland across Lake Constance. Raxwerke motor testing equipment was eventually moved to the Redl-Zipf facility in central Austria, which used forced labor of the Schlier-Redl-Zipf subcamp of the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp. Liquid oxygen was produced at the motor testing facilities at Oberraderach (900 tons/month), in the Redl- Zipf (2,100 tons/month) tunnel (for testing the Linke-Hofmann combustion chambers), and at Lehesten near Nordhausen—two additional underground plants for 6,000 tons/month at Wittringen in the Saar (captured December 7, 1944) and near the Mittelwerk were never completed. In Belgium, an underground plant at Liège (900 tons/month) supplied launches in the Netherlands, and plants at La Louviere, Torte, and Willebroeck were also targets of allied bombing. 1943: August September October November December 1944: January , March , August , September , October , November , December 1945: January , February , March V-2 suppliers The materials and parts for the V-2 were drawn from several suppliers. *Berlin-Lichtenberg plant of Siemens Planiawerke (blanks for exhaust steering vanes) *Meitingen plant of Siemans Planiawerke, near Augsberg (vane graphitizing & machining). *Voss Works at Sarstedt (nose cone) *Linke-Hoffman-Busch-Werke AG in Breslau (combustion chambers) *Weimar near the Buchenwald camp (electrical parts) *WUMAG Abt.

He served on active duty during the American Indian Wars, Spanish–American War, Philippine–American War, occupation of Cuba, and World War I. Military career Muir received an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York in 1881, graduating eighth in his class in 1885. After receiving his commission as a second lieutenant in the United States Army, Muir was sent to Dakota Territory and later to Fort D.A. Russell in Wyoming. He held first place on the Army Rifle Team in 1890. In 1895, Muir graduated at the head of his class from the Infantry and Cavalry School in Fort Leavenworth in Kansas. Muir was deployed to Cuba during the Spanish–American War, where he received the Distinguished Service Cross for gallantry in action during the Battle of Santiago de Cuba. On July 2, 1898, he had voluntarily exposed himself to heavy enemy artillery and infantry fire in an action which resulted in the silencing of a piece of Spanish artillery. Muir was promoted to Captain on 2 March 1899. Later that year he was promoted to Major and sent to the Philippines. Muir was assigned to a unit under the command of Brigadier general Robert Henry Hall. On 19 January 1900, Muir and ten other American soldiers attacked the headquarters of General Miguel Malvar at Rosario in Batangas province, driving Malvar and his men out. Muir's unit took possession of 25,000 Mexican pesos from Malvar's treasury and released 300 Spanish prisoners. From 1903 to 1907, he was a member of the general staff at Washington, D.C.. Major General Muir succeeded Charles M. Clement as Commander of the 28th Infantry Division from 15 December 1917 until 23 October 1918, when he was succeeded by William H. May. Muir commanded IV Corps until April, 1919 when he succeeded Hay as commander of the 28th Division and led it to the United States for its post-war demobilization. He was succeeded by William G. Price Jr. when the division was reorganized as part of the Pennsylvania National Guard. From July 1919 to August 1920, MG Muir served as Commandant of the United States Army Command and General Staff College. His final duty assignment was at the War Department in Washington, D.C., after which he retired from the Army.

He was a close friend of John Henry Newman, who described their relationship in his Apologia. Life He was born in London, the eldest son of John Bowden, of Fulham and Grosvenor Place. In 1812 he went to Harrow School, and in 1817 entered as a commoner at Trinity College, Oxford, simultaneously with his close friend John Henry Newman. In 1830 Bowden obtained mathematical honours, and on 24 November took his degree of B.A. In collaboration with Newman, in the following year, he wrote a polemical poem in two cantos, St. Bartholomew's Eve On 4 June 1823 Bowden took his degree of M.A. In the autumn of 1826 he was appointed a commissioner of stamps, holding the position for fourteen years, resigning it on account of ill-health in 1840. From 1833 he keenly took part in the Tractarian movement. In the spring of 1839 Bowden was first attacked by tuberculosis, which proved fatal. In the autumn of 1839 he went abroad with his family. The winter of that year he died in Malta. During the summer of 1843 Bowden's complaint returned with increased severity, and he died at his father's house in Grosvenor Place. Cardinal Newman attests emphatically that he died 'In undoubting communion with the church of Andrewes and Laud,' adding, with reference to his interment at Fulham, 'he still lives here, the light and comfort of many hearts, who ask no happier, holier end than his.' Works To Hugh James Rose's British Magazine he contributed six of the 178 hymns that in 1836 were collected as Lyra Apostolica. His contributions are signed α. Newman and Bowden worked together on the Tracts for the Times. For the British Critic Bowden supplied four major contributions. These were: July 1836, Rise of the Papal Power; April 1837, On Gothic Architecture; January 1839, On British Association; July 1841, On the Church in the Mediterranean. The last two were published under Newman's editorship. In the spring of 1840 he published his Life of Gregory the Seventh. This work had been first suggested to him by Newman, prompted by Hurrell Froude. He proposed to write, but never produced, a Life of St. Boniface, which in 1843 was announced as in preparation. Bowden's only publication in 1843 was A few Remarks on Pews. A posthumous publication in 1845 was Thoughts on the Work of the Six Days of Creation. The key to his argument was the motto on the title-page, Novum Testamentum in Veteri velabatur, Vetus Testamentum in Novo revelatur. Family He married, on 6 June 1828, Elizabeth, youngest daughter of Sir John Edward Swinburne. They had two children, Charles Henry Bowden (1836–1906), a priest of the Birmingham Oratory, and Emily Frances Bowden (1833–1909), translator of Ida, Countess von Hahn-Hahn's Fathers of the Desert. Elizabeth was a Catholic convert, and founder of a Catholic church in Fulham.

History Established by the BBC in 1940 as the Scottish Variety Orchestra, the orchestra was originally a freelance ensemble under the direction of arranger and conductor Ronnie Munro and based at the BBC Studios in Glasgow. It shared studio space with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra. This new orchestra had an instrumentation comprising a small brass section, woodwinds, four saxophones, strings and a basic rhythm section including accordion. Having a small saxophone section, it was effectively a showband, and this line up which would enable it to play both light and dance music. One of its functions being to accompany the variety shows which were produced in Scotland for the BBC National Programme and the Scottish Home Service. Initially it had regular appearances in 'Music While You Work' and in the long-running series 'Sunday Serenade'. At the end of the war the orchestra was made a regular salaried, staff orchestra and its title was amended to BBC Scottish Variety Orchestra, now under the direction of Kemlo Stephen. Under Stephen, and subsequent conductor Jack Leon, the dance band element of the orchestra was toned down, and the emphasis was changed to straight light music, though the orchestra still accompanied popular singers and played programmes of Scottish Dance music which continued to be important part of its repertoire. The orchestra's accordionist Archie Duncan was featured prominently in these arrangements. By this time the orchestra participated in a wide range of programmes for the Scottish Home Service and the Light Programme - \\"Bright and Early\\", \\"Morning Music\\", \\"Melody on the Move\\", \\"Lunch Date\\" and \\"Music On the Move\\" in which they played programmes of Scottish Dance Music. Kemlo Stephen and Jack Leon were succeeded in 1966 by conductor Iain Sutherland. The orchestra gave a weekly Tuesday morning broadcast in 'Music While You Work', as well as playing in all the other regular light music slots. It also played for television, accompanying singers such as Moira Anderson. The London-based BBC Variety and BBC Revue Orchestras were merged in 1965 to form the BBC Radio Orchestra, so at Sutherland's suggestion the Scottish Variety Orchestra was renamed the BBC Scottish Radio Orchestra in January 1967. = The B1, B2 and C1 Orchestras= In 1972, as part of a revamp of the light orchestras, the BBC changed the structure of the orchestra, to match its London counterpart, the BBC Radio Orchestra, a large studio orchestra of around 65 players which included a full Big Band and symphonic sized wind and strings. This was a grouping that could be used in its entirety or broken down into a series of flexible ensembles prefixed A-E. The New Scottish Radio Orchestra's instrumentation, classified B1, B2 and C1 to match its London counterparts, had a full complement of 32, and was a big band with strings in the Billy May/Nelson Riddle style. The full ensemble was classified as the B1 Orchestra, comprising 5 saxes, flute, 4 trumpets, 4 trombones, piano, guitar, bass, drums, percussion, 10 violins, 2 violas and 2 cellos. All the players in the sax section played one or more other instruments including flutes, piccolo, clarinets and different varieties of saxophones, and the pianist also played celeste and electric organ. For special live broadcasts and projects, the full SRO was occasionally augmented with players from the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra. The B2 Orchestra featured the string and rhythm sections of the SRO. The C1 Orchestra's 16 players formed the same big band as that which was the basis of the B1, and was sometimes known as the Radio Scotland Big Band. It shared many arrangements with its London based colleagues the BBC Big Band, and many of the BBC SRO's broadcasts featured just the C1 big band section. With this change in format, the orchestra now played a great deal of jazz and swing as well as light music and accompanying popular singers. Under the direction of composer and arranger Brian Fahey, the BBC Scottish Radio Orchestra also did a lot of television work accompanying the likes of Kenneth McKellar, Lena Martell, Moira Anderson, Shirley Bassey, Lulu, Lena Zavaroni and Anne Lorne Gilles. It also had its own BBC One programme, Make Way for Music. They recorded 'inserts' for the many music and chat shows on Radio 2 and Radio Scotland, recording with artists including Cleo Laine, Georgie Fame, Carol Kidd and trombonist Don Lusher. =Closure= With the ever-increasing air- time being given to commercial pop music, there was less time available for staff studio orchestras, the costs of which were becoming disproportionate to their use. In 1980 the BBC announced its intention to disband several of its staff light orchestras including the Northern Radio Orchestra, and Midland Radio Orchestra, as well as the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra. However the Scottish Radio Orchestra was not one of the orchestras under threat. Strike action followed which seriously disrupted the Proms, and incensed musicians took every opportunity to state their cause. The compromise that ended the strike saved the Scottish Symphony Orchestra at the expense of the Scottish Radio Orchestra, which had previously not been considered for disbandment. The irony was that whilst the SRO had fought to save its classical counterparts, when the situation was reversed the Scottish Radio Orchestra was axed without much of a fight. Part of the compromise included a guarantee that the BBC would give all the musicians in the SRO an agreed number of engagements per year, for the next five years. As a unit, the BBC Scottish Radio Orchestra was officially disbanded early in 1981, one of their final performances being at the Playhouse Theatre in Edinburgh with Ella Fitzgerald. They continued to perform for the BBC as a group under freelance contracts until 1986.

Hamilton: A People's History (2001). James Lorimer & Co. Publishing, Toronto This marked Canada's first national attempt at a labour movement, pushing for the nine-hour work day which united both unionized and non-unionized workers alike. The movement came to its height in May 1872 when a collective force of 1,500 workers demonstrated in Hamilton in a parade-style fashion, which is coined as being the precursor to the traditional holiday of Canada's Labour Day. The movement was an overall failure, as it failed to deliver the nine-hour work day to most workforces and industries, but made a major mark in labour relations in Canada. Despite its defeat, the movement created a unified protest and fueled workers to fight to secure rights through legal measures of labour law. The movement indicated that labour had a public presence and that its interests, institutions, and political stances reflected its unique social position and economic needs. A major victory was gained when Sir John A. Macdonald passed the Trade Unions Act on June 14, 1872, which gave workers the right to associate in trade unions. In addition, other minor victories were achieved in repealing repressive labour legislation and the passage of laws that strengthened the workers' hand against employers. The Nine-Hour Movement is also a major factor that propelled the development of the Canadian Labour Union.Palmer, B., \\"Nine-Hour Movement\\". The Canadian Encyclopedia Three prominent reasons for the failure of the Nine-Hour Movement were employer hostility and resistance, the waning prosperity of various industries, and significant divisions in the labour force (ex. race/gender differences).

The steel boom led to an influx of immigrants to the area looking for work, as well as construction of skyscrapers in the area. The city's population peaked at 170,002 in 1930, just at the onset of the Great Depression. World War II also brought a great demand for steel. After World War II, demand for steel dropped off dramatically, and industrial base of Youngstown began to see a decline. Youngstown's economy has been impacted by a loss of the steel industry jobs which started on September 19, 1977, on what became known to locals as \\"Black Monday\\", and continued into the mid-1980s. While the loss of steel industry jobs in the region coincided with the general deindustrialization of Rust Belt cities such as Youngstown as well as the United States as a whole, Youngstown's economic struggles have been well documented. In the Mahoning Valley region, where Youngstown is located, the city's population was halved, while non-industrial businesses were forced to close or relocate due to cascading effects resulting from Youngstown's deindustrialization. Steel boom Founded by John Young in 1797 in the Connecticut Western Reserve section of the Northwest Territory, Youngstown spent the first half of the 19th century as a small village, dependent on mostly agricultural needs, until the beginning of the Second Industrial Revolution. The discovery of iron ore along the Mahoning River, however, would make the city a viable and logical place to manufacture steel. The city sits roughly in between Cleveland and Pittsburgh—steel manufacturers in their own right—and halfway between New York City and Chicago. Youngstown Sheet and Tube and Republic Steel were among the region's largest locally owned steel companies, while U.S. Steel also had major operations in the region. Molten iron is blown in an Eastern Bessemer converter at Republic Steel, Youngstown, November 1941 Endowed with large deposits of coal and iron as well as \\"old growth\\" hardwood forests needed to produce charcoal, the Youngstown area eventually developed a thriving steel industry. The area's first blast furnace was established to the east of town in 1803 by James and Daniel Heaton.Blue et al. (1995), p. 20. In time, the availability of fossil fuels contributed to the development of other coal-fired mills, including the Youngstown Rolling Mill Company, which was established in 1846.Blue et al. (1995), p. 42. By the mid-19th century, Youngstown was the site of several iron industrial plants, notably David Tod's Brier Hill Iron & Coal Company.Blue et al. (1995), p. 37. The iron industry continued to expand in the 1890s, despite the depletion of local natural resources. Numerous rail connections ensured a consistent supply of coal and iron ore from neighboring states.Blue et al. (1995), pp. 66–67. At the turn of the 20th century, local industrialists began to convert to steel manufacturing, amid a wave of industrial consolidations that placed much of the Mahoning Valley's industry in the hands of national corporations.Blue et al. (1995), p. 94. Shortly after the establishment of U.S. Steel in 1901, the corporate entity absorbed Youngstown's premier steel producer, the National Steel Company. One year earlier, a group of city investors had taken steps to ensure high levels of local ownership in the area's industrial sector. Led by local industrialists George D. Wick and James A. Campbell, they organized what became the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company, among the nation's most important regional steel producers. The firm significantly expanded its operations in 1923, when it acquired plants in South Chicago and East Chicago, Indiana. This impulse to support local ownership surfaced again in 1931, when Campbell, as chairman of the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company, attempted to merge the firm with Bethlehem Steel, in a bid to create the nation's second-largest steel corporation. Other area industrialists blocked the move, with the financial backing of Republic Steel founder Cyrus S. Eaton, who feared the implications of a strengthened Bethlehem Steel.Fuechtmann (1989), p. 14. In the late 1930s, the community's steel sector gained national attention once again, when Youngstown became a site of the so-called \\"Little Steel Strike\\", an effort by the Steel Workers Organizing Committee, a precursor to United Steelworkers, to secure contract agreements with smaller steel companies. These firms included Republic Steel, Bethlehem Steel, Youngstown Sheet and Tube, National Steel, Inland Steel, and American Rolling Mills. Gus Hall, one of the committee's founding organizers, led strikes in Youngstown and Warren. On June 21, 1937, strike-related violence in Youngstown resulted in two deaths and 42 injuries. Despite violent episodes in Youngstown and Chicago, the Little Steel Strike proved to be a turning point in the history of the U.S. labor movement. Historian William Lawson observed that the strike transformed industrial unions from \\"basically local and ineffective organizations into all- encompassing, nationwide collective bargaining representatives of American workers\\". In 1969, Youngstown Sheet and Tube merged with the New Orleans-based Lykes Corporation, and in 1979 the combined Lykes-Youngstown was bought by the conglomerate LTV.Williams, Robert Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company-Lykes Corporation Merger Letter, Libert-Youngstown Sheet & Tube Company-Lykes Collection, September 4, 1969 This brought decisions to the local economy out of the hands of the Youngstown area for the first time, although Republic Steel had moved to nearby Cleveland years earlier. LTV had discovered that the numerous mills in the area had not been upgraded in decades, and would not meet pollution regulations set forth by the United States government without an expensive upgrade. In addition, many steel manufacturers were outsourcing steel to developing nations, where the costs would be cheaper and with fewer pollution regulations. Black Monday An abandoned facility of the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company, owner of the Jeanette Blast Furnace. The Furnace is called \\"Jenny\\" in the 1995 Bruce Springsteen song \\"Youngstown\\", which is about the decline of Youngstown as an industrial city. Between the 1920s and 1960s, the city was known as an important industrial hub that featured the massive furnaces and foundries of such companies as Republic Steel and U.S. Steel. At the same time, Youngstown never became economically diversified, as did larger industrial cities such as Chicago, Pittsburgh, Akron, or Cleveland. Though population levels remained flat for a few more decades, population had not grown since the Great Depression, though General Motors had opened Lordstown Assembly in 1966 to help offset some losses.Fuechtmann (1989), p. 16. Hence, when economic changes forced the closure of plants throughout the 1970s, the city was left with few substantial economic alternatives. The 1969 corporate merger between the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company and the New Orleans-based Lykes Corporation proved to be a turning point in the demise of the local steel industry.Fuechtmann (1989), pp. 41–43. The merger and subsequent takeover of Youngstown Sheet and Tube burdened the community's primary steel producer with hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. Further, the deal placed control of the company outside of the Mahoning Valley. On September 19, 1977, it was announced a large portion of Youngstown Sheet and Tube would be closing. Although federal laws now require employers to give 60 days notice to its employees if they plan on doing mass layoffs, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act was still eleven years from going into effect at the time, and Youngstown Sheet and Tube instantly put 5,000 workers out of work. The day is still known locally as \\"Black Monday\\". Youngstown Sheet and Tube's announcement had a ripple effect in the area. In 1979–1980, U.S. Steel pulled out of the Youngstown area and started scaling back its operations in Pittsburgh before eventually merging with Marathon Oil and filing with bankruptcy. In the mid-1980s, Republic Steel also filed for bankruptcy.Bruno (1999), pp. 9–10. Attempts to revive the local steel industry proved unsuccessful. Shortly after the closure of most of Youngstown Sheet and Tube's area operations, local religious leaders, steelworkers, and activists such as Staughton Lynd participated in a grassroots effort to purchase and refurbish one of the company's abandoned plants in neighboring Campbell, Ohio.Fuechtmann (1989), p. 5. This project met with failure in April 1979. Youngstown State University professors Terry Buss and F. Stevens Redburn have concluded that the mill closings resulted from forces beyond the control of the community. Youngstown was simply just one piece of a national problem, and the area could not solve this problem alone. In 1982, Staughton Lynd wrote about the effects of the mill closings in Youngstown in the book, The Fight Against Black Monday. In the wake of the steel plant shutdowns, the community lost an estimated 40,000 manufacturing jobs, 400 satellite businesses, $414 million in personal income, and from 33 to 75 percent of the school tax revenues.Bruno (1999), p. 149. The Youngstown area has yet to fully recover from the loss of jobs in the steel sector.Linkon and Russo (2002), pp. 131–132. The move had an effect on non- industrial businesses as well. Fast food chain Arby's, which at the time was beginning to make a national push, moved its corporate headquarters out of the Youngstown area. Idora Park, an amusement park in the area, suffered several fires before closing its doors in 1984. The Strouss department store would be consolidated into Kaufmann's by its parent company, May Department Stores, before its own consolidation into Macy's. The city made attempts to attract another steel manufacturer, and even re-open Youngstown Sheet and Tube as a community-owned steel mill, but all these attempts failed. After Black Monday The loss of industrial jobs has had a lasting impact in the Mahoning Valley region of Youngstown, as the city's population was cut in half as a result,Christie, Les (April 24, 2008). \\"The Incredible Shrinking City\\". money.cnn.com. Retrieved 2010-12-16. while non-industrial businesses were forced to close or relocate due to the ripple effect of the loss of the steel industry. Although some other Rust Belt cities such as Pittsburgh have since successfully been able to diversify their economic base, as of December 2010, more than a generation after deindustrialization, Youngstown has not recovered.Steven High  Capital and Community Reconsidered: The Politics and Meaning of Deindustrialization  Labour/Le Travail, 55.

Retrieved on 2010-12-23. =Alternate enterprises= Downtown Youngstown at night A number of products and enterprises other than steel introduced in Youngstown during the manufacturing era became national household names. Among these is Youngstown-based Schwebel's Bakery, which was established in neighboring Campbell in the 20th century. The company now distributes bread products nationally. In the 1920s, Youngstown was the birthplace of the Good Humor brand of ice cream novelties, and the popular franchise of Handel's Homemade Ice Cream & Yogurt was established there in the 1940s. In the 1950s, the suburb of Boardman became the site of one of the country's first modern shopping plazas, which was established by Youngstown-born developer Edward J. DeBartolo, Sr.Blue et al. (1995), p. 176 The fast-food chain, Arby's, opened the first of its restaurants in Boardman in 1964, and Arthur Treacher's Fish & Chips was headquartered in Youngstown in the late 1970s. More recently, the city's downtown hosted the corporate headquarters of the now-defunct pharmacy chain store Phar-Mor, which was established by Youngstown native Mickey Monus. The blow dealt to the community's industrial economy in the 1970s had been slightly mitigated by the presence of auto production plants in the metropolitan area. In the late 1980s, the Avanti, an automobile with a fiberglass body originally designed by Studebaker to compete with the Corvette, was manufactured in an industrial complex on Youngstown's Albert Street. This company moved away after just a few years. A mainstay, though, of Youngstown's industrial economy has long been the GM Lordstown plant. The General Motors' Lordstown Assembly plant is the largest industrial employer in the area. One of the nation's largest auto plants in terms of square feet, the Lordstown facility was home to production of the Chevrolet Impala, Vega, and Cavalier. It was expanded and retooled with a new paint facility and in the 2010s has been the Cavalier's successor, the Chevrolet Cruze.Lyne, Jack (2002). GM Doling Out $500M to Build New Model in North Ohio. Site Selection Online Insider. Retrieved 2007-03-08 The re-opened Federal Street Several times, General Motors has announced intentions to close Lordstown Assembly, especially after its 2009 bankruptcy. However, GM Lordstown remains open and is the area's largest industrial employer. Currently, Youngstown State University is the area's largest overall employer, a far cry from the city's industrial past. Even though the area was embarrassed by the collapse of the Phar-Mor chain, Entrepreneur named Youngstown one of the top 10 cities to start a business in 2009. Downtown Youngstown has seen modest levels of new construction. Recent additions include the George Voinovich Government Center and state and federal courthouses: the Seventh District Court of Appeals and the Nathaniel R. Jones Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse. The latter features an award-winning design by the architectural firm, Robert A. M. Stern Architects. Youngstown's downtown has experienced some business growth. The Youngstown Business Incubator is located downtown. This nonprofit organization, based in a former department store building, fosters the growth of fledgling technology-based companies. With more than a dozen business tenants, has recently completed construction on the Taft Technology Center, where some of its largest tenants will locate their offices. and houses several start-up technology companies, which have received office space, furnishings, and access to utilities. Some companies supported by the incubator have earned recognition, and a few are starting to outgrow their current space. One such company – Turning Technologies – was in 2007 rated by Inc. Magazine as the fastest-growing privately held software company in the United States and 18th fastest-growing privately held company overall. In an effort to retain companies downtown, the incubator secured approval to demolish a row of vacant buildings nearby to clear space for expansion. The project will be funded by a $2 million federal grant awarded in 2006. In 2005, Federal Street, a major downtown thoroughfare that was closed in order to create a pedestrian-oriented plaza, was reopened to through traffic. The downtown area has also seen the razing of structurally unsound buildings and the expansion or restoration of others. New construction has dovetailed with efforts to cultivate business growth. Reversing the trend, in 2010, Vallourec & Mannesman broke ground for a $620 million-dollar pipe mill north of its existing business V&M; Star. Production of steel pipes began in October 2012. Opened in 2012, the facility is in area and produces tube goods to service natural gas exploration in the Marcellus Formation and has been an employer for 350 people. =Remaining steel operations= Youngstown is the site of several steel and metalworking operations, though nothing on the scale seen during the \\"glory days\\" of the \\"Steel Valley\\". The largest employer in the city is Youngstown State University (YSU), an urban public campus that serves about 15,000 students, located just north of downtown. The largest industrial employers within the Youngstown city limits are Vallourec Star Steel Company (formerly North Star Steel), in the Brier Hill district, and Exal Corporation on Poland Avenue. The latter has recently expanded its operations. =Defunct retail and amusement sectors= Several of the city's recreational resources disappeared amid the economic hardships that began in the late 1970s. Among these was Idora Park, an amusement park that served as a convenient alternative for residents who preferred not to travel to larger parks in Northern Ohio and Western Pennsylvania.Knepper (1989), p. 432. (These included Conneaut Lake Park in Conneaut Lake, Pennsylvania, Geauga Lake in Aurora, Ohio, Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio, and Kennywood in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.) The park, which closed in 1984, held sentimental value for many local residents and enjoyed a degree of historical significance. Former Youngstown resident Jack L. Warner noted in his autobiography that the Warner brothers took their first step into the movie business when they screened a used copy of The Great Train Robbery at Idora Park and other local venues.Warner (1964), pp. 49–54. From the early 20th century to the mid-1970s, Youngstown was the retail center of the Mahoning Valley. There were two flagship department stores in the downtown area, including Strouss Hirshberg's (later absorbed by Kaufmann's, now part of Macy's) and McKelvey's (later Higbee's, now part of Dillard's). Specialty shops lined the main artery of West Federal Street, and the district had four upscale movie theaters, including the Palace Theater, the Warner Brothers' first Theater, the State Theater, and the Paramount Theater. These businesses were the first to close as a result of declining attendance in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. In the early 1970s, the appearance of two suburban malls (the Southern Park Mall, in Boardman, and the Eastwood Mall, in Niles) hastened the closure or relocation of many businesses that remained. The collapse of the community's steel industry at the end of the decade created additional challenges for downtown business owners,Bruno (1999), p. 10. and throughout the 1980s and 1990s, efforts to revive the former retail hub were unsuccessful.Linkon and Russo (2002), pp. 42–46.  \\"Youngstown 2010\\" project Dilapidated house in Youngstown, 2009 In the 2000s, residents and city planners became motivated to change the city's course, eventually producing the \\"Youngstown 2010\\" project. This project is also colloquially referred to as \\"The Greening of Youngstown\\" due to the large scale demolition of dilapidated structures in favor of green space and the expansion of public parks. > \\"The City of Youngstown is operating under a comprehensive plan that was > formulated over a four year period in the early 1950s. The plan was reviewed > and updated with two additional volumes in 1974. These plans were for a > different era that anticipated a population of between 200,000 and 250,000. > The Youngstown 2010 Plan is based on a new vision for the new reality that > accepts we are a smaller city that will stabilize at 80,000 people.\\" Major Vision Principles of Youngstown 2010 include: # Accepting that Youngstown is a smaller city. #: The dramatic collapse of the steel industry led to the loss of tens of thousands of jobs and a precipitous decline in population. Having lost more than half its population and almost its entire industrial base in the last 30 years, the city is now left with an oversized urban structure. (It has been described as a size 40 man wearing a size 60 suit.) There are too many abandoned properties and too many underutilized sites. Many difficult choices will have to be made as Youngstown recreates itself as a sustainable mid-sized city. A strategic program is required to rationalize and consolidate the urban infrastructure in a socially responsible and financially sustainable manner. # Defining Youngstown's role in the new regional economy. #: The steel industry no longer dominates Youngstown’s economy. Most people work in different industries today. The city must align itself with the present realities of the regional economy. This new positioning means support for a more diverse and vibrant economy founded on the current strengths within the city and region, such as the university, the health care sector, and the arts community. # Improving Youngstown's image and enhancing quality of life. #: Youngstown must become a healthier and better place to live and work. Over time people have grown accustomed to seeing rundown buildings and streets. Urban decay is a constant and demoralizing reminder of Youngstown’s decline. It is important that Youngstown begin to \\"fix its broken windows\\" and support initiatives to improve neighborhoods, the downtown, the river, and the education system. The city must also begin dealing with difficult issues such as public safety and racism. # A call to action #: The people of Youngstown are ready for change. The city already has a large number of local leaders who want to involve others and make a contribution. The citywide plan must ensure that the excitement and optimism fostered through the planning process is maintained and advanced. To that end, the city needs a practical, action-oriented plan and a process through which local leaders can continue to be empowered and the city’s successes constantly celebrated. Besides embracing downsizing and green space expansion, the plan focuses strongly on attracting more diverse businesses. This has resulted in the city gaining international recognition for addressing the negative consequences of deindustrialization, which are common across the world.Downsizing Detroit: Youngstown 2010 may foreshadow Detroit circa 2020.

The flight was carrying most of the Zambian national football team to a FIFA World Cup Qualifier against Senegal in Dakar. All 25 passengers and five crew members were killed. The official investigation concluded that the pilot had shut down the wrong engine following an engine fire. It also found that pilot fatigue and a faulty instrument had contributed to the accident. Accident The flight had been specially arranged by the Zambian Air Force for the football team. The journey was scheduled to make three refuelling stops; the first at Brazzaville, Congo, the second at Libreville, Gabon, and the third at Abidjan, Ivory Coast. Flight route At the first stop in Brazzaville engine problems were noted. Despite this, the flight continued and a few minutes after taking off from the second stop in Libreville the left engine caught fire and failed. The pilot, who had also flown the team from a match in Mauritius the previous day, then shut down the right engine, causing the plane to lose all power during the climb out of Libreville Airport and fall into the water offshore. A Gabonese report released in 2003 attributed the pilot's actions to a faulty warning light and fatigue. Aircraft The aircraft entered service in 1975. The plane had been out of service for five months from late 1992 until 21 April 1993. Test flights were carried out on 22 and 26 April. Prior to the departure for Senegal, checks revealed a number of defects in the engine: carbon particles in oil filters, disconnected cables and trace of heating. However, the flight went ahead as scheduled. Passengers The Chipolopolo were a very promising Zambia national team. At the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul they thrashed Italy 4–0. They had their eyes on the 1993 Africa Cup of Nations trophy and a place at their first World Cup.Zambia's remarkable journey makes them winners regardless All 30 passengers and crew, including 18 players, as well as the national team coach and support staff, died in the accident. The Chipolopolo's captain, Kalusha Bwalya—later national team coach and president of the Football Association of Zambia (FAZ)—was not aboard the flight as he was in the Netherlands playing for PSV at that time and had made separate arrangements to make his own way to Senegal to take part in the match. Charles Musonda, at the time playing in Belgium for Anderlecht, was previously injured and thus was not on the flight. Bennett Mulwanda Simfukwe, who had been seconded to the FAZ by his employers (ZCCM) for 5 years and was supposed to be on this flight, wasn't on the flight because his employers demanded that he should immediately be removed from the list of those who were officially scheduled to travel to Senegal. Investigation A campaign to have the Gabonese crash investigation publicly released continued into the 2000s. In November 2003 a preliminary crash investigation report was released by the Gabonese government. Despite this relatives of the victims continue to lobby the Zambian government to produce a report on how the aircraft was allowed to leave Zambia. Aftermath Memorial at Heroes' Acre in Lusaka The members of the national team killed in the crash were buried in what became known as \\"Heroes' Acre\\", just outside the Independence Stadium in Lusaka. A new side was quickly assembled, and led by Bwalya, faced up to the difficult task of having to complete Zambia's World Cup qualifiers and then prepare for the upcoming African Nations Cup which was only months away. The resurrected team defied the odds, and displaying an attacking playing style, reached the final against Nigeria. They took the lead in the first half, but the Super Eagles quickly equalised and followed up with the winner in the second half. In spite of the loss, the Zambian side returned home as national heroes. In 2012, Zambia won the Africa Cup of Nations in Libreville, only a few hundred metres inland from the crash site; the victory was dedicated to the ones who lost their lives in the tragedy. Zambia beat Côte d'Ivoire 8–7 in a penalty shoot out after the game ended 0–0 after normal and added time. The accident was the subject of the 2014 Spanish/Zambian documentary film Eighteam, directed by Juan Rodriguez-Briso.

The TeachAids software has been cited as a model health intervention. Since the materials bypass issues of stigma, they allow HIV prevention education to be provided to communities where it has previously not been allowed. In other communities, the tutorials provide the highest learning effects and comfort rates of any tested educational approach. The TeachAids products are animated, interactive software tutorials, developed for individual cultures and languages, and incorporating the voices of celebrities from each region. In India, these include national icons such as Amitabh Bachchan, Shabana Azmi, Akkineni Nagarjuna and Sudeep Ssanjeev. In Botswana, they include musicians Scar, Zeus, and former President of Botswana, Festus Mogae. TeachAids operates globally, with its software in use in more than 80 countries. Its materials are made available for free under a Creative Commons License, funded by sponsorships, grants, and donations. Backers include Barclays, Cigna, Covington & Burling, Google, Microsoft, UNICEF, and Yahoo!. History Former President of Botswana, Festus Mogae (right), a TeachAIDS advisor, helped bring the tutorials to Botswana. TeachAIDS began in 2005 as a research project at Stanford University. From 2005 to 2009, a new interdisciplinary approach to HIV/AIDS education was developed through IRB- approved research by Piya Sorcar. Key advisors included professors Shelley Goldman (Learning Sciences), Martin Carnoy (Comparative Education), Cheryl Koopman (Psychiatry), Randall Stafford (Epidemiology), and Clifford Nass (Communication). The project's goal was to find a way to address the frequently taboo subjects associated with sexual issues and HIV/AIDS specifically. One major finding was that 2D cartoon figures were the optimal balance between comfort and clarity in terms of visual representation for sex- related topics. On that basis, animated storyboards were created which emphasized the biological aspects of HIV transmission and used cultural euphemisms to overcome social stigma. In addition, specific pedagogical techniques (e.g., instructional scaffolding) were utilized to create a coherent conception of HIV transmission for learners, as opposed to the fragmented knowledge created by mass media campaigns.Handbook of Research on Digital Media and Advertising. Matthew Eastin, Terry Daugherty, Neal Burns. Information Science Reference, July 31, 2010. . Chapter: Teaching Taboo Topics Through Technology. Early research versions of the software were sponsored by Time Warner, the Government of South Korea, and Neeru Khosla, and used custom illustrations drawn by Sorcar's father, award-winning animator Manick Sorcar. Pilot versions were subsequently created in English, Hindi, Kinyarwanda, Mandarin, and Spanish. Additional experts contributed to the design and evaluation of the materials, including Stanford professors David Katzenstein (Infectious Disease), Douglas Owens (Medicine), and Roy Pea (Learning Sciences). TeachAIDS was spun out of Stanford in 2009 as an independent 501(c)(3) organization, co-founded by Piya Sorcar, Clifford Nass, Shuman Ghosemajumder, and Ashwini Doshi. It began developing its infrastructure and new versions of its software for additional countries and languages around the world. The first additional versions of the software in Indian English, Telugu, and Tswana were launched in 2010. Celebrity partners TeachAIDS character of Amitabh Bachchan (left); Bachchan in 2013 TeachAIDS recording session (right) The TeachAIDS interactive software implements animated avatars of cultural icons to improve pedagogical efficacy. Over time, numerous international actors, musicians, and celebrities have lent their voices and likenesses to the TeachAIDS materials.

Worldwide use Actress Anushka Shetty in 2013 TeachAIDS recording session The TeachAIDS tutorials are available for free online and are used in more than 80 countries around the world, distributed by over 200 partner organizations. Numerous AIDS service organizations, AIDS education and training centers, NGOs, and government agencies distribute and utilize the tutorials as part of their own HIV/AIDS prevention efforts. Some of the organizations partnered with TeachAIDS include CARE, the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, and the U.S. Peace Corps. In India, the National AIDS Control Organisation approved the TeachAIDS materials in January, 2010, marking the first time HIV/AIDS education could be provided decoupled from sex education. Later that year, the Government of Karnataka approved the materials for their state of 50 million and committed to distributing them in 5,500 government schools. In Assam, Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi helped launched TeachAIDS. Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, and other Indian states have also joined with official support and distribution. Screenshot from the TeachAIDS software In Botswana, the TeachAIDS tutorials were adopted nationally as the standard method for HIV/AIDS education. In 2011, the Ministry of Education began distributing the tutorials to every primary, secondary, and tertiary educational institution in the country, reaching all learners from 6 to 24 years of age nationwide. June 15 in Botswana was declared \\"National TeachAIDS Day\\". In the United States, the Stanford Program on International and Cross- Cultural Education distributes the tutorials on CD along with a custom educator handbook, both of which are made available at no cost. The creation of TeachAIDS has been cited as an important innovation in achieving the United Nations Millennium Development Goal for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS.

Armstrong was born in Carrickfergus on 12 January 1924. He was the son of a house painter and attended Strandtown Primary School. Later he studied architecture at Queen's University Belfast, but after two years he moved to study art at Belfast College of Art. The influence of Cubism and the School of Paris can be clearly seen in his work, which took him to England, France and Spain. He also travelled and painted in the West of Ireland and Connemara inspired some of his best work. In 1950 his work was exhibited in the Grafton Gallery in Dublin, and subsequent exhibitions took place in England, Spain and the United States, as well as in Belfast and Dublin. In 1957 he was awarded a travelling scholarship from the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (a forerunner of the Arts Council of Great Britain) and went to Spain. He eventually settled in Dublin in 1962 and began showing work at the Royal Hibernian Academy. In 1968 he was awarded the Douglas Hyde Gold Medal at the Oireachtas Exhibition. In 1969 he designed sets (with George Campbell and Gerard Dillon) for the Seán O'Casey play, Juno and the Paycock, at the Abbey Theatre in Dublin. He became a member of the Royal Hibernian Academy in 1972 and in 1973 he was awarded the Art in Context prize from the Arts Council of Northern Ireland.

Bigelow gave the product a generally positive review, saying that the models would be a boon for players who use miniatures. He felt that the package should've included a greater diversity of building styles, and that the assembly instructions were unclear. Bigelow praised the included booklet as an introduction to city-based adventures, and noted that the models would combine well with other companies' products. Ken Rolston reviewed Cities of Mystery for Dragon magazine #156 (April 1990). He thought that the product was not well connected to the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, and felt that most of the elements of the package were bland and would provide little value to most players. The one exception was the 3-D buildings and street layouts, which Rolston described as \\"remarkable\\", and said would be useful set-dressing or props, especially for fantasy themed miniature wargaming.

He was a joint founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1783 and Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1789, but an active member for much longer, where he succeeded William Robertson as leader of the Moderates. He was Principal of St Mary's College, St Andrews as well as Dean of the Chapel Royal and Dean of the Order of the Thistle. Life George Hill was born on 27 May 1750 in St Andrews. His father, Rev John Hill, was one of the ministers of that town. He was the eldest son of his second wife, Jean M'Cormick, but had older siblings from the first marriage, including John Hill. His sister, Janet Hill, was the mother of Rev George Cook. His family was intermarried with the other academic and clerical families in the town. George was educated with and mixed socially with the local aristocracy, including Thomas Erskine, 1st Baron Erskine, later Lord Chancellor and The Earl of Kinnoul. Both of these were very influential in the Crown patronage networks operated by Henry Dundas, effective ruler of Scotland (and also Chancellor of St Andrews University, which itself had extensive patronage powers in the University and in appointments to clerical livings). He was educated at St Andrews Grammar School, then entered St Andrews University when he was eleven years old. There he displayed a remarkable memory and an aptitude for mathematics. He had intended to go on to study divinity but his father died when he was in his second year, leaving a large family in straightened circumstances. However, he went on to graduate M.A. when he was fourteen. After spending some time in London and Pembrokeshire as tutor to the son of the Member of Parliament Pryce Campbell, he accompanied his young charge to Edinburgh University, where he took the opportunity to continue his own studies in divinity. While there, he was regularly absorbed by the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland when it met there in the spring. He told his mother \\"spend most of my time there and have been highly entertained\\". He mixed with all the stars of the Scottish Enlightenment while in Edinburgh, being particularly repelled by what he thought were the vulgar manners and conversation of the philosopher David Hume. He returned to St Andrews and became, on 21 May 1772, just short of his 22nd birthday, joint professor of Greek (though his aged predecessor still monopolised the salary, leaving George the private tuition fees). He lectured once a fortnight, going over homework assignments in the intervening week. His lecture notes indicate his course was far more a cultural studies course – covering history, geography, literature, drama and philosophy – which is just as well, as it appears many of his students could not recognise the Greek alphabet. He also organised \\"dancing assemblies\\" to keep them entertained, as well as entertaining supper parties to which the other professors were invited. Ministry On 3 May 1775, using family connections, he managed to have himself licensed to preach the Gospel by the Presbytery of Haddington, and soon afterwards began assisting the ailing Principal Tullideph in his parochial church of St Leonards. He was a success in the pulpit, committing whole written sermons to his remarkable memory as he was too short-sighted to read them out. In 1775, he was offered the living of Coldstream by the Earl of Haddington, a pupil of his father's, but he turned it down, preferring to stick with his duties in St Andrews. In 1778, he was ordained by the Presbytery of Haddington. In 1779 he was being urged by Principal Robertson to accept an offer by the Town Council of a post in Edinburgh, but he had reasons to think prospects were opening up nearer home, so he politely declined. Later that year (1779) Principal Murison of St Andrews died, which set off a series of vacancies, leading to George Hill being appointed to a Minister's living in St Andrews, while still retaining the professorship of Greek. A complaint was made to the General Assembly that it was in breach of Church law to have two posts, but this was dismissed and on 22 June 1780 George Hill was admitted to his father's old post of Minister of the Second Charge of St Andrews. He received the degree of Doctor of Divinity on 7 May 1787. On 2 January 1788, he became professor of divinity at St Mary's College. By 1799, it was clear that the principal of the university, his uncle Dr M'Cormick, was dying, and he was offered the chance to succeed him, but he turned it down as he would have lost money by having to give up his second charge minister's post for the less lucrative one of St Leonard's. He was made dean of the Chapel Royal instead, with an additional stipend. Three years later, on 27 July 1791 he was appointed principal of St Mary's College, while retaining his second charge minister's post. In 1808, upon the death of the incumbent, Hill was moved to the even more lucrative first charge of St Andrews. General Assembly He was ordained an Elder on appointment as professor of Greek and ever since then had been returned as representative of the university, or of the presbytery, to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland at its yearly meetings. When he became a minister and progressed as an academic, his influence in the assembly grew. His speaking skills were considerable and had always been an excellent networker, noted for his conciliatory approach. He had closely studied the history, law and procedures of the General Assembly, so he was a formidable operator. Principal William Robertson was the leader of the so- called Moderates. These saw themselves as enlightened Calvinists and Presbyterians who were prepared to compromise with the Government in many matters - in particular, over the issue of Patronage - but not on the spiritual independence of the Church. George Hill was one of this party, and took over the leadership of it when Robertson died. He was a very sincere Calvinist and a proud Presbyterian, but did not take a gloomy view of the former, and accepted that landowners (the Heritors) who paid a Minister's salary had some rights in their appointment. But he was fiercely protective of the independence of the Church. In 1782, when the Lord Advocate seemed to threaten him for his views that the usual address to the Crown was too political, he said > The Church of Scotland is independent of any party and any Ministry; he > cared not for the threats of the learned gentleman, and he might tell his > friends in power that he had said so. During the French Revolutionary Wars, he vigorously opposed a plan to get Parish Ministers to urge support for a voluntary levy, as compromising the political independence of the Church and unseemly for a pacific profession. He was much opposed and vituperated but he stood firm. He would willingly contribute himself, but would \\"strip the gown from his back rather than obey an order to promote it from the pulpit\\". This was extraordinary for a man renowned as a British patriot - he expressed the hope \\"that this island will continue, to the latest ages, the fair seat of regulated freedom, of rational religion and public virtue\\"- and a Moderate (inveterate compromisers with the Government according to their enemies). The plan was dropped. But he was usually conciliatory as well as effective. In the year he was Moderator (1789) there were unusually violent squabbles over the appointment of a new Clerk to the General Assembly. At one point, Dr Hill had to suspend the Assembly. However, after the wrangles, the Assembly voted > That the thanks of the House should be given to the Moderator for his most > impartial, dignified, and able conduct in a very delicate and uncommon > situation during all the preceding diets of this venerable Assembly. He continued to attend the Assembly until 1807 when he was too infirm to travel to Edinburgh. For instance, he argued strongly against Professor John Leslie who had written an Essay on Heat, which was thought to echo too closely some sceptical philosophic views of David Hume, and were therefore \\"destructive of religion\\". Principal Hill agreed when the Assembly had been asked to censure him. The public crowded in to hear the obscure debates, but in the end, the Assembly dismissed the complaints.The Scots Magazine page 401 Politics Like most Presbyterians, he considered himself a Whig, and so no democrat. As indicated above, he thought the British Constitution was the most excellent protector of liberty in history. A sermon of his to that effect was printed in 1792, and 10,000 copies distributed, including 1000 in England. Earlier, although he thought that the British Government could have handled the American Colonists with more conciliation, he was in no doubt they were rebels to a legitimate and beneficent King. During his travels as a tutor, in 1768 he had witnessed some of the unrest associated with the election of John Wilkes ad Member of Parliament for Middlesex. He was appalled and it confirmed his horror of the common people participating in elections. During the trouble times of the French Revolutionary Wars his fear of popular unrest grew. In 1798 The General Assembly issued \\"A Warning and Admonition to the People of Scotland\\" (against popular unrest) which was produced by a committee and strongly supported by Hill. He also opposed Catholic Emancipation, holding Roman Catholics owed allegiance to a foreign power, the Pope, whom he considered a tool of the \\"power of France\\". Personal life In 1782, he married Harriet Scott, daughter of Alexander Scott, an Edinburgh merchant and magistrate who had retired to St Andrews. Her portrait was painted by Henry Raeburn (as also, it is reputed, was that of Dr Hill as Principal). In 1800 his eldest son died in Jamaica and in 1803 his younger son George and a daughter died of plague. Others were ill and in danger. Another son died in the service of the East India Company, while yet another progressed to a position of importance there. His son Alexander Hill followed him into the Ministry. His daughter married a fellow academic, Dr Cook whose brother, George Cook, was his biographer. So he was the brother of Hill's son-in-law, and a beneficiary of his patronage. He paints a portrait of a kindly, humorous but serious man who loved and was loved by his family. In his Ministry he was universally loved, according to Mr Cook, while anonymous letters (actually by Andrew M Thomson) suggesting that he worked the patronage system to his own, and his sons' advantage are dismissed. He did not let religious or party political differences harm good relationships and he certainly \\"did not regard religious controversy as a proper subject for general conversation\\". He was a member of various societies - for the sons and widows of clergymen, a Bible Society in St Andrews. He was also a founding member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and became rector of the university. Returning from the General Assembly in 1807 he was seized by a violent illness, probably suffering a fit. He recovered somewhat but by 1816 began to decline, with some slight attacks of apoplexy, impaired speech and movement. Most of his parochial work was done by an assistant but he still liked to preach. In his last appearance in Church, in 1819, he stumbled as he approached the pulpit and lost his train of thought while trying to deliver a sermon. He was bedridden thereafter. He maintained a confidence in providence till the end, though ruefully commenting that his stipend for the year 1819 was the biggest he had ever had, whilst he had done the least for it that year. He died on 19 November 1819. He is buried in the churchyard of St Andrews Cathedral. The grave lies just west of St Rules Tower within a large group of divines and professors. Family His son, Alexander Hill, was Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1845. His sister, Janet Hill, married Rev John Cook FRSE of Newburn, Fife. Their son (Hill's nephew) was the Very Rev George Cook who served as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1825. His sister, Anne Hill, married Rev Matthew Murray FRSE and they were parents to the geographer Hugh Murray. His brother was the classicist, John Hill FRSE (1747-1805).

He was a member of the Kynaston family, of North Shropshire and the Welsh Marches. Early life Kynaston was the son of Griffin Kynaston (c.1402), who was the Seneschal of Ellesmere, Shropshire and Margaret Jane Hoord (c.1423), daughter of John Hoord of Hordley. He was the direct descendant of Gruffydd Vychan ap Iowerth, the first to hold the surname \\"Kynaston\\" and therefore of Bleddyn ap Cynfyn, the last Prince of Powys, of the House of Mathrafal. Marriages and children In 1450 on his marriage to his first wife, Elizabeth Cobham (died 1453), he gained the seat of Myddle Castle, Shropshire, as a dowry. He and Elizabeth had one son, Thomas Kynaston (1453–1513), who married Maria Corbett. Thomas became High Sheriff of Shropshire in 1508. After the death of his first wife he married, in 1465, Elizabeth Grey c.1440 – 1501, daughter of Henry Grey, 2nd Earl of Tankerville and Antigone Plantagenet, granddaughter of Henry IV of England. They had the following children: *Jana Kynaston (1466) *Margaret Kynaston (c. 1467), who later married Richard Hanmer (1441 - 1507) *Humphrey Kynaston, who later became infamous as Wild Humphrey Kynaston, the highwayman, who operated in the area to the North West of Shrewsbury. *Lancelot Kynaston (1469) *Maria Kynaston (1470), who married Hywel ap Jenkin *Emma Kynaston, who married John Eyton, of Rhiwabon (Ruabon)https://archive.org/details/historyprincesl03lloygoog/page/n198/mode/2up Elizabeth Grey was the granddaughter of Eleanor Cobham, Elizabeth's sister, and Humphrey of Gloucester, the youngest son of Henry IV. Military career In 1454 Kynaston was the Constable of Denbigh Castle and High Sheriff of Shropshire in both 1461 and 1470. He was knighted in the field in 1471 after the Battle of Tewkesbury. In 1484 he was appointed for life as Escheator and High Sheriff of Merionethshire and made Constable of Hardley Castle. Guto'r Glyn, the Bard of Valle Crucis Abbey (1445–1475) wrote a \\"cywydd\\" in Kynaston's honour entitled \\"Syr Rosier Cinast o’r Cnewin\\".

On 8 August 1485, at Haverfordwest, he received a crushing blow – John Savage, nephew of Henry's stepfather, and the powerful Welsh lord, Rhys ap Thomas, were not planning to support his cause. Of course, they had promised otherwise while he was in France but Richard III suspected both men of disloyalty – and before Henry landed, he made certain they understood the penalty of treason. With this crushing news, even the professed loyalty of Pembroke was small consolation. Henry's march from Havefordwest northeast to Cardigan and there to Machynlleth (about 100 miles from the Dale settlement) is not documented. He arrived at Machynlleth on 14 August and wrote a letter to Sir Roger Kynaston, the guardian of the Grey estates; to pass safely to Shrewsbury, Henry needed – at the very least – Kynaston's inaction. The guardian didn't need to declare for him but he could at least not impede his progress. Whatever Kynaston's decision, Henry did pass safely through to Shrewsbury. To get to this point, his force had marched through the mountains of Wales but they had the continual arrival of good news to cheer them on the lonely journey – supporters were marching to join them, bringing along much-needed supplies. Among these supporters was Rhys ap Thomas, who finally decided to honour his previous promise. Rhys later said he brought almost 2000 men with him; if true, his force made up a third of Henry's entire army. They were in time to join Henry at Shrewsbury, the traditional gateway to the English midlands; they marched along the old Roman road even as supporters sent along money to pay the mercenary troops. But at Shrewsbury, Henry's progress was no longer easy.”“ The History of Plaskynaston” by Dennis Davies July 1951 revised October 1964.

Allsop is commonly described as the favourite disciple of Samuel Taylor Coleridge. He also took part in violent radical politics. Early life He was born 10 April 1795 at Stainsborough Hall, near Wirksworth, Derbyshire, a property which belonged to his grandfather. Allsop was educated at Wirksworth grammar school. At 17 he went to London, and entered the large silk mercery establishment of his uncle, Mr. Harding, at Waterloo House, Pall Mall, where he remained some years. He then left for the Stock Exchange, prospering during the early years of railway construction. Social and political circle Allsop's home was a favourite resort of Charles Lamb, William Hazlitt, Barry Cornwall, and others such as Thomas Noon Talfourd. Besides men like Lamb or Robert Owen, who would stay for weeks at a time, he shared the personal friendship of men as dissimilar as Cobbett, Joseph Mazzini, and the Emperor of Brazil, who, after a pilgrimage to the grave of Coleridge, sent to Allsop a silver urn inscribed with words of personal regard. When on a grand jury about 1836, Allsop startled London by informing the commissioners at the Old Bailey that he should think it unjust ‘to convict for offences having their origin in misgovernment,’ since society had made the crime. He was also anti-clerical. When Feargus O'Connor was elected member for Nottingham, Allsop gave him his property qualification, then necessary by law, so that Chartism might be represented in parliament. On the night before 10 April 1848, the Chartist petition moment, he advised O'Connor, writing from the Bull and Mouth hotel, St. Martin's-le-Grand, London: > Nothing rashly. The government must be met with calm and firm defiance. > Violence may be overcome with violence, but a resolute determination not to > submit cannot be overcome. Orsini assassination plot Allsop was seriously implicated, though he escaped punishment, in the plot of Felice Orsini, in which three bombs were thrown at Napoleon III in Paris on 14 January 1858. The casualties to bystanders included eight deaths and 150 injuries.Roland Sarti, Mazzini: a life for the religion of politics (1997), p. 178; Google Books. Orsini bomb, 1858, engraving published in the Illustrated London News, from a photograph of a police exhibit. The bomb was made by Joseph Taylor of Birmingham, with whom Allsop dealt.machine-history.com, Grenade bomb 1858. Orsini was travelling on an old British passport issued by the Foreign Office to Allsop, at the request of a business, as Lord Palmerston explained in Parliament.Thomas Curson Hansard, Hansard's Parliamentary Debates vol. 149 (1858), p. 598; Google Books. Allsop managed to escape after the event to America;Bernard Porter, The Refugee Question in Mid-Victorian Politics (2008), p. 190 note 113; Google Books. and stayed in New Mexico for some months, writing home to George Jacob Holyoake from Sante Fe.Edward Royle, Victorian Infidels: the origins of the British secularist movement, 1791-1866 (1974), p. 253; Google Books.Joseph McCabe, Life and Letters of George Jacob Holyoake vol. 1 (1908) pp. 250–6; Google Books. Simon Francis Bernard stood trial for his own involvement. It came out that the bombs employed in the attack were ordered by Allsop in Birmingham; but that he gave his name and address. The government offered a reward of £200 for his arrest. Holyoake and John Baxter Langley then had an interview with the home secretary, and brought an offer from Allsop to give himself up if the reward was paid to them to be applied for the expenses of his defence; the reward was withdrawn. Allsop returned to England, on 17 September. Later life and death Allsop remained active in radical causes. He served on a subcommittee set up by the International Working Men's Association in 1871 to raise money for refugees arriving from the Paris Commune. Through the body, he became a close friend of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. He also supported Charles Bradlaugh's Parliamentary campaigns from 1868 until 1880.John Saville, \\"Allsop, Thomas\\", Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.VIII, pp.1-4 Allsop died at Exmouth in 1880, and his body was moved to Woking, so that his friend Holyoake, could speak at his grave, which could only be done on unconsecrated ground. Works Allsop was attracted to lectures by Coleridge, and he heard those in 1818. He asked to meet the writer, and they developed a lasting friendship. On the poet's death Allsop published in two volumes his major work, Letters, Conversations, and Recollections of Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1836). He left autobiographical papers to Holyoake. His Budget of Two Taxes only, was addressed to the then chancellor of the exchequer in 1848. His final work was California and its Gold Mines in 1852–3: he had spent two years exploring the mines. The book consists of letters addressed to his son Robert, in the style of his friend William Cobbett's letters to his son James.

After Pavichevich Brewing declared bankruptcy in 1997, Goose Island took over production of the beer until 2002. Acquisition of the Baderbräu trademark in 2010 by entrepreneur Rob Sama led to the creation of the Baderbräu Brewing Company, which resumed brewing of the Baderbräu pilsner, and went out of business in 2018. Product description Baderbräu is a Pilsner made with Czech and German Noble hops, a private strain of European lager yeast, and malts from the USA. The beer is made in accordance with Reinheitsgebot, the German purity law of 1516 which permits only those ingredients in beer and allows no additives or preservatives. ABV: 4.8%, IBU: 38. History Baderbräu was originally brewed in the Chicago suburb of Elmhurst, Illinois from 1988 to 1997 by the Pavichevich Brewing Company (1988 to 1997), founded by Kenneth Pavichevich. In its early years, Baderbräu won acclaim, and was called by the late beer reviewer Michael Jackson “the best pilsener I’ve ever tasted in America.” By 1990, more than 200 bars in the Chicago area carried Baderbräu on tap. Later in 1990, in an attempt to increase sales, the Pavichevich Brewing Company started making medical claims about Baderbräu, which were soon dropped after an investigation by the FDA. Additionally, the company attempted distribution into Washington state, a region that already had many microbrews, which further depleted the company's focus and resources. Boston Beer Company/Sam Adams founder Jim Koch, toured the company in 1990, saying, “He (Pavichevich) could take away all my customers in Chicago and still go bankrupt in two years.” In 1997, the Pavichevich Brewing Company filed for bankruptcy and was liquidated at auction in bankruptcy court. An investment company called Prairie Associates acquired the Baderbräu trademark and formula then promptly sold this intellectual property to rival Goose Island for an undisclosed sum that is purported to be more than $100,000 US. In 1998, Goose Island won a silver medal with Baderbräu Pilsner for the Bohemian pilsner category in the Great American Beer Festival. Goose Island continued to brew Baderbräu until 2002, at which point they substituted its brewing for their trademarked “Golden Goose Pils.” Baderbräu Revival In 2010, entrepreneur Rob Sama registered the Baderbräu trademark and URL, sourced the original recipe (including its proprietary yeast strain), and restarted the company. Baderbräu resumed brewing on a contract basis in 2012 with the assistance of original Baderbräu pilsner creator Douglas Babcook.McDermott, Mark (2012-07-14). \\"Baderbrau Returns!

Its permanent and travelling exhibitions focus on the fossils remains from fauna and flora of Patagonia, as well as the geological changes that affected the region throughout prehistory. The museum is named for Egidio Feruglio. MEF is also one of Argentina's main scientific institutions, with a robust research program in areas such as Vertebrate and Invertebrate Paleontology, Paleobotany, and Ichnology. It also has a group focusing on plants in semi- desert environments.  MEF exhibitions  MEF's permanent exhibition is a journey into the natural past of Patagonia. It begins about 10,000 years ago, with the first human settlements in the area. In each room, specimens from both terrestrial and marine life forms are shown for each geological period, up to the early Paleozoic. The Mesozoic hall depicting the giant dinosaurs of Patagonia is perhaps the most popular attraction in the museum. The journey goes on at the mini-theatre with a film showing the evolution of the Universe back to the Big Bang itself. The exhibition also offers a view into MEF's largest, state-of-the-art Preparation Laboratory, where fossils are carefully cleaned and separated from its surrounding rock. Visitors can here witness the progress of actual work done on the most recent fossils findings. Also, shown daily at the \\"Germán Sopeña\\" Auditórium is The Mystery of the Jurassic, a BBC production featuring MEF scientists. The traveling exhibition featuring the \\"Dinosaurs of Patagonia\\" has visited many cities in Argentina and abroad. A recent European tour included Germany, Spain, Portugal, and the Czech Republic. Individual replicates have been provided to museums in different countries.  Bryn Gwyn Geopark  MEF also administers the Bryn Gwyn Geopark, a large natural geological reserve located 8 km South of Gaiman, and about 25 km from Trelew. The park is located on the slanted lands that separate the Chubut River valley from the higher Patagonian steppe. The trail depicts typical fossils (both real and replicates) dating up to 40 million years ago.  Research  Patagotitan femur on display at the museum. MEF is an \\"Associated Research Unit\\" to Argentina's National Research Council (CONICET), a qualification attained by very few local NGOs. Almost all of MEF researchers and postdoctoral fellows are career scientists working under CONICET. The Museum's research area includes a Collection with more than 17,000 fossils (as of 2009), preparation laboratory and campaign equipment. It also has a workshop for fossil replicate production, used both in research and exhibitions.  Expeditions  In 2014, a team of paleontologists from the museum excavated the remains in Patagonia of seven specimens of a titanosaur, Patagotitan mayorum, the largest dinosaur ever found.  Outreach and educational programs  The Museum's outreach department includes activities for families, schools and the global community. Some recent examples include: * Open house: free admission and special activities during one weekend of June. * Paleodesafío: a knowledge-based competition on Paleontology, Geology and Astronomy for secondary schools in the Chubut province. * Explorers in Pyjamas: children spend the night in the Museum, playing, learning, and, finally, sleeping with the dinosaurs in the exhibition. * Café Scientifique: a cup of coffee and an informal conversation with a scientist.

It lies in the Innerste valley southeast of the county town of Hildesheim on the B 243 federal highway.  History  The first recorded mention of the village dates to the year 1085. Until the demise of ecclesiastical principalities the village belonged to the Little Hildesheim Stift and is therefore among the so-called Catholic Stift villages. This is especially noticeably in the baroque parish church of St. Cosmas and Damian built in 1733; its tower also depicts the village coat of arms. The independent parish of Groß Düngen was merged in 1966 with several neighbouring villages to become the municipality of Düngen (Samtgemeinde Düngen). This was incorporated in 1974 into the borough of Bad Salzdetfurth in 1974 (with the exception of Egenstedt and Marienburg).  Politics  The village 'mayor' is Marc Busche (SPD).  Culture and places of interest  * The Catholic church in the village is a baroque building that was built in 1733.

Childhood Pnina Bor was born November 30, 1924 to Zionist parents in the city of Tel Aviv. Her father came to Palestine from Russia during the Second Aliya where he met Pnina's mother, a third generation native. Pnina studied at Le'Dugma Elementary School and Geula High School. She also studied music, played the piano, and completed the Hebrew Conservatory in Tel Aviv. Pnina joined the Haganah, and served in the armed forces until the establishment of the State of Israel. She was recommended for a position in the Jewish Agency and became the secretary of Levi Eshkol, Israel's Prime Minister. She was in charge of Israel's army recruitment because she had the skills that were needed to fulfill this important job. B'nai B'rith Pnina Bor was a member of the B'nai B'rith Organization and became one of its strongest leaders to date. In 1965 she was elected president of the Miriam Ha'Nevia chapter in the city of Ramat Gan where she resided. She received a prestigious award given to presidents of the organization called \\"Menorah\\". She later went on to be the Chair of the Regional council in the Gush Dan area. Pnina led many committees in the organization including \\"The Committee for Israel, Culture and Tourism\\". She was chosen to be Israel's representative in the B'nai B'rith International Council and the Council of Trustees, which are two of the most important committees in the B'nai B'rith Organization worldwide. Pnina was subsequently elected to be the vice president and later on the national president of B'nai B'rith in Israel in 1986. This was the first time that a woman was elected to serve in this role. Pnina was so successful that she was elected 3 consecutive times for a total of 12 years. Under Pnina's leadership, the B'nai B'rith Organization flourished and was intricately involved in Israeli life, establishing new lodges throughout the country. In addition, extensive fundraising took place from local and international donors strengthening the organization. Pnina became the supervisor of B'nai B'rith in Israel and eventually the global vice president for 8 years. Contributions to other organizations Pnina Bor volunteered throughout the years in different organizations such as: Shalva Retirement Home where she served as a director; Aguda Le'Ma'an HaChayal as a council member; and Libi, which gives scholarships to victims of the IDF. She was recommended by the Prime Minister to serve on a committee that grants awards to volunteers called \\"Ot Ha'Mitnadev\\". This award is granted on behalf of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and also on behalf of the President of Israel. As busy as she was, Pnina Bor devoted a lot of energy to the city of Ramat Gan where she resided for almost 60 years. Not only did she participate in various committees in the city, but she encouraged others to volunteer, encouraged tourism, and promoted initiatives to help the welfare of the city's residents. She promoted causes such as: scholarships for needy children; setting up senior centers; supporting police officers; adopting families in need; and supporting immigrant absorption centers to name a few. Her dedication to humanity was truly remarkable. Recognition Pnina Bor was highly regarded in Israel and abroad. Throughout her lifetime she received many awards and honors including: \\"Yakirat Am Yafe, Am Echad\\"; \\"Yakirat Ramat Gan\\" (Ramat Gan, 1995); \\"Mother of the Year\\" (B'nai B'rith); \\"Menorah\\" (President's Organization); JNF Trees. Pnina Bor was chosen to speak at conferences that were held in various religious institutions of all denominations to explain the political situation in Israel and abroad. Not every community was sympathetic towards Israel but this never deterred her. She was interviewed numerous times by the press, radio, and television. Pnina was awarded the \\"Mayors Degree\\" and given honorary citizenship from 15 cities in the United States. She also received \\"The Mayor of San Antonio\\" award which was an honorary citizenship award with the Houston, Texas city key, and received a special certificate from the \\"Borough of Bronx\\", New York. The National Jewish monthly, a B'nai B'rith publication, chose Pnina as one of the 6 most active women in the organization worldwide. Family life Pnina Bor was married for almost 60 years to Abraham Bor, a master cellist, and member of the Israeli Philharmonic Orchestra. They are the parents of four children.

In part two, which is set in the Free City of Dyvers, the characters must solve the mystery of the tiny burglars.

Publication history WG11 Puppets was written by Vince Garcia and Bruce Rabe, and was published by TSR in 1989 as a 32-page booklet with an outer folder. Editing and development was done by Jim Lowder. Puppets was adapted from two scenarios previously run as RPGA (Role Playing Game Association) tournaments. Reception Ken Rolston reviewed Puppets for Dragon magazine in July 1991. Rolston declared both scenarios \\"competently presented and playable\\", saying their primary appeal comes from three very good ideas that he felt could be freely exported into other scenario and adventure settings. He declines to identify these \\"cheap tricks\\" to prevent spoilers, but notes that the first two are \\"humorous and whimsical\\" encounters along the road in the convoy adventure, and that the third is the central plot element of the town adventure and the title concept of the module: \\"The concept is clever, an idea you can take and run with or present as concisely as session time and interest permit.\\" He called the adventure designs \\"sound and reliable, easily scanned and presented by experienced DMs.\\" He said less-experienced DMs, or ones who were not good at improvisation, might have more difficulty getting use out of the adventure, continuing, \\"The town adventure's middle game is either pretty sketchy or appealingly open- ended, depending on how you feel about such things.\\" He noted that the DM improvises a lot of informant NPC personalities, and that the system for handling the NPCs and clues \\"looks a bit cheesy, but it's actually just the sort of thing that skilled NPC improvisers will love\\". He also says that the action elements are \\"exceptionally compact and concise—again, just the way many DMs like it\\". Rolston concluded the review by stating, \\"These make a pair of very good adventures that are easily adapted to other settings, with nifty plot and encounter elements, abundant opportunities for clever play, and plenty of juicy character roles for the DM.\\" References External links *Review in Games International Greyhawk modules ","title":"Puppets (module)"},{"id":"30077678","text":"Stigmella auricularia is a moth of the family Nepticulidae.

Shernoff (born c.1949) is a prominent American trial lawyer based in Claremont, California/Beverly Hills, USA. He is one of the pioneers of a branch of law known as \\"insurance bad faith\\", in which he investigates the alleged bad faith and misconduct of insurance companies. This began in 1971 with his first insurance case. He then founded the firm of Shernoff Bidart Echeverria LLP, in 2004, heading a team of 10 litigation lawyers who are widely known as the \\"bad faith insurance lawyers\\". Shernoff is also the author and co-author of several books on law, including Bad Faith (1984), Payment Refused (1986), How to Make Insurance Companies Pay Your Claims and What to Do If They Don't (1990) and Fight Back & Win (1999). He has served for many years on the Board of Directors of the national insurance consumer organization, United Policyholders. Early life William M. Shernoff was born circa 1949 in Wisconsin. His father was a lawyer. Career In 1974, Shernoff won a $5 Million punitive damages verdict for a roofer whose disability payments had been cut off (Egan v. Mutual of Omaha). In 1979, he persuaded the California Supreme Court to establish new case law, based on Egan, that permits plaintiffs to sue insurance companies for bad faith seeking both compensatory and punitive damages when companies unreasonably handle a policyholder's claim. In 1979, Shernoff won a landmark case amounting to $86 million for the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas when the insurance company failed to meet its obligations after the fire which devastated the hotel. His most successful case was in the early 1990s related to Cyclone Val, a tropical cyclone that devastated American Samoa in December 1991. In 1991, American Samoa had purchased a $45-million \\"all risk\\" insurance policy from the firm Affiliated FM Insurance. However, the firm would only pay up $6.1 million for the damages, arguing that the insurance did not cover water damage, only that driven by the wind. Shernoff investigated and discovered that the insurance company had altered American Samoa's insurance policy to exclude damages caused by \\"wind-driven water\\", despite it still covering hurricanes. The case was taken to court and in 1995 the jury awarded the American Samoa Government $28.9 million, and then added twice that amount ($57.8 million) for punitive damages. The total award in the final judgment was $86.7 million,Jury Awards $86.7 Million to American Samoa Government for Breach of Hurricane Insurance Policy, September 26, 1995 which is stated to be the largest insurance bad faith judgment in the state of California, in 1995. Shernoff also won several landmark cases against Generali insurance on behalf of Holocaust victims, which paved the way for a historic five billion dollar settlement for Holocaust victim restitution in 2002. Shernoff is highly acclaimed in the legal profession in the United States and has ranked on The Best Lawyers in America, every year since its first edition in 1983. In 2004, he was named \\"Super Lawyer\\" by Law & Politics and Los Angeles magazine and was named as one of the 100 Most Influential Attorneys in California.

It was originally misidentified as Encarsia opulenta, but was recorded as a new species in 1998. It is a native of Asia but has been introduced to many other parts of the world as a means of controlling the citrus blackfly. Distribution This wasp is a native of India and Vietnam.Silvestri F. 1927. Contribuzione alla conoscenza degli Aleurodidae (Insecta: Hemiptera) viventi su citrus in Extremo Oriente e dei loro parasiti. Boll. Lab. Zool. Portici. 21: 1-60. It has been introduced to and has established itself in Barbados, Cuba, Jamaica, Mexico, Salvador, Venezuela, the USA (Florida, Texas and Hawaii), Kenya and Oman, for the purpose of controlling citrus blackfly. Description The female is just over one millimetre long with antennae 0.8 millimetre in length. The thorax is straw coloured, the wings are transparent with a smoky patch in the centre and the legs are whitish. The abdomen is straw-coloured at the front and dark brown behind with a dark-coloured ovipositor 0.5 millimetres long. The male is smaller, averaging 0.75 millimetres in length and is a uniform dark brown. Life cycle After mating, a female lays diploid eggs in nymphs of the citrus blackfly. When available, a second instar nymph is selected and each egg will eventually produce a female adult. At 24 °C in the laboratory, it takes 30 to 35 days from egg-laying to adult emergence. Unmated females lay haploid eggs in the fully developed larvae of their own species. These hatch out into males, a process known as adelphoparasitism. The sex ratio among adults in the field is one male to every seven females. Encarsia perplexa is itself parasitized by Encarsia smithi which was accidentally introduced into Florida in the 1970s. Use in biological control The only hosts that have been identified for Encarsia perplexa are Aleurocanthus woglumi and Aleurocanthus incertus, another whitefly. This means that introducing the species into a citrus growing area is unlikely to have adverse ecological side effects. Amitus hesperidum is another citrus blackfly parasitoid that has been used alongside E. perplexa to control the pest. It reproduces rapidly and can produce up to seventy progeny per female and is very successful at controlling heavy infestations. E. perplexa multiplies more slowly but is better at scouting for outlying blackflies and is more effective when populations of potential hosts are lower. In Hawaii, both species were introduced in 1999 after the citrus blackfly was discovered there for the first time the previous year. They rapidly became established and were soon controlling the pest on the island of Oahu. Later releases on other islands in the group have also been an effective, though not immediate, means of reducing infestations.

It is located in the Coyoacán borough of Mexico City, in a former private house which was donated to the museum by the city government. It was founded and run by artist Alfredo Guati Rojo from its beginnings in 1964 until his death in 2003. The museum is dedicated to the preservation and continuance of watercolor painting both in Mexico and abroad, with its permanent collection of 300 works donated by Guati Rojo and his wife, classes in watercolor and drawing, its annual Premio Nacional de Acuarela (National Watercolor Prize) and various temporary exhibits both at the museum and abroad. History Poem dedicated to the museum on outer wall The museum and the modern history of watercolor in Mexico is the work of artist Alfredo Guati Rojo. He studied art at the San Carlos Academy in the 1930s, graduating with a master’s in 1940. While he studied all aspects of art, he stated that he was always drawn to watercolor painting. After graduation, he decided to teach short courses for those with inclination but not the means for a formal art education. This became an art institute which offered courses in ceramics, fashion design, furniture design, and jewelry making as well as the fine arts. In 1957, it rented a large house in Colonia Roma. In the 1940s and 1950s, watercolor began to be recognized as a technique with its own particular qualities with artists such as Ricardo Sierra, Carmen Jimenez Labora and Luis G. Serrano dedicated to it. However, many art gallery owners at the time refused to show watercolor works, as it was considered to be a minor art, especially compared to oil painting, as it was associated with lithographs, and small portraits. Guati Rojo established a space in the institute in Colonia Roma dedicated to the showing of watercolors in 1964, called the Salon de Acuarela (Annual Salon of Watercolors). These shows began to attract attention and favorable reviews, and allowed artists to sell paintings. It was renamed the Salon Nacional de Acuarela (National Salon of Watercolors) in 1967 and dedicated itself to the promotion of both Mexican and international watercolor painting. Part of the gardens of the complex Since graduating from the San Carlos Academy, Guati Rojo and his wife Berta Pietrasanta, collected watercolors and other artworks, starting with Guati Rojo’s teachers and companions from the Academy and later from his own students and from trips to Europe. By 1977, they had amassed a collection of 300 watercolors, and approached the Secretariat of Public Education with the idea of creating a more formal museum if the agency would provide a site. However, nothing came of this. Soon after, the coupled formed a private society with the aim of founding the museum without government help. This society raised money for two years by presenting shows and concerts. The museum was formally established at the Colonia Roma site, with Guati Roja as first director, but also providing much of the needed money from his own funds, along with the initial 300 pieces. This gave it the name of Museo Nacional de la Acuarela (National Watercolor Museum). In 1985, the arts institute, along with the watercolor museum, was destroyed by the 1985 Mexico City earthquake. In 1987, the city government bought the house on Salvador Novo Street in Coyoacan, the present site, and donated it to the watercolor museum. However, the government also stated that it could do no more to support the project. The museum continued on private donations and the efforts of Guati Rojo’s work. He not only provided much of the funding, but his popularity helped to promote the museum along with Mexican watercolor painting in general. In 2003, Guati Rojo died, a few weeks after his wife. At the time, he was working on two books, one about the museum and the other an autobiography, both left unfinished. His funeral was held at the museum with his ashes on display under the work called El circo de la vida (\\"The circus of life\\"). His death sparked concerns about the future of the museum, along with the legal status of the museum site. However, the museum still remains on the same site. Description Visitors at the 2010 Benial Internacional de Acuarela at the museum The museums remains dedicated to the rescue and promotion of watercolor painting in Mexico. Its permanent collection shows examples of the art from the pre-Hispanic period to the present. The museum also offers classes and sponsors shows on site, in other locations in Mexico and abroad. The museum is housed on a property with a formerly private house. The permanent collection is in the main house, which is surrounded by gardens, a temporary exhibit hall, a café, and an auditorium. The gardens are the work of Guati Rojo and his wife over the years. It is filled with flowering shrubs, vines, fountains and several modern sculptures with strong Mexican influence. It includes a poetry garden with a large stone sculpture inscribe with verses by Nezahualcoyotl, as well as some verses by Guati Rojo himself. The main house is in the center of the property. It contains seven rooms dedicated to the showing of various pieces related to watercolor as well as an intact study. The seven rooms are arranged by chronological order beginning from the pre-Hispanic period until the present day with both Mexican and international watercolor art. The base of this collection are 300 watercolors which were donated by Guati Rojo and his wife when the museum was founded. Although western watercolor painting has its origins in Asia, the pre-Hispanic room is included as many clay vessels were painted with paints made from water and natural pigments. These same paints were used to create codices, which were used into the early colonial period as a form of record keeping. The room after this focuses on 19th-century work, with miniature portraits on ivory and paper, as well as works done by travelers who used the medium to record images of the places they visited. The rest of the space is dedicated to more modern works. In addition to Guati Rojo’s own works, which fill two rooms, others include Mujer Indígena by Pastor Velázquez, Amapolas and Bahia de Habana, Cuba by Manuel M. Ituarte, as well as several works by Eduardo Solares and Leandro Izaguirre. Behind the main house is the Berta Pietrasanta Temporary Exhibition Hall, which holds shows of mostly watercolor works by both Mexican and international artists. Its largest show is the Bienal Internacional de Acuarela (International Biennial of Watercolors), an international exhibition of watercolors held every two years. Other recent shows included a display of 45 lithographs by Honoré Daumier which were donated to the Museo de la Estampa in 1999 and returned for the show. Another show was a collection of winners from a watercolor contest in Michoacán featuring work by Joel Astreo, from Zamora; Nadia Nucico, from Uruapan; Ángel Pahuamba, from the Meseta Purépecha area; Mireya Parra, from Morelia; Judith Lara, from Morelia; Dionicio Pascoe, from Tacámbaro; Mercedes Fernández, from Capula, and Javier López, from Morelia. As a cultural institution and in conjunction with the Sociedad Mexicana de Acuarelistas, the museum hosts and sponsors, art classes, literary events, talent contests and academic events. The most important of its annual talent events is the Premio Nacional de la Acuarela, which began in 2000. The museum is funded privately, with much of it coming from the Society. For international shows, the Secretariat of Foreign Relations helps with costs such as shipping. International shows have brought the museum renown, as it is the first of its kind in the world.  Sociedad Mexicana de Acuarelistas Associated with the museum, but legally separate is the Sociedad Mexicana de Acuarelistas (Mexican Society of Watercolor Artists). This society was established in 1964 by Guati Rojo with twelve other original members: Gustavo Alanís, Edgardo Coghlan, Manuel Arrieta, Aguirre Tinoco, Jesús Ochoa, Teresa Miranda, Cristina Romero, Luis Canales, Rodolfo Vankurzyn, Carlos Sommer, Angel Mauro Rodríguez and Joaquín Martínez Navarrete. The society was moved to the Coyoacán site in 1988 and part of its work is to support the museum. Today, the Society has 83 members, most of whom are in Mexico City. Among them: Sebastián Canovas. It sponsors watercolor shows both at this museum and in others around the world including INTER ART in Germany, Galería Nacional and the Instituto de México in Bogotá, and in the Contemporary Museum in Saint Petersburg.

It stars Stephan Bender and Max Roeg. Plot Fifteen-year-old Nathan Davies (Stephan Bender) moves to St. Francisville, Louisiana, a small Southern town with his parents (Thomas Jay Ryan and Diana Scarwid) and starts to befriend the older boy next door, Roy (Maximillian Roeg), fellow high school student and bus driver, who is in a relationship with Evelyn (Rooney Mara). Nathan and Roy start to develop their relationship by helping each other with school work at Nathan's house. While Roy is teaching Nathan how to solve an algebra problem, Nathan touches his hand. Roy pulls away at first, but then takes hold of Nathan's hand. After they finish their work, the boys go for a walk in the woods, finding an old cemetery, where they stop and start kissing. They undress down to everything but socks and underwear, and lie in an embrace together. The relationship between Nathan and his father is revealed to be a little strange and full of tension. One morning Roy pulls the bus into a part in the woods and they kiss and Nathan touches Roy. Roy asks if Nathan has ever done this with anyone before, and he promises he never has. Roy takes Nathan swimming with Burke and Randy, but Nathan admits he can't swim. While watching Roy, Burke threatens to throw him in the water, but Roy stops him. While Roy is driving them home, he pulls onto the side of the road and they start kissing. When Nathan starts to have sex with Roy, Roy angrily stops him, asking \\"who taught [him] to screw like that\\". Nathan swears \\"no one\\". When Nathan gets home that night, his father wants to know if he had a good time. Nathan is on the brink of tears as he answers his father. He ties a string up to his dresser drawer and bedpost, tucks his pillows under his sheets, and moves to the floor to sleep. In the night he hears a thud and runs from his room, because it's his father sneaking in. It is later revealed that his father had touched him in the past inappropriately. Nathan sleeps outside and comes home only for meals, but returns to his tree outside after eating. Roy finds him and offers him a place to sleep in his family's barn. The next morning, Nathan goes home for breakfast and his father catches him, yelling at him to not run from him, but Nathan's mother interrupts and he runs to the school bus. Later, Roy tells Nathan they're going camping with Burke and Randy that weekend. That night, Roy tells ghost stories around the campfire, and in their tent, Nathan gives Roy a blowjob, and Roy asks him if he minds when Roy doesn't do those things back to him, and Nathan says he doesn't mind. Hiking through the woods, the boys find an old plantation house. They go inside to investigate, and Nathan hears a voice call his name, resembling his father's. They then find cloth with what looks like to be blood on it, and they smell sulfur (which Nathan says is the smell of the Devil), and the boys see a shadow move up the stairs. Burke takes the flashlight from Roy and goes to investigate with Randy. Roy and Nathan go into a bedroom and talk, and Nathan says he feels as if he'll never leave that house. He hears the voice again and Roy goes to see if the guys are back. Nathan sees his father and closes his eyes tight, when Roy enters the room again. He tells Nathan not to look at whatever he's seeing anymore and kisses him. Roy gets down on his knees and proceeds to fellate Nathan, when Burke and Randy find them. Roy storms out of the room, and Nathan hears the voice again, and is suddenly knocked unconscious. A shadow of a person carries him up the stairs. In the attic, Burke rapes Nathan, and realizing what he's done, disgusted with himself, he breaks an arm off a rocking chair and knocks Nathan over the head with it. Blood starts pooling on the floor beneath Nathan's head, and Burke leaves him in the attic. When Roy and Randy find Nathan early the next morning, he appears to be dead. Roy tells Randy to go on and find Burke, whom he says he doesn't believe at this point about what happened. Roy cries once Randy leaves, then Roy leaves too. The police arrive, bringing Nathan's father who tearfully covers Nathan's face with a blanket. Nathan awakens as if he's resurrected from the dead, gets up and leaves the plantation house. He wanders for a long time still dazed from the blow to his head. Finally he sees Roy coming out of Sunday evening church, but Roy is with his family, so Nathan wanders around some more waiting for Roy to get home. Nathan's mother leaves his father, and Nathan, his head now clear, finds Roy crying in the barn where Nathan slept while hiding from his father. As Roy looks up, he sees Nathan and hugs him. At the end of the story, Roy is driving the bus and looks in the mirror to an empty seat, but when he looks a second time, Nathan is there smiling at him. = Differences from novel = The movie departs from the novel and leaves the impression that Nathan is truly dead, and that the previous scenes were a wishful dream sequence of one of the two boy lovers, presumably Roy. In the book this scene does not take place. The book has the boys meeting in the yard of Roy's church, running together into the woods to talk things over, and deciding to run away together since Roy has been seen kissing Nathan by both Burke and Randy, and both boys will surely be outed to their families and the whole community. The book ends with: \\"They hear the voices of people searching for them in the woods. They stand and go. They never look back.\\" Cast * Stephan Bender as Nathan Davies * Maximillian Roeg as Roy * Randy Wayne as Burke, one of Roy's best friends * Owen Beckman as Randy, one of Roy's best friends * Thomas Jay Ryan as Harland Davies, Nathan's abusive father * Diana Scarwid as Vivian Davies, Nathan's mother * Rooney Mara as Evelyn, Roy's girlfriend * Rickie Lee Jones as Roy's mother Release Dream Boy first screened at the Berlin International Film Festival in Germany on February 12, 2008.

It was originally built in 1870 by the Midland Railway Company to allow access to and from their goods station at Sydenham Field on the south bank of the river Avon, the opposite bank to the passenger Green Park terminus station and the city centre. History The Midland Railway's Mangotsfield and Bath branch line opened to a temporary passenger terminus on the south side of the Avon on 4 July 1869; the railway bridge and the new permanent passenger station were built in the early months of 1870, and the road bridge followed by the middle of the year. The two bridges and the station were designed by John Holloway Sanders and engineered by Messrs Allport Jnr and Wilson, and the original road bridge resembled the railway bridge – which still exists – but without a central pier in the middle of the river. The railway complex on the south side of the river became more important in 1874 with the opening of the Bath extension of the Somerset and Dorset Railway. But the new bridge also provided an important road link between the centre of Bath and the late Victorian suburbs to the south and west such as Oldfield Park and Twerton. The current Midland Bridge dates from 1905. The original bridge was replaced under a deal done between the city corporation and the Bath Electric Tramways Company, in which the tramways company paid a total of £16,400 for various road improvements around Bath that would assist the expansion and electrification of its tram system. The new bridge was built by the Derby foundry company Handyside and Co., and was 36 feet wide, against the 20 feet of the original, which also allowed two pavements to be provided where there had been only one before. The tram company's interest was in providing a new access route from Twerton and Oldfield Park to the city centre via the bridge, Kingsmead Square and Westgate Street; the bridge was built with a single line of tram tracks in place. But although the city council gave permission and the mayor was very encouraging at the bridge's opening, the tram scheme did not materialise and the single track was eventually removed. Original Midland Bridge, resited as the Destructor Bridge in Bath, as seen in 2013The original bridge was re-used to provide a link between the old 'scavenger's yard' and the new 'Destructor' incinerator across the Avon further to the west of the city. This relocation and reconstruction was undertaken by the engineer John Cambridge. It was replaced by a new bridge in 2016, though not opened to vehicles until 2020. The Midland Bridge now carries the B3118 road, which is one of the main inner city road crossings over the River Avon. A major refurbishment of the bridge was carried out in 2015.

Overview  The mansion is owned and operated by The Summit County Historical Society of Akron, Ohio and is also the organization's headquarters. It was built from 1835 to 1837 by Col. Simon Perkins, son of Akron's founder General Simon Perkins. It served as the family home until 1945 when it was purchased from George Perkins Raymond for $25,000. Design and construction The Perkins Stone Mansion was built between 1835 and 1837 on owned by Colonel Simon Perkins, the oldest son of the City of Akron's founder, Gen. Simon Perkins. At the time of its completion, the home was located one mile from the southwest border of Akron and along the prehistoric Portage Path of Summit County, Ohio. The house overlooked the City of Akron from the front porch and the \\"widow's walk\\" on the roof provided a viewing point of the Ohio and Erie Canal. Records suggest it was designed by Isaac Ladd of Warren, Ohio. It was designed in the Greek Revival Style. The Mansion was constructed of hand cut yellow sandstone that was quarried nearby its location. Perkins eventually expanded his estate to . The land was used for farming and sheep grazing and eventually became known as \\"Mutton Hill.\\" The pasture land came right to the front porch and the house was originally flanked by vegetable gardens and an arbor. Other structures This view of the Perkins Stone Mansion shows the Wash House, one of the outbuildings on the property. Located nearby the Mansion is the Wash House where the Perkins family washed and dried clothing, bedding, and other textiles. Next to the Wash House is the original well. Behind the mansion is the \\"woodshed\\" that now serves as the office building for the Summit County Historical Society of Akron, Ohio. Reconstructed versions of the Carriage House, gazebo, and outhouse are also located on the property. The property was surrounded by a dry mortared stone wall, much of which remains to this day.

LEED certification provides independent, third-party verification that a development's location and design meet accepted high levels of environmentally responsible, sustainable development. The LEED-ND system is a collaboration between the United States Green Building Council, the Congress for the New Urbanism, and the Natural Resources Defense Council.http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=148  Significance of LEED-ND certification  LEED for Neighborhood Development recognizes development projects that successfully protect and enhance the overall health, natural environment, and quality of life. The rating system encourages smart growth and New Urbanism best practices by: * Promoting the location and design of neighborhoods that reduce vehicle miles travelled (VMT) * Creating developments where jobs and services are accessible by foot or public transit * Promoting an array of green building and green infrastructure practices, particularly for more efficient energy and water use * Protecting and conserving habitat, wetlands, water bodies, and prime agricultural lands through the maintenance of natural areas and \\"smart location\\" choiceshttps://www.usgbc.org/sites/all/assets/section/files/v4-guide- excerpts/Excerpt_v4_ND.pdf Cities are increasingly using LEED-ND certification to accelerate the development of certified projects.  Project types  LEED for Neighborhood Development is designed to certify exemplary development projects that perform well in terms of smart growth, urbanism, and green building. Projects may constitute whole neighborhoods, portions of neighborhoods, or multiple neighborhoods. Projects are often mixed-use, though small single-use projects that complement existing neighborhood uses may also use the rating system. Local jurisdictions should not use LEED-ND as a replacement for comprehensive planning, however, many local jurisdictions may find that LEED for Neighborhood Development is a meaningful tool to help promote sustainable land development if incentivized or used as a guideline when revising local codes and regulations.  Site Types  Before categorization, the neighborhood is defined by its site type depending on \\"where the boundary is set, the status of land inside the boundary, and the status of properties surrounding the boundary.\\"https://www.usgbc.org/sites/all/assets/section/files/v4-guide- excerpts/Excerpt_v4_ND.pdf The following sites are acceptable for LEED-ND: * Previously developed land has to have been at least 75% complete prior to the construction of the new LEED certified ND.https://www.usgbc.org/sites/all/assets/section/files/v4-guide- excerpts/Excerpt_v4_ND.pdf * Infill sites * Sites adjacent to existing developments  Credit Categories  The following credit categories are included in the rating system: ; Smart Location and Linkage : Encourages communities to consider location, transportation alternatives, and preservation of sensitive lands while also discouraging sprawl. In order to qualify as a smart location, the project must \\"...be located (1) on an infill site; (2) within walking distance of public transit stops; (3) in an areas with preexisting shops, services, and facilities; or (4) on a site where evidence shows that the average per capita rate of vehicle miles traveled will be lower than that for the metropolitan region as a whole.\\"Howe, J.

Stages of certification  LEED for Neighborhood Development differs from other commercial and residential LEED rating systems as it has three stages of certification that relate to phases of real-estate development: ; Stage 1 Conditionally Approved Plan : Provides the conditional approval of a LEED-ND Plan available for projects before they have completed the entitlements, or public review, process. It is envisioned that completing Stage 1 will help projects get support from the local government and from the community. ; Stage 2 Pre-Certified Plan : Pre-certifies a LEED-ND plan and is applicable for fully entitled projects or projects under construction. Completing this review can help projects secure financing, expedited permitting or attract tenants. ; Stage 3 Certified Neighborhood Development : Completed projects formally apply for LEED certification to recognize that the project has achieved all the prerequisites and credits attempted.  LEED-ND and other LEED rating systems  All LEED-ND projects are required to have at least one certified green building. \\"...the LEED rating for new construction requires developers to complete a detailed checklist and awards 64 possible points for green building practices.\\" Wheeler, Stephen M. “Chapter 14: Green Architecture and Building.” Planning for Sustainability: Creating Livable, Equitable and Ecological Communities, 2nd ed., Routledge, 2013, pp. 194–196.

Background The event was the sixth that the UFC has hosted in Canada and the first sanctioned mixed martial arts event in Ontario since the sport was legalized in the province in August 2010. The Toronto event was originally titled UFC 131 by the promotion, but later changed to UFC 129 as its early 2011 schedule started to fall more firmly into place. A crowd of 55,000 filled Rogers Centre for UFC 129 It was the largest UFC event in North American history and coincided with a two-day UFC Fan Expo at the Direct Energy Centre. UFC officials had originally planned for the Rogers Centre to be configured to hold 42,000 fans for UFC 129. The UFC put those tickets on sale to UFC Fight Club members in a special pre-sale on February 10, 2011, selling nearly all of them. They released and sold more tickets the following day to UFC newsletter subscribers in a second special pre-sale. UFC 129 then sold out when tickets went on sale to the general public on February 12, with officials scrambling to up the number of seats to 55,000. Selling out all 55,000 tickets for gate revenues exceeding $11 million, the event shatters both MMA attendance and gate records in North America. John Makdessi was rumored to face Jonathan Brookins at the event; however, Makdessi instead fought Kyle Watson. In a conference call for UFC: Fight For The Troops 2 in January 2011, Dana White confirmed that UFC Featherweight Champion José Aldo would defend his title against Mark Hominick on this card, provided that Hominick defeated George Roop. White also stated that, regardless of the outcome of the Hominick/Roop fight, Aldo would still defend his Featherweight Championship at this event. Hominick defeated Roop, via first-round TKO, to confirm his place as no. 1 contender, and solidify the bout with Aldo. After the bout, judge Doug Crosby made a mistake scoring the 5th round 10–8 in favor of José Aldo instead of Mark Hominick, making the final tally 50–43 for Aldo. A correction was made after the bout, and the correct score was 48–45 in favor of Aldo. Rory MacDonald was expected to face James Wilks at this event, but Wilks was forced from the card, and replaced by Nate Diaz. On February 11, it was announced that Matt Hamill will no longer fight Phil Davis at this event and will instead fight Quinton Jackson at UFC 130. In a Twitter post, Davis said he was \\"sorry the fight had been removed from the website, and would be fighting in Toronto regardless.\\" Davis was expected to face Jason Brilz until Tito Ortiz had to pull out of his UFC Fight Night: Seattle fight with Antonio Rogerio Nogueira. Davis headlined that event against Nogueira, while Brilz is now expected to fight Vladimir Matyushenko at this event. Brian Foster was expected to face Sean Pierson at this event, but Foster was forced out of the bout after a pre-fight MRI scan showed that Foster had a brain hemorrhage, and was replaced by Jake Ellenberger. On February 27, 2011, it was revealed that two of the preliminary bouts would air on a Sportsnet card. These bouts aired at a new time of , as the UFC announced on March 5, 2011, that UFC 129 would be the first PPV to air live at . UFC Primetime returned to promote the St-Pierre/Shields title fight. On April 19, 2011, it was revealed that two of the preliminary bouts would air on a Facebook stream.

In these apparitions, the Virgin Mary appeared to her and identified herself as \\"the Tabernacle of the Most High.\\" Although veneration was not initially supported by the local bishop, the site became a popular destination for pilgrims, and in the 1990s was acknowledged by the diocese as a \\"place of prayer,\\" with organized pilgrimage actively promoted. It is one of the most popular pilgrim's sites in southern Africa. Sister Reinolda May Sister Reinolda May was born as Fraziska May on 21 October 1901 in Pfahlheim, a small village in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rottenburg-Stuttgart. She was baptized as Francisca, and went to a boarding school in Hochaltingen, where she was taught domestic science by Franciscan Sisters. She entered the local convent and became interested in the mission. Her parish priest, Fr. Eugene Adis, suggested she join the Benedictine Sisters of Tutzing, a missionary order, but this was disallowed on health grounds. She tried again and was accepted in 1922, and professed in 1925. She left for the mission in South Africa in 1925 and it was there that she pronounced her final vows in 1928. For ten years she worked in Mbongolwane in KwaZulu-Natal and at Inkamana Abbey. She learned Zulu and when the Sisters were allowed to assist in childbirth she began a study of midwifery, the first sister in Zululand to do so. She obtained her diploma in 1938 and in the same year opened the maternity section in the Benedictine Mission Hospital in Nongoma.Gelfand 210 From then on, Sister Reinolda became a popular and well-known figure in the district, earning a nickname from the local Zulus (Sister Mashiyane, on account of her bushy eyebrows). She led the section until the government takeover of the hospital in 1976. During her tenure, 28,000 births were registered there. After retiring, she continued to visit the sick and the dying in the hospital, and in 1980 was diagnosed with colon cancer.Sieber 599-605 She died at Inkamana on 1 April 1981, and is buried at Inkamana Abbey.\\"Ngome Marian Shrine\\" The apparitions Sr. Reinolda had a total of ten Marian visions, preceded by an unusual occurrence, on December 1954: she perceived two figures, a woman in white and a monk. The woman held something, covered, in her right hand; the monk held something like an offering. Something ascended like incense, then the figures disappeared. Eight months later, the visions of the Virgin began. #22 August 1955: right after receiving communion, the Virgin showed herself to her, stating she wished to be venerated as \\"the Tabernacle of the Most High\\" and encouraging Sr. Reinolda to tell her priest. #20 October 1955: similar to the first vision, but with the added injunction to tell everyone. #22 October 1955: similar to the second. #15 March 1956: the Virgin points in a north-westerly direction and asked that \\"a sanctuary be built at a place where seven springs well up and meet,\\" to allow for grace to flow and for people to be converted. #5 June 1956 #15 March 1957 #24 May 1957 #17 April 1958: during this vision she felt a need for a picture. Bishop Bilgeri of Eshowe consents to the painting of a picture according to Sr. Reinolda's instructions. #28 March 1970: she has an apparition of the devil, after which \\"Mary, the Tabernacle of the Most High\\" comforted her, and pointed to the archangel Michael, who stood on the other side with a lance, wearing a breast plate, and a cherubim in white standing next to him. #2 May 1971: the picture of the Tabernacle of the Most High came alive. History of the shrine In the fourth vision, the apparition had asked for a shrine to be built near the abbey at a place where seven streams meet. After the seventh vision, Sr. Reinolda became certain that it should be built at Ngome, and indeed wells were found in the forest near the Ngome school.Sieber 605-18. A chapel was built, and as it happened the site was also a place held sacred by the local Zulu population. It was consecrated at Pentecost 1966. The picture of \\"Our Lady the Tabernacle of the Most High\\" was placed in the chapel. Pilgrimage to the site began in March 1966, but soon afterward they were stopped by Bishop Bilgeri. From the first vision on, Sr. Reinolda shared her experiences with the local priests, who showed reluctance and referred her to the bishop, to whom she wrote a number of times in the next decade. He did not want the visions to be publicized, and while he consented to the painting and the small chapel he refused to have a bigger church built; he maintained this attitude until his death, in 1973. Popular veneration at the shrine continued unabated; people traveled from far and wide to pray at the chapel and collect water from the springs. A 1976 commission headed by two Benedictine priests decided that the use of Ngome as a site of pilgrimage would bring great benefits, and that pilgrimage and veneration (though not the use of the spring water) should be allowed. Then-Bishop Bisaye, however, would not allow organized pilgrimages. When Sr. Reinolda died, in 1981, interest again increased, and one local Catholic, Mrs. Rose-Marie Foxon, wrote the Vatican as well as other parishes in South Africa. People continued traveling privately, now in greater numbers, especially after Foxon also wrote to the local media speaking of the visions. In 1984 a new church was built at the site; it was dedicated to the Virgin Mary without any specific or additional titles. In 1988, the Ngome Shrine committee was formed from priests of the diocese. By that time, Bishop Bisaye was wavering, saying he could and would not suppress the veneration. In 1989, the committee published a booklet, and postcards featuring the shrine were being printed, and the cult played an ever-increasing role in the local church. Finally, in 1992, Bishop Bisaye blessed an open-air altar, part of a bigger chapel that replaced the little shrine, and allowed for the Marian Shrine to be designated a place of prayer, so that organized pilgrimage was now actively promoted. Since then, the priest at Inkamana Abbey is also the custodian for the shrine. There are reports of miraculous and spontaneous healing at the shrine, and comparisons with Lourdes are drawn.Harrison 68. The water from the spring is still collected, and visitors dip their feet in the water during prayer. Four nuns live at the shrine to help receive visitors; local women cook food for pilgrims, who in turn leave old clothes for the locals.\\"The Virgin Territory.\\" The shrine is one of the most popular Christian pilgrimage sites in Africa. Sister Reinolda May's apparitions were the first in a series of Marian visions in Africa; in the 1980s, visions of Mary were seen in Kenya, Zaire, Mozambique, South Africa, and Cameroon.Petrisko et al. 139-40.

Life restoration The type specimen, holotype HGM 41HIII-0106, preserves partial hips and hindlimbs, and was named and described in 2011. The team describing it, Xu et al., found it to represent a new taxon, which they gave the binomial Qiupalong henanensis. The genus name comes from the Qiupa Formation, where the specimen comes from, and the Chinese word long, meaning \\"dragon\\". The specific epithet is derived from the taxon's occurrence in the Henan Province. Qiupalong is from the late Late Cretaceous, based on the age of the Qiupa Formation. Qiupalong is the first definitive Asian ornithomimid from outside of the Gobi Desert and is the southernmost occurrence of Late Cretaceous Ornithomimidae from eastern Asia. Additional specimens, which include vertebrae, forelimbs, hips, hindlimbs, were later described in 2017 from the Belly River Group of Alberta, Canada.

The estate consists of a small house of Tudor/Georgian style, a garden of just under one acre in size,Price, p. 3 and many wooded acres. Located at the base of Mynydd Rhiw, the estate overlooks the beach of Porth Neigwl (Hells Mouth), Cardigan Bay, and the Llyn Peninsula. The history of the manor's estate predates construction of the house to some 4000 years of the neolithic period. After the house's construction in the early 17th century (an inscription of I.L. on a window lintel is dated 1634),Price, p. 2 the manor house witnessed many historical family saga, which finally ended in the 1940s when the three sisters donated it to the National Trust in memory of their parents, Constance and William Keating. Before that, they had refurbished the garden and restored the manor house to its old glory. The three sisters, who lived in the house until each of their deaths, are buried in a church yard near Porth Ysgo, about from their Plas yn Rhiw. Plas yn Rhiw is the only organic National Trust garden in Wales. The original garden was expanded by the trust to include of surrounding woodland. History =Ancient history= The family history of the owners of the Plas yn Rhiw is traced to tribes of some 4000 years old neolithic period who lived in its close vicinity. Celtic forts within of the manor house, of Middle Europe vintage, also testify to settlements to some 2000 years ago. Roman legionaries were stationed at Segontium (an outpost of the XXth Legion) near Caernarfon and their defence structures are corroborated by evidences near the 6th- century church of St Hywyn at Aberdaron. The location also witnessed intermarriage and family squabbles among the descendants of the Neolithic people, immigrants from Ireland and the Iberian Peninsula who had made their living here. The offspring of this generation of people are stated to be the modern Welsh families living in this area. =Medieval history= The Gwynedd Royal Dynasty had been established here around the 5th century after defeating the Irish settlers. In the 9th and 10th centuries, Irish settlers faced many invasions by the Vikings and many churches were destroyed. However, the Gwynedd kings vanquished many of the Viking invaders and also the Saxons (the English people). Rhodri the Great, the first king of all Wales, ruled in the 9th century, and his great grandson, Meirion Goch, is reported to have built a house close to the present manor house of Plas yn Rhiw. A conceptual version of the Plas yn Rhiw manor house has been interpreted as a 15th-century house having been built with thick stone walls and mud floors, covered with meadowsweet, found locally. Small, unglazed, sliced windows were covered with waxed cloth. There was a heavy main front door. Also conjectured were a main room with a circular staircase leading to a watch tower. A fireplace with chimney lead to the thatched roof . The house was surrounded by the common setting of a farmhouse with pigsties, barns stables and houses for farm labourers. A 16th-century \\"The Caernarfon Quarter Sessions Calendar\\" makes mention of the manor house as \\"Plas yn Rhiw\\" in the village of Rhiw. The residents of the manor house lived as respected gentry of the town, also participating in jury duty in the judicial system of the town. However, at that time, they did not have a traditional surname but were known by their father’s name. They eventually adopted the surname as Lewis, either suffixed or prefixed to their maiden name, for another 250 years and they were prosperous in the Welsh land. =Modern history= Plas-yn-Rhiw The house originally built by Meirion Goch in the 10th century to prevent incursions by Vikings into Porth Neigwl was rebuilt. A French window in the present house, which was remodelled in 1820, has an inscription dated 1634 and attributed to John Lewis, presumed to be the owner of the house at that time. His son, Richard Lewis, was married to Rector Richard Glynn's daughter. The hierarchy that followed consisted of two sons of Richard Lewis, the second son inheriting the property after his father's death, who lived with his wife Jane in the house. They had a daughter, also named Jane, who married William William and they had a son who was also named William William who was married to Mary Jones, the daughter of the Rector of Llaniestyn. They had only a daughter named Jane Ann who became the sole heiress of the property, in 1816. She married an army gentleman by the name of Lewis Moore Bennet. It was during this time that the house underwent further expansion. The Bennet's only child was also a daughter who became an heiress and married a very ambitious attorney, Cyril Williams, who was the son of the Rector of Llanbedrog. They had a son but the mother died soon after child birth. In 1846, Cyril Williams became the Mayor of Pwllheli but his ambitious plans to develop the place and to build a railway line from Worcester to Porth Dinllaen via Ludlow, Tremadog and Pwllheli, and then linking it to a ferry service to Ireland, did not come to fruition as he could not muster enough support for his plans in the House of Commons. Cyril Williams remarried and had many children. His daughter, Anne Elizabeth Williams, had in fact inscribed her name on a diamond ring and placed it on glass in one of the rooms on the first floor of the house, which is closed now. After Cyril William's death in 1859, his son William Lewis Williams, an army officer, inherited the property but he died a bachelor, and the house, along with the estate, was sold for £8000. The property was purchased by Thomas Edward Roberts of Hendre, Abererch, who lived in the manor house with his wife and children. But his son did not have interest to live in the house as he was residing in Harlech. He, therefore, released the house and the land to Lady Strickland of Sizergh Castle and Garden, Cumbria, who lived in the manor house for two summers. She was instrumental in fixing a modern bathtub in the house; it is now a water display item in the garden. After her, one of the daughters of Williams lived in the house for some time and then moved to Abergele in 1922. Then the house was deserted and remained untended till the Keating sisters bought it who, as children, had moved with their mother to Rhiw in 1904 and taken residence in a rented house. In 1939, the Keating sisters, Eileen, Lorna and Honora, along with their mother, Constance, who traced their ancestry to the original owners of the manor, purchased the manor house. They embarked on a serious refurbishing process in which they improved the garden setting, acquiring more land to enhance the environmental setting of the house and brought back the old glory of the manor. Buildings The walls, measuring a depth of in places, were constructed of large stones. A third storey was built as an extension to the old manor house built in the 17th century. A stair-wing was added to the rear. It was extended laterally, also. The front elevation, as well as the doors and windows were redesigned with a Georgian façade. Sixteen pane, sash windows, and an above ground floor verandah were added. There is a stone, spiral staircase. The house was restored by the Keating sisters in 1939, with advice from Clough Williams-Ellis, which included removal of the ca. 1816 Regency style stucco to reveal the original grey stone walls. Located on the grounds, and adjoining the manor home, a two-storey former gardener's cottage is available for rent. It has its own kitchen, sitting/dining room, fireplace, bedrooms, and a bathroom. There are several Grade II listed buildings on the estate, such as the cartshed which was listed in 1971, including the manor house and the detached cottage. There is also a summerhouse and a tool shed. An old mill next to a stream was granted Royal permission to grind its own corn. Grounds ;Garden Ruined watermill in the garden Set away from prevailing winds and benefiting from the microclimate, the garden lies below the house and is terraced into the slope, divided by hedges into several small compartments. There are native and cultivated plants in the garden. In spring and summer, there are displays of snowdrops and bluebells. Rhododendrons, azaleas, and magnolias are also part of the garden setting. The garden is accessible via grass paths and cobbled paths. Stone gateposts and seats, as well as old, unused buildings, and parterres are included in the landscaping. The parterre is referred to as Lady Strickland’s Garden. A slate plaque is situated outside the entrance to the garden and contains an epitaph. The earliest known planting plan was developed in 1966 by Mildred Eldridge, an artist and the wife of poet R. S. Thomas. This was followed in 1994 when an improved plan was drawn by the garden designed John Hubbard. Tim Walker, head gardener of the manor garden, boasts: \\"It's the only organic National Trust garden in Wales, and one of only three throughout England and Wales – although the other two, Trengwainton, near Penzance, and Snowshill Manor, in Gloucestershire, haven't got the same pedigree as Plas\\". ;Woodlands After the manor house, gardens and over 400 acres of countryside were given to the National Trust, the Trust added of surrounding woodland that includes a Snowdrop Wood (Oxalis magellanica).

Discovery and naming The German State Museum of Natural History Karlsruhe obtained a pterosaur fossil from an illegal commercial digger who had found it somewhere near Santana do Cariri in the Araripe Basin. The deposits it was recovered from likely belong to the Santana Formation of northeastern Brazil, which was dated by Martill to the latest Albian stage of the Cretaceous period. The specimen is catalogued as SMNK PAL 6597, and represents a partial skull consisting only the fused premaxillae and maxillae, some teeth and parts of the palate. The frontmost centimeter of the snout tip is missing. Due to the fragility of the specimen, the right side has undergone more preparation. In 2011, the specimen was named and described as the type species Unwindia trigonus by David Martill. The generic name honours the British pterosaur expert David Unwin. The specific name is derived from the Greek trigonos, \\"triangular\\", in reference to the triangular shape of the snout in cross-section. Description The preserved length of the snout fragment of Unwindia is . Martill estimated that the distance between the large opening in the skull side, the fenestra nasoantorbitalis, and the snout point had been . In 2013, Mark Witton estimated the total skull length at a minimum of , which would indicate a wingspan of over . Martill indicated two distinguishing traits. The first of these is an autapomorphy, or a unique specialization: there are seven pairs of teeth present, all of them placed in front of the nasoantorbital fenestra. The second trait sets Unwindia apart from all other pterosaurs known from the Santana Formation: the teeth are homodont, having the same shape. The other species have more robust teeth in the front of the jaws. Overall, the skull is elongated and flat. The teeth are long, straight, up to long, conical, and slightly transversely flattened. Classification Martill concluded that Unwindia was a basal ctenochasmatoid, though without a phylogenetic analysis. Witton in 2013 suggested that it could belong to the Lonchodectidae. This would make Unwindia the largest known member of the Lonchodectidae, as well as the first species of that group to be identified from the Southern Hemisphere.Witton, Mark P. (2013). Pterosaurs: Natural History, Evolution, Anatomy In 2020 however, Russian paleontologist Alexander Averianov suggested that Unwindia did not belong to the Lonchodectidae.

His Almack's Coffee House was bought in 1774 and became the gentlemen's club, Brooks's. Biography According to one account he was descended from a Yorkshire family of Quakers;Lower, Patronymica Britannica he came to London at an early age as the valet of the James Douglas-Hamilton, 5th Duke of Hamilton. Towards the middle of the eighteenth century Almack became proprietor of the Thatched House Tavern in St. James's Street. Before 1763 he opened a gaming-club in Pall Mall, which was known as Almack's Club, and from that date till his death he was the leading caterer for the amusement of the fashionable world of London. Among the twenty-seven original members of Almack's Club were the Duke of Portland and Charles James Fox, and it was subsequently joined by Edward Gibbon, William Pitt, and very many noblemen. Brooks's, one of London's most exclusive gentlemen's clubs, was founded in 1764 by 27 men, including four dukes. Its original premises in Pall Mall managed by the famous William Almack who also set up the iconic Almack's Assembly Rooms in nearby Duke Street. The club is named after Almack's successor Brooks, who only survived its rebuilding by three years. Almack's was noted for its high play, and Horace Walpole wrote of it in 1770: ‘The gaming of Almack's, which has taken the pas of White's, is worthy of the decline of our empire.’ The club passed subsequently into other hands, and still survives as ‘Brooks's.’ In 1764 Almack erected, from the designs of Milne, out of the profits acquired in his previous speculations, the large assembly-rooms in King Street, St. James's, by which he is chiefly known. They were opened on 20 February 1765, before they were quite completed; and at Almack's inaugural reception, among the visitors, who were not very numerous, were the Duke of Cumberland and Horace Walpole. The weather was bitterly cold, and Horace Walpole writes that, to induce his patrons to attend on the opening day, ‘Almack advertised that the new assembly-room was built with hot bricks and boiling water.’ Gilly Williams, in a letter descriptive of the ceremony addressed to George Selwyn, says: ‘Almack's Scotch face in a bagwig waiting at supper would divert you, as would his lady in a sack, making tea and curtseying to the duchesses.’ The success of the new rooms was rapidly assured. Under the direction of the leaders of London society, weekly subscription-balls were held there for more than seventy-five years during twelve weeks of each London season. The distribution of tickets, which were sold at ten guineas each, was in the hands of a committee of lady-patronesses—‘a feminine oligarchy less in number but equal in power to the Venetian Council of Ten’.Grantley Berkeley's Life and Recollections, i. 256–7 At the beginning of the nineteenth century admission to Almack's was described as ‘the seventh heaven of the fashionable world,’ and its high reputation did not decline before 1840. Many other clubs—including the Dilettanti Society and a club of both sexes on the model of that of White's—met at Almack's rooms soon after they were opened. Almack is said to have lived at Hounslow in his later years, and to have amassed great wealth. He died on 3 January 1781.Morning Chronicle, 6 Jan. 1781 The assembly-rooms he bequeathed to a niece, the wife of a Mr. Willis, after whom the rooms are now called. He married Elizabeth, elder daughter of William Cullen, of Sanches, Lanarkshire, who was waiting-maid to the Duchess of Hamilton, and sister of Dr. Cullen, the celebrated physician; Almack had by her two children, William, a barrister, who died on 27 October 1806, and Elizabeth, who married David Pitcairn, (N.B.

See also: AVCO Dealer News, Vol. 15, No. 10, October 1969, p. 5. Early Life and Teaching Career Born on March 1, 1859 in the small village of Kirchhundem, Germany. Oppenheim obtained a liberal education at universities in Bonn, Germany, and Innsbruck, Austria,“Joseph Oppenheim,” in Nevin O. Winter, Litt. D., History of Northwest Ohio, Vol. 3, p. 1671, The Lewis Publishing Company, Chicago & New York: 1917.. (accessed May 17, 2011). Photograph of Joseph Oppenheim appears after page 1670 (accessed May 17, 2011). and upon graduation from college at the age of 20 he immigrated to the United States. He received a teaching degree in 1881 from St. Francis College in Wisconsin and after briefly teaching in Putnam County, Ohio, he returned to St. Francis College for further study. On August 9, 1883 he married Anna Mary Ellerbrock of Glandorf, Ohio.Cindy Birt, “New Idea: Its Start and the First 75 Years,” The Celina, Ohio Daily Standard, May 16, 1974, p. 18. He then taught in Freyburg, Ohio, New Albany, Indiana, and Grand Rapids, Michigan, before settling in the small town of Maria Stein, Ohio.“Joseph Oppenheim Would Be 100 Sunday,” Mercer County Chronicle-Journal, February 26, 1959, page 1 Oppenheim was “an accomplished musician, specializing in piano and pipe organ, ... a remarkable scholar, conversant with four languages, well read in literature, and an excellent speaker.”Winter, History of Northwest Ohio, Vol. 3, p. 1671 As an educator, Oppenheim became the first teacher in Ohio to receive a Lifetime State Teachers Certificate.Mercer County Notables website, http://billwendel.com/history/index.htm (accessed, Nov. 9, 2010) Educator Turns Inventor In the 1890s, Oppenheim was a schoolmaster in the one-room country schoolhouse in Maria Stein, the town where John M. Kramer was building a “manure unloader” based on a patent in his name but claimed to be jointly owned by him, Fred Heckman and Henry Synck.Fred Heckman, “Early Manure Spreader History: Particularly of New Idea,” Pamphlet, Coldwater, Ohio, July, 1939, p. 4, “the patent for the manure distributor was issued in Kramer’s name although I always thought Henry Synck and I would own the Patent when granted, but Kramer also signed the application, and he had not done anything...but he may have had a right because it was worked out in his shop, so we were with three in this Patent.” quoted in Birt, “New Idea and Its Start ...” at p. 19. See also: Knapp, “More than one person invented the Manure Spreader,” Mercer County Chronicle, July 22, 1999, p. 1 indicating that the Kramer’s device was known as a “manure unloader” with photograph of “unloader” on p. 2. The “more than one person” Knapp (obviously tongue-in-cheek) refers to is Oppenheim’s widow who, after Joseph’s death, received his second New Idea spreader patent as his “executor.” Originally manure was thrown from a wagon.Birt, “New Idea: Its Start…” page 19 column 3; See also: “Three Generations, The Story of New Idea” “Our 60th Year,” Pamphlet, Coldwater, Ohio 1959, pp 1 &2. The unloader that Kramer built used a drag chain at the bottom of the wagon to pull the load of manure to the rear where it was shredded by a pair of beaters and deposited directly behind the machine, but with very little spreading to the sides.Tharran E. Gaines, “100 Years of New Ideas,” FieldHAND, Spring 1999, p. 8; See also: Birt, “New Idea: Its Start…” p. 18. As a result, farmers still had to take the time-consuming step of heading into the fields with peg-tooth drags or similar implements to spread the manure in order to prevent burning the soil.Brian Wayne Wells, “The New Idea Spreader Company of Coldwater, Ohio,” (Part 1 of 2 Parts), Belt/Pulley Magazine, Vol. 11, No. 5, September/October 1998, (accessed Nov. 8, 2010) As a schoolmaster, Oppenheim was concerned that the older boys often missed class at certain times of the year to stay home and work on the farm, usually loading and spreading manure. Not only was the chore backbreaking, but it deprived them of their education which Oppenheim saw as a need for the future.“100th Anniversary, A Century of Excellence, New Idea 1899-1999,” Pamphlet, AGCO Corporation 1999, p. 3. See also: B.C. Oppenheim, “My Father’s Help to the Farmer,” ‘’The Country Gentleman,’’ Vol LXXXII, Issue 42, Page 31, Nov. 17, 1917, at (accessed May 17, 2011) While watching children play a game called \\"tom ball,\\" Oppenheim noticed that when the ball was struck with the bat, which was actually a paddle-shaped board, the ball was deflected to one side or the other, depending on the angle of the paddle.“100th Anniversary, A Century of Excellence, New Idea 1899-1999,” Pamphlet, AGCO Corporation 1999, p. 3 Oppenheim saw this paddle-effect as the solution to the problem of manure spreading. He felt that a series of paddles could be attached to the rear of a manure unloader to cast manure in a wide pattern several times the width of the wagon.Wells, “The New Idea Spreader Company … Part 1”. Nearly all other documents referenced herein contain the same story. To test his theory, Joseph, with the help of his oldest son, B.C. Oppenheim, knocked the end out of a cigar box and built a small rotary paddle distributor into that open end. Each of the paddles on the rotary distributor was set at a different angle. Then, Joseph and his son filled the cigar box with chaff and operated the small distributor with power from the drive wheel of a sewing machine. The test was successful. The chaff was thrown in a wide pattern. After several other tests, Oppenheim became convinced that he had an idea that could be designed into manure unloaders.Wells, “The New Idea Spreader Company … Part 1” When Kramer's machine shop was destroyed by fire and his business failed, Oppenheim obtained Kramer's patent in exchange for forgiving a loan he had made to KramerBirt, “New Idea: Its Start…” p. 18 and then obtained a patent for his own new idea.U.S. Patent Office, Patent No. 648,519, Manure Distributor and Spreader for Joseph Oppenheim, Maria Stein, Ohio, Filed February 17, 1900. See also,”Avco New Idea Marks 70th Anniversary,” Avco New Idea Dealer News. Vol 15, No. 10, October 1969, p. 2. Thus the widespread modern manure spreader was born.Wells, “The New Idea Spreader Company … Part1” Oppenheim’s New Idea manure spreader Oppenheim's first New Idea spreader had two beaters. The top beater was situated immediately above the lower beater and was smaller because pulverizing of the top part of the load was easier than the bottom. Immediately behind the beaters was the famous New Idea “widespread” which had a steel axle with several wooden paddles attached to it.Wells, “The New Idea Spreader Company… Part 1\\". The paddles were six inches wide and eight inches long, fastened to the shaft at an angle to throw the manure outward.”Birt, “New Idea; Its Start:...” p. 19. On October 18, 1899, Oppenheim broke ground for a small shop in Maria Stein, Ohio, where he could produce his new manure spreader, incorporating the “widespread” paddle device in addition to two beaters.For photographs of Oppenheim’s “widespread” new idea see: “New Idea Celebrates 100th Anniversary,” Mercer County Chronicle, September 2–8, 1999, p. 9; See also: “100th Anniversary, A Century of Excellence, New Idea 1899-1999,” Pamphlet, AGCO Corporation, pp. 1,3 and 4. (Compare with Kramer “manure unloader” in Knapp, “More Than One Person…”.). For additional pictures of the original New Idea Spreader see the company’s advertisement in a 1918 Country Gentleman Magazine containing a guarantee by B.C.

Among the first employees he hired at the shop were Fred Heckman and Henry Synck.Birt, “New Idea: Its Start….” p. 18. Synck, who later married one of Joseph's daughters, Wilhelmina,Birt, “New Idea: Its Start....” p. 18 was said by contemporaries to have had “a genius for machinery and mechanics of all kinds.” and “in 1899 he entered the employ of Oppenheim and gradually familiarized himself with the technique of the business.”.“Henry Synck,”in Nevin O. Winter, Litt.D., History of Northwest Ohio, vol. 2, p. 824, at (accessed May 17, 2011). Although Synck had been “employed by Kramer Brothers at low wages, he secured experience that was invaluable to him in later years...and in 1899, he entered the employ of Mr. Joseph Oppenheim of Maria Stein, and gradually familiarized himself with the technique of the business until he became one of the heads of the New Idea Spreader Company.” Neighbors around the town of Maria Stein started referring to the widespread manure spreaders as “Oppenheim’s new idea” and Joseph adopted this as the name for the business.Birt, “New Idea: Its Start…” p. 18.The original name of the company was “The New Idea Spreader Works.” See also: B.C. Oppenheim, “My Father’s Help to the Farmer,” ‘’The Country Gentleman.’’ Vol LXXXII, Issue 42, Page 31, Nov. 17, 1917, at (accessed May 17, 2011) Only two manure spreaders were produced the first year of operation and fourteen the following year.”Avco New Idea Marks 70th Anniversary,” Avco New Idea Dealer News, Vol 15, No. 10, October 1969, p. 4. Oppenheim did not live long enough to realize any financial reward, for he died on November 24, 1901 as one of the victims of typhoid fever that struck the small village.”Avco New Idea Marks 70th Anniversary,” p. 2. But his wife, Anna Mary, carried on operations of the New Idea Spreader Works by using the money obtained from Joseph's insurance policy.”The New Idea Spreader Company,”in Nevin O. Winter, Litt.D., History of Northwest Ohio, vol. 3, p. 1673, at (accessed May 17, 2011). states “At [Oppenheim’s] death his widow [Anna Mary Oppenheim, b. 1861, d. 1907] received $3000 life insurance and she courageously placed this amount at the disposal of the business. It was a remarkable instance of business courage on the part of a woman who had no other source of income. The results justified her confidence. At her death in 1907 the business was continued by her six children....” See also: B.C.

Oppenheim, became the president in place of his father and Henry Synck was in charge of production.“Bernard C. Oppenheim,” in Nevin O.

Also see: \\"New Idea Spreader Company,\\" in Winter, ‘’History of Northwest Ohio,’’ Vol 3, p. 1672. at (accessed May 17, 2011) stating, “The New Idea spreader ... is radically different in construction from others which had been in use prior thereto. Its special feature is that it is a “widespread” machine. At first it inevitably encountered prejudice...because ...it was so completely different from the machines farmers had been accustomed to. However, the New Idea spreader demonstrated its capacity for better work, and ...soon... became dominant and competitors were obliged to change their machines or cease business altogether.” In 1902 a new model spreader was introduced not only with a greatly reduced draft to lighten the burden on horses, but also with the upper beater moved slightly forward adding to the efficiency of both beaters.Wells, “The New Idea Spreader Company … Part 1”; U.S. Patent Office, Patent No. 712,581 Manure Spreader for Anna Mary Oppenheim, Executor, Maria Stein, Ohio, Filed Nov. 4. 1902. Rapid Growth of The New Idea Company In 1904 the company changed its name to the New Idea Spreader Company“New Idea Development,” Celina Daily Standard, August 27, 1999, page 7A, Sidebar. and demand for its manure spreaders increased steadily until it soon outgrew its first little shop. On July 1, 1907, the New Idea Spreader Company, while maintaining operations at Maria Stein, opened a factory in nearby Coldwater, Ohio”Three Generations: The Story of New Idea.

Bradshaw was born in London in August 1801. Her maiden name was Tree, and her father, who lived in Lancaster Buildings, St. Martin's Lane, was in the East India House. After a training in the chorus at Drury Lane Theatre, and a short experience in Bath, she appeared in 1818 at Covent Garden Theatre as Rosina in 'The Barber of Seville.' Subsequently she played, principally as a substitute for Miss Foote or Miss Stephens, Patty in 'The Maid of the Mill,' Susannah in 'The Marriage of Figaro,' and other similar characters. Her first recorded appearance in an original role seems to have been as Princess Stella in the 'Gnome King,' a spectacular piece produced on 6 October 1819 at Covent Garden. On 11 December of the same year she appeared as Luciana in an opera founded by Reynolds on 'The Comedy of Errors.' This led to the series of Shakespearean performances on which her fame rests. In various renderings, musical and otherwise, of Shakespearean comedy, she played with success Ariel, Viola, Imogen, Julia (in the 'Two Gentlemen of Verona'), Ophelia, and Rosalind. With the exception of a solitary appearance at Drury Lane in April 1823, when she was lent by her own management, she appears to have remained at Covent Garden till her retirement. This took place on 15 June 1825 in two of her original characters, Mary Coppin 'Charles II,' by Howard Payne, and Clari in the opera of that name, by the same author. Shortly afterwards she married, under passably romantic circumstances, and after, it is said, an attempt at suicide, James Bradshaw, a man of property, they had a daughter, Harriet Maria. She died on 18 February 1862. Of medium stature and pleasing figure, and with no special claim to beauty, she owed her popularity to the pathos in her voice. Though inferior to her singing, her acting won commendation. She was much praised for the modesty of her performance in male attire. Her sister, Ellen Tree, became the wife of Mr. Charles Kean.

She dedicated her book to her pupils. The lectures of which the book consisted had been praised by Charles Hutton, then at Royal Military Academy, Woolwich.Preface, p. xi An octavo edition of the work was issued later.

Description G. lacustris is semi-transparent and lacks a webbed tail. It may be colorless, brown, reddish or bluish in color, depending on the local environment. It has seven abdominal segments, a fused cephalothorax, and two pairs of antennae. Unlike other crustaceans, amphipods lack carapaces and have laterally compressed bodies. Gammarids are referred to as scuds or sideswimmers. G. lacustris resembles a freshwater shrimp. Life cycle The female carries eggs in a brood pouch on its ventral side. G. lacustris in higher elevations were more likely to have fewer but larger eggs than those living at lower elevations. G. lacustris undergoes several molts and juveniles resemble the adult. Ecology G. lacustris plays an important role in many of the freshwater ecosystems that it inhabits. It is a detritivore and may also consume algae, mainly diatoms. It is considered an indicator species for the overall health and stability of the ecosystem. G. lacustris can also inhabit a wide array of environments, ranging from low altitude calcium-rich lakes to high altitude, cold, and calcium-poor lakes. This influences its biology: at low altitudes, it is known to die after first reproduction, but in colder waters, it lives to reproduce repeatedly. {cite journal last1=Østbye first1=Kjartan last2=Østbye first2=Eivind last3=Lien first3=Anne May last4=Lee first4=Laura R. last5=Lauritzen first5=Stein-Erik last6=Carlini first6=David B. title=Morphology and life history divergence in cave and surface populations of Gammarus lacustris (L.) journal=PLOS ONE date=25 October 2018 volume=13 issue=10 pages=e0205556 doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0205556 url=https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0205556 accessdate=15 October 2020}} =Temperature= In many species feeding behaviour is affected by temperature, i.e. the amount of food consumed often increases at warmer temperatures . However, when G. lacustris feeds on three different parasite species (Diplostomum spp., Apatemon spp. and Trichobilharzia spp.) no such effect of temperature on feeding is seen . =Parasites= As a small aquatic invertebrate G. lacustris is an important food source for many organisms. Birds, fishes, and some insects are known to prey upon G. lacustris. As many other species of small invertebrates, it serves as an intermediate host for several parasite species (e.g. Pomphorhynchus laevis). G. lacustris typically shows photophobic behaviour, but when parasitized this can be altered to photophilic behaviour when infected by Pomphorhynchus laevis. Which is a host manipulation parasite, like many others. Parasites can affect the diel migration of G. lacustris, making it more visible and susceptible to predation most likely aiding parasite transmission. More mature parasites have greater effects on hosts. Distribution G. lacustris has been noted in northwestern Europe, Russia, and North America. Its precise range has yet to be defined. It can be found in shallow or deep lakes and in slow-moving rivers. It is more abundant in fishless lakes than in those with fish. Its distribution follows the thermocline in the water.

Contents Tall Tales of the Wee Folk is a Creature Crucible supplement that describes the society and background of creatures such as brownies, sprites, dryads, leprechauns, centaurs, pixies, fauns, hsiao, pookas, sidhe, treants, wood imps, and woodrakes, and outlines rules for playing them as player characters (PCs). It also details rules for special woodland magic. Tall Tales of the Wee Folk describes the woodland realm of the Dreamland, which is ruled by the fairy king, Oberon. The Dreamland is home to many creatures drawn from diverse mythological sources, from Celtic sidhe to ancient Greek centaurs and fauns. Other creatures covered include the hsiao (large, intelligent owls) and pookas (shape-changing pranksters). Each of the races is introduced and described by game characters who detail how the races live, what they look like, how they dress, and their cultural outlooks and aspirations; this is followed by game-orientated information that lists experience levels and relevant special abilities. Creatures in PC1 start the game with negative experience points, with balanced relative experience-level costs such that no race is more powerful than another. The adventure book features six short one or two page adventures covering levels 1–26, and a longer fifteen page adventure titled \\"The Lost Seneschal,\\" which is for 1st-3rd level characters. Publication history PC1 Tall Tales of the Wee Folk was written by John Nephew and published by TSR in 1989 as a sixty-four page book with an outer folder. The package also includes a thirty-two page adventure booklet, and features editing by Gary L. Thomas, a cover illustration by Keith Parkinson, and interior illustrations by Valerie Valusek. Reception Ken Rolston briefly reviewed Tall Tales of the Wee Folk for Dragon magazine No. 154 (February 1990). Rolston called the book a \\"well- written and imaginative D&D; supplement\\" and concludes that \\"The treatments of these beings as PCs are remarkably faithful to the tone and dignity of their fairy sources, and the adventures featuring these character types are original and satisfying. This supplement is highly recommended for D&D; and AD&D; game players and may be a pleasant surprise for any sophisticated role-players interested in the traditions and legends of fairie.\\" Jim Bambra reviewed Tall Tales of the Wee Folk for Dragon magazine No. 164 (December 1990). Bambra noted that although the blending of mythology from cultures such as Celtic and ancient Greek \\"is keeping with the eclectic background of the D&D; game, it tends to blur differences between the two cultures, detracting from the overall cohesiveness of the product\\". He felt that \\"Each race is neatly handled, and players are given plenty of good role-playing hooks. Occasionally the text lapses into game terminology in the middle of character speech, and that jars the narrative.\\" He complimented the background information on the forest realm, calling it \\"useful and contains some very nice touches, such as the way the Fairy Court holds its meetings using a timestop spell\\". Bambra found the fact that player characters start the game with negative experience points to be uninspiring, especially compared to the design guidelines set out in The Orcs of Thar, where large and powerful creatures, such as trolls and ogres, start off as young members of their race who have to work their way up to normal monster level: \\"A bit of time and effort taken here would have improved this product tremendously and helped to have pushed the game mechanics into the background.\\" He found other design problems in the product, such as races making saving rolls as character classes of the same level—a problem for a creature that has not achieved 1st level—and how creatures fight according to their number of hit dice, but no indication is given on how to handle the combat abilities of high-level creatures who no longer gain hit dice. He felt that PC1 is much better with handling the well balanced relative experience-level costs, with no race being more powerful than another, and liked that the new fairy spells \\"give a distinct flavor to these whimsical and fun creatures\\", and felt that \\"there's plenty of scope for humorous role- playing, particularly with the pooka and faun\\". Bambra concludes with this evaluation: Tall Tales of the Wee Folk contains some very good ideas, particularly in its background sections. But it fails to live up to the very high standards set by The Orcs of Thar. It does a good job of introducing us to the woodland creatures and expanding on the information contained in the rulebooks, but suffers from a number of minor design problems. Even given these, Tall Tales of the Wee Folk is a fine product.\\" References External links *Review in Games International Dungeons & Dragons books Mystara ","title":"Tall Tales of the Wee Folk"},{"id":"30078826","text":"Top Ballista is an accessory for the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game. Contents Top Ballista is a Creature Crucible supplement and campaign setting that describes Serraine, city of the magical biplane-flying skygnomes. The supplement includes rules for player characters (PCs) for races such as skygnomes, gremlins, pegataurs, and harpies, as well as new air-combat rules. The aerial city of Serraine flies over the Known World carrying its skygnome inhabitants, creators of bizarre yet workable inventions. The book describes the flying aces of the Top Ballista squadrons, gnomes who pilot flying machines, World War I style fighter planes, equipped with lightning guns and synchronized crossbows. Creatures featured in the product, all living in Serraine, are faenare (birdmen able to create spell-like effects through songs), gnomes, gremlins, harpies, nagpa (vulture-headed humanoids), pegataurs (winged centaurs), sphinxes, and tabi (catlike creatures). Each of these races is introduced by a character who describes their cultures, evolution, and lifestyles. Some creatures start with negative experience points totals when used as PCs. There are three adventures for characters of various experience point levels. The first contains a basilisk that must be defeated by the PCs. The longest adventure is for characters of levels 7–11, and is set within the flying city. The opening stages require a fair bit of detective work from the PCs, and after the investigation in the city, the PCs chase the villain through the air in one of the planes. Publication history PC2 Top Ballista was written by Carl Sargent and published by TSR in 1989.

Editing was by Paul Jaquays, with cover and interior illustrations by John Lakey. Reception Jim Bambra reviewed Top Ballista for Dragon magazine #164 (December 1990). He felt that the text describing the races of Serraine is \\"presented in a cheerful and illuminating manner that captures the flavor of the city and its inhabitants nicely\\". Bambra examined the product's game mechanics and found numerous flaws which \\"ruin what is in many ways a fine product\\", with the mechanics \\"showing signs of not having been designed or edited very thoroughly\\", and while he felt that some areas are \\"markedly better than others\\", Bambra concluded that \\"I found enough mistakes and poorly considered areas to give me cause for concern\\". He pointed out the poorly balanced character level advancement (with nagpa and sphinx PCs in particular progressing very slowly compared to other characters), inconsistencies between tables and references in the text, redundant charm abilities for harpies, and other problems. Despite this, he felt the sky gnomes and their ability to build machines using fantasy physics are handled well, called the faenare \\"a finely detailed race with nifty powers\\", complimented the city as \\"neatly described\\", and said, \\"the plane rules look like they'll work\\". He felt that the visual presentation is of high quality, calling the illustrations of the four planes \\"excellent\\", and noting that the interior artwork \\"captures the humorous flavor of the product well\\", although he added that some of the races had no illustrations, pointing out that the single nagpa illustration is not near its entry. Bambra concluded by saying: \\"Top Ballista suffers from a large number of design flaws, which is a pity as it has some great ideas and well-written descriptive passages. The background sections are generally very good, making it a fun and unusual adventure setting. Viewed as a source of background information, Top Ballista is useful, but its failure to provide balanced PC creatures weakens it greatly.

The book was listed in the \\"All-Time 100 Nonfiction Books\\" (the 100 most influential books of the last century) by Time magazine in 2011. His 2016 book The Gene: An Intimate History made it to #1 on The New York Times Best Seller list, and was among The New York Times 100 best books of 2016, and a finalist for the Wellcome Trust Prize and the Royal Society Prize for Science Books. After completing school education in India, Mukherjee studied biology at Stanford University, obtained a D.Phil. from University of Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, and an M.D. from Harvard University. He joined NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital / Columbia University Medical Center in New York City in 2009. As of 2018, he is an Associate Professor of Medicine in the Division of Hematology and Oncology. Featured in the Time 100 list of most influential people, Mukherjee writes for The New Yorker and is a columnist in The New York Times. He is described as part of a select group of doctor-writers (such as Oliver Sacks and Atul Gawande) who have \\"transformed the public discourse on human health\\", and allowed a generation of readers a rare and intimate glimpse into the life of science and medicine. His research concerns the physiology of cancer cells, immunological therapy for blood cancers, and the discovery of bone- and cartilage-forming stem cells in the vertebrate skeleton. The Government of India conferred on him its fourth highest civilian award, the Padma Shri, in 2014.  Early life and education  Siddhartha Mukherjee was born to a Bengali family in New Delhi, India. His father, Sibeswar Mukherjee, was an executive with Mitsubishi, and his mother Chandana Mukherjee, was a former school teacher from Calcutta (now Kolkata). He attended St. Columba's School in Delhi, where he won the school's highest award, the 'Sword of Honour', in 1989. As a biology major at Stanford University, he worked in Nobel Laureate Paul Berg's laboratory, defining cellular genes that change the behaviours of cancer cells. He earned membership in Phi Beta Kappahttp://phibetakappa.tumblr.com/post/163177576378/the-gene-by-siddhartha- mukherjee in 1992, and completed his Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in 1993. Mukherjee won a Rhodes Scholarship for doctoral research at Magdalen College, University of Oxford. He worked on the mechanism of activation of the immune system by viral antigens. He was awarded a D.Phil. in 1997 for his thesis titled The processing and presentation of viral antigens. After graduation, he attended Harvard Medical School, where he earned his Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) degree in 2000. Between 2000 and 2003 he worked as a resident in internal medicine at the Massachusetts General Hospital. From 2003 to 2006 he trained in oncology as a Fellow at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (under Harvard Medical School) in Boston, Massachusetts.  Career  In 2009, Mukherjee joined the faculty of the Department of Medicine in the Division of Hematology/Oncology at the Columbia University Medical Center as an Assistant Professor. The medical center is attached to the NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital in New York City. He was previously affiliated with the Harvard Stem Cell Institute and with Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He has worked as the Plummer Visiting Professor at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, the Joseph Garland lecturer at the Massachusetts Medical Society, and an honorary visiting professor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. His laboratory is based at Columbia University's Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center. Contributions =Cancer research= Mukherjee is a trained haematologist and oncologist whose research focuses on the links between normal stem cells and cancer cells. Through his findings, he had shown the roles of cells in cancer therapy. He has been investigating the microenvironment (\\"niche\\") of stem cells, particularly on blood-forming (haematopoietic) stem cells. Blood- forming stem cells are present in the bone marrow in very specific microenvironments. Osteoblasts, cells that form bone, are one of the principal components in this environment. These cells regulate the process of blood cell formation and development by providing them with signals to divide, remain quiescent, or maintain their stem cell properties. Distortion in the development of these cells results in severe blood cancers, such as myelodysplastic syndrome and leukemia. Mukherjee's research has been recognised through many grants from the National Institutes of Health and from private foundations. Mukherjee and his co-workers have identified several genes and chemicals that can alter the microenvironment, or niche, and thereby alter the behavior of normal stem cells, as well as cancer cells. Two such chemicals – proteasome inhibitors and activin inhibitors – are under clinical trials. Mukerjee's lab has also identified novel genetic mutations in myelodysplasia and acute myelogenous leukaemia and has played a leading role in finding therapies for these diseases. =Bone formation= Mukherjee's team is also known for defining and characterizing skeletal stem/progenitor cells (also called osteochondroreticular or OCR cells). In 2015, they prospectively identified these progenitor cells from bone, and showed, using lineage tracing, that these cells can give rise to bone, cartilage, and reticular cells (hence the term \\"OCR\\" cells). They established that these cells form a part of the adult skeleton in vertebrates, and that they maintain and repair the skeleton. OCR cells are among the newest progenitor cells to be defined in vertebrates. The work generated wide interest and was described in prominent journals as a major breakthrough for understanding biology and for understanding diseases such as osteoporosis and osteoarthritis. Mukherjee's team have shown that OCR cells can be transplanted into animals, and they can regenerate cartilage and bone after fractures. With Daniel L. Worthley's team at the University of Adelaide and South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute they have been working on the translational cell-based research on osteoarthritis and cancer. =Metabolic therapies for cancer= Mukherjee's lab has also been investigating the interaction between cancer genetics and the microenvironment, including the metabolic environment. It has been well established that metabolism in cancer is fundamentally altered, Mukherjee's team has found the role of a high-fat, adequate-protein, low-carbohydrate diet (ketogenic diet) in cancer therapy. They showed that ketogenic diet suppressed insulin production in the body, and this in turn enhances pharmaceutical inhibition of PIK3CA, a gene which is mutated and commonly overactive in cancers. =Immune therapies for acute leukemia= Mukherjee's lab, with the help of PureTech Health plc, has been investigating chimeric antigen receptor redirected T cells (CAR-T) therapy in a joint venture called Vor BioPharma since 2016. They have combined CAR-T therapies with genetically modified hematopoietic stem cells to specifically target malignant hematopoietic lineages, while transplanted stem cells replenish the lineage but remain antigenically concealed. This technology has been developed so that, in addition to B cell malignancies, other lineage specific cancers could be targeted. This provides an important new approach to managing acute myeloid leukemia. Books In 2010, Simon & Schuster published his book The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer detailing the evolution of diagnosis and treatment of human cancers from ancient Egypt to the latest developments in chemotherapy and targeted therapy. On 18 April 2011, the book won the annual Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction; the citation called it \\"an elegant inquiry, at once clinical and personal, into the long history of an insidious disease that, despite treatment breakthroughs, still bedevils medical science.\\"\\"The 2011 Pulitzer Prize Winners: General Non-Fiction\\". The Pulitzer Prizes. Retrieved 12 November 2013. It was listed in the \\"All-Time 100 Nonfiction Books\\" (the 100 most influential books of the last century) and the \\"Top 10 Nonfiction Books of 2010\\" by Time in 2011. It was also listed in \\"The 10 Best Books of 2010\\" by The New York Times and \\"Top 10 Books of 2010\\" by O, The Oprah Magazine. In 2011, it was nominated as a National Book Critics Circle Award finalist. Based on the book, Ken Burns made a PBS Television documentary film Cancer: The Emperor of All Maladies in 2015, which was nominated for an Emmy Award. Mukherjee's 2016 book The Gene: An Intimate History provides a history of genetic research, but also delves into the personal genetic history of the author's family, including mental illness. The book discusses the power of genetics in determining people's health and attributes, but it also has a cautionary tone to not let genetic predispositions define fate, a mentality that led to the rise of eugenics in history and something he thinks lacks the nuance required to understand something as complex as human beings. The Gene was shortlisted for the Royal Society Insight Investment Science Book Prize 2016, \\"the Nobel prize of science writing\\". The book was also the recipient of the 2017 Phi Beta Kappa Society Book Award in Science. =Criticism and response= In his 2016 article 'Same but different' in The New Yorker, Mukherjee attributed the most important genetic functions to epigenetic factors (such as histone modification and DNA methylation). Giving an analogy of his mother and her twin sister, he explains: The article, an excerpt from the chapter \\"The First Derivative of Identity\\" of his book The Gene: An Intimate History, was critiqued by geneticists such as Mark Ptashne, at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and John Greally, at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, because of over emphasis on histone modification and DNA methylation, while overlooking other important factors. They commented that these two processes have only minor influences in overall gene function. Steven Henikoff, at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, opined that, \\"Mukherjee seemed not to realize that transcription factors occupy the top of the hierarchy of epigenetic information,\\" and said, \\"histone modifications at most act as cogs in the machinery.\\" It is now generally believed that histone modification and DNA methylations are major factors of epigenetic functions, aging and certain diseases, and with an ability to influence transcription factors. However, they contribute little to development. In response, Mukherjee did admit that omission of transcription factors \\"was an error\\" on his part. Mukherjee also criticises the IQ test as a measure of intelligence, and endorses the theory of multiple intelligences (introduced by Howard Gardner) over general intelligence. He argues that the results of IQ tests for determining general intelligence do not represent intelligence in the real world. Reviewing the book in The Spectator, Stuart Ritchie, a psychologist at the University of Edinburgh, remarked that Gardner's theory is \\"debunked\\" and that \\"general intelligence is probably the most well-replicated phenomenon in all of psychological science.\\" Mukherjee also wrongly stated that \\"classical Darwinian evolution is that genes do not retain an organism's experiences in a permanently heritable manner... Darwin discredited that model [of Lamarck].\\" But Darwin had no idea of the gene—the concept of which was established only in the 20th century. Science writer Razib Khan noted this erroneous conception, and explained that \\"Darwin worked in the pre-genetic era... he himself was quite open to Lamarckianism in some cases.\\" List of books published * 2010: The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer (). * 2015: The Laws of Medicine: Field Notes from an Uncertain Science ().Siddhartha Mukherjee, The Laws of Medicine: Field Notes from an Uncertain Science, Simon & Schuster, 2015 (page visited on 10 December 2015). * 2016: The Gene: An Intimate History ().James Gleick, \\"The Gene, by Siddhartha Mukherjee, York Times May 15, 2016 review Awards and honours Siddhartha Mukherjee receiving Padma Shri Award from Pranab Mukherjee, President of India, at Rashtrapati Bhavan in New Delhi on 26 April 2014.

Born in Finchley, England and raised in Sussex Weald, Stirling attended Bishop's Stortford College and the University of London. After a brief period of general practice, Stirling joined the Universities' Mission to Central Africa and was deployed to Tanzania. He spent 14 years of service to the UMCA in Lulindi. He then converted to Catholicism and joined the Benedictine Mission, working with them in Mnero, where he built another hospital. After 15 years he left to Kibosho, on the slopes of the Kilimanjaro, where he worked for 5 more years. During his medical missionary career, he emphasised the training of local nurses, establishing a precedent for official nurse recognition in Tanzania. His experience in Africa eventually led him to the political career, and in 1958 Leader Stirling was elected (unopposed) to the first Parliament of Tanzania. He held this position for the next 22 years,Stirling, Leader. \\"Africa: My Surgery\\". Churchman Publishing: Worthing and Folkestone, 1987. being the last 5 as Health Minister by appointment of Julius Nyerere.Stirling, Leader. \\"Tanzanian Doctor\\". McGill-Queen's University Press, Montreal, 1977. Besides his medical and political work, Stirling was also interested in Scouting. His successful efforts to establish a Scout movement in Tanzania eventually led him to the post of Chief Scout of Tanzania in 1962, following the formation of the Republic. Early life: 1906–1929 Leader Stirling was born in England in 1906, the first of 4 siblings. His was of a family of ancient Scots and also of doctors, including his uncle Harold Leader, who was a children’s physician, his great-uncles Henry Pye-Smith and Rutherford Pye- Smith, and the cousins Charles Pye-Smith, a surgeon, and Jack Pye-Smith, all Physicians of the Guy’s Hospital. He was also cousin of David Stirling founder of the Special Air Service. The surgical talent seemed to have blossomed in him at early age, when, in 1911, Stirling surprised his mother after she saw him sewing a ripped teddy bear. Although having encouragement by his family and even a natural curiosity, the choice for the medical career was only taken in his last year at the Bishop's Stortford College, where his Headmaster received the news as a \\"startling new development\\". Decided, he applied for scholarships on Oxford and Cambridge but was not accepted. He then joined the University of London in 1924 and chose the London Hospital as his medical school. He borrowed £1,000 from his father to pay his studies, money he was later able to pay back.\\"Plarr's Lives of the Fellows Online\\", 26 October 2005, accessed 14 December 2013 =Medical training: 1924–1929= The 5 year medical course consisted of 1 year of pre-medical studies at the East London College, now Queen Mary College, where he basically studied zoology. During his first year he was also a surgical dresser in the London Hospital when he had his first hands-on experiences with medical practice. In 1925 he began his second year of medical school, now studying at the London Hospital, which was followed by 3 years of clinical course. He graduated from medical school on July 1929, qualifying MRCS and LRCT in the same year.Stirling, Leader. \\"Heroes of the Faith in Tanzania; Seven witnesses from the Central African Mission\\". Benedictine Publications Ndanda-Peramiho, 1997. He graduated MBBS, and later, in 1993, was elected FRCS, a very honourable and rare happening. Early career: 1929–1935 Dr. Leader Stirling's first job was as a Clinical Assistant in the Children’s Out Patient Department at the London Hospital. After 3 months he got another position as a Clinical Assistant to Surgical Out-patients at that same institution for 3 more months, when he finally got a Resident Appointment at the London Hospital, as a House-Surgeon to the sixth Assistant Surgeon, Sir Hugh Cairns. While working for Dr. Cairns, he met with Dr. Harvey Cushing, an experience he describes as \\"one of the great moments of my life\\". After his House-Surgeon job, Stirling took a ten days locum in a 1000-bed mental hospital, his first experience with the field. He would later help develop the first national mental health service in Tanzania. He then continued his work at the London Hospital as a Receiving Room Officer, then House Physician, and ultimately Resident Accoucheur, the most senior resident appointment. He deemed himself \\"very, very lucky\\" for he got all the House Appointments he wanted and, hence, completed 3,5 years of his early career as a junior staff at the London Hospital. In 1933 Leader Stirling left the London Hospital to work in a private practice in South London as a surgeon. He then worked as Outpatient Surgical Officer at a nearby hospital from his private practice for a brief time, when he finally decided to \\"continue the upward climb on the ladder of specialization\\". He applied for Medical Officer to the General Post Office, Resident Medical Officer to Hertford Hospital and Deputy Medical Superintendent to Sunderland Infirmary. He got interviews for all of those positions but was undecided. It was 14 January 1935, when Leader Stirling received a letter from the Universities' Mission to Central Africa (UMCA), asking, \\"A doctor is urgently needed at Masasi. Can you come?\\" calling him to do Missionary Work in Africa. This he describes as the event when he \\"kicked away the ladder\\" (of specialisation). Missionary career: 1935–1969 =Arrival in Africa= 3 months after his decision to join the UMCA, Leader Stirling landed in Zanzibar, then the port of entry to Tanganyika. The UMCA mission in Zanzibar had been well established by another notable missionary, Miss Annie Allen, in 1878. He continued to Masasi, where he could be of more use, to join Dr. Frances Taylor, who was covering 10,000 square miles by walking 20–30 miles a day on foot to practice medicine. She was, according to the Bishop of the mission, \\"perhaps the most over-worked person in the diocese\\".A.G. Blood \\"The History of the Universities' Mission to Central Africa; Vol. III 1933–1957\\". The Universities Mission to Central Africa, London, 1962. His arrival was met with great enthusiasm by the mission: \\"the most joyful thing that has happened medically for a very long time\\". The Masasi Mission Hospital was \\"in a primitive state\\" according to Dr. Stirling, the structure being a thatched hut of rammed earth with no running water. However, they had a laboratory and an operating theatre, and would treat around 300 patients on a normal day's work. On a year they would have 1,000 new admissions and 5,000 new outpatients. Dr. Frances Taylor and Dr. Leader Stirling then divided the area and while the first would be based in Masasi, Stirling would relocate to Lulindi. =Lulindi: 1935–1949= Lulindi was then a very isolated African village with the nearest Post-Office being 24 miles away and with no proper medical infrastructure. Leader Stirling would live here in the next 14 years, from 1935–1949. In that time he built the Lulindi Hospital and the Newala Hospital, being the sole doctor in these two and also the Luatala hospital. He also built numerous Dispensaries, a Nursing School and started a Scouting group. Lulindi Hospital The building of the 80 bed hospital took 3 years to complete. This hospital was in memorial to the late Dr. Culver James, whose legacy provided much of the funds. Dr. Stirling was intimately involved in this development, since he drew the scale-plans, selected a site, marked the foundations, employed brick makers, brick carriers, brick burners and bricklayers, and cut suitable trees into planks. He then had the help of the mission carpenter in making windows and doors and local masons on trimming stone for foundations and floors. For this project he also had the assistance of his uncle, a civil engineer, and his brother-in- law, a military engineer who corresponded with him from England. Besides the more technical chores, Leader Stirling also had a \\"small manual component\\" in the building of the hospital, completed in 1938. Since the initial installations were not enough, in 1946 Leader Stirling added four new wards, store-rooms and nurses' and dressers' rooms, \\"completing his plan for the main block, including the hospital chapel.\\". The Lulindi Hospital facilities in 1946 included a surgical theatre, an outpatient department, a maternity block, a laboratory, a pharmacy, patient wards, store-rooms, nurses' and dressers' rooms, a hospital chapel, an x-ray machine and a built-in wood stove for sterilisation. Newala Hospital Simultaneously with the construction of the Lulindi Hospital, he also designed and built the Newala Hospital. For this he had the help of Sister Anne, who supervised the construction of the 50 bed building. Built in one of the highest populated areas of Tanzania, the hospital began to receive 300 patients daily, increasing to 400 and later more than 500. Dispensaries Leader Stirling also established and maintained a chain of 20 dispensaries to fill the lack of medical infrastructure in the region comprehending \\"almost to the coast and right down to the Mozambique border, the furthest a hundred miles from Lulindi\\". Visits to Nairobi Leader Stirling was also invited two times to visit the capital of Kenya, Nairobi. In his first visit in 1940 he was invited to discuss the brink of an epidemic of malaria, brought by troops during World War II and unknown to Nairobi until then given it sits 5,500 feet above ocean level. Soldiers sent to Addis Ababa also brought back home syphilis. He was then summoned in 1942 by a friend to help with a plague epidemic. =Mnero: 1949–1964= 14 years after his arrival in Lulindi Stirling converted to Catholicism and had to leave the UMCA. Leader Stirling learned the Catholic faith at age ten, which he considered his true faith, but joined the Church of England as a student due to influence of friends. However, after some time in Africa he became convinced that locals should hear \\"the faith once delivered to the Saints\\", and not a European reformed faith. After hearing his formal request for reunion of the Churches was ignored by the 1948 Lambeth Conference, he and 5 more missionaries left the UMCA. A.G. Blood, however, only mentions the departure of 3 missionaries at that time, writing that Dr. Leader Stirling and Fr. Birch left the Anglican Church following Canon Denniss, the Priest-in- charge in 1949: \\"all three had given good service but had become unsettled by events in the Church outside the diocese.\\". Leader Stirling's departure was reckoned by the UMCA as \\"'a very great loss to the medical work of the diocese; but we owe him many thanks for his fourteen years of work with us.' And not only for his medical work, for he had also done a great deal of building and done very much to strengthen and establish over a wide area the Scout movement which was providing itself an asset of ever-increasing value in the diocese.\\". Stirling joins the Benedictine Mission and is sent to found a new hospital in Mnero. This time, though, he has the help of an architect builder from the mission. This meant he could dedicate himself more to the medical work which, in 1958, he describes as follows Besides the Hospital, Leader Stirling also built a male Nurse School, started yet another Scouting group and starts his political career. Upon the arrival of a new Matron to the hospital in 1964, Leader Stirling was accused of trying to be \\"forcing the pace of Africanization\\" in the hospital. The quarrel led to his resignation in that same year. =Kibosho: 1964–1969= Leader Stirling departed Mnero to Dar es Salaam and met the Bishop of Moshi who appointed him to a position in Kibosho, at the slopes of the Kilimanjaro where he was supposed to start a new hospital. This time he had little involvement in the construction of the hospital, made entirely out of local effort, and his job \\"was to bring the buildings into line with medical requirements. (...) and then I had to organize the equipment and the staffing.\\". After working in Kibosho for 5 years and staffing the hospital entirely with locals, including a local doctor, Leader Stirling moved to Soni, a village in the Usambara Mountains. =Soni: 1969–1973= At Soni Leader Stirling settled in and would work as a part-time visiting surgeon to two local hospitals: Lushoto Government Hospital and Bumbuli Church Hospital, in the latter he was also part-time professor at the Medical Assistant Training School. In 1973, following his ever-increasing political involvement, he was placed on a Presidential Commission moved to Dar es Salaam, then capital of the country. This meant the end of his formal medical practice. He would return to the practice of medicine after his retirement at age 75, although informally and sporadically at the request of those who came to him at his house. Political career: 1958–1980 =Parliamentary: 1958–1975= Leader Stirling first experience with politics was at the age of 18. During a school debate he made a \\"burlesque political speech\\" which prompted his schoolmaster to jokingly say that \\"Stirling will undoubtedly become a politician\\". He never thought that he would follow that career, though, as his father would say that \\"politics is a dirty game\\". However, in 1958, at the age of 52, Stirling made his first public speech in Mnero, being the chairman of this event Julius Nyerere. This meeting was historic, being the opening of the campaign that would lead the Southern Province of Tanganyika to elect its first representative to Parliament. While his speech was actually to support an Indian colleague running for that district, Leader Stirling was also running for Parliament for the TANU party representing Southern Tanzania. He was elected in 1958, unopposed, but would have to run again in 1960, as one part of the agreement of independence was the formation of a more representative Parliament. Racial quotas were still in place and the District of Mbeya and Chunya was in need of a TANU candidate to represent its whites. Leader Stirling then ran for that district, even though Mbeya was 700 miles away and the roads were in bad condition. He won his second election against a European coffee-farmer in 1960. He would manage both activities as a parliamentary and missionary doctor since his \\"24 years of single-doctoring\\" were over at Mnero. Tanganyika gained independence in 1961 and the \\"Parliament of Freedom\\" ended its 5-year course in 1965. Leader Stirling had recently moved to Kibosho, where he wasn't popular enough to run and also too distant from Mbeya. His political career might have come to a halt if it wasn't for the fact that the University of Dar es Salaam appointed him to run for a National Seat. He was elected and would keep his Parliamentary seat until 1980 after winning subsequent elections. For being seen by his peers as someone with \\"a nose for irregularities and discrepancies\\", he was involved in several committees and commissions, to the point of being placed in 27 committees simultaneously. In 1973 he was placed on a Presidential Commission and called by the President's Office to live in Dar es Salaam, then capital of the country. His work on this commission was peripatetic and aimed on the retrenchment of public expenditure. He travelled several thousand miles and visited 60 Districts and Regions for irregularities. At that same time he was chairman of the Health Committee of the National Planning Commission and chairman of the Board of the National Food and Nutrition Centre. He was also the chairman of the Special Commission of Inquiry into deaths in the sisal industry, historically a very important industry in Tanzania. He informs that his report on the poor labour conditions brought improvements. Another position he held was chairman of a Commission to investigate the National Provident Fund, early Tanzania's social security program. The Commission eventually was made a Board of Trustees which granted him a permanent Chair. After 6 months on this position a new Government was formed and he was appointed Minister of Health by President Julius Nyerere in 1975. =Minister of Health: 1975–1980= Leader Stirling describes his function as Minister of Health as being \\"generally expected to be a fairly constant stream of new legislation to improve the national health or whatever his responsibility happens to be. I did in fact introduce a number of bills to improve nutrition, hygiene, drug supply, medical research and so forth.\\". Indeed, while Minister, Leader Stirling started the Tanzania National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Program, unifying the scheme of treatment and extending it to the whole country. This program is still in place.[ntlp.go.tz/],\\"Tanzania Tuberculosis and Leprosy Programme\\", accessed 11 December 2013. He also implemented reforms in the mental health scenario of the country, equipping all major hospitals of the country with psychiatric units. As a result, non-criminal mentally ill individuals who were put in prison because there was not enough mental asylums in the country were transferred to the nearest government hospital \\"imprisonment for being simply mentally sick, with no criminal charge, is now a thing of the past in Tanzania\\". During his time as parliamentary he would support government funding of Church Mission Hospitals, which were being neglected. When appointed Minister of Health this issue was resolved by unification of the healthcare system bringing together religious and governmental health facilities. In 1978 Tanzania had more than 3,000 dispensaries and approximately 140 hospitals in total, while having around 8,000 villages. Their aim was to have one dispensary in every village. This scheme of rural medical assistance was adopted worldwide. Another measure of public health policy was to unify the Nursing registry, which was separated between home- trained and foreign-trained (mainly England-trained) nurses. Leader Stirling attended to the International Conference on Primary Health Care in Almaty (former Alma-Ata) from which originated the Alma Ata Declaration. He met with the Minister of Health of the Soviet Union during this event. In 1980, on his last year as a Minister, he chaired the Commonwealth Health Ministers meeting prior to the World Health Assembly in Geneva. In 1979 he idealised and lobbied for a bill that would regulate and nationalise the small private practice in then socialist Tanzania. The bill met some resistance due to widespread ignorance about its contents. He recounts that when election time came, urban \\"crypto-capitalists\\" had financed an effort to secure his defeat. Hence he was, for the first time in 22 years, defeated at a Parliamentary election and went into retirement at age 75. Medical work Leader Stirling had a vast experience with all sorts of illnesses and medical problems during his work in his 3 hospitals. He was also responsible in organising hospital work and routine. Eventually, he developed his unique modus operandi which he describes as: =Surgical= As a medical missionary Leader Stirling performed several different types of surgeries. Trauma surgeries were very common to repair blade wounds, in cases of violent attack or \\"not from fighting but from carelessness\\", since local culture would allow children to play with knives and people had the custom to carry those weapons on top of their loincloths. Besides those cases, beast attacks were a recurrent happening, with crocodiles, \\"lion, leopards, hippopotamus, wild boar, buffalo, baboon, hyena, and even the little bushbuck.\\" being the perpetrators. He would also correct difficult fractures and poliomyelitis deformities using orthopaedic techniques. Plastic surgeries were frequent for chronic ulcers, burns, hare- lip, vesico-vaginal fistula, trachoma, various scars and most importantly elephantiasis, to which he devised a new bloodless operation. He was also innovative in being one of the first to drain paraplegia-causing tuberculous abscesses. Removal of tumors and even teeth were also performed, along with hernia repairs. He was also able to align local customs with modern medical norms in the case of circumcision surgeries, which were performed by untrained tribal leaders with little to no antiseptic precautions before his intervention. To overcome the lack of proper infrastructure and equipments, Leader Stirling made instruments out of simple materials: \\"screw-drivers made ideal supracondylar traction pins, sewing cotton became perfect ligatures. Thomas splints were contrived from bamboo, extension cord from plaited palm leaves with stones as traction weights. For intravenous infusions he used triple-distilled water, to which he added salt and glucose. When plaster of Paris ran out, he made his own from locally quarried gypsum.\\" Leader Stirling also noted local differences between the places he worked. While Mnero and Lulindi were geographically close, Kibosho had a very different climate and population. Hernia, hydrocele and elephantiasis \\"which for thirty years had been my daily surgical chore\\" were less common in Kibosho than in the south villages. =Clinical= Even though surgery was his speciality, Leader Stirling had to deal with all sorts of medical problems working as a single doctor. Indeed, he affirms that surgery was a small part of his work. Tropical disease would in fact take most of his time. Examples of those are malaria (the most common), yaws, bilharzia, hookworm infestation, leprosy, and ulcers of the leg (acute or chronic) \\"the biggest constant problem\\". Besides tropical diseases he also dealt with pneumonia, meningitis, septic infections, measles, whooping cough and even cancer. Once again there were geographical differences in the occurrence of diseases. Kibosho had more worms, stomach trouble, high blood pressure and rheumatic fever while having less of bilharzia and leprosy relative to the south villages of Lulindi and Mnero. Nurse training Soon after his arrival in Africa, Leader Stirling saw the need and opportunity for nurse training in Tanzania. In 1935 there would be usually only one doctor and one to two nurses per hospital, all imported, except on the big centres. There were already 4 schools in the country to train \\"dispensers\\", now called medical assistants, but no nursing schools. The challenge to training nurses was that local school heads would hold onto their brightest students, encouraging them to go into teacher-training, under the impression that teaching was the only honourable occupation for an African woman. It was with the help of an experienced British nurse, Miss May Bell, that he started a nursing school in Lulindi, which was in later years transferred to Masasi and was still running in 1987, when he published the book. Mrs. Thekla Mchauru was the first woman to complete the course, qualifying in 1940 and becoming a registered nurse, the first Tanganyikan woman to do so. Miss May Bell and Leader Stirling's syllabus, based on the British model, was later adopted by the government and implemented all over the country's nursing schools. At Mnero Leader Stirling also got involved in nurse training. Soon after the Mnero Hospital was built in the early 1950s, the Bishop gave him orders to start a new male nursing school. In 1959 they switched their training to Rural Medical Aids since there was a higher shortage of those professionals and, thus, became one of the only two Rural Medical Aids School in the country along with a governmental one. Scouting Leader Stirling started his long career in Scouting at the age of 11. After some years off, he got back to it in medical school when he first assisted and then led one of the two troops of Toynbee Hall. He also started a new troop while working in private practice in South London. In 1937 he helped Scout Commissioner George Tibbatts, also an English missionary, to establish the first Scout group in Southern Tanzania. However, since the Commissioner had to return to England after breaking his leg and this group was based 20 miles away, Leader Stirling discontinued the group. It was only in 1939 when Stirling was able to found his first Rover Scouts crew, based in Lulindi. After the success of this group he was invited to open another one in Luatala and with the growing interest in scouting in the region he eventually had to organise an informal Scoutmastership training event so as to train enough Scout Masters to lead troops. In 1941 the region had already around a dozen troops of Scouts and a district rally was promoted by Leader Stirling, which was attended by 124 out of the 132 scouts then registered. In 1947 the rally, now an annual event, attracted 300 scouts. In 1948 he was appointed Commissioner for Training, spending the following 15 years training Scoutmasters for the whole country and in 1952 he ran his first Wood Badge course. Soon after the country's independence he was elected Chief Scout of Tanganyika, in 1962, and held this position for 10 more years.\\"Leader Dominic Stirling\\", \\"British Medical Journal\\", accessed 16 December 2013 He attended to the great Jubilee Jamboree of Scouting at Sutton Coldfield, England in 1957 with a group of 30 Tanzanians (Tanganyikans and Zanzibaris alike) where he met Queen Elizabeth II. Personal life Leader Stirling became a Tanzanian citizen following the country's independence, in 1961. This was also required by his Parliamentary position and meant he had to relinquish his British citizenship, for Tanzania did not allow dual nationality. Soon afterwards he married his first wife Regina Haule, an African nurse, in 1963, while living in Mnero. They moved to Kibosho in 1964 and a year later his mother paid the couple a visit, at the age of 88, her first visit to Africa. Unfortunately his wife died in 1972 of septicaemia when the couple was living in Soni. Not long after widowing, Leader Stirling married his second wife Anna Chilunda, an African nurse trained by his nursing school in Lulindi, but also a widow Princess. He became the stepfather of her 6 children. Leader Stirling was a devout and involved Catholic. Besides his missionary work, always linked to a religious institution and inspired by his faith, he founded and held the Chair of the Tanzania Christian Association and was also advisor to the Christian Social Services Commission.Events of 2003, Leader Stirling obituary, \\"Nyangao Hospital\\", accessed 16 December 2013 He also mentions meeting with the Pope.

In superionic water, water molecules break apart and the oxygen ions crystallize into an evenly spaced lattice while the hydrogen ions float around freely within the oxygen lattice.Weird water lurking inside giant planets, New Scientist,01 September 2010, Magazine issue 2776. The freely mobile hydrogen ions make superionic water almost as conductive as typical metals, making it a superionic conductor. It is one of the 18 known crystalline phases of ice. Superionic water is distinct from ionic water, which is a hypothetical liquid state characterized by a disordered soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions. While theorized for decades, it was not until the 1990s that the first experimental evidence emerged for superionic water. Initial evidence came from optical measurements of laser-heated water in a diamond anvil cell, and from optical measurements of water shocked by extremely powerful lasers. The first definitive evidence for the crystal structure of the oxygen lattice in superionic water came from x-ray measurements on laser-shocked water which were reported in 2019. If it were present on the surface of the Earth, superionic ice would rapidly decompress. In May 2019, scientists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) were able to synthesize superionic ice, confirming it to be almost four times as dense as normal ice and black in color. Superionic water is theorized to be present in the mantles of giant planets such as Uranus and Neptune.  Properties  , it is theorized that superionic ice can possess two crystalline structures. At pressures in excess of it is predicted that superionic ice would take on a body-centered cubic structure. However, at pressures in excess of it is predicted that the structure would shift to a more stable face-centered cubic lattice.Phys.org, \\"New phase of water could dominate the interiors of Uranus and Neptune\\", Lisa Zyga, 25 April 2013  History of theoretical and experimental evidence  Demontis et al. made the first prediction for superionic water using classical molecular dynamics simulations in 1988. In 1999, Cavazzoni et al. predicted that such a state would exist for ammonia and water in conditions such as those existing on Uranus and Neptune. In 2005 Laurence Fried led a team at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to recreate the formative conditions of superionic water. Using a technique involving smashing water molecules between diamonds and super heating it with lasers they observed frequency shifts which indicated that a phase transition had taken place. The team also created computer models which indicated that they had indeed created superionic water. In 2013 Hugh F. Wilson, Michael L. Wong, and Burkhard Militzer at the University of California, Berkeley published a paper predicting the face-centered cubic lattice structure that would emerge at higher pressures. Additional experimental evidence was found by Marius Millot and colleagues in 2018 by inducing high pressure on water between diamonds and then shocking the water using a laser pulse.  2018–2019 experiments  In 2018, researchers at LLNL squeezed water between two pieces of diamond with a pressure of . The water was squeezed into type VII ice which is 60 percent denser than normal water. The compressed ice was then transported to the University of Rochester where it was blasted by a pulse of laser light. The reaction created conditions like those inside of ice giants such as Uranus and Neptune by heating up the ice thousands of degrees under a pressure a million times greater than the earth's atmosphere in only ten to 20 billionths of a second. The experiment concluded that the current in the conductive water was indeed carried by ions rather than electrons and thus pointed to the water being superionic. More recent experiments from the same Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory team used x-ray crystallography on laser-shocked water droplets to determine that the oxygen ions enter a face- centered-cubic phase, which was dubbed ice XVIII and reported in the journal Nature in May 2019.  Existence in ice giants  It is theorized that the ice giant planets Uranus and Neptune hold a layer of superionic water. But there are also studies that suggest that other elements present inside the interiors of these planets, particularly carbon, may prevent the formation of superionic water.

Uppsala: Nordiska Afrikainstitutet, 1999. p.235 Contacts between Sweden and SWANU began in the early 1960s, as Namibian students from SWANU obtained scholarships to study in Sweden. A close relationship was formed between the SWANU students and the Social Democratic Party. Support for Namibian independence Contacts between Sweden and SWAPO began after the 1966 International Conference on South West Africa, held in Oxford. Representatives from all parliamentary parties from Sweden (except the Moderate Party) took part in the conference. In the same year two Swedish newspapers, Aftonbladet and Arbetet, initiated a fund-raising campaign for SWANU and SWAPO. Moreover, the National Union of South West African Students was founded in Uppsala in 1966, organized jointly by SWANU and SWAPO.Sellström, Tor. Sweden and National Liberation in Southern Africa. Uppsala: Nordiska Afrikainstitutet, 1999. pp. 237-238 In 1969 the Swedish parliament voted to initiate official assistance to SWAPO.

Uppsala: Nordiska Afrikainstitutet, 1999. p.236 SWAPO was the sole Namibian nationalist movement to receive official Swedish aid. However, Sweden did not subscribe to the UN General Assembly resolution of 1973 that declared SWAPO as the sole legitimate representative of the Namibian people. Rather, Swedish governments during the 1970s (both Social Democratic and non-socialist) described SWAPO as the leading force of the Namibian independence campaign.Sellström, Tor.

By 1976 Sweden was the largest SWAPO donor outside the Socialist Bloc. Financial aid to SWAPO was increased significantly under the Thorbjörn Fälldin government (in 1976 the annual contribution to SWAPO stood at 5.9 million Swedish krona, by 1979 the figure was 22 million).

The conservancy is an all-volunteer organization with a ten-member board. Some of the Conservancy's most successful projects outside of the Ventura architectural Weekend tours and trade shows has been the ability of the board to work closely the City of Ventura, California and developers to find preservation solutions for historic buildings. At times the Conservancy advocates for specific historic buildings like Willett Ranch link to article and the Top Hat Burger Palace in Ventura, the Frank Petit House in South Oxnard, California, the Charles McCoy house, in Port Hueneme, California, and the Bracero farm Worker Camp in Piru, California, and the Wagon Wheel Motel on the 101 Freeway in Oxnard, California.

He went as a child to New England with his father, and was entered at Harvard University in 1651, where he studied both theology and medicine, but, coming to England, completed his education at Oxford University, where he proceeded M.A. Before 1660 he was given the rectory of Woodborough, Wiltshire, where he resided until ejected by the Act of Uniformity in 1662. Thereupon he removed to Andover, Hampshire, where he took charge of a congregational church.

A bank cash shipment was stolen by Bolsheviks to fund their revolutionary activities. The robbers attacked a bank stagecoach, and the surrounding police and soldiers, using bombs and guns while the stagecoach was transporting money through Erivansky Square (now Freedom Square) between the post office and the Tiflis branch of the State Bank of the Russian Empire. The attack killed forty people and injured fifty others, according to official archive documents. The robbers escaped with 241,000 rubles.(White, James D. Red Hamlet: The Life and Ideas of Alexander Bogdanov, 2018, p. 179). The robbery was organized by a number of top-level Bolsheviks, including Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, Maxim Litvinov, Leonid Krasin, and Alexander Bogdanov, and executed by a party of revolutionaries led by Stalin's early associate Simon Ter-Petrosian, also known as \\"Kamo\\" and \\"The Caucasian Robin-Hood\\". Because such activities were explicitly prohibited by the 5th Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP), the robbery and the killings caused outrage within the party against the Bolsheviks (a faction within the RSDLP). As a result, Lenin and Stalin tried to distance themselves from the robbery. The events surrounding the incident and similar robberies split the Bolshevik leadership, with Lenin against Bogdanov and Krasin. Despite the success of the robbery and the large sum involved, the Bolsheviks could not use most of the large banknotes obtained from the robbery because their serial numbers were known to the police. Lenin conceived of a plan to have various individuals cash the large bank notes at once at various locations throughout Europe in January 1908, but this strategy failed, resulting in a number of arrests, worldwide publicity, and negative reaction from social democrats elsewhere in Europe. Kamo was caught in Germany shortly after the robbery but successfully avoided a criminal trial by feigning insanity for more than three years. He managed to escape from his psychiatric ward but was captured two years later while planning another robbery. Kamo was then sentenced to death for his crimes including the 1907 robbery, but his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment; he was released after the 1917 Revolution. None of the other major participants or organizers of the robbery were ever brought to trial. After his death, a monument to Kamo was erected near Erivansky Square in Pushkin Gardens and Kamo was buried beneath it. The monument was later removed and Kamo's remains were moved elsewhere.  Background  Police photograph of V. I. Lenin from December 1895alt=A mugshot of a young balding man with a Van Dyke beard. The Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP), the predecessor of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, was formed in 1898. The goal of the RSDLP was to carry out a Marxist proletarian revolution against the Russian Empire. As part of their revolutionary activity, the RSDLP and other revolutionary groups (such as anarchists and Socialist Revolutionaries) practised a range of militant operations, including \\"expropriations\\", a euphemism for armed robberies of government or private funds to support revolutionary activities. From 1903 onwards, the RSDLP were divided between two major groups: the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks. After the suppression of the 1905 Revolution, the RSDLP held its 5th Congress in May–June 1907 in London with the hopes of resolving differences between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks. One issue that still separated the two groups was the divergence of their views on militant activities, and in particular, \\"expropriations\\". The most militant Bolsheviks, led at the 5th Congress by Vladimir Lenin, supported continuation of the use of robberies, while Mensheviks advocated a more peaceful and gradual approach to revolution, and opposed militant operations. At the 5th Congress, a resolution was passed condemning participation in or assistance to all militant activity, including \\"expropriations\\" as \\"disorganizing and demoralizing\\", and called for all party militias to be disbanded. This resolution passed with 65 per cent supporting and 6 per cent opposing (others abstained or did not vote) with all Mensheviks and some Bolsheviks supporting the resolution. Despite the unified party's prohibition on separate committees, during the 5th Congress the Bolsheviks elected their own governing body, called the Bolshevik Centre, and kept it secret from the rest of the RSDLP. The Bolshevik Centre was headed by a \\"Finance Group\\" consisting of Lenin, Leonid Krasin and Alexander Bogdanov. Among other party activities, the Bolshevik leadership had already planned a number of \\"expropriations\\" in different parts of Russia by the time of the 5th Congress and was awaiting a major robbery in Tiflis, which occurred only weeks after the 5th Congress ended.  Preparation  Before the 5th Congress met, high-ranking Bolsheviks held a meeting in Berlin in April 1907 to discuss staging a robbery to obtain funds to purchase arms. Attendees included Lenin, Stalin, Krasin, Bogdanov and Litvinov. The group decided that Stalin, then known by his earlier nom de guerre Koba, and the Armenian Ter-Petrosian, known as Kamo, should organize a bank robbery in the city of Tiflis. The 29-year-old Stalin was living in Tiflis with his wife Ekaterina and newborn son Yakov. Stalin was experienced at organizing robberies, and these exploits had helped him gain a reputation as the centre's principal financier. Kamo, four years younger than Stalin, had a reputation for ruthlessness; later in his life he cut a man's heart from his chest. At the time of the conspiracy, Kamo ran a criminal organization called \\"the Outfit\\". Stalin said that Kamo was \\"a master of disguise\\", and Lenin called Kamo his \\"Caucasian bandit\\". Stalin and Kamo had grown up together, and Stalin had converted Kamo to Marxism. After the April meeting, Stalin and Litvinov travelled to Tiflis to inform Kamo of the plans and to organize the raid. According to Roman Brackman's The Secret File of Joseph Stalin: A Hidden Life, while Stalin was working with the Bolsheviks to organize criminal activities, he was also acting as an informant for the Okhrana, the Russian secret police. Brackman alleges that once the group returned to Tiflis, Stalin informed his Okhrana contact, Officer Mukhtarov, about the bank robbery plans and promised to provide the Okhrana with more information at a later time. In Tiflis, Stalin began planning for the robbery. He established contact with two individuals with inside information about the State Bank's operations: a bank clerk named Gigo Kasradze and an old school friend of Stalin's named Voznesensky who worked at the Tiflis banking mail office. Voznesensky later stated that he had helped out in the theft out of admiration for Stalin's romantic poetry. Voznesensky worked in the Tiflis banking mail office, giving him access to a secret schedule that showed the times that cash would be transferred by stagecoach to the Tiflis branch of the State Bank. Voznesensky notified Stalin that the bank would be receiving a large shipment of money by horse-drawn carriage on 26 June 1907. Krasin helped manufacture bombs to use in the attack on the stagecoach. Kamo's gang smuggled bombs into Tiflis by hiding them inside a sofa. Only weeks before the robbery, Kamo accidentally detonated one of Krasin's bombs while trying to set the fuse. The blast severely injured him in the eye, leaving a permanent scar. Kamo was confined to his bed for a month owing to intense pain, and had not fully recovered by the time of the robbery.  Day of the robbery  New York Times article, June 27, 1907. On the day of the robbery, 26 June 1907, the 20 organizers, including Stalin, met near Erivansky Square (just 2 minutes from the seminary, bank and viceroy's palace) to finalize their plans, and after the meeting, they went to their designated places in preparation for the attack. The Russian authorities had become aware that some large action was being planned by revolutionaries in Tiflis, and had increased the security presence in the main square; just prior to the robbery, they had been tipped off and were guarding every street corner in Erivansky Square. To deal with the increased security, gang members spotted patrolling gendarmes and police prior to the robbery and lookouts were posted looking down on the square from above. The gang members mostly dressed themselves as peasants and waited on street corners with revolvers and grenades. In contrast to the others, Kamo was disguised as a cavalry captain and came to the square in a horse-drawn phaeton, a type of open carriage. The conspirators took over the Tilipuchuri tavern facing the square in preparation for the robbery. A witness, David Sagirashvili, later stated that he had been walking in Erivansky Square when a friend named Bachua Kupriashvili, who later turned out to be one of the robbers, invited him into a tavern and asked him to stay. Once inside the tavern, Sagirashvili realized that armed men were stopping people from leaving. When they received a signal that the bank stagecoach was nearing the square, the armed men quickly left the building with pistols drawn. The Tiflis branch of the State Bank of the Russian Empire had arranged to transport funds between the post office and the State Bank by horse-drawn stagecoach. Inside the stagecoach was the money, two guards with rifles, a bank cashier, and a bank accountant. A phaeton filled with armed soldiers rode behind the stagecoach, and mounted cossacks rode in front, next to, and behind the carriages. = Attack = alt=Drawing of a man holding a whip, sitting on top of an open carriage pulled by two horses. The stagecoach made its way through the crowded square at about 10:30 am. Kupriashvili gave the signal, and the robbers hit the carriage with grenades, killing many of the horses and guards, and began shooting security men guarding the stagecoach and the square. Bombs were thrown from all directions. The Georgian newspaper Isari reported: \\"No one could tell if the terrible shooting was the boom of cannons or explosion of bombs ... The sound caused panic everywhere ... almost across the whole city, people started running. Carriages and carts were galloping away\\". The blasts were so strong that they knocked over nearby chimneys and broke every pane of glass for a mile around. Ekaterina Svanidze, Stalin's wife, was standing on a balcony at their home near the square with her family and young child. When they heard the explosions, they rushed back into the house terrified. One of the injured horses harnessed to the bank stagecoach bolted, pulling the stagecoach with it, chased by Kupriashvili, Kamo, and another robber, Datiko Chibriashvili. Kupriashvili threw a grenade that blew off the horse's legs, but Kupriashvili was caught in the explosion, landing stunned on the ground. He regained consciousness and sneaked out of the square before police and military reinforcements arrived. Chibriashvili snatched the sacks of money from the stagecoach while Kamo rode up firing his pistol, and they and another robber threw the money into Kamo's phaeton. Pressed for time, they inadvertently left twenty thousand rubles behind, some of which was pocketed by one of the stagecoach drivers who was later arrested for the theft. = Escape and aftermath = A fragment of the 1913 map of Tiflis, highlighting Erivansky Square and adjacent streets After securing the money, Kamo quickly rode out of the square; encountering a police carriage, he pretended to be a captain of the cavalry, shouting, \\"The money's safe. Run to the square.\\" The deputy in the carriage obeyed, realizing only later that he had been fooled by an escaping robber. Kamo then rode to the gang's headquarters where he changed out of his uniform. All of the robbers quickly scattered, and none were caught. One of the robbers, Eliso Lominadze, stole a teacher's uniform to disguise himself and came back to the square, gazing at the carnage. Fifty casualties lay wounded in the square along with the dead people and horses. The authorities stated that only three people had died, but documents in the Okhrana archives reveal that the true number was around forty. The State Bank was not sure how much it actually lost from the robbery, but the best estimates were around 341,000 rubles, worth around 3.4 million US dollars as of 2008. About 91,000 rubles were in small untraceable bills, with the rest in large 500-ruble notes that were difficult to exchange because their serial numbers were known to the police. = Stalin's role = alt=Set of three photographs and a filled form, all profiling a man with a thick mustache and dark hair, dressed in a hat, black overcoat, white shirt, black pants and black shoes. Stalin's exact actions on the day of the robbery are unknown and disputed. One source, P. A. Pavlenko, claimed that Stalin attacked the carriage itself and had been wounded by a bomb fragment. Kamo later stated that Stalin took no active part in the robbery and had watched it from a distance. Another source stated in a police report that Stalin \\"observed the ruthless bloodshed, smoking a cigarette, from the courtyard of a mansion.\\" Another source claims that Stalin was actually at the railway station during the robbery and not at the square. Stalin's sister-in-law stated that Stalin came home the night of the robbery and told his family about its success. Stalin's role was later questioned by fellow revolutionaries Boris Nicolaevsky and Leon Trotsky. The latter, Stalin's rival, was later assassinated on orders from Stalin. In his book Stalin: An Appraisal of the Man and His Influence, Trotsky analyzed many publications describing the Tiflis expropriation and other Bolshevik militant activities of that time, and concluded, \\"Others did the fighting; Stalin supervised them from afar\\". In general, according to Nicolaevsky, \\"The role played by Stalin in the activities of the Kamo group was subsequently exaggerated\\". Kun later discovered official archive documents however clearly showing that \\"from late 1904 or early 1905 Stalin took part in drawing up plans for expropriations\\", adding, \\"It is now certain that [Stalin] controlled from the wings the initial plans of the group\\" that carried out the Tiflis robbery.  Security response and investigation  alt=A cartoon of a man dressed in an iron suit, wearing a black top hat with a lockbox chained to his neck, getting into a horse-drawn carriage made out of metal and covered with spikes and cannons. The robbery featured in headlines worldwide: \\"Rain of Bombs: Revolutionaries Hurl Destruction among Large Crowds of People\\" in the London Daily Mirror, \\"Tiflis Bomb Outrage\\" in The Times of London, \\"Catastrophe!\\" in Le Temps in Paris, and \\"Bomb Kills Many; $170,000 Captured\\" in The New York Times. Authorities mobilized the army, closed roads, and surrounded the square hoping to secure the money and capture the criminals. A special detective unit was brought in to lead the police investigation. Unfortunately for the investigators, witness testimony was confusing and conflicting, and the authorities did not know which group was responsible for the robbery. Polish socialists, Armenians, anarchists, Socialist- Revolutionaries, and even the Russian State itself were blamed. According to Brackman, several days after the robbery the Okhrana agent Mukhtarov questioned Stalin in a secret apartment. The agents had heard rumors that Stalin had been seen watching passively during the robbery. Mukhtarov asked Stalin why he had not informed them about it, and Stalin stated that he had provided adequate information to the authorities to prevent the theft. The questioning escalated into a heated argument; Mukhtarov hit Stalin in the face and had to be restrained by other Okhrana officers. After this incident, Mukhtarov was suspended from the Okhrana, and Stalin was ordered to leave Tiflis and go to Baku to await a decision in the case. Stalin left Baku with 20,000 rubles in stolen money in July 1907. While Brackman claims to have found evidence of this incident, whether Stalin cooperated with the Okhrana during his early life has been a subject of debate among historians for many decades and has yet to be resolved.  Moving the money and Kamo's arrest  The funds from the robbery were originally kept at the house of Stalin's friends in Tiflis, Mikha and Maro Bochoridze. The money was sewn into a mattress so that it could be moved and stored easily without arousing suspicion. The mattress was moved to another safe house, then later put on the director's couch at the Tiflis Meteorological Observatory, possibly because Stalin had worked there. Some sources claim that Stalin himself helped put the money in the observatory. The director stated that he never knew that the stolen money had been stored under his roof. A large portion of the stolen money was eventually moved by Kamo, who took the money to Lenin in Finland, which was then part of the Russian Empire. Kamo spent the remaining summer months staying with Lenin at his dacha. That autumn, Kamo traveled to Paris, to Belgium to buy arms and ammunition, and to Bulgaria to buy 200 detonators. He next traveled to Berlin and delivered a letter from Lenin to a prominent Bolshevik physician, Yakov Zhitomirsky, asking him to treat Kamo's eye, which had not completely healed from the bomb blast. Unknown to Lenin, Zhitomirsky had been secretly working as an agent of the Russian government and quickly informed the Okhrana, who asked the Berlin police to arrest Kamo. When they did so, they found a forged Austrian passport and a suitcase with the detonators, which he was planning to use in another large bank robbery.  Cashing the marked notes  Maxim Litvinov in 1902 After hearing of Kamo's arrest, Lenin feared that he too might be arrested and fled from Finland with his wife. To avoid being followed, Lenin walked three miles (4.8 km) across a frozen lake at night to catch a steamer at a nearby island. On his trek across the ice, Lenin and his two companions nearly drowned when the ice started to give way underneath them; Lenin later admitted it seemed like it would have been a \\"stupid way to die\\". Lenin and his wife escaped and headed to Switzerland. The unmarked bills from the robbery were easy to exchange, but the serial numbers of the 500-ruble notes were known to the authorities, making them impossible to exchange in Russian banks. By the end of 1907, Lenin decided to exchange the remaining 500-ruble notes abroad. Krasin had his forger try to change some of the serial numbers. Two hundred of these notes were transported abroad by Martyn Lyadov (they were sewn into his vest by the wives of Lenin and Bogdanov at Lenin's headquarters in Kuokkala). Lenin's plan was to have various individuals exchange the stolen 500-ruble notes simultaneously at a number of banks throughout Europe. Zhitomirsky heard of the plan and reported it to the Okhrana, who contacted police departments throughout Europe asking them to arrest anyone who tried to cash the notes. In January 1908, a number of individuals were arrested while attempting to exchange the notes. The New York Times reported that one woman who had tried to cash a marked 500-ruble note later tried to swallow evidence of her plans to meet her accomplices after the police were summoned, but the police stopped her from swallowing the paper by grabbing her throat, retrieved the paper, and later arrested her accomplices at the train station. Most prominent among those arrested was Maxim Litvinov, caught while boarding a train with his mistress at Paris's Gare du Nord with twelve of the 500-ruble notes he intended to cash in London. The French Minister of Justice expelled Litvinov and his mistress from French territory, outraging the Russian government, which had requested his extradition. Officially the French government stated that Russia's request for extradition had been submitted too late, but by some accounts, they denied the extradition because French socialists had applied political pressure to secure his release. Nadezhda Krupskaya, Lenin's wife, discussed these events in her memoirs: Brackman claims that despite the arrests, Lenin continued his attempts to exchange the 500-ruble notes and did manage to trade some of them for 10,000 rubles from an unknown woman in Moscow. According to Nicolaevsky, however, Lenin abandoned attempts to exchange the notes after the arrests, but Bogdanov tried (and failed) to exchange some notes in North America, while Krasin succeeded in forging new serial numbers and managed to exchange several more notes. Soon after, Lenin's associates burned all the 500-ruble notes remaining in their possession.  Trials of Kamo  Leonid Krasin around 1903After Kamo was arrested in Berlin and awaiting trial, he received a note from Krasin through his lawyer Oscar Kohn telling him to feign insanity so that he would be declared unfit to stand trial. To demonstrate his insanity, he refused food, tore his clothes, tore out his hair, attempted to hang himself, slashed his wrists, and ate his own excrement. To make sure that he was not faking his condition, German doctors stuck pins under his nails, struck him in the back with a long needle, and burned him with hot irons, but he did not break his act. After all of these tests, the chief doctor of the Berlin asylum wrote in June 1909 that \\"there is no foundation to the belief that [Kamo] is feigning insanity. He is without doubt mentally ill, is incapable of appearing before a court, or of serving sentence. It is extremely doubtful that he can completely recover.\\" In 1909 Kamo was extradited to a Russian prison, where he continued to feign insanity. In April 1910, he was put on trial for his role in the Tiflis robbery, where he ignored the proceedings and openly fed a pet bird that he had hidden in his shirt. The trial was suspended while officials determined his sanity. The court eventually found that he had been sane when he committed the Tiflis robbery, but was presently mentally ill and should be confined until he recovered. In August 1911, after feigning insanity for more than three years, Kamo escaped from the psychiatric ward of a prison in Tiflis by sawing through his window bars and climbing down a homemade rope. Kamo later discussed these experiences: After escaping, Kamo met up with Lenin in Paris, and was distressed to hear that a \\"rupture had occurred\\" between Lenin, Bogdanov, and Krasin. Kamo told Lenin about his arrest and how he had simulated insanity while in prison. After leaving Paris, Kamo eventually met up with Krasin and planned another armed robbery. Kamo was caught before the robbery took place and was put on trial in Tiflis in 1913 for his exploits including the Tiflis bank robbery. This time, Kamo did not feign insanity while imprisoned, but he did pretend that he had forgotten all that happened to him when he was previously \\"insane\\". The trial was brief and Kamo was given four death sentences. Seemingly doomed to death, Kamo then had the good luck along with other prisoners to have his sentence commuted to a long prison term as part of the celebrations of the Romanov dynasty tricentennial in 1913. Kamo was released from prison after the February Revolution in 1917.  Aftermath  = Effect on Bolsheviks = Apart from Kamo, none of the organizers of the robbery were ever brought to trial, and initially it was not clear who was behind the raid, but after the arrest of Kamo, Litvinov and others, the Bolshevik involvement became obvious. The Mensheviks felt betrayed and angry; the robbery proved that the Bolshevik Centre operated independently from the unified Central Committee and was taking actions explicitly prohibited by the party congress. The leader of the Mensheviks, Georgi Plekhanov, called for separation from the Bolsheviks. Plekhanov's colleague, Julius Martov, said the Bolshevik Centre was something between a secret factional central committee and a criminal gang. The Tiflis Committee of the party expelled Stalin and several members for the robbery. The party's investigations into Lenin's conduct were thwarted by the Bolsheviks.alt=A city square; at the center is a large pillar with a golden statue on top; in the background is a large building with a steeple. The robbery made the Bolsheviks even less popular in Georgia and left the Bolsheviks in Tiflis without effective leadership. After the death by natural causes of his wife Ekaterina Svanidze in November 1907, Stalin rarely returned to Tiflis. Other leading Bolsheviks in Georgia, such as Mikhail Tskhakaya and Filipp Makharadze, were largely absent from Georgia after 1907. Another prominent Tiflis Bolshevik, Stepan Shahumyan, moved to Baku. The Bolsheviks' popularity in Tiflis continued to fall, and by 1911, there were only about 100 Bolsheviks left in the city. The robbery also made the Bolshevik Centre unpopular more widely among European social democrat groups. Lenin's desire to distance himself from the legacy of the robbery may have been one of the sources of the rift between him and Bogdanov and Krasin. Stalin distanced himself from Kamo's gang and never publicized his role in the robbery. = Later careers = After the Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917, many of those who had been involved in the robbery became high ranking Soviet officials. Lenin went on to become the first Soviet Premier, the post he held until his death in 1924, followed by Stalin as leader of the Soviet Union until his own death in 1953. Maxim Litvinov became a Soviet diplomat, serving as People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs (1930–1939). Leonid Krasin initially quit politics after the split from Lenin in 1909, but rejoined the Bolsheviks after the 1917 Revolution and served as the Soviet trade representative in London and as People's Commissar for Foreign Trade until his death in 1926. After Kamo's release from prison, he worked in the Soviet customs office, by some accounts because he was too unstable to work for the secret police. He died in 1922 when a truck hit him while he was cycling. Although there is no proof of foul play, some have theorized that Stalin ordered his death to keep him quiet. Bogdanov was expelled from the party in 1909, ostensibly over philosophical differences. After the Bolshevik Revolution, he became the leading ideologist of Proletkult, an organization designed to foster a new proletarian culture. = Monument = Erivansky Square, where the robbery took place, was renamed Lenin Square by the Soviet authorities in 1921, and a large statue of Lenin was erected in his honour in 1956. Despite being convicted of the bloody robbery, Kamo was originally buried and had a monument erected in his honour in Pushkin Gardens, near Erivansky Square. Created by the sculptor Iakob Nikoladze, it was removed during Stalin's rule, and Kamo's remains were moved to another location. The statue of Lenin was torn down in August 1991—one of the final moments of the Soviet Union—and replaced by the Liberty Monument in 2006. The name of the square was changed from Lenin Square to Freedom Square in 1991.

His original Georgian name was \\"Josef Vissarionovich Djugashvili\\", but his friends and family called him \\"Soso\\". During his early revolutionary years, which would include the years of the 1907 Tiflis bank robbery, he mostly went by the revolutionary nom de guerre \\"Koba\\", which he obtained from a character in Alexander Kazbegi's novel The Patricide. He published poetry under the name \\"Soselo\\". In 1912, he began to use the name Stalin and later adopted this as his surname after October 1917. The name Stalin is translated to mean \\"Man of Steel\\". This article uses the name by which he is most commonly known to the world, \\"Joseph Stalin\\", for clarity.

Pappaphilipopoulos, who would Americanize his name to Peter Nelson, led the organization of a church. Their initial meeting was held at a Knights of Columbus Hall. In 1920 they purchased property near the downtown area for $35,000. There was a house on the property that was used as the parish's first church. Father Constantinos Harvelas served as the church's first pastor. The cornerstone for the present church building was laid in the spring of 1925 and the church was dedicated on October 4 of the same year.

The company was formed in November 1931 as Hillman's Saloon Coaches and Airways Limited by Edward Henry Hillman who was a coach operator in Essex. His previous business had been sold to London Transport following a change in government rules on the expansion of bus routes. The airline's first service was a charter flight on 25 December 1931. It started a scheduled service on 1 April 1932 between Romford and Clacton using a de Havilland Puss Moth and a de Havilland Fox Moth; with a fare of £1 return it was operated every three hours due to the popularity. A de Havilland Dragon was bought to operate an international service between Romford and Paris Le Bourget. From 1 December 1934, the airline was given a contract to fly air mail between London, Liverpool, Glasgow and Belfast formerly operated by the Railway Air Services. Following the award of the contract Hillman changed the legal name from Hillman's Airways Limited to Edward Henry Hillman Limited and the airline extended its services to continental Europe, including Ostend and Brussels. On 1 June 1934 the airline moved its operating base to Stapleford Aerodrome. Just before Hillman died, on 31 December 1934, aged 45, the company became a public company, although within a year it had been merged with two other airlines to form British Airways.

They were the only passengers, having bought all the seats on the aircraft, but claiming before take-off that their companions could not travel that day. Their bodies were found on waste ground in Upminster, but the pilot only became aware of what had happened some time later when over the English Channel. The women were the daughters of the American Consul in Naples, Court Du Bois. The women had been well-known society figures and press speculation linked their double suicide with the recent deaths of two R.A.F. pilots whom they had been romantically linked to.

Biography Originally from Asyut in middle Egypt, she grew up in the upper-class Mohandessin, Cairo suburb. As a student in faculty of arts, she majored in French at Ain Shams University. One of her instructors, a French man, offered her the opportunity of furthering her studies in at the Sorbonne in Paris. She stayed with an Egyptian family in Paris and was a regular guest at the Egyptian ambassador's home. In a 2010 Egyptian TV program, the ambassador, Fakhry Othman, described her as attractive, cheerful, bright, and patriotic. He did note, however, that she struggled financially as she could not find work in the Egyptian Embassy in Paris. In Paris, she met a Jewish colleague of Polish descent who invited her to a party with other Jewish friends, and convinced her about Israeli aspirations for peace, which was also an ambition to Heba. However, after her recruitment by the Mossad, she married Farouk El Fikki, an engineer Egyptian army officer, and gathered information - through him - about the locations of the anti-aircraft batteries, including the 2K12 Kub. He later became aware and willingly participated in her spying activities. During the Yom Kippur War, intelligence provided by Selim enabled Israel to score many accurate hits against Egyptian forces, destroying many anti aircraft missile bases at a heavy cost of men and material to Egypt. The Israeli strikes were so accurate that the Egyptian side became convinced insider informants must be involved. Eventually her husband was discovered and faced a certain death sentence. The Egyptians, however, decided to use him as a double agent for some time. Also, by not arresting him, he gave Heba Selim the impression that their spying activities were not compromised. Trial and Execution Heba was arrested after Egyptian intelligence lured her to Tripoli, Libya on the pretext that her father had been hospitalized there, and arrested her upon arrival, transferring her to an Egyptian aircraft to return her to Egypt, with the cooperation of Libyan authorities. The Egyptian ambassador to France, whose home she had often visited, had been instrumental in the plan. Her husband was also arrested. Selim was tried for high treason while he was court-martialled. They were both convicted and sentenced to death. After exhausting all appeals, including a petition for clemency by U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger to President Anwar Sadat that was denied, Heba was executed by hanging as prescribed by law for civilian convicts, while El Fikki was executed by firing squad since he was a commissioned army officer at the time of conviction, as prescribed by Egyptian military law. Cultural depictions Heba Selim is the basis of the Egyptian film Al sood ila al haweyah (Climbing to the abyss). One of the most famous lines in Egyptian cinema history is said at the end of the movie as Abla (Heba Selim's name in the movie), portrayed by , is flown to Egypt after her capture in Libya. As the plane approaches Cairo airport, her escorting intelligence officer points at the pyramids and the Nile and then, in a most condemning tone he says \\"we heya dee Masr ya abla\\" (and this is Egypt Abla).

With a distinctive construction history dating to about 1720, it serves as an important window into the construction methods and techniques of the 18th and 19th centuries. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The John Cady House stands in a rural residential area of southwestern Tolland, at the southwest corner of Mile Hill Road (Connecticut Route 31) and Cedar Swamp Road. It is a -story wood-frame structure, five bays wide, with a large central chimney. Its main entrance is centered on the front facade, framed by Greek Revival pilasters with a corniced entablature. Although its exterior is uniform, the building is structurally composed of two separate buildings which were butted together, leading to an interior layout that is unusual. The central chimney appears to have been modified at the time the two sections were joined, in order to accommodate a larger kitchen fireplace. The roof frame shows evidence that the house was once covered by a gambrel roof, instead of the present gable. and The exact construction date of the house is uncertain. A house is known to have been standing in this general area around 1720, which may have been this structure's southern portion. Furthermore, its construction methods appear to be more typical of Massachusetts than Connecticut in this period, suggesting it may have been built by the elder John Cady, who hailed from Groton, Massachusetts. The property belonged to a younger John Cady from 1726 to 1755. The road was relocated during the 18th century, from the west side of the house to the east, resulting in the transfer of the house to the Weston family. Elijah Weston was documented to operate a tavern here between 1790 and 1800. It is unknown where the name \\"Babcock Tavern\\", a historic 19th-century name, originates, since no Babcocks are documented as having lived in this area.

It was formed in 1980 as Family Entertainment Network by Jared F. Brown, Stephen W. Griffin, and Seldon O. Young. The company has produced several animated films and TV series since the 80's which includes the Animated Stories from the New Testament, The Swan Princess, The King and I, and The Scarecrow among others.  History  Nest Family Entertainment started as Family Entertainment Network in 1980. The company was founded by Jared F. Brown, Stephen W. Griffin, and Seldon O Young. It first released dramatized audio cassettes sets that are based on stories from the Holy Bible. In 1981, Nest Family Entertainment founded another company, Living History Productions, to release dramatized audio cassettes set that are based on beloved principles of hero classics. The studio was owned by Richard Rich's animation studios Rich Entertainment from 1987 to 1993, finally it was renamed to Rich Animation Studios, then Family Entertainment Network was renamed to Family Entertainment. Also in the fall of 1994, Family Entertainment was renamed to Nest Entertainment. In 1996, Living History Productions was folded into Nest Entertainment. Rich Animation Studios was sold to Indian animation company Crest Animation Studios in 2000, and changed its name to RichCrest Animation Studios before being renamed again to Crest Animation Productions. Crest Animation Productions was shutdown in 2013 and folded into Splash Entertainment. After the president of Nest Family Entertainment Stephen W. Griffin has stepped down in 1994, Nest Family Entertainment and Rich Animation created the original 1994 animated feature film, The Swan Princess, with New Line Cinema distributing (now distributed by Sony Pictures). The intellectual property rights for The Swan Princess art, logo, and title have been transferred to Swan Princess Partners Utah LLC (DBA Swan Princess Partners). Swan Princess Partners is also owned by Jared F. Brown and Seldon O.

It is just one of several thousand hillforts to have been constructed around Great Britain during the British Iron Age, for reasons that are still debatable. The main fort at Dinas Powys was constructed on the northernmost point of the hill in either the third or 2nd century BCE, with two further constructs, known as the Southern Banks, being built further down on the southern end of the hill in the following 1st century BCE. It appears that occupation at the site ceased during the period of Roman Britain, but was re-inhabited by an Early Mediaeval settlement in the 5th century CE, who constructed further additions to the fort. The site was subsequently excavated by a team of archaeologists led by Leslie Alcock from 1954 through to 1958. The hillfort, which was called the dinas () by Welsh speaking locals, is probably the reason why the neighbouring village was named Dinas Powys, and archaeologists excavating the site in the mid 20th century decided to rename the hillfort after the settlement, with excavator Leslie Alcock remarking that \\"it therefore seemed appropriate by a kind of back-formation to restore the village name to [the fortifications]\\". History Dinas Powys hillfort is located on the eastern end of the Vale of Glamorgan, a county borough at the southernmost tip of Wales that geologically comprises predominantly Lias limestone in the south and Carboniferous limestone in the north. The eastern end in particular \\"is dissected into flat-topped, steep-sided ridges and hills by deep and narrow river valleys, so that in detail the relief of the south- east Glamorgan is a tangle of minor [landscape] features.\\"Alcock 1963. p. 01-03. The hillfort was constructed on one such of these geographical features, a whale-back hill that is just over a quarter of a mile in length.Alcock 1963. p. 03. The fort was built on the northerly tip of the whale-back hill, the highest and narrowest point of the vicinity. It had \\"no visible defences; but on the west side there is a single bank, on the east two banks, while the southern approach is barred by no fewer than four ramparts.\\"Alcock 1963. p. 05. It was located near to the harbour at the estuary of the River Ely, which would have been an important entry point for trade in later prehistory:Alcock 1963. p. 04. there is certainly evidence for its use as a harbour in the Early and Middle Bronze Age, several centuries prior to the hillfort's initial construction.Fox 1936. =Iron Age and Romano- British periods= Phase One at the Dinas Powys site, which comprised purely of the hillfort on the northernmost tip of the hill, began construction during the Iron Age, at some point in the third or 2nd century BCE. It was evidently settled by a community at this time, as is evidenced by large quantities of Iron Age pottery at the site. There are also several postholes that have been excavated inside the fort, indicating that there may well have been buildings constructed inside of it at this period. Phase Two of Dinas Powys began construction in the Late Iron Age, during the 1st century BCE, and saw the building of the two Southern Banks, which were located on the southern end of the hill, away from the main fort. According to excavator Leslie Alcock, these two defences did not appear to have ever been completed, for instance there was no evidence that a gateway was ever built between them, something which would have meant the banks were of little use in a defensive situation.Alcock 1963. p. 19-21. Throughout much of the 20th century, archaeologists thought that hillforts were constructed to be defensive structures in a society that was dominated by warfare, or the threat of warfare between different tribal groups. Indeed, excavator Leslie Alcock remarked that the main Dinas Powys fort was \\"heavily defended\\", but that the Southern Banks were far less defensible. In the 1st century CE, southern Britain was conquered and absorbed into the Roman Empire, leading to the period of Roman Britain, when Roman and native Iron Age British culture merged into something Romano-British. This period would last until the 4th century, when the Roman armies left Britain. During this period, the Vale of Glamorgan saw \\"intensive settlement\\", with the construction of at least three Roman villas in the local area, each presumably with its own agricultural estate.Alcock 1963. p. 42. During this Romano- British period, it is debatable whether the Dinas Powys hillfort continued to be occupied, for no major features were constructed on the site, and only a small amount of Romano-British artefacts have been uncovered there, whereas other local settlement sites in the Vale of Glamorgan contain far greater quantities of Romano-British artefacts. As Alcock noted, \\"Seen in its local context, the Phase 3 [i.e. Romano-British] material can scarcely amount to a Romano-British occupation of the site.\\"Alcock 1963. p. 22-25. =Early Mediaeval period= Settlement and subsistence A new period of occupation at the hillfort began in the post-Roman, Early Mediaeval era, that which the excavators referred to as the \\"Early Christian period\\". Dating to the 5th and 6th centuries CE, this saw the construction of Phase Four of the site, which saw at least two buildings, possibly made out of stone rather than wood, being built within the fort.Alcock 1963 p. 26. Archaeologists interpreted one of these, House I, as being a hall that was lived in by the local lord and his family, whilst House II \\"was probably therefore a store- house or barn, though it is not improbable that servants or labourers and their families slept there.\\"Alcock 1963 p. 33. Phase Four also saw the construction of a number of hearths within the fort, some of which \\"were industrial rather than domestic\\", suggesting that the site was being used for production of metal goods as well as, or rather than settlement.Alcock 1963 p. 31-32. Examining the remnants of these hearths, excavators came to the conclusion that there was both a blacksmith and a jeweller active on the site, and that these skilled craftsmen were likely migrants from Ireland who had come to the area looking for work, where the lord of Dinas Powys had employed them.Alcock 1963 p. 47, 59. It was amongst some of these hearths that excavators found the burial of a human child approximately five years old, which they believe dates to this period, and that \\"Slight though the grave was, the body had obviously been laid out with care. It recalls the burials found within, or immediately adjacent to, Romano-British settlements, and clearly looks back to native, pre-Christian traditions\\" despite probably being a Christian burial.Alcock 1963 p. 30. There was also much refuse produced by the Early Mediaeval individuals living at the fort, leading to the depositing of this rubbish in several large rubbish pits (middens) along the eastern end of the site; the sheer volume of this rubbish led Alcock to state in 1963 that it was \\"the largest assemblage of Early Christian material so far recovered in Wales and the Marches.\\"Alcock 1963 p. 31, 34. \\"To judge from the archaeological material which has been recovered, the main basis of the Dinas Powys economy [in the Early Mediaeval] was stock-raising\\", primarily of cattle and sheep. Unusually for the area however, it appears from the excavated animal bones that most of the livestock was slaughtered before they were capable of reproduction, something indicating that – with the exception of the pigs – the numbers of livestock would not be sustainable unless new imports were being regularly brought in from elsewhere.Alcock 1963 p. 35-37. As well as eating such meat, the inhabitants of Dinas Powys hillfort apparently ate bread, as rotary querns used for grinding grain, likely locally grown, were found at the site.Alcock 1963 p. 41. \\"A subsidiary role in the Dinas Powys economy was played by metalworking\\", and it was the produce from both the livestock and metalworking that the elite traded in order to gain access to luxury goods – such as wine, oil and pottery – from elsewhere around the Irish Sea and even from southern Europe.Alcock 1963 p. 44, 55. Defence There was also apparently attempts to build further defences for the site in this period, as archaeologists believe that one of the ditches and banks around the site, which they referred to as Ditch II and Bank II, were constructed in this century, because they \\"differ significantly\\" from the other ditches and banks (which are known to be Late Mediaeval in date), being poorly constructed in comparison to them.Alcock 1963 p. 27. Excavator Leslie Alcock remarked on the relatively poor defensive qualities of the hillfort during the 5th century, remarking that: :The slightness of these defences may seem out of keeping with the evidence to be adduced for the richness and importance of Dinas Powys in the Early Christian period, but is not inconsistent with other evidence from Welsh sites defended in late [fourth] and succeeding centuries. As Dinas Emrys, for instance, a position of great natural strength was chosen, but the defensive wall was only some 8 to 10 feet wide. At Carreg-y-Ilam the enclosure walls had similar dimensions.Alcock 1963 p. 28. =Late Mediaeval period= Following the Norman invasion of Wales, in which the Norman-dominated English monarchy occupied Wales, it appears that Dinas Powys continued to be used. The Norman phase of construction and settlement, which took place in the 11th and 12th centuries CE, and which is known as Phase 5, involved the construction of Banks 1, 3 and 4, greatly making the site more defensive.Alcock 1963. p. 73. As Alcock noted, \\"The defences of Phase 5 were clearly well contrived and laboriously constructed.\\"Alcock 1963. p. 79. A further wave of construction, known as Phase 6, took place later in the Norman era. Remarking as to the fort's usage in this period, which saw further defensification, Alcock noted that the \\"more likely explanation is that the Dinas Powys ring-work was not a fortified residence; it was a military strong-point, occupied only at times of need, perhaps by a tented garrison\\".Alcock 1963. p. 93. =Modern period= In the 19th century, the hillfort appeared on the first edition of the Ordnance Survey's one-inch map, where it was referred to as Beili Castell, a name which, according to Alcock, \\"appears to have no real justification.\\" It was subsequently omitted from several later OS maps.Alcock 1963. p. 06. Excavation The excavations at Dinas Powys hillfort. The first time that archaeologists took an interest in the monument was in 1913, when it was referred to as \\"a British camp in the woods of Cwrt-yr-Alta\\" by a Mrs H. Lewis in a 1913 edition of the Archaeologica Cambrensis.Alcock 1963 p. 06. The noted archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler, who would later go on to excavate the prominent hillfort of Maiden Castle, Dorset, then referred to the Dinas Powys site in the 1921–23 Bulletin of the newly founded Board of Celtic Studies. Wheeler himself took a particular interest in the monument, producing the first accurate plan of the fort for the National Museum of Wales. An actual project designed to excavate the hillfort was developed by professors at the newly founded archaeology department of University College, Cardiff in the mid-1950s. In 1953, archaeologists Sir Cyril Fox, Dr V.E. Nash-Williams and Dr H.N. Savoy examined a variety of sites in southern Wales to decide which would be the best training site for the university's students, and eventually came to the conclusion that the Dinas Powys hillfort would be best. After gaining permission to excavate from Sir Herbert Merrett of the Cwrt-yr-Ala Estate Company and the Forestry Commission (the owners and tenants of the land respectively), and getting a small monetary grant from the Board of Celtic Studies, excavation began in January 1954.Alcock 1963 p. 08. The excavations continued for four years, till 1958, mostly at weekends in spring and early summer, and also at Easter from 1954 through to 1957, and during July–August 1958. Following the financial support of the Board of Celtic Studies, grants were later made for the excavation by Glamorgan County Council, the Cambrian Archaeological Association, the British Academy, the Haverfield Trustees and the Society of Antiquaries. Most of the work was undertaken by volunteers, namely students from University College Cambridge, as well as from community archaeological societies both from Wales and from the rest of Britain. For the back-filling however, manual workmen were employed due to the more physical nature of the labour. The excavators decided to leave certain areas unexcavated, stating that \\"Sufficient areas have been left unexcavated for future workers to have some chance of testing both the observation of facts and the hypotheses presented [in their conclusions].\\"Alcock 1963 p. 15. One of the head excavators, Leslie Alcock subsequently published a book on the hillfort, entitled Dinas Powys: An Iron Age, Dark Age and Early Medieval Settlement in Glamorgan, through the University of Wales Press in 1963. One reviewer of Alcock's work, P.V. Addyman, writing in the Ulster Journal of Archaeology, remarked that the book, which was \\"excellently produced by the University Press, goes beyond the normal scope of an excavation report and reviews the considerable implications of these discoveries; implications which, in the Dark Age phases at least, affect the whole of the Irish Sea culture province.\\"Addyman 1966. p. 145.

During that time, Ravenna saw a great renovation, in particular under Theodoric the Great (454–526). During his rule, Ravenna saw many of its finest monuments constructed or renovated, including the Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo, the Palace of Theoderic, and Mausoleum of Theodoric. Many of these monuments reflected Theodoric's, as well as the Goths as a people, religion of Arian Christianity. Though an Arian Christian himself, Theodoric's rule was a time of religious tolerance in the city of Ravenna. His religious tolerance extended also to forging a balance between the Romans and Goths in Ravenna. Theodoric attempted to model Ravenna as a capital equivalent to that of Rome or Constantinople and as such was a defender of classical antiquity in a western world that saw much of its classical heritage disappearing. Ravenna's newfound ascendance did not last under the successors of Theodoric as they lacked the respect that Theodoric commanded of both the Romans and Goths within his capital and the empire as a whole, in particular his grandson Athalaric who succeeded him at the age of eight under the regency of his mother Amalasuintha.Deliyannis, p. 137 The Gothic Kingdom eventually fell to the invasions by Belisarius as part of Justinian's ambitious plans of reconquering the territories of the western empire lost to Germanic invasions. History =Odovacar= In 476 the last emperor of the Western Roman Empire, Romulus Augustus, was forced to abdicate under invasions by Goths led by Odovacar. Upon the sacking of Rome by these Goths, Odovacar declared himself King of Italy and was able to conquer the peninsula as well as much of the \\"Dalmatian coast\\". Odovacar drew the ire of the imperial court at Constantinople as \\"a barbarian, a non-Roman, had deposed the Roman emperor in the original heartland of the empire. He had taken on the hated royal title and was getting ready to rule in the emperor’s place...\\"Wolfram, p. 185 Odovacar, however, issued his coinage in the name of the emperor Nepos, whom Constantinople had never removed its recognition of when Romulus had assumed the imperial title therefore painting himself as merely overthrowing a previous usurper to the imperial throne.Wolfram p. 185 =Theodoric and the Establishment of the Ostrogothic Kingdom= Theodoric's Rise to power Theodoric, from the age of seven had lived in the imperial court at Constantinople after a revolt by his father had been subdued. He returned to his own people, the Amal branch of the Goths, at the age of 18 in 471 and became the leader of his people in 474 upon the death of his father.Dellyanis p. 109 Upon ascension to leadership he established himself as a capable leader both militarily and politically. He fought various wars both for and against the East Roman Empire as well as wars against other Gothic factions. He was recognized politically by Constantinople, who bestowed upon him first the title of patricius and named as magister militum Praesentalis in 476 and was appointed consul of the Eastern Empire in 484. War with Odovacar By the late 480's Theodoric had become leader of the most dominant Gothic force and found himself leading his people into Italy against Odovacar. There is much debate as to whether this was ordered by the Emperor Zeno or whether it was Theodoric's own decision. Primary sources conflict on this score. The Anonymus Valesianus, claims Theodoric moved on Italy at the urging of Zeno: > Theodoric stipulated with [Zeno], that if Odoacer should be vanquished, in > return for his own labors in Odoacer's place he should rule in his stead > only until the arrival of Zeno. Therefore, when the patrician Theodoric came > from the city of Nova with the Gothic people, he was sent by the emperor > Zeno from the regions of the Orient, in order to defend Italy for > him.Anonymus Valesianus 2.49 -Anonymus Valesianus 2.49 Contrary to the account provided in Anonymus Valesianus, Jordanes makes the claim in his work, The Origin and Deeds of the Goths, Getica, that the idea was Theodoric's: > So [Theodoric] chose rather to seek a living by his own exertions...After > pondering these matters, he said to the Emperor: \\"Though I lack nothing in > serving your Empire, yet if Your Piety deem it worthy, be pleased to hear > the desire of my heart\\"...\\"The western country, long ago governed by the > rule of your ancestors and predecessors...--wherefore is it now shaken by > the tyranny of the Torcilingi and the Rugi? Send me there with my race. Thus > if you but say the word, you may be freed from the burden of expense here, > and, if by the Lord's help I shall conquer, the fame of Your Piety shall be > glorious there.Jordanes, 57, 289–291 Jordanes, Getica LXII 289–291 In either case Theodoric and his Goths marched on Italy in 489 and waged war on Odovacar. Theodoric's forces quickly forced Odovacar to flee to Ravenna and in short succession they captured both Verona and Milan. In Milan both secular and ecclesiastical leaders, as well as Odovacar's commander-in-chief Tufa – though he would later betray Theodoric – and many of the defeated troops who joined Theodoric, welcomed him into the city as a representative of the emperor.Dunlap, p. 281 In the summer of 490, with Odovacar back on the offensive, Alaric II of the Visigoths, in a rare moment of Gothic solidarity,Wolfram p. 188 sent troops to aid Theodoric in his efforts to remove Odovacar from power. Odoacer was forced to retreat once again into Ravenna, where Theodoric besieged him for two more years until Theodoric was finally able to gather the ships necessary to mount an effective blockade of Ravenna, which could only be effectively attacked from the sea. Victory over Odovacar It was not until 493 that a peace agreement was finally reached between Theodoric and Odovacar. It was negotiated by John, Bishop of Ravenna, and stated that Theodoric and Odovacar were to both occupy Ravenna and jointly rule over Italy. Ten days later Odovacar was killed at a banquet held jointly with Theodoric. Procopius writes of the event in The Wars of Justinian, The Gothic war: \\"And for some time they observed the agreement; but afterward [Theodoric] caught [Odovacar], as they say, plotting against him, and bidding him to a feast with treacherous intent slew him...\\"Procopius, History of the Wars, The Gothic War. Book V.1. From That point on Theodoric had become the undisputed king of Italy, establishing the Ostrogothic Kingdom, headed at Ravenna, that would last until 553.  Fall  Byzantine army led by general Narses of Armenian origin besieged Totila in the Battle of Taginae. Totila was killed in the battle. Narses conquered Ravenna without any opposition and thus ended dominance of Ostrogoths in the city. Theodoric's Ravenna =Buildings and architecture= Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo The Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo was the main Arian church of Theodoric's Ravenna. Immediately near Theodoric's palace, it was dedicated in 504 to Christ the Redeemer. The 9th century historian Agnellus, in his description of the Basilica, tells of Theodoric's in particular imprint upon it says in Liber Pontificalis Ecclesiae Ravennatis \\"[Sant'Apollinaire Nuovo] in this city, which King Theodoric founded, which is called the Golden Heaven... Indeed in the apse, if you look closely, you will find the following written above the windows in stone letters: 'King Theodoric made this church from its foundations in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.'\\"Agnellus, p. 107 The Basilica is noted especially for the numerous mosaics that adorn its interior. There is twenty six mosaic depiction of the Christological cycle that, while other iconographical depictions were known to exist at the time, there is not known of any that were as extensive as the one that was present in Theodoric's Sant' Apollinaire Nuovo.Dellyanis pp. 153–56 Also present in the church are 32 statues meant to represent, in a nonspecific manner, the biblical authors.Dellyanis p. 158 Each one of the statues in their hands has either a book or a scroll, nine with the former and twenty-one with the latter. Each has different appearance characteristics different from their counterparts and none are named or labeled, meaning that they are not saints. There is also a depiction of Christ and in imperial regalia: He sits upon a gem studded throne draped in the imperial purple and gold. The halo above him and the cross are also covered in gems. Upon a throne beside him, the Virgin Mary who, though also on a similar jewel encrusted throne, is not adorned in the regalia of an empress. Theodoric's Palace Theodoric's Palace at Ravenna was one of many that he constructed around Italy, however, with Ravenna as his capital and main residence the palace there was the main palace by which he lived and ruled and was adorned as such. The Anonymus Valesianus tells that Theodoric \\"...completely finished the palace, but did not dedicate it.\\"Anonymus Valesianus 2.71 tr. in Delyannis, p. 119 What this shows is that Theodoric, though he completed the palace, was not the one commissioned its original construction.Deliyannis 119 Cassiodorus in his Orationum Reliquiae states \\"The marble surface shines with the same color as gems, the scattered gold gleams. .. , the gifts of mosaic work delineate the circling rows of stones; and the whole is adorned with marble hues where the waxen pictures are displayed.\\"Cassiodorus Orationum Reliquae 2, tr. in Deliyannis, p. 120 Mausoleum of Theodoric The Mausoleum of Theodoric was one of his crowning building achievements. The mausoleum itself was constructed during his lifetime and was described in the Anonymus Valesianus as such: \\"During his lifetime he had made himself a mausoleum of squared blocks of stone, a work of extraordinary size, and sought out a huge rock to place upon it.\\"Anonymus Valesianus 2.96. tr. in Deliyannis, p. 124 His goal seemed to echo that of the burial place of Mausolus of Halicarnassus, one of Jerome's seven wonders of the ancient world.Deliyannis p. 124 The style of the building echoed the dual nature of Theodoric's rule. There is much debate as to whether the mausoleum is a \\"Roman\\" or \\"Gothic\\" monument and this was perhaps as Theodoric intended it, having himself to rule over both the Goths and Romans equally within his kingdom. =Religion and Tolerance in Theodoric's Ravenna= The Ostrogoths, though having power themselves, by no means supplanted the entire Roman population of Ravenna, Italy, or of the ruling administration. The distinction between Roman and Goth was made even more evident by the different sects of Christianity that they practiced: Catholic Christianity and Arianism respectively. Arians and the Orthodoxy The differences between Romans and Goths in Ostrogothic Ravenna were never as clearly defined as they were along religious lines. The Goths followed the Arian branch of Christianity, while the Romans practiced Orthodoxy. Both considered the other to be heretics. Theodoric, however, was the keystone in maintaining order amongst the peoples that he ruled, commanding respect and fear in equal measure from both Romans and Goths alike.Delyannis p. 136 Upon his taking of power the Orthodox bishops and leaders of Ravenna were allowed to keep their posts, but not had to enter into power sharing with Arian counterparts.Delyannis pp. 187–88 In his Variae Cassiodorus has letters he penned for Theodoric that show his toleration as well as protection of the Orthodox Church. In one such letter Theodoric had Cassiodorus write, this time to Faustus, a Roman prefect, saying \\"'The Defensores of the Holy Church of Milan want to be enabled to buy as cheap as possible the things which they need for the relief of the poor; and they say that we have bestowed this favor on the Church of Ravenna. 'Your Magnificence will therefore allow them to single out some one merchant who shall buy for them in the market, without being subject to monopoly, siliquaticum, or the payment of gold-fee.\\"Cassiodorus Variae 2.30 Toleration of the Jewish population In line with his toleration of other Christian groups within his empire and in Ravenna in particular, Theodoric had a long history of tolerance when it came to the Jews of his empire and in his capital. There are numerous accounts of Jewish persecution throughout the Kingdom, all of which was dealt with in a manner of fairness by Theodoric. Cassiodorus tells us of these events in the letters he wrote for the King. He both allowed for the Jews of Genoa to rebuild and remodel their synagogueCassiodorus Variae 2.27 as well as assured them that the privileges awarded then since antiquity would remain in place.Cassiodorus Variae 4.33 Rome and Ravenna had similar occurrences with their Jewish populations and Theodoric dealt with them accordingly. They both saw a major attack on much of their Jewish synagogues and population and in both cases Theodoric dealt with the Christians as the aggressors and requested that the attacks cease and placed blame for the attacks on them. In Ravenna, the pretense for the attack was that the Jews of the city had ridiculed Christians and even thrown holy water into the river. Theodoric responded by levying a fine on all Roman citizens of Ravenna to pay for the damages to the Jewish synagogues.Bachrach, p. 31 Legacy of Theodoric =Theodoric's successors= Theodoric died in 526 and his kingdom was left to his then eight-year-old grandson Athalaric, who was under the auspices of his mother and regent Amalasuntha. She was Roman educated and ought to pass that on to her son. She is praised heavily by Cassiodorus in a letter to the Senate of RomeCassiodorus Variae 11.1, 6–8 and Procopius describes her leadership skills saying \\"[Amalasuntha] proved to be endowed with wisdom and regard for justice in the highest degree, displaying to a great extent the masculine temper.\\"Procopius Book V.2 The Goths of the court however were not attracted to the way in which she was raising her son and their King. They sought to give a more \\"barbarian\\" education to the young king – one that involved much more drinking and debauchery – and it eventually led to his death in 534. Amalasuntha, in the very next year, after a brief attempt at ruling herself with her cousin before he exiled her, was murdered. This murder gave Justinian the pretense by which he could launch his war in 535 that eventually destroyed the Gothic Kingdom and ended Ravenna's period of imperial aspirations. =A third great capital of Rome?= Theodoric's legacy on Ravenna remains to this day in the buildings he constructed and the improvements that he made to the city. Under Theodoric Ravenna became a center of education and culture, and anyone who wished an audience with Theodoric, had to travel to Ravenna to do so.Delyannis p. 115 Since the establishment of Constantinople it had become customary in the Roman Empire to show both Rome and Constantinople on coins. Theodoric introduced during his reign a new Rome- Ravenna political iconography and went so far as to have any land grants to be picked up by his soldiers be done in person, in Ravenna.Delyannis p. 116 C.L.R. Fletcher writes on the achievements of Theodoric: \\"Ravenna, however, remained Theodoric's capital...the thirty-six years of Theodoric's rule afford rather a pretty picture, a sort of Indian summer during which Italy recovered a good deal of prosperity on the eve of her final ruin.\\"Fletcher, p. 104 He did not however achieve this goal of uplifting the city to the status held by Rome and Constantinople. Theodoric expended energy and treasure enriching Ravenna in an attempt to bring to it the status accorded to both cities. He constructed both religious and secular buildings in imitation of those in the great imperial cities, but, as in the imperial era, Ravenna's prestige was actively rivaled by that of Rome. To exemplify this fact, even during Theodoric's reign while silver coins were minted in Ravenna, gold coins were minted exclusively in Rome.Metlich, p. 38 Nevertheless, Fletcher cites Theodoric as one of the saviors of Roman culture: \\"His care for ancient buildings was exemplary; he enjoined the prefect to restore Pompey's theatre; he carried on the drainage of the Pomptine marshes, and he was a great restorer of aqueducts. Indeed, it is quite possible to maintain that but for 'this Goth,' the remains of classical antiquity, whether built or written, might have perished altogether in Italy.\\"Fletcher p. 103 References Bibliography =Primary sources= *Agnellus Liber Pontificalis Ecclesiae Ravennatis tr.

The plan was to have local acts perform in the early afternoon, national acts perform in the late afternoon to early evening, and then a headliner close out each night inside TD Ameritrade Park.

It is located just north of the border with Suffolk and is sometimes misdescribed as lying in that county. It is situated in of countryside in the Waveney Valley just outside the village of Ellingham. Description Built from grey brick in the 18th century during the Georgian period, Ellingham Hall is a three-storey building with five bays, a large central doorway and ten bedrooms. It was modified in the Victorian period with the addition of a large window on either side with four rounded windows and parapet. Two bay wings stand on either side of the main building, standing two and a half stories high, with ground floor windows set in blank arches. At the rear is a Victorian porte-cochère set on Ionic columns. Ownership The hall was bought in 1799 by the Reverend William Johnson (d. 1807) from the trustees of Michael Hicks Beach. At the time the surrounding estate was common land for the village of Ellingham, but Johnson was granted Parliamentary permission for its enclosure in 1806. It passed to his daughter Maria and her husband Henry Smith, who laid out a park in the estate and probably rebuilt the hall at around this time. Colonel John Smith of the 2nd Madras Light Cavalry inherited the hall in 1846 after Maria's death. A keen hunter, Smith brought back to Ellingham Hall the remains of six of the 99 tigers he is said to have shot during his tour of duty in India. Ellingham Hall is currently owned by Vaughan Smith, former British Army officer, journalist and founder of the Frontline Club in London. The estate is the site of a large organic farm managed by Smith himself along with two employees. The produce is served in the Frontline Club in its public restaurant. According to its Facebook page, Ellingham Hall is available for \\"lakeside wedding receptions, within a traditional parkland and with the optional support of our own first-rate catering.\\" The estate also offers game shooting. The Smiths have run a shoot on the estate for at least four generations; Vaughan Smith himself hosts the events, saying that he is \\"partial to shooting\\", following in the footsteps of his equally enthusiastic father and grandfather. =Refuge= In December 2010, Ellingham Hall became a refuge for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who was released on bail on condition that he stayed at a fixed address – namely Ellingham Hall, which Smith offered as a temporary place of residence for Assange. The bail conditions were jokingly referred to as \\"mansion arrest\\" by one of Assange's lawyers. Assange remained at Ellingham until December 2011.

This design was then used in seven more lighthouses, by order of establishment, Grassy Hill Light, Goods Island Light, Bay Rock Light, Old Caloundra Light, North Point Hummock Light (demolished), Gatcombe Head Light (demolished) and Bulwer Island Light. With the installation of the second lighthouse in 1895 it became the front light in the range. In the 1920s, the lighthouse was relocated to Station Point, about northeast.

It consists of animated TV episodes and a website with online games. The plot follows two young dragons called Spirit and Imm who are trying to restore freedom to their kingdom of Moltonia from the reign of the oppressive Mayor Crag. As Spirit and Imm stand up for their rights based on the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms they unlock the seven forgotten Pillars of Freedom and defeat the mayor in the coming election. The seven pillars of freedom are Freedom of conscience, Freedom of expression, Freedom of speech, Freedom of assembly, Freedom of association, Freedom of the press, and the Freedom to protest. The online quest game explores the concepts introduced in the television shorts in greater detail regarding the Charter freedoms and topics of municipal civics and allows kids to vote on what they think the characters should do next and receive feedback on these choices. In season 2 the issues of municipal civics and civil planning are explored in greater detail as Hudley must learn how to balance passing laws to protect the dragons of Moltonia while not infringing on the fundamental freedoms she agreed to protect. Season 1 Spirit and Imm are exploring the forbidden caves outside the city walls when they come across a glowing shard of crystal with ancient writing on it. When Spirit makes the choice to pick the shard up and take it into town to see what it is, she unknowingly unlocks the first pillar of freedom, Freedom of conscience, which rises from the ground in the city square. After being escorted back into town by the mayor's guards, Spirit goes to ask her Uncle Igneous about the pillar shard and Imm goes to work at Hudley's Salon. The mayor passes a law that forbids the possession of any Pillar of Freedom and takes the shard from spirit. In order to find out more about the Pillars of freedom, Spirit and Imm go to the library where they meet Abraxis, the librarian. Their desire to learn more about whatever they want unlocks the pillar of Freedom of Expression. The mayor makes it illegal to take books out of the library and Imm and Spirit are forced to flee. Abraxis tells them to stand on a soap box in the town square and announce that all dragons are created equal. Upon doing so Imm and Spirit unlock the pillar of Freedom of speech. The mayor makes it illegal to speak in public places, so Spirit and Imm convince their friend Hudley to run for mayor in the upcoming election. Hudley holds a successful campaign rally where she raps about her platform, unlocking the pillar of Freedom of Assembly before the party is broken up by another new law. Shortly after that the mayor makes it illegal for Imm and Spirit to associate with Hudley so the kids try various disguises and distractions to get past the guards, unlocking the pillar of Freedom of Association. Mayor Crag brings Imm and Spirit into his office and makes them agree to stop talking about the pillars or else he will have them arrested and put in prison. Imm and Spirit go to the local news and enlist them to spread the word about the pillars for them and the city is swept up in Pillarmania where everyone is talking about the pillars, unlocking the pillar of Freedom of The Press. Mayor Crag has Spirit and Imm arrested and they are found guilty. Spirit is locked up in Stalcatraz detention centre and Imm is exiled to live with the indigenous Orig dragons outside the city walls. The Orig explain to Imm that they have been allowed to live by their own rules and traditions and they teach Imm how to fly and breathe fire. As Imm reflects on the injustices that have been done to him he produces a large column of fire that glows high above the city, Hudley sees it and is inspired to start a campaign to free Imm and Spirit. A large crowd assembled by Hudley protests outside of the mayor's office at city hall and the mayor outlaws protests. More and more dragons join the campaign and protest in spite of the law and they unlock the final pillar, the Freedom to Protest. Spirit and Imm are freed and the citizens of Moltonia elect Hudley as their new mayor. She promptly overturns many of the previous mayor's laws that restricted the civil rights of the dragons of Moltonia and the pillars shine bright in the town square.

Shenmue (1999) and Shenmue II (2001) were developed by Sega AM2 and published by Sega for Dreamcast. Shenmue III, developed by Suzuki's company Ys Net, was released for PlayStation 4 and Windows in 2019. The Shenmue games consist of open-world 3D environments interspersed with brawler battles and quick time events. They include elements of role-playing, life simulation and social simulation games, such as a day-and-night system, variable weather effects, non-player characters with daily schedules, and interactive elements such as vending machines, arcades, and minigames. The story follows teenage martial artist Ryo Hazuki as he travels through 1980s Japan and China in pursuit of his father's killer. The original Shenmue was the most expensive video game ever developed at the time, with an estimated production and marketing cost of US$47 to $70 million, though some of the development also covered Shenmue II. Despite attracting positive reviews and a cult following, the games were commercial failures and further installments entered development hell. In 2004, Sega announced a spin-off massively multiplayer online role-playing game, Shenmue Online, but it was not released. In December 2010, a social game, Shenmue City, was launched in Japan; it was shut down in December 2011. Shenmue III was released following a successful crowdfunding campaign, 18 years after the release of Shenmue II. High-definition ports of Shenmue and Shenmue II for Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One were released in 2018. History The Shenmue series was created by Yu Suzuki.Shenmue creator Yu Suzuki joined Sega in 1983 and went on to create several successful arcade games, including Hang-On (1985), Out Run (1986) and Virtua Fighter (1993). In comparison to arcade games, where the ideal experience was only a few minutes long, Suzuki wanted to make a longer experience. In 1996, he and Sega AM2 began developing a Saturn RPG based on the Virtua Fighter series. Shenmue creator: Story has 11 chapters, ideally '4 or 5 games' in the series In 1997, development moved to Sega's upcoming console, the Dreamcast, and the Virtua Fighter connection was dropped. By the time of the Dreamcast's release in Japan in November 1998, the game had been titled Shenmue. It became the most expensive game ever developed at the time, reported to have cost US$70 million; in 2011, Suzuki said the figure was closer to $47 million including marketing. Development also covered some of Shenmue II (2001), which was completed for a smaller figure, and possibly groundwork for future Shenmue games. Shenmue was released on December 29, 1999 in Japan, November 8, 2000 in North America, and December 1, 2000 in Europe. Shenmue II was released for Dreamcast in 2001 in Japan and Europe only; an Xbox port followed in 2002 in Japan, Europe and North America. Despite attracting positive reviews and a cult following, neither game made a profit and Shenmue III entered a period of development hell lasting over a decade. Suzuki remained at Sega working on various projects which failed to see release, including Shenmue Online, a PC MMORPG announced in 2004. He established his own development company, Ys Net, in 2008 and left Sega in 2011. In 2010, Sega announced Shenmue City, a social game for the Mobage service. It was not released outside Japan and was shut down in December 2011. During Sony's presentation at the E3 conference on June 15, 2015, Suzuki announced a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign for Shenmue III, having licensed the series from Sega. Shenmue III became the fastest- funded and the highest-funded video game project in Kickstarter history, reaching its initial $2 million goal in just over nine hours, and earning $6.3 million in total. It was released on 19 November 2019 for PlayStation 4 and Windows. In 2015, Suzuki said he hoped the series would cover four or five games. Shenmue III includes a letter to fans from Suzuki expressing his hope to develop Shenmue IV. In 2020, Suzuki told IGN he had created Shenmue III \\"for the fans\\", and that he planned to give Shenmue IV more mainstream appeal. Gameplay In Shenmue I and II, the player controls teenage martial arts pupil Ryo Hazuki as he investigates his father's murder. The player explores the Yokosuka, Hong Kong and Guilin open worlds, searching for clues, examining objects and talking to non-player characters for information. The games feature a 3D fighting system similar to Sega's Virtua Fighter series; Ryo can fight multiple opponents at once, and can practice moves to increase their power. In quick time events, the player must press the right combination of buttons at the right moment to succeed. Shenmue I and II feature a level of detail considered unprecedented for games at the time of their release. Shops open and close, buses run to timetables, and characters have their own routines, each in accordance with the game's persistent clock. Ryo receives a daily allowance which can be spent on objects including food, raffle tickets, audio cassettes and capsule toys. There are several minigames; for example, Ryo can throw darts or play complete versions of Sega arcade games. He can earn money from minigames including driving forklift trucks, gambling, arm wrestling, fishing, and street fighting. The Dreamcast and HD versions of Shenmue II allows the player to import their save data from Shenmue, carrying over money, inventory items and martial arts moves.  Plot  IGN described the Shenmue story as a \\"revenge epic in the tradition of Chinese cinema\\". According to Suzuki, the first three games cover around 40% of Ryo's story. = Shenmue = In 1986 Yokosuka, Japan, teenage martial artist Ryo Hazuki returns to his family dojo to witness a confrontation between his father Iwao and a Chinese man, Lan Di. Lan Di demands Iwao give him a mysterious stone artifact, the dragon mirror. When he threatens to kill Ryo, Iwao tells him the mirror is buried under the cherry blossom tree outside. As Lan Di's men dig up the mirror, Lan Di mentions Zhao Sunming, whom Iwao allegedly killed in Mengcun, China. Lan Di delivers a finishing blow and Iwao dies in Ryo's arms. Ryo's investigation leads him to Master Chen in the Yokosuka harbor. Through Chen and his son Guizhang, Ryo learns that the dragon mirror taken by Lan Di is one of two mirrors. He locates the second, the phoenix mirror, in a basement hidden beneath his father's dojo. He defeats a local gang connected to Lan Di's organization, and Master Chen tells him to seek the aid of Master Xiuying in Hong Kong. Ryo boards a boat to China. = Shenmue II = Ryo (center), Ren (left) and Joy (right) in a scene from Shenmue II In Hong Kong, Ryo finds Master Xiuying Hong, but she refuses to help him, considering his quest for vengeance reckless. Ryo teams up with a gang leader, Wuying Ren, a free-spirited motorcyclist, Joy, and a street boy, Wong, to find Yuanda Zhu, who sent Ryo's father a letter warning him of Lan Di's intentions. Ryo and his allies locate Zhu in Kowloon Walled City, but are ambushed by the criminal Yellow Head organization and Zhu is kidnapped. Ryo rescues Zhu as Lan Di departs by helicopter. Zhu reveals that Lan Di killed Ryo's father because he believes Iwao killed his own father. Zhu also reveals that the mirrors will lead to the resurrection of the Qing Dynasty, the last imperial dynasty of China. Zhu advises Ryo to continue his search in the village of Bailu in Guilin, where Lan Di is also heading. In Guilin, Ryo meets a teenage girl, Shenhua Ling, whose family is connected to the legacy of the dragon and phoenix mirrors. She leads Ryo to a stone quarry on the village outskirts to meet her father, but discovers he is missing. = Shenmue III = Ryo learns that Lan Di's father, Sunming Zhao, once visited Bailu with Ryo's father to train under the local grandmaster. Zhao died under mysterious circumstances several years later. Ryo also discovers that the phoenix and dragon mirrors were created by Shenhua's great-grandfather at the request of the Chinese emperor. Ryo and Shenhua learn that Shenhua's father, Yuan, has been kidnapped by a local gang looking for the phoenix mirror. Ryo defeats two of the thugs, but is defeated by their boss, Yanlang. He convinces Sun, a local martial arts master, to teach him a powerful Bajiquan move, and uses it to defeat Yanlang. A village elder helps them discover a map to the treasure connected to the mirrors. Ryo fends off an attack from Chai, who reveals that Yuan and Xu have been taken to the city of Niaowu. In Niaowu, Ryo and Shenhua learn that a local gang, the Red Snakes, is holding Yuan and Xu hostage. Shenhua is tricked by a Chi You Men leader, Niao Sun. Ryo and his allies infiltrate the Chi You Men's castle and rescue Shenhua and her father. Ryo confronts Lan Di, but Lan Di easily defeats him. Niao Sun betrays Lan Di, and has her men burn the castle. Ryo, Ren and Shenhua continue their journey along the Great Wall of China. Reception The Shenmue series has received mostly positive reviews and attracted a cult following, with Shenmue I and II appearing in several \\"greatest video games of all time\\" lists. Shenmue III, released almost two decades later, received mixed reviews for its similarity to earlier games; some critics described it as outdated, while others praised its faithfulness to the franchise. Shenmue is credited for pioneering several game technologies; its large environments, wealth of options and level of detail have been compared to later open-world games including the Grand Theft Auto series, the Yakuza series, Fallout 3 (2008), and Deadly Premonition (2010).Brendan Main, Lost in Yokosuka , The EscapistShenmue: Creator Yu Suzuki Speaks Out , GamesTMYu Suzuki , IGN Shenmue is also credited for naming and popularizing the quick time event in modern games, which was featured in the Resident Evil, God of War, and Tomb Raider series.Adam LaMosca, On-Screen Help, In-Game Hindrance , The Escapist Music Several soundtracks have been released. A promotional album, Shenmue Juke Box, was packaged with the limited edition of the original game in Japan and North America, containing ten select tracks from the in-game cassette tapes. A soundtrack for the first game, Shenmue OST: Chapter 1: Yokosuka, was released in 2000. In September 2015, Data Discs released the Shenmue soundtrack on vinyl in three separate colored editions. In March 2016, the music of Shenmue was voted into the Classic FM Hall of Fame in 144th place.  Ports  In August 2018 Sega released high- definition ports of Shenmue and Shenmue II for Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The ports include new graphics and control options, improved user interfaces, and Japanese and English voices. Some details, such as product placement, are omitted, and cutscenes are presented in their original aspect ratio due to technical limitations. A more ambitious remaster of both games, featuring new models, textures and lighting, was canceled in 2017. Sega stated: \\"Working with original animations and characters but meshing them with enhanced HD visuals gave us a game that we felt would not meet the standards that Shenmue fans expect and deserve.\\" Television series An anime television series adaptation of Shenmue was announced on September 4, 2020 at the virtual Crunchyroll Expo. The series will be directed by Sakurai Chikara with Suzuki as executive producer. It will be animated by Telecom Animation Film with production management handled by Sola Entertainment. The series will comprise 13 episodes and will air English dubbed on Adult Swim's Toonami programming block in the United States and stream on Crunchyroll. Other appearances Ryo Hazuki is a playable character in Sega's mascot racer Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing. Ryo rides Naoyuki's motorbike and his special move features him driving a forklift, referencing his job at the Yokosuka Harbor. In 2012, Steve Lycett, executive producer of Sumo Digital, encouraged a fan- made poll on the SEGA Forums to determine which three SEGA characters the fans would like to see in Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed as downloadable content (DLC). Out of the 28 SEGA characters chosen by the forum, Ryo Hazuki had the majority vote ranking 1st, while Hatsune Miku ranked 2nd, and Segata Sanshiro ranked 3rd. On January 1, 2014, SEGA announced that Ryo will appear in the iOS and Android versions of Sonic & All Stars Racing Transformed which was released on January 2. On January 14, Ryo became available for purchase as DLC on Steam for the PC version of Sonic and All Stars Racing Transformed. In this game, Ryo rides an arcade-themed vehicle that switches between OutRun, Hang-On, and Space Harrier arcade cabinets depending on its form.

His work is characterized by a strongly marked simplicity, a cubic joining together of volumes, well- balanced spatial effects and a practical division of the floor-plan. He also practiced independently as an architect. In his designs, such as that for the Villa De Luifel (1924) in Wassenaar and the Villa Kessler or Slingerduin (1929) in Velsen, Wouda showed himself to be influenced by Frank Lloyd Wright.

In 1916, Wouda established himself as an architect in The Hague and one year later he was employed at the furniture firm of H. Pander & Zonen. He received the freedom to develop his own monumental style, clearly inspired by Wright but also influenced by his sojourn in Germany. In 1918-1919 he worked with Jan Wils (Alkmaar). His first well-known commission was for the interiors of the Villa Sevensteyn (1920–21) built by W.M. Dudok in Zorgvliet Park, The Hague.

Emile Shoufani Emile Shoufani, (, ; born 24 May 1947 in Nazareth) is an Israeli Arab Christian theologist, educator and activist for peace, archimandrite of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church. Fr. Emile Shoufani won UNESCO Prize for Peace Education (2003). Biography Emile Shoufani is the second of eight children raised by a Melkite father and an Orthodox mother. A few months after Israel's establishing in 1948, he was deported with his family. His grandfather and uncle were killed by the Israeli army during the first Arab-Israeli war. Raised by his grandmother, the latter taught him the value of forgiveness and the rejection of hatred. He became Choirboy at the church Eilaboun, which was built after 1949, he was soon fascinated by the liturgy and entered the seminary at the age of 13. Sent to France by his superiors at age 17, he studied philosophy and theology at the Seminary of Morsang-sur-Orge, then the seminary of St. Sulpice of Issy-les-Moulineaux in 1966. Priesthood As a priest in Nazareth, he taught at St. Joseph Seminary & High School at Nazareth where he became manager in 1976. In the college where half the students are Muslims and one Christian, Fr. Shoufani works every day to encourage the teaching of democratic values and dialogue. For over twenty years, encounters with Jewish schools are held three times a year. Jewish-Arab reconciliation Living in the heart of Israeli-Palestinian clashes, he understands that the best way to take a step towards reconciliation and dialogue is to teach the Holocaust. In late 2002, he organized the first Jewish-Arab travel to Auschwitz-Birkenau in May 2003. Jean Mouttapa, Director of Spirituality of Editions Albin Michel and a strong player in interreligious dialogue, he brings valuable assistance in organizing the French part of the pilgrimage and creates the association \\"Memory for Peace\\". This initiative supported by many intellectuals in Israel has attracted over 500 people and earned him the Unesco Prize for Peace Education in the same year. \\"Whoever is in front of me is someone who has a quality experience and not an identity card to brandish.\\" \\"Memory for Peace\\" \\"I appeal to my Arab brothers to join me together make a strong gesture, audacious and absolutely free. At the place that incarnates the atrocity of genocide, Auschwitz-Birkenau, we will proclaim our brotherhood with the millions of victims ... This act of remembrance will indicate our deep rejection of such inhuman It demonstrates our ability to understand the wounds of others. \\" \\"I appeal to my Jewish brethren to realize that the vast majority of Arab and Muslim world, the conflict tearing us apart is not religious, racial or even less. The Arab are not the successors of those who once wanted to wipe out the Jews as Jews. Like them heirs of the faith of Abraham, they are like them carrying light values. \\" \\"This trip to the darkest depths of the memory of mankind can in no way relativize the suffering of other people in other places and at other times. It will on the contrary bring us face our responsibilities now, and our vocation as human beings turned into aliving together.

The action was fought between a Royal Navy submarine and a dreadnought squadron of the Imperial German Navy. This action took place in the months after the Battle of Jutland and is significant in that it signalled a major shift in German naval policy. Background On 2 November 1916, the German U-boat suffered a mechanical failure while patrolling off the Norwegian coast. She sent a distress signal which was answered by , which was returning from patrol northabout from Ireland. They met and both U-boats started for the Danish coast, where they were to be met off the Bovsberg Light. The British meanwhile had intercepted this wireless traffic, and dispatched a destroyer force to intercept them, but were unsuccessful. However, on 4 November, both U-boats went aground in evening fog. Concerned that the Danes would intern the two U-boats—or that the British would find them—and mindful of the reputation of U-20 and her skipper as being responsible for the sinking of the ocean liner , Admiral Scheer—the commander of the High Seas Fleet—dispatched a salvage group, with a cover force, comprising destroyers of the 4th Half- Flotilla, with the battlecruiser . These were followed by the four dreadnoughts of 3rd Battle Squadron; , , and . This move was also detected by the British, who alerted the submarine , which was on patrol in the area. On the evening of 5 November, J1 encountered the Battle squadron and was able to attack. Action On 5 November, J1 was submerged on patrol in the North Sea, south-west of Horns Reef. Her skipper—Commander NF Laurence—had been alerted to the approach of the German forces, and at 11:50, in heavy seas, he spotted the four dreadnoughts of 3rd Battle Squadron just away. Laurence went deeper to manoeuvre into a firing position, but on rising to periscope depth he saw the dreadnoughts had changed course and were moving away. Surfacing to take advantage of J1s higher surface speed, but risking detection by the Squadrons destroyer escort, Laurence again moved into a firing position and at 12:08 dived to launch a spread of four torpedoes. Two of these hit, striking Grosser Kurfurst astern and Kronprinz on the bow. Both were damaged, but were able to return to base under their own steam. J1 had not been seen by any of the screening destroyers during her approach and they were unable to make an effective counterattack. Laurence remained submerged until 14:30, when he surfaced to an empty sea. The two damaged dreadnoughts were able to return to base, but both remained in dock under repair for several months. The other forces were able to return without incident. U-30 was also able to return to base, but U-20 as unrecoverable, and was scuttled to avoid capture.Kemp p21 Laurence was awarded a Bar to his Distinguished Service Order for this action. Aftermath Following this action, Scheer came under criticism from Pless, the Naval chief of staff, and the Kaiser himself, who felt that risking so many capital ships of the High Seas Fleet, and having two dreadnoughts put out of action, for the sake of two U-boats, was inappropriate. However, Scheer defended himself robustly, stating that it was imperative to give the men of the U-boat arm the fullest possible support. He also stated that Germany's naval strategy should be to concentrate all her efforts on the U-boat offensive, and that henceforth the principal role of the German surface fleet should be to ensure the U-boat force was able to get to sea safely, and to return safely home. It was a striking demonstration of the shift in German naval policy from the pursuit of naval supremacy through her surface fleet, to the war on commerce by her U-boat arm.Halpern p334 Notes References * Halpern, Paul: A Naval History of World War I (1995) * Kemp, Paul: U-Boats Destroyed ( 1997) * J1 at RAN history page Naval battles of World War I involving Germany North Sea operations of World War I Naval battles of World War I involving the United Kingdom Conflicts in 1916 November 1916 events ","title":"Action of 5 November 1916"},{"id":"30081192","text":"The Passion of John Ruskin is a Canadian short film released in 1994 based on the love life of writer and critic John Ruskin.

The season saw the breakthrough of youngster Kevin Keegan, the attacking midfielder playing an integral part in the team, assisting several goals and scored nine himself, having been moved to a striking position. It gave them hope that their trophyless run, now in its sixth season, may soon end.

It is thought that relational aggression (psychological aspects of bullying such as gossipping and intimidation) are relevant. Relational aggression has been studied amongst girls but not so much amongst adult women.Richards A, Edwards SL A Nurse's Survival Guide to the Ward (2008) According to a finding, 74% of the nurses, 100% of the anesthetists, and 80% of surgical technologists have experienced or witnessed uncivil behaviors like bullying by nursing faculty. Various bullying permutations are possible, such as: * doctor or management bullying a nurse * nurse bullying another nurse * nurse bullying a patient * patient bullying a nurse * nurse bullying other healthcare providers Bullying acts Lewis identifies the following bullying acts in UK nursing: Such acts are frequently insidious, continuing over periods of time that may be years. Bullies are often serial bullies. The bullies are invariably aware of the damage they are doing. They undertake such actions basically to gain control and power. Incivility Laschinger, Leiter, Day, and Gilin found that among 612 staff nurses, 67.5% had experienced incivility from their supervisors and 77.6% had experienced incivility from their coworkers. Rude remarks from a patient or family member can distract healthcare professionals and cause them to make mistakes and to provide suboptimal healthcare. Bullying of nurses by managers In 2003 the Community Practitioners' and Health Visitors' Association in the UK carried out a survey showing that half of the health visitors, school nurses and community nurses working in the National Health Service (NHS) have been bullied by their managers. One in three of the 563 people questioned said the bullying was so bad they had to take time off work. Constant criticism and humiliation were the most common complaints. Others said they were shouted at or marginalised.NHS nurses 'bullied by managers' BBC News 11 October 2003  Consequences  Not only does incivility in nursing has a negative influence in the well-being of staff, the delivery of quality care, and the culture of safety, but also contributes to the nursing faculty shortage. There is an increase in nurses' dissatisfaction in their jobs, which is contributing to the ongoing struggle with nurses leaving faculty positions and taking early retirement. Therefore, it is necessary for all healthcare faculty members to have a clear understanding of the cause and effect of incivility and possible strategies to reduce incivility rate. Nurse bullying inventory In order to further investigate and understand the impact of workplace bullying on the nursing work environment, an inventory was developed to address specific workplace bullying constructs within the nursing context. Associated terms Horizontal violence is often the same term used when referring to bullying in nursing. This term describes the appalling behavior shown by colleagues in the nursing field. Such demeaning behavior makes the work place stressful and unpleasant. Another term associated with bullying in nursing is lateral violence. This term is used to describe the effect that bullying takes on someone lower down on the ladder of workforce, making it hard to climb that ladder. Remedial action Some health organizations are seeking to educate staff and health care team members on how to improve social interactions, proper business etiquette, and foster positive people skills in the work environment. Nurses are entitled to monetary compensation for bullying.Nurse Work Injury Compensation Eoin Campbell Injury Compensation Zone In addition, communication and collaboration are first and foremost steps to improve nursing faculty member's ability to initiate professional relationships with both colleagues and patients. Workshops, open forums, counseling, and mentoring are also possible options to manage bullying in nursing.
