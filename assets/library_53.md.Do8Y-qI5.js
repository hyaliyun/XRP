Retrieved January 29, 2018. Bill \\"Bojangles\\" Robinson stars in his first leading role on screen, along with Putney Dandridge, John Mason, and some of the top entertainers of the period from Harlem's famous Cotton Club, including James Baskett, Anise Boyer, Henri Wessell, and Alma Smith. Eubie Blake and his orchestra perform most of the background music and instrumentals during the film's onstage song and dance numbers. \\"The Tree of Hope\\" Preceding the opening scene of Harlem Is Heaven is a contemporary montage of residents walking and parading on the streets of Harlem, moving images that are accompanied on the screen by a scrolling prologue. Part of that introductory text provides the viewer with a brief history of a special tree in Harlem, an elm that in 1932 still grew next to one of the neighborhood's busy sidewalks: Plot One evening on a sidewalk in Harlem, Jean Stratton (Anise Boyer)‚Äîa young unemployed actress and dancer from West Virginia‚Äîstands next to \\"The Tree of Hope\\", openly praying and imploring the legendary tree to help find her work. When she stops one passing men to ask how long she needs to stand under the tree to get a job, a nearby police officer thinks she is a soliciting prostitute, so he arrests her. A group of spectators gather around the officer and Jean, including \\"Money\\" Johnson (James Baskett), who gets the officer to release her. Money is a local theater owner widely known in Harlem. He is also a rackateer who specializes in \\"policy games\\" or gambling, as well as circulating phony investment schemes around New York, Philadelphia, and in other cities. After the officer and others leave, Money offers Jean a job at his Acme Theatre, gives her some cash as an advance on her salary, and tells her to report to his office the following day.Anise Boyer as Jean Stratton, the film's leading female character After meeting with Jean at his theater the next day, Money introduces her to Bill (Bill Robinson), Acme's star performer and director of its dance and other stage productions. At rehearsal Jean also meets another performer, a handsome young actor and dancer named \\"Chummy\\" Walker (Henri Wessell). Both Chummy and Bill are immediately smitten with Jean even though she initially refers to them as her protective \\"big brothers\\". Money, however, has his own plans to seduce her. Following another rehearsal, Money warns Chummy that \\"Miss Stratton\\" is more than his prot√©g√©e, declaring \\"she's my personal and private property\\". He then orders Chummy to invite Jean to a party in his office after that evening's show. The party will actually be an intimate dinner with just Money. Chummy warns Jean of Money's intentions, but she ignores him and goes to the office, where the theater boss forces himself on her. As she struggles to leave, Bill enters the office, a fight ensues, and Bill knocks out Money. The next day Bill and Jean learn they have been fired. Bill quickly gets a new job performing at a nearby nightclub owned by Knobs Moran (Bob Sawyer), Money's bitter rival in both entertainment and crime. Money now seeks revenge, especially against Chummy for divulging his wanton plan to take advantage of Jean. Money therefore hatches another plan, one to get Chummy imprisoned. He enlists him as the front man in marketing a bogus new hair-straightening product. Money arranges the scam so he is not openly involved, while assuring Chummy that the new product is genuine and will earn huge profits for everyone. Initially successful selling the product, Chummy is soon arrested and jailed for fraud after all the investors lose their money, including Bill's close friend John \\"Spider\\" Mason, who had committed most of his life savings to the enterprise. Variety in 1932 described James Baskett's portrayal of \\"Money\\" Johnson as \\"very impressive\\". While visiting the police station to see Chummy, Jean learns of Money's role in devising the fraud, so she visits Greta (Alma Smith), one of Money's girlfriends who knows details about the scheme. After a brutal fight with Greta, Jean forces her to provide the district attorney with information proving Money's guilt, which results in Chummy's release from jail. Spider then learns from newspaper reports that it was Money, not Chummy, who had concocted the phony investment. Now seeking his own revenge for the loss of his money, Spider confronts Money in his office. After Money tries to shoot him, Spider uses a razor to kill the crime boss as he pleads for mercy. The story then ends in Bill's apartment, where Bill, his mother visiting from Richmond, Jean, and Chummy have gathered. Earlier, Bill had realized that Jean and Chummy had fallen in love, so he urges them to get married before he cheerfully leaves the apartment to see another friend.

That financial success led to its run being extended there. Variety in its June 7 edition also provides a lengthy assessment of the production. In its review the paper recommends the film's presentation to both white and black audiences, recognizes the drawing power of Bill Robinson at the box office, and finds Robinson and Baskett's performances to be the strongest elements of the quickly made, low-budget production: In a more recent assessment of the film, in 2011, The World Cinema Review pans its storyline and acting but extols the dance and musical performances, especially those by Robinson: References and notesExternal links  * ","title":"Harlem Is Heaven"},{"id":"56516334","text":"Celastrina humulus, the hops azure, is a species of blue in the family Lycaenidae.

Her dissertation, Some problems in the iteration of meromorphic functions, was supervised by Irvine Noel Baker. She has spoken about the difficulty of finding postdoctoral research positions at a time when there were few such positions in England and the ties of her husband's job prevented her from moving abroad; she maintained her mathematical career at this stage by taking a temporary lectureship teaching engineering students at the University of Southampton. When she became a professor of mathematics at the Open University, she became the first woman to be a professor in the department. Activism and recognition Stallard won the Whitehead Prize in 2000, and describes this point as the moment when she became confident in her mathematical research abilities. Stallard was the chair of the Women in Mathematics Committee of the London Mathematical Society from 2006 to 2015, and in 2015 she was named an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for her work in support of women in mathematics.

History Norcross was born in Liverpool in 1688 and eventually served in the Royal Navy. As a Jacobite, he supported the deposed James II of England and his erstwhile successor James III (James Stuart), and was present at the Battle of Preston in 1715 when Jacobite forces were crushed. He fled England and was taken in by Swedish pirate lords Lars and Ingela Gathenhielm. They sent him to France in 1716 where he met fellow Jacobite exiles. Norcross captained his own 4-gun privateer vessel for the Swedish, in which he captured the English trading vessel Alexander in October 1717. Before sailing back to Gothenburg he put into port in France where he was captured. His crew attempted to sail away without him but were overcome by their prisoners who escaped in the Alexander. The French sent Norcross back to England to stand trial but he was released (or escaped) with the intervention of the Abb√© du Bois. General Dillon wrote of Norcross to the Duke of Mar in 1718: > ‚ÄúI am pretty well acquainted with Mr. Norcross. He has been here about 6 > weeks ago, after making his escape from Dunkirk, where he was seized by > orders. He appears to be an unsettled, scatter-brained fellow, and in my > opinion, there can be no great reliance on proposals that come from him. He > seems, however, very zealous for the King's service. When you have occasion > for a pirate, he may be of use, excelling in that noble calling, and, I am > told, being a good seaman.‚Äù A priest wrote to the Duke of Mar at the same time describing him as \\"a mad fellow such as Northcross.\\" Norcross himself wrote to the exiled ‚ÄúOld Pretender‚Äù James Stuart expressing his desire to serve the would-be King. Sweden‚Äôs King Charles XII died that December, and Norcross was arrested when it came to light that he had been seizing vessels outside the bounds of his privateering commission. He was sentenced to death in 1719 but fled; captured in Paris, he was released and pardoned by Sweden‚Äôs King Frederick I. Norcross served Sweden for a time, acting as an agent in their attempts to establish a trading post on Madagascar by pardoning the pirates present at Ile Ste.-Marie. He obtained a pardon for the pirates from Peter the Great of Russia, though the agreement fell apart before Sweden or Russia could take advantage of the opportunity. Norcross continued to advise the Swedish for several years. In 1727 he was captured and tried by Danish authorities. Convicted of a number of crimes, he was sentenced to life in prison. He was released from solitary confinement in 1745 but was confined to castle grounds, where he died in 1758.

A British Special Air Service unit commanded by Major David Stirling attacked a German-held airfield in Egypt during the Western Desert Campaign of Second World War. Several aircraft used to ferry supplies to the Axis forces were destroyed or damaged with machine-gun fire and explosives. Axis front line units were diverted to reinforce the garrisons in the rear vulnerable to attack. Background=Axis supply= In November 1941, 70 per cent of supplies being sent to Axis forces in North Africa were lost to Allied air and naval attacks. By 1942, German and Italian forces in North Africa faced a serious supply shortage with Allied forces sinking merchant ships in the Mediterranean Sea. Axis supplies were being transported down the Italian Peninsula, mainly by rail, to southern ports for shipment to North Africa. The Royal Navy was deploying growing numbers of ships and submarines to the area to intercept Axis supply convoys forcing the to carry some of the burden of supplying the and Italian troops by air. The terrain in North Africa often made land transport impractical, forcing aircraft to fly between remote desert airstrips to deliver supplies, parts, troops and food. =Special Air Service= In July 1941, Major David Stirling formed the Special Air Service for bold operations behind Axis lines. Initially dubbed 'L' Detachment, Special Air Service Brigade, the unit consisted of men drawn from conventional British units and given ad hoc parachute training. The unit was based in Jalo Oasis and gained a reputation for daring raids on German bases, infiltrating them and destroying parked aircraft with explosives. Stirling became known among the Germans as the \\"Phantom Major\\". Prelude Stirling had been concocting a plan for some time to strike at the Sidi Haneish Airfield, an airfield complex located west of Cairo, which the Germans called . The raid would involve using an unfamiliar tactic to the SAS; storming the base in vehicles, rather than discreetly penetrating. Stirling briefed his men on the raid and enlisted the Long Range Desert Group to provide vehicles and transport. He thought that the firepower and speed of the jeeps would be enough to overcome the German defences. The raiders would drive through the desert from a hideout in to the airfield and then overrun it in eighteen jeeps in two columns, with Stirling at the lead. Each jeep had four Vickers K machine guns, a rapid-firing weapon, originally designed for Royal Air Force (RAF) aircraft. On the night of 25/26 July, the men held a dress rehearsal. Raid The raid commenced on the night of 26/27 July, with the eighteen jeeps, each carrying 3 or 4 British or French commandos, navigating the desert without headlights and trying to keep formation. The weather was ideal with a full moon and no clouds. As the raiders approached the airfield, the lights lining the runway switched on, causing a degree of panic among the commandos who feared they had been detected but the lights had been turned on for a bomber to land. Stirling fired a green flare and ordered the jeeps forward onto the airfield in 'V' formation. The SAS stormed the airfield, using their K guns, loaded with tracer ammunition, to fire on the parked German aircraft which included Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers, Ju 52 cargo aircraft and Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters. German troops replied with machine-guns and anti-aircraft weapons, disabling one jeep. Lance Bombardier John Robson, a 21-year-old SAS soldier, was manning a machine-gun when he was shot and killed, making him the only Allied casualty of the assault. The raiders used most of their ammunition and manoeuvred to escape after a last sweep for undamaged aircraft. Paddy Mayne leapt from a jeep to place a bomb in the engine of a parked bomber before withdrawing. The raiders had destroyed or damaged around forty aircraft, though the SAS claimed twenty-five as it was customary to under-report Axis losses. =Escape= The raiders escaped into the desert, less one jeep and one man killed and split into groups of 3‚Äì5 jeeps, seeking to evade detection by German aircraft since only two and a half hours of darkness remained; in daylight, they would become vulnerable to air attack. The SAS hid during the day, camouflaging their vehicles and all but one group reached . The group of jeeps operated by the French SAS were slowed by punctures and breakdowns, exposing them in the desert. They were spotted by four dive-bombers which made nine attacks, fatally wounding paratrooper Andr√© Zirnheld. After the ran out of ammunition, the commandos boarded the last operational jeep and reached safety. Aftermath The raid was a great success, several of the destroyed German aircraft being Junkers 52 transport aircraft, which exacerbated Axis supply difficulties. Stirling was captured by the Germans in January 1943 and spent the rest of the war in and out of Axis prisoner of war camps; Stirling was replaced by Mayne as commander of the SAS.

There were new and radical developments in the physical, life and human sciences, building on the progress made in the 19th century. The development of post-Newtonian theories in physics, such as special relativity, general relativity, and quantum mechanics led to the development of nuclear weapons. New models of the structure of the atom led to developments in theories of chemistry and the development of new materials such as nylon and plastics. Advances in biology led to large increases in food production, as well as the elimination of diseases such as polio. A massive amount of new technologies were developed in the 20th century. Technologies such as electricity, the incandescent light bulb, the automobile and the phonograph, first developed at the end of the 19th century, were perfected and universally deployed. The first airplane flight occurred in 1903, and by the end of the century large airplanes such as the Boeing 777 and Airbus A330 flew thousands of miles in a matter of hours. The development of the television and computers caused massive changes in the dissemination of information.  Astronomy and space exploration  American Buzz Aldrin during the first moonwalk in 1969. The relatively young aerospace engineering industries rapidly grew in the 66 years after the Wright brothers first flight. * A much better understanding of the evolution of the universe was achieved, its age (about 13.8 billion years) was determined, and the Big Bang theory on its origin was proposed and generally accepted. * The age of the solar system, including Earth, was determined, and it turned out to be much older than believed earlier: more than 4 billion years, rather than the 20 million years suggested by Lord Kelvin in 1862. * The planets of the solar system and their moons were closely observed via numerous space probes. Pluto was discovered in 1930 on the edge of the solar system, although in the early 21st century, it was reclassified as a plutoid instead of a planet proper, leaving eight planets. * No trace of life was discovered on any of the other planets in our solar system (or elsewhere in the universe), although it remained undetermined whether some forms of primitive life might exist, or might have existed, somewhere. Extrasolar planets were observed for the first time. * In 1969, Apollo 11 was launched towards the Moon and Neil Armstrong became the first person from Earth to walk on another celestial body. * That same year, Soviet astronomer Victor Safronov published his book Evolution of the protoplanetary cloud and formation of the Earth and the planets. In this book, almost all major problems of the planetary formation process were formulated and some of them solved. Safronov's ideas were further developed in the works of George Wetherill, who discovered runaway accretion. * The Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union gave a peaceful outlet to the political and military tensions of the Cold War, leading to the first human spaceflight with the Soviet Union's Vostok 1 mission in 1961, and man's first landing on another world--the Moon--with America's Apollo 11 mission in 1969. Later, the first space station was launched by the Soviet space program. The United States developed the first (and to date only) reusable spacecraft system with the Space Shuttle program, first launched in 1981. As the century ended, a permanent manned presence in space was being founded with the ongoing construction of the International Space Station. * In addition to human spaceflight, unmanned space probes became a practical and relatively inexpensive form of exploration. The first orbiting space probe, Sputnik 1, was launched by the Soviet Union in 1957. Over time, a massive system of artificial satellites was placed into orbit around Earth. These satellites greatly advanced navigation, communications, military intelligence, geology, climate, and numerous other fields. Also, by the end of the 20th century, unmanned probes had visited the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and various asteroids and comets. The Hubble Space Telescope, launched in 1990, greatly expanded our understanding of the Universe and brought brilliant images to TV and computer screens around the world.  Biology and medicine  A stamp commemorating Alexander Fleming. His discovery of penicillin had changed the world of modern medicine by introducing the age of antibiotics. * Genetics was unanimously accepted and significantly developed. The structure of DNA was determined in 1953 by James Watson, Francis Crick, Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins, following by developing techniques which allow to read DNA sequences and culminating in starting the Human Genome Project (not finished in the 20th century) and cloning the first mammal in 1996. * The role of sexual reproduction in evolution was understood, and bacterial conjugation was discovered. * The convergence of various sciences for the formulation of the modern evolutionary synthesis (produced between 1936 and 1947), providing a widely accepted account of evolution. * Placebo-controlled, randomized, blinded clinical trials became a powerful tool for testing new medicines. * Antibiotics drastically reduced mortality from bacterial diseases and their prevalence. * A vaccine was developed for polio, ending a worldwide epidemic. Effective vaccines were also developed for a number of other serious infectious diseases, including influenza, diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), tetanus, measles, mumps, rubella (German measles), chickenpox, hepatitis A, and hepatitis B. * Epidemiology and vaccination led to the eradication of the smallpox virus in humans. * X-rays became powerful diagnostic tool for wide spectrum of diseases, from bone fractures to cancer. In the 1960s, computerized tomography was invented. Other important diagnostic tools developed were sonography and magnetic resonance imaging. * Development of vitamins virtually eliminated scurvy and other vitamin-deficiency diseases from industrialized societies. * New psychiatric drugs were developed. These include antipsychotics for treating hallucinations and delusions, and antidepressants for treating depression. * The role of tobacco smoking in the causation of cancer and other diseases was proven during the 1950s (see British Doctors Study). * New methods for cancer treatment, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy, were developed. As a result, cancer could often be cured or placed in remission. * The development of blood typing and blood banking made blood transfusion safe and widely available. * The invention and development of immunosuppressive drugs and tissue typing made organ and tissue transplantation a clinical reality. * New methods for heart surgery were developed, including pacemakers and artificial hearts. * Cocaine/crack and heroin were found to be dangerous addictive drugs, and their wide usage had been outlawed; mind-altering drugs such as LSD and MDMA were discovered and later outlawed. In many countries, a war on drugs caused prices to soar 10‚Äì20 times higher, leading to profitable black market drugdealing, and in some countries (e.g. the United States) to prison inmate sentences being 80% related to drug use by the 1990s. * Contraceptive drugs were developed, which reduced population growth rates in industrialized countries, as well as decreased the taboo of premarital sex throughout many western countries. * The development of medical insulin during the 1920s helped raise the life expectancy of diabetics to three times of what it had been earlier. * Vaccines, hygiene and clean water improved health and decreased mortality rates, especially among infants and the young. = Notable diseases = * An influenza pandemic, Spanish Flu, killed anywhere from 20 to 100 million people between 1918 and 1919. * A new viral disease, called the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, or HIV, arose in Africa and subsequently killed millions of people throughout the world. HIV leads to a syndrome called Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, or AIDS. Treatments for HIV remained inaccessible to many people living with AIDS and HIV in developing countries, and a cure has yet to be discovered. * Because of increased life spans, the prevalence of cancer, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and other diseases of old age increased slightly. * Sedentary lifestyles, due to labor- saving devices and technology, along with the increase in home entertainment and technology such as television, video games, and the internet contributed to an \\"epidemic\\" of obesity, at first in the rich countries, but by the end of the 20th century spreading to the developing world.  Chemistry  The first Solvay Conference was held in Brussels in 1911 and was considered a turning point in the world of physics and chemistry. In 1903, Mikhail Tsvet invented chromatography, an important analytic technique. In 1904, Hantaro Nagaoka proposed an early nuclear model of the atom, where electrons orbit a dense massive nucleus. In 1905, Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch developed the Haber process for making ammonia, a milestone in industrial chemistry with deep consequences in agriculture. The Haber process, or Haber-Bosch process, combined nitrogen and hydrogen to form ammonia in industrial quantities for production of fertilizer and munitions. The food production for half the world's current population depends on this method for producing fertilizer. Haber, along with Max Born, proposed the Born‚ÄìHaber cycle as a method for evaluating the lattice energy of an ionic solid. Haber has also been described as the \\"father of chemical warfare\\" for his work developing and deploying chlorine and other poisonous gases during World War I. Robert A. Millikan, who is best known for measuring the charge on the electron, won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1923. In 1905, Albert Einstein explained Brownian motion in a way that definitively proved atomic theory. Leo Baekeland invented bakelite, one of the first commercially successful plastics. In 1909, American physicist Robert Andrews Millikan - who had studied in Europe under Walther Nernst and Max Planck - measured the charge of individual electrons with unprecedented accuracy through the oil drop experiment, in which he measured the electric charges on tiny falling water (and later oil) droplets. His study established that any particular droplet's electrical charge is a multiple of a definite, fundamental value ‚Äî the electron's charge ‚Äî and thus a confirmation that all electrons have the same charge and mass. Beginning in 1912, he spent several years investigating and finally proving Albert Einstein's proposed linear relationship between energy and frequency, and providing the first direct photoelectric support for Planck's constant. In 1923 Millikan was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics. In 1909, S. P. L. S√∏rensen invented the pH concept and develops methods for measuring acidity. In 1911, Antonius Van den Broek proposed the idea that the elements on the periodic table are more properly organized by positive nuclear charge rather than atomic weight. In 1911, the first Solvay Conference was held in Brussels, bringing together most of the most prominent scientists of the day. In 1912, William Henry Bragg and William Lawrence Bragg proposed Bragg's law and established the field of X-ray crystallography, an important tool for elucidating the crystal structure of substances. In 1912, Peter Debye develops the concept of molecular dipole to describe asymmetric charge distribution in some molecules. In 1913, Niels Bohr, a Danish physicist, introduced the concepts of quantum mechanics to atomic structure by proposing what is now known as the Bohr model of the atom, where electrons exist only in strictly defined circular orbits around the nucleus similar to rungs on a ladder. The Bohr Model is a planetary model in which the negatively charged electrons orbit a small, positively charged nucleus similar to the planets orbiting the Sun (except that the orbits are not planar) - the gravitational force of the solar system is mathematically akin to the attractive Coulomb (electrical) force between the positively charged nucleus and the negatively charged electrons. In 1913, Henry Moseley, working from Van den Broek's earlier idea, introduces concept of atomic number to fix inadequacies of Mendeleev's periodic table, which had been based on atomic weight. The peak of Frederick Soddy's career in radiochemistry was in 1913 with his formulation of the concept of isotopes, which stated that certain elements exist in two or more forms which have different atomic weights but which are indistinguishable chemically. He is remembered for proving the existence of isotopes of certain radioactive elements, and is also credited, along with others, with the discovery of the element protactinium in 1917. In 1913, J. J. Thomson expanded on the work of Wien by showing that charged subatomic particles can be separated by their mass-to-charge ratio, a technique known as mass spectrometry. In 1916, Gilbert N. Lewis published his seminal article \\"The Atom of the Molecule\\", which suggested that a chemical bond is a pair of electrons shared by two atoms. Lewis's model equated the classical chemical bond with the sharing of a pair of electrons between the two bonded atoms. Lewis introduced the \\"electron dot diagrams\\" in this paper to symbolize the electronic structures of atoms and molecules. Now known as Lewis structures, they are discussed in virtually every introductory chemistry book. Lewis in 1923 developed the electron pair theory of acids and base: Lewis redefined an acid as any atom or molecule with an incomplete octet that was thus capable of accepting electrons from another atom; bases were, of course, electron donors. His theory is known as the concept of Lewis acids and bases. In 1923, G. N. Lewis and Merle Randall published Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Substances, first modern treatise on chemical thermodynamics. The 1920s saw a rapid adoption and application of Lewis's model of the electron-pair bond in the fields of organic and coordination chemistry. In organic chemistry, this was primarily due to the efforts of the British chemists Arthur Lapworth, Robert Robinson, Thomas Lowry, and Christopher Ingold; while in coordination chemistry, Lewis's bonding model was promoted through the efforts of the American chemist Maurice Huggins and the British chemist Nevil Sidgwick. =Quantum chemistry= Some view the birth of quantum chemistry in the discovery of the Schr√∂dinger equation and its application to the hydrogen atom in 1926. However, the 1927 article of Walter Heitler and Fritz LondonW. Heitler and F. London, Wechselwirkung neutraler Atome und Hom√∂opolare Bindung nach der Quantenmechanik, Z. Physik, 44, 455 (1927). is often recognised as the first milestone in the history of quantum chemistry. This is the first application of quantum mechanics to the diatomic hydrogen molecule, and thus to the phenomenon of the chemical bond. In the following years much progress was accomplished by Edward Teller, Robert S. Mulliken, Max Born, J. Robert Oppenheimer, Linus Pauling, Erich H√ºckel, Douglas Hartree, Vladimir Aleksandrovich Fock, to cite a few. Still, skepticism remained as to the general power of quantum mechanics applied to complex chemical systems. The situation around 1930 is described by Paul Dirac:P.A.M. Dirac, Quantum Mechanics of Many-Electron Systems, Proc. R. Soc. London, A 123, 714 (1929). Hence the quantum mechanical methods developed in the 1930s and 1940s are often referred to as theoretical molecular or atomic physics to underline the fact that they were more the application of quantum mechanics to chemistry and spectroscopy than answers to chemically relevant questions. In 1951, a milestone article in quantum chemistry is the seminal paper of Clemens C. J. Roothaan on Roothaan equations.C.C.J. Roothaan, A Study of Two-Center Integrals Useful in Calculations on Molecular Structure, J. Chem. Phys., 19, 1445 (1951). It opened the avenue to the solution of the self-consistent field equations for small molecules like hydrogen or nitrogen. Those computations were performed with the help of tables of integrals which were computed on the most advanced computers of the time. In the 1940s many physicists turned from molecular or atomic physics to nuclear physics (like J. Robert Oppenheimer or Edward Teller). Glenn T. Seaborg was an American nuclear chemist best known for his work on isolating and identifying transuranium elements (those heavier than uranium). He shared the 1951 Nobel Prize for Chemistry with Edwin Mattison McMillan for their independent discoveries of transuranium elements. Seaborgium was named in his honour, making him the only person, along Albert Einstein and Yuri Oganessian, for whom a chemical element was named during his lifetime. =Molecular biology and biochemistry= By the mid 20th century, in principle, the integration of physics and chemistry was extensive, with chemical properties explained as the result of the electronic structure of the atom; Linus Pauling's book on The Nature of the Chemical Bond used the principles of quantum mechanics to deduce bond angles in ever-more complicated molecules. However, though some principles deduced from quantum mechanics were able to predict qualitatively some chemical features for biologically relevant molecules, they were, till the end of the 20th century, more a collection of rules, observations, and recipes than rigorous ab initio quantitative methods. Diagrammatic representation of some key structural features of DNA This heuristic approach triumphed in 1953 when James Watson and Francis Crick deduced the double helical structure of DNA by constructing models constrained by and informed by the knowledge of the chemistry of the constituent parts and the X-ray diffraction patterns obtained by Rosalind Franklin.Watson, J. and Crick, F., \\"Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids\\" Nature, April 25, 1953, p 737‚Äì8 This discovery lead to an explosion of research into the biochemistry of life. In the same year, the Miller‚ÄìUrey experiment, conducted by Stanley Miller and Harold Urey demonstrated that basic constituents of protein, simple amino acids, could themselves be built up from simpler molecules in a simulation of primordial processes on Earth. Though many questions remain about the true nature of the origin of life, this was the first attempt by chemists to study hypothetical processes in the laboratory under controlled conditions.https://www.windows2universe.org/earth/Life/miller_urey.html#:~:text=In%20the%201950's%2C%20biochemists%20Stanley,conditions%20of%20Earth's%20early%20atmosphere. In 1983 Kary Mullis devised a method for the in-vitro amplification of DNA, known as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which revolutionized the chemical processes used in the laboratory to manipulate it. PCR could be used to synthesize specific pieces of DNA and made possible the sequencing of DNA of organisms, which culminated in the huge human genome project. An important piece in the double helix puzzle was solved by one of Pauling's students Matthew Meselson and Frank Stahl, the result of their collaboration (Meselson‚ÄìStahl experiment) has been called as \\"the most beautiful experiment in biology\\". They used a centrifugation technique that sorted molecules according to differences in weight. Because nitrogen atoms are a component of DNA, they were labelled and therefore tracked in replication in bacteria. =Late 20th century= Buckminsterfullerene, C60 In 1970, John Pople developed the Gaussian program greatly easing computational chemistry calculations.W.

Buckminster Fuller. In 1991, Sumio Iijima used electron microscopy to discover a type of cylindrical fullerene known as a carbon nanotube, though earlier work had been done in the field as early as 1951.

Abstract In 1995, Eric Cornell and Carl Wieman produced the first Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensate, a substance that displays quantum mechanical properties on the macroscopic scale.  Earth science  In 1912 Alfred Wegener proposed the theory of Continental Drift. This theory suggests that the shapes of continents and matching coastline geology between some continents indicates they were joined together in the past and formed a single landmass known as Pangaea; thereafter they separated and drifted like rafts over the ocean floor, currently reaching their present position. Additionally, the theory of continental drift offered a possible explanation as to the formation of mountains; Plate Tectonics built on the theory of continental drift. Unfortunately, Wegener provided no convincing mechanism for this drift, and his ideas were not generally accepted during his lifetime. Arthur Homes accepted Wegener's theory and provided a mechanism: mantle convection, to cause the continents to move. However, it was not until after the Second World War that new evidence started to accumulate that supported continental drift. There followed a period of 20 extremely exciting years where the Theory of Continental Drift developed from being believed by a few to being the cornerstone of modern Geology. Beginning in 1947 research found new evidence about the ocean floor, and in 1960 Bruce C. Heezen published the concept of mid-ocean ridges.Soon after this, Robert S. Dietz and Harry H. Hess proposed that the oceanic crust forms as the seafloor spreads apart along mid-ocean ridges in seafloor spreading. This was seen as confirmation of mantle convection and so the major stumbling block to the theory was removed. Geophysical evidence suggested lateral motion of continents and that oceanic crust is younger than continental crust. This geophysical evidence also spurred the hypothesis of paleomagnetism, the record of the orientation of the Earth's magnetic field recorded in magnetic minerals. British geophysicist S. K. Runcorn suggested the concept of paleomagnetism from his finding that the continents had moved relative to the Earth's magnetic poles. Tuzo Wilson, who was a promoter of the sea floor spreading hypothesis and continental drift from the very beginning, added the concept of transform faults to the model, completing the classes of fault types necessary to make the mobility of the plates on the globe function. A symposium on continental drift was held at the Royal Society of London in 1965 must be regarded as the official start of the acceptance of plate tectonics by the scientific community.The abstracts from the symposium are issued as Blacket, Bullard, Runcorn;1965.In this symposium, Edward Bullard and co-workers showed with a computer calculation how the continents along both sides of the Atlantic would best fit to close the ocean, which became known as the famous \\"Bullard's Fit\\". By the late 1960s the weight of the evidence available saw Continental Drift as the generally accepted theory. Other theories of the causes of climate change fared no better. The principal advances were in observational paleoclimatology, as scientists in various fields of geology worked out methods to reveal ancient climates. Wilmot H. Bradley found that annual varves of clay laid down in lake beds showed climate cycles. Andrew Ellicott Douglass saw strong indications of climate change in tree rings. Noting that the rings were thinner in dry years, he reported climate effects from solar variations, particularly in connection with the 17th-century dearth of sunspots (the Maunder Minimum) noticed previously by William Herschel and others. Other scientists, however, found good reason to doubt that tree rings could reveal anything beyond random regional variations. The value of tree rings for climate study was not solidly established until the 1960s. Through the 1930s the most persistent advocate of a solar-climate connection was astrophysicist Charles Greeley Abbot. By the early 1920s, he had concluded that the solar \\"constant\\" was misnamed: his observations showed large variations, which he connected with sunspots passing across the face of the Sun. He and a few others pursued the topic into the 1960s, convinced that sunspot variations were a main cause of climate change. Other scientists were skeptical. Nevertheless, attempts to connect the solar cycle with climate cycles were popular in the 1920s and 1930s. Respected scientists announced correlations that they insisted were reliable enough to make predictions. Sooner or later, every prediction failed, and the subject fell into disrepute. Meanwhile Milutin Milankovitch, building on James Croll's theory, improved the tedious calculations of the varying distances and angles of the Sun's radiation as the Sun and Moon gradually perturbed the Earth's orbit. Some observations of varves (layers seen in the mud covering the bottom of lakes) matched the prediction of a Milankovitch cycle lasting about 21,000 years. However, most geologists dismissed the astronomical theory. For they could not fit Milankovitch's timing to the accepted sequence, which had only four ice ages, all of them much longer than 21,000 years. In 1938 Guy Stewart Callendar attempted to revive Arrhenius's greenhouse-effect theory. Callendar presented evidence that both temperature and the level in the atmosphere had been rising over the past half-century, and he argued that newer spectroscopic measurements showed that the gas was effective in absorbing infrared in the atmosphere. Nevertheless, most scientific opinion continued to dispute or ignore the theory. Charles Keeling, receiving the National Medal of Science from George W. Bush, in 2001 Another clue to the nature of climate change came in the mid-1960s from analysis of deep-sea cores by Cesare Emiliani and analysis of ancient corals by Wallace Broecker and collaborators. Rather than four long ice ages, they found a large number of shorter ones in a regular sequence. It appeared that the timing of ice ages was set by the small orbital shifts of the Milankovitch cycles. While the matter remained controversial, some began to suggest that the climate system is sensitive to small changes and can readily be flipped from a stable state into a different one. Scientists meanwhile began using computers to develop more sophisticated versions of Arrhenius's calculations. In 1967, taking advantage of the ability of digital computers to integrate absorption curves numerically, Syukuro Manabe and Richard Wetherald made the first detailed calculation of the greenhouse effect incorporating convection (the \\"Manabe-Wetherald one- dimensional radiative-convective model\\"). They found that, in the absence of unknown feedbacks such as changes in clouds, a doubling of carbon dioxide from the current level would result in approximately 2 ¬∞C increase in global temperature. By the 1960s, aerosol pollution (\\"smog\\") had become a serious local problem in many cities, and some scientists began to consider whether the cooling effect of particulate pollution could affect global temperatures. Scientists were unsure whether the cooling effect of particulate pollution or warming effect of greenhouse gas emissions would predominate, but regardless, began to suspect that human emissions could be disruptive to climate in the 21st century if not sooner. In his 1968 book The Population Bomb, Paul R. Ehrlich wrote, \\"the greenhouse effect is being enhanced now by the greatly increased level of carbon dioxide... [this] is being countered by low-level clouds generated by contrails, dust, and other contaminants... At the moment we cannot predict what the overall climatic results will be of our using the atmosphere as a garbage dump.\\" A 1968 study by the Stanford Research Institute for the American Petroleum Institute noted: In 1969, NATO was the first candidate to deal with climate change on an international level. It was planned then to establish a hub of research and initiatives of the organization in the civil area, dealing with environmental topics as acid rain and the greenhouse effect. The suggestion of US President Richard Nixon was not very successful with the administration of German Chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesinger. But the topics and the preparation work done on the NATO proposal by the German authorities gained international momentum, (see e.g. the Stockholm United Nations Conference on the Human Environment 1970) as the government of Willy Brandt started to apply them on the civil sphere instead.Die Fr√ºhgeschichte der globalen Umweltkrise und die Formierung der deutschen Umweltpolitik(1950‚Äì1973) (Early history of the environmental crisis and the setup of German environmental policy 1950‚Äì1973), Kai F. H√ºnem√∂rder, Franz Steiner Verlag, 2004 Also in 1969, Mikhail Budyko published a theory on the ice-albedo feedback, a foundational element of what is today known as Arctic amplification. The same year a similar model was published by William D. Sellers. Both studies attracted significant attention, since they hinted at the possibility for a runaway positive feedback within the global climate system. In the early 1970s, evidence that aerosols were increasing worldwide encouraged Reid Bryson and some others to warn of the possibility of severe cooling. Meanwhile, the new evidence that the timing of ice ages was set by predictable orbital cycles suggested that the climate would gradually cool, over thousands of years. For the century ahead, however, a survey of the scientific literature from 1965 to 1979 found 7 articles predicting cooling and 44 predicting warming (many other articles on climate made no prediction); the warming articles were cited much more often in subsequent scientific literature. Several scientific panels from this time period concluded that more research was needed to determine whether warming or cooling was likely, indicating that the trend in the scientific literature had not yet become a consensus.Reid A. Bryson:A Reconciliation of several Theories of Climate Change, in: John P. Holdren (Ed.): Global Ecology. Readings toward a Rational Strategy for Man, New York etc. 1971, S. 78‚Äì84 John Sawyer published the study Man-made Carbon Dioxide and the ‚ÄúGreenhouse‚Äù Effect in 1972. He summarized the knowledge of the science at the time, the anthropogenic attribution of the carbon dioxide greenhouse gas, distribution and exponential rise, findings which still hold today. Additionally he accurately predicted the rate of global warming for the period between 1972 and 2000. The mainstream news media at the time exaggerated the warnings of the minority who expected imminent cooling. For example, in 1975, Newsweek magazine published a story that warned of \\"ominous signs that the Earth's weather patterns have begun to change.\\" The article continued by stating that evidence of global cooling was so strong that meteorologists were having \\"a hard time keeping up with it.\\" On 23 October 2006, Newsweek issued an update stating that it had been \\"spectacularly wrong about the near-term future\\". In the first two \\"Reports for the Club of Rome\\" in 1972Meadows, D., et al., The Limits to Growth. New York 1972. and 1974,Mesarovic, M., Pestel, E., Mankind at the Turning Point. New York 1974. the anthropogenic climate changes by increase as well as by waste heat were mentioned. About the latter John Holdren wrote in a studyJohn P. Holdren: \\"Global Thermal Pollution\\", in: John P. Holdren (Ed.): Global Ecology. Readings toward a Rational Strategy for Man, New York etc. 1971, S. 85‚Äì88.

Evidence for warming accumulated. By 1975, Manabe and Wetherald had developed a three-dimensional Global climate model that gave a roughly accurate representation of the current climate. Doubling in the model's atmosphere gave a roughly 2 ¬∞C rise in global temperature. Several other kinds of computer models gave similar results: it was impossible to make a model that gave something resembling the actual climate and not have the temperature rise when the concentration was increased. The 1979 World Climate Conference (12 to 23 February) of the World Meteorological Organization concluded \\"it appears plausible that an increased amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere can contribute to a gradual warming of the lower atmosphere, especially at higher latitudes....It is possible that some effects on a regional and global scale may be detectable before the end of this century and become significant before the middle of the next century.\\" In July 1979 the United States National Research Council published a report, concluding (in part): James Hansen during his 1988 testimony to Congress, which alerted the public to the dangers of global warming By the early 1980s, the slight cooling trend from 1945‚Äì1975 had stopped. Aerosol pollution had decreased in many areas due to environmental legislation and changes in fuel use, and it became clear that the cooling effect from aerosols was not going to increase substantially while carbon dioxide levels were progressively increasing. Hansen and others published the 1981 study Climate impact of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide, and noted: In 1982, Greenland ice cores drilled by Hans Oeschger, Willi Dansgaard, and collaborators revealed dramatic temperature oscillations in the space of a century in the distant past. The most prominent of the changes in their record corresponded to the violent Younger Dryas climate oscillation seen in shifts in types of pollen in lake beds all over Europe. Evidently drastic climate changes were possible within a human lifetime. In 1985 a joint UNEP/WMO/ICSU Conference on the \\"Assessment of the Role of Carbon Dioxide and Other Greenhouse Gases in Climate Variations and Associated Impacts\\" concluded that greenhouse gases \\"are expected\\" to cause significant warming in the next century and that some warming is inevitable. Meanwhile, ice cores drilled by a Franco-Soviet team at the Vostok Station in Antarctica showed that and temperature had gone up and down together in wide swings through past ice ages. This confirmed the -temperature relationship in a manner entirely independent of computer climate models, strongly reinforcing the emerging scientific consensus. The findings also pointed to powerful biological and geochemical feedbacks. In June 1988, James E. Hansen made one of the first assessments that human-caused warming had already measurably affected global climate. Shortly after, a \\"World Conference on the Changing Atmosphere: Implications for Global Security\\" gathered hundreds of scientists and others in Toronto. They concluded that the changes in the atmosphere due to human pollution \\"represent a major threat to international security and are already having harmful consequences over many parts of the globe,\\" and declared that by 2005 the world would be well-advised to push its emissions some 20% below the 1988 level. The 1980s saw important breakthroughs with regard to global environmental challenges. Ozone depletion was mitigated by the Vienna Convention (1985) and the Montreal Protocol (1987). Acid rain was mainly regulated on national and regional levels. Colors indicate temperature anomalies (NASA/NOAA; 20 January 2016). In 1988 the WMO established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change with the support of the UNEP. The IPCC continues its work through the present day, and issues a series of Assessment Reports and supplemental reports that describe the state of scientific understanding at the time each report is prepared. Scientific developments during this period are summarized about once every five to six years in the IPCC Assessment Reports which were published in 1990 (First Assessment Report), 1995 (Second Assessment Report), 2001 (Third Assessment Report), 2007 (Fourth Assessment Report), and 2013/2014 (Fifth Assessment Report). Since the 1990s, research on climate change has expanded and grown, linking many fields such as atmospheric sciences, numerical modeling, behavioral sciences, geology and economics, or security.  Engineering and technology  First flight of the Wright Flyer I, December 17, 1903, Orville piloting, Wilbur running at wingtip. One of the prominent traits of the 20th century was the dramatic growth of technology. Organized research and practice of science led to advancement in the fields of communication, engineering, travel, medicine, and war. * The number and types of home appliances increased dramatically due to advancements in technology, electricity availability, and increases in wealth and leisure time. Such basic appliances as washing machines, clothes dryers, furnaces, exercise machines, refrigerators, freezers, electric stoves, and vacuum cleaners all became popular from the 1920s through the 1950s. The microwave oven became popular during the 1980s and have become a standard in all homes by the 1990s. Radios were popularized as a form of entertainment during the 1920s, which extended to television during the 1950s. Cable and satellite television spread rapidly during the 1980s and 1990s. Personal computers began to enter the home during the 1970s‚Äì1980s as well. The age of the portable music player grew during the 1960s with the development of the transistor radio, 8-track and cassette tapes, which slowly began to replace record players These were in turn replaced by the CD during the late 1980s and 1990s. The proliferation of the Internet in the mid-to-late 1990s made digital distribution of music (mp3s) possible. VCRs were popularized in the 1970s, but by the end of the 20th century, DVD players were beginning to replace them, making the VHS obsolete by the end of the first decade of the 21st century. * The first airplane was flown in 1903. With the engineering of the faster jet engine in the 1940s, mass air travel became commercially viable. * The assembly line made mass production of the automobile viable. By the end of the 20th century, billions of people had automobiles for personal transportation. The combination of the automobile, motor boats and air travel allowed for unprecedented personal mobility. In western nations, motor vehicle accidents became the greatest cause of death for young people. However, expansion of divided highways reduced the death rate. * The triode tube, transistor and integrated circuit successively revolutionized electronics and computers, leading to the proliferation of the personal computer in the 1980s and cell phones and the public-use Internet in the 1990s. * New materials, most notably stainless steel, Velcro, silicone, teflon, and plastics such as polystyrene, PVC, polyethylene, and nylon came into widespread use for many various applications. These materials typically have tremendous performance gains in strength, temperature, chemical resistance, or mechanical properties over those known prior to the 20th century. *Aluminum became an inexpensive metal and became second only to iron in use. *Semiconductor materials were discovered, and methods of production and purification developed for use in electronic devices. Silicon became one of the purest substances ever produced. * Thousands of chemicals were developed for industrial processing and home use.  Mathematics  The 20th century saw mathematics become a major profession. As in most areas of study, the explosion of knowledge in the scientific age has led to specialization: by the end of the century there were hundreds of specialized areas in mathematics and the Mathematics Subject Classification was dozens of pages long.Mathematics Subject Classification 2000 Every year, thousands of new Ph.D.s in mathematics were awarded, and jobs were available in both teaching and industry. More and more mathematical journals were published and, by the end of the century, the development of the World Wide Web led to online publishing. Mathematical collaborations of unprecedented size and scope took place. An example is the classification of finite simple groups (also called the \\"enormous theorem\\"), whose proof between 1955 and 1983 required 500-odd journal articles by about 100 authors, and filling tens of thousands of pages. In a 1900 speech to the International Congress of Mathematicians, David Hilbert set out a list of 23 unsolved problems in mathematics. These problems, spanning many areas of mathematics, formed a central focus for much of 20th-century mathematics. Today, 10 have been solved, 7 are partially solved, and 2 are still open. The remaining 4 are too loosely formulated to be stated as solved or not. In 1929 and 1930, it was proved the truth or falsity of all statements formulated about the natural numbers plus one of addition and multiplication, was decidable, i.e. could be determined by some algorithm. In 1931, Kurt G√∂del found that this was not the case for the natural numbers plus both addition and multiplication; this system, known as Peano arithmetic, was in fact incompletable. (Peano arithmetic is adequate for a good deal of number theory, including the notion of prime number.) A consequence of G√∂del's two incompleteness theorems is that in any mathematical system that includes Peano arithmetic (including all of analysis and geometry), truth necessarily outruns proof, i.e. there are true statements that cannot be proved within the system. Hence mathematics cannot be reduced to mathematical logic, and David Hilbert's dream of making all of mathematics complete and consistent needed to be reformulated. In 1963, Paul Cohen proved that the continuum hypothesis is independent of (could neither be proved nor disproved from) the standard axioms of set theory. In 1976, Wolfgang Haken and Kenneth Appel used a computer to prove the four color theorem. Andrew Wiles, building on the work of others, proved Fermat's Last Theorem in 1995. In 1998 Thomas Callister Hales proved the Kepler conjecture. relativistic precession of apsides Differential geometry came into its own when Albert Einstein used it in general relativity. Entirely new areas of mathematics such as mathematical logic, topology, and John von Neumann's game theory changed the kinds of questions that could be answered by mathematical methods. All kinds of structures were abstracted using axioms and given names like metric spaces, topological spaces etc. As mathematicians do, the concept of an abstract structure was itself abstracted and led to category theory. Grothendieck and Serre recast algebraic geometry using sheaf theory. Large advances were made in the qualitative study of dynamical systems that Poincar√© had begun in the 1890s. Measure theory was developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Applications of measures include the Lebesgue integral, Kolmogorov's axiomatisation of probability theory, and ergodic theory. Knot theory greatly expanded. Quantum mechanics led to the development of functional analysis. Other new areas include Laurent Schwartz's distribution theory, fixed point theory, singularity theory and Ren√© Thom's catastrophe theory, model theory, and Mandelbrot's fractals. Lie theory with its Lie groups and Lie algebras became one of the major areas of study. Non-standard analysis, introduced by Abraham Robinson, rehabilitated the infinitesimal approach to calculus, which had fallen into disrepute in favour of the theory of limits, by extending the field of real numbers to the Hyperreal numbers which include infinitesimal and infinite quantities. An even larger number system, the surreal numbers were discovered by John Horton Conway in connection with combinatorial games. The development and continual improvement of computers, at first mechanical analog machines and then digital electronic machines, allowed industry to deal with larger and larger amounts of data to facilitate mass production and distribution and communication, and new areas of mathematics were developed to deal with this: Alan Turing's computability theory; complexity theory; Derrick Henry Lehmer's use of ENIAC to further number theory and the Lucas-Lehmer test; R√≥zsa P√©ter's recursive function theory; Claude Shannon's information theory; signal processing; data analysis; optimization and other areas of operations research. In the preceding centuries much mathematical focus was on calculus and continuous functions, but the rise of computing and communication networks led to an increasing importance of discrete concepts and the expansion of combinatorics including graph theory. The speed and data processing abilities of computers also enabled the handling of mathematical problems that were too time-consuming to deal with by pencil and paper calculations, leading to areas such as numerical analysis and symbolic computation. Some of the most important methods and algorithms of the 20th century are: the simplex algorithm, the fast Fourier transform, error-correcting codes, the Kalman filter from control theory and the RSA algorithm of public-key cryptography.  Physics  * New areas of physics, like special relativity, general relativity, and quantum mechanics, were developed during the first half of the century. In the process, the internal structure of atoms came to be clearly understood, followed by the discovery of elementary particles. * It was found that all the known forces can be traced to only four fundamental interactions. It was discovered further that two forces, electromagnetism and weak interaction, can be merged in the electroweak interaction, leaving only three different fundamental interactions. * Discovery of nuclear reactions, in particular nuclear fusion, finally revealed the source of solar energy. *Radiocarbon dating was invented, and became a powerful technique for determining the age of prehistoric animals and plants as well as historical objects. * Stellar nucleosynthesis was refined as a theory in 1954 by Fred Hoyle; the theory was supported by astronomical evidence that showed chemical elements were created by nuclear fusion reactions within stars. =Quantum mechanics= Social sciences  * Ivan Pavlov developed the theory of classical conditioning. * The Austrian School of economic theory gained in prominence. * The fields of sociobiology and evolutionary psychology started uniting disciplines within biology, psychology, ethology, neuroscience, and anthropology.

Taylor was treated by Ludwig Guttmann after an accident in 1956 caused severe paralysis. He went on to compete at numerous Paralympic Games, finding particular success in para table tennis from Rome 1960 to Arnhem 1980. Eight of Taylor's gold medals came in table tennis, along with one in snooker and one in lawn bowls. Paralympics Taylor attended the first Paralympic Games in Rome in 1960, competing in the para table tennis. He won gold in both the men's singles A and, with M. Beck, the men's doubles A. His table tennis successes continued at the 1964 Games in Tokyo as he defended the titles in the reclassified A2 doubles, again with Beck, and the A2 singles against his doubles partner in the final. In Tel Aviv in 1968 Taylor lost in the quarterfinals of the singles competition but won the doubles again, this time partnered with Stephen Bradshaw. Also at these Games he entered the men's pentathlon incomplete, finishing in third place and thus securing a bronze medal. At the 1972 Games in Heidelberg Taylor and Bradshaw lost against German competition in the semi-final, finishing in bronze medal position. Taylor did not compete for the singles title and instead entered the archery competition in a team which included fellow multiple-time Paralympian Jane Blackburn. The partnership of Taylor and Bradshaw returned to winning ways in 1976 in Toronto, while Taylor also entered and won the Men's Tournament A-C snooker. Taylor won the Men's 1B singles table tennis competition in 1980 at the Games in Arnhem, and still competing alongside Bradshaw, beat Austria by straight sets in the doubles final to secure another gold for their country, Taylor's final Paralympic table tennis medal. Taylor found other Paralympic successes in 1980, winning medals in a fifth sport: lawn bowls. He won a bronze medal in singles competition and, alongside David Cale, won gold in the Men's Pairs 1A-1B. Taylor's final successes at the Paralympics came in 1984 in the Games jointly hosted by Stoke Mandeville and New York.

Various types of emergency locator beacons are carried by aircraft, ships, vehicles, hikers and cross-country skiers. In case of an emergency, such as the aircraft crashing, the ship sinking, or a hiker becoming lost, the transmitter is deployed and begins to transmit a continuous radio signal, which is used by search and rescue teams to quickly find the emergency and render aid. The purpose of all emergency locator beacons is to help rescuers find survivors within the so-called \\"golden day\\",Community Emergency Response Team Participant Handbook the first 24 hours following a traumatic event, during which the majority of survivors can usually be saved.  Beacon types = COSPAS-SARSAT 406 MHz Distress Beacons = First generation EPIRB emergency locator beacons Cospas-Sarsat is an international humanitarian consortium of governmental and private agencies which acts as a worldwide dispatcher for search and rescue operations. It operates a network of about 47 satellites carrying radio receivers, which detect distress signals from emergency locator beacons anywhere on Earth transmitting on the international Cospas distress frequency of 406 MHz. The satellites calculate the geographic location of the beacon within 2 km by measuring the Doppler frequency shift of the radio waves due to the relative motion of the transmitter and the satellite, and quickly transmit the information to the appropriate local first responder organizations, which perform the search and rescue. Defined officially as emergency position- indicating radiobeacon stations in the ITU Radio Regulations (Section IV.

Slackwire is not to be confused with slacklining. Description and setup  Usually slackwire utilizes a steel wire in diameter fixed between two anchor points. It can have two single stands with two extending wire pieces each to install the apparatus in an arena, or two A-frame stands with one extending wire piece for each. It can also be mounted between two trees at an appropriate distance apart, or fixed to a ceiling or any points which are strong enough to hold a performer's weight. Wire walking artists usually use soft shoes made of leather. =Slack rope= A slack rope (or slackrope) is very similar to a slackwire. The difference between a slack rope and a slackwire is in the characteristics of rope and wire. A slack rope usually utilizes a rope in diameter. The slackwire and slack rope each have advantages and disadvantages for doing stunts. For example, it is easier and more comfortable to do \\"sliding\\" tricks on a wire than on a rope. On a slack rope a performer can walk without shoes, a feat that is painful on a slackwire. In addition, a slack rope can be used similarly to a cloud swing. =Technique of balance and angle of slackwire= The performer balances or moves on the wire while needing to control the wire beneath him from moving abruptly side to side, making continual adjustments. This skill is similar to balancing a stick on one‚Äôs head or on a finger. Each slackwire performer usually uses his/her own preferred angle of slack and length of the wire. The slack angle is the V-shaped angle created when a performer stands in the middle of the walking part of the wire. The angle depends on how long or short the wire is relative to the distance between two anchor points. This also affects the amplitude of the wire's swing side to side. Some slackwire artists change the angle of the wire during their act.See video in which a Chinese artist performs on the slackwire, changing the angles of the wire with the help of a winch several times during the performance: Video The degree of ease or difficulty for a performer to move the wire is dependent upon how thick the wire or rope is. The heavier the wire or rope, the more inertia is required to move it laterally, and the more force is needed to control its movement or to bring it back to a place of rest. =Skills= A wide range of skills and stunts can be performed on the slack wire or slackrope. Beyond standing and walking, artists can also do turns, lying down, knee stands, sliding, forward and backward rolls, splits, handstands, cartwheels, and headstands. Props such as a ladder, chair, unicycle, bicycle, and even a rola bola have been incorporated into some acts. Some more advanced slackwire stunts are done while the wire is swinging, including standing, handstands, and walking. Slackwire balancing skills also can be combined with tricks as various kinds of juggling, balancing a stick on the performer‚Äôs head, playing a musical instrument, etc. Some of the same skills can be seen in cloud swing or trapeze acts as well. Jumping rope on a slack wire Jumping rope has been performed on the tightrope and slackline, but is difficult on a slackwire because the wire moves when the performer jumps up, and there is no way to control the swing and position of the wire when landing. This makes such stunts as somersaults and acrobatic tumbling virtually impossible. Jumping rope on a slackwire was first accomplished in 1985. The only person to accomplish the stunt is Sergey Pavlov (the clown LALALA). Sergey has been able to complete up to seven consecutive jumps. Video - S. Pavlov - 4 skips and dancingVideo - S. Pavlov - 5 skips Similarities and differences=Slackwire vs. tightrope= Slackwire and tightrope appear to be very similar skills to walking and balancing on a thin wire or rope. In fact, the technique of balance is very different between them. Tightrope performance (Korea) Slackwire and tightwire/tightrope require different balancing techniques: tightrope performers keep their balance by shifting their weight over the rigid tight wire, while slackwire performers use a precise swinging motion to move the relaxed slackwire under their center of mass. Because of this, an artist who works on a tightrope cannot easily make a transition to the slackwire, and vice versa. He/she needs to spend time to train himself/herself to balance in this different manner. Some tightwire artists demonstrate a stunt called ‚Äúthe swings‚Äù, where the artist takes the position on the wire, then his assistant reduces the tension of the wire and the artist demonstrates swings. This stunt involves multiple skills to maintain balance. After the demonstration the assistant adjusts the wire back to its original tightness.Video - Volzhansky family \\"Prometheus\\"/\\"–ü—Ä–æ–º–µ—Ç–µ–π\\", 1977\\" (timer: 4:55) The same stunt can also be demonstrated on a slackline. =Slackwire vs. slackline= Slacklining in a park Slackwire and slackline are not the same; they are different kinds of apparatuses that require different techniques of balancing. * Slackwire utilizes a steel wire in diameter, while slackline utilizes a nylon webbing/strap approximately in width. * A slackwire has a loop and can be used like a swing; a slackline has no loop. The line is stretched tight between two anchor points like a tightrope and can only swing within a very small amplitude. * A slackline can be used like a trampoline, allowing for an easy landing on the line after a jump. In contrast, a slackwire cannot be used like a trampoline, because when a performer jumps up from the loop of wire it will swing away with no way to anticipate its location upon landing.

Bodacious won both of his titles in 1995, while Bruiser won both of his titles in 2017. ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ There was actually a tie between Bruiser, Long John and Pearl Harbor, which was resolved by taking the sum of the bull's best eight outs for the season.

This river crosses successively the cantons of Ventadour, Buade, Poutrincourt, Bouteroue, Ducharme, Aigremont and Graham√©. Forestry is the main economic activity of the sector; recreational tourism activities, second. The southern part of the Normandin River Valley is served by route 212 which connects Obedjiwan, Quebec to La Tuque and passes south of Dubois Lake and Normandin Lake (Normandin River). From there, the forest road R0212 (East-West direction) cuts the course of the Normandin River. The surface of the Normandin River is usually frozen from early November to mid-May, however, safe ice circulation is generally from mid-November to mid-April.

He studied for an engineering apprenticeship at Deeside College before completing a degree course at Glynd≈µr University in Wrexham, then working in DRB. He was elected as MS for Alyn and Deeside at a by-election held on 6 February 2018. He succeeded his father, the previous incumbent Carl Sargeant, after Carl committed suicide in November 2017. At 23 years of age, Jack Sargeant became the youngest ever AM when he was elected to the National Assembly.  Campaigns  Sargeant is an active campaigner in support of World Suicide Prevention Day, an occasion which is held on 10 September each year. He has launched an initiative called The 84, named after the 84 men who take their own lives each week in the UK. The initiative is backed by major sports clubs in Wales, including Cardiff City F.C., Swansea City A.F.C., Newport County A.F.C., Wrexham A.F.C. and Connah's Quay Nomads F.C., who all agreed to share suicide prevention messages with the hashtag #ItsOkNotToBeOk to support the campaign. The clubs have also worked to include suicide prevention messages into fixtures, such as including Samaritans in their match day events on the weekend of 14 and 15 September, and holding bucket collections. Sargeant himself has spoken about the impact of suicide, stating he \\"sometimes finds it difficult to get up in the morning after losing his father Carl.\\" He is also a supporter of Parkinson's UK.

Bauer (originally Baumzweiger) (1913‚Äì1979) was a Russian-born American acoustic engineer, who worked for the Shure microphone company and produced over 100 patents. His early work in acoustics lead to the development of modern sound technology via the Uniphase Electrical Principle. This principle is the source of the famous Unidyne Microphone's name and functionality. Early life Bauer was born in Odessa, Russia, in 1913. His family fled Russia after the 1917 revolution and relocated to Havana, Cuba. At the age of 17, and speaking little English, Bauer moved to New York City to attend the Pratt Institute. After obtaining an Associate Industrial Engineering degree, Bauer matriculated at the University of Cincinnati, pursuing an Electrical Engineering degree. Bauer chose a five-year work/study program and began working as an intern at Shure. When he graduated in 1937, he joined the Shure company in Oak Park, IL, full-time as a transducer development engineer. It was the start of a distinguished career in acoustics and audio that included more than 100 patents.The Unidyne Story: 1939‚Äì2014. 2014, Shure Incorporated.  Uniphase Principle  The year 2013 marked the 75th anniversary of Bauer‚Äôs invention of the Uniphase principle while working for Shure Brothers Incorporated, a microphone manufacturer in Chicago. As a newly graduated engineer, the 25 year-old Bauer developed an acoustical method that produced a directional microphone using only one microphone element. When sound is transmitted through a medium, it must be detected by an object that can convert the inherently mechanical nature of the sound waves into an electric signal. In the human ear, this is accomplished via the organs of the middle ear in conjunction with the hair cells and endolymph of your inner ear. In the Uniphase, sound acts upon the outside of the acoustic diaphragm while it simultaneously enters a phase-shifting acoustic network within the microphone. There, it acts upon the inside of the diaphragm. The diaphragm actuates a transducer converting its motions into equivalent electrical waves: an electric signal that can now be transmitted through an electronic medium like wires. Importantly, in the Uniphase, as sound arrives from the front of the microphone, the inner pressure reinforces the outer pressure, thus allowing noise picked up by the microphone system to be greatly reduced. This Uniphase principle paved the way for the design of the Shure Unidyne Microphone.  Shure Unidyne  Introduced in 1939, the Shure Unidyne is arguably the most recognized microphone in the world. The Unidyne's instant and lasting success has been attributed by its manufacturer as stemming from the fact that, \\"It was the first high-quality unidirectional microphone that was affordable and reduced audio issues such as background noise, feedback and excessive reverberation.\\" On Jan 31, 2014, the Unidyne microphone was granted the IEEE award.  World War II  In 1941, Bauer became a naturalized US citizen. During the Second World War, he worked on acoustic equipment for the US Navy, helping to develop a type of microphone called a Controlled Reluctance or Controlled Magnetic Microphone, known more colloquially as a battle-announcer, because it could be used reliably in a variety of weather including extreme conditions. CBS and Quadrophonic Sound  In 1957, Bauer joined CBS where he helped develop stereo quadrophonic sound. He went on to become the vice president and general manager of the CBS Technology Center in Stamford, CT, where he lived until his death in 1979.

Travellers undergo biometric verification using face, fingerprint, iris recognition or a combination of modalities. After the identification process is complete, a physical barrier such as a gate or turnstile opens to permit passage. E-gates came about in the mid-2000s as an automated method of reading the newly ICAO mandated e-passports. All eGate systems require an e-passport that's machine readable. Some countries permit only specific nationalities to use the automated border crossing systems, e.g. EU/EEA/Swiss/UK citizens or USA/CAN/JPN passport bearers, etc. For all other nationalities, citizens must go to immigration officers to be questioned and then have their passport stamped. They come in different configurations, including a gate, kiosk and gate, or mantrap kiosk. In the gate configuration, an incoming passenger places their passport data page either on or under a scanner, looks at a camera that will take a live picture to compare to the picture in the passport, and walks through a set of barriers that will open if the citizen's identity is verified. At either the passport scan or photo stage, if either identity cannot be verified or a malfunction happens, an immigration officer will step in at that point. Fingerprint and/or iris scans can also be taken depending on the system. The process is the same for departing passengers. In the kiosk and gate configuration, a passenger approaches a kiosk for a facial, finger and passport scan. They then proceed to a set of doors and pass through using their fingerprint. In the mantrap kiosk configuration, a passenger walks through a first set of barriers to a kiosk for a facial, finger and passport scan. They then proceed out through a second set of barriers. The number of e-gate units deployed globally is expected to triple from 1,100 in 2013 to more than 3,200 in 2018, according to a 2014 report by Acuity Market Intelligence. Most e-gates have been deployed in airports in Europe, Australia and Asia. Privacy issues Automated border control systems typically collect personal information such as the information on the biometric page of the passport: name, sex, date of birth, passport number, passport photograph, nationality, and the country of origin of the passport. Other information may also be collected, such as travel details, and the facial biometric template. Travellers‚Äô passport booklets are typically no longer stamped if they are processed by eGates. Australia Smartgate departure gates at Sydney Airport SmartGate is an automated self-service border control system operated by the Australian Border Force and located at immigration checkpoints in arrival halls in eight Australian international airports. SmartGates allow Australian ePassport holders and ePassport holders of a number of other countries to clear immigration controls more rapidly, and to enhance travel security by performing passport control checks electronically. SmartGate uses facial recognition technology to verify the traveller's identity against the data stored in the chip in their biometric passport, as well as checking against immigration databases. Travellers require a biometric passport to use SmartGate as it uses information from the passport (such as photograph, name and date of birth) and in the respective countries' databases (i.e. banned travellers database) to decide whether to grant entry or departure from Australia or to generate a referral to a customs agent. =Eligibility= Smartgate Eligibility Screen at Sydney Airport Travellers are required to hold an ePassport, a valid Australian visa (except for Australian or New Zealand citizens) and complete an arrival card. The system requires travellers to look as much like their passport photo as possible, which may require removing glasses or hats when using SmartGate. Requirements Departing travellers, regardless of age and nationality, can use SmartGate if they have a machine-readable passport and can independently use the machine. Arriving travellers using SmartGate must comply with more stringent conditions: * hold a valid and current biometric passport * are over the age of 16 (over the age of 10, if an Australian passport holder and accompanied by at least two adults) * hold an ePassport issued by one of the following jurisdictions: {style=\\" ; background-color: white; border: 1px solid white; padding: 5px;\\" - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  * Australia (including those aged between 10 and 15 years provided travelling with a minimum of two adults) * Austria * Canada * China * Denmark * France * Finland * Hong Kong SAR * Ireland * Italy * Luxembourg * Japan valign=top * Macao SAR * Malaysia * New Zealand * Singapore * South Korea * San Marino * Sweden * Switzerland * Taiwan * Thailand * United Arab Emirates * United Kingdom * United States  } =Exceptions= There are a number of notable exceptions when entering and departing Australia and using SmartGate. * If airline crew meet the above requirements they are also eligible to use SmartGate or they may continue to use the \\"crew lane\\". * Australian and New Zealand citizens travelling on military orders may not use SmartGate upon arrival. * Australian children aged 10 to 15 years (inclusive) can use SmartGate upon arrival if they are accompanied by at least two adults. =Locations= In Australia, SmartGate is available at nine international airports: Adelaide, Brisbane, Cairns, Canberra, Darwin, Gold Coast, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney. =History= The first trials of SmartGate began in 2002 with Qantas aircrews. The trials were expanded in 2004 to include over 1,000 Qantas platinum frequent flyers, and in 2007 it was launched to the public at Brisbane Airport. Since October 2005, Australia has issued only biometric passports, called ePassports. As the validity of Australian passports do not exceed 10 years, all previous Australian passports have now expired and are now biometric. In May 2015, the Australian Government announced that SmartGate will be launched at air and sea ports, using solely biometrics to identify and process arriving passengers, with a goal of processing 90% of air travellers automatically by 2020. The introduction of biometric arrivals, under the Seamless Traveller initiative, is expected to cost approximately AUD93.7m over 5 years and be completed by March 2019.

European Union and Schengen Area The European Union funded project FastPass, one of the Seventh Framework Programs (FP7), goals to develop and demonstrate a harmonized, modular reference system for European automated border crossing points. Another FP7 project is the ABC4EU project, the primary goal of which is to make border control more flexible by enhancing the workflow and harmonizing the functionalities of ABC e-gates. Most ABC systems in member states of the European Economic Area (EEA) (which includes all the member states of the European Union together with the EFTA states of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) and in Switzerland are available for citizens of the EEA and Switzerland to use since, according to Council Regulation (EC) No 2252/2004, all passports and travel documents issued by EFTA and EU member states shall comply with minimum security standards, and passports must incorporate a storage medium (a chip) that contains the holder's facial image and fingerprints. It was planned that, except for Denmark, Ireland and the UK (which is no longer an EU member state), EU passports would have digital imaging and fingerprint scan biometrics placed on their RFID chips. This combination of biometrics aims to create an unrivalled level of security and protection against fraudulent identification papers. Technical specifications for the new passports have been established by the European Commission.EC News article about the relevant regulations: Council Regulation (EC) 2252/2004, Commission Decision C(2005)409 adopted on 28 February 2005 and Commission Decision C(2006)2909 adopted on 28 June 2006 The specifications are binding for the Schengen agreement parties, i.e. the EU countries, except Ireland and the UK, and three of the four European Free Trade Association countries ‚Äì Iceland, Norway and Switzerland.Council Regulation (EC) No 2252/2004 of 13 December 2004, see preamble 10‚Äì14 These countries were obliged to implement machine readable facial images in the passports by 28 August 2006, and fingerprints by 29 June 2009. According to EU requirements, only nations that are signatories to the Schengen acquis are required to add fingerprint biometrics. =Belgium= Passengers who are over 12 years old and have an electronic EU or Monaco passport can make use of the automated border control gates if they travel to a destination outside the Schengen Area. ABC gates are available at the following locations: * Brussels Airport (also accepts Belgian identity cards) =Czech Republic= Easy Go enables self-service passport clearance for flights. Citizens of the European Economic Area and Switzerland, who are biometric passport holders over 15, can use Easy Go.

A real-life picture is taken to compare individual facial dimensions with the photograph held on the chip in the passport. Passengers travelling with an infant or with a wheelchair still need to choose the manual border control line. The Finnish Border Guard will implement automated border checks for all nationalities. Helsinki Airport has dozens of automated passport machines. These can be used by travellers who have an e-passport (biometric passport). * Citizens of EU, EEA, Switzerland, Japan and South Korea can use the passport machines at arrival and departure. * Citizens of the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand can use the passport machines whenever they are departing. =France= PARAFE gates are operated by the direction centrale de la police aux fronti√®res and located at immigration checkpoints at major French border controls and offer an alternative to using desks staffed by immigration officers. The gates use fingerprint technology and facial recognition to verify the user's identity against the data stored in the chip in travellers' biometric passports. Facial recognition gates are replacing finger recognition gates. Facial recognition is now confirmed as available at all Parafe-hosting border controls. Citizens from the European Economic Area, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino and Switzerland can use the Parafe gates, provided that they are aged 18 and over and holding valid biometric passports. At some arrival controls, minors aged 12+ can also use the Parafe gates, but not when departing. For the finger recognition gates, French, Luxembourg, Belgian and German passport holders were pre-registered, while other passports had to go to a border police officer for registration. While the online documentation has not been updated, at least some other European passports work without pre- registration. It is known that German passports work without pre-registration. German passports, like French passports (but unlike UK passports), have fingerprint information encrypted in the passport chip. Other EEA/Swiss passports with fingerprint information encrypted in the passport chip might work as well. Parafe gates are available at the following locations: * Paris Orly * Paris Charles de Gaulle * Lyon Airport * Marseille Provence Airport * Nice C√¥te d'Azur Airport * Eurostar Paris Gare du Nord Terminal (juxtaposed controls) * Eurostar London St Pancras Terminal (juxtaposed controls) * Eurotunnel Calais Terminal (juxtaposed controls) * Eurotunnel Folkestone Terminal (juxtaposed controls) =Germany= EasyPASS self-service gates at Munich Airport EasyPASS border control system - This is available for passengers over 18 (at most airports) with European Union and European Economic Area and Switzerland EPassports .

Passengers who are over 18 and hold a biometric EU, EFTA, Andorra, Monaco or San Marino passport may use the ABC gates. =Norway= The EasyPass system was introduced in 2012. Two automated self-service passport control units were put in place, designed in collaboration with the National Police Directorate. Oslo Airport was the first in Norway to implement self- service passport control. Initially only Norwegian passport holders were eligible. In the autumn of 2017, eight new e-gates were installed for departing passengers, and during 2017, twelve were installed on arrival. Norwegian and European Economic Area citizens can use the ePassport gates, provided that they are aged 18 and over and hold a valid biometric passport. =Portugal= EGates are available at Lisbon Airport Terminal 1, Faro Airport and Porto Airport. They can be used by citizens with European EPassports who are 18 years old and over. EGates are also available on departure at Lisbon T1 for persons holding passports issued by Canada, United States, Australia, Brazil, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, New Zealand and Venezuela who entered the Schengen Area through Lisbon Airport.https://www.passengerselfservice.com/2016/07/lisbon-expands-automated- border-control-to-9-more-nationalities/ {style=\\" ; background-color: white; border: 1px solid white; padding: 5px;\\" - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  * Australia * Brazil * Canada * Japan * New Zealand * South Korea * Singapore * United States * Venezuela  } After clearing the egate, a border guard performs the final verification and exit stamp. =Spain= At some Spanish borders, Automated Border Control (ABC) is available to all European citizens over 18 with EPassports at immigration halls, operated by the Spanish National Police. They come in either a gate, kiosk and gate, or mantrap kiosk configuration. In the gate configuration, a passenger places their passport on a reader, looks at a camera and walks through a set of barriers. Finger scans are sometimes taken depending on the type of gate. Spanish Airports are replacing original kiosk/mantrap gates with these from providers such as Minsait and Everis. These gates also enable departing passengers to use them. In the kiosk and gate configuration, a passenger approaches a kiosk for a facial, finger and passport scan. They then proceed to a set of doors and pass through using their fingerprint. In the mantrap kiosk configuration, a passenger walks through a first set of barriers to a kiosk for a facial, finger and passport scan. They then proceed out through a second set of barriers. Automated Border Control is available at the following locations: *Port of Algeciras *Alicante Airport *Barcelona Airport *Girona Airport *Ibiza Airport *La Linea de la Concepci√≥n *Madrid Airport *M√°laga Airport *Menorca Airport *Palma de Mallorca Airport *Tenerife South Airport =Switzerland= e-Passport control self-service gates at Z√ºrich Airport Automated passport controls were introduced at Z√ºrich Airport in May 2018. Passengers over 18 who are holders of biometric passports issued by Switzerland, European Union or European Economic Area member states are eligible to use them. Rest of Europe=United Kingdom= ePassport gates in Heathrow Airport (Terminal 4) ePassport gates in Heathrow Airport (Terminal 5) ePassport gates in Gatwick Airport (South Terminal) ePassport gates are operated by the UK Border Force and located at immigration checkpoints in arrival halls in some airports across the United Kingdom, offering an alternative to using desks staffed by immigration officers. The gates use facial recognition technology to verify the user's identity against the data stored in the chip in their biometric passport. The ePassport gates do not accept national identity cards. Citizens with European Economic Area, European Union, Swiss, Australian, Canadian, Japanese, New Zealand, Singaporean, South Korean, and United States passportshttps://www.gov.uk/registered-traveller can use ePassport gates, provided that they are aged either 12 or over and holding valid biometric passports. Users between the ages of 12 and 17 who are using ePassport gates are required to be accompanied by an adult. Holders of valid biometric passports from Andorra, Argentina, Bahamas, Belize, Botswana, Brazil, Brunei Darussalam, Chile, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Vatican City State, Honduras, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Israel, Macao Special Administrative Region, Malaysia, Maldives, Mexico, Monaco, Namibia, Nauru, Nicaragua, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Samoa, Seychelles, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Taiwan (passport must have a personal identification number), Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay can use ePassport gates, provided that they are aged 12 or over and are already enrolled as a \\"Registered Traveller\\". ePassport gates are available at the following locations: * Birmingham Airport * Bristol Airport * Cardiff Airport * East Midlands Airport * Edinburgh Airport * Eurostar St Pancras Terminal (juxtaposed controls) * Eurostar Brussels-Zuid Terminal (juxtaposed controls) * Gatwick Airport (North and South Terminals) * Glasgow Airport * Heathrow Airport (Terminals 2, 3, 4 and 5)‚Ä† * London City Airport * Luton Airport * Manchester Airport (Terminals 1, 2 and 3) * Newcastle Airport * Stansted Airport ‚Ä† Heathrow Airport Terminal 1 became obsolete on 29 June 2015. =Serbia= The automated passport control was introduced to Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport back in December 2010 as a donation of the German company Millbauer. Only Serbian passports are eligible for use. As of now, there is still only one gate and only at arrivals immigration (as everyone, including Serbian citizens, receives an exit stamp on departure) and no further development was announced. = Turkey = Automated Passport Control gates, called \\"Hƒ±zlƒ± Pasaport Ge√ßi≈ü Sistemi\\" (Expedited Passport-Entry System) was introduced first in Istanbul's Sabiha G√∂k√ßen Airport in May 2019, quickly followed by the newly-opened Istanbul Airport in June 2019. Turkish Citizens with a valid, chipped biometric Turkish passport (both old and new chipped- models are accepted) are eligible to use the automated gates, which require passengers to scan their passports and fingerprints, as well as using a facial-recognition system by taking a live photograph of the passenger. In the departure immigration checkpoints, a Turkish Border Police will check the departure tax stamp/card (\\"Har√ß Pulu\\") for Turkish citizens. Receiving an exit or entry stamp is optional for Turkish citizens. Hong Kong e-Channel machines at Hong Kong International Airport Hong Kong's e-Channels are situated at all border crossing points. A person who holds a Hong Kong Identity Card (HKID) inserts the card into a slot to enter the first eGate and then has their thumbprint scanned to pass through the second eGate. The Automated Passenger Clearance System was introduced by the Hong Kong Immigration Department in 2004 and designed to speed up border immigration processes for residents of Hong Kong, Macau and frequent visitors to Hong Kong entering and exiting the territory whether it be by land, air or sea via the use of self-service kiosks employed at various border control points.http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/unpan/unpan027893.pdf =Eligibility= * A Hong Kong permanent resident aged 11 or abovehttp://www.gov.hk/en/residents/immigration/control/echannel.htm (using a smart identity card) * A Hong Kong resident aged 11 or above holding a Document of Identity for Visa Purposes (using a smart identity card and carrying a valid Document of Identity for Visa Purposes) * A person aged 11 or above who has the right to land or is on unconditional stay in Hong Kong (using a smart identity card) * A non-permanent resident issued with a notification label (using a smart identity card and carrying a valid travel document) * A registered cross-boundary primary school student under the age of 11 (using the enrolled valid travel document) * A registered frequent visitor aged 18 or above (using the enrolled valid travel document) * A registered Macau permanent resident aged 11 or above (using a Macau permanent identity card) * A registered Republic of Korea citizen aged 17 or above and enrolled under Smart Entry Service (SES) schemehttp://www.gov.hk/en/nonresidents/visarequire/echannel/kor.htm (using the Republic of Korea Passport valid for at least 6 months and having no adverse record in the HKSAR) *An enrolled holder of a Republic of Singapore Passport aged 11 or abovehttp://www.gov.hk/en/nonresidents/visarequire/echannel/singapore.htm (using a Republic of Singapore Passport valid for at least 6 months, completed 2 trips in past 24 months and having no adverse record in the HKSAR) *An enrolled holder of a Federal Republic of Germany Passport aged 18 or abovehttp://www.gov.hk/en/nonresidents/visarequire/echannel/germany.htm (using a Federal Republic of Germany Passport valid for at least 6 months and having no adverse record in the HKSAR) *An enrolled holder of an Australian Passport aged 16 or abovehttp://www.immd.gov.hk/hkt/services/echannel_visitors.html#australia (using an Australian Passport valid for at least 6 months and having no adverse record in the HKSAR) The user upon entrance to the e-Channel inserts his Hong Kong Identity Card into the card reader (which reads the embedded chip) or places his registered travel document or Macau Identity Card onto the document reader. The channel gate will open, the user takes his Hong Kong identity card or registered travel document or Macau Identity Card and steps in and the gate will close. Thumb or finger is then placed onto the fingerprint reader, once identity has been confirmed, another set of gates in front open allowing exit. If an issue arises and identity cannot be confirmed or a malfunction occurs, an immigration supervisor will be on hand to assist. =Locations= e-Channel machines at Lok Ma Chau Station First made available on 16 December 2004 in Lo Wu Control Point, over the past several years the locations have expanded to include: *Hong Kong International Airport (T1 & T2) *Lo Wu *Hung Hom *Lok Ma Chau Spur Line *Lok Ma Chau *Man Kam To *Sha Tau Kok *Shenzhen Bay *Hong Kong China Ferry Terminal *Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Terminal *Kai Tak Cruise Terminal *Tuen Mun Ferry Terminal By allowing registered users to use the self-service kiosks to pass through Hong Kong immigration, processing time averages around 12 seconds making E-channels far more efficient than traditional immigration counters. =Macau residents= Since its first inception where only Right to Abode Hong Kong Permanent Identity Card holders were permitted to use the self-service kiosks, the program expanded on 12 September 2006; allowing not only those of Right to Land or those with unconditional stay in Hong Kong but also to those residents and non-residents with notification labels to use the E-Channels. The program was expanded further again on 10 December 2009 to allow holders of Macau Resident Identity Card to register for and use of the Hong Kong E-channels to enter and exit the territory. Border cities to Hong Kong on Mainland China's side such as Shenzhen have E-Channels for use of the Home Return Permit cards. =Frequent Visitor Automated Passenger Clearance= Frequent visitors to Hong Kong as well as Macau Resident Card holders can register for Frequent Visitor Automated Passenger Clearance. A valid travel document with a multiple visit visa (if applicable), plus one of the following documents is needed: * A valid HKSAR Travel Pass or * An APEC Business Travel Card with the economy code ‚ÄòHKG‚Äô or * Hong Kong International Airport Frequent Visitor Card or * Frequent Flyer Programme Membership Card issued by an airline which has joined this arrangement (please enquire with your airline). =e-Channel Service for foreign nationals= The Frequent Visitor program was further expanded to nationals of the following countries. Such arrangements are reciprocal and eligible HKSAR passport holders may also enrol for the respective automated border clearance schemes under these countries: * Republic of Korea enrolled under Smart Entry Service (SES) scheme (Since 16 December 2013) * Singapore (Since 22 September 2014) * Germany (Since 1 November 2014) * Australia (Since 20 June 2016) =One Stop Customs and Immigration clearance= A special vehicular E-Channel has been erected for Shenzhen Bay known as One Stop Customs and Immigration Clearance for goods vehicle passing through the Shenzhen Bay Control Point, indicating how versatile this system is, and an asset for the Hong Kong Immigration Department. Japan Japan's J-BIS Biounit is an immigration control system that was introduced into Japanese airports and located at immigration booths. Fingerprints of both index fingers are collected along with a photograph. At the same time, the person is checked against immigration office lists, and criminals, people who were previously deported, and other punished foreigners are prevented from entering Japan. On 20 November 2007, Narita Airport, Kansai International Airport,„ÄåÊåáÁ¥ã„ÇÑÈ°î„Åß„ÉÅ„Çß„ÉÉ„ÇØ Èñ¢Á©∫„Åß„Éê„Ç§„Ç™ÂÖ•ÂõΩÂØ©ÊüªÂÆüÈ®ì„Äç Áî£Áµå„Éã„É•„Éº„Çπ 2007Âπ¥11Êúà12Êó• and Ch≈´bu Centrair International Airport had the system, with plans to roll out the system to the 27 airports and 126 harbours in Japan.„Äå‰∏≠ÈÉ®„Åß„ÇÇÂÖ•ÂõΩÂ§ñÂõΩ‰∫∫„ÅÆÊåáÁ¥ãÊé°Âèñ„ÄåÂΩìÁÑ∂„Äç„ÄåÊá∏Âøµ„ÇÇ„Äç ‰∏≠Êó•Êñ∞ËÅû 2007Âπ¥11Êúà20Êó• Until the start of J-BIS, when people would land in Japan and apply for entry, it was difficult to tell which people had changed their names or used special names on their passports, had been deported, or had criminal records. After the events of 9/11, Japan amended its Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act. On 20 November 2007, the changes to the act went into effect. Most foreigners (everyone except special permanent residents, diplomats, people who were invited by the government, and people under the age of 16) were now required to have fingerprints taken from their two index fingers, as well as a photograph. The J-BIS system was the second system of its type enacted in the world; the first was the United States's US-VISIT system.„ÄåÊù•Êó•Â§ñÂõΩ‰∫∫„ÄéÊåáÁ¥ã„ÉªÈ°îÂÜôÁúü„ÄèÁæ©Âãô„Äç Ë™≠Â£≤Êñ∞ËÅû 2007Âπ¥11Êúà20Êó• The fingerprint scans and photographs are transferred from the airport to the immigration office's servers, and this information is compared against a blacklist in around five seconds. This list is a collection of Interpol information and around 14,000 people that have been searched by Japanese police, as well as the fingerprints and pictures that were recorded from around 800,000 foreigners who were deported from Japan. According to the immigration office, it is predicted that 0.001% of people who enter Japan appear on the blacklist. Since the introduction of the system, 846 people received exclusion orders by immigration authoritiesÈüìÂõΩ‚Äï‰πùÂ∑û„ÉªÂ±±Âè£„ÅßÂØÜËà™ÊÄ•Â¢ó‚Ä¶„Éê„Ç§„Ç™Ë™çË®ºÈÅø„ÅëÊµ∑Ë∑Ø, Yomiuri Shimbun, January 9, 2010 and 8 people were arrested for fabricating their fingerprints.ÂÖ•ÂõΩÂØ©Êüª„ÄÅÊåáÁ¥ãÁ¥∞Â∑•„ÅßÂëäÁô∫Ôºò‰∫∫ ÔºëÔΩûÔºëÔºêÊúà„ÄÅÊ≥ïÂãôÁúÅÈõÜË®à , 47 news, December 6, 2009 The Japan Coast Guard also reported that the number of smugglers crossing the Korea Strait from the Korean peninsula has increased rapidly. Along with the introduction of J-BIS, an \\"Automated gate\\" (Ëá™ÂãïÂåñ„Ç≤„Éº„Éà) was set up at Terminal 1 and 2 at Narita Airport, Haneda Airport, Chubu Centrair Airport and Kansai Airport.„ÄåÊàêÁî∞Á©∫Ê∏Ø„ÄÅ11/20„Çà„ÇäËá™ÂãïÂåñ„Ç≤„Éº„ÉàÂ∞éÂÖ•„Äç H.I.S.Êµ∑Â§ñÂá∫Âºµ„Éã„É•„Éº„Çπ With this system, when a person enters or leaves Japan, rather than having to be processed by a human examiner there, a person can use an eGate, thereby making both entry and departure simpler and easier, as well as more convenient.„ÄåËá™ÂãïÂåñ„Ç≤„Éº„Éà„ÅÆÈÅãÁî®„Å´„Å§„ÅÑ„Å¶„Äç Ê≥ïÂãôÁúÅÂÖ•ÂõΩÁÆ°ÁêÜÂ±Ä 2007Âπ¥11Êúà Japanese people with valid passports, foreigners with both valid passports (this includes refugees with valid travel certificates and re-entry permits) and re-entry permits can use this system. Automated immigration at Narita Airport. The gate works by holding up the identification page of the passport up to the terminal in front of the transparent booth, and the entrance to the booth will open. Inside the booth, there is an equipment to read fingerprints, where prints from two fingers are taken. After confirmation of identity, the exit gate will open. Although there is a worker sitting at the gate, according to the Ministry of Justice immigration office's information guide to the automated gates, most Japanese should be able to use the automated gate. When the automated gate is used, passports are not stamped. When an entry stamp is needed, officials are available near the gate to stamp passports; alternatively, one can use the regular gate. To use Japanese eGates, prior registration is required. For details, see the Ministry of Justice immigration office's information guide. For this advance registration, Japanese people (those who hold Japanese passports), only fingerprints are needed (not an image), as the automated gate does not take a picture. Korea Korea's Smart Entry Service (SeS) is a voluntary program that allows pre-approved and trusted travellers to proceed through Korean immigration using biometric information included in their passports at eGates. Typically this takes less than 12 seconds. Eligible applicants register their fingerprints and facial image in advance and must agree to the use of their registered personal information. South Koreans aged 7 or above, citizens from selected countries, foreigners aged 17 or above and holding Korean Alien Registration Card, foreign crew members with multiple-entry visas, and foreigners holding Korea Priority Card issued by Ministry of Justice are eligible. Foreign nationalities eligible to register include American citizens enrolled in Global Entry, Hong Kong SAR passport holders, Macau SAR passport holders, and Taiwanese passport holders. The nationals must not hold Korean Alien Registration Card. For Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan passport holders, they must not use other passports such as People's Republic of China passport, British National (Overseas) passport, and Portuguese passport when they enter Korea to be eligible. Macau Macau uses the same E-Channel system as Hong Kong. Hong Kong ID Card holders can register. Border cities to Macau on Mainland China's side such as Zhuhai have E-Channels which process Home Return Permit cards. Malaysia Malaysia was the first country in the world to issue biometric passports in 1998. As such, it was among the first to adopt the use of an automated border control system to facilitate immigration clearance for Malaysian citizens. The Autogate system is available at most immigration checkpoints for all Malaysian passport holders. The system uses facial recognition and thumbprint verification to match against information stored in the traveller's biometric passport. Foreign residents with Malaysian long-term passes may register to use the e-Gate system at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. At the two road border checkpoints with Singapore, MBIKE is open to registered Malaysian motorcyclists, using an RFID sticker in the registered user's passport. The Malaysia Automated Clearance System (MACS) can be used by registered Singapore citizens, Singapore permanent residents and foreigners residing in Singapore. However, registration for the MACS scheme has been suspended since August 2018, although existing registered users may continue to use automated clearance until the expiration of their MACS stickers. Mexico Mexico's Viajero Confiable program is only open to Mexican and US citizens who are members of Global Entry. It is a Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI) program and prospective members must pass a background check, interview with a Mexican immigration officer, and have fingerprints and iris scans taken. Kiosks are currently available at the Cancun, Los Cabos, and Mexico City international airports, but the Mexican government hopes to expand it to other cities in the near future. New Zealand New Zealand also operates the Australian manufactured SmartGate system (renamed as eGates) at Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Queenstown airports, but with a more limited list of eligible passports than in Australia: only ePassports issued by New Zealand, Australia, China (excluding Hong Kong SAR), Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, The Netherlands, Singapore, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States can be used. eGates can only be used by travellers 12 years of age or older. (Customs is conducting a trial, in conjunction with other border agencies, about whether to lower the age of eligibility to use eGate for people with an eligible ePassport from 12 years of age to 10 years of age.) New Zealand eGates use biometrics to match the stored image in the ePassport with the picture of the user taken at the gate. To make sure eGate can do this, travellers must make sure they look as similar to their ePassport photos as possible and remove veils, scarves and hats that obscures any part of the face. Glasses may be left in place if worn in the ePassport photo and they have thin frames. eGate can handle minor changes in your face, for example if the travellers' weight or hair has changed. Customs, Biosecurity and Immigration officials will use information provided at eGates, including photos, to clear travellers and their items across New Zealand's border. Biometric information is kept for three months before destruction but other information, including about movements across New Zealand's border is kept indefinitely and handled in accordance with the Privacy Act 1993, or as the law authorises. This might include information being used by or shared with other law enforcement or border control authorities. Singapore The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority of Singapore (ICA) has integrated information technology to streamline the entry and exit procedure at checkpoints. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and other registered travellers can use automated lanes called enhanced-Immigration Automated Clearance System (eIACS). Foreign visitors whose fingerprints are registered on arrival may use the eIACS lanes for exit clearance. The Biometric Identification of Motorbikers (BIKES) System at land checkpoints can be used by residents and work pass holders entering and leaving Singapore by motorcycle. The Frequent Traveller Programme (FTP) allows eligible travellers to enjoy convenient immigration clearance via the eIACS automated clearance facilities. APEC Business Travel Card (ABTC) holders or visitors who have visited at least 2 times within the last 24 months, from certain eligible countries, are able to apply. Eligible countries or regions include Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, United Kingdom (‚ÄúBritish Citizen‚Äù only), New Zealand, Thailand, People's Republic of China (with prior approval of 5-year, multiple-entry visas) and the United States (for citizens who are existing members of the U.S. Global Entry Programme (GEP)), with age variations depending on the type of nationality. In 2016, ICA began the biometric registering and verification of travellers using the Bioscreen system. Singapore citizens and Permanent Residents have their iris bio-data registered as well. In 2019, ICA began trialing using the facial and iris recognition as an upgrade to the current fingerprint recognition at various land and air border checkpoints. Taiwan Taiwan's eGate is a free automated entry system for Taiwanese citizens and certain classes of residents and frequent visitors. Users simply scan their travel documents at the gate and are passed through for facial recognition. Electronic fingerprinting is used when facial recognition fails. Registration is available at the immigration counter right at the port of entry. Thailand Thailand's automated passport control (APC) system at Suvarnabhumi Airport and Don Mueang International Airport has been available for Thai nationals since 2012. Holders of Hong Kong SAR and Singapore ePassports can also use the automated passport control gates. United Arab Emirates The UAE's Smart Gate system allows UAE nationals, UAE residents, GCC nationals, and passport holders of certain counties to arrive and depart the country without the need to see an immigration officer. The process takes 30 seconds. USA Global Entry kiosks Global Entry is a program of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection service that allows pre-approved, low-risk travellers to receive expedited clearance upon arrival into the United States. Sometimes travelers approved for Global Entry can use eGates called kiosks at US locations. As of October 2017, the program was available at 54 US airports and 15 pre-clearance locations. More than 1.8 million people are enrolled in Global Entry and approximately 50,000 new applications for the program are filed monthly. =Enrollment= To enroll in Global Entry, applicants must first file an application with US Customs and Border Protection, and then submit to an interview and background check. The wait for an interview may be months. There is a US$100 non-refundable fee for the application, even for infants and children (some credit cards reimburse this fee). During the interview, the applicant's fingerprints are captured and a digital photo is taken. Applicants are also given instructions on how to use the automated kiosk. Once an application is approved, the applicant may use the Global Entry kiosk at any participating airport for a duration of five years past one's next birthday following approval. Renewal requires an additional fee. Enrollment eligibility Countries participating in Global Entry (for travelers entering into the United Stated) Countries currently participating in Global Entry include the following: (eligible through NEXUS program)  * (no new applications possible,https://insideflyer.nl/registered-traveller-program-nederland-maakt- global-entry-toegankelijk/ new program in progress, but no ETA available)  (US citizens and lawful permanent residents) =Entry procedure= Enrolled users must present their machine-readable passport or permanent residency card, and submit their fingerprints to establish identity. Users then complete a computerized customs declaration, and are issued a receipt instructing them to either proceed to baggage claim, or to a normal inspection booth for an interview. Participants may enter the United States (or the United States pre-clearance area in select international airports) by utilizing automated kiosks located at the following airports: *Abu Dhabi International Airport (AUH)Anchorage ‚Äì Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport (ANC) *Atlanta ‚Äì Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) *Austin-Bergstrom International Airport (AUS) *Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI) *Boston ‚Äì Logan International Airport (BOS) *Burlington International Airport (BTV)Calgary International Airport (YYC) *Charlotte-Douglas International Airport (CLT) *Chicago Midway International Airport (MDW)Chicago O'Hare International Airport (ORD) *Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport (CVG) *Cleveland Hopkins International Airport (CLE) *Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) *Daniel K.

Three to five percent of those who sign up for the program are rejected; in such cases, they are generally told the reason for the rejection. For example, paying a fine for having a prohibited or undeclared item at a US port of entry generally will ensure disqualification. Those whose Global Entry applications are denied have three ways to appeal: making an appointment to speak with a supervisor at a \\"trusted traveler enrollment center\\", e-mailing the Trusted Traveler Ombudsman, or filing a complaint through the Department of Homeland Security's \\"Traveler Redress Inquiry Program\\". CBP claims that in less than one percent of cases in which Global Entry was granted, it will be revoked. In these situations, an explanation for the revocation is not necessarily supplied. =History= During the 1990s and early 2000s, the US Immigration and Naturalization Service operated INSPASS, a trusted traveler program designed to integrate with Canadian and European programs, at JFK and Newark Airports. INSPASS operated with a similar system, identifying travellers with their handprint. The program was discontinued in 2002 when the INS was merged with US Customs to form US Customs and Border Protection.http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/systems/inspass.htm USPASS (formerly INSPASS) The Global Entry program was initially deployed at a small number of airports, including New York-JFK (Terminal 4), Washington-Dulles and Houston-Intercontinental. Following a good reception by travellers, the program was expanded to include Los Angeles International, Atlanta-Hartsfield, Chicago-O'Hare and Miami International Airport. In May 2009, Global Entry membership was expanded to include Netherlands citizens who were also members of the Dutch Privium trusted traveller program under the FLUX (Fast Low-risk Universal Crossing) alliance. Present members of Global Entry are now permitted to apply to join the Privium program at Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport allowing entry into the Schengen area. Members of NEXUS and SENTRI are also entitled to use Global Entry.

Exeter, Rhode Island. January 25, 1751- d. Hopewell, Ontario, New York, United States 18 Mar 1816) was one of the most successful American privateers of the American Revolution, capturing 28 British vessels on the Marlborough. He also led the land forces in the Raid on Lunenburg (1782) during the American Revolution.Soldiers and Sailors of the Revolution, p.393  Career  Babcock was commissioned to the Rhode Island Privateer Ship Marlborough on 11 December 1777. Babcock made an extended cruise on the African coast, capturing or destroying twenty-eight vessels and destroying the British trading station on the √éles de Los. Upon returning to Boston Babcock fell in with the British vessel Hope, under the command of Joseph Browne. The fight lasted for two hour and Babcock destroyed the mast, rigging and sails of the Hope. The Hero also lost one and two were wounded including the captain. Despite the damage, the Hope was able to escape to halifax and arrived on 26 September 1778. On 18 January 1779, Babcock ransacked the brigantine Lord Clark (actually the Lord Clare) and the brig Nautilus under the command of Hawson. In March 1779, Babcock was commissioned to the Massachusetts Privateer Ship General Mifflin (20 guns, 100). Babcock fell in with The Tartar (26 guns, 160 men). Babcock killed the captain of the Tartar and twenty-two men, while the Babcock only lost two men. Mifflin had taken two other prizes a store ship named The Elephant and the Brig Betsey. He had captured about 200 prisoners, which he traded for Americans taken prisoner by the British. On 7 September 1779 Babcock fell in with a sloop of war and fought her for 1.5 hours. The Americans had three killed and seven wounded and were much shot up in the masts and rigging and so bore away.[Allen, MPR, 149] In 1780 he commanded the Mifflin with an uncle of Oliver Hazard Perry as a member of his crew.

He also donated large sums of money to political causes. In 2020 he was convicted of bribery and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and sentenced to seven years and three months in federal prison.  Early life and education  Greg Lindberg was born in San Mateo, California, United States in 1970, the youngest of five children. His father was an airline pilot. He attended Crystal Springs Uplands School in Hillsborough, California before studying at Yale University, where he graduated with an economics degree in 1993.  Career = Global Growth = In 1991, while still attending Yale University, Lindberg launched Home Care Week, a health insurance compliance and reimbursement newsletter for home health agencies. He later transformed this venture into a conglomerate, Eli Global, based in Durham, North Carolina. The conglomerate operated as an information and financial services company. In 2012 Lindberg began investigating the possibility of acquiring insurance companies, displaying a particular interest in the large number of assets retained by such companies to fulfill payouts. In 2014 Eli Global made its first insurance acquisition when it purchased a burial-policy insurer based in Alabama. Lindberg wished to loan the insurer's assets to other businesses he owned, but the number of the company's assets he could invest in affiliated enterprises was restricted by Alabama state laws. Lindberg then relocated the insurer to North Carolina, where regulations on such practices were vaguer, and began trading the burial-policy insurer's investments in treasury bonds for large loans in his own companies. Though North Carolina regulators usually enforced a cap of affiliated investments on insurers at 10% of their assets, the North Carolina Department of Insurance led by North Carolina Commissioner of Insurance Wayne Goodwin reached a special agreement with Lindberg, allowing his burial-policy insurer to invest as much as 40% of its assets in affiliates, though this limit was also eventually breached. In 2015 and 2016 Lindberg acquired more insurers and grouped them together as the Global Bankers Insurance Group. As a result of the insurer acquisitions, Eli Global became markedly more profitable. Lindberg ultimately loaned about $2 billion from the insurance companies he had acquired to his affiliated corporations, using much of it to expand his private holdings. By 2019 he had acquired over 100 companies. On June 27, 2019 the North Carolina Department of Insurance placed several of Lindberg's insurance companies into \\"rehabilitation\\", citing concerns about their liquidity and ability to meet their obligations to policy holders. In late July North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper signed a legislative proposal‚Äîcreated in reaction to Lindberg's investment strategy and widely dubbed \\"the Linbderg bill\\"‚Äîinto law setting a statutory limit on affiliated investments by insurers at 10% of their assets. Eli Global was re-branded as Global Growth in September and Lindberg resigned as its chief executive officer. Following the public disclosure of Lindberg's personal legal troubles and those of his companies, he and some of his companies were sued by several corporations for failure to uphold business agreements. = Political donations = Lindberg is registered as an independent voter. In February 2016 Lindberg made his first financial contribution to a political cause in North Carolina, donating to North Carolina Commissioner of Insurance Wayne Goodwin's reelection campaign. That month he also hosted a fundraiser for Goodwin. Lindberg then began funding N.C. Opportunity Committee, a political action committee which produced pro-Goodwin advertisements. A spokesman for Lindberg asserted that Linberg appreciated that Goodwin was a \\"business-minded insurance commissioner\\" and that his donations were unrelated to the insurance department's handling of Lindberg's businesses during Goodwin's tenure. Between 2016 and 2018 he donated over $7.5 million to independent expenditure political action committees, state political committees, and federal political committees. Most of his contributions were given to members of the Republican Party, though he also gave a significant amount of money to members of the Democratic Party. In May 2018 N.C. Opportunity Committee dissolved and about a month later Lindberg created N.C. Growth and Prosperity, a new North Carolina- based political action committee. In November 2017 Lindberg began donating money to political candidates' campaign funds in Florida, the same month one of his companies was declared \\"financially impaired\\" and thus restricted from doing business by state regulators. He became one of the largest individual donors to Florida Republicans during the 2018 elections, which included a transfer of $350,000 to political action committees supporting Rick Scott's candidacy for the U.S. Senate and other contributions to local legislative leaders and Chief Financial Officer of Florida Jimmy Patronis, whose office oversaw the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation. He also donated at least $25,000 to Louisiana Commissioner of Insurance Jim Donelon's reelection campaign either personally or through his companies. = Criminal indictment and conviction = In late 2017, Lindberg became frustrated with the lending limits placed on the assets of his insurance firm, Global Bankers Insurance Group, by North Carolina Deputy Commissioner of Insurance Jackie Obusek. After several heated exchanges with Obusek, Lindberg and two business associates, John Gray and John Palermo Jr., began meeting with North Carolina Commissioner of Insurance Mike Causey, a Republican, to discuss Obusek's position in regulating the insurance firm. Lindberg suggested that Palermo be hired by Causey to regulate his companies. By January 2018 Causey had informed law enforcement officials of the meetings and he began assisting the Federal Bureau of Investigation as the agency investigated Lindberg's entreaties. Over the course of the discussions, Lindberg ultimately donated about $250,000 to the North Carolina Republican Party. On March 18, 2019, Lindberg, Gray, and Palermo, along with the chair of the North Carolina Republican Party, Robin Hayes, were indicted by a federal grand jury for financial crimes including wire fraud and bribery. According to the indictment, Lindberg and his associates‚Äîcoordinating with Hayes‚Äîpromised to donate millions of dollars to the North Carolina Republican Party in exchange for favorable treatment of Global Bankers Insurance Group by Causey and the dismissal of the deputy insurance commissioner responsible for regulating Lindberg's businesses. In April the U.S. Department of Justice seized over $1.4 million from N.C. Growth and Prosperity bank accounts. Lindberg maintained his innocence; in a motion he filed seeking dismissal of the charges, Lindberg asserted that the contributions he made and requests to Causey did not constitute bribery. The motion was rejected by a federal judge. Lindberg's trial began on February 18, 2020, in Charlotte, North Carolina, presided over by United States District Judge Max O. Cogburn Jr.. During the proceedings the prosecutors played recordings of conversations made between Lindberg and Causey. During the conversations Lindberg and his associates repeatedly urged Causey to reassign the deputy insurance commissioner who they felt was damaging his companies' reputation. They promised that in return they would give Causey millions of dollars to fund his reelection campaign, funneling the money through an independent expenditure committee and later the North Carolina Republican Party. Lindberg's attorneys accused Causey of trying to entrap Lindberg, possibly as retaliation for the businessman's backing of Goodwin as Commissioner of Insurance in the previous election. On March 5, 2020, Lindberg was found guilty of conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud and bribery by the jury. Following the verdict, Lindberg filed a lawsuit against Causey, accusing him of abusing power and entrapment. Cogburn was alerted to possible attempts by Lindberg's lawyers to contact members of the jury after their deliberation. Cogburn forwarded the information to a United States Attorney's office to investigate possible jury harassment charges. After he was convicted, Lindberg filed a motion seeking a judgment of acquittal or a new trial; the motion was denied. In June 2020, Lindberg, citing in-part his own legal difficulties, donated money to the American Civil Liberties Union, saying that he was \\"disturbed by the consequences of prosecutorial abuses and unjust incarceration of non-violent offenders for some time.\\" On August 19, Lindberg was sentenced to seven years and three months in prison, to be followed by three years of probation, and was also ordered to pay a fine of $35,000. On September 2, his attorney filed for an appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. The lower court ordered him to report to Federal Prison Camp, Montgomery on October 20, 2020.  Personal life  In 2013 Lindberg claimed to maintain a net worth of $340 million. Following his increased activity in the insurance industry in 2014, Lindberg began spending significantly more money on his private life than he had previously done. He purchased homes in Idaho and the Florida Keys, as well as making the largest- ever purchase for a private home in Raleigh, North Carolina. He also acquired a yacht and a private jet. In late 2017 a spokesperson stated that his net worth was $1.7 billion. Following his indictment, the home he purchased in Raleigh was put up for sale. In July 2020 he released a letter written by the Berkeley Research Group which declared his personal net worth to be \\"between $860 million and $1.46 billion\\". Lindberg married Tisha and had three children with her. They later became estranged, separating in 2017. As of 2019, the two were seeking divorce. Following the couple's separation, Lindberg began dating other women. He hired dozens of private investigators to observe and track the women; some women were followed at all times. Lindberg maintained that this was only done to ensure that the women were not living unhealthy or destructive lifestyles‚Äîsuch as taking narcotics‚Äîand told the operatives he hired that the women had consented to surveillance. Reports from the private investigators obtained by The Wall Street Journal indicated that Lindberg was particularly interested in the interactions the women had with other men. Some of the operatives were also doubtful that the women had consented to surveillance.

He was serving in Africa as an instructor for Intermountain Aviation, a CIA front company, training Cuban exile pilots to fly armed T-28 Trojan piston aircraft against communist-backed Simba rebels. Prior to serving in the CIA, Merriman had served in the 82nd Airborne Division. In 1964, against Agency orders, Merriman flew a strafing mission against a Simba convoy. His T-28 aircraft was hit by ground fire and he managed to reach an airfield before crashing. He was recovered the following morning and taken back to base where he died of his injuries several weeks later. Medical evacuation of the wounded Merriman was not considered a priority for the U.S. embassy, who were seeking to conceal CIA involvement in combat operations in the region. As a result, reports indicated that the crashed pilot was actually a Cuban and he was checked into a local hospital under the name 'Mario Carlos'. Inattention and lack of medicine contributed to his detertoraiting condition, eventually dying of a lung embolism aboard a U.S. Air Force transport plane as he left the country on 20 August 1964. Upon his death, Merriman's wife was told that her husband had died in a hospital in Puerto Rico as a result of a car accident.

A few months later, Charity and all the children were captured and returned to Maryland. On her next escape, she left her two sons, Levin Jr. and Peter, in the care of their grandmother, and reached New Jersey again with her two daughters, Mahalia and Kiturah.

Their youngest son was William Still (c1820-1902), a Philadelphia businessman who worked with the Pennsylvania Society for the Abolition of Slavery.

Life  Lettice Cautley Ramsey (n√©e Baker) was born on 2 August 1898 in Guildford, Surrey, England. Her father Cecil was a surveyor and her mother Frances (n√©e Davies-Colley) was a painter, trained at the Slade. The Baker family moved to County Sligo, Ireland, soon after Lettice's birth, where Cecil Baker had leased rights to oyster farming in the estuary near Rosses Point. Ramsey's father died when she was a small child; her mother remarried in 1915. She attended Bedales, then Newnham College, Cambridge, where she studied philosophy. After working for a brief time in vocational guidance in London, she returned to Cambridge to work in the Psychology Library. In 1925, she married mathematician Frank P. Ramsey, and they had two daughters before his early death in 1930 from liver disease. To support her family, Ramsey took a photography course at Regent Street Polytechnic. Introduced to photographer Helen Muspratt by artist F. H. \\"Fra\\" Newbery, the two women opened a studio together in Cambridge in 1932. Lettice Ramsey died on 12 July 1985 in Cambridge, England.  Work  The photography studio, Ramsey & Muspratt, was a successful commercial venture, and the pair photographed influential social, academic, and artistic figures in Cambridge throughout the 1930s. Muspratt moved to Oxford in 1937 and opened a second studio there; Ramsey maintained the studio in Cambridge, and both retained the Ramsey & Muspratt studio name. They remained close throughout their lives. In the 1930s, the Ramsey & Muspratt studio was noted for using the solarization process in some portrait work; two of the firm's photographs were accepted in the London Salon of Photography in both 1936 and 1937. While Ramsey's Cambridge work was primarily portraiture, she photographed on her travels, including Russia in 1933, an around-the-world trip in 1948, and later travel to Nepal, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Mexico. She visited Cambodia in the late 1960s. Fourteen of Ramsey's portraits of the Bloomsbury Group were published in a calendar by the Charleston Trust in 1990. In 2012‚Äì2013, the National Portrait Gallery, London presented an exhibition of Ramsey & Muspratt work exploring Ramsey's friendship with the Bloomsbury Group poet Julian Bell.

The new Standard Gauge Railway (SGR), is intended to replace the old, inefficient metre-gauge railway system. Location The railway system would consist of four major sections: ; Malaba‚ÄìKampala Section Also referred as the Eastern Line, would stretch from the border with Kenya at Malaba, through Tororo and Jinja, to end at Kampala, the capital and largest city in Uganda. The total distance of this section is approximately . ; Tororo‚ÄìGulu Section Also referred to as the Northern Line, would extend from Tororo, and go through Mbale and Lira to Gulu, a distance of approximately . From Gulu, one spur will continue north to Elegu and on to Nimule and Juba in South Sudan. The section in Uganda, measures approximately . Another extension stretches from Gulu southwestwards through Pakwach to end at Goli at the Border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a distance of approximately . ; Kampala‚ÄìMpondwe Section This is referred to as the Western Line. It starts in Kampala and passes through Bihanga in Ibanda District, continuing on to Mpondwe at the border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a distance of about . ; Bihanga‚ÄìMirama Hills Section This is also referred to as the Southwestern Line. It stretches from Bihanga, through Ibanda and Mbarara to end at Mirama Hills, at the border with Rwanda, a distance of about . Overview This 1435 mm (4 ft in) railway line is intended to ease the transfer of goods between the port of Mombasa and the city of Kampala, and subsequently to Kigali in Rwanda, and to Beni in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to Nimule and Juba in South Sudan. Goods would travel from Mombasa along the Kenya Standard Gauge Railway to Malaba, at the border with Uganda, and transfer on to this railway system. In April 2017, preliminary estimates for the entire Uganda SGR Project were quoted at USh45.6 trillion (approximately US$12.8 billion). In March 2019, during a state visit to Kenya, President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and his host, President Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya, jointly, publicly committed to extend the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) to Kampala via Malaba. Construction The construction, is expected to be financed by the government of Uganda, using borrowed money from the Exim Bank of China. However, the loan cannot be approved by the lender until Kenya finalizes the funding arrangement for the Naivasha‚ÄìKisumu‚ÄìMalaba section of its SGR. The Malaba-Kampala section, with associated train stations and railway yards, measuring , is budgeted to cost US$2.3 billion. Once funding is secured, the construction of the Eastern Line is expected to last 42 months. The entire SGR in Uganda will cost an estimated $12.8 billion. In May 2018, the EastAfrican reported that Uganda may scale back on starting major infrastructure projects, in an effort to reduce its fiscal deficit in the run- up to joining the East African Monetary Union in 2024. One of the requirements for joining the EAC monetary union is that a partner state maintains a fiscal deficit of not more than 3 per cent of GDP, for three consecutive years prior to joining the monetary union. The SGR project may be one of those delayed or scaled back.

Ranacher is also a cancer survivor, wife, mother of two sons, pilot, cook, bull catcher and cattle musterer, bulldozer driver and accomplished horsewoman. She lives with her Austrian-born husband Franz and two sons, Ben and Franz. Ranacher's LinkedIn profile lists her as 'Director' of 'Farming' 'Industry' located in the Northern Territory of Australia. Early life Ranacher is the eldest daughter of American ex- serviceman, Charles and his wife, acclaimed author Sara Henderson, and was raised on the remote topend cattle station Bullo River in the Victoria River District of the Northern Territory of Australia. She and husband Franz acquired the property in March 2001 from her mother after a legal battle documented on the ABC's Australian Story 2001. The Ranachers hoped to create a unique ecotourism destination at Bullo River. Life in the Northern Territory Bullo River was put on the market for the first time in 2011, amidst the fallout from Indonesian live cattle export bans. An interview with Ranacher was broadcast on the Nine Network's 60 Minutes program about the effect of the Gillard government's bans. This prompted the August 2011 Cattlemen's drive to Canberra from Perth and Cairns. In early 2012, Ranacher's small Cessna airplane's engine failed while she was searching for cattle on the Victoria River floodplain; forcing her to land wheels up on a mud bank of a three kilometer wide river with a fast incoming tide of 7.5 meters. She struggled through the mud, then swam 500 meters to the riverbank. Ranacher later said \\"our bad fortune losing the plane was in fact good fortune\\". Ranacher received an insurance payout from the crash of the Cessna and she said that this enabled them to hang on, though tenuously, until later in the year when with a second bit of luck they were able to sell floodplain cattle for a good price. \\"It gave us the option of turning away offers for Bullo that didn't meet our benchmark\\". Bullo was put on the market for the second time, and sold for $9-$10 million in 2016. Writing Ranacher's first book Bullo: The Next Generation is biographical and coveys her deep love and connection for her home and land and details the hardships of both the bush and those between family members; culminating in the acrimonious court battle with mother Sara Henderson over the future of Bullo. A review of Bullo: The Next Generation emphasizes Ranacher's business wisdom and entrepreneurial spirit; along with her appreciation of nature and the complexities of outback life in Australia. It is obvious Ranacher was not a struggling station owner, but a wise business person making deliberate business decisions.

The company started with two sheds and expanded as port activities grew. The company was also involved in the offloading of kerosene and petrol at the Ijora Wharf from firms such as Vacuum Oil Company, and it later added railway contracting services. In 1959, the firm was involved in the establishment of a stevedoring business in Tema, Ghana. The firm was highly respected and up till 1964, was the sole contractor handling loading and offloading of cargo in Apapa. Biney was also involved in labour related activities.

This lake is entirely located in the canton of Ventadour which is at the end West of the MRC Le Domaine-du-Roy. Forestry is the main economic activity of the sector. Recreational tourism activities come second. The forest road route 212 linking Obedjiwan, Quebec and La Tuque pass south of Dubois Lake and Normandin Lake. Other secondary forest roads serve the vicinity of the lake. The surface of Normandin Lake is usually frozen from early November to mid-May, however safe ice circulation is generally from mid-November to mid-April.

The name of the lake evokes the work of the life of the surveyor Joseph-Laurent Normandin. The latter had traveled the region of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean in 1732 to draw a detailed map of the place by locating the lakes, large and small, and to fix the boundaries of the Domaine du Roi. Normandin also wrote a journal entitled Journal de voyage that Joseph-Laurent Normandin had made in the King's domain in Canada from the Chicoutimi post office to the height of the land in 1732.

Club career Haimie was initially a defender in his youth years, even managing to represent Brunei in an under-15 tournament held in Malaysia in June 2013 while playing in that position. He converted into a goalkeeper by the time he was brought in by Panchor Murai FC debuting in the Brunei Premier League in 2015. The following season, Haimie was placed by NFABD to play for Tabuan U21, the league team of the national under-21 side in the Super League. He was largely an understudy to Ishyra Asmin Jabidi in his time there. Haimie returned to Panchor Murai FC in the first half of 2017, unfortunately his side finished last in the Premier League with only five points from a possible 24. His performances for the national under-23s instigated a move to Indera SC for the second half of the 2017 Super League season, and found regular playing time there. At the end of the season, he became the league's Best Player by helping Indera to third place, despite only at the club halfway through. In February 2018, Haimie joined Brunei's professional side DPMM FC after impressing new head coach Ren√™ Weber at a pre- season trial. He made his league debut against Home United on 7 April in a 4‚Äì2 win, unfortunately scoring an own goal in the 75th minute. On 3 June, he was sent off for violent conduct on Taku Morinaga in the 74th minute during the 5-0 loss against Albirex Niigata (S). Haimie lost his place in the 2019 season after a rejuvenated Wardun Yussof became the captain and undisputed starter for Adrian Pennock. Haimie made his only league appearance on 18 July against Hougang United in a 3‚Äì1 loss after Wardun suffered an injury in the warm-up before the game. He also appeared in two Singapore Cup games, including the third-place match against Geylang International on 2 November when after the sides went to penalties after a 2‚Äì2 score, Haimie was able to score his spot- kick after all 20 outfield players' attempts have been successful. Immediately after, Andrei Varankow had his penalty saved by Zainol Gulam to leave DPMM in fourth place. Haimie left DPMM at the start of 2020 to start a career with the Royal Brunei Police Force. International career As part of Tabuan U21, Haimie was invited to train with the full national team for a regional tournament in Sabah, Malaysia in January 2016. The following October, he joined up with the squad yet again for two friendly matches against the Malaysian national under-22 squad. He was not selected for the 2016 AFF Championship qualification matches, nor the 2016 AFC Solidarity Cup; Ishyra Asmin Jabidi was chosen instead. Haimie's luck made an upturn in 2017 when he was selected to play ahead of Ishyra for the first match of the 2018 AFC U-23 Championship qualification held in Myanmar in July for the Brunei under-23s, against regional giants Australia. He performed admirably, keeping out the Olyroos' 10 chances in the first half alone, before a 53rd-minute penalty by George Blackwood and a Riley McGree strike in the last five minutes sank the Young Wasps to a 2‚Äì0 defeat. He drew praise from opposition coach Josep Gombau and subsequently kept his place for the remainder of the tournament. The following month, the Under-23s competed in the 29th SEA Games held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Haimie started the opening game of the tournament against the hosts and once again kept the scoreline to a minimum, only conceding twice to the Young Tigers. Two defeats to Myanmar and Laos followed where he let in nine unanswered goals. He was benched for Ishyra in the last deadwood game against Singapore. In December 2017, Haimie was recalled to the national team for the 2017 Aceh World Solidarity Tsunami Cup and played in the 4‚Äì0 loss against Indonesia. The next year, he was selected for the 2018 AFF Suzuki Cup qualification matches against Timor-Leste in early September. He gained his first full national team cap on 1 September in the first leg at Kuala Lumpur in a 3‚Äì1 loss. He kept a clean sheet in the second leg at home, but the Wasps failed to progress to the tournament proper with only a 1‚Äì0 win at Hassanal Bolkiah National Stadium on 8 September. Haimie played for Brunei U23 at the 2020 AFC U-23 Championship qualification games held in Vietnam, starting against Thailand in the second match on 24 March. He scored an own goal for the final Thai goal of the night in a 0‚Äì8 loss. He was also a starter in the following game against Indonesia which finished in a 2‚Äì1 defeat for the Young Wasps. Despite losing his place to Wardun Yussof as the starting goalkeeper for DPMM in the 2019 season, he was the national team starting goalkeeper against Mongolia for the 2022 World Cup qualification matches in June of that year. The Wasps failed to progress to Round 2, losing 2‚Äì3 on aggregate. Haimie was selected for the 30th Southeast Asian Games football tournament held in the Philippines on November-December 2019. He played in three out of five matches, including the third game against Laos when he had to be subbed in due to the dismissal of Ishyra Asmin Jabidi.

Prior to his appointment at the University of Minnesota, Bates was a member of the technical staff at AT&T; Bell Laboratories from 1982-1989. He is well-recognized for his wide-ranging research in polymer science, especially, his contributions to the fundamental understanding of the phase behavior of polymer blends and to the physics of microphase separated block copolymers. According to Web of Science, he has produced over 400 published works that have been cited over 36,000 times with an h-index of 97 as of February 15, 2018. He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2002, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2010, and National Academy of Sciences in 2017. Early life and education  Frank S. Bates was born on April 10, 1954 in New York, New York. He received his bachelor's degree in mathematics at the State University of New York‚ÄìAlbany in 1976. Working under the supervision of Robert E. Cohen at MIT, Bates received his S.M. in chemical engineering in 1979 and his Sc.D. in chemical engineering in 1982. His dissertation was titled \\"An Investigation of Structure and Properties in a Model Set of Diblock Copolymer‚ÄìHomopolymer Blends.\\" Bates subsequently joined the technical staff at AT&T; Bell Laboratories. Bates and his wife, Janis, have three children.  Contributions to polymer science  Bates is internationally recognized for his outstanding contributions and achievements as a polymer scientist. In a seminal paper published in Physical Review Letters in 1985, Bates demonstrated that isotopically labeled polymers (e.g., perdeuterated poly(1,4-butadiene)) could macrophase separate from their unlabeled counterparts and that these polymer blends exhibit upper critical solution behavior. This work impacted future studies of polymer blend phase behavior using neutron scattering, and it helped to establish Bates' reputation as an expert in the use of neutron scattering the study of soft materials science. Bates' research in polymer science focuses primarily on the self-assembly of block copolymers into ordered nanoscale morphologies, the dynamics of block copolymers and polymer blends, and the useful bulk physical properties of these materials. One of his most significant contributions in experimental polymer physics is a comprehensive understanding of the thermodynamically-driven microphase separation of diblock copolymers with quantitative comparisons to theories developed by Ludwik Leibler and others. This work has had impact on the design of commercial multiblock copolymers for widespread applications. Bates is also credited with supplying a detailed understanding of the formation of bicontinuous and tricontinuous network phase morphologies in block copolymers, including the conclusive identification of the double gyroid morphology in diblock copolymers and the discovery of the first two orthorhombic network phases in soft materials. Bates has also furnished deep insights into the role of thermodynamic fluctuations in copolymer melts, culminating recently in the discovery of block copolymers that form the Frank-Kasper sigma-phase and a dodecagonal quasicrystal. As a chemical engineer, Bates has parlayed insights from his fundamental research into the invention and development of useful commercial materials. In partnership with the Dow Chemical Company, Bates aided the development of multiblock copolymers based on hydrogenated polystyrene (also known as poly(cyclohexylethylene) or poly(vinylcyclohexane)) for applications including compact discs, DVDs, and optical display films. The American Chemical Society recognized this fruitful collaboration between academic and industrial scientists with the 2008 ACS Cooperative Research Award. Dow and the Bates laboratory have also developed a class of inexpensive block copolymers for toughening certain epoxy resins, which commonly used in microelectronics circuit boards, as well as new excipients for solubilizing otherwise intractable therapeutics for oral drug delivery.  Awards, honors, and professional service  For his outstanding research and education efforts, Bates has received numerous awards including: *1989 John H. Dillon Medal from the American Physical Society *1997 Polymer Physics Prize from the American Physical Society *2004 David Turnbull Lectureship Award from the Materials Research Society *2008 American Chemical Society Cooperative Research Award from the Division of Polymeric Materials Science & Engineering *2008 Sustained Research Prize from the Neutron Scattering Society of America *2012 Institute Lecturer of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers. *2014 Cozzarelli Prize, Applied Science and Engineering, PNAS In addition to being elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2002, he is also a fellow of the American Physical Society (1992), the American Association for the Advancement of Science (2005), the American Academy of Arts & Sciences (2010), the National Academy of Sciences (2017), and the National Academy of Inventors (2018). Bates is also known for his expertise and advocacy for neutron scattering science facilities in the U.S., evidenced by service as the Chair of the National Committee for an Advanced Neutron Source (1990-1995), President of the Neutron Scattering Society of America (1996-1999), and as a member of the Advisory Committee for the Center for Nanophase Materials Science at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. He has served the broader scientific community as a former divisional associate editor for Physical Review Letters (1994-1999) and a member of the reviewing board of editors of Science (1997-2002). During his tenure as department head (1999-2014) in chemical engineering and materials science at the University of Minnesota, Bates has led multiple fundraising initiatives. In 2006, he initiated an ambitious and successful campaign to raise $20 million to endow first-year graduate fellowships in his department. More recently, Bates garnered a $5 million contribution from the Dow Chemical Company and a $10 million contribution from Robert Gore and Jane Gore (the inventor of a fabric known as Gore-Tex) as matching funds toward the construction of a 40,000 square-foot research facility known as the Gore Annex to Amundson Hall.

B. Latrobe (1860) John Hazelhurst Boneval Latrobe (1803‚Äì1891) was an American lawyer and inventor. He invented the Latrobe Stove, also known as the \\"Baltimore Heater\\", a coal fired parlor heater made of cast iron and that fit into fireplaces as an insert. He patented his design in 1846. The squat stoves were very popular by the 1870s and were much smaller than Benjamin Franklin's Franklin stove. Personal life He was the son of noted engineer and architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe. John Latrobe secured an appointment to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, where he studied engineering (1818-1821). However, he ultimately decided to become a lawyer, and returned to Baltimore after his father's death to read law under the director of Robert Goodloe Harper. He married twice. His first wife, Margaret Caile Steuart (1795-1831), bore one son, Henry Boneval Latrobe (1830-1877) before her death. He remarried in Natchez, Mississippi in 1832 to Charlotte Virginia Claiborne, (1815-1903) who would survive him and also bear seven children. Career A lawyer after admission to the Maryland bar, this Latrobe initially practiced with his younger brother, Benjamin Henry Latrobe II, until the younger Latrobe decided to concentrate on civil engineering, as had their father. John H.B. Latrobe became a lawyer for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, initially arranging for land acquisitions (and publishing a work about conveyancing in 1826). He later incorporated its telegraph service, and become its chief counsel for decades. He would negotiate with the Choctaw, Chickasaw and other tribes, as well travel to Russia before the American Civil War to negotiate financing. As a patent lawyer, Latrobe was reluctant to take credit for his stoves, believing being known as an inventor of stoves would damage his legal reputation. Over 300,000 of the stoves were in use by 1878, although in recent decades, antique stoves such as the Latrobe are collected but rarely used for their original purpose, being more often used as decoration or as planters. In 1871 he delivered a lecture on the history of the steamboat which explained the contribution of Nicholas Roosevelt, who had married his elder half-sister Lydia Sellon Latrobe. Latrobe was a long-time supporter of the effort to establish a home in Africa for emancipated slaves. Succeeding Senator Henry Clay, Latrobe served as president of the American Colonization Society from 1853 until his death in 1891. He also helped found the Maryland Historical Society, of which he was president, and the American Bar Association. Simeon E. Baldwin, \\"The Founding of the American Bar Association\\", The American Bar Association Journal (January 1, 1917), p. 695. Latrobe gave a speech about history of the Mason‚ÄìDixon line to the Historical Society of Pennsylvania in 1854 which was widely reprinted, and also helped found Druid Hill Park, serving on its Board of Directors from 1860 until his death. Latrobe also achieved some distinction as a poet and painter, and was one of the 3-judge panels which awarded Edgar Allan Poe a prize for his \\"Manuscript in a bottle\\", which was published in Baltimore's Sunday Visitor paper and helped launch the writer's career. Death and legacy Latrobe died in 1891 and was buried with other family members in Green Mount Cemetery in Baltimore. Latrobe donated his family's papers, including an autobiography he wrote, to Maryland's State Archives, which continue to maintain them. A biography of him published in 1917 remains accessible through the Internet archive. His Baltimore home continues to stand across from Baltimore's Catholic Basilica, which his father had designed (and he may have helped design the facing portico). His son Ferdinand C. Latrobe (1833‚Äì1911) became a lawyer and author like his father served in the Maryland legislature and was elected Baltimore's mayor seven times.

Newman is the Democratic nominee for Illinois's 3rd congressional district in the United States House of Representatives, following her victory against incumbent Dan Lipinski in the 2020 primary election. She had lost against Lipinski in the Democratic primary for the same seat in 2018. Early life and career Newman was born in Chicago, Illinois, on April 13, 1964. She attended Carl Sandburg High School in Orland Park, Illinois. After attending Marquette University for a year and a half, she transferred to University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, where she graduated with a bachelor's degree. Newman worked for multiple firms as an agency executive. She began her own consulting firm in 2005. She also established her own nonprofit to combat bullying after one of her children was bullied. She was appointed to a regional anti-bullying task force by Governor Pat Quinn and was asked by Sears Holdings Corporation to establish a national anti-bullying coalition of 70 nonprofit organizations. Newman has worked on several Democratic campaigns for public office. Between 2015 and 2017 she lobbied for gun control measures such as background checks. U.S. House of Representatives elections=2018= Newman supported Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary in Illinois and Hillary Clinton in the November general election. The day after Clinton lost, she applied to the Illinois Women‚Äôs Institute for Leadership. By January 1, 2017, Newman had closed her business to turn her attention to politics full-time. On April 10, 2017, Newman declared her candidacy for the Illinois's 3rd congressional district, challenging Democratic incumbent Dan Lipinski, a member of the Blue Dog Coalition, who held the seat since 2005 following his father who held it for 22 years. Newman ran well to Lipinski's left, and earned endorsements from the Human Rights Campaign, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, Planned Parenthood, EMILY's List, the SEIU state council, National Nurses United, the Illinois Federation of Teachers, the Feminist Majority Foundation, NARAL Pro- Choice America, Democracy for America, MoveOn, and Our Revolution, as well as several Democratic members of Congress, including Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Representatives Luis Guti√©rrez and Jan Schakowsky, both Illinois Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Lipinski defeated Newman with 51.2% of the vote to her 48.8%. =2020= Newman ran against Lipinski again in the 2020 Democratic primary. She received endorsements from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and presidential candidates Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, and Kirsten Gillibrand, as well as Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot. The race took on special significance for progressive women‚Äôs groups after other candidates they supported lost primary races earlier in March in Texas and the principal women candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination had ended their campaigns. On March 17, 2020, Newman defeated Lipinski in the Democratic primary with 46.55% of the vote to his 45.42%. Given the district's Democratic lean, she is expected to win the general election.  Political views  Newman supports abortion rights, gun control, a $15 minimum wage, a Green New Deal and Medicare for All. Her campaigns were supported by Justice Democrats, an organization that funds progressive candidates, in both 2018 and 2020, , as well as the Sunrise Movement in 2020 .  Personal life  Newman lives in La Grange, Illinois, with her husband, Jim, and their two children. They married in 1996.

He is best known as the lead vocalist and guitarist for Dutch symphonic black metal band, Carach Angren. The stage name \\"Seregor\\" comes from Tolkien's Silmarillion. It is a combination of the word sereg which means blood, and gor which means abhorrent. Before Carach Angren, Droomers played bass and was the vocalist for Inger Indolia from 1996-2001 and was the vocalist for Vaultage from 2003-2005 with fellow Carach Angren member Clemens \\"Ardek\\" Wijers on keyboards. Carach Angren began as his and Wijers' side project while they were playing in Vaultage, because the two connected over a shared love of horror and storytelling. Later, Vaultage was disbanded as Carach Angren became increasingly successful. It is known that he grew up close to Schildveldse Bossen near where the focus of Lammendam took place. It is also known that he was primarily raised by his grandparents and is close to his grandmother who appears on the album art of This Is No Fairytale as the hand of the witch. Typically, Droomers writes Carach Angren's lyrics and stories while bandmate Clemens \\"Ardek\\" Wijers writes the composition. Droomers also builds and sells masks, including customized commissions. He is self- taught and has never had any formal artistic education, nor has he had formal musical training. When asked about his artistic background he responded, \\"just like guitar playing, extreme vocals, songwriting etc. I all sorted it out myself.\\" His masks are frequently sold to fans through his website and Facebook page and Italian band Fleshgod Apocalypse has also used costume pieces made by Droomers. He also made all the gravestones in the \\"Charles Francis Coghlan\\" music video himself out of plaster and cardboard.  Influences  Droomers claims that the paranormal has always been fascinating to him. He is also a big horror movie fan, and has cited Hellraiser and The Fly as favorites. To him, music is a release for creative story ideas and he has discussed that typically the concept comes first and the music and performance works around it. Therefore, all Carach Angren music has a horror concept with a particular focus on ghosts and spirits.

It can be used to represent the probability of a scoring opportunity that may result in a goal. Metric There is some debate about the origin of the term Expected Goals. Vic Barnett and his colleague Sarah Hilditch referred to \\"expected goals\\" in their 1993 paper that investigated the effects of artificial pitch (AP) surfaces on home team performance in association football in England. Their paper included this observation: > Quantitatively we find for the AP group about 0.15 more goals per home match > than expected and, allowing for the lower than expected goals against in > home matches, an excess goal difference (for home matches) of about 0.31 > goals per home match. Over a season this yields about 3 more goals for, an > improved goal difference of about 6 goals. Jake Ensum, Richard Pollard and Samuel Taylor (2004) reported their study of data from 37 matches in the 2002 World Cup in which 930 shots and 93 goals were recorded. Their research sought \\"to investigate and quantify 12 factors that might affect the success of a shot\\". Their logistic regression identified five factors that had a significant effect on determining the success of a kicked shot: distance from the goal; angle from the goal; whether or not the player taking the shot was at least 1 m away from the nearest defender; whether or not the shot was immediately preceded by a cross; and the number of outfield players between the shot-taker and goal. They concluded \\"the calculation of shot probabilities allows a greater depth of analysis of shooting opportunities in comparison to recording only the number of shots\\". In a subsequent paper (2004), Richard, Jake and Samuel combined data from the 1986 and 2002 World Cup competitions to identify three significant factors that determined the success of a kicked shot: distance from the goal; angle from the goal; and whether or not the player taking the shot was at least 1 m away from the nearest defender. In 2004, Alan Ryder shared a methodology for the study of the quality of an ice hockey shot at goal. His discussion started with this sentence ‚ÄúNot all shots on goal are created equal‚Äù. Alan's model for the measurement of shot quality was: > * Collect the data and analyze goal probabilities for each shooting > circumstance * Build a model of goal probabilities that relies on the > measured circumstance * For each shot, determine its goal probability * > Expected Goals: EG = the sum of the goal probabilities for each shot * > Neutralize the variation in shots on goal by calculating Normalized Expected > Goals * Shot Quality Against Alan concluded: > The model to get to expected goals given the shot quality factors is simply > based on the data. There are no meaningful assumptions made. The analytic > methods are the classics from statistics and actuarial science. The results > are therefore very credible. In 2007, Alan issued a product recall notice for his shot quality model. He presented ‚Äúa cautionary note on the calculation of shot quality‚Äù and pointed to ‚Äúdata quality problems with the measurement of the quality of a hockey team‚Äôs shots taken and allowed‚Äù. He reported: > I have been worried that there is a systemic bias in the data. Random errors > don‚Äôt concern me. They even out over large volumes of data. But I do think > that ... the scoring in certain rinks has a bias towards longer or shorter > shots, the most dominant factor in a shot quality model. And I set out to > investigate that possibility. Howard Hamilton (2009) proposed \\"a useful statistic in soccer\\" that \\"will ultimately contribute to what I call an 'expected goal value' ‚Äî for any action on the field in the course of a game, the probability that said action will create a goal\\". Sander Itjsma (2011) discussed \\"a method to assign different value to different chances created during a football match\\" and in doing so concluded: > we now have a system in place in order to estimate the overall value of the > chances created by either team during the match. Knowing how many goals a > team is expected to score from its chances is of much more value than just > knowing how many attempts to score a goal were made. Other applications of > this method of evaluation would be to distinguish a lack of quality attempts > created from a finishing problem or to evaluate defensive and goalkeeping > performances. And a third option would be to plot the balance of play during > the match in terms of the quality of chances created in order to graphically > represent how the balance of play evolved during the match. Sarah Rudd (2011) discussed probable goal scoring patterns (P(Goal)) in her use of Markov Chains for tactical analysis (including the proximity of defenders) from 123 games in the 2010-2011 English Premier League season. In a video presentation of her paper at the 2011 New England Symposium of Statistics in Sport, Sarah reported her use of analysis methods to compare \\"expected goals\\" with actual goals and her process of applying weightings to incremental actions for P(goal) outcomes. The term 'expected goals' appeared in a paper about ice hockey performance presented by Brian Macdonald at the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference in 2012. Brian's method for calculating expected goals was reported in the paper: > We used data from the last four full NHL seasons. For each team, the season > was split into two halves. Since midseason trades and injuries can have an > impact on a team‚Äôs performance, we did not use statistics from the first > half of the season to predict goals in the second half. Instead, we split > the season into odd and even games, and used statistics from odd games to > predict goals in even games. Data from 2007-08, 2008-09, and 2009-10 was > used as the training data to estimate the parameters in the model, and data > from the entire 2010-11 was set aside for validating the model. The model > was also validated using 10-fold cross-validation. Mean squared error (MSE) > of actual goals and predicted goals was our choice for measuring the > performance of our models. In April 2012, Sam Green wrote about 'expected goals' in his assessment of Premier League goalscorers. He asked \\"So how do we quantify which areas of the pitch are the most likely to result in a goal and therefore, which shots have the highest probability of resulting in a goal?\\". He added: > If we can establish this metric, we can then accurately and effectively > increase our chances of scoring and therefore winning matches. Similarly, we > can use this data from a defensive perspective to limit the better chances > by defending key areas of the pitch. Sam proposed a model to determine \\"a shot's probability of being on target and/or scored\\". With this model \\"we can look at each player's shots and tally up the probability of each of them being a goal to give an expected goal (xG) value\\".

On the play, quarterback Foles moved up to behind his offensive line and the ball was directly snapped to running back Clement. Clement went on to pitch the ball to Burton, who passed the ball to a wide open Foles to score a touchdown; Foles thereby became the first player in Super Bowl history to both throw and catch a touchdown pass. Eagles coach Doug Pederson's decision to attempt to score a touchdown rather than attempt a field goal on the play helped put the Eagles in a better position to defeat the New England Patriots, which they subsequently did, 41‚Äì33. The victory was the Eagles' first championship in 57 years. Many analysts have since called the play one of the gutsiest play-calls in Super Bowl history. It was described by NFL Films as \\"a play that the Eagles had never called before, run on 4th down by an undrafted rookie running back pitching the football to a third-string tight end who had never attempted an NFL pass before, throwing to a backup quarterback who had never caught an NFL (or college) pass before, [pulled off] on the biggest stage for football.\\"Super Bowl LII Like You Have Never Seen it Before (NFL Films, posted to YouTube on Feb 12, 2018)The \\"Philly Special\\" Stuns Belichick, Super Bowl LII (NFL Turning Point, NFL Films, posted to YouTube on Feb 7, 2018) Background A play identical to the Philly Special had been successfully run at the college level on a two-point conversion attempt in 2012 by Clemson with Andre Ellington, DeAndre Hopkins and Tajh Boyd all involved against Georgia Tech.Hopkins to Boyd 2-pt Conversion (2012 Clemson vs Ga Tech, posted to YouTube on Mar 18, 2016) In 2016, the play was run in the NFL by the Chicago Bears against the Minnesota Vikings, at U.S. Bank Stadium, the same stadium in which the Philly Special also took place.The \\"Philly Special\\" Stuns Belichick (Super Bowl LII)  Eagles vs. Patriots  NFL Turning Point (NFL Films, posted to YouTube on Feb 7, 2018) Like Clemson, the Bears' attempt, led by Matt Barkley, Jeremy Langford and Cameron Meredith, was a success as they scored a touchdown on the play. Eagles receiver Alshon Jeffery, who was a member of the Bears at the time, stated his team's wide receivers coach Mike Groh, a former Bears coach in the same position, introduced the play to Doug Pederson. Eagles offensive coordinator Frank Reich considered using it against the Vikings in the NFC Championship Game before Super Bowl LII, but relented due to the lopsided score. The Patriots also pulled off a version of the Philly Special against the Eagles in 2015. Tom Brady wandered out of the pocket and the ball was snapped to James White. White then pitched the ball to Danny Amendola who connected with Brady for a 36-yard pass. Nick Foles had played as a tight end in high school during his sophomore year. After the Super Bowl, he stated that the last time he had caught a pass for a touchdown was when he was in high school.NFL Primetime post-game interview with Nick Foles (ESPN, Feb 4, 2018, on YouTube) Trey Burton, at his high school, had been a first team all-state quarterback during his junior and senior years. During his freshman year at the University of Florida, he scored six touchdowns in a single game, breaking the team record set by Tim Tebow. Foles' experience as quarterback and tight end was at Westlake High near Austin, Texas. Sam Ehlinger, who would go on to start as quarterback at the University of Texas, also played at Westlake and ran this same play during his junior year on November 28, 2015. Soon after the Super Bowl finished, Ehlinger tweeted a video of his high school touchdown catch, saying \\"It's a Westlake thing.\\"Nick Foles' high school ran the same trick play the Eagles used in Super Bowl LII (USA Today Sports, by Steven Ruiz, February 4, 2018 8:35 pm) Super Bowl LII game action prior to the play During the second quarter, the Patriots had attempted a trick play with quarterback Tom Brady running a pattern as a receiver. The ball was thrown on target by Danny Amendola, but it slipped through Brady's hands. The drive ended after the next play with the Eagles taking possession.Patriots run perfect trick play in Super Bowl but Tom Brady gets gator arms (CBS Sports, by Will Brinson @WillBrinson, Feb 5, 2018) During Philadelphia's drive previous to their attempt at a trick play at the end of the second quarter, Nick Foles' pass was intercepted by Patriots defensive back Duron Harmon. The Patriots, led by Tom Brady, drove down the field and scored on a James White 26 yard touchdown run to cut the Eagles lead to 3. After a Kenjon Barner kick return to the 30 yard line and two plays for 7 yards, the Eagles were faced with 3rd and 3. Nick Foles was able to find Corey Clement on a wheel route for 55 yards, which set up first-and-goal, but the Eagles' drive stalled, which brought up fourth-and- goal. The play Foles lined up in the shotgun formation, but moved up to the right side of the offensive line behind right tackle Lane Johnson and yelled \\"kill, kill\\", followed by \\"Lane, Lane.\\" Foles then stayed on the right side of the offensive line and the ball was snapped to running back Corey Clement. Clement then ran left and flipped the ball to Trey Burton, to complete a reverse to the right side of the field. Finally, Burton threw the ball to Foles, who ran a route to the right corner of the end zone and made the catch for a Philadelphia touchdown. After the extra-point was successfully kicked by Jake Elliott, the Eagles went up 22‚Äì12, maintaining the score into halftime. Many designs of this play following the Super Bowl have tight end Zach Ertz blocking in a different location. Broadcasting calls Before the play was called, NBC broadcaster Cris Collinsworth expressed his shock on-air that the Eagles would go for it, as he said, \\"This is an unbelievable call ... This is like going for an onside kick. This could decide the game.\\" =Television= Al Michaels made the call with Collinsworth for NBC. Michaels' call: =Radio= Eagles broadcasters Merrill Reese and Mike Quick made the call for 94.1 WIP, the team's flagship station. Reese's call: Controversy Following the play, Patriots fans questioned if it was legal. According to the NFL Rulebook, the \\"offensive team must have at least seven players on line\\" and defines that a non-snapper player is on the line if the player's helmet \\"break[s] a vertical plane that passes through the beltline of the snapper.\\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180313103104/https://operations.nfl.com/the- rules/2017-nfl-rulebook/ However, when looking back at the play, they argued that Eagles' wide receiver Alshon Jeffery wasn't on the line of scrimmage, but rather slightly off it. Therefore, they argued, the Eagles had only six players on the line of scrimmage instead of the required seven. Fox Sports rules expert and former NFL referee Mike Pereira even said \\"...They lined up wrong ... Not only that, [but] it's a trick play. And if you're going to run a trick-type play, then you have to be lined up properly ... It's kind of one of those [penalties] that has no effect on the play. I get it. But they didn't line up properly. And it really should've been called.\\" However, before the snap, Jeffery pointed to the down judge several times, asking if he was lined up correctly and got a head nod in return each time, indicating he was properly aligned. This practice is typical at all levels of the sport for confirming proper alignment before a play. Aftermath The Eagles went on to win Super Bowl LII, 41‚Äì33. It was the team's first NFL championship since 1960, and first ever Super Bowl win. After the game, coach Doug Pederson told reporters \\"We call [the play] the Philly special ...\\" Pederson also noted that the play came from \\"... [looking] at different plays around the league and the collegiate ranks, and things that over the years that might fit what we do. We found this one that fit, and we've been working on it for the last couple of weeks and tonight was the night.\\" Two days after the game, Showtime's Inside the NFL released footage with audio between Coach Doug Pederson and Nick Foles. It showed Foles suggesting the Philly Special, saying \\"You want Philly Philly?\\", and Pederson responding, after a thoughtful pause, by saying \\"Yeah, let's do it.\\" On February 20, ESPN's Darren Rovell announced that the Philadelphia Eagles had filed for a trademark for the term \\"Philly Special.\\" If the team wins the rights, they would most likely use the term for apparel and other paraphernalia. Seven other groups, including Yuengling, also filed for the trademark. Yuengling later retracted their file for the trademark. At the NFL Owners Meetings in Orlando, Doug Pederson said that the play is being unofficially retired for at least one season due to other teams' awareness of the play. On June 14, 2018, the Eagles received their Super Bowl rings. The bezel of the ring contained 127 diamonds, which is the total from the numbers of the jerseys of the three players who handled the ball after the snap on the Philly Special‚ÄîCorey Clement (30), Trey Burton (88) and Nick Foles (9).The Making of the Super Bowl LII Championship Ring (Philadelphia Eagles, posted to YouTube on Jun 15, 2018) In September 2018, a statue commemorating the Philly Special, showing the moment of discussion between Nick Foles and Doug Pederson, was unveiled at Lincoln Financial Field. On September 6, 2018, during the first game of the 2018 season, the Eagles ran a similar trick play against the Atlanta Falcons successfully, gaining a first down. Despite the Philly Special being occasionally called \\"Philly Philly\\" due to the conversation Foles and Pederson had regarding calling that play, Pederson indicated the play in the Falcons‚ÄìEagles game is called \\"Philly Philly.\\" On September 20, 2018, the Cleveland Browns ran the play successfully for a two- point conversion against the New York Jets. RB Duke Johnson took the snap and handed the ball off to WR Jarvis Landry, who threw a pass to QB Baker Mayfield. As Landry is left-handed, the play was run to the left side of the field, rather than the right side. This play has earned nicknames \\"Baker Special\\" after Mayfield, \\"Cleveland Special,\\" and the \\"Dilly Special\\"The Dilly Special in reference to Bud Light's \\"Dilly Dilly\\" ad campaign. This play tied the game that the Browns went on to win, ending a 19-game winless streak. Bud Light placed \\"victory fridges\\" in several Cleveland-area taverns that unlocked upon the Browns winning. On December 2, 2018, the Chicago Bears successfully ran the play for a touchdown against the New York Giants as time expired in the fourth quarter to tie the game and force overtime. However, the Giants would go on to win the game in overtime. Trey Burton, who signed with the Bears during the 2018 offseason, also contributed to the play. Steve Spurrier called the \\"Orlando Special\\" during the inaugural game of the Alliance of American Football; it was a success, propelling the Orlando Apollos to a 40‚Äì6 win over the Atlanta Legends. On September 21, 2019, the Pittsburgh Panthers college football team called the \\"Pitt Special\\" during a matchup against the then-unbeaten UCF Knights, leading the Panthers to a 35‚Äì34 victory over the Knights.

History The Museum of Geometric and MADI Art was founded in 2002 by Bill and Dorothy Masterson, art enthusiasts who developed an interest in Mad√≠ art and began collecting works in the style. The Mastersons opened a permanent museum featuring Mad√≠ art in their firm, Kilgore & Kilgore's, new building at 3109 Carlisle in Dallas. The building was subsequently renovated in the Mad√≠ style. This renovation, which Bill Masterson commissioned Uruguayan Mad√≠ artist Volf Roitman to design, transformed \\"the architecturally uninteresting Kilgore Law Center building into a giant example of cut-out MADI art\\", according to Tampa Bay Times journalist Barbara L. Fredricksen. In 2005, Roitman, then age 74, was serving as the creative director of the museum. Programs and exhibitions  Interior of the Museum of Geometric and MADI Art The Museum of Geometric and MADI Art offers the Arcadia Salon discussion series featuring artists and art experts; the name derives from the Arcadia that once stood on Greenville Avenue in Dallas, the sign from which presently adorns the museum exterior. The museum also provides creative workshops for both students and seniors as well as docent-led tours that are available upon request. It hosts an annual benefit known as the Geometric Gala, which includes a silent auction of artwork by both local artists and those of global renown. The museum features art from around the world in its permanent collection, and it has also hosted exhibitions by artists such as Yaacov Agam and Orna Feinstein. Furthermore, Roitman's Mad√≠ Art Wall, which had previously been displayed at the museum in Dallas, was installed on the Wood Building in Marshall, Texas, in November 2009.

These risk factors include negative social life events, conflict, and low levels of social support, all of which have been found affect the likelihood of someone experiencing major depression, the length of the depression, or the severity of the symptoms.  Negative social life events  Negative social life events have been found to greatly increase one's risk of depression and clinicians are often quick to check if any major life events have preceded their patient's symptoms. This relationship is largely thought to be causal, with the strongest evidence of causation coming from findings that negative events outside of one's control are strongly associated with depression, making it unlikely that depression symptoms had anything to do with the negative event. Additional support comes from twin studies, which allow for researchers to control for endogenous factors that may be related to its onset. However, noncausal associations are also likely as individuals who are more likely to be depressed may increase their chance of experiencing a negative social event due to placing themselves into relationships where these events may be more common. Evidence for the association between negative life events and depression comes largely from case studies and studies that compare the frequency of these events in depressed individuals to rates in people who are representative of the larger population. Negative life events are often reported by the depressed, with up to 80% of cases of major depression are preceded by some major life event, and symptoms tend to occur within one month of the event if a diagnosis of major depression is made. This high frequency of negative events is also seen relative to representative samples of the non- depressed population, with studies often showing the depressed to have experienced twice as much of these negative experiences. In addition to this, depressed individuals are more likely to have experienced negative life events preceding their symptoms compared to other mental health issues like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Although negative social experiences are often reported as preceding depression, most people do not get diagnosed with major depression. Part of this stems from the fact that grieving or sadness behavior is often seen as normal and healthy and not worthy of a diagnosis indicating pathology. However, one's history with major depression, levels of social support, gender, sex, and personality differences have all been suggested to play roles in mediating one's sensitivity to pathological depression. = Dependent versus independent events = The negative life events that lead to depression are often classified as dependent or independent, with dependent events being those an individual has some control over and independent events being those which are mostly due to unavoidable chance. Dependent events typically involve most stressors that result from interactions with people in addition to variables like performance-based job security and avoidable financial problems. They are more strongly associated with depression than independent events when controlling for severity and may be the result of traits that lead individuals into situations that are more likely to result in depression. In addition to this, they are likely to be more directly related to interpersonal content, at least immediately following when the stressor is felt. Dependent events are also thought to be more strongly associated with major depression symptoms in people who have a history of it than those experiencing it for the first time. However, the validity of this statement may be dependent on whether one is focusing on relapse or recurrence, with the evidence from recurrent major depression being more supportive. Although independent events are less associated with depression and social content, they are still positively associated with depression. In addition to this, they have helped contribute evidence for the causal relationship between negative life events and depression, as with dependent events there is always the question of whether depression symptoms played a role in their occurrence. = Episodic events and chronic stress = Like other types of negative life events, the social experiences that lead to higher probabilities of developing major depression, can either be one-time events or repeated. Episodic events are those with clear beginnings and endings, which usually involve a specific time frame. However, it is often hard to distinguish episodic stressors from chronic stressors as the length of many stressors is expected to vary based on individual, environmental, and cultural factors. However, the loss of a loved one can usually be considered a short-term discrete event, and such instances are estimated to result in depression 17-31% of the time. Other examples of episodic stressors include an unexpected loss of employment, robbery, and assault, all of which are known to increase the likelihood for depression. In addition to differences in the length of stressful events, researchers have also emphasized that different types of events may relate to differences in how stress is experienced. For example, episodic events like romantic breakups, economic hardship, or assault can result in long periods of chronic stress. This may be due to the likelihood that these events are often caused ongoing problems or the result in them, where a quick fix is often not possible. Although it is less often mentioned in case studies, a lack of social support has also been implicated as a form of chronic stress that increases the likelihood of major depression. Like with the previously mentioned example of romantic breakups, a lack of social support may become a form of chronic stress as it is often something that cannot be fixed quickly and may be a source of conflict. Both negative life events and chronic stress have each been shown to contribute to the onset of depression, and the two may combine to increase one's risk of depression. For example, acute and chronic stressors were found to increase the likelihood of depression to similar degrees in both men and women in a Spanish sample that compared a depressed group to controls. In addition to their direct effect on depression, both stressors have been suggested to interact, with either chronic stress making individuals more susceptible to the effects of episodic events or by negative life events adding to levels of chronic stress. = Sex and gender differences in sensitivity to social loss = Major depression is about twice as common in women than in men. One often explored explanation for this is that women experience more negative social events than men; however, there is little evidence for this when looking at the relationship between negative events and depression as a whole. That being said, much variability exists when looking negative event type and risk of depression, particularly if they involve a social component. In general, women are at much higher risk of developing depression after a social loss than men. One explanation for this is that women tend to have larger networks of meaningful supporters than men where an important loss can happen. Evidence for this comes primarily from the finding that both sexes are equally likely to become depressed in response to conflict or death within the nuclear family, while women are more likely to become depressed in response to the loss of a friend and family members outside of the nuclear family. In addition to this, women may also be more sensitive to depression when conflict exists and is physically expressed as evidenced by women being more likely to be depressed after a physical attack but not men Another potential explanation is that women experience greater strain than men and have fewer ways to manage or lessen their difficulties. However, there is currently little direct evidence for this. Although women are typically found to be more sensitive to social loss outside of the nuclear family as a risk factor for depression, supportive social networks have also been shown to be more protective against depression in women. For this reason, Kendler and colleagues suggest that differences in sensitivity to social stressors alone cannot explain the sex difference in depression on its own since the larger social networks of women likely reduce their risk of depression.  Depression's role in negative life events  In addition to negative life events leading to depression, researchers have suggested that depression may also worsen one's social environment, which can further elevate the symptoms of major depression and one's risk of experiencing negative events. This connection between depression and social stressors is best seen through depressed individuals being more likely to experience more negative social events during their depression than non- depressed individuals or those with other conditions. In particular, depressed individuals are more likely to experience social rejection. However, it is unclear what effect increased rejection has on one's experience with depression. = Negative feedback and reassurance seeking = Of the ways depression might lead to increased social stressors, negative feedback seeking and reassurance seeking are two of the most explored. Both behaviors involve questioning social partners about oneself in ways that are aversive to others, differing in whether the feedback sought is positive or negative Evidence compatible with reassurance seeking and negative feedback seeking increasing social stress and depression symptoms comes from the frequency of these behaviors among the depressed and the responses of others that often accompany these actions. For example, depressed individuals have been found to engage more in both behaviors than non-depressed individuals and may fail to benefit from positive feedback when it is available. Reactions to negative feedback and reassurance seeking often include increased likelihood of rejection and contribute to low self-esteem levels, potentially prolonging or increasing both one's depression symptoms and the degree to which the depressed engages in feedback seeking. Therefore, although the negativity of these social impacts may be minor relative to what triggered depression, their effects may be significant once symptoms are present. In terms of directly connection these behaviors to depression, reassurance seeking style has been reported to be associated with depression symptoms among those experiencing it.  Conflict  In addition to the loss of a relationship with a loved one, conflict has also been suggested as another way social factors can bring about depression. Divorce, separation, and the threat of either often result in both conflict and depression, and serious marital problems and divorce are two of the strongest predictors of depression. Conflict with other family members is also predictive of depression, although not to the extent of marital problems. Although less studied, conflict outside of the family is also associated with depression. This is seen among the Tsiman√©, who are more likely to be depressed if they are currently in conflict with anyone, especially if that person is outside of their family. The relationship between conflict and depression is also seen through assault. This is seen primarily in the short- term, with assault often being the event with the highest likelihood of being correlated with depression after the fact. However, long-term affects are also seen, in that childhood assaults (both sexual and physical) are correlated with greater likelihoods of depression later in life.  Social support levels  Social support levels have a strong inverse relationship with one's risk of becoming depressed despite the challenges that come with measuring them. This effect is most strongly felt in women, who tend to have larger support networks and are more likely to become depressed in response to conflict or loss in relationships outside the nuclear family. Depressed individuals tend to have lower levels of both perceived and actual support and may express this to others in ways that may exacerbate one's symptoms and put more strain on one's social relationships. Time spent in major depressive episodes is also negatively correlated with social support, but it is unclear whether longer bouts of depression lessen perceived or actual support or if social support helped the depressed return to normal faster. However, the degree to which the relationship between social support and depression is casual is still uncertain. Questions about causality often come from the possibility that social support levels may be tied to other traits that also play a role in depression. For example, in addition to depression tending to produce negative reactions from others after the fact people with low social support may simply be less interested or less skilled in developing social networks which may help buffer against negative life events. Therefore, a trait that lessons the extent of one's social network may also result in more social adversity or negatively impact one's risk of depression in other, indirect ways. In addition to low levels of support being a risk factor for depression, high levels are also widely considered to have protective effects. However, these results are not universal and often come from studies limited to self-reports from the depressed. In today's culture of social networks being tied to social media and with the high numbers of social media users, studies have been conducted recently to determine if there is a relationship between social media use and depression. This topic of research in regard to college students is of significant interest due to the high rates of depression reported in this group. For example, in the American College Health Association's National College Health Assessment for Spring 2019, 46.2% of American undergraduate college students reported feeling \\"so depressed that it was difficult to function\\" at any time in the past 12 months. Studies published in the journals Social Science & Medicine in 2017 and Computers in Human Behavior in 2018 have found that problematic or addictive social media use is strongly associated with depression or depressive symptoms. Meanwhile, a study from 2018 in the Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology found that university students who limited time spent on social media for an extended period of time had decreased levels of depression. Another study published in 2018 in the Journal of American College Health found that having close, real-life relationships with social media contacts \\"was significantly associated with decreased odds of depressive symptoms\\".  Depression and the family  The family is a potential source of both important social support and conflict, both of which are associated with differences in the likelihood of depression. = Risk factors within the family = Multiple risk factors for adolescent depression have been identified within the family. Among the strongest is the degree to which conflict is present within a family, with more conflict being associated with greater risk of depression. In addition to this, parental responses to sadness or discontent are also tied to the likelihood of major depression, with both increased aggression and suppressed aggression towards dysphoric children being associated with greater likelihoods of adolescent depression. Although conflict and social support are often viewed as opposites, it is likely that both are the result of different mechanisms so that high levels of conflict do not necessarily have the same impact as low levels of social support. This is seen in that although low parental support is predictive of depression within the family, high social support from one parent may not be enough to provide protective effects in response to conflict with the other. = Familial reactions towards the depressed = As with the depressed in general, responses to depressed family members are often aversive. This is seen in that parents of the depressed tend to provide less support and neglect their children more than parents of non-depressed individuals. However, depression has also been found to reduce the chance that a parent will act aggressively towards their child, an outcome that is compatible with evolutionary approaches emphasizing depression's role as a potential signal of need or a bargaining strategy.  Heritability of social predictors of depression  Major depression is estimated to have a moderate heritability of 31-42%, with women having higher estimates than men. One common explanation for why depression risk varies in response to genetic differences is that personality traits, especially neuroticism, lead to differences in how individuals respond to major life events due to mediators like rumination. In other words, certain individuals are likely to have lower thresholds for developing major depression due to how they experience different types of adversity, although even those at low risk of depression may experience depression in response to a negative event. Another source for the heritability of depression likely comes through the heritability of the social stressors commonly associated with depression. This is true of both independent events and dependent events, with a review by Kendler and Baker (2007) showing heritabilites ranging from 7-39% for many social causes of the adversity associated with depression. When looking at major life events in general, this grows to 20-50% depending on the study and the outcome being examined. Many examples for of the negative life events often associated with depression being heritable come from within the family and romantic relationships. Within the family, cohesion, organization, expressiveness, activity, control, and conflict are all heritable, with estimates ranging from 18-30% depending on the variable. Divorce, which may be particularly likely to result in depression, is moderately heritable with about 35% of differences in one's susceptibility to divorce stemming from genetic differences. Negative social life events outside of the family are also heritable. This is seen in assault (including rape and mugging), troubles getting along with others in social networks, and job loss all being heritable. This connection between depression and heritable negative life events has led to the suggestion that part of the heritability of depression stems from greater risk of experiencing environments more likely to lead to its occurrence. However, it is unlikely to be a complete explanation for the heritability of depression, with one estimate being that the heritability of negative life events account 10-15% of the total heritability of depression. Likewise, the effect of genetic polymoprhisms on negative life effents alone is relatively small compared to environmental differences.  Heritability of protective factors for depression  Like risk factors for depression, protective factors have also been shown to be heritable. This is seen in both satisfaction with social relationships and the size of supportive networks, with heritability estimates from 17-31% depending on the measure and the population. For example, both family and school connectedness are heritable and unable to be fully accounted for by differences in experience alone. They are also linked to depression, which is negatively correlated with support levels in a longitudinal U.S. sample. This link between depression and a lack of social support and the heritability of aspects of social networks has led to the suggestion that part of depression's heritability likely stems from heritable differences in one's ability to form supportive social networks. As with predictors of depression, differences in the protective factors associated with social network size and satisfaction may be tied to differences in personality. In particular, differences in one's degree of extraversion are often highlighted as one potential mediator, as extraverts are likely to have larger social networks. In line with this reasoning, extraverts are more likely to experience positive life events, especially those that are dependent on one's behavior. However, it is unclear whether positive life events are protective against depression.  DSM-5 and the removal of the bereavement exclusion  Social factors are also relevant when it comes to diagnosing depression. An exclusion for the diagnosis of depression due to bereavement was originally observed at the back of the DSM-III, noting that because \\"a full depressive syndrome frequently is a normal reaction to the death of a loved one\\", the patient's condition was better understood as Uncomplicated Beareavement. This exclusion became part of the diagnostic criteria in the DSM-III-R and DSM-IV, where individuals experiencing depression symptoms were not considered depressed if the symptoms were in response to the death of a loved one and ended within two months. However, this bereavement exclusion was removed under DSM V, allowing a depression diagnosis to be made under these conditions. Those in favor of this change argue that while grief related to the loss of a loved one and major depression share many overlapping symptoms, they are not the same thing and that, therefore, bereavement should not prevent a depression diagnosis. Although depression could still be diagnosed with the bereavement clause in place if the individual was suicidal, psychotic, or had trouble with day to day tasks, proponents of its removal argue that underdiagnosis of depression was still a risk due to certain severe symptoms not meeting the criteria (e.g., insomnia, rapid weight loss, or trouble concentrating) and the concern that individuals may hide certain symptoms due to fears of being institutionalized. The major risk of underdiagnosis due to the bereavement clause is that it would prevent individuals from getting the treatment they could receive with a diagnosis. This is exacerbated by the fact that depression is a risk factor for suicide, thereby creating situations where treatment may be lifesaving. For this reason, proponents of the exclusion's removal argue that the judgement of clinicians needs to be unconstrained by whether or not an individual has lost a loved one and that this would be sufficient in preventing its overdiagnosis. A study by Wakefield (2007) compared depression patients whose diagnosis was triggered by death of a loved one and those whose diagnosis was triggered by a different kind of loss. The study found no major symptomatic difference between the two groups, suggesting the death of a loved one should not be treated differently than other losses. Critics of the change emphasize that the depressive symptoms seen during bereavement are often normal and that the inclusion of the bereavement exclusion was important to prevent overdiagnosis. Like the proponents of removing the exclusion, they emphasize that grieving individuals often experience symptoms used to diagnose major depression; however, they argue that these symptoms can often be resolved without treatment and often fail to become the chronic or recurrent symptoms that should define major depression. Instead of removing the bereavement exclusion, Wakefield and First (2012) favor the use of provisional qualifiers and the use of patient history to balance the risks of over- and under-diagnosis. They argue that by classifying someone as provisionally normal before the two-month cut-off of the bereavement clause and in the absence of dangers like suicidal behavior, a clinician can avoid the costs of a false-positive diagnosis while still monitoring their patient closely for signs of pathological depression as opposed to normal grief. To avoid the risk of false-negatives, those with a history of major depression could be diagnosed without this provisional tag due to a previous history of depression being a strong predictor for the onset of future episodes.

A sequel to the 2007 film The 3 L'il Pigs (Les 3 p'tits cochons), the film revisits the brothers five years after the death of their mother, older and slightly wiser but still struggling with the demands of monogamy in their marriages. However, Claude Legault did not reprise the role of Mathieu, who was instead played in the sequel by Patrice Robitaille. R√©mi (Paul Doucet) is dealing with both the fallout of cheating on his wife Dominique (Sophie Pr√©gent) with another woman on a business trip, and his unresolved bisexuality after experiencing a strong attraction to a young man who helps him after a fainting spell in the street. Christian (Guillaume Lemay-Thivierge), whose girlfriend H√©l√®ne has left him, moves into R√©mi and Dominique's house after R√©my leaves, but begins falling in love with Dominique. Mathieu (Robitaille) falls off the roof of his house and is recuperating in a body cast, but finds himself more sexually excited by the nurse who comes in to take care of him than he is by his wife Genevi√®ve (Isabel Richer).

The complex was then remodeled in the 17th-century, though the cloister remained unchanged. During the 17th-century, the monastery fell into disuse and ownership was transferred out of the Church and into private hands. It was then annexed by the nearby Villa dei Ricasoli. At the entrance of the building is a portico of three arches supported by columns built by Matteo Nigetti in 1633. Inside is a large fresco by Luigi Sabatelli depicting Saint Jerome (), after which the monastery is named. The main altar was also designed by Nigetti in 1661, where there is a canvas by Giovanni Domenico Cerrini depicting the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. In the floor are two headstones, one a porphyry medallion of Francesco del Tadda, and the other of the Rucellai family, dating to 1478. In 1911, Charles Augustus Strong visited Villa San Girolamo and briefly stayed there. He was so impressed by its views of Florence that he decided to build Villa Le Balze directly beneath it. From 1889 until around 2005, the villa was run by nuns of the Little Company of Mary, who originally used the villa as a nursing home and later to provide room and board to pilgrims, visitors, and students for a small fee. The use of the villa as an inn by the nuns was shut down by the mayor of Fiesole in 1998, who said that the nuns were using it as an unauthorized hotel. Michael Ondaatje's 1992 novel, The English Patient was set in Villa San Girolamo. For some time, the villa was used as a springtime vacation home by historian John Lorne Campbell and his wife Margaret Fay Shaw, and was where Campbell died.

It is the 26th overall episode of the series and is written by consulting producer Prentice Penny and directed by Eric Appel. It aired on Fox in the United States on October 19, 2014. The show revolves around the fictitious 99th precinct of the New York Police Department in Brooklyn and the officers and detectives that work in the precinct. Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) is an immature yet very talented detective in the precinct with an astounding record of crimes solved, putting him in a competition with fellow detective Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero). The precinct's status changes when the Captain is retiring and a new commanding officer, Cpt. Raymond Holt (Andre Braugher) is appointed as the newest Captain. This creates a conflict between Jake and Holt over their respective methods in the field. In the episode, Jake and Holt continue with their annual Halloween contests. This time, Jake has until midnight to steal Holt's watch or he will do five weeks of overtime for free. Jake, with help from the precinct, manages to get the watch from a criminal. However, the criminal runs away with the watch and upon learning of the importance of the watch, Jake sets to find him. Meanwhile, Gina begins to skip duties unexpectedly. The episode was seen by an estimated 5.22 million household viewers and gained a 2.5/7 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49, according to Nielsen Media Research. The episode received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics, who praised the writing but felt that the episode's gimmick was out of place for the show. Plot After his victory the year prior, Jake proposes to continue the bet with Holt. This time, the task is that Jake needs to steal Holt's watch from his wrist before midnight. If Jake wins, Holt will do Jake's paperwork for one week, but if Jake loses, Jake will do five weeks of overtime without pay. Getting help from the precinct, Jake brings in a pickpocket to help him steal the watch. It proves successful and the criminal gets on to steal the watch. However, problems arise when the criminal runs away with the watch and Jake learns from Holt that the watch belonged to his husband Kevin's father before he died. He and Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio) meet with the criminal and gives him his money and shoes in exchange for knowing the location of the watch but are told the watch was already in his car. When they go to retrieve it, they find that the car has been towed. Meanwhile, Amy (Melissa Fumero) and Rosa (Stephanie Beatriz) are upset when Terry (Terry Crews) doesn't punish Gina (Chelsea Peretti) for skipping out on her duties at the precinct to attend dance practice. It is revealed that Gina has been secretly going back to college which has caused her to miss dance rehearsals. While passing through a crowd of party-goers, Jake manages to get on a party bus to get to the impound lot but loses track of Boyle. When he arrives to impound, he finds he lost his badge and his ID and can't claim his car. He tries to sneak through the fence but is arrested by guards. In the interrogation room, he is told by Holt that he orchestrated everything for a year, that he annoyed Jake into wanting to steal his watch, and that the watch never left his person to begin with. The criminal was already on Holt's payroll, and Holt had organized everyone to go against Jake as everyone wants him humiliated. However, Boyle was taken before he boarded the party bus because he might have told Jake the plan. In the end, Captain Holt and the group celebrates Holt's victory at the bar and Jake is forced to admit that Captain Holt \\"is an amazing police captain/genius\\" in addition to the five weeks of unpaid overtime. Reception=Viewers= In its original American broadcast, \\"Halloween II\\" was seen by an estimated 5.22 million household viewers and gained a 2.5/7 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49, according to Nielsen Media Research. This was a 15% increase in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 4.51 million viewers with a 2.2/6 in the 18-49 demographics. This means that 2.5 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 7 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it. With these ratings, Brooklyn Nine-Nine was the second most watched show on FOX for the night, beating Mulaney and Family Guy but behind The Simpsons, fifth on its timeslot and fifth for the night, behind Once Upon a Time, The Simpsons, The OT, and NBC Sunday Night Football. =Critical reviews= \\"Halloween II\\" received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics. LaToya Ferguson of The A.V. Club gave the episode an \\"C+\\" grade and wrote, \\"The problem with Brooklyn Nine-Nine is that the 'bad' episodes are still at least decently humorous episodes of television. That's sort of a nonsense problem, but it still exists. Lesser episodes of the show may feature a lack of cohesion, but the audience can always rest assured that there will be an endless supply of quotable jokes. Now there's nothing wrong with being a joke factory, but that's not exactly what Brooklyn Nine-Nine is selling, and this episode is the perfect example that Brooklyn Nine-Nine can't simply rest on those joke laurels.\\" Jackson McHenry of Entertainment Weekly wrote, \\"Sequels are like caricatures. In trying to replicate the original, they tend to exaggerate its basic elements to the point of ridiculousness. Minor things become overused: A funny side character turns into a main character, a cute gag inflates into the whole plot. This can be great ‚Äî I'll defend Shrek 2 over the original any day ‚Äî but the result usually ends up feeling a little thin. This week's Brooklyn Nine-Nine attempted to cap off last year's excellent 'Halloween' with a cheeky follow-up, but, with the same plots, and nearly the same conclusion, 'Halloween II' emphasized the show's weaknesses.\\" Allie Pape from Vulture gave the show a 4 star rating out of 5 and wrote, \\"I've already come out strongly in favor of Brooklyn Nine-Nines all-cast-antics episodes, particularly when it comes to reprising one of my favorites, last year's Halloween team-up to steal Holt's Medal of Valor. This year, the quarry was his watch, a gift from Kevin Cozner's dying father (but please don't call it the 'death watch'). And even though I could see two of the twists coming from a mile away ‚Äî Holt winning this year because Peralta beating him twice would throw off the balance of power between the two, and Fingers the thief stealing the watch once he got a chance because duh ‚Äî I still enjoyed watching it all go down.\\" Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote, \\"Another solid outing in a season that's been clicking very well so far. And I like the idea of Halloween bets being a tradition on this show like Ron & Tammy or Bar Wars episodes on some other fine comedies.\\" Andy Crump of Paste gave the episode a 6.7 and wrote, \\"The good news here is that Brooklyn Nine-Nine doesn't seem to be losing its spirit. It will forever remain a tribute to farce, with an endless supply of zany vim. It does, however, appear to be losing its direction, which may be a bit of an alarmist observation, given that we're only four episodes deep into Season Two. But 'Halloween II' gets too wrapped up in its central caper to deliver on its best attribute ‚Äî its character work. Without that, Brooklyn Nine-Nine is just another sitcom to breeze through, rather than savor.\\" See also *Halloween (Brooklyn Nine-Nine) *Halloween III (Brooklyn Nine-Nine) *Halloween IV (Brooklyn Nine-Nine) ReferencesExternal links 2014 American television episodes Brooklyn Nine-Nine (season 2) episodes Halloween television episodes ","title":"Halloween II (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)"},{"id":"56519551","text":"C High School Jagdishpur is a school in Siwan, Bihar, India.

The locomotive is designed by GE Transportation and is based on its Evolution Series, which are used in North America. The class is meant for freight hauling and replaces the older American Locomotive Company (ALCO)-designed locomotives, which have been the mainstay diesels of Indian Railways since 1962. Equipped with a 12-cylinder fully turbocharged GEVO engine, it is claimed to be 50% more environmentally friendly than its predecessors and is the first in the country to be compliant with level one of the emission norms set by the International Union of Railways (UIC-1). The locomotive has two cabs for easy reversal, both of which are air conditioned and crash-worthy to sustain frontal collisions. The locomotive is part of a 13-year contract between Indian Railways and GE Transportation under which 700 such locomotives will be produced indigenously. Diesel Locomotive Factory in Marhowra, Bihar was set up by GE for the production and supply of these locomotives which is also seen as a boost to the Make in India initiative. The maintenance of the locomotive will be GE's responsibility which will also have to ensure that 95% of the fleet is ready at all times. For this, real time remote tracking and fault diagnostics has been implemented in the locomotive. Development The development of the locomotive can be traced back to a global tender floated by the Ministry of Railways for the establishment of two different locomotive factories in Bihar. The tender also required that over 1,800 freight locomotives be supplied to Indian Railways. By September 2013, bids were received from six global firms: Siemens, Alstom, Bombardier, General Electric, CSR Corp and CNR Corp. However, Indian Railways rejected the bid of both Chinese firms (CSR and CNR) for the two giant manufacturing projects in Bihar. In January 2014, Cabinet approval was received for setting up the Diesel Locomotive Factory (DLF) in Marhowra at an approximate cost of respectively. On 9 November 2015, the Ministry of Railways awarded the contracts for Madhepura and Marhowra projects to Alstom and General Electric Transportation respectively in a collective amount of US$6 billion. This multi-crore rupees deal was seen as the country's first foreign direct investment (FDI) in the railway sector. The design for the locomotive was finalised by the Indian branch of GE Global Research in Bangalore. Under the contract, GE is stated to supply 700 of 4,500 HP locomotives and 300 of 6,000 HP locomotives. Both the locomotives are based on GE's Evolution-series locomotives, which are claimed to be one of the most fuel efficient and least polluting diesel locomotives in the world. Production The first 50 locomotives of the class were built at GE Transportation's manufacturing plant in Erie, Pennsylvania and were shipped to India while the remaining 950 (including 300 WDG-6G class) are being locally manufactured with 70% local parts under the Make in India initiative. The locomotives will be built and assembled at the Diesel Locomotive Factory, Marhowra in Bihar which is a joint venture between Indian Railways and General Electric with the former owning a 26% stake and the latter owning the remaining 74%. The first locomotive rolled out of GE's Erie plant on 3 August 2017 with an orange and yellow livery that required of paint. The first shipment arrived in India on 11 October 2017 and the import order was completed on 23 November 2018 with the 50th locomotive's arrival at Mundra Port, Gujarat. An average of 100 locomotives will be produced per year for 10 years starting from 2019. GE would be responsible for the fleet's maintenance during the first thirteen years of the contract, after which Indian Railways would be handed over the responsibility.  Specifications = Traction = The prime-mover is a GE Evolution Series 12 cylinder turbocharged internal combustion diesel engine which produces 4,500 horsepower and transmits 4,261 HP to the wheels through six traction motors, one on each axle (Co'Co' configuration). Each axle's traction motor can be individually controlled to maintain maximum torque and tractive effort, up to 554 kN, even during conditions that induce wheel-slip. The tier-1 GEVO (evolution series) engine is claimed to have 50% lower emission than previous locomotives in IR and is the first in its fleet to comply with UIC-1 emission standards. The motors are driven by IGBT (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor) technology which allows for higher power gain and efficiency than the previous generation Gate turn-off thyristors. The locomotive has a reduced fuel consumption than its predecessors due to an electronic fuel-injection system installed on it. The locomotive has a top speed of and weighs . The fuel tank has a capacity of out of which is usable during normal operations. The locomotive is capable of multiple unit operations which allows more load to be transported by attaching two or more locomotives controlled by the same crew. Roza shed based WDG-4G 49100 standing at Katihar = Safety = A crash hardened event recorder/data logger has been provided on every such locomotive along with a vigilance control unit. The brakes are microprocessor controlled railway air brakes along with dynamic brakes which can produce a combined maximum braking effort of 270 kN. A self load feature allows the locomotive to gauge its performance while the cell modem would enable real time remote monitoring of the locomotive's performance and health. The cab is strengthened to comply with cab frontal collision as per RDSO specifications (EN12663) and equipped with fire-fighting equipment for crew safety. Additionally, the cabs, control units and their compartments are made using fire retardant material. = Crew amenities = Unlike older locomotives of Indian Railways, the WDG-4G has various facilities for crew comfort and utilities, including temperature control and heated windshields. Each locomotive comes fitted with a water closet for crew comfort, a feature which has been largely missing on most Indian locomotives. A hot plate is also provided for heating meals while on the run. Additional features such as soundproofing of the driver cabs and charging sockets for cellphones have reportedly made the locomotive popular among loco-pilots, who have many times raised concerns about the generally poor working conditions within Indian Railways.  Operation  The locomotive class operates out of two sheds (maintenance depots), each controlled by Wabtec (which acquired GE Transportation in 2018). One of the shed is in Ghandhidham, Gujarat under Western Railway zone while the other one is in Roza, Uttar Pradesh under Northern Railway Zone where a total of 209 locomotives have entered service. GE has said that, during operations, real time tracking will be undertaken for the locomotives to 'increase productivity and minimize time duration'. As part of its contract on the maintenance and upkeep of the locomotives, Wabtec has to keep 95% of the fleet in operational condition, failure of which would result in a penalty from Indian Railways. The locomotives are to take over the freight hauling duties from older locomotives in Indian Railways' fleet, mainly ALCO and EMD locos. The former was the last major import shipment for IR which was in 1962 when IR acquired the WDM-2 series of locomotives. The axle load of the locomotive has been kept at a minimal 22 tonnes per axle to allow operations all over the Indian Railway network which has a lower axle load limit.

They are outstanding examples of Renaissance metalwork, described by John Hayward as \\"the most impressive single monument of Italian and perhaps European goldsmith's work of the 16th century\\",\\"The Aldobrandini Tazzas\\", John Hayward, The Burlington Magazine, Vol. 112, No. 811 (Oct., 1970), pp. 669-676, Published by: The Burlington Magazine Publications Ltd., Article Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/876472 and by the Victoria and Albert Museum as \\"one of the most spectacular groups of 16th century silver to survive\\".Aldobrandini Tazza, Victoria and Albert Museum Each tazza comprises a shallow bowl mounted on a high foot and stem. A vertical pedestal rises from the centre of the bowl, topped by a standing figurine of one of the first Roman emperors whose lives are described in The Twelve Caesars by the Roman author Suetonius. The inside surface of each bowl is chased with four scenes from Suetonius's life of the relevant emperor. The tazze have a complicated and somewhat uncertain history and provenance. At one time they were attributed to Benvenuto Cellini, but that attribution is no longer considered correct. Later it was considered that they may have been made by artists from the Netherlands, or possibly from Augsburg or Nuremberg in Germany, perhaps working in Italy. More recent scholarship by Julia Siemon indicates they were made in the southern Netherlands, possibly for a Habsburg patron, perhaps Archduke Albert VII of Austria, towards the end of the 16th century, and then acquired by a member of the Aldobrandini family before 1603. Different bowls have slightly different styles, suggesting that a team of silversmiths was involved. The set was originally owned by the Aldobrandini family and their descendants until at least 1769, and remained together in a single collection until at least 1861. The vessels were originally plain \\"white\\" silver, but were gilded in the decade after 1861. The group was then dispersed and examples are now held by several different museums and private collectors. In the late 19th century, six of the original bases, with restrained classically- inspired fluting on the foot and stem, were replaced with more flamboyantly decorated 16th century bases, possibly of Spanish origin. Over time, the interchangeable parts of several tazze, most noticeably the bowls and figurines, have been mixed, so a bowl showing scenes from the life of one emperor may now be found in a collection with the figurine of a different emperor. The 12 tazze were reunited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City in 2014, at the start of a major research project. This endeavor resulted in an exhibition organized by Siemon, The Silver Caesars: A Renaissance Mystery, which was accompanied by a volume of essays by the same title. During the exhibition, which was on view from 12 December 2017 until March 11th, 2018. The exhibition then traveled to Waddesdon Manor in England in 2018, where it was on view from 18 April until 22 July.The Silver Caesars: A Renaissance Mystery, Waddesdon Manor, 18 April - 22 July 2018Waddesdon Manor to host Renaissance treasures exhibition, BBC News, 31 December 2017 Videos exploring how the Nero tazza and Vitellius tazza depict their Suetonian content were created by Siemon and Beard for display in the exhibition, and can be viewed on the Metropolitan Museum's YouTube channel. During the exhibition, the tazze were displayed in public for the first time since the mid-19th century.The Silver Caesars: A Renaissance Mystery, Metropolitan Museum of Art, December 12, 2017 - March 11, 2018The Silver Caesars, Apollo Magazine Description Each tazza is a bowl or cup, approximately high. The form is based on the kylix, a broad shallow wine-drinking cup from Ancient Greece, also the source of the word \\"chalice\\". Some tazze could be used for drinking, but they would also be used as serving dishes for small food items, such as delicacies, sweets or fruit. These lavishly decorated vessels were probably intended primarily as a spectacular display of wealth and artistic taste. They were cast in sections that screw together, with seven main parts: a base, comprising a foot and stem; a disc to support the bowl, normally concealed beneath it; the circular dish-like bowl itself; a low pedestal standing above the centre of bowl; and the figurine of a Roman emperor mounted on the pedestal, with separate cape. The inside surface of each shallow bowl is chased, with guilloche decoration around the edge. Chased classical columns separate the space into four panels, each showing a scene taken from the life of the relevant Roman emperor: Julius Caesar, Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, Nero, Galba, Otho, Vitellius, Vespasian, Titus, or Domitian. Several of the bowls are also decorated with the arms of the Italian Aldobrandini family, with a galero or ecclesiastical hat with six tassels to either side. These denote ecclesiastical rank in the hierarchy of the Catholic Church, with six tassels usually indicating a bishop. In many cases, the arms are marked on the underside of the bowl, suggesting the set was not commissioned by the Aldobrandini family but acquired later. The silver tazze were made in white metal in around 1560-70, and were gilded after 1861. The designer and maker is not known. Differences in style between the chased decoration of the bowls suggests that more than several skilled craftsmen were involved. Elements of the bowl decoration may be derived from the work of Italian artist Pirro Ligorio (1513-1583), and the figurines may be based on work by the Flemish artist Johannes Stradanus (1523-1605) who worked in Italy in the late 16th century. In six cases, the original foot and stem with restrained classically- inspired fluting has been replaced by a contemporaneous but more decorative foot from another source, possibly from a set of 16th-century Spanish monstrances or reliquaries. Early history The early history of the tazze is not known securely. The 12 tazze are included in an inventory of Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini dated 1603. It is possible that they were owned by Ippolito Aldobrandini the Elder (1536-1605), who became Pope Clement VIII in 1592. If the six tassels on the family arms accurately indicate a bishop, they suggest he acquired the tazze before he became a cardinal in 1585. However, the marks may have been added later by other relatives who were also Catholic clergymen. Perhaps more likely, they may have been given to Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini by Archduke Albert VII of Austria: the Aldobrandini family hosted the Archduke during his visit to Ferrara in 1598, when he was released from his office as cardinal by Pope Clement VIII before hismarriage by procuration to Isabella Clara Eugenia, Infanta of Spain, in parallel to the marriage of her half-brother Philip III of Spain to Archduke Albert's niece Margaret of Austria. It seems that the complete set came into the ownership of Cardinal Ippolito Aldobrandini the Younger (1592-1638), and they were included in an inventory made in 1638, after his death. They were probably inherited through his mother, (1567-1637) from her brothers, the Cardinal-nephews Pietro Aldobrandini (1551-1610) and Cinzio Aldobrandini (1571-1621). The tazze passed to Ippolito the Younger's niece Olimpia Aldobrandini (1623-1682), who was married first to Paolo Borghese (1622-1646) in 1638 and then to Camillo Pamphilj (1622-1666) in 1647. The tazze were inherited by her son (1648-1709), and are included in an inventory made in 1710, when they were held in the Guardaroba Aldobrandini in the Palazzo del Corso. The tazze are recorded in the ownership of the Borghese branch of the family in 1769. They may have remained in Italy until around 1798, when Napoleon's army occupied Rome. History from the 19th century  The set of 12 tazze may have been taken to London by a steward of the Pamphilj family in the early 19th century. They were in the possession of the retail silversmith Kensington Lewis (c.1790-1854) in London by 1826.Silver in England, Philippa Glanville, p.121 Attributed to Benvenuto Cellini, the set was sold for 1,000 guineas by the London auctioneer George Robins in February 1834. They came into the collection of Charles Scarisbrick (1801-1860) of Scarisbrick Hall in Lancashire. After his death, they were sold again at Christie's in London in May 1861 for 1,200 guineas, and acquired by the art dealer Richard Attenborough. It seems that they were gilded at some point in the decade after 1861: earlier inventories and descriptions record them as being made of silver; later descriptions record them as silver-gilt. A set of casts of the 12 emperor figurines was made while the collection was complete. These casts were in a private collection in the UK in the 1970s, and offered for sale at Christie's in 1976 by the estate of the Arthur Gore, 6th Earl of Arran. Auction of Italian Renaissance silver-gilt tazza identified as Nero figure and Augustus bowl, Christie's, London, 5 July 2000, Sale 6293, Lot 18 Auction of silver-gilt tazza with an Italian Renaissance figure of Titus, Christie's, London, 5 July 2000, Sale 6293, Lot 19 The Paris dealer Fr√©d√©ric Spitzer acquired the tazze, and he may have sold six of them (Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, Nero, Galba) to different collectors, with as many as five being acquired by various members of the Rothschild family. The six tazze that remained in Spitzer's collection (Julius Caesar, Otho, Vitellius, Vespasian, Titus, Domitian) until his death were sold in Paris in 1893. Some of the bowls and emperors had become mismatched, and Spitzer had replaced the simple fluted stem and base described at earlier auctions with more elaborate bases, perhaps assisted by Spitzer's frequent collaborator, the Aachen goldsmith and art faker Reinhold Vasters.Decorative Arts, Metropolitan Museum of Art, p.99 According to Hayward, the replacement feet and stems may have been removed from contemporary 16th-century Spanish monstrances or reliquaries and attached to the tazze by Spitzer to increase their market appeal and price. Five were acquired by the Frankfurt art dealer Jakob Goldschmidt, but the Julius Caesar tazza was sold separately.

McFadden said in 1976 that \\"several bowls and figures are, at present, unlocated, including the bowl and figure of Tiberius, the Claudius figure and bowl, the Nero bowl, and the figure of Galba\\". The locations of these items have become known since the 1970s. The complete Claudius tazza (figure and bowl) is in a private collection, as is the bowl of the Nero tazza; the figure of Galba is in Lisbon, with a bowl identified as part of the Caligula tazza. The location of all known surviving elements became clear when the 12 tazze were reunited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2014,Cups running over - Classics and silverware, A Don's Life, Mary Beard, Times Literary Supplement website, 22 June 2014 and displayed together at an exhibition there from December 2017 to March 2018, reconfigured to show the correct emperor with the correct bowl. They were disassembled to be shipped for exhibition at Waddesdon Manor from April to July 2018, where again they will be shown in their proper configuration. After the exhibition, the intention is to return them to their current owners in their modern, mismatched state, but negotiations are ongoing to reverse the mismatches on a more permanent basis. Only one tazza, of Claudius, remains in its original configuration, with the original fluted base, and the Claudius bowl matched with the Claudius figurine. Five others have the original base, but the bowls and figurines are mismatched (Galba bowl with Caligula figurine, and Caligula bowl with Galba figurine; Augustus bowl with Nero figurine, Nero bowl with Tiberius figurine, Tiberius bowl with Domitian figurine). The Domitian bowl is associated with the Augustus figurine, but has a replica of its original fluted base (the original is lost). Four others (Julius Caesar, Otho, Vitellius, and Vespasian) have matching bowls and figurines but replaced decorated bases. The Titus bowl is missing both its figurine and its base.

The bowl was traditionally thought to show Domitian but has recently been re-identified as Tiberius; it is now associated with the figurine of Domitian, but until 1956 with the figurine of Vitellius. The Vitellius figurine was removed in 1956 and transferred as part of a three-way swap: the figurine of Vitellius was sent to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York; the Metropolitan Museum sent its figurine of Otho to the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, and the figurine of Domitian from Toronto was sent to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The attempt to correct the mismatches reunited the Vitellius and Otho bowls in New York and Toronto with the correct figurines, and was intended to reunite Domitian too, but inadvertently created a new mismatch in London.Tiberius tazza, Metropolitan Museum of Art ** The Tiberius figurine (associated with the bowl of the Nero tazza) is held in a private collection, on loan to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.Tazza with Emperor Tiberius figure and dish with scenes from the life of Nero, Metropolitan Museum of Art *Caligula ** The bowl of the Caligula tazza (with original fluted base, and associated with the figurine of Galba) is at the in Lisbon.Highlights of the Museu Medeiros e Almeida, LisbonLuxMedeiros e Almeida House-MuseumCaligula tazza, Metropolitan Museum of Art ** The Caligula figurine (associated with the bowl of the Galba tazza) is in the Bruno Schroder collection in the United Kingdom.

The core hereditary lands of the family were ruled jointly by all branches, and the office of the Imperial Marshal of the Holy Roman Empire was held by the family's most senior agnate, which was Henry. In 1482, this line inherited Bad Gr√∂nenbach and Rothenstein, fiefs of Kempten Abbey, from the House of Rothenstein though this inheritance was disputed by other lines of the Rothenstein family and would only be settled in the Pappenheim's favour in 1508. From these territories comes the name of this line as both of these territories were located in the Allg√§u. In 1494 Henry died and Pappenheim-Allg√§u was partitioned by his heirs, forming the lines of Pappenheim-Gr√∂nenbach and Pappenheim-Rothenstein.

He was educated at Phillips Andover Academy, where he graduated as valedictorian, before studying medicine at Harvard Medical School. Career He was ordained to the clergy in 1854, becoming a \\"brilliant, fervent, and impressive\\" Congregational preacher who ministered throughout Massachusetts. Though Ames was educated to undertake missionary work in West Africa, the poor state of health of his wife ultimately precluded him from traveling abroad. Ames was a firm believer in criminal rehabilitation and, in 1862, was made superintendent and chaplain of the Lancaster Industrial School for Girls. Two years later he expressed, in writing, his concerns for what he saw as a growing problem with a lack of skilled education, and prevalence of idleness, among working class girls, and opined that without education many would be destined for unemployment and homelessness. In 1874, after plans were announced to install workshops at the school, Ames ‚Äì concerned that the new direction towards prison industry was transforming it into a jail ‚Äì resigned in protest.

She did not return. An automated teller machine (ATM) security camera in Loretteville recorded her attempting to withdraw money early in the afternoon; she was last seen almost five hours after leaving home at a coffee shop in Saint-Romuald. Many sightings of her have been reported since then, especially in areas of Ontario just outside Quebec, but none have been confirmed. Quebec City police (SPVQ), who continue to investigate, have theorized that Bergeron committed suicide. Her family, who has put up a reward for information leading to the resolution of the case, believes she may have instead met with foul play. Shortly before her disappearance she had moved back to Quebec City from Montreal, where she told her parents, without being specific, that something had happened there and she no longer felt safe living on her own. Due to this, and the jurisdictional limitations of the SPVQ, the family has repeatedly petitioned the provincial Ministry of Public Security to order the case file transferred to either the Montreal police or the S√ªret√© du Qu√©bec, both of whom they feel could make more progress; the request has been refused. As a result, they have retained former provincial justice minister Marc Bellemare to press their case. Crime journalist Claude Poirier has also devoted an episode of his Historia series Poirier Enqu√™te to the case. In 2017, a friend who knew Bergeron in Montreal confirmed that she had grown increasingly fearful and reclusive there in the two months before her disappearance. He said he had asked her if she had been raped or witnessed a crime. She said what had happened to her was \\"worse\\" than that, but refused to elaborate. Background Marilyn Bergeron was born in 1983 in Chicoutimi; the family moved to the Quebec City borough of Haute‚ÄìSaint‚ÄìCharles in 1998. Before then, at the age of 10, she began taking music lessons. At Roger-Comtois High School, her mother, Andr√©e Bechard, recalls Marilyn always trying to get a band together. Later, she attended Neufch√¢tel High School, where she furthered her musical interests with extracurricular programs. In an interview with Claude Poirier, Bergeron's parents recalled her as reckless, sometimes getting in trouble, and having friends who were bad influences. They also said she was open to and interested in all cultures and nationalities. She spoke English and her native French with equal fluency, had learned a little Spanish as well and was starting to learn Russian. After earning a degree in media arts and technology at C√©gep de Jonqui√®re, and later taking classes at the Joliette campus of the C√©gep r√©gional de Lanaudi√®re, Bergeron moved to Montreal in 2005. There she worked as a sales assistant in Steve's Music Store, and did freelance sound editing work for local TV stations. She was also training in finance at Industrial Alliance. Her hope was to become a flight attendant and move to Western Canada within a few years. Early in 2008, Marilyn began telling her family that she no longer felt safe in Montreal and wanted to return to Quebec. She told her mother that when she did, she would tell her why. On February 10 of that year, she abruptly left her apartment on Hochelaga Street in the Hochelaga-Maisonneuve neighborhood of Montreal, and returned to her parents' house. Six days later, after two more trips to Montreal to retrieve belongings from her apartment, she had finally moved in with her parents again. During that week, her family said it was obvious something was deeply troubling her. \\"Is there light at the end of this tunnel?\\" she asked her sister, Nathalie, over the phone. She said she did not want to return to Montreal again. But she would not say why. \\"We tried to get her to talk but she wouldn't talk, she would only cry\\", Nathalie told the Montreal Gazette a year later. Andr√©e Bechard confronted her daughter about what had happened in Montreal that so perturbed her that she had to return home so quickly and leave behind her life there, apparently for good. Marilyn specifically denied that her problems involved drugs, debts, or a relationship. When Andr√©e then asked Marilyn if she had been \\"assaulted\\", Marilyn said nothing and her face took on a pained expression and she began crying. Andr√©e said that if she would not talk to her mother, she had to talk to someone, and suggested she talk to a psychologist instead. Disappearance On the morning of February 17, the day after she had finished relocating herself from Montreal, Marilyn told her parents she was going out for a walk. She was wearing a long black overcoat with gray fake fur trim and suede boots. With the exception of her credit card, she left any other identification at home. Shortly after 11 a.m., Marilyn stopped at an ATM at the Caisse Populaire on Boulevard de l'Ormi√®re in Loretteville. Her attempt to withdraw CAD$60 was declined. Security camera footage released later shows her looking behind her several times during the encounter. She also had a black backpack slung over one shoulder. At 4:03 p.m. Marilyn bought a cup of coffee at a Caf√© D√©p√¥t in Saint-Romuald, south of her parents' house, on the south side of the St. Lawrence River. She paid using her credit card. The clerk, who confirmed that Bergeron was the customer he served, said that she seemed depressed and eager to leave the store. No one has seen her since then, nor has the credit card been used. Investigation When Marilyn failed to return home by that evening, her family reported her missing to the Quebec City police, who were soon able to track her banking records to the ATM and the coffee shop. They also began their own efforts to locate her, searching the city themselves, and printing up and distributing flyers with a picture and other information about Marilyn, including a distinctive Pegasus tattoo on her upper right breast visible when she wore low-cut tops. A CAD$10,000 reward was offered. Their efforts also included putting information online; local media also covered the case extensively.Poirier, 9‚Äì10 minutes. The police would not, at first, let Marilyn's parents see the ATM security video; they considered it too upsetting to show them.Poirier, 11‚Äì12 minutes. When they did see it, Andr√©e agreed that her daughter looked \\"helpless\\". Poirier, in an episode of his Historia series Poirier Enqu√™te devoted to the case, visited the same ATM and believes that Marilyn may have been looking back at a car parked on the street outside, which she could easily have seen from that angle. While it is possible that she could have walked the entire , the shortest route between her house and the Caf√© D√©p√¥t, her family believes it is most likely that she was driven by someone, or hitched a ride. When police released the ATM video on the anniversary of Marilyn's disappearance a year later, they asked if anyone who might have driven her that day could remember it and come forward. After the initial searches, no new information came to light for almost two years. In January 2010 Poirier was contacted by a man who claimed to have seen Marilyn in Hawkesbury, Ontario, a predominantly Francophone community just over the Ottawa River from Quebec. He claimed to have seen her regularly over the year before he had called; he believed she had settled there, with a younger man, and moved around town several times. Regular customers at a downtown restaurant also said they had seen her there, with a man, after being shown her photo. Several times during the 2010s, the family made formal requests to the provincial Ministry of Public Security (MPS) to have the case formally transferred to the jurisdiction of either the S√ªret√© du Qu√©bec (SQ) or the Montreal police. The former had province-wide jurisdiction and a reputation as Quebec's most capable law enforcement agency; the latter could investigate in Montreal, where they had come to believe Marilyn's friends and acquaintances from her life there might know more that might be helpful in resolving the case. While they did say the Quebec police had \\"done their best\\", the Bergerons were also frustrated that the Quebec police continued to investigate the case strictly as a disappearance, possibly a suicide, without considering the possibility of criminal involvement. =2017 developments= Those requests were regularly rejected, even after the Bergerons personally appealed to then-minister Lise Th√©riault in a 2015 meeting. At a February 2017 news conference with former provincial justice minister Marc Bellemare, whom they had retained as their lawyer, Bellemare joined them in expressing disappointment that all their requests to transfer the case, or even to allow them to examine the file, had been refused. Both the Quebec police and the SQ responded via the media. \\"In this case, whenever required, the S√ªret√© du Qu√©bec offered its full cooperation and support to the Quebec City Police Service\\", an MPS spokeswoman told Journal Metro. The Quebec City police confirmed that they still saw the case as a disappearance, \\"but yes, we take it seriously\\", and had cooperated with other police services and done their best to keep the family informed. At that same news conference, the Bergerons announced that the reward for information leading to Marilyn's whereabouts had been increased to CAD$30,000. Bellemare announced also that he was setting up a tipline for people whom he believed might have useful information but did not want to contact the police directly. \\"There are certainly people who know things about what happened to Marilyn\\", he said. \\"What we want is to find Marilyn. That's our goal\\". At a second press conference that November, the Bergerons announced that the tipline had drawn 43 reports of sightings. They were accompanied by a man who had had some conversations with Marilyn during her last months in Montreal that went into further detail about why she felt she had to leave that city and return home so abruptly. Jonathan Gauthier, a friend of Marilyn's from college, had reconnected with her in Montreal in late 2007. On December 10, he told the media, he had gone to meet her and go out to a party. At her apartment, he was immediately struck by the difference in Marilyn's demeanor. Instead of being cheerful and upbeat as she had been previously, Gauthier says, she was downcast, listening to music in the dark. Marilyn's mood lifted somewhat when they went to the party, but then, Gauthier continued, after talking to a friend of hers Marilyn suddenly became anxious, as if that conversation had revived an unpleasant memory, and she asked to go home. Back at her apartment, he said, her mood further deteriorated and she began crying continuously. Attempting to calm her down, Gauthier asked if she had been raped, or witnessed a murder; she emphatically denied both. Instead, Marilyn told him something worse had happened. Gauthier asked her repeatedly what it was, but she refused to say. \\"You can't even begin to imagine what I've been through, Jo\\", he says she told him. \\"I tried to get her to say what it was for three or four hours\\", he said. \\"I got the impression that she did not want to put me in danger\\".

Historically it has served as the family home of medical doctor Hogan J. Ring (1851-1930), his office, a public hospital, veteran's building, rest home, apartments, and a bed and breakfast inn. About The Gingerbread Mansion is the largest residential building in Ferndale, with three floors, 32 rooms, 11 bedrooms, 9 bathrooms and extensive gardens in 1975 when it had been converted into apartments. In 2017, it had 11 bedrooms and 11.5 bathrooms and is a working bed-and-breakfast.Ferndale Enterprise Souvenir Edition, 2017 History Dr. Ring had a house, a barn and a water tank house on the property prior to the construction of the mansion which were moved to the Francis addition by John Morris house movers in April, 1899. The Ring Mansion was unusually well-built, even for its time, from the concrete foundation up to crawl spaces between floors. Built, as were many Ferndale residences, from redwood, the Gingerbread Mansion also has double wall construction and square support members. Ring's builders created a turreted, balconied, gabled and crested Victorian Gothic with Queen Anne influences in the spindles and turnings which cover the Berding Street facade and continue partway down Brown Street. The exterior was fully fenced and had a concrete sidewalk built in 1899. The highly ornamented original portion of the home is in front, an addition in 1920 added the less decorated section at the rear to serve as the town hospital. = Hogan J. Ring and family = Hogan J. Ring was born Haagan J. Fjorkenstad, son of Jens and Helene Fjokenstad on February 17, 1851, on an estate in Norway named Ringtogen. His older brother Johannes settled in Minnesota at age 12, and at age 14 Hagaan emigrated to the United States on an old sailing ship named the Emerald to join him. The Fjorkenstad boys became the \\"Ring\\" brothers from their estate name because their Norwegian name was too hard to pronounce; and Haagan became Hogan when he took U.S. citizenship. In 1873 Ring moved to Whalan, Minnesota, where he served as postmaster and played in the coronet band. Subsequently, he enrolled at and graduated from Bennett College of Eclectic Medicine and Surgery in Chicago, Illinois (currently Loyola University Chicago School of Medicine) He married his wife Ida (1860-1901) before 1877 and they moved back to Whalan, Minnesota where Ring had a medical practice and drug store. He sold the practice in 1878 and the family moved to Grand Island, Nebraska for nine years. Hogan, Ida and their children Johannes Glenellyn 1877-?, Rena 1882-?, Mildred 1887-?, and Verna Helene arrived in Ferndale in 1887 and two sons, Ronald Lowe 1894 -? and Arden Garrison 1899-?, were born afterwards. Ring was one of the town's physicians until 1930, surviving his wife Ida who died in 1900, subsequently marrying widow Eleanor Black Andreasen, with whom he had two more sons (Harlan 1905-?, and Ingvald Taft ?-?). Besides Ring's children, the family included Eleanor's two children from her first marriage. Altogether ten Ring children grew up in the mansion. Ring's brother, Jacob, was a pharmacist and opened practice on Main Street. In 1890, Ring's practice was located next to the old post office. From 1894 to 1896 he was in practice with Dr. Ross at various locations including next to the Red Star Clothing store on Main Street. Ring also practiced at the new Brown/Hart building in 1902; in a building no longer there due to fire. In 1906, the building at 350 Main Street was built for his practice. Nearing the end of his life it was said he had delivered half the people in town as babies. Dr. Ring was a trustee of the High School District when it opened and his home was a social center of town, with musical events featuring Verna and Dr. Ring playing duets on piano and violin. On August 26, 1902, The Ferndale Enterprise reported that Ring daughter Verna Helene married Charles Francis Taubman in a double wedding with his brother Harry Taubman and Helene Helgestad in the parlor at the Mansion with a reception in a tent on the grounds. The Taubmans were sons of the owner of Ferndale's Red Star Clothing Store on Main Street, and their father Lee Taubman built two homes on Rose Avenue in East Ferndale. Dr. Ring had improvements made to the house by John Kerri in 1905, by A.L. Trousdale in 1909 and the latter painted the entire house pure white in 1913. =Ferndale General Hospital= In 1910 Dr. Ring and Dr. Phelan opened the first Ferndale General Hospital at a building on Washington formerly occupied by the Catholic Convent. In 1913 Dr. F.M. Bruner bought into the practice. This situation persisted until the Catholic sisters returned to open a school in Ferndale in 1915. The hospital relocated to the Bruner/Wunderlich home. In 1920, Dr. Ring suggested that his mansion be converted into a public hospital by contractor Frank Slingsby. A 50-foot addition was put on the back of the family home and the hospital opened on March 25, 1921. > New Ferndale Hospital opens to public; is finely equipped ... splendidly > located on Berding street at the corner of Brown, the spacious building, > with modern equipment and planned to obtain the most perfect results for > convenience and comfort, stands as a monument to the progressiveness of the > people of this valley, who have made its construction possible ... a > corridor runs the entire length of the building on the lower floor.

Ericksen due to state regulations on hospitals. At about this time, the Ferndale General Hospital closed and Dr. Ring had offices on Main Street in the Heney building. In 1928, after being closed for two years, the hospital, grounds and all fixtures were sold to Dr. O.B. Barron at auction to satisfy the foreclosure of the mortgage of $2600. The Barrons moved into the home in September 1928, and Dr. Barron practiced medicine in the building. After 43 years of service in Ferndale, Doctor Ring died in 1930. In 1931 a memorial to Dr. Ring was erected on the ground of the Ferndale Library. = Later uses = Subsequent to its use as the Ferndale General Hospital, the mansion was Ferndale's first American Legion Post veteran's building,Ferndale Enterprise, 1974 a rest home operated by Mrs. Mabel Klaverweiden, and a private home, apartments and finally a bed- and-breakfast inn. During the 1970s, owners Thomas Manning and Donald L. Dickerson maintained and enhanced the garden's border shrubbery, story-tall camellias at the entry, brick paths, statues, and fountains. It was at this time that the building was painted in bright colors. In the 1980s owner Ken Torbert converted the apartments to a Bed and Breakfast and continued to develop the gardens. The first floor has been returned to classical Victorian style, but at least one author has been surprised by the sensual nature of the upstairs bedrooms. Two child ghosts have been reported. The iconic palm tree was a victim of the California drought in 2016. The Gingerbread Mansion is referred to as one of the most often photographed bed-and-breakfasts in the United States. It has been featured in National Geographic, September 1977, as well as Sunset Magazine, April 1972 which featured the gardens. In 1998, the formal English gardens were mature and the building was painted yellow gold on the siding, but the trim - currently orange - was painted peach pink. The building has been painted gold and orange since at least 2001.

On his return to Massachusetts he married Mary Keith on May 20, 1851. Nye then sailed to California, crossing the Isthmus of Panama on foot, and arriving in San Francisco shortly after the Fire of 1851 which had destroyed much of the city. He worked in the re- building of the city for several years, helping to construct some of San Francisco's first brick buildings. 1894 advertisement for Nye's oils In 1855, Nye returned to New Bedford and set up an oil and kerosene business which he operated until the outbreak of the American Civil War when he joined the Union Army as a sutler to the Massachusetts Artillery and the 4th Massachusetts Cavalry. He was with the advance guard of the cavalry when it entered Richmond, Virginia in 1865 and set up a trading post there in one of the city's remaining brick buildings. For a time he was the sole tradesman operating in Richmond. After his regiment was mustered out in November 1865 Nye returned to New Bedford and began developing the lubricant oil business for which he became principally known. Nye's oil business, originally run out of small rented premises in Fairhaven, focused primarily on highly refined lubricant oils for watches, clocks, typewriters, sewing machines, and bicycles. In the late 1860s he acquired an entire catch of 2,200 pilot whales which would supply the raw material for his lubricating oils for several years. He expanded the business in 1877 with the purchase of a large brick building on Fish Island which became its principal refinery. By 1888, his company had become one of the world's largest suppliers of refined lubricant oils. In 1896 Nye absorbed Ezra Kelley's oil company, his main rival. He remained actively involved in the business until shortly before his death in 1910 at the age of 86.Zabawski, Evan (January 2017). \\"Purposeful porpoise oil\\". TLT.

The monument built in the style of the Nakhchivan-Maragha architectural school was the residence of the Nakhchivan khans before the early 20th century. At the end of the 18th century, the palace was built with the order of Nakhchivan khan, Ehsan Khan‚Äôs father Kelbali Khan Kangarli. The Khan Palace has been operating since April 1998 as Nakhchivan Carpet Museum.

The Khan Palace complex features a 42 x 8 m building, a newly built swimming pool, water well, green stripes, ornamental and fruit trees. The building is two floors. By the time the palace consisted of two separate sections. The southern section is intended for administrative work and reception of high- class guests, while the northern section is intended for khan's family. Entrance to sections was one of the corridors with two-storeyed balconies. Currently, only southern corridor is used because of the museum's location in the palace. An internal passage was created between the sections. The corridors go above the main fa√ßade. The stairs are surrounded by bricks and are fixed with wooden railings. The total area of the Khan Palace is 382 m¬≤ and thickness of its walls vary from 60 cm to 1.1 m. The building was built with baked bricks of 20x20x5 cm.

There are 3 rooms on the 1st floor, 8 rooms (2 halls) on 2nd floor and 2 attics on the ornaments that are used as rooms. Both mansions have access to open balconies over the corridors. In the western part of the hall designed for guests, a 40 cm height stage type couch was built. The open windows of the wooden beam are decorated with nets and ceilings with small mirrors. Other walls of the hall have been designed with trunks, fountain and plot illustrations. In the course of many repairs and restoration works, the paintings were damaged or covered with plaster. The southern wall and its surroundings are decorated with geometrical shapes and mirror pieces. The building was warmed by two steamers placed on the walls. Activity After the Nakhichevan Khanate was abolished, the Kangarli cavalry commander was placed in this palace, and the headquarters of the Nakhchivan National Defense Council moved here in 1918‚Äì1920.

It connects Gelsenkirchen-Buer Nord station on the Oberhausen- Osterfeld S√ºd‚ÄìHamm railway (Oberhausen-Osterfeld ‚Äì Hamm (Westf) marshalling yard) with Marl Lippe junction on the Wanne-Eickel‚ÄìHamburg railway (Wanne- Eickel Hbf ‚Äì Hamburg Hbf). The route is included in the list lines showing local speeds under the VzG route number of 2252. As the railway was planned by the Ruhr coal district association as traffic axis (Verkehrsband) No. 9, it is also colloquially called V9.  History The Essener Volkszeitung newspaper published an article on 14 April 1903 addressing the need for a railway from Essen to open up the coalfields north of the city. The article was well received by both the city and the K√∂nigliche Eisenbahndirektion (Royal Railway division, KED, later Reichsbahndirektion) of Essen. Under the first plans, the new connection would run from Essen Hauptbahnhof via Stoppenberg and Altenessen to the railway of the Nordstern colliery and from there via Horst, Buer and Marl to Haltern. Three different routes were debated for the middle section. The western options ran through Gladbeck, the middle via Buer and the eastern via Erle and Middelich. The latter variant was demanded by the city of Buer, but rejected by the city of Gladbeck from the outset. The planning committee finally settled on the middle option until May 1904 and submitted the proposal to the Prussian Ministry of Public Works. The Ministry rejected the proposal in a letter of 2 January 1905, referring to the Hamm‚ÄìOsterfeld railway, then under construction, and the fact that its effects on traffic were awaited. For the southern section, the Ministry also proposed the construction of connecting curves from the Winterswijk‚ÄìGelsenkirchen-Bismarck railway to Schalke Nord station or from Bottrop to the M√ºlheim-Hei√üen/Essen West ‚Äì Oberhausen-Osterfeld Nord railway. Thus, existing north-south lines could be used. A proposal submitted by the city of Gelsenkirchen in late 1903 with a routing from Gelsenkirchen Hauptbahnhof via Schalke S√ºd, Schalke Nord and east of Buer was also declined by the ministry in mid-1905, citing the Hamm-Osterfeld railway. Under the leadership of the Buer mayor August de la Chevallerie, the cities of Buer, Essen and Gelsenkirchen then joined forces to work out a joint proposal. After a first submission in 1908 again met with rejection, the joint commission developed a package solution with three routes. Along with the undisputed Buer ‚Äì Marl ‚Äì Haltern northern section, the project envisaged a line from Gelsenkirchener Hauptbahnhof via the stations of Gelsenkirchen-Bismarck and Westerholt to Marl and an electric rapid transit system running directly from Gelsenkirchen via Schalke to Buer. Since this proposal was not pursued further, the city of Gelsenkirchen left the commission in 1911. The KED Essen used an opportunity to carry out preparatory work in the area of the connecting curve in Schalke proposed by the Ministry. Shortly thereafter, the ministry instructed the KED to also carry out preparatory work for the section from Buer S√ºd to Haltern. A law adopted in 1914 approving a loan for the railway set out the basic information on it and the course described largely corresponded with the route proposed by the city of Essen in its 1903 plan. Deviating from this was the intended connecting curve between the stations of Buer S√ºd and Buer Nord, which went far to the west and branched off from the Winterswijk ‚Äì Gelsenkirchen-Bismarck line just before Gladbeck Ost station. The city of Gladbeck therefore demanded a relocation of the route to pass through Gladbeck Ost station, referring to its importance‚ÄîGladbeck Ost was at this time the second largest passenger station in the M√ºnster region in terms of passenger numbers. The KED then moved the curve a little west, but still branching off before Gladbeck Ost station. Since the city seemed dissatisfied by this proposal, the route was relocated to the east outside the municipality following the end of the First World War, so that the city would not affect the approval process. It led to further route proposals by the city of Gladbeck and, among other things, the city administration sought a report from the traffic scientist Erich Giese, who proposed a complete reconstruction of the Gladbeck railway infrastructure without success. Deutsche Reichsbahn restarted work on the project in 1927 as part of the Ruhr development program of the Ruhr coal district association (Siedlungsverband Ruhrkohlenbezirk, SVR) and again used the routes set out the railway bond act of 1914. In addition, Deutsche Reichsbahn planned connecting curves from Horst to Gelsenkirchen Hauptbahnhof and continuing to Bochum Pr√§sident station. Within the development program, the route received the designation of Verkehrsband Nr. 9 (traffic axis no. 9); the abbreviation of \\"V9\\" was soon used as an alternative name for the route. This was followed by preliminary work in the Gelsenkirchen Hbf area and the first preliminary measures were carried out in the Essen city area from 1937. The Second World War eventually prevented the implementation of the project. Deutsche Bundesbahn resumed preparatory work on Verkehrsband 9 in 1957. The work was now limited to the northern section from Gelsenkirchen-Buer Nord via Marl to Haltern, a continuation to the south was now no longer provided and services would run on the existing routes via Bottrop Hbf. Extensive work was required for the construction, as the route crosses other traffic routes at a grade- separated junction at Lippe. After an eleven-year construction period, the connection was opened on 27 September 1968. The stations of Gelsenkirchen- Hassel, Marl-Drewer and Marl-Hamm were also opened that day. The halt of Marl- Drewer, which was closed in 1998, in 2014 A junction was built for a siding to the Chemischen Werke H√ºls (H√ºls Chemical works, now: Chemiepark Marl), located north of Marl-Drewer, in 1971. Three years later, on 24 October 1974, the halt of Marl Mitte was opened. The halt, together with the Marler Stern shopping centre, which opened at the same time, forms the centre of Marl. In response to the ambitions of the city, the station received a comparatively large development and several pre-construction works were carried out for a planned second track. The line became part of the network of the Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn on 24 May 1998. In preparation, necessary adjustments were made to the railway infrastructure. Passenger services at Gelsenkirchen-Buer Nord station were abandoned and a new halt (Gelsenkirchen-Buer Nord Hp) was built above the street of K√∂nigswiese. This provides better interchanges with local bus routes. The old station itself continues to exist as a depot. New platforms with a height of 96 centimetres were also installed in Gelsenkirchen-Hassel and Marl-Hamm. The platforms in Marl Mitte remained untouched by the works and the halt of Marl-Drewer was abandoned with the conversion to S-Bahn operations because it was too close to Marl Mitte.  Route description= Course and operating points = The line starts at Gelsenkirchen-Buer Nord station on the Hamm-Osterfeld railway. The station, opened in 1905, served until 1992 as a goods yard and until 1998 as a passenger station. The line turns diverts from VzG line 2250 immediately after the entrance building. The halt (Haltepunkt) at Gelsenkirchen-Buer Nord is located on the overpass over K√∂nigswiese. It provides a better connection to the local bus routes and was built in 1998 as a replacement for the former station. The line initially runs parallel to the Hamm-Osterfeld railway and swings to the north after about two kilometres. At Kilometre 3.9, it reaches the halt of Gelsenkirchen-Hassel. It has a platform on the west side of the track. It can be reached via stairs and a ramp. Bahnhof Gelsenkirchen-Buer Nord 02 Empfangsgeb√§ude.JPGGelsenkirchen-Buer Nord, 2014 Haltepunkt Gelsenkirchen-Buer Nord Hp 01 Bahnsteig.JPGGelsenkirchen-Buer Nord Hp, 2014 Bahnhof Gelsenkirchen-Hassel.jpgGelsenkirchen-Hassel, 2007 Upon reaching the Marl urban area, the line runs in a cutting. This barrier also forms part of the boundaries of several districts of Marl. The halt of Marl Mitte is located at kilometre 6.3. The attached Marl Mitte (S) bus station is one of the central connecting points in the bus network of the Vestische Stra√üenbahnen. The Marler Stern shopping centre is also in the immediate vicinity of the halt. Access is via a pedestrian bridge with a lift connecting to the Marler Stern as well as via a level access to the east. One kilometre past Marl Mitte was the former halt of Marl-Drewer. The station was abandoned with the conversion of the line to S-Bahn operations due to the short distance between the stations. The halt had a platform on the eastern side of the line. The line climbs after Marl-Drewer. The junction of Marl CWH siding is located at kilometre 11.3. Until 2003, the operating point was classified as a railway junction. The junction connects the railway of RBH Logistics (now a subsidiary of DB Cargo) to Chemiepark Marl (formerly Chemische Werke H√ºls, abbreviated CHW). There is an alternative connection to the chemical park from Marl-Sinsen station on the Wanne-Eickel‚ÄìHamburg railway. This connection crosses the line over a bridge directly after the Marl CWH siding. The halt of Marl-Hamm is located in the north of the city on an embankment. A section of the A 52 runs parallel to the line. The halt has a side platform and can be reached by stairs and lifts. Marl Lippe junction starts at kilometre 14.7. The track splits behind block signal 91 911 into two tracks. The regular track passes under the Wanne-Eickel‚ÄìHamburg line providing a grade-separated connection. After the connection of the lines, but still within the formal precincts of the junction, the line crosses the Marler Stra√üe level crossing. In the immediate vicinity of the junction is the Autobahnkreuz Marl-Nord (interchange) of the A 43, A 52 and L 612\\\\. The A 43 and the L 612 cross the line in the area of Marl Lippe junction. Haltepunkt Marl Mitte 04 Bahnsteig.JPGMarl Mitte, 2014 Bahnhof Marl-Hamm 01.jpgMarl-Hamm, 2011 Abzweigstelle Marl Lippe 03 Weichenbereich.JPGMarl Lippe, 2014 The line is structurally prepared for a second track. The junction in Gelsenkirchen-Buer Nord station has a second track base south of the Oberhausen-Osterfeld S√ºd‚ÄìHamm railway. Most overpasses are provided with abutments for the second track and similarly the underpasses have room for a second track. Marl Mitte station is designed to be an island platform, although an access crosses over the unused platform edge. The platform in Marl-Hamm lies on the path of the second track. = Control and signalling technology = Signal box Buf in Gelsenkirchen-Buer Nord, 2014 The line has been controlled since the opening by three signal boxes. These are located at Gelsenkirchen-Buer Nord station, at the Marl CWH connecting point and at Haltern am See station (until 1986 at Marl Lippe junction). Signal box \\"Buf\\" (\\"Bu\\" for Gelsenkirchen-Buer Nord and \\"f\\" for Fahrdienstleiter‚Äîdispatcher) was a relay interlocking of the SpDrL30 class. The junction signal box in Marl CWH (DrS2 class) was remotely controlled. The block signal in Marl CWH allows higher utilisation of the single-track line. Since 2007, both interlockings have been remotely controlled by electronic interlocking \\"Of\\" in Oberhausen- Osterfeld station, the existing systems were replaced by Bereichsrechner (area computers). Marl Lippe Junction initially had its own signal box of DrS2 class. After 1986, it was controlled from signal box \\"Hf\\" at Haltern am See station. The dispatcher could operate it from a separate control panel of the SpDrL60 class. Since 1998, with the transfer of control to the \\"Df\\" electronic control centre in D√ºlmen, signal box \\"Hf\\" continues to operate as an area computer. The Wanne-Eickel‚ÄìHamburg line in the area south of Haltern is adapted for bidirectional signalling to allow the trains of the Gelsenkirchen- Buer Nord‚ÄìMarl Lippe railway to run on the track normally used for southbound trains to Haltern. As the trains usually reverse at the western platform 1 in Haltern, this eliminates the need for an at-grade crossing of the mainline tracks in the station.  Services Entrance of a tanker train coming from Marl CWH in Gelsenkirchen-Buer Nord, 2014 The line was operated as timetable route (KBS) 234b at first, then as KBS 321 between 1972 and 1983, as KBS 381 until 1992 and as KBS 446 until 1998. Since the establishment of the S-Bahn, it has been operated as KBS 450.9. Local trains ran over the line from Haltern to Essen and beyond to Velbert and Wuppertal. Like the \\"V9\\" designation popularly given to the line, the trains originally ran as line N9 and have run as the S9 since 1998. The trains ran about hourly and this frequency was maintained with the changeover to S-Bahn operations. An increase in frequencies was difficult because the line has little alternative track. Until the 1990s, individual express services also ran over the line between M√ºnster and Duisburg (sometimes continuing to Aachen via Krefeld); these trains stopped between Haltern and GE-Buer Nord only in Marl Mitte. The S9 originally ran from Haltern am See to Essen-Steele Ost until 1998. Since 2003, the service has run via Velbert-Langenberg to Wuppertal Hbf. The services were initially operated with locomotives of class 212 with Silberling coaches; semi-fast trains were occasionally operated with class 430/830 electric railcars. The S9 services was initially operated with class 143 locomotives and x-Wagen (x-coaches) and later with class 420/421 sets. Since 2009, DB Regio has operated the services with class 422/432 railcars. Freight traffic consists mostly of traffic to Chemiepark Marl.

She won one minor race as a two-year-old in 1909 before emerging as a top-class performer in the following year. She won the Epsom Oaks, Atalanta Stakes and Great Yorkshire Stakes as well as finishing third in the 1000 Guineas and the Park Hill Stakes. After her retirement from racing she became a broodmare in England, and later in the United States. By far the best of her offspring was Gainsborough who won the 13th U.K. Triple Crown Champion and became a very successful breeding stallion. Background Rosedrop was a chestnut mare bred in England by John Doyle and owned during her racing career by Sir William Bass, 2nd Baronet who bought her as a yearling for 700 guineas. She was sent into training with Alec Taylor, Jr. at Manton, Wiltshire. She was sired by St. Frusquin who won the Middle Park Plate, Dewhurst Plate, 2000 Guineas, Princess of Wales's Stakes and Eclipse Stakes and was described as one of the best horses of the 19th century. His other progeny included St. Amant, Quintessence, and Mirska. Her dam Rosaline showed so little promise that her owner Jack Barnato Joel donated her to charity auction in aid of the Fresh Air Fund at which she was sold for 25 guineas by William Allison. Allison sold the mare by John Doyle for 200 guineas and on Doyle's death she was acquired for 900 guineas by J. Simons Harrison in a deal which also included her filly foal (Rosedrop). She came from a successful family, being descended from the influential British broodmare May Queen (foaled 1868). Racing career=1909: two-year-old season= Until 1913, there was no requirement for British racehorses to have official names and two-year-olds were allowed to run without names until 1946. The practice of running horses unnamed had once been common, but had largely fallen out of use by the early 20th Century. Rosedrop however was not officially named until 1910, and ran as a juvenile under the descriptive title of Sir W. Bass's chestnut filly by St Frusquin - Rosaline. The filly ran twice as a two-year-old in 1909, recording one win in the Rangemore Maiden Stakes at Derby Racecourse. =1910: three-year-old season= The filly was still unnamed when he ran in the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket Racecourse on 29 April and finished third of the thirteen runners behind Winkipop and Maid of Corinth (who was also owned by Bass). She was then officially given the name Rosedrop. It was reported that the filly finished unplaced in a minor race in May. On 3 June Rosedrop was moved up in distance to contest the 132nd Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse. Winkipop started favourite with Rosedrop on 7/1 in an eleven-runner field which also included Maid of Corinth. Ridden by Charlie Trigg she dominated the race from the start and won \\"in a common canter\\" by four lengths from Evolution, with Pernelle a neck away in third. At Royal Ascot eleven days later Rosedrop was matched against male opposition in the Gold Vase over two miles and finished unplaced behind the colt Charles O'Malley. In July she coped well with the exceptionally wet conditions to win the Atalanta Stakes at Sandown Park. At the Newbury summer meeting she led for most of the way in the Kingclere Stakes but was caught in the last stride and narrowly beaten by the colt Lonawand, to whom she was conceding weight. Rosedrop reversed the form in the Great Yorkshire Stakes at York in August, winning from Willonyx (later to win the Ascot Gold Cup) with Lonawand in third place. On 7 September at Doncaster Racecourse Rosedrop took on colts in the St Leger but made little impact and finished unplaced behind Swynford. Later at the same meeting she finished second to Yellow Slave in the Park Hill Stakes. Rosedrop ended the year with earnings of ¬£6,353. =1911: four-year-old season= Rosedrop remained in training as a four-year-old in 1911. On 10 May at Newmarket she was put up for auction and bought for 4,500 guineas by Alfred W. Cox. She did not race in 1911 and was retired at the end of the year. Assessment and honours In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Rosedrop a \\"poor\\" winner of the Oaks. Breeding record At the end of her racing career Rosedrop became a broodmare for Lady James Douglas. She was later exported to the United States. She produced at least six foals and two winners between 1914 and 1927: *La Tosca, a bay filly, foaled in 1914, sired by Bayardo *Gainsborough, bay colt, 1915, by Bayardo.

It is part of the Central Volcanic Zone, one of several volcanic belts in the Andes which are separated by gaps without volcanic activity. This section of the Andes was volcanically active since the Jurassic, with an episode of strong ignimbritic volcanism occurring during the Miocene. Tata Sabaya lies in a thinly populated region north of the Salar de Coipasa salt pan. Volcanic activity at Tata Sabaya and elsewhere in the Central Volcanic Zone is the consequence of the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South America Plate. The volcano has developed along a lineament that separates older crust north of the lineament from younger crust in the south, and the edifice has been formed by andesitic rocks. The southern flank of Tata Sabaya failed during the latest Pleistocene about 12,000 - 12,360 years before present. Debris from the collapse entered a lake that covered the Salar de Coipasa at that time and formed a deposit with a volume of . Subsequently, the collapse scar was partly filled in with more recent lava flows and lava domes; one eruption occurred about 6,000 years before present.  Geography and geomorphology  Tata Sabaya lies just north of the Salar de Coipasa in Bolivia. The small village of Pagador lies west-southwest of the volcano, but the whole region is overall thinly inhabited. The name means \\"Father Sabaya\\"; the term \\"Sabaya\\" may be the Aymara corruption of the Quechua term for \\"devil\\", \\"demon\\". The volcano is a topic in local myths, where it is sometimes personified. Tata Sabaya is part of the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes, which consists of a volcanic arc that mainly follows the Western Cordillera. There are about 44 Holocene volcanoes, however the remoteness of the region and dry climate has restricted scientific research of these volcanoes; among the better known are Lastarria, the Nevados de Payachata, Ollag√ºe, San Pablo, San Pedro and Socompa. Tata Sabaya is a volcano which reaches a height of . Five lava flows extend north from the summit and display levees and flow fronts, the flows reaching a maximum length of . The top of these flows is cut by a collapse scar that extends east and west of the edifice in the form of scarps up to high. The space between the scarps is in turn filled by more recent lava flows with a blocky appearance. Farther away of the edifice, the scarp is more noticeable and reaches a height of about on the southeastern side of the volcano. A large deposit south of the volcano, originally interpreted as a nuee ardente deposit, is actually a landslide deposit which extends over a length of and a width of ; its volume is about . The landslide incorporated material from the salar, and its rocks reflect in part the layering and structure of the pre-collapse volcano. The deposit is one of the more conspicuous of its type, to the point that it was observed and identified on low-resolution Landsat images. It consists of material that forms hummock-like deposits, with individual hummocks becoming smaller the farther away from the edifice they are. The deposit extends into the Salar de Coipasa where it is confined by faults and is in part covered by lacustrine sediments such as tufa. File:Tata Sabaya debris avalanche.jpgOutline of the debris avalanche File:Tata Sabaya debris avalanche DEM.jpgDebris avalanche profile File:Tata Sabaya evolution.jpgProfile of volcano development  Geology  Off the western coast of South America, the Nazca Plate subducts beneath the South America Plate at a rate of about . This subduction process is responsible for the volcanism in the Andean Volcanic Belt, which occurs in a Northern Volcanic Zone in Ecuador and Colombia, a Central Volcanic Zone in Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina and a Southern Volcanic Zone in Chile and Argentina. These volcanic zones are separated by gaps without volcanism, where the subduction process is shallower. Several phases of tectonic and volcanic activity have been identified in the Central Volcanic Zone. An earlier phase of volcanism in the Cordillera de la Costa commenced in the Jurassic but is considered separate from the Central Volcanic Zone magmatism proper. After an erosional hiatus during the Oligocene, volcanic arc activity increased during the Miocene and culminated in a phase of strong ignimbrite eruptions, which originated in calderas. This phase was associated with a substantial thickening of the crust in the Central Andes. During the Pleistocene ignimbrite volcanism waned again and stratovolcanoes began to develop. Tata Sabaya lies along a crustal transition area which separates a younger crust farther south from an older (Proterozoic) crust in the north, which is made up by the Chilenia terrane and the Arequipa-Antofalla craton, respectively. This transition area appears to coincide with a chain of volcanoes that Tata Sabaya is part of and which extends from Cerro Saxani in the east to Isluga in Chile, as well as with the northern end of the Pica gap where no recent volcanism occurs in the volcanic arc. The basement of the volcano is formed by the ignimbritic Altos de Pica formation, although outcrops of granite have been observed in the region; one of these outcrops may be a Precambrian granite subsequently thermally modified in the Toarcian. This basement is covered by younger volcanic rocks, alluvium and sediments of the Salar de Coipasa. Seismic tomography suggests that molten magma exists in the regional crust. = Composition = Tata Sabaya has produced \\"two-pyroxene\\" andesite and porphyritic andesite. Minerals contained within the rock are augite, biotite, hornblende, hypersthene, plagioclase and titanomagnetite with only little variation between rocks erupted during separate stages of volcanic activity. The erupted volcanites define a potassium-rich calc-alkaline suite. Inclusions of more mafic rocks in the erupted material may indicate that mafic magma was injected into the magma chamber of Tata Sabaya. The magma genesis at Tata Sabaya has been explained with magma mixing processes, which gave rise to a fairly uniform composition of the eruption products.  Climate and vegetation  The region is dry with precipitation mainly falling during southern hemisphere summer, and has little vegetation cover. Polylepis tarapacana trees grow on the slopes of Tata Sabaya; these trees form the highest woodlands in the world. Other aspects of regional vegetation are the so-called puna steppe, which is characterized by grass and shrub vegetation.  Eruption history  Of all volcanoes in Bolivia, Tata Sabaya is the only one with Holocene activity which is not on the border with another country. The young age of the mountain has been inferred from the lack of glaciation and moraines on the mountain, unlike neighbouring summits. The earliest activity at Tata Sabaya constructed a pyroclastic shield, which crops out as a thick sequence of block-and-ash flows fallout deposits and pumice deposits in the northern sector of the volcano. Effusive eruptions then built up a volcanic cone on top of this shield; the five northerly lava flows were emplaced during this phase of activity. Some lava flows from this stage were unstable and collapsed, covering the northern parts of the volcano with debris. This effusive activity eventually oversteepened the cone, causing its southern sector to collapse. During this collapse and landsliding, large toreva blocks developed from sectors of the cone which slid down undeformed, while other material from the cone formed the hummocks in the sector collapse deposit; there was no explosive eruption at the time of the collapse. The configuration of the deposit indicates that the debris entered the Salar when it was filled with water; the height of the tufa deposits imply that water levels were about above sea level. This and the lake terraces that the landslide overran marks the collapse as synchronous with the Lake Tauca episode 12,000-12,360 years ago when water levels in the Salar de Coipasa reached their maximum. The onset of such collapses on volcanoes is often determined by faulting, climate change or eruption of the volcano; at Tata Sabaya earthquakes and the injection of new magma has been invoked to explain the destabilization of the edifice. After the collapse, Holocene activity filled the scar with lava domes and lava flows, cancelling the traces of the collapse; some of these in turn collapsed as well and gave rise to hot avalanche deposits. Radiocarbon dating for a pyroclastic flow has yielded an age of 6,000 years before present, implying that the volcano may be still active. Reportedly, when in 1600 Huaynaputina erupted in Peru a volcano named Sabaya erupted in Oruro and destroyed a village.

Biography Michelbecker was born in Marburg, the son of r√•ds-forvandt and hospital manager Erich Michelbecker and his wife Elisabeth V. Salzbudden. He trained as a cooper in Sankt Goar and Frankfurt am Main. Michelbecker came to Copenhagen in 1657 where he initially worked as a cellar man for wine merchant Johan Lehns and then as a clerk for wine merchant Johan Edinger. In 1661, Michelbecker established his own wine business with a large stock of wine which he had personally purchased in Amsterdam. His company grew steadily over the years and he was appointed royal cellar master in 1681. He was also engaged in import and export of other products and was by 1691 one of the largest merchants and ship owners in the city. Michelbecker's trading house was initially based in a smaller building on Frederiksholm. In 1687, he constructed a large property overlooking Frederiksholms Kanal which also contained residences that were let out. The building was regarded as \\"a benefit to the city\\" and he was rewarded with twenty years of freedom from taxes as well as significant trade privileges.

Sakai H≈çitsu (1761‚Äì1828) was a celebrated Japanese painter and an important member of the Rinpa schoolBridge of Dreams: the Mary Griggs Burke collection of Japanese art. (2000) p. 309., particularly famous for his by≈çbu screens and for reviving the style of Ogata K≈çrin, an earlier Rinpa master. One of his most celebrated works, Flowering Plants of Summer and Autumn consists of a pair of two-folded by≈çbu folding screens painted with ink and color on silver and gold-foiled paper, measuring 416.6 by 461.8 centimetres (164.0 in √ó 181.8 in) each. They are designated an Important Cultural Property of Japan. Flowering Plants of Summer and Autumn was originally painted on the back of K≈çrin's Wind God and Thunder God screens that belonged to H≈çitsu's family. The monumental two-sided by≈çbu screens became a symbol of the Rinpa tradition, but both sides of the screens have since been separated to protect them from damage. In the backside of K≈çrin's painting of Raijin, H≈çitsu painted what has been described as \\"summer plants revived by a sudden shower and the swollen flow of a river\\", and on the backside of K≈çrin's F≈´jin, \\"autumn plants swaying and the red leaves of ivy blown in a strong wind\\". The work is dated from the early 19th century, probably circa 1821, and the attribution to H≈çitsu has not been disputed. Both screens include the signature-seal \\"by H≈çitsu\\" and a round seal with red letters \\"Bunsen\\", another name used by H≈çitsu. H≈çitsu's style, which \\"aimed for the natural integration of poetic emotion and decorative technique\\", has been linked to \\"the elegant and refined taste common to poetry, which is another field of art he practiced\\". His use of tarashikomi \\"to paint plants and flowers with poetic feelings\\" has been highly praised. This technique, in which a second layer of paint is applied before the first layer is dry, was perfected by S≈çtatsu and used often by later Rinpa artists. The screens are now part of the collection of the Tokyo National Museum, where they are exhibited occasionally. The last time they were on display was from September 21 to October 30, 2016, in Room 8 of the Honkan (Japanese Gallery). Previously they were on display at the Tokyo National Museum in 2008, 2010 and 2013.

On 15 May 1710, King Jo√£o V of Portugal appointed him dean of the Royal Chapel, which had recently been built as a collegiate church of S√£o Tom√© on 1 March of that year. On 7 November 1716, the Royal Chapel became a patriarchal metropolitan See by the papal bull In supremo apostolatus and Jos√© Manuel became a member of the Col√©gio dos Principais, and as its rector, he presided over the Te Deum, in which for the first time all the dignities used habits of prelate.

It was presented by King Joseph I of Portugal to the patriarchal See of Lisbon, on 9 March 1754. Elected Patriarch of Lisbon on 20 May 1754, he received the canopy the same day. He took office on 2 June and was consecrated on 25 July in Lisbon by Cardinal Lucas Melchor Tempi, titular archbishop of Nicomedia, apostolic nuncio to Portugal, assisted by Jose Henriques, bishop of Constantine, and Hil√°rio of Santa Rosa, ex-bishop of Macau.

It was written as an intercessory hymn praying for the salvation of Muslims and calls for their conversion to Christianity. It had fallen out of use by around 1880.  History  Charles Wesley had a history of encouraging people to pray for the salvation of a variety of people. He wrote \\"Sun of Unclouded Righteousness\\" with the subtitle of \\"For the Turks\\" or \\"For the Mahometans\\". It was first published in 1758 in his Hymns of Intercession for All Mankind hymnal. It was intended as a prayer for salvation of Muslims and reflected the prevalent negative view of Islam promoted by Humphrey Prideaux in Great Britain at the time. It was written to also accompany the Collect for Good Friday in the Church of England's Book of Common Prayer. The hymn's title was based upon Malachi 4:2 where the Messiah, believed to be referring to Jesus by Christians, was called the \\"Sun of Righteousness\\". Charles and his brother John Wesley had read Prideaux's work on early Islam while in Paris, and John noted that no opponents of Christianity had hurt it as much as Muhammad during the Early Muslim conquests. The hymn refers to that conquest in the line, \\"The smoke of the infernal cave,/Which half the Christian world o‚Äôerspread\\"; the \\"cave\\" mentioned there is Hira, where Islam teaches that Mohammed received revelation. Muhammad is referred to in the hymn as \\"that Imposter\\" and \\"that Arab Thief\\". Later versions of the third verse were changed to \\"E'en now the Moslem fiend expel, And chase his doctrine back to hell\\". The hymn also engaged in polemics with regard to theological controversies of its day, namely the conflict between John Taylor's Unitarianism and Christians who held a trinitarian universalism perspective. The fourth stanza had always expressed the trinitarian universalism perspective; earlier versions of the third stanza ended with \\"The Unitarian fiend expel/And chase his doctrine back to hell\\" referring to Islam and its teaching, but also more explicitly to this controversy. The hymn was, in the words of a commenter on it, \\"an implicit challenge\\" to send missions to those regions.  Later disfavour  \\"Sun of Unclouded Righteousness\\" largely stopped being published in hymnals around 1875. However it was still published in the 1879 Methodist Hymnal. Despite Wesley's intent for it as a prayer for unbelievers, the hymn characterizes Islam negatively and expresses the stereotype of Arabs as, in the words of one commentator on the hymn, \\"militaristic marauders.\\"  Lyrics  The original lyrics as written by Wesley:  References  English Christian hymns 1758 in Great Britain 1758 works Christianity and Islam Hymns by Charles Wesley Criticism of Islam 18th-century hymns ","title":"Sun of Unclouded Righteousness"},{"id":"56521064","text":"Leiningerland is a Verbandsgemeinde (\\"collective municipality\\") in the district of Bad D√ºrkheim, in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany.

The episode received critical acclaim by critics and audiences alike and is widely regarded as one of the best episodes of the show. Plot In 1998, late at night after the Super Bowl, noises wake Jack, who discovers the house is on fire. He wakes Rebecca and calls out to Randall and Kate; Kevin is at Sophie's house. Jack retrieves the children from their bedrooms, using Kate's mattress as a heat shield. Kate, Randall, and Rebecca descend to the ground via a bedsheet rope. Kate's dog, Louie, barks; seeing Kate's desperation, Jack re-enters and emerges with Louie and some family mementos. Leaving Kate and Randall at Miguel's house, Rebecca takes Jack to the hospital for smoke inhalation. While Rebecca is away from the hospital room to handle logistics, Jack suffers a sudden, fatal \\"widow maker\\" heart attack. The doctor informs Rebecca, who goes into shock until seeing Jack's body. She tells Miguel, Kate, and Randall, then screams alone in the car; Kate finds and tells Kevin. In 2018, on the 20th anniversary of Jack's death, Kate cathartically watches the audition tape Jack recorded, which he saved from the fire; the VCR damages it, but Toby gets it repaired and uploaded to the cloud; Kate tells Toby he strengthens her, and Jack would have loved him. Kevin, who usually drinks away his pain on the anniversary, visits the tree where Jack's ashes were scattered; he acknowledges failing to fulfill Jack's legacy, but hopes to make him proud. Rebecca makes and eats Jack's favorite lasagna, and bonds with Kevin; she believes their reunion is a gift from Jack. Randall commemorates Jack with a Super Bowl party for his daughters and their friends. The family's new pet lizard dies suddenly; Randall's eulogy is overly intense and emotional. Tess tells Randall that she has deliberately left the phone off the hook to prevent social workers from calling, fearing Randall's interest in William, Deja, and his new job means he wants \\"a new life.\\" Randall tells Tess that her birth changed his life; he will always be devoted to her, and plans to have dinner with her every week, even when she's a working adult. Tess thinks the family's participation in fostering is \\"cool.\\" Deja calls from the house's front door; Randall and Beth bring her inside and comfort her, which Tess happily observes. Jordan, the boy shown previously in an Essex County social worker's office, is placed with a couple. An older Randall arrives to have dinner with the social worker, who is the adult Tess. Production The episode was written by series creator Dan Fogelman. The decision to air an episode of This Is Us after the Super Bowl was announced on May 14, 2017. Fogelman envisioned Jack's death as a consequence of the fire since the pilot script. He wanted the moment to take place towards the end of the second season and asked for the slot upon knowing NBC would air the Super Bowl. The fire sequence was filmed in December 2017 in Newhall Ranch, California. Actual footage from NBC's broadcast of Super Bowl LII, including scenes from the pre-game show and the game itself, were edited into scenes of the episode shortly prior to broadcast. Reception=Ratings= \\"Super Bowl Sunday\\" was originally broadcast on Sunday, February 4, 2018, in the United States on NBC. The episode was watched in the United States by a total of 26.97 million people.tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily- ratings/sunday-final-ratings-feb-4-2018/ It is the most-watched entertainment telecast since 2012 and the most-watched TV drama episode since 2008's House Super Bowl episode, which attracted 29 million viewers. =Critical response= The episode drew critical acclaim from critics, with Mandy Moore's acting receiving critical acclaim. It has a 87% approval rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 15 reviews with an average score of 8.54/10. The site's consensus reads, \\"Mandy Moore's performance proves to be a game changer in \\"Super Bowl Sunday,\\" eclipsing the episode's plot twists, aching dialogue, and even Jack's death\\". Kimberley Roots of TVLine deemed the installment \\"a good episode\\". Brian Lowry of CNN called the episode \\"emotional\\", explaining it had \\"strong individual moments for each of the key characters\\" and that it \\"managed to play with expectations\\". Caroline Siede of The A.V. Club praised Mandy Moore's performance as Rebecca, saying she has become the \\"MVP of season 2\\". She thought the fire sequence was \\"compelling, well-staged action\\". She appreciated that the series didn't \\"go too over-the- top\\" with Jack's death so as it doesn't become \\"emotional porn\\". To her, the present-day scenes served as introduction for new viewers, establishing the show's world, and the flash-forward was a surprise. Kelly lawler of USA Today wrote: \\"Although This Is Us is known for its big twists and fake-outs, at its core the show (like most) is about its characters. 'Super Bowl Sunday' succeeded by focusing on Kevin (Justin Hartley), Kate, Randall (Sterling K. Brown) and Rebecca (Mandy Moore) in the present and past. By not drawing out Jack's death even further, the episode managed to be more about the different ways Jack's family members experienced their grief, and not about tricking the audience. It was the right way for the often-frustrating mystery to end.\\" Conversely, Laura Prudom of IGN described the episode as \\"a cry-fest, to be sure, because this show is used to wringing our tear ducts dry with surgical precision, but there's no denying that the whole exercise also felt unashamedly manipulative, which is a trap This Is Us often falls into -- especially when it's trying to hide things from the audience to show us how clever it is. For viewers who tuned in for the first time after the big game [...], it probably made the regular This Is Us audience seem like complete masochists.\\" Time writer Daniel D'Addario gave a negative review disapproving the fact that Jack's death, though \\"movingly depicted\\", was used for entertainment purposes. \\"The sort of show This Is Us is in its strongest moments‚Äîone in which family members have frank and honest conversations about their hopes and fears‚Äîisn‚Äôt one that stages a ritual death on Super Bowl Sunday, after deploying cast members to brag about how it will make you cry.\\" ReferencesExternal links * 2018 American television episodes Super Bowl lead-out shows This Is Us ","title":"Super Bowl Sunday (This Is Us)"},{"id":"56521178","text":"Sarah, 90 years old, hears that she will have a child, and laughs at the idea. James Tissot, c. 1900 The Bible and humor is a topic of Biblical criticism concerned with the question of whether parts of the Bible were intended to convey humor in any style. Historically, this topic has not received much attention, but modern scholars generally agree that humor can be found in biblical texts. Scholarly assessment Finding humor in the Bible, for those who hold reverence toward the Bible, can be hindered by that seriousness, but it can be difficult for anyone to pick up on, because humor does not translate well from culture to culture or from language to language. It is also difficult to recognize humor in written form. The age of the texts makes it difficult to be sure that what we are interpreting as humor was intended as humor by the author. Finding humor in the Bible requires a broad eclectic definition of humor and some awareness of literary types of humor such as satire, farce, parody, irony and so on. Therefore, the vast majority of Bible interpreters over the last 1,500 years have not only not detected humor in the Bible, they have often discounted or even disdained the possibility of humor in the Bible. Professor Yehuda T. Radday notes that some scholars have flat out denied that humor in the Bible exists. He references a 1984 conference in Israel on the subject of Jewish humor, where no attention was given to humor in the Bible. Radday goes on to say \\"it is a widespread misconception that the Bible is lacking in humor.\\" Scholars like Steven C. Walker, a professor of literature, and Howard R. Macy, a professor of religion, claim humor is prevalent in the Bible. Macy says that \\"if we think that humor in the Bible mostly looks like stand-up comedy or telling jokes, we won't see much of that.\\" Anthony J. Perotta, priest and professor at Fuller Seminary, argues that: > ... humor as we know it today is probably not part of the Bible any more > than love (and marriage, etc.) as we know it today is a feature of the > Bible. But this is a minor point, maybe even trivial and pedantic. ... The > ancient Hebrews loved and married‚Äîand joked‚Äîno doubt, in a different idiom > than \\"we\\" do, but they still engaged in such activities and we can speak > about those activities without being anachronistic or solipsistic Professor of Jewish theology and Near Eastern studies Leonard Greenspoon says, \\"In sum, biblical humor is certainly not stand-up comedy nor is it especially cerebral either. Rather, it is participatory and fully in keeping with the overall themes and emphases of the Hebrew Bible.\\" Author David A. Peters states that he finds over a thousand \\"humorous lines and stories\\" in the Bible. There is general agreement that the kind of humor that can be found in the Bible becomes apparent when the Bible is viewed as literature. Rev. Marion Daniel Shutter asserts we would find genuine wit if, in literature other than the Bible, we came across sentences such as that found in Proverbs 26:17: Interfering in someone else's argument is as foolish as yanking a dog's ears. He says, \\"When Isaiah characterizes certain ones as 'mighty to drink wine and men of strength to mingle strong drink,' does he not use essentially the same reproach Prince Hal fastened upon Falstaff, 'Wherin is he good but to taste sack and drink it?\\" Macy says the Bible authors use dark humor, satire, a great deal of wit, and are particularly fond of the dry humor that goes with exaggeration. Walker adds, \\"The humor of the Bible is deadpan. It sneaks up on you.\\" When discussing biblical humor scholars generally agree humor is often in the situation itself. Macy gives the examples of Sarah having Isaac at the age of ninety, and the Messiah turning up in a barn. Macy says \\"The Bible gives us tale after tale of comic reversals and narrow escapes.\\" He says \\"mischievous exploits\\", names and name changes, literary plays on words, exaggeration, and the unexpected: a surprising word, an unexpected phrase, or an abrupt change of direction are what the Bible uses to convey wit and humor. According to Macy, the Book of Proverbs includes funny images and word-play while \\"trickster themes also bring surprise and laughter.\\" Professor of Biblical Literature J. William Whedbee says the biblical authors use \\"humorous juxtaposition\\" where things seem funny because they're together: for example, short and tall, fat and thin, irony and paradox. Those scholars who do find humor in the Bible agree the odd, awkward, or absurd such as mismatches in character and actions, are examples of how the Bible uses humor. \\"Balaam the 'seer' who doesn't 'see' or 'know' what's going on, and his donkey who both sees and knows,\\" is an example of this type of wit and humor in the Bible. Hebrew Bible (Old Testament)=Genesis= Macy, Walker, M. D. Shutter, and other scholars contend that the Book of Genesis has several stories that offer humor through absurdity, trickery, surprises and reversals. Macy says that in speaking of humor in the Bible, he usually begins with asking how it might feel to personally get the message Abraham and Sarah received, putting them into the absurd situation of a ninety year old having a baby. He argues that the Biblical author shows that the situation is replete with humor: \\"Abraham laughs, Sarah laughs, everybody else laughs, and they name the baby 'laughter' or He-laughs [Isaac Yitzack].\\" Humor in Genesis, Macy says, includes \\"Both Abraham and Isaac trying to pass off their wives as their sisters, [however] translations of Genesis 26:8 range from [Isaac and his 'sister'] \\"laughing together\\" to \\"caressing\\" or \\"fondling\\" to \\"making love\\" giving evidence of Isaac's 'savvy' in pulling off the lie. Jacob and Laban make deals with each other that make a reader cringe. In Genesis 18, the topic is serious but bargaining with God looks a lot like buying a used car.\\" Walker says Genesis contains several \\"odd couples\\" that contrast and complement each other like 'Laurel and Hardy': Jacob and Esau, Abraham and Sarah, Abraham and Lot, Jacob and Laban, and others. He adds, \\"Bible characters learn a lot about their own 'dark sides' by those contrasts.\\" The pattern of reversal of fundamental motifs such as primogeniture are evidence of humor according to Walker. He references 12 incidents in Genesis of younger sons getting the better of their elder brothers. Greenspoon offers Genesis 4 as an example of Biblical humor using ironic wordplay with names. After murdering his brother and attempting to shift the blame, Cain is condemned to wander ceaselessly, but after complaining God agrees to let him settle in the land of Nod. Greenspoon says, \\"The root of the Hebrew verb 'to wander' is n-w-d and \\"the proper name 'Nod' derives from the same root as the verb 'to wander'... What sort of settling is Cain likely to experience in a land whose very name connotes (constant) wandering?\\" =Exodus= Greenspoon says Aaron's response to getting caught after making the golden calf is humorous. \\"Does Aaron come clean when confronted by his enraged brother...? Not exactly. He does attempt to shift blame‚Äî\\"You know this people is bent on evil\\". He also admits to asking the people for their gold, at the same time notably truncating the scope of his original request... Even though the biblical text had earlier narrated in some detail the active role he took ... [he says]: 'They gave it to me', Aaron concludes, 'and I hurled it into the fire and out came this calf'.\\" =Numbers= Balaam and the Ass, Rembrandt 1626 Anthony J. Perrota and others find plenty of humor in the story of Balaam and his talking donkey in the Book of Numbers. Balaam is repeatedly asked by king Balak to curse the Israelites, but Balaam can only bless them, making the king increasingly angry. Petrotta explains that humor exposes the pretensions of a culture, and that Balaak is certainly drawn as a caricature of a monarch. The story is set up in terms of threes‚Äî\\"three people, three incidents, etc.‚Äîthat is required for many types of jokes: \\"A prophet, a priest and a prostitute die on the same day and came before St.Peter...where the third element breaks the pattern\\" and provides the joke. \\"Balaam is risible; Balak is pitiful. ... Their ridiculous stance is increasingly absurd with each stupidly unresponsive reaction. ... We laugh at Balaam for not seeing, but all the time the Israelites have not seen either, both what God has done above, or the consequences of what they are doing below.\\" =Judges= Shutter finds humor in the Fable of the Trees (Judges 9). Abimelech maneuvered to have himself proclaimed king in Shechem, but Jotham believed he was unfit to rule and the people foolish to accept him. Jotham contrives a satire. \\"The trees went forth to anoint a king over them. They said to the olive tree, 'reign over us.' But the olive tree answered, ‚ÄòShould I give up my oil, by which both gods and humans are honored, to hold sway over the trees?‚Äô Next, the trees said to the fig tree, ‚ÄòCome and be our king.‚Äô But the fig tree replied, ‚ÄòShould I give up my fruit, so good and sweet, to hold sway over the trees?‚Äô Then the trees said to the vine, ‚ÄòCome and be our king.‚Äô But the vine answered, 'Should I give up my wine, which cheers both gods and humans, to hold sway over the trees?' Finally all the trees said to the thornbush, 'Come and be our king'. The thornbush said to the trees, 'If you really want to anoint me king over you, come and take refuge in my shade; but if not, then let fire come out of the thornbush and consume the cedars of Lebanon!'\\" Then Jotham left \\"for in that day, as in every subsequent age, there was no room for a satirist in the kingdom of an incompetent ruler\\". Shutter also asserts that Samson is a humorous character, very similar to Ajax in Sophocles' play Ajax. Quoting Rev. A. G. L'Estrange in his History of English humor..., Shutter says: \\"He was an exaggeration of a not very uncommon type of man in which brute strength is joined to loose morals and whimsical fancy... We can only smile at his folly.\\" Greenspoon finds humor in the word play of the names and characteristics of two protagonists found in the account of the murder of the King of Moab in the second half of Judges 3. One of these characters is Ehud, a \\"left-handed man\\" from the tribe of Benjamin (Judg 3:15). \\"Such a description serves two functions here: first, as a play on words-‚ÄîEhud's tribe, Benjamin, literally means the son of the south, or right. (Ancient Israelites oriented themselves with the Mediterranean Sea behind them and East was straight ahead; so, the south was to their right.) Thus, it would not escape the notice of the reader that here was a \\"son of the south\\" or \\"the right hand\\" who was left-handed... Second, because Ehud was left-handed, he strapped his sword to his right thigh... the Moabite king's bodyguards, who would certainly have checked out anyone seeking admittance to their monarch, performed only a perfunctory check on Ehud, never thinking that the weapon would be on his right, rather than the expected left, thigh. It is especially the name of the Moabite king, Eglon, that would have immediately attracted the attention of an ancient reader ... Eglon comes from the same Hebrew root as the word for a fatted calf, often one prepared for sacrifice. And, of course, sacrifice is exactly what Eglon becomes at the hand of Ehud... biblical writers seemed to draw upon just such incidents to display what might be termed the wicked side of their humor.\\" =1 Samuel= Abigail soothes David, who is angry at her husband Nabal. Giustino Menescardi, mid-18th century According to Shutter, Nabal, a rich man who insults David, is a dark comic character similar to Squire Western in the classic comedy Tom Jones by Henry Fielding. \\"He is churlish and evil... blunt in speech, rude, and even boorish in manners... The servants of Nabal say, \\"He is such a son of Belial [a devil] that a man cannot speak to him!' He is fond of wine and sometimes falls asleep over his cups.\\" In this same story Greenspoon finds humor in names and wordplay. The root of Nabal's name‚Äî\\"n-b-l\\"‚Äî(and the word \\"fool\\") appears as two nouns one of which appears in the expression for \\"wine skin\\"; Nabal is a drunk. \\"The second noun from 'n-b-l' is a feminine form ending with the Hebrew letter he. With the vocalization (that is, vowels) I am thinking of, the word means carcass or corpse. Surely, Nabal was a 'dead man' when he crossed David as he did. The same consonants also make up a noun meaning 'foolishness', the very noun that Abigail used to describe her husband in her plea to David. Reading back then, we can sense a double play on words, as it were, by the narrator of this account\\". Walker says, \\"The Bible reads like a rogue's gallery of unlikely heroes... Gideon the coward, Samson the bully, David the trickster\\". He gives the example of the powerful and popular warrior David fleeing Saul's murderous jealousy by going to Achish king of Gath, then deciding he'd made a mistake, and coping with that by faking insanity. Macy says this entire scene with David is humorous, but King Achish's response is the epitome of Biblical sarcasm: \\"Am I so short on insane people in my own kingdom you bring me more from other places?\\" David fools Achish--then later goes to work for him. Walker says this demonstrates \\"David's trickster aspect is an equal-employment jester, 'laughable for how it succeeds in duping others and how it recoils to dupe the mischiefmaker\\". =1 Kings= Religion Professor and Presbyterian minister Conrad Hyers finds humor in Elijah's ridicule of \\"the priests of Baal who wailed and slashed themselves in the hope that Baal would send fire from Heaven. \\"Shout louder!...Perhaps he is deep in thought, or busy, or traveling; or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened!\\" (1 Kings 18) =Proverbs= All scholars who find humor in the Bible agree it can be found in the book of Proverbs. Shutter gives numerous example such as: \\"A man of great anger will bear the penalty, for if you rescue him, you will only have to do it again\\". In other words, a man of violent temper is always getting into difficulties; you have no sooner helped him out of one than he has plunged madly into another. Like the irascible person in the old nursery rhyme, who \\"jumped into a bramble bush and scratched out both his eyes\\", he is no sooner extricated than \\"with all his might and main, he jumps into another bush and puts them out again.\\" Shutter also says humor is often used to communicate morality claiming \\"Can a man take fire in his bosom And his clothes not be burned?\\" is a sarcastic question about adultery. Shutter includes \\"Wealth makes many \\"friends\\"; poverty drives them all away\\" and \\"Many curry favor with a ruler, and everyone is the friend of one who gives gifts\\" as social satire. \\"All the brothers of a poor man hate him; How much more do his friends abandon him! He pursues them with words, but they are gone.\\" Shutter references this Proverb as humor by citing a comparison with the satiricist William Makepeace Thackeray: \\"Thackeray has drawn such a picture in his more elaborate description of Harry Warrington in the sponging house, making vain appeals for help to his rich relatives and friends. His Aunt, a member of the great and always established Church of the Pharisees, sent him her blessing--and a tract!\\" =Ecclesiastes= Shutter says biting Biblical humor often gives insight into human nature: \\"All people spend their lives scratching for food, but they never seem to have enough.\\" =Jeremiah= Ridicule and political commentary have gone hand in hand for many centuries. According to Shutter, when Jeremiah describes the disaster that fell on Egypt's allies, the comments that follow to the King of Egypt drip with scorn: \\"Pharaoh, King of Egypt, is but a noise. He hath let the appointed time pass by.\\" \\"In the same spirit, Queen Catherine says of the dead Wolsey, \\"His promise was as he then was, mighty; but his performance is as he is now, nothing.\\" =Jonah= Walker explains that \\"A crucial function of humor in the Bible is to persuade the self-righteous to laugh at themselves--a process that proves especially enlightening when the self-righteous turn out to be us. Jonah sasses God. Heathen Ninevites and scurrilous sailors prove more pious than the prophet [Jonah], who is subjected unceremoniously to his comeuppance.\\" Shutter points out that Jonah pouts when the Ninevites repent and are not destroyed; he yells at God, 'didn't I know this would happen?' without recognizing the irony in his own comments which is itself ironic. Shutter compares this to the character Mr. Mantalini in Charles Dickens' Nicholas Nickleby. =Esther= Leonard Greenspoon says \\"Like Jonah, the Book of Esther is filled with a number of plots and subplots, the humor of which is not always immediately evident.\\" The proud Haman is unaware of his comic nature, but the reader knows the very real irony that \\"everything Haman plans against his enemies will ultimately be done to him\\". Walker finds humor in the comic reversal in Esther. The king asks one night, \\"What should be done for a man whom the king desires to honor?\\" (6:6). Haman assumes the king means Haman himself and answers in vivid detail. He is then required to give it all to his worst enemy. Walker also points out the pivotal role in the book of Esther is built around a female, which is a situation filled with cultural commentary and irony. Walker says, \\"The wit of Esther, by turning our usual expectations upside down, reminds us to expect the unexpected.\\" He says \\"I second Adele Berlin's ranking of Esther high among the most humorous books of the Bible, amusing throughout, and at certain points uproriously funny. People who have looked closely find the book so funny Esther emerges as perhaps the clearest embodiment of the comic vision among all the Biblical narratives.\\" Walker and Macy both cite the careful attention to words and wordplays in this book, while Walker also includes Esther in what he calls \\"genial gender humor\\" where, he says, women often prove to be \\"more dynamic characters\\" than their male counterparts and always seem to get the \\"last scriptural word\\". Greenspoon explains \\"the wisdom and/or bravery exhibited by women and other \\"outsiders\\" is often expressed or acted out at the expense of those who appear to wield the most power. This is in keeping with the frequently articulated theme of biblical humor that demonstrates and reflects God's infinite ability to disrupt the plans of finite humans, especially the seemingly powerful.\\" =Daniel= Greenspoon notes humorous wordplay in the tale of Susanna, included in the Old Testament of the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches. The words of Daniel's judgement is related to details in the false witness of Susanna's accusers. New Testament Hyers says \\"Paul had an unusual way of selling the gospel. His techniques have not been widely followed... Nor has he been hailed as a pioneer in the world of advertising. [Paul's] term for the Christian faith is foolishness. The cross is foolishness. Preaching is foolishness. Christians are called to be fools for Christ's sake. The Apostles are ridiculed as fools, \\"a spectacle to the world, to angels and to men\\" (1 Cor.4:9).\\" Hyers says themes of divine foolishness overturning human wisdom form the plot lines of many Bible stories and such reversals are familiar in comedy as well. Macy says, \\"In his letters Paul reveals a robust sense of humor... He teases to teach, uses grand exaggeration, enjoys parody and reversal, and even creates vivid comic [word] pictures.\\" For example in 2 Corinthians 11, Paul uses a biting sarcasm to give what has been termed his \\"anti-autobiography\\" while calling himself a fool. In the Acts of the Apostles, a young man called Eutychus listens to Paul, falls asleep and then falls out of a window and dies. This story may be a comment on Paul's long-windedness. Hyers says \\"Jesus freely used humor, irony and satire\\" and offers the examples of \\"the blind leading the blind; straining out a gnat, then swallowing a camel; meticulously cleaning the outside of a cup while leaving the inside filthy; maintaining whitewashed tombs that are outwardly beautiful but inwardly full of dead men's bones; loudly honoring past prophets while plotting to kill present ones who preach the same message.\\" These are examples of what Whedbee describes as \\"Jesus as the cynic sage.\\" Comedian Eric Idle opines that Jesus is \\"not particularly funny, what he's saying isn't mockable, it's very decent stuff...\\" Biblical scholar F. F. Bruce finds the story of Rhoda in Acts 12:12‚Äì15 \\"full of vivid humour\\". When Rhoda hears the voice of Peter, miraculously released from prison, she becomes so happy that she forgets to open the door and let him in. The Bible as material Charlie Chaplin quotes the Gospel of Luke in The Great Dictator (1940) The Bible has inspired a multitude of art and fiction in many categories, including humor and comedy. William Shakespeare's comedy The Merchant of Venice includes elements from the Book of Daniel. Biblical references can be seen in films with Charlie Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy. Modern examples include Monty Python's Life of Brian, Mel Brooks History of the World, Part I and sketches by Rowan Atkinson.

It stars Tye Sheridan, Ana de Armas, John Leguizamo and Helen Hunt, and follows a hotel night clerk who becomes the center of a murder investigation. The film was released on February 21, 2020, by Saban Films. On June 6, 2020, Netflix released the film on its platform. Plot Bart Bromley lives with his mom and has Asperger's syndrome. He places hidden cameras in a room at the hotel where he works as a night desk clerk, and uses the live feeds and recordings to overcome his social awkwardness by imitating the speech and mannerisms of the guests. On his nightly shift, Bart watches Karen, who has recently checked in. After his shift, he buys ice cream, goes home, and continues to watch Karen. Bart sees Karen let an unknown man into her room. After they argue, the man begins to beat her. Bart watches as a gun falls from Karen's purse, then drives to the hotel to try to rescue her. He enters via a side door, and soon afterwards Bart's co-worker Jack hears a gunshot. Jack enters Karen‚Äôs room, where he finds Karen dead and Bart sitting on the bed. While Jack calls 911, Bart removes the hidden cameras, but accidentally leaves a storage card behind. The next day, Bart is questioned by Detective Espada and claims he went home after buying ice cream, then returned to the hotel because he forgot his wallet. Espada realizes Bart is lying because if he did not have his wallet, he would not have been able to buy ice cream. Bart later re-watches the recording of Karen‚Äôs room and sees that the man she met had a tattoo of a bird on his arm. The next day, Bart's boss reassigns him to a new hotel. On his first shift, he meets Andrea Rivera, who recognizes that he has Asperger's, flirts with him, and checks into a room. The next day, Bart finds that he is missing a storage card, which Espada finds. Bart places cameras in Andrea's room and later shares a kiss with her near the hotel's pool. The following day, Bart gets a haircut and buys a new suit, car, and cologne. He tries to visit Andrea at the hotel, only to find her having sex with the unknown man from Karen's room, whom he recognizes from the tattoo. Bart returns home and finds police have taken all his computer and camera equipment. He tells Espada his hard drives are empty because he deleted all the recordings before police arrived. After Espada leaves, Bart retrieves a hidden hard drive which contains a copy of the recording from Karen's room. The unknown man Bart saw with Andrea is Karen‚Äôs husband Nick, a detective who has been having an affair with Andrea and wants her to kill Bart so he cannot identify Nick to police. As Bart watches the cameras in Andrea's room, he sees Nick argue with her and start to beat her. He rushes to the hotel and enters Andrea's room as Nick leaves, then shows Andrea the hidden cameras. At his house, he shows her the recording from Karen's room and Andrea sees that Nick killed Karen. Andrea begins to cry and goes to sleep in Bart‚Äôs bed. He lies down with her and falls asleep. The following morning, Bart finds that Andrea is gone, as is the hard drive on which he had the copy of the recording from Karen's room. He also finds that Andrea has left the gun from Karen's purse on his bed. Andrea gives Nick the hard drive with the recording of Karen's room and they start to drive out of town. The police arrive at Bart's house and find that Bart is not there, but has left the gun and the camera storage cards along with a note for Espada. Nick and Andrea are pulled over and arrested. Bart walks through a local mall and practices the conversational speech and body language he has observed in his recordings.

Early life  Ceppos was born in Washington, DC and grew up in Silver Spring, Maryland. He attended Northwood High School where he edited The Red and Black school newspaper. At the University of Maryland he edited The Diamondback and graduated in 1969 with a BA in Journalism. He joined SDX, now the Society of Professional Journalists, and was inducted into Omicron Delta Kappa, men's leadership society.  Career = Gannett = Ceppos's first full-time professional position was at the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, where he was Reporter, Assistant City Editor, and Night City Editor between 1969 and 1972. = Knight-Ridder = In 1972 he moved to the Miami Herald where he was Assistant City Editor, their first National Foreign Editor, and Assistant Managing Editor for News before moving to the San Jose Mercury News in 1981. There he was Associate Editor, Managing Editor, Senior Vice President and Executive Editor. While Managing Editor, the newspaper won two Pulitzer Prizes. He also initiated a Vietnamese edition Viet Mercury and a Spanish edition Nuevo Mundo. He supported digital initiatives at a print journalism company and successfully championed diversity hiring. In 1999 he became vice president for News of Knight-Ridder, then the second largest newspaper chain in the United States. He left the position in 2005. = University of Nevada - Reno = From 2008 to 2011, he was Dean and Professor at the Reynolds School in Journalism at the University of Nevada-Reno, holding the Fred W. Smith Chair in Journalism. As incoming Dean, he commissioned a large banner with the words of the First Amendment to hang in the school. He continued his professional goals by increasing diversity hiring and changing the curriculum to require cross-platform training for all students. = Louisiana State University = In July, 2011 he became Dean and William B. Dickinson Distinguished Professor at the Manship School of Mass Communication at Louisiana State University. He repeated his display of the First Amendment and moved the curriculum toward online media. He taught media ethics. He stepped down as Dean at the end of the 2017‚Äì2018 academic year. He continues to teach \\"Media Writing,\\" \\"Media Management,\\" and \\"Media Ethics and Social Responsibility.\\" = Other work = Ceppos was Consultant with Leading Edge Associates, a management consulting firm in San Jose from 2006 to 2009. In 2007 he was Fellow in media ethics at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University.  Controversies = Dark alliance = Gary Webb was a reporter for The Mercury News. Hired in 1987, his year-long investigation of cocaine dealing in Los Angeles was published in The Mercury News in three parts, from August 18‚Äì20, 1996 as \\"Dark Alliance.\\" Jerry Ceppos was Executive Editor of the newspaper. Plaudits for the story were followed by criticism from major media outlets such as the New York Times, Washington Post, and Los Angeles Tmes. After initially defending the story, Ceppos commissioned an internal review. At the end of March 1997, Ceppos told Webb that he was going to present the internal review findings in a column. After discussions with Webb, the column was published on May 11, 1997. Ceppos took personal responsibility for the series and its flaws in his opening sentence, \\"Few things in life are harder than owning up to one's shortcomings, but I need to tell you about an important case in which I believe that we fell short of my standards for the Mercury News.\\" In the column Ceppos continued to defend parts of the article, writing that the series had \\"solidly documented\\" that the drug ring described in the series did have connections with the Contras and did sell large quantities of cocaine in inner-city Los Angeles. But, Ceppos wrote, the series \\"did not meet our standards\\" in four areas. 1) It presented only one interpretation of conflicting evidence and in one case \\"did not include information that contradicted a central assertion of the series.\\" 2) The series' estimates of the money involved was presented as fact instead of an estimate. 3) The series oversimplified how the crack epidemic grew. 4) The series \\"created impressions that were open to misinterpretation\\" through \\"imprecise language and graphics.\\" Ceppos noted that Webb did not agree with these conclusions. He concluded: \\"How did these shortcomings occur? ... I believe that we fell short at every step of our process: in the writing, editing and production of our work. Several people here share that burden ... But ultimately, the responsibility was, and is, mine.\\" [See \\"Dark Alliance\\" in CIA involvement in Contra cocaine trafficking] Ceppos's mea culpa won praise in the journalism profession. He was awarded, along with two others, the first Ethics in Journalism award from the Society of Professional Journalists for \\"superior ethical conduct.\\" Critics largely outside the profession suggested he had caved to outside pressure, including that of the government and its agencies. The 2014 film Kill the Messenger was based upon the controversy. Canadian-born American actor Oliver Platt played Jerry Ceppos. Opinions about the movie paralleled those about the original story. Additionally, there was controversy as to whether Ceppos had been contacted or not regarding the factual aspects of the movie. Gary Webb collaborated with Jeremy Renner to write the screenplay, based on his book Dark Alliance. Gary Webb Webb was found dead in his Carmichael home on December 10, 2004, with two gunshot wounds to the head. His death was ruled a suicide by the Sacramento County coroner's office. = Pre-publication review = In August 1998 a financial story by Chris Schmitt was shared in its entirety with NASDAQ for fact-checking prior to publication. Changes were made prior to publication.

He is the current editor-in-chief of the German Middle East quarterly magazine zenith and director-general of the Candid Foundation.  Career  Gerlach studied history and Middle Eastern studies. He holds a licence degree from the University of Paris IV Sorbonne and an M.A. from the University of Hamburg. In 1999 Gerlach co-founded and co-directed zenith Magazine. In 2012 he assumed the position of the magazine's editor in chief. Previously, he wrote as a freelance journalist for daily newspapers such as Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and Die Welt and worked as a documentary filmmaker for national German television ZDF, mainly focusing on history and present of the Arab world. In 2014 he co-founded Candid Foundation, a privately chartered, independent think tank which devotes itself to international and intercultural cooperation and implements media and technology driven projects with countries of the Mediterranean, Middle East, West Asia and the Caucasus. Among his co-founders were the political scientist Asiem El Difraoui, social entrepreneur Belabbes Benkredda, and the photographer and documentary film director Marcel Mettelsiefen. Gerlach is a frequent guest expert with German and international news broadcasters where he comments on Syria, Iraq, the Arab world and European-Arab relations. He has spoken at international universities such as King's College, Yale, and Princeton, and think tanks and governmental institutions such as the European External Action Service. In 2016 Gerlach gave the eulogy for the Syrian-French poet Adunis, laureate of the Erich Maria Remarque Peace Prize of the city of Osnabr√ºck. The prize had stirred controversy from Syrian opposition members who accused Adunis of not having condemned the Syrian government unequivocally for its repressive demeanour. In 2017 German and international media reported that Gerlach's name had appeared on a travel ban list of Syrian state security. According to German news anchor Claus Kleber, Gerlach is a \\"leading expert\\" on the Middle East in Germany.https://www.zdf.de/nachrichten/heute- journal/heute-journal-clip-4-2758.html Gerlach is a frequent contributor to German language media oulets, including Deutsche Welle, Deutschlandfunk, Welt, ZDF, Tagesschau, Der Spiegel Die Tageszeitung, Tagesspiegel, Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung, Luzerner Zeitung, and SRF. Gerlach has also featured in several international publications, including The New York Times.  Positions  In his book about the Syrian government and the sectarian element of the armed conflict, Gerlach makes reference to the method of French sociologist Michel Seurat. He argues that the essential core of Syrian government was not simply a group of people around the Assad family, but a distinct logic of thinking and behaviour, an ideology described as implicitly sectarian. In 2014, Gerlach suggested that an international diplomatic initiative of Western countries should engage Russia and oblige it to assume the role of a protective force for parts of Syria in order to untangle the interests of international stakeholders and to prevent unilateral action. In an article published simultaneously in English, German, and Russian in 2017, Gerlach suggested that Saudi Arabia, a regional power that officially supported armed insurgents in Syria, had secretly endorsed or even \\"encouraged\\" the 2015 Russian military intervention in support of the Syrian regime. This analysis was corroborated in 2020 by news media reports stating that Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman had secretly enouraged Russia to intervene and, in this way, \\"angered\\" CIA director John Brennan. With regard to the so-called Islamic State, its strategy of displaying acts of extreme violence, Gerlach argues that there was nothing intrinsically ‚ÄúIslamic‚Äù about it. He suggests to also study analogies with Latin American drug cartels. In an article co-authored with Naseef Naeem, a Syrian-born associate professor of state and constitutional law, both reject the use of the terms ‚Äústate‚Äù or ‚Äústate building‚Äù project by media and academics on IS. They argue that the organisation's project lacked key elements of statehood and, instead, suggest to call it a warfaring occupying force with an ‚Äúimperial‚Äù ideology. In an article about the ideologicy of resistance and the operational features of shia militias and the Iraqi Hashd al-Shaabi Gerlach criticises the attribution of ‚Äújihadist‚Äù and, as opposed to groups like Al-Qaida or the Islamic State, suggests to qualify them as ‚Äúmuqawamist‚Äù instead (from the Arabic muqawama for ‚Äúresistance‚Äù). In a contribution for the Washington Institute for Near East Policy about the war for Syria and the escalation of violence in Idlib in 2019, Gerlach argued that sectarianism and prejudice against elements of the population were fueling certain war tactics and that, therefore, community leaders in Syria were an often-overlooked stakeholder in shaping the country's future and in mitigating against the sectarian divide.

The club are affiliated to the Amateur Football Alliance and are currently members of the . The club was formed through the merger of Crouch End F.C. and Vampires F.C. in 1897. Early history Founded as Balmoral Football Club, Crouch End were invited to join a proposed Southern Football League in 1891 but rejected the offer. The idea was subsequently dropped after Arsenal joined the Football League. On 3 October 1891, Crouch End played their first game of FA Cup competition. After beating Ashford United 6‚Äì2, their 1891‚Äì92 campaign ended in a 0‚Äì4 loss to Chatham in the second qualifying round. Both Crouch End and the Vampires featured in the first ever season of the London League in 1896‚Äì97, finishing fifth and sixth respectively. In the Vampires' first ever London League game on 19 September 1896 they lost to Thames Ironworks 0‚Äì3. In 1897, Crouch End merged with the Vampires, who were based in Norbury, and were renamed Crouch End Vampires. On 6 October 1900, the club beat London Welsh 3‚Äì0 in the first qualifying round of the 1900‚Äì01 FA Cup, but failed to beat Civil Service in the next round. The following year, 1901‚Äì02, they played London Welsh again, running out as 0‚Äì1 winners in the preliminary round. They beat Fulham 4‚Äì2 in the first qualifying round, and overcame Willesden Town 3‚Äì1 in the second. They fell to Queens Park Rangers in the third qualifying round 2‚Äì0 on 2 November 1901. In the 1902‚Äì03 FA Cup, they beat West Hampstead 6‚Äì1 in the first qualifying round, but failed to beat Fulham in the second. Olympic gold medal-winner Richard Turner played for the team, as did his brother, Alf Turner, who also played for Watford and later turned out for Nottingham Forest. Steadfast proponents of the amateur game, the club were affiliated to the Amateur Football Defence Council (the forerunner of the Amateur Football Alliance). In September 1906, the club was a signatory when the AFDC warned the London FA that its affiliated clubs would be boycotting the London Senior Cup the following season. The following year, the organisation (then known as the Amateur Football Defence Federation) was reformed as the Amateur Football Association and they affiliated. They were also founding members of the Southern Amateur League the same year. Recent times The club are one of three founding AFA members that are still affiliated, the others being Alleyn Old Boys and Civil Service. They currently compete in the Senior Division 2 of the Southern Amateur League. The club participate in an annual Easter Tournament hosted by KFC Rood-Wit, an amateur club in Antwerp, Belgium. Former Tottenham Hotspur and Queens Park Rangers player Dave McEwen began his career at the club.

It is the band's first album via Universal Music Brazil, the first without vocalist, guitarist and founding member Paulo Miklos (who quit the group in 2016) and the first with his session replacement Beto Lee, son of Brazilian rock singer Rita Lee, who guest performs on the album with narrations. The album is a rock opera with a story written by the band and co-written by Hugo Possolo and Marcelo Rubens Paiva. The plot follows three undergraduate female students raped by five colleagues and the consequences brought upon all of them by the crime. The album release was preceded by an homonymous theater, cinema and music spectacle that was later recorded and released in DVD. A tour is expected to promote the album all around Brazil in 2019.  Background  On July 11, 2016, vocalist, guitarist and founding member Paulo Miklos announced he would leave the band to focus on his personal projects. He was then replaced by session member Beto Lee, son of notorious Brazilian rock singer Rita Lee. With Lee's inclusion, the band recovered some old songs for its live setlists, including Titanomaquia's \\"Ser√° Que √â Disso Que Eu Necessito?\\" and \\"Nem Sempre se Pode Ser Deus\\". They also started to have guitarist Tony Bellotto sing in some songs. Also in 2016, the band announced a new album for a possible 2017 release. According to Bellotto, it would be a rock opera, and the band intended to enter the studio until mid-2017 so the album could be released in the year's second half. Drawing inspiration from albums such as The Who's Quadrophenia and Green Day's American Idiot, it was expected to have over 30 tracks. Tommy (also by The Who), Pink Floyd's The Wall and Canadian band The Kings have also been mentioned as influences. The rock opera had its story written with help from Hugo Possolo and Marcelo Rubens Paiva. By April 2017, vocalist and bassist Branco Mello said a handful of tracks were ready. Also in April, the band started a tour called \\"Uma Noite no Teatro\\" (A Night at the Theater). The tour included three new songs: \\"Me Estuprem\\" (Rape Me), about sexual harassment and rape; \\"12 Flores Amarelas\\" (12 Yellow Flowers); and \\"A Festa\\" (The Party). By that time, none of them were expected to be on the album. On 23 September, however, the band performed them again during their show at the Rock in Rio 7, and this time they were announced as part of the new project. In December 2017, they announced that they had already started recording the album and that it would be released via Universal Music Brazil. On January 31, they announced its title and that it would be released in early 2018. In April, the final track listing of the album had 25 songs. The album was partially funded by Universidade Est√°cio de S√°, via the Rouanet Law, and the whole project took two and a half years to be finished. In interviews, the band members said that the idea to create a rock opera was born out of the wish to do something different from what they were doing until then.  Release and promotion  The album was released throughout three weeks, one act at a time. The first release was expected for 14 April, but was pushed back to 27 of the same month. = Controversy = Tit√£s promoted the album as the first rock opera by a Brazilian band, but such information is contested. Musical producer Pedro Eleftheriou states that, in the end of the eighties, the group III Mil√™nio (now disbanded and at that time known as Ano Luz) released a rock opera called Alian√ßa dos Tempos (Alliance of the Times). In response to such questioning, Tit√£s stated: Other albums by Brazilian artists released before Doze Flores Amarelas are also considered rock operas, such as O Filho de Jos√© e Maria (1977), by Odair Jos√©; Bigorna (2002), by Cartoon; and The Man Who Died Everyday (2013), by Dusty Old Fingers. = Spectacle = Doze Flores Amarelas was presented live in a spectacle event that mixed elements of theater, music and cinema and was directed by Possolo and Ot√°vio Juliano. Rita Lee narrates the story, connecting the tracks. According to Mello, Possolo brought the theater perspective, and Juliano, the cinema's. About Rita Lee's guest performance, Bellotto said: The show features the guest performances of actresses Corina Sabbas, Cyntia Mendes, Yas Werneck and two other actors. Mendes was already involved with rock and roll and Sabbas with musicals, while Werneck came from the hip hop world. The three were selected after auditions and all of them stated they've already been sexually harassed at work or by their own boyfriends. According to the band, with their arrival to the project, some lyrics were changed according to their imputs. The members also lauded the participation of other women in the project, such as producer √Çngela Figueiredo, careographer Olivia Branco and codirector Luciana Ferraz. The show's scenery includes screens for the projection of various backgrounds and for the emulation of social media posts and it was set by Branco. The show had its premiere at Centro Cultural Teatro Gua√≠ra, during Festival de Teatro de Curitiba, and then headed to other Brazilian cities, starting with S√£o Paulo, on 12 April. Due to the project's complexity, the tour will only take the band to places with enough infraestructure to host the spectacle. In July 2018, it was announced that the spectacle would be released in DVD format in August, with the tracks being also released at digital platforms. The DVD version was recorded during a season at Teatro Opus, at Shopping Villa Lobos, in S√£o Paulo, and features some unique details in the scenery and in the projections. Due to a setback, the band had to record the show twice, once with and once without the audience. The tour is expected to continue throughout the year of 2019. Amidst the tour and after the DVD recording, Mello was diagnosed with a tumour in his larynx, which forced him off stage for three months, a period in which he was replaced by the band's former session bassist Lee Marcucci.  Lyrics and composition = Plot = Doze Flores Amarelas tells the story of three \\"calouras\\" (Maria A, Maria B, Maria C, conceived as alteregos of the three Tit√£s) who use a fictional app (Facilitador (\\"Facilitator\\")) to find a party to go. The app recommends them to a college party, which they attend dressed as witches. At the event, they end up raped by five classmates, with the crime resulting in consequences for all eight of them. Each of the three Marias deals with the happening in their own way: Maria A (Maria Alice) finds out she's pregnant of one of the rapers and is thorn between aborting or giving birth and raising the child. Meanwhile, she hopes her father, a priest, can comfort her. Maria B has strong vengeance wishes and Maria C, besides falling in love with one of the criminals, is unsure at first whether they were really raped or not. The three end up joining forces for a vengeance carried out with the aid of a mortal spell suggested by the app itself and that involves twelve yellow flowers. The album deals with themes such as violence, harassment, parents-children relationships, vengeance, hatred, passion, drugs, addiction to technology and its impact in people's lifes. The album's style goes from punk rock to acoustic, including orchestrated tracks, pop music, grunge, jazz and stoner rock. When the band decided to make a rock opera, they wanted to tell a story involving a college group and found at sexual violence a trigger for many topics. Mello says family experiences influenced the work: = Place of speech = On the fact that an all-male band is dealing with female themes, vocalist, keyboardist and bassist S√©rgio Britto stated: Bellotto also expressed his opinion on the matter, stating: Possolo added: \\"I find it important that we, men, can side with women, who are absolutely right about claiming their rights. The artist, the poet, is a 'pretender', so he has to 'pretend to be feeling this pain' and share it with a part of society.\\" Mello reminded that the band's previous album, Nheengatu (2014), already dealt with delicate topics such as pedophilia, racism and violence against women itself. = Title = The album was originally going to be titled Tr√™s Marias (Three Marias), but the band considered it a little bit clich√©. They opted to adopt the name of one of the tracks, which title refers to a spell the protagonists prepare during the plot. According to Bellotto, \\"it's an original name, that refers to women and to magic a little bit, and it's also poetic, because you don't know exactly what it is talking about, but you know there's something interesting there.\\" Track listing Critical reception = Spectacle reception = On the website Teatro em Cena, journalist Leonardo Torres criticised the plot's narrative thread, calling it \\"fragile and superficial\\" due to it losing focus and diverting \\"to other themes without managing to deal with all of them\\". He believes the work could improve if around ten songs were removed and considers the narrations \\"expendable and redundant\\". He also criticised specifically the transition between tracks, done in a manner incompatible with a theater spectacle and considered the songs little \\"contagious or memorable\\". Another aspect criticised by Torres was the role of the three actresses. According to him, they are almost always shown behind the musicians, barely having lights on them and having very little space to speak, while the band takes on the lead role on a female topic in a story created by a 100% male team, including singing lyrics written from female perspectives. Sandro Moser, from Gazeta do Povo, congratulated the band and all other personnel involved for the project's boldness, while also criticising the transition between tracks and the absence of a great moment. He also missed former member Paulo Miklos, an experienced actor.

Numatic's Henry Logo Current main-series vacuums A Henry HVR200 and Hetty HET200 in a store window at Christmastime This is a list of current Henry models which are being manufactured in the main series, which means they have \\"Henry\\" or another name on their caps and a face on their bodies. Some models do not have names, and as a result, only have \\"Numatic\\" on their caps, and in certain cases other words such as \\"Micro-filter\\". There are a total of fourteen current main-series Henry vacuums. Some models have been out for numerous years, meaning many of these models' looks have been changed over time, but the parts, power and bag size have stayed the same. * Henry (and Hetty) Compact (HVR160 and HET160) - Smaller and more compact versions of the standard Henry models, 6-litre capacity. *Henry Professional (HVR240) - A slightly larger version of the standard (9-litre) model for professional and retail applications. *Henry Cordless (HVB160) - A more compact version of the standard Henry model running off two 36-volt batteries, 6-litre capacity. *Henry Xtra (HVX200 and HVX160) - A version of the standard (9-litre) Henry model designed for carpet care and cleaning pet hairs. A smaller and more compact version of this model (which, like all the other \\"compact\\" Henry models, has a 6-litre capacity) also exists. *Henry Micro (HVR200M) - A version of the standard (9-litre) Henry model designed for reducing exposure to dust-related allergens. *Henry Allergy (HVA160) - A smaller, light blue version of the standard Henry model for capturing allergens, 6-litre capacity. *Henry Wash (HVW370) - A larger, dark blue version unlike any one of the standard Henry models, carpet cleaner, 15-litre capacity. *Charles (CVC370) - Larger blue wet-and-dry vacuum with a 15-litre dry and a 9-litre wet capacity which was also available in red, green and yellow at one time. In the late 1980s, this model and some others were also manufactured with a cream-and- brown colour scheme. *George (GVE370) - Larger green \\"all-in-one\\" vacuum with a 15-litre dry and a 9-litre wet capacity which was also available in red, blue and yellow at one time.

Biography Clough came up to Newnham College in 1884 to read Classics, some 13 years after its foundation. Her aunt, Anne Clough, was Principal of the College, at a time when women's higher education remained controversial: women could not be members of the University of Cambridge or receive Cambridge degrees. After completing her studies, Clough took on the role of secretary to the Principal, and administrator to the rapidly-growing college. In 1896 she became one of three vice-principals, who performed a tutorial as much as an administrative role. Clough was among those responsible for shaping the College's response to a rapidly changing society, and new expectations for and of women, including the growing suffragette movement and the First World War. She was particularly involved in assisting then Principal Katharine Stephen in work towards the Royal Charter and Statutes granted in 1917 whereby Newnham College became the first women‚Äôs College to be a self-governing academic community. At the same time, she contributed to the organization of women's war work. In 1917, under the reorganization of college government following the granting of the Royal Charter, she became sole vice-principal. In 1918, Clough was the sole female member of the Royal Commission considering the finances of Oxford and Cambridge. Clough was elected Principal in 1920, a time of major change for the country and the College. She had previously refused the role, in 1911. During her time as Principal (1920-1923), Clough fought to have women admitted to full membership of Cambridge University. The principle that women's admittance to the University be linked to government funding was refused in 1921. It was she who was Principal during the 1921 attacks on Newnham during undergraduate riots against women students. During these difficult times, Clough led the Fellowship, maintained unity with Girton College, and built relationships with male supporters of women's education. After Clough's retirement in 1923, she devoted her time to gardening, bird- watching, and volunteering for the London and National Society for Women‚Äôs Service which became the Fawcett Society in 1953. A.J. Pertz painted Clough while Principal of Newnham College and the portrait hangs in the college today. Ray Strachey painted two portraits of Clough between 1925-1931 which are now in the National Portrait Gallery. Family Clough was the youngest child of Arthur Hugh Clough and Blanche Mary Shore Smith.

He had set his heart on entering the religious life despite his initial reluctance due to him pondering on his unworthiness. This belief manifested in his childhood which motivated him to decide against entering the priesthood. But his religious formation in the order was pushed back due to World War I and he was unable to make his solemn religious profession until the war had concluded. Fra Cortinovis served as a porter and beggar for the order in their convent in Milan and remained there until his death. He established the Opera San Francesco in 1959 in order to work with the poor and was a foundation that earned the support of the Archbishop of Milan (and future pope) Giovanni Battista Montini. The beatification process opened in Milan in 1993 and he became titled as a Servant of God. Pope Francis confirmed his heroic virtue and named him as Venerable on 6 March 2018. Life Antonio Pietro Cortinovis was born on 7 November 1885 at 5:00pm in Costa Serina in Bergamo as the seventh of nine children to the peasants Lorenzo Cortinovis and Angela Gherardi (who was born to Giacomo in Trafficanti). His parents were married in 1870. The preceding sibling Margherita died just after her birth. Father Pietro Rota baptized him on 8 November in the church of Santi Lorenzo martire e Ambrogio. From his childhood he had a strong love and devotion to both the Eucharist and the Passion. He had often described his father as being rather reserved and sensitive and received his religious formation from his mother. From age six he began attending confession and he received his Confirmation on 10 August 1892 before making his First Communion on 7 April 1896. He never desired being an altar server in his childhood and perceived great unworthiness on his part in becoming a priest. This became the reason that he was never to become a priest. But after he did his schooling the idea to enter the religious life as a professed brother came to him and grew over time. In 1899 he entered the Third Order of Saint Francis and later in 1901 confessed to the priest friar Teodosio da Samarate (who came to the town to preach) of his desire to enter the religious life. Teodosio encouraged him and invited him to become a friar. Once - in 1905 - some acquaintances dragged him into a tavern and forced him to drink wine as the group did. Before he turned 23 he worked as both a shepherd and as a lumberjack. Cortinovis entered the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin on 21 April 1908 after his father (who died not long after in January 1909) accompanied him to the convent in Bergamo. His mother and siblings wept upon his departure. He moved to the Sovere convent on 22 April 1908 before commencing his novitiate under the guidance of Gianfrancesco da Cascina Ferrara. Cortinovis was vested in the religious habit for the first time on 29 July 1908 and assumed the religious name \\"Cecilio Maria da Costa Serina\\". He began to fast and scourge himself after this and he later made his simple profession on 2 August 1909. He spent time at the convent in Albino (from 10 August 1909 after his novitiate ended) before he was moved to the convent in Cremona on 17 February 1910. Cortinovis was later relocated to the order's convent in Milan on 29 April 1910. In Milan he lived in the convent of Viale Piave and tended to the poor of the area and acted as the sacristan from November 1914 until 1921. In 1914 he contracted meningitis which almost killed him. But he was healed on 18 April 1914 (when it seemed he was about to die) after his confrere Girolamo da Lomazzo turned to the intercession of Innocenzo da Berzo for a miracle. In July 1916 he was sent to the 5th Alpine Regiment in Tirano to reinforce the Stelvio Battalion on Mount Nero and regretted the fact that he was not allowed to wear his religious habit. But heart issues prompted a doctor's examination in November 1916 and he was discharged. Cortinovis made his solemn religious profession on 2 February 1918 and on 16 September 1921 was appointed as the porter for the convent. But he dreamed of working in the missions in either Brazil or Africa and he wanted to spend his life helping Venerable Daniele da Samarate with the lepers in Brazil. At dawn on 5 July 1922 he was in his cell when he saw a bright light and experienced a vision. Fra Cortinovis later established the Opera San Francesco in order to tend and minister to poor people. This project and its work received support from the Archbishop of Milan (and future pope) Giovanni Battista Montini. Cortinovis was also a close friend to the Bishop of Cesena Lino Esterino Garavaglia. In 1969 the Milanese authorities awarded him a silver medal for his work with the poor while the Lombard province granted him a gold medal for the same reason in 1970. His awards both made it into the press due to his reputation. From August 1979 he began suffering from cardiac pains and often had a series of breathing difficulties due to tract complications. His superiors decided his work with the Opera San Francesco had to end so as for him to recover. Cortinovis did not wish to do this but relented with obedience. From 1981 he kept moving from Milan to the convent's hospital in Bergamo for treatment. He died at 9:15pm on 10 April 1984 in Bergamo with a smile on his face. The requiem was celebrated at the Bergamo convent before the solemn funeral Mass was celebrated at the Milanese convent where he had lived for most of his life. His remains were buried at Musocco but were later exhumed and relocated to the church of the Sacred Heart on 31 January 1989. His remains lie in the chapel of that church close to the porter's lodge. Beatfication process The beatification process opened under Pope John Paul II on 1 July 1993 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints titled Cortinovis as a Servant of God and issued the \\"nihil obstat\\" (no objections to the cause) edict that initiated the cause. Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini oversaw the diocesan investigation into the late friar's life and virtues from 27 September 1993 until 10 April 1995. The C.C.S. validated the diocesan process in Rome on 22 March 1996 and later received the Positio dossier two decades later for assessment. Theologians assessed and approved the contents of the Positio in their meeting held on 6 February 2018. Pope Francis confirmed his heroic virtue and named him as Venerable on 6 March 2018. The current postulator for the cause is the Capuchin friar Carlo Calloni.

Facts Prior authorisation was needed before travelling to another member state to receive medical care, and being refunded. Ms Yvonne Watts went abroad to France because the UK had waiting lists for a hip replacement and applied for reimbursement. The NHS had no fund out of which to reimburse health care costs from abroad. There was no obligation to pay for private health care within the UK. She claimed this infringed her right to free movement under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 56, and freedom to receive services. The England and Wales Court of Appeal made a preliminary reference to the CJEU on whether TFEU article 56 applied. Judgment The European Court of Justice, Grand Chamber, held article 56 applied when a patient receives medical services in a hospital environment for consideration. It was legitimate to aim to ensure sufficient and permanent access to a range of high quality hospital treatments in a State if proportionate. The Court engaged in a detailed review of how the NHS treated waiting lists to manage health care provision. It said rising demand can justify waiting lists, but not enough in itself to satisfy the proportionality test. Individual circumstances of the patient need to be assessed.

In the last years of Queen Tamar's reign an uprising began in the mountain areas of Pkhovi, Mtiuleti, and Didoeti.  History  Although mountainous communities were nominally under the direct rule of the Georgian crown, they had never been completely integrated into the feudal system of medieval Georgia, and remained relatively little affected by implantation of aristocratic landowners. local patriarchal communities were rather electing their own council of elders and leaders, known as Khevisberi who functioned as a judge, priest and military leader. During the reign of Queen Tamar, Georgian feudal lords gradually increased their rights. This was a classical period in the history of Georgian feudalism. Georgia's northeastern frontier became the object of the Kakhetian Eristavis avarice. Attempts at transplanting feudal practices in the areas where they had previously been almost unknown did not pass without resistance. Thus, there was a revolt among the mountaineers of Pkhovi and Didoya in 1212. The refractory independence of Mountainous clans led to the sporadic incursions of royal troops aided by Dzurdzuk tribes, bent on forcing them into submission. One of the most devastating expeditions against the Mountaineers was organized in 1212, at the behest of the queen Tamar of Georgia who presided over the Golden Age of the Kingdom of Georgia. The contemporary chronicle recounts a bloody three-month campaign of pacification by Tamar's general Ivane Mkhargrdzeli, that left several villages and shrines destroyed.  Sources  * R.

Facts The parents of a child named Jaymee Bowen claimed that she should receive chemotherapy and a second bone marrow transplant for their 10 year old‚Äôs acute myeloid leukaemia. Consultants at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, and Royal Marsden Hospital in London thought it would not succeed. Treatment in the United States would have been far too expensive. One doctor in Hammersmith would have treated her for ¬£75,000. The doctors believed it would be ineffective and inappropriate. Judgment=High Court= Laws J held the doctors should have to ‚Äòdo more than toll the bell of tight resources. They must explain the priorities that have led them to decline to fund the treatment.‚Äô =Court of Appeal= Sir Thomas Bingham MR held, the same day, the Health Authority had acted rationally and fairly and intervention would be misguided. ‚ÄòI have no doubt that in a perfect world any treatment which a patient, or a patient's family, sought would be provided if doctors were willing to give it, no matter how much it cost, particularly when a life was potentially at stake. It would however, in my view, be shutting one's eyes to the real world if the court were to proceed on the basis that we do live in such a world. It is common knowledge that health authorities of all kinds are constantly pressed to make ends meet. They cannot pay their nurses as much as they would like; they cannot provide all the treatments they would like; they cannot purchase all the extremely expensive medical equipment they would like; they cannot carry out all the research they would like; they cannot build all the hospitals and specialist units they would like. Difficult and agonising judgments have to be made as to how a limited budget is best allocated to the maximum advantage of the maximum number of patients. That is not a judgment which the court can make. In my judgment, it is not something that a health authority such as this Authority can be fairly criticised for not advancing before the court.‚Äô Significance After the Court of Appeal judgment, the Sun said the child was ‚ÄòCondemned by Bank Balance‚Äô and the Daily Mail said the child was ‚ÄòSentenced to Death‚Äô. An anonymous private donor paid for treatment. The consultant who had agreed, changed tack, did not provide a second bone marrow transplant, and did an experimental treatment called donor lymphocyte infusion. Jaymee died after a few months.

His abbacy was from around 1308‚Äì09 to 1314‚Äì15.  Hoo appears to have been something of a disciplinarian, even to point on occasion of expelling monks for the convent for their transgressions. He also continued his predecessor's feud with the Justice of Chester, Robert Holland, complaining that Holland repeatedly deprived the Abbey and its tenants of their forestry rights in Cheshire. Further, Hoo claimed, Holland also prevented him from exercising the Abbot's feudal jurisdiction over prisoners captured on the Abbey's own demesne lands. On the other hand, the Abbey's own chronicler described Hoo as a \\"good, gentle and simple\\" man.

A temporal light modulation (TLM) disturbance may be either an intentional or unintentional temporal light modulation (TLM) of lighting equipment such as luminaires or lamps. Examples of equipment that can be interfered are barcode scanners, cameras and test equipment. NOTE ‚Äì Temporal light modulations may also annoy human beings. In general, undesired effects in the visual perception of a human observer induced by light intensity fluctuations are called Temporal Light Artefacts (TLAs).CIE TN 006:2016, Visual Aspects of Time-Modulated Lighting Systems ‚Äì Definitions and Measurement Models (pdf). Figure 1: TLI tripyich: temporal light modulations that may interfere equipment.  Root causes of TLI  Temporal light modulation disturbances may arise from fluctuations of the light intensity of lighting equipment. Light emitted from lighting equipment such as luminaires and lamps may vary in strength as function of time, either intentionally or unintentionally (Figure 1). Generally, the light output of lighting equipment has unintentional residual light level modulations due to the lighting equipment itself. The magnitude, shape, periodicity and frequency of the TLM depends on many factors such as the type of light source, the electrical mains-supply frequency, the driver or ballast technology and type of light regulation technology applied (e.g. pulse-width modulation). Conventional incandescent type of lighting equipment typically has a moderate residual light modulation (10%- 20% modulation depth) with a modulation frequency which is twice the mains frequency. LED-type of lighting equipment, because they are semiconductor devices, respond much more rapidly to variations in the input signal than the conventional light sources. Therefore, LED light sources are also much more sensitive to fluctuations in the input current, and reproduce those current fluctuations in the light output, potentially leading to TLI. Furthermore, external factors such as incompatibility with dimmers or presence of mains- supply voltage fluctuations (power-line flicker) play a role and may cause additional temporal light modulations. TLMs can be designed-in fluctuations from the electronic driver because of application of certain driver or light- regulation technologies. For example, AC-fed drivers or application of pulse- width modulation for light-level regulation cause a fairly high magnitude of modulation. However, LED drivers can also be designed to reduce the residual fluctuations in the current to the LEDs to limit the risk of TLI in specific applications. Sometimes also intentional light variations are applied, for instance for visible light communication.  Potential victims of TLI  Equipment having an optical interface (Figure 1), that potentially may be interfered by TLM disturbances include: * Film cameras, both analog and digital * Smartphone cameras * Security cameras * Professional (television) camera‚Äôs, including high definition camera with super slow motion * Laser beam-based barcode scanners * Barcode scanners * Pulse oximeters * Infrared remote controls * Systems for visible light communications Each of this equipment have an optical interface for their functioning but they employ very different mechanisms, principles and restrictions to process the incoming light. Therefore, there is also a large variety of interference mechanisms. Consequently, there is not a single and simple metric that describes the level of degradation or malfunction of each of these type of equipment.  Examples of victims of temporal light interference = Visible Light Communication (VLC) = Visible light communication typically uses a common LED light source that is used for illumination and adds a small level of modulation on the DC- light level to transfer data. The receiver can be a specific device using a photodiode as detector, but it is often also a common smartphone camera. Various pulse modulation techniques and data rates can be applied depending on the function of the VLC system. TLM disturbances from sunlight or other ambient lighting can cause interference of the VLC system.Latif Ullah Khan, Visible light communication: applications, architecture, standardization and research challenges, Digital Communications and Networks 3 (2017) 78‚Äì88. VLC systems generally apply specific coding and modulation techniques to achieve robustness against common TLM disturbances. = Barcode scanners = Barcode scanners are widely used, for instance to improve the efficiency in processing products and clients, such as super market check-out counters, hospital check in, parcel tracking and industrial production statistics. The use of linear (1D) and matrix (2D) barcodes is widespread. TLMs from lighting equipment located in the neighbourhood where barcode scanners are applied can cause TLI.X. Deng et al, Performance of barcode scanner using peak detection with interference from LED lamps, 2015 IEEE Symposium on Communications and Vehicular Technology in the Benelux (SCVT), 24-24 Nov. 2015 = Slow-motion cameras = Recordings of slow-motion cameras in environments with temporal light modulations may induce artefacts on displays such as flickering or banding.  Mitigation of TLI  Generally, TLIs can be avoided by reducing the level of TLMs. For example, to avoid the visibility of artefacts on displayed content from slow-motion cameras, the modulation depth of the light modulations must be reduced. The European standard EN 12193 for sport lightingEN 12193:2018, Light and lighting - Sports lighting, December 2018 specifies maximum levels of modulation depth (also called flicker factor FF) to obtain flicker-free pictures taken by high-speed cameras. For modulation frequencies below 40 kHz, the modulation depth of the TLM must be less than 1 %. The FF of Light modulations above 40 kHz can be more relaxed (less than 5 %). Also CIE technical report CIE 083CIE 083:2019, Guide for the lighting of sports events for colour television and film systems, ed. 3, provides guidance for lighting requirements for both television and film recording in sports applications to avoid TLI and uses flicker factor as metric. CIE 083 states that a lighting installation with a flicker factor less than 1 % will not generate TLI for super-slow motion and ultra-slow motion cameras. The UEFA football stadium lighting guideUEFA Stadium Lighting Guide 2016 and the FIH GuideFIH Guide - Sports lighting for broadcasting 11 a-side hockey, outdoors (18-05-06) for lighting of outdoor hockey facilities are a few examples of lighting performance guides for sports facilities which specify TLM in terms of FF for different quality levels of facilities.

Overview  For observational purposes, Paz uses a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to collect images of Earth for governmental and commercial use, as well as other ship tracking and weather sensors, which enables high-resolution mapping of large geographical areas at day and night. The X-band radar imaging payload operates at a wavelength of , or a frequency of 9.65 gigahertz. The Paz satellite is operated in a constellation with the German SAR fleet TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X on the same orbit. The collaboration was agreed on by both Hisdesat and former European aerospace manufacturer Astrium, operator of the two other satellites. The high-resolution images will be used for military operations, border control, intelligence, environmental monitoring, protection of natural resources, city, and infrastructure planning, and monitoring of natural catastrophes. Originally, Paz was scheduled for launch from the Yasny launch base, Russia, in 2014, but this was delayed due to Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea, resulting in an International Court of Arbitration legal battle between Hisdesat and Kosmotras.

Abatement ab initio was the subject of two United States Supreme Court decisions, Durham v. United States (1971) and Dove v. United States (1976). The former extended the doctrine to cases where certiorari was pending and not yet granted, and the latter excluded discretionary appeals.Abatement AB Initio and a Crime Victim‚Äôs Right to Restitution  Cases  Abatement ab initio was used in federal court to overturn the conviction of Enron CEO Kenneth Lay. In the state of Massachusetts, it was used to overturn the convictions of John Salvi, and Aaron Hernandez, both convicted of murder. In the latter case, however, the state appealed the decision; in March 2019 the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court reinstated Hernandez's conviction, and ended the use of the doctrine in Massachusetts. The ruling held that the defendant's death rendered the appeal moot; it also held that trial records should indicate that such convictions were \\"neither affirmed nor reversed\\".  Retroactive effect  In instances where the doctrine is applied, a legal issue emerges concerning previous rulings or actions made. An example is the case of Aaron Hernandez' conviction for Odin Lloyd's murder. Due to the principle of abatement ab initio, his conviction was initially rendered void before the Massachusetts supreme court ruled to abolish abatement ab initio (see above). It was, thus, argued that - since he was cleared of every murder he was accused of - Hernandez' family was entitled to the money that the New England Patriots refused to pay after it voided his contract on account of Lloyd's murder. In 2016, when the court wiped the Enron-related fraud convictions of Kenneth Lay, the compensation for defrauded victims were also lost. A ruling involving asset forfeiture law in the United States held that if an offender satisfied a forfeiture judgment, the government is never required by the principle to return fines that were already paid.

The Franchise Director had not properly understood Ministerial instructions. But no mandatory remedy was granted, referring the question back to the Franchise Director for further consideration.

Other companies with newer contracts, (First Hull Trains and Grand Central) were given a charge varying with network usage. GNER argued that they were equivalent parties, so that differences amounted to unlawful discrimination under Sch 3, para 1(1)(b), not enough to cover avoidable costs under para 1(4), and unlawful state aid. Judgment Sullivan J held that Office of Rail Regulation‚Äôs (ORR) approach was lawful, and it had a wide discretion to manage the network in the interests of passengers and make track access agreement. Operators should be able to pay costs and encouraged to use rail infrastructure. GNER was not providing comparable services. GNER could either enter the downstream rail passenger market by tendering a competitive bid, or by seeking open access. All routes were open without discrimination, so no distortion of competition could be inferred: HJ Banks & Co Ltd v Coal Authority (2001) C-390/98.

However this diplomatic cordiality by the Libyan regime was met with skepticism and suspicion by Doe who surmised that Gaddafi was attempting to bring Liberia into Libya's sphere of influence as part of his Pan-African ambitions. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Richard Moose reportedly flew to Liberia in a chartered jet with $10 million in cash after the coup to urge Doe not to turn to Libya for financial assistance. The Libyan embassy in Monrovia was closed down and its diplomats expelled. In a 1983 interview Doe said, \\"Qaddafi is a man who, I think, would like to lead the whole continent of Africa, which is impossible to do,\\" adding that Gaddafi was destabilizing the continent by sponsoring terrorist activities, \\"Qaddafi pays terrorists to carry explosives to other African countries, and of course we in Liberia are aware of Qaddafi's threat, and we're very cautious about that.\\" After war broke out between Libya and Chad, Doe sent a team of military officers to Israel to obtain intelligence about Libya. Motivated by a desire to contain Nigeria and a dislike of Doe, Gaddafi began financing opposition groups in Liberia, among them Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia, a group whose members received weapons training in Libya. =Taylor Era= After Charles Taylor came to power in Liberia after the conclusion First Liberian Civil War, diplomatic relations with Libya were restored. Taylor's lieutenant, Moses Blah who had trained with Taylor in Libya before the civil war, was appointed to be the country's ambassador to Libya. Samuel Dokie, a former ally of Taylor who also trained in Libya, called Taylor, \\"Qaddafi's surrogate,\\" and labeled his election as, \\"Qaddafi's biggest victory in Africa.\\" Modern era With the outbreak of the Libyan Civil War, Gaddafi turned to sub-Saharan African mercenaries to supplement his forces. Many of these mercenaries were Liberians who had previously fought with Charles Taylor. Liberia once again broke relations with Libya in April 2011. After the Libyan elections of 7 July 2012, Liberia renewed relations with Tripoli on July 16. In 2017, a protest was held outside the Libyan embassy in Monrovia demanding better treatment of African migrants apprehended in Libya, accusing the country of torturing and killing Liberians.

It is the largest meal-kit provider in the United States, and also has operations in Canada, Western Europe (including Luxembourg, Germany, Belgium, France, and the Netherlands), New Zealand and Australia. It has been listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange since its IPO in November 2017.  History  Logo used from 2016 to 5 October 2020. HelloFresh was founded in November 2011 by Dominik Richter, Thomas Griesel, and Jessica Nilsson in Berlin, Germany. Richter and Griesel packed and hand-delivered the first 10 customers. It was one of the earlier companies in the meal-kit industry. They were initially funded by Rocket Internet, a German startup studio company. They first started delivering meal kits to paying customers in early 2012, and expanded to the Netherlands, UK, US and Australia the same year. By 2014, the company claimed to be delivering 1 million meals per month. They raised $50 million in a 2014 funding round, after having raised $10 million in 2012 and $7 million in 2013. By March 2015, the company had 250,000 subscribers, although it was still not profitable. In September of that year, it was valued at ‚Ç¨2.6 billion in a funding round where it raised ‚Ç¨75 million, making it a unicorn company. The company was still majority-owned by Rocket Internet at that time. It cancelled a planned IPO in November, due to concerns about the company's proposed value. It experienced significant growth during the year, with 530,000 subscribers by the end of October. It had 750,000 subscribers by July 2016, and 1.3 million by the third quarter of 2017. In October 2017, the company announced a planned IPO on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange to raise $350 million. On November 2, the company completed its IPO, valuing it at ‚Ç¨1.7 billion. At the time of its IPO, the company had a market capitalization of more than double Blue Apron, its largest US-based competitor. In March 2018, HelloFresh acquired Green Chef, a US organic meal-kit company. In October 2018, Toronto-based HelloFresh Canada acquired Chefs Plate, a Canadian meal- kit company. In 2019, Rocket Internet sold its remaining stake in HelloFresh by accelerated book building to international institutional investors. Rocket Internet had held 30.6% of HelloFresh as of the end of 2018.  Business  HelloFresh's business model is to prepare the ingredients needed for a meal, and deliver them to customers, who must then cook the meal using recipe cards, which takes around 30‚Äì40 minutes. It generally provides about three two-person meals a week for about $60 to $70. It offers a choice from about 19 recipes. In the United States, HelloFresh offers a wine-subscription service, based on that of its competitor Blue Apron. In several markets, it provides \\"Rapid Box\\" meals which take only 20 minutes to prepare. The company's US operations were responsible for 60% of revenues as of November 2017, and it has approximately 44% of the American market. HelloFresh also has operations in the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Sweden, France, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Denmark. Criticism HelloFresh has been criticised for the excessive packaging of their delivered meals, leading to waste. The company has also been criticised for its continually high marketing costs, which have prevented the company from being profitable. A related concern is the low customer retention rate of the company. According to an independent analysis, less than 50% of customers remain subscribers after the first week, and less than 10% remain after 6 months. The company disputes these findings.

He calls his method contemporealism ‚Äì a fusion that is primarily centered around hyper-realism and contemporary art. In 2019, Ken Nwadiogbu was awarded the prestigious The Future Awards Africa and was named by Guardian Life as one of the most ‚ÄúOutstanding Personalities of 2019‚Äù. Early life and education Kenechukwu Nwadiogbu did not set out to become an artist. Born at a time when parents still choose professions for their children and fields in science were deemed the most lucrative, Nwadiogbu wanted to study civil engineering. Although, this 17-year-old Nwadiogbu's life is about to change as he discovers art in the most intriguing way- puppy love. As he developed in his drawing, his fame among his small circle grew and the encouragement from his friends spurred him on. Nwadiogbu attended the University of Lagos, where he studied Civil and Environmental Engineering. His journey with art began in this university, and despite having no formal training, he has pushed to become an interesting contemporary artist from Nigeria. Style of art According to an interview with Juxtapoz Magazine, Nwadiogbu responds on canvas to socio-political structures and issues around him and the world. Through meticulous hyperrealist technique, he constructs arresting images rich with deft use of form and space. Cleverly, his paintings regularly feature obscure portraits of everyday people peeking through the ripped paper, elevating and situating Africans in the global context. Weighty issues like gender equality, African cultures, global politics, Black power, and most recently knife-crime come to the conversation by way of his mind-boggling technique. Working with charcoal, pencil, and acrylic, Nwadiogbu aims to achieve a deeper meaning through his art, one which goes beyond the visually spectacular facade he presents into different themes. His art is inspired by social movements and principles while evaluating, interrogating and challenging socio-political structures and issues within society. He perceives his art as a response to society and a way to inspire one or two people to re-evaluate their socio- political structures. =A Voice for #MeToo= According to an interview with CNN, Nwadiogbu's most recent work was a piece for the global #MeToo movement‚Äîa work he's so passionate about, he completed it within 24 hours. In the #MeToo piece, two girls are wrapped in nylon, one is depressed and resigned to her fate; the other is angry and determined to push through the barrier. It's an emotional piece, born from thoughtfulness and his passion to give young African girls a voice. \\"I want the African girl to be like the second girl (in the painting) who is saying, 'I want to speak out.

He was known as the \\"King of Zinc\\" and opened the London Zinc Works in Hoxton in 1837. Life He was the son of J√≥zefina, n√©e Frey and Piotr Steinkeller descended from Pomeranian nobility. The family being of Roman Catholic observance, migrated to the Tyrol at the time of the Reformation, and later moved to Vienna. In mid 18th century, Steinkeller's grandfather arrived in Krak√≥w to open a wholesale business in spices. The family business carried on into the next generation, headed by the following Piotr, who died prematurely in 1813, leaving a widow with 5 children. At that stage Piotr Antoni was sent to Vienna to study international trade and to do an internship in banking. He returned to Krak√≥w in 1818 and took over the management of the family business. From the start he evinced great energy and inventiveness. He proceeded to make local investments in Krak√≥w Free State. In 1822 he bought a mining concession near Jaworzno, where he built a coal mine and a zinc smelting factory that he named \\"J√≥zefina\\" after his mother. It became the scene of his broad range of economic interests as he proved himself a pioneer in the industrial field. He made contracts for an uninterrupted supply of raw materials from the open-cast zinc mine in D≈Çugoszyn and leased further zinc ore deposits in Byczyna. He established a state-of-the-art Zinc production- line that employed around 80 people. He was a social innovator in relation to his work-force: he brought in signed work contracts outlining the rights and obligations of both parties and provided accommodation for the workers. For that purpose he erected an estate for his employees ‚Äì this became the foundation of today's district. He also initiated a scheme to build a miners' hospital in Jaworzno and equipped the first industrial Fire service in the area. Expansion in Warsaw In 1825 Steinkeller resolved to sell the Niedzieliski business and move to Warsaw, where he settled permanently. There he continued his pioneering economic involvement in several fields. He opened a large Department store, imported salt from England, invested in mining and Steel production in DƒÖbrowa G√≥rnicza, where exploration of deep mining had just begun at Zag≈Çƒôbie DƒÖbrowskie. He established a Brickworks in Pomiech√≥wek and bought a steam-driven mill in Solec in Warsaw. He expanded his zinc interests into large-scale production by leasing government owned tin mines and smelting facilities in Congress Poland. He also imported zinc from the Krak√≥w area, controlled then by Habsburg Austria. Whereas in London he set up a zinc works to produce galvanised sheeting and from there he developed an international trade in the metal. Abstract in English In 1838 he set up a Courier service whose network covered virtually all the main tracts in the Russian-controlled Kingdom of Poland and outlying areas, using specialist courier carriages he produced at his Solec depot, known as ‚Äûsteinkellerki\\" ‚Äì Steinkeller's Diligence‚Äù. He supplemented these with a river courier service. Until the opening of the Warsaw-Vienna railway of which he was one of the early backers and investors, his messenger network was the chief source of his revenues. Thanks to his efforts, on Nowy ≈öwiat Street, the main commercial thoroughfare in Warsaw, the road was laid out in timber blocks. He acquired a vast country estate near Czƒôstochowa, in an area known as dominium ≈ºareckie or \\"≈ªarki domain\\", including the town of ≈ªarki, and villages like: Jarosz√≥w, Zawada, Le≈õni√≥w, Przewodziszowice, Jaworznik, Cisz√≥wka, Myszk√≥w, Nowa Wie≈õ and Warcianna. There he brought in modern agricultural techniques in raising crops and animal husbandry. He also opened a factory to produce agricultural machinery. He was also an active investor and financier. Among his roles were consultant to Bank Polski, where he worked closely with Henryk ≈Åubie≈Ñski, and was a senior consultant to the Warsaw Stock Exchange. The registered office of his business was in the Mniszch√≥w Palace in Warsaw, that had been refurbished for the Warsaw Chamber of commerce (Warszawska Resursa Kupiecka), of which Steinkeller was an active member. However, not all of Steinkeller's initiatives were crowned with success. This was due largely to problems of a technical nature. Faith in foreign specialists was sometimes misplaced. Examples of this were his over-reliance on them in the restoration of lead mines in Olkusz, or in the production of Farm equipment, or importing river barges from England whose draught was inappropriate for Polish waterways. His own financial situation took a turn for the worse towards the end of the 1840s. His indebtedness to Bank Polski, a new management (≈Åubie≈Ñski and president Lubowidzki had been removed on charges of malfeasance) at the bank and a fire at his Solec works led to his being declared bankrupt in 1849. All his assets in Congress Poland were taken over by Bank Polski. He returned \\"over the border\\" to Krak√≥w, where he still owned assets like his brickworks and a roof-tile factory in Podg√≥rze. Not long after he died of a cardiac arrest. Personal life Steinkeller was twice married: firstly, to Aniela Anthonin, and secondly to Maria Lema≈Ñska. From his first marriage there were four sons and a daughter, J√≥zef, Alfred, Aleksander, Edward and Paulina. There was one son from the second marriage, Henryk Artur. Steinkeller's nephew by his sister, was J√≥zef Hauke-Bosak. Honours Commemorative plaque to Steinkeller in St Peter and Paul church, Warsaw Among his contemporaries he was greatly admired and carried great authority. His appeal to colleagues can be summed up as follows: \\"aside from his astonishing energy and his enormous zest for industry, he had a solid and honest respect for industry itself, not as a pretext for speculation, not as an asset stripper, but looking out for organic growth for the benefit of the country as a whole.\\" He was awarded; * The Order of Saint Stanislaus III class 1839 * The Order of St. Anna III class 1842 On the 50th anniversary of his death in 1904 a commemorative plaque to Steinkeller was placed in St Peter and Paul church, Warsaw with the inscription: To a deserving Polish industrial pioneer, from his grateful countrymen.

There was a case potentially analogous in Durrant v Branksome Urban District Council [1897] 2 Ch 291 but that has to be rejected.

Today, he is best known for the destruction of architecturally significant buildings and the subsequent development of new luxury buildings in New York City. Early life Campagna was born in Castelmezzano, Italy in 1884. His father was a builder. His brother Armino Campagna (1898‚Äì1985), who married his wife's sister Christina Paterno, also moved to New York and worked in real estate with him. He received his preliminary education in Potenza, later attended the University of Rome and graduated, with honors, from the law school at the University of Naples in 1906. Career After graduating from law school, he moved to Chicago to work with on an Italian language newspaper. During a visit to New York City. he met with several builders inspiring him to change his profession and move to New York. =Real estate= In 1909, he moved to New York to work for the Paterno Brothers construction firm. Campagna later formed the company Campagna Construction Company, and was responsible for building several of the most prominent luxury apartments in the City following World War I, including 960 Fifth Avenue, 35 Park Avenue and 530 Park Avenue. He also developed 173-175 Riverside Drive which occupied the entire blockfront between 89th Street and 90th Street on the Upper West Side. In 1927, he purchased 962 Fifth Avenue for $3 million (). The building, which was the residence of the late Senator Clark and cost $7 million to build, was sold by Clark's widow and daughter, Huguette Clark, who moved to 907 Fifth Avenue. Campagana had the mansion torn down just 19 years after it was built in 1911. Campagna hired Warren & Wetmore and architect Rosario Candela to design the new building, along with Dorothy Draper, the prominent interior decorator. The building was completed in 1928 and the original apartments were priced from $130,000 to $325,000. More than 75 percent of the apartments were sold before the frame of the building was enclosed. The largest initial stockholder in the building was Dr. Preston Pope Satterwhite who reportedly paid $450,000 for his 20-room apartment, which was considered the most expensive cooperative sale ever paid at the time. In 1935, as the executive head of Rialto Times Square Inc., he was responsible for tearing down the old Rialto Theatre, developed by Paramount Pictures and located at 42nd Street and Seventh Avenue. After Campagna demolished the theatre, he rebuilt it on a smaller scale and dedicated the rest of the building to shops and office space. =Philanthropy= In addition, he was the founder of the Casa Italiana at Columbia University, which was originally opened as an outreach of the Italian government of Benito Mussolini. In 1926-27, he hired William M. Kendall of McKim, Mead & White to design the building in the Renaissance style, modeled after a 15th-century Roman palazzo, p.195 which was built by his firm. He traveled back to Italy and helped restore Virgil's tomb in Naples and a Roman tower in Minturno. =Honors= In 1929, he was conferred the order of Grand Officer of the Crown of Italy by Dr. Emanuele Grazzi, Consul General of Italy. In 1930, he was bestowed with the title Count of Castelmezzano by King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy. Reportedly, he did not use the title, stating: \\"Builder is title enough.\\" =Political career= In 1943, Campagna was appointed by New York City Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia to replace Dr. Bonaschi and serve as a Bronx member of the New York City Board of Education. He served as chairman on the Committee of Building and Sites in the 1940s, and directed a $100 million program to construct schools. He retired from the Board in 1949. Personal life The driveway to the Anthony Campagna Estate Campagna was married to Marie Paterno (1885‚Äì1967). She was the daughter of Giovanni Paterno and Carolina Trivigno Paterno and the sister of Joseph and Charles V. Paterno. Marie was also from Castelmezzano and was the daughter of his former employer at Paterno Brothers.

Since the program's inception in 1999 (at a different location), about 15% of the 579 sex offenders who were civilly committed in New Jersey have been discharged to the community after treatment. The state estimated in 2016 that there were 15 patients at Avenel who were convicted as juveniles but were sent to Avenel, indefinitely, once they completed their sentences. Public defenders and attorneys for the residents put the number at 30. In 2016, Gary Lanigan, the Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Corrections, and a host of others were hit with a class action suit filed by detainees. They claim their civil rights are violated because they are not provided \\"adequate and meaningful mental health treatment\\" (necessary for their possible release) due to \\"systematic deficiencies.\\" The complaint also says that in addition to the reportedly inadequate treatment, plaintiffs have \\"been confined in punitive conditions\\" that overstep the goal of the Sexually Violent Predator Act.

CutOut Fest is Mexico's largest festival celebrating non-traditional filmmaking. Besides the main competition, the festival includes other events in the program like artist panels, workshops, and installations. The festival's \\"objective is to promote the development of the animation and digital arts industries in Mexico as a free forum for international dissemination\\" The logo of the festival is the View Master and the tagline is \\"new ways to see\\". The admission to the entire festival is free of cost as long as the attendee registers beforehand. The main sponsors of the festival are government agencies that promote cultural activities in Mexico including Quer√©taro Esta En Nostros, Secretaria de Cultural, Museo de La Ciudad, and Cineteca Rosalio Solana.  History  CutOut Fest was founded in 2009 as a CutOut Fest International Animated Short Film by Bianca Peregrina and Miguel del Moral. Since then, the festival has evolved into \\"International Festival of Animation and Digital Arts\\". In 2014, the festival entered the Network of Latin American Animation Festivals, which provides the festival with access to Latin American animators and animation studios, many of whom have been invited to speak at artist panels and participate in the festival as a jury member.  Programs  An annual CutOut Fest festival generally has four days of programming. Each day consists of screenings of the official selections to the festival's main competition categories. At the same time, there are artist panels, installations, VR experiences, freeplay areas, and live performances happening at other theater venues. The VR experiences and freeplay areas are part of the CutOut Fest Interactive that exhibit interactive stories and games that attendees can participate in. Separate from the festival events is the Living Market in which the primary purpose is to create an opportunity for animators and industry people to network. It has a variety of workshops related to building animation techniques as well as workshops on navigating the job market. CutOut Fest also has a YouTube channel called CutOut TV that posts teasers about the upcoming festival and recaps of past events.  Awards  There are two awards given for the main competition categories of Best Narrative Short Film and Best Student Film. One film is selected as the overall winner and one Mexican film is selected as the winner of the Mexican version of the same award. Best Narrative Short Film also grants several Special Mention awards. The other awards include Best Experimental Short Film, Best Music Video, Best Title Sequence, and Best Advertising Spot.

Life  Klaus Bachler first studied acting at the Wiener Max-Reinhardt-Seminar. After graduation he went to the Salzburger Landestheater and was engaged on various German stages. From 1987 to 1990 he was artistic director of the Berlin Schiller Theater and then went to Paris for two years. In 1992, he returned to Austria and was initially appointed director of the Vienna Festival, (where he initiated the cult piece Alma - Show Biz to the end, among others), then in 1996 he became director of the Vienna Volksoper. In 1999 he took over the Viennese Burgtheater from Claus Peymann. At the beginning of the 2008/2009 season Klaus Bachler took over the directorship of the Bavarian State Opera in Munich. Since then, he went back to using his birth name, Nikolaus Bachler.Nikolaus Bachler Lebenslauf auf den Seiten der Bayerischen Staatsoper  Activity at the Burgtheater  Bachler's direction was a paradigm shift for the Burgtheater, compared to the direction of his predecessor. Bachler was a cultural manager-director, moving the theater to the forefront, not like his predecessor Peymann, a warlike director. He engaged directors such as Luc Bondy, Andrea Breth, and Peter Zadek. He understood theater to have a certain social responsibility. In 2007 he launched the initiative \\"Free theater!\\", for which school classes were offered the opportunity to attend select performances free of charge. The program included modern as well as classical pieces in different stagings. He established the venues \\"Vestibule\\" and \\"Casino\\" as spaces for experimental theater and new approaches. Klaus Bachler placed a thematic emphasis on the Shakespeare cycle, which ran until 2008, in which modern interpretations of classical Shakespeare plays, readings, and lectures examined the work and time of Shakespeare and its effects on the contemporary age. Other highlights were the MTV Unplugged concerts by Die Toten Hosen, released on the album Nur zu Besuch in 2005, produced by Christoph Schlingensief.  Bayerische Staatsoper  In 2008 Nikolaus Bachler took over the direction of the Bayerische Staatsoper. He continued the artistic vision of his Burgtheater years, hiring opera directors such as Hans Neuenfels, Dmitri Tcherniakov, Martin Ku≈°ej, Krzysztof Warlikowski, and Calixto Bieito, as well as drama directors like David B√∂sch, Andreas Kriegenburg, and Ant√∫ Romero Nunes, who presented their first opera productions there. He led new interpretations of Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen in 2012 and the world premieres of Peter E√∂tv√∂s' Die Trag√∂die des Teufels (2010), Miroslav Srnka's Make No Noise (2011), J√∂rg Widmann's Babylon (2012), and Srnka's South Pole.Nikolaus Bachler Biography at webpage of Bayerische Staatsoper At the beginning of the 2013/14 season, Nikolaus Bachler appointed the conductor Kirill Petrenko as General Music Director.

This law also provided amendments to the Japanese Labor Standards Act of 1947 and the Working Women's Welfare Law. The law provides for a Conciliation Commission to arbitrate disputes between women and their employers, along with placing specific legal protections into law. The law also establishes what equal opportunities are legally expected of employers. The law has been revised twice since its passage, once in 1997, and once in 2005-2006. The 1997 revisions target discrimination in specific areas of promotion, recruitment, and hiring, while the 2005-6 revisions focus on making employers responsible for eradicating sexual harassment in the workplace.  Provisions = Article 1 - Fringe Benefits = This section defines the \\"fringe benefits\\" that the government's Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare will provide to further the goal of equal opportunity. These rights include: home lending, disbursing funds for the welfare of workers, and lending money for living or educational expenses. = Article 2 - Measures That May Cause Substantial Discrimination Due to a Person's Sex = This applies the law to three sets of actions an employer takes that the law mainly applies to.

These reasons contain: pregnancy, childbirth, leave requests, reduction of responsibilities, work and overtime hours, overtime, child care time-off requests, and decline in physical abilities due to childbirth.  Article 2-3 - Time Off Requirements  This section requires employers to allow for specific amounts of time off related to the weeks of pregnancy for the purposes of receiving medical care. The law also stipulates that up to a year after childbirth, the employer must allow for sufficient time off for medical care. = Article 3 - Chief of the Conciliation Commission = This section provides for the appointment of the Chief of the Conciliation Commission and gives the Chief the power to preside over meetings. It also provides for the Chief's Deputy, who can preside in the unavoidable absence of the Chief, to be appointed by the Chief. = Article 4 - Equal Opportunity Conciliation Conference = This article establishes the Equal Opportunity Conciliation Conference. The Chief convenes each conference, which requires at least 2 other commissioners in order to meet. It also states that meetings of the commission will not be open to the public. = Article 5 - Administrative Work of the Equal Opportunity Conciliation Conference = This section delegates the administrative duties of the Conference to the Equal Opportunity Department in the Prefectural Labor Office where the Conference is located. = Article 6 - Application for Conciliation = This section lays out the application process for review by the Conference. It requires a written application filed to the Director of the applicable Prefectural Labor Office. = Article 7 - Decision to Commence Conciliation = This section directs the Director of the Prefectural Labor Office who received the application to send the case to the Conference immediately after his decision to refer the matter to the Committee. The Director must also notify the parties involved in the complaint of the decision to send the case to the Committee or dismiss the complaint. = Article 8 - Hearing on the Circumstances from the Parties Concerned, etc. = This section details the procedure of a hearing. Anyone requested to attend must attend, but is allowed to bring an assistant. This assistant is legally allowed to make a statement.

Criticisms  The law has been heavily criticized by many Japanese feminists for not containing penalties for employers that break the law, or providing stronger protections for women. The law also created the new practice of creating two tracks for women, the \\"management\\" track parallel to the men, and the \\"general employee\\" track specific to women, which allowed for more time off and location stability with almost no chances for advancement. The two track system was eventually implemented by almost half of Japan's largest corporations.Mun, Eun Mi (June 2011). The Equal Employment Opportunity Law and Women's Employment in Japan, 1986-2009 (PhD). Harvard University. The issue of employment also extended to the types of work women were hired to do. Most women were hired as temporary employees or part-time employees ineligible for advancement or trainings. Soon after the law's moderately successful implementation, the 1990s recession curbed the increases, and the percentage of women in the workforce dropped. Another major criticism is the focus on pregnancy and childbirth benefits, which critics claim are a product of sexist attitudes of seeing women as mothers first. Currently, the law is seen as an imperfect attempt to solve the core concerns, with women only making up 9% of management positions, despite making up about 40% of the employee base. To try and improve the gender balance in management positions, the government set an official goal of 30% women in management roles by 2020 in 2003, but were forced to revise the goal to 15% of management in businesses and 7% in the government sector but continued to work with the original goal in mind. The main implementation system of the law is a mediation system, based on the Japanese aversion to judicial solutions, except in rare circumstances. This has been critiqued by opponents as ineffective, allowing discrimination to still occur in Japan. The mediation process also leaned on the preference of the mediator, usually influenced by traditional cultural values. Much of the lack of required actions on the part of the employers was the largest complaint levied at the law, claiming it to be ineffective as a result. Many feminists still praised the law as a step forward, as at least a framework had been passed, but were disappointed by the lack of implementation and judicial remedies.

Bell lived in the United States for many years, where he worked as an official with the International Seamen's Union. In 1894, he travelled to England on behalf of the union, to report on the Labour Electoral Association and the Independent Labour Party. While in England, he struck up a friendship with Havelock Wilson, leader of the National Sailors' and Firemen's Union (NSFU), and Wilson and Bell went on an organising tour of the UK. In 1910, Bell settled in Kingston upon Hull, where he became the NSFU's Humber District Secretary. He was adopted as an NSFU candidate for Kingston upon Hull West in 1912, but was not endorsed by the Labour Party. He also became active on the Hull Trades and Labour Council, but left during World War I in protest at the Labour Party's policy on the war. By the time an election was held, in 1918, Hull's constituencies had been redrawn, and Bell stood in Kingston upon Hull South West. He received the support of the NSFU and various other unions, and also of some shipowners. Despite some later reports, he was not accredited by the National Democratic and Labour Party, but he did receive a Coalition coupon, and is therefore often counted as a Coalition Labour candidate. He took 30.9% of the votes cast and second place in the poll. In his spare time, Bell was active in the Royal Antediluvian Order of Buffaloes, and he served as Grand A. Buffalo of England. Bell was a prominent figure at Trades Union Congress meetings. He remained a district secretary for the NSFU until his death in 1924.
