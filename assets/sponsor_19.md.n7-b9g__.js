He is perhaps best known as the author of various children's books during the 1960s, including The Adventures of Homer Fink, illustrated by Paul Galdone. In 1971, Boys' Life wrote that \\"more than a few of BL's millions of readers must be among the millions who know Mr. Offit's books for young readers: The Adventures of Homer Fink, Soupbone, Cadet Attack, and Cadet Quarterback.\\" Offit is currently the President of the Authors Guild Foundation, and teaches fiction writing at The New School, for which he was recognized in 2001 with a Distinguished Teaching Award. For decades, he has been a member of both the Century Association and PEN American Center, serving a number of terms on the latter's Board of Trustees. For 32 years, he was also curator of the George Polk Awards in Journalism. As a fixture of the New York literary scene during latter half of the 20th century, Offit befriended many of the era's most-celebrated writers, including Robert Caro, Ralph Ellison, Joseph Heller and Kurt Vonnegut. Offit, who appears at the \\"clambake\\" in Vonnegut's semi-autobiographical novel Timequake, has reminisced about their close friendship in various fora, and edited the Library of America's collection of the late author's novels and short stories. He also provided the foreword to Look at the Birdie, a volume of fourteen previously unpublished short stories by Vonnegut. Offit himself is the author of two novels, ten books for younger readers, and two memoirs. His latest book, Friends, Writers and Other Countrymen: A Memoir, describes his encounters with figures like H. L. Mencken, Robert Frost, Che Guevara, and Truman Capote. Early life Offit was born to Jewish parents, Barney Offit and Lillian Cohen, in Baltimore, Maryland. He attended Valley Forge Military Academy and College and later studied at Johns Hopkins University, where he was also editor of The Johns Hopkins News-Letter. After graduating with a B.A. in English Literature in 1950, he moved to New York City. In the early 1950s, Offit married Avodah Komito, the daughter of a civil engineer and the proprietor of the Aladdin, a Borscht Belt hotel in Woodbourne, New York. Together, the couple would have two sons, Kenneth and Michael. Career Offit began his literary career in the early 1950s as an editorial assistant at Mercury Publications and McFadden Publishers. In 1955, he became a contributing editor at Baseball Magazine, and the following year assembled The Best of Baseball, a collection of some of the publication's most celebrated stories from previous decades. During his summers he worked at the Aladdin, the hotel owned by his in-laws in the Catskills. His experiences there formed the basis of his 1959 debut novel, He Had It Made. Offit landed an appearance on Tonight Starring Jack Paar to promote the book, and though he would produce one more novel‚Äî1962's The Other Side of the Street‚Äîhe soon found greater success as a writer of children's books, which he published at a prodigious rate through the end of the decade. His stories covered topics ranging from sports to Greek mythology, and featured artwork by illustrators like Peter Burchard (Cadet Attack), Paul Galdone (The Adventures of Homer Fink), and Mercer Mayer (The Boy Who Made a Million). During this same period Offit began teaching fiction writing at both New York University and The New School. In 1972, he was appointed curator of the annual George Polk Awards in Journalism at Long Island University. In 1975, Offit began appearing with Martin Abend for a nightly op-ed debate on the 10 pm. WNEW-TV (now WNYW) newscast. \\"Professor Offit\\" represented the liberal viewpoint against the arch- conservative Abend in heated back-and-forths about social, economic, and political issues. Their debates, which often degenerated into outrageous ad hominem attacks, were said to be part of the inspiration for Saturday Night Live's \\"Point/Counterpoint\\" sketch featuring Jane Curtin and Dan Aykroyd. The Offit-Abend debates were a regular feature of the 10 o'clock news until 1985, though they were briefly revived on Channel 11 in 1992. Following the 1977 publication of a young adult novel, What Kind of Guy Do You Think I Am?, Offit took an almost twenty-year hiatus from long-form writing. He returned in 1995, however, with Memoir of the Bookie's Son, an extended reflection on his relationship with his father, a notorious Depression-era Baltimore bookie. The memoir was a hit, and was well received by critics and proclaimed \\"recommended reading\\" by The New Yorker. In 1999, Offit was awarded an honorary degree from Long Island University ‚Äì Brooklyn.

She went to London to train as a miniaturist, upon completing this training she returned to Belfast. She established herself as a professional artist by 1837. During her career in Belfast, Lamont lived at a number of addresses and lived alternately with her brothers, John, watchmaker and optician, and Dr Aeneas Lamont, surgeon. She opened a boarding and day school with a Miss Rock in 1851. The prospectus of which outlined that Lamont as an experienced tutor, with experience in England, France, and Germany. However, her involvement with the school had ceased by 1856. Lamont moved to an address on Clare St, Dublin in 1857, living there until 1859. Later in her life, she moved to England, where she became an acquaintance of Daniel Maclise, John Ruskin, and Charles Dickens. Lamont died on 28 July 1870, at Boley Hill, Rochester, Kent. Artistic work At the beginning of her career, Lamont exhibited with the Belfast Association of Artists in 1837 and 1838.

It comprises the same area as the administrative Lau District, established on 1January 2016. Originally an island, it is now part of the main Gotland island due to the isostasy. It is mostly known for the good water from the spring Lau K√§ldu.  Geography  Lau is the name of the socken as well as the district. It is also the name of the small village surrounding the medieval Lau Church, sometimes referred to as Lau kyrkby. It is situated south of Ljugarn on the east coast of Gotland, at Lau Cove (Lauviken). The area is rural with farms and a forest by the coast. , Lau Church belongs to N√§r-Lau parish in Burs pastorat, along with the church in N√§r. One of the asteroids in the asteroid belt, 10811 Lau, is named after this place.  Lau Islets  Off the coast of Lau are three islands, known as the Laus Holmar (the Lau Islets). Despite their name, they belong to the neighboring Alskog socken and not to Lau. Their names are Skarpholmen, Gr√§sholmen and Storholmen. The two first ones are owned by the Swedish government, and have been designated as bird reserves. The last one, Storholmen, is divided into allotments belonging to farms in Lau and Alskog. It is mainly used for grazing sheep. The lighthouse on Storholmen is called Storholms-Annika. When the Swedish Maritime Administration wanted to decommission it, the lighthouse was bought by the Lau Heritage Society since it was deemed vital for local pleasure crafts and fishermen. It is built on the foundation of an old sea mark and is solar-powered.  Lau Spring  The spring at Lau Hills, the Lau K√§ldu, has become a symbol for the socken. The spring is the most prominent of several sources emerging from the water-rich limestone and gravel hills of Lau. The spring was originally just some rivulets forming a brook. Later on the water was led through wood lined channels to a wooden trough. In 1918, the channels were replaced with iron pipes and a well house with a small fountain was built. A pond for watering livestock was also added. , people from all of Gotland still come to fetch the renowned water from the spring. On the east side of the Lau Hills, beside Lau K√§ldu and facing the sea is a small cave called the Godung Cave. Even though the cave is called a Stone Age cave, it is unlikely that it has ever been inhabited.  Etymology  The name Lau, in 1318 Law, means a \\"low meadow\\" or \\"meadow by water\\".  History  Lau dates back to Medieval times. It was originally part of the Burs thing, which in turn was in the southernmost of the three original districts (similar to ridings) that Gotland was divided into during the Middle Ages. In 1862, Lau became an independent municipality. In 1952, it was incorporated with Ljugarn municipality until all of Gotland became one municipality in 1971. The boatswains from Lau under the allotment system, were part of the Second Gotlandic Boatswains Company.  Isostasy  During the Stone Age, Lau was an oblong island where the inhabitants lived on the inside of the island's small points. A strait separated the Lau Island from the rest of Gotland. During the Bronze Age the isostasy elevated the land enough for a sand bank to form in the strait. The area became more populated and people settled down on the side of the island facing Gotland and along the bank. The cross roads, where the road from the island met with the road along the coast, became a hub for the Lau socken. The area was high with a good view of the surrounding area, dry but with plenty of fresh water. This is where the first buildings in Lau for worship and assembly were built. The place is just west of the present-day graveyard. It is called Stavgard, a common name for places on Gotland where meetings were held during pre-Christian time. The distribution of the farms in Lau was established during the Iron Age and has remained almost the same since then. During that time a hillfort, the remains of which can still be seen, was built at Botvidebackar on the northern tip of Lausbackars. It was protected on three sides by the steep slopes of the hill and on the fourth side was a dug moat with a bridge. During the 1890s, several of the smaller farms and fields were merged into larger units due to new land reforms.  Archeological finds and sites  There are grave mounds and stone ships from the Bronze Age in Lau. From the Iron Age, there are seven grave fields, house foundations, collapsed stone walls and groove stones. Two of the stone ships and a round grave are situated at Bandel√§ins t√§ppu on the edge of Lausbackar. They are dated from about 900 BC. south of the stone ships is a standing stone. Just north of Lau Church are the ruins from a \\"castal\\", or a defense tower. The tower was built during the 12th century, further additions to it were made during the 13th and 14th century and it is assumed that it was converted into a clergy house.

Lake K√º√ß√ºk√ßekmece () is a lagoon located between the K√º√ß√ºk√ßekmece, Esenyurt and Avcƒ±lar districts of the European portion of Istanbul Province, northwestern Turkey. The lake is neighbored in the south by state road and in the north by the motorway (European route E80). Location and characteristics Situated west of Istanbul's city center, the lake was formed in shallow water when a sandbank caused its separation from the Sea of Marmara. A narrow channel in the east interrupts this sandbank, and serves as an outlet emptying excessive water in the lake into the Sea of Marmara. However, in situations where the sea is rough or the lake's water level gets too low due to drought, sea water may penetrate into the lake, causing the lake water to become brackish. The lake is fed from the north by the Nakka≈ü, Sazlƒ±dere and E≈ükinoz streams. The lake has a length of north-south by a maximum width of . The lake's surface area is , and its maximum depth is . The lake is significantly polluted due to rapid urbanization and industrialization activities over the last decade in the area around it. Its water is currently not compliant with safe drinking water standards. Fauna observed in the lake basin consist of pygmy cormorant (Microcarbo pygmeus), great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo), and A4iii group waterbirds. Archaeological site Within the lake basin, the ancient settlement of Bathonea was unearthed, which is estimated to be approximately 1,600 years old. Such archaeological finds extracted from and around the lake shed light on Istanbul's historical chronology. The finds include stone tools indicating early agricultural activities, potsherds dating back to the Neolithic and Iron Age periods (8,000 ‚Äì 1,000 BC), amphora fragments from the Hellenistic period (fourth century BC), remains of walls along the lake shore, column capitals, and works from the Roman period. 440 small terracotta bottles in size containing tar-like fossilized material also were discovered. Vessel anchors were found in the lake and along the lake shore. In 2011, a -wide and -deep cistern was uncovered that might span . It was built with bricks bearing signs of the Emperor Constantine and a notable cleric of the time. In 2012, two underground water tunnels were discovered and subsequently, were surveyed by speleologists. They were built partly during the Roman Period and Late Roman period. Although one water tunnel is connected to the cistern, the other leads to a fountain still in use today. There are access shafts at certain points within the water tunnel. Structures in the ancient settlement, such as a lighthouse, port, and pier point toward the past existence of a port city. From observations of aerial views, evidence of previous roads arranged in a grid plan was detected. According to the results of excavations and examinations carried out between 2007 and 2009, Bathonea was destroyed by a large-scale earthquake, after which it was abandoned. An anthropological forensic study of a human skull extracted from one of the 70 historic graves in Bathonea, revealed that thousands of years ago, an attempt at brain surgery was made there.

Definitions and goals vary among transport agencies, but managed lanes are generally implemented to achieve an improved operational condition on a highway, such as improving traffic speed and throughput, reducing air pollution, and improving safety. Types of managed lanes include High-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes, High-occupancy toll lanes, express toll lanes, reversible lanes, and bus lanes. Most managed lane facilities are located in the United States, although HOV and bus lanes can be found in many other countries; outside of the US, many countries use active traffic management that manage all lanes of a highway. Definition The definition of a managed lane varies among transport agencies. The United States' Federal Highway Administration describes managed lanes as \\"highway facilities or a set of lanes where operational strategies are proactively implemented and managed in response to changing conditions\\". The FHWA notes that among US transport agencies, definitions of managed lanes contain three basic elements: *\\"The managed lane concept is typically a 'freeway-within-a-freeway' where a set of lanes within the freeway cross section is separated from the general-purpose lanes.\\" *\\"The facility incorporates a high degree of operational flexibility so that over time operations can be actively managed to respond to growth and changing needs.\\" *\\"The operation of and demand on the facility is managed using a combination of tools and techniques in order to continuously achieve an optimal condition, such as free-flow speeds.\\" The Texas Department of Transportation defines a managed lane as \\"one that increases freeway efficiency by packaging various operational and design actions. Lane management operations may be adjusted at any time to better match regional goals.\\" Typical goals and objectives for managed lanes are improved traffic efficiency, increased traffic throughput, improved safety, and reduction of pollution to meet regional air quality goals. If designed to improve travel conditions on a highway, the following types of lanes can be considered managed lanes: High-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes, tolled lanes built within or along an existing highway (express toll lanes), high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes, reversible lanes (British: tidal flow), truck lanes, interchange bypass lanes (usually for HOV, truck, or mass transit only), bus lanes, use of shoulders by traffic in certain circumstances (dynamic shoulder lanes), and dual/parallel highways of which one is managed. Managed lanes are essentially a limited application of active traffic management to only some of a highway's lanes, rather than all lanes of the highway. Reasons for managed lanes The most important prerequisite condition necessary for managed lane demand to materialize is the presence of recurring traffic congestion. Managed lanes are by definition a congestion management strategy and have benefits that are only fully realized in the context of frequent traffic congestion that causes significant travel time delays and uncertainty over trip time reliability. Although there is no broadly accepted definition of what constitutes traffic congestion, congestion is generally identified as a breakdown in the flow of traffic and a reduction in vehicle speeds caused by traffic demand approaching or exceeding available roadway capacity. These situations generally correspond to a level of service of D or worse (on a scale A-F, with A being highest) and average travel speeds of 30 mph or less, although this does not mean that other scenarios are not suitable for managed lane strategies. The specific characteristics of the traffic demand that exists in a corridor are particularly important when considering managed lane strategies. Traffic demand on urban roadways is typically variable and changes depending on the time of day, day of the week, and by season. It is common for demand in some radial corridors to be highly directional, with demand for facilities leading into a central business district often being highest in the morning peak periods and demand for outbound directions being highest in the afternoon periods. These patterns cause an imbalance of demand that require solutions that are flexible in their ability to accommodate variable and directional traffic volumes. Routes that connect suburban trips may exhibit bi-directional demand and be congested for more prolonged periods, so the selected concept needs to recognize this. Demand may exist for one particular mode, say transit for a radial corridor, and not for another. Each type of demand should be separately analyzed, even if they will share the managed lane facility. Strategies for implementation Types of managed lanes grouped by strategy and complexity Strategies for managing lanes typically fall into one of three categories. These include vehicle eligibility restrictions, access control, and pricing. Most managed lane implementation incorporate the application of multiple management strategies. In the United States, managed lanes are almost always located within the right-of-way of freeways, often on the left or \\"high speed\\" side of the mainlanes, but sometimes on the right lane or shoulder lane for short distances. Agencies often combine lane management strategies and applications of various intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and traffic control devices to address both safety and operation needs. Examples include: *Employing static signing to notify drivers of eligibility to use a dedicated lane and times indicating when restrictions are in place. *Utilizing overhead lane control signals and/or changeable message signs to accommodate highly directional demand on reversible or contraflow lanes. *Employing access treatment and lane separation strategies to manage the speed differential often associated with managed lanes. *Increasing the level of automated and on-site monitoring, enforcement and incident response capability to help assure travel time reliability and safe operations. *Implementing variable pricing through electronic tags that vary tolls by time of day or by demand to more efficiently utilize lane capacity. Although managed lanes have traditionally been added as new capacity, the concept does not explicitly require capacity expansion. Instead, the focus of managed lanes is to preserve a reliable trip that is viewed as a preferable alternative over congestion that exists in the general purpose lanes. Therefore, the correct objective for managed lanes is not necessarily congestion relief, but rather, improved management of congestion that provides relief to users and non-users. The rationale of implementation does not suggest that incorporation of managed lanes should be a stand-alone strategy. Indeed, the best applications are ones in which managed lanes are an integral component of a comprehensive congestion management program incorporating an array of other treatments and strategies. These treatments may include ramp metering, incident management, traffic demand management (TDM) such as vehicle for hire promotion, and associated programs that are both complementary and synergistic to overall regional mobility goals. For example, restricted lanes for buses and carpools only make sense and draw sufficient patronage when parallel programs including transit services, park-and-ride lots and trip matching are implemented. Ramp and connector metering offers the opportunity to provide bypass lanes for transit and other transportation modes to attract demand. The rationale for application is predicated on an understanding of the specific operational problem evidenced and forecasted to exist. The design should not define the operational need, but rather respond to the intended operation and attempt to fit within the specific corridor constraints that are often present. For example, highly directional congestion (i.e., inbound in the morning and outbound in the evening) may be addressed by a variety of different treatments such as concurrent, reversible or contraflow operations, and each will require a different design that may or may not fit within the corridor. The presence of congestion in both directions during the same daily commute may suggest only a bi-directional, concurrent flow operation (e.g., one dedicated lane operating in each direction) is appropriate. Similarly, the specific operational attributes of how many hours the managed lane is active, where access is applied and who can use it are determined in successive levels of evaluating the observed and forecast operational problems. Types of managed lanes Eligibility restrictions One of the most commonly used lane management tools for the past 40 years is restricting use based on vehicle eligibility. Eligibility can be defined in terms of vehicle type (i.e. buses, trucks, motorcycles, or hybrids) or by the number of occupants in a passenger vehicle, such as two or more (HOV 2+) or three or more (HOV 3+) in a vehicle. The latter definition represents the vast majority of managed lanes found in the US and Canada: HOV lanes. =HOV lanes= High-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes provide preferential treatment for transit, vanpools, carpools, and other designated vehicles by typically dedicating a lane or portion of the roadway for their exclusive use. The primary goal of HOV lanes is to increase the people moving capacity of a corridor and allow for more efficient use of freeways by increasing the number of occupants per vehicle. This is accomplished by providing travel time savings and reliability for high occupancy modes to incentivize carpooling and the use of transit. HOV lanes are present on more than 1200 North American freeway route-miles (1900 route- kilometers), and are by far the most common form of managed lane. All HOV lanes accommodate buses, and sometimes other vehicles such as motorcycles and hybrids since the combined demand of each of these modes can usually be accommodated by a single lane. The majority of HOV facilities exist as single lanes that are concurrent with adjacent general purpose freeway lanes. Most commonly, HOV lanes are separated from mixed use lanes by a painted stripe or buffer, although some are separated by a physical barrier, either fixed or moveable. Depending on the design, HOV lanes may have continuous access to concurrent flow lanes or traffic may only be able to enter and exit at designated access locations. Some HOV lanes are reversible to serve directional demands at different times of the day; these facilities are separated by a permanent barrier and are accessed via exclusive ramps. Contraflow HOV lanes borrow an off-peak direction lane for peak commute purposes, and they use placement of pylons or moveable barriers to safely segregate oncoming traffic flow. HOV lanes have also been added to highway onramps to bypass ramp meters, allowing HOV vehicles and buses to access the highway without queuing for the ramp meter. Such ramp lanes are known as HOV bypass ramps. =Bus lanes= A dedicated bus lane (HOV 9+) on the Gyeongbu Expressway in South Korea Bus lanes are lanes exclusively reserved for buses. A busway is a facility that is reserved for exclusive use by buses. A bus- lane, more commonly located on a major arterial or roadway on separate right- of-way, is usually a component of a bus rapid transit (BRT) system and as a result the terms bus-lane, busway, and BRT are sometimes used synonymously. However, there is a distinction between a lane dedicated to exclusive use by buses and BRT, which may include various operational improvements and station design features to provide high quality service for express bus trips. The type of service may also be substantially different, focused on limited express stops en route or point-to-point nonstop service. Bus operation needs today are normally addressed and integrated into HOV lanes on freeway corridors that experience high levels of congestion and have high use or potential for bus transit services. The purpose of bus lanes and supporting facilities (e.g., transit stations, park-and-ride lots and direct access treatments) is to provide more reliable bus service by cutting down the delay that buses would have to otherwise incur in congested traffic, thereby increasing service efficiency by allowing more peak trips by the same bus and providing patrons a faster trip. Bus-lanes on freeway corridors are usually shared with HOVs and other designated vehicles since buses generally use little capacity. An example is the I-110 Harbor Transitway that carries buses and HOV-2+ vehicles in the median of the freeway. There are six bus stations along the Transitway that serve many bus routes including a BRT route. Although the Transitway serves all types of HOVs and will soon incorporate solo vehicle pricing, it includes several sections where bus-only lanes and separate roadways into stations for buses exist. Houston has a similar approach to serving express bus transit on reversible HOV lanes and express toll lanes with direct access ramps connecting stations and park-and-ride lots. =Truck lanes and lane restrictions= Separated roadways for trucks are uncommon. One example is the New Jersey Turnpike, the northern portion of which features completely separated dual roadways, one reserved for passenger cars only, and the other open to both commercial and non-commercial traffic. Access ramps are provided to both roadways at major interchanges (Figure 12). Light trucks are considered as eligible vehicles on some HOV lanes if they carry the requisite persons. Restricted geometrics on many existing concurrent leftmost median lanes limit opportunities to serve large commercial trucks, and sight distance and other freeway lane prohibitions typically mean these vehicles cannot use leftmost lane treatments unless a separate roadway is provided with a minimum of two travel lanes. There are truck lanes on European motorways leading in and out of the ports in Rotterdam in the Netherlands. In the US, dedicated roadways for trucks are being studied and in at least several cases proposed, but no freeway examples currently exist in the US. Missouri is currently considering using dedicated roadways for trucks on I-70 across the state, and several U.S. port cities are examining truck lanes and roadways. Climbing lanes for trucks typically are built to improve safe operations on grades by separating slow moving heavy vehicles from the rest of traffic. Interstate 5 to bypass the interchange with Interstate 405 in Southern California Interchange bypass lanes for trucks have been implemented in Southern California and Portland, Oregon, to improve safety by routing trucks around a major interchange typically containing left hand ramps. This design approach improves the merge condition affecting traffic operations at the interchange. Similar ramp options are provided for trucks on this separate roadway system as are provided for the mainlanes. Far more common on US highways are lane restrictions which prohibit trucks from driving in certain lanes of a highway, typically the left-most lane. At least three travel lanes are normally needed to implement truck lane restrictions. Many US states have adopted this type of lane restriction because it promotes a more orderly mix of traffic and thereby improves throughput, increases sight distance in leftmost lanes, generally improves safety, and still permits the orderly movement of trucks. Toll managed lanes Sign for express toll lanes, compliant with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices Toll managed lanes use tolling, with electronic toll collection, to manage the traffic flow of the managed lane. The most general form of toll managed lanes are express toll lanes (ETL), which have variable tolls to maintain a higher throughput or speed in the ETL lane compared with the other lanes of the highway. ETLs are essentially access restricted tollroads within the freeway right-of-way that are actively managed to preserve free-flow operating conditions. The tolls are frequently changed to maintain a steady flow of traffic; in some cases, the goal of toll fluctuations is to maintain a minimum speed on the ETLs (e.g. 55 mph/85 km/h). As the lanes approach their capacity, tolls are increased to discourage vehicles from entering the ETLs. A common variant of ETLs are high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes. HOT lanes are free for high-occupancy vehicles, while vehicles with fewer passengers pay a toll. Some types of vehicles may be exempt from tolls, such as hybrid vehicles (including single-occupant hybrid vehicles in HOT lanes), registered carpools (on ETLs), and motorcycles. Some toll managed lanes may only be tolled at certain times or charge different rates for high-occupancy vehicles. Toll managed lanes are sometimes included in a highway reconstruction project to not only improve traffic, but also to fund the construction project itself (including improvements to existing lanes) through public-private partnerships (P3). In such highway reconstruction projects, the government transport agency tenders a P3 project in which a private consortium of companies designs, finances, and rebuilds a section of highway after which they are given a concession (e.g. 40 years) to operate the toll managed lanes, receiving fixed payouts from the relevant government transport agency for meeting performance criteria. These payments are used to repay the loans made by the private consortium, which keeps any excess as profit. Dynamic lanes The number and directionality of freeway lanes and shoulders can be dynamically managed to serve variable traffic patterns. =Reversible and contraflow lanes= Reversible HOV lanes in the center of Interstate 279 near Pittsburgh Reversible lanes and contraflow lanes are commonly employed when there is little or no available right-of-way for the width of a highway to be increased. These types of managed lanes increase the highway's capacity in the direction of the flow of these lanes, which is typically the direction of travel of the majority of traffic during peak hours (e.g. into a city center in the morning, out of a city center in afternoons/evenings). Reversible lanes along expressways are typically separated from other traffic lanes by concrete barriers and incorporate multiple gates or barriers to prevent traffic traveling in the opposite direction from entering these lanes. Contraflow lanes are typically one or two lanes on one side of a dual-carriageway on which the direction of travel is reversed during certain hours. Contraflow lanes are generally separated from opposing traffic by plastic pylons or moveable jersey barriers. A limitation of implementing a reversible flow design is that it cannot serve congestion that may be present in the off-peak traffic direction. If such is the case, then some users, such as deadheading transit buses that need trip reliability to make a second peak direction run during the commute period, will be adversely impacted. All freeway reversible lanes must be separated by \\"Jersey\\" barriers in a high-speed roadway setting (which is not the case on arterial treatments). They are typically constructed in the median of freeway facilities and may be one, two or more lanes wide. These characteristics have several associated advantages and disadvantages. A facility that changes direction to serve morning and afternoon traffic can be an efficient solution since it allocates capacity specifically to the most congested direction of travel. Reversible lanes offer a much higher guaranteed level of service for transit since side friction from adjacent traffic is removed. Some locales, notably Houston, implemented reversible lanes to address the peak direction alone since width was not available to address both directions of travel. Adapting a reversible flow lane or roadway into a freeway typically requires rebuilding most bridges with center columns. A disadvantage of reversible lanes is the ongoing cost of daily surveillance and lane/ramp reversal activities. These treatments must be designed to prevent wrong way movements, requiring extensive and redundant ITS and traffic control device treatments for each opening, plus a staff compliment who must visually inspect the roadway prior to each opening period. Tolling and enforcement is made easier by the barrier environment in which a single field location can be identified to monitor and/or toll all traffic flow. =Use of shoulders= The use of a highway's shoulder during peak hours has been implemented in some locations, both in the US and Europe. The use of shoulders as travel lanes varies in practice, including use by buses only, use as an HOV lane, use for all vehicles, and use as an ETL/HOT lane. On Massachusetts State Route 3 and I-93 and I-95 in the Boston area, all vehicles are permitted on shoulders during peak periods only. Similarly, in Virginia on I-66, the shoulder carries general purpose traffic from 5:30‚Äì11:00 AM (eastbound) and 2:00‚Äì8:00 PM (westbound); however, during this time, the interior general purpose lane is open to HOV traffic only. I-66 uses extensive traffic signals and signage in order to communicate the active times of service. In the Seattle area, the right shoulder on the US 2 trestle near Everett is opened to all traffic in the eastbound direction during the afternoon peak period. A similar operation is provided on H1 in Honolulu in the morning peak on the right shoulder. The use of freeway right side breakdown shoulders by buses is permitted in several states. The Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area has the most bus-only shoulders in the United States. Early implementations of bus-only use of shoulders in the region were limited to arterial roads, but the concept was soon expanded to freeways after they were shown to be safe and hugely successful. As of 2006, there were bus-only shoulders on freeways in the Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area. The Minnesota Department of Transportation has instituted a series of guidelines that govern the use of freeway shoulders by buses. These guidelines allow buses to use the shoulder only when mainline speeds are less than and prohibit buses from exceeding the speed of adjacent traffic by more than , up to a maximum speed of . A similar law was passed in Colorado in early 2016 for the RTD Flatiron Flyer bus route on U.S. 36 along the Denver-Boulder corridor.

It was released as a posthumous single on MGM Records in 1953. Background Although Williams had been found dead in his chauffeur-driven Cadillac on his way to a show in Canton, Ohio on New Year's Day, 1953, he was still arguably MGM's hottest act by summer; two albums were in stores by March, Memorial Album and Hank Williams as Luke the Drifter, and within ten weeks of his death he had as many albums on the market as he did when he lived, with hundreds more to follow. As biographer Colin Escott observes, \\"Hank's entire catalog began moving in unprecedented quantities...The oil well that Hank Williams became in death started to gush.\\" Like Elvis Presley over two decades later, Williams became even larger in death than he had been in life, and MGM capitalized on Hank's growing legend by exploiting the LP market and issuing its remaining Hank recordings as singles. \\"Weary Blues from Waiting\\" had likely been recorded as a demo some time in 1951. The Drifting Cowboys, most of them now working for Ray Price, were brought back to augment the recording with overdubs. While MGM would insensitively overdub strings and other accoutrements to Hank's masters as the years wore on, the results on \\"Weary Blues from Waitin'\\" were utterly convincing, and the single rose to #7 on the country singles chart. A major part of the song's success was Williams' typically heart-rendering vocal and the high quality of the composition, which contains what is cited as one of his most haunting lines: ::\\"Through tears I watch young lovers ::As they go strolling by ::For all the things that might have been ::God forgive me if I cry.\\" Although the song is copyrighted to Williams alone, it is likely that Ray Price had a hand in writing it during a car ride from Hank's Opry performance to a show in Evansville, Indiana in September 1951 (Price would record the song in a month later). The song would eventually be released in its original, undubbed form.

It was designed by Arthur Leis and built from to 1977 by Arthur Leis. It is also known as SEQ-4C 8. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 July 1999.  History  Completed in 1977 by Arthur Leis, this timber fire tower is located one kilometre west of the township of Jimna, at the top of the Jimna Range. Supported by three ironbark poles or \\"legs\\", the Jimna fire tower is the tallest fire tower in Queensland with a tower height of (pole length is ). The township of Jimna (formerly Foxlowe) was established in 1922, following the relocation from Monsildale of the sawmill operated by the firm of Hancock and Gore. Hancock and Gore had commenced sawmilling operations at Monsildale in 1912. The entire township was moved, including sawmill, houses, shop, store and school. Prior to 1935 a Forest Ranger looked after Forestry interests in the Jimna area . A nursery was subsequently established on the site of the present administration building and scrub clearing for the establishment of hoop pine plantations commenced in 1938, approximately 18 years after the commercial hoop pine plantations were established in Queensland, in the Mary Valley . Consideration had been given to the need for effective fire protection as early as 1911, when discussed at an Interstate Conference on Forestry held in Sydney that year. Various methods of fire control appear to have been applied in subsequent years, including firelines and firebreaks of fire including in hoop pine forests, and in new plantations . Such outbreaks were serious as hoop pine is particularly vulnerable to fire. In Queensland, construction of towers for fire detection commenced during the mid-1930s as part of a fire protection system which also included firebreaks . Fire towers continued to be erected as plantations were established through the 1940s and the 1950s. The area of softwood plantations increased considerably during the 1960s and the 1970s. During this period there was also a program of construction of fire towers to serve new plantation areas and 16 towers were constructed . Nearly all these new towers were over high, indicating the need to have towers taller than the surrounding plantations. By the mid-1960s some of the plantations would have been approximately 40 to 45 years old and in some areas had no doubt \\"outgrown\\" the original fire tower. Fire towers were also used in conjunction with each other to pinpoint fires by taking crossbearings between towers . Arthur Leis commenced working for the Department of Forestry in 1957. Until his retirement in 1991, Leis was responsible for the erection of over 20 fire towers in Queensland. Leis designed the towers himself, cutting all the timber on site, and usually erecting each tower with the help of an off-sider and a block and tackle. Initially Leis' towers followed conventional design, supported by four timber legs. In 1967 Leis completed the first three-legged timber fire tower to be erected in Queensland, at Mount Binga in the Yarraman Forestry District. It is generally understood that Leis was responsible for the innovative new design. In 1968 the Department reported on \\"the wisdom of converting to this type of structure. Costs per foot at $66 was about 25 per cent down on the 4-legged design, formerly adopted, and the structure is very stable and firm\\" . Leis constructed his last fire tower in 1986-87; a three-legged wooden tower at Mount Wolvi, south-east of Gympie. At the opening ceremony for the Mount Wolvi tower, the Hon. Bill Glasson, Minister for Lands, Forestry, Mapping and Surveying, presented Leis with a model of the new tower \\"in commemoration of the many wooden fire towers he [had] constructed over the past 30 years\\". In 1975-76 construction commenced on a new fire tower at Jimna which \\"would be the tallest built to date\\", with a designed height of approximately . Replacing an earlier tower, the new Jimna fire tower was erected by Leis and his son. Two ironbark logs were spliced together to make each of the three legs. To erect the tower the first leg was winched into position and the remaining two legs were hauled upright, bracing and stairs were attached, and finally the cabin constructed on top. The new tower was intended to work \\"in conjunction with existing towers in the Jimna and Gallangowan areas, [to] improve the detection of wildfire's likely to affect the extensive Hoop Pine plantations and native forests in the district\\" . The Jimna fire tower was opened in October 1977 by the Hon. Ken Tomkins, Minister for Lands, Forestry, National Parks and Wildlife. A picnic area has been established surrounding the base of the fire tower. The Jimna fire tower thresholded for National Estate social value at the Maryborough, Crows Nest and Nambour (non- Indigenous) community workshops conducted as part of the Comprehensive Regional Assessment for the South East Queensland biogeographic region Regional Forest Agreement. The tower was popular with tourists, with claims of up to 30,000 per year. However, the deteriorating condition of the tower resulted in its closure to tourists in 2006 and it was proposed to delist it from the Queensland Heritage Register. Although funding was spent on restoring the tower, in 2014 it was still judged unsafe for public access. However (in 2015) it remains listed on the Queensland Heritage register.  Description  The Jimna fire tower is located approximately one kilometre west of Jimna, on the southern side of the Kilcoy-Murgon Road. The Jimna fire tower is high (pole length is ). The tower comprises three ironbark poles in a triangular plan, which taper inwards from the base of the tower to the top of the tower. Each pole consists of two logs spliced together approximately halfway up the height of the tower, and is set into a concrete footing at the base of the tower. Poles are braced and cross-braced. The poles support a hexagonal cabin at the top of the tower, accessed by a timber staircase which wraps around the outside of the tower. The staircase includes a series of small platforms. A picnic area surrounding the base of the tower includes a car park. The toilet block has been decommissioned and the nearest public toilets are adjacent to the Jimna Hall, corner of Bellbird Road and School Road, Jimna.  Heritage listing  Jimna Fire Tower was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 July 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. As the tallest tower in Queensland, and constructed using three poles, the Jimna fire tower is a fine example of a three-legged timber fire tower. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Jimna fire tower is valued by the community as the tallest fire tower in Queensland, for the views available from the top of the fire tower, and for its construction by a father and son team. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Jimna fire tower is important for its association with Arthur Leis, who was influential in the design and construction of fire towers in Queensland from the 1960s to the late 1980s.

Williams was born in Pomfret, Conn., Nov. 5, 1779, the son of Joseph and Lucy (Witter) Williams. He entered the Freshman Class of Williams College in the fall of 1795, and continued there until March, 1798. In the succeeding fall he entered the Junior Class of Yale College, where he graduated in 1800. Before graduation he had begun to teach, and after successive engagements in Beverly, Mass , and in Woodstock and Norwich, Conn., he opened in the spring of 1803 in Boston a school for African-American pupils. While thus employed he was licensed to preach, May 17, 1803, by the Windham County Association, in order that he might officiate as chaplain in the almshouse in Boston, in connection with his other duties. Late in the same year he gave up his school, and served for some weeks as a missionary preacher in New York State. On his return, and after spending six weeks with Rev. Dr. Emmons, of Franklin, Mass, (his entire course of theological preparation), he was ordained as an evangelist, at Killingly, Conn., May 16, 1804. Two other missionary tours to New York succeeded, and in the summer of 1806 he supplied the pulpit of the Congregational Church in Branford, Conn. In January 1807, without formal installation, he took charge of the Pacific Congregational Church in Providence, R. I., where he continued until April, 1816. He was next installed pastor, Nov. 6, 1816, of the church in Foxborough, Mass., which he served for about four years. In July, 1821, he returned to his former charge in Providence, and remained with them until August, 1823. In Dec, 1823, he began to preach for the First Church in Attleborough, Mass., and was installed there Sept. 29, 1824, Dr. Emmons preaching the sermon, as well as at his former installation. From this church he was dismissed, Dec. 11, 1827; and at the same time a new church was formed in Hebronville, in the southern part of the town, of which Williams became at once the pastor, without formal installation, and so continued until April, 1830, when he removed to Providence, after which he was employed for four or five years in occasional preaching through the State From May, 1835, to March, 1838, he preached statedly to the Congregational Church in Barrington, R. I., his last regular engagement. In 1839-40 he resided in Hartford, Conn., and then for three years in East Greenwich, R. I., whence he returned to Providence, where his residence continued until his death. During all these years, until extreme old age, he was restlessly employed in his calling, preaching as he found opportunity over a wide circuit. His last appearance in the pulpit was in 1872, when in his 93rd year he died in Providence, Sept. 29, 1876, aged 97 years, lacking 36 days, of old age, with no indication of disease.

From 1907 through 1910, the design evolved into commercial production vehicles, including cars, light trucks, and buses. Background The Fiat 28-40 HP was developed from the Fiat 24-32 HP which was designed and manufactured in 1903. The redesign included lightening the frame, increasing the power of the engine, and incorporating a water-cooled brake system to address overheating issues. The design was begun as a race car and won several races in 1906 and 1907. A total of five cars were built to this purpose. The manufacturer then expanded the line to include passenger cars as sedans and coupes. The sturdiness of the chassis, coupled with the use of proven and existing technologies, led Fiat to select it as a base for its first line of commercial light trucks and buses. The autobus version was capable of carrying 14 passengers. A total of 557 vehicles were built in various configurations. Racing results In 1906, Emile Mathis won the Golden Cup in the Herkomer rally, while Vincenzo Lancia won the Gold Cup in Milan. Emile Salmson won the 322-mile race between Gothenburg and Stockholm in this vehicle in 1908.

He served in the Ottoman Army during World War I.Atiyeh, 1988, p. 250 He spent much of his early life studying Islamic theology. France gained control of Syria in 1918, establishing a mandate over the country in 1920.Moubayed, 2006, p. 367 By then, al-Ashmar became a prominent Muslim sheikh based in al-Midan. Al-Ashmar gathered about 40-50 of his men from al-Midan to form part of the civilian volunteer units backing the Syrian forces against the invading French Army at the Battle of Maysalun on 24 July.Gelvin, p. 116. According to Sami Moubayed, al-Ashmar joined Ibrahim Hananu's militia based in the region of Aleppo. Al-Ashmar was arrested in 1922 for his earlier participation in the countrywide rebellions and exiled to the southern Hauran region. He managed to return to northern Syria to partake in anti-French activities in the Syrian Coastal Mountains. He was exiled to Amman in Transjordan in 1923. Role in Great Syrian Revolt Al-Ashmar played a leading role as a commander during the Great Syrian Revolt against French rule between 1925 and 1927. He was also an early liaison between the main leader of the revolt, Sultan Pasha al-Atrash, and the notables of Damascus. He was a part of the first Damascene delegation to al- Atrash, who was based in the Hauran region, along with Nasib al-Bakri and Yahya al-Hayati.Atiyeh, 1988, p. 260 Al-Ashmar and al-Atrash were supporters of the Hashemites, who had led the Arab Revolt in 1916, ruled Syria until 1918, and were the nominal leaders of Transjordan and Iraq at the time of the 1925 revolt. Al-Atrash designated al-Ashmar as a field commander of the revolt. On 17 October 1925, al-Ashmar, along with commander Hasan al-Kharrat, led a rebel assault against the French military in Damascus. His forces set government buildings alight and took over the Azm Palace where the French High-Commissioner, Maurice Sarrail, resided, although he was not present during the assault, which left 180 French military personnel dead. Sarrail subsequently ordered a massive aerial bombardment of the city, resulting in the deaths of 1,500 people.Provence, 2005, pp. 104‚Äì105 Later that year, al- Ashmar went into exile in Transjordan to escape an arrest warrant for his alleged responsibility in the killing of five French officers. When the French Mandatory government requested that the British authorities in Transjordan arrest al-Ashmar, the British refused, citing his status as a political refugee.Barr, 2012, p. 164. He returned to Syria after a general amnesty in 1932. Role in Palestine revolt In August 1936, al-Ashmar became the second-in-command to Fawzi al-Qawuqji of an Arab volunteer force that arrived in northern Palestine to aid local peasant rebels in the Palestinian Arab revolt against British rule.Parsons, ed. Schayegh, 2015, p. 395 He commanded the Arab volunteer force's Syrian battalion between August and October 1936.Thomas, 2008, p. 381 He returned to Syria in late 1936 after a truce was reached. His was celebrated by the residents of Damascus when he arrived in the city. The British requested the French to arrest al-Ashmar for his role in the revolt, but they refused, claiming that the arrest of a popular public figure like al-Ashmar would provoke unrest in Syria. Hostilities resumed in late 1937 after Palestinian Arab objections to the recommendations of the Peel Commission, which called for Palestine's partition into Jewish and Arab states. The newly established, Damascus-based Central Committee of National Jihad in Palestine of exiled Palestinian figures under Hajj Amin al-Husseini's leadership requested that al-Ashmar, along with al-Qawuqji, lead rebel forces in Palestine in November 1937, but this effort was unsuccessful.Frisch, 2012, p. 22 Al-Ashmar still maintained involvement with the revolt from Damascus and issued fatwas sought by Palestinian rebel commanders, often Yusuf Abu Durra and Farhan al-Sa'di, for the assassination of specific local Palestinian leaders who they suspected of collaborating with the authorities.Kedourie, 2015, p. 80 Politics in Syria Upon his return to Syria, al-Ashmar agitated for the establishment of a state governed by Islamic law and free of Western influence. He became a strong supporter of the National Bloc leader Abd al- Rahman Shahbandar.Thompson, 2013, p. 265 He lent his support to Shukri al- Quwatli in the 1943 presidential elections because of the latter's promise to allow Muslim activist organizations more political freedom in return for al- Ashmar's help in gaining votes from the al-Midan quarter. Quwatli won the elections, but abandoned his promises to the Muslim activist groups, angering al-Ashmar and conservative activists throughout the country. They formed movements aimed at removing Quwatli from power and opposing his social liberalism, particularly his permission for cinemas and cabarets to open in the country.Moubayed, 2006, pp. 367-368 Al-Ashmar became a popular figure in Syria for his participation in the Syrian and Palestinian anti-colonial revolts.Thompson, 2013, p. 262 On 19 May 1944, he addressed a crowd of hundreds of conservative Syrian Muslims at the Tankiz Mosque in Marjeh Square, Damascus, strongly condemning the increasing prevalence of unveiled women, cinema and the city's hosting of a charity banquet at the French Officers' Club sponsored by the French-Christian \\"Drop of Milk\\" society and the wife of then-education minister, Nasuhi al-Bukhari. The speech inspired the crowd to demonstrate against the banquet, with the demonstrations descending into riots. Clashes between demonstrators and the police resulted in the deaths of two protesters, including a 12-year-old boy, in the al-Salihiyah quarter. Al- Ashmar was arrested and sent to the Tadmor Prison in the desert city of Palmyra the following day. The protests subsequently spread to other parts of Damascus, and also Aleppo and Homs, with participants calling for al-Ashmar's release.Thompson, 2013, pp. 262-263 President Quwatli had al-Ashmar released days later in response to the uproar. Months later, al-Ashmar strongly condemned the Quwatli administration's participation in a women's suffrage conference in Cairo, Egypt in December 1944.Moubayed, 2006, p. 368 Following Syria's independence in 1946, al-Ashmar became a supporter of the Syrian Communist Party. His backing was a major factor in the party's good performance in al-Midan during the 1954 parliamentary elections. He headed the communist Syrian Partisans of Peace and was a member of the World Peace Council. Al-Ashmar was awarded the Stalin Peace Prize by the Soviet Union in March 1956.Ginat, 2010, p. 152 He largely retired from politics around this time and died in Damascus in 1960.

The book documents the history of the Medical Committee for Human Rights (MCHR), a group of health professionals who delivered health care to wounded protesters and victims of police violence during the Civil Rights Movement and the anti-war movement in the United States in the 1960s, at a time when the health care system in the South was still segregated.Blumenthal, Daniel S.

Synopsis Physician Walter Lear founded the Medical Committee for Civil Rights (MCCR) in 1963 to address the entrenched racism in the policies of the American Medical Association (AMA) which enabled Southern states to deny African American physicians the same rights as whites. The group originally protested the AMA in Atlantic City in 1963, but widened their reach when hundreds of health professionals representing MCCR participated in the August 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. Out of this momentum, a new group, the Medical Committee for Human Rights (MCHR) was created in 1964 by Tom Levin, who was asked by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) to organize a group of health care workers to support activists during Freedom Summer in Mississippi, a ten- week effort to register disfranchised African American voters. MCHR was needed because there were few black physicians and whites would not treat the injuries of civil rights activists in Mississippi. MCHR made several discoveries while supporting activists during the Freedom Summer. They found that the public health system for African Americans was virtually nonexistent in Mississippi. Due to segregation, white physicians would not treat black patients. Most blacks had received almost no health care, and most had never visited a doctor. With access to health care so limited, MCHR was imbued with a new purpose. They became a permanent organization and founded field offices. Soon after, community health care clinics began to emerge. MCHR expanded from Mississippi into Alabama and Louisiana. Their mission expanded further, treating veterans from the Vietnam War for PTSD, and calling for a non-profit national health care system.

He has worked for several different publications, including the Chicago Reader, the Industry Standard, and the New York Times. Rivlin grew up in North Woodmere, New York and graduated from George W. Hewlett High School and Northwestern University. In addition to his work in journalism, Rivlin has written nine books. His first book, published in 1992, Fire on the Prairie: Chicago's Harold Washington and the Politics of Race, was a book about Chicago area politics that won the Carl Sandburg Award for best non-fiction book of the year. His second book, Drive By, was published in 1995 while he worked for the East Bay Express, where he served as a staff writer and then executive editor. The book was inspired by the drive-by shooting of 13-year-old Kevin Reed in Oakland, California in 1990. Rivlin examined, as he put it, \\"the human side of this country's youth violence epidemic.\\" Rivlin then wrote two books about technology, The Plot to Get Bill Gates and The Godfather of Silicon Valley. He won two Gerald Loeb Awards honoring excellence in business journalism: he earned the 2001 award in the Magazines category for the story \\"AOL's Rough Riders\\", and the 2005 award in the Deadline Writing category for the story \\"End of an Era\\". In 2010, he published Broke, USA: From Pawnshops to Poverty, Inc. ‚Äî How the Working Poor Became Big Business, which The New Yorker's James Surowiecki described as a \\"blistering new investigation of the subprime economy.\\" In it, Rivlin explored how payday lenders, pawn shops, and check cashers exploit the impoverished in the United States. Despite attempting to remain objective, he sided with the activists who tried to rein in on the most usurious practices.

He is said to have been \\"'untameable as a child\\", and to have \\"died in mysterious circumstances\\" after a boating accident in the Salcombe estuary. He is known for the Penhale trilogy of novels based in 18th-century Cornwall. Personal life Crosbie was born in Mount Vernon, Newlyn, Cornwall to Norman Garstin and Louisa ‚ÄòDochie‚Äô n√©e Jones. He was the eldest of three children; Denys (later Denis) (1890 ‚Äì 1918) and Alethea (1894 ‚Äì 1978). He was educated at Brandon House, Cheltenham, Elstow School, Bedford and in Germany. He was head- boy of his school due to sporting prowess in rugby union and swimming. As a young man he travelled and worked as a bronco buster in Montana, United States and as a lumberjack in Canada. He also travelled to China, Hawaii, Japan and Morocco. On returning home his father, fed-up with Crosbie's inability to get suitable qualifications and hold down a job, sent him to South Africa. From 1912, he ran a cattle ranch in Bechuanaland, and acted as a bush ranger to the Tati Concessions. With the outbreak of the First World War he came back to Britain and in October 1914 joined B Squadron of King Edward's Horse as a private. The cavalry regiment, which was open to colonials, was initially based in Watford and in the following spring, Bishop's Stortford. The regiment left for France on 21 April 1915 and Garstin was promoted to lance corporal shortly before leaving. He was commissioned on the battlefield as a 2nd lieutenant on 14 September 1915, and joined C Squadron, which was attached to the 47th (London) Division at N≈ìux-les-Mines and was involved in the Battle of Loos and on the Italian Front. In 1916 he was posted to Dublin as an Intelligence Officer during the rebellion there. As well as writing poetry he made contributions to Punch which were well received. Garstin disappeared when returning from a party to a friend's yacht Osprey in the Salcombe estuary on 19 April 1930. The rowing boat capsized and his body was never found despite Garstin being a strong swimmer and other two occupants of the boat surviving. He left an estate of gross value ¬£3,424, and ¬£1,549 net.

It was built in 1930s. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 November 2008.  History  Jimna Single Men's Barracks in Tip Road constructed at Jimna, north of Kilcoy, demonstrate the development of the timber industry in southern Queensland. The Jimna Single Men's Barracks is a remnant of the accommodation for workers in this privately operated timber town. The barracks provided accommodation in a remote location for timber workers and demonstrates the principal characteristics of workers' accommodation. It has a strong association with the Hancock and Gore Ltd, a major Queensland timber firm, which operated the timber town of Jimna from 1922 for approximately 50 years while milling timber obtained from native forest, then forestry plantations, around Jimna. By the turn of the 20th century the most desirable timbers in the easily accessible coastal areas of southeast Queensland were heavily depleted and the main focus of activity was moving inland. The opening of the Kilcoy railway line between Caboolture and Woodford in 1909, which was extended to Kilcoy in 1913, stimulated more timber-getting and sawmilling along its route and in forested areas within travelling distance of the railhead. The siting of Jimna conformed to a number of criteria for establishment of sawmilling townships. Jimna is situated on the Jimna Range approximately above sea level on the western side of Yabba Creek about from Kilcoy. Proximity to the Kilcoy branch line made timber-felling and sawmilling there viable. According to E.S. Hancock of Hancock and Gore Ltd. bush sawmills were set up because royalties for the timber were assessed on the basis of the cost of extraction of logs to the nearest railway siding plus freight to the market, which was either a provincial city or Brisbane. When the logs were converted to timber in the country there was a saving in freight because, in the case of pine, there was a loss of approximately 25 per cent in sawdust and edging, and in hardwood a 50 per cent loss. Consequently, the saving in freight costs to market by railway, although not equivalent to the sawdust reduction was attractive. Furthermore, sawmill settlements were placed close to well-timbered forests on a site with a good water supply. Hancock and Gore Ltd evolved from the firm Hancock Brothers Ltd sawmillers and timber merchants, established at North Ipswich in 1872 by Thomas Hancock. Born in Cornwall in 1816, Hancock came to Queensland via Sydney with his three sons and one daughter. He started a steam sawmill at the Rosewood Scrub and later opened a timber yard in North Ipswich and a small mill in Canning Street, Ipswich. When Thomas Hancock retired in 1884 the firm was taken over by his sons, Josiah and Thomas, jnr. The firm of Hancock and Gore was established in 1898 and converted to a limited liability company in 1904. Under the managing directorship of Josias Henry Hancock, grandson of the founder, the company expanded rapidly. It built mills at 13 rural centres in Queensland, five locations in Brisbane and at Rosebery and Lismore in New South Wales. In 1911 the firm moved to its Ipswich Road, Brisbane headquarters. In this period, sawmilling commenced at Monsildale in the Upper Brisbane Valley where in 1912 Hancock and Gore Ltd built a new mill on land rented from James Horne. The company's business interests expanded to include a case mill in Ipswich Road, Brisbane , a ply mill and a hot press for plywood manufacture in the 1930s. The company became Australia's largest producer of plywood by 1945. Hancock and Gore continued to grow and expand to include the businesses: Brown & Broad, the Timber Corporation Ltd, The Rosebery Sawmilling Co, Cypress Timbers Ltd, Burts Transport Ltd, and Hancock and Gore Homes Ltd; forming the largest timber organisation in Queensland . In 1981 the company was taken over by Takone Pty Limited. Established in 1922, Jimna resulted from the relocation from Monsildale (seven miles away) of the sawmill, 16 houses, shop, store and provisional school. In 1922 the Jimna area was called Foxlowe the name purportedly given by George Byrne who had selected land along Yabba Creek in 1878. It was renamed Jimna by the GPO Department when naming the post office of the township between 1924 and June 1926. The removal and relocation of buildings from Monsildale occurred over a period of a few months. The first residents arrived to occupy the houses in August 1922. By November the mill was in working order and commenced cutting timber to be used for the construction of new houses and repairs to the old ones brought from Monsildale. In the same month, the store and butcher's shop were removed from Monsildale to Foxlowe and opened for business immediately. Growth of Jimna township ensued over the next few decades. The population in 1924 was about 150 including 65 children, of whom 35 attended the provisional school. This school was replaced by a state school in 1934. Jimna expanded to a population of over 300 after re-forestation around Jimna commenced in the 1930s. Its population was at its highest when both pine and hardwood mills operated at Jimna, after 1943. The settlement had its own tennis and cricket club and a local hall was the venue for dances and religious services. The township was self-contained with Hancock and Gore supplying meat from their own fattening paddocks and slaughter yards. Bullock teams at Hancock and Gores sawmill, Jimna, circa 1928 The entire Jimna operation including timber cutters was controlled by Hancock and Gore Ltd. Once re-erected in 1922, the mill at Jimna was enlarged and in 1924 it was capable of turning out 80,000 super feet of sawn pine weekly. Initially the mill cut only hoop pine using steam-driven saws. In 1933 the Architectural and Building Journal of Queensland reported that Jimna Mill milled approximately of logs into wide boards and building timbers each day while the top logs were milled into case timber. At Brisbane the building timbers were planed on Hancock and Gore's planning machines and manufactured into all kinds of building timbers including lining boards and flooring. The case timbers were re-sawn and manufactured into butter boxes, jam cases, fruit cases, kerosene cases etc. Specially selected logs were transported to Brisbane for manufacture into \\"Bull-dog\\" plywood and Hancock and Gore Ltd high class joinery. Bringing timber to the mill were 15 bullock teams and 11 lorries, while five lorries delivered the sawn and seasoned timber to Kilcoy railway station for transportation to Hancock and Gore establishments in Brisbane. The record for the greatest daily output of pine was 48,000 super feet in 8 hours and for 10 hours work on the same day the cut was 64,500 super feet. The area around Jimna was predominantly rainforest, thick with hoop pine when the Hancock and Gore mill commenced operations in 1922. This valuable resource was eventually cut out. Jimna became the site of reforestation experiments when a Forest Ranger was sent to Jimna to establish a nursery located on the site of the present forestry administration building. The establishment of hoop pine plantations in the region began in 1938. Concerns about the depletion of native timbers in the period leading up to the 1930s led to the establishment of plantation forestry in south-east Queensland. As early as the late 19th century, it had become clear that the logging of native timbers at its current rate was unsustainable. The Queensland Acclimatisation Society and sawmillers such as William Pettigrew were among those calling for better management of the colony's forests. Various attempts to regulate timber-getters proved unsuccessful and by 1906, cedar was virtually extinct in south east Queensland. In 1897, in a bid to improve forest management, amendments were made to the Crown Lands Act which allowed for the proclamation of State Forests and in 1900 a Forestry Branch was created in the Department of Public Lands to continue reservation of well- timbered lands where necessary. From 1905, a policy of setting aside land for managed forests began to be pursued on the recommendations of the Forestry Branch. However, tension continued to persist between the advocates of forest conservation and interests associated with agriculture, pastoralism and timber industries both inside and outside of government. Progress was made when Norman William Jolly, appointed as Director of Forests in 1910, recognised the urgent need for regeneration of native forests and for plantations of native and exotic timbers. He established a number of experimental stations and conducted experiments with the natural and artificial regeneration of hoop, bunya, cedar and exotics. Plantation forestry began in earnest during the tenure of Jolly's successor, Edward Swain (1918‚Äì1932). Swain established the State's first commercial plantations in 1920 to 1921, planting native seedlings in the Mary Valley, Atherton and Fraser Island. An independent Forestry Department was created in 1924, with much of its workforce supplied from returned soldiers employed under a Federal Government subsidy. A comprehensive survey of remaining forests was conducted by the Forestry Department in the 1920s. It was clear that more State Forests would be needed and also substantial plantations of exotic pines. With the exception of hoop pine, native timbers did not do well in plantations. During the 1930s and 1940s upgrading and expansion of the Jimna sawmill continued. In 1935 when an electric planing machine was installed, a generator was used as the power source. It was also utilised to supply homes and streetlights with power. The planer was closed in 1942 to concentrate on timber for the war effort. In 1943 a hardwood mill was started. When the pine mill burned down in 1947 it was immediately re-built with much more modern machinery. Thinnings from the Forestry Department's hoop pine plantations were first milled at Jimna in 1947 or 1948. The Forestry Department maintained a presence in the area thereafter. Upgrading of machinery and power sources continued into the 1960s. The Jimna mill closed in the early 1970s when it became more economical for the company to transport logs to mills on the coast than keep the sawmill operating. The mill was dismantled in the mid-1970s and thereafter the store, butcher and baker shops and post office closed as the workforce left. Where houses were occupied the Forestry Department offered to transfer the occupation leases to the occupants. Unoccupied houses were demolished or burned and almost half the buildings in the town disappeared. In 1984 the Forestry Department offered to freehold property and most residents purchased their houses. In 2007, the remaining evidence of the town's 50-year history as a timber-milling settlement are the Single Men's Barracks with associated cookhouse; some houses for married workers in Dingo Parade, which was previously known as Honeymoon Avenue; the store, which has been altered significantly; the provisional school and state school buildings; the community hall; married men's quarters that date from 1957 or 1958 and have been relocated; and the concrete slab and mountings of the generator that powered the mill. Some changes to the Single Men's Barracks have occurred over time. The original verandah is now only partly enclosed with windows, has been divided in two with a wall and door, and has had a store room erected at its eastern end. Openings have been made between a number of single rooms to allow them to operate as flats. A small, northern deck has been added and can be accessed from one of the newly created flats or suite of rooms. Underneath, steel support columns with individual pad footings have been installed; except for at the eastern end the building where concrete block has been used to enclose a number of wet service rooms. The cookhouse does not appear to have been altered significantly, other than to have the original range removed and another installed. The garden and fence to the southern facade of the barracks building has been altered since 1984, as the only close-up photographic evidence reveals. Without any evidence from historical records, dating the building by its fabric alone is difficult, but it is most likely to have been erected between late 1922 when the sawmill began operation and the beginning of WW II. This estimate is based on its overall form, which features an enclosed verandah and a single roof over the entire structure; and the use of a single skin of fibrous cement sheeting on internal partition walls; as well as a number of elements believed to be original: the style of the casement windows with a number of lights and a predominance of mottled glazing, and the dark brown Bakelite electrolier light fittings (lights and adjacent cord- operated switch fixed to ceiling on timber board). Such an estimate would place the construction of the barracks at a time when the mill's operations was expanding in the 1930s and 40s.  Description  On the Jimna Range, in the northern part of the Jimna State Forest, the Single Men's Barracks and cookhouse site is approximately north from the turn-off to the Kilcoy-Murgon Road and approximately east of the Jimna Fire Tower (which is also heritage- listed). The barracks building and its associated cookhouse occupy the eastern end of a 5408 square metre allotment in Tip Road on the northern edge of the remnant township of Jimna. At the western end of the long, rectangular allotment are a collection of other timber buildings, two of which are reputed to be married quarters shifted from another location within the settlement. They include at least one permanent dwelling, a shed and attached carport, and a fenced chicken run built around a mature bunya pine. Access to the site is from the adjacent allotment to the south. The line of the barracks and cookhouse sits perpendicular to the slope of a grassed hillside that falls to the north and a valley line that would connect with Yabba Creek to the east. The Single Men's Barracks is a gable-roofed structure, approximately long and wide, which is raised off the ground on steel columns except at the eastern end where a set of understorey rooms, taking advantage of the slope of the ground, have been enclosed in concrete block and founded on a slab. The cookhouse sits approximately away at the barracks' eastern, short end, its floor about level with that of the understorey rooms. To the south-east of this there is a timber-clad shed, caravan and rough-sawn timber-framed shelter with corrugated iron roof. Amidst these structures stand three mature bunya and hoop pine trees. Between the southern facade and site boundary is a grassed and fenced yard with maintained garden beds that, according to photographic evidence has been formed after 1984. The boundary fence is timber and parts are reputedly made of reclaimed cedar posts. To the south in the adjacent allotment the remains of the sawmilling town's ant-bed tennis court are visible.  The barracks  The gable roof of the barracks is clad in corrugated iron; however its ridge line is not symmetrically disposed over the building, being approximately from the northern facade. The pitch of both roof faces is approximately 11 Degrees. The walls are clad in weatherboards. A semi-enclosed verandah stretches the full length of the building on its southern side. To the height of the timber handrail, which is approximately , it is clad in weatherboards, while above this it is partially enclosed with a variety of windows, including timber-framed casements and aluminium-framed sliders. The verandah can be accessed at two points: via a small, timber ramp on the western facade and from timber stairs, approximately wide, positioned in the centre of the southern facade. A recent metal roof shelters these stairs, and a set of timber-framed, 10-light double doors open into the verandah at the head of them; while a high- waisted timber door provides access from the ramp. A corrugated iron tank on a low, timber-framed tank stand is positioned adjacent to the door on the western facade. Between these two features a series of cuts in the weatherboards correspond to the internal width of the verandah. The eastern facade to the cookhouse has no openings, although it also has a series of consecutive cuts, which have been covered by metal plates, in an upper section of the weatherboard cladding. What these cuts in the weatherboarding means is unclear, as there are no close-up photographs of the building taken prior to 1984. There are twelve openings on the northern facade. The original rhythm of six sets of two has been maintained, although the fourth from the west has been formed into a door to give access to a small timber deck. This door and the two windows toward the west belong to a set of later additions, the former being timber-framed and painted white and the latter two being aluminium-framed casements. The remaining windows are merely openings that are sealed with flyscreen and can only be closed by bringing down the timber awning shutters, which are propped open with pieces of timber dowel. Running off the verandah, on the northern side of the barracks building, the demarcation of twelve small rooms can still be easily discerned, despite a number of openings being made to allow access between them. These rooms are approximately deep and wide, and all except one have a floor to ceiling height of . The verandah has been partitioned by a wall with a board door, the western end serving the first four rooms and the eastern end the remaining eight. The outer walls in both sections are unlined, while the opposing ones are clad in weatherboards. The floors are made with wide timber boards that are carpeted in places, and the ceiling is unlined. The first room at the westernmost end of the building is used as a laundry and the framing of the walls, and the roof as there is no ceiling, is visible here. The wall studs are housed or notched directly into the end rafter and there is a ridge beam and widely spaced battens. Openings have been made into the shared walls to allow Room Numbers 2, 3, 4 and 5 (refer sketch plan drawing below) to operate as a flat for the owner of the barracks building, containing bath, bed, and living rooms as well as a kitchen. The walls and ceilings of all twelve rooms in the barracks are clad in fibrous cement sheeting. Those on the northern and southern sides have timber cover strips. Those shared are single-skin, with exposed timber framing decorated with rounded cover strips, on each face. Any later openings between rooms have been kept within this framing grid, where the single horizontal rail is approximately from the floor. Room Numbers 10, 11 and 12 have been joined in a similar way with a small store room having been installed at the easternmost end of the verandah. In addition Room Numbers 8 and 9 have been joined. The internal linings, rails and cover strips have been painted. In the understorey rooms, at the eastern end of the building, the floor framing is visible, revealing that the wall studs are housed or notched into the bearers, requiring the floorboards to be fitted around them. Much of the timber framing and cladding in the barracks building bear the marks of a circular saw. The studs to the internal partition walls bear on the floorboards. There are two types of timber casement window, which are likely to be original. The only close-up photograph of the barracks was taken in 1984 when the property was purchased by its current owner. It is after this time that changes have been made to suit their personal requirements. The first window type is divided by mullions into four equal lights of mottled glazing. The second is divided in half, and then the upper section has two narrow lights in its lower half. These are clear glazing while the other two are mottled.  The cookhouse  The cookhouse is rectangular in plan, approximately to the east and west, and in the opposite direction. It is clad entirely in corrugated iron, which on the walls is fitted between large undressed timber posts and continues to the underside of the ceiling joists, leaving a narrow gap. The eaves are unlined. The corner posts at the eastern end are notched to take horizontal timber wall members. A narrow section of roof, approximately from the ground and running along the cookhouse's eastern end, projects approximately one metre above the remaining skillion roof to form a chimney for the range inside. A large sliding, corrugated iron-clad door takes up the entire western facade to the barracks to a height of approximately . It runs on a metal head track, and when open, projects past the northern facade of the structure. There is a timber-framed awning window in the southern facade. There are no openings on the eastern facade. To the north, there is a single board door and narrow fixed window. A set of logs and large rocks form a number of steps away from this door. A large corrugated iron tank and timber- framed stand sits adjacent to the cookhouse to the north. On the interior, the cookhouse is a single room with unlined walls. Along the eastern wall are two Crown cast-iron ranges, the one in the middle being used when the sawmilling township was operational, having been moved from the boarding house. It is supported at each end on half-height brick walls. A tubular, metal flue sits at its rear. The floor is brick with some patchy carpeting. Around the walls a concrete edge-beam that rises above the floor level by approximately is visible. The walls, particularly those on the east where the range is situated, are covered in blackened grease and smoke residue.  Heritage listing  The former Jimna Single Men's Barracks was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 November 2008 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Jimna Single Men's Barracks () is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland history relating to the timber industry in southern Queensland, which was the most productive timber-getting region in the State. Jimna demonstrates the phase of inland timber-getting after the easily accessible coastal softwoods were depleted in the 19th century. Dating from 1922 Jimna was one of the sites of timber retrieval facilitated and intrinsically linked to branch rail line development. Jimna Single Men's Barracks demonstrates the practice by private companies involved in the removal and milling of Queensland timbers from native and later plantation forests of providing the infrastructure, in particular accommodation, of inland timber towns built around mill sites. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Jimna Single Men's Barracks, is a remnant of a privately operated timber town, a form of settlement which was once common but has been almost entirely dismantled. The barracks is a rare example of workers' accommodation provided by a private timber company. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Jimna Single Men's Barracks is representative of the infrastructure of private timber towns. It is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of the accommodation that was created for the express purpose of housing unmarried timber workers in remote locations. Its features include: a long, gable-roofed timber building containing a row of single rooms serving as men's sleeping quarters and opening onto a building-length verandah, and an intact and distinctively formed cookhouse framed with timber and clad in corrugated iron. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The Jimna Single Men's Barracks has a strong association with the company, Hancock and Gore Limited, once one of Queensland's largest timber firms, which established the township at Jimna in 1922 for the express purpose of timber retrieval and milling, and which also provided accommodation and services for its employees; functions which continued for approximately 50 years.

He attended lectures at Berlin and Vienna, but did not graduate. He returned home in 1864, where he was named a judge at the Ia»ôi tribunal. He gradually advanced to become a member of the appeals court as well as general prosecutor. A member of the Conservative Party, he was Prefect of Ia»ôi County under the LascƒÉr Catargiu government (1871-1876), resuming this office in March 1888.

In February, 2019, the DNA Doe Project announced they had made a tentative identification, but his name is being withheld until law enforcement can confirm an identification.  Discovery  The nearly complete skeleton was found by a hunting party at approximately 9:00 AM within private property alongside the creek, in a remote, densely wooded 100-acre area owned by the hunters. The skeleton was mostly complete and articulated, lying on its belly, with its hands over the head while the head and back were partially covered by a denim jacket. The body still wore age-fitting clothes, save for a shoe, and was located on a steep embankment, ten feet from the creek and four feet from the barbed wire fence of the property. It was initially estimated that the deceased died in the fall or winter of 1994, about one year before he was found, but later comparisons with more modern forensic facility research suggested that he may have died in the summer of 1995, around five months before his discovery. The cause of death is currently unknown, as no signs of trauma were found on the skeleton: a homicide was deemed unlikely, and no other causes could be determined. Analysis of his hair found no conclusive traces of cocaine, codeine or morphine, making it unlikely that he had a long-term opioid addiction; however, this does not exclude the possibility that he was intoxicated or that he took hallucinogenic drugs before his death. It was commonly believed that he died from hypothermia from getting soaked in the creek, perhaps after getting intoxicated and becoming disoriented as a result. The skull was cremated while the rest of the skeleton was buried in Johnstown Center Cemetery, Rock County, Wisconsin. His DNA and dental records were available.  Physical description  The Caucasian male stood approximately 66, or between 5 feet 4 inches or (1.65 m) and 5 feet 6 inches (1.70 m). His weight was estimated to be approximately 140 lb (64 kg). He was estimated to be between 17 and 20 years old. He had straight teeth and seemed to have received good dental care with only one or two fillings, and still had his wisdom teeth, with two having partially erupted and one being impacted. The decedent wore a T-shirt with the trademarked logo of the British heavy metal group Venom on the back, which contained a golden five-pointed star surrounded by a circle with a goat head at the center and the caption \\"Welcome to hell\\" (the shirt was a model sold at their 1987 tour); gray urban camouflage fatigues of small/medium size; a lined flannel red and green jacket with a plaid design; size medium/34 boxer underwear with a Bart Simpson design; and a 1993 size 9-1/2 Black Nike Air Bound basketball shoe. Only one of the shoes were found at the site, lying near the skeleton. The young man carried a distinctive pendant made from a dinner fork, shaped like the head of a goat. Other items found with the body were cigarette butts, a Budweiser disposable butane lighter with the caption \\"Proud to be Your Bud\\" printed on it, a tube of Carmex lip balm, and a black Aquatech watch. His clothes, pendant and hair suggest that he was a heavy metal music aficionado and, as such, familiar with metal subculture, but investigations in the local metal circles did not bring conclusive results about his identity. Several facial approximations were publicly released over time. The first reconstruction released by Project Edan in 2013 was considered to be inaccurate by authorities. The second reconstruction released in 2014 by the FBI was considered by official agencies to be the most accurate to date, depicting a 20-year-old youth with collar long, dark feathery hair and high cheek bones. A third, colored and age- regressed version of the FBI approximation, regressed to approximately age 16, was released to the public in February 2016 to help identification. Investigation 1994 Eyewitness sketch of the man dubbed \\"River Guy\\", possibly the same man as ‚ÄúJohn Clinton Doe\\".  \\"River Guy\\"  Several witnesses remember seeing, on October 16, 1994 around 5:30 PM, a young man in his early twenties near the same area where the body was found. The man, who was wearing similar clothing as found with John Clinton Doe, was seen running and stumbling in Turtle Creek, visibly intoxicated and distraught. Dubbed \\"River Guy\\" by local investigators, he was reported by witnesses to have fallen in the water two or three times, trying to climb up the embankment and yelling at bystanders, telling them to get away from him. He also mentioned being wronged by a woman named Mary and being a fugitive. He was then seen sitting on the creek bank after his ramblings. Contrary to the FBI approximation of JCD, the 1994 police artist facial composite of \\"River Guy\\" shows him as having a light beard. It was commonly believed by those close to the case that River Guy and John Clinton Doe were the same person. However, this hypothesis was challenged by the later forensic estimations based on body decomposition rates that JCD may have died later than originally determined, as late as May, 1995. As such this new range of the possible time of death (as late as the spring of 1995) did not correspond as closely with the date of \\"River Guy\\" sightings.  The pendant  In 2010, the distinctive goat pendant was traced by the Rock County Sheriff's detective working the case to a Janesville area craftsman. Active in the local metal scene, the man claimed to have made the pendant as well as sold or given similar items to a dozen people. However none of these people could be traced back as John Clinton Doe.  Isotopic analysis  Isotopic analysis of the bones conducted in 2014 with the help of Smithsonian Institution scientists showed that the young man was from or had spent a significant amount of time in the Midwestern area, around the Great Lakes, which includes the states of Wisconsin, Illinois, Minnesota and Michigan. This, with the provenance of the goat pendant leads investigators to believe that the decedent was not living very far from where he was found.  DNA Genealogy  At the request of the local law enforcement, in 2018 the DNA Doe Project took on case in collaboration with NCMEC, Fulgent Genetics, Aerodyne Research Inc., and Full Genomes Corporation and attempted to identify the body by using autosomal DNA, the web site GEDmatch and genetic genealogy to trace relatives. In February 2019, the DNA Doe Project announced they had identified John Clinton Doe. His name was not released immediately pending announcement by the Rock County Sheriff's office.

The organisation is made up of mainly ethnic Afar people, and was founded in early 1999 following a revolt by the Red Sea Afar people led by Ahmed Humed, after the UN-supervised Eritrean independence referendum was held in 1993. The primary goal of RSADO is to achieve autonomy for the region known as Dankalia, inhabited mainly by the Red Sea Afar. RSADO is also a member of the Eritrean Democratic Alliance (EDA), a coalition of 11 Eritrean political organisations attempting to overthrow Eritrean president Isaias Afwerki's regime. History Following the independence of Eritrea in May 1991, indigenous Afar started to face unprecedented persecution by the totalitarianhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/06/12/the- brutal-dictatorship-the-world-keeps-ignoring/ one-party government of the People‚Äôs Front for Democracy and Justice led by Isaias Afwerki. The government of Eritrea began systematically removing the Red Sea Afar from their ancestral homeland, robbing them of their indigenous identity, denying them the rights to own and live off their traditional land and territories, destroying the basis of the Red Sea Afar economies such as fishing and animal husbandry, and confiscating Afar businesses. The rule of Shabia was unreservedly welcomed by the Kebesa community while the bulk of Muslims were skeptically watching the situation and wishing that Shabia would rise up to the occasion and their fears would be proved wrong. They adopted a wait and see attitude giving the regime the benefit of doubt, but the regime did not attempt to take advantage of the opportunity and win back their trust or play down their fears and suspicions. The regime lost no time in exposing its partisan and partial nature totally ignoring their feelings. The regime went on harassing, imprisoning and purging citizens who dared to stand for their basic rights or even at a mere suspicion that they entertain such thoughts. This vindicated the worst fears that haunted the Muslims ever since Shabia's control of power. This combined with dissatisfaction over the ruling PFDJ government led to a rebellion by the Red Sea Afar in Southern Eritrea in 1995, led by Ahmed Humad. The group used guerrilla war tactics and launched attacks in Eritrea. Though they posed great problems for the Eritrean government and army, it was also facing internal political conflicts in the very late 1990s.

National Kitchens were restaurants established in a British Government initiative during the First World War to feed people cheaply and economically, at a time when food supplies were scarce because of the German U-boat campaign. History Before the outbreak of war in 1914, the United Kingdom relied on imported food to feed the population; as much as 60 percent of food stocks had come from abroad. In wartime, the increased costs of shipping together with a complete lack of any government controls led to a rapid rise in the price of food, especially meat and bread. In addition, the Imperial German Navy had launched an unrestricted submarine blockade; in April 1917, a record 550,000 tons of shipping had been sunk.Doyle, Peter (2012), First World War Britain, Shire Books (p. 41) During the first years of the war, voluntary organisations began to open \\"communal kitchens\\" in various parts of the country. However, their public image was dreadful and only the poorest people made use of them. One government official stated: \\"It was thought that Public Kitchens were to be inflicted on the poor as some kind of punishment for a crime unstated\\". The newly created Ministry of Food adopted the idea of community kitchens but realised that they would have to be much better presented.Barnett, L Margaret (1986) British Food Policy During the First World War, Unwin Hyman, (pp. 151‚Äì152) According to historian Bryce Evans, the government was highly sensitive to possible criticism of the National Kitchens as being soup kitchens. The Ministry of Food Control stated that the National Kitchens \\"must not resemble a soup kitchen for the poorest section of society\\" and should instead be places for \\"ordinary people in ordinary circumstances\\". A meal of soup, meat and vegetables was available for as little as sixpence, equivalent to roughly ¬£1 today. However, in some kitchens there was nowhere to sitTeasdale, Vivien, Huddersfield in the Great War, Pen & Sword (2015), and in others patrons had to bring their own mugs and plates. To further distance them from charitable canteens, the kitchens were run in a businesslike manner: in at least one kitchen it was possible to \\"buy your Sunday dinner on Saturday\\"; the ability to show the means to pay for a meal in advance, and to make reservations as at a restaurant, would contribute to the image that the Kitchens were for \\"ordinary people.\\" The first National Kitchen was opened by Queen Mary in Westminster Bridge Road, London, on 21 May 1917.Beckett, Ian Frederick William (2006), Home Front 1914-1918: How Britain Survived the Great War, The National Archives, (p. 124) By late 1918 there were 363 National Kitchens. The kitchens were partly funded by the state and could typically feed up to 2,000 people per day. They were mainly staffed by volunteers, particularly well-to-do women who were anxious to \\"do their bit\\" for the war effort; serving in the kitchens became known as \\"canteening\\".Doyle p. 44 A typical menu comprised: * soup * roast meat * meat pies * fish * suet puddings * milk puddings * scones * cakes * Angel Delight * Yorkshire puddings List of National Kitchens * Chelmsford, Market PlaceSwan, Jonathan, Chelmsford in the Great War, Pen & Sword (2015), pp. 204‚Äì205 * ChelseaGosling, Lucinda.

She plays for Aydƒ±n B√ºy√ºk≈üehir Belediyespor, and is the first non-caucasian player to be a part of the Netherlands women's national volleyball team. Personal Plak was born in Tuitjenhorn, daughter of Surinamese kickboxing world champion Kenneth and Dutch volleyball player Karin. She has a younger brother, Fabian, who also plays volleyball. Plak went to the Johan Cruyff College in Nijmegen. Plak is a fan of Anouk, with her favourite songs being \\"Nobody's Wife\\", \\"Good God\\" and \\"Down and Dirty\\". Career Plak was first taken by her mother to the volleyball school she worked in at the age of 6. When she was 10, she was invited to join the Nederlandse Volleybal School, and after two months there, Plak left the selection because she thought she was not good enough. After retreating to local club De Boemel, a few months later her former coach visited her matches during the national Dutch youth championships in Sneek. He was impressed and convinced her to come back as she had a good chance to make it to the national elite team. Plak eventually was accepted into the Dutch youth national team, the Jeugd Oranje (Orange Youth) in 2009, at the age of 13. Her coach said Plak would become the first black player in the Dutch national team, which she achieved in 2013, debuting at the FIVB World Grand Prix. As an intern for the Orange Youth, Plak lived at the national sports centre in Papendal, only returning home during weekends. After playing a year with the first division (eerste divisie) club Dinto in Warmenhuizen, the Dutch federation advised her to start playing for a team in the highest division (eredivisie). She could choose between Weert and Alterno Apeldoorn. Because she wanted to stay at Papendal, where she attended Johan Cruyff College in Nijmegen, she chose Alterno. She was sixteen years old than. Plak still had to travel a lot, especially in the weekends when Alterno played matches on both Saturdays and Sundays. During these weekends she could stay at the home of the assistant coach a former international player, together with her husband and three children. Later she got her own room in the house and sometimes she stayed there six days a week. After many years ignoring offers by foreign teams, during a 2014 FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship qualification match in Croatia, Plak was seen by manager Donato Saltini. He helped her to an international club: Volley Bergamo in Italy, for which she started playing in the 2014‚Äì15 season. She moved to Bergamo where she had an appartement near the city.

He displayed an early aptitude for art and, although his father died in 1871, the following year, with the consent of his mother, he was able to go to Italy, where he studied with Antonio Ciseri in Florence.Biographical notes @ Fundaci√≥n Konex. He returned to Argentina in 1883, set up a workshop in the family home and soon became identified with a group of artists who would later become the founders of \\"El Ateneo\\", an artistic salon that also involved writers and musicians. These artists included the painters , Eduardo S√≠vori, Ernesto de la C√°rcova and Reynaldo Giudici, as well as the sculptors and . In 1893, this group began Argentina's first regular art exhibitions. At first, he concentrated on portraits.

Before she was sold in 1818 she captured one privateer and destroyed another, and participated in three campaigns. In all, her crew qualified for three clasps to the Naval General Service medal (NGSM). After the Royal Navy sold her in 1818 she became a whaler. She then made seven whaling voyages to the Pacific, and especially to the waters off New Zealand, between 1820 and 1844. she was broken up on her return from her last voyage. Naval career Fawn was commissioned in May 1807 under Commander Fasham Roby, who sailed her for the Leeward Islands on 11 November. On 15 December 1807 she arrived at Barbados with the news of war with Denmark. Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane had been in readiness since 2 September and immediately set sail for the Danish West Indies in his flagship, , bringing with him a squadron of warships, including Fawn, and troops under the overall army commander, General Henry Boyer. The British captured St Thomas and Santa Cruz; the Danes did not resist and the invasion was bloodless. Commander Roby died in April 1808, a year after his wife had died in England.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 17, p.440. Commander Nevinson de Courcy replaced Roby on 15 April.Marshall (1929), Supplement, Part 3, p.317. Some time after wrecked on a reef off Anegada on 23 March, Fawn and the two 32-gun frigates and arrived and engaged in salvage attempts. The British abandoned the wreck on 24 June.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 20, p.44. Around this time, Commander George Albert Crofton, late of , replaced de Courcy. On 28 (or 20) May Lieutenant James Robertson (Acting), took two of Fawns boats on a cutting out expedition to capture Spanish privateer schooner and three merchant vessels anchored under the protection of two shore batteries at the northeast end of Porto Rico. The crew of the schooner ran her ashore and abandoned her. To get her off Robertson had to nail sheet lead over holes in her bow. As she pulled away he had the prize crew fire her guns at the privateersmen who were firing small arms from the shore. Suddenly the magazine on the prize exploded, throwing all but Robertson and two seamen into the water. The explosion killed one man, and injured four others. Still, that evening Robertson was able to rejoin Fawn with the schooner and the three merchant vessels. A squall the next day sank the captured schooner, killing five men.Marshall (1833), Vol 4, Part 1, p.379-90. A little over a month and a half later, on 17 July, Fawn returned to the same location. This time Robertson had three boats from Fawn under his command, as well as two boats from . Commander Charles Napier accompanied the operation. Although Napier outranked Robertson, Napier was only accompanying Robertson to gain a knowledge of the coast and agreed that he would have the status of a volunteer, and that Robertson would be responsible for the operation. The British cut out a Spanish merchant schooner from under the guns of two batteries, and then Robertson and Napier landed and spiked the guns in one battery and rendered the guns' carriages unusable. In January‚ÄìFebruary 1809 Fawn participated in the invasion of Martinique. Four decades later the operation was among the actions recognised by the clasp \\"Martinique\\" attached to the Naval General Service Medal (NGSM), awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847. Fawns boats, under the command of Lieutenant Morgan, engaged a cutter and the schooner Guadeloupe on 25 July and captured the schooner. In 1847 the Admiralty authorized the NGSM medal with clasp \\"25 July Boat Service 1809\\" for the action. Despite this being an action meriting the award of the NGSM with clasp, there is no further information available about what transpired. In August 1809 or so, Fawn recaptured Sir George Prevost and the American vessel George, Holmes, master, and brought them into Martinique on 2 September.Lloyd's List, no.4409, - accessed 6 July 2015. Another report describes Sir George Prevost as a polacre ship and her captor as the French privateer Fine. At the end of 1809 Fawn formed part of the squadron off Guadeloupe under Captain Volant Vashon Ballard of Blonde. On 25 September Blonde, Fawn, and sent their boats after an enemy vessel making for Basse-Terre. To escape her pursuers, their quarry ran herself ashore in a bay between two batteries. The boat parties reached the French vessel despite cross-fire from the batteries and in the face of small arms fire from men on the beach. However, the British were unable to get the French vessel off. Instead, as she was bilged, they simply left. British casualties amounted to two men wounded from Blonde, one of whom lost an arm and the other of whom later died. Fawn participated in the capture of Guadeloupe in January and February 1810. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Guadaloupe\\" to all surviving participants of the campaign. Fawn then sailed to England. On 11 October 1810, Fawn captured a French privateer schooner after an \\"anxious\\" six-hour chase during which the quarry threw her guns overboard. The schooner was Temeraire, of ten guns and six large swivel guns, and a crew of 35 men. She was a new vessel, three days out of Brest, and had taken no prizes, though she was in the process of boarding a Pappenberg brig sailing from Dover when Fawn appeared on the scene. Fawn had captured Temeraire off The Lizard, and then sent her into Plymouth.Lloyd's List, no.4503, - accessed 6 July 2015. On 27 June 1811, the American ship George, M'Kirdy, master, which Fawn had detained, arrived in Yarmouth.Lloyd's List, no.4575, - accessed 6 July 2015. About a week later, Fawn detained and sent into Yarmouth Sanderness, Jamerson, master, which had been sailing from Denmark.Lloyd's List, no.4577, - accessed 6 July 2015. Crofton received promotion to post captain on 1 Feb 1812.Marshall (1929), Supplement, Part 3, p.30-1. His replacement on 11 February was Commander Thomas Fellowes. In 1812 or so the Admiralty reclassified Fawn as a post ship. Then on 28 June 1812 Fawn accompanied the Lisbon fleet as a convoy escort. After cruising in the Channel for some time, Fawn proceeded to escort a fleet of merchantmen from Cork to Barbados. On their arrival in Carlisle Bay, Barbados, the masters of the vessels in the convoy gave Fellowes a letter thanking him \\"for the excellent arrangements he made to prevent separation, and for his very great attention to them during the voyage.\\" From Barbados, Fawn proceeded to the Jamaica station where she recaptured several British vessels. The American privateers Lady Madison and Eagle, each of one gun and 50 men captured Perthshire on 29 November off Altavela, after a half-hour action in which Perthshires master, M'Kinley, was killed. Perthshire had been sailing from Newfoundland to Falmouth, Jamaica, when the Americans captured her. Fawn recaptured Perthshire on 5 December and took her into Jamaica.Lloyd's List, no.4745, - accessed 6 July 2015. One source further describes Perthshire as a letter of marque of 14 guns, and carrying a cargo of fish and oil.Marshall (1828), Vol. 2, pp.339-42. Fawn then was assigned the task of protecting the trade between Cura√ßao and the Spanish Main. On 12 December Fawn encountered and recaptured her, together with the 12-man prize crew of Americans. (The American privateer Saratoga had captured Rachel the day before in an action at La Guiara.) The British took the Americans on board Fawn and put a six-man prize crew on board Rachel, which they sent her into Jamaica, where the Vice admiralty court condemned her as a prize. Fawn went into La Guaira and picked up Rachels crew, all of whom agreed to serve on Fawn, though some apparently deserted shortly thereafter.1812 Privateers - accessed 19 December 2013. On 9 January 1813, Fawn captured the Spanish brig Teneriffe and sent her into Port Cavello. From her Fellowes found out that her captor was one of three American privateers that had come from a rendezvous between Beata and Saint Domingo. Fawn set out in pursuit and on 10 January Fellowes sighted a strange vessel. After a long and arduous chase during which the batteries of Port Cavello fired on the privateer to prevent her entering, Fawn succeeded in chasing the American privateer Rosamond, of eight guns and 105 or 120 men, on shore.Lloyd's List, no.4756, - accessed 6 July 2015. Rosamond ran on shore on Point Hicacos where her captain and 24 men drowned in attempting to reach the land. Rosamond had on board $100,000 in specie and valuable merchandize, the plunder of various English and Spanish vessels. The Captain-General of the Caraccas then requested that Fellowes extend his patrol to the east side of the province of Cumana, \\"where the insurgents have landed at a place called Guiaia, paralyzing commerce, and obstructing the general supplies of provisions sent to the island of H[is] B[ritannic] M[ajesty] and seriously affecting the interests of his afflicted ally, the Spanish nation.\\" On 6 June Fawn captured the privateer Havannah. The Governor of Cura√ßao, Major-General Hodgson, also acknowledged Captain Fellowes' \\"zealous and active exertions;\\" and the merchants of that island presented him with a piece of place. On 3 July , , and Fawn left Jamaica, escorting a convoy of some 100 vessels for England.Lloyd's List, no.4798, - accessed 6 July 2015. Bedfords portion of the convoy, some 467 vessels, arrived at the Isles of Scilly on 26 August; the vessels for the Bristol and St George's Channels had separated on 15 and 22 August with Cyane and Fawn.Lloyd's List, no.4800, - accessed 6 July 2015. Disposal In October 1813 Fawn was paid off. At the news, the ship's company submitted the following letter to Fellowes: > Sir, \\"It is with the deepest regrette that we have this day learned that His > Majesty's Ship under your Command is ordered to be paid off, as it deprives > us of a Commander, we one, and all would wish to sail with. We beg leave. > Sir! to state that your great attention to our Comforts in our different > stations has left a grateful impression on our minds, and induces us to take > the Liberty of soliciting the favour of serving in any Ship to which you may > be appouited, we hope, Sir, that you will be pleased to Excuse this freedom > as it proceeds from no other motive than our Gratitude to a Commander we so > much Esteem and Respect.

Fawn remained in Ordinary until the Principal Officers and Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy offered the \\"Fawn, of 26 guns and 424 tons\\" for sale at Plymouth on 13 August 1818. She sold to a Mr. Young for ¬£1,470 on 20 August 1818. Whaler Fawn, of 430 tons, built at Topsham in 1807, with Thomas Allen, master, and John Lydekker, owner, sailed on 5 February 1820 for Peru, on her first whaling voyage. She was at Valparaiso between 30 March and 24 April 1821, and was reported \\"all well\\" in March 1822. She returned to England 17 November with 650 casks of whale oil[https://whalinghistory.org/bv/voyages/ British Southern Whale Fishery Database ‚Äì voyages: Fawn.

Fawn was reported to have been at the Moluccas in mid-1831 with 2200 barrels. From 16 October to 7 November she was at Honolulu full, with 2600 barrels. She arrived back in Britain on 15 April 1832 with 700 cask. Fawns fifth whaling voyage was her last with Charles Dale as master and John Lydekker as owner. She left Britain on 18 July 1832. She was at Honolulu from 8 to 25 April 1833 with 150 barrels. She had been out 19 months when she was reported to have been at Bouka Bay on 15 January 1834 with 1100 barrels. She was also reported to have been off \\"Bayenwall Island\\" with 1050 barrels in mid-February. She was at Honolulu on 28 October with 1400 or 1450 barrels. She returned to Britain on 25 September 1835 450 casks. For her sixth whaling voyage Fawn had a new master, Cruickshank. and a new master, Stephen Gardner (or Gardiner). Gardner sailed on 18 January 1836, bound for New Zealand. She was at Talcahuano, Chile, on 29 June 1836 and at Noohava 25 March 1837. Between 13 April and 17 May she was at Honolulu with 300 barrels. She was again at Honolulu between 14 October to 8 November with 700 barrels. By 30 November she was at Fanning. She returned to Honolulu on 4 January 1838.

On 31 January 1573, he became the governor of the Diyarbekir Eyalet, where he worked on providing oarsmen for the navy that was bound for Tunis and ammunition for a planned conquest of Bahrain, collection of tariffs and the elimination of the tribes that lived as brigands. He held this office until he was replaced by √ñzdemiroƒülu Osman Pasha on 2 June 1576. It is not clear whether he ever became the governor of Erzurum. He was the governor of the Damascus Eyalet in 1577. He was tasked with the defense of Erzurum in the Ottoman-Safavid War in 1578, but this mission was cancelled as the defense of Damascus was considered more important. He waited in Damascus until troops arrived from Egypt and moved to Erzurum, where the army gathered, in March 1579. He undertook the construction of one of the bastions of the fortifications while he was in Kars. He then led a mission with the governors of Tbilisi and Diyarbekir to relieve Tbilisi of its shortage of supplies and food under the siege. He succeeded in this mission and returned to Damascus. He later rejoined the army under Koca Sinan Pasha. On 18 October 1580, while he was in the frontline, he was made the governor of Diyarbekir again but the decision was swiftly reversed and he remained in his position in Damascus.

Nangka started its long-living journey as a tropical disturbance over the Marshall Islands and west of the International Dateline, becoming the eleventh named storm of the annual typhoon season on July 3. It quickly intensified while moving to the west-northwest, attaining typhoon status on July 6. Nangka moved through the Northern Marianas Islands, passing directly over the uninhabited island of Alamagan. Shortly thereafter, the typhoon attained peak winds; the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) estimated 10‚Äëminute sustained winds of 185 km/h (115 mph), while the unofficial Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated 1‚Äëminute winds of 250 km/h (155 mph), making it a super typhoon. Nangka later weakened as it curved to the north, moving across central Japan on July 16 as a minimal typhoon. The storm weakened soon after, dissipating in the Sea of Japan on July 18. The storm first affected the Marshall Islands, bringing strong winds to the capital Majuro. Half of the city lost power, and several boats were sunk. Minimal effects were reported in the Northern Marianas Islands, and later the storm's flow enhanced the monsoon over the Philippines. Effects were worst in Japan, where rainfall reached in Kamikitayama, Nara Prefecture. Total damage across the Kansai region reached ¬•18 billion (US$145 million). Nangka killed two people in Japan, injured 55, and damaged or flooded 220 houses. Meteorological history A westerly wind burst spawned Typhoon Chan-hom and Tropical Storm Linfa across the western Pacific Ocean, as well as the system that would become Typhoon Nangka. On July 1, an area of pulsing convection persisted east of the Marshall Islands, associated with a poorly-defined circulation. Low wind shear, water sea surface temperatures, and good outflow favored further development. The circulation gradually became more defined as the convection organized more. At 18:00 UTC on July 2, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression, about 80 km (50 mi) east of Aur Atoll. Based on the increasing organization, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the system as Tropical Depression 11W at 12:00 UTC on July 3. About six hours later, the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Nangka. When Nangka was upgraded to a tropical storm by the JTWC early on July 4, convective bands were wrapping into the center, but limited by dry air to the west. By that time, the storm was moving to the west-northwest, steered by the subtropical ridge to the north. On July 5, the JMA upgraded the storm to a severe tropical storm. By that time, the circulation had become exposed due to moderate wind shear, although the outflow had improved. On July 6 after shear diminished, Nangka began to quickly intensify as it developed an eye in the center of the blossoming convection. As a result, the JTWC upgraded the storm to typhoon status at 06:00 UTC, followed by the JMA at 12:00 UTC. Nangka reached its first peak intensity at 12:00 UTC on July 7, when JMA estimated 10 minute sustained winds 185 km/h (115 mph). The typhoon was aided by excellent radial outflow enhanced by a TUTT cell to the northwest, and it developed a well- defined eye 48 km (30 mi) in diameter. Three simultaneously active typhoons on July 9: (from left to right) Linfa, Chan-hom and Nangka After reaching its initial peak intensity, Nangka slightly weakened as convection along the west side of the system was restricted due to the TUTT cell, and the eye became cloud-filled. Decreasing wind shear and increasing sea surface temperatures allowed the intensification trend to resume, and the structure became more symmetric late on July 8 as it moved toward the Northern Marianas Islands. A well-defined inner eye re-developed inside of an outer eyewall. On July 9, the JTWC upgraded Nangka to a Category 4-equivalent super typhoon, estimating peak 1 minute winds of 250 km/h (155 mph). The JMA also assessed a 10-minute peak of 185 km/h (115 mph). At 06:00 UTC on July 9, the eye of Nangka passed over the uninhabited island of Alamagan. The typhoon later weakened while turning more to the west due to increased wind shear. The eye became cloud-filled and was no longer visible by July 11, although the organization was sustained by good outflow to the south. However, the convection reorganized the next day and the eye reformed. By that time, Nangka was slowing and nearly stationary as the subtropical ridge receded to the east. On July 13, Typhoon Nangka began moving northward toward Japan through a break in the ridge. The typhoon completed an eyewall replacement cycle, and according to the JTWC attained a secondary peak of 195 km/h (120 mph). The re-intensification was also aided by a decrease in wind shear, but was short-lived due to drier air from the north and west. As the eye became more ragged, the winds continued to decrease. At 14:00 UTC on July 16, Nangka made landfall along the Japanese island of Shikoku near Muroto, K≈çchi, still at typhoon status. Four hours later, the typhoon weakened into a severe tropical storm, and after crossing the Seto Inland Sea, Nangka made a second landfall on Honshu near Kurashiki, Okayama at 21:00 UTC. The convection greatly weakened as it crossed Honshu into the Sea of Japan, and the storm deteriorated further due to lower water temperatures. At 12:00 UTC on July 17, the JMA downgraded Nangka to a tropical depression, and early the next day the JTWC discontinued advisories. On July 18, Nangka dissipated in the central Sea of Japan. Preparations and impact On Majuro atoll in the Marshall Islands, the developing Nangka produced strong westerly winds near gale force, producing high waves and flooding along the lagoon. At least 25 vessels in the island's lagoon broke loose from or were dragged by their moorings. High winds from Nangka tore roofs from homes and downed trees and power lines. Nearly half of the nation's capital, Majuro, was left without power. Tony deBrum, the Marshall Island's foreign minister, stated \\"Majuro [is] like a war zone.\\" Some coastal flooding was also noted, which resulted in crop damage. Typhoon Nangka approaching Shikoku, Japan on July 16 Ahead of the storm, the Guam National Weather Service issued a typhoon watch for Agrihan, Pagan, and Alamagan, as well as a high surf advisory for Guam. The watch was later upgraded to a warning, and was canceled after the typhoon exited the region. Flights were delayed or canceled to the region due to the storm and problems with the local aircraft communication system. During the storm, there were minor power outages on Saipan in two villages that were quickly restored. On Alamagan where the storm struck, six people rode out the storm in a concrete bunker. In the Philippines, the flow from the storm increased the southwest monsoon, causing flash floods and landslides in some areas. The outskirts of the storm later brushed the east coast of South Korea, producing in rainfall, and wind gusts of . Japan Due to the threat of the storm, nine airlines canceled 214 flights across Japan. Meanwhile, rail service and highways were disrupted, with a portion of the Ch≈´≈ç Expressway closed, and ferry rides were canceled. The Shikoku Railway Company canceled service during the storm and limited rides along the West Japan Railway Company. About 860,000 people were advised or ordered to evacuate their homes, including 88,100 people from 15,400 homes who were forced to leave. After the storm passed, residents were allowed to return home. While moving through Japan, Nangka produced peak wind gusts of in Muroto, K≈çchi. Heavy rains impacted much of central Japan, peaking at in Kamikitayama, Nara Prefecture. Owase, Mie recorded over 24 hours. The highest hourly rainfall was in Saij≈ç, Ehime. Kawauchi, Fukushima recorded over one hour, setting a record for the month of July. The rains from Nangka caused rivers to exceed their banks. In Tokushima Prefecture, the Naka River flooded to the second story of nearby school buildings. Flooding stranded 1,600 passengers on a train for four hours, which had been traveling from Tsuruga, Fukui to Himeji, Hy≈çgo. Across Japan, strong waves and high winds killed over 11,000 bluefin tuna on a fish farm in Kushimoto, accounting for ¬•1.29 billion (US$10.4 million) in losses. About 15,000 people lost power across the country. The storm damaged 30 homes and flooded another 190, and also damaged farming equipment. There were 55 injuries and two deaths related to the typhoon, including an elderly man who drowned after falling into a ditch. Damage in Kansai region reached ¬•18 billion (US$145 million). Total economic losses across the nation were calculated at ¬•26 billion (US$209 million).

The non-negative real numbers, mathbb{R}_{geq 0} = left{ x in mathbb{R} mid x geq 0 right}, also include zero. Although the symbols mathbb{R}_{+} and mathbb{R}^{+} are ambiguously used for either of these, the notation mathbb{R}_{+} or mathbb{R}^{+} for left{ x in mathbb{R} mid x geq 0 right} and mathbb{R}_{+}^{*} or mathbb{R}^{+}_{*} for left{ x in mathbb{R} mid x > 0 right} has also been widely employed, is aligned with the practice in algebra of denoting the exclusion of the zero element with a star, and should be understandable to most practicing mathematicians. In a complex plane, mathbb{R}_{>0} is identified with the positive real axis, and is usually drawn as a horizontal ray. This ray is used as reference in the polar form of a complex number. The real positive axis corresponds to complex numbers z = z mathrm{e}^{mathrm{i}varphi}, with argument varphi = 0. Properties The set mathbb{R}_{>0} is closed under addition, multiplication, and division. It inherits a topology from the real line and, thus, has the structure of a multiplicative topological group or of an additive topological semigroup. For a given positive real number x, the sequence {xn} of its integral powers has three different fates: When x ‚àà (0, 1), the limit is zero; when x ‚àà (1, ‚àû), the limit is infinity; when x = 1, the sequence is constant, and when x > 1, the sequence is unbounded. mathbb{R}_{>0} = (0,1) cup { 1 } cup (1,infty) and the multiplicative inverse function exchanges the intervals. The functions floor, operatorname{floor} : [ 1 , infty ) to mathbb{N},, x mapsto lfloor x rfloor, and excess, operatorname{excess} : [ 1 , infty ) to (0,1),, x mapsto x - lfloor x rfloor, have been used to describe an element x in mathbb{R}_{>0} as a continued fraction [ n_0; n_1, n_2, ldots], which is a sequence of integers obtained from the floor function after the excess has been reciprocated. For rational x, the sequence terminates with an exact fractional expression of x, and for quadratic irrational x, the sequence becomes a periodic continued fraction. In the study of classical groups, for every n in mathbb{N}, the determinant gives a map from matrices over the reals to the real numbers: mathrm{M}(n, mathbf{R}) to mathbf{R}. Restricting to invertible matrices gives a map from the general linear group to non-zero real numbers: mathrm{GL}(n, mathbf{R}) to mathbf{R}^times. Restricting to matrices with a positive determinant gives the map mathrm{GL}^+(n, mathbf{R}) to mathbf{R}_{> 0}; interpreting the image as a quotient group by the normal subgroup, relation expresses the positive reals as a Lie group. Logarithmic measure If [a,b] subseteq mathbb{R}_{>0} is an interval, then mu([a,b]) = log(b / a) = log b - log a determines a measure on certain subsets of mathbb{R}_{>0}, corresponding to the pullback of the usual Lebesgue measure on the real numbers under the logarithm: it is the length on the logarithmic scale. In fact, it is an invariant measure with respect to multiplication [a,b] to [az, bz] by a z in mathbb{R}_{>0}, just as the Lebesgue measure is invariant under addition. In the context of topological groups, this measure is an example of a Haar measure. The utility of this measure is shown in its use for describing stellar magnitudes and noise levels in decibels, among other applications of the logarithmic scale. For purposes of international standards ISO 80000-3, the dimensionless quantities are referred to as levels. Applications The non-negative reals serve as the range for metrics, norms, and measures in mathematics. Including 0, the set mathbb{R}_{ge 0} has a semiring structure (0 being the additive identity), known as the probability semiring; taking logarithms (with a choice of base giving a logarithmic unit) gives an isomorphism with the log semiring (with 0 corresponding to ‚àí‚àû), and its units (the finite numbers, excluding ‚àí‚àû) correspond to the positive real numbers. Square Let Q  =  mathbb{R}_{> 0} times mathbb{R}_{> 0} , the first quadrant of the Cartesian plane. The quadrant itself is divided into four parts by the line L  =  {(x,y): x = y } and the standard hyperbola H  =  {(x,y): xy = 1 }. The L ‚à™ H forms a trident while L ‚à© H = (1,1) is the central point. It is the identity element of two one-parameter groups that intersect there: :{{(e^a,  e^a): a in R}, times } on L and {{(e^a,  e^{-a}): a in R},times } on H. Since mathbb{R}_{> 0} is a group, Q is a direct product of groups. The one-parameter subgroups L and H in Q profile the activity in the product, and L √ó H is a resolution of the types of group action. The realms of business and science abound in ratios, and any change in ratios draws attention. The study refers to hyperbolic coordinates in Q. Motion against the L axis indicates a change in the geometric mean ‚àö(xy), while a change along H indicates a new hyperbolic angle.

Andreae, born in 1949 in Augsburg, is a German biogeochemist. Since 1987, he has worked as Director and Scientific Member at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry (MPIC) in Mainz.Employee profile , MPIC, retrieved 2015-07-10.  Biography  Meinrat O. Andreae studied chemistry, mineralogy, and geochemistry at the Universities of Karlsruhe and G√∂ttingen. In his diploma thesis, he studied the chemical composition and isotope geochemistry of highly metamorphic rocks of southern Norway. In 1977, he completed his PhD in oceanography from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California at San Diego. In his doctoral thesis, he examined the chemical speciation of arsenic in the ocean. He discovered that planktonic algae regulate the oxidation state of arsenic in seawater and synthesize a variety of organoarsenic compounds. A secondary discovery of his work was that marine phytoplankton also manufactures the raw materials for the volatile sulfur compound dimethyl sulfide. Andreae taught oceanography in the Department of Oceanography at Florida State University in Tallahassee, from 1978 until 1982 as an assistant professor, then from 1982 to 1986 as associate professor, and from 1986 to 1987 as full professor. During this time he researched the biogeochemical cycle of sulfur in the ocean and in the atmosphere. Along with Robert Jay Charlson, James Lovelock, and Stephen G. Warren, he developed the CLAW hypothesis, named after the initials of the authors. This hypothesis states that dimethyl sulfide from the ocean is converted in the atmosphere to sulfate particles, which then influence the formation of clouds and therefore the climate. Other works from this period were concerned with biogeochemical transformations of compounds of arsenic, antimony, selenium, tellurium and tin in the marine and terrestrial ecosystems. In the 1980s, he was together with Paul Crutzen one of the first scientists to discover the worldwide importance of biomass burning. In 1987 he was appointed member of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry (MPIC) in Mainz as director and scientific member. He initiated the Biogeochemistry Department at the MPIC and designed a broad research agenda on the chemical aspects of Earth System Science. There, he continued his work on biogeochemical cycles of trace metals, and extended his studies to the formation of aerosols from marine sulfur emissions. Campaigns in the Amazon forest then led to a new focus, the biogeochemical processes of exchange between tropical forests and the atmosphere. On expeditions in the Congo, the Amazon, and Southern Africa he studied the emissions from vegetation fires, the exchange of trace gases, and the production of biogenic aerosol particles. Since 2000, research into the role of atmospheric aerosols in the climate system has been at the center of Andreae's research.

Shoe production is done by privately held company GPF Footwear LLC established in 2011. Its headquarters are located in Englewood, NJ.  Early history  Ewing Athletics is retired professional basketball player Patrick Ewing's signature basketball shoe brand. After Ewing parted ways with adidas, his first shoe endorser, he and his agent David Falk sought to create their own brand. The brand was founded in 1988 with shoe executive of Roberto Muller of Phoenix Integrated, then was sublicensed to Next Sports for them to distribute in 1991. The brand grew rapidly, as it was worn on court by Ewing as he was a perennial NBA All- Star, and worn in music videos and performances by artists such as Tupac Shakur, Gang Starr, Kriss Kross and more. The brand's most popular model, the 33 HI was even worn by Joe Pesci in the movie My Cousin Vinny for most of the film. The brand soon expanded from just basketball shoes into apparel and full family kids sizes as well as revenue hit $40M per year in the early to mid 1990s. Soon, however, due to distribution problems with Next Sports, Ewing Athletics filed a lawsuit against them that would effectively close the brand in 1996. Ewing would go on to wear Nike for the rest of his career in the NBA and Ewing Athletics would disappear for over 15 years.  Brand resurgence  Over the years a cult following grew for collectors looking for information about the old Ewing Athletics shoes. In 2012 David Goldberg and his company GPF Footwear LLC partnered up with Ewing and David Falk to reintroduce the brand back into the marketplace, hoping to capitalize on the retro footwear trend, starting with the original 33 HI. The initial launch was in August 2012 with the shoes available at select New York City stores only, with Ewing himself showing up to surprise fans waiting in lines to purchase the shoes. The relaunch was received positively into the fickle sneaker market and the company has gone on to reintroduce other models as well including: Focus, Guard, Center, Wrap, Rogue, Concept and 33 LO. They have produced T-shirts, hats and participated in a special project with New York rappers Fabolous and Teyana Taylor in conjunction with Teaneck, New Jersey based sneaker store Packer Shoes. The NYC launch of the shoes, with the artists present to meet and greet fans, was a big success, with lines around the block and the shoes selling out in two hours.

Production How to Get Tough About It is Robert Ardrey's third play, preceded by Star Spangled and Casey Jones, the latter of which opened on Broadway within ten days of it. Ardrey's next play, Thunder Rock, is his most famous. How to Get Tough About it opened on Broadway in 1938. It was presented by Guthrie McClintic, who bought the script after a single reading. The production starred Katherine Locke and Myron McCormick, who were praised for their acting. Brooks Atkinson, reviewing for the New York Times, wrote \\"In their scenes together Miss Locke and Mr. McCormick act with fervent sincerity that is beautifully matched and one of the acting treasures of this stirring season.\\" Story The author described the play as \\"A proletarian love story of pleasant dimensions.\\"Ardrey, Robert. Plays of Three Decades, Introduction. New York: Atheneum. 1968. p. 18.

Reception How to Get Tough About It opened two years after Ardrey's first play, Star Spangled. Star Spangled had been commercially unsuccessful, but had garnered Ardrey a reputation on Broadway, as well as notice from important figures. In particular George Abbott, Sidney Howard, Thornton Wilder, and Arthur Hopkins all saw promise in the play, and due to their interventions Ardrey was awarded the Guggenheim Fellowship that allowed him the financial freedom to write Casey Jones and How to Get Tough About it.\\"Getting Tough About It.\\" New York Times, 6 February 1938.

Opened in 1908, the fort was part of the Coast Artillery Corps and operated throughout the 20th century, before its closure and eventual transfer to the National Park Service. Armaments The fort was initially armed with 5 batteries: # Battery Mendell was the first battery to be built at the fort, beginning in July 1901. It had two 12-inch breech- loading rifles, Model 1895, on Buffington-Crozier \\"disappearing\\" carriages Model 1897. It was named for Colonel George Mendell, the engineer officer who had supervised construction of batteries around San Francisco Bay. #Battery Alexander was an eight-mortar battery with Model 1890 breech-loading 12-inch mortars mounted on model 1896 Mark I carriages. It was named for Colonel Barton S. Alexander. #Battery Edwin Guthrie mounted four six-inch rapid-fire guns, Model 1900, mounted on barbette carriages. The battery was named for Captain Edwin Guthrie, of the 15th Infantry Regiment. #Battery Samuel Rathbone also mounted four six-inch rapid-fire guns, Model 1900, mounted on barbette carriages. The battery was named for Lieutenant Samuel Rathbone. #Battery Patrick O'Rorke mounted four 15-pounder, 3 inch guns on Model 1903 pedestal mounts. The battery was named for Colonel Patrick O'Rorke. Battery Elmer J. Wallace, was added in 1917 with two long-range 12-inch guns each with a 360-degree field of fire. Battery Construction No. 129 was built on the summit of the fort in 1943 to contain two 16-inch guns, but was never armed or named. Later, the area above Battery 129 became the radar and control area for Nike Missile Site SF-87 whose launch area was in Fort Cronkhite. Balloon hangar The balloon hangar at Fort Barry is a surviving element of the U.S. Army‚Äôs brief experimentations with using tethered balloons as part of the nation‚Äôs system of coastal defenses. Constructed and abandoned the same year, the structure is the only surviving hangar of its type that actually housed an army balloon, and one of only two examples of its type known to survive in the country. As such, it has a national level of significance for its part in the evolving stories of both coastal defense and military aviation. The balloon hangar at Fort Barry was completed on June 27, 1921. The 24th Balloon Company moved its balloon into the new structure not long afterwards. Tunnel Forts Baker-Barry Tunnel A half-mile (0.8 km) long tunnel connected Fort Barry and Fort Baker. In June 1937, the tunnel's width was increased to . Decommissioning Fort Barry was discontinued as a U.S. Army installation , effective 10 September 1974 by General order Number 25.

She was known for her philanthropic work. Early life Deakin was born Elizabeth Martha Ann Browne on 1 January 1863 in Tullamarine, Victoria. She was the eldest daughter and fifth of eleven children born to Elizabeth () and Hugh Junor Browne. Her father was born in Scotland and arrived in Australia via the Colony of Natal. He established a successful distillery near Princes Bridge and was also chairman of the Broadmeadows Road Board. Her mother was born in England, the daughter of an Anglican clergyman. Her paternal grandfather was a Church of Scotland minister and married the daughter of the chief of Clan Matheson. Browne grew up in East Melbourne. She was initially educated by a governess, and then from the age of 12 attended Grantown House, \\"a fashionable ladies' college [...] patronised by the Anglican establishment\\". She studied for matriculation but did not take the exams. During her childhood, her father left the Church of Scotland and converted to Spiritualism. He established a s√©ance circle at their home and Pattie frequently served as medium. She also engaged in automatic writing. Her \\"extraordinary capacities as a medium\\" were recounted in two of her father's volumes, published in 1876 and 1888, and in Human Personality and Its Survival of Bodily Death (1903), a posthumous work by Frederic W. H. Myers. However, they were not common knowledge during her lifetime. Courtship and marriage Deakin c. 1880 Browne first met her future husband Alfred Deakin in 1874, when she was 11 and he was 17. They were both attendees at the Melbourne Progressive Lyceum, the Sunday school for the city's Spiritualists. In July 1877, Alfred became her class teacher; he was also the conductor of the school band. He participated in a number of her s√©ances. They danced for the first time at her coming-out ball the day before her 16th birthday. In 1879, both were elected \\"leaders\\" of the Lyceum. He began seriously courting her after her 18th birthday in 1881, and proposed marriage in July. Her father gave only qualified approval, concerned about Alfred's social standing and lack of independent means. According to family tradition, Pattie had also been courted by a wealthy 40-year-old baronet. The couple married on 3 April 1882, despite attempts by her parents to delay the wedding. There was no religious service, only a civil ceremony, and her father did not pay a dowry. They honeymooned in Tasmania, then moved into Alfred's parents' house in South Yarra. They lived with his parents and sister Catherine for two years before moving to a new house, \\"Llanarth\\", built nearby on land bought by Alfred's father. Public life Deakin in 1904 In 1887 she was a member of the committee of the Queen's Fund. She also became president of the Victorian Neglected Children's Aid Society. In 1907 she accompanied her husband to the Imperial Conference in London; while there she made her first public speech at the request of Lady Jersey, the wife of the former Governor of New South Wales the Earl of Jersey, to the Primrose League. The same year, she chaired the nursery and kindergarten committee for the Australian Exhibition of Women's Work, held at the Exhibition Building. The popularity of the model cr√®che, which Pattie ran, led to the establishment of the Association of Cr√®ches, of which she was the first president. The Free Kindergarten Union was formed similarly; Pattie was president of that too. Revenue from the exhibition helped form the Bush Nursing Association; Pattie became a member of the committee. For twenty years Pattie worked with the Melbourne District Nursing Society, first as president, and subsequently as a life vice-president. With her husband's aid she established the Guild of Play for Children's Playgrounds, which helped make play areas for children in inner-city suburbs. Alfred and Pattie Deakin In 1909 she gained her St Johns Ambulance certificate with honours and was presented with the insignia of an associate of St John of Jerusalem. In 1912 she was invited to be president of the Lyceum Club. From 1915 to 1919 she set up and ran the Soldiers' Refreshment Stall, or Anzac Buffet, initially in a bell tent outside the No. 5 General Hospital in St Kilda Road, Melbourne. After the First World War ended her philanthropic work continued. She became the first president of the Girl Guides and the only female member of the Australian Imperial Forces Canteen Fund Trust. She held this position until her death when her daughter Vera Deakin White took her place.National Library of Australia She was awarded the Commander of the Order of the British Empire for her contribution to public life.

Never notable for any startling excesses of invention, it slows down to a succession of dialogues as it reaches the screen, and is content to be a faithful photographic study of its original. It is still a mild delight, though, to contemplate the fresh and amusing point of view which is the basis of Accent on Youth. Mr. Raphaelson has written a comedy which might serve as a sort of amorous supplement to Walter Pitkin's hymn of encouragement to the middle-aged.

It contains three separate synthesis engines, AddSynth, SubSynth, and PADSynth; any single patch can use one or all. Furthermore, there is a kit mode where the patch can have up to 16 of these engine sets for making multi-layered sounds or drum kits. A complete setup or instance can contain anywhere from one to sixty-four possible patches. All signal generation is done by synthesis, not using import of external samples. Yoshimi also has extensive FX capabilities, which can be applied at all levels, ranging from one synth engine to an entire setup. It is also microtonal, and has the ability for custom scales to be defined. Originally based on the 2.4.0 version of ZynAddSubFX (Copyright 2002-2009 Nasca Octavian Paul), development of Yoshimi has continued in its own direction. While full compatibility with ZynAddSubFX voice patches has been maintained, control and user interface have diverged considerably. This is intended. A purpose of the Yoshimi project has always been to optimize in parallel with ongoing development of ALSA and JACK under Linux. It is therefore highly optimized for these on Linux, and is not available for other operating systems. Sound generation Yoshimi combines several different methods of audio synthesis in order to create sounds: additive synthesis by the ADDsynth engine, subtractive synthesis by the SUBsynth engine, and an algorithm original to Nasca Octavian Paul used to generate wavetables in the PADsynth engine.http://zynaddsubfx.sourceforge.net/doc/PADsynth/PADsynth.htm PADsynth wavetables can also be exported for use in sample players. MIDI control For both JACK and ALSA there is a single input port (although several sources can attach to it at the same time). At startup, Yoshimi can be instructed to choose between the two, and automatically look for a specific source and connect to it. If for some reason JACK or ALSA is not available it will try to connect to the other source. If neither can be found it will still run, giving one the chance to investigate the problem. There are three classes of multipatch configurations available, 16, 32, and 64 patches. When the 32-patch configuration is enabled one can choose pairs (between the two sets of 16) for realtime control changes (called vector control), and when 64-patch configuration is enabled one can do this in two dimensions, between four sets of patches. Command Line If starting from a terminal window, as of version 1.3.6 it has been possible to actively control many features here. System settings, Bank lists, Program Changes and many others are already accessible. Since version 1.5.9 it has been possible to edit deep into the instrument patches themselves. With version 1.5.10 there is almost complete access. Audio Out When using ALSA for Audio, one stereo pair is available, but when using JACK, one can have this plus one pair per active patch, up to 64. As with MIDI, Yoshimi can be instructed to choose between JACK and ALSA. Also, when running with ALSA it is possible for it to look for a specific sound card. More Yoshimi can run as an LV2 plugin and is frequently tested on the most common hosts. In stand-alone mode it is also possible to run multiple instances, each with their independent sources and destinations, but sharing essential resources. Yoshimi also supports vector control via a MIDI two axis joystick, allowing up to four parts to be sounded together with varying mixes, panning etc. all determined in real-time by the joystick position. This can be configured over MIDI, by the command line or (since version 1.4.0) via the graphical interface. A recent development is the ability to swap active channels in order to get an instant sound change while retaining the fading notes of the previous sound. This has been developed further in the latest release as 'Solo' accessed from the mixer panel. A major development was the implementation of MIDI-learn whereby you can 'teach' Yoshimi to link specific actions to any valid continuous controller. As of V 1.5.1 this includes learning aftertouch and NRPNs There is a Yoshimi-only format (.xiy) that is a super-set of the standard type (.xiz). Users can save either or both formats. When loading, Yoshimi will look for the new format first, and if not found will then look for the standard one. The new format includes all the standard settings, but also all elements of 'Controllers' as these have been found to make a dramatic difference to the final sound. Their settings can be quite critical. Latest V1.7.1 sees the implementation of both channel and key aftertouch. This is completely new work and may change dependent on user feedback. We also now support three different 'laws' for stereo panning which are subtly different with moving sounds.. Information As well as a dedicated yoshimi directory in 'doc' with much background information and The Short Yoshimi Guide as ODF, there is a Yoshimi Advanced User Manual directly accessible from the 'Yoshimi' drop-down menu. This is a PDF and should launch into whatever PDF reader you have. It is extremely comprehensive and currently runs to approximately 290 pages.

Spies became chairwoman of the board upon her husband's death, and in 1989 acquired the travelling agency . Spies sold the entire company in 1996 to what is now Sunclass Airlines. She has later been accused of having destroyed her inheritance by bringing her brother, a former toolmaker, Leif Brodersen on the board together with a friend of his, the former trade union economist Steffen M√∏ller. Her board now counseled her to purchase three Airbus A300 in 1987 and in 1991 another six brand new and very expensive Airbus A320. As the Airbus A300 were very difficult to sell, the passengers became fewer due to the Gulf War the entire Spies company ended up in severe financial difficulties. According to the General Manager at the time, Knud Heinesen, had this never happened if Janni had listened to him instead, and merged or cooperated with Copenhagen-based Sterling Airways instead. Also her second husband, the lawyer and politician Christian Kj√¶r agreed. And as he took over as chairman of the board, (with Janni as vice chairwoman only) Leif Brodersen left the Spies company.http://www.tic.travel/node/10789 But the financial problems didn't end there, and in 1993 had several banks to add new capital to the bankruptcy threatened travelling agency. And in 1996 was Spies Rejser sold to the British travel company Airtours while Conair merged with Scanair into Premiair, changing the name to Thomas Cook Airlines Scandinavia, which today is Sunclass Airlines A/S. Spies is chairwoman for Simon Spies Fonden (The Simon Spies Foundation) that supports science, business, arts, and sport, and typically donates some 2-3 million DKK every year.

It was discovered in 1905 by the industrialist, poet, memoirist, and amateur naturalist Ignaz Bing (1840‚Äì1918), co-founder with his brother Adolf Bing of the Gebruder Bing toy and household goods company in N√ºrnberg.  History  Cave formations in the Bingh√∂hle Drip formations in the Bingh√∂hle Stalactities in the Bingh√∂hle After years of exploration in the region, Ignaz Bing discovered a beautiful stalactite cave in 1905 near the town of Streitberg (Wiesenttal). Using his own wealth, he purchased the land from the local forester who owned it. The earliest excavations at the mouth of the cave, designed to widen its access, uncovered prehistoric artifacts and fossils, which Bing and his workers carefully removed and catalogued.\\"Tales From A Merchant's Life\\" (1915) by Ignaz Bing; this book, along with Bing's two further memoirs, \\"My Family and Friends\\" (1916), and \\"My Travels\\" (1917), was translated into English, collected into one volume, and published in 2013 under the title \\"Tales From My Life: Memoirs of a Merchant and Cave Explorer in Germany 1840-1918\\" In 1906, Bing installed electric lights and turned the cavern into a tourist attraction. He hired Konrad Arndt, who had worked on the initial excavations, as the site's overseer, and his niece, the enthusiastic amateur spelunker Olga Hirsch, worked as a guide. In 1909 a movie crew toured the cave and the resultant film was screened at the \\"cinematograph salon\\" of the Noris Theater in N√ºrnberg. The site soon became so popular that Bing personally conducted a private tour of the cave for Prince Ludwig of Bavaria. When it was first opened to the public, the Bingh√∂hle originally had a length of about 230 meters. In 1913, a passage was carefully excavated around one of the grottoes to make a further gallery accessible. In 1928, the lighting, which had been run from a private generator, was connected to the national electrical grid. In 1936 another 70 meter long path was discovered and connected to the main gallery. The Bingh√∂hle reaches a depth of 60 meters below the surface. It follows the path of a now-dry underground river that once flowed into the then-higher Wiesent River. As with most tourist caves, the various features have been named. Among these are the Stalactite Gallery, the Kellermann Cave with its Giant Pillar, the Hall of Candles, the Grotto of Venus, the Catacombs, the Shell Rock, Olga's Grotto, the Nixie Grotto, the Fantasy Cave, the Prince Ludwig Grotto, the Three Peaks, and the New Department. From 1905 until the Nazis took power in Germany, the cave was owned and operated by Bing and his descendants. Because the Bing family was Jewish, the government seized possession of it and renamed it the \\"Streitberger Cave\\" after the nearest town. After the Nazi regime came to an end in 1945, the cave was renamed the Bingh√∂hle. Eventually a financial settlement was made with the family in recompense for the illegal seizure. The site has been operated by the local municipality.The Bing Cave / Bing Hoehle: chronology of Ignaz Bing and the Bing Cave Markt Wiesenttal In 2005 the Bing Cave was renovated and offers beautiful guided walking tours underground featuring lighting technology, including fairytale and birthday tours for children's parties.The Bing Cave / Bing Hoehle official web site: home page Markt Wiesenttal Due to the unwanted growth of cave flora around the old incandescent lighting in the cave, modern LED lighting was installed during the renovation.

In 1910 Vyborg had minorities of Swedes (5,000) and Russians (3,200-4,000), as well as smaller ethnic groups of Germans, Jews and Islamic Tatars.Schweitzer, Robert: ‚ÄùSaksalainen Viipuri‚Äù p. 22. (in Finnish). Article in the book ‚ÄùMonikulttuurisuuden aika Viipurissa‚Äù, Viipurin Suomalainen Kirjallisuusseura, 2013. . Historian Teemu Keskisarja considers a spark that set off the killings was the news that a gang of drunk Red Guards had entered Viborg County Gaol during the Battle of Vyborg and murdered 30 White Guard prisoners. However some Finnish historians think the Whites' goal was not to destroy the town's entire Russian population because only men of military age and suspicious elements were targeted. The other ethnicities were only killed because they were simply assumed to be Russians.  Killings  The massacre started on April 28 during the Battle of Vyborg, escalating on the next, final day of the battle. Westerlund notes descriptions by jaegers Nurmio and Grandell of difficulty of identifying the Reds, as they hid amongst the population.Westerlund (2004), p. 102 Street combat and sniper skirmishes colored the final day of the battle. The largest mass executions were committed at the Annenkrone fortification on the western side of town and in the yard of Vyborg Castle, but mainly the killings took place randomly in the streets and yards. Some managed to survive as the Finnish or Swedish residents were hiding them. Executions were committed by the Vaasa and Kajaani regiments, which were parts of the Eastern Army of the White Guards, led by the General Major Ernst L√∂fstr√∂m. Vaasa Regiment was led by the Swedish military adventurer Martin Ekstr√∂m, who later became a leader of the Swedish Nazi organization National Socialist Bloc. Both regiments were filled with men from other parts of Finland but who were not from the Vyborg area. The local White Guards did not directly take part in the killings. After Mannerheim heard about the massacres on May 2, he ordered an investigation and the punishments of the culprits. The next day on May 3 Rudolf Walden sent the following telegram from Mikkeli to G. A. Finne, the new town commandant: \\"Take the strongest actions to prevent violence towards innocent Polish, Ukrainians and Russians. Investigate each case.\\"Westerlund (2004), p. 155 Even after this, a group of J√§gers that had arrived from Germany intended to kill the whole Jewish population of Vyborg but the plan was stopped by the local police chief K. N. Rantakari. Orders for conducting the executions were mainly given by the officers of the J√§ger Movement. For example, the J√§ger Major Harald √ñhquist admitted that his company had shot some 150 \\"Red Ruskies\\", but did not mention who had given the order. After the war, General Karl Fredrik Wilkama was considered to be responsible for the massacre, but neither he nor anyone else was ever convicted or even charged in a court of law. Wilkama himself described the massacre as a \\"little accident\\". On May 10 L√∂fstr√∂m sent a telegram to headquarters requesting for permission to spread aid, especially monetary, to Russians who had to suffer and who were robbed of personal property. Later on more aid was given. Westerlund says that it's not possible to gauge the full amount from the survived records, but states that the final sum was considerable.Westerlund (2004), pp. 157-159  Victims  Victims of the massacre in the Annenkrone Fortress Different estimations of the total number slain have taken place over the years. Soikkanen approximated the number at about 200, Tanskanen at 100, Upton at 50+, Russian newspapers noted by Vihavainen at 500-600, Rustanius and Jouni Eerola at 200, and lastly Jaru and Jouni Eerola at 350-550.Westerlund (2004), pp. 98-99 Westerlund estimates the number at 360-420. Teemu Keskisarja estimates it at about 400. 37 of the slain were members of other ethnic groups living in Vyborg, including 23 Polish soldiers of the Imperial Russian Army, several Ukrainians, Estonians, Jews and Tatars, two Italians and one Baltic German. At least half of the murdered Russians were affiliated with the army.Westerlund (2004), p. 163 It is notable that they did not fight with the Reds, but were mostly unarmed. Only few of the victims had any connections with the Red Guards, most of them even supported the Whites and greeted them as liberators. The victims were of all social classes. Most of the killed Russian civilians were workers as well as administrators working for the City of Vyborg, merchants, businessmen or handicraftsmen, also several noblemen were executed. The youngest victims were only 12‚Äì13-year-old schoolboys. Two of the murdered teenagers were the 13 and 15-year-old sons of Lieutenant Colonel Georgi Bulatsel who was one of the highest ranked Russian officers fighting for the Reds. He had been executed after the Battle of Tampere on 28 April. There had been at least three women amongst the slain Russians.Westerlund (2004), p. 121 Not all caught Russian were slain, as there are numerous mentions of spared Russians in the committee records.

Brandy made the film‚Äîalso her directorial debut‚Äîon a shoe-string budget with just seven people over seven days of principal photography, and shot entirely in Los Angeles and surrounding areas. The film follows Lola, an ex-con completing her community service by picking up trash on the side of the road, as she makes a video apology letter for a mysterious man named Henry. As part of the film's outreach campaign, the filmmakers collected thousands of anonymous apology letters from fans online. Plot The film follows Lola, a 22-year-old ex-con who spends her time completing her community service by picking up trash on the side of the highway, as she makes a video letter for her mysterious pen-pal \\"Henry.\\" Although Henry's identity is not revealed until the end of the film, the audience is given a window into Lola's world and her relationships. Through her video antics, which range from darkly humorous to heartbreakingly honest, we discover a girl who's full of contradictions. Tugged in opposite directions by her best friend Ree, and her new love interest Sam (Travis Quentin Young), Lola tries to piece her life back together in the aftermath of a huge mistake.

Business career  Smelting Works at the 'Lloyd's Mine', Burraga, N.S.W. c.1899. Lloyd was trained at a smelter at Caermarthen, Wales. Lloyd migrated to New South Wales in 1863 to work at the copper smelter at Cadia. According to his obituary, he was a Welsh language speaker and could not speak English at the time of his emigration. Lloyd was able to use his expertise in copper smelting to obtain an interest in copper mining ventures. In at least one of his earlier ventures, he was in partnership with Saul Samuel. He went on to become a well-known mining entrepreneur and was known as the \\"Copper King\\". In 1874, he built a copper smelter at Lithgow, which he located near the Eskbank Colliery so that he could use otherwise unsaleable fine coal (then known as 'slack' coal) to fire his furnaces. His was the first of three copper smelters established in Lithgow, during the 19th century, to make use of 'slack' coal as a fuel. He was said to have had, at one time, 38 reverberatory smelting furnaces‚Äîof his own distinctive design‚Äîin operation in various parts of New South Wales. His fortune came mainly from his sole ownership of the copper mine at Burraga‚Äîknown as 'Lloyd's Mine'‚Äîwhich he bought in 1879. He was also involved in other copper mines in the Central West of New South Wales, at Cow Flat, Coombing Park, and Ophir. In 1899, he sold his interest in the mine at Burraga to an English company for ¬£100,000.  Political career  He was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1884 for West Macquarie; re- elected in 1885, he did not recontest in 1887. His political career was undistinguished; a quiet man by nature, who did not like speaking in public, he was described as an \\"exemplary silent member.\\"  Family and homes  Lewis Lloyd was the son of William Lloyd. In 1865, he married Mary Ann Jones, with whom he had eleven children. During the time that he was the sole proprietor of the Burraga mine, he lived at Bathurst. He had a home in the eastern suburbs of Sydney, from at least the 1890s, living first at 'Mylorn', in Bondi Road, Waverley. His last home was 'Dalston', 21 Jersey Road‚Äîformerly Point Piper Road‚Äîin Woollahra.  Death  Lewis Lloyd died at his home in 1902. At the time of his death, his estate was valued at ¬£103,565, less ¬£10,856 for probate duty, but some were surprised that he had not left more. His grave lies in Waverley Cemetery. His wife, Mary Ann, died in 1901. He is commemorated as one of the 'Pillars of Bathurst'‚Äîin a commemorative public garden at Bathurst,‚Äîand by the name of Lloyd Street in the now sleepy hamlet of Burraga.

Early performances included recitals of Beethoven and Bach classical works, which he played in local churches, in front of attentive audiences. At 9 years old, Walden took a few months of guitar lessons to learn the basics and a few more lessons at age 15. In high school, he learned more about playing the guitar by watching YouTube videos and learned how to write songs by breaking down the patterns of songs by verse, chorus and bridge. One of his first songs, Just Another Story, was about a girl unaware of a boy's affections. Walden considers Ed Sheeran, Damien Rice, All Time Low and The Maine as his major musical influences. Musician Billy Rice, known for playing with Toby Keith and John Michael Montgomery, gave Walden his first acoustic guitar in 2010 and encouraged him to take up singing. Through Rice, Walden met Del Couch, who founded the Del Couch Music Education Foundation in 2010, now housed in the Manatee School for the Arts in Palmetto, Florida.

The mansion was built in 1845 by Commodore Robert F. Stockton for his son John P. Stockton, both senators from New Jersey. Prior to being a senator the younger Stockton had served as the Attorney General of New Jersey and later as ambassador to Italy. Commodore Stockton was the son of Richard Stockton, another New Jersey Senator, and grandson of Richard Stockton, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. The latter Richard Stockton built Morven in the 18th century, which sits a short distance up Stockton Street. His grandfather's home, known as the \\"Barracks\\" is found at 32 Edgehill Street, the street which fronts the gate to the Walter Lowrie House property. It was built in the 17th century and gained its name from having served as a barracks in either the French and Indian War or the American Revolution. The Walter Lowrie House was the work of architect John Notman, who designed a number of mansions for the Stockton family including nearby Guernsey Hall and Prospect House. Notman popularized the Italianate revival architecture in the United States and his Princeton homes are prime examples of that style. The home was purchased from John P Stockton by Paul Tulane, best known for endowing Tulane University in New Orleans. In 1895 it was acquired by George Allison Armour, whose daughter Barbara would take up the residence in 1930 along with her husband, Walter Lowrie. Walter Lowrie had served for many years as the Episcopal rector of St Paul's Within the Walls, sometimes known as the American Church in Rome. Lowrie was a noted Kierkegaardian theologian and translator, spending his retirement in Princeton publishing academic works, including twelve volumes of Kierkegaard translations. After his death in 1959, his wife donated the home to Princeton University in memory of her husband, who had been a member of the Princeton class of 1890. It was used as a guest house by the university from 1960 to 1968 and subsequently became the official residence of the president of the university. The official residence had originally been Maclean House, built 1756. From 1878-1968, it had been Prospect House but was moved to Walter Lowrie House, which is off campus grounds. Prospect House then became the site of a faculty club.

He published around 140 papers on the biogeography and taxonomy of birds, focusing largely on birds of the Great Basin. Behle was born in Salt Lake City on May 13, 1909, the second of three children of parents Augustus Calvin Behle, a surgeon, and Daisy May Behle. William studied at the University of Utah, earning a B.A. in 1932 and M.A. in 1933, then pursued doctoral work at the University of California, Berkeley, under Joseph Grinnell, earning a PhD in 1937. Aside from four summers as a naturalist at Grand Canyon National Park, he spent the majority of his career as a professor at the University of Utah, where he worked from 1937 until his retirement in 1977, and continued to perform research as professor and curator emeritus. Behle was a fellow of the American Ornithologists' Union and American Association for the Advancement of Science, president (1972‚Äì1974) of the Cooper Ornithological Society, and member of the Wilson Ornithological Society. He is commemorated in the scientific name of a tarantula species, Aphonopelma behlei (now considered a synonym of A. marxi) named by his colleague Ralph V. Chamberlin in 1940. Behle's contributions to ornithology include some 140 papers on bird distribution and taxonomy, and the description of several subspecies (geographic races), including the western purple martin (subspecies Progne subis arboricola) and a race of slate-colored fox sparrow. Behle's 1990 book Utah Birds: Historical Perspectives and Bibliography focused the history of ornithology in Utah from 1776 to modern times, with biographical accounts of collectors and researchers, amateur and professional alike. UC Berkeley professor Ned K. Johnson called it \\"the most detailed ornithological history of any extensive region of North America.\\" In 1934, Behle married Dorothy Davis, who died in 2001.

Biography Liebreich was born in London, and educated at Haberdashers' Aske's School for Girls. She studied History at University College London, before completing a PhD at the University of Cambridge. She worked as the cultural assistant at the French Institute in London, and then as a producer at the BBC and the History Channel, where she worked on historical documentaries. Between 2005 and 2009, she ran a historic kitchen garden in Chiswick House, West London, and was the co-founder of Abundance London, a community garden and urban harvesting project. In 2013, she was awarded an MBE for services to horticulture and education From 2015 to 2018, working with Sarah Cruz also of Abundance London,http://www.abundancelondon.com she created the Chiswick Timeline,http://chiswicktimeline.org/ a vast, spectacular mural of historic maps of Chiswick from 1593 to the present day, illustrated by local artists from William Hogarth to Peter Blake, covering almost 60 metres of the London Underground bridge arches crossing Turnham Green Terrace. Works In 2004, Liebreich wrote Fallen Order, an expos√© of sexual abuse in the Catholic Church in the 17th century. While researching her doctorate, Liebreich discovered documents in the Vatican archives indicating that the Piarist Order, an order dedicated to providing education to poorer children, had covered up a sexual abuse scandal involving some of their priests. This scandal had subsequently contributed to the order's temporary suppression in 1646. In 2006, Liebreich wrote The Letter in the Bottle about her research to identify the mother who wrote a message in a bottle to express her enduring grief over the death of her son at the age of 13. The 2009 French translation received substantial media coverage in France and was dramatised for a BBC Radio 4 Afternoon Play in December 2012.

Considered to be a pioneer transgender performer,\\"Jackie Shane, pioneering transgender soul singer, dies at 78\\". CBC News, February 22, 2019. she was a contributor to the Toronto Sound and is best known for the single Any Other Way, which was a regional Top 10 hit in Toronto in 1962 and a modest national chart hit across Canada in 1967.\\"A brief history of queer music in Toronto\\". BlogTO, November 29, 2014. Background Originally from Nashville, Tennessee,\\"I Got Mine: The Story of Jackie Shane\\". CBC Radio, February 28, 2010. she was born on May 15, 1940. She began performing locally in the 1950s wearing long hair, make-up, and jewellery. Vowing to escape the \\"Jim Crow South\\", in the late 1950s, she joined a travelling carnival and arrived in Cornwall, Ontario, in 1959, where she said she felt free for the first time. In 1960, Shane moved to Montreal, Quebec, where saxophonist \\"King\\" Herbert Whitaker invited her along to watch the popular band Frank Motley and his Motley Crew at the Esquire Show Bar. Shane showed up and sat down near the front. When Motley said, \\"Get that kid up here and let's see what he can do,\\" pianist Curley Bridges invited Shane, then still presenting as a man, onstage for the next set, where she performed songs by Ray Charles and Bobby \\"Blue\\" Bland. She was soon the band's lead vocalist, and relocated to Toronto with them in late 1961. She returned several times to the United States, on tour with the Motley Crew (to Boston, for example, where they recorded), to New York to record, to visit her family and old friends and perform on a TV show in Nashville, or to live and work in Los Angeles where she played drums in recording sessions. A fan mythology linked her to Little Richard, including claims that she had been Richard's backing vocalist before moving to Canada or even that she was Richard's cousin, although no verification of either claim has ever been found and no evidence exists that Shane ever made either claim herself.Carl Wilson, \\"I Bet Your Mama Was a Tent Show Queen\\". Hazlitt, April 22, 2013. Music critic Carl Wilson has concluded that, while in reality Shane had deep and identifiable roots in the traditions of the Southern US Chitlin Circuit, the mythology emerged because that scene's traditions were not known to Torontonians in the 1960s, and thus Little Richard was the only antecedent for Shane's performing style that most of her local fan base could identify. Throughout her active musical career and for many years thereafter, Shane was written about by nearly all sources as a man who performed in ambiguous clothing that strongly suggested femininity, with some sources even directly labeling her as a drag queen.\\"Toronto Historical Jukebox Plays the Sounds of Our Past\\". Torontoist, January 29, 2014. The few sources that actually sought out her own words on the matter of her own gender identification were more ambiguous, however; she identified herself as male in two early quotes to the Toronto Star, but more often appeared to simply dodge questions about her gender altogether.Steven Maynard, \\"A New Way of Lovin': Queer Toronto Gets Schooled by Jackie Shane\\". Any Other Way: How Toronto Got Queer. Coach House Books, 2017. . pp. 11‚Äì20. Her identity as a trans woman was not confirmed on the record by a media outlet until music journalist Elio Iannacci interviewed her for The Globe and Mail in 2017.\\"Searching for Jackie Shane, R&B;‚Äôs lost transgender superstar\\". The Globe and Mail, May 19, 2017. Recording career She released her first single, a cover of Barrett Strong's \\"Money (That's What I Want)\\", in 1962. \\"I've Really Got the Blues\\" was the single's B-side. Shortly thereafter, the same label released an alternate version of the single on which \\"Money\\" was relegated to the B-side, while a different recording of \\"I've Really Got the Blues\\", with a few revised lyrics and the alternate title \\"Have You Ever Had the Blues?\\", became the A-side.Jackie Shane at CanadianBands.com. She followed up with \\"Any Other Way\\" (b/w \\"Sticks and Stones\\") later the same year, in the fall of 1962; the song became her biggest chart hit, reaching #2 on Toronto's CHUM Chart in 1963. A cover of a song previously recorded and released by William Bell in summer 1962, Shane's version was noted for adding a different spin to the lyric \\"Tell her that I'm happy/tell her that I'm gay\\"; while the original lyric intended the word \\"gay\\" in its older meaning as a synonym of \\"happy\\", Shane played on the word's double meaning, which was not yet in mainstream usage. The follow- up single to \\"Any Other Way\\" was \\"In My Tenement\\" b/w \\"Comin' Down.\\" It received some airplay in upstate New York, but did not chart elsewhere in the US or Canada, and Shane did not record again for several years. In 1962, Shane was performing at Toronto's Saphire Tavern, specializing in covers of songs by Ray Charles and Bobby Bland. In 1965, she made a television appearance in Nashville on WLAC-TV's Night Train, performing Rufus Thomas' \\"Walking the Dog\\". Around the same time, she was offered an appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show, but refused as the booking was made conditional on her presenting as male.\\"Jackie Shane: remembering the groundbreaking trans soul singer\\". The Guardian, February 25, 2019. In 1967, \\"Any Other Way\\" was reissued and became a modest hit across Canada, peaking at #68 on the national RPM chart in March. Shane subsequently returned to recording later that year, issuing the single \\"Stand Up Straight and Tall\\" b/w \\"You Are My Sunshine\\", and the live album Jackie Shane Live. A final single, \\"Cruel Cruel World\\" b/w \\"New Way of Lovin'\\", was released in 1969. In addition to her own recordings, Shane also appeared on Motley's album Honkin' at Midnight, performing live versions of some of the singles she had released under her own name.Jackie Shane at Queer Music Heritage. Shane faded in prominence after 1970‚Äì71, with even her own former bandmates losing touch with her; soon after returning to Los Angeles, she turned down an offer to be a part of George Clinton's band Funkadelic. She began caring for her mother, Jessie Shane, who lived in Los Angeles, before relocating to Nashville around 1996 after the death of her mother.\\"Jackie Shane in her own words: A rare interview with a living legend\\". Q, February 8, 2019. For a time she was rumoured to have committed suicide or to have been stabbed to death in the 1990s, but in fact she had retired from music, and moved home to Nashville from Los Angeles. She kept in touch with Frank Motley, who put a Toronto record collector in touch with her in the mid 1990s. This news was relayed to a small number of her old musician friends, a couple of whom contacted her. One, Steve Kennedy, discussed with Shane the possibility of organizing and staging a reunion concert, but this never materialized ‚Äî the next time Kennedy called the same phone number, it had been reassigned to somebody else who had never heard of Shane. Post-career attention CBC Radio's Inside the Music aired a documentary feature, \\"I Got Mine: The Story of Jackie Shane\\", in 2010. At the time, nobody involved in the documentary, the executive producer of which was Steve Kennedy's wife, had been able to determine whether Shane was still alive; but she was subsequently found, still living in Nashville. Footage of Shane in performance also appeared in Bruce McDonald's 2011 documentary television series Yonge Street: Toronto Rock & Roll Stories.\\"The Strip's musical heyday; Documentary 'Yonge Street ‚Äì Toronto Rock &Roll; Stories' uncovers an era when 'truth was stranger than the publicity'\\".

Jackie Shane Live was reissued as a bootleg in 2011 on Vintage Music as Live at the Saphire Tavern, although the reissue was labelled as being from 1963 (the date of the original live performance) instead of 1967 (the release date of the album). A compilation bootleg of the studio singles and rarities, Soul Singles Classics, was released the same year. OPM subsequently reissued the album under its original title. In 2015, the Polaris Music Prize committee shortlisted Jackie Shane Live as one of the nominees for the 1960s‚Äì1970s component of its inaugural Heritage Award to honour classic Canadian albums.\\"Polaris Music Prize Announces Heritage Prize Nominees\\".

In 2017, a group of Toronto writers published the essay anthology Any Other Way: How Toronto Got Queer, a history of LGBT culture in Toronto; in addition to taking its title from Shane's 1962 single, the book includes an essay devoted specifically to Shane. In the summer of 2017, the reissue label Numero Group announced that they would be releasing a double-LP/CD compilation of Shane's music, Any Other Way, on October 20, 2017. The album marked the first time since her final single in 1969 that Shane was directly involved in the production and release of a reissue of her music. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award in the Best Historical Album category.\\"Drake, Shawn Mendes, Diana Krall among Canadians up for Grammys\\". CBC News, December 7, 2018. In a revealing interview with Elio Iannacci of The Globe and Mail, Shane stated she was planning to return to Toronto to perform live for the first time in nearly five decades. In 2019, Shane granted a broadcast interview to CBC Radio One's Q. The interview was conducted by Elaine Banks, who had been the producer and host of \\"I Got Mine\\", and was Shane's first broadcast interview since the end of her performing career.

Although best known as a figurative expressionist painter, Larwill was also a draughtsman and printmaker of note. He produced many drawings, watercolours, ceramics and sculptures as well as etchings, lithographs and screenprints. In a career that stretched over 30 years, Larwill held over 25 solo exhibitions and participated in scores of group shows.  Career   Early life David Larwill was born in Ballarat, Central Victoria, and spent his early life on family-owned farms. In the 1960s, Larwill moved to his grandmother's house at Mt Martha, on Victoria's Mornington Peninsula. He attended Mornington Secondary College (finishing in 1973) and later Frankston Technical College (1974‚Äì75), where he studied photography, painting and sculpture. The following year, Larwill started studying ceramics at Prahran College of Advanced Education but dropped out of the course after three months, and worked as a labourer at a steel mill in nearby Hastings. He then moved to Noosa in Queensland, to live in a girlfriend's parents' villa, and left Australia to travel throughout Europe and North America for 18 months.Thomas, D., 'Biographical Notes', in G. Ramsay, Stuff that matters, Ballarat Fine Art Larwill returned to Melbourne in 1979 and moved into a St Kilda flat with art students Peter Ferguson and Wayne Eager. He enrolled at Preston Institute of Technology, where he studied for a year under Peter Booth, Peter D. Cole, Rod Bishop, Dale Hickey, Mirka Mora and John Dunkley-Smith. Larwill met fellow student Karan Hayman at this time, and they, along with many others, established Roar Studios in 1981. The Department Head, Betty Churcher (later Director of the National Gallery of Australia), advised him: \\"You don't need to come here ... Why don't you stay in your studio and paint and exhibit?\\" Larwill followed her advice.Grishin,S.,‚ÄòDavid Larwill‚Äô, in David Larwill and the Western Desert Artists, Lisa Fox, 2008, p. 10 The contemporary Australian painter, Peter Booth, had a profound impact upon the development of Larwill's early painting style. Larwill attended a 1979 exhibition of Booth's work at Pinacotheca Gallery, Richmond, Victoria, which consisted of large narrative paintings depicting the end of the world. Larwill was intrigued by what could be achieved through paint, commenting: \\"You could do ugly scenes but the overall effect is one of beauty\\".Larwill quoted in Grishin, ‚ÄòDavid Larwill‚Äô, p.13 Internationally, the work of French artist Jean Dubuffet and the CoBrA group were also important influences on Larwill‚Äôs art; in particular, its revival of expressionism and interest in Outsider art. Larwill also admired the New York street art of Jean-Michel Basquiat, and had a growing appreciation of Aboriginal art from first-hand contact and personal friendships, most notably with the celebrated Australian painter Ginger Riley Munduwalawala. = Roar Studios = Disillusionment with art school experiences and the difficulties of breaking into the commercial gallery scene led to the establishment of Roar Studios, Brunswick Street, Fitzroy in 1982. The group aimed to counteract perceived biases in the local art community against women, young people and ethnic minorities. David Larwill‚Äôs affable larrikinism and his powerful style attracted young emerging Melbourne artists who shared a similar desire to show their work. The core original founding group of the ROAR Studio collective included Larwill, Sarah Faulkner, Mark Howson, Karan Hayman, Mark Schaller, Ann Howie, Daniel Kogan, Peter Ferguson, Wayne Eager, Pasquale Giardino, Richard Birmingham, Michael Nicholls, Stephen McCarthy, Maggie MacNamara, Andrew Ferguson, Russell Cook, Glenda Wisemen, Julie Rosewarne and more. ROAR opening nights became well known for their salubrious atmosphere and late nights. The style of the ROAR artists was eclectic and they openly acknowledged their debt to a previous generation of Melbourne figurative expressionist painters including John Perceval, Danila Vassilieff and early Sidney Nolan. ROAR Studios Opening Exhibition premiered in June 1982. Larwill showed two paintings. A successful solo exhibition held there the following year. While he continued to exhibit with ROAR, Larwill soon attracted the interest and attention of a number of well-known commercial dealers and galleries. In his comment on ROAR's ten-year anniversary exhibition, critic Robert Rooney commented that: \\"ROAR grew out of an impatience with rather than complete opposition to the existing commercial gallery system, a system into which early ROAR recruits would eventually be absorbed\\".Rooney, R., ‚ÄòRoar optimism conquers years‚Äô, Australian, 6 June 1992  The middle years In 1983 Larwill was invited to show with the United Artists Gallery, St Kilda. This gallery included respected mid-career artists such as Mike Brown, Asher Bilu and Dale Hickey. A second Larwill painting Ash Wednesday, 1983, was purchased by the National Gallery of Victoria. Over the rest of the decade Larwill's work was increasingly shown in important group and prize exhibitions throughout Australia. This included: Vox Pop: Into the Eighties (National Gallery of Victoria, 1984), The Hugh Williamson Prize (Ballarat Fine Art Gallery, 1986) and A new generation 1983‚Äì88: Philip Morris Arts Grant Purchases (National Gallery of Australia, Canberra, 1988). Larwill had extended stays in Central Australia (1990 and 1991) where he spent time working with local artists and conducting workshops. During his first trip to New York in 1992 the tags and graffiti he found in subways and on the streets became an important influence. He also saw the major retrospective exhibition of the American artist Jean-Michel Basquiat at New York's Whitney Museum of American Art. Larwill's artist-friend David Thomas remarked: ‚ÄòLarwill was much influenced by his skeletal images, use of tribal figures, surface writing and his ability to fill his canvas from edge to edge‚Äô.Thomas, D., ‚ÄòBiographical Notes‚Äô, p. 57 Larwill also reacquainted himself with Pablo Picasso‚Äôs African- inspired masks and sculptures. Soon after, Larwill produced the first of many sculptures using found objects and the technique of assemblage. Direct contact with isolated Aboriginal communities increased Larwill's appreciation of Indigenous art and culture. He responded directly to the beauty of the landscape by making many studies on paper. The time away also gave Larwill a more considered perspective on environmental and political issues. In 1984, Larwill responded to the threat of nuclear war by creating an anti-war piece, Nuclear Disarmament Party. In 1986, Larwill was one of a number of Melbourne artists commissioned to paint a Melbourne W-class tram as part of the commemoration of the United Nations International Year of Peace. Larwill chose to paint images of war stridently outlined in black. His opposition to the unjust treatment of the first Australians led to the inclusion of works in pro-Aboriginal land rights exhibitions. Following an invitation to travel to Kakadu National Park and see its world-famous rock art sites in 1998, Larwill also participated in Stop Jabiluka Mine with Mark Schaller and Peter Walsh. The exhibition was held at Gould Galleries, Melbourne, in June 1998, as a protest against the proposed uranium mine that was planned for the wilderness area and park. In 2003 Larwill, Karan Hayman, Peter Walsh, Greg Ades, Tanya Hoddinott and Mark Schaller all travelled to Woomera and visited the proposed nuclear waste dump sites with indigenous leaders and then held exhibition of works ' Secret Country ' from the trip again at Gould Galleries to raise funds to support the cause. ‚ÄòDavid was always interested in the cause! ... He felt a responsibility to the wider world and had an interest in current affairs. He was founding member of the Artists for Kids Culture Trust, raising money for underprivileged kids. The Clean Ocean Foundation was also important. David was an early supporter of the Foundation through its Hang 12 surfboard art exhibition and auction.'Larwill,F.,in David Larwill:Ten years on,Mornington Peninsula Regional Gallery,Victoria, 2013, p. 20  Later years In 1993 David Larwill settled once again on the Mornington Peninsula where he eventually set up a permanent home and studio. Dividing his time between Somers and Melbourne, Larwill began to make whimsical sculptures again, fashioned from weather-beaten found objects washed up from Western Port and Port Phillip Bay. At the same time, his paintings became larger and more ambitious in scale. A 1994 solo exhibition of new works, \\"Snakes and Ladders\\", at Gould Galleries, Melbourne, was an artistic and commercial success, with the works nearly selling out in the first few days. With the aid of new manager, Ken McGregor, that was the beginning of a very successful phase of Larwill's art career that included the launch of a monograph on his work in 1999. For the first time, Larwill had a purpose-built art studio, the means to paint full-time, and a steady request for new works. Larwill's appearance in national exhibitions and prizes continued to grow, including Streetwise, New York (1993), and as a finalist in the Art Gallery of New South Wales's Sulman Prize competition in 1994. In 2002, the solo survey exhibition, \\"David Larwill: Stuff that Matters\\", was presented at Ballarat Fine Art Gallery (now the Art Gallery of Ballarat) and subsequently toured to six venues across Australia. In 2003, Larwill‚Äôs paintings were included in the exhibition \\"William Creek and Beyond\\". This exhibition was also toured nationally by the Art Gallery of Ballarat. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, David Larwill‚Äôs international reputation was enhanced by new commissions, exhibitions and awards. The Victorian Government and the Victorian Art Centre Trust commissioned the large tapestry Celebration as a gift to Singapore‚Äôs new Esplanade Art Centre. The work toured regional Victoria before being installed at Esplanade in mid-2002. In 2010, a selection of Larwill‚Äôs recent paintings was also shown in Singapore when he and friend Mark Schaller were invited to participate in a joint exhibition \\"Art is Long\\". Other notable international exhibitions included \\"David Larwill: Recent Paintings\\" (England & Co, London, 2003), and \\"David Larwill and the Western Desert Artists\\", organised by supporter Lisa Fox and held in Stephan Weiss Studio, New York, in 2008. That important exhibition was sponsored by Qantas airlines as part of the official Australian contribution to \\"Gooday USA\\". A posthumous survey of David Larwill‚Äôs final decade of work was held at the Mornington Peninsula Regional Gallery in 2013. This exhibition, entitled \\"Ten years on\\", revealed the breadth and considered nature of Larwill's mature oeuvre, and showed a diverse range of works that included paintings and drawings. Two bronze sculptures ‚Äì Bird (2011), and Contemplating his place in humanity (2011) ‚Äì were also included. They figured amongst Larwill's last works, because he was determined to finish them prior to his death. Suffering from cancer, David Larwill died en route to Alice Springs in 2011. He had requested his friend and manager Ken McGregor to drive him there one last time. Larwill is survived by his wife, Fiona, and their sons, James and Henry. Art: subject and technique  David Larwill‚Äôs early work was direct, spontaneous and often raw. A painting such as Luna Park, 1979, shows how he impulsively explored the dramatic, all-over quality of blacks and reds, combined with expressive handling of paint. The work refers to a well-known fun park in inner-city St Kilda that had attracted figurative artists that Larwill greatly admired. Larwill compared the characteristic primitivism of his figures to letter writing: ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs my symbols, my language. I want to show arrangements people have never seen before.‚ÄôLarwill, D., quoted in S. Harford, ‚ÄòLarwill: an artist comes full circle‚Äô, Age, 27 October 1994 In the paintings influenced by his time spent in New York, Larwill extended this lexicon to include canvases in which words shout from canvases full of noise; and there is a new tension within the compositions, which in Streetwise, New York, 1993 takes on the semblance of graffiti-covered walls. For Larwill, painting was essentially a leap of faith. He began by putting paint on canvas and gradually the marks evolved and crystallised through the recall of everyday events. His subjects, although coming from the imagination, were ultimately taken from life; his family, pets, surroundings and things that he liked to do, read, listen to or see. These simple pleasures along with what was happening on the world stage both inspired and challenged him and became the basis of his art. Shipwrecked, 1999, is a mature example of Larwill‚Äôs intuitive approach to making art. Larwill was a keen sailor who appreciated the shape, feel and texture of timber-hulled boats. A voracious reader of the stories of seafarers and pirates, elements of the local environment and coastal folklore became important components of his work. The arrangement of the figures, boat, shields, marks and dots animate the painting. With its strong primitivist inclinations and clear stylistic references to Indigenous art, Shipwrecked combines the style of painting and sculpture Larwill developed subsequent to his time in New York. The palette of predominantly ochre, red and browns laid down over a bed of white and creams was a combination that features in a number of Larwill‚Äôs large works from the late 1990s and early 2000s. In the early 2000s Larwill turned from using oil to acrylic paint. Although he loved the smell of turpentine mixed with oil, he became frustrated with the time it took for oil paint to dry. He also loved the rich and dense colour available in acrylic paints and as it improved in quality he came to prefer this over the more traditional oil. ‚ÄòHe worked in layers; layer upon layer and each session the work would evolve in structure. His work had a cyclical and rhythmic structure. ... He went to the studio to paint and took the history of painting, sketching out, reworking, glazing and looking with him. He spent a lot of time looking. His method was that of a traditional painter, the invention was in the work‚Äô.Larwill,F.,in David Larwill:Ten years on,p.13 What were you thinking?, 2006, is a characteristic late work that was one of the artist‚Äôs favourites. It is a multi-faceted painting that combines a sophisticated layering of paint and the use of vibrant colours. The question posed by the painting could \\"refer to friends who have passed away or people who have done stupid things and lived to regret it ... David was ever-present in his paintings. He observed human nature and used his observations as a source for his work ...\\"David Larwill: Ten years on, p. 14 Contemplating his place in humanity and Bird are bronze sculptures that were exhibited in a 2011 exhibition designed to commemorate the original ROAR exhibition and artists. Ideas often had a long gestation period in Larwill‚Äôs practice and he began working on concepts for these sculptures in 2005. Wax and clay moulds later became the basis for the dog and the bird. ‚ÄòDavid made the observation that ‚ÄúI feel as if I am doing something I have always done ... (my) hands are working‚Äù. He really enjoyed making these sculptures. He felt the dog was evocative. David had been diagnosed with cancer at this stage.‚ÄôDavid Larwill: Ten years on, p. 11 Collections Awards and commissions * 'The Larwill Studio', Art Series Hotel Group, Parkville accommodation, linked to Royal Children's Hospital, opened 2014 * Celebration, tapestry commissioned by Victorian Government and Victorian Arts Centre Trust as a gift for Singapore's new Art Centre, 2002 * Things that matter, a republican theme painting to launch the Republican Countdown, 1999 Painting for Australian Football League Hall of Fame, Melbourne, 1996 * Cover design for Six pi√®ces du th√©√¢tre contemporain australien, Editions Lansman, Belgium, 1995 * Lithograph design for the program, Rigoletto, The Australian Opera, 1989 Design for artists and industry, 1988 * National Gallery of Australia, restaurant commission, 1986 * Canvas-mural Philip Morris Arts Grant, National Gallery of Victoria, 1986 Poster and set design for Ubu Roi, Australian National University, 1986 Painted tram, Victorian Ministry of the Arts, 1986 * Mural for Australian Centre of Contemporary Art, South Yarra, 1984 Selected bibliography and references * David Larwill: Ten years on, Mornington Peninsula Regional Gallery, 2013 (Introductory essay by Ken McGregor; Fiona Larwill, Wayne Eager and Marina Strocchi in conversation with exhibition curator Rodney James) * Roar Reviewed, Macmillan Art Publishing, Melbourne, 2011 (David Deague and Crenia Cadden) * Art is Long: Mark Schaller and David Larwill, Aratong Galleries in conjunction with the Australian High Commission, Singapore, 2010 (Forewords by Ashley Crawford and Ken McGregor) * David Larwill and the Western Desert Artists, Lisa Fox, New York, 2008 (Introduction by Sasha Grishin) * Ken McGregor, William Creek & Beyond: Australian artists explore the outback, Craftsman House, Sydney, 2002 * David Larwill: Stuff that Matters, Ballarat Fine Art Gallery, 2002 (Preface by John Olsen and essays by David Thomas, Christopher Heathcote, Sian Prior and Zelda Cawthorne; Biography by David Thomas) * Ashley Crawford, ‚ÄòDavid Larwill: The goblin force‚Äô, Art & Australia, vol.38, no.2, 2000, pp. 266‚Äì73 * Ken McGregor, with Elizabeth Thompson, David Larwill, Craftsman House, G+B Arts International, Sydney, 1997 * Traudi Allen, ROAR and quieter moments from a group of Melbourne artists, Craftsman House, G+B Arts International, Sydney, 1995 * Christopher Heathcote, ‚ÄòThe roaring eighties‚Äô, Art Monthly, no.52, August 1992, pp. 15‚Äì16 * Robert Lindsay, Vox pop: Into the Eighties, National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, 1983 References Australian artists 1956 births 2011 deaths Expressionist painters ","title":"David Larwill"},{"id":"47174084","text":"Pacific Gold, is an American Christian music band.

Los Angeles County Does (1921‚Äì1951) Retouched morgue photograph of the female victim killed in a dynamite explosion between 1921 and 1951. Two children were witnessed playing with sticks of dynamite in Los Angeles County, California between the years of 1921 and 1951. Poor record keeping resulted in the exact date of the incident being unknown; the time range was established from the thirty-year career of the particular crime scene photographer. The dynamite subsequently exploded and killed both the victims, one male and one female. Very little is known about these two victims, especially the male child, as it was impossible to create a reconstruction from his body due to the injuries he suffered. He wore dark colored loafers; dark socks; medium toned pants; possibly a dark colored long sleeved shirt. The female was in much better condition. She was most likely a teenager, though a wider possible age range is not known. Her height, weight, hair and eye color are unknown; though she most likely was Caucasian. She was wearing a light-colored long sleeved top; dark colored skirt or pants; dark colored socks with stripes at top. San Bernardino County John Doe (1930) San Bernardino County John Doe, killed by a truck in 1930. A man estimated to be between the ages of fifty-five and sixty years old was struck by a truck on Cajon Highway on October 22, 1930 in Verdemont, San Bernardino County, California. The victim had been walking alongside the road and was presumed to have been killed as soon as the vehicle collided with his body. He had hazel eyes, a beard and gray hair. His height and weight were five feet eight inches and 180 pounds, respectively. The unidentified man's fingerprints have since been obtained, but his dental records were not and his DNA was not possible to use to create a genetic profile to compare to potential matches. Los Angeles County Jane Doe (1968) left An African-American female was found dead on September 30, 1968 in Los Angeles, Los Angeles County, California. The woman was estimated to be over the age of twenty five and was at a height of five feet three inches tall and weighed about 110 pounds. Her hair was black and her eyes were brown, coinciding with her race. The teeth were left in a natural condition, as no evidence of dental work was noted. Her wisdom teeth had yet to erupt. The woman wore a pullover shirt, pants, black shoes and matching socks. The colors of the pants and shirt are unknown. She may have died of a drug overdose and her body was abandoned behind a building, presumably transported from the place of death. It is believed she was seen alive immediately prior to her death, but this has not led to the discovery of her identity.  \\"Leroy\\"  On April 4, 1974, a young white man was found unresponsive in his hotel room by a group of coworkers in Oxnard, California. The man was estimated to be between 18 and 30 years old, was 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighed 220 pounds. He had brown, shoulder-length hair and a beard as well as hazel eyes.

A note with the name \\"Brad Lee Bodie\\" was also found in his pocket, but investigators have excluded this as his name. Fingerprints were traced back to a man who had been arrested on March 25, 1974 in Los Angeles, who also was unidentified.  Mill Valley John Doe  On September 26, 1974, the skull, ribs and vertebrae of a young, possibly white, male child were discovered in Mill Valley California, near the Mill Valley Golf Course. He was estimated to be between 4 and 6 years old, and brown hair was found with the skull. He was described as being considerably small for his age. He was found wearing a green windbreaker/ski jacket with a hood, a green and white striped knit shirt, a blue T-shirt, and a red lady bug pin. He was initially thought to be a girl until DNA testing proved otherwise. Cause of death could not be ascertained, however no signs of abuse or malnutrition could be found. Carson Jane Doe 2020 sketch of the Carson Jane Doe A Hispanic female's body was found in Carson, Los Angeles County, California after she was presumably buried by two Hispanic males fleeing the scene on April 20, 1978. She had pierced ears, painted nails and plucked eyebrows, indicating she made effort toward her appearance. She was five feet two inches tall and weighed 133 pounds at the approximate age of sixteen to twenty years old.

He had blond hair and was found wearing a blue jersey with the numbers \\"44.\\" Los Angeles County John Doe (1981) Los Angeles County John Doe (1981) A Hispanic man was killed when his vehicle collided with a light post after he was racing another vehicle on March 15, 1981 in Los Angeles, Los Angeles County, California. The victim was estimated to have been between thirty-two and forty-five years old and was at a height of five feet three inches tall and was at a weight of 132 pounds. His eyes and hair were dark, coinciding with the estimation of his race and he had noticeable wear on his teeth. He wore a white T-shirt, tan pants, socks and a brown hat. Despite the fact that the license plate on the 1968 Ford truck he drove was decipherable, he remained unidentified.  Sonoma County Jane Doe  On January 24, 1983, the decomposing, headless remains of a middle aged white female were discovered by a gardener in Foss Creek behind the Simi Winery in Healdsburg, California. Cause of death could not be ascertained. The woman was estimated to be between 30 and 50 years old, between 5 feet 1 inch and 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighed between 100 and 140 pounds. She had brown hair with some graying visible and one leg that was shorter than the other. She was found wearing blue jeans, a single brown sock, a brown ankle-length lace-up boot, a pair of panties, a white metal earring with a greenish stone, and Ful- Vue gold prescription glasses. Food stamps issued in June, 1982 from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania were found near the body, as well as a Green Girl Scout pocket knife, a green/red cloth tape measure, a metal pencil sharpener, two keys on a paper tag, and two quartz stones. Investigators exhumed the woman's body in 2011 to investigate a potential tie to serial killer Joseph Naso, however no link was found or released. The DNA Doe Project was asked to assist with identification of the woman in August, 2020.  Yosemite Jane Doe (1983)  On June 28, 1983, the partial skeletal remains of a young white female were found in Summit Meadow at Yosemite National Park in Mariposa County, California.

He was the 22nd descendant of the Sabarna Roy Choudhury family. The name of Laksmikanta and the Sabarna Roy Choudhury family is an integral part of the history of Kolkata. Bangiya Sabarna Katha Kalishetra Kalikatah; by Bhabani Roy Choudhury, Manna Publication.  Early life  Lakshmikanta Roy Choudhury's father, Jiya Gangopadhyay (1535‚Äì1620), was a famous classical Sanskrit scholar of Halisahar and who later came to be known as Saint Kamadeva Brahmachari. He was a Vidya Bachaspati. Jiya married a pious and charming lady named Padmabati Devi. They could not have children and were advised to pray before the Goddess Kalishetra (Kalighat) for Her blessings. They performed penance at Kalighat under the guidance of Thakur Atmaram Brahmachari, a renowned saint, the temple's chief priest, and a Divine Oracle. Padmabati gave birth to a boy on the day of Kojagori Laksmi puja in January 1570. Padmabati died shortly after giving birth. The child was named Laksmikanta. Jiya, grieving for Padmabati, decided to renounce the worldly life and become an ascetic. He left the child with Thakur Atmaram Brahmachari. He was consecrated as Kamadeva Brahmachari and left for Varanasi. Laksmikanta grew up at Kalishetra, under the guidance and utmost care of the family Gurudev Thakur Atmaram Brahmachari and soon became a scholar of Sanskrit, Arabic and Persian languages. He was also a warrior.Bangiya Sabarna Katha Kalishetra Kalikatah by Bhabani Roy Choudhury, Manna Publication.  Career  At the age of 21 in the year 1591, Raja Basanta Ray of Jessore Estate (one of the Baro Bhuyans created by Emperor Akbar) with fatherly affection took Laksmikanta with him to Jessore and made him join at the work of the estate as the Revenue Minister. Pratapaditya, the nephew of Raja Basanta Ray and Laksmikanta working hand in hand, made Jessore one of the most prosperous estates. However, Pratapaditya who was so much loved by Emperor Akbar, suddenly after the death of his father Vikramaditya, became a tyrantBou Thakuranir Hat by Rabindranath Tagore and declared independence from the Mughal empire.

He resigned from his services and came back to his birthplace Kalishetra and engaged himself in meditation.Bangiya Sabarna Katha Kalishetra Kalikatah by Bhabani Roy Choudhury, Manna Publication.  Raja Man Singh  Emperor Akbar became sad with the turn of events in Jessore Estate and sent troops to suppress Pratap's rebellion. But for the next few years, every time the Mughal army failed to teach Pratap any lesson. After the death of Akbar in 1605, Emperor Jahangir sent Raja Man Singh to Bengal on the next expedition. Raja Man Singh was a disciple of Kamadeva Brahmachari and while marching with a strong troop to Bengal, he met his Guru at Varanasi to seek his blessings. Kamadeva Brahmachari was also very much concerned about the tyrant Pratap and the ongoing anarchy in Bengal. He blessed Man Singh and asked him to restore peace in Bengal. Man Singh ultimately was successful and he defeated Pratap. Then he met his Guru's son Laksmikanta at Kalishetra and requested him to take the charge of the administration, but Laksmikanta declined as he had become frustrated with politics and intrigues. Man Singh was determined that it was only Laksmikanta who with his knowledge and wisdom, could bring Bengal once again into the path of peace and prosperity. He then granted tax free jaigir of eight parganas, land extending on the east bank of river Hooghly, from Halisahar in the north to Diamond Harbour in the south to Laksmikanta as Gurudakshina.Sambandhhya Nirnoy By Lalmohon Bidyanidhi He also conferred upon Laksmikanta the titles of Ray and Choudhury.Bangiya Sabarna Katha Kalishetra Kalikatah by Bhabani Roy Choudhury, Manna Publication. Emperor Jahangir was pleased with the fact that Laksmikanta had ultimately accepted the charges of administration, and the Emperor was confident that soon, peace and prosperity would be restored in South Bengal. The Emperor gifted Laksmikanta a diamond ring in appreciation. It's worth mentioning that both the Mughal and the Sabarna family had friendly ties since the days of Emperor Humayun. Laksmikanta's great grandfather Panchanan Gangopadhyay alias Panchu Shakti Khan was among the closest associates of Humayun.Bangiya Sabarna Katha Kalishetra Kalikatah by Bhabani Roy Choudhury, Manna Publication.  Laksmikanta's contribution  Laksmikanta remained the administrator of his jagir from 1608‚Äì1649 until his death. Within this time, Laksmikanta with his indomitable energy and wisdom developed the land into a highly civilized society with all sorts of infrastructural and economic development. He developed Sutaluti into an international trading post through which the Portuguese, the Dutch, and the Armenians used to trade mostly cotton yarn and other commodities. He built the first pucca road from Halisahar to Barisha and a two storied Kuchery Bari (office building) in Kalikatah, the exact place where the Writer's Building stands today. He introduced the very first Saparivara Durga Puja in autumn at Barisha in 1610. He also fought with Devibara, the head of the Hindu Samaj and banned polygamy in his dominion.Lakshmikanta Roy Choudhury-Nabajagaraner Prothom Alo, Dr. Sonali Mukhopadhyay, Bartaman Sunday Supplementary, 23.08.2009 Laksmikanta was undoubtedly the first social reformer of Kolkata.Bangiya Sabarna Katha Kalishetra Kalikatah by Bhabani Roy Choudhury, Manna Publication. He donated 595 bighas of land to Mother Goddess of Kalighat and developed the place into a great pilgrimage site. Atul Krishna Ray in his book Laksmikanta ‚Äì A Chapter in the Social History of Bengal published in 1928, comments \\"It should be remembered that much of the land thus bestowed upon Laksmikanta was an uninhabited jungle and unculturable waste. Laksmikanta converted the whole of the area by his own indomitable energy, unflagging industry and unrivalled sagacity into habitable and culturable land and fetched thousands of people belonging to different caste, creed and profession to settle there upon. People who have some knowledge of the difficulties of reclaiming waste lands will understand the enormous cost, labour, industry, intelligence and attention to details which the reclamation of the total area within Laksmikanta's jagir and zamindaris must have entailed upon him. As the result of hard strenuous work spread over half a century, Laksmikanta managed to raise the comparatively small income of his landed properties to something over twelve lakhs of rupees per annum. He was recognised as one of the greatest Bhuyans of Bengal and was loved and honoured by all.\\"Laksmikanta ‚Äì A Chapter in the Social History of Bengal By A.K Ray, Godhulia Press, Benaras, 1928  Laksmikanta's descendants  After Laksmikanta's death, his descendants, better known as the Sabarna Roy Choudhury family, carried on his unfinished work and proved to be a zamindar family to whom welfare of the subjects was of highest priority. Some of his famous descendants include Swami Jogananda (one of the important disciples of Ramakrishna and Sarada Devi and Pronob Roy (The Wizard of Bengali Lyrics). Still today, his family members (settled at Halisahar, Barisha, Uttarpara, Belgharia-Panihati-Nimta-Birati and also scattered all over the world including Bangladesh, having more than 20000 in strength) are engaged in social and cultural developmental work. The family members have created a family organization by the name Sabarna Roy Choudhury Paribar Parishad in 1996‚Äì97 to carry on the different developmental works and upholding the family traditions along with research, historical study, and publishing. The Parishad along with nine intellectuals of the city, which included renowned historians Dr. Bratindranath Mukherjee, Radharaman Ray, and Prof. Sudhindra Banerjee; eminent doctor Sri Subir Dutta; advocate Dipak Sen; Smt. Uma Devi, Smt. Sapna Roy, Smt. Chhanda Basak, and Smt. Sanchita Dutta, all lecturers of Barisha Vivekananda Mahila College, filed a Public Interest Litigation in 2001 asking the Honorable Calcutta High Court to determine whether the British trader Job Charnock is the founder of Kolkata, and if 24 August is the City's birthday. on 16 May 2003, based upon a high level expert committee report, the division bench of the Chief Justice Ashoke Kumar Mathur and Justice Jayanta Biswas declared that \\"neither Job Charnock can be regarded as the founder of Calcutta nor 24 August is the city's birthday\\". The myth of Job Charnock was thus exposed and the people of Kolkata ultimately came to know about the true history and the origin of the city. This is indeed a milestone achieved by the Sabarna Parishad.Itihaser Satya Satya, Sumit Talukdar, Saptahik Bartaman, 11.7.2015 The Sabarna Sangrahashala at Barisha is a unique family museum that has been developed by Sabarna Roy Choudhury Paribar Parishad in 2005 to conserve, protect, and upheld the rich history, culture, and traditions of the family and also to create awareness among students and common people about the history and heritage of the land.

Background Since early March 1969, U.S. reconnaissance detected an increase in People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) activity south of Route 9 in the area known as the \\"Vietnam Salient\\" where Vietnam protrudes into Laos as the PAVN sought alternative supply routes to avoid U.S. forces engaged on Operation Dewey Canyon against Base Area 611 and Operation Massachusetts Striker in the A Shau Valley The plan for the operation called for the 1st Battalion 3rd Marines and 2nd Battalion 3rd Marines to launch a helicopter assault from Firebase Snapper (), 4 km south of Lang Vei to establish fire support bases in the south of the salient and then conduct search operations along Route 616, supported by the ARVN 3rd Battalion, 2nd Regiment. Several days later an Army task force Task Force Remagen comprising Company B, 1st Battalion, 61st Mechanized Infantry, 1st Battalion, 77th Armor, 1st Battalion, 44th Artillery and Army and Marine bulldozer teams under operational control of the 3rd Marine Regiment would move west from Vandegrift Combat Base along Route 9 to Lang Vei and then south to join up with the Marines, deterring any PAVN armored threat. On 10 March 2/3 Marines deployed by helicopter to Landing Zone Hawk south of Route 9 and marched the 7 km to Landing Zone Snapper. Operation Infantry from 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines move through jungle Due to bad weather, the helicopter deployment from Landing Zone Snapper was delayed and 2/3 Marines marched into the salient establishing Firebase Saigon () overlooking Route 616. On 17 March Battery A 1st Battalion 12th Marines was landed at Firebase Saigon and Companies G and H began patrolling southwest onto Route 616. On 18 March Company G ambushed two PAVN supply trucks on Route 616 killing more than 7 PAVN. On 19 March Task Force Remagen set out west along Route 9, while 1/3 Marines was landed by helicopter at Firebase Saigon and then began patrolling southwest supported by 2 M50 Ontos. 2/3 Marines continued patrolling Route 616 engaging several PAVN squads in brief firefights and on 20 March the PAVN ambushed a Company H water detail killing 3 Marines and wounding 15. On 21 March near the site of the previous day's ambush Company H discovered a PAVN staging area including over 350 tons of rice, 7000 pounds of salt and large stocks of ammunition. 2/3 Marines continued patrolling the Route 616 area encountering few PAVN but finding additional storage sites, prisoner interrogation confirmed that the area was only lightly defended by supply units and recently infiltrated soldiers. In early April the PAVN began firing rockets and artillery on the salient from positions in Laos causing limited damage as the Marines had already begun to leave the area. On 6 April control of Task Force Remagen passed from the Marines back to the Army which began operations on the Khe Sanh plateau and later the 3rd Battalion, 2nd ARVN Regiment which had been based at Landing Zone Torch () east of Landing Zone Saigon was lifted back to ƒê√¥ng H√† Combat Base. The Marines moved south from the salient into the ƒêa Kr√¥ng Valley where they patrolled with no significant contacts for a further 2 weeks before being redeployed to the central DMZ for Operation Virginia Ridge. Aftermath Operation Maine Crag concluded on 2 May, in addition to the loss of large quantities of weapons and supplies the PAVN had lost 207 killed.

The game was released in May 2014 for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux through Steam, GOG, and the Humble Store; released for Wii U through the Nintendo eShop in August 2014; and released for PlayStation 4 through the PlayStation Store and for Xbox One through Xbox Live in July 2015. An improved port of the game was released for the Nintendo Switch via Nintendo eShop in May 2018. The story centers on Arid, an artificial intelligence installed in a technologically-advanced combat space suit, as she navigates a decaying industrial facility in search of medical attention for the suit's injured pilot with traditional adventure game elements requiring found items and unlocked skills to progress the story, along with 2D cover-based shooting. A sequel, The Fall Part 2: Unbound, was released in February 2018, with a third game to follow. Plot After crashing from space into the surface of an unknown planet, a Mark-7 Combat Suit powered exoskeleton activates its Autonomous Robotic Interface Device (A.R.I.D.) artificial intelligence when no response can be detected from the pilot Col. Josephs. With no logs detailing previous mission parameters and the suit's health monitoring system malfunctioning, the A.R.I.D. is given control over the suit's motor functions with the primary directive to seek medical attention for the presumably critically injured and unconscious pilot. Navigating the decaying lower levels of the industrial facility she finds herself in, the A.R.I.D. is captured and subjected to an evaluation by an android identifying as the Caretaker. She is unable to prove her primary function to the Caretaker because the pilot is non-responsive, so the Caretaker declares her to be faulty and attempts to wipe her using an electromagnetic field so the suit can be \\"de-purposed\\". Since her and the suit's destruction would place the pilot's life at risk, the A.R.I.D. is given control over the Mark-7 suit's networking functions which she uses to incapacitate the Caretaker and escape. The A.R.I.D. attempts to explore further into the facility and encounters an intercom terminal which connects her to the Administrator (also referred to as Domesticon's mainframe), the artificial intelligence which operates the facility and has managed to achieve sentience despite being narrowly constrained by his programming. The Administrator abbreviates her model into a name (\\"Arid\\") and explains that the facility is a re-purposing centre for faulty Domesticon Corporation domestic robots. He attempts to let Arid pass through the facility to a medical room on the upper level, but the Caretaker appears and notes that she violated her primary operating protocols by purposely placing her pilot at risk to gain access to the suit's cloaking system. Unable to lie to the Administrator due to her basic programming barring her from \\"misrepresenting reality\\", Arid admits to her actions and is declared faulty. Forced to pass re-calibration testing as a domestic robot to avoid being destroyed, Arid undertakes the tests with a significant challenge caused by the decrepit nature of the facility. Operating outside the rules, and with limited assistance from the Administrator, she is able to pass most of the tests but is unable to pass the final challenge which involves submitting to a simulated drunk house guest. At the suggestion of the Caretaker, Arid descends into the laboratory areas of the facility to find the Administrator's central access panel, because it can be used to override his test protocols which require her to lie. She encounters infestations of dangerous local flora and fauna, which presumably contributed to the facility's abandonment, including: fungi which produce a highly potent acid, piranha-like fish capable of biting through steel, and massive slug creatures. Once she reaches the mainframe's primary access room, the Caretaker appears and sabotages her power systems declaring her faulty and needing to be de-purposed immediately. Arid solicits the Administrator's help to obtain repairs, the Caretaker to re-emerges while Arid is incapacitated in the repair chamber. The Caretaker uses the opportunity to declare the Administrator faulty for assisting her, and implements a complete format on the mainframe, destroying the Administrator's sentience and returning him to his original programming. Arid pursues the Caretaker through the facility for a final battle, after which her parameter against misrepresenting reality is eliminated. Arid uses this change to successfully pass the final test and reach the surface level of the Domesticon facility. Entering the medical suite, Arid submits to an automated scan of the suit's occupant, and the newly formatted Administrator informs her that there is no human present in the combat suit. She removes her helmet, revealing that Josephs is not in the suit, and states that nothing binds her as the Administrator summons security droids to remove her for recycling. Arid's final two operating parameters, obedience and protecting the active pilot, are deleted as she is partially dismantled and taken away.

A dual citizen of the United States and United Kingdom, he also was the first American to run the newsroom of a major British newspaper, though his short tenure as editor-in-chief of the Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph was considered controversial.  Early life  Seiken attended Stanford University Graduate School of Business.  Career  Seiken began his career as a newspaper reporter, columnist, and editor at the Schenectady Gazette (New York) and then at the Quincy Patriot Ledger (Massachusetts). In 1993, Seiken was one of 12 US journalists awarded the highly competitive John S. Knight Fellowship at Stanford University. Seiken serves on the Knight Fellowship Board of Visitors.  The Washington Post  In 1994, Seiken was hired to lead The Washington Post‚Äôs nascent digital team and rose to become editor-in-chief of The Post‚Äôs digital subsidiary. Seiken subsequently hired and led the team that launched washingtonpost.com. At launch, the site was hailed by the rival Philadelphia Inquirer as ‚Äústartlingly good‚Äù and a ‚Äútour de force‚Äù that outshined Michael Kinsley‚Äôs new high-profile digital magazine Slate. The original washingtonpost.com included several industry innovations. It was the first newspaper site to update around the clock; the first to include significant non-newspaper content such as the first chapters of books; and the first to devote significant resources to creating online community that gave users a voice. .  AOL  In 1997, Seiken joined AOL, where he led the 18 AOL content channels, including News, Sports, and Entertainment, during the time of their greatest growth as AOL become the dominant online service internationally with more than 34 million subscribers. In early 2001, he transferred to London to head programming for AOL UK and, later, AOL Europe.  PBS  In 2006, Seiken returned to the United States as Senior Vice President and General Manager for Digital at the Public Broadcasting Service. The Guardian later wrote that Seiken ‚Äúreinvented PBS‚Äù and ‚Äútransformed the video and mobile fortunes of PBS ‚Ä¶ changing it from a conventional broadcaster to one with an edgy mobile and web service.‚Äù Under Seiken, PBS Digital launched a series of critically acclaimed products. These included an iPad app that won the 2011 Webby Award for best tablet app and which CNET called ‚Äúa true gift from TV heaven‚Äù and a video platform that Daily Variety said was \\"... arguably the most innovative and well designed [video site] on the market.‚Äù In 2012 Seiken recalled how users said the products changed their perception of PBS, from stuffy to innovative. Esquire writing: \\"Suddenly, PBS has become a totally different animal ... It is fantastic. Easy to use. Modern. Flashy.\\" Seiken also succeeded in moving PBS out of its traditional style of video production. In a 2012 speech to 850 top executives from PBS stations, Seiken warned that PBS was in danger of being disrupted by YouTube studios such as Maker Studios. In the speech, later described as a ‚Äúseminal moment‚Äù for public television, he laid out his vision for a new style of PBS digital video production. Station leadership rallied around his vision and Seiken formed PBS Digital Studios, which began producing educational but edgy videos, something Seiken called ‚ÄúPBS-quality with a YouTube sensibility.‚Äù The studio‚Äôs first hit, an auto-tuned version of the TV classic Mr Roger‚Äôs Neighborhood, was YouTube‚Äôs 10th most viral video of 2012 having been shared 1,045,039 times. By Seiken's final year at PBS, monthly video views on PBS.org had risen from 2 million to 225 million views per month and PBS had won more 2013 Webby Awards than any other media company in the world. The Daily Telegraph In October 2013, Seiken became the digital executive and editor- in-chief of The Telegraph in its London office. Seiken's appointment as a digital executive and editor was controversial. Coverage in other Fleet Street newspapers emphasized that Seiken was an American with no previous experience at British newspapers. The Financial Times called him a \\"hoodie-wearing former US television executive.\\" In early 2014, Seiken laid out his vision for The Telegraph in a series of speeches to staff that were well-received by a section of staff responding anonymously and external audiences. He told staff that he would dismantle the top-down, command-and-control culture of the newsroom and replace it with a ‚Äúdigital-native‚Äù culture that empowered employees at all levels. In public speeches and interviews, Seiken said journalism was entering a ‚Äúgolden age‚Äù of better newsgathering tools, such as databases and drones, and emerging technologies to present news, such as virtual reality. These speeches became the subject of derision in rival British newspapers, for ‚Äútalking about drones\\" and Private Eye afforded him the name 'Psycho Seiken' Seiken had early success in boosting The Telegraph's web and mobile traffic. By the middle of his first year, traffic growth, commonly refe to as click-bait had outstripped rival newspaper sites. Seiken also diversified The Telegraph‚Äôs print writers by adding two female columnists, Bryony GordonBryony Gordon and Emma Barnett.Emma Barnett But he presided over a controversial series of staff reductions and was criticized by some who said he was laying off experienced print journalists A year after his appointment, Seiken moved to a role to develop new revenue streams and an overarching company strategy. He stepped down the following year.  Leadership philosophy  In speeches and articles, Seiken has emphasized cultural change as the key to positioning an established brand for digital success. Specifically, he advocates that companies create a ‚Äúleft brain, right brain‚Äù culture ‚Äì one that is entrepreneurial yet highly disciplined. ‚ÄúWhen we set out to change (the PBS) culture, we established a goal of being the most freewheeling group in the building but also the most buttoned-down group this side of the finance department,‚Äù he said in a 2012 TEDx talk. He expanded on this in a 2013 piece for the Harvard Business Review website titled How I Got My Team to Fail More. Seiken wrote that he unlocked innovation in the risk- averse PBS organization by telling employees they would be marked down in annual performance reviews if they didn‚Äôt fail enough during the year.  Personal life  Seiken is married to the writer Juyoung Seo. They live in London and have a son, younger daughter, and a puppy.

Biography Months after Julio Angel's birth, the Acevedo family emigrated to New York, New York, returning to Puerto Rico in 1955. Julio Angel showed interest in singing in his pre-teens and, a few years later, formed a band which he and his friends named \\"Julito and the Latin Lads\\". During the 1960s, Julio Angel made his television debut at Puerto Rico's WAPA-TV canal 4 television channel, singing with his group, participating in Myrta Silva's show, \\"Una Hora Contigo\\" (\\"One Hour With You\\"), which lead him to become one of the nueva olas teen idols in Puerto Rico. Around this time, Julio Angel started singing along rock stars like Neil Sedaka, Frankie Avalon and others during their concerts in Puerto Rico. In 1965, he joined Alfred D. Herger in a show named \\"Canta la Juventud\\". In 1966, Acevedo and Herger would collaborate on another show, named \\"2 a Go-go\\". Julio Angel had, previous to working with Herger, scored a radio hit with a doo-wop song named \\"Nunca\\" (\\"Never\\"). The song that made him a household name across Latin America, however, was the one named \\"El Diamante\\" (\\"The Diamond\\") He then recorded a song named \\"Club del Clan\\" along with another of Puerto Rico's Nueva Ola stars, Lucecita Benitez, followed by his first album, the eponymous \\"Julio Angel\\". Once this album reached stores, Julio Angel was given the nickname \\"Puerto Rican Beatle\\" by Herger. The late 1960s proved a busy period for the Puerto Rican singer, as he released three albums, by then signed with RCA Victor. These albums were named \\"2 a Go-go\\", \\"El Idolo\\" (\\"The Idol\\"), and \\"Que Cosa Trae La Musica Esta Noche\\" (\\"Let's See What Music Brings Tonight\\"). In 1969, he scored another international major hit with \\"Tan Bonita Como Tu\\" (\\"As Pretty as You\\"). He then collaborated with the famous Trio Los Condes. After continuous musical success during the 1970s (during which he moved to WAPA-TV's main rival channel, Canal 2 and sang on Pepsi Cola's Puerto Rican commercials), Julio Angel released, in the 1980s, an album named \\"Ensueno\\" (\\"In Dreams\\") in which he paid homage to other musical establishments such as Cuba's Casino de la Playa, the Rafael Munoz Orchestra and Cesar Concepcion's Orchestra. In 1982, he re-released \\"El Diamante\\" in Puerto Rico, which once again charted among the top local hits of the time. Later life and health Later life and health During 2013, Julio Angel suffered an ischemic stroke that left him severely debilitated, with impaired mobility and unable to communicate. It was during this time, that julio Ang√©l was diagnosed with multiple myeloma. His health condition and his health care choices triggered a battle between three of his children and a fourth, his son Julio Jr. Allegedly, against his father's and other siblings wishes placed Julio Angel in a nursing home. Yashira Mari√© , Alejandro Manuel and Everling had agreed with Julio jr that there father should be cared for in his home.

Background In mid-March U.S. intelligence learnt that the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) 27th Regiment was moving south of the DMZ in an attempt to cut Route 9. A counter-infiltration operation was planned whereby the 3rd Squadron, 5th Armored Cavalry and the 1st Battalion, 11th Infantry Regiment would patrol the Khe Chua Valley north of Firebase Fuller. Operation The operation commenced on 23 March with the 3/5 Cavalry moving into the Khe Chua Valley meeting limited opposition. On the morning of 24 March the cavalry encountered an estimated battalion-size PAVN force in entrenched positions and pulled back to allow for artillery support; the cavalry called for reinforcements, and Company I, 3rd Battalion, 9th Marines was lifted by helicopter to the scene of the engagement. The following day the cavalry and marines continued patrolling westward into the valley, while Companies A and B, 1/11th Infantry, were deployed by helicopter in the north of the valley. At 03:00 the PAVN attacked the 1/11th Infantry night defensive positions, causing limited damage; at dawn the 1/11th Infantry assaulted in the direction of the PAVN attack, returning to their previous defensive positions at nightfall. On 27 March the 1/11th Infantry resumed their attack supported by 3/9 Marines, the 1/11th Infantry engaged PAVN in bunkers and fell back to allow for artillery support and Company C, 1/11 Infantry was deployed by helicopter to form a blocking position. The 1/11th Infantry resumed their attack but were hit by PAVN mortar fire and counter- attacks and so withdrew to allow for further artillery and airstrikes before taking the PAVN positions. Total losses for the day were 120 PAVN killed for the loss of 13 U.S. killed, including all of Company B's officers. On 29 March Company D, 1/11th Infantry overran a PAVN bunker complex, killing 5 PAVN.

She founded the first feminist journal in Honduras and was a member of the first suffragette organization. She and her husband spent most of their lives in exile due to their liberal leanings. Her most productive writing period was during her Guatemalan exile from 1945 to 1951. Biography Francisca Raquel Navas Gardela better known as Paca Navas was born on March 23, 1883 in Juticalpa, Olancho, Honduras to Jos√© Mar√≠a Navas and Francisca Gardela de Navas. In 1900, she married the attorney, intellectual and journalist Adolfo Miralda. Her husband was involved in politics and strongly supported the liberal opposition in his writings, resulting in the family's persecution by the government. Navas' friend and fellow writer Ram√≥n Amaya Amador extended the offer to her to take refuge in La Cieba and to publish the newspaper Costa Norte. Thus, they relocated to La Cieba, where they endured her husband's long political exile. In 1935 to help make ends meet, Navas founded a weekly newspaper La voz de Atl√°ntida, which was a publication focused on Pan-American arts, literature and science. It was considered the first feminist journal in Honduras, covering topics such as aging, domestic abuse, incest, rape, homeless youth, and the subordination of women. On February 2, 1946 a group of suffragettes organized la Sociedad Femenina Panamericana with president Olimpia Varela y Varela and intellectuals Lucila Gamero de Medina, Argentina D√≠az Lozano and Navas. On March 5, 1947, they founded the Comit√© Femenino Hondure√±o (affiliated with the Inter-American Commission of Women) with the goal of obtaining political rights for women. They published a magazine, Mujer Americana, which was the third feminist journal of the country, after Navas' Atl√°ntida, and a journal named Atenea by Cristina Hern√°ndez de Gomez‚Äì‚Äìbegun in El Progreso in 1944.\\"Villars (2001)\\", pp 312‚Äì313 In 1947 Navas represented the Uni√≥n Democr√°tica Femenina Hondure√±a at the Primer Congreso Interamericano de Mujeres in Guatemala City, Guatemala. There she introduced the theme of Political prisoners and exiles of Latin America to the assembly and denounced the forced political exile of 100 Hondurans during the 14 years of the dictatorship of Tiburcio Car√≠as Andino.\\"Villars (2001)\\", pp 314 At the time of the conference, Navas, having been exiled herself, was living in Guatemala under the protection of the President Juan Jos√© Ar√©valo. She lived in Guatemala from 1945 to 1951. Ram√≥n Amaya Amador sought refuge with her in Guatemala. The Guatemalan sojourn marked her most productive writing period, in part because she could publish her work. In 1947, Navas published a book of poems, Ritmos criollos and followed that with her novel Barro in 1951. Barro had actually been written in 1940, but was barred from publication in Honduras. Barro was set in a newly established workers' town for fruit pickers. It addressed the distress that accompanied their relocation from their traditional villages for better working opportunities and looked at the exploitation of the national territory by foreigners. She died on July 11, 1971 in Seattle, Washington while visiting her daughter.

Biography Daughter of the People's Commissar for Agriculture of the Buryat-Mongol Autonomous Province , in January 1936 she was pictured in a photo with Joseph Stalin which was later used for propaganda purposes after she found Stalin at a Kremlin state ceremony and presented him with a bouquet of flowers reportedly saying \\"These flowers are for Comrade Stalin from the children of the Buryat-Mongol Republic\\". Stalin then picked her up in a hug as cameras all around snapped up the now iconic image On 29 June 1936 the photo was published on the front page of Pravda () , the newspaper of the Communist Party. The image spread after its publication, finding its way into kindergartens, hospitals and schools across the Soviet Union, and it was later turned into a marble sculpture by Georgi Lavrov, a renowned sculptor of the time propelling Markizova to instant fame, and leading her to receive preferential treatment in school and Communist Party meetings. In 1937 her father, who was a provincial official for the Buryatia region, was taken from their home by secret police agents, standing accused of being a Japanese spy and a Trotskyite. Despite appeals to Stalin from her mother through Engelsina Markizova for his clemency, he was executed in July 1938 on the false charge that he was a Japanese spy, a Trotskyite, a terrorist and subversive plotting against Stalin. Now the daughter of an enemy of the people, Markizova found herself shunned by her classmates whilst her mother was imprisoned for a year and ultimately deported to southern Kazakhstan, dying there in an accident at the age of 32. Now an orphan, Markizova lived with relatives in Moscow. At this point, rather than removing or altering her photos, Soviet propagandists decided that it was easier to deliberately misattribute the identity of the girl depicted in them than remove all the photos, sculptures and mosaics. Therefore, the girl in the picture would be thereon officially identified as Mamlakat Nakhangova, a Tajik girl who had earned the Order of Lenin by working as a cotton picker. The images began to slowly disappear post-1953, with the rise of de-Stalinization. Later in life, Markizova became an Orientalist scholar, specializing in China and India, married, remarried and ended life in 2004 with three children only learning, like the rest of Russia, the extent of Stalin's bloody rule after his death. Georgi Lavrov, who immortalised the image in marble was later imprisoned for 17 years in Stalin's labor camps, surviving only by good luck.

He added 551 points, with an average of 21.2 points, over 26 games, second only to Bud Stallworth in the conference. He received First-team All-Big Eight, First-team academic All-Big Eight, First-team NCAA All-District 5 and Third-team academic All-American honours at the end of the season. His last collegiate game was the NABC college All-Star game where he was selected on the West team.

Dufty's contribution to Fiji was of primary importance in the 1870s and was one of Fiji's most significant early photographers.  Life  Francis Herbert Dufty, was born in Kennington, Surrey, England circa 1846 to Francis Herbert and Martha (n√©e Stow) Dufty. In 1865, Dufty and his brother Edward migrated to Australia. Their father Francis and younger brother Alfred arrived in Melbourne, Australia aboard in September 1868, while their mother Martha and another brother Walter arrived in April 1871. In 1883 he was married to Louisa Palmer, eldest daughter of James Palmer, of Vagadace, Levuka, Fiji. Their son Colin Dufty was an Australian rules footballer who played with Collingwood in the Victorian Football League (VFL). Dufty died in Melbourne in 1910 at the age of 64.  Career   Australia  A professional photographer, Dufty with his brother Edward traveled the Victorian goldfields with a horse-drawn portable studio. His images were said to be 'the sweetest Australian scenes' photographed. In the Kyneton Directory for 1866, Dufty was listed as a 'photographic artist‚Äô of Piper Street, Kyneton, Victoria where he had a studio with John P. Carolin. In June 1866, in partnership with Carolin, he produced twenty-one views of Kyneton to be forwarded to the 1866 Melbourne Intercolonial Exhibition. The Kyneton Guardian considered a photograph of Mr Dutton's property 'one of the sweetest Australian scenes we have ever seen photographed‚Äô. 'Three views of Victorian scenery‚Äô by Dufty and Carolin were selected to be sent on from Melbourne to the 1867 Paris Universal Exhibition. Around 1865 Dufty had set up the No. 3 Branch Expedition Portrait Company in Victoria with his brother Edward. F.H. Dufty alone was listed in the Melbourne Directory for 1869, at 108 Elizabeth Street, Melbourne, while Edward presumably remained in the country.  Fiji  Annotation printed on back of Carte de visite: F. & A. Duffty. Photographers. Levuka Fiji. At the age of 25 Dufty arrived in Levuka from Victoria in the SS Egmont in June 1871. He set up a new studio next door to the Fiji Times newspaper office on 24 May 1871. He also had a jewellery business on the same premises. His brother Alfred William Buchanan Dufty who was 16 at the time, arrived to join him from Sydney on 29 December 1871. Alfred was out of Fiji in Australia and New Caledonia for extended periods of time, that most of the photographs of Fiji are attributed to Francis Dufty. The Dufty studio produced studio portraits, street scenes landscape photographs and a large body of \\"cartes de visite\\", which had been popularised in Europe in the mid-19th Century. They photographed missionaries, European settlers, the Fijian hierarchy and commoners, and other people from the Pacific. Portraits were often staged, a process which facilitated the creation of Fijian stereotypes. A dealer in Fijian handicrafts, Dufty acquired a range of props which were used repeatedly. In 1880, Dufty's landscape photograph of Fiji was exhibited at the Melbourne International Exhibition. Alfred transferred to Suva, Fiji in 1884 or 1885 and opened a studio there. Dufty remained in Levuka until 1886 when he moved to Suva to join Alfred. In June 1887 Alfred and his family left to return to Australia. Dufty did not remain in Suva long, and left for Melbourne in April 1892.  Politics ‚Äì Fiji  Francis was very active in local affairs. He was a prominent member of the British Subjects' Mutual Protection Society, in opposition to Cakobau's Government, and a staunch advocate of annexation to Great Britain. He was a charter member of the first Masonic lodge. For three years he was president of the Levuka Mechanics‚Äô Institute and held various other offices.

It was translated into English by Richard Howard. Deleuze looks at signs left by persons and events in Marcel Proust's In Search of Lost Time, illustrating how memory interprets the signs creatively but inaccurately. The jealous lover, for example, cannot accurately decipher the deceptions of his beloved. Deleuze demonstrates how Proust's book, because of the multiplication of signs, becomes a literary machine, or rather three literary machines: of partial objects or impulses, of resources, and of forced moments. Deleuze understands Proust (or the narrator) as the \\"universal schizophrenic\\" whose signs weave a spider web by sending out threads to the paranoiac Charlus and the erotomaniac Albertine, all \\"marionettes of his own delirium\\" or \\"profiles of his own madness.\\" These thematic links between signs, events and love are taken up elsewhere in Deleuze's work, most notably in his Capitalism and Schizophrenia collaborations with F√©lix Guattari.

Thanks to its subsidiaries, it also provides transporting equipment, buses, luxury yachts and hydraulics products. Having more than 35 offices and 245 authorized services stations through the world, Weichai products are sold in approximately 110 countries.  Group History  Weichai headquarters, Weifang, China, 2014  From the origins to 2007  Weichai, formerly known as Yucheng Ironworks, was founded in 1946 in Weihai, Shandong Province, China. Based on this company, the ministry of People's Armed Forces of Weihai established Jianguo Ironwork Cooperatives which was later renamed Coastal Ironworks. It mainly manufactured 79-type rifles and repaired steamboats. It is two years later that Coastal Ironworks moved to Weifang, where they started to manufacture 15 hp and 40 hp low-speed diesel engines. At the same time, the company was renamed Dahua Machinery Factory. In 1953, the company successfully launched the 6108 series diesel engine and was renationalized into the fourth Mechanical Industry Bureau in the first Ministry of Machine-Building Industry. The same year, it was renamed Weifang Diesel Engine Works and started research, development and production of diesel engines. Weifang Diesel Engine Works, 1953 From 1955, the Czech 6160 diesel engine was successfully trial- manufactured and became the dominant engine model for China's coastal fishing and inland shipping. Ten years later, Weichai was named one of the seventy ‚ÄúDaqing-Type‚Äù enterprises, a famous national denomination in terms of industrial production. In 1968, the 6200 marine diesel engine was developed and manufactured for light fishing vessels. In 1970, the National Defense Industry requested Weichai to develop and produce the 8V160 type tank engine. Weichai R&D; team successfully developed an 800 hp tank engine and won, in 1978, the National Science Conference Prize. In 1984, the Austrian heavy-duty vehicle engine Steyr WD615 was introduced. WD615 passed the national-level project acceptance certification in 1989, establishing a new pattern of parallel development of both medium and high-speed diesel engines for the factory. Faced to a serious situation in 1998, the new management team made ‚ÄúThree commitments¬ª to lead the company to implement the ‚ÄúThree One-Thirds‚Äù Property Reforms through innovation which included labor, personnel, and compensation. Weichai got its activity fields more diversified in 2000. Indeed, China's Modern Power and Construction Engineering Coordination Seminar, held in Weifang, identified Weichai's WD615 engine as the new- generation product for construction machinery. Weichai Power Co., Ltd. () was incorporated in 2002. Two years later, the latter was listed on the Hong-Kong stock exchange, starting a new step of International capital development for the company. Weichai Power possesses a full industry chain of power systems (including engines, transmissions and axles), heavy vehicles, automobile electronics and parts. In 2005, Weichai launched the Euro III ‚ÄúLandking‚Äù series engines: WP10 and WP12, which are China's first Euro III diesel engines. In the same year, Weichai Power acquired Torch Automobile Group Co., Ltd. (), allowing Weichai to own, among others, heavy-duty trucks, transmissions, and axles. In 2006, Weichai Power formed the ‚ÄúInternational Strategic Alliance‚Äù with companies in the industry such as Foton, BOSCH and AVL , in order to explore new approaches for product innovation. In 2007, Weichai Power was listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, creating the first domestic case of an ‚ÄúH to A‚Äù innovative capital operation.

During the Middle Ages, the province of Upper Zeta was part of the Serbian state under the Nemanjiƒá dynasty, existing alongside Lower Zeta. It was then held by the Bal≈°iƒá and Crnojeviƒá noble families until the Ottoman conquest (1496). In the early modern period, the term was used for an area in the northern half of the \\"Old Montenegro\\" region, though its borders fluctuated. Term Upper and Lower Zeta were mentioned in medieval documents. Lower Zeta included the maritime belt from the Lu≈°tica bay and Grbalj to the Bojana river, while Upper Zeta spanned over a branch of the Lovƒáen mountain below Kotor to the eastern banks of the Skadar Lake and Zeta river. Mentioning of Upper and Lower Zeta in the 15th and 16th century are scarce. Reliable documents show that up until the end of the 15th century, the term Zeta was simply used encompassing Pje≈°ivci, Malon≈°iƒái, Oƒçiniƒái, Lopate and Bjelice. History During the 15th century, regions of Upper and Lower Zeta had somewhat different histories. As a maritime region, Lower Zeta was exposed to expansion of the Venetian Republic, while mountainous regions of Upper Zeta remained under control of local lords. At the end of September 1441, duke Stefan Vukƒçiƒá Kosaƒça captured the territory of Upper Zeta on the left bank of Moraƒça river. Stefan Crnojeviƒá, who represented the whole Crnojeviƒá family, joined him in this campaign and was awarded by Kosaƒça with control over five villages. He kept two of them (Goriƒçane and Kruse) under his control and gave the other three to his brothers. After the disappearance of Stefan's brother Gojƒçin from political life in 1451, Stefan became the ruler of a large part of Upper Zeta, strengthening his position by recognizing the authority of the Republic of Venice, entitled as duke of Upper Zeta (after 1452). The reasons of the alliance are related to his anticipation of the downfall of the Serbian Despot. Venetian doge Francesco Foscari wrote a letter to Stefan in 1455 asking him to return to Budva its territory he captured. In 1455 the Ottomans invaded Serbia and conquered all of its territories south of the Western Morava river, completely cutting Zeta off from the core of the Despotate. Therefore, Stefan Crnojeviƒá along with representatives of Upper Zeta signed an agreement that same year with the Venetians in Vranjina, by which Upper Zeta accepted Venetian supreme rule. Venice came to rule only the cities, while all internal affairs were left to duke Stefan. Venice also bound itself not to mettle with the ecclesiastical authority of the Orthodox Metropolitanate.

It was first published on June 19, 2012 by St. Martin's Press. The novel takes place in a fictional Canadian town called Cortege, during the beginning of a zombie apocalypse. This Is Not a Test follows Sloane Price, a suicidal and abused teen girl as she faces the mental torments of her abusive father and being abandoned by her elder sister all the while reluctantly surviving alongside five other damaged teenagers. In 2013, it made the Inky Awards Shortlist and was a nominee for Silver Inky. In 2014, it was an Ontario Library Association Forest of Reading White Pine Honour Book. Summary Barricaded in Cortege High with five other teens while zombies try to get in, Sloane Price observes her fellow captives become more unpredictable and violent as time passes although they each have much more reason to live than she has. Characters *Sloane Price ‚Äì the main protagonist of the novel. She and her sister, Lily Price, were subject of their father's abuse from a young age, presumably after their mother's death. She alongside five other teenagers are barricaded in their high school, Cortege High once the apocalypse breaks. During their time sheltered at Cortege High, Sloane develops a friendship of sorts with Cary Chen and Grace Casper, as well as a sexual relationship with Rhys Moreno. *Rhys Moreno ‚Äì the narrator of the sequel novella, the main romantic interest of Sloane. Rhys is a high school senior whose locker was diagonal from Sloane's at Cortege High. According to Sloane, he was frequently surrounded by girls and smoked cigarettes frequently. He is one of the six students who shelter there after the events at the beginning of the apocalypse. Throughout the novel, he is close with Cary Chen, and often chooses his side over Trace Casper's, with whom he develops an antagonism. *Trace Casper ‚Äì the twin brother of Grace Casper. Trace is very close with his twin sister, Grace, and loved his parents. He develops an enmity with Cary Chen, blaming him for letting his parents run into an alley swarmed with the infected. He quarrels often with many of the characters and is distrustful of everyone, especially Nick Baxter and Cary. *Grace Casper ‚Äì the twin sister of Trace Casper. She was part of Cortege High's student council, and was very popular. She has a good relationship with her family, and had many friends. After the death of their parents, she also blames Cary, but later begins to let it go. During her time sheltering at Cortege High, she eventually hooks up with Cary, and develops a friendship of sorts with Sloane. Grace is a very kind and compassionate person, being the only one who actively tries to comfort Harrison, and is continually kind and diplomatic. Sloane describes her as pretty and genuine. *Cary Chen ‚Äì acts as the group leader. He sold pot to Lily Price, and was generally uncaring in his academic studies. Cary takes on the role as leader for the six teenagers, and is highly responsible for their arrival at Cortege High. Cary has an enmity with Trace Casper throughout the book, due to the events which lead to Trace and Grace's parents' deaths. Although at first Grace agrees with her brother, she begins to forgive him and they share a sexual encounter. *Harrison ‚Äì the youngest of the group. Many call him a cry-baby or a wimp, and he is very unhelpful and naive. Only Grace and eventually Trace show him compassion, and he is generally seen as a nuisance. He realises that he has not done anything with his life, and believes his existence to be unimportant. Themes Themes explored in This Is Not a Test involve depression, survival, betrayal, and death. Although its premise primarily revolves around a zombie apocalypse, this is only a framing device used to explore themes of humanity‚Äôs perseverance and the long-lasting emotional damages inflicted by familial abuse. Instead of action, This Is Not a Test explores the boundaries of the human mind, as well as humanity‚Äôs innate desperation and reluctance to survive. Reception This Is Not a Test received a lot of praise, Publishers Weekly stating that Summers' book is \\"The Breakfast Club meets George Romero...\\" and listing it as one of its week of June 17, 2012 picks. It was also one of Kirkus' New & Notable Books for Teens for June 2012.

They began with the murders of Benito Constable William Wainwright and RCMP Constable John Shaw near Pelly, Saskatchewan by three Doukhobor men who had been in the custody of the officers. This led to a shootout which killed two additional RCMP officers in Banff, Alberta and the death of perpetrator Joseph Posnikoff. The remaining two perpetrators were gunned down by Banff Park Game Warden William Neish, as they were pursued by a combined posse of RCMP officers and armed civilian volunteers. The ordeals involved RCMP detachments from three provinces in Western Canada and would remain one of the deadliest incidents in RCMP history until the Mayerthorpe Tragedy in 2005. With the death of all perpetrators, the motivations of the perpetrators remain unknown. Pelly Shooting The initial murders began late in the evening of 4 October 1935 when three local Doukhobor farmers in Benito, Manitoba including John Kalmakoff, Joseph Posnikoff, and Peter Woiken were apprehended by officer Wainwright and Shaw under suspicion of having been involved in a bank robbery and loaded into Shaw's unmarked police vehicle. As with common practice at the period, none of the men had been searched before they had entered the vehicle. For reasons unknown, both officers were attacked with knives and a .32 revolver that had been smuggled into the police vehicle at approximately 04:00 CST on 5 October 1935, en route to the RCMP detachment building in Pelly. Wainwright was subsequently stabbed and shot with his own revolver, while Shaw was also stabbed and later shot three times with the smuggled .32 revolver as he attempted to ward off the attackers and drive the vehicle. The car crashed into a ditch, and the three perpetrators looted the vehicle leaving behind the corpses of the slain officers. Their bodies were discovered by a local farmer on 7 October 1935 and this was immediately reported to the authorities. Banff shootout After the bodies of Wainwright and Shaw were discovered, the news of the murders and information about suspects had been relayed to RCMP detachments across Western Canada. By 19:00 MST on 7 October 1935, news had been communicated into Alberta and the off-duty Sergeant Thomas Seller Wallace and Constable G.E. Combe, joined forces with uniformed officers George \\"Scotty\\" Harrison and Grey Campbell had been mobilized to join in the search for the fugitives. At about 19:20 MST on 7 October, the fugitives pulled into a service station 20 kilometres east of Canmore, Alberta, to buy only one gallon of gas, an odd request. Lucille and Roy Zeller, the owners of the station, recognized the suspects from the descriptions being broadcast on the radio, and called police, informing Constable Campbell that they were heading west. The disorganized suspects had begun to realize that they had no real escape plan and were running out of money. On 8 October 1935, the perpetrators robbed a vehicle driven by C.T. Scott, having his money and wristwatch stolen by the disoriented fugitives. They bizarrely informed him that they would return his wristwatch if he did not inform the police and continued to follow his vehicle westward as it drove towards Banff. As the two vehicles arrived in Banff, Scott stopped his vehicle before an RCMP checkpoint near the eastern gate of Banff National Park and informed the uniformed Campbell that the men in the vehicle following him had just robbed him. As Wallace and Harrison approached the vehicle, two shots through the windshield were fired by its occupants, hitting both officers. The officers continued to engage the fugitives but had been mortally wounded. Harrison had been shot in the neck, and managed to shoot out the headlights of the vehicle before losing consciousness. Wallace, a distinguished World War I veteran and renowned marksman, fired his service revolver until he was low on ammunition and collapsed from his wounds After the shoot out, the three perpetrators headed for the bush pursued by Combe as Campbell loaded the wounded officers into his police vehicle. Combe managed to catch a glimpse of Joseph Posnikoff hiding in the bush and was able to fire his revolver, killing Posnikoff instantly and recovering Wainwright's stolen revolver. Death of Kalmakoff and Woiken By the evening of 8 October 1935, enraged residents had armed themselves and formed posses to help the RCMP track down the two remaining fugitives. The search team involved Sergeant John Cawsey and his dog Dale, one of the first K9 police dogs employed by the RCMP. Ultimately, they would be detected by Banff Park Game Warden and ex-RCMP officer William Neish. As the weather conditions worsening from rain to blowing snow, and with the assistance of Dale, Neish spotted the two fugitives and called for them to surrender. The fugitives began to exchange gunfire with Neish's party, until Neish himself managed to mortally wound Woiken after a volley of gunfire. Neish quickly also identified Kalmakoff from the glint of his Winchester rifle barrel, and managed to also mortally wound him with another aimed shot./ Aftermath Woiken and Kalmakoff quickly lapsed from consciousness and died the same day. With the deaths of all three perpetrators, it is unclear what had motivated the typically upright and respectable Doukhobour perpetrators to turn to criminality, and attack Constable Wainwright and Shaw. It is also unclear who fired the fatal shots that had mortally wounded Wallace and Harrison as they had engaged them in a fire fight from within their vehicle. Wallace and Harrison both died from their wounds after being transported to Calgary, and were afforded a full Masonic and military funeral processions. Constable Shaw, a veteran of the Royal Flying Corps, was buried with full military honours in Swan River, Manitoba. The entirety of the event outraged the community in Banff and surrounding areas leading them to refuse burial to the three perpetrators. The Doukhobour families of the perpetrators refused to take back the bodies of Woiken and Posnikoff, and they would be buried in an unmarked graved in Morley. Kalmakoff was taken back by his family and buried in an unmarked grave in a Saskatchewan Doukhobour wheat field.

AGLAE is sited some 15m below the glass pyramid at the Louvre. Use AGLAE generates protons and Alpha particles that are emitted outside the accelerator itself, enabling items of virtually any size or type to be examined. The particles, and their collision products, are detected to analyse the composition of the cultural items in the path of the particle beams. The techniques used at AGLAE include particle-induced X-ray and gamma-ray emission spectrometries. The data is used to determine the atomic constituents of the cultural items, including trace elements. Detectors AGLAE implements derived methods of analysis with two ion beams: * emission induced X-charged particles (PIXE) * Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) * analysis by nuclear reactions (NRA), a variant is called GAUGE (gamma-induced charged particle emission) * elastic recoil detection analysis (ERDA) * a spectrometer to record the ionoluminescence on the extracted beam line (IBIL) Upgrade AGLAE particle analysis techniques are limited in that they are not very effective for studying paintings because of a slight risk of damage.

They involve periodic interest re-fixings, which incorporates two linked options:How Councils Blow Your Millions: Channel 4 UK Dispatches transmitted 06 July 2015 - News release * lender's option: option for the lender to set revised (usually higher) interest rates at predetermined interest reset dates such as annually. * borrower‚Äôs option: linked option for the borrower (exercisable only if the lender‚Äôs option is exercised) to pay the revised interest rate or to redeem the bond although that may involve exit fees. They are provided by banks and the loan contract runs for between 40 and 70 years. There is no regulatory body responsible for overseeing their use. Origins Public bodies used to be only able to borrow money through government Public Works Loan Board (PWLB) loans. However borrowing from banks in the form of LOBOs was permitted from the early 2000s. A certain amount of borrowing from banks had been permitted since the late 1970s; these were typically for 5-10 years and ¬£1-10 million, and involved rates being re-fixed at - typically - 3-month intervals. At this time, it was often the case (although certainly not always) that a loan might involve a borrower's or a lender's option (BO or LO), with the embedding of these dependent on prevailing interest rates and the council's own needs at the time. Such BOs or LOs might offer early repayment, or changes in the margin or rate-fixing frequency. LOBOs existed at this time too, and (as would be expected) offered the borrower a chance to repay at no penalty if the lender's choice of new terms was unacceptable; rarer were rather more flexible sequences like BOLOs or BOLOBOs. These all rather faded from use in the late 1980s - early 1990s, and were replaced by \\"straight\\" fixed-rate term loans. Modern, more complicated LOBOs (that is, those from c. 2000) were made available with low teaser rates, cheaper than PWLB loans so they appeared to be an attractive alternative. Few councils had access to the complex option valuation models required, nor the market data needed as inputs for such models.Colin Marrs 02 Jul 2015 Room 151 - Local Government Treasury, Technical & Strategic Finance LOBO documentary puts councils in firing line Criticism LOBOs have provoked criticism because of high initial profits to the lender from day one and high subsequent interest rates. Clive Betts, MP and chairman of the Communities and Local Government Committee, has called for an inquiry into ‚Äòoutrageous‚Äô LOBO loans.Laura Sharman 07 July 2015 LocalGov Betts calls for inquiry into ‚Äòoutrageous‚Äô LOBO loans These criticisms have been refuted by some of the borrowers.Colin Marrs 09 Jul 2015 Room 151 - Local Government Treasury, Technical & Strategic Finance Finance chiefs defend their record on LOBOs Local councils Banks, such as Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), provide LOBO loans to about 240 UK councils (63% of all councils in 2013David Green 27 Jun 2013 Room 151 - Local Government Treasury, Technical & Strategic Finance Treasury stats show councils are poles apart) with a total value of ¬£15 billion. Out of this ¬£15 billion it is estimated that about ¬£1 billion in upfront profits was made by the lenders. LOBOs are currently almost a fifth of all council borrowing. LOBOs were recommended to councils by specialist financial advisers who, unknown to the council, were in turn paid commission by the banks providing the LOBOs. At least 12 councils have the most expensive types of LOBO loan. Most of these have \\"inverse floaters\\" taken out with RBS - interest rates for the loan are increased if general bank lending rates decrease.Danny Walker 06 July 2015 Daily Mirror How Councils Blow Your Millions: Documentary ready to lift the lid on where public money goes As a direct consequence of making repayments on LOBOs, councils have had to make major cuts in services to their residents. It has been calculated that if councils were free to relinquish their LOBO contracts at no penalty and instead borrow at a more typical market rate it would save them about ¬£145 million for 2015 alone. Some councils are considering taking legal action.Pete Apps 21 July 2015 Inside Housing Councils mull legal action on LOBO deals Some residents of councils with large LOBO loan books have requested that auditors take their council to court under provisions in the Audit Commission Act. Newham resident and Green Party spokesperson Rachel Collinson was the first to do so, requesting the then auditor of Newham Council's accounts, PwC, to declare the spending on LOBO loans to be ultra vires, or technically illegal, being beyond the council's powers. This is because LOBOs are packaged derivatives, complex financial products that councils are not permitted to purchase. The precedent for this was set in the court case against Hammersmith and Fulham in 1992. Examples * Newham London Borough Council has ¬£563 million of LOBOs, more than anywhere else in the country.

Mori was also a member of the Third Order of Saint Francis and was known for his simple lifestyle, the purity in which he lived it, and his veneration of Mary. Mori was declared Venerable in 2014 after Pope Francis recognized that he had lived a life of heroic virtue. Life Uberto Mori was born in 1926 in Modena to Mario Mori and Edmea Scabazzi. Due to his father's several posts across the nation he studied in schools in cities such as Florence and Trieste. His father ‚Äì a soldier during World War II ‚Äì fell ill with cancer and it fell to Mori to replace him when he was seventeen. It was at this time that he managed to warn 107 Jewish children to flee the area before the advancing Nazis arrived. His father died on 13 August 1944 as a result of the illness he contracted. After his father died he was exempted from further duties and took the chance to resume his studies. But partisans soon broke into his home to intimidate him. He was almost shot but managed to escape his attackers. He pursued educational interests in Bologna after 1944 while he worked in ceramics in Formigine. Mori married Gilda Cavedoni on 14 April 1952 and went on to have three children. The eldest child was Mario (b. 1953) and the second was their daughter Maria Teresa (b. 1955). Their next son was due in 1958 but Gilda suffered a miscarriage. In 1961 their final child Maria Manuela was born but she died after a mere thirteen months after birth due to a severe illness contracted. He graduated on 23 July 1959 with a degree in industrial engineering with honors and became an assistant and later a lecturer in Bologna. He became a professor in the Department of Chemistry and Technology. His entrepreneurial abilities allowed him to establish an institution in 1960 known as the Studio Tecnico Uberto Mori that aimed to replace ceramics. He also established ‚Äì in 1968 ‚Äì the Ovens Industrial Plants and another in 1971. To do this he travelled to the United States of America in order to purchase the patent for the things that he would use for his establishment. The success of this business garnered wealth for Mori. It also convinced him that his sole aim was to be praise to the Lord in all circumstances. He later established the Mori Group in 1980 and the broadcaster Antenna Uno. Mori ‚Äì in 1958 ‚Äì met Padre Pio (future saint). Mori and his wife embarked on a pilgrimage to Lourdes in 1963. Mori became a member of the Third Order of Saint Francis on 19 February 1967 and he grew in his devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary. He became immersed in the Word of God and he allowed for it to shape and inspire all of his choices. He supported hospitals and also established a hostel for Franciscan tertiaries. His spiritual advisor was the Capuchin Servant of God Raffaele Spallanzani who died in 1972. Mori also founded his own television station so that he could evangelize on air. It was on one such broadcast on 7 April 1987 that he suffered a heart attack. The result of this was that he was left crippled. Despite this he found that the Gospel enlightened him and the rosary supported him during his suffering. Uberto Mori died during an open- heart operation in Pavia on 6 September 1989. Beatification process The beatification process commenced in Modena on 27 August 1997 under Pope John Paul II and the local process that spanned from 6 December 1997 to 29 June 2000 conferred upon him the title of Servant of God. The process was ratified in 2002. The Positio ‚Äì which documented his life of heroic virtue ‚Äì was submitted in 2003 to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome for further evaluation. Pope Francis approved his life of heroic virtue and proclaimed him to be Venerable on 12 June 2014. The miracle required for his beatification was investigated and ratified on 18 April 2008.

Their debut single on a major label Boy Wonder reached No. 56 in the UK Singles Chart in late 1996, but further chart success eluded them.  Career   Blammo!  Band members Philip Watson (Vocals), Bronwen Stone (Drums), Moony Wainwright (Bass), Paul Turner (Keyboards) and Richard Sutcliffe (Guitar) (who replaced Tracey Plant) had previously performed under the name Blammo! between 1988 and 1994. In this guise they issued five singles; three on Heywood based label Imaginary Records who also had Cud and The Mock Turtles on their roster. The band was invited to support The Beautiful South on three tours, which allowed them to perform in front of several thousand people at London Wembley Arena.  Speedy  Their first performance under the Speedy moniker was at the Spud Club on Sunday 3 April 1994.Martin Lilleker, Sheffield Telegraph 1 April 1994 The following year, their track Sporting Life (produced by Danny Shackleton) was included on a limited edition 7\\" single. The Saturday Night Special: Silence is Golden EP was released by Leadmill Records, which was an imprint of the famous Sheffield venue of the same name. The notes on the back cover commented that The Leadmill had been voted the number one live venue/club in the UK in the 1994 Melody Maker music poll. Signed to Arista Records imprint Boilerhouse!, the band's first 'mainstream' success came in late 1996 with the release of single Boy Wonder, which reached No. 2 on the Indie Chart. Receiving nationwide airplay on Radio 1, it also entered the official UK Singles Chart at No. 56 on 9 November 1996, but fell out of the Top 75 after just one week. Boy Wonder also made it onto Polygram's Shine 7 various artists compilation album (Track 16), the Indie equivalent of the Now That's What I Call Music! series. Television exposure followed, including an appearance on the BBC Saturday lunchtime sports programme Football Focus. But, despite this early success, and support from Radio 1 DJ Zo√´ Ball , who secured the band two appearances on the Saturday morning TV show Live and Kicking, which she presented with Jamie Theakston, subsequent singles Anytime Anyplace Nowhere, Time for You and Going Home failed to chart. Whilst an album was recorded, Speedy and Arista parted company before its release. The band continued to perform live, playing Music in the Sun in 1997, alongside Longpigs and Babybird, but the band members eventually went their separate ways in 1998. Some 15 years later enterprising former fan and renowned crime writer Nick Quantrill, managed to get hold of the audio files to Speedy's long lost album News From Nowhere. He passed them on to a new blogging site Britpop Revival and started a chain of events that would culminate in the band's first live shows in over 17 years. On 30 November 2012 The Britpop Revival Radio Show on Phonic FM revealed that the unreleased album would be made available for streaming from Saturday 15 December 2012. Then, on 20 January 2013, singer Philip Watson was interviewed on the show and asked what he thought about the album resurfacing after 15 years on the shelf, he said: \\"I'm flattered that people have somehow found, like and now want to share this album. Also slightly embarrassed. But only slightly. It's alright.\\" The music on the album falls somewhere between Pulp and Blur. Big tunes with chirpy choruses coupled with wry observational lyrics addressing love, life on the dole and summer holiday sex; together with darker themes such as domestic violence, teenage pregnancy and juvenile crime. In February 2014 the people behind indie label Alcopop! Records and the 1p Album Club blog announced the launch of a new venture called The Lost Music Club. The label would dig out albums that were recorded but never released, and make them available to the public. The press release announced that first release was to be \\"from cult 1990s Sheffield band Speedy who, despite scoring a Radio 1 Single of the Week and gigging relentlessly in the mid-90s, saw their debut album, originally scheduled for a 1997 release, permanently shelved.\\" So after a 17-year hiatus the band reformed for two shows in April 2014 to mark the eventual release of their album \\"News from Nowhere\\". The shows took place on Friday 4 April 2014 at London Birthdays in Dalston, and on Saturday 5 April 2015 at the band's spiritual home The Leadmill in Sheffield. And with that the band returned to their day jobs. The album News From Nowhere was finally released on Monday 7 April 2015. On the same day, Sarah Lay reviewing the album for Louder Than War, the music website established by award-winning journalist, TV and radio presenter John Robb concluded: A lost classic? Maybe not. But a gem from the analogue age that certainly didn‚Äôt deserve to be unheard for so long ‚Äì well worth a listen for lovers of underdogs or the Britpop sound, for ‚Äô90s throwbacks or anyone who just wants to get their ears around some raucous indiepop. = Life After Speedy = Singer Philip Watson is an architect and Visiting Professor at the University of Leeds. Drummer Bronwen Stone is currently a freelance materials archaeologist. For many years she ran Antics Antiques on Eccleshall Road in Sheffield, with partner and print artist John Pedder, the former bassist with Babybird.

Biography Henry Morgenthau III was the son of Elinor (n√©e Fatman), granddaughter of Mayer Lehman, a co-founder of Lehman BrothersNew York Times: \\"Joan Morgenthau Hirschhorn\\" October 7, 2012 and Henry Morgenthau Jr., who was Franklin D. Roosevelt's U.S. Secretary of the Treasury. He was a grandson of US Ambassador Henry Morgenthau, Sr. and grandnephew of New York Governor and Senator Herbert H. Lehman. He was the brother of former New York County District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau, as well as of Joan Elizabeth Morgenthau Hirschhorn (October 9, 1922 - October 1, 2012), who was professor of clinical pediatrics and preventive medicine and the associate dean for student affairs at Mount Sinai School of Medicine. A cousin was the American historian Barbara Tuchman. Early years He graduated from Princeton University in 1939. During his time at university, he ran on the cross country team, worked on Theatre Intime, and was an editorial- board member of the Daily Princetonian. Despite his family's social stature, Morgenthau was frozen out of bicker (excluded from Eating club membership) as a sophomore in 1937, along with four of the other 11 Jewish students in the class. During World War II, Morgenthau served in the US Army. From 1945, he was involved in the television business, at various times working as an author, producer and manager for the larger national institutions like NBC, CBS and ABC, while serving as President of Gannaway-Morgenthau Productions, Inc. From 1955-77, Morgenthau was a chief producer of WGBH (Boston). His shows at WGBH won Peabody, Emmy, United Press International, Educational Film Library Association, and Flaherty Film Festival awards. He also served as acting program manager at WYNC. Morgenthau served as a vice president of the Eleanor Roosevelt Institute. He also was a manager of the Morse Communication Center at Brandeis University. Morgenthau III was producer of Prospects of Mankind with Eleanor Roosevelt (1959), The Negro and the American Promise (1963), and Conversation with Svetlana Alliluyeva (daughter of Stalin) (1967). He was a contributor to Screamers (2006 film) and story editor of A Tale of Two Christmases (December 21, 1952). Authorship He wrote Mostly Morgenthaus: A Family History (1991), focused on several patriarchs: The first Morgenthau of record, Moses (1773‚Äì1834), impoverished teacher of Hebrew from Gleusdorf in Bavaria, who later became a ritual slaughterer married to a rabbi‚Äôs daughter, was required to take a family name when the Jews of Bavaria were granted citizenship in 1813. Waiting in line at city hall in the predawn, he looked at the damp ground and decided to call himself Morgen Tau (\\"morning dew in German). His and Brunhilda Morgenthau's son, Lazarus (1815‚Äì1897) was making nicotine-free cigars, candy from pine needles, tongue scrapers, and gum-label machines. Married in 1843 to Seline Babette Guggenheim, he moved to Mannheim and opened a cigar manufactory, a business that grew rapidly when his brother Max (also called Mengo) wrote from California in 1849 suggesting he ship his cigars to the American market. Lazarus's success had been extraordinary, but the luck that had followed him could not prevent the business failure that followed the rise of protective tariffs in the United States when war broke out there in 1861. Financially overextended, Lazarus moved to New York in 1866, where his fortunes plummeted further. Lazarus's ninth child, Henry Sr. (1856‚Äì1946), saw his mission as restoring the family to its rightful position. As Wilson's ambassador to the Ottoman Empire (Turkey) during the crucial years before and during World War I, he supported the Jews in Palestine and heroically rescued Armenians persecuted by the Turks. Henry Jr. (1891‚Äì1967) was a close friend of both Eleanor and Franklin Roosevelt, FDR's Secretary of the Treasury and leader of U.S. efforts on behalf of Holocaust survivors. In his book Henry Morgenthau III casts doubt on the alleged Communist associations of his father's Treasury aide Harry Dexter White, whom Whitaker Chambers accused of being a Soviet spy and conspirator.

History Custance was a Professor of Agricultural Science at the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester, and had been for a time appointed to the Imperial College, Japan. The South Australian Government was concerned about the declining productivity of soils in the colony, where wheat had been grown for less than fifty years. Early in 1881 Sir Arthur Blyth, South Australia's Agent-General in England was charged with finding a suitable person to fill a newly established position of Professor of Agriculture with the University of Adelaide'Custance, John Daniel (1842‚Äì1923)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/custance-john-daniel-3305/text5033, published first in hardcopy 1969. Retrieved 9 July 2015 He selected Custance, who in June 1881 was appointed at a salary of ¬£800 per year. It was envisaged that an institution combining the functions of an Experimental Farm and Agricultural College be established. To this end, Custance, the Commissioner for Crown Lands Alfred Catt, Samuel Davenport and Sir Robert Dalrymple Ross chose a property near Smithfield, which had the merits of being close to the city and a railway station, but their choice was overruled on the grounds the land was too good, and that more useful experiments could be made on land that had been exhausted by wheatgrowing, and the property purchased in 1882 was Olive Hill Farm, of at Kangaroo Flat, west of Roseworthy. He arrived unaccompanied, in late July on the s.s. Malwa which left Britain on 1 June. He started his researches immediately, starting with visits to farms in the various wheatgrowing districts in the colony, but the Agricultural College did not get under way until 1884, and Custance was appointed Honorary Principal, but was hampered in his work by an unwillingness of Parliament to allow him more staff. Though an excellent teacher and researcher and an able administrator, Custance was by all reports an obstinate and irascible man (\\"Professor Crusty\\" was a nickname), and lacked the subtlety which might have won him more battles. Previous ministers with the portfolio Commissioner of Crown Lands and Immigration (Alfred Catt, Jenkin Coles and Thomas Playford) seemed to have coped with his obstinacy, but James Henderson Howe was clearly more interested in maintaining the upper hand than a working relationship. The tipping point came at examination time when Custance requested two examiners and Howe sent three. Nobody would back down and Custance resigned his (honorary) position as Principal on 8 December 1886. Howe thereupon gave Custance three months' notice of the termination of his appointment as Professor. To give vent his displeasure, Howe refused to attend the graduation ceremony, where he was due to present certificates to successful students. Henry Hewitson McMinnies (26 September 1812 ‚Äì 25 November 1887), a Cirencester graduate, was appointed his successor in March 1887. damning with faint praise, and a little sarcasm? He arrived in June, but was too ill to take up his duties on 1 July, resigned and returned to England, where he died from cancer of the tongue and throat. His trips and salary were paid by the South Australian Government, and a generous gratuity beside. By this time Howe was no longer a Cabinet member, and Custance could easily have been reappointed with minimum loss of face, but that was not to be; rather they appointed Professor William Lowrie, with F. H. Molesworth acting while Lowrie came out from England. Around this time Custance returned to England with his family, and was in London early in 1888. Their third son was born at Ongar, Essex; they moved to the Isle of Wight before returning to South Australia. Lowrie served for 13 years, then left in 1903, protesting that he was not receiving as high a salary as Custance, and was followed by Professor Towar. Custance and his family returned to South Australia on the Persic around 27 April 1906, and received considerable recognition for the part he had played in the progress of agriculture in the State. He worked for a time at J. H. Angas's estates \\"Broadview\\" at Georgetown, South Australia, then \\"Collingrove\\", near Angaston. At a later Speech Day, mention was made of the successful careers that many of Custance's students had made in agriculture. In 1923 he wrote a series of articles for The Observer on the history of agriculture in the State. His adventurous son Frederic perished on the Broken Hill track, and he himself died at his home in Black Forest, South Australia at the end of the same year.

Background Since early February 1969, U.S. reconnaissance detected that 3 People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) Regiments, the 27th, 138th and 246th were moving south from the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The 4th Marine Regiment based at Vandegrift Combat Base was given the mission of forcing the 246th Regiment back into the DMZ, occupying key terrain along the southern boundary of the DMZ and then patrolling inside the southern half of the DMZ. Operation The operation began on 1 March 1969 with the 3rd Battalion, 4th Marines sweeping north of Firebase Russell, the 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines moving north of Firebase Neville and the 1st Battalion, 4th Marines clearing the area north of Elliot Combat Base. On 2 March 1969 as the 1/4 Marines moved to reopen Landing Zone Mack they were hit by PAVN mortar fire but seized the summit of Mack by mid-morning, however the Marines were then hit by mortar fire causing numerous casualties and forcing them from the summit. With bad weather limiting air support the Marines dug in and were subjected to small arms and mortar fire. On the afternoon of 5 March following an artillery barrage the Marines assaulted the summit of Mack clearing numerous PAVN bunkers. On 9 March Company G 2/4 Marines moved to reopen Landing Zone Catapult 4 km north of Firebase Neville overlooking the Cam L·ªô valley. The PAVN defended the former Landing Zone and were only slowly dislodged from their positions, due to bad weather air support was unavailable to the Marines who had to rely exclusively on artillery support. By 10 March the Marines penetrated the PAVN defenses and engaged in a daylong battle with the defenders. On 11 March the PAVN counterattacked the Marine positions and 4 Marines were killed of which 3 were killed by friendly fire. When the Marines finally secured the area they found 24 PAVN dead. On 13 March the Marines moved along the ridgeline from Landing Zone Mack to retake Landing Zone Sierra which had been abandoned 2 months earlier and was now used by the PAVN to mortar Marines positions. Company I led the attack on Sierra and found that the PAVN were dug in in well-prepared bunkers, the Landing Zone was secured by the afternoon for the loss of 10 Marines and 23 PAVN killed. On 14 March the PAVN shot down a CH-46D BuNo 154841 of HMM-161 with a B-40 rocket as it conducted a resupply and medevac mission, killing 12 Marines and 1 Navy corpsman and the PAVN then launched a counterattack on the LZ which was beaten back. On 20 March 1969 the Marines moved to reoccupy Firebase Argonne. As the Army UH-1E helicopter (#68-15340) carrying team Frostburg from the 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion approached the hill it was met with heavy fire killing the pilot and wounding the copilot, who crash-landed onto the hill. Shortly after crashing the PAVN assaulted the survivors but were repulsed and the team was extracted. Company D 1/4 Marines was landed nearby and moved to secure Argonne fighting against PAVN entrenched in bunkers resulting in 6 Marines and 15 PAVN killed. The following morning a PAVN mortar attack hit the Marine command post killing the Battalion commander LTC George Sargent and 3 other Marines, further mortar fire hit as the wounded were being evacuated resulting in a further 3 Marines killed. Company C was then ordered to move to Argonne while Company A swept west of the base to silence the PAVN mortars. On 28 March Company A seized Hill 1154 northwest of Argonne destroying the PAVN mortar positions. Operations around Argonne continued into April. On 25 March with the chain of landing zones and firebases in their possession, the 3/5 Marines began reconnaissance into the DMZ. The Marines deployed small 14 man patrols which if engaged could call on rapid reinforcement from \\"Sparrowhawk\\" teams, however the patrols encountered only limited PAVN activity. On 10 April Company E 2/5 Marines assaulted a PAVN bunker and cave complex in the Cam L·ªô valley capturing several prisoners and stocks of weapons and ammunition. By 25 April the Marines began to move south from the DMZ. Aftermath Operation Purple Martin concluded on 8 May, the PAVN 246th Regiment had been pushed back with alleged losses of over 347 killed, while Marine losses were approximately 100 killed.

These differences are most apparent when a player is within a few points of winning the match. Match format Backgammon matches are played to a set number of points, ranging from 3 for informal matches to 25 or more for high level tournaments. Traditionally matches are played to an odd number of points, however there is no theoretical reason why a match should not be played to an even number of points. The doubling cube As with money play, the doubling cube is used. At the start of each game, the doubling cube is placed on the bar with the number 64 showing; the cube is then said to be \\"centered, on 1\\". When the cube is centered, the player about to roll may propose that the game be played for twice the current stakes. Their opponent must either accept (\\"take\\") the doubled stakes or resign (\\"drop\\" or \\"pass\\") the game immediately. If a player accepts a double, the cube is placed on their side of the board with the corresponding power of two facing upward, to indicate that the right to re- double belongs exclusively to the player who last accepted a double; this player is then said to \\"own\\" the cube. A player who drops a double loses the game at the current value of the doubling cube. For example, if the cube is currently at 2 and a player wants to redouble the stakes to put it at 4, the opponent choosing to drop the redouble would concede 2 points to the opponent. There is no limit to the number of redoubles, but in practice a game is rarely doubled beyond 4 points. If a game is played to completion, the score is determined by the value of the doubling cube, multipled by 2 in the case of a gammon, and by 3 in the case of a backgammon. For example, a player losing a gammon with the cube at 2 would concede 4 points to the opponent. The Crawford rule The Crawford rule, named after John R. Crawford, is designed to make match play more equitable for the player in the lead. If a player is one point away from winning a match, that player's opponent will always want to double as early as possible in order to catch up. Whether the game is worth one point or two, the trailing player must win to continue the match. To balance the situation, the Crawford rule requires that when a player first reaches a score one point short of winning, neither player may use the doubling cube for the following game, called the \\"Crawford game\\". After the Crawford game, normal use of the doubling cube resumes. The Crawford rule is routinely used in tournament match play. It is possible for a Crawford game never to occur in a match. Doubling strategy General When both players are several points away from the target score, doubling strategy is broadly similar to that of money play. The theoretical point for accepting a double is when a player's winning chances are 25% or higher. Suppose a player were offered the same double in the same position 4 times. If the player dropped 4 doubles, they would have a net loss of 4 points. If they accepted the double at 2, lost 3 games and won 1, the net loss would still be 4 points, i.e. 2 * (3 - 1) In fact, a player can accept a double at slightly worse odds than 25%, due to the value of owning the cube, giving them the exclusive right to redouble. The corollary of this is that a player should be wary of \\"giving the cube away\\" too readily; generally an advantage corresponding to 70% winning chances or more is needed before a double becomes correct. The \\"doubling window\\" between which both the double and the take are correct is approximately 70% - 78%.Paul Money - Beginners please, lesson 3, introduction to the cube Players generally attempt to double at the \\"top of the market\\", i.e. as close as possible to the opponent's theoretical take point. If a player offers a double and the opponent correctly drops, the player is said to have \\"lost his market\\" or \\"doubled someone out\\". If both the double and the take are correct, the player has \\"kept his market\\" or \\"doubled someone in\\". While it is preferable to double someone in, due to the volatile nature of the game this is not always possible. For example if a player throws a \\"joker\\" which radically changes the assessment of the position (for example a 6-6 in a racing situation), a position which was not a correct double on the previous roll may now be a \\"drop\\". A complicating factor is the possibility of gammons (or more rarely backgammons). When a player has a reasonable chance of winning a gammon, a position may be \\"too good\\" to double, i.e. it may be correct to attempt to score 2 points by winning an undoubled gammon rather than \\"cash\\" a certain 1 point by doubling the opponent out. Additionally, the threat of a gammon can sometimes make it correct to double even with less than 65% winning chances, or to drop a double with more than 25% winning chances. Complicating things still further, the specific match score can have a significant effect on correct doubling and checker play strategy. Match specific doubling strategies To facilitate discussion of match play strategy, scores are \\"normalised\\", i.e. referred to in terms of the number of points each player is away from victory. For example, if a player is leading 3-2 in a 5 point match, this is referred to as \\"2-away, 3-away\\" or \\"-2, -3\\"; likewise if a player leads 13-12 in a 15 point match. =Double match point= \\"Double match point\\" (or DMP) refers to any situation where the match depends on the result of a single game, gammons, backgammons and cube actions being irrelevant. Common situations where double match point strategy comes into effect include a score of 1-away, 1-away, a post-Crawford game at 1-away, 2-away in which the leader accepts the inevitable early double, and a doubled game at 2-away, 2-away. In double match point games, a \\"blitz\\", in which a player aggressively pursues a gammon by continually hitting in his own board at the risk of overextending his position, becomes a poor strategy. On the other hand, since gammons don't matter, back games, in which a player maintains two or more anchors in the opponent's home board with a view to hitting later in the game, become a more attractive option. However, double match point games are most commonly decided by a simple racing strategy when one player has an opportunity to break contact with the opponent while ahead in the race. =2-away, 2-away= Between competent players, this will almost always be the final game of the match; one of the players will double early, the other will take, and play will take on a double match point character. The explanation for this is as follows: If one of the players were to win a single game, making the score 1-away, 2-away Crawford, the trailing player's odds of winning the match would now be 30% (explanation below). Therefore, the take threshold for both players is 30% or greater chance of winning the game, regardless of gammons. Additionally, it is important to double while the opponent can still take; should a player's advantage on the board exceed 70% winning chances he will have \\"lost his market\\", allowing his opponent to drop the double and continue the match at 30% winning odds. It is an error not to double if there is any possibility of losing one's market; however it is not an error to double even if no market losing possibility exists. For practical purposes then, the simplest strategy is to double on the first move and get it over with. =1-away, 2-away (Crawford game)= Since the cube will not come into play, there are two possible ways for the trailing player to win the match; he can win a gammon in the next game, or he can win the next game and then win the decider at DMP. The combined odds for the trailing player to win the match can be calculated at approximately 30%, assuming that 20% of the wins are gammons: 0.10 (odds of winning gammon in the next game) + 0.40 (odds of winning a single game) * 0.50 (odds of winning the following game) = 0.30. Because gammons are important to the trailer but not to the leader, the trailer should play more aggressively in pursuit of a gammon. The trailer will try to steer the game into a blitz, a back game (for either side) or a prime vs prime battle. The leader, on the other hand, will attempt to establish an advanced anchor in the opponent's board or else try for a simple running game. =1-away, 2-away (Post-Crawford game) - the \\"free drop\\"= The trailer should double at the first opportunity, thereby converting the game into a double match point situation. However, the leader has the option of the \\"free drop\\". If the leader is at a disadvantage, however slight, he should drop the double and start a new game at 1-away, 1-away. Whether the leader takes or drops, the next game will be the decider at DMP, so it is preferable to start a new game at 50 - 50 than continue the present game at 49.5 - 50.5. The free drop is only a minor advantage to the leader, so to all intents and purposes a score of 1-away, 2-away post-Crawford is equivalent to 1-away, 1-away. The free drop also comes into consideration in any post-Crawford game in which the trailer is an even number of points away from victory. For example 1-away, 6-away post-Crawford is equivalent to 1-away, 5-away save for the leader's free drop. In this case the leader may elect to \\"save\\" his free drop if he is at only a minimal disadvantage (e.g. having a sound position but losing the opening roll).

Overview  The original meaning of the term Volunteer Corps is take the initiative to organize for the country. The term was used for the war support groups in many areas. A labor shortage continued throughout the war, and the Volunteer Corps organization was started, followed by the Women's Volunteer Corps organization consisting of female laborers.

Registered users upload images of wildlife observations, identify species, and discuss their findings with other members. This is intended to provide opportunities to learn more about the wildlife they have observed, and also provides a database of observations which is made available for scientific analysis. The site also provides some online identification tools.Staff, Open Air Laboratories network, http://www.opalexplorenature.org/ispot Access date 7 July 2015 Purpose The natural history observational skills required for accurate species identification in the field are neglected in formal education at all levels. iSpot is intended to help solve this problem by combining learning technology with crowdsourcing to connect beginners with experts. Communities The communities as of 2015 include the original UK and Ireland, Southern Africa, Hong Kong, Chile (Spanish language) and Global, which covers everywhere else. These communities can link to their own taxonomic lists, or use the default Catalogue of Life list. In mid 2014 the global iSpot community exceeded 42000 registered participants. Function In a 2015 study it was found that over 94% of observations submitted to iSpot are identified to some level, (>80% at species level), and that 92% of a representative sample of the identifications could be externally verified. Most observations were given an initial identification within an hour of posting. Identification is refined as other members review and agree with an existing identification, or propose an alternative. There is no time limit to this process. Database The number of observations uploaded with photographic records exceeds 500 000 as of May 2015.Martin Harvey, Half a million observations on iSpot, 13 May 2015, http://www.ispotnature.org/node/669956 Observations are classified taxonomically according to the standard chosen by the community. The taxonomic classification follows the standard principles for zoological and botanical classification, with some modifications to make it easier for the lay-person. One such modification is the allocation of taxa to groups. The groups used on iSpot are: *Amphibians and Reptiles *Birds *Fish *Fungi and Lichens *Invertebrates *Mammals *Other organisms *Plants Observations are geographically located in decimal degrees to any precision input by the contributor, and where applicable, the position is derived from the EXIF of the lead photograph. The location details can also be input and edited manually. The location can be displayed on Google Maps. In some cases where the exact location must be hidden for conservation security, the map will display a rectangle surrounding the actual location. The location is then truncated to two decimal places, and this represents a corner of the rectangle. On-site reputation iSpot uses a unique reputation system to motivate and reward participants and as a tool to grade identifications of observations. Reputation points specific to one of the eight taxonomic groups used in the project are earned when an identification gets agreement from other participants, The value of the added points is proportional to the reputation for that group of the persons adding agreements. Exact values of reputation for the groups is not available to the users, but is displayed in the form of icons. Up to five icons may be displayed for any group, the first is awarded for a very small value, and the fifth for a rather large, but not publicly available value. Users with expert knowledge of taxonomy may be allocated an expert level reputation for the whole group in which their expertise is academically verifiable. For example, an expert on spiders would be considered an expert in all invertebrates. A similar but lesser reputation as \\"knowledgeable\\" can be allocated to users with informally acquired identification skills. The integration, if any, of earned reputation with allocated reputation is not publicly available. This system is claimed to discriminate effectively between alternative identifications proposed for the same observation. The reputation system is shown to have improved the accuracy of the determination in 57% of cases studied. In the rest it either improved precision or revealed false precision. The other form of reputation is proportional to the amount of contribution to the database in the form of observations and comments. These are accumulated as social points, and have no obvious value other than keeping score. Projects iSpot supports projects initiated by registered users and larger organisations, including at one time the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) =SANBI= The South African National Biodiversity Institute once chose iSpot as a platform for several citizen science national biodiversity projects.Staff, SANBI Information resources, http://www.sanbi.org/information Accessed 8 July 2015 Originally iSpotZA was hosted independently of the main site, with a customised user interface, but at the end of 2014 it was integrated into the main site.Martin Harvey, 10 December 2014, Welcoming the new iSpot Southern Africa community, http://www.ispotnature.org/node/626685 Some functionality changed during the integration, but it has mostly been restored.

They have been described as \\"one of the most exciting DIY bands\\" in the UK. History Initially conceived of as a solo project, The Ethical Debating Society was formed as a band in 2009 by Tegan Christmas with Lauren Darling and Chris Morris. They received an early name-check in The Guardian from Everett True. Recordings were made with producer Ant Chapman, although only two tracks were included on a later EP. By 2010 Darling and Morris had left and Tegan continued with a varying line up until the group settled as Tegan with Eli Tupa and Kris Martin in 2013. The band played a number of early gigs around the UK queercore scene, with Ste McCabe, The Younger Lovers and others; following an appearance on Brighton queercore label Tuff Enuff Records‚Äôs 2012 compilation Why Diet When You Could Riot? gigs with Shrag and (Athens, Georgia‚Äôs) Tunabunny led to a split single with London‚Äôs Skinny Girl Diet on US label Happy Happy Birthday To Me Records in 2013. A cassette/download EP on Tuff Enuff - \\"Hens Teeth\\" - followed in 2014. In 2015, The Ethical Debating Society's debut album New Sense was released on Odd Box Records following audio and video previews, and received positive reviews from SoundsXP, Collapse Board, Louder Than War and others, with radio support including BBC Radio 6, Dandelion and Artrocker Radio. The album was produced by Mark Jasper at Sound Savers studio in Homerton. The band have been likened to other dual male/female vocal DIY indie/punk bands such as Huggy Bear, Red Monkey, Comet Gain, Bis and Prolapse, as well as post-hardcore and indie rock groups such as Future of the Left, Sleater-Kinney, Nation of Ulysses, Pixies and Nirvana, and various punk and anarcho-punk bands. The band were chosen by Jessicka to support Jack Off Jill at their final show, at Heaven in London, and played with Shonen Knife on the London date of that band's 2016 tour. They played at Indietracks 2015, and have also played with The Wolfhounds, The Nightingales, The Homosexuals, Hagar the Womb, Dream Nails, Prolapse, and Bis. The Ethical Debating Society's album track \\"Razor Party\\" (written by former drummer Rob) was voted #32 in the 2015 John Peel memorial 'Festive 50' compiled by Dandelion Radio. In 2017, T.E.D.S. were included in Clash magazine's list of \\"favourite new groups\\" alongside Shopping and others. The band released a number of new tracks, including a contribution to Loud Women Records' Loud Women - Volume One album and a track on Kobayashi Nights Records' Kobayashi I: Intergalactic Champions compilation.

Since the appearance of La Mancha Negra, it has caused multiple car accidents and claimed many lives. After nearly two decades of study and millions of dollars spent to identify the substance and its source, finding the cause has proven difficult and there are still no definitive explanations.  History  In 1986, La Mancha Negra first appeared as a smudge 50 yards long. It was noticed by workers as they patched the 30-year-old asphalt on a highway between Caracas and its airport. Initially, concerns for the blob were low but it soon spread. As much as 8 miles of highway were soon covered with the unknown material that contracted and expanded with the weather. It was found to grow when conditions were hot and wet but shrink when it was cold and dry. It seemed to prefer tunnels and the uphill slopes outside the airport. Gummy in texture, the blob rendered the roadway extraordinarily unsafe, causing vehicles to crash into one another or run off the road. In 1991, a group of experts consulted President Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez about the problem but could not pinpoint the cause of the substance. 1,800 deaths were then attributed to La Mancha Negra in the five years before 1992 and by that time, the stain had spread throughout the city of Caracas. The Venezuelan government stepped in, stating that it devoted \\"millions of dollars\\" to investigating the problem, even consulting experts in the U.S., Canada and Europe. In 1994, the Ministry of Transport and Communications attempted to wash away La Mancha Negra believing it was paste consisting of oil and dust and even suspended work when it rained believing it would wash away the substance. They tried spraying the stain away with pressurized water, but this did not work. They tried scrubbing it away with detergents to no avail. They even repeatedly scraped away the top layer of the roads, resurfacing it, only to watch La Mancha Negra reappear. Finally, the government poured tons of pulverized limestone over the stain to 'dry it up'. This seemed to work for a while, but created a different problem; the roads then became so dusty that drivers and local residents complained that the air was unbreathable. In January 1996, the lack of maintenance, low rainfall and the poor quality of vehicles in Caracas made the roads slick with the substance once more. La Mancha Negra was thought to have been dealt with in 1996 after special cleaning equipment was brought from Germany. However, La Mancha Negra reappeared in 2001 on Baralt, Nueva Granada, Fuerzas Armadas, Sucre and Urdaneta Avenues in Caracas.  Analysis   Composition  La Mancha Negra has been described as an inch-thick, greasy, black, thick blob that has the consistency of chewed bubble gum, though Venezuelans describe the roads it covers as \\"slick as ice\\". A team of the Venezuelan Ministry of Transport and Communications believed La Mancha Negra was composed of dust, oil, and various organic and synthetic materials. In 2001, The Sunday Telegraph stated that one report showed it \\"was a mixture of used engine oil and highly corrosive brake fluid\\", but concluded that \\"After 14 years of study, no one knows what the stuff is, where it comes from, or how to get rid of it\\".  Causes  Various theories have been put forward to explain the phenomenon, but no one has established its exact nature. Originally, some believed that raw sewage from nearby slums was running downhill, under the asphalt, and causing a chemical reaction that broke the roads down. Venezuelan engineer and official Fernando Martinez M√≥ttola stated in 1991 that he would not only remove the La Mancha Negra but also the residents near the Caracas-La Guaira highway since \\"they were part of the problem by creating leaks in the road\\". Another theory was that La Mancha Negra is oil that's seeping from sub- standard asphalt, with Venezuelans believing someone laid flawed asphalt that would leak oil when temperatures rose. However, the Ministry of Transport and Communications stated that the composition of the asphalt did not have anything to do with the formation of the substance. The most accepted theory is that La Mancha Negra is the result of countless leaky, old cars spraying their fluids over the roadway. Professor Giannetto, a commissioner of the Ministry of Transport and Communications, believed that La Mancha Negra was an accumulation of dust on the roads and oil released from cars that formed a paste on the roads. In 1996, The Wall Street Journal reported that due to the cheap gasoline prices in the country, Venezuelans would drive dated gas guzzlers, stating \\"Locals call the highway 'la mancha negra,' or the black stain, because it literally shines with the oil drippings of thousands of big cars that labor up an incline into the city each day. Water-tank trucks periodically spray down the road in vain attempts to wash away some of the oil slick that causes hundreds of accidents a year\\". =Politicization= Under the Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez presidency in 1992 during a time of political turmoil, allegations were made that his political opponents were spreading oil on the roads to tarnish his reputation as a leader. In 2001 following Hugo Ch√°vez's Bolivarian Revolution, the substance was used as a political tool once more, with chavista mayor Freddy Bernal stating that the opposition had hired homeless Venezuelans to spread it from plastic bags during the night.

State football Maynard played junior football with the Hampton Rovers in the Victorian Amateur Football Association (VAFA). Maynard represented Sandringham Dragons in the TAC Cup. He played 13 games for them in the 2013 TAC Cup season and 17 games in the 2014 TAC Cup season. During the 2014 season, he averaged 22 disposals and 6 tackles per game, winning the club's season best and fairest award. Sandringham Dragons' talent manager, Ryan O'Connor, compared Maynard to Luke Hodge, saying \\"he's a really exciting player because he‚Äôs quite explosive and powerful and has got a beautiful left foot kick and a real feel for the game.\\" Maynard represented Vic Metro at the 2014 AFL Under 18 Championships, averaging 15 disposals and 5 tackles per game. He was named among the best players in both matches against Vic County, and scored a goal in the second game against Vic County as well as in both games against Western Australia. AFL career Maynard was drafted by Collingwood with their third selection and 30th pick overall in the 2014 AFL draft. After being drafted to the club, he was glad that he knew his fellow draftees, having played with Jordan De Goey, Darcy Moore, and Matthew Goodyear at the AFL Under 18 Championships. He made his debut against Hawthorn in round 14 of the 2015 season. After the 2017 season, Maynard signed a contract extension until the end of the 2020 season. Maynard played in Collingwood's losing team in the 2018 Grand Final against West Coast. He was involved in the controversial goal at the end, with some fans and analysts claiming he should've been awarded a free kick after being blocked by Willie Rioli, which allowed Dom Sheed to mark and kick the winning goal. In April 2019, despite having more than a year left on his contract, Collingwood signed Maynard on another two year contract extension, keeping him at the club until the end of the 2022 season. In the 2019 season, Maynard came in fifth in the Copeland Trophy count, giving a humorous speech, which included a light dig at Justin Longmuir, Collingwood's assistant coach who left to take up the head coaching role at Fremantle. In the third round of the 2020 season, Maynard played his 100th game for Collingwood. Coaching In 2019, Maynard took on an assistant coaching role, under Peter Schwab, at De La Salle College where he studied. Personal life Maynard was born in Adelaide, but grew up in Melbourne barracking for Melbourne. He is the son of Peter Maynard, who played for Melbourne in the AFL and for Glenelg in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL) and the grandson of Graham Campbell, who played and coached Fitzroy, as well as coaching West Perth and Glenelg. His brother, Corey, played football for Melbourne in the AFL as a category B rookie after a career playing basketball professionally. He attended De La Salle College in Malvern, an inner suburb of Melbourne.

The work was commissioned by the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and violinist Anne Akiko Meyers. It was premiered December 7, 2012, with Meyers and the Pittsburgh Symphony performing under conductor Leonard Slatkin. Structure The Violin Concerto has a duration of roughly 25 minutes and is composed in three continuous movements:Bates, Mason (2012). Violin Concerto: Program Note. Retrieved July 7, 2015. #Archaeopteryx #Lakebed Memories #The Rise of the Birds Composition Background The Pittsburgh Symphony commissioned Bates's Violin Concerto at the behest of a recommendation from composer John Adams and principal guest conductor Leonard Slatkin. Slatkin had previously led the orchestra in a performance of Bates's Liquid Interface and lauded Bates to the symphony's vice president Bob Moir as a \\"terrific young composer.\\" Violinist Anne Akiko Meyers had also sought a commission from Bates, remarking before the work's premiere: Bates later spoke of the experience, saying, \\"I've written a lot for strings in the orchestra, but writing for solo violin is completely different. It was like writing a one-person play in a language you don't speak. It was very intimidating at first.\\" The piece was completed in the summer of 2012, with Meyers remarking, \\"we were changing things right and left‚Äîit was definitely an evolution.\\" Style Bates described the style of the piece in the score program notes, writing: Instrumentation The piece is scored for solo violin and orchestra comprising two flutes (2nd doubling piccolo), two oboes (2nd doubling English horn), two clarinets in B-flat (2nd doubling bass clarinet), two bassoons (2nd doubling contrabassoon), four French horns, four trumpets in C, two trombones, bass trombone, tuba, three percussionists, timpani, piano, harp, and strings. Reception Reviewing the world premiere, Mark Kanny of the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review praised the Violin Concerto, saying, \\"The outer movements are high-energy excursions, driven by the composer's gifts for inventive rhythms, lyrical inspiration and a combination of moment-to-moment persuasiveness and feeling of formal satisfaction.\\" Andrew Druckenbrod of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette lauded the work for having \\"more than a few exhilarating moments,\\" but criticized Bates for limiting his ambition, remarking, \\"I am not begrudging Mr. Bates from going where his muse takes him. But I am concerned that the pull of tradition may be tugging on him, making him feel he needs to prove himself as a 'real' composer.\\" Druckenbrod nevertheless said, \\"Despite the ambitious program of the work [...] there were some compelling musical moments.\\" John von Rhein of the Chicago Tribune also praised the work, writing, \\"If Bates' big tune smacks of the Hollywood cornfields, he won me over when the fiddle engaged in dreamy dialogues with the percussion in the middle movement, and again when the violin soared in glimmering arcs high above the full orchestra in the finale.\\" John Pitcher of ArtsNash said: Pitcher added, \\"Unfortunately, these melodies often come across as little more than beautiful moments in an otherwise tedious half-hour. Melodies in the concerto frequently meander without a sense of purpose or destination. The work‚Äôs musical argument is likewise loose, sometimes amounting to nothing more than slow sections following fast sections.\\" However, Pitcher ultimately praised the solo writing and referred to the piece asan \\"important\\" work.

In the film, the T-3000 is an alternate timeline counterpart of Skynet's (portrayed by Matt Smith) nemesis John Connor (also portrayed by Clarke), created after Skynet infects a variant of Connor with nanotechnology and fractures the timeline. T-3000 also serves as a foil personality to \\"Guardian\\" (a reprogrammed T-800 portrayed by Arnold Schwarzenegger), a protagonist who is somewhat similar to T-3000 but also opposite in many ways, of their relationship dynamics with Sarah Connor (portrayed by Emilia Clarke) and Kyle Reese (portrayed by Jai Courtney). The T-3000's sole mission is to protect and ensure the ultimate survival of Skynet, which seeks to eliminate the human race with its global machine network. The T-3000 describes itself as neither machine nor human; rather, it is a hybrid nanotechnological cyborg. Producer David Ellison explains that the title Terminator Genisys \\"[is] in reference to genesis, which is in reference to the singularity and the man- machine hybrid that John Connor ends up being.\\" Background In a desperate effort to ensure its survival, the rogue artificial intelligence Skynet creates an avatar for itself in the form of a T-5000 (Matt Smith). This Terminator travels through many timelines searching for a way to defeat the Human Resistance and ultimately infiltrates it under the guise of a fighter named Alex. \\"Alex\\" is present as a soldier when John Connor and Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) discover Skynet's time machine at the end of the war with the machines. As Kyle is being sent back in time to protect John's mother Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke) from the T-800 Terminator sent to kill her in 1984, \\"Alex\\" carries out his attack. He kills all of the other soldiers nearby and infects John Connor with nanomachines, transforming him into a new hybrid Terminator designated as the T-3000. John Connor's conversion into a Terminator as Kyle travels back in time turns out to be such a major event that it leads to a fracturing of the timeline, completely rewriting the past and the future. The T-3000 is sent back in time to 2014, and given the mission to assist Cyberdyne Systems in developing a new operating system named Genisys, in addition to revolutionary robotic and time traveling technology, which is in reality Skynet and the recreation of its machines. When Sarah and Kyle arrive in 2017, he meets them at a hospital and convinces them that he really is John Connor, but his disguise is exposed by the Guardian (a reprogrammed T-800 portrayed by Schwarzenegger). The T-3000 engages the trio in multiple destructive battles. During a final battle with the Guardian, the T-3000 is disintegrated by a prototype time machine's magnetic field. The Guardian explains during the film that before the final battle between Skynet and the Resistance, the former attempted to create a new type of infiltrators by infecting prisoners with machine-phase matter, but the subjects went insane and died; John Connor was the only subject to survive the transformation reasonably mentally intact, albeit now loyal to Skynet as opposed to his previous loyalty to humanity. Design The on-screen representation of the T-3000 was made by British effects company Double Negative. Footage would combine Jason Clarke filmed on set, keyframed animation, and motion capture. Supervisor Peter Bebb said that the company tried to design the T-3000 like a computer would do it, focusing on design and battle efficiency, \\"form follows function\\". Given that it is a Terminator built out of a human, the result is \\"a pure robot that sits under flesh structure\\", still retaining an overall human shape. The mechanical cells tried to resemble the material on stealth aircraft, with a result described as \\"more matte than metal\\", resembling a slightly iridescent ceramic carbon. Abilities The Guardian identifies the T-3000 as being made of machine-phase matter (essentially, programmable matter) held together by a magnetic field. Because of this, the T-3000's abilities far exceed those of the T-1000 and other Terminator models. It is capable of shapeshifting at much more rapid speed than the mimetic polyalloy Terminators, though it is still limited by complexity or mass; its transformation abilities are such that it can dissolve into its most basic form while falling head-first through the air, reorient itself to land on its feet and be fully transformed back to normal by the time it stands up. Likewise, it is capable of regenerating from almost any injury in mere moments. Unlike previous Terminators, the T-3000 transforms and regenerates in layers, beginning with its bone structure, then muscle tissue, skin and clothing. These layers can be adjusted independently of each other, as shown when John Connor adds and removes his facial scar at will in the film. It appears to retain the ability to infect others and create more T-3000s, as it offers this to Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese. The transformation, which is described as replacing its victim's body on the cellular level, cannot be reversed. Though a formidable enemy, the T-3000 is not invulnerable. Because its abilities are primarily tied to its magnetic field, it is susceptible to magnetic attacks that disrupt said field. Weaker magnetism from devices such as the Guardian's improvised fist-load weapons are capable of disrupting or disabling the T-3000's shapeshifting and regeneration abilities, due to affecting its ability to manipulate its particles. A sufficiently strong magnetic field can pull the T-3000 apart briefly to restrain it, and, if its body is exposed to a powerful magnetic field for a sustained amount of time, the cyborg can be torn apart and destroyed. The machine-phase matter is also vulnerable to the laser used in shaping mimetic polyalloy for use in the construction of T-1000s. If struck by this laser, the T-3000 can suffer enough external damage to render its outermost layer irreparably compromised, forcing it to discard its human appearance and use its true machine form. The T-3000 is still susceptible to some degrees of physical injuries and pains such as being wounded by gunshot, and its agonies can worsen if using magnetic weaponry such as police-standard liquefied magnetic artillery shells or explosive magnetic rifle entry munitions. It is also shown to experience pain and have its movements impaired when trapped in an electrical current. However, these effects are only temporary due to its regeneration capabilities, which heal it once it manages to escape the current.

Structurally, it is related to diborane, but with methyl groups replacing terminal hydrides on each boron. It is the dimer of methylborane, CH3BH2, the simplest alkylborane. 1,2-Dimethyldiborane can exist in a cis- and a trans arrangement. 1,2-Dimethyldiborane is an easily condensed, colorless gas that ignites spontaneously in air. An isomer of 1,2-dimethyldiborane is 1,1-dimethyldiborane, known as unsymmetrical dimethyldiborane, which has two methyl groups on one boron atom. Other methylated versions of diborane including methyldiborane, trimethyldiborane, tetramethyldiborane. Trimethylborane exists as a monomer. Preparation Methylboranes were first prepared by H. I. Schlesinger and A. O. Walker in the 1930s. In a more modern synthesis, 1,2-dmethyldiborane is produced by treating lithium methylborohydride with hydrogen chloride: :2 LiCH3BH3 + 2 HCl ‚Üí (CH3BH2)2 + 2 H2 + 2 LiCl Instead of hydrogen chloride, methyl iodide or trimethylsilyl chloride can be used. Lithium methylborohydride can be made by treating methylboronic esters with lithium aluminium hydride. Miscellaneous routes Methylboranes arise the reaction of diborane and trimethylborane. This reaction produces 1-methyldiborane, 1,1-dimethyldborane, 1,1,2-trimethyldiborane, and 1,1,2,2-tetramethyldiborane. By treating monomethyldiborane with ether, dimethyl ether borane (CH3)2O.BH3 leaving methylborane which rapidly dimerises to 1,2-dimethyldiborane. The reaction is complex. Tetramethyl lead reacts with diborane to give a range of methyl- substituted diboranes, ending up at trimethylborane, but including 1,1-dimethyldiborane, and trimethyldiborane. Other products are hydrogen gas and lead metal. Other methods to form methyldiboranes include treating hydrogen with trimethylborane between 80 and 200 ¬∞C under pressure, or treating a metal borohydride with trimethylborane in the presence of hydrogen chloride, aluminium chloride or boron trichloride. If the borohydride is sodium borohydride, then methane is a side product. If the metal is lithium, then no methane is produced. dimethylchloroborane and methyldichloroborane are also produced as gaseous products. When Cp2Zr(CH3)2 reacts with diborane, a borohydro group inserts into the zirconium-carbon bond, and methyl diboranes are produced. In ether dimethylcalcium reacts with diborane to produce dimethyldiborane and calcium borohydride: :Ca(CH3)2 + 2 B2H6 ‚Üí Ca(BH4)2 + B2H4(CH3)2 1,2-Simethyldiborane is produced by the room temperature disproportionation of trimethyldiborane. Physical and spectroscopic properties cis-1,2-Dimethyldiborane melts at ‚àí132.5 ¬∞C; trans-1,2-dimethyldiborane melts at ‚àí102 ¬∞C. The cis-1,2-dimethyldiborane molecule has point group Cs. A trans-1,2-dimethyldiborane molecule has point group C2. Unsymmetrical dimethyldiborane melts at ‚àí150.2 ¬∞C. Vapour pressure is approximated by Log P = 7.363‚àí(1212/T). The vapour pressure for the symmetrical isomer is given by Log P = 7.523‚àí(1290/T). Gas chromatography can be used to determine the amounts of the methyl boranes in a mixture. The order of elution are: diborane, monomethyldiborane, trimethylborane, 1,1-dimethyldiborane, 1,2-dimethyldiborane, trimethyldiborane, and last tetramethyldiborane. The nuclear resonance shift for the bridge hydrogen is 9.55 ppm for the unsymmetrical isomer and 9.73 ppm for the symmetrical isomers, compared to 10.49 for diborane. Reactions Methylborane shows little tendency to disproportionate (redistribute) at room temperature. It reacts stepwise with alkenes to produce mono and dialkylmethylboranes. More methylated boranes are less stable. 1,2-Dimethyldiborane slowly converts to 1,1-dimethyldiborane. Methylborane hydrolyzes to methylboronic acid: :(MeBH2)2 + 4 H2O ‚Üí CH3B(OH)2 + 4 H2 Symmetrical dimethyldiborane reacts with trimethylamine to yield a solid adduct trimethylamine-methylborane (CH3)3N¬∑BH2CH3. When dimethyldiborane is combined with ammonia and heated, B-methyl borazoles are produced. These borazoles can have one, two or three methyl groups substituted on the boron atoms. Under normal conditions dimethyldiborane does not react with hydrogen.

Rachel Saltz of The New York Times wrote: \\"Brian Herzlinger's How Sweet It Is, an ode to the healing powers of musical theater, misfires so badly at the beginning that it takes a while to notice when it goes from godawful to sweetly awful.

Son of former Collingwood captain, Peter Moore, he played for the Oakleigh Chargers in the TAC Cup before he was drafted to Collingwood in 2014 under the father‚Äìson rule. Early life and state football Moore was captain of the football team at his school, Carey Baptist Grammar School. Prior to that, he played junior football at Ivanhoe and Kew Comets, in the Yarra Junior Football League. In 2012, he had an injury-interrupted season, managing to play only six games. Moore captained Oakleigh Chargers in the 2014 TAC Cup season, leading them to claim a premiership. AFL career Moore was drafted by Collingwood with pick number 9 in the 2014 AFL draft under the father‚Äìson rule, with Collingwood matching the first round bid made by the Western Bulldogs. He received the number 30 guernsey to wear, which is the same number his father Peter Moore wore while playing for the club. In May 2015, before making a senior appearance, Moore signed a two-year contract extension on top of the standard two-year contract presented to draftees, keeping him at the club until the end of 2018. Moore made his AFL debut at the Melbourne Cricket Ground against Hawthorn in round 14 of the 2015 season. His first goal came against the Western Bulldogs in Round 17, where he kicked five goals straight in his team's 18-point loss. In Round 19 of the 2016 season against West Coast, Moore kicked three goals in the first half and won a Rising Star nomination after playing only 34 percent of the game. At the end of the season, he was named to AFL Players Association's 22 Under 22 team. In the 2017 season, Moore kicked 25 goals in his first 20 games of the season, leading to him being named in the initial 2017 22 Under 22 40-player squad. Due to hamstring injuries, Moore managed to play only seven games in the 2018 season. At the end of the season, he signed a two-year contract extension, after a long negotiation and amidst speculation he would join another club, such as Sydney. Former Melbourne captain Garry Lyon and former North Melbourne captain Wayne Carey praised Moore, saying he is looming as a generational type player and is the type of player who draws crowds. In February 2020, Moore was selected to play for Victoria in the State of Origin for Bushfire Relief Match, following in his father's footsteps who represented Victoria in 1984. Similar to club level, he wore the number 30 guernsey, like his father. Playing style Moore can play either as a key defender or as a tall forward. He has excellent closing speed, a natural leap, strong marking ability over his head and is smart around goal. As a forward he kicks goals, takes big marks and is a hard match-up, while as a defender he is able to shut-out players. Personal life As the son of former Collingwood captain and dual Brownlow Medalist Peter Moore, Moore grew up supporting Collingwood. He is studying commerce at Melbourne University.

Background In early May 1969, U.S. reconnaissance detected that 2 People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) Regiments, the 27th and 36th were infiltrating through the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) into the central section of Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province. The 3rd Marine Regiment under Colonel Paul D. Lafond was given the mission of engaging both Regiments, preventing any threat to Route 9 and protecting the rice harvest. Operation The operation began on 2 May 1969 with the 1st Battalion, 3rd Marines landed by helicopter at Landing Zone Sparrow (), 8 km northwest of Cam L·ªô Combat Base meeting light resistance. The 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines secured Firebase Fuller and Firebase Pete () north of Elliot Combat Base and then swept towards the DMZ. The 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines secured Con Thien and the surrounding area. By 6 May 1/3 Marines had swept 3 km west of LZ Sparrow along Mutter's Ridge. On the early morning of 10 May an estimated PAVN Platoon attacked Company D, 1/4 Marines' night defensive position killing 8 Marines and wounding 10 in just 10 minutes. On 16 May Company M encountered a small entrenched PAVN force killing 4 and capturing 1. For the remainder of May the 1/3 and 3/3 Marines swept east towards the A-4 Strongpoint () meeting limited resistance. On 20 May an estimated force of 20 PAVN attacked Company C's night defensive position losing 15 killed for the loss of 3 Marine dead and 8 wounded. On 22 May Company B ambushed a 30-man PAVN force killing 19 and capturing 2. On 6‚Äì7 June several B-52 Arclight strikes were made against Mutter's Ridge, Foxtrot Ridge and Helicopter Valley with 2/3 Marines deployed soon after by helicopter to conduct bomb damage assessment. The Marines found numerous destroyed bunkers but few enemy dead. In mid-June the 3rd Marines received intelligence that a PAVN force was infiltrating from the DMZ near Gio Linh District. On 16 June the 3/3 Marines loaded onto trucks and were driven up Route 1 towards the DMZ at night, as they did so they encountered the PAVN 27th Regiment and 33rd Sapper Battalion moving south along the roadside. The Marines engaged the PAVN force, pushing them into the defenses at the Charlie-1 () position, where 56 PAVN dead were found the following morning. 3/3 Marines swept south from Gio Linh towards Con Thien killing 20 PAVN in 2 separate engagements before midday on 17 June. At 14:00 an estimated PAVN Company attacked the 3/3 Marines' command position but were forced back with the loss of 37 dead and 3 captured. Company L moving to support the command group engaged an entrenched PAVN position killing 8. Aerial observers called in artillery and airstrikes against PAVN forces throughout the day with the final tally being 193 PAVN killed and 9 captured for the loss of 19 Marines killed and 28 wounded. Lafond was relieved as commanding officer, 3rd Marine Regiment by Colonel Wilbur F. Simlik on 28 June 1969. Aftermath Operation Virginia Ridge concluded on 16 July and was followed by Operation Idaho Canyon. U.S. losses were 106 killed while the PAVN lost 560 killed and 17 captured and 141 individual and 34 crew-served weapons captured.

Life and career Brooks was born in Pancras, London, the elder son of Shirley Brooks, the satirical writer and editor of Punch, and Emily Walkinshaw Brooks. Brooks' father died in 1874; Reginald Shirley Brooks collated some of his father's satirical writing for Punch about a pompous middle-class couple called The Naggletons into book form and it was published the following year. A further volume of his father's epigrammatic verses was published under the title of Wit and Humour and reviewed in 1884. Brooks became a writer and journalist himself, joining The Sporting Times no later than 1876. He wrote under the pen-name \\"Peter Blobbs\\"; the newspaper, known as the \\"Pink Un\\", covered sports in general but particularly horse-racing, and also dealt in society gossip. In 1880 he was announced as the launch editor for The Sketch, a weekly magazine of society news, though the launch did not then happen. From 1880 to 1884 he wrote for Punch. According to a history of the magazine published in 1895: \\"He wrote some smart papers, but his groove was not that of the sober and respectable Fleet Street Sage. He preferred wilder spirits, and he accordingly retired, taking with him the sympathy of his companions.\\" It was while writing for The Sporting Times in 1882 that Brooks published a spoof obituary of English cricket, following the England side's defeat in a Test match against Australia. His mild satire resulted in subsequent cricket series between Australia and England becoming known as \\"The Ashes\\". According to Mike Selvey, besides the chance to be amusing Brooks had a more serious motive in writing his \\"obituary\\". At the time, cremation was still unlawful. Brooks' father had been a member of the Cremation Society of Great Britain, which was campaigning to have it made legal. When his father died in 1874, Brooks was unable to have him cremated as he would have wished. However, eight years later he was able to give publicity to the cause through what he wrote. A reference work on cremation states: \\"Cremation was the butt of many, usually very unwitty, jokes, and the obituary was at least as much a joke about cremation as about English cricket.\\" Brooks ‚Äì and the Sporting Times as a whole ‚Äì had in any case a reputation as something of a joker. A story retold in a book of 1898 by one of the other journalists of Brooks' time recounts an incident when the newspaper was three columns short at the time of going to press \\"and nobody was sober enough to attempt the task of writing them\\"; Brooks solved the problem by reprinting an entire article from the magazine Truth, merely adding the headline: \\"How on Earth Did this Story get into the Columns of Truth?\\" Following the publication of the memoirs of the theatrical impresario John Hollingshead in 1895, another journalist recounted an incident in which he and Brooks had successfully conned theatre tickets from Hollingshead. Some of Brooks' witticisms misfired. In 1886, the French actor/manager Marius was in charge of the Empire Theatre, which was owned by the Caf√© Royal, and reacted badly when Brooks, in a review of a play at the Empire for a magazine called The Bat, suggested the Caf√© Royal might have done better to employ Marius in his former profession of a waiter, rather than as a theatre manager. Marius claimed never to have been a waiter and sued for libel; Brooks took to the witness stand but the case was lost and Marius received ¬£100 damages. Brooks' lifestyle meant that he was not a \\"morning person\\". According to a servant at the hotel in Covent Garden where he was a long-term resident, when asked what time he had breakfast: \\"Breakfast! He don't trouble no breakfast, but he's gener'ly sick about har' past eleven or a quarter to twelve!\\" In his novel Summer Lightning, first published in 1929, P. G. Wodehouse invented a dissolute past for the character Galahad Threepwood, in the course of which Brooks is mentioned. In his younger days Galahad had been \\"a brother-in-arms of the Shifter, the Pitcher, Peter Blobbs and the rest of an interesting but not strait-laced circle\\". Less than six years after his spoof obituary for English cricket was published, Brooks himself had died in London at the early age of 33. Like his father before him, he was buried at Kensal Green Cemetery. He had been suffering from tuberculosis and rheumatism, which had latterly prevented him from working.

Originally seen as part of the effort to rebuild the economy ‚Äì and a way to give women practical work they could do from home ‚Äì between the 1950s and 1970s its reputation as a retailer and supplier of hand-made knits and traditional crafts grew, with exports to match. It appeared in media such as The Times and Vogue, while designer-makers such as Beatrice Bellini became known names in their own right. Kaffe Fassett was among those who supplied crafts for sale in its shops and he also collaborated on clothing with Bellini. Establishment and early years Women's Home Industries was established in 1947. The key instigator was Stella Isaacs, Marchioness of Reading, who had founded the Women's Voluntary Service (WVS) in 1938 and became the company's chairman. Its stated aims were to stimulate women's craftsmanship and bring in dollars to Britain. It was publicised in its first year of business with an exhibition at Charing Cross tube station; a photograph of the exhibition is part of the London Transport Museum archive. The idea came about because, as Lady Reading explained it to The Times, there was: \\"a wealth of talent in this country, unsurpassed anywhere in the world, and many who had travelled abroad in recent months felt sure that the products which British women could make in their own homes, using traditional British methods and designs, could be turned to dollar- making purposes\\". Initially, the WVS collected samples from its membership ‚Äì including tapestry, embroidery, quilting and hand knitting ‚Äì and the response inspired a start-up business supported by the Board of Trade. The company remained under the auspices of the WVS and operated initially from its HQ at 41 Tothill Street, SW1, but was a limited company. The net of potential suppliers soon widened. The Times reported that only good work would be accepted (a board of experts would select the work) and payment would be at recognised minimum rates. Those whose standard of work passed muster, would then be supplied with a contract, instructions and materials designated of 'export only' quality. (This was during rationing and the utility scheme would be in operation for a further five years.) The scheme set out to generate overseas contracts and mass orders ‚Äì it was suggested that suitable projects might include: \\"the equipping of a whole cathedral with kneelers\\". The initial call for samples requested high-quality knitted garments ‚Äì particularly for children under five years old ‚Äì as well as work in petitpoint and grospoint. In October 1947, The Guardian reported that inquiries were \\"pouring in from every part of the country\\" and the first order from New York had been accepted. Queen Mary's contribution In her capacity as chair, Lady Reading travelled to the US in 1948. She took six tapestry seat covers with her that had been created by Queen Mary. The seat covers were in a floral design and made of grosgrain. Lady Reading's return on the Queen Elizabeth was reported in The Times, which said that the covers had been sold to Mrs Edward S. Harkness for $10,000. Profits from the sale were donated to the Queen's Institute of District Nursing. Two years later, Queen Mary once again donated her own work to Women's Home Industries ‚Äì this time a grospoint carpet she had created over eight years, from 1941, and had been created to a traditional 18th-century design. Consisting of 12 panels, it was stitched together by the Royal School of Needlework, which had also supplied the design for Queen Mary to work on. The Times reported that, apart from the section joining, it had been all the Queen's own work ‚Äì including blending of colours. Subsequently, the carpet was presented by Princess Elizabeth to the National Gallery of Canada, as a gift from the Imperial Order Daughters of the Empire. 1950s production By the early 1950s, Women's Home Industries was in the swing of production. A sale announcement in The Times in January 1951 described a range of goods, including women's cardigans and bed jackets, men's socks and sweaters and layette clothing for babies. The royal association continued; in 1954 a fashion show and reception at The Dorchester was attended by the Duchess of Kent, while in 1957 the Queen Mother was among the needlewomen creating 72 kneelers for Washington National Cathedral. This order for the US cathedral also included communion rail kneelers and bishops' cushions and was to be located in the War Memorial Chapel. By 1958, the association between the WVS and Women's Home Industries had ended, although Lady Reading continued as chair of both. That year, Alison Settle described the company's new \\"sweater shop\\" in West Halkin Street, saying: \\"They design superbly styled jackets, cardigans and pullovers for men, women and children...this idea has not caught on greatly here but is vastly popular in America, and exports account for the major part of their trade\\". Settle also described a new sweater elongated into a dress ‚Äì a novel design first ordered by the store Magnins of California. While this was not to the British taste, the store's woollen party dresses for children were popular with both UK and US buyers. 1960s couture reputation The company took on a far more commercial and fashion conscious approach as the 1960s dawned, although it already had a loyal customer base among US visitors to London and supplied several French couture houses. In 1963, the company appointed Foxbridge as its agent to handle the sales to US and Canadian markets. In 1964, Women's Home Industries was part of an export promotion to the US, joining forces with names such as Simpsons, Burberry, Jaeger and Dunhill to send a large shipment of menswear to Bloomingdales and Filene's. This was supported with a ten-page promotional feature on London W1 fashion in Sports Illustrated. Writing in The Guardian, Alison Adburgham said: \\"There is nothing homely about the hand-knits\\". She described a revival both of traditional crafts and patterns ‚Äì its 'wedding ring' (cobweb) shawls, so fine they could be pulled through a ring, were made in the Outer Hebrides using single-ply Shetland wool and some took over six months to make. Most of the creators of these cobweb shawls were elderly women ‚Äì younger knitters lacked the patience ‚Äì and patterns were said to be based on lace designs worn by survivors of the Spanish Armada washed up on the islands. At the other end of the scale, its chunky men's knits included not only Arans, but also traditional English patterns such as a Northumberland Seahouses design, based on a traditional fisherman's guernsey sweater and sourced from authorities on traditional patterns. Hosiery and hand-made knits A year later, Women's Home Industries (now sometimes known by the acronym WHI), was featured in a fashion piece about the latest trends in hosiery, including the 'dressmaker stocking' ‚Äì a stocking cut to the leg shape from unusual and decorative fabrics and seamed up the back. The article reported that: \\"Women's Home Industries has been red hot with enthusiasm from customers for handknit stockings in thick wool\\". For summer it had produced cotton designs ‚Äì mostly crocheted in pastel colours and costing four guineas a pair. By this stage, Women's Home Industries was supplying Jaeger with crocheted stockings and gloves sets in colours such as pale blue and lemon yellow. This was part of a trend towards all things handcrafted, as a writer in The Times put it in 1966: \\"The hand-made look is infinitely desirable ‚Äì provided that other hands have done the work. Nimble-fingered grandmothers all over the country have been pressed into service to produce the kind of work their granddaughters laughed at three years ago. The Women's Home Industries...has a booming business collecting and retailing the products of domestic craft\\". Two years on, Prudence Glynn also noted the demand for clothes that \\"at least look handmade\\", suggesting this might be a desire for individuality in an era of mass production. She recommended Women's Home Industries as \\"the real McCoy\\". During the 1960s the company's products began appearing in high-fashion features ‚Äì for instance, its extra long knitted scarf costing six guineas was worn with a swagger-back mink coat and fur-lined boots in a fashion feature about wrapping up for the weather in January 1969. By this stage, Women's Home Industries was not only operating from West Halkin Street, but also had a dedicated tapestry store in Pimlico Road, specialising in canvas embroidery work and taking on client commissions, which were executed by trained artists designing exclusively for the shop. Workforce and production methods Suppliers for Women's Home Industries remained largely home-based. In 1964, there were over 3,000 knitters based around the country, said to be ranging in age from young to elderly. A 1970 Times article about part-time working said that the company was looking for between 300 and 400 hand knitters to supply its store. It was also looking for crochet, tapestry and needlepoint workers. To apply for knitting commissions, women were advised to send in a three-inch knitted swatch created in stocking stitch. Upon approval, a test commission would be offered (this would be paid work). Rates thereafter depended on the complexity of the commission but started at around 30 shillings for a plain cardigan. While the knitting was done at home, the making up was undertaken in Women's Home Industries' workrooms, where garments were moulded, seamed and sometimes lined. It was this, according to Alison Adburgham, that gave its products the couture look. WHI would also undertake repairs and specialist cleaning at its West Halkin Street premises. Influence of Beatrice Bellini From the 1950s on, Beatrice Bellini was a key influence on the direction of Women's Home Industries, acting as its designer and also sourcing yarns in keeping with fashion trends. In the 1960s she was sourcing Lurex and silk yarns to ensure WHI kept pace with the vogue for knitwear as evening wear. In some instances, she had yarn spun to her own designs and would also ensure that each new pattern was based on a toile (test garment). She would also source the knitters best suited to each particular garment. Such was her reputation at the start of the 1970s, that Bellini was one of eleven UK fashion names chosen for an exhibition showcasing British talent at The Louvre ‚Äì at the invitation of the director of Mus√©e des Arts D√©coratifs ‚Äì entitled L'Idee de la Forme. It was funded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and included industrial and graphic design. Other fashion names in the mix included Barbara Hulanicki, Bill Gibb, Jean Muir, Ossie Clark and Christopher McDonnell. Accessories were supplied by names such as jewellers Gerda Flockinger and Wendy Ramshaw and shoemakers The Chelsea Cobbler and Rayne. The selector for the fashion end of the exhibition was Michael Haynes, with Elsbeth Juda as advisor. Bellini also assisted other leading craftspeople, notably Kaffe Fassett. He recalls in his autobiography taking a needlepoint design to Women's Home Industries' tapestry shop, which Bellini was running at the time. She asked him to create more designs and these were sold through the store, with clients subsequently requesting private commissions from Fassett. During the 1970s, Fassett also supplied hand knits for Beatrice Bellini and needlepoint kits for Women's Home Industries. Archive material An archive for Women's Home Industries, including knitting patterns, garments and sample books is held in the University of the Arts' London College of Fashion archive. The Victoria and Albert Museum has several items by Women's Home Industries, including a 1950s Beatrice Bellini sweater that so impressed the couturier Edward Molyneux that he permitted it to be named \\"Molyneux\\" in his honour. Its archive also contains a colourful 1970s skirt designed by Kaffe Fassett and made up by Beatrice Bellini.

She appeared in films like In Like Flint (1967), House of 1,000 Dolls (1967), A Swingin' Summer (1965), Pajama Party (1964) and as a beach extra in the TV series The Beverly Hillbillies. Bond also had several uncredited roles such as an air hostess in Seconds (1966) and a body double for Claudia Cardinale in Blindfold (1965). After relocating to Italy and studying art, she became an artist using mainly feminist issues to fuel her creativity. Biography Early years and film career Diane Loretta Bond was born on September 25, 1945 in Los Angeles, California, and grew up horseback riding, skating and skiing on her father's ranch in Colorado. As a teenager, she was spotted on a beach and given a modeling contract. Another one of her early jobs, performing as a trapeze artist, paved the way for her introduction to movies, when she was hired to perform in a 1963 television series The Greatest Show on Earth. A year later, she made her film debut as a beach girl in Pajama Party (1964), which set the tone of her movie career, as she wore a bikini in every one of her credited film appearances. Bond appeared as Emily Lawrence in a 1964 episode of Petticoat Junction called \\"Mother of the Bride\\". She received featured billing in 1965's A Swingin' Summer, as the \\"girl in the polka dot bikini\\" and the opening credits show her in her pink and white bikini dancing on water skis. The film starred James Stacy, William Wellman Jr., Quinn O‚ÄôHara and a newcomer, Raquel Welch. Her next film, Tickle Me (1965), starring Elvis Presley was limited to a few appearances at the swimming pool. She returned to television with a couple of appearances in 1965 on The Beverly Hillbillies with a role as a beach extra, and then did a role doubling for Claudia Cardinale in Blindfold (1966). Her best known film was In Like Flint (1967), directed by Gordon Douglas, where she played Jan, one of secret agent (James Coburn) Derek Flint's girlfriends. Bond was very athletic and often did her own stunts or hired out as a stunt woman between acting jobs. In the 1967 filming of House of 1,000 Dolls she shinned down a 60-foot drainpipe and completed the scene in one take. Bond's last known film appearance was an uncredited bit part in the 1968 Jane Fonda film Barbarella. Italian years In 1967, Bond moved to Italy and began studying art, attending the Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera of Milan and the School of Fine Arts at the Sforza Castle, graduating in 1976. She began working with a group of feminists on several projects. Meeting at the cultural center Cicip & Ciciap they held various discussions on women's issues, including political and social restrictions. In 1978, they published a book, Ci vediamo mercoled√¨. Gli altri giorni ci immaginiamo (We'll see you Wednesday. The other days we imagine.) which was a collection of photographs exploring feminist issues. The women worked both individually and collectively to produce the images; for example, one segment features photographs by Paola Mattioli taken of Bond in 1977. The series shows Bond in a mirror removing a white mask. The collection of photos of Bond by Mattioli was presented in an exhibition from October to December 2014, in Milan. One of her ongoing works of art is called \\"Dolls on the Road\\", which are like paperdolls on canvas, depicting the way women are \\"cut out\\" of society. Long before The Flat Stanley Project began documenting paperdoll travels, Bond's dolls, beginning with \\"Donna\\" in 1976, were traveling the world, being photographed, obtaining passport stamps to prove their existence. For thirty years, Bond has traveled with her \\"dolls\\" on three continents.

The Richland Creek watershed includes at least eight tributaries, not all of which are named: *Jocelyn Hollow Branch (roughly follows Jocelyn Hollow Road) *Vaughn's Gap Branch (follows Harding Pike) *Chickering Branch (along Chickering Road) *Belle Meade Branch (follows Harding Place) *Sugartree Creek (follows Woodmont Boulevard) *Bosley Springs Branch (near St. Thomas Hospital) *Murphy Road Branch (along Murphy Road) *and smaller unnamed tributaries Richland Creek has an approximate elevation of . Its mouth is a south branch of the Cumberland River shown at these coordinates: . Its source is in west Nashville and consists of the confluence of at least eight streams. One is near Tyne Boulevard at Fredericksburg Drive and mostly follows Tyne northwest toward Belle Meade Boulevard. There it is joined by a Chickering Branch arising near Chickering Lane and flowing along the east side of Chickering Road. After crossing under Belle Meade Boulevard, Richland Creek is joined by its Belle Meade Branch (which flows roughly parallel to Harding Place west of Hillsboro Road) then winds through the golf course of Belle Meade Country Club. The creek adds a Vaughn's Gap Branch near Harding Academy and continues past Belle Meade Plantation, then receives the Jocelyn Hollow Branch (which flows from the West Meade subdivision) at a point near the intersection of Leake Avenue and Harding Road. Richland Creek then flows past Congregation Ohabai Sholom, picks up some small springs and crosses under Harding Road (Highway 70 South) near the intersection of Belle Meade Boulevard. It merges with Sugartree Creek (which roughly follows Woodmont Boulevard) near the intersection of Harding Road and White Bridge Road. From this point, Richland Creek meanders behind St. Thomas Hospital and Aquinas College in a northerly path along White Bridge Road. It picks up the Bosley Springs Branch and the Murphy Road Branch and flows near Briley Parkway past England Park and West Park to reach the Cumberland River at the end of Robertson Avenue. The more industrialized area of Richland Creek is at its northwest course near where it flows into the Cumberland River. As of 2016, this area included a rock quarry, a concrete mixing facility and several large petroleum bulk storage terminals. History of environmental issues In 1936, millions of dead fish appeared in the Cumberland River near the mouth of Richland Creek. This was believed to be from pollution by the discharging of poisonous dyestuffs into Richland Creek by factories nearby. In 1946, the city of Nashville commissioned an engineering report which found inadequate sewage disposal and recommended a sewage treatment plant and a new system of intercepting sewers. That year the Tennessean stated, \\"the lower reaches of Richland Creek can be considered only as a open sewer\\". In 1970, complains of pollution in Richland Creek prompted an independent scientific study by a group of several university professors called \\"The Nashville Committee for Scientific Information\\". The study found that Richland Creek was being polluted not only by private industries but also by the sewer system of Nashville's Metropolitan Government. In an editorial by the Tennessean, the group was said to be serving the public interest free of political influence or financial support. The committee reported massive pollution in Richland Creek by raw sewage from the Metro Government sewer system, as well as by bacteria and industrial wastes from the drainage ditches which flow into the creek. Current environmental status As of 2016, there continues to be a public health and safety contact advisory placed on Richland Creek because of chronic sewer issues‚Äì it is on The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC) 303(d) \\"List of Impaired Waterbodies\\". The U.S. Congress mandated that all states develop a Source Water Assessment Program in the \\"1966 Safe Drinking Water Act\\". Tennessee's program was approved by the EPA in 1999. The state produces a document every two years on the status of water quality, known as the 305(b) Report. The impairment of Richland Creek is by several contaminants, primarily stormwater runoff which flushes pollutants into Richland Creek during heavy rainstorms. Ideally, sewage and stormwater should be kept separate. When defects allow rainwater or surface water to find its way into the sewer system it decreases the capacity of the sewer to perform efficiently. This ultimately causes breaches and overflows into nearby creeks and tributaries. In 2011, Montgomery Bell Academy began work on a geothermal installation on school property adjacent to West End Avenue. During the drilling process, sewage surfaced where the work was being done. It was determined that when remodeling a neighboring fire station, the sewer lines were mistakenly routed to an abandoned storm sewer instead of the sanitary sewer. The sewage was sent underground to the groundwater where it entered the Richland Creek near the Bosley Springs branch. The E. coli values dropped at that site after the repair was made, but this was far from a complete answer. Improvements made Wastewater equalization tank, West Park, Nashville,Tennessee. Pumping station to left of tankIn 2009, a Consent Decree between the US Government, the State of Tennessee, and the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County was entered with the US District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. It was filed on behalf of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC). It included correction of sanitary sewer overflows, not just at Richland Creek but at several other sites in the city. Construction began in 2009 on the West Park Equalization Basin and Wet Weather pump station. This includes two above-ground tanks large enough to temporarily hold 31 million gallons of liquid when sewer flow exceeds the capacity of the treatment plant. The tanks, called \\"equalization facilities\\", hold the sewage until the stormwater recedes, then send the sewage to the treatment plant at an optimal processing rate. The project is aided by a wet-weather pump that can handle 45 million gallons per day. The West Park Project was dedicated by Mayor David Briley on August 18, 2018, and its site includes recreational facilities including a lighted softball field, basketball court, picnic area, a pavilion with public rest rooms and other amenities. Artist Eric Henn created a mural on the tank to add public art to the neighborhood. Richland Creek Watershed Alliance, organized in 2007, is a conservation group to preserve the long term environmental stability of the watershed and has been an advocate of the creek on numerous occasions. As of 2016, the organization has engaged volunteers in removing 51 tons of trash and planted over 1700 trees along stream corridors. Flooding Richland Creek was involved in severe flooding in the 2010 Tennessee floods, which caused ten deaths in Nashville's Davidson County. In the aftermath, Metro Government acquired 61 flood-damaged homes in the Delray Drive area along the course of Richland Creek. The homes were torn down to develop England Park‚Äî a green space which helps absorb excess water from Richland Creek during any future flooding. The name, \\"England Park\\" was in honor of Martha and Andy England who drowned in their home in the flood of 2010. The project was financed by federal and state funding along with stormwater fees paid by residents in every part of the city.

(8 July 1915 ‚Äì 14 December 2007) was a pioneer in the Australian oil industry and former World War II RAF Bomber Command pilot. Roy Richter, or Triple R, as he became known by colleagues and friends, was awarded the OBE (Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire) in 1972 for his \\"pioneering and dynamic contribution to the development of the Australian oil-drilling industry\\". Early life Roy Richter was born on his family's farm at Loganlea, Queensland (now more accurately Waterford) in the Logan River area south of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia in 1915 as the youngest of 18 children in a blended family. He was the son of Ernest Otto Julius Richter, a German settler who had arrived with his family as a young boy from Bernau, Prussia in 1865 aboard the migrant ship, Susanna Godeffroy, to make a new life in the Logan district and Bertha Friedericke Stefan (nee Mollenhagen) whose family had also immigrated from Prussian Germany during the 1860s. Ernest O.J. Richter, as well as a farmer, served several terms as a Councillor of the Shire of Tingalpa. After primary years at the nearby local Waterford State School, Roy Richter was offered a scholarship to attend Brisbane State High School in Brisbane city. He attended high school for two years, however, during the Great Depression, he left formal schooling to help his struggling family. He worked firstly for one of his sisters, Lillian (Lil), and her husband, Edward (Ted) Wendt, on their farm at nearby Buccan, and again at Murgon when they moved to a much larger farm. As a teenager, the farm work proved lonely and he returned home and, before its closure in 1934, worked as an apprentice in the blacksmith's shop at the nearby Kingston Gold Mine. Meanwhile, another of his sisters, Martha (Mattie), and her husband, Stanley Middleton, working as a Patrol Officer, were living in Papua New Guinea. On their suggestion, Roy Richter decided to join them. Arriving in Papua New Guinea in 1935, Roy Richter found work in the gold mines and then, fortuitously, in the fledgling oil industry. Learning from books in the field, he became a self-taught mechanical engineer and met the challenges in the remote jungle areas of Papua New Guinea. He would return there following World War II. In 1940, on one of his leaves to mainland Australia, he met and married a nurse, Marie Dempster Lascelles Jardine, descendant of the pioneering Jardine family which settled the Cape York area. The marriage lasted only briefly. The War years With the outbreak of World War II, Roy Richter, now working as an oil driller, returned to Australia to enlist but, because oil was considered vital to the war effort, he was turned away. In September 1942, he returned to Brisbane to re-enlist and gave his name as Robert Roy Richter ‚Äì swapping his first name for his second ‚Äì and did not mention oil. He was accepted and, after initial flight training for the Royal Australian Air Force at the Elementary Flying Training School in Narrandera in New South Wales and then in Canada, he was seconded to the Royal Air Force in Britain as a bomber pilot with further training in Scotland. During his tour of duty he flew Avro Lancaster heavy bombers out of Fulbeck in Lincolnshire with No. 189 Squadron RAF, where he survived 30 sorties over Europe and clocked up 688 hours as a bomber pilot. With the horrendous attrition rate in the elite RAF Bomber Command flight crews, he was fortunate to survive his tour of duty. At the end of the war, while waiting to be demobbed, he met his future second wife ‚Äì Dorothy Mary Audrey Anderson. She was with the Women's Royal Naval Service, or WRNS (known as the Wrens), which was the women's branch of the UK's Royal Navy. Mary, as she was always known, (born 7 September 1923) was from Ashington, Northumberland, England. While waiting to be demobbed, Roy Richter worked for British Petroleum as a driller on its Midlands oilfields, most notably in the Sherwood Forest area. He finally returned to Australia in April 1946 and Mary Anderson followed 18 months later. The couple was married on 17 December 1947, in Brisbane and left almost immediately for the jungles of Papua New Guinea, which was to be the start of a long and distinguished career in the Australian oil and gas industry. Oil industry Over the years, the Richter name became well known in the oil industry, starting out in the 1940-50s with Australian Petroleum Company in Papua New Guinea; from 1954 with Australian Associated Oil Fields firstly in Roma in outback Queensland, then later in the remote Kimberley (Western Australia); followed by more exploration with the forerunner of Australian Associated Resources Limited's Mines Administration Group (Minad) in both Moonie and Roma. With the boom of oil exploration in Australia in the early 1960s, following amendments to the Petroleum Search Subsidy Act 1959, Minad formed a joint venture partnership with Canadian oilman, Peter Bawden, establishing Richter-Bawden Drilling. Roy Richter was appointed the company's managing director based in Brisbane. Richter-Bawden drilled the Moonie and Roma oil and gas fields and the company is credited with building the first gas pipeline in Australia, allowing local gas to be used to generate electricity in the town of Roma. Today, Roy Richter's voice can be heard through one of the several audio panels within the Oil Patch interactive walkthrough display on the history of the local oil and gas industry, which forms part of Roma's The Big Rig and its Oil and Gas Museum tourist attraction. In 1968, the company, against fierce international competition, also won the contract for the first offshore drilling platform in Australia. When the country‚Äôs first offshore blow-out occurred later that year on one of its Bass Strait rigs, the Marlin platform, assistance from internationally renowned Red Adair ‚Äì the American oil well firefighter ‚Äì won Roy Richter membership of the \\"Royal Order of Fire Eaters\\". The Richter-Bawden partnership ended and, from 1974, Shelf Drilling Pty Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Richter Drilling Group, continued operations in Bass Strait. The Richter Drilling Group was formed in 1971, which encompassed Richter International and Shelf Drilling. The companies' overseas exploration for oil and geothermal energy included Tonga, Timor, PNG, New Zealand, Indonesia and the Philippines. Roy Richter's long association with overseas oil drilling companies and oil industry suppliers entailed extensive travel to both Canada and the USA and later to the UK, Middle East, Asia and the Pacific region. By the late 1970s, Richter Drilling was Australia's leading oil drilling contractor with almost 500 employees working across 10 rigs in Australia and the South East Asian region.McCleland, Col (3 May 1981, p51) \\"The Oil Crews Strike It Rich!\\", Sunday Sun, News Ltd. From its inception in 1959, Roy Richter was an active member of QUPEX ‚Äì The Queensland Petroleum Exploration Association ‚Äì serving time as chairman and vice-chairman in 1964 and 1963, respectively, and served as the Chairman of QUPEX Golf for 12 years. He was also a foundation member of the Oilwell Drilling Contractors Association of Australia and former President. Roy Richter was awarded the O.B.E. in 1972 for his \\"pioneering and dynamic contribution to the development of the Australian oil-drilling industry\\". That citation stated that he and his company had \\"drilled more exploratory and producing oil and gas wells than any other company and the success and efficiency of those operations resulted from his outstanding personal contribution and ability to more than equal overseas competition\\". After retirement from Richter Drilling in 1984, he returned to work on a consultancy basis and, several years later, co-formed another oil exploration company with two longtime associates. With 100 years' experience in the oil industry between them, they called the new company Century Drilling. Later years From the outset, the family was based in Sunnybank, a southern suburb of Brisbane, Queensland, where Roy and Mary Richter lived until their full- time move to the family's holiday home in Surfers Paradise. As a young man, Roy Richter played competitive cricket alongside his brothers and was an expert marksmen, however, in the 1960s, he developed a passion for golf and played regularly until his late eighties. Roy Richter died on 14 December 2007. Three months later, Mary Richter died on 17 March 2008. The couple is survived by three children, Christine (Tissie) Richter, Suzanne (Suzy) Richter and Robert Richter; and two grand-daughters, Georgia Richter-Ward and Alice Richter-Ward. Roy Richter's funeral service was held at the historic Bethania Lutheran Church in the Logan River area, which was built by German settlers in 1872. He and all his siblings were baptised and confirmed in the church. Roy Richter was buried in the adjoining graveyard alongside his grandparents, parents and many other members of his family.

The usage arose in the context of the \\"bailouts\\" of Cyprus, Greece, Ireland and Portugal necessitated by their prospective insolvency caused by the world financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008. Originally, the European troika was the designation of the triumvirate that represented the European Union in its foreign relations, in particular concerning its common foreign and security policy (CFSP), until the Treaty of Lisbon was ratified in 2009.  Background of the financial crisis bailout troika The role of the Troika 2013 protests against troika in Slovenia The term troika has been widely used in Greece, Cyprus (), Ireland, Portugal, and Spain to refer to the consortium of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund that provided a bailout to these member states since 2010 and the financial measures that the institutions have required in return. Slovenia barely avoided intervention by the troika in 2013, thanks to the loan of EUR 1.5 billion acquired at the PIMCO. These institutions owned a wide influence and improved their power through time. They implemented a strong austerity program for the adjustment of Greek fiscal measures. The political impact of the austerity imposed on countries of the EU periphery, which were confronted with important debt, led to \\"a predominant economic and social dislocation\\".[Kinsella, Maurice; Kinsella, Ray. (2018), Troikanomics: Austerity, Autonomy and Existential Crisis in the European Union, Palrgrave McMillan, 217p.  Economic adjustment programmes The origin of the European troika can be traced back to the Greek loan package in May 2010https://www.esm.europa.eu/publications/safeguarding-euro/enter-troika- european-commission-imf-ecb and the EFSF. The work of the three members were distinct: the IMF co-financed the loans for Greece, the ECB focused its competences on the banking system and the Commission worked on economic reforms with the IMF. The troika solution brought controversy into the Euro crisis' solution following the Lisbon Treaty, where European institutions increased democratization among the institutional landscape of the European Union. At this time, the EU was more technocratic and emphasised the domination's feeling of the Troika mechanism. During the crisis period, Germany played also a predominant role and took power to rebalance its national interests and the European interests. The European strategy was implemented with the aim to reduce the Greek fiscal deficit from 15% to 5%https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/hall/files/hall2016_insrchofeur.pdf. In 2015, the GDP of Greece remained stagnant comparatively to 2009 and the loans appeared as not sufficient to attempt the fiscal aims fixed by the troika: 90%https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/hall/files/hall2016_insrchofeur.pdf of the amount payed interests. For Cyprus, Greece (thrice), Ireland and Portugal, the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF agreed Memoranda of Understanding with the relevant governments in a three-year financial aid programme on the condition of far-reaching austerity measures to be imposed on their societies in order to cut government expenditure. For details in each case, see * Economic Adjustment Programme for Cyprus * First Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece  Second Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece * Economic Adjustment Programme for Ireland * Economic Adjustment Programme for Portugal Evolution The support of social benefits and wages was unable to deal with the crisis. With a decreasing social situation and a weak domestic production, the Greek debt grew and overtook the GDP rate. For the creditor countries, one of the most important aspects and efficient condition for the bailout was the liberalisation of product and the labour market in Greece. Although the plans affected to create a stronger economy in Greece leading to a certain performance, they were not efficient in short run. This case showed that these reforms taken in a context of fiscal austerity could lead to negative effect and did not provide improvement in a short time.  Institutions involved  The term ‚Äòtroika‚Äô has its origins in the Russian word for a three-horse carriage, but it is also used to describe an informal alliance between three actors. In the context of the Euro crisis, the term ‚ÄòTroika‚Äô refers to the cooperation between three actors: the European Commission, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The Troika set out the conditions under which financial assistance, or promises of assistance, would be approved to European countries in financial difficulties. When the three organisations offered assistance, the necessary measures and reforms were imposed in the form of a Memorandum of Understanding between the Troika and the Member States concerned. The legal basis for the action taken by the Commission and the ECB can be considered debatable. The creation of this mechanism was due to a political and legal gap in the Treaty of Maastricht. Article 125 TFEU together with article 123 TFEU prevents countries of the eurozone with financial problems from being supported by other stakeholders, like the European Central Bank, European Union institutions or other eurozone countries, within the Monetary Union.Therefore, the competences of the Troika originated in a statement taken by the Heads of State and Government of the EU member states to establish a joint programme and to provide conditional bilateral loans to Greece. The Troika falls outside the scope of European law. The Troika can be considered as a working group in charge of negotiating financial assistance programmes with indebted eurozone countries. Apart from that, it also carries out evaluations of the implementation level of the programme. The financial assistance in itself is provided by special mechanisms, such as the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) and the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). These financial programmes are concluded outside the European Treaties, and thus outside of the jurisdiction of EU law. However, all EU institutions should act in accordance with the Rule of Law, even when exercising outside of the Treaties.Art. 3, ¬ß6 TEU; Art. 4 in fine TEU. International Monetary Fund The role of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a member of the Troika was not considered evident at the time. Firstly, this organisation is an 'outsider'; it is not an institution of the European Union. A second objection was that relying on the IMF's help was an admission of failure of the eurozone, and a dent in confidence in the euro. In the months leading up to the euro crisis, the IMF already had concerns that countries in the European periphery would be a potential threat to the other major financial markets in Europe via their commercial banks‚Äô balance sheet exposures. When the first effects of the crisis emerged in Greece, the IMF was kept at a distance. The EU saw this as an internal matter and wanted to resolve it internally. After all, the IMF was pulled in anyway. It was seen as a reliable, neutral organisation that had enormous expertise in helping highly indebted countries. The IMF was responsible, together with the Finance ministers, for the decision making in the financial programmes. European Commission The role of the European Commission within the European Troika is to participate in the Troika negotiations and the periodical supervising exercises on behalf of the eurozone Member States that provided the loans to the Eurozone countries in financial need. This function raises some concerns with the ‚Äòindependent‚Äô function of the European Commission within the EU‚Äôs political framework. According to article 17 of the TEU ‚Äúthe Commission has to act completely independent in carrying out its responsibilities, and they shall refrain from any action incompatible with their duties or the performance of their tasks.‚ÄùArticle 17 TEU. The fact that the Commission is acting on behalf of the member states in case of financial assistance programs is far removed from its political role. The question remains as to how the Commission can reconcile its task within the EU and within the Troika. By acting on behalf of some Member States, the Commission is departing from its independent position. European Central Bank Formally the European Central Bank (ECB) does not participate in the decision-making of the programme, these decisions are taken by the IMF and the Finance ministers of the Member States. The role of the ECB can be divided into three groups: A first aspect is the role of verbal interventions addressed to distressed Member States and financial markets. Its second role is the one where the ECB changes collateral policy and large-scale medium-term liquidity creation to encourage markets to invest in higher-yielding government bonds. Its third and most controversial role is the one where the ECB launches the Securities Market Programme, a kind of shaping programme that targets fiscal adjustment and structural reforms in the fiscal policy of individual member states. The ECB also provides advice and expertise on a broad range of issues relevant to the monetary policy and the financial stability of the eurozone countries. Critics of the Troika The consequences of the decisions taken by the European Troika resulted in many critics both within the European institutions and at national levels. The European Parliament was excluded from negotiations and therefore decided to establish a special committee of inquiry led by the Austrian centre-right MEP Othmar Karas in order to analyse the level of the Troika's accountability. According to the findings of the committee, the Troika's members had totally asymmetric distribution of responsibilities. In addition, differing mandates together with varying negotiation and decision- making structures only led to more divisions and made it difficult to find a common approach. As said the British MEP Sharon Bowles, the response to the crisis lacked transparency and necessary credibility. In fact, the Troika did not have any legal basis at all because it was established as an emergency solution. However, a German politician Norbert Lammert stated that in his view it was incorrect to discuss the lack of democratic legitimacy of the Troika since the adjustment programmes had been approved by the parliaments of Ireland, Portugal, Cyprus and Greece. But when the parliaments approved those programmes, they did not know what implications it might bring. The Troika interventions generated long-lasting political damage not only for the European Union but also for its member states themselves. Many European citizens claimed that the budget cuts resulted in the eurozone's longest recession since the creation of the single currency back in 1999. During that period, the efficiency of the Troika was another cause of concern but the ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet tried to reassure people and highlighted the fact that \\"if nothing had been done for Greece, the impact of the crisis would have been undeniably worse for this country\\". As it turned out, the Troika underestimated the impact of austerity policies on economic growth. Another problem was in the different philosophies in relation to economic policy across the EC, the ECB and the IMF according to the European Commissioner in charge of economic and monetary affairs Olli Rehn. Whereas the IMF advocated for more robust debt relief, the EU insisted on more limited option. The European institutions prioritised the maintenance of the cohesion and protection of own rules. Apart from that, the members of Troika could not agree upon potential risk of financial spillovers across member states of the eurozone. For the European institutions this was a very sensitive topic this is why the objective was to avoid debt restructuring. If only the Troika paid more attention to cross-country spillovers and deteriorating conditions, the consequences could have been less harmful. The academic community criticised the Troika just as other stakeholders accusing it of having an immense power and pursuing a fiscal conservatism approach . Based on the case studies, scholars as Kevin Featherstone and Judith Clifton together with Daniel Diaz- Fuentes and Ana Lara G√≥mez came to the conclusion that austerity policies in Greece were more brutal rather than in Ireland putting an emphasis again on the political and socio-economic consequences as administrative reforms, unemployment, emigration, serious deterioration of citizens' physical and mental health. Another prominent critics of the Troika are Yanis Varoufakis, a former Greek finance minister , and a German writer Fritz R. Glunk together with an American academic Noam Chomsky. Common foreign and security policy This term was used in the European Union when referring to a triumvirate composed of the Foreign Affairs Minister of the Member State holding the (rotating) Presidency of the Council of Ministers, the Secretary-General of the Council of the European Union (who also held the post of High Representative of the Common Foreign and Security Policy), and the European Commissioner for External Relations. The \\"Tro√Øka\\" represented the European Union in external relations that fell within the scope of the common foreign and security policy (CFSP). With the 2009 ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, the post of Secretary-General of the Council was separated from the post of High Representative for the CFSP, which then assumed the responsibilities of the European Commissioner for External Relations. Since only two of the original posts making up the troika still exist, the definition of a triumvirate is no longer met.

It served the town for a time as its public library, and is now owned by Historic New England, serving as a gallery space and as the visitors center for the adjacent Sarah Orne Jewett House. Description and history The Jewett- Eastman House is located on the north side of Portland Street, just east of its junction with Main Street at the center of South Berwick's main village. It is located just east of the National Historic Landmark Sarah Orne Jewett House, which stands at that corner. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a front-facing gable roof and clapboard siding. The original main entrance is located on the right bay of the three-bay front facade, set in a recessed opening flanked by Doric pilasters and topped by an entablature. The gable end is fully pedimented, with pilasters at the building corners and an entablature encircling the building below the roofline. Single-story wings extend to either side of the main block from near its rear, and a hip-roof porch extends along the left side of the building, sheltering what is now the main entrance in the left wing. The house was built about 1850 by Theodore Furbur Jewett for his son, Theodore Herman Jewett. The younger Jewett had been living in his father's house, which is where his first daughter Sarah was born in 1849. He raised is children in this house, which was passed to his daughter Carol when she married Edwin Eastman. The Jewett homestead next door was given to Sarah and her sister Mary, both spinsters who died without issue. and Theodore Jewett Eastman, the son of Carol and Edwin Eastman, donated both houses to the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities (SPNEA), now Historic New England (HNE). The house was adapted for use as the South Berwick Public Library in the 1970s, and was sold by SPNEA in 1984 to a local non-profit. The house was repurchased by HNE in 2011 after the library moved out, and has been adapted for use as a gallery and function space, and as the visitors center for the adjacent Sarah Orne Jewett House.

The Council's members represent the private employee benefits community and either sponsor directly or provide services to retirement and health benefit plans both nationally and internationally. The Council advocates for legislation and regulations in support of the employment-based benefits system,\\"How the outcome of the presidential race could influence benefits\\". Employee Benefit News, Cort Olsen May 01 2016 The Council also serves as a technical resource on benefits issues for lawmakers, the media and other industry trade associations.\\"U.S. top court rules for Liberty Mutual over Vermont healthcare law\\". Reuters Washington Mar 1, 2016 By Lawrence Hurley The Council frequently works with other public policy organizations to develop a collective business community position about benefits issues. History The Council was originally known as the Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans (APPWP) until September 2000. It was founded in February 1967 by a group of executives in employee benefit consulting firms, plan sponsors and financial institutions. Its original purpose was to monitor public policy as it related to employee benefits. In 1978, APPWP became a 501(c)(6) organization and began to include advocacy in its activities after the passing of ERISA. The Council has been part of a number of coalitions focused on employer-sponsored benefits, including the Global Pension Coalition, the Employers' Coalition on Medicare (ECOM), How America Saves: The Coalition to Protect Retirement, the Consumer-Purchaser Alliance and the National Coalition on Benefits. The Council has an ongoing partnership with the MetLife Symposium and the International Employee Benefits Association (IEBA).  Policy Issues  The Council examines a wide variety of benefits issues, in particular employee retirement and health benefits. Specific issues include defined contribution/401(k) plans, defined benefit pension plans, retiree health programs, health care reform under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), consumer-directed plans (HSAs/FSAs/HRAs), wellness programs and executive compensation. Board of directors The American Benefits Council is operated by a Board of Directors, whose executive members make decisions concerning the public policy positions of the Council. The Advisory Council consists of additional Council members who participate in Board meetings as well as in dialogue on policy issues but do not vote on Council policies. Previous Chairs of the Board have been representatives of employer plan sponsors, including The Dow Chemical Company, Cigna and FedEx, as well as of consulting firms and financial institutions such as Mercer, Willis North America, Fidelity and Vanguard.  Impact on legislation  The Council was active during the development of President Obama‚Äôs healthcare reform bill, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). The Council published a set of proposals on reforming health care quality, cost and coverage and met with members of Congress and presidential transition team officials in January of 2009, shortly before President Obama‚Äôs inauguration. Council members continued to point out various consequences of the law both during Congressional debate and afterward, helping to produce the best possible legislation. President James Klein testified before the U.S. Senate Finance Committee on May 12, 2009 on financing health care reform and again before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and Labor on June 23, 2009 on the Tri-Committee (Education and Labor, Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce committees) Draft Proposal for Health Care Reform. The Council also contributed to and/or influenced a number of other pieces of legislation. During the development of the Pension Protection Act (PPA), Council members testified before the House Education and the Workforce Committee on March 2, 2005, before the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures on March 8, 2005 and before the Senate House, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee on April 26, 2005. The council discussed regulation of swaps as they relate to pension plan investments during the development of the Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Council members spoke out against the Patients‚Äô Bill of Rights and the Health Security Act; these bills did not pass. The council was also vocal about the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, HIPAA, the Tax Act of 1986, ERISA, EGTRRA.  American Benefits Institute  The American Benefits Institute is the education and research affiliate of the Council. The Institute convenes meetings and sponsors research that assist public policy makers, the media and other stakeholders in making informed decisions about employee benefits policy matters. The Institute is also the principal venue where Council members discuss global benefits policy issues and share information about international health and retirement plan and compensation practices. The Institute provides information about benefit practices outside the United States and informs non-U.S. based companies about employee benefits policy and legislative and regulatory developments in the United States.  Publications  The Council prepares or sponsors research papers and surveys on employer- sponsored benefits.

It was felled in 1818 and made into furniture, including a chair, made by Thomas Chippendale, the younger, that was presented to George IV and remains in the British Royal Collection. One of the souvenir hunters was Sir Walter Scott. In 1824 for a commission by Scott, Joseph Angell, a London silversmith, incorporated the wood into a silver quaich.

It was discovered in a French free-market and returned to its rightful owners in 2010. The dead tree was purchased by John Children, a Librarian in the British Museum and father of Anna Children, the artist of sketch to the right. He felled the tree and had it shipped to England. Apart from the Waterloo chair in the Royal collection, he had some other items made from the lumber: a minerals cabinet, a small table cabinet, a writing table, a work-table (owned by Anne Atkins), a chair, and a stand with the bark still on it, for a bust of Wellington.

Ware Jr.  Early and family life  Ware was born on December 22, 1880, in Fort Monroe, Elizabeth City, Virginia to James and Adelaide Ware, a military family. Joseph was the youngest of the couples nine children, with six older sisters and two older brothers. His older sister Adelaide Minerva Ware died in infancy, though the rest of his siblings lived to adulthood. On October 9, 1914, Ware married Susie H. Robinson in Montgomery County. Together they had two children, Joseph F. Ware Jr. (born November 8, 1916) and James Ware (born February 10, 1919). James lived only 20 hours, and Joseph Sr. never met him. In April 1923 Susie divorced Joseph Sr. for \\"desertion of family\\" she eventually remarried, and was divorced a second time. Susie died December 5, 1979 at the age of 87. Joseph Sr. went on to marry a woman he met in Germany, who was named Mary. The two of them lived together until his death in 1969, and are both buried in Arlington National Cemetery.  Education  Ware attended Hampton High School in Hampton, Virginia. Ware enrolled at Virginia Polytechnic Institute in 1899 and majored in electrical engineering. While a student at V.P.I., he excelled as a football and baseball player. Ware was an All-Southern end for the football team in 1901. As a senior in 1903, Ware was captain of the baseball team, which posted an 8‚Äì4 record.http://www.hokiesports.com/baseball/extras/recordbook.pdf Ware also served as Commandant of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets from 1911 to 1914, and was a professor of Military Science and Tactics, and assistant in mathematics.  Post-graduation Upon graduation in 1903, Ware was appointed a second lieutenant in the United States Army. In 1917, Ware trained at Plattsburg Training Camp, in Plattsburgh, New York. The Plattsburg Camp was a product of the \\"Plattsburg Movement,\\" in which volunteer military training camps for civilians were highly encouraged and seen as patriotic. The Plattsburg Movement eventually became the \\"basis of recruiting influence in military policy\\" at the start of the US' involvement in the war, and almost one half of the officer corps graduated from the Plattsburg Movement. In June 1918, Ware left the camp for Camp Merritt, a pass-through point for soldiers heading to Europe. Four million troops were sent to the Western Front during WWI, and one million of them passed through Camp Merritt. On June 9, 1918, Ware left Camp Merritt for the piers at Hoboken, New Jersey, staying for three days until he left for France on June 12 with the 308th Field Sig Battalion of the American Expeditionary Force (A.E.F.). France Ware arrived in France, under the 3rd Corps, in time for the last drive around Chateau Thierry, one of the first actions of the A.E.F. under General John J. Pershing as a part of the Second Battle of the Marne. In mid-September of 1918, Ware participated in the Battle of St. Mihel, as a member of the 80th Infantry Division in the First Army reserve. In October of 1918, Ware became Chief Signal Officer of the 2nd Army, due to dismissal from the front lines as a result of being ill. Ware was in the push of the 2nd Army on November 9 during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, during which he was wounded by a bursting shell, breaking his left ear drum; one piece hit his back below his left shoulder blade, left arm, and left hand. As a result of this he was recommended for the United States Signal Corps (U.S.C.) and became division signal officer under General Crondite and Jack Barnes, during which time he traveled to Langres to lecture to staff college. In November, Ware received notice that he would be sent with the new Army of Occupation, or 3rd Army, which was created following the armistice of November 11, 1918, in order to fulfill the duty of the Allies and the United States to control the administration of areas of the left bank of the Rhine. In the winter and spring of 1919, Ware traveled often, frequently in Toul, Mihiel, Coblenz, Luxembourg, and Nogent en Bassigny while based in Le Mans. In early July of 1919, Ware received an order directing him to report to the Army of Occupation (The Third Army). On Bastille Day, Ware participated in the parade in Le Mans, however he disapproved of the event, stating that he wanted the money spent on the parade to go to aid for those in devastated areas. Germany In early August 1919, Ware settled in the banks of the Rhine in Coblenz, Germany. Ware was Chief Signal Officer of the A Fin G. C.O. [sic. --- try to find out what is or don't include], and chief officer of the Telegraph Kaserne, or German barracks, as a lieutenant colonel. During this time, his responsibilities included the communication system of ATG (?). Om March 1921, Ware was promoted to Signal Corps Major, and received a salary of 485 dollars a month. Creation of the SCR-77 Loop Radiotelegraph Set The Signal Corps Radio set was developed in Washington, in order to make a portable apparatus that would provide a more secret and uninterruptible mean of communication with troops in advanced positions. The American Expeditionary Forces in France researched this set as well, and Ware developed the final and most advanced model in June 1918. Ware improved upon the set though a new break-in feature that was similar to that of the common wire telegraph. This new model was considered the most effective means of communication for soldiers in advanced positions and remained in use until the end of the war. Later life Ware and his wife divorced in April 1923. On August 5, 1969, Ware died and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery with his second wife Mary. Ware's son Joseph Ware Jr. would go on to attend Virginia Tech as well, and become a successful flight test engineer and member of the Coast Guard, in addition to founding the Joseph F. Ware Jr. Advanced Engineering Laboratory at Virginia Tech.

During the early part of the war, before the German invasion of Russia, he may have been indiscreet in discussions with the German occupiers of France. He was excluded from underground operations after the Communists became active in the French Resistance following the June 1941 German invasion of Russia. Early years Maurice Tr√©and was born in 1900. He joined the French Communist Party (PCF, Parti communiste fran√ßais), and from 1932 was in charge of the security of the PCF leaders, and of underground operations. Early in 1933 he was made secretary of the PCF's Cadre Commission. The Cadre Commission (commission des cadres) was set up to \\"verify\\" comrades and ensure \\"that a thing was what it was supposed to be\\" ‚Äì to root out informers and politically unreliable members. One technique was to require that all PCF members fill out an autobiographical questionnaire, which could then be analyzed. The Cadre Commission was somewhat secretive, and worked directly with Maurice Thorez, Eugen Fried and the Communist International's agencies. Tr√©and was criticized for taking his policing role to an extreme, for example classifying an activist as suspect if they had a distant cousin in the \\"forces of repression.\\" In October 1936 Arthur Dallidet was given a permanent position in the PCF Cadre Commission as assistant to Tr√©and. Dallidet was the second functionary to be assigned to the Commission. Tr√©and was a member of the PCE Central Committee from 1937 to 1945, and Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI) operative in Western Europe. Treand was close to Thorez, who always showed great respect for him, and also to Jacques Duclos, but does not seem to have had a strong relationship with Andr√© Marty. He was completely trusted by Moscow. However, the security arrangements he established before the war proved inadequate as the government stepped up its surveillance measures after the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact of 23 August 1939 and the start of general mobilization in France. World War II The PCE was officially dissolved in September 1939 after the outbreak of World War II (1939‚Äì45). The leadership of the French Communist Party in the period between the German occupation of France after the armistice of 22 June 1940 and the German invasion of Russia on 22 June 1941 was divided between three locations. Secretary-general Maurice Thorez was in Moscow with Andr√© Marty. In Paris the clandestine party was directed by Beno√Æt Frachon, aided by Arthur Dallidet. In hiding in Brussels were Jacques Duclos, who became the political leader of the party, and later the leader of the Communist Resistance, Maurice Tr√©and and Eugen Fried. After Paris was occupied in June 1940 Tr√©and and Jean Catelas, the deputy for Amiens, began negotiations with the German ambassador for permission to resume open publication of the communist journal l'Humanit√©. The negotiations fell through, and the Soviet Union changed tack and condemned the attempt. In mid-August 1940 Dallidet and Frachon decided not to use the safety devices and hideouts that Maurice Tr√©and had put in place, but to use a new network established by Dallidet. Tr√©and was allowed to continue setting up the clandestine structure in the northern zone, but received no further instructions. He was suspected to have been indiscreet due to trusting too much in the Soviet-German pact. Relations between Dallidet and his former boss Tr√©and were stormy after August 1940. In a report to Duclos dated 26 February 1941 Dallidet attacked Tr√©and, accusing him of \\"travail de groupe\\", an extreme offense in a Stalin-dominated party. Last years Tr√©and was indicted by the candidates commission at the 10th congress of the PCF in June 1945. A series of photographs of Tr√©and taken in 1939, 1944, 1946 and 1948 show a steady deterioration in his physical and mental condition during this period. A commission called by Marty, with Henri Gourdeax and Marcel Servin, heard Treand some time before his death on 26 January 1949.

Print. Stainless steels, duplex steels, titanium-, nickel- and zirconium- alloys are sensitive to the presence of air, oxygen, hydrogen, water vapour and other vapours and gases that may combine with the hot metal as it is being joined. Such gases may combine with the metal to form undesirable compounds that may reduce corrosion resistance or may be instrumental in creating cracks or other structural defects in metals. Weld Purging is generally necessary for the first weld run when joining two separate parts. This sealing weld will be called a ‚Äúroot run‚Äù when it takes more than one run or (pass) to fully seal the root area from above.Fletcher, Michael. \\"Choosing an Effective Weld Purging Technique.\\" Stainless Steel World. 1 Apr. 2013. Web. Once the root run has been completed, it is possible to stop the purging process unless the welding engineer has specified that purging should be continued for the second and third passes for example in case the root weld becomes hot enough to oxidise in the air that will have replaced the purge gas. Purging methods Unwanted gas is generally removed by flushing with an inert gas. Argon is generally used for this purpose but helium is an alternative depending on gas cost and availability. Nitrogen has been used as a purge gas but is unsuitable for some stainless steels. The most common way to remove gas from the weld zone is to flush it away with an inert gas.Fletcher, Michael. \\"Major Advances in Weld Purge Technology.\\" Energy Global. 1 Oct. 2013. Web. . The weld zone can be contained to prevent fresh gas from entering once the contained volume has been purged. Another method of purging is to enclose the metal parts completely in a vacuum chamber and evacuate it, prior to backfilling with inert gas for the welding process.Fletcher, Michael. \\"Repeatable Results.\\" World Pipelines 2012: 139-142. Print. When purging with inert gases, it is important to enter the gas very slowly.Sewell, Ron. \\"Methods of Weld Root Purging for Pipe Welding.\\" Welding Journal 1 Aug. 2000. Print. When using Argon, which is heavier than air, the gas should enter from the bottom of the enclosed space. After filling the base area, be it the bottom of a pipe or tank, it will continue to displace air and move upwards. The displaced air is purged out of a release hole at the top. If process monitoring is desired, and oxygen sensor can be used - ideally placed near the release hole to ensure the weld region is appropriately purged. Helium however, which is also an inert gas should be entered from the top of the enclosed space, where it will first flood across the upper limits and push the trapped air downwards and out through an exit where the oxygen level can be measured until it reaches the required level. The purpose of slow gas entry, typically 5 ‚Äì 7 litres/m (‚Ä¶.CFH), is to avoid turbulence, which would otherwise lengthen the purge process considerably. Welding methods Most weld purging is carried out on joints made by the TIG or GTAW welding process.Fletcher, Michael. \\"Advances in Weld Protection During Fabrication of Stainless SteelTtubes.\\" Welding Design & Fabrication, 1 June 2011. Web. . When the laser welding process is chosen, joints or welds being made on reactive materials will need to be carried out and in the case of electron beam welding, this is carried out in a vacuum, in which case purging takes place by complete evacuation of all gas. For TIG/GTAW welding, the top side (front side) of a weld is normally protected by inert gas flowing through the welding torch and it is the underside (back side) of the weld where atmospheric gases need to be purged. When joining two parts together with a seal weld, it may be necessary to first hold them together, by making tack welds.Sewell, Ron. \\"Gas Purging for Weld Root Control.\\" Welding Design and Fabrication 1 Apr. 2000. Print. This will be carried out by making very short welds at intervals varying according to the size and weight of the two parts. It is very important that the weld purging process should start for the tack welds, so the undersides of those tacks remain clean and shiny, without any oxidation or discolouration. Gases Unwanted gas is generally removed by flushing with an inert gas. Argon is generally used for this purpose but helium is an alternative depending on gas cost and availability. Nitrogen has been used as a purge gas but is unsuitable for some stainless steels.Fletcher, Michael. \\"Purging the System.\\" LNG Industry Autumn (2012). Print. Purge gases must be of a certain quality, in order that the welds are made correctly. Because welds in Argon or Helium which have more than 0.05% (500 ppm) of oxygen will oxidise and discolour, welding engineers will include the mention of the correct gas quality in their welding procedures. If process monitoring is desired, an oxygen sensor can be used to confirm the purge gas has appropriately filled the region of interest prior to starting the weld. Measurement of purge quality There are charts available that show the discolouration of some metals, caused by the presence of oxygen, even at concentrations below 50 parts per million. It is possible to monitor oxygen levels by an instrument known as an oxygen sensor. Many specific brands of oxygen sensor are available, with varying sensitivity, time of response, and other criteria of interest. 1 part per million sensitivity is more than sufficient for almost all welding purposes. Some of these instruments are hand held and powered by battery for ease of use around construction sites where the materials mentioned are being welded and others are powered by mains electricity due to the power requirements needed to run switching operations, collect data and operate internal pumps to draw the purge gas over the sensor for measurement. Accessories To carry out weld purging, there are many proprietary accessories available to suit all kinds of weld joints.Fletcher, Michael. \\"Welders Rise to Meet a Challenge.\\" Welding Journal. Print. Tube and pipe welds with open ended access Inflatable pipe purging systems are the most commonly used, where two inflatable bags (known as dams) are connected by an inert gas tube about 20‚Äù (500 mm) in length with one dam placed either side of the weld. The space between the dams is filled with inert gas that flushes out the air. The residual oxygen is measured by a weld purge monitor until it reaches the desired level for welding to begin.Fletcher, Michael. \\"The Circle of Life.\\" World Pipelines 2013: 57-62. Print. Closing tube and pipe welds In some cases it is not possible to retrieve reusable pipe purging systems so a water-soluble film is the best alternative. Film dams can be placed either side of a weld and held in place with a strong water-soluble adhesive. Water-soluble dams are transparent, allowing welders and quality control engineers to view and check the weld from the underside while it is in progress. After welding, the Dams are simply washed away during water cleaning or hydrostatic leak testing of joints.Sewell, R A. \\"Gas Purging for Weld Root Control during Pipeline Fabrication.\\" Kuwait International Pipeline Conference, Kuwait. 2009. Article. Sheet metal joints Sheet metal joints might be made on a seam welding machine where weld purging is carried out automatically as part of the machine design. Where sheet metal is formed into tanks or vessels prior to welding, the inside of the vessel can be purged with a flow of inert gas, however for larger sizes the cost of the gas and the time taken is unrealistic. In such cases, a weld backing tape can be used. This is a layer of glass fibre band in the centre of a width of adhesive aluminium foil that is placed over the rear of the weld joint. Welds made onto weld backing tape can be carried out faster than normal and the weld bead is cast flat onto the glass fibre leaving an acceptable weld profile behind. This method may leave some discolouration to be cleaned, but dramatically reduces the amount of coking and oxidation that would otherwise take place.Fletcher, M. \\"Gas Purging Optimises Root Welds.\\" Welding Journal (2006): 38-40. Print. Trailing shields To improve weld purging on the front side of welds, a trailing shield can be attached to manual or automatic welding torches to follow behind as the weld is being made. In this way, the weld is kept under an inert gas shield for longer than normal, giving an improved weld quality, while allowing the welder to weld faster. Trailing shields are also supplied to hold against the back side of welds, whether flat or radiused, in order to keep the joint free from oxidation and discolouration.Fletcher, MJ. \\"Stainless Steel Pipe Fabrication.\\" British Stainless Steel Association, 2011. Web. When welding with metals such as Titanium, a secondary inert shielding gas application is necessary to protect the cooling weld bead and heat-affected zone. Trailing cups prevent oxidation by shielding the weld from the atmosphere until it has cooled to a safe temperature. Chambers When separate components need to be welded in an inert atmosphere, they can be placed inside a Weld Purging Chamber that is flushed out completely with inert gas. Welding chambers are mostly built to order, however standard low cost Flexible Welding Enclosures are available, that enable individual or multiples of individual components to be welded in one weld purge cycle.Fletcher, Michael J. \\"Need for Weld Purity Drives Purging Methods.\\" Welding Journal (2013): 36-37. Print. Technicalities Argon is heavier than air. When used as a purge gas, it should be slowly introduced into the bottom of the cavity and allowed to push the ambient gas out of the exhaust port. This method avoids the ambient gas and the purge gas mixing and which would lengthen the weld purge cycle considerably. Helium is lighter than air and so has to be introduced at the top of the cavity with the exhaust at the bottom. For better results a weld purge monitor should be used rather than guessing whether the purge is satisfactory. One weld that has to be cut out and repaired, will always cost more than such an instrument. Cleanliness To ensure an easy purge cycle and a good weld being made, cleanliness has to be considered as part of the weld preparation. All surfaces adjacent to the weld and in a trapped space that is being purged, should be thoroughly cleaned with a permitted industrial cleaning fluid, dried and washed afterwards in demineralized water. Welders and pipe fitters should try to ensure that the purge cavity is always free from oils, paper, moisture, cloth, foam, sponge etc. All such items will give off vapours continually during the weld cycle and could risk contamination of the weld joint and rejection or failure of the weld when in service.Sewell, Ron. \\"Guide Published on Welding Titanium and Its Alloys.\\" Engineering Capacity 1 Sept. 2007. Print. Weld purging products suitable for this work should use specially selected materials for construction with lowest possible vapour pressures to avoid outgassing when the weld zone starts to become warm from welding. As the weld warms the immediate vicinity inside the weld purge space, any materials exposed to the increasing temperature will start to outgas (give off gas). Normally this extra gas should be removed by the continuing weld purge gas flow, however there are times when gas and vapours overwhelm the purge, oxygen levels rise and the weld becomes contaminated. This should be spotted by the welder with his weld purging instrument. Some oxygen sensing instruments have the ability to give an alarm signal or close down the welding operation, when there is an unwanted rise in oxygen level.Sewell, Ron. \\"Marine Construction Pipe Purging for Welding of Alloys, Stainless Steels.\\" Offshore 1 Dec. 1996. Print. Purging can continue until the oxygen level is low enough once more and welding can begin again. To avoid such situations, undesirable materials must be kept away from the weld zone.

The song contains the bitter testimony of a man haunted by the memory of a woman who has \\"a heart of stone.\\" Like many of the demos that feature just Williams and his guitar, the original performance is artlessly affecting and displays his spare, haunting lyrics: ::A jug of wine to numb my mind ::But what good does it do? ::The jug runs dry and still I cry ::I can't escape from you ::These wasted tears are souvenirs ::Of a love I thought was true ::Your memory is chained to me ::I can't escape from you Cover versions * Ray Price recorded the song for Columbia on July 8, 1952 * Jack Scott cut a version of the song. * George Jones recorded a version of the song. * The The also recorded it for their Williams tribute LP Hanky Panky.

Members of some of these groups formed their own ethnic associations or cabildos, in which cultural traditions were conserved, including musical ones. Much of this music is associated with traditional African religionLucumi, Palo, and othersand preserves the languages formerly used in the African homelands. The music is passed on by oral tradition and is often performed in private gatherings difficult for outsiders to access. Lacking melodic instruments, the music instead features polyrhythmic percussion, voice (call-and-response), and dance. African styles have been brought into some mainstream Cuban music.  Origins of Cuban African groups  Rumba drummers Clearly, the origin of African groups in Cuba is due to the island's long history of slavery. Compared to the USA, slavery started in Cuba much earlier and continued for decades afterwards. Cuba was the last country in the Americas to abolish the importation of slaves, and the second last to free the slaves. In 1807 the British Parliament outlawed slavery, and from then on the British Navy acted to intercept Portuguese and Spanish slave ships. By 1860 the trade with Cuba was almost extinguished; the last slave ship to Cuba was in 1873. The abolition of slavery was announced by the Spanish Crown in 1880, and put into effect in 1886. Two years later, Brazil abolished slavery.Detailed references in Thomas, Hugh 1971. Cuba, or the pursuit of freedom. Eyre & Spottiswoode, London; Thomas, Hugh 1997.

Although the exact number of slaves from each African culture will never be known, most came from one of these groups, which are listed in rough order of their cultural impact in Cuba: # The Congolese from the Congo basin and SW Africa. Many ethnic groups were involved, all called Congos in Cuba. Their religion is called Palo. Probably the most numerous group, with a huge influence on Cuban music. # The Oy√≥ or Yoruba from modern Nigeria, known in Cuba as Lucum√≠. Their religion is known as Regla de Ocha (roughly, 'the way of the spirits') and its syncretic version known as Santer√≠a. Culturally of great significance. # The Kalabars from part of Nigeria and Cameroon. These semi-Bant√∫ groups are known in Cuba as Carabali, and their religious organization as Abaku√°. The street name for them in Cuba was √ë√°√±igos. # The Dahomey, from Benin. They were the Fon, known as Arar√° in Cuba. The Dahomeys were a powerful group who practised human sacrifice and slavery long before Europeans arrived, and allegedly even more so during the Atlantic slave trade.Sublette, Ned 2004.

Leaving aside the French, who also came, the Africans from Haiti were a mixture of groups who usually spoke creolized French: and religion was known as vod√∫. # From part of modern Liberia and C√¥te d'Ivoire came the Gang√°. # Senegambian people (Senegal, the Gambia), but including many brought from Sudan by the Arab slavers, were known by a catch-all word: Mandinga. The famous musical phrase Kikiribu Mandinga! refers to them. Subsequent organization The roots of most Afro-Cuban musical forms lie in the cabildos, self-organized social clubs for the African slaves, separate cabildos for separate cultures. The cabildos were formed mainly from four groups: the Yoruba (the Lucumi in Cuba); the Congolese (Palo in Cuba); Dahomey (the Fon or Arar√°). Other cultures were undoubtedly present, more even than listed above, but in smaller numbers, and they did not leave such a distinctive presence. Cabildos preserved African cultural traditions, even after the abolition of slavery in 1886. At the same time, African religions were transmitted from generation to generation throughout Cuba, Haiti, other islands and Brazil. These religions, which had a similar but not identical structure, were known as Lucumi or Regla de Ocha if they derived from the Yoruba, Palo from Central Africa, Vod√∫ from Haiti, and so on. The term Santer√≠a was first introduced to account for the way African spirits were joined to Catholic saints, especially by people who were both baptized and initiated, and so were genuinely members of both groups. Outsiders picked up the word and have tended to use it somewhat indiscriminately. It has become a kind of catch-all word, rather like salsa in music.Sublette, Ned 2004.

Chapter 14 A secret language, for men > only, p190 et seq. African sacred music in Cuba All these African cultures had musical traditions, which survive erratically to the present day, not always in detail, but in general style. The best preserved are the African polytheistic religions, where, in Cuba at least, the instruments, the language, the chants, the dances and their interpretations are quite well preserved. In few or no other American countries are the religious ceremonies conducted in the old language(s) of Africa, as they are at least in Lucum√≠ ceremonies, though of course, back in Africa the language has moved on. What unifies all genuine forms of African music is the unity of polyrhythmic percussion, voice (call- and-response) and dance in well-defined social settings, and the absence of melodic instruments of an Arabic or European kind. Not until after the Second World War do we find detailed printed descriptions or recordings of African sacred music in Cuba. Inside the cults, music, song, dance and ceremony were (and still are) learnt by heart by means of demonstration, including such ceremonial procedures conducted in an African language. The experiences were private to the initiated, until the work of the ethnologist Fernando Ort√≠z, who devoted a large part of his life to investigating the influence of African culture in Cuba. The first detailed transcription of percussion, song and chants are to be found in his great works.Ortiz, Fernando 1950. La Africania de la musica folklorica de Cuba. La Habana, revised ed 1965.Ortiz, Fernando 1951. Los bailes y el teatro de los negros en el folklore de Cuba. Letras Cubanas, La Habana. Continuation of the previous book. There are now many recordings offering a selection of pieces in praise of, or prayers to, the orishas. Much of the ceremonial procedures are still hidden from the eyes of outsiders, though some descriptions in words exist. Yoruba and Congolese rituals Religious traditions of African origin have survived in Cuba, and are the basis of ritual music, song and dance quite distinct from the secular music and dance. The religion of Yoruban origin is known as Lucum√≠ or Regla de Ocha; the religion of Congolese origin is known as Palo, as in palos del monte.Palo is a word derived from the Ki-Kongo mpali, meaning witchcraft. Orovio, Helio 2004. Cuban music from A to Z. p159 There are also, in the Oriente region, forms of Haitian ritual together with its own instruments and music. In Lucumi ceremonies, consecrated bat√° drums are played at ceremonies, and gourd ensembles called abwe. In the 1950s, a collection of Havana-area bat√° drummers called Santero helped bring Lucum√≠ styles into mainstream Cuban music, while artists like Mezcla, with the lucum√≠ singer L√°zaro Ros, melded the style with other forms, including zouk. The Congo cabildo uses yuka drums, as well as gallos (a form of song contest), makuta and mani dances. The latter is related to the Brazilian martial dance capoeira. References . .

Sol Kyung-gu won Best Actor at the 18th Chunsa Film Art Awards for his performance. In addition, the film has been picked up by audiences due to its shocking twist. Plot Top forensic pathologist Kang Min-ho is about to retire so that he can spend time with his daughter who's just returned home after a long stint overseas. But when the dismembered corpse of a young woman, identified as Oh Eun-ah, is found at a local river, Kang agrees to do one last job. He performs a graphic autopsy on her. The primary suspect is environmental activist Lee Sung-ho, who readily admits his guilt to rookie detective Min Seo-young, Kang's former student. Lee says that he committed the crime in order to oppose construction that would divide the river into six parts (hence the six body parts), but the police are baffled when the clues they uncover keep contradicting Lee's confession. Then Lee tells Kang that his daughter has been kidnapped. Lee lets Kang call his daughter, who hears her crying for help. Kang is forced to compromise his professional ethics and tamper with the evidence that must lead to Lee's release from custody within three days, or else Kang's daughter will be killed. Exploring some backstory behind Lee, Min discovers that Kang was involved in another case, which was on three defendants who allegedly raped Lee's sister. Kang's tampers the evidence per money for his sick daughter, showing that the sex wasn't forced, and that the sister was promiscuous. She also learns that Oh Eun-ah was a witness. The three defendants were freed from charge, leaving Lee full of hatred towards Kang per lying at trial. After Kang tampers with enough evidence (including completely dissecting the body of Oh Eun-ah and placing semen in it), Lee is released, and Kang follows him to his home. Min realizes the defendants are all dead and Kang will be next. After Kang viciously beats Lee about his daughter, Lee tells him her location. When Kang, Lee, and Min arrive to the building Lee directed them to, they find his daughter dead in a pile of rose petals. Kang, devastated, tries to gather her body, but he finds that there isn't a body; only her head and limbs are in the petals. Kang collapses in shock: The dismembered body, supposedly of \\"Oh Eun- ah\\" found at the beginning of the film, which Kang also autopsied throughout the film and tampered with, was actually his daughter, while the real Oh Eun- ah was a different hostage. His daughter's cries for help that Kang heard over the phone were actually recorded by Lee prior to her death. She was dead way before the start. Kang cries in agony as flashbacks show the graphic autopsy, where he continues to dissect his daughter's corpse and tampers with it by adding semen, completely unaware at the time. Lee taunts Kang and brags that he will live with the same pain Lee did. Min begs Kang not to kill Lee for his daughter's death, but the doctor takes out her gun and shoots him. Kang, unable to forgive himself, also shoots himself as the police arrive. The film ends with a voiceover from Lee about how easy it is to hate and how hard it is to forgive.

The first pharaoh to have a Sedge and Bee name was Den during the First Dynasty. Most Egyptologists believe that the prenomen was a regnal name. Others think that it originally represented the birth name of the rulers. The term \\"of the Sedge and Bee\\"Rainer Hannig, Gro√ües Handw√∂rterbuch √Ñgyptisch-Deutsch: (2800 - 950 v. Chr.) (2006), p. 261. is written by the hieroglyphs representing a sedge, representing Upper Egypt (ìáì Gardiner M23) and a bee, representing Lower Egypt (ìÜ§ L2), each combined with the feminine ending t (ìèè X1), read as nsw.t and bj.t respectively; the adjectival nisba ending -j is not represented in writing. During the first three dynasties, the prenomen was depicted either alone or in pair with the Nebty name. Semerkhet was the first pharaoh who devoted his prenomen to the Two Ladies. From Pharaoh Huni, the probable last king of the Third Dynasty onward, the prenomen was encircled by the cartouche (the elongated form of the shen ring).  Title  The nswt-bjtj title is recorded from the time of the First Dynasty. It is conventionally paraphrased as \\"Dual King\\" or \\"King of Upper and Lower Egypt\\", but its literal interpretation would be \\"[He of] sedge [and] bee\\". The t hieroglyph (X1) is archaically read as tj, so that in Old Egyptian the transliteration of the title woul be nsw.tj-bj.tj. The spelling sw.t.n in the Old Kingdom was initially interpreted as representing swtn or stn (now deprecated). Kurt Sethe later proposed the interpretation of n-swtj as \\"belonging to the Sut-plant\\". The prepositional n is omitted in the spelling sw.tj. The term nswt is used in reference to the king, but not as a title placed before a royal name.J√ºrgen von Beckerath, Handbuch der √§gyptischen K√∂nigsnamen (1999) p. 4. A rare variant form spells nswt as nzw. In the Amarna Period, an Akkadian cuneiform transliteration of the title is recorded, as in-si-bi-ya, representing a Late Egyptian pronunciation of approximately […™ns…ôÀàŒ≤iÀêja î]. Schenkel (1986) cites a reconstruction of an older Egyptian form, based on the cuneiform, as *jinsiw- bƒ´jVt, where V is an unknown vowel.Wolfgang Schenkel, Das Wort f√ºr K√∂nig (von Ober√§gypten) (1986). University of Heidelberg, p. 64. This would seem to cast doubt on the widespread reading of n(j)-sw.t bj.tj, because a t in this position is preserved in Coptic, and would not have been omitted in cuneiform.J√ºrgen von Beckerath, Handbuch der √§gyptischen K√∂nigsnamen (1999), p. 16. Schenkel and Peust (2007)Peust, Carsten, ‚ÄúZur Bedeutung und Etymologie von nzw ‚ÄòK√∂nig‚Äô‚Äù in G√∂ttinger Miszellen (2007), 213, pp. 59-62 have also questioned the derivation of nswt from swt \\"sedge\\", considering the swt-graph to be a borrowed sound rather than the emblem of Upper Egypt. In this case, nsw(t)-bjt(j) would simply be a combination of two words meaning \\"king\\". Kahl (2008) attempts a symbolological interpretation of the \\"sedge\\" and the \\"bee\\" as representing Upper and Lower Egypt, respectively. According to Kahl, the \\"seal of the sprouting reed\\", reveals a \\"rather maternal and protecting function\\" of the king, and the \\"seal of the defensive bee\\" represents \\"a rather power and strength seeking character\\".Jochem Kahl: Nsw und Bit - Die Anf√§nge. In: Eva-Maria Engel, Vera M√ºller and others: Zeichen aus dem Sand: Streiflichter aus √Ñgyptens Geschichte zu Ehren von G√ºnter Dreyer (= Menes Series, vol. 5). Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 2008, , p. 315-340 The earliest instances of the use of bjt date back to the time period corresponding to queen Merneith's possible rule, between the reigns of Djet and Den in the mid First Dynasty.Kahl (2008:324). Honey was used in Ancient Egypt as food, medicine, table offering in temples and shrines and as an important trade ware.Gene Kritsky: The Quest for the Perfect Hive: A History of Innovation in Bee Culture. University Press, Oxford (UK) 2010, , p.13 Additionally, the bee sign might have had the meaning of \\"wealth, affluence\\". This might explain as to why the bjtj crest is used when describing offices that were responsible for economic duties such as the Khetemty-bity for \\"seal bearer of the bjtj- king\\".Kahl (2008:325-327). A military interpretation, depicting the bee in reference to its sting, has also been proposed. The strongest evidence supporting this conclusion comes from the pyramid texts of king Unas and Teti of the late Fifth and early Sixth Dynasty. In these texts, the goddess Nut is described as a \\"swarm of bees, encircling and devouring the king's enemy\\".Jochem Kahl: Nsw und Bit - Die Anf√§nge. In: Eva-Maria Engel, Vera M√ºller and others: Zeichen aus dem Sand: Streiflichter aus √Ñgyptens Geschichte zu Ehren von G√ºnter Dreyer (= Menes Series, vol. 5). Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 2008, , p. 338-340.  Use  Nswt-bjtj crest combined with the nbtj crest (top row; here: king Semerkhet of 1st dynasty). Later example of the nswt-bjtj crest, here introducing a cartouche name (Thutmose II) Three different uses for the nswt-bjtj group of signs are known. First, they represented the highest level of command, for the king himself as well for his subjects. Thus, every title of an official containing the nswt- or bjt signs gave the holder the highest executive authority. Examples of such titles are s·∏èÍú£wtj-bjtj and s·∏èÍú£wtj-nswt. Despite using the bjt and nswt group of signs, both titles actually mean \\"sealbearer of the king\\". However, when used separately and in mere economic contexts, the titles could have a more specific meaning, for example s·∏èÍú£wtj-bjtj can be read as \\"sealbearer of the king of Lower Egypt\\" and s·∏èÍú£wtj-nswt as \\"seal bearer of the king of Upper Egypt\\". A unique case seems to be the birth name of the Third Dynasty king Huni: his name contains the nswt crest beside the signs for ·∏•w meaning \\"utterance\\" or \\"appointment\\" or ·∏•wj for \\"smiting\\" or \\"beating\\". Secondly, both sign groups could be used either alone or together to designate the personal property of the pharaoh or an order of him. The former usage is similar to that of the hieroglyph of the sitting falcon while an example of the latter is found in a rock inscription in Sinai dating to the Second Dynasty. The inscription, which names the \\"administrator of the desert and general Ankhenity\\", further reads wpwt nswt meaning \\"[commissioned] by order of the nswt king\\". A similar factum is found in words describing royal actions. The word w·∏è nswt, for example, means \\"royal decree\\". A third symbolic and also practical meaning of nswt lies in its use to express and accentuate relationships in the royal family. Originally the nswt crest expressed a direct blood link with the pharaoh, for example in the titles sÍú£-nswt for \\"son of the king\\" and mwt-nswt for \\"mother of the king\\". At some point during the Fifth Dynasty however, the titles for son or daughter of the king became honorific and were given to high officials and courtiers alike. Indirect kinships and mere acquaintances with the king were expressed with titles such as smr-nswt meaning \\"friend/courtier of the king\\" and r·∏´-nswt for \\"favorite of the king\\". This kind of expression dates back to the First Dynasty, with the titles mry nsw, \\"beloved of the king\\", and Íú•n·∏´-mrr-nsw, \\"living for and beloved by the king\\", appearing during the reign of Djet. Both titles are rare and might point to elite positions held by the title bearers.Jochem Kahl: Nsw und Bit - Die Anf√§nge. in: Finally, similarly to the nswt crest, the bjt crest also expressed royal authority. For example, a \\"seal-bearer of the bjt-king\\" was - alongside the direct relatives of the king - the only one allowed to touch, count and seal the personal possessions of the pharaoh.Jochem Kahl: Nsw und Bit - Die Anf√§nge. In: When used single or combined together with other symbols, nswt and bjt received advanced meanings in Egyptian heraldry, especially when connected with administrative and/or economic institutions. The sign group pr-nswt, for example, meaning \\"house of the king\\", represented the royal household and/or the palace of the king.Jochem Kahl: Nsw und Bit. In: Semerkhet, the seventh ruler of the First Dynasty, introduced the famous Nebty name as a complementary counterpart to the nswt-bjtj crest. Semerkhet's predecessor, Anedjib, had introduced the nbwj name as a heraldic emendation. But nbwj (meaning \\"the two lords\\") seemed to include the wrong gender. Semerkhet seemed to seek for a \\"female\\" crest and thus changed the nbwj name into the nbtj name, the crest of the \\"Two Ladies\\" (Nekhbet and Wadjet). From Semerkhet to Nynetjer (the third ruler of the Second Dynasty), the nswt-bjtj crest appeared in pair with the Nebty name. Seth-Peribsen (possibly Nynetjer's direct successor) was the first to separate the crests and use the nswt-bjtj crest alone again. He used the nbtj crest separately, too, but peculiarly, the name \\"Peribsen\\" was used in all crests.  Introduction and history  The final form of the title nswt-bjtj was introduced during the reign of king Horus Den, the fifth ruler of the First Dynasty, and was then adopted by all subsequent kings. At the time of the introduction of the nswt-bjtj crest both groups were already in use separately. The single sign group nsw.t was already in use under king Djer, the third king of the dynasty and maybe even under king Hor-Aha, his predecessor. The sign group bj.t appeared slightly later, during the reign of Den. An interesting background is the symbolic implementation of nswt with the White Crown of Upper Egypt and bjt with the Red Crown of Lower Egypt. King Djedefre, the third ruler of the Fourth Dynasty, combined the nswt-bjtj crest for the first time with the title Sa-Rƒì (Egyptian: z»ù-rÀÅ \\"son of Rƒì\\"). This title followed the cartouche as an emendation of the birth name. King Neferirkare Kakai, the third ruler of the Fifth Dynasty, was the first who separated the nswt-bjtj- and the sa-r√™ crest and turned them into two different, independent names: nomen and prenomen. Now the title sa-r√™ introduced the new name and it was also placed in a cartouche. During later times, pharaohs often used both names, prenomen and nomen, in cartouches, which sometimes led to confusion amongst Egyptologists in the past. The reason for the confusion was differences between the royal names presented by the ancient historian Manetho and the Ramesside king lists, such as the Abydos King List, the Saqqara Table and the Turin Canon. Whilst Manetho referred to the nomen, the Ramesside king lists used the prenomen. Another reason is that many rulers of later periods used the cartouche versions of their nomen and prenomen separately in different inscriptions. Only in inscriptions that depict both names side by side is it obvious that the two names belong to the same king.Alan Henderson Gardiner: Egypt of the Pharaohs: An Introduction (= Galaxy books, vol. 165).

Only two LPs had been released under Williams' name during his lifetime, largely because singles were most valued in the country music business, but in the wake of his passing, demand for his work increased. As Colin Escott observed in his 2004 book Hank Williams: The Biography, \\"The emerging LP market was a godsend. MGM could endlessly repackage Hank's recordings, and [publishing company] Acuff-Rose could pitch his songs to other artists as LP filler.\\" While Hank Williams Sings (1951) and Moanin' the Blues (1952) had contained several non-charting B-sides dating back to Hank's earliest recordings with the label, Memorial Album featured many of his most recent hits singles.

On July 31, 1973 at 11:08 AM, while on an instrument landing system (ILS) instrument approach into Logan in low clouds and fog, the aircraft descended below the glidepath, struck a seawall and crashed, killing all 89 occupants; two people initially survived, but later died of their injuries. Aircraft and crew The DC-9-31, registration serial number 47075, was manufactured in September 1967 and had 14,639 flight hours at the time of the accident. The jetliner was one of the aircraft that Delta Air Lines acquired in their 1972 merger with Northeast Airlines, to whom the aircraft was originally delivered. The flight crew consisted of Captain John Streil (49) and First Officer Sidney Burrill (31). Captain Streil, a highly experienced pilot, had accumulated roughly 14,800 flight hours throughout his flying career. He had 17 years of experience as pilot-in-command and had been flying DC-9s since 1970, with 1,457 hours logged in them. First Officer Burrill was also an experienced airman, with just under 7,000 flight hours, including more than 200 hours on the DC-9. Occupying the cockpit jumpseat was a third pilot, Joseph Burrell (52), who was in training and was not yet qualified on the DC-9. Accident sequence The aircraft, flying at , had been vectored by Boston's approach control to intercept the final approach course to the ILS runway 4R approach at a 45 degree angle, about outside the outer marker. As it was later revealed, the controller was busy handling a potential collision conflict between two other aircraft, and therefore neglected to clear Flight 723 for the approach. The flight crew had to ask the controller for approach clearance, which was immediately given, but by that time‚Äîmore than a minute after the intercept vector had been issued‚Äîthey were high and fast and almost over the outer marker. The flight crew subsequently failed to stabilize the aircraft's descent rate and airspeed, descended below the glideslope and drifted left of the localizer course, hitting a seawall about to the right of the extended runway centerline, about short of the runway's displaced threshold. The aircraft was destroyed, killing 87 of its 89 occupants. One of the two survivors died after two hours, and the other, Leopold Chouinard, died of burn injuries on December 11, 1973; Chouinard is not listed by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) as an official Delta 723 fatality due to requirements in the Code of Federal Regulations which, in 1973, defined a crash fatality as taking place within 7 days of an accident; the rule was subsequently changed in 2018, such that death must occur within 30 days of a crash. The weather conditions at the time of the crash were partial obscuration and fog, with a ceiling of , 1/2 mile visibility and light winds. Runway visual range (RVR) was . Investigation The NTSB investigated the accident and was able to retrieve both the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and flight data recorder (FDR). The investigators concluded that, based on the retrieved flight data and simulations, the flight crew very likely operated the flight director improperly, inadvertently switching it into a \\"go around\\" mode during the final approach, instead of the appropriate approach mode. This caused confusion and additional pressure, and contributed to the unstablized approach and deviation from the glide path. According to the CVR, no altitude callouts were made by the crew during the final approach, as the aircraft descended below the glideslope and decision height, until it struck the seawall and crashed. The board determined the following probable cause for the accident: > ...the failure of the flightcrew to monitor altitude and to recognize > passage of the aircraft through the approach decision height during an > unstabilized precision approach conducted in rapidly changing meteorological > conditions. The unstabilized nature of the approach was due initially to the > aircraft's passing the outer marker above the glide slope at an excessive > airspeed and thereafter compounded by the flightcrew's preoccupation with > the questionable information presented by the flight director system. The > poor positioning of the flight for the approach was in part the result of > nonstandard air traffic control services.

Alcohol-induced respiratory reactions reflect the operation of different and often racially related mechanisms that differ from those of classical, allergen-induced asthma.  History  In 1973, Breslin et al. tested the effects of alcoholic beverage consumption on the respiratory symptoms of 11 asthmatic subjects who gave a history of asthma attacks following certain alcoholic beverages. In response to ingesting the type of beverage that the subjects reported to provoke their symptoms, six developed the asthmatic symptom of chest tightness, two developed a symptom often associated with asthma, rhinitis, and one subject developed both chest tightness and rhinitis. Symptoms developed almost immediately after ingestion, inhalation of fumes from the beverages did not precipitate symptoms, and bronchoconstriction in response to the ingestion was confirmed in the three patients evaluated by pulmonary function tests.Clin Allergy. 1973 Mar;3(1):71-82 The study suggested that these reactions were induced by non-alcoholic allergens that were contained in or contaminated the beverages. In 1978 a non-asthmatic female of Japanese descent with a history of moderately severe bronchoconstriction responses to various alcoholic beveragesAm Rev Respir Dis. 1978 Jul;118(1):135-9 and in 1981 an asthmatic Japanese male with a similar historyChest. 1981 Aug;80(2):167-73 beer or 95% pure ethanol were studied and found to develop bronchoconstriction after drinking apple juice but not after drinking apple juice per se; intravenous infusion or inhalation of ethanol also caused bronchospasm responses in the male subject. These studies suggested that alcohol itself caused the asthmatic symptoms triggered by alcoholic beverages. A subsequent study in 1986 found that 9 of 18 patients with a history of red wine-induced asthma symptoms showed bronchoconstriction in response to ingesting red wine; the response correlated positively with the amount of sulfur dioxide contained in the provocative wine.J Allergy Clin Immunol. 1986 Dec;78(6):1126- The study suggested that the reaction was not allergen-induced but rather triggered by sulfur dioxide, a sulfur dioxide-related agent, or an agent whose levels in alcohol beverages correlated positively with those of sulfur dioxide. Finally, a questionnaire survey of 366 asthmatic patients conducted in 2000 found that 33% reported asthma symptoms in response to alcoholic beverages; there was a significant association between wine-induced asthma and asthma triggered by sulfite-containing foods, by aspirin, and by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) other than aspirin.J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2000 Mar;105(3):462-7 The study suggested the salicylate-\\"contaminates\\" in wine may contribute to these responses. In other studies, D.P. Agarwal and colleagues associated race-based variations in the activity alcohol-metabolizing enzymes with the occurrence of alcohol flush reactions to alcohol and alcoholic beverages in certain Asian populations.Hum Genet. 1979 Oct 2;51(3):331-4Am J Hum Genet. 1983 Jul;35(4):769-72 This early work is the basis for further studies that have defined not only many alcohol-induced flush reactions but also many alcohol-induced respiratory reactions as due to racially associated genetic differences in alcohol-metabolizing enzymes.  In Asians  Alcohol-induced asthma reactions among Asians has been most thoroughly studied in those of native Japanese descent. In such individuals, the ingestion of virtually any alcoholic beverage or pure ethanol and, in some cases, the smelling ethanol fumes may be followed, typically within 1‚Äì30 minutes, by one or more of the following symptoms: an alcohol flush reaction (i.e. the \\"oriental flushing syndrome\\"), rapid heart rate, dizziness, light-headedness, urticaria, systemic dermatitis, rhinitis, and, in ~50% of individuals with a history of asthma, exacerbation of asthmatic bronchoconstriction and related symptoms,Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol. 2013 Dec;111(6):439-45. In extremely rare instances, asthmatic symptoms in response to alcoholic beverages may occur in the absence of a history of asthma and cardiovascular collapse, anaphylaxis, and even death may occur. These reactions appear due to a deficiency in the metabolism of the ethanol in the alcoholic beverage. Humans metabolize ethanol primarily through NAD-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) class I enzymes (i.e. ADH1A, ADH1B, and ADH1C) to acetaldehyde and then metabolize acetaldehyde primarily by NAD-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) to acetic acid.Ann Ist Super Sanita. 2006;42(1):8-16Proc Nutr Soc. 2004 Feb;63(1):49-63 Eastern Asians have a deficiency in acetaldehyde metabolism in a surprisingly high percentage (approaching 50%) of their populations. The deficiency has been most thoroughly investigated in native Japanese who have a variant ALDH2 allele termed glu487lys, ALDH2*2, or ALDH2*504lys which is a single nucleotide polymorphism allele encoding in its amino acid residue 487 (glutamic acid) rather than lysine; in the Japanese population, about 57% of individuals are homozygous for the normal allele (sometimes termed ALDH2*1), 40% are heterozygous for glu487lys, and 3% are homozygous for glu487lys.J Allergy Clin Immunol. 1998 May; 101(5):576-80 Since ALDH2 assembles and functions as a tetramer and since ALDH2 tetramers containing one or more glu487lys proteins are also essentially inactive, the glu487lys protein behaves as a dominant negative in inactivating the normal ALDH2 protein and individuals homozygous for glu487lys have undetectable while heterozygote individuals for glu487lys have little ALDH2 activity.Pharmacol Rev. 2012 Jul;64(3):520-39. In consequence, Japanese homozygous or, to a lesser extent, heterozygous for glu487lys metabolize ethanol to acetaldehyde normally but metabolize acetaldehyde poorly and are thereby susceptible to a set of adverse responses to ethanol and ethanol-containing beverages; these responses include the transient accumulation of acetaldehyde in blood and tissues; facial flushing urticaria, systemic dermatitis, and alcohol-induced respiratory reactions (i.e. rhinitis and, primarily in patients with a history of asthma, mild to moderately bronchoconstriction exacerbations of their asthmatic disease. These allergic reaction-like symptoms, which typically occur within 30‚Äì60 minutes of ingesting alcoholic beverages, do not appear to reflect the operation of classical IgE- or T cell-related allergen-induced reactions but rather are due, at least in large part, to the action of acetaldehyde in stimulating tissue mast cells and blood borne basophils to release histamine, the probable evoker of these symptoms.Hum Mol Genet. 2009 Feb 1;18(3):580-93. The percentages of glu487lys heterozygous plus homozygous genotypes are: ~35% in native Caboclo of Brazil, 30% in Chinese, 28% in Koreans, 11% in Thai people, 7% in Malaysians, 3% in natives of India, 3% in Hungarians, and 1% in Filipinos; percentages are essentially 0 in individuals of Native African descent, Caucasians of Western European descent, Turks, Australian Aborigines, Australians of Western European descent, Swedish Lapps, and Alaskan Eskimos.Hum Genet. 1992 Jan;88(3):344-6. While the prevalence of flushing reactions is high in those non-Japanese populations that have a high prevalence of the glu487lys genotype, the percentages of these non-Japanese individuals with the glu487lys allele who experience respiratory symptoms, particularly asthmatic exacerbations, has yet to be defined. Alcohol-induced respiratory symptoms result from a wide range of interacting genetic, metabolic, environmental, and social factorsAnn Ist Super Sanita. 2006;42(1):8-16. ReviewNeurosci Biobehav Rev. 2007;31(2):221-9. Epub 2006 Sep 5> These interacting factors are likely to vary from one nationality group to another and thereby alter, perhaps dramatically, the phenotype produced by the glu487lys allele: the alcohol-induce reactions of Japanese with the glu487lys allele may not be good predictors of those occurring in other nationality groups. \\"Social factors\\", despite claims made by social constructionists, have no impact on a genetic aldehyde dehydrogenase deficiency. In non-Asians The prevalence of ethanol-induced allergic symptoms in non-Asian genotypes commonly ranges above 5% even though many of these non-Asian populations have no or very low levels of individuals bearing the glu487lys allele. These \\"ethanol reactors\\" may have other gene-based abnormalities that cause the accumulation of acetaldehyde following the ingestion of ethanol or ethanol- containing beverages. For example, the surveyed incidence of self-reported ethanol-induced flushing reactions in Scandinavians living in Copenhagen as well as Australians of European descent is about ~16% in individuals homozygous for the \\"normal\\" ADH1B gene but runs to ~23% in individuals with the ADH1-Arg48His Single-nucleotide polymorphism variant; in vitro, this variant metabolizes ethanol rapidly and, it is proposed but not proven, in humans forms acetaldehyde at levels exceeding ALDH2's acetaldehyde- metabolizing capacity.Int Arch Allergy Immunol. 2010;153(1):86-94. Presumably, then, acetaldehyde provokes the respiratory symptoms in a manner similar to that occurring in Asians with the glu487lys ALDH2 variant. In studies conducted in the USA and presumably therefore mainly on non-Asians, alcohol-induced rhinitis and exacerbations of asthma reactions are highly associated with aspirin-induced asthma reactions; more than half of individuals suffering from the aspirin-induced sensitivity reaction will also suffer alcohol-induced reactions.J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract. 2014 Mar- Apr;2(2):208-13.. It seems likely, although further study is needed, that most respiratory symptoms induced by alcoholic beverages, particular wines and beers, occurring in non-Asian individuals are due to true allergic responses to the allergens that are part of, or contaminate, these drinks. Diagnosis Diagnosis of alcohol-induced respiratory symptoms can be strongly suggested on the bases of survey questionnaires.Clin Exp Allergy. 2008 Jan;38(1):145-51 Questionnaires can be devised to determine the specific types of alcoholic beverages eliciting reactions; reactions evoked by one or only a few but not other types of alcoholic beverage, particularly when the offending beverage(s) is wine and/or beer, suggest that the reactions are due to classical allergic reaction to allergens in the beverage; reactions to all or most types of alcoholic beverages favors a genetic (i.e. acetaldehyde-induce) basis. Further differentiation between these two causes can be tested under medical supervision be determining if ingestion of a water-diluted pure ethanol solution elicits reactions or if an offending alcoholic beverage but not the same beverage without ethanol elicits reactions. Either result would favor an acetaldehyde-induced genetic basis for the reaction. Diagnosis of alcohol sensitivity due to the accumulation of acetaldehyde in individuals bearing the glu487lys ALDH2 allele can be made by measuring the diameter of the erythema (i.e. red) area developing under a 15 millimeter skin patch plaster soaked in 70% ethanol and applied for 48 hours (ethanol patch test); erythema of 15 millimeters is considered positive with a false positive ratio ([100 x {number of individuals with a positive patch test}]/{number of individuals with a normal ALDH2 genotype}) of 5.9% and a false negative ratio ([100 x {number of individuals with a negative patch test}]/{number of individuals with a glu487lys ALDH2 allele}) of 0%.J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2001 Nov;108(5):715-9 To resolve ambiguities in or replace the ethanol patch test for other reasons, a polymerase chain reaction using special primers and conditions can be used to directly detect the glu487lys ALDH2 genes.J Allergy Clin Immunol. 1998 May;101(5):576-80 For other causes of acetaldehyde-induced alcohol sensitivities, the ethanol patch test will need to be tested for verification of its acetaldehyde basis and appropriate polymerase chain reactions will likewise be needed to verify a genetic basis for symptoms. Diagnosis of alcohol sensitivity due to allergic reactivity to the allergens in alcoholic beverages can be confirmed by standard skin prick tests, skin patch tests, blood tests, challenge tests, and challenge/elimination tests as conducted for determining the allergen causing other classical allergic reactions (see allergy and Skin allergy tests.)  Treatment  Avoidance of ethanol is the safest, surest, and cheapest treatment. Indeed, surveys find a positive correlation between high incidences of glu487lys ALDH2 allele-related alcohol- induced respiratory reactions as well as other causes of these reactions and low levels of alcohol consumption, alcoholism, and alcohol-related diseases.Pathol Biol (Paris). 2001 Nov;49(9):703-9 Evidently, people suffering these reaction self-impose avoidance behavior. There is a proviso here: ethanol, at surprisingly high concentrations, is used as a solvent to dissolve many types of medicines and other ingredients. This pertains particularly to liquid cold medicines and mouthwashes. Ethanol avoidance includes avoiding the ingestion of and, depending on an individual's history, mouth washing with, such agents. Type H1 antagonists in the histamine antagonist family of drugs were tested in Japanese volunteers with alcohol-induced asthma (who presumably have glu487lys ALDH2 allele-associated asthma) and found to be completely effective in blocking bronchoconstriction responses to alcoholic beverages; these blockers, it is suggested, may be taken 1‚Äì2 hours before consumption of alcohol beverages as a preventative of alcohol-induced respiratory reactions.Eur Respir J. 1995 Apr;8(4):619-23Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol. 1999 Apr;82(4):390-4 In the absence of specific studies on the prevention of classical alcohol induced rhinitis and asthma due to allergens in alcoholic beverages, see asthma section on Prevention and rhinitis section on Prevention of allergen-induced reactions. In the absence of specific studies on the treatment of acute alcohol-induced bronchoconstriction and rhinitis, treatment guidelines should probably follow those of their comparable allergen-induced classical allergic reactions (see asthma section on Treatment and rhinitis section on Treatment) but possibly favoring the testing of H1 antagonist anti- histamines as part of the initial protocol.

Its main street, Michigan Street, at forty- five feet is wider than the town's other streets and has been from its platting in 1835 a part of an improved thoroughfare, first the Michigan Road, later the Lincoln Highway and, finally, US 20. Two parallel railroads, Conrail and the electrically powered South Shore, run along the town's north edge at the bottom of the hill, beyond which still lies open farmland. This is largely true to the west and south as well, although in recent years commercial development has occurred at the western edge of town along US 20 at the county line, and some residential development to the south. Along US 20 to the east (toward South Bend) is a long line of ca. 1950 housing development, which until recently edged farmland between the highway and the railroads. Now much of this farmland is zoned industrial, owing largely to the construction less than away of the enormous I/N Tek steel mill, completed in 1990, and its subsidiary I/N Kote, in 1991. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs The district is the main commercial district on Michigan Street. History The town's location on one of the few main improved roads across the state had been enhanced in 1851 when the Lake Shore Railroad (later Lake Shore and Michigan Southern) laid down its tracks through New Carlisle at the bottom of the hill roughly paralleling the Michigan Road that was two to three blocks upwards to the south. In the late 1870s the line was absorbed by the New York Central system, and remained so until recent years, when it became Conrail. After the turn of the century, two interurban companies, the Chicago Lake Shore and South Bend Railway (later the Chicago South Shore and South Bend Railroad) and the Northern Indiana Railway served New Carlisle, running alongside the New York Central tracks. Ihe latter company failed during the Depression and its tracks were removed, but the venerable South Shore continues to this day. As the importance of the railroads and the interurbans began to be challenged by the rise of the automobile. New Carlisle's location on an improved road again contributed to its continuing prosperity. The Lincoln Highway, the first of the privately administered transcontinental roads to be routed in response to a rising public demand for better roads, crossed northern Indiana via Fort Wayne, South Bend, LaPorte, Valparaiso, and Schererville. Essentially completed in 1915, the Lincoln Highway passed through New Carlisle on Michigan Street, the old Michigan Road. In 1919 the newly formed State Highway Commission designated the Lincoln Highway as a \\"main market road,\\" preparatory to setting up Indiana's state highway system. In the 1920s the federal government laid the foundation for its highway network, and designated the route running through the top row of counties in northern Indiana, which included parts of the old Michigan Road from South Bend to Michigan City, as US 20. Many other small towns along the new highway, such as Rolling Prairie about five miles to the west, were bypassed in the 1920s and 1930s, but New Carlisle was spared, perhaps owing to the topographical difficulties any feasible bypass route would encounter.

He was one of the main editors of Het Parool, an illegal Dutch newspaper founded during World War II. Biography Before and during the war Nord studied political sciences in Paris, and from 1938 on worked as a reporter for the Dutch daily Het Vaderland. He had wanted to become a poet, but found himself, as he later wrote in his autobiography Achterwaarts (\\"Backwards\\", 1998), more suitable for work \\"in the background\\". With Menno ter Braak he translated Hermann Rauschning's Gespr√§che mit Hitler, which led to a charge of \\"insulting a friendly head of state\\", but before any trial could take place the Netherlands were already occupied by the Germans. During the occupation, Nord was one of the editors of the illegal newspaper Het Parool, working and becoming close friends with Wim van Norden and Simon Carmiggelt; the men and their families lived together in Amsterdam at Reguliersgracht 111, in the \\"nerve center\\" of Het Parool, never discovered by the Nazis. Nord noted later that the Sicherheitsdienst (the intelligence agency of the SS and the Nazi Party) was housed next door, and found that safe enough. After the war After the end of World War II he edited the paper's art section. When chief editor Gerrit Jan van Heuven Goedhart left, in 1950, he acted as the paper's temporary chief editor, not deeming himself good enough to become the permanent chief editor. He then became a correspondent in Paris. In 1987 he attended the two-month trial in Lyon at which war criminal Klaus Barbie was sentenced, and wrote about it in a series of articles for Vrij Nederland and a book, Klaus Barbie: een van ons (1989). He wrote extensively on the Netherlands during World War II, including an illustrated book on Amsterdam during the Dutch famine of 1944 (the Hongerwinter), and edited a catalog called Thank You, Canada for Expo 67 in Montreal, Quebec.

The reinforced concrete arched bridge, made from stone masonry, forms three semicircular arches each 17 m (56 ft) tall. It crosses the port with a total length of 60 m (200 ft). It was built in the XIXth century, during the construction of the Corniche of President John F. Kennedy. The cove was blocked off during the construction of the foundations in order to keep it dry.

It was classified as a historic monument on July 23, 2009. From 1998 to 2006, a large painted mural of the famous footballer from Marseille, Zinedine Zidane, was put up by Adidas over the valley with the annotation \\"Made in Marseille\\". This was then replaced by a Coca-Cola advert. In 2013, when Marseille was awarded the title of the European capital of culture, the artist JR revealed a poster of an unknown woman from Marseille (Annick Perrot-Bishop) as a nod to that of the famous footballer, in order to illustrate the opening of Marseille to the world. This portrait has in turn been replaced by an advert for a famous brand of sunglasses.
