The proposed project‚Äîwhich substantially exceeded existing height and zoning limits‚Äîmet with substantial neighborhood and city opposition, until Minto appealed to the Ontario Municipal Board and worked out a deal with the City of Toronto. Quantum is 37 storeys (413 ft) and was completed in 2007. Quantum 2 is 52 storeys (541 ft) and was completed in 2008. The initial conceptual design was done by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill; Zeidler Partnership Architects developed the design and completed the project. History The construction of the towers, the tallest in the neighbourhood, was controversial. In March 2000, the developer bought the land to be developed and submitted an application for the project in December of the same year, which included the plan for the two towers and demolition of a ten- storey building (below left).Yonge Street looking south from Eglinton Avenue, 1963. The former Ontario Health Insurance Plan building, visible on the left side of the image, was demolished and is now the site of the Minto Midtown residential complex. The project was greatly in excess of the existing height and density limits. However, chief planner was considering zoning changes to increase development in the area. The local ward councilor, Michael Walker, kicked the developer out of his office when approached with the proposal and remained steadfastly against the project. Walker had the backing of a number of neighborhood groups, especially the North Toronto Tenants Network. Other councilors were amenable to the proposal. After delays and the City's plans to reject the project, Minto appealed to the Ontario Municipal Board a pro- development board. Minto reached an agreement with city council, by reducing the height by several storeys, providing Can $1.2 Million for social housing, Can$200,000 for transit connections. The OMB Decision (No.1263) set a new standard for development. The buildings still sparked strong response from a community group named the North Toronto Tenants Network. The OMB ruled in favour of Minto. The debate over the towers proved central in the 2003 municipal election. Incumbent city councillor Anne Johnston had helped broker the compromise that approved the towers. She was opposed by Karen Stintz, who took a strong stand against the development and intensification. In a result that surprised many, longtime incumbent Johnston lost by 2,321 votes. LEED certification This development has achieved Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold certification, making it the largest multi- residential LEED certified condominium in North America in 2009.

Personal life  Priscilla Susan Bury was born in Rainhill, Liverpool. Her parents were Edward Dean and Bridgett (nee Tarleton) Falkner. She married Edward Bury (1794-1858), a noted railway engineer, on 4 March 1830. The couple had at least three sons, born between 1831 and 1835. Between 1852 and 1860 the family lived at Hillsborough Hall near Sheffield and later moved to Croft Lodge, Ambleside in the Lake District. In 1860 she published an account of her husband, Recollections of Edward Bury, Fellow of the Royal Society, Member of the institute of Civil Engineers, Member of the Smeatonian Society, Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, Fellow of the Royal Historic Society by his widow. By 1866 she had moved to Fairfield, Thornton Heath, Croydon where she died of bronchitis and cerebral congestion on 8 March 1872. Artistic work Although she was not trained as a botanist or commissioned as a professional artist, she was the author of several artistic and scientific plant illustrations She began to draw plants from the glasshouse at her family home 'Fairfield', and by 1829 had enough studies of lilies and allied plants for publication. The 1829 Drawings of lilies, as lithographs by Hullmandel, features her illustrations accompanied by short notes. This was modelled on a book, and its publicity materials, by William Roscoe. From 1831-1834, her drawings were published in A Selection of Hexandrian Plants. The engraving was entrusted to the Londoner Robert Havell, engraver of the John James Audubon (1785-1851) plates. The book was carried out in aquatint and the 350 plant drawings painted in part by hand. The subscribers to this large folio numbered only 79, mostly from the Lancashire region, Audubon being one of them. The book was described as \\"one of the most effective colour-plate folios of its period\\" by Wilfrid Jasper Walter Blunt in his The Art of Botanical Illustration. Her later work after 1836 consisted of eight plates for Maund and Henslow's The BotanistThe LuEsther T. Mertz Library and photographs of her drawings were included in Figures of Remarkable Forms of Polycystins, or Allied Organisms, in the Barbados Chalk deposit in 1860‚Äì1861, followed by new expanded editions in 1865 and 1869. The fossils had been collected by John Davy and prepared for microscopy by Christopher Johnson of Lancaster.

History The Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet began operating their first hospital in Eureka, California in 1919 in response to the Spanish Flu epidemic. The Order moved its mother house to Orange County in 1922. They acquired Fullerton General Hospital, a historic facility designed by Frederick Eley, in 1931, but it did not meet postwar standards for operation. The Sisters began raising the one million dollars estimated as necessary to build a new hospital. In 1953 a group of physicians, led by Ramiro Fernandez, M.D., met with the sisters to see about building a new hospital. It was Dr. Fernandez's wife, Emily, who suggested the name St. Jude, the patron saint of desperate situations. A businessman, Miles Sharkey, donated land in western Fullerton with the stipulation that it be used to build a hospital. Of the acquired by the Sisters, the first was deeded to them for $10. On November 24, 1953, the hilltop property on which St. Jude Hospital was later built was blessed and dedicated. St. Jude's Hospital was publicly dedicated on May 11, 1957, with 2000 spectators in attendance as well as dignitaries including Congressman James B. Utt and Cardinal James McIntyre, Archbishop of Los Angeles.

Family His father was Louis de la Chambre, vicomte de Maurienne. His mother (Louis' second wife) was Anne de la Tour, daughter of Bertrand de la Tour d' Auvergne, Comte de Boulogne; she was the widow of Alexander Stuart, Duke of Albany, son of King James II of Scotland. He had a full brother, Jean Comte de la Chambre, and a half-sister, Fran√ßoise, who married Gabriel de Seyssel, Seigneur d'Aix. Abbot of Corbie Dom Philippe, brother of the Comte de la Chambre of Savoy, a monk of Cluny, was elected abbot of Corbie on 4 May 1523, on the authority of Pope Clement VII, and he took possession on 14 November. At the same time the Archbishop of Reims, Robert de L√©noncourt, appointed a monk to the position of abbot. The monk resigned his rights to the Cardinal de Bourbon. Dom Philippe was willing to exchange Corbie with the Cardinal for the abbey of S. Amand, but the Pope refused to sanction the transaction on 9 December. On 27 April 1524, Philippe resigned and the Cardinal took possession by procurator, over the resistance of the monks of Corbie. Nonetheless the Cardinal solemnly entered Corbie on 6 October 1524. Philippe sued and won his case on 10 October 1528. He was given the abbatial blessing in Paris by the Bishop of Terouanne, and took possession of Corbie by proxy on 5 November 1528; he took possession in person on 5 December. Cardinal In a Consistory on 7 November 1533 at Marseille, Philippe de la Chambre was created a Cardinal-priest by Pope Clement VII. He was one of four French churchmen who were elevated during the Pope's visit to France for the marriage of his niece to the son of King Francis I: (Jean Le Veneur, Odet de Coligny, Claude de Givry).Philippe Levillain, The Papacy: An Encyclopedia (2001), p. 345. This creation was a balance to the creation of thirteen cardinals at Bologna in 1530‚Äì1533, many of whom were subjects of the Emperor Charles V. On 10 November he was assigned the titulus of San Martino ai Monti. He was transferred to the titulus of Santa Prassede on 23 March 1541, and to Santa Maria in Trastevere on 15 February 1542. Cardinal de la Chambre took part in the Conclave of 1534, which followed the death of Pope Clement VII who died on 25 September 1534.Gulik and Eubel, p. 22 n. 1. Eubel incorrectly lists Claes and Spinola as absent. The Conclave opened on 11 October, and reached a decision on 11 October without any balloting. Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, the Dean of the College of Cardinals, was elected by \\"inspiration\\", and his election was duly recorded by the Masters of Ceremonies. Nonetheless, next morning a written ballot was taken, and Farnese was elected unanimously.Petruccelli, pp. 7-8. De la Chambre's active participation was minimal. The Cardinal was Apostolic Administrator of the diocese of Belley from 8 January 1535 until 24 May 1538, when he resigned in favor of his nephew, Antoine de la Chambre, who required a dispensation because he was below the canonical minimum age for being a bishop.Gulik and Eubel, pp. 130-131. Cardinal de la Chambre was promoted Bishop of Frascati (Tusculum) on 24 September 1543, in succession to Cardinal Marino de Grimanis, who had been elevated to Bishop of Porto.Gulik and Eubel, p. 59. On 19 July 1546 the Cardinal de Boulogne was named Apostolic Administrator of the diocese of Quimper, which he held until his death in 1550. He was succeeded as Administrator by Cardinal Nicolas Caetani de Sermoneta, who held the diocese until 1660, when Fran√ßois de la Tour was appointed Bishop.Gulik and Eubel, pp. 178-179. Conclave of 1549-1550 Pope Paul III died suddenly on 10 November 1549. The Novendiales (nine days of mourning) should have begun on 12 November, but the beginning was delayed until the 19th; they concluded on 28 November. The French cardinals had asked for extra time for their electors to arrive, and circumstances worked to give them the time. The Conclave to elect Pope Paul's successor was finally locked up in the evening of 30 November, but the first scrutiny (vote) did not take place until 4 December. The leaders in the ballot were Reginald Pole, Juan √Ålvarez de Toledo, OP, and Francesco Sfondrato. The influence of Charles V was much in evidence. But on 12 December five French cardinals appeared: Guise, du Bellay, Vendome, Chastillon and Tournon. Cardinal de Guise immediately took charge and plunged into negotiations, especially with Cardinal Farnese, who held the balance between the Imperialists and the French.Petruccelli, pp. 32-35, 39, 47, and 48. On 18 December the leaders in the scrutiny were: Pole, Carafa, Giovanni Morone, and Marcello Cervini. On 29 December Cardinals Georges d'Amboise and Philippe de la Chambre finally entered Conclave. On 14 January Cardinal Louis de Bourbon- Vend√¥me finally appeared, but Cardinal Philippe de la Chambre had left the Conclave due to illness. On 15 January Cardinal Morone's votes reached 26 votes, but he could not attract any additional votes; his candidacy was at an end. On 17 January there were 13 votes for Morone, 21 for Pole and 22 for Carafa. Carafa and Pole were excluding each other, each having enough votes to prevent the other from reaching the canonically necessary two-thirds of the votes. Neither would be pope. In the evening of 7/8 February 1550 the cardinals finally settled on Cardinal Giovanni Maria Ciocchi del Monte, the least objectionable of the surviving candidates.Petruccelli, pp. 56-61. Philippe de la Chambre was back in the Conclave in time to cast his vote for del Monte, who chose the throne name Julius III.J. P. Adams, Sede Vacante 1559. Retrieved: 2016-04-25. Death Cardinal Philippe de la Chambre died in Rome on 21 February 1550,according to Gulik and Eubel, p. 22; or on 23 April 1550, Gallia christiana X, p. 1287. having resigned Corbie to his nephew Sebastien de la Chambre. He was interred in the church of Santissima Trinit√† dei Monte. Misconceptions It is often repeated in the older literature that Philippe de la Chambre was Bishop of Boulogne. There was no bishopric of Boulogne in his lifetime. Boulogne was part of the diocese of Therouanne. Therouanne was destroyed in the wars of religion, and the diocese was restructured and renamed the Diocese of Boulogne in 1566.David M. Cheney, Catholic-Herarchy:Diocese of Boulogne (-Sur-Mer) Philippe de la Chambre was not Bishop of Therouanne (Morinensis) either.Cf. Gulik and Eubel. pp. 250-251. Gallia christiana Volume 10 (Paris 1751), p. 1571. It is also stated that Philippe's brother Jean was Duke of Albany. Their mother had been Duchess of Albany in her first marriage, to Alexander Stewart, Duke of Albany, but he had died in a tournament in 1485. John Stewart, their only son, became Duke of Albany. Philippe de la Chambre was the product of his mother's second marriage, and was the half-brother of John Stewart, but Philippe also had a full brother from his mother's second marriage named John (Jean), who was Comte de la Chambre.

It has about 3,100 inhabitants. The Holba brewery is located in the town. Administrative parts Villages of Hynƒçice nad Moravou, Pot≈Øƒçn√≠k, Vysok√© ≈Ωib≈ôidovice and ≈Ωleb are administrative parts of Hanu≈°ovice. Geography Hanu≈°ovice is situated at a confluence of rivers Morava and Brann√°. The town is in narrow valley surrounded by hills of Hanu≈°ovick√° vrchovina (Hanu≈°ovice Highlands). Hanu≈°ovice is the seat of Municipality with Commissioned Local Authority. Etymology The town's name is of German descent and consists of two parts. \\"Hanns Dorf\\" is equivalent to \\"John's village\\". Czech name is an approximate loan translation of the German original, using older Czech variation of the \\"John\\" name (\\"Hanu≈°\\") and the patronymic suffix \\"‚Äìovice\\". History In 1325, the town was owned by the Kol≈°tejn noble family. Most of Hanu≈°ovice was destroyed in the Hussite wars and the Czech-Hungary Wars of the 15th century. The town was repopulated by new settlers afterward. The settlers also established the village of Holba (a contraction of the German word halbseit (\\"half side\\"), as the village was on the left side of the road). Later, Hanu≈°ovice and Holba were united. In the 19th century, many factories were opened, but only breweries remain. Before the World War II, Hanu≈°ovice had 3,351 citizens; 556 were Czech, and the rest were German. During the World War II, the Gross Rosen concentration camp was located nearby, and Polish Jewish women had to work in factories. The English prisoners of war also worked there. After the war, the whole German population was expelled. Economy The unemployment rate was 5.4% in January 2020. The town is known for a brewery named Holba. Its production is about 200,000 hectoliters each year. Factory producing ball bearings is situated in south outskirt of the town. Small amphiboliteand gneiss quarry is located near a confluence of Morava River and Krup√° Creek. Other job opportunities are in a retail, forestry and bio agriculture. Transport A railway junction is not as important as used to be. A passenger transport has been cancelled on a railway to East Bohemia; the track is sporadically used for transporting cargo. A connection to Star√© Mƒõsto is unprofitable and survives with subsidy of Olomouc Region administration. Railway connection from ≈†umperk through Hanu≈°ovice to Jesen√≠k keeps its importance. Demographics Hanu≈°ovice is originally German town. Families of Czech officials and state railways employees immigrated during the interwar era because Germans were considered to be too disloyal to work in such strategic sectors such as government administration and logistics. The whole German population was expelled in 1946. Abandoned houses were settled by Czechs from other parts of Czech lands, Slovaks, Czech minorities from the Soviet Union, especially from Volhynia and Roma, mostly from Slovakia. The Slovak minority was fully assimilated during that time. Nowadays, Hanu≈°ovice is a Czech town with a small Roma community and some migrant workers from Ukraine.

Great Mound or Conus Survey of Marietta Earthworks, 1838 The conical Great Mound at Mound Cemetery is part of an Ohio Hopewell culture mound complex known as the Marietta Earthworks. Archaeologists estimate that it was built between 100 BC and 500 AD. Early European American settlers gave the structures Latin names. The complex includes the Sacra Via (meaning \\"sacred way\\"), three walled enclosures, the Quadranaou, Capitolium (meaning \\"capital\\") and at least two other additional platform mounds, and the Conus burial mound and its accompanying ditch and embankment. The complex was surveyed and drawn in 1838 by Samuel R. Curtis (at the time a civil engineer for the state of Ohio). This survey was incorrectly attributed to Charles Whittlesey by E. G. Squier and E.H.Davis in their Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley, published by the Smithsonian Institution in 1848. At the time the complex \\"included a large square enclosure surrounding four flat-topped pyramidal mounds, another smaller square, and a circular enclosure with a large burial mound at its center.\\" The Conus mound was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 23, 1973 as the Mound Cemetery Mound, site listing number 73001549.

They typically have narrow-band, nearly sinusoidal waveforms with amplitudes up to a few microbars, and wave periods near 5 seconds (0.2 hertz). Due to low atmospheric absorption at these low frequencies, microbaroms can propagate thousands of kilometers in the atmosphere, and can be readily detected by widely separated instruments on the Earth's surface. Microbaroms are a significant noise source that can potentially interfere with the detection of infrasound from nuclear explosions that is a goal of the International Monitoring System organized under the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (which has not entered into force). It is a particular problem for detecting low-yield tests in the one- kiloton range because the frequency spectra overlap. History The reason for the discovery of this phenomenon was an accident: the aerologists working at the marine hydrometeorological stations and watercrafts drew attention to the strange pain that a person experiences when approaching the surface of a standard meteorological probe (a balloon filled with hydrogen). During one of the expeditions, this effect was demonstrated to the Soviet academician V. V. Shuleikin by the chief meteorologist V. A. Berezkin. This phenomenon drew genuine interest among scientists; in order to study it, special equipment was designed to record powerful but low-frequency vibrations that are not audible to human ears. As a result of several series of experiments, the physical essence of this phenomenon was clarified and in 1935 when V.V. Shuleikin published his first work entirely devoted to the infrasonic nature of the ‚Äúvoice of the sea‚Äù. Microbaroms were first described in United States in 1939 by American seismologists Hugo Benioff and Beno Gutenberg at the California Institute of Technology at Pasadena, based on observations from an electromagnetic microbarograph, consisting of a wooden box with a low- frequency loudspeaker mounted on top. They noted their similarity to microseisms observed on seismographs, and correctly hypothesized that these signals were the result of low pressure systems in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. In 1945, Swiss geoscientist L. Saxer showed the first relationship of microbaroms with wave height in ocean storms and microbarom amplitudes. Following up on the theory of microseisms by M. S. Longuet-Higgins, Eric S. Posmentier proposed that the oscillations of the center of gravity of the air above the Ocean surface on which the standing waves appear were the source of microbaroms, explaining the doubling of the ocean wave frequency in the observed microbarom frequency. Microbaroms are now understood to be generated by the same mechanism that makes secondary microseisms. The first quantitatively correct theory of microbarom generation is due to L. M. Brekhovskikh who showed that it is the source of microseisms in the ocean that couples to the atmosphere. This explains that most of the acoustic energy propagates near the horizontal direction at the sea level. Theory Isolated traveling ocean surface gravity waves radiate only evanescent acoustic waves, and don't generate microbaroms. The interaction of two trains of surface waves of different frequencies and directions generates wave groups. For waves propagating almost in the same direction, this gives the usual sets of waves that travel at the group speed, which is slower than phase speed of water waves. For typical ocean waves with a period around 10 seconds, this group speed is close to 10 m/s. In the case of opposite propagation direction the groups travel at a much larger speed, which is now 2œÄ(f1 \\\\+ f2)/(k1 ‚àí k2) with k1 and k2 the wave numbers of the interacting water waves. For wave trains with a very small difference in frequency (and thus wave numbers), this pattern of wave groups may have the same horizontal velocity as acoustinc waves, more than 300 m/s, and will excite microbaroms. linear water waves, but the groups propagate much faster. (Animation) As far as seismic and acoustic waves are concerned, the motion of ocean waves in deep water is, to the leading order, equivalent to a pressure applied at the sea surface. This pressure is nearly equal to the water density times the wave orbital velocity squared. Because of this square, it is not the amplitude of the individual wave trains that matter (red and black lines in the figures) but the amplitude of the sum, the wave groups (blue line in figures). The ocean motion generated by this \\"equivalent pressure\\" is then transmitted to the atmosphere. If the wave groups travel faster than the sound speed, microbaroms are generated, with propagation directions closer to the vertical for the faster wave groups. Pressure field in the ocean and atmosphere associated to groups made by opposing wave trains. Left: short wave groups giving oblique propagation in the atmosphere. Right: long wave groups giving nearly vertical propagation in the atmosphere. Real ocean waves are composed of an infinite number of wave trains of all directions and frequencies, giving a broad range of acoustic waves. In practice, the transmission from the ocean to the atmosphere is strongest for angles around 0.5 degrees from the horizontal. For near-vertical propagation, the water depth may play an amplifying role as it does for microseisms. Acoustic power per solid angle radiated as microbarom by ocean waves. Left: log scale as a function of the elevation angle (zero is vertical). Right: linear scale in polar coordinates. The water depth is only important for those acoustic waves that have a propagation direction within 12¬∞ of the vertical at the sea surface There is always some energy propagating in the opposite direction. However, their energy may be extremely low. Significant microbarom generation only occurs when there is a significant of energy at the same frequency and in opposing directions. This is strongest when waves from different storms interact or in the lee of a storm which produce the required standing wave conditions, also known as the clapotis. When the ocean storm is a tropical cyclone, the microbaroms are not produced near the eye wall where wind speeds are greatest, but originate from the trailing edge of the storm where the storm generated waves interact with the ambient ocean swells.< Microbaroms may also be produced by standing waves created between two storms, or when an ocean swell is reflected at the shore. Waves with approximately 10-second periods are abundant in the open oceans, and correspond to the observed 0.2 Hz infrasonic spectral peak of microbaroms, because microbaroms exhibit frequencies twice that of the individual ocean waves. Studies have shown that the coupling produces propagating atmospheric waves only when non-linear terms are considered. Microbaroms are a form of persistent low-level atmospheric infrasound, generally between 0.1 and 0.5 Hz, that may be detected as coherent energy bursts or as a continuous oscillation. When the plane wave arrivals from a microbarom source are analyzed from a phased array of closely spaced microbarographs, the source azimuth is found to point toward the low-pressure center of the originating storm. When the waves are received at multiple distant sites from the same source, triangulation can confirm the source is near the center of an ocean storm. Microbaroms that propagate up to the lower thermosphere may be carried in an atmospheric waveguide, refracted back toward the surface from below 120 km and above 150 km altitudes, or dissipated at altitudes between 110 and 140 km. They may also be trapped near the surface in the lower troposphere by planetary boundary layer effects and surface winds, or they may be ducted in the stratosphere by upper-level winds and returned to the surface through refraction, diffraction or scattering. These tropospheric and stratospheric ducts are only generated along the dominant wind directions, may vary by time of day and season, and will not return the sound rays to the ground when the upper winds are light. The angle of incidence of the microbarom ray determines which of these propagation modes it experiences. Rays directed vertically toward the zenith are dissipated in the thermosphere, and are a significant source of heating in that layer of the upper atmosphere. At mid latitudes in typical summer conditions, rays between approximately 30 and 60 degrees from the vertical are reflected from altitudes above 125 km where the return signals are strongly attenuated first. Rays launched at shallower angles may be reflected from the upper stratosphere at approximately 45 km above the surface in mid-latitudes, or from 60‚Äì70 km in low latitudes.  Microbaroms and upper atmosphere  Atmospheric scientists have used these effects for inverse remote sensing of the upper atmosphere using microbaroms. Measuring the trace velocity of the reflected microbarom signal at the surface gives the propagation velocity at the reflection height, as long as the assumption that the speed of sound only varies along the vertical, and not over the horizontal, is valid. If the temperature at the reflection height can be estimated with sufficient precision, the speed of sound can be determined and subtracted from the trace velocity, giving the upper-level wind speed. One advantage of this method is the ability to measure continuously ‚Äì other methods that can only take instantaneous measurements may have their results distorted by short-term effects. Additional atmospheric information can be deduced from microbarom amplitude if the source intensity is known. Microbaroms are produced by upward directed energy transmitted from the ocean surface through the atmosphere. The downward directed energy is transmitted through the ocean to the sea floor, where it is coupled to the Earth's crust and transmitted as microseisms with the same frequency spectrum. However, unlike microbaroms, where the near vertical rays are not returned to the surface, only the near vertical rays in the ocean are coupled to the sea floor. By monitoring the amplitude of received microseisms from the same source using seismographs, information on the source amplitude can be derived. Because the solid earth provides a fixed reference frame, the transit time of the microseisms from the source is constant, and this provides a control for the variable transit time of the microbaroms through the moving atmosphere.

Paulin relocated to nearby New Orleans in his youth. He was active on the city's music scene since the 1920s and continued performing marching in long parades into the 1990s. His non-Union band gave many young musicians their start in playing professionally. Paulin had 13 children, six of whom played music professionally, starting in their father's band. His sons continue to have one of the city's better known brass bands, the Paulin Brothers Band. Son Rickey Paulin, a clarinet player, was displaced to Houston by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Paulin's band was featured in Always for Pleasure, an award-winning documentary about New Orleans culture. Paulin recorded in the early 1960s with Emile Barnes on Icon Records, and in 1980 his brass band made an LP released on Folkways.

The design is deliberate in allowing quick recognition of the information being communicated, in order to increase efficiency and clarity. These signals can be of many forms, from different coloured clothing for different teams, to focusing measures upon the size of the problem and not the size of the activity, to kanban, obeya and heijunka boxes and many other diverse examples. In The Toyota Way, it is also known as mieruka.  Purpose  Visual control methods aim to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of a process by making the steps in that process more visible. The theory behind visual control is that if something is clearly visible or in plain sight, it is easy to remember and keep at the forefront of the mind. Another aspect of visual control is that everyone is given the same visual cues and so are likely to have the same vantage point. There are many different techniques that are used to apply visual control in the workplace. Some companies use visual control as an organizational tool for materials. A clearly labeled storage board lets the employee know exactly where a tool belongs and what tools are missing from the display board. Another simple example of a common visual control is to have reminders posted on cubicle walls so that they remain in plain sight. Visual signs and signals communicate information that is needed to make effective decisions. These decisions may be safety oriented or they may give reminders as to what steps should be taken to resolve a problem. Most companies use visual controls in one degree or another, many of them not even realizing that the visual controls that they are making have a name and a function in the workplace. Whether it is recognized by the name of \\"visual control\\" or not, the fact is that replacing text or number with graphics makes a set of information easier to understand with only a glance, making it a more efficient way of communicating a message. It is also commonly used for internal team communication. Visual controls are designed to make the control and management of a company as simple as possible. This entails making problems, abnormalities, or deviations from standards visible to everyone. When these deviations are visible and apparent to all, corrective action can be taken to immediately correct these problems. Visual controls are meant to display the operating or progress status of a given operation in an easy to see format and also to provide instruction and to convey information. A visual control system must have an action component associated with it in the event that the visually represented procedures are not being followed in the real production process. Therefore, visual controls must also have a component where immediate feedback is provided to workers.  Types  There are two groups and seven types of application in visual controls. Displays group and controls group. * A visual display group relates information and data to employees in the area. For example, charts showing the monthly revenues of the company or a graphic depicting a certain type of quality issue that group members should be aware of. Large scale, (typically 2x4m) examples of this are known as communications boards. Communication boards are large enough to contain several displays and allow teams of people to view at once. This supports team decision making and promotes a \\"shared vision\\". * A visual control group is intended to actually control or guide the action of the group members. Examples of controls are readily apparent in society: stop signs, handicap parking signs, no smoking signs, etc.  References   Further reading  Lean manufacturing ","title":"Visual control"},{"id":"14360931","text":"Marengo was a 74-gun ship of the line of the French Navy.

Harriet Lane Levy (29 March 1866‚Äì15 September 1950) is a California writer best known for her memoir, 920 O‚ÄôFarrell Street. Levy was also an avid art collector, a girlhood friend of Alice B. Toklas, and an acquaintance of Gertrude Stein. She was born into an upper-middle-class Jewish family and raised in San Francisco. From 1865-1869, her cousin, Albert A. Michelson (the first U.S. citizen to win a Nobel Prize for science), lived with her. The first part of her autobiography, 920 O‚ÄôFarrell Street, chronicles her childhood in an upper-middle-class San Francisco neighborhood. Additionally, young women such as Levy were expected to marry well-off men, which generated additional societal expectations. However, the intellectually inclined Levy was hesitant to marry early. Instead, she graduated from the University of California at Berkeley in 1886 and became a prominent writer for popular San Francisco publications, such as the San Francisco Call. She also wrote for The Wave with notable writers such as Jack London and Frank Norris. Another one of Levy‚Äôs passions was traveling. She visited Paris many times, the first being with her friends Michael (brother of Gertrude Stein) and Sarah Stein. She later returned to Paris with Toklas, in 1907, living with her until she moved in with Gertrude Stein in 1910.(Stein, 1934, p. 105-07) In 1910, she resettled in San Francisco, at the age of 47, continuing to live independently by pursuing her intellectual interests (such as psychology and Christian Science) until her death in 1950. Connections to Gertrude Stein Levy was the subject of one of Gertrude Stein's early word portraits. Levy was the subject of much effort on the part of Toklas and Stein to return Levy to San Francisco sans Alice B. Toklas, her original traveling companion. (Stein, 1934, p. 105-07) Levy wrote a description of the famed Rousseau Banquet which was published in a limited edition of 30 copies, in 1985 as part of a UC Berkeley seminar: (discussion of the Levy posthumous publication appears at page 4 of this Charles Hobson catalog).

History Prebends Bridge was designed by George Nicholson and built from 1772 to 1778. The bridge was built on the instructions of the Dean of Durham and served as a private road for the Dean and Chapter of Durham, giving access from the south through the Watergate. It replaced a temporary bridge built after the footbridge, built in 1574, was swept away during a flood in 1771. The current bridge affords an excellent view of the cathedral and was built specifically with aesthetic considerations in mind - it was built slightly north of the prior bridge, at a wider part of the river, to improve the views available. Trees were planted along the riverbank to complete the Romantic picture. Forming part of the estate of Durham Cathedral, the bridge is a Grade 1 listed building and is situated below the Watergate at the end of South Bailey (with which it is in concurrence), just after St Cuthbert's Society. Although the bridge is wide enough for vehicles, it is mainly used as a footbridge as it only leads to the Riverside paths and up to a closed road barrier to South Bailey. The bridge was restored from 1955 to 1956. In autumn 2010 the bridge was temporarily reopened to road traffic under 3 tonnes while Saddler Street was closed because of extensive repaving works as part of the Heart of the City project, sponsored by Durham City Vision.

A statute of Henry II of England (1134‚Äì1159) ordered that all men capable of bearing arms should be inspected by the magistrates of each major town and city of England. Since there was no standing army, this was a way to find out how many men could fight in a war. The Court of Arraye was confirmed with the Statute of Winchester in 1285 which commanded that \\"every man between 15 years of age and 60 years shall be assessed and sworn to armour\\" according to their wealth and means. The statutes of Arraye were repealed in the reign of James I (1566‚Äì1625). After the English Civil War, when England had acquired a standing army, courts of Arraye were no longer necessary, and about the year 1680 they were abolished. The tradition of a Court of Arraye has continued in carnival form at Lichfield bower in Staffordshire, which has evolved from the procession that the men took after being inspected.

It is a four color, high contrast disruptive pattern with irregular markings in sand, brown, green and black. It is also known unofficially by its colloquial moniker of \\"M81\\", though this term was not officially used by the U.S. military.  Development and history  The woodland pattern is nearly identical to highland ERDL, only differing in that it is printed from an enlargement of the original. The woodland pattern was enlarged and the borders of the splotches were re-drawn to make them less regular. Part of the earlier pattern was left off the later pattern because the enlargement made them no longer fit on the width of the bolt of cloth. The pattern does not repeat horizontally across the width of the bolt, but only vertically along its length. The effect of enlarging the pattern was to make the pattern more visible at a distance, avoiding \\"blobbing\\", where smaller areas of color seem to blend into larger blobs. This also gave the pattern a higher contrast, making it stand out more sharply at close distances and defeating the camouflage effect at closer range. Digital and Flecktarn camouflage patterns resolve this problem by using a range of blob sizes to give a similar effect whatever the distance. These changes reflected a shift in the tactical focus of the United States military from fighting an extremely close-range war such as the one in South Vietnam to a longer-range one such as on the fields of Europe.https://www.stripes.com/news/making-a-21st-century-us-military-uniform- every-branch-can-wear-1.543762  Usage  U.S. Army National Guardsmen on an exercise in 2000 while wearing Woodland BDUs and PASGT helmets  U.S. Army  In the U.S. Army, the woodland-patterned Battle Dress Uniform was replaced by the digital Universal Camouflage Pattern (UCP) found on the Army Combat Uniform, introduced in 2004.

The long gun was known for its increased range and improved mobility in comparison to its larger precursors. This allowed the long gun to establish itself as the best form of artillery to pursue an enemy. In informal usage, the length was combined with the weight of shot, yielding terms like \\"long nines\\", referring to full-length, 9-pounder guns. Firing a Long Gun Cannons are fired through a laborious process that involves the help of many people. It begins by cleaning out the barrel of the cannon with a wet swab. This helps to ensure that any left over embers from the last firing are extinguished before the gunpowder is put in. Once the barrel is clean, the gunpowder is put into the base of the cannon, either loosely or in cloth bags. A piece of cloth or rope is put in after the gunpowder to assure that it stays tightly packed. The cannonball follows and is topped off with a piece of wool or cotton. This secondary piece of cotton helps to keep the cannonball in place and secure with the explosives. Long guns, being extremely heavy when fully loaded and ready to fire, had to be moved into position after being loaded. This typically took the full effort from the group of men attempting to transport it. The cannon is then pushed forward until it is in full contact with the side of the ship, and the barrel is pointed through the gun port. Once in position, a small hole in the back of the cannon is lined with a small amount of gunpowder. This process is called priming. From there, the cannon operator stood back from the cannon and held a string until the cannon was lined up with the enemy's ship. Once aimed in the right direction, the operator will pull the lanyard in order to fire the gun.Rodger, Nicholas (2004). The Command of the Ocean:A Naval History of Britain 1649-1815. Penguin Books. p. 420. . The gun could typically only be fired two to three times in five minutes, so it was important that it hit its target. British Gun Specifications  Size Regulation Naval long guns, or long nines were originally made in only two sizes, eight feet or nine feet. This was set by the Board of Ordnance in 1703. In the early 1700s, long guns started to dwindle in usage, but came back to prominence in 1761 when the Board of Ordnance changed its primary restriction of the size of long nines. The new protocol for manufacturing long guns included five lengths that ranged from seven feet to nine feet in length. The size of the gun often depended on the size of the ship that carried it, and how many of the guns the ship was to carry. In 1782, another change was made to the design of the long nine; it could be manufactured at a length of nine feet and six inches. Ammunition The ammunition used in the naval long guns did not offer as much variety as the size of the gun did. The only ammunition used was a simple nine pound cannonball, called a nine pounder. Nine pounders were the lightest of all cannon ammunition, and therefore allowed long nines to have increased range. This played a large part behind the purpose of the gun, which was to chase and pursue a fleeing enemy ship or fleet.

It was based at first at Tongland, Kirkcudbrightshire, and from 1923 at Heathall, Dumfries. It closed in 1928. History The company was very unusual in the world of car making in that it was largely run and staffed by women. For a while the cars were advertised as \\"a car made by ladies for others of their sex\\". The factory had originally been built as a wartime aero engine plant and Thomas Pullinger, the manager of Arrol-Johnston, was persuaded by his daughter Doroth√©e Pullinger to keep the factory open to provide local employment. She was made a director of the new enterprise and set up training courses and apprenticeships specifically for local women. The apprenticeships were to last for three rather than the usual five years as the girls were thought to be better at attending and quicker learners than boys. The factory was near the River Dee and a dam fitted with water turbines was built to provide power, supplemented by a steam engine. It also had two tennis courts on the roof. The cars were sturdy and straight forward and a one model policy was pursued with, at first, the 10/20, which was heavily influenced by the Fiat 501. It was not however a good time to launch a new car and only a few hundred were made before the Tongland factory was forced to close in 1923 and production moved to the parent works at Heathall which had plenty of spare capacity. The Tongland factory was later used to make silk. A second, larger, Galloway model, the 12, essentially an Arrol-Johnston, replaced the 10/20 in 1925 and remained in production until Arrol-Johnston itself closed in 1928 and Galloway Motors was formally wound up. In all a total of around 4000 Galloway cars were produced. Doroth√©e and her husband went on to set up using new American machinery White Services Laundries Limited in Croydon which soon had 17 shops.Georgine Clarsen, Pullinger, Doroth√©e Aurelie Marianne, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Model range *1920-1925 Galloway 10/20 straight-4 side valve *1925-1929 Galloway 12 1669 cc Straight-4 side valve Galloway 10/20 Designed by T. C. Pullinger from Darracq, Sunbeam and Humber with Fred Neale from Hillman, and heavily influenced by the Fiat 501, the 10/20 used a straight four, side valve engine of 1460 cc driving the rear wheels through either a three or four speed gearbox in unit with the engine. Suspension was by semi elliptic leaf springs at the front and quarter elliptic springs at the rear. However, the Galloway car had several adaptations to appeal to women drivers. Some, like the introduction of a rear-view mirror and more reliable engine, would be appreciated by all drivers. It was smaller and lighter with more storage space, and the raised seat gave the driver better sight-lines. The hand-brake was situated more conveniently near the driver's seat rather than under the dashboard. Galloway 12, 12/30 and 12/50 The engine for the 12 (later called the 12/30 and 12/50) was an Arrol-Johnston unit shared with that make's 12 hp model. On test by The Motor magazine a top speed of 51 mph was achieved. Four wheel brakes were fitted from 1926 when the name was changed from 12 to 12/30. The car was offered for between GBP325 and 360 depending on body which was expensive when compared with the likes of Morris and Austin.

Veronese, \\"Transfiguration\\" Francesco Pisani (1494 ‚Äì 28 June 1570) was an Italian Cardinal, born in Venice, the son of Alvise Pisani the noted banker, who was Procurator of S. Mark's, a member of the Council of Ten, and a Councilor of the Doge of Venice; and Cecilia Giustinian. He had a brother named Giovanni (Zuan), who also became Procurator of S. Marks' and was a Venetian diplomat; he was married to the sister of Doge Andrea Gritti. He was a strong supporter of the alliance between Venice, France and the Papacy, called the League of Cognac. He shared the imprisonment of Pope Clement VII in the Castel S. Angelo during the Sack of Rome and its aftermath. He spent eighteen months in exile in Naples while Clement made his peace with the Emperor Charles V. Early Benefices Nothing is known about his education. Francesco had been named a Protonotary Apostolic, the highest grade of monsignor, giving him the rank of a prelate. He was created a cardinal-deacon by Pope Leo X, in the Consistory of 1 July 1517, at the request of Doge Leonardo Loredan, and assigned the Deaconry of S. Teodoro.David M. Cheney, Catholic Hierarchy: Francesco Cardinal Pisani. Retrieved: 2016-04-04. The red hat is said to have cost his father 20,000 gold ducats and a ruby. The new cardinal was not in Rome at the time, and the red hat was brought to him in Venice; it was presented on Sunday, 23 August 1517.Sanuto, XXIV, pp. 503-504. On 27 August 1518, the Venetian Council voted to give possession of the Benedictine abbey of S. Stefano di Spalato, on the death of its abbot, to Cardinal Pisani.Sanuto (1889), XXV, 680. Pisani was appointed Bishop of Padua on 8 August 1524.Guilelmus van Gulik & Conradus Eubel, Hierarchia catholica medii et recentioris aevi III, edition altera (Monasterii 1923), p. 257. In 1526, during the invasion of the city of Rome on 20-21 September, led by Cardinal Pompeo Colonna, Pisani sheltered the Venetian Ambassador in the Palazzo Venezia.Sanuto (1895), XLII, p. 690, 701-702. Giuseppe Trebbi, \\"Pisani, Francesco\\", Dizionario biografico degli Italiani Volume 84 (2015). On 28 September 1526, he was named Administrator of the diocese of Citt√† Nova (Aemonensis, in Istria), which he finally resigned in 1535.Gulik-Eubel, p. 96. Sanuto, XLIII, p. 86. Sack of Rome On 27 February 1527, Cardinal Pisani was granted the Deaconry of S. Maria in Porticu.Gulik-Eubel, p. 75. He was promoted Cardinal-Deacon of San Marco, the traditional Venetian church in Rome, which is normally the titulus of a cardinal-priest, on 3 May 1527 by Pope Clement VII, just three days before the Sack of Rome began. He kept the Deaconry of S. Maria in Porticu in commendam.Gulik-Eubel, p. 65, 75. He held S. Maria in Porticu until 4 May 1541, when he was succeeded by Cardinal Juan Alvarez de Toledo. Two days later he was finally consecrated bishop.David M. Cheney, Catholic Hierarchy: Francesco Cardinal Pisani. Retrieved: 2016-04-04. On the morning of 6 May, as the assault on Rome began, Cardinal Pisani was at the Vatican Palace, to participate in the Pope's morning Mass. He was with the Pope to witness the assault, and fled with the Pope through the covered passage to the Castel S. Angelo.Sanuto (1897), XLVI, p. 130-132. He was Pope Clement's fellow prisoner in the Castel S. Angelo during the Sack of Rome in May 1527, and its aftermath. In September 1527, Giovanni (Zuan) Pisani, the brother of Cardinal Francesco, reported to the Signoria of Venice that he had word that the Pope had appointed his brother Archbishop of Vienne, and that the Pope was writing to the King of France for his consent.Sanuto (1897), XLVI, p. 56. Something apparently went wrong, and the appointment was never finalized; the Dean of the Cathedral of Vienne was administrator of the diocese from 7 February 1528 until 1554. Gulik-Eubel, p. 333. Pope Clement finally concluded a treaty (i.e. surrendered) to the Spanish at the end of November. At the beginning of December 1527, the two leaders of the French and Venetian factions in the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Pisani and Cardinal Trivulzio, were taken to Gaeta, and from there sent to Naples as hostages for the Pope's good behavior.Sanuto (1897), XLVI, p. 359, 363-365, 375. Cardinals Egidio, Cesi and Orsini were turned over to Cardinal Pompeo Colonna as hostages in the city; Colonna had been appointed Legate in Rome. The Pope was sent to Orvieto. It was reported to the Signoria of Venice that, on 2 December 1527 Cardinal Pisani freely renounced the See of Padua in favor of his nephew Alvise di Giovanni Pisani; the Signoria ordered the Rector of Padua to hand over the diocese either to Alvise (Luigi) Pisani or his Procurator.Sanuto (1897), XLVI, p. 549. The younger Alviso was only twelve years old, and his uncle the Cardinal continued to administer the diocese until his own death. On 27 January 1528, Cardinal Pisani was appointed Administrator of the diocese of Treviso.Gulik-Eubel, p. 309. Giorgio Cornaro was appointed Bishop on 20 February 1538. , pp. 15, 23-28, 30, 35, 45-49, 58-69. Nonetheless, Cardinal Francesco was a hostage for the good behavior of the Pope, being kept in Naples for eighteen months.Cardella, p. 69. Pisani's father, Alvise, was Commissary General of the French-Venetian armies fighting the Spanish in the Kingdom of Naples, where he died of disease in August 1528. After the Sack and Prison In 1529 Cardinal Pisani obtained the Deaconry of Sant' Agata in Suburra, probably in commendam, since he continued to style himself Cardinal Deacon of S. Marco. He held the Deaconry until 1545.David M. Cheney, Catholic- Hierarchy: Sant‚ÄôAgata de‚Äô Goti. Retrieved 2016-04-06. On 1 April 1535 Cardinal Francesco Pisano, Cardinal Deacon of S. Marco, who was possessor of the faculty of disposing of certain benefices in the Cathedrals of Padua and Treviso, which had been granted him by Popes Clement VII and Paul III, renounced those privileges in order to conform with the desire of the Signoria of Venice. In 1550 Cardinal Juan Alvarez de Toledo was promoted from the Deaconry of S. Maria in Porticu to the priestly titulus of S. Sisto. Consequently, the Deaconry of S. Maria in Porticu was given back to Cardinal Pisani in commendam, and he held it until he was promoted to the Cardinal- Bishopric of Albano.Gulik-Eubel, p. 75. Cardinal Pisani was nominated Administrator of the diocese of Narbonne by King Henri II of France, which was confirmed on 11 May 1551.Gulik-Eubel, p. 253. He was never the actual Bishop of Narbonne. Cardella (p. 68), who believed he was the Bishop, states that he obtained the diocese from Clement VII (1523-1534), and that he celebrated a provincial council there. Cardella's information comes from Denis Sammarthani, writing in Gallia christiana Volume VI (Paris 1646). Cardinal Protodeacon On 10 April 1555, as senior Cardinal Deacon, Cardinal Pisani crowned Pope Marcellus II (Cervini). Alphonsus Ciaconius (ed. J.

It was Wednesday in Holy Week, and therefore the ceremony was very simple. Cervini had been elected earlier on the same day, and immediately consecrated a bishop in the Cappella Paolina by the Bishop of Ostia, Cardinal Gian Pietro Carafa. Pope Marcellus II died during the night between April 30 and May 1, after a reign of only twenty-two days.J. P. Adams, Sede Vacante 1555. Retrieved: 2016-04-06. On 23 May 1555, Cardinal Gian Pietro Carafa was elected pope, and chose the name Paul IV.

Cardinal Bishop With his election to the Papacy, Cardinal Carafa left the See of Ostia vacant. It was filled by Cardinal Jean du Bellay. Bellay's seat at Porto was then filled by Cardinal Rodolfo Pio de Carpi, Bishop of Tusculum. The then vacant See of Tusculum was taken by Cardinal Juan √Ålvarez de Toledo, leaving his seat at Albano vacant. Cardinal Pisani was promoted Cardinal-bishop of Albano on 29 May 1555 by Pope Paul IV, then, on the death of Cardinal Alvarez, he was promoted Cardinal-bishop of Frascati (Tusculum) on 20 September 1557. Pius IV promoted him Cardinal-bishop of Porto e Santa Rufina on 18 May 1562 when Rodolfo Pio became Bishop of Ostia, and then Cardinal Pisani himself became Cardinal-bishop of Ostia on 12 May 1564.Gulik- Eubel, pp. 55-59. Cardinal Francesco Pisani participated as Bishop of Tusculum (Frascati) in the Conclave of 1559, an event that lasted nearly four months. It was notorious for the extreme laxity of security. On 5 December, the traditional rule that went back to Pope Gregory X (1274) was put into effect, limiting the cardinals to one dish at a meal was put into effect. Finally on Christmas Day, after the French and Spanish factions had both exhausted their resources, Cardinal Giovanni Angelo de' Medici was elected by acclamation, and a formal scrutiny was taken the next day. He chose to be called Pius IV.J. P. Adams, Sede Vacante 1559. Retrieved: 2016-04-06. On 10 June 1564, Pope Pius IV granted the Serene Republic of Venice the Palazzo of S.

Cardinal Pisani also took part in the Conclave of 1565-1566, this time as Dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals. He was the senior cardinal present, and the only cardinal who survived from the reign of Leo X. He was considered papabile, but he had no great following.

The Pisani family has a number of other villas named after them, including two by Andrea Palladio. He also commissioned an altarpiece for the Cathedral of Montagnana, Santa Maria Assunta, from Paolo Veronese, who was resident in Montagnana in 1555. The subject was the Transfiguration of Christ. Cardinal Pisani died in Rome, at his palazzo of S. Marco, on 28 June 1570, at the age of seventy-six, having been a cardinal for fifty-three years.Gulik-Eubel, p. 17, note 7.

For example, letters of the alphabet are the figurae that comprise a written word (signifier). In the semiotic language of Louis Hjelmslev, the coiner of this term, figurae serve only to distinguish elements (e.g. words) of the expression plane from each other, independently from the content plane. That is, the letter B, in the written word expression \\"bat\\", distinguishes \\"bat\\" from the word \\"sat\\", but neither B nor S bears meaning on its own. On the other hand, the constituents \\"foot\\" and \\"ball\\" both bear their own individual meanings, such that in the word \\"football\\", they cannot be considered figurae, although their individual letters can. Hjelmslev states that in a given language a \\"legion of signs\\" can be constructed with a \\"handful of figurae\\" through ever new arrangements of them. Linguists often use the terms phonemes and morphemes to refer, respectively, to the figurae and the signifiers of human languages. The division of the stream of speech into meaningful morphemes plus their further subdivision into meaningless elements is known as the double articulation. This duality of patterning of language is one of the few facts of language which most schools of linguistics can agree on. Occasionally, two morphemes can combine in an arbitrary way into a new morpheme, as in double names such as Mary-Alice, John-Paul, and Sarah- Jean, creating a kind of triple articulation. English speakers recognize Mary and Alice as parts of the name Mary-Alice, yet they understand that a woman of that name is in no way a combination of two other women. But neither are double given names typical of English, nor are surnames meaningless, since surnames usually identify a family relationship. As far as the combination of meaningful elements is concerned, there is much less agreement on what constitutes a syntagm (e.g. foot-ball, I-am) and whether any such syntax is universal. In theory, any sign could be composed of figurae, but care must be taken in distinguishing between the control-number-like function of figurae (as in the individual digits of a telephone extension) and the syntax-like function of meaning constituents (as in the area code of a full telephone number). For example, the symbols for the lines of the New York City subway system are composed of very elementary parts, e.g., letters or numbers and colors. While the assignment of letters to trains is arbitrary, and colors are arbitrarily assigned to various avenues in Manhattan, the combination of a letter or number and color is not arbitrary. That is, the symbol for the A Train has to be blue, since it runs along Eighth Avenue and all other Eighth Avenue train symbols are blue. Therefore, these colors cannot be considered figurae. On the other hand, the flags of a dozen countries consist of three horizontal bars, distinguished by their colors. It can be said that the colors and bars form a system of signifiers, consisting of the color figurae in a vertical order. For example, the flag of Russia is made up of a white, a blue, and a red bar, from top to bottom, whereas the flag of Estonia consists of a blue, a black and a white bar. From the point of view of a vexillologist, the colors have no meaning until they are grouped together and form the national symbol. Although white, blue and red may be \\"national colors\\" of Russia, combined in a different order they form the flag of Luxembourg. In reality, most national flags do not conform to the three-horizontal-band pattern. Furthermore, national flags vary somewhat in their horizontal and vertical proportions, and shades of colors can differ. Nevertheless, this logical analysis of flags into horizontal-color-bar figurae, though not exact, would probably be arrived at by almost anyone comparing these 12 national symbols. But it is also possible to over-analyze signs. For example, a television picture of a flag would consist of thousands of meaningless pixels. A recording of speech could be digitalized on a CD into millions of meaningless bits. Neither of these mechanical divisions could be considered figurae. It would seem, then, that since signs are defined as entities recognized by sentient beings (including many animal species), the constituents of signs, figurae, must also be easily recognizable as entities, even though they have no meaning in themselves. It probably requires lot of specialization or intelligence to mentally process figurae, since it demands not only the disassociation of the characteristics of a symbol with those of its referent, but this disassociation has to be repeated for each figura that comprises the arbitrary symbol. Figurae have not yet been recognized in any non-human natural communication system. Although the honeybee waggle dance may involve some arbitrary symbols, they are combined with non-arbitrary ones, much like the subway line symbols.

Biography Rijgersma became a physician in 1858, and practiced medicine in the small town of Jisp and on the island of Marken. In 1861 he married Maria Henriette Gr√§fing; they had seven children. When slavery was abolished in the Dutch colonies in 1863, he was one of six physicians appointed to provide medical care to the liberated slaves on the island of St. Martin in the Netherlands Antilles, where he served as government physician until his untimely death at the age of 42. There he collected many fossils, plants, birds, reptiles, fishes, mollusks, crustaceans and insects. Hendrik van Rijgersma was an excellent painter and left to posterity many, mostly unpublished, drawings, sketches and water colors of plants, shells and other subjects. His animal collections were sent by him to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, of which he was a corresponding member. The plants he sent to the Berlin herbarium were destroyed.

Comparison with Sony Œ±350 The Œ±700 had a lower pixel resolution than the later Œ±350 (12.4 vs. 14.2), and the Œ±350 included additional features (Live preview mode, automatic pop-up flash) at a lower price. However, the Œ±700 used a pentaprism viewfinder instead of a pentamirror, had a higher burst speed (5 frames per second vs 2.5), had a higher resolution LCD screen, magnesium alloy body, twin control dials, better environmental seals, dual flash media slots (CF and MS-DUO), a PC Sync socket, more autofocus points, a stronger autofocus motor, and HDMI output. The Œ±350's sensor was also a CCD sensor, as opposed to the Œ±700's Exmor CMOS sensor which granted the Œ±700 superior low-light performance.

The series lasted only one 26-episode season. The show was directed by Gary Nelson and Bob Sweeney.Television obscurities, The Baileys of Balboa. Retrieved on 2007-11-22 The show was primarily developed for the network because its president, James T. Aubrey, insisted that Gilligan's Island, which premiered the same season (and which he personally loathed), would have been a better show if it had centered on the exploits of a charter boat captain operating in a marina, and had his old friend Keefe Brasselle produce his version of the idea in order to prove his point. After Aubrey was fired from the network in February 1965 (amid charges of \\"conflict of interest\\" in scheduling the show and two other Brasselle productions without formal pilot episodes), The Baileys of Balboa fulfilled its 26-episode commitment, and was abruptly canceleddue, in part, to its poor ratings opposite ABC's highly successful twice-weekly soap opera, Peyton Place. Gilligan's Island continued for two more seasons. Overview The plot follows the Bailey family, who live at a beach resort, where Sam Bailey operates a charter boat at the local marina. The Baileys regularly get into conflicts with their wealthier neighbors. The show starred Paul Ford (Sam Bailey), Sterling Holloway (Buck Singleton), John Dehner (Commodore Cecil Wyntoon), Judy Carne (Barbara Wyntoon), Les Brown, Jr. (Jim Bailey), Clint Howard (Stanley), Howard Freeman (Langley) and Dorothy Green.

He is sometimes known under his pseudonym Nam Hong-chul, which he used to maintain his anonymity while in northeast China working to help fellow defectors reach South Korea. Biography Yoo lived in North Korea with his wife and two sons. After the death of his wife and younger son due to the ongoing North Korean famine, during which they ate nothing but grass for months, he chose to leave the country in 1998 with his remaining son Yoo Chul-min. While in China, he worked at odd jobs in construction and manual labour; eventually, he grew weary of living in fear of arrest and deportation to North Korea by Chinese police, and gave up his son to the custody of a family of ethnic Koreans with Chinese citizenship, hoping to give him a better life. He then smuggled himself out of the country. After his arrival in South Korea, he worked for a manufacturing company. His initial attempts to locate his son Chul-min failed, as Chul-min had changed his name and date of birth on his documents. With the assistance of defector aid organisation Durihana, he was able to locate his son, and make arrangements for people smugglers to bring him out of China to Mongolia and from there to Korea. Yoo's son died of exhaustion during the journey through the desert. Yoo's grief led him to convert to Christianity, and also to pledge to help smuggle fellow defectors out of China. He made it his first priority to help orphans travelling without their parents. In October 2007, he was arrested in a Chinese police operation aimed at dismantling the escape network, and threatened with repatriation to North Korea, despite his South Korean citizenship. He was released and deported to South Korea on 16 December.

They were secured under the Edinburgh Agreement in 1992 after a referendum for the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty was rejected by Danish voters, as a package of measure to assuage concerns raised during that referendum. The Danish governments has held two referendums on modifying its opt-outs. The first in 2000 rejected the adoption of the euro by 53.2% to 46.8% on a turnout of 87.6%. The second in 2015 rejected converting Denmark's current full opt- out on home and justice matters into a case-by-case opt-out similar to that currently held by Ireland and the United Kingdom by 53.1% to 46.9%. History Denmark obtained four opt-outs from the Maastricht Treaty following the treaty's initial rejection in a 1992 referendum. The opt-outs are outlined in the Edinburgh Agreement and concern the Economic and monetary union (EMU), the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), Justice and Home Affairs (then JHA, now PJCC) and the citizenship of the European Union. With these opt-outs the Danish people accepted the treaty in a second referendum held in 1993. The EMU opt-out means that Denmark is not obliged to participate in the third phase of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, that is, to replace the Danish krone with the euro. The abolition of the euro opt-out was put to a referendum in 2000 and was rejected. The CSDP opt-out originally meant Denmark would not be obliged to join the Western European Union (which originally handled the defence tasks of the EU). Now it means that Denmark does not participate in the European Union's foreign policy where defence is concerned. Hence it does not take part in decisions, does not act in that area and does not contribute troops to missions conducted under the auspices of the European Union.Motivations and consequences of the Danish CSDP opt-out (Revue Strat√©gique n. 91‚Äì92): http://www.stratisc.org/Strategique_91-92_TDM.htm The JHA opt-out exempts Denmark from certain areas of home affairs. Significant parts of these areas were transferred from the third European Union pillar to the first under the Amsterdam Treaty; Denmark's opt-outs from these areas were kept valid through additional protocols. Acts made under those powers are not binding on Denmark except for those relating to the Schengen Agreement, which are instead conducted on an intergovernmental basis with Denmark. The citizenship opt-out stated that European citizenship did not replace national citizenship; this opt-out was rendered meaningless when the Amsterdam Treaty adopted the same wording for all members. Under the Treaty of Lisbon, Denmark can change its opt-out from a complete opt-out to the case-by-case opt-in version applying to Ireland and the United Kingdom whenever they wish. The protocol governing this provision stipulates that if Denmark exercises this option, then it will be bound by the Schengen acquis under EU law rather than on an intergovernmental basis. Proposals to abolish the opt-outs Anders Fogh Rasmussen government One or more referendums on abolishing one or more the opt-outs were announced by Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen in his speech on 22 November 2007 after he won the 2007 parliamentary election. It was not announced whether the referendum would only offer a full repeal of all opt-outs, or a case-by-case choice, and no date was announced, except that it would be before the 2011 Danish parliamentary election. The V/K (Liberal- Conservative) government had been planning to hold a referendum on abolishing the opt-outs (or at least the euro opt-out) since at least 2004, following a favourable change in public opinion, but the discussions and controversy regarding the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe and the Treaty of Lisbon had delayed this. The referendum was originally expected to be held in the autumn of 2008Danish PM says possible autumn referendum on EU opt-outs ‚Äî EUbusiness.com ‚Äì business, legal and economic news and information from the European Union but following Ireland's rejection of the Treaty of Lisbon, Fogh Rasmussen stated that this would not happen. In early 2009, it was announced that Fogh Rasmussen expected to hold a referendum on Denmark joining the Eurozone in 2010, as he believed it was possible to meet the demands of the Euro-sceptic Socialist People's Party. Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen government Following the appointment of Anders Fogh Rasmussen as Secretary General of NATO in 2009, his successor, Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen, announced that the opt-outs would be put to a referendum \\"when the time is right\\", which was seen as an indication that he did not necessarily intend to proceed with a referendum. A month later, in May 2009, L√∏kke Rasmussen stated that he hoped at least a referendum on the common currency would take place before the parliamentary elections in 2011 so that Denmark could become \\"a full member of the European Union\\", and to give him a popular mandate in the negotiations over the Competitiveness Pact in the Summer of that year. The Prime Minister's suggestion was criticised by Jens Ladefoged Mortensen, a political scientist, who claimed that the time for a referendum was ill-chosen, pointing out that Denmark was set to hold general elections later that year. In November 2009 the leaders of the three largest opposition parties Helle Thorning-Schmidt, Villy S√∏vndal and Margrethe Vestager suggested that a referendum on abolishing the opt-outs concerning the Common Security and Defence Policy and the Justice and Home Affairs be held on 23 March 2010. Ultimately, no referendum was held and L√∏kke Rasmussen's coalition lost the election in the autumn of 2011. Helle Thorning-Schmidt government After the victory of the left-wing coalition under Thorning-Schmidt in the September 2011 elections, the new government announced that it planned to hold referendums on abolishing the defence opt-out and on either abolishing the justice opt-out or modifying it to a flexible opt-in like that of the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland to allow Denmark to participate in measures which it chooses. However, in June 2012 Thorning-Schmidt announced that she didn't anticipate holding a referendum before a certain amount of stability and order returned to the situation in Europe, possibly not before the end of the government's term, citing the \\"anxiety and uncertainty\\" surrounding the European project at the time. In August 2013, Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen, the leader of the opposition Venstre party proposed that a referendum on the opt-outs from EU defence and justice co-operation, as well as on the Unified Patent Court, leaving opt-outs from European citizenship and the euro, be held on the same date as the 2014 European election. The proposal was rejected by the Minister for European affairs, Nick H√¶kkerup, who argued that the timing was not right. In October 2014 Thorning-Schmidt announced plans to hold a referendum on converting the inflexible opt-out on home and justice matters into a flexible opt-out following the next Danish general election due by September 2015, due to concerns that the opt-out would force Denmark to leave Europol. Several parties, including the two largest in parliament, the Social Democrats and Liberals, reached an agreement in December 2014 to hold the referendum following the upcoming election, but before the end of the first quarter of 2016, if they secured enough seats in the election. This was supplemented by an agreement in March 2015 amongst the parties that if the referendum is approved, Denmark would join 22 EU regulations it is currently not able to participate in, including the Rome Regulation. To join additional Regulations, the agreement requires either consensus amounts the parties to the agreement, or that the proposal is made public as part of the party's platform prior to a subsequent election. Second Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen government Following the election in June 2015, Venstre formed government with Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen again becoming Prime Minister. He committed to holding the referendum on converting the justice opt-out into an opt-in by Christmas 2015. On August 21, 2015, the Danish government announced that the referendum would be held on December 3, 2015. The government has also said it is planning on holding a referendum on abolishing its opt-out from the EU defence policy following the justice opt-out referendum. Danes rejected the proposal by a margin of 53.1% to 46.9%. In May 2019 Rasmussen again proposed a referendum on abolishing its defence opt-out during the following parliamentary term, though his party lost the general election the following month. Opinion polls A poll from early June 2008 saw a clear majority in favour of repealing the defence and judicial issues opt-outs, a very close race regarding the euro and a clear majority against repealing the citizenship opt-outs. Following an increase in support for abolishing the opt-outs, support dropped in mid-May 2009; in January 2009, 49.8% were in favour of having the Euro as Danish currency, dropping to 45.2% against and 43.7% in favour in May 2009. Support for abolishing opt-outs on legal and defence cooperation has also dwindled to equal numbers pro and against. Afterwards support for abolishing the opt-outs increased again. In October 2009, there was a majority in favour of abolishing each of the four opt-outs, the only difference being in the size of majority: * Absolute majorities were in favour of adopting the euro (50% in favour, 43% opposed, 7% no opinion) and participating in a Common European Defence policy (66% in favour, 21% opposed, 13% no opinion). * There were relative majorities in favour of judicial cooperation (47% in favour, 35% opposed, 18% no opinion) and EU citizenship (40% in favour, 30% opposed, 30% no opinion). * When asked, how they would vote when they had to decide about all four opt-outs in a package, a relative majority of 42% would vote in favour of abolishing the opt-outs, 37% would vote in favour of keeping the opt-outs and 21% expressed no opinion. Following the European sovereign debt crisis, particularly the financial market turmoil of 2011, support for the euro dropped dramatically with a poll showing 61% of respondents opposing adoption of the euro, with 37% in favour.

In most of its range, where no other species of the genus occur, this plant is often simply called baccharis. Classification Flowering Baccharis halimifolia in late autumn in central North Carolina Baccharis halimifola was first described and named by Carl Linnaeus in his Species Plantarum, published in 1753. No subspecies or varieties are recognized within the species. This species is the northernmost member of the large Western Hemisphere genus Baccharis in the aster family (Asteraceae). Senecio arborescens, a Neotropical species, was confused with Baccharis halimifolia in the past. Description Late fall flowerheads, with purple sheath around silky white pappus Carl Linnaeus, who first named and described Baccharis halimifolia (1775 portrait by Alexander Roslin) Baccharis halimifolia is a fall-flowering shrub growing to about 12 ft (4 m) high and comparably wide, or occasionally a small tree. Its simple, alternate, thick, egg-shaped to rhombic leaves mostly have coarse teeth, with the uppermost leaves entire. These fall-flowering Baccharis plants are dioecious, with male and female flowers on separate individuals. Their flowers are borne in numerous small, compact heads in large leafy terminal inflorescences, with the snowy-white, cotton-like female flower-heads showy and conspicuous at a distance. The species is sometimes confused with the marsh-elder (Iva frutescens), with which it often co-occurs, but the Baccharis has its leaves alternate, while those of the Iva are opposite. Ecology Baccharis halimifolia, usually found in wetlands, is unusually salt-tolerant, and often found along salty or brackish shores of marshes and estuaries, and the inland shores of coastal barrier islands. In Florida, it is also found along ditches, in old fields, and in other disturbed areas. Other habitats in the northeastern United States include freshwater tidal marshes and open woods and thickets along the seacoast. The flowers produce abundant nectar that attracts various butterflies, including the monarch (Danaus plexippus). These dense shrubs also provide wildlife food and cover. Invasiveness Leaves, and long thin seeds with fluffy hairs for windblown dispersal In Australia, B. halimifolia is an invasive species along the coast of southern Queensland and New South Wales. As biological control the rust fungus Puccinia evadens is used.Jim Cullen, Mic Julien, Rachel McFadyen: Biological Control of Weeds in Australia. Csiro Publishing, 2012. Seite 91f The species has also become naturalized in Europe and in New Zealand. In the northeastern United States, the species has become common well inland of the shrub's natural range along various major highways where road salt is heavily used, sometimes forming conspicuous displays when flowering in the fall, as along I-95 in Howard County, Maryland. Toxicity The seeds of Baccharis halimifolia are toxic to humans. Uses Baccharis halimifolia is occasionally cultivated, useful as a hedge or border as well as a specimen plant. In southern Louisiana, it has been traditionally used as a medicine to treat inflamed kidneys and fever.http://www.botanical.pbrc.edu/pdf/Brassieur%20Medicinal%20Plants.pdf References Other references Niering, William, Olmstead, Nancy, National Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Wildflowers Eastern Region, 1995, , p. 367 External links Trees, Shrubs, and Woody Vines of North Carolina: Groundseltree, Eastern Baccharis (Baccharis halimifolia) halimifolia Flora of North America Plants described in 1753 Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus Medicinal plants of North America ","title":"Baccharis halimifolia"},{"id":"14362143","text":"Donald E. Williams Jr. (born July 1, 1957) was first elected to the Connecticut General Assembly in a special election in 1993. Prior to his service in the State Senate, he served two terms as the First Selectman for the town of Thompson. In July 2004, Senator Williams was elected to serve as the President Pro Tempore, the highest-ranking legislator in the Connecticut General Assembly. He was reelected to this post five times, in 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, and 2013. He serves as the Chair of the Legislative Management Committee and Vice-Chair of the Executive and Legislative Nominations Committee. He is Co-Chair of the Barack Obama for President Connecticut Leadership Council. Legislative accomplishments Senator Williams has spearheaded a variety of initiatives in the areas of campaign finance reform, ethics reform, protection of children and environmental protection and preservation. As chairman of the Environment Committee he led the charge to clean up power plants (referred to as the ‚ÄúSooty Six‚Äù) that pollute Connecticut‚Äôs air. He also initiated efforts to preserve the state‚Äôs natural water resources, fishing and shellfish industry in Long Island Sound. He has also been recognized for his efforts to help protect Connecticut farmers. He has also served as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, where he authored legislation creating both the Office of the Child Advocate and the Office of the Victim Advocate in addition to his many efforts to prevent domestic violence. Shortly after his election in 1993 he authored legislation creating the first enterprise corridor zones in rural areas to help attract and retain jobs in northeastern Connecticut. This program allowed rural towns in need of economic development to utilize the same economic development benefits that had been provided in the past to certain urban centers. Moreover, he has composed legislation to reform the State Ethics Commission and helped implement sweeping reforms to the campaign finance system and state contracting process. Some of Williams' proposals were controversial and were not adopted. In 2006 he was criticized after proposing to regulate speech in political ads, which was considered an attack on the First Amendment. In 2005 he was able to provide millions of dollars to preserve farmland and open space, protect historic sites, and increase the supply of affordable housing in northeastern Connecticut. In 2006 he was at the forefront of legislation that banned the sale of soda and other unhealthy beverages in schools. That very same bill tripled the funding for schools to provide healthier alternatives for students. On the school nutrition bill he was aligned with Meriden Democrat Thomas Gaffey who also favored banning soda and snack food from Connecticut public schools. Many parents have derided this bill as the \\"cupcake bill\\" and consider it an affront to parental responsibility, as local schools have told children not to bring in sweets for birthday parties. In March 2008 New Haven schools enforced this law by suspending an eighth grader for selling a classmate Skittles. In May 2008 a principal in Greenwich was suspended in a dispute over bringing cupcakes to school. Williams is a strong supporter of higher education, including the UCONN 2000 and UCONN 21st Century initiatives that dramatically improved the buildings and campus of the University of Connecticut. In addition, he supported the CSU 2020 program that will provide the same support for the state university system. In approving the legislation, Governor M. Jodi Rell said, \\"If there is a crown jewel in this bonding bill, it is the program that will continue the glorious transformation of higher education in Connecticut. That transformation began with ‚ÄòUConn 2000‚Äô and continues today with ‚ÄòCSU 2020.‚Äô\\" The CSU bonding proposal was not without controversy, however. Governor Rell vetoed a bonding package which included $1 billion for the Connecticut state university system. Democrats failed to override the veto because Senator Joan Hartley, chairman of the higher education committee, believed the CSU bonding lacked accountability. Williams then threatened Hartley with political retaliation. After a revised bonding package passed, it was revealed that Williams' ally Thomas Gaffey had an undisclosed intimate relationship with the lobbyist for the CSU system. Williams then flatly denied an investigation into Gaffey's conduct was warranted. Gaffey pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations in January 2011 and resigned his seat. Professional career Senator Williams was the News and Public Affairs Director for WINY radio in Putnam, Connecticut, from 1980 to 1983. He practiced law at the firm of Boland, Saint Onge and Brouillard. He was also the Law Review Research Editor at the Washington and Lee University School of Law. He served on the Board of Directors on HealthNet, Inc., the Northeast Connecticut Chamber of Commerce, the Quinebaug Valley Youth and Family Services, as the Chair of the Northeast Economic Alliance, and as Chair of the Northeastern Connecticut Council of Governments.

Primarily a mountain walk, it runs over many of the highest and most scenically beautiful areas of Wales. It was pioneered in the 1960s and 1970s by walker Tony Drake, who later produced a guidebook of the walk.

Previous estimates were and of ascent using paper maps and counting contours in 2008, and and of ascent using Ordnance Survey's 'Getamap' website in 2012. The latest measurements of ascent take into account the extra ascent of undulations between plotted points and are, therefore, considerably greater than previous estimates and probably more accurate, though they are still subject to a margin of error. Following a number of changes to the route that are incorporated in the latest Cicerone guide, the main route has increased to approximately 479 km (298 miles) with a total ascent of 22,460 m (73,700 ft). The route The Cambrian Way is a mountain walking route from Cardiff to Conwy traversing much of the highest, wildest and most scenically beautiful parts of Wales. At the present time, it is an unofficial walk that was pioneered by the late Anthony John Drake MBE (Tony Drake) (25 January 1925 ‚Äì 7 March 2012). Originally conceived in 1967 with the intention of becoming a National Trail, the proposals floundered because of insurmountable opposition from landowners, farmers, county councils, national park authorities and the British Mountaineering Council. Rather than abandoning the project altogether, Drake realised that the route could be promoted as an unofficial walk provided that it followed a route along established rights of way or where the public had traditionally been allowed access, so in 1984 he published the first edition of his guidebook Cambrian Way - A Mountain Connoisseur's Walk. Further updated editions of the guidebook continued to be published, his last one being the 6th edition published in 2008. He continued unsuccessfully to campaign for official recognition of the walk throughout the rest of his life until ill health intervened a few years prior to his death in 2012. The 7th edition of the guide, updated by the newly formed Cambrian Way Trust, was in 2016. The route is only partially waymarked and requires advanced map reading and navigational experience in certain sections. The route is wholly within Wales, unlike the Offa's Dyke Path which follows the Wales-England border. Accommodation is scarce along some parts of the walk, so diversions, some quite long, are needed unless a tent and provisions are carried. In 2015, at the time that the Cambrian Way Trust was formed, working groups from Ramblers Cymru were in the process of surveying the whole of the route and throughout this process a number of route changes were agreed between the Trust and working groups to avoid some road walking and to take advantage of the most scenic routes. This was done in collaboration with the Brecon Beacons National Park Authority and the Snowdonia National Park Authority who made a number of suggestions of their own, in particular regarding bad weather alternative routes over the Rhinog Mountains. These changes were then incorporated in a new guidebook 'Walking The Cambrian Way' published in July 2019 by Cicerone. It traverses Wales from Cardiff Castle near the south coast to Conwy Castle on the north coast and is purposely routed over the highest upland and mountainous terrain including the Black Mountains, Central Beacons and Black Mountain (all within the Brecon Beacons National Park), the Cambrian Mountains, Cadair Idris, and Snowdon. Southern section The starting point of the route is at Cardiff Castle, chosen for its good transport links and in order for the walk to become a coast to coast route from South Wales to North Wales. Despite the first day of the walk lacking any mountains, it follows a pleasant ridgeway walk from Cwm Nofydd north of Rhiwbina along the Cefn Onn Ridge to Rudry before joining the open common ridges bordering on the Vale of Usk. The Brecon Beacons National Park is entered just north of Pontypool and open moorland followed to the Blorenge, thence by steep descent to the town of Abergavenny. After ascending Sugar Loaf a horseshoe shaped route follows the finest ridges of the Black Mountains via Capel-y-ffin to Crickhowell. There follows an east to west traverse of the elevated ridges of the Brecon Beacons including Pen y Fan, the highest point in South Wales at 886 m (2906 ft). The moorland continues to the Black Mountain range, also known as the Carmarthen Fans, the largest common in Wales, before dropping to Llanddeusant and field country to Llandovery. Central section From Llandovery, the route follows the attractive River Towy valley at Rhandirmwyn, a once busy metal mining area. The remote path up the Doethie valley leads to the Ty'n-y-cornel Youth Hostel, the most isolated hostel in Wales and officially a Dark Skies site. The route follows the western side of the wild moorland and forest area known as the Elenydd, which includes the gathering grounds of the Elan Valley Reservoirs which serve Birmingham. After rambling country around Devil's Bridge and Ponterwyd, the route crosses the exposed massif of Plynlimon, with opportunities to view the sources of the River Severn and the River Wye. The hamlet of Dylife, once the workplace of 2,000 miners, now only has a few houses and the Star Inn. A mixture of forest and sheep grazing land leads through the windfarm on Mynydd Cemmaes and so to Mallwyd and Dinas Mawddwy. Northern section From Dinas Mawddwy the route enters its northern and arguably toughest section through the Snowdonia National Park, crossing Cadair Idris before entering Barmouth before tackling the Rhinog Mountains which, given their remoteness and the rugged nature of walking, are the highlight of the whole route. The lack of accommodation and the slow going and distance means that this section is the most challenging for the walker. From Maentwrog the route goes over Cnicht to Beddgelert before going over the highest summit in Wales, Snowdon. A further steeper ascents takes the hiker over Glyder Fawr and Glyder Fach into the Ogwen Valley, before the long final stage across the Carneddau to the finish of the route at Conwy Castle. History of the walk After some involvement in planning sections of the Cotswold Way and Offa's Dyke Path in the 1950s, Tony Drake did some preliminary planning for a route from Gloucester to Snowdon via the Black Mountains, Brecon Beacons and Plynlimon. It was not until 1967 that it occurred to him to wonder why no one had proposed a long distance route over the principal mountains of Wales. The idea received enthusiastic response from the Ramblers' Association (now The Ramblers) and the Youth Hostels Association (England & Wales). In 1968 the Cambrian Way Committee Drake, A J . Cambrian Way : The Mountain Connoisseurs Walk. A J Drake / Cordee Leicester, 2008, p. 5. was formed and chaired by Drake. Groups from several different organisations, Ramblers, YHA, Brecon Beacons and Voluntary Wardens Association, were allocated sections to survey. The British Mountaineering Council was offered the Caernarvonshire section but turned out to be hostile to the whole concept. There was some disagreement as to which route should be taken in several places and where the start and finish should be. In the three subsequent meetings a number of compromises were made, some of them for safety reasons, but there were still divided opinions on parts of the route. The Countryside Commission had the responsibility for making recommendations to the Secretaries of State for the Environment or for Wales for the creation of long distance paths (now called National Trails), under provisions of the National Parks & Access to the Countryside Act 1949 (since 1991 these duties in Wales have been taken over by the Countryside Council for Wales). Routes approved by the Secretary of State become the responsibility of the local authorities to create with a 100% grant from national funds. New rights of way can be created by agreement or compulsorily by creation order. The commission from the beginning made encouraging noises and first mentioned the Cambrian Way in its annual report for 1968. However, it was made clear that only restricted resources and the route was still \\"under consideration\\" for a number of years. In April 1976 the Commission approved the Cambrian Way project in principle and in September 1977 started official consultations on the basis of a map showing both the Cambrian Way Committee's route and the Commission's Preferred Route which differed in many respects. All the principal summits in Snowdonia were omitted. The route was to go over the Aran Mountains and the Arenig Mountains instead of the Rhinog Mountains and Cadair Idris. The crossover from Black Mountains to Brecon Beacons was to be via Mynydd Llangorse. Following opposition from many quarters, the commission issued another line in January 1980 called a Consultation Route. This time the Cambrian Way Committee's route was not shown on the map, though the new route was closer to it than the 1977 line. Snowdon was included but still not the ridge of the Carneddau, Cadair Idris was included and a route to the seaward side of the Rhinog Mountains instead of a route over the Aran Mountains, where in the meantime an access row had blown up. The Black Mountains were omitted altogether following pressure from the Brecon Beacons National Park committee. In 1982 a compromise route called the \\"Consultation Route\\" was put forward, but strong objections were encountered from several bodies and it became clear that many more compromises would be needed to get approval. The initial enthusiasm of the Countryside Commission waned and the proposals were abandoned. With his hopes of official recognition shattered, Drake decided to publish his first guidebook of his unofficial route in 1984, with much greater freedom to define a route of his own preference. This was not the very first book of the Cambrian Way to be published, as he was pipped to the post by Richard Sale with his book A Cambrian Way, though this took a different route in some places and was not designed as a compact guidebook to be carried on a walk, meaning that Drake's book became the definitive guide to the Cambrian Way. Future of the Cambrian Way In accordance with a codicil to Tony Drake's will, the copyright of the guidebook and Cambrian Way website were left to a trust, which was to be formed by the three people who had been helping out during the latter years of his life. It was not until 1 October 2015 that the trust was officially formed, by which time one of the original helpers had died and another had expressed his wish to resign, leaving just one of the three named in the codicil remaining. However, Tony Drake also left a legacy to The Ramblers for maintaining and improving the Cambrian Way, and the working group that was set up to oversee this included members who were willing to become trustees of the Cambrian Way Trust. Cambrian Way Trust The Cambrian Way Trust currently has four Trustees and its purposes are: (1) The promotion of the Cambrian Way as a long distance walk as a benefit to the public. (2) To monitor the Cambrian Way route for improvements obstacles and variations. (3) Directly or through the making of grants and/or the persuasion of others to improve maintain and repair the Cambrian Way. (4) The publication of future versions of the Cambrian Way as a guide to walkers and to maintain improve and adapt The Cambrian Way Website so as to improve the usefulness of the site to walkers and sponsors. (5) To deal with such other matters connected or related to the provision of the Cambrian Way as a long distance walk as the Trustees think fit. The working groups These groups consists mostly of members of Ramblers Cymru, the Welsh section of The Ramblers. Task groups from local areas will undertake work in their own locality, coordinated by the working group. Their objectives are: (1) To survey the route and its variants to establish the condition of the route including any stiles, fences and gates. (2) To establish where waymarking would be beneficial and appropriate and to seek permission from landowners to allow such waymarks. It is not considered appropriate to do so over mountain tops, but it would be beneficial at lower levels through farmland where paths are not always easy to follow. (3) To report any obstacles along the route and suggest any alternatives to the route that it is considered would improve it for any reason. By consultation with the Cambrian Way Trust, decisions can be made as to whether these should be incorporated into future editions of the guidebook and promoted on the Cambrian Way website. (4) To liaise with landowners, County Councils and National Park Authorities as to what action should be taken to rectify any problems and/or improve the route. (5) To liaise with existing accommodation providers and campsites as listed in the guidebook and to seek addition establishments, particularly in remote areas. (6) To promote the Cambrian Way by whatever means are considered appropriate through The Ramblers and other organisations. On completion of this, there may be a possibility that the Ordnance Survey will mark the route on their maps, though this will depend upon how much waymarking has been achieved. In August 2019 Oliver Wicks from Ramblers Cymru said, \\"We have currently completed waymarking the route up to and including the Brecon Beacons and hope to have completed the entire route by the new year.\\" A new guide to the Cambrian Way was published in July 2019.

That same year, he made his screen debut playing the lead role of \\"Anselmus Aselmeyer\\" in Max Reinhardt's silent movie, Eine Venezianische Nacht, Abel acted in over one hundred silent films by renowned directors including Ernst Lubitsch, F. W. Murnau, and Richard Oswald, and alongside such famous silent film stars as Pola Negri, Henny Porten, Jenny Jugo, and Asta Nielsen. He often played dignified authority figures and was called the \\"Lewis Stone of German Pictures\\".Alfred Abel at IMDb Abel's more notable silent film roles include his performances as \\"Lorenz Lubota\\" in Phantom (1922), as \\"Count Graf Told\\" in Dr. Mabuse the Gambler (1922), as \\"Gaston\\" in Die Flamme (1923), and as \\"Alphonse Gunderman\\" in the French film, L'Argent (1928). Abel's most famous silent film performance was in Fritz Lang‚Äôs futuristic film, Metropolis (1927) as Joh Fredersen, leader of the metropolis. Abel was renowned for his acting style characterized by his avoidance of dramatic gesturing. He learned to show the psychology and internal tensions of his characters with reserved expressions. Many actors of his day struggled to change their acting styles for film after transitioning from stage acting and were often mocked later as sound film was introduced. With the beginning of talkies, Abel remained a much desired actor and starred in 38 films. He worked with many renowned directors such as Detlef Sierck and Anatole Litvak. Some of his better-known sound films include Litvak's Dolly's Way to Stardom (1930) as Count Eberhard, Heinz Ruehmann's Meine Frau, die Hochstaplerin (1931), Reinhold Schuenzel's romance, Beautiful Adventure (1932) as Count d'Eguzon, and Franz Liszt's ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Court Concert‚Äô‚Äô (1936) as Dichter Knips. Abel played the starring role of Sir John Menier in Alfred Hitchcock's Mary (1931), the German version of the Hitchcock‚Äôs Murder! (1930). Abel's final film role was as Daffinger in Herbert Maisch's Frau Sylvelin (1938), which was not released until after his death. There were rumours at the time of the 1922 film Nosferatu and for many years afterwards that Max Schreck, who played the vampire, did not actually exist and was a pseudonym for Abel. Directing career At the beginning of the 1920s, Abel began considering a career as a director and created the production company Artifex Film. The company's only film was The Strike of the Thieves (1921), which Abel directed himself. The film was a box office failure. Abel did not direct again until 1929; Narcose is considered his most ambitious work. Following Narcose, Abel directed Bon Voyage (1933) and Everything for a Woman (1935). Abel assisted Carl Hoffman as the dialogue director in the film Viktoria in 1935. Personal life and death Abel was married to Elizabeth Seidel with whom he had one daughter, Ursula (1915‚Äì1951). Ursula, like her father, also became a film actor. However, the Nazi regime in 1935 prohibited her from appearing in any further films after she failed to produce ancestry papers (Ariernachweis) for her father to prove he was not of Jewish descent. After battling a longtime illness, Abel died on 12 December 1937, aged 58. He was buried in the Friedhof Heerstra√üe cemetery in Berlin.

It won the Books in Canada First Novel Award in the same year and won the McKitterick Prize in 2003. It is set in a small farming community in Northern Ontario, the Crow Lake of the title,Not to be confused with the real Crow Lake (Kakagi Lake) in Ontario. and centres on the Morrison family (Kate the narrator, her younger sister Bo and older brothers Matt and Luke) and the events following the death of their parents. Kate's childhood story of the first year after their parents' death is intertwined with the story of Kate as an adult, now a successful young academic and planning a future with her partner, Daniel, but haunted by the events of the past. In among the narratives are set cameos of rural life in Northern Ontario, and of the farming families of the region. Plot The death of their parents, when Kate is 7 years old, Bo a toddler, and her brothers in their late teens, threatens the family with dispersal and seems to spell the end of their parents' dream that they should all have a college education. Luke, the oldest but not the most academic, gives up a place at a teachers college in order to look after the two youngest and allow Matt, academically brilliant and idolised by Kate, to complete his schooling and compete for university scholarships. This sacrifice leads to much tension between the brothers. Both work intermittently for a neighbouring family, the Pyes, who for several generations have suffered from fierce conflicts between fathers and sons. In the final crisis, Matt, after winning his scholarships, discovers that he has made the meek and distressed daughter of the Pye household, Marie, pregnant; she also reveals that her father, Calvin Pye, has killed her brother, who was thought to have run away from home as several other Pye sons had done. Calvin Pye kills himself, and Matt has to give up his plans for education to marry Marie. Kate sees the loss of Matt's potential academic career as a terrible sacrifice, and is unable to come to terms with Marie or Matt thereafter. The d√©nouement of the adult Kate's story comes when she returns to Crow Lake for Matt and Marie's son's eighteenth birthday, introducing Daniel to her family for the first time. In the course of this visit, she is made to realise - first by Marie and then by Daniel - that Matt's loss though real was not the total tragedy she had always considered it, and that it is her sense of it as tragic that has destroyed her relationship with him. The book ends with her struggling to come to terms with this view of their past and present relationships; the struggle is left unresolved but the final tone is optimistic. The book is essentially a double Bildungsroman, in that the development of both Matt and Kate is charted; but whereas we see the key events in Matt's young adulthood more or less in sequence, the key events in Kate's are sketched in from both ends, towards a crisis that in terms of events is Matt's but psychologically is more significant for Kate. The mixture of perspectives involved in Kate's story allows the author to relate violent events and highly charged emotions in a smooth and elegant style, a quality for which the book has been widely praised by reviewers.

Tamil people form the majority of Indian immigrants who came from India to Natal, South Africa, from 1860 onwards. After the expiry of their indentures most of these Indians moved to the cities, becoming established as a thoroughly urban population. Arrival in South Africa In 1833, the British Parliament passed the Act of Abolition, which banned slavery throughout the British Empire. The consequence of this was that many African slaves in the Colony of Natal decided to desert their former masters. The former masters, lacking sufficient labour force, persuaded the skeptical British authorities in India to implement the system of indentured labour in Natal. On November 16, 1860, 342 men, women and children arrived aboard the S.S. Truro in Port Natal (Durban). Apartheid Apartheid alienated all Indians as disenfranchised non-whites, and Hinduism in particular was perceived by many whites as antithetical to Christianity. The imposition of apartheid system also curtailed the opportunities for improvement and included the forced removals program, causing great disruption and social hardship. Integration Over the 150 years of residence in South Africa, participation in religion and its many festivals has brought devotees a valuable sense of identity and solidarity, especially in the light of their marginalization and the discrimination experienced under the apartheid system. A recent resurgence of interest in indigenous Tamil festivals seems to reflect a variety of religious, social and political concerns. In South Africa, the Tamil community tend to refer to their religion as \\"Tamil\\", rather than Hindu, although this blurring of the distinctions between religion and language also occurs with other Hindu ethnic groups in South Africa. Many Cape Coloureds with partial Indian ancestry are of Tamil South African descent. Education Tamil has been included as a high school subject for the South African Nationals Senior Certificate. Festivals \\"Purataasi\\" is the Tamil month from mid-September to mid-October and is a period dedicated to Lord Vishnu.The entire period of Purataasi is observed with the abstention of meat, sexual pleasures and intoxicants. The main prayer in every Tamil-cultured home is held on any of the four Saturdays during the period and much effort is put into this. The Tamil Community in South Africa also observe the Mariamman Festival in the Aadi Month which falls between mid-July and mid-August. Due to the fact that Maize Meal forms a large part in the Mariamman worship this prayer is usually referred to as \\"Porridge Prayers\\" by the locals. Kavadi is another famous festival among the Tamil community in South Africa. Such an example is the Melrose Sri Siva Subramaniar Alayam in Johannesburg that was first a steel temple dedicated to Lord Muruga and was built in 1890 and today attracts thousands of devotees during the Thai Poosam festival.

GenoPro can store additional information such as pictures, contacts, places, sources, occupation and education history for each individual, as well as document the relationships among individuals.  History  GenoPro was created in 1998 by Daniel Morin while studying computer engineering at the University of Waterloo. His original idea stemmed from his father's request to design a genogram during his training as a family counselor. The first version 1.00, was named \\"Generations\\". This version was a little portable 32 bit freeware version of only 202kB working on windows. With all the useful information and ability to edit very simply a generation tree of parents and child's. GenoPro has had many constant updates and improvements over the years. The following is a list of major version number updates.http://www.genopro.com/setup/history/ * December, 2006 - GenoPro 2007 also known as GenoPro 2.0 * August, 2009 - GenoPro 2.5.0.0 * December, 2010 - GenoPro 2011 * October 2015 - GenoPro 2016 was released.  Features  GenoPro‚Äôs architecture revolves around the pedigree layout where the user can view the entire genealogy tree at once, including family branches in any direction to illustrate the complex scenarios based on today's reconstructed families. With GenoPro, the user can manually customize the layout by positioning the individuals as well as using color to graphically emphasize what he/she feels is important in the family, such as ethnicity, culture, citizenship, education level, religion, political affiliations, and diseases in the case of medical pedigrees. GenoPro can split a large family tree into many sub-trees and hyperlink them together. With only two mouse clicks, the user can move an entire branch to another sheet. GenoPro creates the necessary hyperlinks to connect the trees. Supporting multiple sub trees is necessary for scaling large family trees containing tens of thousands of individuals. GenoPro can display data just like traditional genealogy software. GenoPro's spreadsheet includes hyperlinks to navigate between any objects, from parents to children to siblings, or across pictures, places, sources and citations. GenoPro's spreadsheet allows various functions, including in-place editing, bulk-editing, finding and replacing, data sorting, copying and pasting with other commercial spreadsheet applications, and of course, unlimited use of the undo/redo function for every operation. GenoPro displays special symbols to distinguish different family relationships such as marriage, divorce, cohabitation and love affairs, as well as other symbols for emotional relationships such as friendship, love, distrust, hostility and jealousy. GenoPro supports the creation of same-sex relationships, unlike other programs such as Personal Ancestral File, which do not. GenoPro's report generator can create HTML pages linked to interactive SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) family trees. Reports in GenoPro can be customized by modifying the full source code for each built-in report. GenoPro's report generator uses scripting languages such as VBScript and JavaScript. GenoPro sports built-in ASP objects and many additional objects making it easy to generate elaborate reports. GenoPro can also load third-party COM modules made in other programming languages such C++, C#, VB.NET or Java and/or connect to external databases such as Microsoft SQL, MySQL, or Oracle to fetch additional data for generating a report. The current version of GenoPro includes a new type of report to generate Microsoft Word and OpenOffice documents. GenoPro has its own object-oriented database engine designed to foster hierarchical data and circular references. Hierarchical data is the key for avoiding redundant data, which in turn eliminates inconsistencies, and reduces typing and memory storage. The greatest benefit of hierarchical data is providing a hierarchy for classifying data, such as grouping places by country, state, city and buildings. A building, such as a hospital or cemetery may further be divided into rooms and lots for finer data granularity. Since places are objects, the user can enter minute details, from street addresses and pictures, to latitude and longitude for GPS positioning. Any place deriving from a parent place will inherit its parent's values, unless overwritten. GenoPro's report generator understands hierarchical data and its generated reports give the user the option to expand each node to view details. Also, the report generator displays Geo Mapping in the Google Map for every place defined by a city name or a GPS position. Circular referencing is very common in genealogy, such as displaying a picture for a place, and linking this place to its original picture. Relational databases do not handle circular referencing, or if such a catastrophic scenario happens, the data is in a deadlock and cannot be deleted. Hierarchical data is nearly impossible to achieve for standard databases without writing massive bug-prone code requiring excessive processing, thus rendering the entire application extremely slow and unusable for large amounts of data.  Languages Available  GenoPro is available in 56 languages, including Albanian, Arabic, Brazilian Portuguese, Bulgarian, Catalan, Czech, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Icelandic, Indonesian, Italian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Scots Gaelic, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, Vietnamese and Ukrainian. GenoPro features an online collaboration system where users can translate the menus, dialogs and error messages.  File Format  GenoPro uses XML as its core file format, and its file extension .gno is a zipped-XML file. The user may rename the file extension .gno to .zip for editing the content of the genealogy document with a text editor. GenoPro can also import and export data in the GEDCOM format. It is important to realize that the GenoPro GEDCOM import cannot be relied upon to accurately transfer data from other genealogy programs. Other Platforms  Running GenoPro on a Macintosh requires special software such as Parallels, or Virtual PC for older non-Intel Macs. GenoPro runs on Linux and Mac with Wine,WineHQ - GenoPro 2.x but without the report generator.

The mission, commanded by Captain Eugene McCarley, consisted of 16 Americans and 110 Montagnard tribesmen and landed 60 miles to the west of their launch site at Dak To. Equipment caches and enemy troop dispositions were located and bombarded from the air, despite constant enemy contact, and two footlockers of intelligence were retrieved. The Hatchet Force then divided into three teams and were evacuated, leaving at least 54 PAVN soldiers killed.

His obituary in Der Spiegel described Rasp as \\"the German film villain in service, for over 60 years.\\"Spiegel Life and career Fritz Heinrich Rasp was the thirteenth child of a county surveyor. He was educated from 1908‚Äì1909 at the Theaterschule Otto K√∂nigin in Munich. He made his stage debut in 1909, after he successfully overcame a speech impediment. During his long career, the character actor appeared in some of the most famous theatres in Germany, working with acclaimed directors like Bertolt Brecht and Max Reinhardt and famous actors like Albert Bassermann, Joseph Schildkraut and Werner Krauss. Rasp made an early film debut in 1916 and appeared in some early films by his friend, director Ernst Lubitsch. With his \\"gaunt, ascetic looks\\",As Volker Wachter describes him Rasp played numerous scoundrels or shady characters during the Golden Age of German cinema in the 1920s. He is considered to be one of the most successful film villains in German film history. Some of Rasp's more notable film roles were \\"J. J. Peachum\\" in The Threepenny Opera (1931), as the reckless seducer Meinert in Diary of a Lost Girl (1929), as Mr. Brocklehurst in Orphan of Lowood (1926), an early German adaptation of Jane Eyre, and as the bank robber Grundeis in Emil and the Detectives (1931). He also portrayed the mysterious \\"Der Schmale\\" (\\"The Thin Man\\") in Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927). Many of the scenes in the latter film in which he appears are part of the Metropolis footage long believed lost until their recovery in 2008. In the 1960s, Rasp also appeared in numerous Edgar Wallace criminal films. In one of his last films, Bernhard Sinkel's comedy-drama Lina Braake (1975), Rasp starred against-type as a likable pensioner who steals money from an unscrupulous bank. Fritz Rasp was awarded with the Filmband in Gold in 1963 for his outstanding work for the German film.  Personal life  Fritz Rasp died of cancer at age 85 in Gr√§felfing, where he is also buried.

He was born to Welsh speaking parents in Woodstock, Oxfordshire and died in Southampton. He went up to Christ Church, Oxford University in 1925, and was the only Freshman selected to row in the 1926 Blue Boat. He collapsed during the race, and was later diagnosed as having a hypertrophied heart, and was told he was no longer needed to row for the university. Edwards left Oxford in 1927 after failing his exams, and became a school teacher. He also recommenced rowing, with London Rowing Club. While rowing with London Rowing Club, he was successful at Henley Royal Regatta in 1928, 1929, and 1930, winning the Grand Challenge Cup in 1930. At the British Empire Games in Canada in 1930, London Rowing Club crews representing England, and which contained Edwards, won two gold medals, in the eights and in the coxed fours. He was then invited to row in the 1930 Oxford Blue Boat. In the 1932 Olympics he won the gold medal in the coxless pairs event with Lewis Clive, and a second gold in the Great Britain coxless four, on the same day. He later turned to competitive flying, coming second in the 1935 King's Cup Race. During the Second World War Edwards served in RAF Coastal Command, once saving his own life by rowing four miles through a minefield in a dinghy after his plane crashed in the Atlantic Ocean.Wallechinsky, David (2004). The Complete Book of the Summer Olympics, Toronto: Sport Classic Books. After rising to the rank of Group Captain, he was demobbed in 1946. He was invited back to be a member of the Oxford coaching team in 1949, although resigned in 1957 after a disagreement with the Australian-born president, Roderick Carnegie. He was brought back in 1959 by OUBC President Ronnie Howard, but provoked a rebellion by certain members of the crew over his demands on them. Despite the resignation of certain members of the squad, Oxford beat Cambridge, and his subsequent coaching efforts made him an Oxford legend. In 1962, he coached the Wales four containing his two sons that won silver at the Commonwealth Games in Perth, Australia. He wrote a book on rowing technique in 1963 entitled The Way of a Man with a Blade. Having been a pupil of both Dr Bourne and Steve Fairbairn, he sought to bring together the divergent rowing styles of English Orthodoxy and Fairbairnism.

The United Planets Cruiser C-57D is a fictional starship featured in MGM's 1956 science fiction film Forbidden Planet. The design used for the starship is a flying saucer, inspired by the spate of UFO sightings during the 1950s era, and which itself inspired the look of the exterior saucer section and interior design of another iconic starship, Star Trek's USS Enterprise, as well as the Jupiter 2 space craft from the original 1965 TV series Lost in Space. Forbidden Planet production In the film's screenplay the starship carries no name, only the designation \\"United Planets Cruiser C-57D\\". The saucer has a lenticular profile. Above there is a dome, approximately a third of the diameter of the lens. Below there is a shallow cylinder of about the same diameter, and a smaller dome that ostensibly houses the starship's faster-than-light drive engine and central gyroscopic landing pedestal. The precise contours and proportions differ slightly between the saucer's shooting miniatures, full- size sets, and matte paintings used in the film. Upon the depicted landing, the saucer's gangway and two conveyor-loading ramps swing down at an angle from the underside hull, near the edge of the lower lens shape. The film's blueprints for the command deck (provenance unknown; retrieved 2010-02-23) depict a central circular \\"navigation center\\" with a transparent globe centered on a small model of the starship. Around this central space are a number of wedge-shaped rooms, including: * A room with a curved table, chairs, and a space for books (presumably a galley and recreation room). * A room with the \\"communications center\\", a chart table and the \\"main viewscope\\". * A room with 16 bunk beds, with a pit and crane between it and the central area. * A room with 9 \\"decelerator platforms\\". The film shows the crew standing on these low, cylindrical platforms, enveloped within an opaque blue glow while the saucer decelerates from hyperdrive, but does not show whether these low platforms must also be used during the transition to faster-than-light speed. On the starship's mezzanine level there is an instrument station and other rooms that aren't seen. The studio created a stage set of the interior command and mezzanine decks and a 60-foot (18 m) semicircular mock-up of the landed saucer's lower half (with the deployed central landing pedestal, gangway, and conveyor ramps). The sets suggest that the starship is somewhere between and feet in diameter. Three saucer miniatures were used, of , , and or in diameter, and costing an estimated total of $20,000. The largest miniature, constructed of wood, steel, and fiberglass, which contained the internal motors for the gangway, conveyor ramps, central landing pedestal, and glowing red-neon light engine, weighed . In 1970 MGM sold these miniatures as part of a MGM studio auction; but there was no record kept of who bought the largest of the three. A North Carolina man, who originally bought it for $800, but had not realized its market value until 2008 when he offered the model for auction and it sold for $78,000.Los Angeles Times, \\"The lost saucer of 'Forbidden Planet' reappears\\" (retrieved 2010-02-22)NJ.com, \\"Amazing the things that are for sale!\\" (retrieved 2010-02-22) Appearances in The Twilight Zone The three miniatures were reused in several episodes of Rod Serling's Twilight Zone TV series, sometimes slightly altered for the appearance: * 1960 \\"Third from the Sun\\" - The original navigation center is seen, as well as the starship. * 1960 \\"The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street\\" - The movie saucer scene reused was optically reprinted but was shown flying upside down. * 1961 \\"The Invaders\\" - A facsimile of the original saucer model, used for USAF Space Probe No 1, was partially destroyed by the episode's sole (giant) character at the end of the episode. * 1962 \\"To Serve Man\\" * 1962 \\"Hocus-Pocus and Frisby\\" * 1963 \\"Death Ship\\" - This episode makes the greatest use of stock and new footage of the saucer; it is identified in the episode as the Space Cruiser E-89, patrolling the 51st star system in the year 1997. Here the model saucer is shown using downward-directed rocket thrust propulsion; the identical crashed saucer already on the ground is a separately created prop. * 1963 \\"On Thursday We Leave for Home\\" * 1964 \\"The Fear\\" Model kits The C-57D was recreated as a large-scale miniature kit by Polar Lights in 2001 and was labeled as being a 1:72 scale, injection-molded, all-plastic model kit, which is , a scale of in diameter; 1:72 is a standard international plastic aircraft model scale.

In it had a population of , which is predominantly Maronite Catholic and Melkite Greek Catholic Christians (63%), with a Sunni Muslim Arab minority (about 35.7%).YNET On the slopes of a hill, at an elevation of 860 meters surrounded by cherry orchards, pears and apples, built houses, especially church building looks from afar. Number of inhabitants 3,000 divided by 55% Maronite Christian, 30% Greek Catholics and the rest are Muslims. Archaeological finds in Jish include two historical synagogues, a unique mausoleum and burial caves from classic era. According to Roman historian Josephus (War 4:93), Gischala was the last city in the Galilee to fall to the Romans during the First Jewish‚ÄìRoman War.Encyclopedia Judaica, Jerusalem, 1978, \\"Giscala,\\" vol. 7, 590 Historical sources dating from the 10th-15th centuries describe Jish (Gush Halav) as a village with a strong Jewish presence. In the early Ottoman era Jish was wholly Muslim. In the 17th century, the village was inhabited by Druze. In 1945, under the British rule, Jish had a population of 1,090 with an area of 12,602 dunams. It was largely depopulated during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, but was resettled not only by the original inhabitants who were at large Maronite Christians, but also by some Maronite Christians who were expelled from the razed villages Kafr Bir'im and some Muslims who were expelled from Dallata.Morris, 2004, p. 508 In 2010, the population of Jish was 3,000. Etymology Jish is the ancient Giscala Hulot & Rabot, \\"Actes de la societ√© g√©ographie,\\" Seance du 6 d√©cembre 1907, La G√©ographie, Volume 17, Paris, 1908, page 78. The Arabic name el-Jish is a variation of the site's ancient name Gush Halav in Hebrew, literally \\"a lump of milk\\", which may be a reference to the production of milk and cheese (for which the village has been famous since at least the early Middle Ages) or to the fertile surroundings. Other scholars believe the name Gush Halav refers to the light color of the local limestone, which contrasted with the dark reddish rock of the neighboring village, Ras al-Ahmar. History Bronze and Iron Age Settlement in Jish dates back 3,000 years. The village is mentioned in the Mishnah as Gush Halav, a city \\"surrounded by walls since the time of Joshua Ben Nun\\" (m. Arakhin 9:6).The Mishnah, (ed.) Herbert Danby, Arakhin 9:6 (p. 553 - note 9) Canaanite and Israelite remains from the Early Bronze and Iron Ages have been found there. Classical antiquity Remains of ancient synagogue, Gush Halav During the Classical era the town was known as Gischala, a Greek transcription of the Hebrew name Gush Halav. Both Josephus and later Jewish sources from the Roman- Byzantine period mention the fine olive oil for which the village was known.The Guide to Israel, Zev Vilnay, Jerusalem, 1972, p. 539. According to the Talmud, the inhabitants also engaged in the production of silk. Eleazar b. Simeon, described in the Talmud as a very large man with tremendous physical strength, was a resident of the town. According to one version of events, he was initially buried in Gush Halav but later reinterred in Meron, next to his father, Shimon bar Yochai.el-Jish/Gush HalavPesikta de-Rav Kahana (1949), p. 94a Jerome recorded that Paul the Apostle lived with his parents in \\"Giscalis in Judea\\", which is understood to be Gischala. After the fall of Gamla, Gush Halav was the last Jewish stronghold in the Galilee and Golan region during the First Jewish Revolt against Rome (66-73 CE). Gischala was the home of Yohanan mi-Gush Halav, known in English as John of Gischala, a wealthy olive oil merchant who became the chief commander in the Jewish revolt in the Galilee and later Jerusalem.Redefining ancient borders: The Jewish scribal framework of Matthew's Gospel, Aaron M. Gale Initially known as a moderate, John changed his stance when Titus arrived at the gates of Gischala accompanied by 1,000 horsemen and demanded the town's surrender.Excavations at the ancient synagogue of Gush ·∏§alav, Eric M. Meyers, Carol L. Meyers, James F. Strange In addition to Jewish burial sites and structures dated to 3rd - 6th centuries, Jewish-Christian amulets were discovered nearby.The missing century: Palestine in the fifth century: growth and decline, Zeev Safrai Christian artifacts from the Byzantine period have been found at the site. The synagogue of Gush Halav went through several phases of construction and reconstruction, one destruction being dated by excavator Eric M. Meyers to the earthquake of 551. Early Muslim, Crusader, and Mamluk periods Jish acquired its modern name in the Middle Ages. Historical sources from the 10th-15th centuries describe it as a large Jewish village and it is mentioned in the 10th century by Arab geographer Al-Muqaddasi. Jewish life in the 10th and 11th centuries is attested to by documents in the Cairo Geniza. In 1172, the Jewish traveler Benjamin of Tudela found about 20 Jews living there. This passage is not present in the edition of Ishtori Haparchi also attended a megilla reading when he visited in 1322. Ottoman period In 1596, Jish appeared in Ottoman tax registers as being in the Nahiya of Jira, of the Liwa Safad. It had a population of 71 households and 20 bachelors; all Muslim. The villagers paid taxes on goats and beehives, but most of its taxes were in the form of a fixed sum, total taxes were 30,750 ak√ße.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 176Note that Rhode, 1979, p. 6 writes that the register that H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah studied was not from 1595/6, but from 1548/9 In the 17th century, the village was inhabited by Druze. The Turkish traveler Evliya √áelebi, who passed by the village in 1648, wrote > Then comes the village of Jish, with one hundred houses of accursed > believers in the transmigration of souls (tenƒÅsukhi mezhebind√©n). Yet what > beautiful boys and girls they have! And what a climate! Every one of these > girls has queenly, gazelle-like, bewitching eyes, which captivate the > beholder‚Äîan unusual sight. The Galilee earthquake of 1837 caused widespread damage and over 200 deaths. Three weeks afterward, contemporaries reported \\"a large rent in the ground...about a foot wide and fifty feet long.\\" All the Galilee villages that were badly damaged at the time, including Jish, were situated on the slopes of steep hills. The presence of old landslides has been observed on aerial photographs. The fact that the village was built on dip slopes consisting of soft bedrock and soil has made it more vulnerable to landslides.Damage Caused By Landslides During the Earthquakes of 1837 and 1927 in the Galilee Region According to Andrew Thomson, no houses in Jish were left standing. The church fell, killing 130 people and the old town walls collapsed. A total of 235 people died and the ground was left fissured.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol. 3. pp. 368-369 At the time, the village was noted as a mixed Muslim and Maronite village in the Safad district.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, 2nd appendix, p. 134 At the end of the 19th century, Jish was described as a \\"well-built village of good masonry\\" with about 600 Christian and 200 Muslim inhabitants.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 198 A population list from about 1887 showed El Jish to have about 1,935 inhabitants; 975 Christians and 960 Muslims.Schumacher, 1888, p. 189 British Mandate Jish 1939 Jish 1939 At the time of the 1922 census of Palestine, Jish had a population of 721; 380 Christians and 341 Muslims.Barron, 1923, Table XI, Sub-district of Safad, p. 41 The Christians were classified as 71% Maronite and 29% Greek Catholic (Melchite).Barron, 1923, Table XVI, p. 51 By the 1931 census, Jish had 182 inhabited houses and a population of 358 Christians and 397 Muslims.Mills, 1932, p. 107 In the 1945 statistics, Jish had a population of 1,090; 350 Christians and 740 Muslims,Department of Statistics, 1945, p. 09 and the village spanned 12,602 dunams, mostly Arab-owned.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics.

Many of the residents of Jish forced to leave the village in 1948 fled to Lebanon and became Palestinian refugees. Christians from the nearby town of Kafr Bir'im resettled in Lebanon and Jish, where today they are citizens of Israel, but continue to press for their right of return to their former villages. In October 1950, Israeli forces raided Jish and detained seven suspected smugglers who were stripped, bound and beaten. They were released without charge.Morris, 1993, p. 167 In December 2010, a hiking and bicycle path known as the Coexistence Trail was inaugurated, linking Jish with Dalton, a neighboring Jewish village. The 2,500 meter-long trail, accessible to people with disabilities, sits 850 meters above sea level and has several lookout points, including a view of Dalton Lake, where rainwater is collected and stored for agricultural use.Galilee Coexistence Trail Inaugurated, Jerusalem Post Today Jish is known for its efforts to revive Aramaic as a living language. In 2011, the Israeli Ministry of Education approved a program to teach the language in Jish elementary schools. Maronites in Jish say that Aramaic is essential to their existence as a people, in the same way that Hebrew and Arabic are for Jews and Arabs. Demographics Today, 55% of the inhabitants of Jish are Maronite Christians, 10% percent are Melkites and 35% percent are Muslims. The population of the village was . Geography Tomb of the Prophet Joel in Jish Jish is located in Upper Galilee, in the Northern district of Israel. The town is close to Mount Meron, the tallest standing mountain of Galilee. Recently, a new road has connected Jish with the nearby Jewish village of Dalton. Religious sites and shrines According to Christian tradition, the parents of Saint Paul were from Jish.Galilee villages launch campaign to attract Christian pilgrims John of Giscala, the son of Levi, was born in Jish. Other churches in Jish are a small Maronite Church that was rebuilt after the 1837 earthquake and the Elias Church, the largest in the village, which operates a convent.Gush Halav The tombs of Shmaya and Abtalion, Jewish sages who taught in Jerusalem in the early 1st century, are located in Jish. According to tradition, the prophet Joel was also buried there. Archaeology Remains of Gush Halav synagoguge Eighteen archaeological sites have been excavated to date in Jish and vicinity. Archaeologists have excavated two synagogues in use from the Roman and Byzantine periods (3rd to 6th centuries CE).Projects - Preservation One synagogue is located at the top of the village and the other east of it.Conder and Kitchener (1881), p. 224 On the remains of the upper synagogue, found by Kitchener of the Palestine Exploration Fund, the Maronite Church of Mar Boutros was built. Jewish-Christian amulets were discovered nearby. Coins indicate that Jish had strong commercial ties with the nearby city of Tyre. On Jish's western slope, a mausoleum was excavated, with stone sarcophagi similar to those seen at the large Jewish catacomb at Beit She'arim. The inner part of the mausoleum contained ten hewn loculi, burial niches known in Hebrew as kokhim. In the mausoleum, archaeologists found several skeletons, oil lamps and a glass bottle dating to the fourth century CE. A network of secret caves and passageways in Jish, some of them located under private homes, is strikingly similar to hideaways in the Judean lowlands used during the Bar Kokhba revolt.ERETZ Magazine See also *Hanna Jubran *Elinor Joseph *Arab localities in Israel *Population displacements in Israel after 1948 *Arameans in Israel References Bibliography Gelber, Y.

He was the president and chief operating officer of Allbritton Communications Company and founding chief executive officer and president of Politico. He was the chief of staff for former President Ronald Reagan from 1989-1995, and is chairman of the board of trustees of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation.  Early life  Ryan was born on April 12, 1945, in Tampa, Florida.  Education  In 1977, Ryan graduated with a Bachelor's Degree from University of Southern California, and graduated magna cum laude. In 1980, Ryan graduated with honors from USC Law School. In 2019, before delivering the commencement address, Ryan received an honorary doctorate degree from Wake Forest University.  Career   Attorney  Ryan was employed as an attorney in the Los Angeles, California law firm of Hill, Farrer and Burrill before joining the successful 1980 Reagan-Bush presidential campaign. White House years Ryan began serving at the White House in February 1982 as Deputy Director of Presidential Appointments and Scheduling. He was appointed a year later to the position of Director of Presidential Appointments and Scheduling. In 1985, Ryan was appointed by the President to head the White House Office of Private Sector Initiatives, as well as maintaining his employment as Director of Scheduling. On November 4, 1987, President Reagan personally appointed Ryan to be Assistant to the President, the highest level of staff position in the White House. When President Reagan left office on January 20, 1989, he and First Lady Nancy Reagan returned to California. Ryan was hired to be the former President's post-Chief of Staff. During this time, Ryan was responsible for the establishment and operation of Reagan's office in Century City. He was also instrumental in the design, fundraising, planning, and overseeing the construction of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. Ryan left his position as Chief of Staff in 1995. A year earlier, President Reagan announced to the world that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Media career Following his service as Chief of Staff to former President Reagan, Ryan became vice-chairman of the television, cable, and internet company Allbritton Communications. As President and COO of the company, he managed its multiple broadcast and cable properties. In 2007, Ryan co-founded Politico, a politically focused website and newspaper. Under his leadership as President and CEO, Politico was recognized by Fast Company Magazine for Excellence as one of the \\"World's Most Innovative Companies\\" in March 2010. In the May 2013 issue of Washington Life, the impact of Politico was noted with Ryan's inclusion in the \\"Power 100\\" list of the One Hundred Most Influential People in Washington. The success of their cross-platform coverage of political news won the \\"Walter Cronkite Award\\" in 2013 for Politico, ABC-7, and NewsChannel 8 under Ryan's management. In September 2014, Jeff Bezos, owner of The Washington Post, named Ryan Publisher and CEO, signaling a new digitally- focused direction for the publication.Financial Times, 9/2/14 Reagan Foundation In 1995, Ryan became the chairman of the board of trustees for the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation, serving with fellow board members including First Lady Nancy Reagan and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. He manages the foundation and takes part in library events, with a mission of \\"preserving Ronald Reagan's legacy.\\" Under Ryan's chairmanship, the Reagan Foundation garnered the \\"crown jewel\\" of President artifacts by obtaining Air Force One, the Presidential Aircraft that had flown Reagan and six other Presidents of the United States. Through funds contributed by his friend T. Boone Pickens and other donors, the Air Force One Museum was built at the Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, CA. Ryan made a personal contribution of his own to the Reagan Presidential Library by purchasing the Ronald Reagan Pub in County Tipperary, Ireland while visiting it on a family vacation in 2004. The working pub was completely disassembled and transported by container ship to Los Angeles where it was reassembled under the wing of Air Force One at the Reagan Presidential Library. Ryan's friend, Presidential journalist, Hugh Sidey, joined in in the formal dedication of the Ronald Reagan Pub at the Library. In making the gift, Ryan expressed his pride in his Irish heritage which may account for the reason he and his wife host a large St. Patrick's Day party at their Potomac, MD home each year. Ryan headed the team that organized the moving national tribute and funeral for Ronald Reagan in June 2004. He was a Pall Bearer at President Reagan's request. Ryan headed the year-long celebration of Ronald Reagan's 100th Birthday in 2011. President Obama appointed him to the bipartisan Ronald Reagan Centennial Commission created by an act of Congress. Ryan was elected Chairman of the Commission by the United States Senators and Members of Congress that served on the Commission with him. Events were held across the country and in major European Capitals celebrating the impact of Reagan policies in promoting freedom and democracy. In the years following the Reagan Administration, Ryan was very close to Nancy Reagan and is said to have advised her on important matters. In May 2013, he was Nancy Reagan's personal representative at the official funeral service for former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in London.  White House Historical Association  Ryan has served as a Director of the White House Historical Association since 2001. In 2012, Ryan became the Chairman of White House Historical Association. As part of the \\"Campaign for White House History\\", Ryan works with First Lady Michelle Obama, Caroline Kennedy and former First Family members of both political parties to provide funding for educational and preservation projects for the White House. David M. Rubenstein, former White House aide and philanthropist, supported this effort through a $10 million gift to create the David M. Rubenstein National Center for White House History. Another major project of the fundraising campaign is the new White House Visitors Center.  Other activities  While working in the Reagan White House, Ryan was introduced to Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales. This led to a joint meeting of British and American Business Leaders that encouraged corporate social responsibility and support of private sector initiatives. Over the years since then, Ryan has served as a Patron of the Prince of Wales Foundation and as a member of the Board of Director of Duchy USA, the Prince's corporate initiative in the United States. Ryan serves as Co-Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Presidential Libraries, a nonpartisan group formed by the Archivist of the United States. He is a member of the Advisory Board for the National Museum of American History, the Board of Councilors for the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism at USC and the Ford's Theatre Board of Trustees. A program obtained from the elite Alfalfa Club Dinner in January 2014 indicated that Ryan is the Secretary of that secretive organization.

The settlement is an example of hunter-gatherer sedentism, a crucial step in the transition from foraging to farming. 'Ain Mallaha has one of the earliest known archaeological evidence of dog domestication. The village This site is located in northern Israel, north of the Sea of Galilee, and is in an area surrounded by hills and located by an ancient lake, Lake Huleh. At the time of its Natufian inhabitance, the area was heavily forested in oak, almond, and pistachio trees.Mithen, Steven J.: After The Ice: A Global Human History, 20,000-5000 BC, page 29. Harvard University Press paperback edition, 2003. Evidence of settlement at Mallaha or 'Ain Mallaha dates back to the Mesolithic period at circa 10,000 BCE.Schmandt- Besserat, 2009, p. 47 The first permanent village settlement of pre- agricultural times in Israel, Kathleen Kenyon describes the material remains found there as Natufian.Kenyon, 1985, p. 20.Kipfer, 2013, p. 357 The Natufian village was colonized in three phases. The first two phases had massive stone- built structures with smaller ones in the third phase. These phases occurred from 12,000 to 9600 BCE. The dwellings were cut into the earth, had subterranean floors, and walls that were built of dry stone. Wooden posts supported the roofs, which were probably thatches with brushwood or animal hides.Mithen, Steven J.: After The Ice: A Global Human History, 20,000-5000 BC, page 28. Harvard University Press paperback edition, 2003. Hearths were located within the dwellings. Kenyon describes the Natufian village as consisting of 50 circular, semi-subterranean, one-room huts, paved with flat slabs and surrounded by stone walls up to high. The floors and walls of the homes were decorated in solid white or red, a simple and popular decorative motif in the Near East at the time.  Diet  Early Natufian, 12000 BC. The inhabitants of 'Ain Mallaha were sedentary hunter gatherers; it is likely that they lived in 'Ain Mallaha year round, gathering food from the surrounding wild stands of edible vegetation, and hunting local game. The inhabitants used hand mortars for grinding wild nuts and grain, and stone sickles for cutting plants from wild stands. Many of these sickle stones hold \\"sickle-gloss,\\" indicating they had been used to cut large numbers of plant stems, most likely wild wheat and barley.Mithen, Steven J.: After The Ice: A Global Human History, 20,000-5000 BC, page 30. Harvard University Press paperback edition, 2003. The inhabitants are known to have eaten gazelle, fallow deer, wild boar, red and roe deer, hare, tortoise, reptiles, and fish.C. Scarre, The Human Past, 2005. The inhabitants appear to have subsisted on fish from nearby Lake Hula, as well as by hunting and gathering; no evidence of animal domestication or cultivation has been found,Edwards et al., 1970, p. 499 with the conspicuous exception of dogs (see Burial customs).  Burial customs  It is likely that entire families were buried in the remains of their own houses, the houses being subsequently abandoned. During excavation, Perrot found one dwelling to contain the graves of 11 men, women, and children, many of them wearing elaborate decorations made from dentalium shells. In another dwelling (131), twelve individuals were found, one buried with her hand resting on the body of a small puppy.Mithen, Steven J.: After The Ice: A Global Human History, 20,000-5000 BC, page .

She was involved in the creation of Solidarity, of which she was a member of its organizing committee. Biography Pienkowska's father worked in the Lenin Shipyard and had joined in the shipyard workers' protest of December 1970. In 1980 she was a young, widowed mother (of Sebastian) working as the shipyard nurse. She had been one of the founders of the underground Free Trade Unions of the Coast in the 1970s. She wrote health-related articles for the underground journal, The Coastal Worker, mostly related to shipyard safety and rising accident rates. The August 1980 strike started on the 14th over the firing of Anna Walentynowicz. All of the phone lines into the shipyard were cut except to the clinic, and as the nurse, Pienkowska was instrumental in communicating to the outside world about the strike that ultimately spread to the Baltic coast and the giant wave of strikes in Poland. Her first call was to Jacek Kuro≈Ñ of the Workers' Defence Committee (KOR) in Warsaw. The press described her as a \\"firebrand\\", and she herself admitted to being moderated by Kuro≈Ñ in order to avoid Soviet intervention. On the third day of the strike, on 16 August 1980, management granted Lenin Shipyard workers their working and pay demands. Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa and others announced the end of the strike. Pienkowska was outraged because of her close connection to the many workers outside the shipyard striking in solidarity with the shipyard workers. She told Wa≈Çƒôsa, \\"You betrayed them. Now the authorities will crush us like bedbugs.\\" \\"A Politics of Experience\\", by Lawrence Goodwyn, First of the Year: 2008 (Routledge, 2017) As workers were beginning to leave, Pienkowska grabbed a loudspeaker and made a passionate speech about the responsibility to keep the strike going to make sure that the other factories which had in the meantime started solidarity strikes with the shipyard would not be left exposed. She and Walentynowicz managed to close the gates, but many workers went home, only to return by the next day (often at the insistence of their wives). The strike was salvaged. Pienkowska was then among the authors of the 21 demands of the Interfactory Strike Committee, 17 August 1980, which led to the Gda≈Ñsk Agreement, of which she was a signatory. Pienkowska secretly married Bogdan Borusewicz during the period of martial law. He spent five years in hiding, visiting her from time to time. While still in hiding, Bogdan, disguised as a woman, attended the baptism of their daughter Kinga. Wa≈Çƒôsa kissed \\"her\\" hand as was customary for a Polish male, either to play along with the ruse or because he did not recognize Borusewicz. Pienkowska worked as the shipyard nurse until 1991, when she was elected Senator for one term. She and her husband later joined the Freedom Union, the party led by post-Communist Poland's first freely elected Prime Minister, Tadeusz Mazowiecki. In 1998 she became a member of the city council in Gda≈Ñsk and was active in local politics and in health issues until the end of her life.  Death  Pienkowska died on 17 October 2002, reportedly from cancer. On 3 May 2006, she was posthumously awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta posthumously at the same ceremony where Walentynowicz received her Order of the White Eagle. Andrzej Wajda said that Pienkowska had been the model for a character in his film Man of Iron, based on events in the shipyard, who speaks her words: The main character of the 2006 film Strike recreates many of Pienkowska's actions and words.

The stated goals of this policy were safeguarding world peace, opposing all forms of hegemony, and achieving economic modernization at home. Chinese statements repeatedly emphasized the interrelation among these goals. In other words, China needed a peaceful international environment so that adequate resources could be devoted to its ambitious development plans. The goal of economic modernization was a driving force behind China's increasingly active participation in world affairs, exemplified by its policy of opening up to the outside world, which greatly expanded Chinese economic relations with foreign countries. As part of what it called an \\"independent foreign policy of peace\\", Beijing has joined numerous international organizations, and it has maintained diplomatic relations with more nations than at any time since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. By 2007, China has diplomatic relations with 157 nations, and‚Äîin contrast with earlier periods‚Äîhas been willing to interact with governments of different social systems or ideologies on a basis of peaceful coexistence and mutual respect.  Overview  Another characteristic Chinese foreign policy has had in common with that of many other countries is that the actual conduct of foreign relations sometimes has been at odds with official policy. Beijing's stress on principles in its official statements at times makes the contrast between statements and actions particularly noticeable. In addition, a nation's leaders must often make right decisions in reaction to events and circumstances, rather than simply formulating a rational foreign policy based on their goals. The need to react to what has happened or what may happen adds an element of unpredictability to foreign policy decision making, as has been the case at several crucial junctures in Chinese foreign relation since 1949. In addition to the aspects of foreign policy formulation and implementation that China has in common with other countries, China's foreign policy from 1949 has had these characteristics: contrast between practicality and adherence to principles; fluctuation between militancy and peacefulness; tension between self-reliance and dependence on others; and contrast between China's actual and potential capabilities. These contradictory characteristics have at times created a confusing picture of Chinese foreign policy: is Chinese foreign policy basically pragmatic or primarily based on principles? Is China peace-loving or intent on fomenting unrest? Is China's ultimate goal to be self-sufficient or economically interdependent with the rest of the world? And is China basically a poor, developing country that is at most a regional power or actually a nascent economic and military giant deserving of superpower status? The response to these questions is that since 1949 Chinese foreign policy has reflected all of these contrasting features. Beijing had emphasized principles and ideology above everything else in foreign relations, especially during the 1950s and 1960s, but Chinese leaders at times have also shown a practical side that gave them the flexibility to change policies, sometimes drastically, when they deemed it in China's best interest. One of the most dramatic changes was the shift from an alliance with the Soviet Union against the United States and Japan in the 1950s to an explicitly anti-Soviet policy and rapprochement with Japan and the United States in the 1970s. Since 1949 Chinese foreign policy has fluctuated between periods of militancy, for example during the Cultural Revolution (1966‚Äì76), when China called for worldwide revolution, and periods when Beijing has been a chief proponent of peaceful coexistence among nations, such as during the mid-1950s and again during the 1980s. How self-reliant or dependent on others China should become in order to modernize has been a constant dilemma in Chinese policy since the nineteenth century. As this policy fluctuated, Chinese foreign relations have alternated between a tendency toward isolation and periods of openness to foreign assistance and influence. Finally, the contradiction between China's actual capabilities since 1949 and its perceived potential has been another salient and distinctive feature of its foreign relations. China's tremendous size, population, natural resources, military strength, and sense of history have placed it in the unusual position of being a developing country that has often been treated as a major global power having a special relationship with the United States and, Russia, previously, the Soviet Union.  Evolution of foreign policy  Understanding the origins and forces that have shaped China's foreign policy provides a framework in which to view both the changes and the continuities in Chinese foreign policy from 1949. The origins of China's foreign policy can be found in its size and population, historical legacy, worldview, nationalism, and Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought. These factors have combined with China's economic and military capabilities, governmental structure, and decision-making processes to make certain foreign policy goals prominent: security, sovereignty and independence, territorial integrity and reunification, and economic development.  Historical legacy and worldview  China's long and rich history as the world's oldest continuous civilization has affected Chinese foreign relations in various ways. For centuries the Chinese empires enjoyed basically unchallenged greatness and self-sufficiency. China saw itself as the cultural center of the universe, a view reflected in the concept of the Middle Kingdom (Zhongguo, the Chinese word for China). For the most part, it viewed non-Chinese peoples as uncivilized barbarians. Although China was occasionally overrun and ruled by these \\"barbarians\\", as during the Yuan (1279‚Äì1368 A.D.) and [Qing DynastyQing] (1644‚Äì1911 A.D.) dynasties, the non-Chinese usually retained enough Chinese institutions to maintain a continuity of tradition. Because the Chinese emperor was considered the ruler of all mankind by virtue of his innate superiority, relations with other states or entities were tributary, rather than state-to-state relations between equals. Traditionally, there was no equivalent of a foreign ministry; foreign relations included such activities as tributary missions to the emperor made by countries seeking trade with China and Chinese military expeditions against neighboring barbarians to keep them outside China's borders. The first Europeans who sought trade with China, beginning in the sixteenth century, were received as tributary missions and had to conform to the formalities and rituals of the tribute system at the Chinese court. China's view of itself as the undisputed center of civilization‚Äîa phenomenon called sinocentrism‚Äîremained basically unchanged until the nineteenth century, when the Qing dynasty began to deteriorate under Western pressure. A traditional concept related to China's view of itself as the Middle Kingdom that continues to have relevance is the idea of \\"using barbarians to control barbarians.\\" In modern times, this practice has taken the form of using relations with one foreign power as a counterweight to relations with another. Two examples are China's policy of \\"leaning to one side\\" in the Sino-Soviet alliance of the 1950s for support against the United States and Beijing's rapprochement with the United States in the 1970s to counteract the Soviet threat China perceived at the time. China's strong desire for sovereignty and independence of action, however, seems to have made Chinese alliances or quasi-alliances short-lived. Another effect of China's historical legacy is its tendency toward isolationism and an ambivalence about opening up to the outside world. In imperial times, China's foreign relations varied from dynasty to dynasty‚Äîfrom cosmopolitan periods like the Tang dynasty (618-907) to isolationist periods such as the Ming dynasty (1368‚Äì1644), when few foreigners were allowed in the country. Overall, the sinocentric worldview and China's history of centuries of self-sufficiency favored isolation, which contributed to China's difficulty when confronted by expansionist Western powers in the nineteenth century. The debate over self- reliance and possible corruption by foreign influences or opening up to the outside world in order to modernize more quickly has continued for over a century and is still an issue today.  Nationalism  The importance of sovereignty and independence of action in Chinese foreign policy since 1949 has been closely related to Chinese nationalism. Just as Chinese national pride has been a natural outgrowth of China's long and rich historical tradition, the nationalism of Chinese leaders also has derived from the injustices China suffered in more recent history, in particular, China's domination by foreign powers from the nineteenth century until the end of World War II. During this time, which China refers to as \\"the century of shame and humiliation\\", the formerly powerful imperial government devolved to what China calls \\"semicolonial\\" status, as it was forced to sign unequal treaties and grant foreigners special privileges of extraterritoriality. Foreign powers divided China into spheres of influence. Most debilitating and humiliating was the foreign military threat that overpowered China, culminating in Japan's invasion and occupation of parts of China in the late 1930s. The bitter recollection of China's suffering at the hands of foreign powers has continued to be a source of Chinese nationalistic sentiment since 1949. The suspicion of foreign powers, opposition to any implication of inferior status, and desire to reassert sovereignty and independence have strongly influenced Chinese foreign policy. Examples of this attitude are Mao Zedong's statement in 1949 that \\"the Chinese people have stood up\\" and Deng Xiaoping's 1982 pronouncement that \\"no foreign country can expect China to be its vassal or expect it to swallow any bitter fruit detrimental to its interests.\\" A foreign policy goal closely related to nationalism has been the desire to achieve territorial integrity and to restore to Chinese sovereignty areas previously considered a part of China. Although China has not resolved many border disputes with several of its neighbors, including India, the Russia, and Vietnam (including islands in the South China Sea), Beijing has concluded boundary settlements with other nations, including Pakistan, Burma, Nepal, Afghanistan, North Korea, and Mongolia. Negotiations on border issues, held intermittently with Russia since 1949 and with India since the early 1980s, continue to be held. The difficulty of resolving these issues seem to reflect their relation to sensitive questions of national pride both in China and in neighboring countries and sometimes to questions of China's perceived national security interests. For example, Qing control over Outer Mongolia (present-day Mongolia) had lapsed long before 1949 and had been supplanted by Soviet influence. Although it was most likely with reluctance and regret, China recognized Mongolia as a separate nation in 1949. By contrast, asserting sovereignty over another outlying area, Xizang (Tibet), was considered such an important strategic goal that military force was used to gain control there in 1950 and to reassert it in 1959. Two other Chinese areas that had been under the control of foreign powers were Hong Kong and Macau. According to Chinese statements, these \\"problems left over from history\\" were the result of imperialist aggression and the incompetence of Chinese rulers. Macau, the first European enclave on the Chinese coast, was occupied by Portugal in 1557 and ceded to Portugal under an 1887 treaty. Britain gained control of Hong Kong island and adjacent territory through three treaties with China in the nineteenth century. In the mid-1980s China concluded formal arrangements with Britain and Portugal for the return of these areas to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 (Hong Kong) and 1999 (Macau). Both agreements were made under a policy of \\"one country, two systems\\", giving the areas a high degree of autonomy as \\"special administrative regions\\" of China. From the perspective of Chinese nationalism, negotiating the return of both Hong Kong and Macau to Chinese sovereignty before the end of the twentieth century was undoubtedly one of the major foreign policy accomplishments of Chinese leaders in the late twentieth century. The most crucial of the issues of national reunification, however, remain unresolved: the issue of Taiwan. Chiang Kai-shek and his forces fled to Taiwan after the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. The government they established there, the \\"Republic of China\\", continued to claim authority as the government of the Chinese nation almost four decades after the founding of the People's Republic. Although China's goal of reunifying Taiwan with the mainland remained unchanged, the previous, more militant Chinese policy of \\"liberating Taiwan\\" was replaced in the 1980s by the concept of reunification under the \\"one country, two systems\\" policy. The agreements on Hong Kong and Macau were considered by many observers as possible precedents for reunifying Taiwan with the mainland. Because of the legacy of mistrust between the leaders of the two sides and other complex factors, however, this difficult and longstanding problem does not appear close to resolution today.  Influence of ideology  An important influence on Chinese foreign policy that had especially affected China's interpretations of world events has been ideology, both Marxist-Leninist and Maoist. The ideological components of China's foreign policy, whose influence varied over time, had included a belief that conflict and struggle were inevitable; a focus on opposing imperialism; the determination to advance communism throughout the world, especially through the Chinese model; and the Maoist concept of responding with flexibility while adhering to fundamental principles. One of the most basic aspects of China's ideological worldview had been the assumption that conflict, though not necessarily military conflict, was omnipresent in the world. According to Marxist-Leninist analysis, all historical development was the result of a process of struggle, between classes within a nation, between nations themselves, or between broader forces such as socialism and imperialism. A basic tenet of Chinese leaders held that the international situation is best understood in terms of the \\"principal contradictions\\" of the time. Once these contradictions were understood, they could be exploited in order to, as Mao said, \\"win over the many, oppose the few, and crush our enemies one by one.\\" China amplified the Leninist policy of uniting with some forces in order to oppose others more effectively in a united front. Chinese leaders urged the formation of various united fronts as they had perceived the contradictions in the world to change over time. Perhaps because of the belief in struggle as necessary for progress, for most of its history after 1949 China considered world war inevitable. This changed in the 1980s, when Chinese leaders began to say that the forces for peace in the world had become greater than the forces for war. One reason for growing world stability was seen in \\"multipolarization\\", that is, the growth of additional forces, such as the Third World and Europe, to counterbalance the tension between the United States and the Soviet Union. China's description of world events as a struggle between opposing forces, however, had remained unchanged until the early 1990s. Opposition to imperialism‚Äîdomination by foreign powers‚Äîis another major ideological component of Chinese foreign policy. The Leninist emphasis on the struggle against imperialism made sense to Chinese leaders, whose nationalism had evolved in part in reaction to China's exploitation by foreign powers during the nineteenth century. Although opposition to imperialism and hegemony has remained a constant, the specific target of the opposition has changed since 1949. In somewhat oversimplified terms, China focused on opposing United States imperialism in the 1950s; on opposing collusion between United States imperialism and Soviet revisionism in the 1960s; on combating Soviet social-imperialism or hegemony in the 1970s; and on opposing hegemony by either superpower in the 1980s. The extent of China's determination to advance communism throughout the world had been another component of its foreign policy that has fluctuated since 1949. In the early 1950s and during the 1960s, Chinese leaders called for worldwide armed struggle against colonialism and \\"reactionary\\" governments. China supplied revolutionary groups with rhetorical and, in some cases, material support. Central to support for leftist movements was the idea that they should take China as a model in their struggle for national liberation. Chinese leaders expressed the belief that China's experience was directly applicable to the circumstances in many other countries, but they also stressed the importance of each country's suiting its revolution to its own conditions‚Äîcreating ambiguity about China's position on \\"exporting\\" revolution. For most of the time since 1949, China's dedication to encouraging revolution abroad has appeared to receive a lower priority than other foreign policy goals. Militancy and support for worldwide revolution peaked during the Cultural Revolution, when China's outlook on liberation struggles seemed to take its cue from Lin Biao's famous 1965 essay \\"Long Live the Victory of People's War!\\" This essay predicted that the underdeveloped countries of the world would surround and overpower the industrial nations and create a new communist world order. As a result of alleged Chinese involvement in subversive activities in Indonesia and several African countries in the late 1960s, those nations broke off diplomatic relations with Beijing. By the 1980s China had lessened or discontinued its support for revolutionary and liberation movements around the world, prominent exceptions being the Palestine Liberation Organization and resistance fighters in Cambodia and Afghanistan. Despite its shift toward cultivating state-to-state relations with established governments, many other countries had continued to be suspicious of China's intentions. Especially in Asia, where Beijing previously supported many local communist parties, China's image as a radical power intent on fomenting world revolution continued to affect the conduct of its foreign relations into the late 1980s. One of the major characteristics of Chinese foreign policy since 1949 has been its claim of consistently adhering to principles while particular interpretations and policies have changed dramatically. A statement by Mao Zedong seems to summarize this apparent contradiction: \\"We should be firm in principle; we should also have all flexibility permissible and necessary for carrying out our principles.\\" Although claiming that, on the whole, China has never deviated from such underlying principles as independence and safeguarding peace, Chinese leaders have made major shifts in foreign policy based on their pragmatic assessment of goals and the international situation. Aiding this interpretation of the primacy of principles in Chinese foreign policy has been the emphasis on long-term goals. According to Chinese leaders, China has pursued a long-term strategy is \\"definitely not swayed by expediency or anybody's instigation or provocation.\\" In keeping with the view of Chinese foreign policy as constant and unvarying, Chinese pronouncements often describe their policy with words such as \\"always\\" and \\"never.\\" An example of how certain principles have provided a framework of continuity for Chinese foreign policy since 1949 has been found in the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence embodied in an agreement signed by China and India in 1954. The five principles played an important role in the mid-1950s, when China began to cultivate the friendship of newly independent nations of Asia and Africa. By the time of the Cultural Revolution, however, China was involved in acrimonious disputes with many of these same nations, and their relations could have been described as anything but \\"peacefully coexistent.\\" The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence were reemphasized in the 1980s, were considered the basis for relations with all nations regardless of their social systems or ideology, and were made a part of the 1982 party constitution.  Decision making and implementation  Understanding the intricate workings of a government can be difficult, especially in a country such as China, where information related to leadership and decision making is often kept secret. Although it still was not possible to understand fully the structure of Chinese foreign policy-related governmental and nongovernmental organizations or how they made or implemented decisions, more was known about them by the late 1980s than at any time previously. After 1949 China's foreign relations became increasingly more complex as China established formal diplomatic relations with more nations (see Dates of establishment of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China), joined the United Nations (UN) and other international and regional political and economic organizations, developed ties between the Chinese Communist Party and foreign parties, and expanded trade and other economic relations with the rest of the world. These changes had affected foreign relations in significant ways by the late 1980s. The economic component of China's international relations increased dramatically from the late 1970s to the late 1980s; more ministries and organizations were involved in foreign relations than ever before; and the Chinese foreign policy community was more experienced and better informed about the outside world than it had been previously. Despite the growing complexity of Chinese foreign relations, one fundamental aspect of foreign policy that has remained relatively constant since 1949 is that the decision- making power for the most important decisions has been concentrated in the hands of a few key individuals at the top of the leadership hierarchy. In the past, ultimate foreign policy authority rested with such figures as Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, while in the 1980s major decisions were understood to have depended on Deng Xiaoping. By the late 1980s, Deng had initiated steps to institutionalize decision making and make it less dependent on personal authority, but this transition has not yet been fully completed. In examining the workings of a nation's foreign policy, at least three dimensions can be discerned: the structure of the organizations involved, the nature of the decision-making process, and the ways in which policy is implemented. These three dimensions are interrelated, and the processes of formulating and carrying out policy have often been more complex than the structure of organizations would indicate. = Government and party organizations = By the late 1980s, more organizations were involved in China's foreign relations than at any time previously. High-level party and government organizations such as the Central Committee, Political Bureau, party Secretariat, party and state Central Military Commissions, National People's Congress, and State Council and such leaders as the premier, president, and party general secretary all were involved in foreign relations to varying degrees by virtue of their concern with major policy issues, both foreign and domestic. The party Secretariat and the State Council together carried the major responsibility for foreign policy decisions. By the 1980s, as China's contacts with the outside world grew, party and government leaders at all levels increasingly were involved in foreign affairs. The president of the People's Republic fulfilled a ceremonial role as head of state and also was responsible for officially ratifying or abrogating treaties and agreements with foreign nations. In addition to meeting with foreign visitors, Chinese leaders, including the president, the premier, and officials at lower levels, traveled abroad regularly. In the late 1980s, the Political Bureau, previously thought of as the major decision-making body, was no longer the primary party organization involved in foreign policy decision making. Instead, the State Council referred major decisions to the Secretariat for resolution and the Political Bureau for ratification. Under the party Secretariat, the International Liaison Department had primary responsibility for relations between the Chinese Communist Party and a growing number of foreign political parties. Other party organizations whose work was related to foreign relations were the United Front Work Department, responsible for relations with overseas Chinese, the Propaganda Department, and the Foreign Affairs Small Group. Of the Chinese government institutions, the highest organ of state power, the National People's Congress, appeared to have only limited influence on foreign policy. In the 1980s the National People's Congress was becoming more active on the international scene by increasing its contacts with counterpart organizations in foreign countries. Through its Standing Committee and its Foreign Affairs Committee, the National People's Congress had a voice in foreign relations matters and occasionally prepared reports on foreign policy- related issues for other party and government bodies. As the primary governmental organization under the National People's Congress, the State Council had a major role in foreign policy, particularly with regard to decisions on routine or specific matters, as opposed to greater questions of policy that might require party involvement. As in the past, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was the most important institution involved in conducting day- to-day foreign relations, but by the 1980s many other ministries and organizations under the State Council had functions related to foreign affairs as well. These included the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of National Defense, Bank of China, People's Bank of China, and China Council for the Promotion of International Trade. In addition, over half of the ministries, overseeing such disparate areas as aeronautics, forestry, and public health, had a bureau or department concerned explicitly with foreign affairs. These offices presumably handled contacts between the ministry and its foreign counterparts. = Ministry of Foreign Affairs = Since 1949 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been one of China's most important ministries. Each area of foreign relations, divided either geographically or functionally, is overseen by a vice minister or assistant minister. For example, one vice minister's area of specialty was the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, while another was responsible for the Americas and Australia. At the next level, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was divided into departments, some geographical and some functional in responsibility. The regionally oriented departments included those concerned with Africa, the Americas and Oceania, Asia, the Middle East, the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, Western Europe, Taiwan and Hong Kong and Macau. The functional departments were responsible for administration, officials, consular affairs, finance, information, international laws and treaties, international organizations and affairs, personnel, protocol, training and education, and translation. Below the department level were divisions, such as the United States Affairs Division under the Department of American and Oceanian Affairs. A recurring problem for the foreign ministry and the diplomatic corps had been a shortage of qualified personnel. In the first years after the founding of the People's Republic, there were few prospective diplomats with international experience. Premier Zhou Enlai relied on a group of young people who had served under him in various negotiations to form the core of the newly established foreign ministry, and Zhou himself held the foreign ministry portfolio until 1958. In the second half of the 1960s, China's developing foreign affairs sector suffered a major setback during the Cultural Revolution, when higher education was disrupted, foreign-trained scholars and diplomats were attacked, all but one Chinese ambassador (to Egypt) were recalled to Beijing, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs itself practically ceased functioning. Since the early 1970s, the foreign affairs establishment has been rebuilt, and by the late 1980s, foreign affairs personnel were recruited from such specialized training programs as the ministry's Foreign Affairs College, College of International Relations, Beijing Foreign Languages Institute, and international studies departments at major universities. Foreign language study still was considered an important requirement, but it was increasingly supplemented by substantive training in foreign relations. Foreign affairs personnel benefited from expanded opportunities for education, travel, and exchange of information with the rest of the world. In addition, specialists from other ministries served in China's many embassies and consulates; for example, the Ministry of National Defense provided military attach√©s, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade provided commercial officers, and the Ministry of Culture and the State Education Commission provided personnel in charge of cultural affairs. = Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade = Since the late 1970s, economic and financial issues have become an increasingly important part of China's foreign relations. In order to streamline foreign economic relations, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade was established in 1982 through the merger of two commissions and two ministries. By the late 1980s, this ministry was the second most prominent ministry involved in the routine conduct of foreign relations. The ministry had an extremely broad mandate that included foreign trade, foreign investment, foreign aid, and international economic cooperation. Through regular meetings with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade participated in efforts to coordinate China's foreign economic policy with other aspects of its foreign policy. It was unclear how thoroughly this was accomplished. = Ministry of National Defense = In any nation, the interrelation of the political and military aspects of strategy and national security necessitates some degree of military involvement in foreign policy. The military's views on defense capability, deterrence, and perceptions of threat are essential components of a country's global strategy. As of the late 1980s, however, little information was available on foreign policy coordination between the military and foreign policy establishments. The most important military organizations with links to the foreign policy community were the Ministry of National Defense and the party and state Central Military Commissions. The Ministry of National Defense provides military attach√©s for Chinese embassies, and, as of 1987, its Foreign Affairs Bureau dealt with foreign attaches and military visitors. Working-level coordination with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was maintained when, for example, high-level military leaders traveled abroad. In addition, the Ministry of National Defense's strategic research arm, the Beijing Institute for International Strategic Studies, carried out research on military and security issues with foreign policy implications. In the late 1980s, the most important link between the military and foreign policy establishments appeared to be at the highest level, particularly through the party and state Central Military Commissions and through Deng Xiaoping, who was concurrently chairman of both commissions. The views of the commissions' members on major foreign policy issues were almost certainly considered in informal discussions or in meetings of other high-level organizations they also belonged to, such as the Political Bureau, the Secretariat, or the State Council. It was significant, though, that compared with earlier periods fewer military leaders served on China's top policy- making bodies since the 1980s. = \\"People-to-People\\" diplomacy = Since 1949 a significant forum for Chinese foreign relations has been cultural or \\"people-to-people\\" diplomacy. The relative isolation of the People's Republic during its first two decades increased the importance of cultural exchanges and informal ties with people of other countries through mass organizations and friendship societies. In some cases, activities at this level have signaled important diplomatic breakthroughs, as was the case with the American-Chinese ping-pong exchange in 1971. In addition to educational and cultural institutions, many other organizations, including the media, women's and youth organizations, and academic and professional societies, have been involved in foreign relations. Two institutes responsible for this aspect of Chinese diplomacy were associated with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and staffed largely by former diplomats: the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries and the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs. = The decision-making process = The most crucial foreign policy decisions in the mid-1980s were made by the highest-level leadership, with Deng Xiaoping as the final arbiter. A shift was underway, however, to strengthen the principles of collective and institutional decision making and, at the same time, to reduce party involvement in favor of increased state responsibility. In line with this trend, the State Council made foreign policy decisions regarding routine matters and referred only major decisions either to the party Secretariat or to informal deliberations involving Deng Xiaoping for resolution. When called upon to make decisions, the Secretariat relied largely on the advice of the State Council and members of China's foreign affairs community. The importance of the Political Bureau appeared to have lessened. Although individual members of the Political Bureau exerted influence on the shaping of foreign policy, the Political Bureau's role as an institution seemed to have become one of ratifying decisions, rather than formulating them. The division between party and government functions in foreign affairs as of the mid-1980s could therefore be summarized as party supremacy in overall policy making and supervision, with the government's State Council and ministries under it responsible for the daily conduct of foreign relations. These high-level decision-making bodies comprised the apex of an elaborate network of party and government organizations and research institutes concerned with foreign policy. To support the formulation and implementation of policy, especially in a bureaucracy as complex and hierarchical as China's, there existed a network of small advisory and coordination groups. These groups functioned to channel research, provide expert advice, and act as a liaison between organizations. Perhaps the most important of these groups was the party Secretariat's Foreign Affairs Small Group. This group comprised key party and government officials, including the president, the premier, state councillors, the ministers of foreign affairs and foreign economic relations and trade, and various foreign affairs specialists, depending on the agenda of the meeting. The group possibly met weekly, or as required by circumstances. Liaison and advisory functions were provided by other groups, including the State Council's Foreign Affairs Coordination Point, the staff of the premier's and State Council's offices, and bilateral policy groups, such as one composed of ministers and vice ministers of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, which met at least every few months. In the late 1980s, the decision-making process for foreign policy matters followed a fairly hierarchical pattern. If a particular ministry was unable to make a decision because the purview of other ministries was involved, it would attempt to resolve the issue through informal discussion or through an interagency group. If that was not successful or if higher-level consideration was needed, the problem might be referred to the Foreign Affairs Coordination Point or to select members of the State Council for review. Certain major decisions would then be discussed by the Foreign Affairs Small Group before consideration by the party Secretariat itself. If the issue was extremely controversial or important, the final decision would be directed to the highest-level leadership.  Relations by region and country Affected by the confluence of a myriad of factors, including its historical legacy, worldview, nationalism, ideology, the decision-making process in Beijing, and the international situation, China's foreign relations have had a rich and varied development in the years since 1949. Two aspects of Chinese foreign policy that have led to wide fluctuations over time are the degree of militancy or peacefulness Beijing has espoused and its ambivalence in choosing between self-reliance and openness to the outside world. Although dividing something as complex as foreign policy into time periods necessarily obscures certain details, Chinese foreign relations can be examined roughly by decades: the Sino-Soviet alliance of the 1950s, isolationism and radicalism in the 1960s, increased international involvement in the 1970s, and the independent foreign policy since the 1980s. During each of these periods, China's relations with the rest of the world underwent significant changes.  Sino-Soviet relations After the founding of the People's Republic, the Chinese leadership was concerned above all with ensuring national security, consolidating power, and developing the economy. The foreign policy course China chose in order to translate these goals into reality was to form an international united front with the Soviet Union and other socialist nations against the United States and Japan. Although for a time Chinese leaders may have considered trying to balance Sino-Soviet relations with ties with Washington, by mid-1949 Mao Zedong declared that China had no choice but to \\"lean to one side\\"‚Äîmeaning the Soviet side. Soon after the establishment of the People's Republic, Mao traveled to Moscow to negotiate the 1950 Sino- Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance. Under this agreement, China gave the Soviet Union certain rights, such as the continued use of a naval base at Luda, Liaoning Province, in return for military support, weapons, and large amounts of economic and technological assistance, including technical advisers and machinery. China acceded, at least initially, to Soviet leadership of the world communist movement and took the Soviet Union as the model for development. China's participation in the Korean War (1950‚Äì53) seemed to strengthen Sino-Soviet relations, especially after the UN- sponsored trade embargo against China. The Sino-Soviet alliance appeared to unite Moscow and Beijing, and China became more closely associated with and dependent on a foreign power than ever before. During the second half of the 1950s, strains in the Sino-Soviet alliance gradually began to emerge over questions of ideology, security, and economic development. Chinese leaders were disturbed by the Soviet Union's moves under Nikita Khrushchev toward de- Stalinization and peaceful coexistence with the West. Moscow's successful earth satellite launch in 1957 strengthened Mao's belief that the world balance was in the communists' favor‚Äîor, in his words, \\"the east wind prevails over the west wind\\"‚Äîleading him to call for a more militant policy toward the noncommunist world in contrast to the more conciliatory policy of the Soviet Union. In addition to ideological disagreements, Beijing was dissatisfied with several aspects of the Sino-Soviet security relationship: the insufficient degree of support Moscow showed for China's recovery of Taiwan, a Soviet proposal in 1958 for a joint naval arrangement that would have put China in a subordinate position, Soviet neutrality during the 1959 tension on the Sino- Indian border, and Soviet reluctance to honor its agreement to provide nuclear weapons technology to China. And, in an attempt to break away from the Soviet model of economic development, China launched the radical policies of the Great Leap Forward (1958‚Äì60), leading Moscow to withdraw all Soviet advisers from China in 1960. In retrospect, the major ideological, military, and economic reasons behind the Sino-Soviet split were essentially the same: for the Chinese leadership, the strong desire to achieve self-reliance and independence of action outweighed the benefits Beijing received as Moscow's junior partner. During the 1960s the Sino-Soviet ideological dispute deepened and spread to include territorial issues, culminating in 1969 in bloody armed clashes on their border. In 1963 the boundary dispute had come into the open when China explicitly raised the issue of territory lost through \\"unequal treaties\\" with the Russian Empire. After unsuccessful border consultations in 1964, Moscow began the process of a military buildup along the border with China and in Mongolia, which continued into the 1970s. The Sino-Soviet dispute also was intensified by increasing competition between Beijing and Moscow for influence in the Third World and the international communist movement. China accused the Soviet Union of colluding with imperialism, for example by signing the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty with the United States in 1963. Beijing's support for worldwide revolution became increasingly militant, although in most cases it lacked the resources to provide large amounts of economic or military aid. The Chinese Communist Party broke off ties with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1966, and these had not been restored by mid-1987. During the Cultural Revolution, China's growing radicalism and xenophobia had severe repercussions for Sino-Soviet relations. In 1967 Red Guards besieged the Soviet embassy in Beijing and harassed Soviet diplomats. Beijing viewed the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 as an ominous development and accused the Soviet Union of \\"social imperialism.\\" The Sino- Soviet dispute reached its nadir in 1969 when serious armed clashes broke out at Zhenbao Island on the northeast border. Both sides drew back from the brink of war, however, and tension was defused when Zhou Enlai met with Alexei Kosygin, the Soviet premier, later in 1969. In the 1970s Beijing shifted to a more moderate course and began a rapprochement with Washington as a counterweight to the perceived threat from Moscow. Sino-Soviet border talks were held intermittently, and Moscow issued conciliatory messages after Mao's death in 1976, all without substantive progress. Officially, Chinese statements called for a struggle against the hegemony of both superpowers, but especially against the Soviet Union, which Beijing called \\"the most dangerous source of war.\\" In the late 1970s, the increased Soviet military buildup in East Asia and Soviet treaties with Vietnam and Afghanistan heightened China's awareness of the threat of Soviet encirclement. In 1979 Beijing notified Moscow it would formally abrogate the long-dormant Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance but proposed bilateral talks. China suspended the talks after only one round, however, following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. In the 1980s, China's approach toward the Soviet Union shifted once more, albeit gradually, in line with China's adoption of an independent foreign policy and the opening up economic policy. Another factor behind the shift was the perception that, although the Soviet Union still posed the greatest threat to China's security, the threat was long-term rather than immediate. Sino-Soviet consultations on normalizing relations were resumed in 1982 and held twice yearly, despite the fact that the cause of their suspension, the Soviet presence in Afghanistan, remained unchanged. Beijing raised three primary preconditions for the normalization of relations, which it referred to as \\"three obstacles\\" that Moscow had to remove: the Soviet presence in of Afghanistan, Soviet support for Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia, and the presence of Soviet forces along the Sino-Soviet border and in Mongolia. For the first half of the 1980s, Moscow called these preconditions \\"third country issues\\" not suitable for bilateral discussion, and neither side reported substantial progress in the talks. Soviet leadership changes between 1982 and 1985 provided openings for renewed diplomacy, as high-level Chinese delegations attended the funerals of Soviet leaders Leonid Brezhnev, Yuriy Andropov, and Konstantin Chernenko. During this time, Sino- Soviet relations improved gradually in many areas: trade expanded, economic and technical exchanges were resumed (including the renovation of projects originally built with Soviet assistance in the 1950s), border points were opened, and delegations were exchanged regularly. The Soviet position on Sino- Soviet relations showed greater flexibility in 1986 with General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev's July speech at Vladivostok. Among Gorbachev's proposals for the Asia-Pacific region were several directed at China, including the announcement of partial troop withdrawals from Afghanistan and Mongolia, the renewal of a concession pertaining to the border dispute, and proposals for agreements on a border railroad, space cooperation, and joint hydropower development. Further, Gorbachev offered to hold discussions with China \\"at any time and at any level.\\" Although these overtures did not lead to an immediate high-level breakthrough in Sino-Soviet relations, bilateral consultations appeared to gain momentum, and border talks were resumed in 1987. Even though Sino-Soviet relations improved remarkably when compare with the two previous decades, China and the Soviet Union would never to resume a formal alliance.  Sino-American relations China's relations with the other superpower, the United States, have like that with the Soviet Union followed an uneven course. Chinese leaders expressed an interest in possible economic assistance from the United States during the 1940s, but by 1950 Sino-American relations could only be described as hostile. During its first two decades the People's Republic considered the United States \\"imperialist\\" and \\"the common enemy of people throughout the world.\\" The Korean War was a major factor responsible for setting relations between China and the United States in a state of enmity and mistrust, as it contributed to the United States policy of \\"containing\\" the Chinese threat through a trade embargo and travel restrictions, as well as through military alliances with other Asian nations. An important side effect of the Korean War was that Washington resumed military aid to Taiwan and throughout the 1950s became increasingly committed to Taiwan's defense, making the possibility of Chinese reunification more remote. After the United States- Taiwan Mutual Defense Treaty was signed in 1954, Taiwan became the most contentious issue between the United States and China, and remained so in the late 1980s, despite the abrogation of the treaty and the subsequent normalization of relations between Beijing and Washington in 1979. In 1955 Premier Zhou Enlai made a conciliatory opening toward the United States in which he said the Chinese people did not want war with the American people. His statement led to a series of official ambassadorial-level talks in Geneva and Warsaw that continued fairly regularly for the next decade and a half. Although the talks failed to resolve fundamental conflicts between the two countries, they served as an important line of communication. Sino-American relations remained at a stalemate during most of the 1960s. Political considerations in both countries made a shift toward closer relations difficult, especially as the United States became increasingly involved in the war in Vietnam, in which Washington and Beijing supported opposite sides. China's isolationist posture and militancy during the Cultural Revolution precluded effective diplomacy, and Sino-American relations reached a low point with seemingly little hope of improvement. Several events in the late 1960s and early 1970s, however, led Beijing and Washington to reexamine their basic policies toward each other. After the Soviet Union's invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 and the Sino-Soviet border clashes in 1969, China saw its major threat as clearly coming from the Soviet Union rather than the United States and sought a closer relationship with Washington as a counterweight to Moscow. When President Richard M. Nixon assumed office in 1969, he explored rapprochement with China as part of his doctrine of reduced United States military involvement in Asia. Moves in this direction resulted in an American ping-pong team's trip to China and Henry A. Kissinger's secret visit, both in 1971, followed by Nixon's dramatic trip to China in 1972. The Shanghai Communique, a milestone document describing the new state of relations between the two countries, and signed by Nixon and Zhou Enlai, included a certain degree of ambiguity that allowed China and the United States to set aside differences, especially on the Taiwan issue, and begin the process of normalizing relations. After the signing of the Shanghai Communique, however, movement toward United States-China normalization during the 1970s saw only limited progress. The United States and China set up liaison offices in each other's capitals in 1973, and bilateral trade grew unevenly throughout the decade. \\"People's diplomacy\\" played an important role, as most exchanges of delegations were sponsored by friendship associations. Chinese statements continued to express the view that both superpowers were theoretically adversaries of China, but they usually singled out the Soviet Union as the more \\"dangerous\\" of the two. In the second half of the 1970s, China perceived an increasing Soviet threat and called more explicitly for an international united front against Soviet hegemony. In addition, rather than strictly adhering to the principle of self-reliance, China adopted an economic and technological modernization program that greatly increased commercial links with foreign countries. These trends toward strategic and economic cooperation with the West gave momentum to Sino-United States normalization, which had been at an impasse for most of the decade. Ties between China and the United States began to strengthen in 1978, culminating in the December announcement that diplomatic relations would be established as of January 1, 1979. In establishing relations, Washington reaffirmed its agreement that the People's Republic was the sole legal government of China and that Taiwan was an inalienable part of China. Deng Xiaoping's visit to the United States the following month was symbolic of the optimism felt in Beijing and Washington concerning their strategic alignment and their burgeoning commercial, technical, and cultural relations. In the 1980s United States-China relations went through several twists and turns. By late 1981 China appeared to pull back somewhat from the United States as it asserted its independent foreign policy. Beijing began to express increasing impatience with the lack of resolution on the Taiwan issue. One of the main issues of contention was the Taiwan Relations Act, passed by the United States Congress in 1979, which provided for continuing unofficial relations between Washington and Taipei. In late 1981 China began to make serious demands that the United States set a firm timetable for terminating American arms sales to Taiwan, even threatening to retaliate with the possible downgrading of diplomatic relations. In early 1982 Washington announced it would not sell Taiwan more advanced aircraft than it had already provided, and in August, after several months of intense negotiations, China and the United States concluded a joint communique that afforded at least a partial resolution of the problem. Washington pledged to increase neither the quality nor the quantity of arms supplied to Taiwan, while Beijing affirmed that peaceful reunification was China's fundamental policy. Although the communique forestalled further deterioration in relations, Beijing and Washington differed in their interpretations of it. The Taiwan issue continued to be a \\"dark cloud\\" (to use the Chinese phrase) affecting United States-China relations to varying degrees into the late 1980s. In addition to the question of Taiwan, other aspects of United States- China relations created controversy at times during the 1980s: Sino-American trade relations, the limits of American technology transfer to China, the nature and extent of United States-China security relations, and occasional friction caused by defections or lawsuits. Difficulties over trade relations have included Chinese displeasure with United States efforts to limit imports such as textiles and a degree of disappointment and frustration within the American business community over the difficulties of doing business in China. The issue of technology transfer came to the fore several times during the 1980s, most often with Chinese complaints about the level of technology allowed or the slow rate of transfer. China's dissatisfaction appeared to be somewhat abated by the United States 1983 decision to place China in the \\"friendly, nonaligned\\" category for technology transfer and the conclusion of a bilateral nuclear energy cooperation agreement in 1985. Determining the nature and limits of security relations between China and the United States had been a central aspect of their relations in the 1980s. After a period of discord during the first years of the decade, Beijing and Washington renewed their interest in security-related ties, including military visits, discussions of international issues such as arms control, and limited arms and weapons technology sales. Beginning in 1983, Chinese and United States defense ministers and other high-level military delegations exchanged visits, and in 1986 United States Navy ships made their first Chinese port call since 1949. The United States approved certain items, such as aviation electronics, for sale to China, restricting transfers to items that would contribute only to China's defensive capability. As of the late 1980s, it appeared that American assistance in modernizing China's arms would also be limited by China's financial constraints and the underlying principle of self-reliance. Despite the issues that have divided them, relations between the United States and China continued to develop during the 1980s through a complex network of trade ties, technology-transfer arrangements, cultural exchanges, educational exchanges (including thousands of Chinese students studying in the United States), military links, joint commissions and other meetings, and exchanges of high-level leaders. By the second half of the 1980s, China had become the sixteenth largest trading partner of the United States, and the United States was China's third largest; in addition, over 140 American firms had invested in China. High-level exchanges, such as Premier Zhao Ziyang's visit to the United States and President Ronald Reagan's trip to China, both in 1984, and President Li Xiannian's 1985 tour of the United States demonstrated the importance both sides accorded their relations.  Relations with the developing world Although committed to good relations with the nations of the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America, in the twenty-first century China finds perhaps the greatest value in these areas as markets and sources of raw materials. The years of solidarity with revolutionary movements in these regions have long been replaced by efforts to cultivate normal diplomatic and economic relations.  Relations with the developed world Since 1949 China's overriding concerns have been security and economic development. In working toward both of these goals, China has focused on its relations with the superpowers. Because most of the developed world, with the exception of Japan, was relatively distant from China and was aligned formally or informally with either the Soviet Union or the United States, China's relations with the developed world often have been subordinate to its relations with the superpowers. In the 1950s China considered most West European countries \\"lackeys\\" of United States imperialism, while it sided with Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. As China's relations with the superpowers have changed, so have its ties with other developed nations. An example of this is that more than a dozen developed countries, including the Germany, Spain, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand, all established diplomatic relations with China after the Sino-American rapprochement in the early 1970s. The developed nations have been important to China for several reasons: as sources of diplomatic recognition, as alternative sources of trade and technology to reduce reliance on one or the other superpower, and as part of China's security calculations. In the 1980s China stressed the role of developed nations in ensuring peace in an increasingly multipolar world. Australia and Canada were important trading partners for China, but Beijing's most important relations with the developed world were with Japan and Europe. = Japan = Japan has been by far the most important to China of the developed nations. Among the reasons for this are geographical proximity and historical and cultural ties, China's perception of Japan as a possible resurgent threat, Japan's close relations with the United States since the end of World War II, and Japan's role as the second-ranked industrialized power in the world. Japan's invasion and occupation of parts of China in the 1930s was a major component of the devastation China underwent during the \\"century of shame and humiliation.\\" After 1949 Chinese relations with Japan changed several times, from hostility and an absence of contact to cordiality and extremely close cooperation in many fields. One recurring Chinese concern in Sino-Japanese relations has been the potential remilitarization of Japan. At the time of the founding of the People's Republic, Japan was defeated and Japanese military power dismantled, but China continued to view Japan as a potential threat because of the United States presence there. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance included the provision that each side would protect the other from an attack by \\"Japan or any state allied with it\\", and China undoubtedly viewed with alarm Japan's role as the principal United States base during the Korean War. At the same time, however, China in the 1950s began a policy of attempting to influence Japan through trade, \\"people's diplomacy\\", contacts with Japanese opposition political parties, and through applying pressure on Tokyo to sever ties with Taipei. Relations deteriorated in the late 1950s when Chinese pressure tactics escalated. After the Sino-Soviet break, economic necessity caused China to reconsider and revitalize trade ties with Japan. Sino-Japanese ties declined again during the Cultural Revolution, and the decline was further exacerbated by Japan's growing strength and independence from the United States in the late 1960s. China was especially concerned that Japan might remilitarize to compensate for the reduced United States military presence in Asia brought about under President Nixon. After the beginning of Sino-American rapprochement in 1971, however, China's policy toward Japan immediately became more flexible. By 1972 Japan and China had established diplomatic relations and agreed to conclude a separate peace treaty. The negotiations for the peace treaty were protracted and, by the time it was concluded in 1978, China's preoccupation with the Soviet threat led to the inclusion of an \\"anti-hegemony\\" statement. In fewer than three decades, China had signed an explicitly anti-Japanese treaty with the Soviet Union and a treaty having an anti-Soviet component with Japan. From the 1970s into the 1980s, economic relations were the centerpiece of relations between China and Japan. Japan has been China's top trading partner since the 1960s. Despite concern in the late 1980s over a trade imbalance, the volume of Sino-Japanese trade showed no sign of declining. Relations suffered a setback in 1979 and 1980, when China canceled or modified overly ambitious plans made in the late 1970s to import large quantities of Japanese technology, the best- known example involving the Baoshan iron and steel complex in Shanghai. Lower expectations on both sides seemed to have created a more realistic economic and technological partnership by the late 1980s. Chinese relations with Japan during the 1980s were generally close and cordial. Tension erupted periodically, however, over trade and technology issues, Chinese concern over potential Japanese military resurgence, and controversy regarding Japan's relations with Taiwan, especially Beijing's concern that Tokyo was pursuing a \\"two Chinas\\" policy. China joined other Asian nations in criticizing Japanese history textbooks that deemphasized past Japanese aggression, claiming that the distortion was evidence of the rise of militarism in Japan. By the late 1980s, despite occasional outbreaks of tension, the two governments held regular consultations, high-level leaders frequently exchanged visits, Chinese and Japanese military leaders had begun contacts, and many Chinese and Japanese students and tourists traveled back and forth. = Europe = Although it had been the European powers that precipitated the opening of China to the West in the nineteenth century, by 1949 the European presence was limited to Hong Kong and Macau. Europe exerted a strong intellectual influence on modern Chinese leaders (Marxism and Leninism of course originated in Europe), and some leaders, including Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping, studied in Europe early in their careers. Nevertheless, China's geographic distance from Europe, its preoccupation with the superpowers, and the division of Europe after World War II meant that China's relations with European nations usually were subordinate to its relations with the Soviet Union and the United States. East European nations were the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with China in 1949, following the Soviet Union's lead. In the early 1950s, through the Sino-Soviet alliance, China became an observer in the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (Comecon), and Chinese relations with Eastern Europe included trade and receipt of limited amounts of economic and technical aid. The Sino-Soviet dispute was manifested in China's relations with certain East European countries, especially China's support for Albania's break with the Soviet Union in the late 1950s. After the Sino-Soviet split in the 1960s, the only East European nations maintaining significant ties with China until the late 1970s were Albania, Romania, and Yugoslavia. By the late 1980s, however, as Beijing's relations with Moscow improved and relations with governments and parties on the basis of \\"mutual respect and peaceful coexistence\\" were renewed, China's ties with the other nations of Eastern Europe also had improved noticeably, to include communist party ties. China's ties with Western Europe were minimal for the first two decades of the People's Republic. Several West European nations, mostly in Scandinavia, established diplomatic relations with China in the early 1950s, and Britain and the Netherlands established ties with China at the charg√© d'affaires level in 1954. In the late 1950s, Britain became the first Western nation to relax the trade embargo against China imposed during the Korean War. The establishment of diplomatic relations between China and France in 1964 also provided an opening for trade and other limited Chinese contacts with Western Europe until the 1970s. China's relations with Western Europe grew rapidly in the 1970s, as more nations recognized China and diplomatic relations were established with the European Economic Community in 1975. In the second half of the 1970s, China's emphasis on an international united front against Soviet hegemony led to increased Chinese support for West European unity and for the role of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Ties with Western Europe also were featured prominently in Beijing's independent foreign policy of the 1980s. Furthermore, China's opening up to foreign trade, investment, and technology beginning in the late 1970s greatly improved Sino-European ties. One of the few major problems in China's relations with Western Europe in the post-Mao era was the downgrading of diplomatic ties with the Netherlands from 1981 to 1984 over the latter's sale of submarines to Taiwan.  Role in international organizations  Participation in international organizations is perceived as an important measure of a nation's prestige as well as a forum through which a nation can influence others and gain access to aid programs and sources of technology and information. The People's Republic was precluded from participating actively in most mainstream international organizations for the first two decades of its existence because of its subordinate position in the Sino-Soviet alliance in the 1950s and the opposition of the United States after China's involvement in the Korean War. China repeatedly failed to gain admission to the UN. In 1971 Beijing finally gained China's seat when relations with the United States changed for the better. Taipei's representatives were expelled from the UN and replaced by Beijing's. After becoming a member of the UN, China also joined most UN-affiliated agencies, including, by the 1980s, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. China's willingness, under the policy of opening up to the outside world beginning in the late 1970s, to receive economic and technical assistance from such agencies as the UN Development Program was a significant departure from its previous stress on self-reliance. In 1986 China renewed its application to regain its seat as one of the founding members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. By the late 1980s, China had become a member of several hundred international and regional organizations, both those of major significance to world affairs, including the International Atomic Energy Agency, the World Intellectual Property Organization, and the International Olympic Committee, and associations or societies focused on such narrow subjects as acrobatics or the study of seaweed. Besides providing China a forum from which to express its views on various issues, membership in the 1970s and 1980s in increasing numbers of international groups gave Chinese foreign affairs personnel wider knowledge and valuable international experience. It is notable that by the late 1980s Beijing had not sought formal membership in several important international organizations representative of Third World interests: the Group of 77, the Non-Aligned Movement, and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Despite the emphasis China placed on Third World relations, China's independent foreign policy and special position as a somewhat atypical Third World nation made it seem unlikely in the late 1980s that China would seek more than observer status in these groups. By the second half of the 1980s, China's participation in international organizations reflected the two primary goals of its independent foreign policy: furthering domestic economic development through cooperation with the outside world and promoting peace and stability by cultivating ties with other nations on an equal basis. As expressed by Zhao Ziyang in a 1986 report to the National People's Congress, \\"China is a developing socialist country with a population of over 1 billion. We are well aware of our obligations and responsibilities in the world. We will therefore continue to work hard on both fronts, domestic and international, to push forward the socialist modernization of our country and to make greater contributions to world peace and human progress.\\" See also References External links *The Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the People's Republic of China - Official website *Nigel Harris, The Mandate of Heaven, ch. 15 Foreign relations of China ","title":"History of foreign relations of the People's Republic of China"},{"id":"14363514","text":"Wusu Sannoh is a Sierra Leonean politician.

Harvey was the son of John Harvey an officer killed in action at the Glorious First of June and was related to several senior officers of the period in the distinguished Harvey family. A great-grandson, Francis Harvey won the Victoria Cross in 1916, sacrificing himself to save over 1,000 lives. Early career Edward Harvey was born at the family home in Eastry, Kent to Captain John Harvey and his wife Judith. the second brother of a large family, Harvey was educated at home before joining his father on his ship HMS Brunswick as a \\"gentleman volunteer\\" aged only ten at the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1793. Gaining experience of the service under his father and accompanied by his cousin Thomas Harvey, young Edward was present during the Glorious First of June, when a British Fleet under Admiral Lord Howe engaged a French force several hundred miles out in the North Atlantic.Harvey, Sir Edward, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, J. K. Laughton, Retrieved 26 November 2007 The battle was fought to contest the passage of a grain convoy from the United States to France and although the French lost the battle, they did give the convoy time to reach the French Atlantic ports. Brunswick suffered greatly in the battle, however, becoming entangled with the French ship Vengeur du Peuple and both ships taking terrible damage, the Vengeur sinking soon afterwards and Brunswick only just reaching home with hundreds of dead and wounded. Amongst the latter was Harvey's father, who died in Portsmouth of severe wounds on 30 July. Edward and his elder brother John both benefited from the celebrity attached to the family after their father's heroic death and Edward was sent to join John and Thomas aboard HMS Prince of Wales, the flagship commanded by their uncle Admiral Henry Harvey. Napoleonic Wars When the company of Prince of Wales was broken up in 1797, Edward was dispatched to the frigate HMS Beaulieu which was engaged at the Battle of Camperdown soon afterwards. In the battle British ships of all sizes were engaged in stopping a Dutch fleet intended to aid the invasion of Ireland and the battle was fought close inshore so that many of the Dutch ships were wrecked in the aftermath of the action. Beaulieu came through the action largely unscathed however and in the next few years Harvey, as a midshipman, followed his elder brother John into the frigates HMS Southampton and HMS Amphitrite. In 1801 Harvey was made lieutenant and over the next seven years was constantly engaged in the North Sea and the Mediterranean in a variety of ships. In 1808 he was promoted to commander and took on his first independent command, the sloop HMS Cephalus. In 1811 Harvey was again promoted to post captain and took command of the frigate HMS Topaze on his first commission. The ship paid off in 1812 and Harvey spent the next eighteen years pursuing interests ashore. During this time he married a Miss Cannon from Deal, Kent, with whom he had six children. The eldest was named Henry for his uncle and later became a captain in the Royal Navy. Return to the sea In 1830 after a lengthy retirement, Harvey took to the sea again in command of the frigate HMS Undaunted off South Africa and the East Indies. In 1838 he commanded the ship of the line HMS Malabar in the West Indies and he subsequently commanded HMS Implacable in the Mediterranean. During his time in the latter ship, Harvey was engaged in the bombardment of the Turkish city of Acre during operations against the forces of Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt. In 1847 after another five year retirement, Harvey became a rear-admiral and the following year was appointed superintendent of Malta Dockyard, a posting he held for five years with his flag in HMS Ceylon. During his next retirement in 1853, Harvey continued to climb ranks, being made a vice-admiral in 1854 before being recalled in 1857 as Commander-in- Chief, The Nore until 1860. In reward for these services, Harvey was advanced to full admiral in 1860 and knighted in 1861, being raised to a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath before his death at the family estate in Walmer, Kent in 1865.

He is the founder of Missionary Catechists of Saint Th√©r√®se of the Infant Jesus, and was Bishop of Lucena until his death. He was named as Venerable by Pope Francis on 7 November 2018. Early life Alfredo Mar√≠a Obviar y Aranda was born on 29 August 1889 in Mata√°s na Lupa, Lipa, Batangas to Telesforo Obviar and Florentina Catalina Aranda. He became an orphan at the early age, and was put under the care of his relatives from his mother‚Äôs side.\\"Venerable Alfredo Obviar\\", Oclarim, Semanario Catolico de Macau, November 23, 2018 Obviar received his early religious instruction at the College of St. Francis Xavier in Manila run by the Society of Jesus, where he graduated in 1901. He earned his degree in Bachelor of Arts at Ateneo de Manila in 1914, and proceeded to the University of Santo Tomas Pontifical Seminary for his theological studies. Obviar received the sacerdotal ordination on 15 March 1919. His pastoral ministry began that same year at Luta (now Malvar, Batangas) and he continued as vicar of the cathedral-parish in Lipa from 1927 to 1944. In both parishes, he established Catechetical Centers in the poblaci√≥n and the barrios. He was also Vicar General for the Diocese of Lipa, and was appointed as confessor and chaplain of the Carmelite Monastery of Lipa. Religious life On March 11, 1944 Obviar was appointed as the first Auxiliary Bishop of Lipa.\\"Bishop Alfredo Maria Obviar y Aranda\\", Catholic Hierarchy After 25 years in the ministry, Obviar was appointed to the episcopate on 29 June 1944, with Guglielmo Piani, Apostolic Delegate, as Principal Consecrator, and with Pedro Paulo Santos Songco, Bishop of Caceres (Naga) and C√©sar Marie Guerrero, Titular Bishop of Limisa, Tunisia as Co- Consecrators. He also became Titular Bishop of Lino√´, Turkey from 11 March 1944 to 21 June 1959. When Lino√´ was an active diocese, it was part of the Ecclesiastical Province of Nicaea. On 22 January 1951, Obviar was installed as Apostolic Administrator of the new Diocese of Lucena. Motivated by his great work for catechesis, he founded the Missionary Catechists of St. Therese (MCST) on August 12, 1958.Tubeza, Philip C., \\"Retired Manila Archbishop Gaudencio Cardinal Rosales to make a saint\\", Philippine Daily Inquirer, October 16, 2011 He established the Missionary Catechists of Saint Th√©r√®se of the Infant Jesus (MCST), with the help of Mother Mercy Medenilla, who became the first superior of the MCST, and has four other women. The earliest monastic MCST was founded in San Narciso, Quezon. To compensate for the shortage of priests in the new diocese, Obviar also founded the Our Lady of the Most Holy Seminary which was later renamed as Our Lady of Mount Carmel Seminary, a minor seminary in Sariaya, Quezon. Decades after, a major seminary was founded by the Diocese of Lucena re-institutionalizing the name Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary Seminary. The establishment of this increased the number of priests attending from 1951 to 1975. In the year of his retirement, it had increased by more than 100 priests. Obivar ordained Ricardo Jamin Vidal to the priesthood on St. Patrick's Day, 17 March 1956, in Lucena; Vidal would later become a cardinal and Archbishop Emeritus of the Archdiocese of Cebu. From 11 October 1962 to 8 December 1962, Obviar was a Council Father at the first Session of the Second Vatican Council. After more than 18 years as Administrator, Obviar was declared the first diocesan bishop of the Diocese of Lucena on July 15, 1969.

She was the mayor of Koidu, and a member of the opposition Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP).  Early career  Mary Musa lived and worked in her home city of Koidu, the capital and largest city of the diamond-rich Kono District in the Eastern Province of Sierra Leone, and the country's fourth largest city. She taught and worked in various schools in the area, including the Jaima Secondary School, Koidu Secondary School, and the United Methodist Church Girls School, of which she was the head teacher for 25 years.  Exile and return to Koidu  When the Sierra Leone Civil War broke out, Mary Musa went into exile, returning to Koidu when the war was over. Large parts of the city's infrastructure had been destroyed in her absence, including some of the school buildings where she had taught, and large scale death had left numerous orphans. Musa worked to provide shelter for her own children and several of these orphans, using bricks from the school to build small houses. Following her lead, many of the other teachers assisted with this process.  Political career  Despite considerable opposition, in a traditionally male dominated region, Mary Musa went on to become the first female mayor and chairperson of the Koidu council. Following her appointment, the United States government's USAID agency trained her with a Nation Building course, as well as leadership training.  Personal life and death  Mary Musa married Mr. S.E.K. Musa, a senior civil servant, before the civil war broke out, but when she returned to the country she discovered that her husband had been killed while she was in exile.

Background Edstrom was an immigrant from Vetlanda, J√∂nk√∂ping County, Sweden. In 1880, he immigrated to the United States with his parents, John Peter Edstr√∂m (1829‚Äì1906) and Charlotte Gustavson Edstr√∂m (1833‚Äì1903).

This federal statute regulates the handling of firearms and ammunition as well as acquisition, storage, commerce and maintenance of firearms. In a debate on gun control after a school shooting that killed 15, one weapons expert said that Germany's weapons laws were among the world's strictest, and yet still a shooting that killed 15 was able to happen. Others argued that more control was needed. While gun ownership is widespread, and associations and ranges for shooting sports and the use of historical guns and weapons in festivals are not forbidden, the use of guns for private self-defence is restricted. The German Ministry of the Interior estimated in 2009 that the number of firearms in circulation, legally and illegally, could be up to 45 million. Germany's National Gun Registry, introduced at the end of 2012, counted 5.5 million firearms in use, which are legally owned by 1.4 million people in the country. About 1.5 million sport shooters in several thousand Sch√ºtzenvereinen own and use guns for sport, about 400,000 hunters have a licensed gun, about 300,000 collect guns and about 900,000 own an inherited gun.  History of firearms restrictions in Germany  The Ewige Landfriede (Perpetual Public Peace) ruling of 1495 banned the medieval right of vendetta (Fehderecht) in the Holy Roman Empire (which encompassed what is now Germany). It passed at the Diet of Worms and was enacted by the German king and emperor Maximilian I. In the Holy Roman Empire claims were henceforth no longer to be decided in battle, but through legal process. It established a certain monopoly of the state in the use of organized armed force. The German nationalist movement asked for Volksbewaffnung, a militia system according to the Swiss role model, but failed with those requests in the German revolutions of 1848‚Äì49. However, possession of guns and weapons was not generally restricted, but regulations about carrying arms in public came into use. The general disarming of citizens and a generic gun law was imposed by the Allies after World War I. The law was introduced by the Weimar Republic; actual enforcement was not stringent, and there was no general disarmament immediately after the war. After incidents including the 1920 Kapp Putsch and the 1922 assassination of Walther Rathenau, the law was enforced more strictly. The Weimar Republic saw various Freikorps and paramilitary forces like the Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold, Der Stahlhelm and the Nazi SA. The requirement for trustworthiness of the owner and need for the special purpose of the user (e.g. hunting, sport or self-defence) has been included in German gun laws since then.Historie des Waffenrechts (History of gun law in Germany, website of M√∂nchengladbach Police)  Regulation after the 1919 Treaty of Versailles  The Treaty of Versailles included firearm reducing stipulations. Article 169 targeted the state: \\"Within two months from the coming into force of the present Treaty, German arms, munitions, and war material, including anti-aircraft material, existing in Germany in excess of the quantities allowed, must be surrendered to the Governments of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers to be destroyed or rendered useless.\\"Treaty of Versailles: Articles 159-213; Military, Naval, and Air Clauses Article 177 further banned all civilian use of firearms, any civilian instruction on their use, and any civilian shooting exercises activity, especially banning all organizations or associations from taking part in any such use and/or activity or allowing it to happen, in order to crush down on perceived Prussian militarism of the German people in general. In order to comply with the Versailles Treaty, in 1919 the German government passed the Regulations on Weapons Ownership, which declared that \\"all firearms, as well as all kinds of firearms ammunition, are to be surrendered immediately.\\"Verordnung des Rates der Volksbeauftragen √ºber Waffenbesitz, Reichsgesetzblatt 1919, Volume I, ¬ß 1, page 31‚Äì32. Under the regulations, anyone found in possession of a firearm or ammunition was subject to five years' imprisonment and a fine of 100,000 marks. On August 7, 1920, rising fears whether or not Germany could have rebellions prompted the government to enact a second gun-regulation law called the Law on the Disarmament of the People. It put into effect the provisions of the Versailles Treaty in regard to the limit on military-type weapons. However in spite of their intentions, all these laws failed to effectively put a complete stop to gun use and ownership. To fix this and fully comply to the Treaty, in 1928 the Law on Firearms and Ammunition was enacted. It relaxed gun restrictions as to ownership (but not as to their use and instruction on their use, as these were still illegal according to the Versailles Treaty) and put into effect a strict firearm licensing scheme. Under this scheme, Germans could possess firearms, but were required to have separate permits to do the following: own or sell firearms, carry firearms (including handguns), manufacture firearms, and professionally deal in firearms and ammunition. Furthermore, the law restricted ownership of firearms to \\"... persons whose trustworthiness is not in question and who can show a need for a (gun) permit.\\" Especially car associations lobbied for an easy gun permit for car ownersAllgemeinen Automobil-Zeitung, Jg. 89, 1928, Nr. 49, p. 7. which was granted by the government for drivers traveling often in the countryside.Uwe Fraunholz: Motorphobia.

Gun regulation of the Third Reich  Nazi law to disarm Jews The 1938 German Weapons Act, the precursor of the current weapons law, superseded the 1928 law. As under the 1928 law, citizens were required to have a permit to carry a firearm and a separate permit to acquire a firearm. But under the new law: * Gun restriction laws applied only to handguns, not to long guns or ammunition. The 1938 revisions completely deregulated the acquisition and transfer of rifles and shotguns, and the possession of ammunition.Harcourt, Bernard E (2004) \\"On the NRA, Adolph Hitler, Gun Registration, and the Nazi Gun Laws: Exploding the Culture Wars (A Call to Historians)\\" p 20-21. * The legal age at which guns could be purchased was lowered from 20 to 18. * Permits were valid for three years, rather than one year. * Holders of annual hunting permits, government workers, and NSDAP (the National Socialist German Workers' Party) members were no longer subject to gun ownership restrictions. Prior to the 1938 law, only officials of the central government, the states, and employees of the German Reichsbahn Railways were exempted. * Manufacture of arms and ammunition continued to require a permit, with the proviso that such permits would no longer be issued to any company even partly owned by Jews; Jews could not manufacture or deal in firearms or ammunition. Under both the 1928 and 1938 acts, gun manufacturers and dealers were required to maintain records about purchasers of guns, with serial numbers. These records were to be delivered to a police authority for inspection at the end of each year. The 1938 Regulations Against Jews' Possession of Weapons, which came into force the day after Kristallnacht, (English translation) effectively deprived all Jews living under the Third Reich within the occupied Sudetenland and Austria of the right to possess any form of weapons, including truncheons, knives, firearms and ammunition. Exceptions were made for Jews and Poles who were foreign nationals under ¬ß3 of the act. Halbrook, Stephen P. (2000) \\"Nazi Firearms Law and the Disarming of the German Jews.\\" Arizona Journal of International and Comparative Law, Vol 17. No. 3. p.528.Halbrook, Stephen P. (2000) \\"Nazi Firearms Law and the Disarming of the German Jews.\\" Arizona Journal of International and Comparative Law, Vol 17. No. 3. p.528. Before that, some police forces used the pre-existing \\"trustworthiness\\" clause to disarm Jews on the basis that \\"the Jewish population 'cannot be regarded as trustworthy'\\". Gun laws in Nazi Germany have been the subject of debate in the United States over gun regulations, with various opponents of gun regulation arguing that gun regulations in Nazi Germany helped the Nazis to cement power or to implement the Holocaust. Fact-checkers have described these claims or theories as \\"false\\" or \\"debunked\\". While Jews were subject to having their guns seized, the gun registry was so incomplete that many Jews retained their guns. On the whole, gun laws were actually made less stringent for German citizens who were loyal to Nazi rule. PolitiFact also writes, \\"a lack of guns was not the issue\\" in the rise of the Nazis and the Holocaust.  Current laws  After 1945, even German police officers were initially not allowed to carry firearms. Private ownership of firearms was not allowed until 1956. The legal status returned essentially to that of the Law on Firearms and Ammunition of 1928. The law was thoroughly revised in 1972, when the new restrictive Federal Weapons Act (Bundeswaffengesetz) became effective, partly as a reaction to the terror of the Red Army Faction.Police of North Rhine-Westphalia on History of German Weapons Law (german) It was developed in the Federal Weapons Act of 2002 and by amendments in 2008 and 2009. These laws were the result of a chain of school shootings in Erfurt, Emsdetten and Winnenden. They led to a public debate, in which blame was attributed to various elements of youth culture and society, including violent computer games, television programs, rock music and private gun ownership.Der Spiegel: Winnenden Commentary ‚Äì Do You Know What Your Children Are Doing? The Weapons Act of 2002 increased the age requirements for licensed hunters and competition shooters. It also introduced the requirement of a psychological evaluation for persons under the age of 25 to fulfil the requirement of personal adequacy for large-bore firearms. The first amendment became effective on April 1, 2008. The intention of that amendment was to ban certain kinds of weapons like airsoft-guns, tasers, imitation firearms (Anscheinswaffen) and knives with blades longer than 12 cm from public places. They may still be carried in sealed wrappings and for professional or ceremonial purposes. Their use on private premises and in non- public places like gun clubs is not restricted. The second amendment became effective on July 17, 2009. It introduced routine verifications of safe firearms storage by local firearms control offices at the homes of licensees. It also tightened the conditions for continuous necessity. A constitutional complaint (Verfassungsbeschwerde) was launched against the law, alleging a violation of the inviolability of the home, guaranteed by Art. 13 of the German constitution.Presseerkl√§rung der FvLW e.V. zur Verfassungsbeschwerde The weapons law does not apply to military use of weapons within the Bundeswehr or to the police. The identity cards of German troops and police officers contain a term allowing them to carry weapons. Nonetheless ‚Äì within the military ‚Äì issuance of guns and especially ammunition is very strictly controlled. In Germany the possession of any firearm with a muzzle energy exceeding 7.5 Joule (~5.5 ft¬∑lbf; for comparison, a .22LR cartridge has a muzzle energy of 159 J) requires a valid firearms ownership license for any particular weapon. The current Federal Weapons Act adopts a two-tiered approach to firearms licensing. The law on possession of suppressors follows the firearms they are designed for; if a firearm does not require a license, neither does its suppressor. The only restriction on magazines for firearms in Germany applies to sports shooters: it is unlawful to use a magazine that can hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition when sports shooting with long weapons in Germany. The acquisition and possession of any magazine of any size for any firearm is legal without a license.  Firearms ownership license  A firearms ownership license (Waffenbesitzkarte or WBK), or an entry to an existing WBK, is mandatory for each firearm purchased. It entitles owners to purchase firearms and handle them on their own property and any private property with the property owner's consent. On public premises, a licensed firearm must be transported unloaded and in a stable, fully enclosing, locked container. A weapons ownership license does not entitle the owner to shoot the weapon or carry it on public premises without the prescribed container. Owners must obtain mandatory insurance and a means to securely store the weapon on their premises (a weapons locker). Blanket ownership licenses are issued to arms dealers, firearms experts and ‚Äì with limitations ‚Äì to collectors. In 2010 there were about four million legal private gun owners. A number of criteria must be met before a firearms ownership license is issued: * age 18 years (¬ß 4 WaffG) * trustworthiness (¬ß 5 WaffG) * personal adequacy (¬ß 6 WaffG) * expert knowledge (¬ß 7 WaffG) and * necessity (¬ß 8 WaffG). Inheritors of legal firearms can obtain a permit without having to demonstrate expert knowledge or necessity, but without them the firearm has to be blocked by an arms dealer (¬ß 20 WaffG). An inheritor's license does not include the right to acquire or handle ammunition. Persons who * are convicted felons * have a record of mental disorder or * are deemed unreliable (this includes people with drug or alcohol addiction histories, and known violent or aggressive persons) are barred from obtaining a firearms ownership license. Firearms ownership licenses are issued in three color-coded varieties, depending on the applicants' necessity. While self-defence is usually not accepted as a reasonable grounds for such a license, the following ones are: * Competitive shooting: Members of registered gun clubs who the club attest have been practising at least once a month for at least a year can apply for a green license. These holders may purchase two handguns and three semi-automatic rifles compliant with the club rules. All firearms purchased must be pre- approved beforehand. Shooters wishing to purchase further firearms must acquire another approval from their association for each firearm, stating that the person participated in competitions regularly and is in need of the firearm. Additionally, persons who are members of a gun club that is a member of a shooting association, are issued a yellow License, with which the holder is allowed to own an unlimited number of single-shot and bolt- or lever-action long guns, and single-shot handguns, without having to obtain prior approval or demonstrate individual necessity. However, no more than two firearms may be purchased in any six-month period by a competitive shooter. * Hunting: People who have passed the German hunter's exam and purchased a hunters' license may purchase an unlimited number of long guns not banned for hunting use, which mostly only applied to fully automatic rifles. Hunters do not need prior approval, but have to register the firearm within two weeks from purchase. They are also allowed two handguns, whose purchase has to be pre-approved. More handguns may be purchased if the person provides a genuine reason. * Collecting and firearms' experts: A red license is issued to collectors and firearms experts. With this type of license, all kinds of firearms except \\"forbidden firearms\\" may be purchased without prior approval. While an expert's license is valid for all guns, collectors have to provide a \\"theme\\" of firearms they want to acquire, and are limited to those. Before you get a collectors license in Germany you have to explain to the state why you want to collect those kinds of guns and specifically tell them what kinds of guns you want to collect. Two examples would include WWII guns and guns made by Colt's Manufacturing Company.  Firearms banned from sporting use  The following firearms are banned from sporting use in Germany, and may not be purchased with a license issued for sporting use, but are allowed on hunters' and collectors' licenses: * Handguns with a barrel length of less than 7.62 cm (3 inches) * Semi-automatic long guns with a built-in magazine with a capacity of more than 10 rounds * Semi-automatic firearms that closely resemble a prohibited firearm (see below), if ** the barrel length is less than 42 cm, or ** the weapon is a bullpup design, or ** the shell casing of the ammunition the firearm is designed for is less than 40mm  Firearms that do not require a license  For persons over 18 years of age, a license is not required to own a single-shot percussion firearm developed before January 1, 1871, or to own and carry any muzzle-loader with a flintlock or earlier design. However, the purchase of black powder or similar in order to actually use the firearms requires a license.  Prohibited firearms  Firearms that are prohibited in Germany may not be owned by anyone except with a special license from the Federal Criminal Police Office, which is only given to manufacturers, exporters, and, on rare occasions, collectors. The most important ones are: * Firearms defined as \\"war weapons\\" by the law (tanks, rocket launchers, heavy machine guns) * Fully automatic firearms * Pump-action shotguns, if ** the stock has been replaced by a pistol grip or ** the overall length is less than 95 cm, or ** the barrel length is less than 45 cm. * Firearms designed to look like an everyday object in order to conceal their nature * Handguns made after January 1, 1970 that fire ammunition with a caliber of less than 6.3mm, except those for rimfire ammunition.  Firearms carry permit  Firearms carry permits (Waffenschein) entitle licensees to publicly carry legally owned weapons, whether concealed or not. A mandatory legal and safety class and shooting proficiency tests are required to obtain such a permit. Carry permits are usually only issued to persons with a particular need for carrying a firearm. This includes some private security personnel and persons living under a raised threat level like celebrities and politicians. They are valid up to three years and can be extended. Carrying at public events is prohibited. Licensed hunters do not need a permit to carry loaded weapons while hunting, and unloaded weapons while directly traveling to and from such an activity.  Small firearms carry permit  A small firearms carry permit (Kleiner Waffenschein) was introduced in 2002. It can be obtained without having to demonstrate expert knowledge, necessity or a mandatory insurance. The only requirements are that the applicant be of legal age, trustworthy and personally adequate. It entitles the licensee to publicly carry gas pistols (both of the blank and irritant kind) and flare guns. These types of firearms are freely available to adults; only the actual carrying on public property requires the permit. Similar to the full permit, carrying at public events is prohibited.

The lakes include, from east to west, the Chott el Fedjedj, Chott el Djerid, and Chott el Gharsa. Geography These salt lakes stretch with only two short breaks in a line from the Mediterranean at the Gulf of Gab√®s to the Algerian frontier, which they penetrate for a considerable distance. The French term \\"chott\\" is a transliteration of the Arabic shat, a term for a broad canal, an estuary or lake. These shats however are, strictly speaking, not lakes at all at the present day. They are smooth depressed areas (in the case of the largest, the Shat el Jerid, lying a few feet below the level of the Mediterranean), which for more than half the year are expanses of dried mud covered with a thick incrustation of white or grey salt. This salt covering gives them at a distance the appearance of big sheets of water. During the winter, however, when the effect of the rare winter rains is felt, there may actually be 3 or 4 ft. of water in these shats, which by liquefying the mud makes them perfectly impassable. Otherwise, for about seven months of the year they can be crossed on foot or on horseback. It would seem probable that at one time these shats (at any rate the Shat el Jerid) were an inlet of the Mediterranean, which by the elevation of a narrow strip of land on the Gulf of Gab√®s has been cut off from them. It is, however, a region of past volcanic activity, and these salt depressions may be due to that cause. Man is probably the principal agent at the present day in causing these shats to be without water. All around these salt lakes there are numerous springs, gushing from the sandy hillocks. Almost all these springs are at a very hot temperature, often at boiling point. Some of them are charged with salt, others are perfectly fresh and sweet, though boiling hot. So abundant is their volume that in several places they form actual ever-flowing rivers. Only for the intervention of man these rivers would at all times find their way into the adjoining depressions, which they would maintain as lakes of water. But for a long period past the freshwater streams (which predominate) have been used for irrigation to such a degree that very little of the precious water is allowed to run to waste into the lake basins; so that these latter receive only a few salt streams, which deposit on their surface the salt they contain and then evaporate. This abundant supply of fresh warm water maintains oases of extraordinary luxuriance in a country where rain falls very rarely. Perennial streams of the description referred to are found between the Algerian frontier and Gab√®s on the coast. The town at Gab√®s itself is on the fringe of a splendid oasis, which is maintained by the water of an ever-running stream emptying itself into the sea at Gab√®s after a course of not more than 20 miles. All this region round the shats has been called the \\"Jerid\\" from the time of the Arab occupation. \\"Jerid\\" means in Arabic a \\"palm frond\\" and inferentially \\"a palm grove.\\" The fame of this Belad-el-Jerid, or \\"Country of the Date Palms\\", was so exaggerated during the 17th and 18th centuries that the European geographers extended the designation from this small area in the south of Tunisia to cover much of inner Africa. With this country of Jerid may be included the island of Jerba, which lies close to the coast of Tunisia in the Gulf of Gab√®s. The date palm (Phoenix dactylifera) may be indigenous to this district of the Jerid, as it is to countries of similar description in southern Morocco, southern Algeria, parts of the Tripolitania, Egypt, Mesopotamia, southern Persia and north-western India; but that north of the latitude of the Jerid the date did not grow naturally in Mauretania, just as it was foreign to all parts of Europe, in which, as in true North Africa, its presence is due to the hand of man. To some extent it may be said that true North Africa lies to the north of the Jerid country, which, besides its Saharan, Arabian and Persian affinities, has a touch about it of real Africa, some such touch as may be observed in the valley of the Jordan. In the oases of the Jerid are found several species of tropical African mammals and two or three of Senegalese birds, and the vegetation seems to have as much affinity with tropical Africa as with Europe. In fact, the country between the Matmata highlands and the strait separating Jerba from the mainland is singularly African in the character and aspect of its flora. To the south of the Jerid the country is mainly desert ‚Äî vast unexplored tracts of shifting sand, with rare oases. Nevertheless, all this southern district of Tunisia bears evidence of once having been subject to a heavy rainfall, which scooped out deep valleys in the original table-land, and has justified the present existence of immense watercourses ‚Äî watercourses which are still, near their origin, favoured with a little water. The narrow sandy ridge separating the Chott el Fejej from the Mediterranean Sea brought it to the attention of various geographers, engineers and diplomats. These figures looked to create an inland \\"Sahara Sea\\" by channelling the waters of the Mediterranean into Sahara Desert basins which lay below sea level. A noted proposal to this effect was put forward in the late 1800s by French geographer Fran√ßois √âlie Roudaire and the creator of the Suez Canal, Ferdinand de Lesseps, but stalled after the French government withdrew funding. Later proposals, made as part of Operation Plowshare, posited that nuclear explosives could be used to dig the proposed canal from the Mediterranean to the Chott el Fejej and other below-sea-level basins of the Sahara; these proposals were also fruitless.

He used sleepwalking as a defense against charges of murder, marking the first time in American legal history that this defense was successful in a murder prosecution. Background Tirrell was the son of a family in Weymouth, Massachusetts, married and living with his wife and two children. He was known to be unfaithful, and in 1845 he left his wife to be with Maria Bickford (also married and also in her early 20s), a prostitute living in a Boston brothel. Tirrell fell in love with her, his affection was returned and they became constant companions, living together as husband and wife. Although they were constantly together and traveled together using different names, she never abandoned her profession, much to his dislike. Early one morning, after loud noises emanating from her rooms, Bickford was found brutally murdered. Tirrell, having last been seen with her, was accused of her murder. His parents hired Rufus Choate, a famous Boston attorney who was noted for the innovative defense strategies he employed to acquit his clients. Circumstances On October 27, 1845 Tirrell was alleged to have visited Bickford's bedroom after that evening's last customer had left and, using a razor, slit her throat from ear to ear, so brutally that her head was nearly severed from her body. He also allegedly set three fires in the brothel, which awakened the owner, who discovered the body of Bickford and called the police. As several people had witnessed the entrance and leaving of the brothel by Tirrell, the police began a search but Tirrell had fled. He was arrested on December 6 in New Orleans, Louisiana, and returned to Boston for trial. Public outrage was fed by sensational newspaper accounts describing the evidence against Tirrell. Not only had he left his wife to live with Bickford and was under a charge of adultery, he had been seen on the premises in the hours before the body was found. A bloody razor lay near her body, bits of Tirrell's clothing and his cane were at the crime scene, and fires had been set nearby as if to destroy evidence. Trial Although many witnesses could testify to Tirrell's affair with Bickford and to the presence of Tirrell at the brothel that evening, there were no eyewitnesses to the actual crime. Choate emphasized to the jury that no matter how overwhelming the evidence of Tirrell's presence at the brothel that evening, the evidence was all circumstantial, as no one had seen Tirrell kill Bickford. Moreover, Choate argued, Tirrell had no motive to kill Bickford. Choate set forth two possible explanations for the jury to consider. The first was that Bickford could have committed suicide, that there was no proof that she did not \\"in the frenzy of the moment, with giant strength, let out the scream of life...\\" However, the brutality of the slashing made this explanation implausible, so Choate turned to an alternative explanation, that Tirrell, as a habitual sleepwalker, could have murdered Bickford under the influence of a nightmare or a trance. In the 1840s there were no medical explanations for sleepwalking and medical experts differed over its cause. With oratorial flourish, Choate read to the jury popular treatises with descriptions of violence attributed to sleepwalking, while reminding them that if they returned a guilty verdict, Tirrell would certainly be executed even if there existed a remote chance that he was innocent. Meanwhile, the Boston newspapers sensationalized the trial, arguing that Tirrell was guilty. After less than two hours of deliberation, on March 30, 1846, the jury returned its verdict of not guilty. Significance Rufus Choate convinced the jury that Tirrell did not cut Bickford's throat, or, if he did so, he did it while sleepwalking, under the 'insanity of sleep.' Choate successfully used the same 'insanity of sleep' defense in a second trial to acquit Tirrell on the arson charges for setting fire to the brothel. These acquittals were the first in the history of American law that sleepwalking was successfully used as a defense. Follow-up After being acquitted, Tirrell attempted unsuccessfully to get half of Choate's legal fees refunded on the grounds that his innocence had been obvious. After the notoriety generated by these trials died down, Tirrell lived the remainder of his life in obscurity. Nonetheless, the trials became famous for Choate's successful use of the sleepwalking defense.

He wrote the book On the Gods in Egypt (), based on an apocryphal letter of Alexander the Great to his mother Olympias. He was a contemporary of Euhemerus and explained similarly the human origin of the gods. The early Christian writers, in their controversy with the heathens, refer not infrequently to a Leo or Leon as \\"having admitted that the deities of the ancient gentile world had been originally men, agreeing in this respect with Euhemerus, with whom he was contemporary, or perhaps rather earlier. Augustine, who is most explicit in his notice of him, says he was an Egyptian priest of high rank, \\"magnus antistes\\", and expounded the popular mythology to Alexander the Great, in a manner which, though differing from those, rationalistic explanations received in Greece, accorded with them in making the gods (including even the dii majorum gentium) to have been originally men. Augustine refers to an account of the statements of Leo contained in a letter of Alexander to his mother. It is to be observed, that although Leon was high in his priestly rank at the time when Alexander was in Egypt (b. c. 332‚Äì331), his name is Greek; and Arnobius (Adv.

The final power station, Littlebrook D, ceased operating in March 2015, and has now been demolished. History Littlebrook A The first power station on the site was the coal-fired Littlebrook A Power Station, built by the County of London Electric Lighting Co. in the early 1930s. It was opened in 1939. Coal was initially brought to the station by rail, until a riverside pier was completed. The station was later converted to burn supplementary oil over coal, and remained in use until it closed in 1973, by which time its thermal efficiency was just 16.15 per cent.CEGB Statistical Yearbook (various dates). CEGB, London. The station had six coal-fired boilers, 3 Babcock & Wilcox chain grate and 3 International Combustion pulverised fuel boilers. The steam raised in the boilers was fed to three steam receivers which in turn supplied three steam turbine generators. The boilers had an output capacity of 1,530,000 lb/hr (193 kg/s) of steam. Steam was delivered to the turbines at 600 psi (41.4 bar) and 427¬∞C. Two of the turbines were supplied by CA Parsons at 30 MW each driving a directly coupled air cooled alternator running at 3,000 rpm. The third turbine was supplied by BTH running at 1500 rpm driving a 4-pole air cooled alternator. In its last years the 1500 4 pole alternator was decoupled from its turbine and used as a synchronous compensator thereby providing voltage regulation to its local grid.

Like the A Station, it originally burned coal, but was later converted to burn oil instead. It had a capacity of 120 MW and remained in use until 1975. This 'Station featured several new concepts in power generation design; it incorporated the \\"unit concept\\" whereby boilers directly supply steam to its designated turbine- generator. (Previously boilers \\"pooled\\" steam via a range or receivers to any of the installed turbines). The steam cycle featured \\"reheat\\" where steam exhausting from the initial high-pressure turbine cylinder is routed back through the boiler to be reheated thereby increasing its available energy before being returned to the turbine's intermediate cylinder. There were four International Combustion boilers which had a total output capacity of 1,060,000 lb/hr (132 kg/s) of steam. Steam was delivered to the turbines at 1,285 psi (88.6 bar) and 454¬∞C. Finally the 60 MW Metropolitan Vickers alternators were cooled by pure hydrogen gas which has a far greater cooling effect than air. These features became common in later power station designs utilising turbine generators rated at 120 MW and over. Electricity output from Littlebrook B power station was as follows.

The River Thames is out of shot to the right. The A, B and C Stations were built in line successively further from the Thames. This shows them shortly after the A Station was closed. The D Station was later built to their west. Littlebrook C Littlebrook C Power Station was opened between 1952 and 1956 by the British Electricity Authority and then the Central Electricity Authority (1955-57), and had a total generating capacity output of 240 MW. Like the two earlier plants, it was originally coal-fired, but was converted burn fuel oil by 1958. The station continued operating until it was replaced by the D Station in 1981. This 'Station was built in response to a rapid demand for electricity as the Country emerged from austerity of the post war years. As such it utilised (a standard build) four 60 MW three cylinder non- reheat C A Parsons steam turbine generators supplied from a steam range fed by seven boilers. (The original design specified eight but the last was never built). The oil-fired International Combustion Limited boilers had an output capacity of 2,520,000 lb/hr (317.5 kg/s) of steam which was delivered to the turbines at 900 psi (62 bar) and 482¬∞C.

The station was built by the Cleveland Bridge Company with construction starting in 1976. The first unit commissioning underway by 1981. The 1980s still saw a potential threat from the Cold War, and as such the CEGB designed Littlebrook D as a robust station with high plant redundancy, meaning that the station would have formed a pivotal role should disaster have struck the city of London. At this time, London was still dependent on several smaller generating stations within the city itself. Due to the flexibility of the oil-fired boilers, a cold unit could be synchronised onto the grid within 4 hours; the increased ability to rapidly increase or decrease load formed a significant part of what made the station attractive on a commercial basis. The boilers had an output capacity of 1788 kg/s of steam. Steam was delivered to the turbines at 158.6 bar and 538¬∞C. Five 110,000-tonne fuel oil storage tanks were used to store the heavy fuel oil for the main units, and this fuel was delivered to the site by tankers mooring at one of the site's two jetties on the River Thames. Originally built with three operational units having a design rating of 660 MW MCR (Maximum Continuous Rating), this was increased to 685 MW during commissioning with practically no additional engineering works required which is testament to the robust design standards rigorously upheld by the CEGB. This total generating capacity of 1,370 MW (1,475 MW including open-cycle gas turbines - see below) was enough power to meet the needs of over 2 million people. Unit 3 was held in \\"long term reserve\\" for a number of years prior to the station's closure, mainly due to the wear and tear the boiler experienced during the UK miners strike 1984 to 1985 where oil-fired stations were run aggressively while the base load coal stations were struggling to obtain fuel. During this strike all three units operated simultaneously and continuously throughout, with the exception of a short repair period to Unit 3's boiler, thereby exceeding its design intent by continuously generating 2055 MWSO. This resulted in an annual generation of circa 18 000 GW which may be the unofficial record for the CEGB's 2000 MW class of power station. The remaining two units were still fully operational up to the site's closure, having undergone massive refurbishment investment to increase their efficiency and further improve the quality of emissions from the tall chimney, which was the fourth tallest chimney in the UK. This investment included the addition of an electrostatic precipitator to remove any particulates present in the flue gas before it left the chimney, and later, upgrading the unit control to a modern PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) based system. Littlebrook D was one of a number of stations throughout the UK with black-start capabilities, meaning that it was able to start generating without an external power supply - the station would be one of the first to start generating should the UK experience a partial or complete blackout. Littlebrook D played a vital role in restoring power supplies to the South East of England in the days following the storm force winds of October 1987. The black-start capability was facilitated by the presence of three open-cycle gas turbines (OCGTs), each capable of generating 35 MW, which was sufficient to operate the station auxiliary equipment and allow a main unit to be started. Each OCGT set incorporated two Rolls-Royce Olympus jet engines which are industrial derivatives of those that were used on the Concorde aircraft. As well as providing black-start supplies to the station, the fact that they could synchronise and ramp up to full load in under five minutes means they were used to generate at the request of National Grid Company (who operated the UK electricity grid system) to deal with short- term peaks in demand. Such peaks typically arise during the winter months, where evening demand is higher due to lighting and heating requirements. A further facility provided to the National Grid Company by the OCGTs was one of system protection. They would start automatically should the system frequency (50.0 Hz in the UK) fall to 49.6 Hz, which would indicate that the supply from generation was not sufficient to meet the demand. The National Grid Company are obliged to ensure that there is enough operating reserve available at all times and as such, low frequency events are rare and will only arise where a substantial loss of generation has occurred. A modification was made to one of the units which allowed for alternative fuel trials. Several were trialled at the Littlebrook D site as part of research into generating energy from more sustainable fuel sources. After privatisation in 1991, the station was owned by National Power, and later by its subsidivision Innogy plc. The station was finally owned by RWE npower which is owned by the German energy company RWE. They decided that Littlebrook would \\"opt-out\\" under the Large Combustion Plant Directive, an EU directive aiming to deal with air pollutants created by the combustion of fossil fuels. This essentially meant that Littlebrook D would have to cease to generate after 2015 in its final configuration. The station ceased operating on 31 March 2015. As a result of Littlebrook Power Station D's closure, each nine 185 Tonne sub station transformers were removed from the power station and delivered to Drax Power Station in Selby for refurbishment, this required RoRo Barge shipments, SPMT operations and M25 closures. Littlebrook Power Station was finally demolished by explosion on Friday 30 August 2019. The chimney, the second highest remaining at the time of its demolition, was demolished at 8am on 15 December 2019.

In 2009, JAST USA announced that they had licensed the game for a future English-language release. Plot Demonic creatures exist and manipulate the world behind the scenes (called Narazaru). Some are good and just want to live in the world, while others have grander goals of opening the Demon Gate and make the earth their prize. The main character is Kumon Katsuki, a Japanese college student, who lost his parents in an accident and since then has been cared for by his landlady. He has a strange set of eyes, with one blue eye and one red eye. His little sister Kumon Megumi, goes to boarding school in England, but still comes back to visit him from time to time. His best friend Makimoto Misae has always been supportive of the main character and has stuck by him through thick and thin. Still the main character is an unusual person for he has strange dreams, seeing visions of a beautiful black haired maiden with a black umbrella, who speaks to him in his dreams. This begins to become more prevalent when he starts seeing her in the waking world, and does not understand what is happening to him. This leads him on a path to discovering the existence of the Narazaru and playing a vital role that will either save the world or lead it on the path of destruction.  Characters  Kumon Katsuki (The Hero): The main character of the game appears to be a college student with a tragic past, but, depending on his actions, evolves to play a major role in the fate of the world. In all paths through the game, the Hero eventually gets infused with Demon Blood and gains the power to transform into a Demon/Human hybrid form, giving him superhuman strength, speed and endurance, as well as regenerative abilities, razor sharp talons and the ability to shoot blasts of energy from his hands. He can choose to follow three different paths through the game, depending on which heroine he chooses to trust. Ignis (Protector of Humanity): Ignis is a Demon Hunter with fiery red hair and an attractive figure. She's an expert martial artist and has superb skills with a Katana and numerous other weapons that she uses in her Demon Hunting. Despite not having the superhuman abilities of the Narazaru, she's more than a match in battle for them, using her superb fighting skills to overcome the most dangerous of adversaries. Despite her tough exterior, she's a friendly woman who quickly becomes attracted to the main Hero of the game. However, her flaw is that she's overzealous in her work, and hence has earned enemies even among the Good-aligned demons. Kaze no Ushiro wo Ayumumono (Wolf-Demon): Kazeko is a wolf demon, drawn to the city for some undetermined reason. She's a cute demon girl who looks to be a child, but is probably much older. She possesses a number of demon powers, including those possessed by the Hero, as well as having the ability to transform herself into a wolf. At first, she is an enemy of Ignis, attacking her during their first meeting in the city, likely because she recognizes her as a Demon Hunter and holds a grudge against Ignis. Depending on the Hero's actions, he will either chose Kazeko or Ignis as his mentor. In either case, it is Kazeko who gives the Hero his newfound powers when her blood mingles with his. Kazeko is as playful and immature as a child, but has a good heart and is instrumental in helping the hero on every route.

It was developed by Avro to meet a requirement for a heavy torpedo bomber for the Royal Air Force but was unsuccessful, only two prototypes being built. Design and development The British Air Ministry produced Specification 16/22 in 1922 for a long-range land-based torpedo bomber. The specification required that the aircraft be capable of carrying a 21 in (533 mm) torpedo or an equivalent weight of bombs and produced responses both from Blackburn Aircraft (the Cubaroo) and Avro. Roy Chadwick, chief designer of Avro, initially produced a single-engined design, the Avro 556 powered by a Napier Cub engine, similar to the Cubaroo. This was rejected in favour of a twin-engined aircraft using two Rolls-Royce Condor engines, the Avro Type 557 Ava and winning an order for two prototypes from the Air Ministry. Completed in secret (owing to its armament of a 21 in (533 mm) torpedo, thought to be able to sink the largest warships), the first prototype Ava (serial number N171) flew in mid-1924. The Ava was a three-bay biplane of wooden construction, with the un-cowled engines between the wings. It had a biplane tail, initially fitted with triple rudders, of which the centre rudder was soon removed. The fuselage accommodated two pilots in an open cockpit, with nose and dorsal gun positions and a retractable ventral \\"dustbin\\" gun position that could be manned by the navigator/bomb aimer, who otherwise occupied a large enclosed cabin. The 2,000 lb (910 kg) torpedo or equivalent bomb load were carried on external racks under the fuselage. The Air Ministry dropped its plans to use the 21 in (533 mm) torpedo but Avro continued with construction of the second prototype, which was of all-metal construction but was otherwise similar to the first prototype, flying on 22 April 1927. While a modified version of the Ava was proposed to meet Specification B19/27 for a heavy bomber, it was unsuccessful, no further aircraft being built. Variants ;Ava Mk I : First prototype.

The trigeminal lemniscus is composed of second order neuronal axons in the brainstem. It carries sensory information from the trigeminal system to the ventral posteromedial (VPM) nucleus of the thalamus. This tract was historically considered a cephalic division of the medial lemniscus due to the close proximity of the two ascending tracts. Like the medial lemniscus in the dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway (DCML), that carries mechanosensory information from part of the head and the rest of the body, the trigeminal lemniscus carries mechanosensory information from the face. However, the trigeminal lemniscus also carries pain and temperature sensations from the contralateral orofacial region, just as the spinothalamic tract carries these sensations from the contralateral body. Thus, the trigeminal lemniscus of the head is functionally analogous to both the DCML tracts and the spinothalamic tract of the body.  Divisions  The trigeminal lemniscus contains two main divisions: * The ventral trigeminal tract, consisting of second order neuronal axons from the principal (chief sensory) nucleus and spinal trigeminal nucleus. These fibers cross the midline and ascend to the contralateral thalamus. * The dorsal trigeminal tract, consisting of second order neuronal axons from the principal (chief sensory) nucleus. These fibers do not cross the midline, and ascend to the ipsilateral thalamus. References  Sources  * Anthoney, T. R. (1993).

The show ran weekly, for a little over a year, from November 17, 1973 to December 28, 1974. Originally an hour in length, after 13 weeks it was cut down to half-an-hour due to the difficulty of putting together the very considerable amount of material required for a one-hour show. Original Series The show was created and produced by Michael O'Donoghue. When O'Donoghue left, later producers included Sean Kelly, Brian McConnachie and John Belushi. Performers on the show included John Belushi, Chevy Chase, Bill Murray, John DeBella, Gilda Radner, and Harold Ramis, who was one of the co-writers for the National Lampoon movie Animal House. Other writers and performers on the show included Anne Beatts, Richard Belzer, Christopher Cerf, Brian Doyle-Murray, Joe Flaherty, Christopher Guest, who did many of the show's musical parodies, Ed Subitzky, Douglas Kenney (another co-writer of Animal House) and Bruce McCall. The Radio Hour was recorded in a studio specially built at the National Lampoon offices. The musical theme for the show was co-written and performed by Bob Hoban and Nate Herman. The show was broadcast nationally on 600 different radio stations, but the stations picking it up were free to air it at any time they chose. It proved difficult to get enough advertising to support the series: national sponsors seemed reluctant to take on the show, probably because of the controversial nature of much of its material. When the show folded, several of the performers and writers moved on to Saturday Night Live. Michael O'Donoghue was head writer for the first three seasons of Saturday Night Live, and this may explain why some of the radio show material, such as \\"What if Ed Sullivan Were Tortured?\\", was subsequently re-purposed for television. Ramis and Flaherty instead joined SCTV. Two examples of the sometimes shocking humor of the Radio Hour are sketches featuring game shows entitled \\"Catch it and Keep it\\" (prizes - some quite lethal - are dropped from a great height to the crowd below), and \\"Land a Million\\" (in which a housewife is left alone in an airborne Boeing 747 containing $1 million in cash and a ton of TNT and must answer questions about literature in order to receive tips on how to land the plane safely). Reboot In 2019, the show was rebooted with a new cast, featuring Cole Escola, Jo Firestone, Brett Davis, Alex English, Maeve Higgins, Aaron Jackson, Rachel Pegram, Lorelei Ramirez, Megan Stalter and Martin Urbano. The new show premiered on December 19, 2019 as podcast on ForeverDog, as well as a video series. The reboot is executive produced by Evan Shapiro, Cole Escola, Alex Ramsey, Joe Cilio, and Brett Boham. Producers include Kevin Frakes, Raj Singh, Brandon Tamburri, Jo Firestone, and Ryan Kreston. The video series is directed by Brandon Tamburri and Tracy Soren.{{Cite weburl=https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/national-lampoon-radio-hour- podcast-premieres-december-19 Albums National Lampoon released 5 albums that were created entirely with, or partly with, material from the Radio Hour: * The Missing White House Tapes (1974) * Gold Turkey (1975) * That's Not Funny, That's Sick (1977) * Greatest Hits of the National Lampoon (1978) * National Lampoon White Album (1979).

History and ban by the BBC \\"Spasticus Autisticus\\" was written in 1981 as a protest against the International Year of Disabled Persons, which Dury considered to be patronising. Dury was himself disabled by polio contracted in his youth. Fed up with repeated requests to get involved with charitable causes, Dury wrote an \\"anti-charity\\" song. The song was a cross between a battle cry and an appeal for understanding: \\"Hello to you out there in normal land. You may not comprehend my tale or understand.\\" The repeated refrain \\"I'm Spasticus, I'm Spasticus, I'm Spasticus Autisticus\\" made explicit reference to the line \\"I'm Spartacus\\" from the 1960 film Spartacus. Dury was considering touring under the name \\"Spastic and the Autistics\\" for the record, playing on his disability and the term \\"blockhead\\", but his friend Ed Speight suggested that the song should be about the freed slave of the disabled. The title and lyrics were deliberately provocative, as the word spastic, a name for sufferers of cerebral palsy and then used as the title for the charitable Spastics Society (now known as Scope), was becoming taboo in Britain due to its use as a derogatory term. The BBC deemed the lyrics offensive (\\"I dribble when I piddle 'cos my middle is a riddle\\") and along with other radio stations denied it airplay, The record also received little promotion from the record company. The song was performed live on television and broadcast worldwide during the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Paralympics, by Orbital and members of the Graeae Theatre Company.

Life Giovanni Antonio Serbelloni was born in Milan in 1519 to a prominent family. He was brother of Gabrio (condottiero and general) and Giovan Battista (castellan of Castel Sant'Angelo and later Bishop of Cassano all' Ionio). In 1541 in Milan he received the tonsure and the four minor orders, thus becoming a cleric. His cousin Cardinal Giovanni Angelo Medici renounced in 1557 to the bishopric of Foligno in his favour. He was so elected bishop of Foligno on 7 May 1557, and consecrated bishop on 25 August of that year by the Cardinal Medici. In preparation to this appointment he was ordained deacon on 28 March and priest on 5 April of that year. A turning point in the life of Giovanni Antonio Serbelloni was the elevation of his cousin Giovanni Angelo Medici to the papacy as Pope Pius IV in December 1559. As in use in such age, the Pope trusted for the important political affairs only on his own relatives: this on 31 January 1560 the Pope appointed him Cardinal Priest of San Giorgio in Velabro. In the same consistory also Charles Borromeo, nephew of the Pope, was made cardinal. Living in Rome near the Pope, he was appointed bishop of Novara on 13 March 1560 and Legate (i.e. governor) of Camerino in 26 April 1560. On 7 December 1563 he consecrated bishop St. Charles Borromeo. After the death of Pius IV in 1565, he was appointed governor of Citt√† della Pieve in place of Camerino, a office he held till 1570. He visited his diocese Novara only in 1568, when he held a diocesan synod, remaining for most of the time in Rome. He resigned this diocese in 1574. In his life he changed many cardinal titles before to be appointed Cardinal bishop: on 17 May 1565 he was appointed Cardinal-priest of Santa Maria degli Angeli, a church he helped to build and where he and Pope Pius IV were buried; on 12 April 1570 he passed to San Pietro in Vincoli, on 9 June 1570 to San Clemente, on 3 July 1570 to Sant'Angelo in Pescheria, on 31 July 1577 to Santa Maria in Trastevere. However he remained always known as Cardinal of San Giorgio, his first cardinal appointment. In the last years of his life he rose in rank among the Cardinal-bishops: was appointed bishop of Sabina on 3 July 1578, bishop of Palestrina on 5 October 1578, bishop of Frascati on 4 March 1583, bishop of Porto e Santa Rufina on 11 Dec 1587, and finally bishop of Ostia and Dean of the College of Cardinals on 2 March 1589. Giovanni Antonio Serbelloni died in Rome on 18 March 1591 and was buried in Santa Maria degli Angeli.

He acquired extensive technical experience working as a race mechanic for his elder brother, Graham Birrell. After successfully racing a Singer Chamois 998cc Imp to win Scottish Saloon Car Championships, he started serious racing single seaters at the relatively late age of 24. He began in Formula Vee late in 1967, competing at Ingliston where he led for much of the race before finishing second to Nick Brittan, the leading Formula Vee driver of the time. He moved south and transferred to Formula Ford in 1969, racing against drivers such as Emerson Fittipaldi and James Hunt. He progressed to Formula 3 and Formula 2 in 1970, racing private Brabhams and a Lotus 69.

Origins of the conflict  After the major Bulgarian success in the battle of Tryavna in 1190 their troops launched frequent attacks on Thrace and Macedonia to liberate all Bulgarian lands. The Byzantines could not face the fast Bulgarian cavalry which attacked from different directions on a vast area.

Historia, p. 573  The battle  To distract his attention the Byzantines decided to strike in eastern direction. They assembled the Eastern army under its commander Alexios Gidos and the Western army under its Domestic Basil Vatatzes to stop the dangerous rise of Bulgarian power. Near Arcadiopolis in Eastern Thrace they met the Bulgarian army. After a fierce battle the Byzantine armies were annihilated. Most of Gidos's troops perished and he had to flee for his life, while the Western army was fully slaughtered and Basil Vatatzes was killed on the battlefield.  Aftermath  After the defeat Isaac II Angelos forged an alliance with the Hungarian King Bela III against the common enemy. Byzantium had to attack from the south and Hungary was to invade the north-western Bulgarian lands and take Belgrade, Branichevo and eventually Vidin but the plan failed. In March 1195 Isaac II managed to organize a campaign against BulgariaNicetas Choniates. Historia, p. 587-589 but he was deposed by his brother Alexios III Angelos and that campaign failed as well.

It is located on the banks of the Mississippi River. Golddust is one of the earliest European-American settlements in Lauderdale County. In 1864, the Battle of Fort Pillow was fought about south of Golddust. History Establishment Golddust was founded in the 1820s. It is one of the earliest European-American settlements in Lauderdale County.\\"Golddust\\", Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture Battle of Fort Pillow In 1861, the Confederate States Army built extensive fortifications south of Golddust and named the site for General Gideon J. Pillow. Because of its strategic location overlooking the Mississippi River, the Union Army took control of the fort in 1862 after the Confederates left. The Union Army occupied Tennessee through the end of the war. The Confederates under Major General Nathan Bedford Forrest returned to this site in 1864 in the Battle of Fort Pillow, defeating Union troops and massacring a majority of the black troops among them. Forrest briefly held the fort before leaving again. Fort Pillow State Park is located approximately south of Golddust. Geography Island No. 30 of the Mississippi River is located approximately west of Golddust. The landscape of the area is dominated by the Mississippi River valley, flood plains and cotton fields. Most dwellings in the area are built on stilts to withstand floods. Golddust is situated on the southeastern edge of the New Madrid Seismic Zone, an area with a high earthquake risk. Economy Four Mile Lane in Golddust (2008) Agriculture is the chief source of income in the area surrounding Golddust, especially the cultivation of cotton. After the abolition of slavery, sharecropping was the primary means of income for both black and white families in the area. Sharecroppers cultivated a portion of land in return for a share of the crop when the landowner sold the cotton. Since the early 20th century, mechanization of agriculture caused the loss of many farm worker jobs. Modern machines such as the cotton picker have made manual cultivation obsolete. In the 21st century, most cotton in this area and other crops are cultivated on large industrial farms. As of 2007, there were no industries in Golddust. Dwellings are scattered, some of them abandoned. The borders of the community are unmarked.

On June 9, 1902, Maffi was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Ravenna and Titular Bishop of Caesarea in Mauretania by Pope Leo XIII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following June 11 from Cardinal Lucido Parocchi, with Archbishops Felix-Marie de Neckere and Diomede Panici serving as co-consecrators, at the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls in Rome. Maffi was later advanced to Archbishop of Pisa on June 22, 1903. In addition to his pastoral duties, he was named director and administrator of the Vatican Observatory on November 30, 1904. Pope Pius X created him Cardinal Priest of San Crisogono in the consistory of April 15, 1907. Maffi participated in and was a chief candidate in the 1914 papal conclave, which selected Pope Benedict XV. During World War I, Maffi was known as the \\"War Cardinal\\" for his support of a fight-to-the-finish policy. He also participated in the 1922 conclave, which selected Pope Pius XI. In a 1925 pastoral letter, the Archbishop issued a scathing attack on the Fascist government, which subsequently halted the letter's publication.TIME Magazine. Enemy of Fascism March 23, 1925 A close friend of the Royal Family, in 1930, he presided at the marriage of Crown Prince Umberto of Italy and Princess Marie-Jos√© of Belgium. The Cardinal continued to write numerous scientific and astronomical works, the best known of which is Nei cieli. His love for science once provoked Pisa's outrage, when Maffi proposed to erect a statue of Galileo Galilei, the scientist condemned by the Inquisition as a heretic. Maffi died in Pisa, at age 72. He is buried at the Cathedral of Pisa.

It follows Mara, a young Egyptian girl who takes up a dangerous job as a double spy between two different masters. Characters Teta: A servant that works with Mara and frequently scolds and complains about Mara's doing. Zasha: Mara's master at the beginning of the book. He is a jewel trader and is quite wealthy. He is afraid of Mara's blue eyes, and he beats her and the other servants often. Nahereh: Mara's second master, who buys her from Zasha. He is stone-faced and mysterious. Later, Mara finds out his name, and who he is. He is the brother of Queen Hatshepsut's right-hand man. Sheftu: A man who meets Mara on the boat to Thebes. He is working for the side against Nahereh. She overhears a private conversation about the revolution, and Sheftu, thinking she is a runaway slave, promises to turn her in if she does not work for him. He is guarded and secretive, but can be charming. Nekonkh: The captain of the boat on which they sail, he soon becomes a friend to Sheftu's cause. Inanni: The Babylonian princess whom Mara interprets for as a cover; they soon become friends and confidantes. Hatshepsut: The woman Pharaoh. She is portrayed as a selfish gold waster. She is overthrown by Thutmose (see below) Thutmose: The contender for the throne, he is the rightful heir. Sahure: A juggler who proves himself a traitor to Sheftu and the others. He has a twisted charm about him, but Mara has difficulty describing it in the book. Djedet: priest of the semranic (mummification and burial) Plot The story opens introducing the reader to Nekonkh, an Egyptian river boat captain on the Nile during the rule of Queen Hatshepsut. Nekonkh is on his way to Thebes, carrying his usual cargo and an unusual passenger, a supposed scribe's apprentice named Sheftu who seems to be someone more significant than he claims to be and occasionally alludes to replacing Hatshepsut on the throne with her younger half brother Thutmose, which is dangerous merely to mention. Nekonkh is waiting at the harbor in Menfe for Sheftu to return from an errand in town before the boat misses the tide. Living in the ancient city of Menfe, Mara is a slave with unusual talents; she can read and write, as well as speak Babylonian. She also has bright blue eyes, which is rare in Egypt. Mara's master is tight-fisted when it comes to feeding his slaves, so she augments her diet by sneaking away from her work and stealing bread in the marketplace. One such visit occurs right under Sheftu's nose, during which Mara reveals herself to be both exceptionally clever and, once her master has caught her, fluent in Babylonian. It develops that Sheftu is in Menfe in order to persuade a decorated general out of retirement and to place him in command of the Pharaoh's bodyguard, a mission which he successfully accomplishes. A second man has also observed Mara's antics in the marketplace, and interrupts her master's punishment, buying Mara outright. He later offers Mara the chance of a lifetime: if she will pose as the translator for a Babylonian princess who is betrothed to Prince Thutmose in order to spy on him. If she helps to uncover a suspected plot to place Thutmose on the throne she will gain her freedom and wealth. If she is discovered, she will die. Mara accepts instantly and is given gold with which to pay her passage up the river to Abydos, where she will don her disguise as an interpreter and meet the princess. Mara secures passage on Nekonkh's boat, where she befriends Sheftu. Nekonkh, meanwhile, has suspected that Sheftu must be involved in a rebellion, and asks Sheftu if he may join it. Sheftu accepts Nekonkh's services, and reveals himself as one of the richest and most powerful men in Egypt. Sheftu allows their conversation to be overheard by Mara, who he guesses must have run away from her master. Sheftu plans to use Mara as a messenger for the rebellion, which Mara willingly agrees to do, even going so far as to suggest that she pose as an interpreter for the Babylonian princess. Sheftu gives Mara a ring with which to bribe a friend (whom Mara has fabricated) into helping her establish herself as the interpreter. Mara enjoys her life at court so much that she decides to delay betraying Sheftu to her master, another powerful Egyptian aristocrat. She carries messages for Sheftu and throws small bits of information to her new master, Lord Nahereh, enough to keep him satisfied of her usefulness but not enough to reveal Sheftu. Sheftu invites Mara to an inn in Thebes where he meets with other rebels; here he is able to pass messages to her more easily and they spend a great deal of time together. Mara accidentally reveals the name of the inn to Nahereh, but he authorizes her to visit it and make friends with members of the plot to see if she can learn anything. As time goes on, Mara finds herself sympathizing more and more with Sheftu and the prince's cause, while also slowly falling in love with Sheftu. After a plan to gain more gold to bribe officials and pay for the rebellion nearly goes awry, Sheftu declares his love for Mara, but also discovers that she still has the ring that he gave her on the boat. Sheftu begins to suspect Mara's duplicitousness, and decides to set a trap for her to confirm his suspicions. Unfortunately for Mara, someone else takes the bait and springs the trap, leaving Sheftu with no choice but to murder Mara. Mara is able to escape him in an alley near the inn, and flees back to her quarters at the palace. At the same time, Mara's cover with Nahereh is blown when he informs her that he was having her watched by another spy, and that he knows she was visiting the rebels' meeting place before he ordered her to go. She is locked in her rooms at the palace, but not before she discovers Nahereh's plans to raid the inn. Mara escapes the palace with the help of the Babylonian princess, whom she has befriended, and runs back to the inn to warn the others. Her warning comes just in time, and everyone is able to escape the inn with the exception of Mara herself, who is captured when Nahereh's soldiers arrive. Mara is taken to the palace for interrogation, but claims not to know the leader of the rebellion, despite a harsh beating and offers of freedom and riches. Elsewhere in the city, Sheftu realizes that though Mara has been playing both sides, she has only been truly loyal to the rebellion, so he goes to her interrogation, planning to persuade Hatshepsut of its pointlessness. Sahure, a juggler who plays at both the Inn of the Falcon and at Nahereh's dinner parties, has also made an appearance at the interrogation, revealing himself as the spy who took the bait in the trap meant for Mara. Sahure identifies Sheftu as the leader in the rebellion, and is able to prove his claim by describing a bracelet that Sheftu is always wearing. All seems lost until the army, under the command of the general Sheftu persuaded out of retirement, as well as a large number of nobles, priests, and others storm the palace. The rebellion is successful, and Thutmose takes the throne, allowing Hatshepsut to die by her own hand (she drinks a goblet of poison). The sun rises on a new day for Egypt as Sheftu and Mara go home to Sheftu's grand house on the river.

He formed the folk-rock band Lindisfarne with Alan Hull in 1970, and wrote \\"Meet Me on the Corner\\", a UK Top 5 hit in March 1972, which won Clements an Ivor Novello Award. Lindisfarne broke up in 1973 and Clements became a founding member of Jack the Lad, also working with Ralph McTell and Bert Jansch. Lindisfarne reformed in 1977 and Clements continued to be part of the line-up until 2003. Rod rejoined Lindisfarne in 2015 and is currently touring and performing with the band. Career Clements was an only child, and grew up in a household in which neither parent was especially active musically, though his mother did play the piano. His father was a lover of classical music and he encouraged his son to attend concerts. Clements attended The King's School, Tynemouth after which, at the age of 12, he was sent to Durham School. He subsequently attended Durham University (St. Cuthbert's Society), graduating with a BA in ancient history and anthropology. From an early age he had been able to pick up a tune and play it and his first inspiration to play the guitar came from hearing the hits of Duane Eddy, The Shadows and The Ventures. By 1965 he had formed an R&B; group called Downtown Faction.History of Lindisfarne lindisfarne.co.uk As a bass guitarist, Clements teamed up with local musicians in North Shields to form a blues band (also called the Downtown Faction). The band was later renamed Brethren, and became regular performers at folk clubs in the North East. Clements befriended a Newcastle singer/songwriter called Alan Hull, and formed the folk-rock band Lindisfarne with him and several members of Brethren in 1970. Although Hull was Lindisfarne's main songwriter, Clements provided the band with its first hit in \\"Meet Me on the Corner\\", a UK Top 5 hit in March 1972. Clements won a Certificate of Honour at the Ivor Novello Awards for the song. Lindisfarne broke up in 1973 and Clements became a founding member of Jack the Lad, which also included two other former Lindisfarne members, on whose debut album It's Jack The Lad he played a significant role as multi-instrumentalist and songwriter. In 1974 he played bass on Ralph McTell's \\"Streets of London\\", which topped the UK charts at Christmas that year. Clements went on to tour and record several albums with McTell. He also worked with Bert Jansch, touring Britain and Europe and working as Producer on Bert's comeback album A Rare Conundrum. Clements and Jansch also recorded a Woody Guthrie tribute album, Woody Lives!, and the jointly credited Leather Launderette. Lindisfarne reformed in 1977 and Clements continued to be part of the line-up, contributing many songs to albums such as Back and Fourth, The News, Sleepless Nights and Dance Your Life Away. Following Alan Hull's death in 1995 Rod became the band's main songwriter who, in partnership with producer and co- writer Nigel Stonier, provided the bulk of material for Lindisfarne's two last albums, Here Comes The Neighbourhood (1998) and Promenade (2002). The band finally broke up following a concert in Newcastle Opera House in November 2003. Clements' main role in Lindisfarne was that of bassist until 1990, when he moved to slide guitar and mandolin; his former role was filled thereafter by Steve Cunningham and latterly Ian Thomson. Clements also played violin from time to time, most notably in the instrumental break of \\"Fog on the Tyne\\", both on stage and on disc. Clements has also toured and recorded with Rab Noakes and Michael Chapman and performed on albums by Peter Hammill, Wizz Jones and Kathryn Tickell amongst others. He has also supplied bass, dobro, and guitar parts to albums by singer/songwriter Thea Gilmore, who has herself appeared on Rod's solo albums. Clements released the album One Track Mind in 1994, and followed this with Stamping Ground in 2000, having written or co- written each of the tracks. Another album, Odd Man Out was released in 2006. It was produced by Nigel Stonier. Spring 2008 saw the reissue with bonus tracks of One Track Mind. He continues to tour regularly, performing a mixture of Lindisfarne songs and his solo efforts. Songs written by Clements have been covered by artists including Melanie Safka and Joe Brown; and a Clements/Stonier composition, \\"Can't Do Right For Doing Wrong\\", was a British Top 30 hit for Erin Rocha at Christmas 2003.

The principal dancers were Vivi Flindt, his wife, as Salome; Jonny Eliasson as John the Baptist; and Lizzie Rhode as Herodias.

Joint concert of Hortus Musicus and Ellerhein choir in Brussels, 2008. Hortus Musicus is an Estonian ensemble that was established in 1972 by Andres Mustonen, a violin student of the Tallinn State Conservatory. Hortus Musicus specialises in performing early music, including 8th‚Äì15th-century European forms such as Gregorian Chant, Organum, Medieval Liturgic Hymns and Motets, the Franco-Flemish School, and Renaissance Music (including French chansons, villanelles and Italian madrigals). The group also presents early, non-European styles including Indian Ragas, Israeli temple songs, Arabian mughams and Jewish music. The group's repertoire has also included pieces by 20th-century composers (often created specially for Hortus Musicus, e.g. by Arvo P√§rt). Hortus Musicus has given concerts in the US, Turkey, Japan, and Israel, and has performed at several major early music festivals. They have recorded approximately 35 programmes, a portion of which is available from companies such as Erdenklang, Musica Svecia, Forte and Finlandia Records.

The battle ended with a Byzantine victory.  Origins of the conflict  The news of the successes of the uprising of Peter Delyan, which broke out in the beginning of 1040 in Belgrade, soon reached Armenia, where many Bulgarian nobles were resettled after the fall of the First Bulgarian Empire in 1018. The most influential of these was Alusian, the second son of the last Bulgarian Emperor Ivan Vladislav (1015‚Äì1018). Dressed as a mercenary soldier he went to Constantinople from where he got to Bulgaria despite the strict control.  The battle  His arrival would mean more tensions in the rebel camp because Alusian could also claim the throne and he kept his origin in secret until he found supporters. Peter II Delyan welcomed his cousin although he knew that Alusian might be a potential candidate for his crown. Peter II gave Alusian a 40,0000-strong army to attack Thessalonica, the second largest city in the Byzantine Empire. Alusian proved to be an incapable general: when he reached the city he attacked the Byzantine army with his tired troops. The Bulgarians could not fight effectively and were defeated. They suffered heavy casualties - 15,000 perished in the battle. Alusian fled from the battlefield, leaving his army behind.  Aftermath  The catastrophe at Thessalonica worsened the relations between Peter Delyan and Alusian. The latter was ashamed from the defeat and Delyan suspected treason. Alusian decided to act first and after a feast in the beginning of 1041 he blinded the Emperor. After that Alusian tried to continue the rebellion, but defeated once more, he decided to change sides and abandoned his army again, an act that was richly rewarded in Constantinople. Although blind, Peter Delyan faced the Byzantines with the rest of the Bulgarian army but was defeated in the battle of Ostrovo later that year and the uprising was crushed.

The US Department of Defense has defined direct action as \\"Short-duration strikes and other small-scale offensive actions conducted as a special operation in hostile, denied, or politically sensitive environments and which employ specialized military capabilities to seize, destroy, capture, exploit, recover, or damage designated targets. Direct action differs from conventional offensive actions in the level of physical and political risk, operational techniques, and the degree of discriminate and precise use of force to achieve specific objectives.\\" The US military and many of its allies consider DA one of the basic special operations missions. Some units specialize in it, such as the Navy SEALs and 75th Ranger Regiment, and other units, such as US Army Special Forces, have DA capabilities but focus more on other operations. Unconventional warfare, special reconnaissance and direct action roles have merged throughout the decades and are typically performed primarily by the same units. For instance, while US Army Special Forces were originally created for unconventional warfare (UW) missions and gradually added other capabilities, the US Navy SEALs, and the UK Special Air Service (SAS) and Special Boat Service (SBS) continue to perform a primary DA role with special reconnaissance (SR) as original missions. The SEALs, SAS, and SBS added additional capabilities over time, responding to the needs of modern conflict. Russia's Spetsnaz combines DA and SR units. Under the US Central Intelligence Agency's National Clandestine Service, there is a Special Activities Division to operate without apparent national identification for plausible deniability.

The ruins of the fortress were uncovered in 2007, near the Israeli city of Beit Shemesh, from Jerusalem. It covers nearly and is encircled by a 700-meter-long (2,300 ft) city wall constructed of stones weighing up to eight tons each. Excavations at site continued in subsequent years.Israel Antiquities Authority, Excavators and Excavations Permit for Year 2008, Survey Permit # G-39; Excavators and Excavations Permit for Year 2009, Survey Permit # G-14; Excavators and Excavations Permit for Year 2010, Survey Permit # G-27 A number of archaeologists, mainly Yosef Garfinkel and Saar Ganor, have claimed that it might be the biblical city of Sha'arayim, because of the two gates discovered on the site, or Neta'im and that the large building at the center is an administrative building dating to the reign of King David, where he might have lodged at some point. This is based on their conclusions that the site dates to the early Iron IIA, ca. 1025‚Äì975 BCE, a range which includes the biblical date for the Kingdom of David. Others suggest it might represent either a North Israelite, Philistine or Canaanite fortress, a claim rejected by the archaeological team that excavated the site.Julia Fridman, 'Crying King David: Are the ruins found in Israel really his palace? ,' at Haaretz, 26 August 2013.\\"Not all agree that the ruins found in Khirbet Qeiyafa are of the biblical town Shaarayim, let alone the palace of ancient Israel's most famous king.\\" The team's conclusion that Khirbet Qeiyafa was a fortress of King David has been criticised.http://qeiyafa.huji.ac.il/eshbaal2.asp Settlement periods Iron Age II is the period identified through most findings. The top layer of the fortress shows that the fortifications were renewed in the Hellenistic period. In the Byzantine period, a luxurious land villa was built on top of the Iron Age II palace and cut the older structure in two. Names The meaning of the Arabic name of the site, Khirbet Qeiyafa, is uncertain. Scholars suggest it may mean \\"the place with a wide view.\\" In 1881, Palmer thought that Kh. K√Æ√¢fa meant \\"the ruin of tracking foot-steps\\".Palmer, 1881, p. 308 The modern Hebrew name, , or the Elah Fortress was suggested by Foundation Stone directors David Willner and Barnea Levi Selavan at a meeting with Garfinkel and Ganor in early 2008. Garfinkel accepted the idea and excavation t-shirts with that name were produced for the 2008 and 2009 seasons. The name derives from the location of the site on the northern bank of Nahal Elah, one of six brooks that flow from the Judean mountains to the coastal plain. Geography Aerial view View of Tel Azeka from Khirbet Qeiyafa, Israel. Top wall is later; lower walls from Iron Age site. Note plastered room interior wall. The Elah Fortress lies just inside a north-south ridge of hills separating Philistia and Gath to the west from Judea to the east. The ridge also includes the site currently identified as Tel Azekah. Past this ridge is a series of connecting valleys between two parallel groups of hills. Tel Sokho lies on the southern ridge with Tel Adullam behind it. The Elah Fortress is situated on the northern ridge, overlooking several valleys with a clear view of the Judean Mountains. Behind it to the northeast is Tel Yarmut. From the topography, archaeologists believe this was the location of the cities of Adullam, Sokho, Azekah and Yarmut cited in . These valleys formed the border between Philistia and Judea. Site and excavation history The site of Khirbet Qeiyafa was surveyed in the 1860s by Victor Gu√©rin who reported the presence of a village on the hilltop.Khirbet Ka√Øafa, in Gu√©rin, 1869, pp. 331‚Äì332 In 1875, British surveyors noted only stone heaps at Kh. Kiafa.Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, p. 118 In 1932, Dimitri Baramki, reported the site to hold a watchtower associated with Khirbet Quleidiya (Horvat Qolad), east. The site was mostly neglected in the 20th century and not mentioned by leading scholars. Yehuda Dagan conducted more intense surveys in the 1990s and documented the visible remains. The site raised curiosity in 2005 when Saar Ganor discovered impressive Iron Age structures under the remnants. Excavations at Khirbet Qeiyafa began in 2007, directed by Yosef Garfinkel of the Hebrew University and Saar Ganor of the Israel Antiquities Authority, and continued in 2008. Nearly of an Iron Age IIA city were unearthed. Based on pottery styles and two burned olive pits tested for carbon-14 at Oxford University, Garfinkel and Ganor have dated the site to 1050‚Äì970 BCE, although Israel Finkelstein contends evidence points to habitation between 1050 and 915 BCE. The initial excavation by Ganor and Garfinkel took place from August 12 to 26, 2007 on behalf of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem Institute of Archaeology. In their preliminary report at the annual ASOR conference on November 15, they presented a theory that the site was the Biblical Azekah, which until then had been exclusively associated with Tell Zakariya. In 2017, Garfinkel claimed that Joseph Silver, the chief funder of the excavation, while walking around the exterior of the city wall in the SE part with Garfinkel and Ganor, identified features in the city wall similar to the features found by Garfinkel and Ganor in the western gate, and stated that it was a second gate.B.A.R., vol.43, no.1 pp.37-43, 59. This claim was challenged and a \\"cease and desist\\" letter was issued to BAR magazine and Garfinkel as a false claim. In November, with volunteers from the Bnai Akiva youth organization, the area was cleared and an excavation and reconstruction organized by Garfinkel and Ganor \\"yielded\\" the existence of that second gate. It was thought that the identification provided a solid basis for identifying the site as biblical Sha'arayim (\\"two gates\\" in Hebrew). In 2015 a plan to build a neighborhood on the site was cancelled, to enable the archaeological dig to go forward. Debate on United Monarchy Elah fortress walls Discoveries at Khirbet Qeiyafa are significant to the debate on archaeological evidence and historicity of the biblical account of the United Monarchy at the beginning of Iron Age II. Garfinkel said in 2010 that the Qeiyafa excavations support the idea \\"that the kingdom of Judah existed already as a centrally organized state in the tenth century BCE\\".\\"Archaeology: What an Ancient Hebrew Note Might Mean\\", Govier, Gordon, Christianity Today 1/18/2010 Nadav Na‚Äôaman and Ido Koch held that the ruins were Canaanite, based on strong similarities with the nearby Canaanite excavations at Beit Shemesh. Finkelstein and Alexander Fantalkin, maintained that the site shows affiliations with a North Israelite entity. In 2015 Finkelstein and Piasetsky specifically criticised the previous statistical treatment of radio-carbon dating at Khirbet Qeiyafa and also whether it was prudent to ignore results from neighboring sites. Releasing the preliminary dig reports for the 2010 and 2011 digging seasons at Khirbet Qeiyafa, the Israel Antiquities Authority stated: \\"The excavations at Khirbat Qeiyafa clearly reveal an urban society that existed in Judah already in the late eleventh century BCE. It can no longer be argued that the Kingdom of Judah developed only in the late eighth century BCE or at some other later date.\\" Archeologsts, Yosef Garfinkel, Mitka R. Golub, Haggai Misgav, and Saar Ganor rejected in 2019 the possibility that Khirbet Qeiyafa could be associated with Philistines. They wrote: \\"The idea that in this chronological phase the knowledge of writing should be associated with the Philistine city state of Gath can now be rejected. While the various sites in Judah present an impressive assemblage of inscriptions, all we have from the intensive twenty- year excavations at Tell es-Safi (Gath) is one poorly executed inscription of seven letters. Indeed, the city state of Gath, like all other Philistine city states (Ashkelon, Ashdod, Eqron) and all the Canaanite Late Bronze Age city states, managed their administration without the use of writing. On the other hand, the rise of a nation state required the intensification of social, administrative and economic networks and increased the need for communication. Identification In 2010, Gershon Galil of the University of Haifa identified Khirbet Qeiyafa as the \\"Neta'im\\" of , due to its proximity to Khirbet ƒûudrayathe (biblical Gederah). The inhabitants of both cities were said to be \\"potters\\" and \\"in the King's service\\", a description that is consistent with the archeological discoveries at that site. Yehuda Dagan of the Israel Antiquities Authority also disagrees with the identification as Sha'arayim. Dagan believes the ancient Philistine retreat route, after their defeat in the battle at the Valley of Elah (), more likely identifies Sha'arayim with the remains of Khirbet esh-Shari'a. Dagan proposes that Khirbet Qeiyafa be identified with biblical Adithaim (). Nadav Na'aman of Tel Aviv University doubts that Sha'arayim means \\"two gates\\" at all, citing multiple scholarly opinions that the suffix -ayim in ancient place names is not the dual suffix used for ordinary words. The fortifications at Khirbet Qeiyafa predate those of contemporary Lachish, Beersheba, Arad, and Timnah. All these sites have yielded pottery dated to early Iron Age II. The parallel valley to the north, mentioned in Samuel I, runs from the Philistine city of Ekron to Tel Beit Shemesh. The city gate of the Elah Fortress faces west with a path down to the road leading to the sea, and was thus named \\"Gath Gate\\" or \\"Sea Gate.\\" The site is surrounded by a casement wall and fortifications. Garfinkel suggests that it was a Judean city with 500‚Äì600 inhabitants during the reign of David and Solomon. Based on pottery finds at Qeiyafa and Gath, archaeologists believe the sites belonged to two distinct ethnic groups. \\"The finds have not yet established who the residents were,\\" says Aren Maeir, a Bar Ilan University archaeologist digging at Gath. \\"It will become more clear if, for example, evidence of the local diet is found. Excavations have shown that Philistines ate dogs and pigs, while Israelites did not. The nature of the ceramic shards found at the site suggest residents might have been neither Israelites nor Philistines but members of a third, forgotten people.\\" Evidence that the city was not Philistine comes from the private houses that abut the city wall, an arrangement that was not used in Philistine cities. There is also evidence of equipment for baking flat bread and hundreds of bones from goats, cattle, sheep, and fish. Significantly, no pig bones have been uncovered, suggesting that the city was not Philistine or Canaanite. Nadav Na'aman of Tel Aviv University nevertheless associates it with Philistine Gath, citing the necessity for further excavations as well as evidence from Bet Shemesh whose inhabitants also avoided eating pork, yet were associated with Ekron. Na'aman proposed identification with the Philistine city of Gob. Yigal Levin has proposed that the ma'gal (◊û◊¢◊í◊ú) or \\"circular camp\\" of the Israelites which is mentioned in the story of David and Goliath () was described this way because it fitted the circular shape of the nearby Khirbet Qeiyafa. Levin argues that the story of David and Goliath is set decades before Khirbet Qeiyafa was built and so the reference to Israel's encampment at the ma'gal probably does \\"not represent any particular historical event at all\\". But when the story was composed centuries later, the round structure of Khirbet Qeiyafa \\"would still have been visible and known to the author of \\", who \\"guessed its function, and worked it into his story\\". Benyamin Saas, Professor of Archaeology at Tel Aviv university, https://english.m.tau.ac.il/profile/sass analyzed the dating, ethnic and political affiliation of Khirbet Qeiyafa as well as the language of the ostracon. \\"A dating in the Iron I‚ÄìII transition, the mid 10th century, assuming the alphabet has just begun its move out of Philistia then could just make a Jerusalem link and Judahite Hebrew language possible for the ostracon. On such a background Qeiyafa may even be considered Davidic. With the oval plan of its casemate wall crowning a summit, Qeiyafa could be assumed to emulate Jerusalem.\\" Saas concludes.The Khirbet Qeiyafa Ostracon in its Setting Benjamin SASS P:102 Archaeological finds Pottery in situ, 2009 General outline The site consists of a lower city of about 10 hectares and an upper city of about surrounded by a massive defensive wall ranging from tall. The walls are built in the same manner as the walls of Hazor and Gezer, formed by a casemate (a pair of walls with a chamber in between). At the center of the upper city is a large rectangular enclosure with spacious rooms on the south, equivalent to similar enclosures found at royal cities such as Samaria, Lachish, and Ramat Rachel. On the southern slope, outside the city, there are Iron Age rock-cut tombs. The site, according to Garfinkel, has \\"a town plan characteristic of the Kingdom of Judah that is also known from other sites, e.g., Beit Shemesh, Tell en-Nasbeh, Tell Beit Mirsim and Beersheba. A casemate wall was built at all of these sites and the city‚Äôs houses next to it incorporated the casemates as one of the dwelling's rooms. This model is not known from any Canaanite, Philistine or Kingdom of Israel site.\\" The site is massively fortified, \\"including the use of stones that weigh up to eight tons apiece.\\" Marked jar handles \\"500 jar handles bearing a single finger print, or sometimes two or three, were found. Marking jar handles is characteristic of the Kingdom of Judah and it seems this practice has already begun in the early Iron Age IIA.\\" Excavation areas Area \\"A\\" extended 5√ó5 metres and consists of two major layers: Hellenistic above, and Iron Age II below. Area \\"B\\" contains four squares, about 2.5 metres deep from top-soil to bedrock, and also features both Hellenistic and Iron Age layers. Surveys on the surface have also revealed sherds from the early and middle Bronze Ages, as well as from the Persian, Roman, Byzantine, early Islamic, Mameluke and Ottoman periods. I≈°ba øal son of Beda inscription The Hellenistic/upper portion of the wall was built with small rocks atop the Iron-II lower portion, consisting of big boulders in a casemate design. Part of a structure identified as a city gate was uncovered, and some of the rocks where the wall meets this gate are estimated to weigh 3 to 5 tons. The lower phase was built of especially large stones, 1‚Äì3 meters long, and the heaviest of them weigh 3‚Äì5 tons. Atop these stones is a thin wall, c. 1.5 meters thick; small and medium size fieldstones were used in its construction. These two fortification phases rise to a height of 2‚Äì3 meters and standout at a distance, evidence of the great effort that was invested in fortifying the place. Ishba'al inscription In 2012 an inscription in Canaanite alphabetic script was found on the shoulder of a ceramic jar. The inscription read \\"I≈°ba øal son of Beda\\" and was dated to Iron Age IIA. Khirbet Qeiyafa ostracon Artist's rendition of the ostracon =Description= A ostracon, a trapezoid-shaped potsherd with five lines of text, was discovered during excavations at the site in 2008. Hebrew University archaeologist Amihai Mazar said the inscription was very important, as it is the longest Proto-Canaanite text ever found. In 2010 the ostracon was placed on display in the Iron Age gallery of the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. =Content, language, interpretation= ;√âmile Puech Although the writing on the ostracon is poorly preserved and difficult to read, √âmile Puech of the √âcole Biblique et Arch√©ologique Fran√ßaise proposed that it be read: :1 Do not oppress, and serve God ‚Ä¶ despoiled him/her :2 The judge and the widow wept; he had the power :3 over the resident alien and the child, he eliminated them together :4 The men and the chiefs/officers have established a king :5 He marked 60 [?] servants among the communities/habitations/generations and understood the ostracon as a locally written copy of a message from the capital informing a local official of the ascent of Saul to the throne.Leval, Gerard (2012). \\"Ancient Inscription Refers to Birth of Israelite Monarchy.\\" Biblical Archaeology Review. May/June 2012, 41-43, 70. Puech considered the language to be Canaanite or Hebrew without Philistine influence. ;Gershon Galil Gershon Galil of Haifa University proposed the following translation: :1 you shall not do [it], but worship (the god) [El] :2 Judge the sla[ve] and the wid[ow] / Judge the orph[an] :3 [and] the stranger. [Pl]ead for the infant / plead for the po[or and] :4 the widow. Rehabilitate [the poor] at the hands of the king :5 Protect the po[or and] the slave / [supp]ort the stranger. ;Haifa U press release On January 10, 2010, the University of Haifa issued a press release stating that the text was a social statement relating to slaves, widows and orphans. According to this interpretation, the text \\"uses verbs that were characteristic of Hebrew, such as ‚Äò≈õh (◊¢◊©◊î) (\\"did\\") and ‚Äòbd (◊¢◊ë◊ì) (\\"worked\\"), which were rarely used in other regional languages. Particular words that appear in the text, such as almanah (\\"widow\\") are specific to Hebrew and are written differently in other local languages. The content itself, it is argued, was also unfamiliar to all the cultures in the region besides that of Hebrew society. It was further maintained that the present inscription yielded social elements similar to those found in the biblical prophecies markedly different from those current in by other cultures that write of the glorification of the gods and taking care of their physical needs.\\" Gershon Galil claims that the language of inscription is Hebrew and that 8 out of 18 words written on inscription are exclusively biblical. He also claimed that 30 major archeological scholars do support this thesis. ;Rollston and Misgav Other readings are possible, however, and the official excavation report presented many possible reconstructions of the letters without attempting a translation. Cited in According to the epigraphist Haggai Misgav, the language of the ostracon is Hebrew. In contrast to the Qeyafa ostracon, the short inscription known from Tell es-Safi contains Indo-European, not Semitic names.Silvia Schroer / Stefan M√ºnger,Khirbet Qeiyafa in the Shephelah Papers Presented at a Colloquium of the Swiss Society for Ancient Near Eastern Studies Held at the University of Bern, September 6, 2014 P:43 The inscription is written left to right in a script which is probably Early Alphabetic/Proto Phoenician, though Christopher Rollston and Demsky consider that it might be written vertically. Early Alphabetic differs from old Hebrew script and its immediate ancestor. Rollston also disputes the claim that the language is Hebrew, arguing that the words alleged to be indicative of Hebrew either appear in other languages or don't actually appear in the inscription. ;Alan Millard Millard believes the language of the inscription is Hebrew, Canaanite, Phoenician or Moabite and it most likely consists of a list of names written by someone unused to writing. ;Levy and Pluquet Levy and Pluquet, by using a computer-assisted approach, give several readings as a list of personal names. Shrines =Rooms used for cultic purposes= In May 2012 archeologists announced the discovery of three large rooms that were likely used as cultic shrines. While the Canaanites and Philistine practiced their cults in separate temples and shrines, they did not have separate rooms within the buildings dedicated only to religious rituals. This may suggest that the rooms did not belong to these two cultures. According to Garfinkel the decorations of cultic rooms lack any human figurines. He suggested \\"that the population of Khirbet Qeiyafa observed at least two biblical bans, on pork and on graven images, and thus practiced a different cult than that of the Canaanites or the Philistines,\\" =Portable shrines= Three small portable shrines were also discovered. The smaller shrines are boxes shaped with different decorations showing impressive architectonic and decorative styles. Garfinkel suggested the existence of a biblical parallel regarding the existence of such shrines (). One of the shrines is decorated with two pillars and a lion. According to Garfinkel, the style and the decoration of these cultic objects are very similar to the Biblical description of some features of Solomon's Temple. Palace and pillared storehouse On July 18, 2013, the Israel Antiquities Authority issued a press release about the discovery of a structure believed to be King David's palace in the Judean Shephelah. The archaeological team uncovered two large buildings dated to the tenth century BCE, one a large palatial structure and the other a pillared store room with hundreds of stamped storage vessels. The claim that the larger structure may be one of King David's palaces led to significant media coverage, while skeptics accused the archaeologists of sensationalism.\\"3,000-year-old palace in Israel linked to biblical King David.\\" NBC News, July 19, 2013. Retrieved July 23, 2013. Aren Maeir, an archaeologist at Bar Ilan University, pointed out that existence of King David's monarchy is still unproven and some scholars believe the buildings could be Philistine or Canaanite. The massive structure located on a hill in the center of the city was decorated with alabaster imported from Egypt. On one side it offered a view of the two city gates, Ashdod and the Mediterranean, and on the other, the Elah Valley. During the Byzantine era, a wealthy farmer built a home on the site, cutting the palace in two.A King's View of Khirbet Qeiyafa, Jerusalem Post See also * Archaeology of Israel * Biblical archaeology * Biblical Minimalism References Bibliography  External links * AFOB (Archaeological Fieldwork Opportunities Bulletin) Online Listing for Khirbet Qeiyafa * The  æI≈°ba øal Inscription from Khirbet Qeiyafa in Jstor Survey of Western Palestine, Map 17: IAA, Wikimedia commons Exhibited artifacts * \\"In the Valley of David and Goliath.\\" A special exhibition at the Bible Lands Museum in 2016 - 2017.

He spent over twenty years in China and witnessed first-hand warlord power struggles, the growth of Japanese militarism, America's post-war diplomacy, China's civil war, and the profound social change that followed. As a result of this first- hand experience, Price was one of America's foremost authorities on Chinese language, culture, and politics from the early nineteen twenties through the mid nineteen fifties. Early life Price was the son of Baptist missionaries serving in Henzada, Burma. He was born on October 13, 1890, the youngest of four children. After his father died in 1899, he was sent to school at Wayland Academy in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. After high school, he taught in a small, rural school in a German-speaking community in North Dakota. While there, he learned to speak, read and write German. His fluent German helped him get into college, and later qualified him to compete for an appointment in the United States Foreign Service. He attended college at University of Rochester in Rochester, New York, graduating in 1913.\\"Dr. Ernest B. Price\\" San Francisco Chronicle, 22 October 1973\\"Register of the Ernest Batson Price Papers, 1914-1960\\", Hoover Institution Archives, Stanford University, Stanford, California, 11 November 2010. Foreign service After graduation, Price was accepted into the special China branch of the Foreign Service, and posted to China. Upon arrival, he began intensive study of Mandarin, China's official language, with a traditional Chinese scholar. In less than two years he was fluent in Mandarin, and was posted to Tientsin as vice consul. He had met Florence Mary Bentley when he was studying at Rochester. Since state-side leave was not authorized for junior diplomats, he arranged an administrative trip to Yokohama, Japan in 1915. Florence joined him there, and they were married. The Prices spent the next 15 years in China where all five of their children were born. In China, personal friendships were critical, and Price had many influential friends throughout China. He eventually got to know numerous warlords, and dealt with them on a personal basis as he tried to expand American trade without taking sides in China's internal power struggles. The personal relationships that Price built with powerful Chinese leaders provided an important counterbalance to Imperial Japan's growing military presence in China and the influence of Comintern agents like Mikhail Borodin.White, Theodor H., China the Roots of Madness, Norton & Company, New York: 1968 In Canton, Price met Doctor Sun Yat-sen, who later became the first President of the Republic of China. They became good friends and often discussed politics over the bridge table. Their friendship continued even after Price was reassigned to Fuzhou where he served as United States consul.Price, Ernest B., Your Obedient Servant, unpublished manuscript: 1942 Sun Yat-sen personally invited both Price and his wife to his inauguration ceremony staged by the Nationalist government. The United States did not recognize the Nationalist government, choosing instead to retain official ties with the rival government in Peking. Therefore, Price could not attend a Nationalist-sponsored ceremony. Mrs. Price, however, was not a Government official so she did attend, and her detailed report of the event was passed to the United States Department of State in a formal dispatch. In 1920, when he was Assistant Chinese Secretary in the American Legation in Peking, Price was assigned to escort an American trading company's caravan of Model-T Fords from the Chinese border, across the Gobi desert to Urga, Mongolia (now Ulan Bator). While he was responsible for negotiating passage for the American businessmen though the territory of various Chinese warlords, Price was also charged with a secret mission of contacting the United States consul in Irkutsk, Russia. Due to the chaos in Siberia caused by the Bolshevik revolution and the subsequent civil war in Russia, the American consul had not been heard from in many months. Price was successful in both tasks, and returned to China in the company of Roy Chapman Andrews, the well known archeologist and adventurer who is often cited as the inspiration for Indiana Jones. Andrews recounted the journey in this book Across Mongolian Plain.Andrews, Roy Chapman, Across Mongolian Plains, Appleton & Company, New York: 1921 Here is how Andrews recalled one of their travel adventures: > Price and I drove back to Panj-kiang to obtain extra food and water ... We > had gone only five miles when we discovered that there was no more oil for > our motor ... Just then the car swung over the summit of a raise, and we saw > the white tents and grazing camels of an enormous caravan. Of course, > Mongols would have mutton fat and why not use that for oil! The caravan > leader assured us that he had fat in plenty and in ten minutes a great pot > of it was warming over the fire. We poured it into the motor and proceeded > merrily on our way. Andrews also incorporated the true story of Price's hunt for a man-eating tiger in the mountains of southern China into his adventure novel Quest of the Snow Leopard.Andrews, Roy Chapman, Quest of the Snow Leopard, Viking Press, New York: 1957 In 1928, Price was sent to re-open the United States consulate in Nanjing. On 1 June 1929, Price and his wife attended the state burial ceremony for Sun Yat-sen at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum near Nanjing. They were special guests of the Chinese government along with John Van Antwerp MacMurray, the United States Minister to China.Official Publication commemorating the State Burial of the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, National Government of the Republic of China, Nanjing, China, 1 June 1929.Bergere, Marie-Claire (translated from French to English by Janet Llyod), Sun Yat-sen, Stanford University Press, Stanford, California, 1998, pp. 411-412.\\"Trip to attend the reinterment of Sun Yat-sen, 1929\\", Seeley G. Mudd Manuscript Library, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey, posted 3 August 2010, accessed 289 December 2015. Price continued to serve in diplomatic posts throughout China until late 1929 when he left the Foreign Service to become President of China Airways (now China National Aviation Corporation, parent company of Air China), a post he held for two years before returning to the United States to pursue a doctoral degree. Academic career Before beginning his doctoral studies at Johns Hopkins University, Price worked as a Special Assistant to the President of the University of Oregon. While there, he began a lifelong friendship with a young law professor named Wayne Morse whom Oregonians later elected to four terms in the United States Senate. Johns Hopkins awarded Price a PhD in political science in 1933, and published his book, The Russo-Japanese Treaties of 1907-1916 Concerning Manchuria and Mongolia that same year. The book chronicled the remorseless efforts of Japan and Russia to carve up northeast Asia.Price, Ernest B., The Russo-Japanese Treaties of 1907-1916 Concerning Manchuria and Mongolia, Johns Hopkins Press, Baltimore: 1933 In 1935, Price visited Manchukuo, Japan's puppet state in Northeast China, and met with the last Manchu emperor, Pu Yi. His book along with a number of academic articles published in the mid- nineteen thirties when he was a fellow at the Brookings Institution highlighted the threat of Japanese imperialism in Manchuria and China. Price warned that Japan's aggressive policies could lead to a serious international conflict.Peffer, Nathaniel, \\"A Biography of the Manchurian Crisis,\\" New York Herald-Tribune, 27 August 1933\\"The Asiatic Problem,\\" Boston Evening Transcript, 19 July 1933Story, Russell, book review, The Annals, American Academy of Political and Social Science, Philadelphia: September 1934, p. 250Price, Ernest B., \\"The Manchurians and Their New Deal,\\" Pacific Affairs, June 1935 His writing helped initiate the public debate over the \\"China question\\" in the years leading up to World War II. His warnings proved to be both prophetic and timely. In 1936, Doctor Price became director of International House at the University of Chicago. Price spoke three European languages and at least three varieties of Chinese, so he was well suited to host the many distinguished foreign visitors who passed through International House. He also taught Chinese studies in the university's political science department.Foss, Theodore N., ‚ÄúChinese Studies at Chicago‚ÄîA Brief History of the Origin of Chinese Studies at the University of Chicago‚Äù , Tableau, University of Chicago: Spring/Summer 2007, p.5.

However, he also maintained ties with the Office of Strategic Services until it was disbanded in 1945.Office of Strategic Services honorable service certificate signed by Major General William Donovan, U.S. Army, 1 October 1945 Price announcing Japanese surrender in ChinaAfter the atomic bomb was dropped on Japan in August 1945, Price was immediately dispatched to China, and landed with the first wave of American occupation troops. He was assigned as the civil affairs liaison officer on the personal staff of Major General Lemuel C. Shepherd, Jr., commander of the 6th Marine Division. Price was present for the formal surrender of Japanese forces in China on October 25, 1945, and made the first Chinese-language radio announcement of the surrender. In February 1946, he received a Bronze Star medal for his \\"sound advice based on a thorough understanding of the Chinese people and of the civil affairs associated with the occupation of an area in which political and civil government problems were most complex.\\"Bronze Star Medal citation, signed by Major General A. F. Howard, U.S. Marine Corps, 19 January 1946 Following the war, Price remained in China to support the United States ambassador, General Patrick Hurley, and later General George C. Marshall as they tried to negotiate a coalition government that would prevent a bloody civil war between Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist forces and Mao Zedong's communists. Both negotiation efforts ultimately failed; however, General Marshall awarded Price a second Bronze Star for his support. The award cited his \\"keen sense of judgment particularly with regard to the diplomatic behavior demanded while acting in the capacity of liaison officer between high ranking Chinese officials and United States forces.\\"Bronze Star Medal citation, awarded by the Commanding General, U.S. Army Forces, China, forwarded through General A. A. Vandegrift, Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, 14 October 1946 Post-war career Price returned to the United States and was released from active duty in April 1946. However, he remained an officer in the Marine Corps reserve until 1954, ending his military career as a reserve Major. Shortly after leaving active duty, Doctor Price accepted a position with Standard Vacuum Oil Company (now part of Exxon Mobil Corporation). It was the company's intent to expand their oil exploration work into China when the political situation there stabilized. Price became the company's agent in Hong Kong and then Shanghai. He continued working there until the communist revolution forced the company to withdraw from mainland China. Price stayed with the company until he finally retired in 1960. He died on October 20, 1973 in Los Gatos, California. Achievements Doctor Price's diplomatic dispatches, journals, correspondence, speeches, lecture material, and other papers are now in the Hoover Institute archives at Stanford University. A detailed catalog of the archived materials has been compiled by the Institute staff and is available on-line through the California Digital Library. His book, The Russo-Japanese Treaties of 1907-1916 Concerning Manchuria and Mongolia is still available in the reference section of many public policy libraries including the National Defense University library at Fort McNair in Washington, D.C..

Summary Ten years ago, Andrew Farmer (Reed Diamond) married his childhood sweetheart, Beth (Kristin Davis) and the two live in Boston, Massachusetts. Now Andrew is a high-powered literary agent, and his relationship with his wife has not fared as well. After a marital argument about his possible infidelity, Beth runs out at midnight and, whilst trying to retrieve their neighbors' dog in the middle of the street, she is killed by a car, on Christmas Eve. An angel, Lionel (Tim Meadows), gives Andrew the chance to relive the last three days as if his wife was alive. There's a catch: he cannot change the fate of his wife. There's only one gift he can give to save her life and he only has a very short time to figure out what that gift is. So Andrew spends three days trying to make Beth as happy and figure how to keep her alive, while finding out what he would really be losing. Cast * Kristin Davis ... Beth Farmer * Reed Diamond ...

It culminated in the founding of the Smaragdum Thalasses temple, better known as the Whare Ra, the longest-standing temple of the Stella Matutina magical order. Beginnings In 1908 a meeting of over 100 people was held to discuss cultural affairs in nearby Frimley, with Reginald Gardner as one of the main speakers, resulting in the commencement of the \\"Havelock Work\\". The first meetings in 1908 were attended by only half a dozen to a dozen people and consisted of readings from Shakespeare and Dickens in a church schoolroom. From this developed social afternoons and Wednesday night talent shows, then carving and drama classes, flower and fruit shows and arts and crafts exhibitions. A morris dancing side was formed by school children, the first in the country. Festivals A series of elaborate festivals were held. In 1911 the Old English Village Fete was held, opening with a procession of over 100 men, women and children in medieval costume and carrying banners. \\"King Arthur\\" and his court presided over morris and folk dances, tourneys and playlets, and there were stalls selling refreshments and crafts. In 1912 an even more elaborate Shakespearean Pageant was held, opening with a grand procession including \\"Queen Elizabeth\\" and her court and retinue, as well as \\"Shakespeare\\" and his group of players. Entertainments included teas and games, sixteenth century songs and dances, music by the Hastings Town Band and other concerts, a production of Much Ado About Nothing, scenes from Twelfth Night and The Merchant of Venice, and Shakespearean games. That weekend a ball was held in Shakespearean costume. Magazine A magazine called The Forerunner was produced, with its first issue in 1909-03-01. It contained numerous spiritually-inclined and often Theosophically-inspired articles. The first issue stated \\"We all seek expression for the ideals that well up from time to time from the deeps of our eternal self\\". Describing the festivities, an article in one issue stated that \\"they aimed at cultivating a feeling for what is beautiful and true\\"; \\"behind the outward manifestation of things lay the ideal\\"; and \\"it is by the 'power of harmony and the deep power of joy that we see into the life of things'\\". The three prime organisers of the Work, the Gardiners and Harold Large, believed that eastern methods of spiritual training such as Theosophy were unsuitable for westerners, but also felt that the Church had lost the esoteric teachings of Jesus and his disciples. They were determined to undergo rigorous training and initiation to merit learning those hidden teachings. These three were the prime organisers of many of the town's public events, and also meditated together on a daily basis, in which they were soon joined by Miss M. M. McLean and Reginald's sister, Miss Rose Gardiner. Reginald Gardiner considered the Havelock Work to be a cultural society \\"built around this silent power station\\". The meditation group grew, and began to incorporate simple ritual, calling itself the Society of the Southern Cross. Felkin and the Temple In 1910 the Community of the Resurrection at Mirfield sent a mission of help to New Zealand, preaching and conducting retreats. One of the visiting priests was a Father Fitzgerald, whom Miss McLean had met in Britain, and she arranged for him to meet members of the Havelock prayer group. He agreed to be the director of their spiritual work from Britain. After a period of instruction, focussing on an esoteric approach to Christianity, Father Fitzgerald told the group that they had reached a level where personal instruction would be necessary, and he recommended a Dr. Robert Felkin for the task, who was the head of the Stella Matutina. Within a week the group had cabled ¬£300 passage, supplied by Maurice Chambers and his father, Mason, and his uncle John, for Felkin and his family to visit New Zealand for three months. During this visit in 1912 Dr Felkin established the Smaragdum Thalasses Temple of the Stella Matutina, and later emigrated permanently to NZ in 1916, when he took up the day-to-day running of the Temple until his death in 1926. Whare Ra The New Zealand Order became known by the Maori name of Whare Ra or \\"the House of the Sun\\". Foundations of the house at Whare Ra were laid down by the architect Chapman-Taylor, who later became a member of both the Golden Dawn and the Order of the Table Round (Ordo Tabulae Rotundae), a neo-Arthurian mystical and chivalric order also brought to New Zealand by Felkin. The Whare Ra attracted many members of the community, and by 1926 the inner order alone had over 100 members including many of the most wealthy and influential people in Havelock North and Hastings. The outer order numbered over 200 at its peak. It continued to operate until 1978. Another outcome of the Havelock Work, albeit via Whare Ra, was the establishment in 1938 of the Tauhara Trust, which set aside money for the development of a conference centre for spiritual groups, particularly those engaging in meditation, mysticism, the New Age and deep ecology. This conference centre continues to operate, overlooking Acacia Bay in Taupo.

For boats on the river's upper reaches, see Steamboats of the Columbia River, Wenatchee Reach, Steamboats of the upper Columbia and Kootenay Rivers, and Steamboats of the Arrow Lakes. Many steamboats operated on the Columbia River and its tributaries, in the Pacific Northwest region of North America, from about 1850 to 1981. Major tributaries of the Columbia that formed steamboat routes included the Willamette and Snake rivers. Navigation was impractical between the Snake River and the Canada‚ÄìUS border, due to several rapids, but steamboats also operated along the Wenatchee Reach of the Columbia, in northern Washington, and on the Arrow Lakes of southern British Columbia. Types of craft The paddle-wheel steamboat has been described as an economic \\"invasion craft\\" which allowed the rapid exploitation of the Oregon Country, a huge area of the North American continent eventually divided between the United States and Canada, and of Alaska and the Yukon.Affleck, Edward L., A Century of Paddlewheelers in the Pacific Northwest, the Yukon, and Alaska, Alexander Nicholls Press, Vancouver, B.C. 2000 Three basic types of steamboat were used on inland waterways: propeller, side-wheeler, and sternwheeler. Propellers required deeper draft than was commonly available on inland rivers, and side-wheelers required expensive docking facilities. Stern- wheelers were more maneuverable than side-wheelers and could make a landing just about anywhere. For these reasons, the stern-wheeler type was dominant over the propeller and the side-wheeler in almost all inland water routes.Timmen, Fritz, Blow for the Landing, Caxton Printers, Caldwell, ID 1972 Economics of operations Steamboats earned money by charging passengers fares and shippers for carrying cargo. Some vessels managed to carry as many as 500 people together with 500 tons of cargo. Passenger fares varied over time. In the early 1850s, fares for the Eagle, running from Oregon City and Portland, were $5 a trip for passengers and $15 per ton of freight.Corning, Howard McKinley, Willamette Landings, Oregon Historical Society, Portland, OR (2nd Ed. 1973) During a gold rush, passenger fares were $23 for passage from Portland to Wallula, with various other charges, such as meals, in addition. Cargo was charged by the ton and by the distance carried. Sample rates in the early 1860s, following the establishment of a near monopoly on river transit, showed cargo rates running from $15 per ton for the haul from Portland to The Dalles (), and 90 per ton for Portland to Lewiston (501) miles. A ton was not a unit of weight but a unit of volume, with cargo charges based on 40 cubic feet equalling one ton. Various chicaneries were practiced by the steamboat companies to increase the tonnage charges for items shipped. One authority states that gross tonnage was measured at 100 cubic feet to the ton, which would still permit the steamboat companies to fix the \\"ton\\" for customer charges at 40 cubic feet. Steamboat capacity was measured by tonnage. Gross tonnage was the total volume capacity of the boat, while registered tonnage was the total theoretical volume that could be used to carry cargo or passengers once mechanical, fuel and similar areas had been deducted. For example, the sternwheeler Hassalo, built in 1880, was long, and rated at 462 gross tons and 351 registered tons. Steamboat captains often became wealthy men. In 1858, the owners of the Colonel Wright paid her captain, Leonard Wright, $500 per month, an enormous amount of money for the time. Fuel and fuel consumption Mascot, a typical Columbia river steamer, \\"wooding up,\\" circa 1900. Most steamboats burned wood, at an average rate of 4 cords an hour. Areas without much wood, such as the Columbia River east of Hood River, required wood to be hauled in and accumulated at wood lots along the river; eventually provision of fuel wood for steamboats itself became an important economic activity. Commodities shipped Timmen reports that in 1867, Portland's exports totaled $6,463,793, of which about $4 million was gold dust and ingots mined from Idaho and Montana mines to be taken to the San Francisco mint. In 1870, the situation was similar. Other commodities hauled included lumber, agricultural products, salted salmon, and livestock. Once gold mines started winding down, the steamboats on the upper Columbia and Snake rivers carried wheat. Areas of operation Lower, middle, and upper Columbia Portland harbor, probably in the early 1900s, showing tall ships, steamship, and, on right leaving the dock, the sternwheeler Bailey Gatzert Originally, the Columbia River was not considered navigable beyond its confluence with the Snake River just north of the Wallula Gap. This led to the somewhat misleading designations of stretch of the Columbia River from Wallula to its mouth as the lower, middle and upper river, generally defined as: * The \\"lower river,\\" meaning the routes from Astoria upriver to where the Willamette flows into the Columbia, and then up the Willamette to Portland or Oregon City. The lower river also included the run up the Columbia River Gorge from the mouth of the Willamette to the portage (and, later, locks) at the Cascades Rapids. * The \\"middle river,\\" meaning the route from the top of the Cascades to The Dalles, where another set of rapids began, called Celilo Falls, which required another and longer portage. * The \\"upper river\\" meaning the route from Celilo Village, at the top of Celilo Falls, to Wallula Gap, near the mouth of the Snake River. Willamette River The Willamette River flows northwards down the Willamette Valley until it meets the Columbia River at a point from the mouth of the Columbia. In the natural condition of the river, Portland was the farthest point on the river where the water was deep enough to allow ocean- going ships. Rapids further upstream at Clackamas were a hazard to navigation, and all river traffic had to portage around Willamette Falls, where Oregon City had been established as the first major town inland from Astoria. Snake River The Snake River was navigable by steamboat from Wallula up to Lewiston, Idaho. Boats on this run included Lewiston, Spokane, and J.M. Hannaford. Imnaha and Mountain Gem were able to proceed upriver from Lewiston, through the Snake River Canyon, to the Eureka Bar, to haul ore from a mine that had been established there. Discontinuous inland routes on the Columbia Far inland, the Columbia river was interrupted by rapids and falls, so much that it was never made freely navigable once Priest Rapids was reached above Pasco, Washington. There were important steamboat operations on many lakes that ultimately were tributary to the Columbia River, both in the United States and in Canada. These routes included Okanagan Lake, Arrow Lakes, Kootenay Lake and Kootenay River, and lakes Coeur d'Alene and Pend Oreille. Early operations Lower Columbia Lot Whitcomb, circa 1853 Early operations on the Columbia were almost exclusively confined to the lower river. The first steamboat to arrive in Oregon was the Beaver, which was built in England and arrived at Oregon City on May 17, 1836.Mills, Randall V., Sternwheelers up Columbia, University of Nebraska, 1947. In the 1840s and 1850s, ocean-going ships equipped with auxiliary steam engines were able to and did come up the lower river as far as Portland, Oregon and Fort Vancouver. However, no other riverine steamboat worked in the region until the side- wheeler Columbia was launched in early June 1850, at Astoria. Columbia was a basic vessel, built with no frills of any kind, not even a passenger cabin or a galley. Her dimensions were in length, beam, of draft and 75 gross tons. On July 3, 1850, Columbia began her first run from Astoria to Portland and Oregon City. Columbia's first captain was Jim Frost, who had been a pilot on the Mississippi river. It took two days to get to Portland, largely because of the captain's lack of familiarity with the river channel and his resulting caution. After that, Columbia made the Oregon City-Portland-Astoria run twice a month at four miles per hour, charging $25 per passenger and $25 per ton of freight.Gulick, Bill, Steamboats on Northwest Rivers, Caxton Press, at 15-21, Caldwell, Idaho (2004) Columbia held a monopoly on the river until December 25, 1850, when the side-wheeler Lot Whitcomb was launched at Milwaukie, Oregon. Lot Whitcomb was much larger than the Columbia ( long, beam, of draft, and 600 gross tons). and far more comfortable. Her engines were designed by Jacob Kamm, built in the eastern United States, then shipped in pieces to Oregon. Her first captain was John C. Ainsworth, and her top speed was . Lot Whitcomb charged the same rates as the Columbia and readily picked up most of her business. Lot Whitcomb was able to run upriver from Astoria to Oregon City in ten hours, compared to the Columbia's two days. She served on the lower river routes until 1854, when she was transferred to the Sacramento River in California, and renamed the Annie Abernathy. Multnomah The side-wheeler Multnomah made her first run in August 1851, above Willamette Falls. She had been built in New Jersey, taken apart into numbered pieces, shipped to Oregon, and reassembled at Canemah, just above Willamette Falls. She operated above the falls for a little less than a year, but her deep draft barred her from reaching points on the upper Willamette, so she was returned to the lower river in May 1852, where for the time she had a reputation as a fast boat, making for example the run from Portland to Vancouver in one hour and twenty minutes. Another sidewheeler on the Willamette at this time was the Mississippi-style Wallamet, which did not prosper, and was sold to California interests. In 1853, the side-wheeler Belle of Oregon City, an iron-hulled boat built entirely in Oregon, was launched at Oregon City. Belle (as generally known) was notable because everything, including her machinery, was of iron that had been worked in Oregon at a foundry owned by Thomas V. Smith. Belle lasted until 1869, and was a good boat, but was not considered a substitute for the speed and comfort (as the standard was then) of the departed Lot Whitcomb. Also operating on the river at this time were James P. Flint, Allen, Washington, and the small steam vessels Eagle, Black Hawk, and Hoosier, the first two being iron-hulled and driven by propellers. Carrie Ladd, an example of an early sternwheeler of the Columbia River type Jennie Clark, built by Jacob Kamm with John C. Ainsworth as her first captain, was placed in service in February 1855. She was the first sternwheeler on the Columbia River system. Her hull and upper works were built at Milwaukie, while her engines were built in Baltimore to Kamm's specifications, for a price of $1,663.16, and shipped around to the West Coast, which cost another $1,030.02. Kamm and Ainsworth had settled on the sternwheeler as superior to propeller-driven and side-wheel boats. Propellers were too vulnerable to expensive-to-fix damage to propellers and shafts from rocks and other obstructions in the river. Sidewheelers were too difficult to steer and needed expensive dock facilities. Middle Columbia Oneonta, a rare Mississippi-style steamboat on the Columbia Operations on the middle Columbia were hampered by the existence of the Cascades Rapids, which blocked all upriver traffic and substantially impeded everything going downriver. In 1850, Francis A. Chenowith built a mule-drawn portage railway around the rapids on the north side of the river. In 1851, he sold out to Daniel F. and Putnam Bradford, who, together with J.O. Van Bergen built the James P. Flint at the lower end of the Cascades, then winched her along the bank to operate on the middle river up to The Dalles. Business wasn't enough on this run, as overland emigration had fallen off, so in 1852, her owners winched her back down along the bank of the Cascades to the lower river. In September, 1852, the Flint struck a rock and sank, but was raised, equipped with the engines out of the Columbia, and renamed the Fashion. The next steamboat on the middle river was the propeller Allan, which was hauled up over the Cascades from the lower river in 1853. Business increased, so by 1854, Allan's owners were able to put a second boat on the middle river run, the side-wheeler Mary. By 1858, the Bradfords, who had the portage railway on the north side of the Cascades, faced competition on the south side from the Oregon Portage Railroad, also mule-hauled. In 1868, the United States Army Corps of Engineers made the first of what would be many permanent alterations to the river, blasting out rocks at the mouth of the John Day River. In 1877, work began on a canal around the Cascades Rapids, which was completed in 1896. The Dalles-Celilo Canal was completed in 1915. Upper Columbia The portage railroad in 1867 from The Dalles to Celilo. This is looking west towards a feature known as \\"Cape Horn\\" The first steamboat intended for operation above Celilo Falls was the Venture, built near the Cascades, with the objective of hauling her around Celilo and putting her to run on the upper river. This never happened, as upon launch, the Venture was swept over the Cascades, and damaged by hitting a rock on the way down. The Colonel Wright, launched October 24, 1858, at the mouth of the Deschutes River, was the first steamboat to operate on the upper Columbia. In 1860, the owners of Wright built another boat, the Tenino, at Celilo Falls, which proved to be immensely profitable. Eventually the Oregon Steam Navigation Company built a portage railroad on the south side of the river that ran between The Dalles and Celilo. Snake River The Snake River wound through wheat-producing regions of eastern Washington. Farmers in these areas wanted to ship their products out as cheaply as possible, and looked to riverine transport as a way to do it. The problem was there were too many rapids and other obstructions to allow economic use of the river in its natural state. O.S.N. pressured the government to do something about this, and so in 1867, the Corps of Engineers launched a two year survey of the upper Columbia and the Snake River, targeting rapids and other areas for work to improve navigability. During the next few years, rapids and obstructions at various points in both these rivers were removed or meliorated, largely at government expense. Rise of monopoly power over the river Walla Walla Statesman Gaston's 1911 book Portland, Oregon: Its History and Builders, v1.) In about 1860, the Bradford brothers, R.R. Thompson, Harrison Olmstead, Jacob Kamm, and steamboat captains John C. Ainsworth and L.W. Coe formed the Oregon Steam Navigation Company which quickly gained monopoly power over the most of the boats on the Columbia and Snake rivers, as well as the portages at the Cascades and from The Dalles to Celilo. The O.S.N. monopoly lasted from about 1860 to 1879, when its owners sold out to the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company (\\"OR&N;\\") and realized an enormous profit. O.R. & N was an enterprise of Henry Villard and ten partners who raised $6 million in an effort to expand the O.S.N. monopoly to control all rail and steamboat transport in Oregon and the Inland Empire. Purchase of O.S.N. gave Villard and his allies control over just about every steamboat then operating on the Columbia, including all the OSN boats already mentioned, plus Emma Hayward, S.G. Reed, Fannie Patton, S.T.Church, McMinnville, Ocklahama, E.N. Cook, Governor Grover, Alice, Bonita, Dixie Thompson, Welcome, Spokane, New Tenino, Almota, Willamette Chief, Orient, Occident, Bonanza, Champion, and D.S.Baker. Railway completion forces steamboats off routes In April, 1881, O.R.& N. completed railways on the south side of the river from Celilo to Wallula, and, in October 1882, from Portland to The Dalles. This left the middle Columbia expensive to navigate because of the need to surmount two portages on the way upriver. O.R.& N. started bringing its boats down to the lower river from the middle and upper stages, with the strategy of forcing patrons to use its railroads rather than its steamboats. Harvest Queen was taken over Celilo Falls in 1881 from the upper to the middle river under the command of captain Troup. Troup brought D.S. Baker over Celilo in 1888. and in 1893, over the Cascades. Villard, in control of O.R. & N then made one of his biggest mistakes when he brought from the east coast two enormous iron-hulled vessels, Olympian and Alaskan, and placed them on routes on the Columbia and Puget Sound. The huge size and expense of these vessels precluded them from ever making a profit. Opposition to O.R.& N. began to arise in 1881 on the lower and middle Columbia. Captain U.B. Scott formed a concern with L.B. Seely and E.W. Creighton to put Fleetwood, a propeller boat, on the run up to the Cascades. Gold Dust was hauled over the Cascades to compete on the middle river. This competition lowered fares down to 50 cents from Portland to The Dalles. Another competitor which arose in about 1880 was the Shaver Transportation Company. R.R. Thompson and two of her officers As the railroads were building on the south bank of the Columbia neared competition, O.R.& N. withdrew its boats from the middle and upper river. This was done by running the boats over the Cascades and Celilo Falls, generally at high water. In 1881, Captain James W. Troup took Harvest Queen from the upper river over Celilo Falls into the middle river. In 1890 Captain Troup took her over the Cascades into the lower river. Troup brought D.S. Baker over Celilo Falls in 1888, and then over the Cascades in 1893. Hassalo runs the Cascades of the Columbia, May 26, 1888, at a speed of almost 60 miles per hour In one famous incident, on May 26, 1888, Troup brought Hassalo over the Cascades at close to an hour as 3,000 people watched. By 1893, the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company had completed a route all along the south side of the river. As a result, steamboating virtually ended on the Columbia and Snake Rivers above the Dalles, at least until November 1896, when the Cascade Locks and Canal were completed, allowing open river navigation all the way from Portland to The Dalles.Newell, Gordon R., Ed., H.W.Curdy Marine History of the Pacific Northwest, at 5, Superior Publishing, Seattle, WA 1966 (\\"McCurdy\\") Lock and canal improvements to the river Dalles City and another sternwheeler (possibly Harvest Queen) in Cascade Locks As rail competition grew, and forced steamboats off their old routes, shippers and steamboat lines began agitating Congress to allocate funds for improvements to the river, in the form of canals and locks, that would restore their competitive position relative to the railroads. The two main improvements on the Columbia were the Cascade Locks and Canal, completed in 1896, and the Celilo Canal and Locks, completed in 1915. While these projects did open the river first to The Dalles, and then all the way to Wallula, there was no long-term improvement for the steamboats' position in their losing competition against the railroads. Late steamboat operations T.J. Potter on lower Columbia river, following reconstruction in 1901. By 1899, although rail competition had become severe, new steamboats continued to be built, including some of the fastest and most well-designed vessels. In that year, Altona was rebuilt for the Yellow Stack line, and a brand new Hassalo was launched for the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company. The new Hassalo reached an hour during trials, supposedly the fastest in the world, although this was disputed by her rivals. Regulator was rebuilt, and way upstream, at Potlatch, Idaho, the J.M. Hannaford was launched, unusual as she was built in the Mississippi style, with two stacks forward of her pilot house, instead of the single stack aft, as was the design for the vast majority of other Columbia River boats ever since the Jennie Clark. Several boats were rebuilt in 1900, and in 1901, newly constructed vessels included the Charles R. Spencer, an elegant passenger vessel intended for the Portland-The Dalles run, whose whistle was reportedly so powerful it could \\"make rotten piles totter.\\" The Charles R. Spencer had to have been built prior to May 28, 1896. The Library of Congress has a stereograph copyrighted on that date of the Charles R. Spencer and the Bailey Gatzert. Inquire to the Library of Congress for reproduction number LC-USZ62-54736, Sternheelers in Cascade Locks 1896. Other new vessels included the freighter/towboats F.B. Jones, and M.F. Henderson. As with other years, several vessels were reconstructed.McCurdy, at 48 and 70 Last years Regulator in Cascade Locks, with Bailey Gatzert waiting to enter, probably circa 1905 By 1915, steamboat operations had dropped sharply, and the only boats regularly running on the Columbia above Vancouver were few, mainly the Bailey Gatzert and the Dalles City, with the Bailey running excursions and passenger traffic from Portland to The Dalles, and Dalles City running freight and passengers along the same route, but making more stops. Downriver to Astoria, the T.J. Potter had been condemned in 1916, and, with some exceptions, the boats of Harkins Transportation Company, including the new steam propeller Georgiana (built 1914), were the only major boats on the river. Final decline The Bailey Gatzert excursion runs up the Columbia came to an end in 1917 when the Bailey was transferred to Seattle, Washington, to serve the Seattle-Bremerton route, then much in demand because of wartime marine construction at the Bremerton Navy Yard.McCurdy, at 291 Railroad and highway construction in the early 1920s finished off the steamboat trade. By 1923, major passenger and freight steamboat operations on the lower and middle Columbia had ceased, except for towboats, and until 1937, the passenger and freight boats of the Harkins Transportation Company on the lower Columbia, such as Georgiana. For a brief time, in 1942, the now-famous Puget Sound propeller steamer Virginia V was brought down to the Columbia river, thus becoming (although it was not known at the time) the last survivor of the wooden steamboat fleets of both Puget Sound and of the Columbia River.Kline, M.S., Steamboat Virginia V, at page 56, Documentary Books Publishers, Bellevue, WA 1985 Last runs Portland passing under the lifting span of the Burnside Bridge, in exhibition race with Columbia Gorge, fall 1995. Columbia Gorge at the Burnside Bridge, with many passengers aboard, on same occasion The Georgie Burton was one of the last surviving steamboats on the Columbia River. She had been launched in 1906, on the same day as the San Francisco earthquake. Her last commercial run came on March 20, 1947. The trip was described in McCurdy as follows: Mills, an English professor when he was not writing books on history, used his full talent with the language to capture the occasion: Georgie Burton was moored up at The Dalles, with the objective of turning her into a museum boat. Unfortunately the great Columbia River flood of 1948 broke her loose from her mooring and wrecked her. The last steamboat race on the Columbia was held in 1952, between Henderson and the new steel-hulled Portland, both towboats. This was actually more of an exhibition than a race. The famous actor James Stewart and other members of the cast of the recently filmed movie Bend of the River were on board the Henderson. The race was witnessed by Capt. Homer T. Shaver, who stated that as both were running fast for their design, as towboats, the speeds were not much compared to what he'd seen as a young man on the river. Again, the results were summed up by McCurdy: In 1995, there was a \\"race\\" (again, more of an exhibition) between the steam-powered sternwheeler Portland and the diesel-powered excursion sternwheeler Columbia Gorge. The vessels picked up their passengers at the seawall in Portland, ran north about to the Fremont Bridge, then \\"raced\\" south down the Willamette. The images above show the boats passing under the lifting spans of the Burnside Bridge. Wrecks Boats were lost for many reasons, including striking rocks or logs (\\"snags\\"), fire, boiler explosion, or puncture or crushing by ice. Sometimes boats could be salvaged, and sometimes not. Surviving vessels Portland on Willamette River, summer 1996 Jean, on Oregon Slough (North Portland Harbor), October 2009 Moyie and Sicamous are the only surviving sternwheelers from before 1915. (No sidewheelers survive.) Neither is operational, and both are kept permanently out of water. They are preserved as museums. These are unique as they are both from the time of passenger-carrying steamboats in the Pacific Northwest. Moyie is said to be the oldest surviving vessel of her kind, and this is probably true. Only one operational sternwheel steamboat survives on the entire Columbia River system, north or south of the border, and that is the Portland, moored at Portland, Oregon. Unlike Sicamous and Moyie, Portland never carried passengers on a regular basis, but was built as a towboat. The steel-built steam tug Jean is also in Portland, but has been stripped of her paddle wheel and is lying in a semi-derelict state in North Portland Harbor (Oregon Slough). Another boat, W.T. Preston, a Corps of Engineers snagboat, survives as a museum at Anacortes and is reported to be operational. Unlike Portland however, W.T. Preston is not kept in the water. The propeller steamer Virginia V which technically may have been the last wooden steamboat in regular commercial passenger service on the Columbia (in 1942) has been restored and is operational in Seattle, Washington. Replica steamboats Much later, starting in the early 1980s, a number of replica steamboats have been built, for use as tour boats in river cruise service on the Columbia and Willamette Rivers. Although still configured as sternwheelers, they are non-steam-driven boats or ships, also called motor vessels, powered instead by diesel engines. These tourism-focussed vessels range in size from the Rose to the American Empress (formerly Empress of the North). Others include the M.V. Columbia Gorge, the Willamette Queen, and the Queen of the West.

In commission from 1864 to 1865, she was used by the United States Navy as a gunboat in support of the Union Navy blockade of Confederate waterways.  Capture  Wando was built as the side-wheel steamer SS Let Her Rip in 1864 at Glasgow, Scotland, for use as a Confederate blockade runner in the American Civil War. Let Her Rip sailed under British colors until May 1864 when the Chicora Import and Export Company of Charleston, South Carolina, purchased her. In July 1864, after her first blockade-running trip into Wilmington, North Carolina, she was renamed SS Wando. Wando was captured at sea off Cape Romain, South Carolina, by the Union side-wheel steamer USS Fort Jackson on 21 October 1864 as she attempted to slip away from the Confederate coast laden with cotton. The U.S. Navy purchased the ship from the Boston, Massachusetts, prize court on 5 November 1864, converted her into a gunboat, and commissioned her as USS Wando at the Boston Navy Yard on 22 December 1864, Acting Master Frederick T. King in command.  Union actions  Late in December 1864, Wando proceeded south for duty with the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. She arrived at Port Royal, South Carolina, on 5 January 1865 and was stationed on blockade duty off Charleston in February. Wando departed Charleston on 11 February 1865 and joined in amphibious operations against the Confederate fort and batteries at Andersonville, Bull's Bay, South Carolina, lasting from 13 February to 17 February 1865. The fort and batteries were silenced, prompting the evacuation of Charleston on 18 February 1865. In March, Wando joined the blockading force off Georgetown, South Carolina, and then returned to Charleston in April 1865.  Decommissioning and sale  Wando remained at Charleston until ordered north to the New York Navy Yard on 28 July 1865. She was decommissioned there on 10 August 1865 and was sold at public auction on 30 November 1865 to H. Allen. She then became the commercial steamship SS Wando, and lasted until February 1872, when she sank in a storm.

Biography Early life and education Born in Turin, Agostino Richelmy received his Confirmation on 13 August 1857 and later joined the Garibaldian Volunteers in the War of 1866, wearing his red shirt under his cassock for years afterwards.TIME Magazine. Milestones 20 August 1923 He attended Liceo classico Cavour and studied at the seminary in Turin, from where he obtained his doctorate in theology on 18 May 1876. He was ordained to the priesthood on 25 April 1873 and finished his studies three years later. Within the Archdiocese of Turin, Richelmy taught at its seminary, served as a prosynodal examiner, and was a canon of the cathedral chapter. Episcopate On 7 June 1886 he was appointed Bishop of Ivrea by Pope Leo XIII. Richelmy received his episcopal consecration on the following 28 October from Cardinal Gaetano Alimonda, with Bishops Davide Riccardi and Giovanni Bertagna serving as co- consecrators. He was later named Archbishop of Turin on 18 September 1897. Cardinalate Pope Leo created him Cardinal Priest of Sant'Eusebio in the consistory of 18 June 1899. After participating in the 1903 papal conclave, Richelmy's cardinalatial church was transferred to Santa Maria in Via on 27 November 1911. He was one of the cardinal electors in the conclave of 1914, and also in that of 1922, which selected Pope Benedict XV and Pope Pius XI respectively. In 1915, when Italy entered World War I, Richelmy organized priests for duty as army chaplains in the mountains of Trentino, where they carved altars out of snow and said Mass in below-zero temperatures. The Cardinal died in Turin, at age 72. He was initially buried at the chapel for the clergy in the Turin cemetery, but his remains were transferred in 1927 to the Santuario della Consolata, where they lie in a pink marble sarcophagus. Richelmy succeeded Davide Riccardi, who assisted in the former's episcopal consecration, as both Bishop of Ivrea and Archbishop of Turin. References Sources Vaudagnotti, Attilio (1926).

He is currently the offensive coordinator at the University of Arizona. Early life and playing career Mazzone grew up in Raton, New Mexico and went on to play college football as a quarterback under coach Bill Mondt at the University of New Mexico from 1975 to 1979. Coaching career After graduation, Mazzone started his coaching career as a graduate assistant at New Mexico under head coach Joe Morrison who had succeeded Mondt in 1980. Mazzone also spent one season (1981) at Boulder High School, coaching future University of Colorado greats Tom Gebhardt and Eric McCarty. In 1982, Mazzone received his first full-time position, coaching quarterbacks and receivers under Leon Fuller at Colorado State. After 5 years at CSU, Mazzone was hired away by Jim Wacker to serve as quarterbacks coach at Texas Christian. When Wacker left TCU for the head coaching position at the University of Minnesota in 1992, Mazzone followed Wacker to serve the same position with the Gophers. In 1995, Mazzone was hired as offensive coordinator by Tommy Tuberville, who had just become head coach at Ole Miss. Tuberville left Ole Miss for Auburn in 1999, taking Mazzone with him. However, after the 2001 season Tuberville chose to replace Mazzone with Bobby Petrino. Oregon State head coach Dennis Erickson then hired Mazzone as offensive coordinator for the 2002 season. When Erickson left the collegiate ranks to coach the San Francisco 49ers, Mazzone chose to remain in college football, becoming offensive coordinator under Chuck Amato at North Carolina State, where he coached Philip Rivers, who would be the fourth overall pick in the 2004 NFL Draft. In January 2005, Mazzone returned to Ole Miss to serve as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach under head coach Ed Orgeron. He was fired as offensive coordinator at the end of the 2005 season but remained an employee at Ole Miss for contractual reasons.

Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months. This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year. The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates. Fruits that are commonly candied include dates, cherries, pineapple, as well as a root, ginger.Answers.com (from The Food Lover's Companion) ‚Äî candied fruit; candied flowers, with candied cherries being popularly referred to as \\"glac√© cherries\\". Archived on 24 November 20091-06. The principal candied peels are orange and citron; these with candied lemon peel are the usual ingredients of mixed chopped peel (which may also include glac√© cherries). Recipes vary from region to region, but the general principle is to boil the fruit, steep it in increasingly strong sugar solutions for a number of weeks, and then dry off any remaining water.  History  Food preservation methods using sugar (palm syrup and honey) were known to the ancient cultures of China and Mesopotamia. However, the precursors of modern candying were the Arabs, who served candied citrus and roses at the important moments of their banquets . With the Arab domination of parts of southern Europe, candied fruit made its way to the West. In Italy, they became a key ingredient of some of the most famous sweets of its culinary tradition: among these, the Milanese panettone and Cassata Siciliana.  Uses  Candied fruits such as cherries are commonly used in fruitcakes or pancakes.

Lleyton Hewitt, who was the 2006 runner-up, was the singles champion, while Bob and Mike Bryan were the doubles champions. The event was held in Las Vegas, Nevada at the Darling Tennis Center. It was the twentieth Tennis Channel Open, but just the second to be held in Las Vegas. The ITF women's competition was won by Caroline Wozniacki in singles and by Victoria Azarenka and Tatiana Poutchek for doubles. Round Robin decision Since the 2007 Tennis Channel Open featured a round robin formatted draw, an issue arose. Defending champion James Blake, Evgeny Korolev, and Juan Mart√≠n del Potro were to play each other and the winner of the round robin who would advance to the quarterfinals was determined by the number of matches and percent of sets and games that were won. Blake lost to Korolev, and Korolev then lost to del Potro. For Blake to advance to the quarterfinals of the 2007 Tennis Channel Open, he had to defeat del Potro, losing no more than five games. In this situation, each player would have won one match each, and Blake would have lost the fewest games. In the del Potro versus Blake match, Blake, who was winning 6‚Äì1, 3‚Äì1, beat del Potro because he retired. This eliminated del Potro from such a three-way tie, because he did not complete all of his matches. Korolev then moved on to the next round, since del Potro had been eliminated, and Korolev had already beaten Blake. This caused a controversial issue that involved fans, Blake, and others, as they felt that Blake was to be in the quarterfinals. A press conference was held, and the ATP, which was chaired by Etienne de Villiers, determined that Blake would have beaten del Potro and thus met the rules for advancement into the quarterfinals. Since neither player knew that del Potro's retirement would result in such a large issue, Blake would have won, and therefore, Blake went into the quarterfinals. The following morning, however, De Villiers decided that the rules for advancement should not be altered after the tournament's start, and therefore Korolev was entered the quarterfinals. Blake entered the 2007 Indian Wells Masters without being able to defend three of his titles. Later, the round robin format was ended, and all tournaments planning on employing the round robin format were changed back into the original draw format.

In 1908, he won the Olympic Silver Medal at the age of 39, after losing the final to Jay Gould II, the Bronze Medal was won by The Hon Neville Bulwer-Lytton, later 3rd Earl of Lytton. Miles had, in fact, coached the much younger Gould during his stay in America in 1900‚Äì2 when he became the first non-American winner of the US Championship in 1900. He won further the amateur racquets championship of the world in singles in 1906 and in doubles in 1902, 1904, 1905 and 1906; and of England in doubles as well as becoming amateur squash racquets champion of America in 1900.

He was a prolific author, including collaborations with lifelong friend E.F. Benson with whom he may have had a college romance,Masters, Brian \\"The Life Of E.F. Benson\\", Chatto & Windus, 1992, pp75-76 on diverse subjects including health (e.g. \\"Fitness for Play and Work\\" 1912), athletics (\\"An Alphabet of Athletics\\"), diet (\\"The Failures of Vegetarianism\\" 1902), ancient history (\\"A History of Rome up to 500 AD, with Essays, Maps and Aids to Memory\\" 1901) and Classics (\\"Comparative Syntax of Greek and Latin\\") with many of his books still available on Amazon.

A Boy's Control and Self-Expression, published in 1904. Health and Diet Miles advertised and experimented with different fad diets. He originally embraced a uric acid-free diet but found it too restricting.Whorton, James C. (2016 edition). Crusaders for Fitness: The History of American Health Reformers. Princeton University Press. pp. 260-262. He later criticized this diet in a booklet The Uric Acid Fetish (1915). Miles also experimented with Edward H. Dewey's \\"No Breakfast Plan\\" but abandoned it in favour of his own \\"No Lunch Plan\\". Historian Ina Zweiniger-Bargielowska has noted that \\"Miles's comprehensive regimen combined vegetarianism and abstention from alcohol with games, daily practice of gymnastics, personal cleanliness, breathing exercises, and meditation.\\"Zweiniger-Bargielowska, Ina. (2010). Managing the Body: Beauty, Health, and Fitness in Britain 1880-1939. Oxford University Press. p. 34. Miles promoted the concept of \\"mental hygiene\\". Miles authored many books on dieting and vegetarianism. Miles drew publicity for his article on how to live on a diet of two plasmon biscuits and one lentil a day.Addyman, Mary; Wood, Laura; Yiannitsaros, Christopher. (2017). Food, Drink, and the Written Word in Britain, 1820‚Äì1945. Routledge. p. 147. In 1904, it was humorously reported in Punch that during the semi-final of a tennis competition, Miles was surrounded by an angry mob who compelled him to eat a meat chop.\\"The Danger of Being in the Public Eye\\". Punch, July 27, 1904. Miles was known for promoting different vegetable diets. He became a vegetarian but refused to be identified under that label as he believed the practice of vegetarianism had many faults, he expounded on these ideas in his book The Failures of Vegetarianism. His diet emphasized grains, legumes and meat substitutes which he called \\"Simpler Food\\". He published a monthly magazine, Healthward Ho! and was the owner of a vegetarian restaurant in Chandos Street, Charing Cross that was alleged to have served more than a thousand diners a day. His restaurant is briefly mentioned in E. M. Forster's Howards End (1910). He also owned health food shops in London and two other restaurants, in Carshalton and Chelsea.\\"Even Edwardians suffered from healthy living\\". The Telegraph. Although he expanded his business and his restaurant prospered during WWI, interest in his dieting ideas declined. Miles later went bankrupt and sold his properties. When he died he left only ¬£175. Miles has also been described as an advocate of lacto vegetarianism.Tibbles, William. (1914). Dietetics: Or Food in Health and Disease. Lea & Febiger. p. 243 His ideas about dieting were criticized by medical health experts as impractical.Anonymous. (1920). Selfhealth as a Habit. New York Medical Journal 112: 602.

The collection was released on July 6, 2005.  Publication history  Beginning in 1998, DC published special one-shot oversized graphic novels to celebrate the 60th anniversary of some of its main characters: Superman: Peace on Earth was the first of these in 1998, followed by Batman: War on Crime in 1999. These first two works won Harvey and Eisner Awards for Best Painter/Multimedia Artist (Ross) and Best Graphic Album. In addition, Peace on Earth also won a Reuben Award for best Superman comic. Following these, DC released Shazam!: Power of Hope in 2000 and finally Wonder Woman: Spirit of Truth in 2001. The following year, DC Comics also published one extra book: JLA: Secret Origins. The work presented the origins of the four main characters already published in the previous books as well as the origins of other Justice League members: Green Lantern, Flash, Green Arrow, Black Canary, Martian Manhunter, Hawkman, Hawkgirl and Plastic Man. Every origin was present in two-pages layout based on Joe Shuster's origin of Superman from Action Comics #1. The final book, published in 2003, JLA: Liberty and Justice presented a full story featuring the entire group, the first time that Ross was able to use all characters in the current timeline. The artwork is of Ross' very own photorealism, and the books themselves were created after the success of Ross' and writer Mark Waid's famous Kingdom Come. The World's Greatest Super-Heroes was released on August 1, 2005 on dust- jacket slipcase hardcover edition (9.6\\" x 13\\") and got paperback reprint (8.2\\" x 11\\") on September 28, 2010.

Both he and his wife, Brita Horn- Heybroek, were prominent members of the prestigious Eskilstuna Art Society.  Early life  Folke Heybroek was born in Amsterdam to a Dutch banker and Swedish mother and was the youngest of four brothers. He studied art at the Amsterdam Rijksakademie under Heinrich Campendonk (1889‚Äì1957) a German expressionist who taught Decorative Art, printmaking and stained-glass.Folke Heybroek profile at FolkeHeybroek.com In 1938 Heybroek met his wife Brita Horn (born 1905) in the fishing village of Nordingr√•, Sweden, where he was painting landscapes. She was a Swedish aristocrat who had studied art at the Konstakademie in Stockholm, travelled through Italy and Sicily, and become both an accomplished painter and published art critic.  Working life  In 1939 Heybroek married Brita Horn in Birger Jarlsgatan, Stockholm; had his first solo exhibition at the van Lier gallery in Amsterdam; and moved to Monreale near Palermo in Sicily. In 1940, only Horn's Swedish nationality prevented their internment by the fascist Italian authorities. Thus their first daughter, Mieke Marion, was born in Mariefred near Stockholm in June 1940. In 1942 Heybroek held a critically acclaimed exhibition at the Gummeson Gallery in Stockholm, selling circa 60 works, oil paintings, gouaches and drawings, his expressionistic style at this stage was strongly redolent of Van Gogh. This show lead to a commission for the mural Midsummer for a factory canteen and started a career of public murals, sculptures and stained glass work. Throughout his career he created decorative art, public sculpture, installations and stained glass windows for more than thirty churches and forty schools plus courthouses and community halls.http://www.saatchi- gallery.co.uk/blogon/2007/07/folke_heybroek_saatchi_online.php#more Profile by Ana Finel Honigman at Saatchi Online In the late 1940s Heybroek formed a professional partnership with the interior designer Alice Lund whereby he contributed abstract textile designs, an example of which still hangs in the courthouse in Borl√§nge.

Geology of the Washington Coast Between Point Grenville and the Hoh River. Olympia, Washington: State of Washington Department of Natural Resources, 1973, p.40) is a island located approximately off the Washington coast. Home to seabirds, shorebirds, and marine mammals, it is part of the Quillayute Needles National Wildlife Refuge. The Hoh Indians used to frequent Destruction Island to capture rhinoceros auklets. In recent years the population of rhinoceros auklet have been in decline as a result of habitat loss and eagle predation due to the presence of non-native European rabbits. Destruction Island's name is derived from two massacres which happened nearby. In 1775, Spanish Navy lieutenant Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra dispatched a crew of seven men to the mainland in order to gather wood and fresh water on the beach near Point Grenville, but they were allegedly slaughtered by an estimated three hundred local Native Americans, leading him to name it the Isla de Dolores (the Island of Sorrows). Twelve years later, Captain Charles William Barkley, an independent English fur trader, arrived in the ship Imperial Eagle, and sent a party ashore from the island to a similar fate. Barkley named the river where the second massacre took place the Destruction River. Captain George Vancouver later transferred the name to the Isla de Dolores when the river was given its indigenous name, the Hoh River. Three shipwrecks occurred at the island in 1889: Cassanora Adams, Port Gordon, and Wide West. The Destruction Island Lighthouse was built on Destruction Island in 1888‚Äì91. A US Coast Guard detachment operated the lighthouse from 1939 to the early 1970s. The light was automated in 1968, before it was shut off for good in April 2008.Destruction Island Lighthouse, Washington at Lighthousefriends.com The island itself is accessible only by boat.

It is named after an administrative district in this area in the time of King Solomon (1 Kings 4:10). The council covers an area adjacent to Hadera in the north, to Netanya in the south, to the Mediterranean in the west and to Tulkarm and the Green Line in the east. It has a population of about 35,000 residents. The Regional Council offices are located near Kfar Monash, at the Ruppin junction, next to the Ruppin Academic Center. History Emek Hefer 1947 In the early 1900s, a local midwife, Olga Hankin, reported information about the economic state of the families in the region to her husband, Yehoshua Hankin, who was in charge of land purchase for the Jewish National Fund. In 1927 Yehoshua Hankin resolved the complex legal issues involved in purchasing the land, and signed an agreement for the purchase of the Hefer Valley. The only difficulty was that the Jewish National Fund did not have sufficient funds to pay the sum needed for buying the land. The chairman of the JNF, Menachem Ushishkin, set out on a fundraising trip to Canada, returning with $300,000 and undertakings to bring it up to a million, the sum required to purchase the Hefer Valley over a period of seven years. At the Zionist Congress held in Zurich in 1929, Ushishkin announced that Emek Hefer was now in Jewish hands. A group of 20 young members of the \\"Vitkin\\" and \\"Haemek\\" movements settled in the newly purchased valley. They moved into an abandoned building and began draining the swamps and preparing the land for agriculture. In April 1933, they built their first houses on Kfar Vitkin, in the heart of the valley. In 1931, a group from the Hashomer Hatzair movement in Hadera established the settlement of Ein HaHoresh, planting the first citrus grove. A company called \\"Yachin\\" prepared plantations for settlers from abroad. Another group from the Kibbutz HaMeuhad movement, founded Givat Haim in 1932, while the organization of demobilized soldiers from the Jewish Brigade set up the settlement of Avihayil. Ruppin Academic Center was established in the region in 1949.

Released in 2004, it is the third game in the Panzer Front franchise. Gameplay Panzer Front Ausf.B lets the player fight as a tank commander in historic simulated tank battles. Each battle involves manoeuvring on a large battlefield, with varied terrain. Most battles involve over thirty units per side, ranging from infantry to tank platoons. The player pilots the lead tank in a formation of two to five tanks that can be separated into sub-units. The player can utilise variable zoom binoculars from the commander's hatch, or view the field using the vision devices from inside the tank and the aiming reticule. The main view is from outside the tank. Most missions feature the ability to call in high-explosive or smoke artillery barrages and attacks from support aircraft. The player also has the option of changing to play the opposing force, and changing which unit he commands. A scoreboard at the end of each mission displays enemy units killed and their corresponding points. This score will only be saved if the player and the allied units in his formation used the default unit and type of vehicle. Each weapon, from machine gun to 88mm, has a different sound, recoil and ammunition types. The tanks also sustain realistic battle damage. Hits to the different areas of the tank, depending on armour type, range, angle and power of the gun, produce a different effect, such as track, gun, gun turret or mount damage. Individual crew members can be killed or wounded, affecting the operation of the tank. Engine damage effects the tank's speed, or can disable it altogether. A repair and reload area can be used to replace injured or killed crew, or to repair damaged tanks. Vehicles All of the vehicles in the game, especially the tanks, are based on actual units in service in 1940 and 1941. They include the Panzer III, the Cruiser MkIII, and the Matilda tank. Missions Except for one mission set during the 1940 German invasion of France, Panzer Front Ausf. B is mostly set in Libya during the early stages of World War II's Western Desert Campaign. Missions include the Italian Tenth Army's attempted breakout at Beda Fomm and the assault at Fort Capuzzo. Each mission allows the player to play one of the combatant sides, such as the Afrika Korps, Italian Tenth Army, Britain's Eighth Army, and the Australian 6th Division. Reception The game received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of one seven, one six, one seven, and one six for a total of 26 out of 40.

The highest point is at an elevation of . The rock is composed of asbestos (chrysotile), an ultramafic rock. It weathers to produce serpentine soils with characteristically low levels of nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and calcium, and high levels of magnesium and heavy metals including nickel and chromium. This means little vegetation grows in the area though there are some plants that only grow on such soils like the local endemic San Benito evening primrose. The Clear Creek Management Area includes the San Benito Mountain Research Natural Area, recognized for its unique pine and incense cedar forest assemblage. The Mediterranean climate is punctuated by cool, wet winters and hot, dry summers. There are two superfund sites in the area, both associated with the mining and processing of chrysotile asbestos. There are also a handful of small mines producing gems and the minerals, but the Clear Creek Serpentine Area of Critical Environmental Concern was withdrawn from mineral entry on August 7, 2012. Geology The mountain, which rises to an elevation of , is the highest point in San Benito County and the Diablo Range. The mountain gets some snowfall during winter. The rock is a chrysotile serpentine, a soft fibrous silicate material. Extreme shearing of the bedrock, combined with soil nutrient imbalances, has resulted in extensive areas of natural barrens completely devoid of vegetation. The serpentine soils harbor several rare plant species, including the Federally listed Threatened San Benito evening primrose (Camissonia benitensis). A unique pine and incense cedar forest occurs at the highest elevations of the mountain and in 1980, the San Benito Mountain Research Natural Area was designated an Instant Wilderness Study Area. The serpentine mass contains two superfund sites, Atlas Mine and Johns-Mansville. Both were associated with the mining and processing of chrysotile asbestos. Other minerals mined from the serpentine mass included cinnabar, chromite, magnesite, and jadeite. The Gem mine (private) located within the serpentine mass is the only source of gem- grade benitoite in the world. The rare minerals neptunite and joaquinite have also been found there. Health and Safety Restrictions The Clear Creek Management Area, which encompasses the San Benito Mountain Research Natural Area, was temporarily closed by the BLM from May 2008 to February 2014 due to concerns of visitor exposure to naturally occurring asbestos (chrysotile). The core area of the Clear Creek Management Area (approximately 35,000 acres) is the New Idria serpentine mass. The serpentine is highly sheared/pulverized and contains abundant chrysotile asbestos. Therefore, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management requires visitors to obtain permits to enter the Clear Creek Serpentine Area of Critical Environmental Concern. Recreational opportunities include hunting, camping, hobby gem/mineral collecting, mountain biking, horseback riding, hiking/backpacking, and sightseeing. Hobby gem and mineral collectors are drawn to the Clear Creek area, one of the most highly mineralized areas in California, by the presence of over 150 semi-precious minerals and gemstones. Among these are serpentine, jadeite, cinnabar, tremolite, topazite, neptunite, and the extremely rare California state gem, benitoite. There are two developed campgrounds in the CCMA, Oak Flat and Jade Mill, both with picnic tables, shade structures, fire rings, and pit toilet. Permit & Season Information Serpentine Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) Permit: This free permit allows an individual to access the Serpentine ACEC within the Clear Creek Management Area for the duration of one day. Each person, regardless of age, entering the Serpentine ACEC is required to have a permit in their name and on their person. An individual is allowed a total of five permits per calendar year. Vehicle Permit: Vehicles entering the Clear Creek Management Area, including the Condon Peak campground and trailhead, are required to have a Clear Creek Vehicle Permit. The permit is $5 per vehicle and allows the vehicle to enter the Clear Creek Management Area for seven days from the date of entry. Each vehicle must display the permit on its dash while in the Clear Creek Management Area. Condon Peak Off-Highway Vehicle (OHV) Permit: Every ATV or Utility Terrain Vehicle (UTV) entering Condon Peak's trail network is required to have a permit. The permit cost is $10 and allows the ATV/UTV driver, age 16 and older, access to the route network at Condon Peak for seven days from the entry date.

Incumbent Republican Governor Claude R. Kirk Jr. chose to run for a second term, with this being the first election in which the incumbent would be eligible for another four- year term. The first Republican elected governor since the Reconstruction Era, Kirk was challenged by Eckerd Corporation founder Jack Eckerd and State Senator Louis A. \\"Skip\\" Bafalis for his party's nomination. After failing to receive a majority, Kirk prevailed over Eckerd in a runoff. The primary for the Democratic Party nomination featured a four candidate field, with Florida Attorney General Earl Faircloth and President pro tempore of the Florida Senate Reubin Askew advancing to a runoff. Askew won the runoff and received the nomination of the Democratic Party. This was the first election since the re-establishment of the office of Lieutenant Governor. Askew selected Florida Secretary of State Thomas Burton Adams Jr., while Kirk chose to run with incumbent Ray C. Osborne. Primarily due to controversial statements and actions during his term, as well as his inability to portray Askew as an extreme liberal as he had done with Robert King High in 1966, Kirk lost re- election to Askew in the general election by a margin of 56.88% to 43.12%. Overview Incumbent Governor of Florida Claude R. Kirk Jr. was the first Republican who held Florida's governorship since Reconstruction. He was elected in 1966, when Republicans has made some gains in traditionally Democratic Deep South. During his tenure as governor, the Florida Legislature created a new Constitution in 1968, which was approved by voters on November 5, 1968. As part of the new Constitution, the office of Lieutenant Governor was re-established. Kirk appointed Ray C. Osborne, a Florida House of Representatives member from Pinellas County. The new Constitution also allowed for the Governor of Florida to serve two consecutive terms. Kirk was thus eligible for re-election in 1970.Under the superseded Florida Constitution of 1885, the Governor could serve an unlimited number of terms, but not two in a row. Fla.

[Eckerd has] a common touch, dedication to high principle, and organizing genius.\\" William C. Cramer, a powerful Republican in the state and the party's senate nominee for that year, publicly remained neutral during the primary, but voted for Eckerd. Later, Eckerd himself would state, \\"I was offended by his [Kirk's] public behavior and chagrined that he was a Republican.\\" In the primary election held on September 8, Kirk reached first place with 48.16% of the vote, compared to 38.37% for Eckerd, and 13.48% for Bafalis. However, because Kirk failed to receive a majority of the votes, he and Eckerd advanced to a run-off election.

He collected many interesting facts, but was wanting in the critical faculty necessary for useful investigation. On 5 July 1843 a remarkable disturbance of the sea was observed in Mount's Bay. Edmonds recorded with much care the phenomena as observed by him at Penzance. He collected accounts of analogous phenomena on the Cornish coast, and in subsequent years several examples of similar alternate ebbings and flowings of the sea were recorded by Edmonds and others, and rather hastily attributed by him to submarine earthquakes. Edmonds thus gained the title of a seismologist, to which he certainly can make no claim. He was singularly modest and timid, even to the point of confusion in stating his views. Notwithstanding this he collected with much labour all the remarkable facts connected with earthquakes, and induces his readers to believe that he traces some connection between the abnormal tides of the Atlantic and the small earthquake shocks sometimes felt in Cornwall. He had never received any scientific training, and failed to attribute the oscillations to their true cause, the formation of a vast tide wave in mid ocean, probably due to astronomical influences. He wrote about twelve papers on the Celtic remains of Cornwall, upon Roman antiquities, and ancient customs. His papers on the agitations of the sea were sent to the Royal Irish Academy, to the British Association, the ‚ÄòGentleman's Magazine,‚Äô the ‚ÄòPhilosophical Magazine,‚Äô as well as to the journals published by the Royal Cornwall Geological Society and to the Royal Institution of Cornwall. Edmonds left Cornwall shortly after 1870, and died in 1886.

In the case of ships it may also refer to repair work done to make an abandoned or distressed but still floating vessel more suitable for towing or propulsion under its own power. The recreational/technical activity known as wreck diving is generally not considered salvage work, though some recovery of artifacts may be done by recreational divers. Most salvage diving is commercial work, or military work, depending on the diving contractor and the purpose for the salvage operation, Similar underwater work may be done by divers as part of forensic investigations into accidents, in which case the procedures may be more closely allied with underwater archaeology than the more basic procedures of maximum cost/benefit expected in commercial and military operations. Clearance diving, the removal of obstructions and hazards to navigation, is closely related to salvage diving, but has a different purpose, in that the objects to be removed are not intended to be recovered, just removed or reduced to a condition where they no longer constitute a hazard. Many of the techniques and procedures used in clearance diving are also used in salvage work. Range of salvage activities The US Navy considers the recovery of sunken or wrecked naval craft, submarines, human remains, critical items of equipment needed to determine the cause of a mishap, including classified and sensitive materials to be within the scope of their salvage and recovery operations. Diving work associated with marine salvage operations Survey of underwater damage For stranded and floating vessels, a detailed hull survey includes the parts of the ship that are underwater. These will be external areas below sea level, and any internal areas that are flooded. If sea conditions or access are unsuitable for external survey, internal survey will have to be more comprehensive as the information about one side must be extrapolated to provide needed information about the inaccessible side. The diving survey includes: *The areas of the hull in contact with the seabed *A description of the points of contact with the bottom *The position of any pinnacles in contact with the hull or nearby, that may affect salvage operations *Position of any penetrations of bottom material into the hull. *The position, orientation and size of all holes, tears and cracks in immersed parts of the hull and topsides *The condition of all through hull penetrations such as sea suctions, discharges and valves, and whether they are clear and functional *The condition and functionality of all underwater appendages *Signs of leaking pollutants and other fluids *The type of seabed and the location and extent of scouring or sediment deposition. The dive team should be briefed on all structural damage found inside the hull so that they can check for underwater damage in the same areas. When practicable the work of the divers should be minimised as diving is slow, labor-intensive, dangerous and expensive work. Tidal flow can change the conditions and limit diving operations, and also affect the condition of the vessel and seabed in the vicinity. Where scouring is likely it should be monitored by regular underwater inspections. Video records allow comparison to estimate the rate of scour or deposition. Patching of damage Underwater patching is almost always done by divers. As much patch fabrication and rigging as possible should be done out of the water to minimise diving time. Small leaks are generally sealed off and made watertight by wooden plugs and wedges, small wooden patches and concrete boxes, small steel plate patches or combinations of these, caulked and sometimes additionally sealed with epoxy resin or fire- reinforced resins. Small steel patches for minor leaks are usually fitted with gasket material to seal against the damaged hull. Major patching is characterized by extensive diving work and include detailed underwater surveys, measurements, and major underwater cutting and welding operations to prepare and fit the patch. Reinforcement and shoring If a ship is pumped out while the deck is submerged the top of the deck is loaded by hydrostatic pressure and may require shoring to support the load. This is generally done by divers and is time-consuming and expensive. The load may also be compensated by compressed air in the space if practicable. Installing cofferdams Attachment and rigging of lifting or hauling gear Inspection of ground tackle Setting up for dewatering with compressed air Wrecking in place Planning of salvage diving operations Information gathering Detailed information of the layout and structure of the vessel to be salvages and the type and location of cargo are useful for planning and essential for the actual salvage operation. Information acquired during the planning stage can greatly facilitate the actual operation. If the vessel is to be raised, details of the cause of sinking and the extent of damage is required. Useful information can be gathered from ships plans, cargo manifests, loading plans, interviews with witnesses and survivors, photographs and official reports of similar accidents. Planning of the salvage operations The choice of salvage systems depends on the specific conditions of the job. Divers can work efficiently in shallow water, but the practicality decreases rapidly with depth and has an absolute limit determined by current technology. They bring the advantages of human vision, judgement and high dexterity manipulative skills, but these are offset by depth limitations, dive duration, risk, support requirements and cost. Manned submersibles and atmospheric diving suits can go deeper than ambient pressure diving without decompression obligations, and have advantages of human vision and judgement, and when working without tethers have good maneuverability, but dexterity is compromised, and cost is high. Tethered unmanned ROUVs eliminate the risk to human life of manned systems and are available with a wide range of capabilities which can be matched to the operational requirements, and are not limited by operator fatigue. Searching for objects and wreck sites Underwater search and recovery operations are used to locate, identify, observe and recover specific objects from the seafloor. Typically, search and recovery operations are conducted as two distinct phases - the search includes detection and identification of the target and, in some cases, direct inspection. Operations are generally planned to suit expected conditions, but plans should be sufficiently flexible to allow for changes to suit actual conditions. =Search equipment= The equipment available for underwater searches ranges from simple equipment like grapples and draglines to complex acoustic technologies and magnetic field sensors. *Echo-sounders can provide a continuous record of depth under the ship during a search, which can reveal obstacles that might damage towed transponders. They have a narrow beam and poor resolution, and would only be likely to find large targets. *Side-scan sonar uses acoustic transducers which scan a fairly wide swath to each side of the vessel or towed unit. Large areas can be covered in each pass. There is a narrow band directly below the transducer that is not covered. The image produced can have a fairly high resolution and can identify seabed texture an artifacts above a moderate size. The image produced can be interpreted visually to identify a wide range of three-dimensional shapes, and is fairly efficient in covering large areas. The effective resolution depends mainly on the operating frequency, with higher frequency giving greater resolution but shorter effective range and narrower width of seabed covered in each pass. A 500kHz system might effectively scan a swath of 50 to 100m with the possibility of detecting a target of the order of 1m diameter, while a 30kHz system might find a shipwreck in a swath of up to 5km wide, depending on depth. The data may be viewed in real time and recorded for further analysis. *Multi-beam sonar *Towed pinger locators are passive acoustic search systems that only receive a signal from an acoustic beacon, Aircraft that fly over the sea carry such a beacon on the flight data recorder in case they are lost at sea. They do not always have directional resolution and may need several passes to locate the target accurately. *Magnetometers can detect variations in magnetic field that may be caused by masses of ferromagnetic material - iron and steel - and cables carrying electric current. Since ships usually contain a fairly to very large amount of ferromagnetic material, this equipment is quite effective for locating shipwrecks. They are also useful for resolving ambiguous targets in areas of high topographical variation, and can detect targets buried under sediment. *Optical Imaging Systems. can be used for underwater searches if the visibility is good enough. In deep water they need to carry their own light source. They can be used in combination with side scan sonar, to help with identification of an object as it is found. Remotely operated vehicles are platforms that can carry sensors underwater and maneuver them in proximity to the object. They are limited to operating in relatively small areas because the support ship must loiter almost directly over the ROV and the umbilical limits the system's maneuverability. An ROV can be very effective at locating small isolated targets in a known debris field, and visually identifying a target in good visibility. =Search patterns= The effectiveness of a search can be expressed by how thoroughly and efficiently the search area is examined. Systematic examination of the search area is achieved by following a predetermined pattern that suits the conditions of the search. *Parallel grid search: The most common pattern for a towed sensor search, using parallel straight line search tracks. Adjacent tracks use sufficient overlap to compensate for errors in the path, width variations in the scanned swath and losses in resolution at the extreme edges. The turn between each leg of the search mudt allow the towed array to stabilise depth and lateral position before the new leg scan, and this can take a significant part of the search time. A towed array should preferably be towed roughly parallel to the depth contours as this reduces the need for depth changes on each leg. Salvage work Salvage diving techniques Scuba is not authorised for most salvage work by commercial or naval operators due to relatively high risk in comparison to surface supplied techniques, though naval operations may use scuba for non-penetrative work in good visibility and relatively shallow depths. The choice between surface oriented and saturation diving is based largely on depth and the amount of decompression anticipated. =Underwater work techniques used in salvage diving work= *Airlift dredging *Buoyant lifting **Lifting bags *Concrete placement *Explosive demolition *Explosive fastening *Oxy-arc cutting *Rigging *Shoring *Underwater inspection **Underwater photography *Underwater welding *Waterjetting Hazards common to salvage diving *Fouling and entrapment *Contamination by dangerous and toxic materials *Pressure differentials due to water movement *Unintended explosions * Salvage diving platforms and support vessels Support equipment and ROVs List of notable salvage operations involving divers *USS Squalus *Russian submarine Kursk *SS Egypt *Costa Concordia *USS Monitor *Mary Rose *Vasa (ship) *HMS Royal George (1756) Gallery File:US Navy 100331-N-0000X-001 Stephanie Brown.jpgUS Navy divers descending to a wreck to recover petroleum from a sunken ship.

Life and work Stanis≈Çawa de Kar≈Çowska was the daughter of Aleksander de Kar≈Çowski and Paulina z Tucho≈Çk√≥w. Her father's family was descended from the Polish nobility (szlachta) and had substantial estates centred on Wszeliwy, near ≈Åowicz, in central Poland. The family had a long history of patriotic activity, and her father had fought with Lajos Kossuth and J√≥zef Bem in the late 1840s. He had also suffered considerable financial loss through the part that he played in the Polish rebellion of 1863. Stanis≈Çawa had trained as an artist in Cracow prior to enrolling at the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris, in 1896. In the following summer she went to Jersey to the wedding of a fellow Polish art student Janina Flamm to Eric Forbes- Robertson. It was here that she met the English artist Robert Bevan. By the end of the year she and Bevan were married in Warsaw. They settled in Swiss Cottage, London. She exhibited with the Women's International Art Club and New English Art Club and both exhibited at the Allied Artists‚Äô Association in 1908. However, being a woman, she was ineligible for membership of either the Fitzroy Street Group or the later Camden Town Group. De Kar≈Çowska was a founder member of the London Group and showed with them throughout her life. Her work combined a modernist style with elements of Polish folk art. In March 1910, Huntly Carter said of it...‚Äùwhat S. de Karlowska has to say she tells us lucidly in pure and harmonious colour.‚Äù Soho Square 1936 Stanis≈Çawa had two children, Edith Halina (Mrs Charles Baty) and Robert Alexander (Bevan). Remaining in London after her husband's death in 1925, she spent the war years in Chester. She travelled to Poland until the late 1930s and would holiday with her daughter's family at Pl√©nauf-Val Andr√© in Northern Brittany and at St Nicolas-du-Pelem, further south. Many of her London and Breton paintings can be seen in public collections. Stanis≈Çawa de Kar≈Çowska died in London in 1952 and is buried in the Bevan family tomb in Cuckfield, Sussex. In common with her husband, de Karlowska sold few of her works during her lifetime. Her estate, including several hundred of Robert Bevan's paintings, drawings and lithographs were left equally to her two children. Many works were presented to public collections over the following twenty years. She had one solo exhibition during her lifetime at the Adams Gallery in London, in 1935. Her memorial exhibition was also held there in 1954, and in 1968 a joint Bevan - de Kar≈Çowska show was held at the Anglo-Polish Society, London. Stanis≈Çawa de Kar≈Çowska was the great grandmother of the historian of architectural paint and colour, Patrick Baty. A second cousin was Blessed Maria Kar≈Çowska.

The club was established in 1887, and is currently playing in the Derde Divisie. History  19th century  Be Quick 1887 was founded on 4 October 1887 by students of a local gymnasium. The club joined the football competition in 1895, and was placed in the Tweede Klasse Noord, then the highest tier of football in the northern districts of the country.  20th century  Be Quick joined the newly established Eerste Klasse in 1916, and would remain in the league until the introduction of professional football in the Netherlands in 1954. The heyday of Be Quick came between 1915 and 1926. The club won the title in the northern football competition in every season except for 1925. On 6 June 1920, Be Quick won the national football title, by defeating VOC of Rotterdam, champion of the western football league, 4‚Äì0. Of that team, goalkeeper Deck Ruijter Zylker was the only player who wouldn't make it to the Netherlands national football team. When professional football was introduced in the Netherlands, in 1954, Be Quick joined the professional leagues. They were placed in the Tweede Divisie, where they won the 1959‚Äì60 title. Be Quick played in the Eerste Divisie for a number of seasons, but withdrew from the ranks of professional football after the 1963‚Äì64 season. Upon returning to the amateur football structure, Be Quick were placed in the Tweede Klasse (now Eerste Klasse). The club were promoted to the Hoofdklasse in 1992, suffered relegation to the Eerste Klasse in 1995 and to the Tweede Klasse in 1997. After one season in the Tweede Klasse, the club returned to the Eerste Klasse, finishing the first season there in second place and winning the title in the second season, 1999‚Äì2000.  21st century  The club was relegated back to the Eerste Klasse in 2002, but secured promotion a year later, and has played in the Hoofdklasse since. They were promoted to the Topklasse in 2013, but went relegated after one only season in the top Dutch amateur level. Two seasons later they returned to the renamed Derde Divisie by placing second in Hoofdklasse C. Stadium The successes between 1915 and 1926 allowed the club to buy a piece of land to the south of the city of Groningen. Stadion Esserberg was then built, designed by architect Evert van Linge, one of the players of the team that won the national title in 1920. The stadium had a capacity of 18,000 when it was built, and now is located in the territory of the municipality of Haren, just a mere four kilometers south of Groningen. Nowadays, it has hosted to the Eurovoetbal tournament.

Chemotherapy uses different drugs to kill or slow the growth of cancer cells; immunotherapy uses treatments to stimulate or restore the ability of the immune system to fight cancer. A common chemoimmunotherapy regimen is CHOP combined with rituximab (CHOP-R) for B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas.  External links  * NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms - Definition of chemoimmunotherapy  Introduction  Cancer therapy has evolved to strategically integrate distinct treatment modalities in order to optimize the chance of cure. Surgery and radiation therapy are used to achieve locoregional control, whereas systemic therapies (chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, molecularly targeted therapies, and adjunctive therapies (bisphosphonates)) are used to control diffuse disease (in hematologic malignancies) or disease that has spread beyond the primary site (in solid tumors).Emens, Leisha A. \\"Chemoimmunotherapy.\\" Cancer journal (2010) Combination of different therapies in cancer has become a trend, not just between different types of therapies, also multiple drugs with complementary mechanisms. And these combinations do have a better effect on five-year survival rate and delaying tumor relapse.  Chemotherapy  In the early 1900s, the famous German chemist Paul Ehrlich set about developing drugs to treat infectious diseases. He was the one who coined the term ‚Äúchemotherapy‚Äù and defined it as the use of chemicals to treat disease, he was also the first person to document the effectiveness of animal models to screen a series of chemicals for their potential activity against diseases, an accomplishment that had major ramifications for cancer drug development. During world war II, a national drug development program appeared as Cancer Chemotherapy National Service Center.DeVita, Vincent T., and Edward Chu. \\"A history of cancer chemotherapy.\\" Cancer research (2008). And good examples in curing acute childhood leukemia and advanced Hodgkin's disease encouraged people to screen more chemicals that have anti-tumor activities. Provided a diversity of anti-tumor chemicals, people started to use cocktail of different drugs and surprisingly found it would have a better outcome. At beginning, people didn't even think about cancer cell could be killed by chemicals, let alone cancer-specific therapies.  Immunotherapy  As for immunotherapy, it early mentioned by James Allison, now at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. Allison found that CTLA-4 puts the brakes on T cells, preventing them from launching full-out immune attacks. He wondered whether blocking the blocker ‚Äì the CTLA-4 molecule ‚Äì would set the immune system free to destroy cancer. But at that time, people would take it as a peculiar idea, and no one supported him. But he kept studying and justified his rationale in mice. Later clinical trials reported anti-CTLA-4 antibody can increase patients with metastatic melanoma lived 4 more months, anti-PD-1 antibody also show anti-tumor effect in clinical trials.Couzin- Frankel, Jennifer. \\"Cancer immunotherapy.\\" (2013) Using host immune system to fight with cancer become a more and more prevalent idea in therapy. Furthermore, crosstalk between progressing tumors and the host immune system results in multiple superimposed mechanisms of additional regulation and immune escape that serve to keep the immune response to tumors shut down. A variety of immune cells that promote tumor growth and inhibit tumor-associated immune responses, including CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), CD4+interleukin-17-producing T helper cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Additional features of the tumor microenvironment further silence the anti-tumor immune response, including high levels of suppressive intratumoral cytokines (TGF-Œ≤, TNF, IL-10), the constitutive or induced expression of immune checkpoint molecules by the tumor cells (PD-L1, B7-H4), and various other phenotypic alterations that lead to immune escape (the loss of tumor antigens and other molecules essential for antigen processing and presentation).Chen, Gang, and Leisha A. Emens. \\"Chemoimmunotherapy: reengineering tumor immunity.\\" Cancer Immunology, Immunotherapy (2013).  Crosstalk between chemotherapy and immunotherapy  Chemotherapy can promote tumor immunity in two major ways: (a) through its intended therapeutic effect of killing cancer cells by immunogenic cell death, and (b) through ancillary and largely unappreciated effects on both the malignant and normal host cells present within the tumor microenvironment. However, many standard and high-dose chemotherapy regimens can also be immunosuppressive, by either frankly inducing lymphopenia or contributing to lymphocyte dysfunction. It is clear that strategically integrating immune- based therapies with standard cancer treatment modalities, in particular chemotherapy drugs, has the potential to reengineer the overall host milieu and the local tumor microenvironment to disrupt pathways of immune tolerance and suppression.  Clinical examples  There are several good examples. The standard treatment for patients with diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma is cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP). Rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody against the CD20 B-cell antigen, has therapeutic activity in diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma5. People proved that the addition of rituximab to the CHOP regimen increases the complete-response rate and prolongs event-free and overall survival in elderly patients with diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma, without a clinically significant increase in toxicity.Coiffier, Bertrand, et al. \\"CHOP chemotherapy plus rituximab compared with CHOP alone in elderly patients with diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma.\\" New England Journal of Medicine (2002). For metastatic breast cancer that overexpresses HER2, chemoimmunotherapy also has a better effect. HER2 gene, encodes the growth factor receptor HER2, is overexpressed in 25 to 30 percent of breast cancers, increasing the aggressiveness of the tumor. Trastuzumab is a recombinant monoclonal antibody against HER2, clinical trials showed that the addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy was associated with a longer time to disease progression, a higher rate of objective response, a longer duration of response, a lower rate of death at 1 year, longer survival, and a 20 percent reduction in the risk of death, which proves trastuzumab increases the clinical benefit of first-line chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer that overexpresses HER2.Slamon, Dennis J., et al. \\"Use of chemotherapy plus a monoclonal antibody against HER2 for metastatic breast cancer that overexpresses HER2.\\" New England Journal of Medicine (2001).

The station, which began regular broadcast operations in 1991, is currently owned by the Educational Media Foundation. History This station received its original construction permit from the Federal Communications Commission on March 2, 1988, for a new 3,000 watt station broadcasting at 102.9 MHz in Linden, Alabama. The new station was assigned the call letters WBAN by the FCC on September 18, 1989. The callsign was quickly changed to WNPT-FM on November 28, 1989. WNPT-FM received its license to cover from the FCC on February 23, 1993. In March 1997, original owners Linden Radio Joint Venture reached an agreement to sell this station to Willis Broadcasting Corporation. The deal was approved by the FCC on April 30, 1997, and the transaction was consummated on May 10, 1997. In February 2001, Willis Broadcasting Corporation faced significant financial difficulties and foreclosure proceedings in the Circuit Court for Marengo County, Alabama, forced the company into receivership. On March 5, 2001, an application was filed with the FCC to name Beckham Palmer III as receiver \\"for the purpose of protecting the FCC license\\". The transfer was approved by the FCC on March 14, 2001, and the completed on March 15, 2001. In June 2001, receiver Beckham Palmer III reached an agreement to sell this station to Jason Schmitt for $450,000 and certain considerations. The deal was approved by the FCC on August 13, 2001, but Schmitt was unable to complete the transaction and the license remained with Palmer. In late July 2001, the station first applied to the FCC for permission to go off the air temporarily and remain silent, citing financial issues. The station was off the air for several long stretches until resuming normal operations in early March 2003. Former Catfish Country 102.9 logo Former Jack FM branding In October 2003, receiver Beckham Palmer III reached a new agreement to sell this station, this time to John Sisty Enterprises, Inc., for a reported sale price of $450,000. The deal was approved by the FCC on November 18, 2003, and the transaction was consummated on November 28, 2003. In October 2004, the station received FCC authorization to change its community of license from Linden to Marion, Alabama. On October 3, 2011, WNPT-FM changed its format to country, branded as \\"Catfish Country 102.9\\". The branding was a tribute to the pond catfish industry in the Black Belt region the station serves. Logo as Tide 102.9, 2016-2019 In May 2016, it was announced that Townsquare Media would be buying WNPT-FM and its sister station WTBC for $550,000. According to published reports, WNPT-FM was announced to flip to Sports and WTBC would retain the Catfish Country format, once the new owners take over. The sale to Townsquare Media was consummated on July 15, 2016. On June 30, 2016 at 3PM, the station flipped to Sports as \\"Tide 102.9\\". On March 14, 2018, WNPT-FM changed call signs to WTID, to go with the \\"Tide 102.9\\" branding. On June 5, 2019, Townsquare sold WTID to the Educational Media Foundation for $110,000. Upon the sale's expected closure on August 1, the Tide format would move to simulcastor W265CG/WTUG-HD2 as \\"Tide 100.9\\", and WTID would flip to EMF's Air 1 network (as K-Love is already heard in the area on WLXQ ‚Äì by coincidence, the station WTID inherited the Tide format from after its sale to EMF). With the sale, WTID would adopt the new callsign WFMA to match the format.Townsquare Buys And Sells In Tuscaloosa The sale was consummated on July 31, 2019, at which point the call sign change occurred. Construction permit On December 16, 2008, WNPT-FM was granted a construction permit to relocate their transmitter north to 32¬∞49'46\\"N, 87¬∞25'46\\"W, along with a raise in antenna height above average terrain to 202 meters (663 feet), and a drop in effective radiated power to 24,000 watts.

Eventually, Erickson became very well known among bookmakers nationwide for handling \\"lay-off\\" bets. With Chicago's Moses Annenberg, Erickson developed a country wide wire service, making possible for the first time nationwide synchronized betting.

Along with many other ventures, he was a major contributor to the construction of a children's hospital in NYC. He allegedly had connections with the mob.

He was arrested again in 1939 for vagrancy and was so insulted by the charge, he arrived to court in an armoured car, escorted by Brink's guards. He showed the presiding body securities worth $125,000 to prove he wasn't a vagrant. That case, too, was dismissed.

He had later been associated with the Rizzuto crime family of Montreal. Montagna was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 1971. He was raised in Castellammare del Golfo, Sicily. In the mid 1980s, at the age of 15, his family immigrated to the United States and settled in the Bronx, New York. He later became an acting caporegime for the Bonanno crime family, and by 2004, he was the acting boss of the family in the absence of Vincent Basciano. Montagna was a Canadian and Italian citizen, and was deported from the United States to Canada in 2009. In Montreal, Montagna rivaled with the Rizzuto crime family, and after the death of boss Nicolo Rizzuto in 2010, he vied for power. In 2011, he had a falling out with Rizzuto mobster Raynald Desjardins, and on November 24, 2011, his body was found on the shore of √éle Vaudry on the L'Assomption River, in the city of Charlemagne, Quebec. In December 2016, Desjardins received a 14-year prison sentence, including time served, for the murder plot.  Early life  Montagna was born in Montreal, Quebec in 1971.

During the late 1990s, Montagna's name was overheard in wiretapped conversations between Boss Joseph \\"Big Joe\\" Massino and other reputed members of the Bonanno crime family. He was a dual citizen of Italy and Canada.Macleans, \\"Ex-N.Y. Mob boss found dead by river near Montreal\\" , Canadian Press, 2011 November 24 (accessed 25 November 2011)  Sal the Iron Worker  Little is known of Montagna's personal life other than that he married Francesca Carcione and lived in a modest home in Elmont, Long Island with her and their three daughters. He started a small metalworking company called Matrix Steel Co., located at 50 Bogart Street in Bushwick, Brooklyn, managed by his wife.New York Post, \\"Mob boss gets iced\\" , Mitchel Maddux, Tim Perone, 25 November 2011 (accessed 25 November 2011)New York Daily News, \\"Former Bonanno crime family boss shot dead in Canada, two years after being deported for refusing to testify\\" , Tina Moore, 24 November 2011 (accessed 25 November 2011) Matrix Steel manufactures structural and rail mill products, gray and ductile iron foundry crucibles, foundry converters, casting machines, sizing or embossing presses, foundry mold machines and foundry dies and tooling. It was around this time that Montagna was given the nickname \\"Sal the Iron Worker\\".  Acting capo  In 2002, Montagna was arrested along with the crew of Patrick DeFilippo for illegal gambling and loansharking charges.Book : Mafia Inc.: The Long, Bloody Reign of Canada's Sicilian Clan by Andr√© C√©dilot and Andr√© No√´l, Les √âditions de l'Homme, epilogue He refused to answer questions before a grand jury and was charged with criminal contempt of court. He later pleaded guilty to the charge in 2003, and was placed on a five-year probation. In late 2003, US law enforcement and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) listed Montagna as an \\"Acting Capo\\" and Caporegime of the Bonanno family on behalf of DeFilippo and the Sicilian faction based in the Bronx.  Acting boss  After longtime Bonanno boss \\"Big Joe\\" Massino became an informant in 2004, Vincent \\"Vinny Gorgeous\\" Basciano was recognized as the reputed Boss of the Bonanno crime family, only to discover that Massino would testify against Basciano as well. In 2006, as Basciano was facing jail time, he stated that he would promote the Sicilian faction of the old Bonanno crew back into the family's leadership, as Montagna was recognized as the reputed acting boss of the Bonanno crime family from 2006 until 2010, with Nicholas \\"Nicky Mouth\\" Santora as underboss and Anthony Rabito as consigliere, making the administration of the Bonanno crime family once again complete. At that time, Montagna gained the nickname \\"Bambino Boss\\" due to his relatively young age, being 35.Newsday, \\"Former Bonanno boss found dead in Canada\\" , Anthony M. Destefano, 24 November 2011 (accessed 25 November 2011) In 2008, Montagna was still the reputed acting boss of the Bonannos,\\"Feds: Montagna is new top man for Bonannos \\" controlling the entire Bronx faction of the family, as the Daily News linked Montagna to known Sicilian Bonanno official Baldassare \\"Baldo\\" Amato. On April 6, 2009, Montagna was arrested by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement as he left Matrix Steel. The 2003 criminal contempt conviction allowed U.S. authorities to strip him of his greencard and deport him to Canada; he was succeeded by Vincent Badalamenti as Bonanno family boss. According to mob writer Jerry Capeci, it was understood Montagna would have no standing or authority within Montreal's then-dominant Rizzuto crime family.  Montreal area activities  After a slide in power of the Rizzuto family, Montagna started to show his influence. Months prior to the assassination of Nicolo Rizzuto, he had tried to convince the old patriarch to step down, and let younger blood rule.The Globe and Mail, \\"Shot down in a ‚Äòsloppy‚Äô hit, another Montreal mobster dies\\" , Les Perreaux, 24 November 2011 (accessed 25 November 2011) In 2011, following the assassinations of several major Rizzuto mobsters starting in 2009, Montagna was identified as one of three major mobsters trying to fill the resulting power vacuum, if not take over the Montreal Mafia himself. Journal de Montr√©al, \\"Le dauphin du parrain abattu\\", Daniel Renaud, 25 November 2011 (accessed 25 November 2011) He, along with Joe Di Maulo and his brother-in-law Raynald Desjardins attempted to take control of Montreal's mafia from the Rizzuto family. Montagna and Desjardins had a falling out in 2011, later said to be over control of such aspects as loansharking and bookmaking in Montreal.  Death  Police responded to gunshots in a suburban district of Ile aux Tresors on November 24, 2011, and found the body of Salvatore Montagna on the shore of √éle Vaudry on the L'Assomption River, in the city of Charlemagne, Quebec, Canada, on Montreal's North Shore region. Witnesses reported that Montagna jumped in the river in an attempt to escape his killers. Law enforcement believed that Montagna was brought to the house of convicted smuggler Jack Arthur Simpson, as his vehicle was later found parked on a Montreal street. By June 2016, authorities were more specific as to how Montagna had died: \\"Montagna was shot three times inside Simpson's home ... and ran outside in a futile attempt to escape. After crossing a narrow section of the Assomption River, Montagna collapsed and was later declared dead in a hospital\\". The police investigation confirmed that Raynald Desjardin had taken part in the plot to murder Montagna, who, at the time, was suspected of trying to shake down Montreal-area construction companies, due to their alliance with the Rizzuto family. A number people were eventually arrested and charged, including Simpson and Desjardins. In 2016, Simpson, Vittorio Mirarchi, Calogero Milioto, Pietro Magistrale, Steven D'Addario, Steven Fracas and Felice Racaniello, all admitted to participating in the plot to kill Montagna and accepted plea deals except for Racaniello. In December 2016, Desjardins received a 14-year prison sentence, including time served. \\"The killing [of Montagna] is thought to be tied to a turf war for control of the Montreal Mafia\\", the CBC reported in 2015. In popular culture Montagna was portrayed by Joris Jarsky in the television drama series Bad Blood, which debuted in fall 2017, surrounding the Rizzuto crime family.

Painted in 1879 and exhibited at the Fourth Impressionist Exhibition in Paris that same year,National Gallery Catalogue entry it is now in the collection of the National Gallery in London. Description Degas visited the recently established Cirque Fernando at least four times between the 19th and 25th of January 1879. The star attraction was the act of Miss La La, a mixed-race acrobat, known as la femme canon. The nickname came from her most sensational trick, which was to fire a canon suspended on chains which she held in her teeth while she herself was hanging from the trapeze, hooked at the knee joints. The scene depicted in the painting however, comes from a different part of the act. It shows Miss La La, suspended from the rafters of the circus dome by a rope clenched between her teeth. This work is Degas's only circus painting. Unlike his contemporaries like Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and Georges Seurat, the focus is not on the action within the ring or the crowd's reactions; the viewer sees the spectacle as the audience would have done, gazing up at the daring feat taking place above. Degas may have also been seeking to emulate the expansive ceiling paintings by Italian artists such as Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, which he may have seen on his trips to Italy, in painting a highly foreshortened figure. The painting was bought by the trustees of the Courtauld Fund in 1925. Originally displayed in the Tate, it was transferred to the National Gallery in the 1950‚Äôs along with masterpieces by Manet, Renoir, Seurat and Van Gogh, once they were no longer regarded as modern.National Gallery: Samuel Courtauld  References   Further reading  * Degas, Miss La La, and the Cirque Fernando.

It was the northernmost state Catholic school in Europe. Lawside closed in June 2008, 101 years after it opened. The school's successor, St Paul's Academy. History Lawside was founded as an independent school for girls by the Sisters of Mercy in 1907, but soon began to admit boys. The school was operated on the same site as the convent, which was located on the lower slopes of the Dundee Law (the word means hill); hence the name of both convent and school. With the Education (Scotland) Act of 1918, the school chose to enter the state system as the Act laid out certain guarantees for denominational schools which came under state control. Amongst the prerogatives that Lawside had were that the rector or vice-rector would come from the Sisters of Mercy if one was suitably qualified. A member of the Sisters held the position of vice-rector into the 1970s. Whilst non- denominational schools tended to provide only a weekly period of religious education, Catholic schools were permitted a period each day, something which Lawside maintained until the 1990s, when this was reduced to three 40 min periods per week, then to two 50 min periods in 2005. A bonus particularly enjoyed by students until the late 1970s was that school began an hour later on days which were major religious feasts; this was to allow students to attend morning Mass in their respective parish churches. Until 1962, Lawside was both a primary and secondary school with many of its pupils attending only Lawside for the whole of their education. However, the primary intake of 1955 was to be the last, and from 1962, the school catered only for secondary level students. As the school enrollment grew, the need arose for physical expansion of the facilities. However, the convent grounds were unsuitable, and so the \\"Annex\\", a former primary school, was opened on Blackness Road. One bonus of being in the \\"Annex\\" was that it was much closer to the centre of town than the main school, and so afforded greater opportunity for lunch time wanderings. Both wings of the school moved to a new campus just off Macalpine Road in the northern part of Dundee in 1966. As was then traditional, the school was split into houses: St. Peters, St. Pauls and St. Andrews, the patron saint of Scotland; each had a housemaster and housemistress. Until the introduction of comprehensive education in the 1970s, Lawside served as the only Catholic academy for a long way, with students travelling from places such as Perth, Forfar, Arbroath and northern Fife. School badge The school badge was of an unusual design, resembling a three leafed clover, which represented the Holy Trinity. It consisted of the crossed keys of Saint Peter surmounted by a papal tiara. The letters \\"L.A.\\" for Lawside Academy were found in the two lower circles, whilst the school motto \\"Laborare et Orare\\" (\\"to work and to pray\\") from the Order of St Benedict curved around the edge. Closure In 2002, Dundee City Council decided to merge Lawside with St Saviour's RC High School which served Catholic children from the eastern side of the city, and the appointed rector of the new school, Moria Leck, decided to call the new school St Paul's Academy. Paul is the middle name of the Right Reverend Vincent Paul Logan, the Catholic bishop of the Diocese of Dunkeld in which Dundee is located. The schools merged for the new academic year 2008-2009, one year after Lawside's centenary celebrations in 2007.

Contraceptives of this type are not currently available for human use. Typically immunocontraception involves the administration of a vaccine that induces an adaptive immune response which causes an animal to become temporarily infertile. Contraceptive vaccines have been used in numerous settings for the control of wildlife populations. However, experts in the field believe that major innovations are required before immunocontraception can become a practical form of contraception for human beings. Thus far immunocontraception has focused on mammals exclusively. There are several targets in mammalian sexual reproduction for immune inhibition. They can be organized into three categories. ;Gamete production: Organisms that undergo sexual reproduction must first produce gametes, cells which have half the typical number of chromosomes of the species. Often immunity that prevents gamete production also inhibits secondary sexual characteristics and so has effects similar to castration. ;Gamete function: After gametes are produced in sexual reproduction, two gametes must combine during fertilization to form a zygote, which again has the full typical number of chromosomes of the species. Methods that target gamete function prevent this fertilization from occurring and are true contraceptives. ;Gamete outcome: Shortly after fertilization a zygote develops into a multicellular embryo that in turn develops into a larger organism. In placental mammals this process of gestation occurs inside the reproductive system of the mother of the embryo. Immunity that targets gamete outcome induces abortion of an embryo while it is within its mother's reproductive system. Medical use Immunocontraception in not currently available but is under study.  Obstacles  = Variability of immunogenicity = In order for an immunocontraceptive to be palatable for human use, it would need to meet or exceed the efficacy rates of currently popular forms of contraception. Currently the maximum reduction of fertility due to sperm vaccines in laboratory experiments with mice is ~75%. The lack of efficacy is due to variability of immunogenicity from one animal to another. Even when exposed to the same exact vaccine, some animals will produce abundant antibody titers to the vaccine's antigen, while others produce relatively low antibody titers. In the Eppin trial that attained 100% infertility, a small sample size (only 9 monkeys) was used, and even among this small sample 2 monkeys were dropped from the study because they failed to produce sufficiently high antibody titers. This trend--high efficacy when antibody titers are above a threshold coupled with variability in how many animals reach such a threshold--is seen throughout immunocontraception and immune-based birth control research. A long-term study of PZP vaccination in deer that spanned 6 years found that infertility was directly related to antibody titers to PZP. The phase II clinical trial of hCG vaccines was quite successful among women who had antibody titers above 50 ng/mL, but quite poor among those with antibody titers below this threshold. = Lack of mucosal immunity = Mucosal immunity, which includes immune function in the female reproductive tract, is not as well understood as humoral immunity. This may be an issue for certain contraceptive vaccines. For instance, in the second LDH-C4 primate trial that had negative results, all of the immunized macaque monkeys developed high antibody titers against LDH-C4 in serum, but antibodies against LDH-C4 were not found in the monkeys' vaginal fluids. If antibodies against LDH-C4 do indeed inhibit fertilization, then this result highlights how the difference in the functioning of mucosal immunity from humoral immunity may be critical to the efficacy of contraceptive vaccines.  Adverse effects  Whenever an immune response is provoked, there is some risk of autoimmunity. Therefore, immunocontraception trials typically check for signs of autoimmune disease. One concern with zona pellucida vaccination, in particular, is that in certain cases it appears to be correlated with ovarian pathogenesis. However, ovarian disease has not been observed in every trial of zona pellucida vaccination, and when observed, has not always been irreversible.  Gamete production   Gonadotropin-releasing hormone  The production of gametes is induced in both male and female mammals by the same two hormones: follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). The production of these in turn is induced by a single releasing hormone, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which has been the focus of most of the research into immunocontraception against gamete production. GnRH is secreted by the hypothalamus in pulses and travels to the anterior pituitary gland through a portal venous system. There it stimulates the production of FSH and LH. FSH and LH travel through the general circulatory system and stimulate the functioning of the gonads, including the production of gametes and the secretion of sex steroid hormones. Immunity against GnRH thus lessens FSH and LH production which in turn attenuates gamete production and secondary sexual characteristics. While GnRH immunity has been known to have contraceptive effects for some time, only in the 2000s has it been used to develop several commercial vaccines. Equity¬Æ Oestrus Control is a GnRH vaccine marketed for use in non-breeding domestic horses. Repro-Bloc is GnRH vaccine marketed for use in domestic animals in general. Improvac¬Æ is a GnRH vaccine marketed for use in pigs not as a contraceptive, but as an alternative to physical castration for the control of boar taint. Unlike the other products which are marketed for use in domestic animals, GonaCon‚Ñ¢ is a GnRH vaccine being developed as a United States Department of Agriculture initiative for use for control of wildlife, specifically deer. GonaCon has also been used on a trial basis to control kangaroos in Australia.  Gamete function  The form of sexual reproduction practiced by most placental mammals is anisogamous, requiring two kinds of dissimilar gametes, and allogamous, such that each individual only produces one of the two kinds of gametes. The smaller gamete is the sperm cell and is produced by males of the species. The larger gamete is the ovum and is produced by females of the species. Under this scheme, fertilization requires two gametes, one from an individual of each sex, in order to occur. Immunocontraception targeting the female gamete has focused on the zona pellucida. Immunocontraception targeting the male gamete has involved many different antigens associated with sperm function.  Zona pellucida  The zona pellucida is a glycoprotein membrane surrounding the plasma membrane of an ovum. The zona pellucida's main function in reproduction is to bind sperm. Immunity against zonae pellucidae causes an animal to produce antibodies that themselves are bound by a zona pellucida. Thus when a sperm encounters an ovum in an animal immunized against zonae pellucidae, the sperm cannot bind to the ovum because its zona pellucida has already been occupied by antibodies. Therefore, fertilization does not occur. = Early research = Work begun by researchers at the University of Tennessee in the 1970s into immunity against zonae pellucidae resulted in its identification as a target antigen for immunocontraception. The zona pellucida's suitability is a result of it being necessary for fertilization and containing at least one antigen that is tissue-specific and not species- specific. The tissue-specificity implies that immunity against zonae pellucidae will not also affect other tissues in the immunized animal's body. The lack of species-specificity implies that zonae pellucidae harvested from animals of one species will induce an immune response in those of another, which makes zona pellucida antigens readily available, since zonae pellucidae can be harvested from farm animals. = Zonagen = In 1987, a pharmaceutical company called Zonagen (later renamed Repros Therapeutics) was started with the goal of developing zona pellucida vaccines as an alternative to the surgical sterilization of companion animals and eventually as a contraceptive for human use. The products would be based on research being done at the Baylor College of Medicine by Bonnie S. Dunbar that was funded by Zonagen. However, the relationship between Zonagen and Bonnie Dunbar ended acrimoniously in 1993. Despite claims later that year that development of a contraceptive vaccine was imminent and an agreement with Schering AG for funding for joint development of a contraceptive vaccine for human use, no vaccine was made commercially available and the agreement with Schering was terminated after primate studies were disappointing. The company would go on to pursue other projects and be renamed. = Application to wildlife population control = Also in the late 1980s, research began into the use of vaccines based around zonae pellucidae harvested from pigs for the purpose of wildlife control. Such porcine zona pellucida (PZP) vaccines were tested in captive and domestic horses in 1986 with encouraging results. This led to the first successful field trial of contraceptive vaccines with free-ranging wildlife, which examined PZP vaccines used upon wild horses of Assateague Island National Seashore in 1988. The successful results of the field trial were maintained by annual booster inoculations. Following the success of trials with horses, initial trials using captive animals showed promise for the use of PZP vaccines with white-tailed deer and with African elephants. This led to successful field trials of PZP vaccines in white-tailed deer at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Front Royal, VA from September 1992 to September 1994 and in African elephants of Kruger National Park in South Africa in 1996. As a result of these successes, PZP vaccination has become the most popular form of immunocontraception for wildlife. As of 2011, thousands of animals are treated with PZP vaccination every year, including 6 different species of free-ranging wildlife in 52 different locations and 76 captive exotic species in 67 different zoological gardens. = Bio Farma = In 2012, researchers from Brawijaya University in conjunction with pharmaceutical company Bio Farma received a grant from the Indonesian government to develop a zona pellucida contraceptive vaccine for human use. Instead of pigs, the zonae pellucidae for the program are harvested from cows. The program hopes to mass-produce a contraceptive vaccine in Indonesia in 2013 at the earliest. = Viral and microbial vectors = While contraceptive vaccines can be delivered remotely, they still require administration to each individual animal that is to be made infertile. Thus contraceptive vaccines have been used to control only relatively small populations of wildlife. Australia and New Zealand have large populations of European invasive species for which such approach will not scale. Research in these countries has therefore focused on genetically modifying viruses or microorganisms that infect the unwanted invasive species to contain immunocontraceptive antigens. Such research has included targeting the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) in Australia by engineering rabbit zona pellucida glycoproteins into a recombinant myxoma virus. This approach has induced marginal reduction of fertility in laboratory rabbits with some of the glycoproteins. Further improvement of efficacy is necessary before such an approach is ready for field trials. Research has also targeted the house mouse (Mus domesticus) in Australia by engineering murine zona pellucida antigens into a recombinant ectromelia virus and a recombinant cytomegalovirus. The latter approach has induced permanent infertility when injected into laboratory mice. However, there is some attenuation of efficacy when it is actually transmitted virally. In addition to rabbits and mice, this approach has been explored for other animals. Researchers have attempted to replicate similar results when targeting the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) in Australia using such vectors as Salmonella typhimurium, vaccinia, and canine herpesvirus, but no reduction in fertility has been achieved thus far for a variety of reasons. Initial exploration into the control of the common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) in New Zealand using the nematode Parastrongyloides trichosuri has identified it as a possible immunocontraceptive vector.  Sperm  In placental mammals, fertilization typically occurs inside the female in the oviducts. The oviducts are positioned near the ovaries where ova are produced. An ovum therefore needs only to travel a short distance to the oviducts for fertilization. In contrast sperm cells must be highly motile, since they are deposited into the female reproductive tract during copulation and must travel through the cervix (in some species) as well as the uterus and the oviduct (in all species) to reach an ovum. Sperm cells that are motile are spermatozoa. Spermatozoa are protected from the male's immune system by the blood-testis barrier. However, spermatozoa are deposited into the female in semen, which is mostly the secretions of the seminal vesicles, prostate gland, and bulbourethral glands. In this way antibodies generated by the male are deposited into the female along with spermatozoa. Because of this and the extensive travel in the female reproductive tract, spermatozoa are susceptible to anti-sperm antibodies generated by the male in addition to waiting anti- sperm antibodies generated by the female. = Early research = In 1899, the discovery of the existence of antibodies against sperm was made independently both by Serge Metchnikoff of the Pasteur Institute and by Nobel prize laureate Karl Landsteiner. In 1929, the first recorded attempt at immunocontraception was made by Morris Baskin, clinical director of the Denver Maternal Hygiene Committee. In this trial 20 women who were known to have at least 1 prior pregnancy were injected with their husband's semen, and no conception was recorded in 1 year of observation of these couples. A United States patent (number 2103240) was issued in 1937 for this approach as a contraceptive, but no product for widespread consumption ever came from this approach. = Renewed interest = Throughout the 1990s, there was a resurgence of research in immunocontraception targeting sperm with the hope of developing a contraceptive vaccine for human use. Unlike earlier research which explored the contraceptive effect of immune responses to whole sperm cells, contemporary research has focused on searching for specific molecular antigens that are involved with sperm function. Antigens that have been identified as potential targets for immunocontraception include the sperm- specific peptides or proteins ADAM, LDH-C4, sp10, sp56, P10G, fertilization antigen 1 (FA-1), sp17, SOB2, A9D, CD52, YLP12, Eppin, CatSper, Izumo, sperm associated antigen 9 (SPAG9), 80 kilodalton human sperm antigen (80 kDa HSA), and nuclear autoantigenic sperm protein (tNASP). Early primate trials had mixed results. One study examined the sperm-specific isozyme of human lactate dehydrogenase (LDH-C4) combined with a T-cell epitope to create a synthetic peptide that acted as a more potent chimeric antigen. Vaccination of female baboons with this synthetic peptide resulted in a reduced fertility in the trial. However, a second study that examined vaccination of female macaque monkeys with the same synthetic peptide did not find reduced fertility. Since then, a study examining vaccination based on an epididymal protease inhibitor (Eppin) in male macaque monkeys demonstrated that vaccination against sperm antigens could be an effective, reversible contraceptive in male primates. While 4 of 6 control monkeys impregnated females during the trial, none of the 7 monkeys included in the trial that were vaccinated against Eppin impregnated females, and 4 of these 7 vaccinated monkeys recovered their fertility within a year and a half of observation after the trial. This illustrated that not only could sperm immunocontraception be effective, but it could have several advantages over zona pellucida vaccines. For instance, sperm vaccines could be used by males, in addition to females. Additionally, while there are relatively few glycoproteins in the zona pellucida and thus relatively few target antigens for zona pellucida vaccines, more than a dozen prospective target antigens for the inhibition of sperm function have been identified. This relative abundance of prospective target antigens makes the prospects of a multivalent vaccine better for sperm vaccines. A study which examined the use of one such multivalent vaccine in female macaque monkeys found that the monkeys produced antibodies against all antigens included in the vaccine, suggesting the efficacy of the multivalent approach. Finally, while there has been autoimmune ovarian pathogenesis found in some trials using zona pellucida vaccines, anti-sperm antibodies are not likely to have adverse health effects, since anti-sperm antibodies are produced by up to 70% of men who have had vasectomies, and there has been much investigation into possible adverse health side-effects of the vasectomy procedure. = Passive immunity = A vaccine induces active immunity when antigens are injected into an animal that cause it to produce desired antibodies itself. In passive immunity the desired antibody titers are achieved by injecting antibodies directly into an animal. The efficacy of such an approach for immunocontraception was demonstrated as early as the 1970s with antibodies against zonae pellucidae in mice during the investigation of the mechanism by which such antibodies inhibited fertility. Because the variability of individual immune response is an obstacle to bringing contraceptive vaccines to market, there has been research into the approach of contraception through passive immunization as an alternative that would be of less duration, but be closer to market. Research done using phage display technology on lymphocytes from immunoinfertile men led to the isolation, characterization, and synthesis of specific antibodies that inhibit fertility by acting against several of the known sperm antigens. This detailed molecular knowledge of antisperm antibodies may be of use in the development of a passive immunocontraceptive product.  Gamete outcome   Human chorionic gonadotropin  Most of the research into immunity that inhibits gamete outcome has focused on human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). hCG is not necessary for fertilization, but is secreted by embryos shortly thereafter. Therefore, immunity against hCG does not prevent fertilization. However, it was found that anti-hCG antibodies prevent marmoset embryos from implanting in the endometrium of their mother's uterus. The main function of hCG is to sustain the ovarian corpus luteum during pregnancy past the time it would normally decay as part of the regular menstrual cycle. For the first 7‚Äì9 weeks in humans, the corpus luteum secretes the progesterone necessary to maintain the viability of the endometrium for pregnancy. Therefore, immunity against hCG during this time frame would function as an abortifacient, as confirmed by experiments in baboons. In the scientific literature the more inclusive term \\"birth control vaccine\\" rather than \\"contraceptive vaccine\\" is used to refer to hCG vaccines. = Clinical trials = Research begun in the 1970s led to clinical trials in humans of a hCG birth control vaccine. A phase I (safety) clinical trial examined 15 women from clinics in Helsinki, Finland, Uppsala, Sweden, Bahia, Brazil, and Santiago, Chile with a vaccine formed by conjugating the beta subunit of hCG with a tetanus toxoid. The women had previously had tubal ligations. In the trial the immune response was reversible and no significant health issues were found. This was followed by another phase I trial in 1977-1978 examining previously sterilized women at 5 institutions in India with a more potent vaccine that combined the beta subunit of hCG with the alpha subunit of ovine luteinizing hormone to form a heterospecies dimer conjugated with both tetanus toxoid and diphtheria toxoid. The multiple carriers were used because it was found that a small percentage of women acquired carrier-specific immunosuppression due to repeated injection of conjugates with the same carrier. This more potent version of the vaccine was used in a phase II (efficacy) trial during 1991-1993 conducted at 3 locations: the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Safdarjung Hospital in New Delhi, and the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research in Chandigarh. Primary immunization consisted of 3 injections at 6 week intervals, and 148 women known to be previously fertile completed primary immunization. All women generated antibodies against hCG, but only 119 (80%) generated antibody titers clearly above 50 ng/mL, which was the estimated level for efficacy. Blood samples were taken twice a month, and booster injections were given when antibody titers declined below 50 ng/mL in women who wished to continue using the vaccine. At the completion of the study after 1224 menstrual cycles observed, only 1 pregnancy occurred in a woman having an antibody titer level above 50 ng/mL, and 26 pregnancies occurred among women who had titers below 50 ng/mL. = Application to cancer therapy = Following these clinical trails of hCG vaccination as a birth control method, hCG was discovered to be expressed in certain kinds of malignant neoplasms, including breast cancer, adenocarcinoma of the prostate, progressive vulvar carcinoma, carcinoma of the bladder, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, cervical carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, squamous-cell carcinoma of the oral cavity and oropharynx, lung carcinoma, and colorectal cancer. Therefore, immunity against hCG has applications such as imaging of cancer cells, selective delivery of cytotoxic compounds to tumor cells, and in at least one case, direct therapeutic effect by preventing establishment, inhibiting the growth, and causing the necrosis of tumors. This has led to interest in developing hCG vaccines specifically for cancer treatment. = Ongoing research = The vaccine tested in the phase II clinical trial in India did not proceed further because it produced antibody titers of 50 ng/mL for at least 3 months duration in only 60% of women in the trial. Ongoing research in hCG birth control vaccines has focused on improving immunogenicity. A vaccine in which the beta subunit of hCG is fused to the B subunit of Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin has been effective in laboratory mice. It has been approved by the Indian National Review Committee on Genetic Manipulation and is being produced for pre-clinical toxicology testing. If it is determined to be safe, it is planned for clinical trials.  Wildlife control  Immunocontraception is one of the few alternatives to lethal methods for the direct control of wildlife populations. While there was research into the use of hormonal contraception for wildlife control as early as the 1950s that produced pharmacologically effective products, they all proved to be ineffective for wildlife control for a variety of practical reasons. Field trials of immunocontraception in wildlife, on the other hand, established that contraceptive vaccines could be delivered remotely by capture gun, were safe to use in pregnant animals, were reversible, and induced long-lasting infertility, overcoming these practical limitations. One concern about the use of hormonal contraceptives in general, but especially in wildlife, is that the sex steroid hormones that are used are easily passed from animal to animal. This can lead to unintended ecological consequences. For instance, fish exposed to treated sewage effluents were found to have concentrations of the synthetic hormone levonorgestrel in blood plasma higher than those found in humans taking hormonal contraceptives. Because the antigens used in contraceptive vaccines are protein, not steroids, they are not easily passed from animal to animal without loss of function.

Under the provisions of this Act, all baptism, marriage and burial entries in each parish register were subject to a tax of 3d (old pence). Church ministers were empowered to collect the duty, and were allowed to keep 10% of this fee as compensation for their trouble. Refusal to pay carried a fine of five pounds. This was a deeply unpopular tax, and many clergymen were sympathetic to the plight of their parishioners, and as paupers were exempt from this tax, it is not uncommon for family history researchers and genealogists to find that the number of supposed poor people within a parish has increased many times above normal during these years until the act was finally repealed in 1794. Such entries in a parish register are annotated with either the letter \\"P.\\" or \\"Pauper\\". If a family could not claim exemption then it was not unusual for them simply not to bother, and this would result in a number of adult \\"late\\" baptisms during the following decades. The Act was repealed by section 1 of the Act 34 Geo.3 c.11.

There are many artists across the world that advocate environmentalism such as the Barenaked Ladies, Bonnie Raitt, Cloud Cult, Dave Matthews Band, Don Henley, Drake, Gorillaz, Green Day, Guster, Jack Johnson, King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard, KT Tunstall, Metallica, Moby, Pearl Jam, Perry Farrell, Phish, The Roots, Sarah Harmer, Sheryl Crow, Thom Yorke, Willie Nelson, and many others.Grist Staff, \\"22 Jun 2007 15 Green Musicians and Bands.\\"Grist, June 27, 2007. http://grist.org/article/musicians/ (accessed November 21, 2012).Coscarelli, . \\"The 15 Most Eco-Friendly Rockers.\\"Rolling Stone, Dec 16, 2010. https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/the-15-most- eco-friendly-rockers-20101216 (accessed November 21, 2012). In addition to being a topic of music, Environmentalism has been increasingly prevalent among artists and the music industry itself.

Popular music from the 1960s‚Äì2000s In the 1960s and 1970s a growing amount of popular music inspired by the counterculture movement reflected anti-war sentiments of peace and harmony. \\"Big Yellow Taxi\\" by Joni Mitchell was a song about environmental degradation with lyrics such as \\"They paved Paradise, put up a parking lot\\". Her reference to DDT in the song is a reflection of the times as Rachel Carson's 1962 book Silent Spring had brought the dangers of DDT into the spotlight. John Denver, a country and folk singer often sang about the wilderness of Colorado with popular songs such as \\"Rocky Mountain High\\" and \\"Take Me Home, Country Roads\\". Black Sabbath's song \\"War Pigs\\" is an anti-war song that was extremely influential to young Americans across the nation. Many consider the wave of environmentalism in the era to be the foundation of metal music in the world. A song titled \\"Blackened\\" by Metallica is another song that supports environmentalism as is said in the lyrics \\"Blackened is the end, winter it will send, throwing all you see, into obscurity.\\" This song says that if war and rampage continue, the earth around us will die. Environmentalism is still prevalent today as it continues to shape our way of life and forms of music. In 1995 singer Michael Jackson came out with the hit \\"Earth Song\\" which was about environmental and animal welfare. The production of the music video had an environmental theme, showing images of animal cruelty, deforestation, pollution, poverty and war. Jackson and the world's people unite in a spiritual chant‚Äî\\"Earth Song\\"‚Äîwhich summons a force that heals the world. Using special effects, time is reversed so that life returns, war ends, and the forests regrow. The video closes with a request for donations to Jackson's Heal the World Foundation.George, p. 48‚Äì50 Michael Jackson HIStory on Film volume II VHS/DVD The clip was shown infrequently in the United States. In 2007, a massive concert entitled Live Earth (2007 concert) was held across the world to raise awareness and provoke action on climate change.

This sparked songs about the invisibility of environmental effects like radioactive isotopes. In his song \\"Mack the Bomb,\\" Pete Seeger wrote a comparison between a shark and Strontium-90, explaining that the threat of a shark is at least visible, unlike radioactive isotopes. In 1962, Malvina Reynolds also wrote a song called \\"What Have They Done to the Rain?\\", which was inspired by above-ground nuclear testing, and how it was putting Strontium-90 into the air, then into soil through rain, which is how it got into cows and their milk. Pete Seeger released what is considered the first environmentalist album, entitled \\"God Bless the Grass\\" in 1966. The 1960s produced a large amount of environmental-focused songs, primarily due to the popularization of folk music and the musicians that penned many environmental protest songs, in that genre.

Written by Blanche Hanalis, the film is based on a story by Jane Trahey about an old-line Mother Superior who is challenged by a modern young nun when they take the girls of St. Francis Academy on a bus trip across the United States. Released on April 10, 1968, Where Angels Go, Trouble Follows is a sequel to The Trouble with Angels (1966). Russell, Mary Wickes, Binnie Barnes and Dolores Sutton all reprise their roles as nuns from the original film. Wickes would later don the habit yet again for her amusing turn in both Sister Act (1992) and the sequel, Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit (1993). Plot The story depicts the rivalry between the conservative Mother Superior (Russell) and the glamorous, liberal progressive young Sister George (Stevens) as they shepherd a busload of Catholic high school girls across America to an interfaith youth rally being held in Santa Barbara, California. As they debate expressions of faith and role of the Church in the tumultuous America of the sixties, they must also contend with the antics of two rebellious, trouble-prone students, Rosabelle (Susan Saint James) and Marvel Anne (Barbara Hunter).

Unlike, say, Lebesgue measure, which measures a set's volume or physical extent, capacity is a mathematical analogue of a set's ability to hold electrical charge. More precisely, it is the capacitance of the set: the total charge a set can hold while maintaining a given potential energy. The potential energy is computed with respect to an idealized ground at infinity for the harmonic or Newtonian capacity, and with respect to a surface for the condenser capacity. Historical note The notion of capacity of a set and of \\"capacitable\\" set was introduced by Gustave Choquet in 1950: for a detailed account, see reference . Definitions Condenser capacity Let Œ£ be a closed, smooth, (n ‚àí 1)-dimensional hypersurface in n-dimensional Euclidean space ‚Ñùn, n ‚â• 3; K will denote the n-dimensional compact (i.e., closed and bounded) set of which Œ£ is the boundary. Let S be another (n ‚àí 1)-dimensional hypersurface that encloses Œ£: in reference to its origins in electromagnetism, the pair (Œ£, S) is known as a condenser. The condenser capacity of Œ£ relative to S, denoted C(Œ£, S) or cap(Œ£, S), is given by the surface integral :C(\\\\Sigma, S) = - \\\\frac1{(n - 2) \\\\sigma_{n}} \\\\int_{S'} \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial u}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\sigma', where: * u is the unique harmonic function defined on the region D between Œ£ and S with the boundary conditions u(x) = 1 on Œ£ and u(x) = 0 on S; * S‚Ä≤ is any intermediate surface between Œ£ and S; * ŒΩ is the outward unit normal field to S‚Ä≤ and ::\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial u} (x) = abla u (x) \\\\cdot u (x) :is the normal derivative of u across S‚Ä≤; and * œÉn = 2œÄn‚ÅÑ2 ‚ÅÑ Œì(n ‚ÅÑ 2) is the surface area of the unit sphere in ‚Ñùn. C(Œ£, S) can be equivalently defined by the volume integral :C(\\\\Sigma, S) = \\\\frac1{(n - 2) \\\\sigma_{n}} \\\\int_{D}  abla u ^{2}\\\\mathrm{d}x. The condenser capacity also has a variational characterization: C(Œ£, S) is the infimum of the Dirichlet's energy functional :I[v] = \\\\frac1{(n - 2) \\\\sigma_{n}} \\\\int_{D}  abla v ^{2}\\\\mathrm{d}x over all continuously-differentiable functions v on D with v(x) = 1 on Œ£ and v(x) = 0 on S. Harmonic/Newtonian capacity Heuristically, the harmonic capacity of K, the region bounded by Œ£, can be found by taking the condenser capacity of Œ£ with respect to infinity. More precisely, let u be the harmonic function in the complement of K satisfying u = 1 on Œ£ and u(x) ‚Üí 0 as x ‚Üí ‚àû. Thus u is the Newtonian potential of the simple layer Œ£. Then the harmonic capacity (also known as the Newtonian capacity) of K, denoted C(K) or cap(K), is then defined by :C(K) = \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^n\\\\setminus K}  abla u^2\\\\mathrm{d}x. If S is a rectifiable hypersurface completely enclosing K, then the harmonic capacity can be equivalently rewritten as the integral over S of the outward normal derivative of u: :C(K) = \\\\int_S \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial u}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\sigma. The harmonic capacity can also be understood as a limit of the condenser capacity. To wit, let Sr denote the sphere of radius r about the origin in ‚Ñùn. Since K is bounded, for sufficiently large r, Sr will enclose K and (Œ£, Sr) will form a condenser pair. The harmonic capacity is then the limit as r tends to infinity: :C(K) = \\\\lim_{r \\\\to \\\\infty} C(\\\\Sigma, S_{r}). The harmonic capacity is a mathematically abstract version of the electrostatic capacity of the conductor K and is always non-negative and finite: 0 ‚â§ C(K) < +‚àû. Generalizations The characterization of the capacity of a set as the minimum of an energy functional achieving particular boundary values, given above, can be extended to other energy functionals in the calculus of variations. Divergence form elliptic operators Solutions to a uniformly elliptic partial differential equation with divergence form : abla \\\\cdot ( A abla u ) = 0 are minimizers of the associated energy functional :I[u] = \\\\int_D ( abla u)^T A ( abla u)\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}x subject to appropriate boundary conditions. The capacity of a set E with respect to a domain D containing E is defined as the infimum of the energy over all continuously-differentiable functions v on D with v(x) = 1 on E; and v(x) = 0 on the boundary of D. The minimum energy is achieved by a function known as the capacitary potential of E with respect to D, and it solves the obstacle problem on D with the obstacle function provided by the indicator function of E. The capacitary potential is alternately characterized as the unique solution of the equation with the appropriate boundary conditions.

Early life  Henry Ralph Lumley was the son of Robert and Florence (n√©e Fiske) Lumley, his father was a barrister and dramatic author and his mother an actress. Henry attended Christ's Hospital school, Horsham from 1902 to 1908. He became an employee of the Eastern Telegraph Company. At the start of the war he was commissioned as an officer in the Royal Flying Corps and went to the Central Flying School for pilot training.  Accident  As he graduated from the Central Flying School the aircraft he was flying crashed. Lumley was badly burned, losing his lips, eyebrows, and most of the skin on his face. His left eye was burned out, and his right eye was mostly blind.  Surgery  Lumley was transferred to Sidcup on 22 September 1917, for reconstructive surgery. The surgical team, led by Harold Gillies, decided to reconstruct Henry's face using a huge skin graft from his chest. The scar tissue would be removed, and the graft would be stitched into place. Tubed pedicles would be employed to provide sailors, William Vicarage, who had received severe cordite burns at the Battle of Jutland. The operation was performed in stages. The first, on 24 October 1917, outlined the chest graft and created the tubed pedicles at the neck. The second, more major, operation occurred on 15 February 1918. The scar tissue was excised, effectively removing all traces of Lumley's 'old' face, and the graft was stitched into place. Unfortunately, because of the size of the graft and Lumley's already weakened state, the chest skin was rejected and Henry died of heart failure on 11 March 1918.  Legacy  After Lumley's death Gillies realised that he had tried to do too much too quickly, and that large facial grafts were more hazardous than expected. As a result he began using smaller staged grafts to create the overall result instead of a single large graft. The lessons learned from the failure of Henry Ralph Lumley's surgery would go on to help thousands of people suffering with extreme facial burns.

Overview  The MFDF was formed in 2002, growing out of the Mutual Fund Directors Education Council, a partnership between the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the mutual fund industry. The Council was convened in 1999, in response to SEC chairman Arthur Levitt's call for improved fund governance and better education of mutual fund directors. Although all persons in the mutual fund industry are able to participate in the Forum's events, actual membership in the Forum is restricted to independent directors or trustees of mutual funds. Today, the Forum's primary activities are the creation and production of educational programs, the publication of reports on best practice guidance,MFDF and advocacy on behalf of its members. For example, in 2003, the Forum was asked by the then SEC Chairman William H. Donaldson to prepare best practice guidance in key areas of director decision- making, such as monitoring fees and conflicts, overseeing compliance, and important issues such as valuation and pricing of fund portfolio securities and fund shares.SEC In response to this request, the Forum published its \\"Report of the Mutual Fund Directors Forum on Best Practices and Practical Guidance for Mutual Fund Directors\\" in July 2004.MFDF The report was well received by the SEC.SEC Frequently, members of the Forum's staff are consulted and quoted by the financial press in news stories concerning mutual fund directors and the mutual fund industry as a whole. In addition, op-ed letters by Forum staff on topics important to the mutual fund industry have appeared in the Wall Street Journal and mutual fund industry publications. Significantly, in 2002, the Mutual Fund Directors Forum applied for and received an exemptive order from the SEC allowing the payment by mutual funds, pursuant to the authorization of their boards of directors, of the dues of their independent directors for membership in the Forum, as well as Forum- related expenses; and finding that these payments do not violate Section 17(d) and Rule 17d-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which prohibit funds from participating in joint transactions with affiliated persons on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of any other participant.SEC Notes  References  #Mutual Fund Directors Forum Library, \\"Reports and Best Practices Guidance\\" #Testimony of William H.

She was instrumental in campaigning all over East Pakistan for the Six Point program of regional autonomy drafted by the Awami League, and on June 7, 1966, organized the general strike along with Mizanur Rahman Chowdhury. This strike was observed throughout the then East Pakistan and was the first major indication that an independent Bangladesh was imminent. She later took over as president of the Jatiya League. She died in Dhaka on 7 April 1989. Education and early career Begum passed Matriculation and Intermediate examination from Nawab Faizunnesa Girls' School in 1940 and Eden Girls' College in 1942 respectively. She joined East Pakistan Awami Muslim League in 1950. She was elected a member of the East Bengal Legislative Assembly in 1954 as a united front candidate in the reserve seats for women in Comilla-Sylhet constituency. Begum was elected as secretary of women affairs in central executive committee of Awami League in 1966 which office she held till 1970. At the initial stage of the six-point program in 1966, when the top ranking leaders of Awami League including its president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and general secretary Tajuddin Ahmed were arrested, Begum was made the acting general secretary of the party on 27 July 1966. Begum had a pivotal role in helming the affairs of the party in that critical period of repression of the autocratic Ayub government upon the activists of the party throughout the country. She played an important role in organizing the Six-point Movement and maintaining liaison with the Awami League activists working to that end. She contributed a lot to the floating of eleven points Movement of the students in October 1968 and in organizing the anti-Ayub mass upsurge in 1969. Begum was serious in asserting her subsequent position in Awami League, and in the following convention (1970) claimed the portfolio of general secretary of the party. Her expectation being denied, Begum resigned from Awami League and later joined the newly floated (1969) Jatiya League headed by Ataur Rahman Khan. She was elected as senior vice president of Jatiya League on 20 August 1970. Begum contested in the Pakistan National Assembly election in 1970 from Dhaka-9 constituency as a nominee of Jatiya League only to sustain a reverse. Post-independence With the revival of Jatiya League in 1976 under the Political Parties Regulations of the martial law government, Begum became active in politics as senior vice president of the party. She took part in the movement against the military rule of Hussain Muhammad Ershad with her party as a member of the seven-party alliance. After the party president Ataur Rahman Khan joined the cabinet of General Ershad as Prime Minister in 1984, Begum re-organised Jatiya League and took over as president of the party.

The station, established in 1945, was last owned by Birmingham Christian Radio, Inc. Due to transmitter damage caused by a lightning strike, WNUZ was temporarily off the air from August 2008 through August 2009. Programming WPPT broadcast a Gospel music format to the Anniston, Alabama, area. The station aired a mix of local and syndicated programming. History WHTB era This station first signed on in 1945 as WHTB, broadcasting with 250 watts of power at 1230 kHz under the ownership of Voice of Talladega, Inc. That company, 80% owned by the Talladega Publishing Company which published the Talladega Daily Home and the weekly Talladega News, signed on WHTB-FM as a sister station in 1953. WNUZ era WHTB was sold to Radio Alabama, Inc., on June 1, 1959. The new owners had the call letters changed to WNUZ shortly after they acquired the station. In 1968, the station upgraded its daytime signal to 1,000 watts. After more than 37 years of continuous ownership, Radio Alabama, Inc., reached an agreement in March 1997 to sell this station to Birmingham Christian Radio, Inc. The deal was approved by the FCC on May 13, 1997, and the transaction was consummated on September 10, 1997. Falling silent Beginning in October 2005, WNUZ began experiencing a series of technical issues that kept the station from broadcasting for months at a time in 2005 and 2006. The station fell silent again in July 2007 and stayed off the air for more than six months due to new technical issues with the transmitter. On August 22, 2008, WNUZ \\"suffered direct lightning strikes\\" during Tropical Storm Fay which resulted in \\"the complete destruction of the station's transmitter\\" and caused unspecified damage to other electrical broadcast equipment at the station. The station applied to the FCC for authority to stay silent while their engineers repaired or replaced the damaged gear and evaluated the station's other equipment. On December 24, 2008, WNUZ was granted permission to remain off the air until no later than June 22, 2009. The station resumed normal broadcast operations on August 19, 2009. WPPT era On March 5, 2012, the station's call sign was changed to WPPT. On April 6, 2012, the FCC cancelled WPPT's license because the station did not apply to renew its license.

Licensed to Sylacauga, Alabama, United States, and two of only three commercial radio stations in Talladega County, they are owned and operated by Marble City Media LLC. Station history At 7:00 a.m. on May 16, 1948, what is now WYEA-AM was born as WMLS-AM. A license was granted by the Federal Communications Commission on Dec. 23, 1947, and construction began on January 5, 1948. The original Raytheon RA-1000 transmitter, serial number 213, in constant use until being replaced on January 28, 2012, is showcased in the Alabama Historical Radio Society museum in Birmingham. Studios and offices were originally located above the T&J; Caf√© at 11¬Ω W. Second St. in downtown Sylacauga, although the tower and transmitter were north of the city in an area with no address later known as 1 Motes Rd. Gertrude Tyson, host of the station's popular Friendly Neighbor program, later explained: \\"WMLS had its beginning as a dream in the minds of four young Sylacauga veterans. They had all been in the service during World War II, and were attending Birmingham Southern after the war. As was the case with all returned veterans, they were eager to get into something that would be profitable to them and serve their hometown as well. When they learned that a frequency was available for the 1,000 watt station, they got up a few thousand dollars between them and the dream soon became a reality.\\" The original investors, who launched the station as the Marble City Broadcasting Co. Inc., were Curtis O. Liles Jr., Henry Judson Darden Jr., Edward J. Smith, and James S. Stowers Jr., with Paul H. Sarvis and Robert H. Arnold also stockholders. Liles, initially vice president and general manager, became majority owner and President in buying out later investor Richard L. Scroggins in September 1953. By 1956, the entire operation had consolidated in a new building on Motes Rd., and a companion WMLS-FM signed on the air in December 1959. Thereafter, Liles became sole owner. On September 1, 1980, the stations were purchased by Summit Broadcasting Inc. New owner Joseph V. Windsor, who had been a senior television group executive in Columbus, Ga., moved the WYEA call letters from a television station there to Sylacauga on November 30, 1981. On April 14, 1986, the FCC approved the transfer of WYEA-AM and WMLS-FM to Action Communications Enterprises Inc., a North Carolina-based radio group headed by David C. Phillips. That September, WMLS-FM changed its call letters to WAWV-FM, and, after 37 years in Sylacauga, the familiar WMLS call sign was adopted by a public FM station in Minnesota. On June 30, 1993, the FCC approved the transfer of WYEA-AM and WAWV-FM to W.O. Powers of South Carolina. On December 23, 1997, Spirit Broadcasting Co. Inc., owned by John H. Vogel, Robert D. Pierce, and Gary Mitchell, purchased WYEA- AM. Vogel, who joined the station under earlier ownership in 1983, became sole owner of the company on May 8, 2001. Powers sold WAWV-FM to Alabama Broadcasting Co. Inc., owner of WFEB-AM, then regained ownership on November 30, 1998. WAWV-FM was sold to Coosa Valley Broadcasting Inc. on July 1, 1999, and to Williams Communications Inc. on August 20, 2001. It became WTRB-FM in 2001, and, known as WTXO-FM since 2008, it moved some 30 miles away to Ashland, Ala.

On June 4, 2012, the Federal Communications Commission approved transfer of the station's licenses to Marble City Media LLC, and the transaction was completed on June 5, 2012. On November 25, 2013, the FCC granted a construction permit for a new FM translator on 106.3 MHz in Sylacauga.

Early history Aurora Cirk√°l√≥ was founded in Gy≈ër, Hungary by the young local punks ‚ÄúVigi‚Äù (guitar vocals), ‚ÄúGalacs‚Äù (bass), ‚ÄúPolyak‚Äù (drums) and ‚ÄúDauer‚Äù (vocals). This was in 1983, at the height of the Hungarian punk blast, a period in which a punk gig caused big agitation, occasionally by starting riots. ‚Äú We started criticizing the Soviet Army a little bit too early. It wasn‚Äôt really a surprise when the authorities sent us for a trial because of anticommunist lyrics. Our original singer ‚ÄúDauer‚Äù had to spend two years in prison because according to the authorities he had chosen the ‚Äúwrong words‚Äù, Vigi reminds of the old, ‚Äúromantic‚Äù days. Other punks didn‚Äôt have as much luck as Aurora: Two members of the Hungarian punk band CPg were found guilty and sent to prison for two years because of making jokes about communists. After having stayed in prison the members of CPg had to leave Hungary and so did the Aurora‚Äôs former singer ‚ÄúDauer‚Äù. Therefore, ‚ÄúAurora‚Äù needed a new vocalist and found it in the attractive blond female singer called ‚ÄúKriszta‚Äù, but she also left the band after a very short time. ‚ÄúShe was a very wild and fascinating person on stage, but she didn‚Äôt take her job as seriously as we did.‚Äù says Vigi ‚Äúso that finally I had to sing because we couldn‚Äôt find any suitable substitute for her. Since then we have playing as a trio. Some unreleased songs on the ‚ÄúBest Of‚Äù compilation are taken from this period like ‚ÄúKis Kurva‚Äù. Between 1984 and 1988 the band was playing under false names in order not to attract the attention of the ‚Äúold friends‚Äù, the Hungarian Secret Service. At this time the band caught the attention of some Austrian punks who invited ‚ÄúAurora‚Äù to play in Vienna. This was the first time the band played a concert outside Eastern Europe. ‚ÄúAurora‚Äù became a regular and famous guest in Vienna and went on their first big Germany-tour in 1988 with the help of some German friends. The money they made on tour was spent on recording their first self-titled EP in Germany. Under the assistance Hardly Heinlin and released on the German label ‚ÄúEmpty Records‚Äù. ‚ÄúAt this time it was nearly impossible to record in state- controlled studios in Hungary‚Äù, Vigi says, ‚ÄúOur debut EP may sound a little bit strong and brutal because we recorded it live in the studio, but we prefer this kind of full sound and we like it‚Äôs atmosphere, its feeling.‚Äù The EP wasn‚Äôt very successful in contrast to their first album, the legendary ‚ÄúViszl√°t Iv√°n‚Äù (Goodbye Ivan)-LP which was released in 1989. The release of this record coincided with the departure of the Soviet troops from Hungary after 40 years of occupation. On account of the uncompromising lyrics, the simple but well-crafted music and the perfect timing of the release of the record it became a huge success: more than 20.000 copies were sold, probably the best-selling release ever in Eastern Europe. ‚ÄúWe just couldn‚Äôt believe it‚Äù says Vigi, ‚Äú so many people came to our gigs. We felt like someone changed our rubber boots into ballet shoes.‚Äù ‚ÄúViszl√°t Iv√°n‚Äù was highly acclaimed in US- zines like the ‚ÄúMaximumrockandroll‚Äù, Suburban Voice‚Äù and ‚ÄúFlipside‚Äù. It was supposed to be licensed by a US label, but in the end the idea was not realised. After ‚ÄúGoodbye Ivan‚Äù there was a longer break. The following album, ‚ÄúEl≈ëre Kurv√°k, Gengszterek‚Äù (Forward Prostitutes, Gangsters) was released after three years of hard work and it ever surpassed the ‚ÄúGoodbye Ivan‚Äù-LP, especially because its fantastic producing and engineering. The ‚ÄúGangsters‚Äù ‚Äì CD was also released on ‚ÄúHulk R√§ckorz‚Äù, Germany. ‚ÄúMindhal√°lig Punk‚Äù (Punk Forever) was the title of the split CD with their German friends WIZO in 1994. In the mid 1990s ‚ÄúAurora‚Äù wanted to reach out a bigger audience by making some ‚Äúrock‚Äù records such as ‚ÄúFel T√°mad√°s‚Äù (Get Up Attack) and ‚ÄúKeser≈± Cukor‚Äù (Bitter Sugar). But in 1996 they decided to return to their original punk style. The new album ‚ÄúNincs Kar√°csony‚Äù (No X-mas) was nominated as ‚ÄúPunk album of the year‚Äù in Hungary. The hyper-melodicas well as strong songs reminded the listener of ‚ÄúAurora‚Äù best years. The highlight of the CD was the excellent trumpet-playing by the band‚Äôs new member ‚ÄúQka‚Äù which was even more spectacular on the 1997‚Äôs follow-up album ‚ÄúIlleg√°lis B√°l‚Äù (Illegal Party/Ball).

It was established on March 5, 1973, by Pope Paul VI for Cardinal-Deacon. The title was previously raised pro hac vice after Jos√© Tom√°s S√°nchez ‚Ä† was installed cardinal-priest in 2002, ten years after serving as cardinal-deacon. The title is now held by an American Cardinal, James Harvey. History The Title was established on March 5, 1973 by the late Pope Paul VI. Exterior The church was designed by Tullio Rossi in a somewhat modernized neo- Romanesque style, and completed in 1962. There is a nave with aisles, a semi- circular apse and a campanile at the end of the left-hand aisle. The fabric is in puce brick, with little decoration. The fa√ßade is two-storey, with the lower storey to aisle roof level being a simple rectangular form which encloses a smaller rectangle brought forward and containing the nave and aisle doorways. The nave door is inset, and above it is a mosaic by Giuseppe Stracota depicting Pope Pius V and St George with the Madonna and Child, and a background showing the Battle of Lepanto (at which the navy of the Ottoman Turks was defeated during his pontificate). The first story of the fa√ßade, and the body of the nave above the aisles, is divided into panels by relief pilasters in brick without capitals. On the fa√ßade there are six pilasters, ending in a wide blank stone architrave above which is the triangular pediment. In the centre is a vertical rectangular window formed of six squares divided by stone mullions, and below this are a coat of arms. The body of the nave has six windows of identical form on each side, in three pairs. The campanile is an unadorned brick tower on a square plan, with rectangular bell openings. Interior The interior has aisle arcades formed by square red marble pillars without capitals. The lower apse is panelled in the same red marble, and has an icon of Pope Pius V. The upper walls are in white with outline rectangular panels in gilt. There are some notable devotional artworks: the crucifix is by Francisco Nagni, the Stations of the Cross by Angelo Biancini, the statue of St Catherine of Siena by Antonio Berti and an angel in gesso by Duilio Cambellotti.

Anderson deputy Chief of Mission in Moscow in the late 1940s and then the US ambassador to South Vietnam from March 1957 to April 1961. He supported the Diem regime until late1960, when he reported that its control was slipping and that unless steps were taken to reform the government Diem would be likely overthrown in a coup, or lose the country to the Vietcong. Diem and his American supporters worked to get Durbrow transferred, and he was recalled by President John F. Kennedy in 1961, and sent to a diplomatic role with NATO in Europe. Early life Durbrow was born in San Francisco, California. Durbrow graduated from Yale University in 1926 with a degree in philosophy. He then continued his education at Stanford University, the University of Dijon in France, The Hague Academy of International Law in the Netherlands, the √âcole Libre des Sciences Politiques in Paris and finally the University of Chicago, where he studied international economics and finance. Career Durbrow began his career in the US Foreign Service by serving as Vice Consul at the American embassy in Poland. He rose through the service's ranks over the next decade and served in Bucharest, Naples, Rome, Lisbon, and Moscow. In 1941, Durbrow became the assistant chief of the US State Department's Eastern European affairs division. In 1944, Durbrow was appointed as the chief of the Eastern European division of the State Department in Washington, DC. That year, he was also one of the American delegates at the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference, which set up the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the Bretton Woods system of money management. After World War II, Durbrow was vocal in his opposition for the diplomatic recognition of new governments in Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria because of their communist origins. In 1946, he left that position to succeed George F. Kennan as the Counselor of Embassy and Deputy Chief of Mission in Moscow, under the US ambassador to the Soviet Union and future CIA Director, Walter Bedell Smith. Durbrow warned Smith and others of Soviet expansionism and efforts to break up the Western world. From 1948 to 1950, he served as an adviser to the National War College in Washington, DC, and spent the next two years as director of the Foreign Service's personnel division. In 1952, he was sent to Italy, where he served as deputy chief of mission to the US ambassador to Italy, Clare Boothe Luce. Two years later, he was promoted to the diplomatic rank of career minister. On March 14, 1957, US President Dwight Eisenhower named Durbrow as the United States Ambassador to South Vietnam. At the time, the US had a minor military and political presence in Vietnam to prevent communism from taking over the region. Durbrow had a difficult time in his ambassadorial role. He often had to work with the authoritarian regime of Ngo Dinh Diem and the corruption and ineffective policymaking that accompanied it. South Vietnamese officers, disgruntled with Diem's government, tried to persuade Durbrow into joining anti-Diem groups. Durbrow began to feel uneasy about Diem's authority, had to refuse because the US government was still supported Diem. In 1960, Diem and his younger brother and chief political adviser, Ngo Dinh Nhu, accused Durbrow of supporting a failed coup attempt by paratroopers of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. Durbrow later recalled receiving a phone call from one of Diem's aides, who asked him to tell Diem to surrender or face a howitzer attack on the presidential palace. Durbrow refused, and no attack occurred. He later learned that the aide had been forced to make the call.‚ÄúInterview with Eldridge Durbrow, 1979 (Part 1 of 3).‚Äù 02/01/1979. WGBH Media Library & Archives. Retrieved November 23, 2010. In April 1961, us President John F. Kennedy formed a committee to assess the political, military, and socioeconomic situation in Vietnam, in the hope of determining what it would take to keep Communism out of South Vietnam. On April 16, Kennedy replaced Durbrow with Frederick Nolting, who supported appeasement. Later, Durbrow served as a delegate to the NATO Council in Paris and later as a government adviser to the National War College and the Air University. Retirement Durbrow retired from his 38-year diplomatic career in 1968. He spent the next two decades writing and lecturing on foreign affairs. Throughout the 1970s, he served as the chairman of the American Foreign Policy Institute and as the director of the Center for International Strategic Studies and the Freedom Studies Center in South Boston, Virginia. Durbrow died at his home in Walnut Creek, California on May 16, 1997 from complications of a stroke. He was survived by his second wife, Benice Balcom Durbrow, and two sons from his first marriage, Chandler and Bruce.

History The Shiba clan descend from the Ashikaga Yasuuji and the Seiwa-Genji. Shiba Ieuji was the son of Shiba Yasuuji who established the clan name at the end of the 13th century. The Shiba were based in Mutsu Province, which occupied the north of Honsh≈´. The clan also inherited the governorship of Owari Province in present-day Aichi Prefecture. In the Kamakura period, the family was treated as a branch family of Ashikaga, which called themselves the Ashikaga family name, and it was not until the Muromachi period that Shiba was renamed as a family name. Shiba Takatsune (1305‚Äì1367) expanded the role of the clan when he sided with Ashikaga Takauji (1305‚Äì1358) in the skirmishes against the Emperor Go-Daigo in 1335. With the establishment of the Ashikaga shogunate Takauji awarded the office of shugo governor of Echizen and Wakasa provinces to Takatsune. Shiba Yoshimasa (1350‚Äì1410), son of Takatsune, held the office of kanrei from 1379 to 1397 during the Ashikaga shogunate.Nussbaum, Louis-Fr√©d√©ric. (2005). \\"Shiba Yoshimasa\\" in Japan Encyclopedia, p. 850. The office of kanrei was continued by his son Shiba Yoshishige (1371 - 1418) and grandson Shiba Yoshiatsu (1397 - 1434). The clan held influence and territory in the provinces of Echizen Province and Owari Province to which they were governors during the Sengoku period. The Shiba fell into factional dispute by the mid-15th century and were unable to make a transition to Sengoku-daimy≈ç and lost Echizen to the Asakura in the 1470s. The feud within the Shiba clan and with other clans was one cause of the ≈ånin War (1467‚Äì1477). The succession process was enacted by Asakura Toshikage, who took their power via usurpation. By the year 1550 the Shiba were represented by Shiba Yoshimune of Owari Province, a figurehead behind which the Iwakura branch of the Oda clan had ruled. His domain was Kiyosu Castle. Shiba Yoshikane (d. 1572) was the son of Shiba Yoshimune. When Yoshimune was killed in the year 1554 by Oda Nobutomo the clan effectively came to an end.

The present director of DIPR is Dr. K Ramachandran. History The history of DIPR dates back to 1943, when it was established in Dehradun as a small experimental board for the selection of Officers. After independence, with the reorganisation of the Armed Forces, there was a strong need for a dedicated research cell for the selection and follow-up of the officer cadre. Thus, in 1949, the experimental board was re-christened as the Psychological Research Wing (PRW), with the objective of evolving a scientific system for the selection of officers. With the emergence of new operational challenges in conventional warfare the scope of the institute's charter was further expanded. In 1962, Psychological Research Wing was re-designated as the Directorate of Psychological Research (DPR) to take on new areas of research related to morale, group effectiveness, leadership behaviour, PTSD and other problems related to Armed Forces.

Incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Spessard Holland decided to retire instead of seeking a fifth term. During the Democratic primary, former Governor C. Farris Bryant and State Senator Lawton Chiles advanced to a run- off, having received more votes than Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives Frederick H. Schultz, attorney Alcee Hastings, and State Representative Joel T. Daves, III. Chiles soundly defeated Bryant in the run- off election, scoring a major upset due to his comparatively small name recognition prior to the election. To acquire name recognition and media coverage, Chiles walked about across the state of Florida and was given the nickname \\"Walkin' Lawton\\". The Republican primary exposed an in-party feud between Governor Claude R. Kirk Jr. and U.S. Representative William C. Cramer. In the election, Cramer handily defeated G. Harrold Carswell and body shop owner George Balmer; the former was a Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals judge favored by Kirk and had been rejected as a Supreme Court of the United States nominee a few months prior to the primary. Chiles won the election by a relatively small margin of 7.8%, receiving 902,438 votes against Cramer's 772,817 votes.  Background  Incumbent Spessard Holland, who served in the Senate since 1946, decided to retire rather than seek a fifth term.

To generate some media coverage across the state, Chiles embarked upon a walk across Florida.Hathorn, p. 417 He would spend each night in a camper, which was driven by one of his aides.Coggin, p. 75 On March 17, Chiles began the walk starting in Century, a small town in Escambia County along the Alabama state line. He initially headed east along State Road 4, toward Tallahassee. Throughout the journey, a number of people walked a small portion of the distance, including State Senators Wilbur H.

Harrold Carswell, former Judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit *Bill Cramer, U.S. Representative  Campaign  In the fall of 1969, Cramer declared his candidacy for the Senate. President Nixon encouraged Cramer's candidacy in 1970: \\"Bill, the Senate needs you, the country needs you, the people need you‚Äìnow run.\\"Hathorn, p. 410 Sometime during the election, Cramer declined to run for re-election to his U.S. House seat. His former district assistant Charles William \\"Bill\\" Young of St. Petersburg, then the Florida Senate minority leader, ran for this seat. Young won and remained in the seat until his death in 2013.Hathorn, p. 413 In April 1970, the Senate rejected Judge G. Harrold Carswell of Tallahassee as Nixon's second consecutive conservative nominee to the United States Supreme Court. He had been newly appointed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, but his federal judicial service began under Dwight D. Eisenhower. Senators Gurney and Holland, both Carswell supporters, were dismayed by his rejection. Later that year, Carswell attributed his unsuccessful Supreme Court nomination to the \\"dark evil winds of liberalism\\" and the \\"northern press and its knee- jerking followers in the Senate.\\" Expecting to benefit over the uproar in Florida over the rejection of Judge Carswell, political aides suggested that Carswell resign from the bench and run for Holland's Senate seat. Carswell agreed and declared his candidacy while accompanying Governor Kirk in front of reporters in Miami on April 20\\\\. Initially, Lieutenant Governor Ray C. Osborne was challenging Cramer for the Republican nomination, but dropped out after Carswell entered the race. Years later, Kirk expressed regret for encouraging Carswell to run and Osborne to withdraw. It is possible that Cramer and Gurney came to an agreement in which Gurney would run for Senate in 1968 and allow Cramer to run in 1970. However, Carswell and Gurney denied having any knowledge of the deal.Hathorn, p. 411 Although Nixon encouraged Cramer to run, he would not voice support for either Carswell or Cramer during the primary contest. Carswell was endorsed by nationally known actors John Wayne and Gene Autry,Hathorn, p. 412 as well as Governor Kirk and Senator Gurney. In the primary campaign, Cramer stressed his amendment to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to prohibit forced busing to achieve racial balance in public schools. He raised questions about Carswell's concurrence in two Fifth Circuit busing edicts. At first, Carswell ignored Cramer's charges; then he spoke out against busing. A reporter from the Miami Herald compared Carswell's speeches to \\"legal opinions\\" aimed more at Senators Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Birch Bayh of Indiana, who had worked against his confirmation, than to Florida Republican primary voters. As a circuit judge, Carswell was bound by high court precedent, and after 1968, the federal courts had decreed busing as a tool to pursue racial balance in schools. Like Cramer, Kirk was identified with anti-busing forces. He had been unable, in 1970, to halt a desegregation plan in Manatee County.At a time of cultural change and social unrest, Cramer went beyond the busing issue in his speeches to attack \\"cop killers, bombers, burners, and racial revolutionaries who would destroy America.\\" In the Republican primary held on September 8, 1970, Cramer received 220,553 votes to Carswell's 121,281. A third candidate, businessman George Balmer, polled 10,974 votes.State of Florida, Primary election returns, September 8, 1970 Senate Republican Leader Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania, who opposed Carswell's confirmation to the Supreme Court, said that Carswell \\"was asking for it, and he got what he deserved.\\"Hathorn, p. 415 Cramer attributed his Senate nomination to his grassroots support and Carswell's lack of campaign experience. Carswell, however, argued that his support among Democrats would have been considerable had Florida been an open primary state, which both Alabama and Georgia conducted open primaries.Hathorn, p. 414  Results   General election   Major candidates  *Lawton Chiles (D), State Senator *Bill Cramer (R), U.S. Representative  Results   See also  * United States Senate elections, 1970  References   Footnotes   Bibliography  1970 Florida United States Senate ","title":"1970 United States Senate election in Florida"},{"id":"14368730","text":"Florio is an Italian surname.

Early activism  Hoc was an alumnus of Hanoi's Commercial School, and had been stripped of a scholarship because of his mediocre academic performance.Hammer (1955), p. 82.Duiker, p. 155. Hoc had previously tried to initiate peaceful reforms to French colonial ruleby making written submissions to authorities, but these were ignored, and his attempt to foster policy change through the publication of a magazine never materialized due to the refusal of a license.Luong (2010), p. 88. In 1925-26, a small group of young Hanoi-based intellectuals, started the Nam Dong Thu Xa (Southeast Asia Publishing House). They aimed to promote violent revolution as a means of gaining independence and published material about the Chinese Revolution of 1911. Hoc and a few other students and teachers led by Nguyen Thai Hoc. VNQDD formation  The Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang (VNQDD) was formed at a meeting in Hanoi on December 25, 1927, with Hoc as the party's first leader.Duiker, p. 156. It was Vietnam's first home-grown revolutionary party, established three years before the Indochinese Communist Party.Tucker, p. 442. In December 1928, Nguyen Khac Nhu replaced Hoc as chairman.Duiker, p. 157. VNQDD membership grew quickly, until a French crackdown in response to the assassination of labor recruiter. Hoc felt that assassinations were pointless because they would only prompt a crackdown by the French S√ªret√©, thereby weakening the party. He felt that it was better to strengthen the party until the time was ripe to overthrow the French, viewing Bazin as a 'mere twig on the tree of the colonial apparatus',Duiker, pp. 160‚Äì161. while other VNQDD leaders felt that killing Bazin was necessary so that the party would appear to be relevant to workers, given that the communists had begun to target this demographic for their recruitment drives.Luong (2010), p. 89. The French reacted by apprehending as many party members as possible; Hoc and Nhu were among the few senior leaders who escaped from a raid on their hideout at the Vietnam Hotel. After the crackdowns, Hoc argued for a change in strategy in favour of a general uprising, citing rising discontent among Vietnamese soldiers in the colonial army. More moderate party leaders believed this move to be premature, but Hoc's stature meant he prevailed in shifting the party's orientation towards violent struggle. One of the arguments presented for large-scale violence was that the French response to the Bazin assassination meant that the party's strength could decline in the long term.Marr (1981), pp. 377‚Äì378. The plan was to provoke a series of uprisings at military posts around the Red River Delta in early 1930, where VNQDD forces would join Vietnamese soldiers in an attack on the two major northern cities of Hanoi and Haiphong.Duiker, pp. 161‚Äì162.  Yen Bai mutiny  On November 24, 1929, in preparation for the attack, the VNQDD formed a provisional government in anticipation of ending French rule. Hoc was elected president.Luong (2010), p. 295. On December 25, 1929, the French authorities attempted to arrest the whole VNQDD leadership in a raid on a planning meeting at Vong La, having being tipped off by Military Affairs Minister Pham Thanh Duong. The VNQDD leaders narrowly escaped, learning of Duong's role in the process,Luong (2010), p. 34. before assembling in the village in Son Duong to continue preparations.Luong (2010), p. 90. As the French knew an uprising was imminent, they began disrupting preparations, while the VNQDD tried to move as quickly as possible. On January 28, 1930, a final planning meeting was held in the village of Vong La in Ph√∫ Th·ªç Province. H·ªçc declared that the situation was reaching desperation, and asserted that if the party did not act soon, they would be scattered by French police. H·ªçc built up enthusiasm for the revolt, and those who were reluctant to carry through were coerced into complying. The uprising was set for the night of February 9 and the small hours of the following day. Hoc was to command forces in the lower Red River Delta near the city of Haiphong.Duiker, p. 162. The uprisings were supposed to be simultaneous, but H·ªçc sent a last-minute order to Nhu to postpone action until February 15. The messenger was arrested by the French and Nhu was unaware of the change in schedule, so the attacks started on the original day, while H·ªçc waited until February 15,Duiker, pp. 162-163. by which time most of the attacks had already been suppressed.Luong, pp. 28-31. On the night of February 15-16, the nearby villages of Phu Duc in Th√°i B√¨nh Province and Vƒ©nh B·∫£o in H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng Province were seized for a few hours by H·ªçc and his remaining forces.Luong, p. 30. In the first case, the VNQDD fighters disguised themselves as colonial troops and managed to trick their opponents, before seizing the military post in the town. In the process, they wounded three guards and disarmed the post.Luong, p. 31. In the second village, the local mandarin representing the French colonial government was murdered.Rettig, p. 311. After being driven out, the VNQDƒê fled to the village of Co Am. On February 16, French warplanes responded by bombarding the settlement. Five wooden Potez 35 biplanes dropped 60 10 kg bombs on the village and raked machine-gun fire indiscriminately, killing 200, mostly civilians.Currey, p. 22. The insurrection was officially declared over on February 22, after Hoc and his lieutenants, Pho Duc Chinh and Nguyen Thanh Loi, were apprehended while trying to flee into China. At his trial, Hoc described himself as a professional revolutionary and took responsibility for the entire campaign. He identified himself as the VNQDD leader and then gave a political speech about the VNQDD's objectives and why non-violent lobbying was ineffective, before being cut off by the presiding judge.Luong (2010), p. 102. Hoc mixed anti- colonial rhetoric based on anecdotes of prior anti-Chinese and anti-French warriors, with French history and political thought regarding civil rights, which according to Luong, showed the influence of French education on the political base of the VNQDD.Luong (2010), p. 103. Luong cited Hoc's use of terms such as equality and liberty repeatedly. Hoc was among 39 sentenced to death,Rettig, p. 316. and tried to appeal his death sentence to the Council of the Protectorate, and after this failed, sought clemency.Luong (2010), p. 104. Presidential pardons were granted to most of those condemned to death,Luong (2010), p. 299. but not those who had killed a French officer, warrant officer, or a native soldier. Hoc was denied clemency and was among the 13 who were guillotined on June 17, 1930. The condemned men cried \\"Viet Nam!\\" as they were to be executed.Hammer, p. 84. Hoc's fianc√©e committed suicide later on the same day.Luong (2010), p. 112. Hoc made a last plea to the French in the form of a letter. In it, he claimed that he had always wanted to cooperate with the authorities, but that French intransigence had forced him to revolt. He contended that if France wanted to stay in Indochina, then it would have to drop policies that he termed as brutal, and become more amiable towards Vietnamese people. He called for the introduction of universal education, training in commerce and industry and an end to the corruption of the French- installed mandarins.Duiker, p. 164.

The station is owned by Williams Communications, Inc. It broadcasts a Gospel music format and features news programming from Fox News Radio. History WHMA began broadcasting in Anniston on November 3, 1938. Operating on 1420 kHz (kilocycles or kc) with a daytime-only power of 100 Watts, it was owned by the Anniston Broadcasting Company. The call letters were for Harry M. Ayers, president of the owning company and publisher of The Anniston Star.Butler, Harry D.; Alabama's First Radio Stations 1920-1960: A History of Radio Broadcasting in Alabama; Alabama Broadcasters Association, 2006 In about 1940, the FCC granted permission to operate at 1450 kHz with 250 W day and night. WHMA-FM, 100.5 MHz class C 100 kW, was added in 1947. In 1955, WHMA purchased WSPC, their primary competitor in Anniston, and took over this station's operation at 1390 kHz, 5 kW-D, 1-kW DA-N. The call letters WSPC were first used by a police radio station in Michigan. An agreement was reached to have the letters transferred to the new broadcast station being built in Anniston and owned by Stanton Ingram and Elbert Boozer. WSPC opened in July 1949. These call letters were abandoned after the WHMA purchase. In March 1984, Anniston Broadcasting Company reached an agreement to sell WHMA to Calhoun Broadcasting Co., Inc. The deal was approved by the FCC on April 26, 1984, and the transaction was consummated on October 5, 1984. In February 1988, Calhoun Broadcasting Co., Inc., reached an agreement to sell this station to Anniston Radio, Inc. The deal was approved by the FCC on May 18, 1988, and the transaction was consummated on July 11, 1988. In June 1988, control of Anniston Radio passed from Paul C. Stone to Charles A. Giddens. This transfer of control was approved by the FCC on July 14, 1988. In September 1989, Anniston Radio Inc. reached an agreement to sell this station to Emerald Broadcasting of the South Inc. The deal was approved by the FCC on October 19, 1989, and the transaction was consummated on January 3, 1990. In January 1991, Emerald Broadcasting of the South Inc. merged with Sapphire Broadcasting, Inc. In October 1992, an agreement was reached to transfer control of Sapphire Broadcasting, Inc., from Thomas P. Gannon to Bridge Capital Investors II. This transfer was approved by the FCC on December 8, 1993, and the transaction was consummated on June 1, 1994. On November 6, 1996, Sapphire Broadcasting, Inc., reached an agreement to sell this station and sister station WHMA-FM (which is now WNNX in College Park, Georgia) to Susquehanna Radio Corporation subsidiary WNNX License Investment Company for $15.05 million. The deal was approved by the FCC on January 27, 1997, and the transaction was consummated on May 22, 1997. In November 1997, WNNX License Investment Company reached an agreement to transfer the broadcast license for WHMA to WNNX LiCo, Inc. The transfer was approved by the FCC on December 10, 1997, and the transaction was consummated the same day. On April 1, 2002, Susquehanna Radio Corporation (through subsidiary license holder WNNX LiCo, Inc.) reached an agreement to sell this station to Casey Network LLC (a division of Jarrell Communications) for $150,000. The deal was approved by the FCC on May 23, 2002, and the transaction was consummated on June 29, 2002. In May 2003, Casey Network LLC (Jimmy Jarrell, president/CEO) reached an agreement to sell this station to Williams Communications Inc. (Walton E. Williams Jr., president) for a reported sale price of $275,500. The deal was approved by the FCC on August 12, 2003, and the transaction was consummated on October 9, 2003. At the time of the sale, WHMA aired a news/talk format. Jarrell cited a desire to focus on country music stations as his primary reason for selling WHMA.

On August 6, 2018, WDNG changed its format and become a sister station of WFHK, under the new name of MY 95 FM. As signification of the format change, the station played the Lynyrd Skynyrd songs \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\" and \\"Free Bird\\" on repeat for 3 days prior to the switch. WFHK announced the station's format change via Facebook on August 4, 2018, stating that it will have a music format and stay focused on the Calhoun County, Alabama area and its surrounding areas. The station's call letters will remain the same, but will now be owned by Stocks Broadcasting, Inc. History The station first made a mark in the Anniston market playing Top 40 music with a huge local news focus after playing adult standards for about eight years. WDNG once boasted a staff of 17 full-time employees and several part-timers, a large number for a market as small as Anniston. Advertising revenue was off the charts for years, providing a stable income to support the staff and grow the station. In late 1968 WDNG left rented space in the old First National Bank of Anniston building on Noble Street and moved to what was named \\"The Beautiful Broadcasting Central Building\\" at 1115 Leighton Avenue. The facility was a state-of-the-art operation for the time. Top forty music was phased out and the station became a full service adult contemporary outlet around 1980, moving to the CBS Radio Network for news, sports and many features. University of Alabama football and Walter Wellborn High School football broadcasts continued after the switch and sports programming was ramped up using CBS feeds for events such as Major League Baseball. WDNG slowly shifted to a news/talk format starting around 1983 into the early 1990s. Its first morning local talk show featured fiery host Ed Benedict in 1985. In time WDNG moved away from music and to all talk and news. This move was made easier by the station's long-time commitment to local news coverage, having once operated a two-person local news department covering Calhoun and North Talladega Counties. WDNG News was in operation as far back as 1959 under former station owner Tom Potts, Sr. It was the only Anniston radio station to offer same-day coverage of the May 14, 1961 Freedom Riders bus burning, which is considered one of the landmark events of the civil rights era. Two station employees were at the scene of the bus burning, taking notes. They were called in as witnesses by the U.S. District Attorney. On March 22, 2009, FBI files were released under a Freedom of Information Act request made by The Anniston Star that included several references to WDNG's coverage of the civil rights movement. In one telegram from the Anniston FBI field office, station assistant general manager Bobby Price is referred to by name as having reported in a newscast facts surrounding the Willie Brewster murder case. The telegram was sent to the Washington office and was directed to J. Edgar Hoover, the FBI chief at the time. WDNG was at the forefront of coverage of the Brewster slaying. The black man was shot down in July 1965 while driving home from work at an Anniston pipe shop. A white man was convicted in the murder in December 1965 by an all-white, all-male jury. WDNG news provided national radio coverage of the trial for several news organizations (UPI and Mutal Radio News) under the leadership of station News Director Dave Fitz. So strong was WDNG's coverage of the civil rights movement that the station's transmitter building was bombed in the early 1960s. The case was never solved, but it was thought to be an act of violence aimed at the station for its news coverage of various stories dealing with the civil rights movement in Anniston. Throughout the history of WDNG Radio's news department, it won numerous state and regional awards for coverage of local news events. The station's coverage of the Audrey Marie Hilley murder case in the 1980s also brought it attention. Hilley was an Anniston secretary who was convicted of using poison to kill her husband and attempting to do the same to her daughter. Her flight from justice spawned two true crime novels and a television movie made for a network. WDNG broke the news of many of the Hilley case's elements and provided award-winning coverage of the case that played out over close to a decade. Two different WDNG News Directors, Mike Stedham and later Chris Pope, gave the region countless up-to-the-minute details as thousands stayed in touch with the case. Stedham is mentioned in one of the novels about the case as breaking the news on WDNG about Hilley's recapture in a small Vermont city. 21st century In September 2012, the station went silent for technical reasons for nearly one month. It was later discovered that the station's co-owner, J.J. Dark, was delinquent on tax payments. WDNG went back on the air in October 2012 after a transfer of full ownership to co- owner Charles Fuller. Beginning in 2013, under the leadership of Charles's daughter, Charlene Fuller-Gossett, the station established a news department that focused on Anniston government and crime. During winter storms in early 2014, WDNG was the only radio station in Calhoun County, Alabama that interrupted regular programming and provided updated weather and road information every hour. Primary and general elections were heavily covered by the news department that year, and special reports from the Calhoun County Sheriff's Office were broadcast during ballot counts. Between July 2015 and July 2016, WDNG provided a live simulcast of every formal meeting of the Anniston City Council. In April 2016 the station purchased an unbuilt translator in the Talladega area and was permitted to move it to Anniston to rebroadcast the station. That facility came on the air in early December, 2016.

The ability to spontaneously use tools, such as brushing one's hair in the morning without being instructed to do so, may remain intact, but is often lost. The general concept of apraxia and the classification of ideomotor apraxia were developed in Germany in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by the work of Hugo Liepmann, Adolph Kussmaul, Arnold Pick, Paul Flechsig, Hermann Munk, Carl Nothnagel, Theodor Meynert, and linguist Heymann Steinthal, among others. Ideomotor apraxia was classified as \\"ideo-kinetic apraxia\\" by Liepmann due to the apparent dissociation of the idea of the action with its execution. The classifications of the various subtypes are not well defined at present, however, owing to issues of diagnosis and pathophysiology. Ideomotor apraxia is hypothesized to result from a disruption of the system that relates stored tool use and gesture information with the state of the body to produce the proper motor output. This system is thought to be related to the areas of the brain most often seen to be damaged when ideomotor apraxia is present: the left parietal lobe and the premotor cortex. Little can be done at present to reverse the motor deficit seen in ideomotor apraxia, although the extent of dysfunction it induces is not entirely clear. Signs and Symptoms Ideomotor apraxia (IMA) impinges on one's ability to carry out common, familiar actions on command, such as waving goodbye. Persons with IMA exhibit a loss of ability to carry out motor movements, and may show errors in how they hold and move the tool in attempting the correct function. One of the defining symptoms of ideomotor apraxia is the inability to pantomime tool use. As an example, if a normal individual were handed a comb and instructed to pretend to brush his hair, he would grasp the comb properly and pass it through his hair. If this were repeated in a patient with ideomotor apraxia, the patient may move the comb in big circles around his head, hold it upside-down, or perhaps try and brush his teeth with it. The error may also be temporal in nature, such as brushing exceedingly slowly. The other characteristic symptom of ideomotor apraxia is the inability to imitate hand gestures, meaningless or meaningful, on request; a meaningless hand gesture is something like having someone make a ninety- degree angle with his thumb and placing it under his nose, with his hand in the plane of his face. This gesture has no meaning attached to it. In contrast, a meaningful gesture is something like saluting or waving goodbye. An important distinction here is that all of the above refer to actions that are consciously and voluntarily initiated. That is to say that a person is specifically asked to either imitate what someone else is doing or is given verbal instructions, such as \\"wave goodbye.\\" People suffering from ideomotor apraxia will know what they are supposed to do, e.g. they will know to wave goodbye and what their arm and hand should do to accomplish it, but will be unable to execute the motion correctly. This voluntary type of action is distinct from spontaneous actions. Ideomotor apraxia patients may still retain the ability to perform spontaneous motions; if someone they know leaves the room, for instance, they may be able to wave goodbye to that person, despite being unable to do so at request. The ability to perform this sort of spontaneous action is not always retained, however; some sufferers lose this capability, as well. The recognition of meaningful gestures, e.g. understanding what waving goodbye means when it is seen, seems to be unaffected by ideomotor apraxia. It has also been shown that ideomotor apraxia sufferers may have some deficits in general spontaneous movements. Apraxia patients appear to be unable to tap their fingers as quickly as a control group, with a lower maximum tapping rate correlated with more severe apraxia. It has also been demonstrated that apraxic patients are slower to point at a target light when they do not have sight of their hand as compared with healthy patients under the same conditions. The two groups did not differ when they could see their hands. The speed and accuracy of grasping objects also appears unaffected by ideomotor apraxia. Patients suffering from ideomotor apraxia appear to be much more reliant on visual input when conducting movements then nonapraxic individuals. Cause The most common cause of ideomotor apraxia is a unilateral ischemic lesion to the brain, which is damage to one hemisphere of the brain due to a disruption of the blood supply, as in a stroke. There are a variety of brain areas where lesions have been correlated to ideomotor apraxia. Initially it was believed that damage to the subcortical white matter tracts, the axons that extend down from the cells bodies in the cerebral cortex, was the main area responsible for this form of apraxia. Lesions to the basal ganglia may also be responsible, although there is considerable debate as to whether damage to the basal ganglia alone would be sufficient to induce apraxia. Lesions to these lower brain structures has not, however, been shown to be more prevalent in apraxic patients. In fact, these types of lesions are more common in nonapraxic patients. The lesions most associated with ideomotor apraxia are to the left parietal and premotor areas. Patients with lesions to the supplementary motor area have also presented with ideomotor apraxia. Lesions to the corpus callosum can also induce apraxic-like symptoms, with varying effects on the two hands, although this has not been thoroughly studied. In addition to ischemic lesions to the brain, ideomotor apraxia has also been seen in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, corticobasal degeneration, and progressive supranuclear palsy. Pathophysiology The prevailing hypothesis for the pathophysiology of ideomotor apraxia is that the various brain lesions associated with the disorder somehow disrupt portions of the praxis system. The praxis system is the brain regions that are involved in taking processed sensory input, accessing of stored information about tools and gestures, and translating these into a motor output. Buxbaum et al. have proposed that the praxis system involves three distinct parts: stored gesture representations, stored tool knowledge, and a \\"dynamic body schema.\\" The first two store information about the representation of gestures in the brain and the characteristic movements of tools. The body schema is a brain model of the body and its position in space. The praxis system relates the stored information about a movement type to how the dynamic, i.e. changing, body representation varies as the movement progresses. It is still not clear how this system maps out onto the brain itself, although some research has given indications to possible locations for certain portions. The dynamic body schema has been suggested to be localized in the superior posterior parietal cortex. There is also evidence that the inferior parietal lobule may be the locus for storage of the characteristic movements of a tool. This area showed inverse activation to the cerebellum in a study of tool use and tool mime. If the connections between these areas become severed, the praxis system would be disrupted, possibly resulting in the symptoms observed in ideomotor apraxia. Diagnosis There is no one definitive test for ideomotor apraxia; there are several that are used clinically to make an ideomotor apraxia diagnosis. The criteria for a diagnosis are not entirely conserved among clinicians, for apraxia in general or distinguishing subtypes. Almost all the tests laid out here that enable a diagnosis of ideomotor apraxia share a common feature: assessment of the ability to imitate gestures. A test developed by Georg Goldenberg uses imitation assessment of 10 gestures. The tester demonstrates the gesture to the patient and rates him on how whether the gesture was correctly imitated. If the first attempt to imitate the gesture was unsuccessful, the gesture is presented a second time; a higher score is given for correct imitation on the first trial, then for the second, and the lowest score is for not correctly imitating the gesture. The gestures used here are all meaningless, such as placing the hand flat on the top of the head or flat outward with the fingers towards the ear. This test is specifically designed for ideomotor apraxia. The main variation from this is in the type and number of gestures used. One test uses twenty-four movements with three trials for each and a trial-based scoring system similar to the Goldenberg protocol. The gestures here are also copied by the patient from the tester and are divided into finger movements, e.g. making a scissor movement with the forefinger and middle finger, and hand and arm movements, e.g. doing a salute. This protocol combines meaningful and meaningless gestures. Another test uses five meaningful gestures, such as waving goodbye or scratching your head and five meaningless gestures. Additional differences in this test are a verbal command to initiate the movement and it distinguishes between accurate performance and inaccurate but recognizable performance. One test utilizes tools, including a hammer and a key, with both a verbal command to use the tools and the patient copying the tester's demonstrated use of the tools. These tests have been shown to be individually unreliable, with considerable variability between the diagnoses delivered by each. If a battery of tests is used, however, the reliability and validity may be improved. It is also highly advisable to include assessments of how the patient performs activities in daily life. One of the newer tests that has been developed may provide greater reliability without relying on a multitude of tests. It combines three types of tool use with imitation of gestures. The tool use section includes having the patient pantomime use with no tool present, with visual contact with the tool, and finally with tactile contact with the tool. This test screens for ideational and ideomotor apraxia, with the second portion aimed specifically at ideomotor apraxia. One study showed great potential for this test, but further studies are needed to reproduce these results before this can be said with confidence. This disorder often occurs with other degenerative neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. These comorbidities can make it difficult to pick out the specific features of ideomotor apraxia. The important point in distinguishing ideomotor apraxia is that basic motor control is intact; it is a high level dysfunction involving tool use and gesturing. Additionally, clinicians must be careful to exclude aphasia as a possible diagnosis, as, in the tests involving verbal command, an aphasic patient could fail to perform a task properly because they do not understand what the directions are. Management Given the complexity of the medical problems facing ideomotor apraxia patients, as they are usually suffering from a multitude of other problems, it is difficult to ascertain the impact that it has on their ability to function independently. Deficits due to Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease could very well be sufficient to mask or make irrelevant difficulties arising from the apraxia. Some studies have shown ideomotor apraxia to independently diminish the patient's ability to function on their own. The general consensus seems to be that ideomotor apraxia does have a negative impact on independence in that it can reduce an individual's ability to manipulate objects, as well as diminishing the capacity for mechanical problem solving, owing to the inability to access information about how familiar parts of the unfamiliar system function. A small subset of patients has been known to spontaneously recover from apraxia; this is rare, however. One possible hope is the phenomenon of hemispheric shift, where functions normally performed by one hemisphere can shift to the other in the event that the first is damaged. This seems to necessitate, however, that some portion of the function is associated with the other hemisphere to begin with. There is dispute over whether the right hemisphere of the cortex is involved at all in the praxis system, as some evidence from patients with severed corpus callosums indicates it may not be. Although there is little that can be done to substantially reverse the effects of ideomotor apraxia, Occupational Therapy can be effective in helping patients regain some functional control. Sharing the same approach in treating ideational apraxia, this is achieved by breaking a daily task (e.g. combing hair) into separate components and teaching each distinct component individually.Unsworth, C.A. (2007). Cognitive and Perceptual Dysfunction. In S. B. O'sullivan, & T. J. Schmitz (Eds.), Physical Rehabilitation (5th Ed.) (p.1182). Philadelphia: F.A. Davis Company.

She was recaptured in January 1864 by Confederate forces, again became a blockade runner, and ultimately was abandoned as a wreck after running aground.  Confederate blockade runner Granite City captured, refitted as Union gunboat  Granite City was originally a Confederate blockade runner, and was captured in the Bahama Islands 22 March 1863 by . She was bought by the United States from the New York City prize court for $55,000 and delivered to the Navy at New York City 16 April 1863, Acting Master Charles W. Lamson in command.  Assigned to the Western Gulf Blockade  Assigned to the Western Gulf Blockading Squadron, Granite City arrived in New Orleans, Louisiana, for duty 27 August 1863.  Participating in the ill-fated Sabine Pass expedition  She was detained for a time in quarantine because of sickness on board, but departed 4 September to take part in the ill-fated Sabine Pass Expedition, which was intended to provide a Union lodgment in Texas and prevent possible French moves into that State from Mexico.  Expedition fails and Granite City escapes the Confederate guns  Granite City was ideally suited to help support the troop landings because her shallow draft allowed her to cross the bar and lie close to shore. She crossed the bar in company with , , and during the Second Battle of Sabine Pass on 8 September 1863, with her upper deck carrying several hundred Union Army infantrymen. When withering fire of Confederate batteries forced the surrender of Sachem and Clifton, and the Arizona now receiving undivided attention of the fort's artillery, Granite City backed out of the Pass and returned to invasion fleet of 18 other warships waiting offshore. Sachem and Clifton were disabled and captured in the action, though Granite City suffered no battle damage and none of the Union soldiers aboard were lost.  Patrolling the Texas coast  For the next 8 months, Granite City, though often in need of repairs to her weak machinery, actively participated in the blockade of the Texas coast. She captured schooner Anita 27 October 1863, schooner Amelia Ann 16 November, and bark Teresita 17 November. In addition, the steamer supported two landings of troops on the Texas coast. With , she shelled Confederate cavalry off Pass Cavallo 31 December 1863, allowing Union reconnaissance forces to land successfully. Again on 19 January 1864, the two ships covered the landing of several hundred troops near Smith Point, Texas, and defended them by shelling shore positions.  Under attack, recaptured by Confederates  After 3 more months of grueling blockade duty, Granite City was dispatched with steamer to Calcasieu Pass, Louisiana, to receive refugees. While thus engaged on 28 April 1864, the two ships came under attack by Confederate troops and shore batteries. After an hour's sharp engagement, both ships surrendered, placing Granite City back into Confederate custody.  Granite City reverted to Confederate blockade runner, runs aground, breaks up  Fitted out as a Confederate blockade runner, her original occupation, Granite City was loaded at Galveston, Texas, and ran out of Velasco, Texas, 20 January 1865.

His death brought general mourning in Britain and a monument to his memory was raised in St Paul's Cathedral. During his long career, Hoghton had fought on several West Indian islands, in India, Denmark, Portugal and Spain and had even spent a brief period standing in for a Royal Marines detachment in the Channel Fleet. A popular and able officer, Wellington was reported to have commented on his death: \\"I understand that it was impossible for anybody to behave better than he did . . . he,actually fell waving his hat and cheering his brigade on to the charge\\"Hoghton, Daniel, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, E. M. Lloyd, Retrieved 26 November 2007 French Revolutionary Wars Hoghton was born in Castle Hedingham in Essex as second son to Sir Henry Hoghton, 6th Baronet and his second wife Fanny in 1770. He was educated at St John's College, Cambridge. Raised in political circles as the son of an MP, Daniel instead chose a military career and at 23 joined the 82nd Regiment of Foot as a captain through purchase at the outbreak of the French Revolutionary War in 1793. It took some time for Hoghton to settle, moving in 1794 to the short-lived 97th Regiment of Foot and in 1795 on their disbandment joining the 67th Regiment of Foot. Whilst with the 97th, Hoghton and his troops spent some months with the Channel Fleet as makeshift marines after manning shortages necessitated the posting. His father died the same year and the titles, estates and political offices passed to his elder brother Henry Philip Hoghton. The 67th Regiment was dispatched to the West Indies in 1796 to take part in several campaigns, including serving in San Domingo during the Haitian Revolution and spending time stationed in Jamaica. The same year Hoghton was promoted to lieutenant colonel. In January 1799 Hoghton was transferred to the 88th Regiment of Foot, also known as the Connaught Rangers who were stationed in India. Hoghton took passage and met his regiment in Bombay. For unknown reasons Hoghton did not accompany his men to Egypt for the final defeat of the French army stationed there in 1801 and instead spent some years on the staff of Lord Mornington, returning to England with dispatches in 1804. Napoleonic Wars Following his arrival in England during November 1804, Hoghton was given command of the newly raised 2nd battalion, 8th Regiment of Foot, gaining promotion to full colonel the following year. After training and preparing the regiment, Hoghton was dispatched with his troops to Denmark for participation in the Siege of Copenhagen under Sir Arthur Wellesley, whose brother Hoghton had known in India. Hoghton was not heavily engaged at Copenhagen and was soon transferred to the West Indies once more, participating in the invasion and capture of Martinique in 1809. It was for this reason that Hoghton did not join Wellesley in the Iberian Peninsula until 1810, taking command of a brigade in Cadiz. On 25 July 1810, Hoghton made the jump to major-general and in September took command of the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division under Sir William Stewart, a man he had served under during the 1790s. Hoghton's first taste of action during the Peninsula War was at the Battle of Albuera, where Stewart's division was hastily deployed after a Spanish withdrawal on the right of the battleline. The rapid nature of the deployment opened the division to attack by French cavalry and the 1st brigade under Colonel John Colborne was almost destroyed. Hoghton's brigade held firm however and drove off the French cavalry and then withstood an attack by the 11,000 men of the French 5th Corps, three-quarters of the brigade falling dead or wounded during the furious battle. As the attack subsided, Hoghton removed his hat to motion his men forward and as he did so was struck by a musket ball and killed instantly. Despite Hoghton's death, the brigade remained strong and withdrew from the field in good order, the action failing to produce a clear victor. Alone amongst the hundreds of men who fell from his division, Hoghton's body was retrieved in the immediate aftermath and carried to Elvas, where it was buried in the British Cemetery Elvas which is now a memorial to the 60,000 officers and men of the British and Portuguese armies who died alongside their Spanish allies in the cause of freedom and independence in the Peninsular War of 1808-1814. In Britain his death was treated with sorrow and a government motion paid for a monument to his memory to be raised in St Paul's Cathedral.

Denise becomes convinced that what is happening to her is supernatural in nature. Thinking that she was supposed to die in the air crash, Denise speculates that the specter of death is making people who have recently died come back to life and stalk her before finding an opportunity to kill her to finish what the chain of events that began with the plane crash started. One rainy evening, when a man, a highway inspector who just died, breaks into Denise's house, he happens to find Kristy instead, whom he kills by drowning. Denise walks in and barely escapes and calls the police who take her in for questioning only to find the man that Denise identified as attacking her was found dead a short distance away and who had been dead for several hours.

Brian arrives with a gun to attempt to stop them or help Denise, but he too ends up getting stabbed and killed by the undead Kristy. Denise manages to escape from her house and drives through the nearby city which is deserted, but the car breaks down and she finds herself alone on the streets... aware that somewhere in a hospital or a morgue or a back alley that there is a person who has just died and will become a reanimated corpse for the sole purpose of killing her. The scared Denise manages to board a passing, late-night bus and arrives at Carla's house with Brian's gun where she confides in Carla about what is going on and asks for help. But Carla, who has not spoken a word since Denise arrived at her house, takes the gun, revealing herself to be an undead cadaver having committed suicide minutes earlier by slashing her wrists in a bathtub, and shoots Denise dead before going back to the bathtub. The final scene has Artie at the morgue with the bodies of Denise, Brian, Carla, Kristy, and the taxi driver. Artie continues to be puzzled at how the blood in the bodies of the last three corpses drained into their legs. After talking to a skeptical police detective over the phone about the uncanny irregularities, Artie begins to finally suspect something strange is going on. In the final shot, as Artie begins to type out a report to document this, one of the bodies sits up on its gurney behind him. He turns his head as he somehow senses this, and then the screen goes black.

He has written several books and coauthored Dow 36,000, published in 1999, which argued that the stock market was about to have a massive swing upward. Shortly thereafter, the dot-com bubble burst, causing a massive decline in stock market prices. Hassett has worked at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. He was John McCain's chief economic adviser in the 2000 presidential primaries, as well as economic adviser to the 2004 campaign of George W. Bush and 2008 campaign of McCain. He was an economic adviser on Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign. In the Trump administration, Hassett was the 29th Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers from September 2017 to June 2019. He returned to the White House in 2020 to work on the administration's response to the coronavirus pandemic. Hassett, despite lacking experience in the field of public health policy, influenced the administration's response by downplaying the danger of coronavirus and pushing the administration to re- open the economy amid lockdowns and social distancing. Early life and education Hassett is a native of Greenfield, Massachusetts, where he graduated from Greenfield High School. He received a B.A. in economics from Swarthmore College and a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Pennsylvania under supervision of Alan J. Auerbach. Career Hassett was an assistant professor of economics at Columbia Business School from 1989 to 1993 and an associate professor there from 1993 to 1994. From 1992 to 1997, Hassett was an economist in the Division of Research and Statistics at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. He served as a policy consultant to the United States Treasury Department during the George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton administrations.Kevin Hassett curriculum vitae on AEI website.  American Enterprise Institute  Hassett joined AEI as a resident scholar in 1997. He worked on tax policy, fiscal policy, energy issues, and investing in the stock market. He collaborated with R. Glenn Hubbard on work on the budget surplus, income inequality, and tax reform. Hassett published papers and articles on capital taxation, the consistency of tax policy, returns on energy conservation investments, corporate taxation, telecommunications competition, the effects of taxation on wages, dividend taxation, and carbon taxes. In 2003, Hassett was named director of economic policy studies at AEI. Hassett wrote columns in newspapers like The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Wall Street Journal. He writes a monthly column for National Review and, since 2005, a weekly column for Bloomberg. In 2007, Hassett argued that the United States was on the wrong side of the Laffer curve in terms of corporate tax rates. Economists and commentators characterized a graph that he used to support his argument as deceptive.  Dow 36,000  Hassett is coauthor with James K. Glassman of Dow 36,000: The New Strategy for Profiting from the Coming Rise in the Stock Market. It was published in 1999 before the dot-com bubble burst. The book's title was based on a calculation that, in the absence of the equity premium, stock prices would be approximately four times as high as they actually were. In its introduction, Glassman and Hassett wrote that the book \\"will convince you of the single most important fact about stocks at the dawn of the twenty-first century: They are cheap... If you are worried about missing the market's big move upward, you will discover that it is not too late. Stocks are now in the midst of a one-time-only rise to much higher ground‚Äìto the neighborhood of 36,000 on the Dow Jones industrial average.\\" The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 10,273.00 on the day of the book's publication on October 1, 1999, peaked at 11,722.98 105 days later, then declined 37.8% through October 9, 2002. Paul Krugman argued on his faculty website that the book contained basic arithmetic errors and was \\"a very silly book\\" but regarded Hassett's role as co-author as a \\"youthful indiscretion.\\" Statistician and blogger Nate Silver described the book as \\"charlatanic\\" and suggested on empirical grounds that the authors had failed to notice that at the time of writing stock prices were \\"as overvalued as at literally any time in American history\\".  Views on immigration  According to The New York Times, Hassett's nomination by Trump to lead the Council of Economic Advisers was met with opposition by some anti-immigration groups such as Breitbart News, American Renaissance, InfoWars, the Center for Immigration Studies and \\"leaders of the white nationalist 'alt-right' movement\\". Hassett‚Äî\\"like most economists ... believes that immigration spurs economic growth\\". Prior to Hassett's nomination, President Trump \\"broke with recent tradition and removed the council's chairman from a cabinet-level position\\".  Chair of White House Council of Economic Advisors  On September 5, 2018, Hassett released new analysis indicating that real wage growth under Trump was higher than reported, despite figures indicating that wage growth had not picked up. On September 13, 2018, on an official visit to Ireland, when questioned if the U.S. considered Ireland as a tax haven, said that: \\"It's not Ireland's fault US tax law was written by someone on acid\\". Hassett had labeled Ireland as a tax haven on several interviews in August‚ÄìDecember 2017, when advocating for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\\"TCJA\\"). In July 2018, Seamus Coffey, Chairperson of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and author of the Irish State's 2016 review of the Irish corporate tax code posted that Ireland could now see a \\"boom\\" in the onshoring of U.S. intellectual property, via the Irish Capital Allowances for Intangible Assets (CAIA) BEPS tool which is enhanced by Hassett's TCJA legislation. In February 2019, Brad Setser from the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote a New York Times article highlighting the failings of Hassett's TCJA in addressing the use of tax havens by U.S. corporates and why the TCJA incentivized U.S. corporate use of tax havens. On June 2, 2019, it was announced that Hassett would be stepping down from his role within the coming weeks.  Return to the Trump administration  On March 20, 2020, it was announced that Hassett will be returning to the White House on a temporary basis to advise President Trump on economic policy amid the COVID-19 pandemic. On April 15, 2020, the Trump administration announced Hassett's appointment as a senior advisor. Hassett, who has no experience in infectious disease modeling, built a model that forecast a far lower coronavirus deaths than actually happened, and additional modeling provided grim prediction about the adverse economic effects, such as a 40% reduction in GDP and unemployment numbers in the tens of millions. Hassett's model indicated that coronavirus deaths would peak in mid-April, and subsequently drop off to near zero by May 15. Hassett's model contradicts assessments by public health experts. Within the administration, Hassett encouraged the administration to re-open the economy. In early-May 2020, Hassett said there might not be a need for more coronavirus economic relief, invoking the possibility that economies in nearly all states could be re-opened by the end of May. When Hassett's model was released to the public, it was widely criticized by academics and commentators.

He is known for writing songs including \\"When Your Lover Has Gone\\" and \\"In the Middle of a Dream\\". Early life Swan was born in Fitchburg, Massachusetts to Finnish parents who had immigrated to the United States at the turn of the century; he was the second of nine children. His father was a keen amateur musician and before Einar Swan had entered his teens, he played violin, clarinet, saxophone and piano. At the age of 16 he was already playing in his own dance band, Swanie's Serenaders, and travelling around Massachusetts for three years. Swan's main instrument had been the violin but during this period he switched to alto saxophone.Sven Bjerstedt: Who was Einar Swan? - A study in jazz age fame and oblivion (2006) (published online by SFHS, The Swedish-Finn Historical Society) Career Around 1924, the bandleader Sam Lanin invited Swan to join his orchestra at New York's famed Roseland Ballroom, and Swan played with leading musicians such as cornettist Red Nichols, and members of The Charleston Chasers Vic Berton (drums) and Joe Tarto (tuba), with whom he soon started composing and arranging material for the orchestra. He also started arranging for the other resident band at the Roseland Ballroom, Fletcher Henderson's orchestra. After five months with Lanin, Swan joined Vincent Lopez's band in 1925 and went on tour to England. The band at that time also featured Mike Mosiello, Xavier Cugat and his old bandmate Joe Tarto. Shortly thereafter, the Bar Harbor Society Orchestra released \\"Trail of Dreams\\" credited to Swan and Raymond Klages. Around 1930 Swan stopped working as a musician and concentrated on arrangements, starting to work for radio programmes and bandleaders such as Eddie Cantor collaborator Dave Rubinoff and Raymond Paige. In 1931 he wrote \\"When Your Lover Has Gone\\" which was featured in the James Cagney film Blonde Crazy (1931). The song became a hit and has since been covered by many other performers such as Lee Wiley, Louis Armstrong, Ethel Waters, Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughan and Frank Sinatra. In 1939, he composed \\"In the Middle of a Dream\\" with Tommy Dorsey and Al Stillman, which was recorded by Glenn Miller and Red Norvo. Personal life Swan married, on August 7, 1925, Ann \\"Billie\\" Kaufman in Brooklyn. Kaufman's sister, Pauline, was married to lyricist Albert Stillman, with whom Swan would collaborate on \\"In the Middle of a Dream\\". At the same time, Swan converted to his wife's religion, Judaism, and changed his middle name from William to Aaron. Swan's conversion exacerbated tensions with his father, who had already been unhappy about Swan abandoning classical music for jazz; his father never spoke to him again after the marriage. Einar and Ann had two children, Pearl, born in 1926 (later known as Leslie von Roeder), and Donald, born in 1930. He died of a cerebral hemorrhage in Greenwood Lake, New York in 1940 at the age of 37. After Swan's death, Sinatra donated his royalties from \\"When Your Lover Has Gone\\" to Ann, Swan's widow.

Brand history  Max was launched in 1975 to capitalize on what appeared to be a 120mm cigarettes phenomenon, and was Lorillard's answer to More and Saratoga brands. Sales of Max lagged behind these two brands throughout the 70s and early 80s, but they did do better than Tall 120s, Eve 120s, the Original Virginia Slims 120s (introduced in 1976, in Fresno, CA, and quickly discontinued), and Dawn 120s (also quickly discontinued). Max maintained popularity over Eve 120s, Capri 120s, and Carlton 120s, but would lag behind Virginia Slims Luxury Lights 120s, introduced by Philip Morris in 1985, with a very aggressive advertising campaign targeting female smokers. Ultimately, in 1993, sales of Max cigarettes would falter a bit more, with the introduction of Misty, a bargain brand, and the only bargain brand which marketed a 120mm length. Max cigarettes were produced only in a full flavour variety; lights or ultra-lights varieties were not available. They were packaged only in soft packs, and were available only in 120mm length. Both regular and menthol flavours were available. Max cigarettes were introduced with an attractive packaging, as a slim all-white superlong, specifically catering to upscale, contemporary, and style-conscious female smokers. Max cigarettes were introduced under the Kent name, to capitalize on Kent parentage and subsequent strength, as well as well known perception of effective filtration. However, Max was not specifically introduced as an extension to the Kent line, in an effort to capitalize on Kent rejectors and non-Kent smokers. Intended for the most committed smokers, they had among the highest tar and nicotine content of all cigarette brands. Eventually, sales flagged in the first decade of the 2000s as the total number of smokers declined and Lorillard marketed the cigarettes half-heartedly, making them difficult to obtain by devotees of the brand. Since Max served a small, niche market to begin with, the decline brought the death knell of the brand in the summer of 2010. Advertising An old Max billboard advertisement in East Boston, 1975 Lorillard made various advertising posters and billboards to promote the brand in the 1970s and 1980s. Ads from the 1970s featured stylish women who explained that \\"The longer they are, the fewer I smoke\\". Because the statement is completely false, the woman goes on to say, \\"It s wacky, but it works. Max 120 s take longer to smoke so you don t light up as often\\". Other Max ads marketed the brand as sexy, comparing Max cigarettes to an attractive man named Max: \\"Say hello to Max\\" ads from 1975 read. \\"Hello long, lean and delicious\\". Another ad urged the consumer to \\"Make friends with Max\\". Still, other ads concentrated on the fashionable aspect of the cigarette, much like most women's cigarettes. These ads, which reached into the 1980s, presented the cigarette as an accessory for any outfit, featuring fashion-forward models under a slogan advising consumers to \\"Wear a Max today!\\". Further, these \\"Wear a Max\\" ads spoke to feminine concerns with beauty, claiming that the cigarette was long, lean and great looking, insinuating that by smoking an attractive cigarette, the smoker would be attractive, too. Markets Max was mainly sold in the United States, but was also sold in the United Kingdom, Poland, Romania and Israel.

Construction and commissioning The third USS Brunswick, she was laid down on 27 May 1968 at Lowestoft, England by Brooke Marine Ltd.; launched on 14 October 1969; sponsored by the wife of Vice Admiral David C. Richardson, USN (Ret.); delivered to the Navy at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 21 November 1972; and commissioned there on 19 December 1972, Lt. Comdr. John B. Haskins in command. Brunswick finished out 1972 and began 1973 fitting out at Norfolk. On 13 March 1973, she got underway for the Pacific Ocean. Along the way she visited Brunswick, Georgia and Montego Bay, Jamaica. She transited the Panama Canal on 29 March and, after visits to Acapulco and a visit to Davy Jones Locker for Shellback duties off the coast of Costa Rica. The same day the captain designated the fantail not part of a US Navy ship, so all the off duty personnel were able to have a couple of beers. Then went to San Francisco, arrived in Pearl Harbor on 31 May. She conducted shakedown training during the month of July and, early in August, passed final contractor's trials. On 11 September, she began a three-month post-shakedown availability followed by a restricted availability at the Dillingham Shipyard. Brunswick completed repairs on 31 January 1974 and began normal operations in the Hawaiian Islands. Operational history On 22 June she embarked upon her first deployment to the western Pacific. The ship arrived in Sasebo, Japan on 8 July. On the 10th, she got underway for salvage training near Chinhae, Korea. Sixteen days later, she completed that mission and shaped a course--via Subic Bay for fuel--to Singapore. The salvage tug arrived in Singapore on 6 August and remained there until the 30th, serving as standby salvage ship for a task force operating in the Indian Ocean. When Brunswick departed Singapore, she headed for the Malacca Strait where she rendezvoused with the task force leaving the Indian Ocean. After steaming with that unit for two days, the ship set off independently for Subic Bay. Between 8 and 11 September, she conducted salvage training in the Subic Bay operating area. Following that, she visited Hong Kong between 16 and 25 September. Brunswick returned to Subic Bay on the 28th and spent the next week engaged in target towing duty in the local operating area. She continued operations in the vicinity of Luzon until 22 November at which time she laid in a course for Oahu. Brunswick reentered Pearl Harbor on 6 December and commenced a leave and upkeep period that lasted through the end of the year and into 1975. Standdown ended on 9 January when she put to sea to recover a downed helicopter near Maui. The salvage tug spent the last two weeks of January training in salvage operations near the island of Kauai. For the entire month of February, however, she remained in port at Pearl Harbor. Early in March, Brunswick returned to sea briefly for another round of training. Salvage training came at the end of the month. Late in April, the ship conducted surveillance operations on Soviet ships exercising nearby. Following a return to Pearl Harbor from 5 May to 2 June for upkeep, Brunswick resumed type training, salvage exercises, and diving drills out of Pearl Harbor. Such operations, as well as local tows, occupied the ship's time through the end of 1975 and for the first three months of 1976. On 12 April 1976, she departed Pearl Harbor on her way to duty with the United States Seventh Fleet in the Far East. She stopped at Guam from 29 April to 7 May before continuing west to the Philippines. Brunswick entered Subic Bay on 15 May. She performed salvage missions and training duty in the Subic Bay area until late May. On 28 May, the ship stood out of Subic Bay for Taiwan. After a port visit at Kaohsiung from 30 May to 7 June, she continued on to Japan, arriving at Numazu on 12 June. She spent two days at Numazu conducting sea bottom surveys for amphibious landing mats before moving on to Yokosuka. Brunswick operated out of Yokosuka from 15 June to 2 August, conducting salvage operations in Suruga Wan. On the latter day, she shaped a course for Guam. The salvage tug arrived in Apra Harbor on 9 August and began a two-week availability. On the 26th, she headed for Pearl Harbor. The ship entered her home port on 15 September but remained only a week. On 22 September, she embarked upon a voyage to the west coast of the United States. She arrived in San Francisco, California on the 28th and began preparations to tow the former to Bremerton, Washington. She made the tow between 1 and 10 October and afterward made port visits to Bremerton and to Vancouver, British Columbia. She departed Vancouver for Oahu on 21 October and reentered Pearl Harbor on the 29th. Post-deployment leave and upkeep occupied the period from 30 October to 29 November. Two weeks of duty as standby salvage vessel in the Pearl Harbor area followed. On 13 December, Brunswick began a restricted availability that saw her through the end of the year. The availability continued into 1977. She resumed normal operations on 17 January 1977 and continued so employed through the next three months. On 18 April, after 10 days of preparations in Pearl Harbor, the salvage tug embarked upon another voyage to the west coast of the United States. She arrived at Alameda, California on 25 April. On 3 May, Brunswick took the former in tow off Treasure Island and laid in a course for Hawaii. She pulled her charge into Pearl Harbor on 16 May and then resumed local operations. That occupation lasted until 1 July when she set off for Wake Island to salvage a Navy EC-130Q aircraft. The operation was completed on 18 August, and Brunswick returned to Pearl Harbor on the 26th. The ship spent the next month in port preparing for regular overhaul. On 26 September she entered drydock at the Dillingham Shipyard. Undocked on 14 November, the salvage tug moved to the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard to complete the overhaul. Brunswick completed the repair period on 26 May 1978 but did not resume active service until 26 June. Salvage training, diver qualifications, and various general ship's drills constituted her activity until mid-October when she began preparing for another deployment to the western Pacific. She stood out of Pearl Harbor on the morning of 24 November and shaped a course westward. The first 17 days of December brought her surveillance duty in the Trust Territories of the Pacific Islands. On the 18th, Brunswick put into Apra Harbor, Guam, where she remained for the rest of 1978. She departed Guam for the Philippines on 3 January 1979. The salvage tug reached Subic Bay on the 8th and began a series of training evolutions out of that port. On 31 January, she steamed out of Subic Bay bound for Hong Kong. Her crew enjoyed a week of liberty in the British colony between 2 and 9 February before heading for a rendezvous with . The frigate had suffered an engineering casualty, and Brunswick took her in tow on 10 February. The salvage tug pulled Davidson into Subic Bay on 14 February, remained there for two days, and then got underway for Japan on the 16th. Originally bound for Beppu, she was rerouted to Sasebo to pick up another tow. She took the barge in tow on 24 February and headed for Pohang, South Korea, and another salvage operation, which took up the period from 26 February to 7 March. Following that, she visited Chinhae and Pusan before returning to Subic Bay on the 24th. She remained only until the 26th when she departed the Philippines for a port visit to Kaohsiung, Taiwan. That visit was significant in that the United States had recently severed diplomatic ties with that country to establish relations with the Peking government. Brunswick was one of the first Navy ships to visit Taiwan since the rupture. Serving as a diplomatic barometer, she recorded fair weather as the Taiwanese greeted her and her crew warmly during the six-day call. On 2 April, Brunswick stood out of Kaohsiung and set course for Singapore. After three days at sea, she rendezvoused with and embarked 29 Vietnamese refugees whom the frigate had rescued at sea. The salvage tug arrived in Singapore on 7 April and disembarked the refugees. She stayed at Singapore for almost two weeks, heading back to Subic Bay on the 20th. The ship stopped at Subic Bay from 26 to 29 April and then began the voyage to Pearl Harbor with YC-1542 and YC-6568 in tow. She stopped at Guam and picked up an additional tow, , at Midway Island before arriving back in Pearl Harbor on the afternoon of 24 May. Following the usual post-deployment leave and upkeep period, Brunswick resumed normal operations out of Pearl Harbor in late June. For the next year, the salvage tug conducted training operations in the Hawaiian Islands and underwent the usual series of inspections and evaluations. Most frequently, she engaged in salvage training and diver qualifications and evaluations. On occasion, however, she towed targets for gunnery drills, served as a training platform for junior officer ship handling exercises, and conducted independent ship's drills. Early in June 1980, Brunswick began preparations to deploy to the western Pacific. On 21 June, the ship put to sea bound for the Philippines. On 4 July 1980, the salvage tug arrived in Apra Harbor, Guam, for what was to have been a short provisioning and fueling stop. A salvage and scuttling mission, however, kept her at Guam for over seven weeks. She finally resumed her voyage west on 25 August. Her first port of call was Hong Kong where she remained for the first 10 days in September. From there, she moved to Singapore, arriving on 15 September. On 1 October, Brunswick shaped a course for the Philippines. On 3 October, she rescued 27 Vietnamese refugees on the high seas and brought them into Subic Bay with her on the 6th. On 20 October, the ship departed Subic Bay for Korea. She arrived in Chinhae on 26 October and spent the next two weeks engaged in training exercises with divers of the Republic of Korea Navy. She departed Chinhae on 9 October bound for Japan. After port visits to Sasebo, Numazu, and Yokosuka, Brunswick got underway from the latter port on 27 November and laid in a course for Hawaii. The salvage tug arrived in Pearl Harbor on 8 December and began the usual post-deployment leave and upkeep period. The year 1981 opened with Brunswick still engaged in post-deployment and holiday standdown. She got underway again on 14 January 1981 for target towing duty. Her return to normal duty in the Hawaiian Islands lasted until 13 April when she began a two-month availability at pierside in Pearl Harbor. She completed repairs on 12 June and got underway to resume local operations on the 16th. That employment continued through September and into October. On 5 October the ship departed Pearl Harbor bound for the west coast with two floating drydocks (YRDMs) in tow. She arrived in San Francisco on 14 October and remained there until the 18th. She made port visits to Long Beach and San Diego before departing the latter port on 28 October to return to Oahu. Brunswick reentered Pearl Harbor on 4 November. For a month, the salvage tug took up local operations again. On 4 December 1981 she began preparations for overseas movement. Decommissioning Brunswick was decommissioned on 8 March 1996. On 29 August 1996 she was transferred to South Korea through the Security Assistance Program. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 12 December 1996, and became ATS-28 Gwangyang. In April 2010, Gwangyang participated in the salvage of the ROKS Cheonan (PCC-772).

Dresden, 25 August 1730 ‚Äì d. Dresden, 21 June 1806) was a Saxon prince and member of the House of Wettin. He was the fourth but second surviving son of Augustus III, King of Poland and Elector of Saxony, and Maria Josepha of Austria. Life Regent of Saxony His older brother, the Elector Frederick Christian, died on 17 December 1763 after a reign of only 74 days. Franz Xavier took over the regency of the Electorate together with his sister-in-law, the Dowager Electress Maria Antonia of Bavaria, on behalf of his infant nephew, the new Elector Frederick Augustus III. As co-regent, Franz Xavier continued the rationalistic reforms of his brother. Princes standard In October 1765, Franz Xavier performed in the name of the young Elector a formal renunciation of the Polish Crown in favor of Stanislaus Poniatowski, as was required by the treaty signed between Prussia and Russia on 11 April 1764. This was done against the wishes of the boy's mother, the Dowager Electress Maria Antonia. During the regency, Franz Xavier attempted to introduce a plan of army reform based upon the Prussian model of Frederick the Great. This brought him into conflict with the estates of the country, who violently refused to implement his proposal because of the high expense associated with his reorganization plan. According to the regulations imposed by the Golden Bull of 1356, the regency of an underage Elector ended when he reached his eighteenth birthday. As a result, in 1768, the Elector Frederick Augustus III was formally proclaimed an adult, and Franz Xavier ended his functions as the regent of the Electorate of Saxony. Secret Marriage, Exile and Return to Saxony In Dresden on 9 March 1765 Franz Xavier married morganatically an Italian lady-in-waiting to his sister-in-law, the Dowager Electress, the contessa Maria Chiara Spinucci. The union was kept secret until 1777 when it was formally announced and legitimized. In 1769, Franz Xavier moved his family to France, the home of his younger sister, the Dauphine Marie-Jos√®phe, who had died two years earlier. He lived in France for almost twenty years under the assumed title of Count of Lusatia (fr: Comte de Lusace, de: Graf von der Lausitz). In 1774, his nephew, Louis XVI, became the king of the country. Franz Xavier and his family chose to flee France at the beginning of the French Revolution. They moved to Rome; while in Rome, the Prince sat for a bust by Domenico Cardelli. After the death of his wife in 1792, he remained in Rome for some years. Eventually, though, he returned to Saxony and settled into Schloss Zabeltitz. Franz Xavier lived there until his death, aged seventy-five. Issue During their marriage, Franz Xavier and Maria Chiara had ten children ‚Äîknown as counts and countesses of Lusatia (de: Graf/Gr√§fin von der Lausitz) ‚Äî but only six survived to adulthood: #Ludwig Ruprecht Joseph Xavier (b.

Wainwright (March 15, 1906 ‚Äì October 11, 1965), also known by her married name Helen Stelling, was a competition diver and swimmer who represented the United States at the 1920 Summer Olympics and 1924 Summer Olympics. She remains the only woman to ever win Olympic silver medals in both swimming and diving. Biography Helen Wainwright (right) with WSA teammate Aileen Riggin (left) in 1925 Helen Wainwright was the daughter of John Wainwright, a bricklayer from Lancaster, England, who emigrated to New York in 1888. She was a member of the Women's Swimming Association (WSA) of New York. Swimming coach Louis de B. Handley called Wainwright the world's fastest swimmer. She won 19 gold medals in U.S. national championships, 17 of them for swimming and the other two for diving events. At the 1920 Olympics in Antwerp, aged just 14 years old, Wainwright won the silver medal in the women's 3-meter springboard competition. Four years later, at the 1924 Olympics in Paris, she won the silver medal in the women's 400-meter freestyle event. On August 19, 1922, Wainwright set a world record in the women's 1500 metres freestyle swimming event, which stood for over three years. Shortly after the 1924 Olympics, she performed in swimming-and-diving shows at the New York Hippodrome along with fellow Olympians Aileen Riggin and Gertrude Ederle. They later toured round some of the biggest theaters in the U.S. using a portable water tank. Wainwright very nearly became the first woman to swim the English Channel in 1926; she was selected by the WSA to make the attempt but was forced to pull out due to an injury, so her teammate Gertrude Ederle was chosen to take her place.

He was originally selected by the Tennessee Titans as the 204th overall pick in the 6th round of the 2007 NFL Draft. He played college football at Central Arkansas. PRO: Now in his fifth NFL season, former sixth-round draft pick Jacob Ford is one of the most established pass rushers on the squad. From 2008 through 2010, no other Titans defender had more than Ford‚Äôs 15.5 total sacks. The athletically-gifted Ford was one of the fastest defensive ends available in the 2007 rookie pool, but his talents were only briefly on display for the Titans before a left Achilles‚Äô injury in his first training camp resulted in his placement on injured reserve. He returned from the injury in 2008 to post seven sacks and followed that with a team-high 5.5 sacks in 2009 and three sacks in 2010.  Early years  At Melrose High School (Memphis, Tennessee) earned All-Shelby Metro, Prep Star All-Southeast Region and High Tech Tennessee's Top Prospect List honors as senior two-way lineman. He registered 229 tackles and 32 sacks during career and helped team win 1998 State Championship. He also ran track three seasons.  College career  In two seasons at Central Arkansas, Ford totaled 102 tackles, 17 sacks and 32.5 tackles for loss. As a senior (2006), he was named Division II First-team All-American by College Sports Report after starting all 10 games and leading the team with eight sacks and 15.5 tackles for loss. He added 48 tackles, four passes defensed, three forced fumbles and one fumble recovery. As a junior (2005) at Central Arkansas, he was named first-team All-Gulf South Conference, First-team All-Region and Second- team All-American after starting all 14 games for Bears team that made NCAA Division II quarterfinals. As a sophomore (2004) at Holmes Community College (Goodman, Miss.), Ford played nine games and earned All-State honors. Ford was not enrolled in college during 2002 and 2003 seasons. As a freshman (2001) at Memphis, earned Freshman All-Conference USA honors after appearing in 10 games.  Professional career  Pre-draft At the 2007 NFL combine, Ford ran the 40-yard dash in 4.68 seconds, the second-best time among defensive ends, and bench pressed 225 pounds 19 times. Tennessee Titans He was originally selected by the Tennessee Titans as the 204th overall pick in the 6th round of the 2007 NFL Draft. In 2007 Ford injured his left Achilles‚Äô tendon in practice on August 13, 2007 and was placed on injured reserve a week later.

The plane was a new Douglas DC-8 named \\"Shiga\\", flying from Tokyo International Airport (Haneda) to San Francisco International Airport. Due to heavy fog and other factors, Asoh mistakenly landed the plane near Coyote Point in the shallow waters of San Francisco Bay, two and a half miles short of the runway. None of the 96 passengers or 11 crew were injured in the landing. Incident An early report from the Coast Guard stated the aircraft came to rest upside down. In fact, the plane came to rest on the Bay floor in shallow water approximately deep, leaving the forward exits above the waterline. The chief purser, Kazuo Hashimoto, felt there was no panic amongst passengers after landing, and tried to make an announcement with the public address (PA) system. Since the PA system had failed after the landing, he ended up shouting from the forward cabin for passengers to \\"Be quiet, the plane has reached the bottom of the sea. It will not sink. Do not worry, we are well-fixed for evacuation.\\" The passengers and crew all evacuated the plane on lifeboats, which were towed by police and Coast Guard boats to the nearby Coyote Point Yacht Harbor. Captain Asoh was the last to leave. Asoh returned to the plane after ensuring everyone was safely ashore to gather and return the passengers' personal belongings. After the incident, the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) stated it was the first successful ditching of a jetliner since the inauguration of jet service. The landing may have been assisted by the unusually high tide of , compared with the typical water level of , leading South San Francisco fire chief John Marchi to declare the ditching \\"a one-in-a-million shot\\" as the increased depth gave sufficient cushioning while being shallow enough that exit doors would remain above the water. Cause of accident Captain Asoh was a veteran pilot who had flown with Japan Airlines for 14 years in 1968, with roughly 10,000 hours of flight time, 1,000 of them on DC-8s. During World War II he served as a flight instructor for the Japanese military. His first officer, Captain Joseph Hazen, had similar flight time, but little DC-8 experience. Captain Asoh attempted an automatic-coupled Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach, something neither of them had done before on a recorded DC-8 flight. The cloud ceiling was 300 feet, with visibility of 3/4 of a mile, and there was little contrast between the sky and the calm waters of the bay. As a result, once the plane descended below the clouds, the mistake was not recognized in time to correct it before hitting the water. Captain Asoh stated that he realized the plane was too low once he spotted the water after the plane broke through the fog at an altitude of with an air speed of . He grabbed the control stick to gain altitude, but the plane had already struck the water. Captain Asoh stated (through a translator) that \\"the plane was fully automatic\\" and he couldn't \\"say what was wrong [to cause the water landing]\\" because he had been in contact with the control tower during the entire approach and was never informed he had deviated from the flight path. The NTSB review of the incident found that: > The probable cause of this accident was the improper application of the > prescribed procedures to execute an automatic-coupled ILS approach. This > deviation from the prescribed procedures was, in part, due to a lack of > familiarization and infrequent operation of the installed flight director > and autopilot system.  The \\"Asoh defense\\"  Asoh, when asked by the NTSB about the landing, reportedly replied, \\"As you Americans say, I fucked up.\\" In his 1988 book The Abilene Paradox, author Jerry B. Harvey termed this frank acceptance of blame the \\"Asoh defense\\", and the story and term have been taken up by a number of other management theorists. Aftermath The aircraft was later repaired and flew for Okada Air. The aircraft was not severely damaged and was recovered 55 hours after the incident at high tide, after several failed earlier attempts to hoist it out of the water. After being sprayed down with of fresh water, it was transported to the airport on a barge. External damage was extremely minor, as it had been noted that the only part of external equipment damaged on the aircraft was the right gear bogie, with one wheel being sheared off when the plane ditched by accident. Further inspections revealed only slight structural damage, with repairs estimated to take less than six months. United Airlines offered for to refurbish and repair the aircraft for JAL, to which Japan Airlines agreed and the aircraft was fixed and refurbished over a period of half a year. The aircraft was returned to JAL on March 31, 1969, and underwent a successful test flight on April 11, 1969 from San Francisco to Honolulu. It was later renamed \\"Hidaka\\" and continued in service to JAL until 1983. Asoh was temporarily barred from passenger planes, demoted to First Officer, went through further ground training, and continued to fly for JAL until his retirement. Hazen also returned to flying a few months later. By 1973 Japan Airlines was using Boeing 747 aircraft on the Tokyo to San Francisco route. Today, Japan Airlines still operates a route named Flight 2 (JAL002) from Haneda to San Francisco, currently using the Boeing 777-300ER. Aircraft later history JA8032 was sold to Air ABC (registration TF-BBF), then to Okada Air (registration 5N-AON), and finally flew as an express freighter for Airborne Express (registration ) before being decommissioned and scrapped at Wilmington Air Park (ILN) in December 2001.

The film was animated by Cartoon Saloon and premiered on 8 February 2009 at the 59th Berlin International Film Festival. It went into wide release in Belgium and France on 11 February, and Ireland on 3 March. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature but it lost to Up. It was directed by Tomm Moore and co-directed by Nora Twomey, produced by Paul Young, Didier Brunner and Vivian Van Fleteren, written by Fabrice Ziolkowski, distributed by G√©b√©ka Films, Kinepolis Film Distribution, Buena Vista International, edited by Fabienne Alvarez-Giro and music composed by Bruno Coulais and K√≠la. It stars Evan McGuire, Brendan Gleeson, Christen Mooney, Mick Lally (in his final film role) , Michael McGrath, Liam Hourican, Paul Tylak and Paul Young. Plot Set in 9th century Ireland, during the age of Viking expansion, the film's protagonist is Brendan, a curious and brave boy living in the tightly knit Abbey of Kells under the care of his stern uncle, Abbot Cellach, who is obsessed with building a wall around the Abbey to prevent Viking attacks. Apprenticed in the scriptorium of the monastery, Brendan hears the other monks talk of Brother Aidan, creator of the Book of Iona, and becomes curious about the mysterious illuminator and the book that \\"turns darkness into light\\" (the unfinished Book of Kells). Aidan arrives in Kells, accompanied by his white cat, Pangur B√°n,http://www.newvideo.com/secretofkells/ after his monastery of Iona is destroyed by a raid. After eavesdropping on a discussion between Cellach and Aidan, Brendan wanders into the scriptorium and finds the still-to-be- completed book guarded by Pangur B√°n. Aidan arrives, and tells Brendan about the book. Seeing Brendan as a suitable apprentice, Aidan sends him and Pangur B√°n into the woods to obtain gall nuts to make ink. Cornered by a hungry pack of wolves, Brendan is saved by the fairy Aisling, who overcomes her initial suspicion and accepts Brendan after he reveals his intentions of helping to create the book. After a close encounter with Crom Cruach, a deity of death and destruction of whom Aisling is deeply afraid, Brendan and Aisling return to the outskirts of the forest, and she assures him that he can return any time. At the monastery, Brendan is reprimanded by Cellach, who forbids him to leave again. Continuing to work with Aidan, Brendan learns that the work is endangered by the loss of the Eye of Colm Cille, a special magnifying lens captured from Crom Cruach. When Brendan tries to visit Crom's cave to obtain another Eye, Cellach confines him to his room. Freed by Pangur B√°n and Aisling, Brendan runs into the heart of the woods, where a shocked Aisling begs him not to confront the dark deity, warning that Crom Cruach will kill him just as it killed her mother and the rest of her people. Declaring that the book will never be completed without the Eye, Brendan persuades Aisling to help him enter Crom's cave, narrowly escaping death in the process. Brendan duels with Crom and seizes the Eye, blinding Crom and causing the deity to consume itself, becoming an ouroboros. Returning to the cave entrance, Brendan finds the forest covered in white flowers. Brendan returns to the abbey and continues to assist Aidan in secret, watched excitedly by the brothers of the monastery. A messenger from outside warns Cellach that the Vikings are on their way. In a fit of anger and frustration, Cellach locks Brendan and Aidan in the scriptorium, but not before ripping out a page Brendan had created. The Vikings invade Kells and breach the wooden gate, to Cellach‚Äôs horror. Cellach is wounded by an arrow, then by a Viking blade, as the Vikings swarm Kells. Still locked in the burning scriptorium, Brendan and Aidan escape using green smoke from the gallberry ink, confusing the raiders. The wooden staircase to the abbey‚Äôs central tower becomes overloaded with panicked villagers and collapses, and the village and abbey below are set ablaze. Unable to help Cellach, Brendan and Aidan flee to the forest with Pangur B√°n as the Vikings breach the main church and attack the monks and villagers hiding within. Vikings in the forest find Brendan and Aidan and search them for treasure, scattering the pages of the book, but Aisling's wolves arrive and either scare away or kill the Vikings. As Brendan finds the final page of the book, he comes face to face for a moment with a white wolf, who may be Aisling. Kells has been sacked and burnt, with few survivors, and Cellach critically injured, but he survives. Brendan and Aidan travel across Ireland and, after many years, complete the book. Aidan, after entrusting the book to Brendan, dies, and the now-adult Brendan returns to Kells with Pangur B√°n, guided by Aisling in white wolf form. Brendan reunites with the aged, guilt-ridden Cellach, and shows him the completed Book of Kells. The film closes with an animated rendition of some of the illuminated pages of the book. Cast * Evan McGuire as Brendan, a bright, imaginative, and curious 12-year-old who leads a sheltered life. * Brendan Gleeson as Abbot Cellach, a former illuminator who now superintends a wall to protect the Abbey of Kells from invasion. * Christen Mooney as Aisling, a forest fairy, related to the Tuatha De Danann, living in the woods outside of Kells. * Mick Lally as Brother Aidan, a master illuminator * Michael McGrath as Adult Brendan * Liam Hourican as Brothers Tang and Leonardo, two illuminators from Asia and Italy, respectively. * Paul Tylak as Brother Assoua, an illuminator from Africa. * Paul Young as Brother Square, an illuminator from England. Influences Folio 32v of the original Book of Kells shows Christ enthroned. The film is based on the story of the origin of the Book of Kells, an illuminated manuscript Gospel book in Latin, containing the four Gospels of the New Testament located in Dublin, Ireland. It also draws upon Celtic mythology; examples include its inclusion of Crom Cruach, a pre-Christian Irish deity and the reference to the poetic genre of Aislings, in which a poet is confronted by a dream or vision of a seeress, in the naming of the forest sprite encountered by Brendan. Wider mythological similarities have also been commented upon, such as parallels between Brendan's metaphysical battle with Crom Cruach and Beowulf's underwater encounter with Grendel's mother. The Secret of Kells began development in 1999, when Tomm Moore and several of his friends were inspired by Richard Williams's The Thief and the Cobbler, Disney's Mulan, Gustav Klimt's paintings, John Bauer's illustrations and the works of Hayao Miyazaki, which based their visual style on the respective traditional art of the cultures featured in each film. They decided to do something similar to Studio Ghibli's films but with Irish art. Tomm Moore explained that the visual style was inspired by Celtic and medieval art, being 'flat, with false perspective and lots of colour'. Even the clean up was planned to 'obtain the stained glass effect of thicker outer lines'. Reception The film was very well received by critics; it holds a 90% overall approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 83 reviews with an average rating of 7.61/10. Rotten Tomatoes critics concluded that the film was \\"Beautifully drawn and refreshingly calm, The Secret of Kells hearkens back to animation's golden age with an enchanting tale inspired by Irish mythology.\\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 based on reviews from critics, the film has a score of 81 (indicating \\"universal acclaim\\") based on 20 reviews. Some critics compared the film to Hayao Miyazaki's works such as Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away. Joe Morgenstern of the Wall Street Journal said that \\"it pays homage to Celtic culture and design, together with techniques and motifs that evoke Matisse, Miyazaki and the minimalist cartoons of UPA\\".

Biography Born in San Gabriel, Jalisco, Galindo studied intermittently from 1931 to 1944 at the National Conservatory in Mexico City, studying with Carlos Ch√°vez (composition), Candelario Huizar, Jos√© Rol√≥n, and Manuel Rodr√≠guez Vizcarra (piano). In 1934, he formed the Grupo de los cuatro with fellow composers Daniel Ayala, Salvador Contreras, and Jos√© Pablo Moncayo, seeking to use indigenous Mexican musical materials in art-music compositions . In 1941, he was an assistant at the Berkshire Music Festival at Tanglewood, and studied under Aaron Copland at the Berkshire Music Center in 1941 and again in 1942, when his orchestral suite Arroyos was performed there (Stevenson 2001). Returning to Mexico in 1942, he became a professor of composition at the National Conservatory and in 1947 was named Director of the conservatory (a position which he held until 1961) as well as director of the music department of the National Institute of Fine Arts . From 1960 to 1965, he was music director for the Symphony of the Mexican Institute of Social Security . In 1947, Galindo was named Chief of the Department for the National Institute of Fine Arts. In September 1947, Ch√°vez named him Director of the National Conservatory of Music, a title he maintained until 1961. Before this appointment he began as a student at the Conservatory, later becoming a professor of many subjects including \\"harmony, counterpoint, musical analysis, history of music and composition.\\" While at the Conservatory, Galindo also conducted the student orchestra, reformed the bylaws and built a new building. In August 1949, he was invited to be an adjudicator at the fourth Chopin piano competition in Warsaw. During this visit to Europe he travelled to seven countries to officially inspect schools of music . In 1952, he married Ernestina Mendoza Vega.

In 1960, he was able to focus on composition when he was awarded a \\"fellowship from the Secretary of Public Education\\". Galindo retired in 1965 and dedicated himself to his composition, writing some for pleasure and others for \\"commission\\". To do this, he would frequently \\"retreat from Mexico City to a house in the country for weeks at a time in order to immerse himself fully.\\" To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the opening of the new building at the Conservatory, he directed the Conservatory orchestra and chorus in 1974. In July 1974, Galindo accompanied the President of Mexico with \\"a number of other intellectuals\\" to South America. Galindo \\"constantly [fought] the problem of trying to have [his works] performed more than just once and the financial problems of having them published\\". R.P. Conant wrote of Galindo, \\"He would, however, like to write an opera or even a cycle of operas dealing with the life of Mexico, the agitated life of Mexico from the Aztec leader Cuauht√©moc through the leaders of Mexican independence like Morelos, Ju√°rez, Zapata, and Cardenas\\" .

During the primary election, the results from the Democratic Party was close among three of the four candidates. Thus, the top two Democrat candidates - incumbent Governor of Florida William \\"Haydon\\" Burns and Mayor of Miami Robert King High - competed in a runoff election on May 24, 1966. In an upset outcome, Robert King High was chosen over W. Haydon Burns as the Democratic Gubernatorial nominee. In contrast, the Republican primary was rather uneventful, with businessman Claude Roy Kirk Jr. easily securing the Republican nomination against Richard Muldrew. In the general election, Claude Kirk won by a margin of 55.13%-44.86% against Robert King High, becoming the first Republican Governor of Florida since the Reconstruction Era. Background Democratic Haydon Burns, who won the gubernatorial election in 1964, was up for re-election. Although gubernatorial elections in Florida are normally every four years, the cycle of gubernatorial elections was changed so as not to coincide with presidential election years. Thus, the Governor of Florida elected in 1964 would serve from January 5, 1965 to January 3, 1967, while the next term would last from January 3, 1967 ‚Äì January 5, 1971.Michael Mello, Deathwork: Defending the Condemned, University of Minnesota Press, 2002, , Democratic nomination Candidates * Incumbent Governor Haydon Burns * Mayor of Miami and candidate for 1964 nomination Robert King High * State Senator and candidate for 1964 nomination Scott Kelly of Lakeland * Sam Foor Campaign In September 1965, a poll with a sample size exceeding 3,000 people indicated Governor Haydon Burns had an approval rating of 75%. However, by March 1966, the Governor's approval rating fell to 56%, due to Burns' alleged dishonesty, lack of integrity, and showing favoritism. In that same \\"confidential\\" poll Robert High surprisingly led Haydon Burns by 34%-28.5%, while Scott Kelly received 18.5% and 19% were left undecided. Due to the \\"stunning\\" results this poll conducted by Haydon Burns' campaign managers, they attempted to cover up it up. By the end of November, the three major Democratic candidates in 1964 all announced their intention to run for governor in 1966, which were incumbent Governor Haydon Burns, Mayor of Miami Robert King, and State Senator Scott Kelly. Additionally, it was speculated that former Governor Thomas \\"LeRoy\\" Collins would also challenge Burns in the primary, but instead ran for United States Senate in 1968. Eventually a fourth person, Tallahassee publisher Sam Foor, decided to enter the race, though he was not considered a \\"serious contender\\". Both the Democratic and Republican primary election took place on May 3, 1966. The results of the Democratic primary were Haydon Burns with 372,451 votes (35.35%), Robert High with 338,281 votes (32.11%), Scott Kelly with 331,580 votes (31.47%), and Sam Foor with 11,343 votes (1.08%). Because none of the four candidates received at a majority of votes, a runoff election was held between Haydon Burns and Robert King, the top two candidates, on May 24, 1966. After the run-off election, Robert High defeated Haydon Burns by a margin of 596,471-509,271 (53.94%-46.065). Thus, Robert King High was the Democratic nominee for the 1966 gubernatorial election in Florida. Results Republican nomination 1964 United States Senate nominee Claude Roy Kirk won nomination over his opponent Richard Muldrew. General election After a bitter Democratic primary election, defeated incumbent Governor Haydon Burns refused to endorse nominee Robert High. However, High was able to draw endorsements from major Florida newspapers, labor unions, and other Democratic politicians in Florida. High made unpopular proposals, such as a severance tax on phosphate and tightening the sales tax on all products except food and drugs. Republican nominee Claude Kirk promised to veto new taxes and abolish a program calling for several millions of dollars in additional taxation. Kirk also noted that a vote for him would be a vote against inflation and warned voters about the \\"Johnson-Humphrey-High Administration\\". The general election campaign was described as \\"dreary\\", with a projected voter turnout of less than 65%. On Election Day - November 8 - Claude Kirk won the general election with 821,190 (55.13%) votes versus Robert High's 668,233 (44.86%) votes. As a result, Claude Kirk became the first Republican elected to the office of Governor of Florida since Ossian B. Hart in 1872. At the time of the election, the Florida Constitution did not include a provision allowing a lieutenant governor. However, after a new state constitution was adopted in 1968, Governor Kirk appointed Ray C. Osborn as Lieutenant Governor of Florida, the first to serve in that office since Milton H.

Payne (later Sanborn, July 18, 1896 ‚Äì September 7, 1988) was an American diver won the bronze medal in the 3 meter springboard at the 1920 Summer Olympics. She also won the springboard at the AAU Championships in 1918‚Äì1920. Payne was AAU national champion in diving in 1918, 1919 and 1920.Olympian's Oral History Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles Interview March 1987 Oxnard CA between Anita DeFrantz and Thelma Payne Sanborn Biography Thelma Payne was born in Salem, Oregon on July 18, 1896. Her mother, Bertha Payne, was listed as a widow by the 1910 United States Census. She lived in Portland, Oregon with her three daughters and was employed as a real estate stenographer. Bertha Payne was a member of a women's basketball club that played in Oregon and California. In 1908, the city council of Coos Bay, Oregon passed an ordinance that established a bounty on rat carcasses. The first person to claim a bounty from the town marshal was a young Thelma Payne. She was listed working as a switchboard operator in 1911 at the age of 15. In 1912, Payne was indicted on charges of theft. According to a complaint by Mrs. L Naylor, Payne‚Äîalong with the three other people‚Äîabsconded with her silverware. She initially entered a plea of not guilty, but eventually paid a $15 fine. A year later, Payne was listed in the Portland directory as a stenographer for attorney W. B. Gleason. Payne displays her diving form for The Oregonian, circa 1917. Payne first joined the swimming and diving team at the Multnomah Athletic Club in 1915. In 1916, The Oregonian wrote that Payne was \\"one of the Multnomah Athletic Club's best swimmers and divers\\". Around that time, Payne broke her nose and jaw while diving at the Multnomah Athletic Club. She lost half of her upper teeth and required 16 stitches under her chin. During an interview with the Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles in 1988, Payne said of the incident, \\"Well, it didn't hurt; I guess that nothing hurts me. I don't know what I'm made of. [...] But I didn't have my hands out. They didn't tell me to put my hands out, so I came down with my hands at my sides, lifted my head to come up, and hit the bottom of the swimming pool.\\" After a short recuperation, Payne returned to the diving board. During the 1917 Rose Festival in Portland, Payne competed in several aquatic events including surfing‚Äîwhich she won. The competition required the surfer to keep form on the board while being towed behind a boat, which is similar to modern wakeboarding. Upon her return from the 1920 Olympics, Payne told The Oregonian that the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) had done little to help her on her way to Antwerp. According to Payne, the USOC did not arrange her living quarters during Olympic qualifying matches in New York. She eventually met-up with a former member of the Multnomah Athletic Club who was living in New York and stayed in their home during the qualifying period. Payne also claimed that the five pre-arranged judges for the qualifying matches failed to appear, so the USOC used substitute judges. Payne accused the replacement judges of unfairly favoring the New York diver. When they got to Antwerp, she said the USOC mismanagement continued. She was quoted in The Oregonian as saying, \\"The Olympic games officials and their families were given first-class cabins and the best food. The second and third-class cabins were allotted to the girl members of the American team while the men athletes were quartered in the hold of the army transport, USS Princess Matoika\\". Payne had to take a leave of absence from her work as the chief telephone switchboard operator for the City of Portland to compete in the 1920 Olympics. The city council passed a resolution that paid her for the two and a half months she missed for competition, which totaled to $250. According to a 1922 profile of Payne by The Oregonian, she was not a naturally skilled diver and required significant training to reach the Olympic level. She was introduced to swimming at the YWCA by instructor Millie Schloth and later witnessed a diving performance by Constance Meyer, which sparked her interest in the sport. She trained to dive at the Multnomah Athletic Club under instructor Jack Cody. Following the 1920 Olympics, Payne became the swimming and diving instructor at the Portland YWCA. Her work at the YWCA involved training girls under six for various aquatic sports including synchronized swimming and diving. In 1922, Payne was hired by the Windemuth Bath House on Ross Island to instruct their swimming and diving courses. Payne used Jantzen Swimwear and was mentioned by name in company advertisements following her Olympic bronze medal victory. In 1926, Payne moved from Oregon to California, where she worked as a swimming instructor at the Breakers Beach Club in Santa Monica, the Jonathan Club, the Hollywood Athletic Club, and the Los Angeles Athletic Club. Payne trained swimmer Bowen Stassforth, who won a silver medal at the 1952 Summer Olympics, to overcome his fear of water. She also trained 1951 Pan American Games multi-gold medalist Sharon Geary, who went to the 1952 Summer Olympics as an alternate competitor for the United States. In 1983 she was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame.

In later life Captain Burt served as Honorary Colonel of the Regiment. Burt was born in New England and graduated from Norwich University in 1939 where he was a member of Theta Chi Fraternity. The Norwich Corps of Cadets is known historically as a source of cavalry officers and Burt was commissioned as an armor officer - then the new mechanized form of cavalry. He entered active service in 1941 and was assigned to the 66th Armor Regiment, 2nd Armored Division at Fort Benning, Georgia. He served in North Africa, Sicily, and Northern Europe. Promoted to captain, Burt commanded Company B, 66th Armor in near continuous combat from the day the unit landed at the Normandy beachhead in June 1944 through the end of the war. Medal of Honor citation Captain Burt's Medal of Honor citation is unique in that he was awarded the medal not for a single act of valor, but instead for his actions during a 10-day period in October 1944 as the 2nd Armored Division fought to capture Aachen, Germany. The official citation reads: Rank and organization: Captain, U.S. Army, Company B, 66th Armored Regiment, 2d Armored Division. Place and date: Near Wurselen, Germany, October 13, 1944. Entered service at: Lee, Mass. Birth: Hinsdale, Mass. G.O. No.: 95, October 30, 1945. Citation: > Capt. James M.

However he remained a valuable member of the 2nd Armored Division family. He visited the division on many occasions at Ft. Hood, TX and also made a trip to meet soldiers stationed with the 2nd Armored Division (Forward) in West Germany. The Third Battalion of the 66th Armored Regiment was nicknamed \\"Burt's Knights\\" and eventually James Burt was made the Honorary Colonel of the 66th Armored Regiment. Burt lived much of his post-war life in New Hampshire and Pennsylvania with his wife Edythe Burt. After a career in the paper industry, he attended Keene State College and received a Master's Degree in Education in 1969. Burt then became a mathematics and business instructor at Franklin Pierce College. James M. Burt died on February 15, 2006 at the age of 88 in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania.

Born in Dresden, he was the fifth son of Augustus III, King of Poland and Elector of Saxony, and Maria Josepha of Austria. He is an ancestor of the Italian House of Savoy. Life Causes of his election as Duke of Courland The Duchy of Courland and Semigallia had been created in 1561 by Gotthard Kettler, last master of the Livonian Order, and had been ruled by his descendants until the dynasty died out in 1737. Then, Empress Anna of Russia herself the widow of Frederick William the penultimate Duke of Courland, managed to place her lover, Ernst Johann von Biron, on the Ducal throne of Courland. Empress Anna died only three years later and was succeeded by her infant grand-nephew Ivan VI, at which time von Biron had become regent of Russia. His regency lasted only three weeks. Von Biron was hated by the Russian aristocracy because of his extravagances and autocratic behaviour and also for the arrogance he had shown during Empress Anna's lifetime, as her lover. The young Tsar's mother, Anna Leopoldovna and the influential minister Burkhard Christoph von Munnich conspired to remove von Biron from office, confiscated his estates and exiled him to Siberia in the winter of 1740-41. Only months later, in November 1741, Russia witnessed another coup which brought Empress Elizabeth, a cousin of the late Empress Anna, to the throne. The child-Tsar Ivan VI, his mother Anna Leopoldovna and all other members of their family were arrested. Now, certainly, the new Tsarina Elisabeth granted a pardon to von Biron, allowed him to return from Siberia and ordered him to live in Yaroslavl. However, because of her fear that he could again return to great power as he had done during Empress Anna's reign, she refused to restore his former privileges or the Duchy of Courland. The matter of who would be Duke of Courland remained in stalemate for more than sixteen years. Finally, under pressure from Saxony and Poland, to sort out the selection of a new duke, the local nobility chose in 1758 their favoured candidate, the son of the Polish king, Prince Charles Christian. The young prince had previously travelled to St. Petersburg, from where came the agreement of Tsarina Elisabeth, confirming the plan. Duke of Courland and Semigallia Most of the Protestant Courland aristocracy harboured doubts about Charles ‚Äî largely because they feared a Roman Catholic Duke would exert his influence in favour of the Polish Roman Catholic State ‚Äî and tried to limit Charles‚Äôs powers by formulating a contract of electoral surrender, in case he exceeded his remit. Before these negotiations could come to fruition, his father appointed him Duke on 10 November 1758 and formally invested him on 8 January 1759 along with the territory of Semigallia. Thereupon Charles, who had signed only a rather vague assurance about religious observance and aristocratic privileges, travelled to Courland and, on 29 March 1759, solemnly entered the capital of his Duchy, Mitau. After the Courland Diet (Landtag) and the States had met, they lost any hope of obtaining a stronger undertaking from Charles. Nevertheless, they still favoured him. Appropriately, many aristocrats refused to pay homage on the new Duke‚Äôs appointment on 3 November 1759 and instead took their protest to Warsaw and St. Petersburg. Jelgava Palace (), built by Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli, looks over the Lielupe. The Duke was fond of the good life and lived in remarkable style in Schloss Mitau. He entertained the aristocracy with parties and hunts, whereby he was able to increase his popularity. Also, he joined a Freemason's lodge, very fashionable in Poland at that time, and thus protected himself from the aristocrats with whom the nobility were in agreement. He left domestic politics, however, in the hands of his Country administrator (Landhofmeister), Otto Christoph von der Howen. Renunciation of the Duchy and later life In July 1762, Catherine ‚Äî who had disapproved of Duke Charles because of his apparent lack of interest in the welfare of his subjects ‚Äî took the Russian throne in a coup d'√©tat. She allowed the now entirely rehabilitated von Biron to return from exile and put substantial diplomatic pressure on Saxony, with the aim of restoring him to his old position as Duke. Finally, an ailing Augustus III ‚Äî not only because of his declining health but also as a consequence of the Seven Years' War ‚Äî accepted the fate of his son and denied him his support. Without it, Charles was forced to renounce the Duchy in 1763, and returned to Saxony. His hopes of regaining the Duchy of Courland evaporated after the shortly ensuing death of his father and the Saxon Electors' loss of the Polish Crown. Thereafter, Charles lived in Dresden and dedicated himself to hunting on the Annaburger plain. Charles died in Dresden aged sixty-two. He was buried in the Marienstern Monastery (Kloster Marienstern) in M√ºhlberg. Morganatic marriage and issue On 25 March 1760 in Warsaw, Charles had secretly married Franciszka Krasi≈Ñska, daughter of Stanis≈Çaw Krasi≈Ñski. Because the beautiful Franciszka did not belong to a ruling dynasty or immediate noble family, the marriage was deemed morganatic in Saxony, though not in Poland. In response to his persistence and that of supporters in the Saxon court, in June 1775 his wife was granted by Emperor Joseph II the title of Princess. The couple had two daughters: #Maria Theresia (born and died 1767). #Maria Christina Albertina Carolina (born Dresden, 7 December 1770 - died Paris, 24 November 1851), married firstly on 24 October 1797 to Carlo Emanuele of Savoy, Prince of Carignan, and after his death she was married on 1 February 1816 to Jules Maximilien Thibaut, Prince de Montl√©art.Charles of Saxony, duke of Courland and Semigallia in: geneall.net [retrieved 21 September 2015] Through his surviving daughter's first marriage, Charles became an ancestor of the Italian Royal Family that reigned from 1861 to 1946.

In the daytime, most species rest in shelters made from folded leaves sewn with silk. Some species use silk to burrow in sand, earth or wood. Raspy crickets evolved the ability to produce silk independently from other insects, but their silk has many convergent features to silkworm silk, being made of long, repetitive proteins with an extended beta-sheet structure.

This, the only extant photograph of Abing, is taken from his identity card during the Japanese occupation of Wuxi. The original is now at the Abing Ancestral House Museum in Wuxi. A reel of wire records, from the only extant collection of recordings of Abing's music Abing (; 17 August 1893 - 4 December 1950), born as Hua Yanjun (), was a blind Chinese musician specializing in the erhu and pipa. Life Abing was born on August 17, 1893, in the eastern Chinese city of Wuxi to father Hua Qinghe, who was a Taoist priest. His mother was a widow, and her remarriage to a priest was resented by her family; she remained depressed and died a year after Abing's birth. Abing was raised by extended family until the age of eight, when he went to live with his father at the temple. Abing was the name used by his family. He was given the official name Hua Yanjun at this time and sent to school. Abing's father was proficient in a number of musical instruments and Taoist religious music. His father trained him in drums from the age of 10. Abing began learning the dizi at age 12, then the erhu, undergoing a rigorous set of training, such as playing the flute with weights attached to the end of the flute to increase the power of his wrist. At age 17, Abing first performed in religious ceremonies, and won acclaim for his musical talent, presentation, and voice. In 1914, upon the death of his father, Abing took charge of the temple along with his cousin. However, badly run operations at the temple, and an opium addiction, drove Abing into poverty. At the age of 34, he contracted syphilis and progressively lost sight in both his eyes. He became homeless and earned a living as an itinerant street performer. In 1939, he married Dong Cuidi(Ëë£ÂÇ¨Âºü), a country widow in Jiangyin. After his marriage, Abing performed every afternoon in a public square in Wuxi. He became famous for incorporating topical issues into his music and songs, especially the war with Japan. After the performance, he would walk through the city's streets, playing the erhu. This was a period of prolificacy for Abing, and his most famous composition, Erquan Yingyue, was performed in this period. After the Japanese takeover of Wuxi, Abing travelled to Shanghai, while his wife went to her home village. In Shanghai, Abing played music for a kunqu opera company. In 1939, he returned to Wuxi and his old routine. However, his musical current affairs commentary also irked the authorities, and after 1945 he was prohibited from singing about news items at his usual place of performance. In 1947, Abing suffered a severe bout of lung disease. He stopped performing, and earned a living repairing huqin. In the summer of 1950, two professors of the Central Conservatory of Music, Yang Yinliu and Cao Anhe, both Wuxi natives, travelled to Wuxi to record Abing. By this time, Abing had not performed for almost three years. After three days' practice, and in two sessions, three erhu pieces and three pipa pieces were recorded. However, Abing's favourite piece, Meihua Sannong, was not recorded when the team ran out of blank records. The recording brought Abing wider acclaim, and in September he was offered a teaching position with the Central Conservatory of Music. However, he was by this time too ill to accept, and died on December 4, 1950. He was buried in the graveyard of the temple where he was born. His wife also died three months later. Abing's tomb in Xihui park Influence File:‰∫åÊ≥âÊò†Êúà.ogg Abing's most famous piece is entitled Erquan Yingyue (‰∫åÊ≥âÊò†Êúà, engl.: The Moon's Reflection on the Second Spring), which is named after a spring in Wuxi (which is today part of Xihui Park). It is still played as a standard erhu piece, although it necessitates a special set of strings that are tuned lower than normal erhu strings. He was only recorded very late in his life, but despite the scarcity of documentation of his music, he is nevertheless considered to be one of the most important Chinese musicians of the 20th Century. His signature pieces, such as Erquan Yingyue, have become classics of Chinese erhu and pipa music. His music can be heard on The Norton Recordings, ninth edition. Abing's family home in Wuxi was destroyed by floodwaters in 1991, but rebuilt in 1993 and is now a memorial to Abing and his music.ÂÄæÂøÉÁúãÊä§Á•ñÂ±Ö13Âπ¥‰∏ç‰∫ÜÊÉÖ‚Äî‚Äî ËÆ∞ÈòøÁÇ≥Á•ñÂ±Ö‰πâÂä°ÁúãÁÆ°ÂëòÂº†Áà±Ëä¨ (Devoted care of the house for 13 years: the volunteer caretaker of Abing's ancestral home, Zhang Aifeng) Notes Further reading *Stock, Jonathan P.

These strengthening mechanisms give engineers the ability to tailor the mechanical properties of materials to suit a variety of different applications. For example, the favorable properties of steel result from interstitial incorporation of carbon into the iron lattice. Brass, a binary alloy of copper and zinc, has superior mechanical properties compared to its constituent metals due to solution strengthening. Work hardening (such as beating a red-hot piece of metal on anvil) has also been used for centuries by blacksmiths to introduce dislocations into materials, increasing their yield strengths. Basic description Plastic deformation occurs when large numbers of dislocations move and multiply so as to result in macroscopic deformation. In other words, it is the movement of dislocations in the material which allows for deformation. If we want to enhance a material's mechanical properties (i.e. increase the yield and tensile strength), we simply need to introduce a mechanism which prohibits the mobility of these dislocations. Whatever the mechanism may be, (work hardening, grain size reduction, etc.) they all hinder dislocation motion and render the material stronger than previously.Davidge, R.W., Mechanical Behavior of Ceramics, Cambridge Solid State Science Series, (1979)Lawn, B.R., Fracture of Brittle Solids, Cambridge Solid State Science Series, 2nd Edn. (1993)Green, D., An Introduction to the Mechanical Properties of Ceramics, Cambridge Solid State Science Series, Eds. Clarke, D.R., Suresh, S., Ward, I.M. (1998)Callister, William Jr, Materials Science and Engineering, An Introduction. John Wiley & Sons, NY, NY (1985) The stress required to cause dislocation motion is orders of magnitude lower than the theoretical stress required to shift an entire plane of atoms, so this mode of stress relief is energetically favorable. Hence, the hardness and strength (both yield and tensile) critically depend on the ease with which dislocations move. Pinning points, or locations in the crystal that oppose the motion of dislocations,Kuhlmann-Wilsdorf, D., \\"Theory of Plastic Deformation,\\" Materials Science and Engineering A, vol 113, pp 1-42, July 1989 can be introduced into the lattice to reduce dislocation mobility, thereby increasing mechanical strength. Dislocations may be pinned due to stress field interactions with other dislocations and solute particles, creating physical barriers from second phase precipitates forming along grain boundaries. There are five main strengthening mechanisms for metals, each is a method to prevent dislocation motion and propagation, or make it energetically unfavorable for the dislocation to move. For a material that has been strengthened, by some processing method, the amount of force required to start irreversible (plastic) deformation is greater than it was for the original material. In amorphous materials such as polymers, amorphous ceramics (glass), and amorphous metals, the lack of long range order leads to yielding via mechanisms such as brittle fracture, crazing, and shear band formation. In these systems, strengthening mechanisms do not involve dislocations, but rather consist of modifications to the chemical structure and processing of the constituent material. The strength of materials cannot infinitely increase. Each of the mechanisms explained below involves some trade-off by which other material properties are compromised in the process of strengthening. Strengthening mechanisms in metals  Work hardening  The primary species responsible for work hardening are dislocations. Dislocations interact with each other by generating stress fields in the material. The interaction between the stress fields of dislocations can impede dislocation motion by repulsive or attractive interactions. Additionally, if two dislocations cross, dislocation line entanglement occurs, causing the formation of a jog which opposes dislocation motion. These entanglements and jogs act as pinning points, which oppose dislocation motion. As both of these processes are more likely to occur when more dislocations are present, there is a correlation between dislocation density and shear strength. The shear strengthening provided by dislocation interactions can be described by: \\\\Delta\\\\tau_d = \\\\alpha Gb\\\\sqrt{\\\\rho_\\\\perp} where \\\\alpha is a proportionality constant, G is the shear modulus, b is the Burgers vector, and \\\\rho_\\\\perp is the dislocation density. Dislocation density is defined as the dislocation line length per unit volume: \\\\rho_\\\\perp = \\\\frac{\\\\ell}{\\\\ell^3} Similarly, the axial strengthening will be proportional to the dislocation density. \\\\Delta\\\\sigma_{y} \\\\propto {Gb\\\\sqrt{\\\\rho_\\\\perp}} This relationship does not apply when dislocations form cell structures. When cell structures are formed, the average cell size controls the strengthening effect. Increasing the dislocation density increases the yield strength which results in a higher shear stress required to move the dislocations. This process is easily observed while working a material (by a process of cold working in metals). Theoretically, the strength of a material with no dislocations will be extremely high ( \\\\sigma \\\\approx \\\\frac{E}{10} ) because plastic deformation would require the breaking of many bonds simultaneously. However, at moderate dislocation density values of around 107-109 dislocations/m2, the material will exhibit a significantly lower mechanical strength. Analogously, it is easier to move a rubber rug across a surface by propagating a small ripple through it than by dragging the whole rug. At dislocation densities of 1014 dislocations/m2 or higher, the strength of the material becomes high once again. Also, the dislocation density cannot be infinitely high, because then the material would lose its crystalline structure.Citation needed This is a schematic illustrating how the lattice is strained by the addition of interstitial solute. Notice the strain in the lattice that the solute atoms cause. The interstitial solute could be carbon in iron for example. The carbon atoms in the interstitial sites of the lattice creates a stress field that impedes dislocation movement. This is a schematic illustrating how the lattice is strained by the addition of substitutional solute. Notice the strain in the lattice that the solute atom causes.  Solid solution strengthening and alloying  For this strengthening mechanism, solute atoms of one element are added to another, resulting in either substitutional or interstitial point defects in the crystal (see Figure 1). The solute atoms cause lattice distortions that impede dislocation motion, increasing the yield stress of the material. Solute atoms have stress fields around them which can interact with those of dislocations. The presence of solute atoms impart compressive or tensile stresses to the lattice, depending on solute size, which interfere with nearby dislocations, causing the solute atoms to act as potential barriers. The shear stress required to move dislocations in a material is: \\\\Delta\\\\tau = Gb\\\\sqrt{c} \\\\epsilon^{3/2} where c is the solute concentration and \\\\epsilon is the strain on the material caused by the solute. Increasing the concentration of the solute atoms will increase the yield strength of a material, but there is a limit to the amount of solute that can be added, and one should look at the phase diagram for the material and the alloy to make sure that a second phase is not created. In general, the solid solution strengthening depends on the concentration of the solute atoms, shear modulus of the solute atoms, size of solute atoms, valency of solute atoms (for ionic materials), and the symmetry of the solute stress field. The magnitude of strengthening is higher for non-symmetric stress fields because these solutes can interact with both edge and screw dislocations, whereas symmetric stress fields, which cause only volume change and not shape change, can only interact with edge dislocations. Figure 2: A schematic illustrating how the dislocations can interact with a particle. It can either cut through the particle or bow around the particle and create a dislocation loop as it moves over the particle.  Precipitation hardening  In most binary systems, alloying above a concentration given by the phase diagram will cause the formation of a second phase. A second phase can also be created by mechanical or thermal treatments. The particles that compose the second phase precipitates act as pinning points in a similar manner to solutes, though the particles are not necessarily single atoms. The dislocations in a material can interact with the precipitate atoms in one of two ways (see Figure 2). If the precipitate atoms are small, the dislocations would cut through them. As a result, new surfaces (b in Figure 2) of the particle would get exposed to the matrix and the particle-matrix interfacial energy would increase. For larger precipitate particles, looping or bowing of the dislocations would occur and result in dislocations getting longer. Hence, at a critical radius of about 5 nm, dislocations will preferably cut across the obstacle, while for a radius of 30 nm, the dislocations will readily bow or loop to overcome the obstacle. The mathematical descriptions are as follows: For particle bowing- \\\\Delta \\\\tau = {Gb\\\\over L-2r} For particle cutting- \\\\Delta \\\\tau = {\\\\gamma \\\\pi r \\\\over b L} Figure 3: A schematic roughly illustrating the concept of dislocation pile up and how it effects the strength of the material. A material with larger grain size is able to have more dislocation to pile up leading to a bigger driving force for dislocations to move from one grain to another. Thus, less force need be applied to move a dislocation from a larger, than from a smaller grain, leading materials with smaller grains to exhibit higher yield stress.  Dispersion strengthening  Dispersion strengthening is a type of particulate strengthening in which incoherent precipitates attract and pin dislocations. These particles are typically larger than those in the Orowon precipitation hardening discussed above. The effect of dispersion strengthening is effective at high temperatures whereas precipitation strengthening from heat treatments are typically limited to temperatures much lower than the melting temperature of the material. One common type of dispersion strengthening is oxide dispersion strengthening.  Grain boundary strengthening  In a polycrystalline metal, grain size has a tremendous influence on the mechanical properties. Because grains usually have varying crystallographic orientations, grain boundaries arise. While undergoing deformation, slip motion will take place. Grain boundaries act as an impediment to dislocation motion for the following two reasons: 1\\\\. Dislocation must change its direction of motion due to the differing orientation of grains. 2\\\\. Discontinuity of slip planes from grain one to grain two. The stress required to move a dislocation from one grain to another in order to plastically deform a material depends on the grain size. The average number of dislocations per grain decreases with average grain size (see Figure 3). A lower number of dislocations per grain results in a lower dislocation 'pressure' building up at grain boundaries. This makes it more difficult for dislocations to move into adjacent grains. This relationship is the Hall-Petch relationship and can be mathematically described as follows: \\\\sigma_{y} = \\\\sigma_{y,0} + {k \\\\over {d^x}} , where k is a constant, d is the average grain diameter and \\\\sigma_{y,0} is the original yield stress. The fact that the yield strength increases with decreasing grain size is accompanied by the caveat that the grain size cannot be decreased infinitely. As the grain size decreases, more free volume is generated resulting in lattice mismatch. Below approximately 10 nm, the grain boundaries will tend to slide instead; a phenomenon known as grain-boundary sliding. If the grain size gets too small, it becomes more difficult to fit the dislocations in the grain and the stress required to move them is less. It was not possible to produce materials with grain sizes below 10 nm until recently, so the discovery that strength decreases below a critical grain size is still finding new applications.  Transformation hardening  This method of hardening is used for steels. High-strength steels generally fall into three basic categories, classified by the strengthening mechanism employed. 1- solid-solution-strengthened steels (rephos steels) 2- grain-refined steels or high strength low alloy steels (HSLA) 3- transformation-hardened steels Transformation-hardened steels are the third type of high-strength steels. These steels use predominantly higher levels of C and Mn along with heat treatment to increase strength. The finished product will have a duplex micro-structure of ferrite with varying levels of degenerate martensite. This allows for varying levels of strength. There are three basic types of transformation-hardened steels. These are dual- phase (DP), transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP), and martensitic steels. The annealing process for dual -phase steels consists of first holding the steel in the alpha + gamma temperature region for a set period of time. During that time C and Mn diffuse into the austenite leaving a ferrite of greater purity. The steel is then quenched so that the austenite is transformed into martensite, and the ferrite remains on cooling. The steel is then subjected to a temper cycle to allow some level of marten-site decomposition. By controlling the amount of martensite in the steel, as well as the degree of temper, the strength level can be controlled. Depending on processing and chemistry, the strength level can range from 350 to 960 MPa. TRIP steels also use C and Mn, along with heat treatment, in order to retain small amounts of austenite and bainite in a ferrite matrix. Thermal processing for TRIP steels again involves annealing the steel in the a + g region for a period of time sufficient to allow C and Mn to diffuse into austenite. The steel is then quenched to a point above the martensite start temperature and held there. This allows the formation of bainite, an austenite decomposition product. While at this temperature, more C is allowed to enrich the retained austenite. This, in turn, lowers the martensite start temperature to below room temperature. Upon final quenching a metastable austenite is retained in the predominantly ferrite matrix along with small amounts of bainite (and other forms of decomposed austenite). This combination of micro-structures has the added benefits of higher strengths and resistance to necking during forming. This offers great improvements in formability over other high-strength steels. Essentially, as the TRIP steel is being formed, it becomes much stronger. Tensile strengths of TRIP steels are in the range of 600-960 MPa. Martensitic steels are also high in C and Mn. These are fully quenched to martensite during processing. The martensite structure is then tempered back to the appropriate strength level, adding toughness to the steel. Tensile strengths for these steels range as high as 1500 MPa. Strengthening mechanisms in amorphous materials Polymer Polymers fracture via breaking of inter- and intra molecular bonds; hence, the chemical structure of these materials plays a huge role in increasing strength. For polymers consisting of chains which easily slide past each other, chemical and physical cross linking can be used to increase rigidity and yield strength. In thermoset polymers (thermosetting plastic), disulfide bridges and other covalent cross links give rise to a hard structure which can withstand very high temperatures. These cross-links are particularly helpful in improving tensile strength of materials which contain much free volume prone to crazing, typically glassy brittle polymers.Meyers, Chawla. Mechanical Behavior of Materials. Cambridge University Press. pg 420-425. 1999 In thermoplastic elastomer, phase separation of dissimilar monomer components leads to association of hard domains within a sea of soft phase, yielding a physical structure with increased strength and rigidity. If yielding occurs by chains sliding past each other (shear bands), the strength can also be increased by introducing kinks into the polymer chains via unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds. Adding filler materials such as fibers, platelets, and particles is a commonly employed technique for strengthening polymer materials. Fillers such as clay, silica, and carbon network materials have been extensively researched and used in polymer composites in part due to their effect on mechanical properties. Stiffness-confinement effects near rigid interfaces, such as those between a polymer matrix and stiffer filler materials, enhance the stiffness of composites by restricting polymer chain motion. This is especially present where fillers are chemically treated to strongly interact with polymer chains, increasing the anchoring of polymer chains to the filler interfaces and thus further restricting the motion of chains away from the interface. Stiffness- confinement effects have been characterized in model nanocomposites, and shows that composites with length scales on the order of nanometers increase the effect of the fillers on polymer stiffness dramatically. Increasing the bulkiness of the monomer unit via incorporation of aryl rings is another strengthening mechanism. The anisotropy of the molecular structure means that these mechanisms are heavily dependent on the direction of applied stress. While aryl rings drastically increase rigidity along the direction of the chain, these materials may still be brittle in perpendicular directions. Macroscopic structure can be adjusted to compensate for this anisotropy. For example, the high strength of Kevlar arises from a stacked multilayer macrostructure where aromatic polymer layers are rotated with respect to their neighbors. When loaded oblique to the chain direction, ductile polymers with flexible linkages, such as oriented polyethylene, are highly prone to shear band formation, so macroscopic structures which place the load parallel to the draw direction would increase strength. Mixing polymers is another method of increasing strength, particularly with materials that show crazing preceding brittle fracture such as atactic polystyrene (APS). For example, by forming a 50/50 mixture of APS with polyphenylene oxide (PPO), this embrittling tendency can be almost completely suppressed, substantially increasing the fracture strength. Interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs), consisting of interlacing crosslinked polymer networks that are not covalently bonded to one another, can lead to enhanced strength in polymer materials. The use of an IPN approach imposes compatibility (and thus macroscale homogeneity) on otherwise immiscible blends, allowing for a blending of mechanical properties. For example, silicone-polyurethane IPNs show increased tear and flexural strength over base silicone networks, while preserving the high elastic recovery of the silicone network at high strains. Increased stiffness can also be achieved by pre-straining polymer networks and then sequentially forming a secondary network within the strained material. This takes advantage of the anisotropic strain hardening of the original network (chain alignment from stretching of the polymer chains) and provides a mechanism whereby the two networks transfer stress to one another due to the imposed strain on the pre-strained network. Glass Many silicate glasses are strong in compression but weak in tension. By introducing compression stress into the structure, the tensile strength of the material can be increased. This is typically done via two mechanisms: thermal treatment (tempering) or chemical bath (via ion exchange). In tempered glasses, air jets are used to rapidly cool the top and bottom surfaces of a softened (hot) slab of glass. Since the surface cools quicker, there is more free volume at the surface than in the bulk melt. The core of the slab then pulls the surface inward, resulting in an internal compressive stress at the surface. This substantially increases the tensile strength of the material as tensile stresses exerted on the glass must now resolve the compressive stresses before yielding. \\\\sigma_{y=modified} = \\\\sigma_{y,0} + \\\\sigma_{compressive} Alternately, in chemical treatment, a glass slab treated containing network formers and modifiers is submerged into a molten salt bath containing ions larger than those present in the modifier. Due to a concentration gradient of the ions, mass transport must take place. As the larger cation diffuses from the molten salt into the surface, it replaces the smaller ion from the modifier. The larger ion squeezing into surface introduces compressive stress in the glass's surface. A common example is treatment of sodium oxide modified silicate glass in molten potassium chloride. Examples of chemically strengthened glass are Gorilla Glass developed and manufactured by Corning, AGC Inc.'s Dragontrail and Schott AG's Xensation.  Composite strengthening  Many of the basic strengthening mechanisms can be classified based on their dimensionality. At 0-D there is precipitate and solid solution strengthening with particulates strengthening structure, at 1-D there is work/forest hardening with line dislocations as the hardening mechanism, and at 2-D there is grain boundary strengthening with surface energy of granular interfaces providing strength improvement. The two primary types of composite strengthening, fiber reinforcement and laminar reinforcement, fall in the 1-D and 2-D classes, respectively. The anisotropy of fiber and laminar composite strength reflects these dimensionalities. The primary idea behind composite strengthening is to combine materials with opposite strengths and weaknesses to create a material which transfers load onto the stiffer material but benefits from the ductility and toughness of the softer material.  Fiber reinforcement  Fiber-reinforced composites (FRCs) consist of a matrix of one material containing parallel embedded fibers. There are two variants of fiber-reinforced composites, one with stiff fibers and a ductile matrix and one with ductile fibers and a stiff matrix. The former variant is exemplified by fiberglass which contains very strong but delicate glass fibers embedded in a softer plastic matrix resilient to fracture. The latter variant is found in almost all buildings as reinforced concrete with ductile, high tensile-strength steel rods embedded in brittle, high compressive-strength concrete. In both cases, the matrix and fibers have complimentary mechanical properties and the resulting composite material is therefore more practical for applications in the real world. For a composite containing aligned, stiff fibers which span the length of the material and a soft, ductile matrix, the following descriptions provide a rough model. = Four stages of deformation = The condition of a fiber-reinforced composite under applied tensile stress along the direction of the fibers can be decomposed into four stages from small strain to large strain. Since the stress is parallel to the fibers, the deformation is described by the isostrain condition, i.e., the fiber and matrix experience the same strain. At each stage, the composite stress ( \\\\sigma_{c} ) is given in terms of the volume fractions of the fiber and matrix ( V_{f}, V_{m} ), the Young's moduli of the fiber and matrix ( E_{f}, E_{m} ), the strain of the composite ( \\\\epsilon_{c} ), and the stress of the fiber and matrix as read from a stress- strain curve ( \\\\sigma_{f}(\\\\epsilon_{c}), \\\\sigma_{m}(\\\\epsilon_{c}) ). # Both fiber and composite remain in the elastic strain regime. In this stage, we also note that the composite Young's modulus is a simple weighted sum of the two component moduli. #: \\\\sigma_{c} = V_{f}\\\\epsilon_{c}E_{f} + V_{m}\\\\epsilon_{c}E_{m} #: E_{c} = V_{f}E_{f} + V_{m}E_{m} # The fiber remains in the elastic regime but the matrix yields and plastically deforms. #: \\\\sigma_{c} = V_{f}\\\\epsilon_{c}E_{f} + V_{m}\\\\sigma_{m}(\\\\epsilon_{c}) # Both fiber and composite yield and plastically deform. This stage often features significant Poisson strain which is not captured by model below. #: \\\\sigma_{c} = V_{f}\\\\sigma_{f}(\\\\epsilon_{c}) + V_{m}\\\\sigma_{m}(\\\\epsilon_{c}) # The fiber fractures while the matrix continues to plastically deform. While in reality the fractured pieces of fiber still contribute some strength, it is left out of this simple model. #: \\\\sigma_{c} \\\\approx V_{m}\\\\sigma_{m}(\\\\epsilon_{c}) = Tensile strength = Due to the heterogeneous nature of FRCs, they also feature multiple tensile strengths (TS), one corresponding to each component. Given the assumptions outlined above, the first tensile strength would correspond to failure of the fibers, with some support from the matrix plastic deformation strength, and the second with failure of the matrix. :TS_1 = V_fTS_f + V_m\\\\sigma_m(\\\\epsilon_c) :TS_2 = V_mTS_m = Anisotropy (Orientation effects) = As a result of the aforementioned dimensionality (1-D) of fiber reinforcement, significant anisotropy is observed in its mechanical properties. The following equations model the tensile strength of a FRC as a function of the misalignment angle (\\\\theta) between the fibers and the applied force, the stresses in the parallel and perpendicular, or \\\\theta=0 and 90, cases (\\\\ \\\\sigma_{}, \\\\sigma_{\\\\perp}), and the shear strength of the matrix ( \\\\tau_{my} ). ;:Small Misalignment Angle (longitudinal fracture) : The angle is small enough to maintain load transfer onto the fibers and prevent delamination of fibers and the misaligned stress samples a slightly larger cross-sectional area of the fiber so the strength of the fiber is not just maintained but actually increases compared to the parallel case. : TS(\\\\theta) = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_{}}{\\\\cos^2(\\\\theta)} ;:Significant Misalignment Angle (shear failure) : The angle is large enough that the load is not effectively transferred to the fibers and the matrix experiences enough strain to fracture. : TS(\\\\theta) = \\\\frac{\\\\tau_{my}}{\\\\sin(\\\\theta)\\\\cos(\\\\theta)} ;:Near Perpendicular Misaligment Angle (transverse fracture) : The angle is close to 90 so most of the load remains in the matrix and thus tensile transverse matrix fracture is the dominant failure condition. This can be seen as complementary to the small angle case, with similar form but with an angle 90-\\\\theta. : TS(\\\\theta) = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_{\\\\perp}}{\\\\sin^2(\\\\theta)}  Laminar reinforcement  Applications and current research Strengthening of materials is useful in many applications. A primary application of strengthened materials is for construction. In order to have stronger buildings and bridges, one must have a strong frame that can support high tensile or compressive load and resist plastic deformation. The steel frame used to make the building should be as strong as possible so that it does not bend under the entire weight of the building. Polymeric roofing materials would also need to be strong so that the roof does not cave in when there is build-up of snow on the rooftop. Research is also currently being done to increase the strength of metallic materials through the addition of polymer materials such as bonded carbon fiber reinforced polymer to (CFRP). Molecular dynamics simulations The use of computation simulations to model work hardening in materials allows for the direct observation of critical elements that rule the process of strengthening materials. The basic reasoning derives from the fact that, when examining plasticity and the movement of dislocations in materials, a focus on the atomistic level is many times not accounted for and the focus rests on the contiuum description of materials. Since the practice of tracking these atomistic effects in experiments and theorizing about them in textbooks cannot provide a full understanding of these interactions, many turn to molecular dynamics simulations to develop this understanding.Buehler, Markus J. the dynamical complexity of work - hardening: a large-scale molecular dynamics simulation. Acta Mech Sinica. pg 103-111. 2005 The simulations work by utilizing the known atomic interactions between any two atoms and the relationship F = ma, so that the dislocations moving through the material are ruled by simple mechanical actions and reactions of the atoms. The interatomic potential usually utilized to estimate these interactions is the Lennard ‚Äì Jones 12:6 potential. Lennard ‚Äì Jones is widely accepted because its experimental shortcomings are well- known.Abraham, F. \\"Simulating materials failure by using up to one billion atoms and the world's fastest computer: Work-hardening.\\" Proc Natl Acad Sci. pg 5783‚Äì5787. 2002 These interactions are simply scaled up to millions or billions of atoms in some cases to simulate materials more accurately. Molecular dynamic simulations display the interactions based upon the governing equations provided above for the strengthening mechanisms. They provide an effective way to see these mechanisms in action outside the painstaking realm of direct observation during experiments.

Its main campus is in San Jose, Antipolo, province of Rizal, Philippines. In accordance with the Philippine law, ICCM first received its permit to operate from the country‚Äôs Commission on Higher Education (CHED) on 8 March 2005. History The college started in July 2000 when a number of advanced students of theology from other Bible seminaries found that they no longer had a Bible college in which to study. The students approached church ministers of Metro Manila like Nick Alfafara, Robert and Nezie Cabalteja, and Ross and Cheryl Wissmann for help with a new college where they could continue their training for the church. The first classes were held in the Wissmann‚Äôs residence then in Mapayapa Village I, Quezon City. The first professors were Bobby and Nezie Cabalteja, Tito Pel, Ferdinand Rosete, and Ross and Cheryl Wissmann. By August 2000, premises were rented in Village Plaza Building at the corner of Narra and Sampaguita streets at Mapayapa Village III that served as boys‚Äô dorm and classrooms while the girls‚Äô dormitory was at the nearby Bueno Sol, Ramax Subdivision, Quezon City. The same year, the Board of Trustees was created to act as a policy-making body and to oversee the school‚Äôs operation, fund-raising drives and promotion. Its first chair and vice-chair were Dr. Violeta N. Arciaga and Dr. Josue S. Falla, respectively, both well-known educators and scientists in the Philippine civil service. The school was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission on 21 June 2001. In 2002, when Village Plaza was repossessed by a bank, the college moved to its present location at the corner of Provincial Road and Genesis streets in Antipolo, province of Rizal. The site had been a resort, a private school, and then left derelict. Antipolo Church of Christ had been meeting there and is accommodated for their services each Sunday. The property is 5,000 square meters and a lease has been obtained for at least ten years. ICCM began with 11 students but this had declined to six by end of the first semester. Enrollment grew to 27 at the beginning of second term 2000/01 and to 66 for the first semester 2001/2002. The enrollment for second semester 2003/4 was 84 and the first semester of 2006/7 it escalated to 125 students. Undergraduate program ICCM offers a four-year Bachelor of Arts in Theology program that aims to build strong Biblical foundation of faith. It has four major areas to choose from: Ministry, Education, Outreach, and Worship/Music. Faculty ICCM faculty members are from Christian churches and seminaries abroad, mostly from the US, Australia, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Mexico, Papua New Guinea, Pakistan and India. Some are authors of Christian books and commentaries. Each of them has either an earned doctoral degree or expertise in their respective disciplines. Academic scholarship A grant for academic scholarship is available to those students who excel in academics and exemplify good moral character. Working student program Students are assigned to work alongside the staff inside the campus. Life skills are being developed among students under the work program. Work is available in places like the library, kitchen, canteen, ground and building. Working students are provided with remuneration to defray partially or totally the cost of their studies at ICCM.

He is a lecturer and educator and travels to teach groups in different parts of the world, such as in the United States and South Africa. He is also the author of numerous books on Jewish texts and is a member of the famed Weinberg rabbinical family, which has been central to 20th century Orthodox Judaism in the United States. As well as this, he is the former dean at the Hebrew Institute of California and rosh yeshiva of Kerem Yeshiva, in California. Works Weinberg's magnum opus is a series of books of discourses and discussions on the Torah, under the title Frameworks. Currently Frameworks only covers Genesis to Numbers, Deuteronomy is a work in progress. In an introduction, a sixth planned book on the first Parsha, Genesis, was mentioned as being in the works after the first five are completed. Another, earlier series discussing the Jewish holidays was also started, with only two volumes, on Rosh Hashana and Chanukah. They are numbered 1 and 8, respectively, presumably in reference to the fact that Rosh Hashana is the first holiday (The Jewish New Year,) whereas Chanukah is the last of the holidays, being the most recently enacted Rabbinical holiday. The series has seemingly been discontinued, though the books have had a new edition featuring new cover artwork published by Feldheim. The remaining parts of the series, if published would include Yom Kippur (2), the \\"Shalosh Regalim\\" (3-5), Tisha B'av (6), and Purim, (7). Family Weinberg is the son of Rabbi Yaakov Weinberg, long time rosh yeshiva of Ner Israel Talmudical Academy and grandson of Rabbi Yaakov Yitzchok Ruderman. He is the son in law of the late Rabbi Chaim Stein, the rosh yeshiva of Telshe Yeshiva in Cleveland, Ohio and is the nephew of the late Rabbi Noah Weinberg, founder of Aish HaTorah. Controversy Rumors were spread that Rabbi Weinberg sexually molested a student. Legal charges were never brought, and a Jerusalem rabbinical court dismissed the rumors, citing a lack of witnesses to any alleged misconduct,. The organization involved in spreading the rumors, The Awareness Center, Inc., together with its founder, were discredited, and eventually republished an article by a student discussing Weinberg's positive influence in his life. Yeshiva University in New York severed ties with Yeshiva Derech Eitz Chaim in Jerusalem citing its connection to Rabbi Weinberg. Yeshivat Derech Eitz Chaim sued for minimum damages of $75,000. Yeshiva University countersued. The schools reached an agreement and dropped the lawsuits in 2004. No case was filed against Weinberg.

T is the absolute temperature, k_\\\\mathrm{B} is the Boltzmann constant and \\\\varepsilon is the energy difference between the levels. The Schottky anomaly is an effect observed in solid-state physics where the specific heat capacity of a solid at low temperature has a peak. It is called anomalous because the heat capacity usually increases with temperature, or stays constant. It occurs in systems with a limited number of energy levels so that E(T) increases with sharp steps, one for each energy level that becomes available. Since Cv =(dE/dT), it will experience a large peak as the temperature crosses over from one step to the next. This effect can be explained by looking at the change in entropy of the system. At zero temperature only the lowest energy level is occupied, entropy is zero, and there is very little probability of a transition to a higher energy level. As the temperature increases, there is an increase in entropy and thus the probability of a transition goes up. As the temperature approaches the difference between the energy levels there is a broad peak in the specific heat corresponding to a large change in entropy for a small change in temperature. At high temperatures all of the levels are populated evenly, so there is again little change in entropy for small changes in temperature, and thus a lower specific heat capacity. : S = \\\\int_0^T \\\\\\\\! \\\\left(\\\\frac{C_{v}}{T}\\\\right)dT \\\\, For a two level system the specific heat coming from the Schottky anomaly has the form: : C_{\\\\rm Schottky} = R\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\Delta}{T}\\\\right)^{2} \\\\frac{e^{\\\\Delta / T}}{[1 + e^{\\\\Delta / T}]^{2}} \\\\, Where Œî is the energy between the two levels. This anomaly is usually seen in paramagnetic salts or even ordinary glass (due to paramagnetic iron impurities) at low temperature. At high temperature the paramagnetic spins have many spin states available, but at low temperatures some of the spin states are \\"frozen out\\" (having too high energy due to crystal field splitting), and the entropy per paramagnetic atom is lowered.

C. Nanjunde Gowda (c. 1928 ‚Äì 4 October 2012) was a businessman and one of the top Kannada film producers, exhibitors, financiers and distributors. He is credited with producing some of the classic films in the annals of Kannada film industry, namely, Sharapanjara, Huliya Halina Mevu, Babruvahana, Bangarada Panjara, Daari Thappida Maga and many more. He distributed more than 300 films and won several awards, notably ‚Äì the Dr. Rajkumar award from Karnataka state government and the Phalke Academy award from the Dada Saheb Phalke committee for the year 2005. Biography He was born to Chowdaiah and Muddamma as the eldest of six children at Konenahalli village of Doddaballapura, Karnataka. With no interest in education, he ventured into the Sericulture business in stages, with successful results. He then ventured into construction of film theatres ‚Äì Navrang theatre in Bangalore, Rajkamal Theatre in Doddaballapur and Urvashi Theatre, Bangalore. During this time, he started the KCN Movies banner to distribute the Kannada films; Belli Moda, directed by S.R. Puttanna Kanagal was his first Kannada film as a distributor. He later went on to distribute more than 300 films. For the progress of KCN Gowda in business, his brothers were the backbone along with his two sons ‚Äì K.C.N. Chandrashekar and K.C.N. Mohan, who are also film producers. He is a veteran Producer‚ÄìDirector, making memorable Kannada films, including blockbuster Bangarada Manushya, starring Dr. Rajkumar. Besides giving entertainment, the flagship of KCN always vouched for quality and morality in its selection of subjects and film-making. He always wanted to bring the luxury found in other languages onto the Kannada screen. In the days of KCN Gowda, the infrastructural facilities were not so good and there was struggle for the shaping of good quality films. For producing color films, the raw stock was not available. Using his strength, he was responsible for the importing of raw stock for color film production directly from foreign countries. He took challenges to boost up the quality of film-making in the Kannada Film Industry. His first such challenge was taking up T.K. Rama Rao's Bangaradha Manushya, Starring Dr. Rajkumar, directed by Siddalingaiah, which created the birth of a matinee idol of South Indian Cinema. Sharapanjara, starring Kalpana, directed by S.R. Puttanna Kanagal was another milestone in the career of K.C.N. Gowda. He produced his first Kannada film Bhale Jodi starring Rajkumar in a double role under Rajkamal Arts in the early 1970s. For this film, he launched a unique publicity strategy never employed by anyone before in Karnataka ‚Äì he erected an 80 foot cutout of Rajkumar at the time of the release of this film with prior state government permission ‚Äì his maiden film was a huge hit inspiring him to produce more than fifty popular movies in the following years. The mega success of the maiden film and the support he got from Kannada film viewers inspired him to go in for popular subjects for the Kannada screen. Bangarada Manushya ran for two years in States Theatre Bangalore, while Sharapanjara was a silver jubilee film. It was the right fruit for his discipline and devotion in work. The K.C.N. Brothers ventured into different subjects in movies, including social, mythological, historical and entertaining films. He introduced many new talents to Kannada cinema in the field of artistes and technicians. There was no shortfall in the hospitality in the production house of the KCN Gowda banner. Dr. Rajkumar was appreciating K.C.N. Gowda as \\"Anna Dhaata\\", affectionately. The K.C.N. Gowda family crossed 50 useful and successful years in filmdom, the prestigious production house of Karnataka. It has made the South Indian film industry in Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam to turn back and take a look at the marvelous work it has done. The California based Gold Stone Company was contacted by K.C.N. Gowda in giving a facelift of color to the black and white Satya Harischandra of K.C.N. Gowda. He also re-released his prior black and white produced movies in \\"color\\" and using \\"3D technology\\" lately, he colourised most of his favourite hero Dr. Rajkumar movies such as Satya Harischandra, Kasthuri Nivasa, Kaviratna Kalidasa, Babruvahana and Veera Kesari. For the film Satya Harischandra, which he produced in 1965 with 5.5 lakhs(.55 million) rupees budget, he re-released on cinema scope, color and using DTS technology for the same film in 2008 with 3.5 crores. In another of his lovable statements he said \\"Live like Dr. Rajkumar. I have invested crores on Sathya Harischandra to make it color. It is only because of admiration to Dr Rajakumar. He is remembered for his lines 'Failure became stepping stone to success. Those who come here for business will not go away so easily.'\\" ( K.C.N. Gowda died aged 84.

Life  The youngest son of the Burgtheater actor Hugo Thimig and Franziska \\"Fanny\\" Hummel, his siblings included actors Helene Thimig and Hermann Thimig. He performed without any training as a 16-year-old under the pseudonym \\"Hans Werner\\" at the Wiener Volkstheater. From 1918 to 1924 he was engaged ‚Äì under his real name ‚Äì at the Burgtheater, and then moved to the Theater in der Josefstadt, managed by his future brother-in-law Max Reinhardt. There, besides his father, his sister Helene Thimig and his brother Hermann Thimig also performed, so that the Viennese public used to call it the \\"Thimig-Theater\\". He soon began to direct as well, at first in the Theater in der Josefstadt, and later also in the film industry. Hans Thimig remained loyal to the Theater in der Josefstadt until 1942. It was also thanks to him that the theatre survived the National Socialist period relatively \\"Nazi- free\\". Thimig saw to it that the director of the Deutsches Theater in Berlin, Heinz Hilpert, also took over the running of the Josefstadt Theatre (Reinhardt too had managed both theatres simultaneously). When Max Reinhardt died in American exile in 1943, Hilpert together with the Thimig brothers, despite the Nazi regime, organised a memorial event in the Theater in der Josefstadt.The Third Reich's Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels apparently referred to the theatre as \\"a concentration camp on holiday\\" (German: \\"Ein KZ auf Urlaub\\") At the end of 1944 Thimig's superiors ordered him to shoot a politically tendentious film in Berlin. Karl Hartl, the director of production at Wien- Film, advised him however just to \\"clear off\\", which he did. He withdrew to the small town of Wildalpen, where the family owned a holiday home, while Hartl covered for him and reported him sick. After the war Thimig became mayor of Wildalpen for a short time, as he was the only man in the place without a National Socialist record. From 1949 he performed again on stage in Vienna, alternating between the Burgtheater (of which he became an honorary member) the Theater an der Josefstadt and the Wiener Volkstheater. On top of that he continued to work as a film director and in 1959 took over from his sister Helene (who retired on grounds of age) the direction of the prestigious Vienna Max Reinhardt Seminar, as the School of Drama of the Akademie f√ºr Musik und darstellende Kunst had been renamed after World War II, in honour of the great Austrian director. Hans Thimig died in 1991 in Vienna, aged 90. He left his body to science, but a memorial stands in the Vienna Zentralfriedhof. He was twice married. His daughter Henriette Thimig is also an actress.

The station's broadcast license is held by Tiger Communications, Inc. and operated by Fred Randall Hughey. Programming Since June 28, 2012, the station has broadcast an oldies music format to the Montgomery, Alabama, area. The music mix, described as the \\"greatest hits of all time\\", is hosted by live, local personalities including Fred Randall Hughey, Brother Rick Dorley, Lamar Godwin, Fr. Mateusz Rudzik, Michael Bird, and Scott Adcock. This programming traces its origins to the June 1979 sign-on of then-WACQ (1130 AM, now WALQ) in Tallassee, Alabama. WACQ provides coverage to the Reeltown High School athletic teams, a commitment that began when WACQ signed on in 1979. The first song ever played on WACQ in 1979 was \\"Let Your Love Flow,\\" by The Bellamy Brothers. The first record was played by owner and general manager Fred Randall Hughey. Today, the Listen Live application on the website, wacqradio.com, as well as the TuneIn app available on smartphones and other devices, give WACQ an audience far beyond the Tallassee area it calls home. Weekday programming includes \\"Way of the Cross\\" with Brother Rick Dorley; \\"What's Going On?\\" with Rick Dorley and station owner Fred Randall Hughey; and local news, weather, and sports at 6:00, 7:00, 8:00, 9:00, and 12:00 each day. Weekend programming consists of \\"The Saturday Morning Show\\" with Michael Bird and Scott Adcock; Reeltown High School football replays; Troy University Trojans football; and, on Sundays, gospel music and church services from St. Vincent de Paul Catholic Church, First Baptist Church (Reeltown), and First Baptist Church of Tallassee. Former branding Before this change, WACQ broadcast a Gospel music format featuring programming from Citadel Media and branded as \\"Rejoice 580\\". Outside of WACQ Studios in Downtown Tallassee History This station, then known as WABT, received its license to cover from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission on September 3, 1952. In November 2005, Tiger Communications Inc. (Thomas Hayley, president) reached an agreement to acquire the station, by then known as WBIL, and WQSI from H&H; Communications LLC (Fred Randall Hughey, member) for a reported combined sale price of $350,000. The FCC approved the deal on February 13, 2006, and the transaction was completed on April 6, 2006. In retaining partial ownership in WBIL and rights to the WACQ call sign, Fred Randall Hughey and his wife Debra began programming AM 580 effective June 28, 2012. On July 27, 2012, the station changed its call sign from WBIL to WACQ. Early history In 1977, Hughey Broadcasting Company, Inc., applied to the FCC for a construction permit for a new broadcast radio station. The FCC granted this permit on February 8, 1979. This new station would broadcast with 1,000 watts of power on a frequency of 1130 kilohertz, but only during daylight hours to protect KWKH in Shreveport, Louisiana, CKWX in Vancouver, British Columbia, and WBBR in New York City from skywave interference. The station was assigned call sign \\"WACQ\\". After construction and testing were completed, the station was granted its broadcast license on August 6, 1979. In August 2006, Hughey Communications applied to the FCC to increase this class D station's daytime-only power from 1,000 to 25,000 watts. The FCC granted a construction permit for this change on August 21, 2007. WACQ began broadcasting as 580 WACQ, replacing WBIL's signal, in June 2012. From 2006 until 2019, the translator W266BJ broadcast WACQ's programming on FM 101.1. On February 14, 2019, WACQ moved to W253CZ and broadcasts on 98.5 FM.

The terms steamed rice or boiled rice are also commonly used. Any variant of Asian rice (both Indica and Japonica varieties), African rice or wild rice, glutinous or non-glutinous, long-, medium-, or short-grain, of any colour, can be used. Rice for cooking can be whole grain or milled. Cooked rice is used as a base for various fried rice dishes (e.g. ch«éof√†n, khao phat), rice bowls/plates (e.g. bibimbap, chazuke, curry rice, dal bhat, donburi, loco moco, panta bhat, rice and beans, rice and gravy), rice porridges (e.g. congee, juk), rice balls/rolls (e.g. gimbap, onigiri, sushi, zongzi), as well as rice cakes and desserts (e.g. mochi, tteok, yaksik). Rice is a staple food in not only Asia and Latin America, but across the globe, and is considered the most consumed food in the world. The U.S. Department of Agriculture classifies rice as part of the grains food group. Nutritionally, 200 g of cooked steamed white rice contributes toward the daily recommended of grains for women and men, respectively, and is considered a good source of micronutrients such as zinc and manganese.  Preparation  white Japonica rice in gamasot, a traditional Korean cauldron A close-up view of steamed Thai sticky rice in a traditional Lao rice steamer Rice is often rinsed and soaked before being cooked. Unpolished brown rice requires longer soaking time than milled white rice does. The amount of water added can vary depending on many factors. Newly harvested rice usually requires less water, and softer varieties need more water than firmer varieties. Rice can be boiled in a heavy-bottomed cookware or steamed in a food steamer. Some boiling methods do not require precise water measurements, as the rice is strained after boiling. This draining method is suitable for the less glutinous varieties such as basmati rice, but not-suitable for varieties like japonica rice which become sticky to some degree when cooked. Optionally, a small amount of salt can be added before cooking. If not drained, boiled rice is usually cooked on high heat until a rolling boil, then simmered with the lid on, and steamed over the residual heat after turning off the heat. Nowadays, electric rice cookers are also commonly used to cook rice. During cooking, rice absorbs water and increase in volume and mass.  Use in dishes  In East Asia, cooked rice is most commonly served in individual bowls, with each diner receiving one. Food from communal dishes is placed upon the rice, and is then eaten. Cooked or boiled rice is used as an ingredient in many dishes. Leftover steamed rice is used to make porridge or fried rice dishes. Some common dishes using cooked rice as the main ingredient include: * Fried rice dishes ** Arroz chaufa ** Bokkeum-bap *** Kimchi fried rice ** ChƒÅhan *** Omurice ** Chinese fried rice *** Hokkien fried rice *** Yangzhou fried rice *** Yin yang fried rice ** Nasi goreng *** Nasi goreng pattaya ** Omelette rice ** Thai fried rice *** American fried rice * Rice bowls and plates ** Bibimbap *** Hoe-deopbap ** Chazuke ** Dal bhat ** Donburi *** Ch≈´kadon *** Gy≈´don *** Katsudon *** Oyakodon *** Unadon *** Tekkadon ** Loco moco ** Panta bhat ** Red beans and rice ** Rice and beans ** Rice and curry ** Rice and gravy ** Tumpeng * Rice porridges ** Congee ** Juk * Rice balls and rolls ** Gimbap ** Jumeok-bap ** Lemper ** Onigiri ** Rice ball salads *** Nam khao *** Yam naem ** Sushi *** B.C. roll *** California roll *** Dynamite roll *** Philadelphia roll *** Seattle roll *** Spider roll ** Zongzi * Rice cakes and desserts ** Mochi ** Tteok ** Yaksik ** Yeot  Use in beverages  * Alcoholic ** Cheongju *** Beopju ** Choujiu ** Gamju ** Hariya ** Huangjiu *** Mijiu *** Shaoxing wine ** Lao-Lao ** Makgeolli ** R∆∞·ª£u c·∫ßn ** Sake a Japanese alcoholic beverage. ** Sato ** Sonti * Non-alcoholic ** Sikhye  Varieties  Most common is plain, steamed white rice; however, a number of varieties and are served, many with specific cooking methods.

If a gas is unstable against convection then if an element is displaced upwards its buoyancy will cause it to keep rising or, if it is displaced downwards, it is denser than its surroundings and will continue to sink. Therefore, the Schwarzschild criterion dictates whether an element of a star will rise or sink if displaced by random fluctuations within the star or if the forces the element experiences will return it to its original position. For the Schwarzschild criterion to hold the displaced element must have a bulk velocity which is highly subsonic. If this is the case then the time over which the pressures surrounding the element changes is much longer than the time it takes for a sound wave to travel through the element and smooth out pressure differences between the element and its surroundings. If this were not the case the element would not hold together as it traveled through the star.

He was seen as a representative of the right wing of the party. Over the years, he took a leading influence in the party district of Ostwestfalen and Lippe. He was a parliamentarian in the German Empire, the Weimar Republic and in Northrhine-Westphalia. He first played more than a regional role when he became Reich and later State Commissar in the Ruhr from 1919 to 1920. He was Interior Minister of Prussia from 1920 to 1926, Minister of the Interior from 1928 to 1930 and Interior Minister of Prussia again from 1930 to 1932. Along with fellow Social Democrat, Otto Braun, Severing agreed to General Hans von Seeckt's plans for a secret army to protect Germany's eastern border against a sudden attack from Poland. At the Nuremberg Trials on 21 May 1946, Severing defended this strategy by saying: > That the army of 100,000 men granted to Germany was not sufficient even for > a defensive war was and is known to-day possibly to everyone in Germany > concerned with politics. Germany got into a very bad situation with regard > to her eastern neighbours since the establishment of the Corridor.

He was naturally fatigued, but took part in our discussions for the remainder of a long evening\\".GHI Bulletin 26 ‚Äì Feature Severing introduced the law for the defence of the Republic and said of it on 13 March 1930: > The right of assembly has become the wrongs of assembly, and press freedom > has become press licence.

Last year in Prussia alone three hundred policemen were wounded > and fourteen killed in the course of their duties.Franz von Papen, Memoirs > (London: Andre Deutsch, 1952), p. 132. Early life Origins and first political experience Severing came from a working-class family from Herford, that lived in cramped conditions. His father Bernhard worked as a cigar-sorter, his mother Johanna was a seamstress. It was a Protestant family. Their circumstances became desperate when his father became mentally ill. Carl and his half-brother had to help their mother sort cigars, an activity which was performed at home. A pastor offered to pay for Carl to receive higher education. He suggested that Carl should himself later become a pastor. Carl however rejected this, wanting to become a musician. This turned out to be too expensive however, so after attending the Volksschule he started a locksmith's apprenticeship, which he finished in 1892. Politics did not play a role in the family, but despite this Carl showed an early interest in the socialist workers' movement. A colleague explained to him what their aims were. Immediately after his journeyman's examination, he joined the Deutscher Metallarbeiter-Verband (DMV; German Metalworkers' Association). He soon took up various positions in the organisation. He became secretary, and, in 1893 was elected as the DMV's representative in the local trade unions' council. In the same year he organised the foundation of a social-democratic association in Herford. This organisation did not last long however, and was obliged to try a second attempt in 1894 with several others. In this period he was already active as a correspondent and contact person for the social democratic newspaper Volkswacht in the nearby Bielefeld. In this way he met Carl Hoffmann and Carl Schreck, then the leading social democrats of Bielefeld, with whom he would later have a close working relationship. In 1894 he left Herford and moved to Bielefeld. There he gave up his craft-based job and moved into industry. He found a job at the D√ºrkopp works. In Bielefeld he was active in the party and the union. In 1896 he played a leading role in the failed strike or lock-out at D√ºrkopp. For this reason he lost his job. Switzerland After losing his job, Severing went south, and in 1895 came to Z√ºrich after various other stops. There he was a skilled worker in a metalworking factory and was active in the Swiss metalworkers' association, which had sub-organisations for immigrated German workers. He also had connections to the local committee of German social democrats, and to the German workers' education association \\"Eintracht\\". In the various associations, Severing established himself in a short while as a leading figure. In the years in Switzerland, Severing's political views became markedly more radical. His criticism of social-democratic politics led to him giving up his posts in the workers' educational committee. In his speeches, he now often spoke of world revolution, and no longer of ameliorating the political and social situation of the workers. From afar he observed critically how the SPD of Ostwestfalen took a decidedly pragmatic course, and even considered taking part in the Prussian Landtag elections which until then had been spurned due to the three-class franchise. In 1898 he left Switzerland again and returned to Bielefeld. Rise in the Bielefeld workers' movement After his return from Switzerland, he married a distant relative, Emma Wilhelmine Twelker, with whom he was to have 2 children. Their relationship with one another was in accordance with the petty bourgeois patriarchal norms of the time. She remained, as a housewife, entirely focused on the family. Severing had a traditional understanding of the roles of husband and wife and this manifested itself at the beginning of his daughter's studies: he allowed her to start studying medicine, but said that she would probably give up her studies after a few semesters to get married. Immediately on his return he started being active again in the regional workers' movement. He gave a speech in 1899 in front of the Bielefeld social democrats, which was concerned with the poor-quality education in the Volksschule. He advocated self-education and support by social-democratically oriented organisations. He also advanced lively educational events as being more attractive than dry political speeches. With his radical views, he remained quite isolated in the party. He was not, for example, able to persuade the Ostwestfalen district to condemn the revisionists of Eduard Bernstein. Due to the low support within the party, Severing moved the emphasis of his activities to trade union activism. He rose rapidly in this area, and in 1901 he became director of the local branch of the Deutscher Metallarbeiter-Verband. At this time the local union had only approximately 1300 members, which represented about 30% of the possible number. In Severing's time in office, the number of members rose sixfold, which was significantly higher than the national average. Already by 1906 the number of unionised workers was at 75%. What contributed to Severing's success was the introduction of a system of shop stewards. This system guaranteed closeness to the concerns and needs of the members. Severing's closeness to the grassroots was one reason for his popularity among the Bielefeld workers. In his activism work, he used unorthodox measures. He organised a 10-year anniversary orchestra concert that attracted 2000 visitors. From his base in the metalworkers' movement, Severing expanded his influence to the whole union organisation in Bielefeld, against heavy opposition from other associations. At the latest by 1906 he was the central figure in the workers' movement of the city. In 1906 and 1910 Severing achieved successes for the workers without strikes. In 1911 there was a major work stoppage, which also went successfully. In 1912 he gave up his position in the DMV. In the years of mainly trade union activity, Severing's political stance changed greatly. He abandoned his revolutionary positions for a marked pragmatism, which inside the party was often regarded as right-wing. His aim was no longer the \\"dictatorship of the proletariat,\\" but the integration of workers in society. In this respect, he became closer to the revisionist stance he had once staunchly opposed.

The capital of the kingdom, then known as Pundranagara (Pundra city), was located at Mahasthangarh in Bogra District in northern Bangladesh. Etymology There are several theories regarding the word ‚ÄòPundra‚Äô. According to one theory the word ‚ÄòPundra‚Äô owes its origin to a disease called ‚ÄòPandu‚Äô. The land where most of the people were suffering from that disease was called Pundrakshetra (land of Pundra). Punda is a species of sugarcane. The land where that species of sugarcane was extensively cultivated was called Pundadesa (land of Punda). According to later Vedic texts like Aitereya Aryanaka of 8th-7th century BC, the Pundra was a group of non-Aryan people who lived east of the Sadanira River (Gandaki River). The Mahabharata also made a similar reference. In the 1st century AD, the land was mentioned as Pundravardhana for the first time in AshokavadanaAshokavadana Geography Mahasthangarh, the ancient capital of Pundravardhana is located 11 km (7 mi) north of Bogra on the Bogra-Rangpur highway, with a feeder road (running along the eastern side of the ramparts of the citadel for 1.5 km) leading to Jahajghata and site museum.Hossain, Md. Mosharraf, pp. 14-15. Discovery Several personalities contributed to the discovery and identification of the ruins at Mahasthangarh. F.Buchanan Hamilton was the first European to locate and visit Mahasthangarh in 1808, C.J.O‚ÄôDonnell, E.V.Westmacott, and Baveridge followed. Alexander Cunningham was the first to identify the place as the capital of Pundravardhana. He visited the site in 1889.Hossain, Md. Mosharraf, pp. 16-19 Pundra people The Pundra were people mentioned in the later Vedic texts. The Digvijay section of Mahabharata places them to the east of Monghyr and associates them with the prince who ruled on the banks of the Kosi.In earlier days the Kosi used to flow through North Bengal. See Karatoya River for details The epigraphs of the Gupta period and ancient Chinese writers place Pundravardhana, land of the Pundras, in North Bengal. Mythology There is a story of Rishi Dƒ´rghatamas who begot on the queen of the Chandravanshi king Bali five sons named Anga, Vanga, Suhma, Pundra and Kalinga. They founded the five states named after them. The lands of the despised Pundra and Vangas were not only seats of powerful kings but also flourishing centres of Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism. It signifies the first stage of Aryan expansion between 5th century BC and 4th century AD.Majumdar, Dr. R.C., p. 25 Empires Ancient period Pundranagara or Paundravardhanapura, the ruins of which are located on the banks of the Karatoya in Bogra District of Bangladesh, was located in the territory of Pundravardhana. While the Pundras and their habitat were looked down upon as impure in later Vedic literature because they fell beyond the pale of Vedic culture, an inscription written in Prakrit in the BrƒÅhmƒ´ script of the 3rd century BC, found at Mahasthangarh, ancient site of Pundranagara, indicates that the area imbibed, like adjoining Magadha, many elements of Aryan culture.Majumdar, Dr. R.C., p. 27 Buddhism was introduced into North Bengal, if not other parts of Bengal, before Ashoka. Two Votive inscriptions on the railings of the Buddhist stupa at Sanchi of about the 2nd century BC records the gifts of two inhabitants of Punavadhana which undoubtedly stands for Pundravardhana.Majumdar, Dr. R.C., p. 454 The impact of Aryan-Brahmana culture was felt in Bengal much after the same spread across northern India. The various non-Aryan people then living in Bengal were powerful and thus the spread of Aryan-Brahman culture was strongly resisted and the assimilation took a long time.Roy, Niharranjan, Bangalir Itihas, Adi Parba, , first published 1972, reprint 2005, pp. 216-217, Dey‚Äôs Publishing, 13 Bankim Chatterjee Street, Kolkata, The Mauryans were the first to establish a large empire spread across ancient India, with headquarters at Pataliputra (modern Patna), which was not very far from Pundranagara. According to Ashokavadana, the Mauryan empire Ashoka issued an order to kill all the Ajivikas in Pundravardhana after a non-Buddhist there drew a picture showing the Gautama Buddha bowing at the feet of Nirgrantha Jnatiputra. Around 18,000 followers of the Ajivika sect were executed as a result of this order. The end of the Maurya rule around 185 BC was followed by a period of small kingdoms and chaos till the advent of the Guptas in the 4th century AD. Copper plates of the Gupta period mentioned their eastern division as Pundravardhana bhukti (bhukti being a territorial division). The Gupta Empire faced decline in the 6th century AD and the area may have fallen to the Tibetan king Sambatson in 567-79. Subsequently, Bengal was carved into two empires, Samatata in the east and Gauda in the west.Hossain, Md. Mosharraf, Mahasthan: Anecdote to History, 2006, pp. 69-73, Dibyaprakash, 38/2 ka Bangla Bazar, Dhaka, There is mention of Pundravardhana being part of Gauda in certain ancient records.Bandopadhyay, Rakhaldas, Bangalar Itihas, , first published 1928, revised edition 1971, vol I, p 101, Nababharat Publishers, 72 Mahatma Gandhi Road, Kolkata. It was part of Shashanka‚Äôs kingdom in the 7th century AD.Majumdar, Dr. R.C., p. 63 Decline During his visit to the area in 639-45, the Chinese monk, Xuanzang (Hiuen Tsang), did not mention any king of Pundravardhana in his itinerary records. He traveled from Kajangala to Kamarupa through Pundravardhana. Xuanzang referred to Pundravardhana as follows: : There were twenty Buddhist Monasteries and above 3,000 Brethren, by whom the ‚ÄòGreat and Little Vehicles‚Äô were followed; the Deva-Temples were 100 in number, and the followers of various sects lived pell-mell, the Digambar Nirgranthas being very numerous.Majumdar, Dr. R.C., p. 453 There are references that go to indicate that Pundravardhana lost its eminence in the 7th-8th century. Archaeological excavations at Mahasthangarh indicate the use of the citadel during the Pala period till 12th century AD but no more as a power-centre. It was part of the empire of Chandra kingsBandopadhyay, Rakhaldas, p. 181 and Bhoj Verma.Bandopadhyay, Rakhaldas, p. 230 The early Muslim rulers from 13th century onwards may have used the territory but by then it was no more important. Its identity gradually faded and it became part of the surrounding area. Even the main city or capital of Pundravardhana, Pundravardhananagar or Paundravardhanapur lost its identity and came to be known as Mahasthan. Spread of Islam At Mahasthan is located the mazhar (holy tomb) of Shah Sultan Balkhi Mahisawar, a dervish (holy person devoted to Islam) of royal lineage who came to the Mahasthan area, with the objective of spreading Islam among non-Muslim people. He defeated the local king in a war and converted the people of the area to Islam and settled there.Khokon, Leaquat Hossain, 64 Jela Bhraman, 2007, p.129, Anindya Prokash, Dhaka. Extent Pundravardhana, comprised areas of present-day Rajshahi, Bogra, Pabna (in Bangladesh), and Dinajpur (both in India and Bangladesh). According to the Damodarpur copperplate inscription of the time of Budhagupta (c 476-94 AD) the northern limit of Pundravardhana was the Himalayas. The administrative and territorial jurisdiction of Pundravardhana expanded in the Pala period. In the Pala, Chandra and Sena periods Pundravardhana included areas beyond the geographical boundaries of North Bengal. Varendri or Varendri-mandala was a metropolitan district of Pundravardhana. This is supported by several inscriptions. Varendra or Varendri finds a mention primarily from the 10th century onwards, at a time when Pundravardhana was in decline.Roy, Niharranjan, p. 116. Rakhaldas Bandyopadhyay says, ‚ÄúOnly North Bengal is not meant by Pundravardhana bhukti, what we now call East Bengal was also part of Pundravardhana or Pundravardhana bhukti. In a copper plate during the rule of Keshava Sena, son of Lakshmana Sena, i.e. in the 12th century, Pundravardhana or Pundravardhana bhukti included areas up to Bikrampur.‚ÄùBandopadhyay, Rakhaldas, p. 49 In the south Pundravardhana extended to localities in the Sundarbans.Roy, Niharranjan, p.85, The numerous waterways of the region were the main channels of transportation. However, there are references in ancient literature to some roads. Somadeva's Kathasaritsagara mentions a road from Pundravardhana to Pataliputra.

A men's chorus or male voice choir (MVC) (German: M√§nnerchor), is a choir consisting of men who sing with either a tenor or bass voice, and whose music is typically arranged into high and low tenors (1st and 2nd tenor), and high and low basses (1st and 2nd bass; or baritone and bass)‚Äîand shortened to the letters TTBB. The term can also refer to a piece of music which is performed by such a choir. Overview Male voice choirs are commonly found in the United Kingdom, particularly in Wales, Cornwall, and Yorkshire. The names of male voice choirs sometimes use the abbreviation MVC, for example Castleford MVC. Men have sung together throughout history. In the West, most music lovers will be familiar with monastic chanting such as the Gregorian chant. In addition, men have come together to make music and enjoy the fellowship of others with a similar passion. Glee clubs became popular in the United States where men would sing in harmony, usually a cappella. Russia has a long tradition of men singing in the Russian Orthodox Church. Elsewhere in the world, such as in Wales, parts of the USA and Europe, male choirs arose from the late 19th century through to present times. Male choirs (1st tenor, 2nd tenor, baritone and bass) even without trebles or boy sopranos have a slight advantage over women in that 1st tenors singing in the falsetto range of their voice can extend the range to encompass most of the range available to an SATB (soprano, alto, tenor, bass) choir. As a consequence 1st tenors sing a very different part of the chords in a piece of music, often moving above the tenor staff and using the falsetto. Arguably the most well-known male choruses are those in Wales, but there are highly skilled choirs around the world. Most male choruses today sing a wide range of music, including the traditional Welsh hymns but also choruses from opera, musical comedy and the popular genre. An unusual offshoot of the male chorus is the barbershop genre. Barbershop singing uses unique and specialised arrangements and is nearly always unaccompanied. Many of the modern Germany male choruses owe their origins to the groups which were very popular in the 19th and early 20th centuries, with some groups still singing. \\"M√§nnerchor\\" male voice choirs in Germany Male voice choirs were an innovation of the 19th century, which arose in the course of the Enlightenment or Age of Reason. Traditional values, with an increasingly patriotic stance and coupled with the social pleasures of a circle of friends stood at the centre of the movement. Older folk songs found new popularity in the first half of the 19th century (Romantic Age). A capella four-voice male voice choirs replaced the previous choral forms of a mix of male, female and children's voices. National musical education was supposed to be promoted along with the political and social Enlightenment. Carl Friedrich Zelter (1758‚Äì1832) and above all Friedrich Silcher (1789‚Äì1860) were instrumental in influencing the development of a choral life, where choirs took root with a constitution, committee and ‚Äì in the full flush of enthusiasm ‚Äì showed all the \\"bells and whistles\\" of an organisation. In Switzerland, Hans Georg N√§geli continued this movement. The choirs often gave themselves evocative names. If an enthusiast had spent a few days at the \\"golden Rhine\\", he would feel called on to found a choir on the River Weser with a name such as \\"Lorelei\\" or \\"Stolzenfels\\". Hoarse male voices called themselves \\"Harmony\\" or named their organisation \\"Concordia\\", or \\"The Warbling Nightingale\\". Such vocal enthusiasm was often bound with patriotism and love of nature. The life of such a club and the joy of singing in harmony was supposed to be especially helpful in diverting attention from a hard day's work. The musical content, after the initially more political forays, was accordingly: homeland, German forests, songs about the fruit of the grape, and of course ‚Äì love. Areas which overflow with tourists today were once serenaded as quiet, romantic spots, in songs such as : (\\"In der Drosselgass‚Äú), \\"Zu R√ºdesheim\\" and \\"Vater Rhein\\". In such songs, one would roam as a musician (\\"Spielmann\\") or hunter (\\"J√§ger\\") through the country, and one felt oneself to be as free as a gypsy. After the Second World War, the survivors found themselves back in their choirs, at first with new members, but the more the dreams of travel and romantic interludes could be actually realised with increasing wealth, the less the members had to seek the experiences about which they sang in thoughts alone. Thus began a gradual decline as the members of the great choirs aged and died and no new members replaced them. Despite this decline, there were still about 9641 male voice choirs in Germany around the year 2002 ‚Äì about 15.9% of all choral forms.

It is an obligatorily thermophilic species. The first specimens were isolated from sediments in the sea off the coast of Japan. Discovery Aeropyrum pernix was the first strictly aerobic hyperthermophilic Archaea to be discovered. It was originally isolated from heated marine sediments and venting water collected in 1996 from a solfataric vent at Kodakara-jima Island in Ky≈´sh≈´, Japan. Genome structure Its complete genome was sequenced in 1999 and is 1,669 kilobases in size, with 2,694 possible genes detected. All of the genes in the TCA cycle were found except for that of Œ±-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. In its place, the genes coding for the two subunits of 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductase were identified. Properties The cells of Aeropyrum pernix are spherical in shape and approximately 1 ¬µm in diameter. The envelope surrounding the cells of Aeropyrum is about 25 nm wide. The organisms grows at temperature between 70 and 100 ¬∞C (optimum, 90 to 95 ¬∞C), at pH 5 to 9 (optimum, pH 7), and at a salinity of 1.8 to 7% (optimum, 3.5% salinity). The growth of the organisms is not detected at 68 or 102 ¬∞C. Below 1.5% salinity, cells lyse by low osmotic shock. The cells of the organisms are sensitive to chloramphenicol and insensitive to ampicillin, vancomycin, and cycloserine.
