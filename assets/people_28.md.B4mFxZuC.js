The film is inspired by a combination of elements shared from two previous released Hollywood productions: Imitation of Life and These Three. Plot A young black woman arrives at the home of Mrs. Saunders, a widow who is black, and begs her to look after her light-skinned baby, whom she cannot afford to feed. At first she says this is temporary while she looks for work, but leaves declaring she will never be back. Mrs. Saunders pledges to raise the \\"poor little darling\\" as her own, alongside her own son Jimmie. She names her Naomi. Nine years later, schoolgirl Naomi is thought by the other black children to be aloof and they accuse the light- complexioned child of not wanting to be black. This looks true the day Naomi disappears on her way to school and Jimmie tells his mother that Naomi deliberately avoided the black school she was supposed to attend and instead went to a white school. Naomi denies Jimmie's accusation, saying he's lying because he hates girls. When Mrs. Cushinberry threatens to punish her for being insolent and mean, Naomi furiously explodes that she hates her and the other children and that she only came to the school because her mother sent her there. She spits in the teacher's face which results in Mrs. Cushinberry spanking her. That evening, Mrs. Cushinberry visits Mrs. Saunders, but when she realizes that Naomi didn't tell her mother what happened that afternoon, she decides to keep silent. But Naomi has been eavesdropping, and when the teacher leaves she starts to tell her mother that the teacher was the one at fault. Then Jimmie reveals the truth: Naomi was spanked at school for being unruly and then spitting in the teacher's face. Mrs. Saunders spanks Naomi herself. Later, Naomi starts a rumor that Mrs. Cushinberry is having an affair with a married professor; soon a riot erupts at school and a crowd of angry parents marches to the school superintendent's house to demand that he fire both teachers. When Jimmie tells Mrs. Saunders about the riot, she rushes to the superintendent's office to dispel the rumor Naomi started. Because of this, Naomi is soon sent to a convent. About 12 years later, Jimmie has earned $6,700 as a Pullman porter when he is approached by Ontrue Cowper, who tries to interest him in investing in the numbers racket. Jimmie rejects this offer, investing in a farm instead. After proposing to his sweetheart Eva, Jimmie invites his mother to live on his new farm. Naomi returns to town, reformed by her life at the convent, and apologizes to her mother for having been a bad child. When Jimmie and Naomi are reunited, the scene implies Naomi's romantic attachment towards him. Mrs. Saunders arranges to have Jimmie take Naomi to see the city. Although things go well, Eva's Aunt Carrie doesn't trust Naomi's unnatural interest in Jimmie and believes that she should be watched. Aunt Carrie‚Äôs suspicions prove to be well-founded as Naomi soon confesses her love for her adoptive brother. When Jimmie, Eva, and Naomi return to the country, Jimmie introduces Naomi to his friend, Clyde Wade, who immediately falls in love with her. Clyde is a dark-skinned African American with a country accent. Naomi finds him repulsive and confesses to Jimmie that she has always wanted him to marry her. Realizing that Eva would be crushed by the loss of Jimmie, Naomi consents to marry Clyde. One year later, Naomi tells her mother that she is leaving Clyde and her newborn son and is also ‚Äúleaving the Negro race.‚Äù A few years after that, Naomi comes back to the farm one night and silently creeps up to the window, through which she sees a happy family scene that will never include her. After getting one last look at her family, Naomi drowns herself in the river. Cast Lobby card * Jacqueline Lewis as Naomi, as a Child * Ethel Moses as Mrs. Cushinberry / Her Daughter Eva * Alice B.

It reports that original material was cut from the film after censors objected. Some of the cut scenes featured more insight on child Naomi's hatred towards black people and wanting to be white. Other footage includes adult Naomi with a white husband after she decides to pass for white (at the climax of the movie) only to be rejected by him when he finds out about her black heritage. Some of the removed footage however can still be seen in the movie's opening preview trailer. The film's script was based on a short treatment titled \\"Naomi Negress!,\\" written by Alice B. Russell, wife of director Oscar Micheaux and the actress who plays Mrs. Saunders. It is reported that the film's racial characterizations were objected to by protesters from the Young Communist Committee. Critical debates God's Step Children has both been hailed as a masterpiece and denounced as stereotypical and racially denigrating. Patrick McGilligan provides a good summary of the film's reception and of arguments over whether it favors light-skinned characters.. Protests at the time of the film's release apparently targeted scenes and dialogue in which Micheaux repeated his long-standing criticisms of the \\"race,\\" charging it with a lack of ambition and an inability to plan. As in previous Micheaux films, God's Step Children seems to repeat the very bias in favor of light-skinned blacks that the movie also tries to critique. The \\"bad\\" blacks, such as the gamblers, are dark- complexioned. Clyde, whom Naomi rejects, is also dark and speaks in a buffoonish country accent. It is difficult to reconcile the film's praise for Clyde's industriousness with this caricature, and difficult to criticize Naomi's rejection of him, though she is obviously prejudiced against him largely because of his appearance. The film does not engage current social- political issues as forcefully as earlier Micheaux movies, such as Within Our Gates or Symbol of the Unconquered, and thus it is a challenge to rank it in equal importance to those works.

It was managed by the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and operated by Quanterion Solutions Inc. under a long term DoD contract. The website is no longer available and was replaced by https://www.csiac.org/. DACS is chartered to collect, analyze, and disseminate information relating to the software domainThe software domain refers to the broadest scope of software, anything that relates to software. to the DoD Software Engineering community, which includes Defense contractors and the academic community as well. DACS serves as an information broker, identifying resources that exist within the global community and making those resources available to the community through outreach venues such as an information rich web site, technical reports, technical journals and a variety of services offered free of charge. Additionally, DACS, like all DTIC managed IACs, is a contract vehicle that serves the DoD by expediting the process for DoD components to acquire the services of commercial and academic providers to accomplish technical area tasks. DACS Mission, Charter and History=DACS Mission and Charter= The mission of DACS, like the other IACs in the DTIC IAC Program, is: DACS receives its authority to operate from the following DoD Directives and Instructions, which constitute the IAC Charter. =History=How long has DACS existed? The DACS was established in the late 1970s. The software community, at that time, recognized the need for data and information about computer software, its development process and the software technology area in general. The rapid expansion of software engineering technology and the proliferation of tools and techniques made it difficult for an individual or organization to remain cognizant of the current status of the software engineering field. This situation resulted in the duplication of efforts in software research and seriously hampered the transfer of technology from the software research environment to the user sector of the software community. Recognizing the need for an information analysis center to serve the government, industrial, and university community as a focal point for software development and experience data, in August 1978 the Rome Air Development Center (RADC), which is now called the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), contracted with IIT Research Institute (IITRI) to design such a center, named, The Data and Analysis Center for Software (DACS), that would acquire, analyze, synthesize, and disseminate information on software engineering technology. The decision was based in part on the fact that the DoD and other Federal Agencies found that the establishment of special purpose information analysis centers and technology transfer programs were effective in overcoming problems in technology implementation and diffusion of mission-oriented developments. NASA was cited as an example for demonstrating a benefit-to-cost ratio in excess of ten to one for its Technology Utilization Program. At that time the DoD had already been successful in operating Information Analysis Centers for Metals, Ceramics, Hardware Reliability, and Machineability data. What was the original purpose of the DACS? DACS initially functioned as the DoD librarian for software related topics. The objectives were to: * Encourage the diffusion of technology to DOD, Civil Agencies, Government contractors, etc. * Bring about higher levels of utilization of project results in a cost- effective manner * Increase the productivity and quality of computer software by improving the transfer of software engineering technology * Assist in diffusing new technology throughout the U. S. industrial base, thereby expanding its capability and competitive posture. * Provide scientific and technical information analysis services to DoD, Civil Agencies, government contractors, and the private sector in areas relating to software technology needs, developments and trends * Minimize duplication of effort thereby reducing costs How has DACS evolved over time? Since its inception, DACS has been operated by various Defense contractors over the years and the library, and other resources constituting the DACS collection, have migrated to each contractor in turn. The objectives are essentially the same but the terminology used to define them has evolved as the software environment has changed. The means for improving the 'transfer of software engineering technology' now centers around use of web technology to deliver information to the mass community in electronic format, organized in ways that make it easy for the community to acquire and use the information. =Why The DACS Is Notable= DTIC and the DTIC IAC program are notable. The DACS is an IAC. Some DACS products are gaining recognition.For example, the State-of-the-Art Report, Software Security Assurance, a joint product of IATAC and the DACS, is available from DTIC. Some DACS reports have been published in peer-reviewed journals and collections.Robert L.

Additional evidence of the effectiveness and outreach of DACS products and services is contained in a DTIC Success Story which describes the significance of a DACS core effort in providing value-added analysis in its synopsis and overview of a General Accounting Office (GAO) report, resulting in the subsequent use of that material by members of the defense community and software industry, as well as extending the usefulness and outreach of the original GAO report in both time and scope beyond two years. The DACS article providing the synopsis of the GAO report was published in the July 2005 issue of the DACS Software Tech News DACS Products and Services In fulfillment of its charter, DACS engages in a continuous cycle of data and information collection, analysis, and dissemination. DACS adds value for the community by the manner in which it organizes and disseminates or otherwise packages information to make it accessible to the broadest spectrum of community members. Thus collection and dissemination are tightly integrated. DACS maintains an information rich web site, produces a quarterly technical journal, and periodically, develops State-Of-The-Art Reports (SOARs) on various software engineering topics in addition to focused research such as the ROI initiative and the Gold Practice initiative. The paragraphs below provide details about specific products and services. =DACS Web Site= The primary means of dissemination is via the DACS web site. There, DACS presents information organized around the key software related research areas or topics. Each research area is further organized into content-specific subtopics and information categories. Visitors to a topic area can navigate among the categories to get the type of information desired. Information categories include (but are not limited to) literature, best practices, case studies and lessons learned, education and training resources, subject matter experts, glossaries and acronyms, blogs and other interactive venues for software topics, programs and organizations, service providers and consultants, tools, and other related resources. Subtopics provide greater coverage of the main topic as well as addressing a specific perspective, enabling the visitor to quickly navigate to the desired level of detail. Some of the research topics included on the web site are: Software Acquisition, Software Architecture, Agile Software Development, Software Best Practices, Collaborative Software Engineering, Configuration Management, From the web site registered DACS users can search DACS databases, including: * Software Engineering Bibliographic Database‚Äîwith more than 350,000 entries, representing the entire DACS collection since its inception. Searching returns bibliographic data, including where the artifact can be acquired. DACS adds to this collection on a continuing basis as resources emerge. * Software Life Cycle Empirical Database‚Äîestablished to support the acquisition, maintenance, and dissemination of software empirical life cycle data for research purposes and to support the improvement of the software development process. * DoD Acronym database‚Äîcontains nearly 30,000 acronyms that relate to software technology and programs of interest to the DoD. This database is continuously updated. * DACS ROI Dashbord‚Äîa collection of information that addresses the Return-On-Investment from Software Process Improvement. Data is collected from open literature and from collaboration with organizations involved with software process improvement such as the Software Engineering Institute. =DACS Software Tech News= DACS publishes a quarterly technical journal, called The Software Tech News, which is distributed in printed and electronic format to registered DACS subscribers free of charge and also available for viewing and download from the DACS web site. Authors are solicited for their expertise or experience relative to a chosen theme. Recent themes have included: * Future Directions in Software Engineering * Grid Computing * Net- Centric Software Architecture * Open Source * Performance Results from CMMI Based Process Improvement * Service Oriented Architecture * Software Archaeology * Software Reliability Engineering =DACS Publications= DACS periodically produces technical reports on a variety of software engineering topics. In keeping with the DACS mission, most reports are made available to the software engineering community as free PDF downloads from the DACS web site. These documents are reporting on current research in the subject and are typically authored by subject matter experts. Some recent reports include: * Modern Tools to Support DoD Software Intensive System of Systems Cost Estimation: A DACS State of the Art Report, August 2007 * A Business Case for Software Process Improvement (2007 Update): Measuring Return on Investment from Software Engineering, September 2007 =Collaborative IAC Publications= The software domain is not an isolated entity. There are many instances of overlap of software related subject matter with the domains of other IACs such as reliability, information assurance and modeling and simulation. For example, software reliability is a subtopic of the broader topic of system reliability. Software assurance is intertwined with the subject of Information Assurance. Software technology is a significant part of modeling and simulation. Because of this natural overlap, DACS has collaborated with other IACs to jointly produce the following documents: * System Reliability Toolkit: an 865-page document published in 2005, which is the result of a collaborative effort by DACS and the Reliability Information Analysis Center (RIAC), to produce a document that addresses (in addition to hardware) the software and human factors that have an ever more significant impact on system reliability. * Software Security Assurance State-of-the-Art Report (SOAR): published in July 2007, this SOAR (400 pages) was co-authored by technical experts from DACS and the Information Assurance Technology Analysis Center (IATAC). It provides an overview of the current state of the environment in which defense and national security software must operate, then surveys current and emerging activities and organizations involved in promoting various aspects of software security assurance. It also provides noteworthy trends in software security assurance as a discipline. =DACS Technical Inquiry Services= As part of its outreach to address the needs of the software community, DACS provides a technical inquiry service, wherein it provides up to four hours of research, free of charge, to address any technical inquiry from any member of the DACS community. In some cases, DACS connects the inquirer directly with a Subject Matter Expert (SME) to satisfy the request. DTIC, the organization that funds the DACS, regards the number of technical inquiries handled by DACS each month as a key performance metric for operation of the IAC. The scope of questions asked is very broad, ranging from simple questions asking for a definition of an acronym, to very complex questions. The following list contains some recent requests that convey the essence and scope of this service. * How does Agile handle turn-over in developers, vendors, etc.? My question stems from the fact that a system may be developed by one vendor, but may need to be maintained by another. * \\"I've noticed a tendency for acronyms to proliferate within DoD. Is there a DoD clearinghouse/arbitrator through whom these entries are filtered?\\" * We are implementing a new hr system - I have been tasked with proposing a model through which modifications/customizations standard ERP software can be evaluated and quantified against the objectives. Any recommendations on approach - thanks * I am looking for information on how DoD manages software development project so there is no duplication. * How does Agile implement Earned Value? * The patron is looking for, size estimates of logical source lines of code ratios for different languages. He has looked at Capers Jones but needs more information. * \\"I am trying to ferret out some very specific information about monitoring software defect trends. Again, it was years ago but I was a software development Program Manager and my team used a tool that tracked the progress of a defect find/fix rate over time. This trend was called a \\"glide slope\\". It was not a crystal ball but was reasonably illustrative in forecasting code stability and release date. I cannot locate my copy of the algorithm and have been doing an Internet search with no luck.

This saves time and resources for the government and enables awarding of a contract within a four to six week window. This IAC technical area task (TAT) service has the following characteristics which are beneficial to the government: * Access to competed single-award contracts with no Request For Proposal (RFP) process * Large and scalable delivery orders with size and scope determined by the acquirer * Long periods of performance (up to three years) - which tends to reduce the cost of procurement * Incremental funding managed by the acquirer * Collaborative work plan/statement of work (SOW)development process * Skilled program managers with established processes and procedures * Deliverables-based contracts that share scientific and technical information across the community of interest - thus supporting cost savings through reuse The efficiency of the TAT contracting process and its bypassing of a formal RFP process is premised on the business model of the DTIC IAC program. Specifically, contractors must compete for the opportunity to operate an IAC. This is a full open competition, and award is based on the capability of the contractor to perform software-aligned technical areas tasks, as well as to perform the core functions of maintaining software-focused libraries and developing a software center of excellence. When bidding on an IAC, contractors form collaborative teams to ensure the best overall coverage of the domain. Therefore, the contractor operating the DACS has already competed for the right for their team to perform TATs. The DACS contractor manages all TATs, insuring that any scientific and technical information (STI) resulting from the TAT is added to the DACS collection for dissemination in appropriate venues. When the government wishes to acquire the services of someone other than the DACS contractor, it is done as a TAT based on a subcontracting arrangement between the service provider (team member or other) and the DACS contractor. This business model gives the government a great deal of flexibility in working with DACS to acquire the services from the most qualified organizations. This is especially true in scenarios where the technical expertise needed resides within a small group in an academic institution, or a small business. TATs cover a broad spectrum of activities within the software domain. The list below is included to communicate the range and types of activities performed under TATs. * ACE program - Advanced Course in Engineering (ACE) Cyber Security Boot Camp. The mission of the ACE is to develop ROTC cadets into cyber officers ‚Äî airmen, warriors, and leaders. The ACE program was developed under a Data and Analysis Center for Software (DACS) Technical Area Task and is the only cyber education offered by the Department of Defense (DoD) for ROTC cadets. The cadets are selected from the best students at U.S. colleges and universities. ACE targets the top students in computer-related disciplines, and it teaches cadets to become original thinkers, problem solvers, and technical leaders. * Air Force NCES Tactical Experiment (ANTE) - The DISA sponsored Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) program has established an early adopters program and invited participants to enroll in a pilot project to exercise the NCES information services. The DACS is supporting AFRL/IF and the Secretary of the Air Force, Net Centric Enterprise Office, and the Warfighter Integration Office (SAF/XCISS). AFRL/IF and SAF/XCISS are sponsoring experiments that will define NCES capabilities for tactical users. The DACS, under the ANTE effort, is conducting research and development for NCES tactical users with restricted bandwidth. The ANTE effort follows a tactical scenario that illustrates an expected data flow in which a tactical warfighter needs data to complete a mission. The data flow incorporates reach back access through NCES and local access through a tactical enclave. * Net-Centric Enabled Wide Area Surveillance and Information Dissemination (Project Marti) - a Net-Centric research program funded by the Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate, Rome, NY. The DACS, in conjunction with the Boeing Phantom Works and the U.S. Air Force have demonstrated for the first time how, with advanced airborne networking and information management technology, a near-space vehicle can be used as a flexible, low-cost, theater-wide information broker that provides real-time tactical information to ground forces to enhance their effectiveness and survivability. DACS Initiatives As the software domain evolves and software technology surges, developers face significant challenges in meeting the requirements of these large complex systems of systems. DACS currently is engaged in some initiatives to provide the developers greater insight about software best practice and about improving their development process. Concurrently DACS is participating, along with the other IACs, in supporting a DTIC initiative to make more scientific and technical information available to the warfighter in electronic form. These initiatives are described in greater detail in the following sub-sections. =DACS Gold Practice Initiative= This initiative, started in 2003, is focused on providing the software acquisition and software engineering communities with detailed information about prevalent software acquisition and development best practices that may have a positive impact on program risks and ROI. DACS is conducting extensive research on each identified practice and then publishing a technical document for each practice, that contains a detailed description of the practice or practice set, including the interrelationships among practices and an extensive lists of resources relating to that practice. The documents are available for viewing and download, free of charge, from the DACS Gold Practice web site. The document also identifies relevant web sites, tools and methods, experts, training opportunities, literature, terms, practice origins and recommending origins. The initial set of practices which DACS has targeted for this initiative were first identified in the PhD dissertation of Dr. Richard Turner titled ‚ÄúImplementation of Best Practices in U.S. Department of Defense Software-Intensive System Acquisitions‚Äù. The following practices can be downloaded from the DACS Gold Practice site: * Acquisition Process Improvement * Architecture-First Approach * Assess Reuse Risks and Costs * Binary Quality Gates at the Inch Pebble Level * Commercial Specifications and Standards/Open Systems * Insure Interoperability * Formal Inspections * Formal Risk Management * Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) Approach * Integrated Product and Process Development (IPPD) * Manage Requirements * Metrics-Based Scheduling * Model Based Testing * Plan for Technology Insertion * Requirements Trade- off/Negotiation * Statistical Process Control * Track Earned Value =DACS ROI Initiative= This initiative has been ongoing since the late 1990s. Software Process Improvement (SPI) has received much attention in recent years; however, it has been very difficult to translate benefits achieved in one organization to another organization. This initiative is focused on accumulating data from SPI efforts, analyzing it, generalizing and modeling the cost benefits one can achieve from SPI efforts. In 1999 DACS produced a State of the Art Report (SOAR) titled \\"A Business Case for Software Process Improvement\\" and revised this report in 2007 to provide new insights into the details necessary to demonstrate from a business perspective the benefits of improved software management using SPI techniques. This revised SOAR examines the business implications of some more recent SPI practices, including the Capability Maturity Model for Integration (CMMI), agile development, and systems engineering. The DACS has recently implemented a new capability called the \\"ROI Dashboard¬©\\", on the DACS web site to provide updated information about return-on-investment (ROI) results. The ROI Dashboard¬© also contains updated information for practices such as inspections, reuse, and secondary benefits. It establishes a framework whereby the current methods of performing software development can be compared to any proposed improvements, graphically displaying open and publicly available data and providing standard statistical analysis of the data. =Total Electronic Migration System (TEMS)= The Total Electronic Migration System is a project funded by DTIC to support the collection of scientific and technical information held in the IAC document collections and the subsequent dissemination of that information to a restricted DoD community through a sophisticated search capability. DACS, along with the other DTIC managed Information Analysis Centers, is collaborating with the TEMS initiative, by transforming to electronic format the documents within the DACS collection (DACS library) that exist currently only in printed format and uploading them to the database created by DTIC to support the TEMS effort. In many cases, the IACs are the single holders of valuable documents developed prior to 2000. This initiative preserves them and expands their outreach. Each IAC is transforming many thousands of documents to PDF format, making them more accessible to the IAC researchers as well as the TEMS. This initiative is ongoing although many IACs are still working on scanning the backlog of documents that existed in printed form only. For further details visit the TEMS web site and review the 'About TEMS' section.

Background and personal life Peters was born on May 26, 1954, in Steinbach, Manitoba, Canada to Mennonite missionary parents. His father John Jacob Peters, was born in Russia in 1920 and emigrated as a refugee in 1926, while his mother Amanda Marie Reimer, a direct descendant of Klaas Reimer, was born in Manitoba in 1926. During the Second World War, John Peters served Canada as a voluntary conscientious objector. The family moved to Europe in 1957, where Peters schooled bilingually in Frankfurt and Basel. Following a foundation art program in Basel, he graduated from Black Forest Academy (L√∂rrach), and then attended a year of religious studies at Capernwray Hall in the United Kingdom. He subsequently volunteered with Operation Palmbranch, an African relief mission based in Bavaria, Germany. In 1974 Peters immigrated to Winnipeg, Canada where he married Beverly Guay Pauls, a Canadian he had met while studying in England; they divorced in 2001. He earned a two-year Graphic Design diploma from Red River College and a certificate in Design Management from the University of Manitoba. In 1980, Peters designed and built Solace House, an ultra-low-energy, passive solar house on a wooded acreage in Eastern Manitoba. Professional activities and affiliations In 1976 Peters co- founded the design studio Circle Design Incorporated (CIRCLE), which received more than 60 awards for design excellence and has, in particular, designed numerous Canadian postage stamps and first day of issue covers. From 1984 to 1986, Peters taught Creative Communications at Red River College. Between 1988 and 1993 he taught graphic design at the School of Art, University of Manitoba. Since the early 1990s he has been a guest lecturer on graphic design and visual communication at schools in North and South America, Asia, and Europe.

It began as a quarterly, but became a bimonthly in July 2009. The magazine is no longer published and the final issue was released in 2011. Because the magazine was written (and, presumably read) by people who consider religious belief a personal matter rather than a prerequisite of homeschooling, it might be seen as reflecting the diversity of the homeschooling community. As a specifically non-religious magazine, Secular Homeschooling discussed some topics differently from other homeschooling magazines. For example, one article discussed the particular difficulties of discussing and dealing with death for the non religious. In the article \\"The Most Difficult Subject\\", the author writes that death is, to religious families \\"less threatening as a concept, it‚Äôs also much more frequent and natural a subject of conversation and thought\\" because some of their religious beliefs focus on death (Jesus' death and resurrection, for example). The magazine occasionally ran humor as well.

He was probably from Norfolk, and his first appointments came from Robert Walpole, who placed him in the Excise Office in 1740. By 1749, Nuthall was the receiver of hackney coaches. Horace Walpole used Nuthall to get Margaret Nicoll freed to marry George Walpole in 1751, but he thought Nuthall corrupt and mistrusted him. In 1757, Nuthall married Susan, the widow of his friend Hambleton Custance. By the time of his death, he had remarried, so the mother of Nuthall's legitimate son, Robert, could be either woman. (Nuthall had two bastard children as well.) William Pitt became Nuthall's protector and sponsor in the 1750s, and his connection to the family would remain steadfast. Generally, Nuthall was employed as an intermediary or \\"ambassador\\" between various political factions and Pitt. His first service in this regard was between Pitt and Thomas Pelham on bringing down Lord Bute's government. In return for his service, Pitt obtained several offices for Nuthall, with the most telling in the long run being solicitor for the Treasury in 1765. In 1766, he formed a legal partnership with John Skirrow, and Skirrow would later be Nuthall's executor. The same year, he went through long negotiations between Pitt and Rockingham to form a new government. This so-called \\"Nuthall interval\\" (Kilburn 289) dragged out a period of Parliamentary paralysis, as no bills could move forward. Soon after this, the first investigation into his shortcomings as an attorney began, and it appeared that he had been quite sloppy in his affairs, leaving much without proper authority. His death was sudden. On 7 March 1775 his coach was attacked by a highwayman on Hounslow Heath. Nuthall returned fire on the robber, who then fled. When the coach came to Hounslow, Nuthall wrote a description of his attacker to be given to Sir John Fielding and then immediately died. After his death, auditing his accounts showed that Nuthall had been guilty of substantial malfeasance. References *Kilburn, Matthew. \\"Thomas Nuthall\\" in Matthew, H.C.G. and Brian Harrison, eds.

Being a human from the Earth, he doesn't possess galactic status and shouldn't even be eligible. However, he obtains the Prize before the mistake is found out and is allowed to keep it. That's when his adventure begins, since, not being a space- traveling creature, he has no homing instinct that can guide him back to Earth, and so the galactic lottery organizers cannot transport him home. At the same time, his removal from his home environment has caused, by the 'universal law of predation', a predatory entity to spring into existence that perpetually pursues and aims to destroy him. So Carmody is forced to be on the run, and with the help of his Prize meets several well-meaning (but usually not very competent) aliens that attempt to find where, when and which Earth he belongs on. He ends up transporting from Earth to Earth: different phases and realities of his planet, which of course, is not in the time or condition he expects it to be.

Burke The General Board of the United States Navy was an advisory body of the United States Navy, somewhat akin to a naval general staff and somewhat not. The General Board was established by general order 544, issued on March 13, 1900 by Secretary of the Navy John Davis Long. The order was officially recognized by Congress in 1916.Robert W. Neeser .

Origins  \\"The war with Spain had underlined the need for adequate staff work and the success of the War Board had pointed the way for the future. Among the most persistent advocates of a general staff for the Navy was Captain Henry C. Taylor. He had first laid plans for such a staff before Roosevelt in May 1897; now in 1900 he brought the idea once more to the attention of Secretary Long. Long, however, was reluctant to risk a fight with his entrenched bureau chiefs, hesitant about allowing the professional officers wide powers outside civilian control, and rightly dubious whether Congress could be brought to approve the scheme. Consequently he compromised, and in March 1900 created a Board, known as the General Board, which possessed no executive functions, but was to serve as a purely advisory council which was constitutionally confined to considering such problems of strategy as the Secretary of the Navy might refer to it.\\"J.

Patarin. Both are digital signature protocols. They are forms of multivariate cryptography. The security of this signature scheme is based on an NP-hard mathematical problem. To create and validate signatures, a minimal quadratic equation system must be solved. Solving equations with variables is NP-hard. While the problem is easy if is either much much larger or much much smaller than , importantly for cryptographic purposes, the problem is thought to be difficult in the average case when and are nearly equal, even when using a quantum computer. Multiple signature schemes have been devised based on multivariate equations with the goal of achieving quantum resistance. Signing and verification key A signature scheme has a signing key, which is kept private, and a verification key, which is publicly revealed. For instance, in signature schemes based on RSA the keys are both exponents. In the UOV scheme, and in every other multivariate signature scheme the keys are more complex. The mathematical problem is to solve m equations with n variables. The whole equations system is the public key. To use a mathematical problem for cryptography, it must be modified. The computing of the n variables would need a lot of resources. A standard computer isn't able to compute this in an acceptable time. Therefore, a special Trapdoor is inserted into the equations system. This trapdoor is the signing key. It consists of three parts: two affine transformations T and S and a polynomial vector \\\\acute{P}. Both transformations are used to transform elements in certain groups. T transforms y to y_1,y_2,...,y_n. The second transformation S transforms the variable vector to the valid signature. The third secret element \\\\acute{P} provides certain tools for the equations' creation. The equations are built with rules known only to the owner of the signing key. Signature creation To create a valid signature, the following equations system has to be solved : \\\\begin{align} y_1 & = f_1(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n) \\\\\\\\\\\\ y_2 & = f_2(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & ~ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ y_m & = f_m(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} Here the y = (y_1, y_2, \\\\ldots, y_m) is a given message which should be signed. The valid signature is x = (x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n). To sign a given y, the message must first be transformed to fit in the equations system. T is used to \\"split\\" the message to acceptable pieces y_1, y_2, \\\\ldots, y_m. Then the equations have to be built. Every single equation has the same form: : y_i = \\\\sum {\\\\gamma_{ijk} a_j \\\\acute{a}_k} + \\\\sum {\\\\lambda_{ijk} \\\\acute{a}_j \\\\acute{a}_k} + \\\\sum{\\\\xi_{ij} a_j} + \\\\sum{\\\\acute{\\\\xi}_{ij}\\\\acute{a}_j} + \\\\delta_i The next steps sign a given message y and the result is a valid signature x. # The coefficients, \\\\gamma_{ijk}, \\\\lambda_{ijk}, \\\\xi_{ij}, \\\\acute{\\\\xi}_{ij}, \\\\delta_i, must be chosen secretly. # The vinegar variables (\\\\acute{a}_j) are chosen randomly # The resulting linear equations system gets solved for the oil variables (a_i) The vinegar and oil variables build the pre-signature A = (a_1, \\\\ldots, a_n, \\\\acute{a}_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\acute{a}_v). Finally A gets transformed by the private transformation S to give the valid signature x = S^{-1}(A) . The system of equations becomes linear if the vinegar variables are fixed ‚Äì no oil variable is multiplied with another oil variable in the equation. Therefore, the oil variables can be computed easily using, for example, a Gaussian reduction algorithm. The signature creation is itself fast and computationally easy. Signature validation The signature is transmitted to the communication partner. Validation of the signature is performed with the help of the public key, which is an equations system. : \\\\begin{align} y_1 & = {f_1}^*(x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n) \\\\\\\\\\\\ y_2 & = {f_2}^*(x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & ~ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ y_m & = {f_m}^*(x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots,x _n ) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} This system of equations is a slightly modified version of the system needed for signature creation. It is modified so that an attacker cannot get information about the secret coefficients and the special formatting of the oil and vinegar variables. Every equation of the public key has to be solved to validate the signature. The input is the signature itself. If every result y_i is equal to the corresponding part of the original message, then the verification succeeded. Problems and advantages  A primary advantage is that the mathematical problem to be solved in the algorithm is quantum-resistant. So when a quantum computer is built that can handle enough states to break commercial signature schemes like RSA or ElGamal, the unbalanced oil and vinegar signature scheme should remain secure, as no algorithm currently exists that gives a quantum computer a great advantage in solving these multivariate systems. The second advantage is that the operations used in the equations are relatively simple. Signatures get created and validated only with addition and multiplication of \\"small\\" values, making this signature viable for low-resource hardware as found in smart cards. A disadvantage is that UOV uses very long key-lengths, with the public key involving the entire system of m equations, which can require several kilobytes. UOV is young. While some attack methods are already known, many more will certainly appear if UOV becomes widely used. It is not yet ready for commercial use because its security requires more investigation.

The film is loosely based on the song with the same title. Plot Johnny Kovacs (Jones) is a war hero who comes back home for a ten-day leave. Pursued by a woman (Shelton) who considers herself his fiance, he works with his superior officers to hide during his leave. He adopts the name Johnny O'Rourke, and finds a room at a theatrical boarding house. He becomes friends with some other boarders (including O'Connor, Ryan and Gloria Jean) and falls in love with a woman (Frazee). His friends overhear him talking to his officer on the phone. They misinterpret the conversation and conclude that he is a deserter. They push him into giving himself up and returning to duty. Confused by their behavior at first, he figures out what they are up to, and plays along. It all works out in the end. The closing song in the picture is a rousing patriotic number sung directly to the audience by the main players in the film.

He produced defined gold dollars known as Bechtler Dollars, in the early 1830s and by 1840, before the US government itself started to produce gold dollars in 1849.Coin Community: Gold Dollar Liberty Head Type 1 History. Retrieved September 9, 2006. The site of his mint is designated the Bechtler Mint Site Historic Park in North Carolina.Rutherford County Tourism Development Authority  Life  Bechtler was born in Pforzheim, Margraviate of Baden. In 1767 Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden, allowed watch manufacturing in Pforzheim and started a technical school. The latter gave ground to further educational institutions and is now the Goldschmiedeschule mit Uhrmacherschule Pforzheim (Jewelers and Watchmakers School of Pforzheim); Bechtler was trained there. Around 1820, Bechtler spotted small gold traces in Stubensand, an early household abrasive. In 1823 he requested a mining concession and tried placer mining for gold in the late triassic Stubensandstein around neighboring Sternenfels where the Stubensand was produced. The amount of gold found was not satisfactory, but Bechtler asked for a Ducal Badensian Patent for his gold washing machine in 1819. In 1829, Bechtler, his sons Augustus and Charles, and a nephew emigrated to the United States.Stevenson, William. \\"Christopher Bechtler.\\" In Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German-American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present, vol. 1, edited by Marianne S. Wokeck. German Historical Institute. Last modified December 18, 2015. In 1830 he opened a watchmaker store in Philadelphia, the site of the first United States Mint. Drawn by one of the first gold rushes in the United States, Bechtler moved to North Carolina in 1830 and established a private mint. Bechtler died in Rutherfordton, North Carolina. Bechtler and his successors' private mint in Rutherford County, North Carolina, was run from 1831 through the 1850s and produced more than a million gold coins in the period between 1831 and 1841. Bechtler's precision and the reliable gold content of his coins allowed him to prevail against other producers and to obtain a large fortune.COINS; An Honest Man And His Gold Dollar, By JED STEVENSON, NYT 12.09.93  Coinage  Bechtler's mint produced coins in three denominations: $1, $2.50, and $5, and the coins were struck in three Fineness: 20 carats, 21 carats, and 22 carats. At the time and within the limits of the existing technology, the coins were considered of honest weight.  Bechtler's Coins Today  Because of the Coinage Act of June 28, 1834, which increased the value of gold by more than 6%, Bechtler's coins today are quite scarce and consequently, command high prices when offered for sale.PCGS Coinfacts Listing of Betchler Gold Coins and Approximate Retail Price by PCGS Grade The North Carolina National Bank of Charlotte has a collection that can be viewed today.

It was an immediate follow-up to the Battle of Alegr√≠a de √Ålava, which had occurred the day before. It was a Carlist victory. Background In the aftermath of the Battle of Alegr√≠a de √Ålava on October 27, the Carlists searched the forests between Chinchetru and Alegr√≠a de √Ålava for Liberal troops who had survived the battle and were now hiding. Liberals who were discovered were executed on the spot. The Carlists captured the two pieces of artillery that had belonged to the Liberal army, along with corresponding munitions and the regimental banner of the Liberal Regiment of Africa. Manuel O'Doyle and other Liberal officers surrendered, and were executed by firing squad the next day. However, 250 Liberal troops and their officers maintained order and reached Arrieta by forced march, 3 km away from the field of battle, and they fortified themselves in the church at Arrieta. There they fought against the Carlists who pursued them all during the night. News of this action at Arrieta led Osma to the decision to send soldiers to the rescue of the troops at Arrieta the next morning, which would lead to the Battle of Venta de Echavarri. The terrain Zumalac√°rregui took advantage of his knowledge of the terrain to trick his enemy, luring the Liberals to places more suited to the guerrilla tactics of the Carlists than the maneuvers of the Isabeline regulars. The terrain of the battle was laid out as such: leaving Vitoria for the old royal road towards the East, one crosses a plain for 12 kilometers, flanked on the right or South by the foothills of the range of Andia and on the left or North by the range of San Adri√°n. The Zadorra River, coming from the East, runs close to the range of San Adri√°n. The plain slopes gently from the south to the north, and rises, almost imperceptibly, towards the east. At the end of this distance of 12 kilometers rises the height of Quilchano, to which reach from the East the hills of Dallo, thus cutting the plan in two. The left of the plain slopes towards the Zadorra while the right sinks into a 60 meter deep depression. The northern slopes of the hills of Dallo slope gently towards the Dallo while its southern slopes, rocky and devoid of any vegetation, fall precipitously towards the depression. This southern slope is where the royal road runs. At the bottom of the slope there is a breach towards the north in the hills of Dallo, there is a creek into which the Zadorra drains. There is a bridge over this creek, and on the other side (in the direction of Vitoria) can be found the place known as la venta de Echavarri ‚Äìin other words, the Inn of Echavarri, where waggoners and travelers, either on their way up or down the hills, would stop for repairs, food, and gossip. Near the inn, about a kilometer and a half away, can be found the place known as Echavarri-Urtupi√±a, and more towards the east 2 and half kilometers away, is the place known as Arrieta. Troops Osma's troops included O'Doyle's former division, which included: *2nd Queen's Regiment *First and Second Regiments of Carabiniers *Battalion of Bujalance The Liberal troops also included: *The Battalion of San Fernando *Two pieces of artillery *About 100 horsemen The Carlists counted on: *The Gu√≠as de Navarra *First, Third, Fourth, Sixth Battalions of Navarre *Second Battalion of Guip√∫zcoa *Third Battalion of √Ålava *A squadron of Navarre lancers (lanceros de Navarra) The battle Osma's troops reached the heights of Quilchano and spotted the Carlists in oblique formation in the depression near Arrieta. It was two o‚Äôclock in the afternoon. Zumalacarregui knew that Osma wished to release the Liberal troops trapped in Arrieta, and therefore masked the place, formed his men, and addressed his men ‚Äìto which they responded with A ellos! A ellos! (\\"At'em! At'em!\\") Osma moved his troops. Two battalions of carabineers with their squadron of cavalry and a company of the Battalion of Bujalance descended into the valley. Once they crossed the bridge, the First Battalion of Carabineers under Mart√≠n Iriarte, and a company of mountain troops from the Battalion of Bujalance ascended to the nearest hills of Dallo, creating the Isabeline left flank. The Second Battalion of Carabineers and a squadron of cavalry remained at the bottom of the valley, forming the Isabeline right flank. On the peak that rose above the inn, on the west to the opening that empties into the Zadorra were stationed half of the Queen‚Äôs Second Battalion and at the entrance to this opening were stationed a 50 members of the cavalry company of the Bujalance. On the slope, as a reserve there remained the other half of the Queen‚Äôs Second Battalion with 50 cavalrymen, the Battalion of Salamanca, and the rest of the Bujalance Battalion. The Battalion of San Fernando remained near the height of the depression, to the right. Two eight- pounders were placed on the slope near the bridge. The Isabeline formation was defensively arranged, without a center, contrary to its goal of advancing towards Arrieta. Osma believed that Zumalac√°rregui, victorious after the Battle of Alegr√≠a de Alava, would attack the Liberals, advancing through the depression. The Liberal plan was to allow the Carlists to attack and then bombard them with artillery, and the Liberals in the valley would then pursue the Carlists until Arrieta. Zumalac√°rregui, understanding the intentions of the Liberal troops, and knowledgeable of the terrain, advanced his troops across the valley but before they were in reach of the Liberal artillery, he sent the majority of his troops rapidly towards the north and up the hills of Dallo. Once at the top, the Carlists were able to advance rapidly since the slopes of the Dallo on the north sloped gently, and approached the Isabeline troops on the hilltop. Osma had stationed few troops there, and seems to have been lacking in knowledge of the terrain, believing that the north face of the hills had the same formation as those of the south, and that the Isabeline troops would be able to defend themselves easily there against a numerically superior foe, as if behind an actual wall. But the Isabelines on the hilltops were not able to withstand the attack of the Carlist First and Third Battalions of Navarre, and abandoned their positions, descending towards the bridge. The Carlists, occupying the crests, continued to advance by the northern slopes, and reached the opening and advanced towards the bridge. Osma, on the hilltop, did not have a clear view of what was happening on his left flank, but on seeing his troops descend from the hilltops, sent as reinforcements to the bridge his reserve the rest of the Bujalance Battalion and half of the Queen's Battalion. But the Carlists troops were also arriving by the royal road to the same spot. With a battalion of Gu√≠as de Navarra at the Carlist vanguard, the Carlists crossed the bridge and assaulted the hilltop above the Inn of Echavarri, defended by half of the Queen‚Äôs Second Battalion. Once the Isabeline troops of the right flank formed at the depression had joined combat, the left flank was surrounded by the Carlists and had begun to scatter. \\"Disregarding the enemy‚Äôs fire, the Carlists advanced, and the guides [Gu√≠as de Navarra] having passed a bridge at the distance of half a musket-shot, the Liberals' left was turned.\\" The right flank also began to break formation and scatter, escaping out of the depression, and suffering casualties inflicted by the Carlists. It seemed that a massacre like the one that had occurred at Alegr√≠a de √Ålava would occur, but Zumalac√°rregui ordered his troops to give quarter to those who surrendered. The battle had lasted barely an hour. The Carlists cleared the hill, and when the battle was over, a pursuit began, and along the royal road, the Liberals fled in complete disorder and were pursued to the very gates of Vitoria- Gasteiz. The Carlists captured 3,000 muskets as spoils of war. Aftermath Osma, in his account of the battle to Isabel II, placed all of the blame on his troops, stating that \\"...all of the spots were abandoned [by the troops] without resistance, not heeding my own example to hold these spots nor stop from fleeing in a most humiliating fashion, and confirming what I have said to Your Majesty that everything is now lost, for all honor is lost...\\" Iriarte, however, who was one of Osma's officers, and who had participated in the battle, would criticize Osma for his actions during the battle, and it was concluded that Osma should have occupied the town of Echavarri-Urtupi√±a, converting it into a miniature stronghold with the two Liberal cannons. This would have allowed the Liberal troops at Arrieta to escape safely. The Liberal troops trapped at Arrieta meanwhile had seen the whole battle from the churchtower. Fog descended upon the town and at midnight, with bayonets fixed, killed the few Carlists who had attempted to stop their escape. They reached Maetzu, where there was an Isabeline force. On November 1, 1834, they reached Vitoria without incident. The Liberal Army was in disarray, and the Liberal troops at Pamplona barely had firewood with which to cook their meals. The two Liberal divisions of Navarre retired to the Puentelarreina‚ÄìPamplona Line, giving Zumalac√°rregui a golden opportunity to launch an attack on the rich zones of Navarre. The Carlist general would advance through Los Arcos, Sesma, Miranda de Arga, Peralta, Villafranca, crossing the Arga and Arag√≥n Rivers and near the monastery of La Oliva and Sanguesa returned to the Pyrenees, crossing the Arga again north of Pamplona, finally stationing himself at La Berrueza. He would return with a number of supplies, clothes, money, and new troops. The morale of the Carlists was very high, and they decided to fight the Liberal troops in a formal battle (rather than with guerrilla tactics). This would happen on December 14, 1834, at the Battle of Mendaza ‚Äìwhich would be a Carlist defeat.  References Sources *Joaqu√≠n de Osma y Tricio. Archivo familiar.

Open in the summer, the Captain John Wilson House is now a historic house museum, and the Chandlery houses displays about the town's maritime heritage. They were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Description The two buildings are located in Cohasset's downtown village area, on the north side of Elm Street near its junction with Main Street. They share a single lot, fronted by a garden and picket fence, with exposed ledge rising to the rear. =Wilson House= The Wilson House is a 2-1/2 story wood frame building, four bays wide, with a side gable roof, end chimneys, and clapboard siding. It has Federal period styling, including a front entry surround with pilasters and a dentillated cornice. A shingled shed-roof addition (c. 1830) extends to the rear, giving the house a saltbox profile. The interior is organized with a three-bay main room on the right, and a single-bay unfinished space on the left. A large fireplace projects into the main chamber, with a narrow staircase behind it providing access to the second floor. The house was built about 1810 by David Nicholas, a local housewright, during a minor building boom, and was soon afterward sold to Captain John Wilson. Wilson supposedly operated a chandlery in the house, in addition to his career operating ships out of Cohasset Harbor. The house remained in the Wilson family until 1912, and was then adapted for commercial uses. In 1936 it was given to the Cohasset Historical Society. =Bates Ship Chandlery= The chandlery, located east of the house, is a two-story frame structure, with a hip roof and clapboard siding. The building was originally located opposite Bates Wharf on the waterfront, and was moved to its present location in 1957. It was built in 1754, and is the best-preserved remnant of Cohasset's early maritime history.

Hagerty House is a historic house at 357 Atlantic Avenue in Cohasset, Massachusetts. Built in 1938, it was the first building in the United States commissioned from Bauhaus architect Walter Gropius, who collaborated with Marcel Breuer on its design. It is one of the nation's early examples of International Style architecture, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. Description and history The Hagerty House is set on a point of land overlooking Massachusetts Bay on the north shore of Cohasset, west of Sandy Beach. The house is set near the rocky coastline, on a foundation made of locally gathered fieldstone. Parts of the house are supported by lally columns. The house is an L-shaped structure, with a horizontal (roughly north-south) single-story section and a three-story section extending west (inland) below its left end. The exterior is finished in vertical board siding, interspersed with floor-to-ceiling plate glass windows, and bands of windows set to maximize ocean views. A sundeck projects further to the south. The building has undergone a number of minor alterations, primarily in response to the harsh conditions imposed on the original materials used. Windows have been replaced, retaining the basic plan and intent, and stone used in the chimneys, foundations, and retaining walls has been repointed using salt-resistant cement. The house was built in 1938, and was the first commissioned design of Walter Gropius in the United States (his first US design was his own house in Lincoln, Massachusetts). It was commissioned by John Hagerty, a student of his at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, as a home for his mother, and was completed in collaboration with Marcel Breuer. Like his own house, Gropius emphasized simple lines and the use of native materials (wood and local stone) in its construction.

The Ome Henk CDs consist of stories which depend on dialogue and sound effects, and songs, some of which are parodies. Ome Henk is a character created and performed by actor Frank van der Plas (born 20 May 1960, Amsterdam). He is portrayed as a cranky, unemployed, and often aggressive old man living in the fictitious town of Biggeveen, which is full of other obnoxious, feeble-minded and otherwise extraordinary characters. The stories on the Ome Henk CDs highlight these various personalities and build up to many painful and embarrassing situations. The sketches have an absurd, caricatural character, and traditionally end with an explosion. Ome Henk's songs are about daily nuisances and other topics of interest to a grouchy old man. They're built upon (sometimes spoken) couplets and refrains and often feature a lively crowd, cheering and singing along. This makes the songs very suitable for apr√®s-ski and carnival parties. While his music and sketches form the most important part of his body of work, Ome Henk and his neighbors also appear in cartoons drawn by cartoonist Eric Schreurs and in live comedic sketches. His most well-known song is \\"Opblaaskrokodil\\" (\\"Inflatable crocodile\\").

The original were donated by oil man and investor Don Harrington on December 25, 1945. In 1994, Sybil Harrington, Don Harrington's wife, donated the money to refurbish the camp with repaving the roads, refurbishing the health lodge, a new quartermaster building, and building the new Cub Scout World. Geography Camp Don Harrington is located in the western Palo Duro Canyon system on the Prairie Dog Town Fork Red River, south of Amarillo, Texas and northeast of Canyon, Texas with an elevation of above sea level. It has a semi-arid temperate steppe climate, with the average summer high temperature in the high 90s and average winter low temperature in the low 20s. The average yearly rainfall is 19.6 inches. The majority of camp sites and facilities are located inside the canyon. It is more rugged and forested than the surrounding prairie, creating a more desirable camping experience. A variety of plant and wildlife exist in the camp. The canyon floor is spotted with yucca, mesquite, cactus, and other prairie grasses and shrubs. Closer to the river, one can find larger trees and even a bamboo stand. Wildlife in the camp include coyotes, deer, prairie dogs, rattlesnakes (no bites reported in many years), and a wide array of insects. Facilities and Programs Camp Don Harrington has 18 permanent campsites available year-round, each with a cleared area, a fire ring, running water (except during winter months) and a latrine. An earth-fill dam has been erected on the river forming a small pond suitable for fishing, boating and canoeing. Permanent structures include a dining hall with kitchen, swimming pools, first aid station, administrative building, quartermasters shed, trading post, Campmaster's quarters (with 2 bedrooms, kitchen, full bath, and living room) and ranger's house. The camp has an archery range, rifle range, shotgun range, and an council ring. A COPE area includes a ropes course and a climbing wall with a zip line. A newer addition is a four element \\"Cub World\\" with a pirate ship, fort, castle, and tee-pee. The Camp is used for weekend camping by nearby units.

These agreements generally fall into one of four categories (or a combination of the categories): risk agreements, concessions, production sharing agreements (PSAs, also known as production sharing contracts, PSCs) and service contracts. Traditional concession agreements pre-1940 were granted for large areas, sometimes the whole country e.g. Iraq. Those grants were for long term (50 to 99 years). The IOC had full discretion and control to explore and whether or not to develop a particular field. This caused developments to be delayed, postponed or the expected investment did not immediately materialise. This was clear against host governments interest. The contracts did not foreseen any relinquishment of non explored areas. Further more traditional concession agreements granted petroleum \\"in situ\\" to the IOC, with market and pricing powers. The royalties were flat or fixed for per unity rates and sometimes credited against income taxes. There were no or low signature bonus and sometimes no income taxation. Those terms were often \\"frozen\\" for the life of the agreement. After the Second World War host governments relocated economic rents with the aim of increasing passive profit sharing.

The structure of the maps consists of an internal continent with historical place names, an internal sea with place names connected to descriptions of Taoist immortality, an external continent, and an external sea.Oh Sang-Hak, p.1 Surprisingly, the maps did not reflect the highest levels of geographic knowledge available to Koreans, but this is not likely to be intentional.Suarez, Thomas.

Similarly, European mapmakers of the day often treated Korea as an island. Some scholars have attributed the development of Korean circular world maps to Western influence, such as the maps of Matteo Ricci (Kunyu Wanguo Quantu) or the maps of Giulio Aleni (Wanguo Quantu).

Technical director and chief designer Smith- Clarke was fully occupied with a new factory to make Alvis's Gnome-Rhone radial engines so the 12/70 was designed by George Lanchester and it proved to be his last automobile design.Lanchester Motorcars, A History by Anthony Bird and Francis Hutton-Stott, Montagu Motor Book, Cassell, London 1965 Specification=Engine and gearbox= Alvis manufactured the four- cylinder 1,842 cc pushrod overhead valve engine which was similar to the engine of the Alvis Firebird but was, in fact, a new design. Its was enough to propel the car to a top speed of about . Alvis also designed and made the four-speed gearbox which had synchromesh on the top three speeds. =Steering brakes and suspension= Cam steering is by Marles and brakes by Bendix- Cowdrey. Suspension is by half-elliptic springs, those in the back are underslung, dampened by hydraulic shock absorbers. There is an easy jacking system. =Body= The standard catalogued four-door four-seater saloon or two-door four-seater drophead coup√© bodywork was made for Alvis by Mulliners of Birmingham. It was described by a motoring correspondent of The Times as follows: The four-door body has four sidewindows and makes a comfortable four-seater; the doors have roll armrests and ashtrays and there is a central pull-down rest. The rear windows are \\"carried well back and allow a very fair view\\". The doors have slip pockets and glass louvres that conform to the body's lines. There is a cupboard in the instrument panel and the instruments and ashtray are centrally placed. There are two-way visors, independent wiper controls (left and right), a spring steering wheel and in its centre ignition, dip and switch (headlights), signalling and horn controls. There are ventilators in the scuttle, a sliding roof and a fully opening windscreen. The front seats are adjustable, the backrests will tip up and beneath them there are floor wells for the feet of the back passengers. A stabilising bumper and two horns are fitted at the front. The whole of the back panel of the car was hinged at the bottom carrying the spare wheel on its inner side and it could be made to open just past the vertical.

It was now easier to get into the back seat and all four seats had been redesigned to give better support. The spare wheel was moved outside the car and enclosed in a metal cover.

Overview and history The Exercise is Medicine (EIM) initiative calls for physical activity to be included as a standard part of medical treatment and the patient care process. EIM urges healthcare providers to assess the physical activity levels of their patients at every visit, provide physically inactive patients with brief counseling, and 'write' a basic exercise prescription. Before leaving the clinic setting, inactive patients should also receive a referral to available physical activity resources in the community to assist with becoming more physically active. EIM was started by American College of Sports Medicine President Robert E. Sallis, MD, FACSM in 2007, who has continued to serve as the chair of the EIM initiative since its inception. Under the guidance of Dr. Sallis and the EIM advisory board, Adrian Hutber, PhD, served as the first vice president and has overseen the global development of the initiative over its first decade of existence. From 2007-2017, EIM grew into a \\"global health\\" initiative with a presence in more than 40 countries worldwide. The initial five years of the initiative focused on increasing global awareness that \\"exercise is good medicine\\". More recently, efforts have shifted toward the strategic implementation of the EIM Solution in healthcare systems. Implementation The Exercise is Medicine Solution is the practical implementation of EIM in a health system. The EIM Solution is designed as a simple, brief four-step process that can be carried in the clinic setting in under five minutes by the entire healthcare team. 1\\\\. The first step, and initiator, of the EIM Solution is the systematic assessment of every patient's physical activity levels. The Physical Activity Vital Sign is an evidence- and practice-based tool consisting of two questions to determine whether the patient is meeting the established physical activity guidelines. This tool for assessing patient physical activity levels has been successfully integrated into several health care systems including the Kaiser Permanente health systems of Northern and Southern California, as well as in Intermountain Health. 2\\\\. The second step is to provide brief advice or counseling regarding the importance of regular physical activity, specifically relevant to that patient's medical history and situation. Several physical activity counseling models have been shown to be effective in increasing patient physical activity levels including the \\"5As\\" (Ask, Advise, Agree, Assist, Arrange), motivational interviewing, and the use of the transtheoretical model. 3\\\\. The third step of the EIM Solution is to provide eligible patients (i.e., patients who are not completing 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous aerobic activity in a week) with a basic physical activity prescription, depending on the health, fitness level and preferences of the patient. Prescriptions can be given out in a number of different formats including exercise prescriptions entered into the electronic health record and provided to the patient in the after visit summary paperwork or a pad (a format patients are familiar with in receiving prescriptions for medications). The first major exercise prescription program was the Green Prescription started by the Sport and Recreation New Zealand in 1998. 4\\\\. The final, and perhaps most crucial, component of the EIM Solution is ensuring that all eligible patients receive a physical activity referral to supportive resources to assist them in engaging in greater physical activity levels. Patients may be referred to existing physical activity resources within a health system (i.e., wellness programs, cardiac rehabilitation programs, physical therapy), self-directed programs (i.e., walking programs, smartphone apps), or community-based resources. Within the community setting, all physical activity places (i.e., YMCA centers, Jewish Community Centers, other community fitness centers), and exercise professionals should be considered for inclusion in a physical activity network. EIM supporters Numerous health and professional organizations have signed as partners with the Exercise is Medicine initiative including: the American Association of Nurse Practitioners, the American Council on Exercise, the American Physical Therapy Association, the Foundation for Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, the Medical Fitness Association, and the Preventive Cardiovascular Nurses Association. The EIM Global Health Network Over its first decade of existence, EIM has expanded to include partners in more than 40 countries. The EIM Global Health Network consists of EIM Regional Centers in Chile (EIM Latin America), Germany (EIM Europe), and Singapore (EIM Southeast Asia) that help oversee the expansion and development of the initiative in their respective regions. To establish an EIM National Center, national leaders in a country are required to enlist the support of a national primary care organization, a national sports medicine and/or exercise science organization, as well as a leading academic institution. It is also strongly encouraged that the national ministry of health is invited to participate as a part of the National Center. The National Center is hosted by a national institution (an academic institution, health organization, or other non-profit organization) under the direction of a National Center Director, acting on behalf of the National Center Advisory Board.

Prior to forming Perkins Eastman, Perkins was the Managing Partner of the New York City and Washington, D.C. offices of Perkins and Will (aka Perkins + Will) and the New York City, Toronto, Houston, and Caracas offices of Llewelyn Davies International. He is the son of Lawrence Perkins, FAIA, co-founder of Perkins + Will, and the grandson of Dwight H. Perkins, FAIA, founder of Perkins Fellows & Hamilton.  Early life and education  Brad Perkins was born on January 13, 1943, in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Lawrence B. Perkins, Sr., FAIA (1907-1997) and Margery Isabella Blair Perkins (1907-1981), and was raised in the nearby suburb of Evanston, IL. Perkins attended Cornell University where he studied architecture, ancient history, and eventually graduated magna cum laude with a degree in Latin American History in 1967. Afterward Perkins enrolled in Stanford University where he received his MBA, in 1969.  Early career  While studying at Stanford and in the ensuing years following graduation, Perkins worked as a management consultant for clients in the architecture and construction industries, including the American Institute of Architects (AIA). He also served as the President of Omnidata Services, a computer software and service bureau based in New York City, from 1972-1973. In 1973 Perkins joined the London-based architecture and planning firm Llewelyn Davies as the firm's Managing Partner of the New York, Toronto, Houston and Caracas offices, a post he held until 1977. From 1976-77 he also served as the Managing Partner of the joint venture firm Llewelyn-Davies Davis Brody. During his time at Llewelyn Davies, Perkins worked on various projects including the master plan for the American University of Beirut; master plans for town-scale projects in Ontario, Trinidad, Iran, Egypt, and several U.S. states; the new headquarters for the ARCO Chemical Company (formerly part of the Atlantic Richfield Company); an expansion of Corning Glass Work's headquarters; and New York City's bid to host the 1984 Summer Olympics. During this time Perkins also served as a faculty member of City College of New York (CCNY) and was a regular contributor for Architectural Record.Further, during this time Perkins completed his coursework that he began at Cornell towards earning his B.Arch at CCNY and received his architectural license. In 1977 Perkins joined Perkins + Will as a Senior Vice President and Managing Partner of the firm's offices in the Eastern U.S. (White Plains, New York, and Washington, DC). He directed a wide variety of projects, including a multi-year study for HUD to determine the modernization needs and priorities of the national public housing stock, in addition to many architectural, planning, and research assignments both in the U.S. and overseas,  Perkins Eastman  In 1981 Perkins left Perkins + Will to establish his own practice, Attia & Perkins, with Eli Attia. The firm carried out a variety of projects including the new NYC headquarters for Republic National Bank on Fifth Ave. (today the New York HQ of HSBC), Canterbury Green in Stamford, CT, and several other large developments. At the end of 1983, Perkins bought out Attia's interest in the firm and reorganized the practice as Bradford Perkins and Associates. The firm's name changed again, in 1985, to Perkins Geddis Eastman, when Barbara Geddis and Mary-Jean Eastman became partners. One of the more notable projects at this time was a Victorian-style \\"mutual housing\\" complex, comprising 70 one- to three-bedroom residential units, in Stamford, CT. By 1988 the firm had approximately 50 employees and was becoming well known for being \\"liberal in its use of flexible work flexible work schedules and parental leaves.\\" In 1991, Geddis stepped down at which point the firm became Perkins Eastman. Perkins Eastman began a period of rapid growth starting in 1994, beginning with the opening of its first regional office, in Pittsburgh, PA, and eventually growing to about 700 employees by 2007. During this period, Perkins remained Chairman and CEO yet still oversaw a number of projects. Among those where Perkins served as Principal-in-charge include the Manhattan campus of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, the TKTS Booth in Times Square, the comprehensive master plan for Hanoi, Vietnam, the national headquarters and testing center for Consumers Union, and dozens of senior living and multi-family residential projects. By 2015, Perkins Eastman had become the largest architecture practice in the New York City area (ranked by number of architects) and the 16th largest in the world (ranked by previous year's revenues).  Academics and publications  Perkins regularly lectures at institutions like Harvard University, Columbia University, Princeton University, University of Southern California, Texas A&M;, and Cornell University. He has served as a faculty member of the College of Architecture at the City College of New York and currently works with the architectural doctoral program at the University of Hawaii. Additionally, Perkins currently serves on the faculty of Cornell's College of Architecture, Art and Planning. He frequently speaks at associations like the American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging (now LeadingAge), National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials, Health Care Symposium, American Hospital Association, Hospitality Design Conference, International Conference on Intelligent Office Building Design, and various chapters of the American Institute of Architects (AIA).

The Castra Nova, or \\"new fort\\", was one of two cavalry forts that provided a base in Rome for the mounted bodyguard of the Roman emperors (the Equites singulares Augusti).

The full name of the fort is Castra nova Equitum singularium Augusti.  History  The fort can be precisely dated to AD 193, at the beginning of the reign of Septimius Severus. The new camp was necessitated by this emperor's increase of the size of his cavalry guard from 1,500 to 2,000 men.Coulston, J. 2000. ‚ÄòArmed and belted men: the soldiery in imperial Rome‚Äô, in J.

Josi had obtained permission to explore the area of the basilica‚Äôs nave in advance of the construction of a new reinforced concrete floor. Within days it became clear that the remains of the Castra Nova existed in good condition just below the floor level and that the excavation was including a large part of the principia (headquarters) building. The completed excavations were then published by Colini.Colini, A. M. 1944. ‚ÄòStoria e Topografia del Celio nell‚Äôantichit√†‚Äô (APA (3rdseries) 7). Vatican: Tipografia Poliglotta Vaticana. A large two-storey storage building and two barracks were also uncovered, but the greatest interest centered around the principia as its two strong rooms were very well preserved as were several office rooms. On the completion of the investigation the remains were preserved beneath the basilica (along with the remains of the Constantinian cathedral and a Neronian domus) in a spectacular underground archaeological park.The remains are under the custodianship of the Vatican Archaeological Service and are only open to the public on request.  The curatores inscriptions  Ionic capital carrying the two inscriptions from the curatores. On August 13, 1934, an ionic capital was uncovered within one of the headquarters rooms (room ‚ÄúŒµ‚Äù on plan above), lying beside a short granite column that was still set into the floor. Upon the capital two inscriptions had been carved on behalf of an association of curatores, soldiers who were the grooms for the garrison horses. The first text was dedicated in 197 ADAE 1935.156 = 1954.83 = 1968.8b. on 1 January in the consulship of Rufinus and Lateranus. The Equites were known to have served at the Battle of Lyon on the 19th of February, though evidently these men did not. The inscription records the dedication of the schola curatorum to Minerva Augusta, indicating that the collegium curatorum itself had only recently become in possession of an official meeting room that they could consecrate. The second inscriptionAE 1935.157 = 1954.83. was dedicated in 203 AD ob reditum ab expeditione felicissima in urvem sacram i.e. on the return of the guards to Rome following their escorting of the imperial family. The expeditione felicissima may refer to the entire series of events since the equites singulares Augusti left Rome in AD 197.It is probable, however, that detachments of the singulares Augusti did return to Rome several times between AD 197 and the return of the emperor in AD 203. For example see CIL 6.225 = 30730 dedicated by a turma in AD 200 pro reditus eorum ab expeditione Parthica. That the guard followed the emperor wherever he was is certain. The toppling of the capital furthermore provided historical evidence attesting to the destruction of the Castra Nova by Constantine‚Äôs forces and providing a terminus ante quem for both the dissolution of the collegium as well as for the camp itself.

To the north-east of the lighthouse is the city of Skan√∂r-Falsterbo, to the south-east of the lighthouse are some of the finest sandy beaches in Sweden and surrounding the lighthouse is the golf course of the Falsterbo Golf Club.  History  The sea route past the Falsterbo Headland has always been dangerous, because of the moving sand banks hidden under the sea. In 1230 the Dominikans from L√ºbeck sent a letter to the Danish king Valdemar with a request that a \\"mark\\" should be built to warn seafarers. There is no evidence that it was ever built. Most likely is that a prominent house at Falsterbo and The Church of Santa Maria were used as seamarks. In 1636, a lever light known as a \\"swape\\" light was built nearby at Kolabacken. An iron basket full of burning coal was hoisted up and down by a balanced bar, hence the light was moving and easier to detect. The coal fire was intensely red and could not be mistaken for a star or ship lantern. The remains of the beacon are still visible as a small hillock of ashes and coal, \\"Coal Hill\\" (). Towards the end of the 18th century the lever light was moved to the site of the present lighthouse, closer to the new shoreline. The lighthouse was built in 1793-96 and the \\"light\\" was a coal fire at the top. In 1842-43 the uppermost crenellated parts were replaced with the present lantern. Coal was replaced with rapeseed oil. The oil was very inflammable and the lighthouse keepers had to watch the lamp all night. To make a periodic light; a screen was moved around the lantern by heavy weights. Around 1850 a house for the keeper was built next to the lighthouse. At the end of the 19th century another house was built for the assistants to the lighthouse keeper. Also when the oil was replaced with paraffin and, later gas, the screen still had to be moved around. When electric light was installed in 1935 the screen was removed and so were most of the staff. Only one lighthouse keeper remained. In 1972 the lighthouse was automated and the last keeper retired. The lighthouse is high and broad. Nowadays it has no importance as a navigation mark and therefore the light is not very strong (ca. 4000 candela). It was totally turned off 1990-93. The interval of the light is intermittent: 4 seconds on, 1 second off, repeated.  Present activities  Even though the lighthouse is managing itself nowadays, there are still many activities around it. Falsterbo is one of twenty synoptic weather stations in Sweden still manned. Every three hours weather data (wind, temperature, air pressure, visibility, cloud cover etc.) are reported to the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute. In earlier days the weather observations were carried out by the lighthouse keepers. The lighthouse garden is the ringing site of the Falsterbo Bird Observatory. Falsterbo is a premier site in Europe to watch autumn bird migration. Several millions of birds pass every autumn en route to wintering areas in Africa or southern Europe. Annually, about 25,000 small birds are trapped and ringed. Every year on the last Sunday of August it is \\"Lighthouse Day\\". Then the lighthouse is open to the public. Visitors are shown not only the lighthouse itself but also bird ringing and the weather station.

In 2014, Ofsted rated the school as Good with Outstanding features and the Sixth Form as Outstanding. The Sixth Form is also in the top 10% of Sixth Forms nationally. The school was also judged by the Department for Children, Schools and Families to be one of the Top 200 Most Improved Schools in England 2009. The school has a very active Performing Arts enrichment programme which includes many Community Arts Events. An annual Arts Festival is held each July. The school's new buildings had their official opening in May 2015. Significant Changes The school began as a Secondary School for 300 pupils on 14 April 1964. The land cost ¬£4,250 for 3.5 acres and the building was ¬£215,608 work commencing on 13 May 1963. The official opening was performed by Bishop Edward Ellis on Tuesday 4 May 1965 followed by a reception by the Lord Mayor of Leicester, Alderman Kimberlin, OBE, one of the founding school governors. The school's first Headteacher was Mr John Mulroy with Deputy Mr P Connolly. Mr Edward Brennan succeeded as Headmaster in 1966 and subsequent Heads have been Mr David McLean in 1983, Mrs Catherine Fields (Principal) 2002 and Mr Marius Carney 2007. The school became a comprehensive school in 1976 and a new building costing ¬£300,000 was erected to facilitate expansion and the opening of the Sixth Form. This building was dedicated and blessed by Bishop McGuiness on Thursday 5 October 1978 assisted by Canon McReavy, Chair of Governors and Mr Brennan the Headmaster. The Chapel of the Holy Family, a fine basilical structure, was built in 1996 in memory of Sister Anna Sheils. The Chapel is very much the heart of the school and is dedicated to the Holy Family. Mass is celebrated weekly and Morning Prayer held each morning in the Chapel. The Blessed Sacrament is reserved. The Chapel contains two stained glass windows one of the St John the Evangelist and the other The Annunciation. Both originally belonged to the congregation of the Sisters of St Joseph of Peace in Nottingham and were given by the sisters to Fr John Joe Maloney for the school. The Annunciation window is a memorial to Bishop Edward Bagshawe, the third Bishop of Nottingham (1874‚Äì1902). The Chapel also contains a pipe organ by Wells Kennedy organ builders of Lisburn. In 2013 the school began a major rebuilding programme which involved the construction of new classrooms and a Library; a Sports Centre (including a professional astro turf Hockey pitch); a Sixth Form block and St Cecilia Performing Arts Centre. The buildings ‚Äì costing ¬£15m ‚Äì were blessed by Bishop Alan Williams (Bishop of Brentwood) on the feast of the English Martyrs‚Äô 2015, the fiftieth anniversary of the dedication of the school. Each building is dedicated to a particular saint: *St Jean Baptiste (Patron of teachers of youth) *St Thomas Aquinas (Patron of students) *St Cecilia (Patron of Music and Arts) *St Sebastian (Patron of Sport) St Mary of the Meadows. This dedication to Our Lady reminds us of the dedication of Leicester Abbey (dissolved in the reformation) which is a couple of miles from the school. The abbey was called Sancta Maria de Pratis (Our Lady of the Meadows). Tiles excavated by archaeologists from the floor of the abbey church were given to the school by Leicester University in 2015 and are displayed in the Library. This room also contains a crucifix blessed by Bishop McGuiness when he opened the Sixth form in 1978 and a Christus given by Blessed Sacrament Church from the former home of the Blessed Sacrament fathers. To mark the School‚Äôs Golden Jubilee and the opening of the new buildings the school commissioned a series of art works. These are, a bronze Crucifix erected at the entrance to the school by the Welsh artist, Helen Sinclair; an Icon of the Virgin Hodegetria by Aidan Hart; (card included) a cut slate plaque of the school motto ‚ÄúUt omnes unum sint‚Äù by Lida Cordoza (Kindersley Cordoza Workshop, Cambridge); a choral setting of the school Prayer ‚ÄúLord Jesus Christ make me a better person‚Äù by composer Simon Lole for the school‚Äôs Schola Cantorum and a new two manual and pedal 16 rank pipe organ, built for the auditorium by Leicestershire Organ builder, Peter Collins. The school is now a thriving, highly successful school of 1100 students aged 11‚Äì19. The student body is drawn from the west side of Leicester serving nine parishes. Currently 85% of the school are Roman Catholic students. The school has a specialism in the Performing Arts with a strong focus on Music, especially Music for the liturgy. Academically the school is highly successful with English Martyrs past pupils playing a leading role in society within Leicester and around the world.

As a meta-discipline of engineering, humanitarian engineering combines multiple engineering disciplines in order to address many of the world's crises and humanitarian emergencies, especially to improve the well- being of marginalized populations. Definition Encyclopedia Brittanica defines Humanitarian engineering as: > Humanitarian engineering, the application of engineering to improving the > well-being of marginalized people and disadvantaged communities, usually in > the developing world. Humanitarian engineering typically focuses on programs > that are affordable, sustainable, and based on local resources. Projects are > typically community-driven and cross-disciplinary, and they focus on finding > simple solutions to basic needs (such as close access to clean water; > adequate heat, shelter, and sanitation; and reliable pathways to markets).  History  The existence of the phrase \\"humanitarian engineering\\" has only been somewhat commonplace since the early 2000s. In fact, the usage of the phrase \\"humanitarian engineering\\" practically does not exist in any professional literature from the 1800s to the year 2000. However, the concept of utilizing engineering as a mechanism of promoting societal welfare has been something that has existed since the early days of the discipline. It was something that evolved out of the creation of an engineering code of ethics as well as the acceptance of a widespread engineering ethics as a whole. While initially, the notion of ethics was something meant to be a personal decision, over time, a general framework of what an engineer ought to do became established. The creation of organizations such as the National Society of Professional Engineers furthered this trend, as many such organizations began to adopt codes of ethics specifically meant to create a ethics framework for engineers. Within these codes of ethics, obligations that engineers have to society were explicitly stated including ideas like: \\"Engineers shall at all times strive to serve the public interest.\\" This evolved into the creation of humanitarian engineering projects meant to promote such societal welfare. As a result, in the early days of the discipline, humanitarian engineering was really only an application of engineering ethics as well as something that was just a part of individual engineering disciplines. As a discipline of study, though, it was around 2003, when the Colorado School of Mines created the first humanitarian engineering minor, that humanitarian engineering truly gained more recognition. Over time, as more and more universities have created programs explicitly for humanitarian engineering, it has grown more as a standalone discipline, rather than just an implicit part of general engineering discipline.  Relationships with other disciplines  Most engineering disciplines have a code of ethics that encourage working to improve the general welfare. For example: The Institute of Civil Engineers actively encourages the utilization of civil engineering in humanitarian work, calling it the \\"highest calling\\" of the occupation. Active work in the field ranges from an understanding and safety in humanitarian projects, to case studies on road building, refugee camps, footbridges, disaster response, housing and environmental clean-up. Likewise, organizations for other disciplines such as Chemical Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Biomedical Engineering also encourage applying their respective disciplines for humanitarian engineering. This is coupled with the fact that many organizations, especially universities, conduct humanitarian engineering products utilizing skills from specific disciplines.  Notable projects = The Peru Project = The Peru Project originated at UC Berkeley's chapter of Engineer's Without Borders, and its goal was to introduce safe water sources to communities affected by groundwater wells that contained high levels of arsenic. The engineers built rainwater catchment systems in schools which utilized roof gutters to collect rainwater, a flush system to filter debris from the gutters, and a tank to collect the water. The water is made drinkable through chlorine disinfection and is distributed to other locations through piping. This has provided the community with clean water that is safe for consumption and cooking. The second initiative saw the group partnering with local health ministries to formulate a comprehensive arsenic education program to teach the community about the dangers of consumption. = Hydropower Development in Pakistan = This project led by Oregon State University involves students and faculty helping Pakistan attempt to harvest their potential for hydropower generation. The group has produced open-source modeling tools that can generate climate data to analyze long-term trends. = The Nyamilu Community Water Project = The Nyamilu Community Water Project began in 2005 as an Engineers Without Borders project led by both Dartmouth College and Louisiana State University. Dartmouth engineers were tasked with locating an appropriate location for a well, securing a permit for drilling, building the well, and installing a solar-powered water pump; Louisiana State University students would be in charge of building a water distribution system. After overcoming various setbacks, the engineers managed to complete the project with assistance from the village residents. The result of this project was a 30,000-liter tank and 6,000 meters of pipe that helped distribute this water within a two-kilometer radius.  Training and education  An education in humanitarian engineering incorporates history, politics, economics, sociology, language, as well as rigorous engineering basics. Several universities in the United States focus efforts on Humanitarian Engineering: Colorado School of Mines was the first school in the U.S. to offer Humanitarian Engineering as a minor.The Colorado School of Mines' Humanitarian Engineering program currently offers minors in Engineering for Community Development and Leadership in Social Responsibility, and a Master's Degree in Humanitarian Engineering. The Ohio State University, which also offers a minor in the field, has many local and international service projects, courses, and research in Humanitarian Engineering. OSU has been engaged in humanitarian engineering since 1979, and has grown to fully involve students since 2004. Some of their student organizations include Engineers for Community Service (ECOS), who completed a project at an orphanage in Monta√±a de Luz to help children affected by HIV/AIDS. In 2012, the Humanitarian Engineering Scholars (HES) program was formed, followed by a general Humanitarian Engineering course, and a Humanitarian Engineering Minor in 2014. Oregon State University offers an undergraduate minor based on a set of Humanitarian Engineering, Science and Technology (HEST) courses including an international field course, as well as undergraduate and graduate research, capstone design projects with international partners, and a graduate fellowship program. The department has also planned and led projects in places such as Uganda, Guatemala, and Pakistan. Drexel University offers a master's degree in Peace Engineering following some of the same humanitarian principles and includes a graduate level co-op where students can apply the concepts in the field in places such as refugee camps. https://drexel.edu/engineering/academics/areas-of-study-programs/peace- engineering/ Other schools such as Arizona State University, Purdue University, Penn State University, Dartmouth College, and many others have begun to offer majors, minors, and graduate programs in Humanitarian Engineering.  Prominent Organizations = Engineers Without Borders = EWB is an umbrella organization with chapters in multiple universities and organizations across the globe. Its focus is on creating engineering projects that help marginalized communities across the globe. These projects are conducted by chapter organizations and emphasize education and sustainability. It also has a secondary focus on utilizing like-minded organizations to cut across borders and create change. = Engineers Against Poverty = EAP is an organization that focuses on creating independent projects that focus on helping marginalized communities. These independent projects are then collaborated on with strategic partners. Projects mainly focus on education, infrastructure, and oil and gas. = RedR = Formerly called \\"Register of Engineers for Disaster Relief,\\" this organization is an international NGO that works to support organizations and individuals that are addressing humanitarian emergencies, offer opportunities for people to participate in this work both directly and indirectly, and support any initiatives that fall within the field of humanitarian engineering. REDR primarily focuses on training relief organizations to help communities hurt by recent disasters. = Engineers for a Sustainable World = ESW is a nonprofit network that attempts to solve key sustainability problems through projects. It is an umbrella organization with chapters in over 50 universities. = Engineering for Change = E4C is an online, international community of engineers that collaborate to fix global problems in the status quo. Many of the members collaborate online to create solutions to these problems. There is also an emphasis on education with its website providing information on how to design solutions.

Three Presidents appointed Weidenfeld to advisory positions, including the President‚Äôs Commission on White House Fellows in 1977 and the Council on Administrative Conference of the United States in 1981, 1985 and 1988. He was named a senior fellow to the Council on Administrative Conference in 1991. In 1982, Weidenfeld was appointed Chairman of the Advisory Panel for Foreign Disaster Relief by then Administrator of the Agency for International Development, Peter McPherson.  Participation in democratic initiatives  In 1983, Weidenfeld was appointed co-counsel to the Democracy Project, The Democracy Program whose charge was structuring the National Endowment for Democracy. Among other international projects in his law practice during this time, Mr. Weidenfeld negotiated the first free exchange between the U.S. media and Novisti, the Soviet News Agency. He also represented the Government of South Africa following Nelson Mandela‚Äôs election in 1984.  Notable private sector cases  In 1973 Weidenfeld represented the Domestic Ammonia Industry before the United States International Trade Commission to ask for a curb on ammonia imports from the Soviet Union, which the industry argued was exporting ammonia to the United States at below-cost prices. The United States International Trade Commission agreed, and recommended that then-President Jimmy Carter impose a three-year quota that would halve previously forecast imports of ammonia from the Soviet Union.Curb Asked On Soviet Ammonia Weidenfeld also served as Counsel to and sat on the board of Imatron Inc. and InVision Technologies during the 1980s and 1990s.

Murray in A History of Board-Games Other Than Chess (1952). The game is related to draughts and even more so to Alquerque. Pieces are captured by leaping over them. The board is a pattern of two triangles joined together at a common vertex with further lines subdividing them. It is the same game as Butterfly (game) from Mozambique, which suggests a historical connection between the two games. Lau kata kati belongs to a specific category of games called Indian War-games, and the other games in this category are Dash-guti, Egara-guti, Pretwa, Gol-skuish. All Indian War- games have one important thing in common, and that is that all the pieces are laid out on the patterned board, with only one vacant point in the center. This forces the first move to be played on the central point, and captured by the other player's piece. It is important to realize that Lau kata kati's patterned board is the basis of other games, in particular, Dash-guti and Egara-guti, as the boards of those two games are an expansion. It serves as a basis for other games in the same way that the standard Alquerque board and the draughts board is a basis for other games. Lau kata kati is also known as Lau kati kata and Nau Keti Keta. Setup  The board consist of two triangles connected together at a common vertex (see diagram). Players play on opposite sides of the board with the base of each triangle forming the first rank of each player. Two lines cross the breadth of each triangle forming the second and third ranks respectively of each player. The common vertex is the fourth rank of each player, and is also the central point of the board. A single line perpendicular to the base of each triangle runs through the common vertex. There are a total of 19 intersection points. Pieces are situated on the intersection points, and move along the lines. Each player has 9 pieces. One plays the black pieces, and the other plays the white pieces, however any two colors or distinguishable objects will do. Players choose which color to play, and who starts first. The 9 black pieces are initially placed on the intersection points of one of the triangles, and the 9 white pieces are placed on the intersection points of the other triangle. The only intersection point vacant is the central point of the board. Please see diagram. Intersection points hereforth will be referred to as \\"points\\". Rules *Players alternate their turns using one piece to either move or capture exclusively per turn. *A piece moves one space per turn onto a vacant adjacent point along a line. *Captures are compulsory and are done by the short leap as in draughts and Alquerque, where the adjacent enemy piece is leaped over onto a vacant point adjacently behind. The captures must be done in a straight line following the pattern on the board. A piece must continue to capture if it is able to. Captured pieces are removed immediately from the board. *If a player captures all of their opponent's pieces, he or she is the winner. *If a player cannot perform a move or a capture because its pieces have been blocked or immobilized by the other player's pieces, this is known as a stalemate, and the player loses; the other player wins. *If neither player can capture any more pieces, the player with more pieces wins. If both players have the same number of pieces, then the game is a draw.

This resource was one of eight BRCs (Bioinformatics Resource Centers) funded by NIAID with the goal of promoting research against emerging and re-emerging pathogens, particularly those seen as potential bioterrorism threats. The VBRC is now supported by Dr. Chris Upton at the University of Victoria. The curated VBRC database contains all publicly available genomic sequences for poxviruses and African Swine Fever Viruses (ASFV). A unique aspect of this resource relative to other genomic databases is its grouping of all annotated genes into ortholog groups (i.e. protein families) based on pre-run BLASTP sequence similarity searches. The curated database is accessed through VOCS (Viral Orthologous Clusters), a downloadable Java-based user interface, and acts as the central information source for other programs of the VBRC workbench. These programs serve a variety of bioinformatic analysis functions (whole- or subgenome alignments, genome display, and several types of gene/protein sequence analysis). The majority of these tools are programmed to take user-supplied input as well. Virus families covered in the VBRC database The VBRC covers the following viruses: * Poxviridae * Asfarviridae Organization of the VBRC database The VBRC database stores viral bioinformatic data on three levels: # Whole genomes. This level contains information about the virus species or isolate and its entire genomic sequence. # Annotated genes. This level contains all the predicted ORFs (open reading frames) in a particular virus genome, together with their DNA and (translated) protein sequences. # Ortholog groups (families). This level is a distinguishing feature of the VBRC database. Each annotated gene, after it has been entered into the database, is subjected to BLASTP searching against all other genes already in the database. Based on the search results, it is either assigned to a pre-existing ortholog group or placed in a newly created ortholog group of its own. The goal of this level is to \\"allow for quick comparison of similar genes across a given virus family.\\" Central Tools Provided by VBRC VBRC provides researchers with a wide variety of database-linked tools. Of these, the central four programs are VOCs, VGO, BBB, and JDotter. # VOCs (Viral Orthologous Clusters) VOCs is the main database access interface. Users can search the available data by a number of criteria related to genome, gene, or ortholog group characteristics. Search results are displayed in table format; from here the user may obtain further information about a particular database entry, or launch a VOCs-linked tool (see below) for analysis of selected data. Additional analysis tools such as BLAST searches, genome maps, genome or gene alignment, phylogenetic trees, etc. are provided. # VGO (Viral Genome Organizer) VGO is a Java-based interface used for viewing and searching viral genome sequences. Together with a graphical representation of the selected VBRC (or user-supplied) genome, the program displays information relevant to a genome of interest, including its genes, ORFs and start/stop codons. Tools are provided allowing the user to perform regular expression, a fuzzy motif, and masslist searches. VGO can also be used to identify related genes across multiple sequences. # BBB (Base-by-Base) Base-By-Base is a platform-independent (Java-based), whole-genome pairwise and multiple alignment editor. The program highlights differences between consecutive pairs of sequences within an alignment, thus allowing the user to survey a large alignment at a single-residue level. Annotations from the VBRC database or user-supplied files are displayed alongside each sequence. Although Base-By-Base was intended as an editor and viewer for alignments of highly similar sequences, it also generates multiple alignments using Clustal Omega, T-Coffee and MUSCLE. Edit functions are provided to allow users to fine-tune such alignments manually; users may also annotate genomes with comments or primer sequences. # JDotter JDotter is a Java-based user interface providing VBRC-linked access to the Linux version of Dotter. JDotter can both access pre-processed dotplots of the genome and gene (DNA or protein) sequences available in the VBRC database, and take user input for generation of new dotplots. JDotter also interfaces with the curated database or the user-supplied file to display supplementary feature data such as gene annotations. Other Tools Provided by VBRC VBRC provides a number of additional Java-based analysis tools on its website. The tools in this category are each designed to perform a very specific task (e.g. regular expression searches, DNA skew plotting) and, though they can be accessed as stand-alone programs with user-supplied input, most have increased utility when launched from the central VOCS application with VBRC-supplied data. These additional tools are as follows: * Sequence Searcher performs regular expression and fuzzy motif searches of DNA or protein sequences, and is built into VOCS. * GFS (Genome Fingerprint Scanning) maps peptide mass fingerprint data to genomic sequences. It is built into VOCS. * NAP (Nucleotide Amino Acid Alignment) is a Java interface to napC, a program designed to align a nucleotide and protein sequence, taking terminal gaps and insertion/deletion mutations into account. It can be accessed from VOCS. * GraphDNA provides DNA skews and walks (a Cartesian plane-based representation of nucleotide content) from a VBRC database- or user-supplied DNA sequence. It is integrated into VOCS. * Hydrophobicity Plotter generates a hydrophobicity graph for a VBRC database- or user-supplied protein sequence. Three hydrophobicity scales (Kyte-Doolittle, Hopp-Woods, and Parker-Guo-Hodges) are supported; the graphing procedure is based on a sliding window of user- determined length. It can be accessed from VOCS. * GATU (Genome Annotation Transfer Utility) allows a user to annotate a newly sequenced genome based on the annotations present in a reference genome; it can also predict new genes in the query genome.

Plot The episode begins with Jackson bringing in the newspaper one morning and meeting Mike, who stopped by to return M.J.'s video game. When Mike suggests he should hang out with Jackson, Susan protests, but later agrees when he threatens to fight for M.J.'s custody. Mike and Jackson quickly become friends after they hang out one night. Susan is initially pleased, but is soon upset when she discovers Mike and Jackson exchanged sex tips with each other. One night, Susan meets up with Mike at the bar and tells him that she is uncomfortable seeing him and Jackson bond. Mike assures her it is a good thing that he, Jackson and Susan are friends, especially for M.J.'s sake. When she returns home, she finds out that Karl, her first ex-husband, dropped by and he, too, had befriended Jackson. Gabrielle is invited to a fancy party by Michelle Downing. When she is telling Carlos the good news, she is shocked to find him massaging an elderly person in their living room. Feeling uncomfortable, Gaby convinces Carlos to work as a masseur at a country club as the pay is better and she can regain her social status. However, Bree who is hired to cater the party, informs Gaby that they are being left off as they are considered \\"staff\\" and the guests felt it is inappropriate to mingle with them. Gaby and Carlos attend the party anyway through the back door. Bree drags Gaby aside and tells her to leave before the host finds out. However, it is too late as Carlos is chased off by Michelle. Carlos later confronts Gaby for her actions and she later confesses that she felt she was losing everything she had. Carlos tells Gaby about his clients that are complaining about their lives and revealing inner secrets that they are not happy despite being rich. He assures her that he is happy now as they didn't lose anything that matters and materialism does not matter as much. Lynette finds it difficult to strike up a conversation with Porter, so Parker introduces her to a social website named \\"Silverfizz\\" which allows online chatting. Then, Lynette creates an alter ego \\"Sara J\\" who is a teenage girl to chat with Porter. Tom warns her to stop chatting with Porter before things gets out of hand. Lynette refuses to listen and she is ecstatic to learn Porter has an interest in poetry. Her plan soon backfires when Porter falls for her and sends her an erotic poem. Panicked, she decides to write a Dear John letter to Porter to end the relationship. The situation turns worse when she accidentally signs off the message as \\"Love, Mom\\". Porter learns that his crush is actually his mother and is heartbroken. Bree shows her cookbook \\"Mrs. Van De Kamp's Old Fashion Cooking\\" to Andrew and Orson. Orson wonders why Bree did not name her cookbook as Mrs. Hodge, to which Bree replies that Mrs. Van De Kamp is what she is known for. Bree later does a radio interview for her new cookbook when she talks about her dead husband, Rex and completely ignores Orson's existence. When Orson confronts Bree about the issue, she says she is not proud of his past. Furious, Orson demands Bree to cook pot roast for dinner as she had promised over and over, despite the fact that it is past midnight and Bree has just come home after catering the party. Bree weeps while preparing the meal. Edie decides to move out as she is tired of the neighbors' cold attitude towards her, especially Karen McCluskey who insulted her with a crude joke earlier. When she asks Dave why he insists on staying in Wisteria Lane, he avoids the question by saying that they can be happy here and convinces her to stay. The next day, Dave pays Mrs. McCluskey a visit and demands an apology to Edie. Karen refuses, as she believes she was merely joking and claims Dave doesn't know her well. Dave then tells her that Karen must be lonely when he notices she talks to her pet cat Toby like a person and invites him in without hesitation. Toby goes missing after that and Dave offers to help her find the cat on condition that she apologize to Edie. Karen finally does, and tells Edie to inform Dave that they have reconciled. Later, she finds Toby back in her house, and finds her front window is left open. Karen ponders about Dave's true motives and teams up with Katherine to learn more about him.

It is located on its original land, on the corner of the \\"Great Roads\\" leading from Halifax to Truro and to the Annapolis Valley. History Lower Sackville was officially created with Fort Sackville in 1749, under Captain John Gorham. The first land grant in the area was given to Colonel Joseph Scott, of the Scott Manor House, located in what is now Bedford. The Manor was completed in the 1770s. The history of the Fultz Family begins in 1751, when a Johann Fultz left Germany, boarded the Speedwell, and traveled to Halifax. He then (according to records) made his way to Louisbourg. Before its fall in 1758, Johann Fultz, and his wife, whom he married while in Nova Scotia, Elizabeth, brought two children into the world. One of them, Anthony Fultz, petitioned the Crown in 1809 for land in Sackville after having received some from his father's will in 1801. In 1812 Anthony was successful, and purchased of land. Almost immediately afterwards, Fultz's Twelve Mile House began operating on the corner of the \\"Great Roads\\", serving as a rest stop for horse-drawn carriages traveling to and from Halifax. The inn was run by Anthony's son, William. The Inn included a ballroom. It was a popular stop for George Ramsay, 9th Earl of Dalhousie during his period as Governor of Nova Scotia (1816 to 1820). The inn itself burned down in 1890. In spite of this tragedy, the Fultz family persevered. Fultz House History In 1858, William's nephew Bennett Daniel Fultz purchased the land opposite the Twelve Mile Inn from his cousin, William Beresford Fultz. In 1863, he began building what is now colloquially known as the Fultz House. Bennett lived in the house from 1865 with his wife Mary and their eight children. The house was significantly modified prior to the 1900s, with the addition of a summer kitchen and second floor. Bennett and Mary served as masters of a post-office they ran from their kitchen. They died in 1910 and 1928, respectively. Jane Emily Fultz, the sixth child of Bennett and Mary retired to the family home after the death of her father. When she died in 1947, the connection between the house and the family had finally been broken; the house moved into the possession of another family. =The Fultz House Museum= In 1979, the Provincial Government of Nova Scotia acquired Fultz House and the surrounding land. Preparations were made to expand the \\"Great Roads\\" intersection in order to facilitate traffic. In November of that year, six Sackville community groups joined to form the Fultz Corner Restoration Society; among them were the Sackville Heritage Society (represented by Bob Harvey, a councilor with HRM District 20 today), a garden club, and a sorority. In 1980, the plans for demolition of the house were put on hold, and the house and property were leased to the society that August. The museum opened during the months of July and August in 1981 and was officially deemed the Fultz House Museum at a grand opening on Canada Day, 1982. Since then, it has served as a gathering place for teas, Canada Day celebrations, and other community events. Descendants of the Fultz family continue to be involved in museum activities. In 1988, the W.J. Grace cooperage was moved to the site; in 1995, the blacksmith's forge and tools that once belonged to A. J. Smeltzer were moved to the site. The entirety of the Fultz House site became the property of the society in 1990, and in 2008, the society was granted additional land in the form of 17 Sackville Drive, hand-delivered by Premier Rodney MacDonald. This prized community museum is open from 10am-5pm on all days of the week throughout the months of July and August. Through provincial and federal funding the museum is able to keep history alive through the employment of a summer staff made up of post- secondary students. Admission to the museum is free of charge.

Career Born in Savona, Liguria, Dossena started his career with Ligurian club Genoa but was released in 2002; in the 2001‚Äì02 season Dossena and Danilo Russo were the two keepers for Genoa's under-15 team. He then spent his youth career at Empoli, Tuscany. He played 17 games (out of a possible 52 games) during the 2004‚Äì05 and 2005‚Äì06 seasons for Empoli F.C.'s reserve team.Fullsoccer (in Italian) In the 2005‚Äì06, he was also promoted to the first team as a backup keeper, and awarded the shirt number 37. He spent 2 seasons with Serie C2 club Rovigo in the 2006‚Äì07 and 2007‚Äì08 seasons, and played as a regular starter. Rovigo also signed him in a co-ownership deal in 2007. In 2008‚Äì09 Serie B season, Dossena returned to Empoli and played as the understudy of Davide Bassi, ahead of Gianmarco D'Oria, and then ahead Alberto Pelagotti, in 2009‚Äì10 Serie B. In the 2010‚Äì11 Serie B season, Empoli loaned Bassi to Torino and sent Dossena to Barletta in another co-ownership deal; Empoli signed Jasmin Handanoviƒç as a replacement and promoted Pelagotti to second choice keeper. At Barletta, he was the backup of Andrea Tesoniero, ahead of Giuseppe Di Masi. He also played twice in the Coppa Italia Lega Pro. On 31 January 2011, he was exchanged with defender Giovanni Bruno of Calcio Como; Dossena's co-ownership deal also terminated in favour of Empoli. On 1 July 2011 he returned to Empoli. Although he was allowed to pick the number 1 shirt, the team's first choice was the fellow youth graduate Pelagotti. On the 30th matchday of the season, however, Dossena became the team's first choice keeper and was the protagonist in the club's victory in the relegation \\"play- out\\", which enabled his team to avoid relegation. Dossena only conceded 13 goals in his 14 appearances throughout the season, averaging fewer goals conceded per appearance than Pelagotti. In the 10th round of 2012‚Äì13 Serie B season, Dossena became the understudy of Bassi once again. On 2 September 2013, Dossena was signed by Venezia in a one-year deal. On 12 August 2014, Dossena was signed by Carpi F.C. 1909; however, he missed most of the season due to injury.

It includes policy, objectives, plans, procedures, organisation, responsibilities and other measures. The SMS is used in industries that manage significant safety risks, including aviation, petroleum, chemical, electricity generation and others. Description An SMS provides a systematic way to continuously identify and monitor hazards and control risks while maintaining assurance that these risk controls are effective. SMS can be defined as: > ...a businesslike approach to safety. It is a systematic, explicit and > comprehensive process for managing safety risks. As with all management > systems, a safety management system provides for goal setting, planning, and > measuring performance. A safety management system is woven into the fabric > of an organization. It becomes part of the culture, the way people do their > jobs.Transport Canada publication TP 13739 For the purposes of defining safety management, safety can be defined as: > ... the reduction of risk to a level that is as low as is reasonably > practicable. There are three imperatives for adopting a safety management system for a business ‚Äì these are ethical, legal and financial. There is an implied moral obligation placed on an employer to ensure that work activities and the place of work to be safe, there are legislative requirements defined in just about every jurisdiction on how this is to be achieved and there is a substantial body of research which shows that effective safety management (which is the reduction of risk in the workplace) can reduce the financial exposure of an organisation by reducing direct and indirect costs associated with accident and incidents. To address these three important elements, an effective SMS should: * Define how the organisation is set up to manage risk. * Identify workplace risk and implement suitable controls. * Implement effective communications across all levels of the organisation. * Implement a process to identify and correct non-conformities. * Implement a continual improvement process. A safety management system can be created to fit any business type and/or industry sector. Basic safety-management components=International Labour Organization SMS model= Since there are many models to choose from to outline the basic components of a safety management system, the one chosen here is the international standard promoted by the International Labour Organization (ILO). In the ILO document, the safety management basic components are: * Policy * Organizing * Planning and implementation * Evaluation * Action for improvement Although other SMS models use different terminology, the process and workflow for safety management systems are usually similar; # Policy ‚Äì Establish within policy statements what the requirements are for the organization in terms of resources, defining management commitment and defining occupational safety and health (OSH) targets # Organizing ‚Äì How is the organization structured, where are responsibilities and accountabilities defined, who reports to who and who is responsible for what. # Planning and Implementation ‚Äì What legislation and standards apply to our organization, what OSH objectives are defined and how are these reviews, hazard prevention and the assessment and management of risk. # Evaluation ‚Äì How is OSH performance measured and assessed, what are the processes for the reporting of accidents and incidents and for the investigation of accidents and what internal and external audit processes are in place to review the system. # Action for Improvement ‚Äì How are preventative and corrective actions managed and what processes are in place to ensure the continual improvement process. There is a significant amount of detail within each of these sections and these should be examined in detail from the ILO-OSH Guidelines document. Regulatory perspective=Implications= A SMS is intended to act as a framework to allow an organisation, as a minimum, to meet its legal obligations under occupational safety and health law. The structure of a SMS is generally speaking, not of itself a legal requirement but it is an extremely effective tool to organise the myriad aspects of occupational safety and health (OSH) that can exist within an organisation, often to meet standards which exceed the minimum legal requirement. An SMS is only as good as its implementation ‚Äì effective safety management means that organisations need to ensure they are looking at all the risks within the organization as a single system, rather than having multiple, competing, ‚ÄòSafety Management Silos.‚Äô If safety is not seen holistically, it can interfere with the prioritization of improvements or even result in safety issues being missed. For example, after an explosion in March 2005 at BP's Texas City Refinery (BP) the investigation concluded that the company had put too much emphasis on personal safety thus ignoring the safety of their processes. The antidote to such silo thinking is the proper evaluation of all risks, a key aspect of an effective SMS. Implementation=Adoption for industry sectors= There are a number of industry sectors worldwide which have recognised the benefits of effective safety management. The regulatory authorities for these industries have developed safety management systems specific to their own industries and requirements, often backed up by regulation. Below are examples from different industry sectors from a number of varied worldwide locations. Civil aviation The International Civil Aviation Organization has recommended that all aviation authorities implement SMS regulatory structures. ICAO has provided resources to assist with implementation, including the ICAO Safety Management Manual. Unlike the traditional occupational safety focus of SMS, the ICAO focus is to use SMS for managing aviation safety. Id. The ICAO High-level Safety Conference 2010 recommendation 2/5 proposed the development of a new Annex (19) dedicated to Safety Management. The Annex was published in February 2013 and entered into force on November 14, 2013. The benefits identified of this approach included: * Address safety risks proactively; * Manage and support strategic regulatory and infrastructure developments; * Re- enforce the role played by the State in managing safety at the State level, in coordination with service providers; * Stress the concept of overall safety performance in all domains.Annex 19 (Safety Management Systems) Executive Summary The United States has introduced SMS for airports through an advisory circular and other guidance. The United States announced at the 2008 EASA/FAA/TC International Safety Conference that they would be developing regulations to implement SMS for repair stations, air carriers, and manufacturers. The FAA formed a rulemaking committee to address the implementation (known as the SMS ARC).http://pmaparts.wordpress.com/2010/02/17/can-you-implement-a-sms-program Blog Entry on the SMS ARC Progress: Can You Implement a SMS Program? The SMS ARC reported its findings to the FAA on March 31, 2010. The Report recognizes that many of the elements of SMS already exist in the U.S. regulations, but that some elements do not yet exist.Safety Management Systems Aviation Rulemaking Committee, Final Report A draft of what the US SMS rule might look like was proposed by one trade association that participated in the ARC.http://pmaparts.wordpress.com/2010/03/17/a-possible-look-for-sms- regulations/ Draft Part 195 (Safety Management Systems). Currently, the FAA is supporting voluntary pilot projects for SMS. The Federal Aviation Administration has also required that all FAA services and offices adopt a common Aviation Safety (AVS) Safety Management System (AVSSMS). This is what ICAO calls a State Safety Program (SSP). The Federal Aviation Administration published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) for the establishment of SMS for air carriers.http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2010-11-05/pdf/2010-28050.pdf Notice of Proposed Rulemaking: Safety Management Systems for Part 121 Certificate Holders, 75 Fed. Reg. 68224 (November 5, 2010). That NPRM explains that it is intended to serve as the foundation for rules that would later be applied to Part 135 operators, Part 145 repair stations and Part 21 manufacturers. Id. Several U.S. trade associations filed comments in response to the air carrier NPRM, including the Aviation Suppliers Association (ASA) comments in response to the SMS NPRM.http://www.aviationsuppliers.org/ASA/files/ccLibraryFiles/Filename/000000000572/2011-03-07%20ASA%20SMS%20NPRM%20Comments.pdf and the Modification and Replacement Parts Association (MARPA)http://pmaparts.org/gvt/2011-03-07_MARPA_SMS_NPRM_Comments.pdf MARPA's Comments in response to the SMS NPRM. Among these comments were arguments for developing separate SMS regulations for other certificate holders, in order to make sure that SM remains a usable tool for advancing safety (rather than a uniform but useless paperwork exercise). In addition, the Federal Aviation Administration has also filed a NPRM for SMS for airports,http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2010-10-07/pdf/2010-25338.pdf Notice of Proposed Rulemaking: Safety Management System for Certificated Airports, 75 Fed. Reg. 62008 (October 7, 2010). which would be separate from the rules for SMS for air carriers (consistent with the arguments of the trade associations). The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) began the process of implementing Safety Management System (SMS) regulations by issuing Terms of Reference (TOR) on July 18, 2011.http://pmaparts.wordpress.com/2011/07/28/easa-begins-the-process-of- implementing-sms-rules/ See Dickstein, EASA Begins the Process of Implementing SMS Rules (July 28, 2011). That was followed by a Notice of Proposed Amendment (NPA) issued on January 21, 2013.http://aviationsuppliers.wordpress.com/2013/01/21/european-sms-proposal- will-likely-affect-distributors/ See Dickstein, European SMS Proposal Will Likely Affect Distributors (January 21, 2013). The proposed EASA regulation would apply to repair stations,http://hub.easa.europa.eu/crt/docs/viewnpa/id_199 See Notice of Proposed Amendment (NPA) 2013-01 (Jan 21, 2013). but would have significant ancillary effects on other aviation industry sub- sectors.http://aviationsuppliers.wordpress.com/2013/01/21/european-sms- proposal-will-likely-affect-distributors/ See Dickstein, European SMS Proposal Will Likely Affect Distributors (January 21, 2013) (discussing the potential effect of the rule on aircraft parts distributors). Maritime industry The International Maritime Organization (IMO) is another organization that has adopted SMS. All international passenger ships and oil tankers, chemical tankers, gas carriers, bulk carriers and cargo ships of 500 gross tons or more are required to have a Safety Management System. International Safety Management (ISM) Code 2002. In the preamble to the International Safety Management (ISM) Code, the IMO states, ‚ÄúThe cornerstone of good safety management is commitment from the top. In matters of safety and pollution prevention it is the commitment, competence, attitudes and motivation of individuals at all levels that determines the end result.‚Äùhttp://www.admiraltylawguide.com/conven/ismcode1993.html The International Safety Management Code IMO Assembly Resolution A.741(18) ‚Äì 1993. Railway industry Transport Canada‚Äôs Rail Safety Directorate incorporated SMS into the rail industry in 2001. The Rail Safety Management System requirements are set out in the Railway Safety Management System Regulations.laws-lois.justice.gc.ca: \\"Railway Safety Management System Regulations\\" The objectives of the Rail Safety Management System Regulations are to ensure that safety is given management time and corporate resources and that it is subject to performance measurement and monitoring on par with corporate financial and production goals. The effect of SMS in the rail industry has not been positive, as a 2006 Toronto Star review of Transportation Safety Board data indicated that rail accidents were soaring.Freight train accidents soar Critics have argued that this evidence should preclude the adoption of SMS in the aviation sector.New rules for aviation safety a flight plan to disaster, critics warn However, Transportation Safety Board data show that the accident rate in the rail industry has actually varied around the average over that 10-year period. Since the Toronto Star article was published, the accident rate has decreased. The Transportation Safety Board reported that ‚Äúa total of 1,143 rail accidents were reported to the TSB in 2008, a 14% decrease from the 2007 total of 1,323 and an 18% decrease from the 2003‚Äì2007 average of 1,387‚Äù and also noted that, in 2008, rail incidents reported under the TSB mandatory reporting requirements reached a 26-year low of 215.

He played in first-class matches from 1851 to 1868, primarily for Surrey, for whom he appeared from 1851 to 1867, captaining them from 1851 to 1857. He was a very successful captain, Surrey being acclaimed as the Champion County in 1851, 1854, 1856 and 1857. In 1857 the county won all nine of its matches. During the remainder of Miller's career Surrey was recognised as the leading county in 1858, 1859 and 1864. His brother, William Miller, also played first- class cricket. As player He was a right-handed batsman who, in 137 first- class matches, made 3117 runs at an average of 14.59 - respectable enough for the period, when pitches were very poor by modern standards. (For comparison, George Parr averaged 20.20.) He made two centuries, with a highest score of 133. He was also a useful bowler,Cricinfo has him as bowling in two styles: right-arm roundarm medium pace and \\"slow\\" underarm. Which arm he used for the latter style is unknown, but it would be remarkable were it different from that used for his medium pace. Lemmon mentions only the former style and CricketArchive only the latter. with 256 wickets at 20.58, with best innings figures of 6/36. He appeared for the Gentlemen in their prestigious fixture against the Players on twelve occasions between 1855 and 1863. As captain The writer David Lemmon is very complimentary about Miller's captaincy, bracketing him with John Shuter, Percy Fender and Stuart Surridge. He imposed a firm discipline on his side, but \\"never asked anyone to do what he would not do himself\\". He was a fine tactician; Jem Grundy of Nottinghamshire said that his captaincy was worth fifty runs in the field, a very large number in view of the low scores of the period.

The Gasconadian is equivalent to the European Tremadocian and roughly to the Skullrockian of the Ibexian series. The Gasconadian is named for the Gasconade Formation of Missouri, named in turn for the Gasconade River, and is represented by the Tribes Hill Formation in New York state and by the upper Bliss Fm and the Sierrite Ls of the El Paso Group in southern New Mexico and west Texas. The Gasconadian is a common term in the paleontological and stratigraphic literature of the previous century, whether used simply for a span of time or for strata laid down during that time. Time and duration Recent estimates (ICS and Cosuna) place the beginning of Gasconadian, and Ordovician, anywhere from about 488 to 500 million years ago, with a duration ranging from 9.7 to 10 million years respectively putting the end about 464 m.y.a. Both give estimates of over half the Early Ordovician. 60 percent according to the ICS, 2/3 according to Cosuna. Strata The Gasconadian (Tremadocian) is represented in southern New Mexico and west Texas by the upper part of the Bliss Formation and the Sierrite Limestone which is the lowermost formation of the Lower Ordovician (Canadian) El Paso Group. The Bliss is a near shore, deltaic, and beach sandstone deposit; the lower part spans the Upper Cambrian. The Sierrite Limestone is a shallow water, carbonate shelf deposit. The contact between the two is gradational. Generalized stratigraphic sections from the region indicate Gasconadian age strata take between 20 and 40 percent the Lower Ordovician section; 20 percent in Franklin Mtns outside of El Paso, Texas; 40 percent in the Caballo Mtns further north in southern New Mexico. This suggests the Gasconadian may actually take up well less than half the Early Ordovician rather than the principal amount. Cephalopods Cephalopods from the Gasconadian belong exclusively to the nautiloid order Ellesmerocerida, and predominantly to the Ellesmeroceratidae. Among these were Clarkoceras and Ectenolites which continued from the Late Cambrian, along with the exclusively Ordovician Ellesmeroceras the similar Eremoceras, both cylindrically orthoconic, and the compressed endogastirc Dakeoceras. All have essentially straight, short septal necks and thick concave connecting rings in the siphuncle. The latter Canadian, following the Gasconadian saw the onset and early diversification of two new orders, the Endocerida and Tarphycerida, evolution of new families within the Ellerocerida (e.g. Baltoceratidae and Bathmoceratidae), and near the end the first of the Orthocerida, Actinocerida, and Discosorida. The limited suprageneric cephalopod diversity of the Gasconadian compared to the ordinal diversity that followed also suggests a relatively short duration for the stage.

Biography Cornelia Ann Phillips was born on March 20, 1825 in Harlem, New York City, New York, the youngest of three children born to James Phillips and Judith Vermeule Phillips. (Her brother Samuel F. Phillips was United States solicitor general under President Ulysses S. Grant.) In 1826, James Phillips took a post as a mathematics professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. She married James Monroe Spencer in 1855 and moved to Alabama, where their only child, Julia (later known as June Spencer Love), was born in 1859. Spencer and her daughter returned to Chapel Hill after her husband's death in 1861, where she began her first book and wrote about the university for local newspapers. She published regular columns in The North Carolina Presbyterian and the Raleigh Sentinel. She urged the North Carolina legislature to close the university in 1870 to protect the school from Reconstruction politics, later revealed to be her own disagreement with the politics of university leaders at the time. After Reconstruction, she similarly urged the school's reopening and, on March 20, 1875, Spencer climbed to the roof of the South Building and rung its bell to celebrate. She contributed to the university by writing hymns for special occasions, organizing community events and keeping the alumni records. In 1895, she became the first woman to receive an honorary degree from the University. =Death and afterward= Cornelia Phillips Spencer's gravestone at the Old Chapel Hill Cemetery Spencer Residence Hall at UNC Cornelia Phillips Spencer died at her home in on March 11, 1908. She was interred in Old Chapel Hill Cemetery. Her collected papers are in the Southern Historical Collection at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The university's Spencer Residence Hall is also named for her. As part of the university's bicentennial activities, the Cornelia Phillips Spencer Bell Award was established. The award, given to a woman who has made outstanding contributions to the university, was awarded annually from 1994 until 2004, when it was retired following the discovery that Spencer espoused racist views, based on letters found in university archives, including opposing the admission of African-American students.Alan Finder, \\"In Desire to Grow, Colleges in South Battle With Roots\\", The New York Times, November 30, 2005.

History * 13 November 1952: Established as Diocese of Vellore from the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Madras The Diocese of Vellore was started by Salesians in 1952 carving out a portion from the Archdiocese of Madras- Mylapore. Further in 1969, few parishes from the Archdiocese of Pondicherry- Cuddalore were attached to this Diocese. It comprises two civil districts namely Vellore and Tiruvannamalai. There are 84 parishes having Catholic population of 1, 50,000. =Origin as a Jesuit mission= The Catholic Mission in North Arcot dates back to 1604. The following chronicles gathered from various sources will give some historical knowledge of this Mission, its foundation and development in the course of over 350 years. The last great prince of the declining Vijayanagar empire (now in Andhra Pradesh), Venkatapathy Deva Rayalu, conquered the kingdom of Vellore in January 1604 and named it Raya Elluru. Elapuri or Elluru in Telugu language would mean city or town. Raya Elluru was meant a town conquered by the king Rayalu and thus the town was named after him ‚Äì combination of two words Raya and Elapuri. There were then some Jesuit Fathers at the court of King Rayalu at Chandragiri. He took them also to his new court at Vellore. The word Vellore derives from the Tamil word 'Vel' which means 'spear'; according to another conjecture there were idols of Tamil God 'Murugan' holding 'Vel' in and around Vellore. Vellore was formerly called Velappadi (a place thickly surrounded by a particular tree called 'Velamaram') and for this reason and background the name Vellore came into existence. The Jesuits who had come with their followers here allowed by the King to build again and it is now with the Anglican Church). Ancient Jesuit documents show that among these Jesuits, there was one named Fr. Antonious Rubunus, a preacher and confessor, who was commuting between Chandragiri and Vellore. He was sent to Japan on 12 August 1642. On 22 March 1643 he was martyred at Nagasaki. In 1610, there was a general upheaval against the Jesuits. The Jesuit residences at Chandragiri and at Vellore were suppressed by a Royal order of the king Philip III of Spain and Portugal in 1611. Formal Christian faith came to the diocese of Vellore towards the last quarter of the 17th century from the Madurai Mission. Fr. Andrew Preyre, S.J. seems to have been the first to evangelise Vellore. St. John de Britto and his disciple Fr. Francis Laynis visited Vellore in 1680 and 1683. Fr. Francis Laynis, (later Bishop of Mylapore), founded in 1683 and 1691 the mission of Koratampet, the first one in the present diocese of Vellore ‚Äì in the Taluk of Chengam, North Arcot district, some 80 km South-West of Vellore. In 1699 the first French Jesuit Missionaries settled down at Pondicherry, after closing the Mission of Siam. In 1700 a certain Fr. Mandayat began the Jesuit Carnatic Mission at Puliyur, South of Uthiramerur, Chinglepet district like an Indian Sanyasi just as the Fathers of the Madurai Mission did in those days. Vellore was surrounded by the Mughuls and was taken over by them in the following year. In 1702, Fr. Mandayat founded the mission of Thakkolam (Arakonam Taluk), which was later placed under the care of Fr. Varance Bouchet. In 1703, he was subjected to persecution and was arrested. Later, he was released by the Governor of the Province, Sek Sahib, at the intervention of Fr. Pierre Martin. During the short time he spent at Vellore he decided to erect a chapel and residence under the patronage of Mary. Later, he and his catechist were thrown out of the city after being severely beaten. It was obvious that the Moghuls did not welcome the idea of Christianity getting established at Vellore. In 1712, Fr. De La Fontain, Superior of the Carnatic Mission intervened to bring to an end the persecution carried out by the Prince Dewan Hall. He approached the Nawab of Arcot through a Catholic Medical officer of the Nawab of Vellore. The Nawab of Arcot gave Freedom. In 1736, Fr. Jacques de Saignes had two churches built at Vellore and at Arcot. He stayed for a month in these places. He was provided with meals from the Rayal palace. In 1740, when the Maharaja moved from Vellore to Gingee, Fr. Joseph Trumbley was in charge of Athipakkam (South Arcot) and Koratampet (North Arcot). He wrote that one of his churches was plundered, another burnt down. The church at the Fort of Vellore was destroyed. 21 villages in which most parishioners lived were sacked. Many Catholics were murdered, and others had to leave. In 1748 the Nawab of Vellore granted one and a half acres of dry land to the priest, along the road, and another piece of land near the hill at Vellore. Two similar grants were made also to the priest at Arcot. In those days the Nawabs were dealing with the donation of lands to priests because the Zamindars were not willing to do this. In 1774, when Punganur (Andhra Pradesh) was occupied by Hyder Ali, a group of Telugu Catholics were brought by Fr. Henri Arnoult to Christianpet (North Arcot). Two families of Rajas from Rajampet in Cuddappah were baptised and then, taken into the service of the Nawab of Vellore. Their descendants are now at Christianpet 10 km North Arcot of Vellore. The Assumption Cathedral in Vellore =Missionaries of the Foreign Missions Society, Paris= In 1777, the Fathers of the Paris Foreign Missions who were at Pondicherry were given charge of the former Jesuit South Indian Mission under the general name of Malabar Mission, which was also called formerly Carnatic Mission and formerly Pondicherry Mission. The Mission among Tamils was known as the Mission in the Province of Arcot. It fared rather badly. In 1784, the persecution of Tippu Sultan dispersed several Catholic communities from the ancient Carnatic Mission in Rayalaseema. Some groups went to Vellore under the protection of the British. The Mudali Catholics of Pudur moved of Koratampet and Telugu Reddies and Kavarais settled at Kaniyambady, 12 km South of Vellore. In 1801, there were about 2,000 Catholics in the region of Vellore. In 1806, Fr. Arnoult died. Fr. Manenty died on 25 May 1812. Fr. Jean Austruay of the Paris Foreign Missions took charge of the Catholics of Vellore region. In 1817, a church was begun at Kortampet. In 1834, Msgr. Bonnand, as co-adjuster to the Prefect Apostolic of Pondicherry, came to Vellore for his first pastoral visitation. A church was built there at the foot of the western hills. =Creation of Vicariates Apostolic= When the Vicariates Apostolic were created in 1832, Vellore and Southern part of North district formed part of the Vicariate Apostolic of Pondicherry under the Paris Foreign Missions. The North and North Eastern parts of the district, beyond the Trunk Road of Madras ‚Äì Bangalore, namely the three taluks of Arakonam, Walajapet and Gudiyattam came to form part of the Vicariate Apostolic of Madras and it was entrusted to Mill Hill Fathers. In 1841, the church at Koratampet was completed. It measured 60 ft. by 15 ft. In 1846 the mission of Vellore had 3,341 Catholics, mostly from the depressed outcaste people. They were served by a priest, four catechists, one school, a main church and eight chapels. Arcot cantonment had 484 Catholics, of whom were in the light cavalry; Kaveripakkam had three or four Catholic families; Alapakkam about 100 Catholics and Christianpet 13 families. As the old church at Vellore was too small and in a miserable condition, the site of a local tank bed was bought for Rs. 200/- in 1847, and the foundation was laid for a new big church. In 1850, Fr. Moncourrier of the Paris Foreign Missions build a church and presbytery at Adakambarai on a site given by two Catholics. On 9 February 1854, the new church at Vellore was solemnly blessed by Msgr. Bonnand. After 100 years this church was found in a very bad condition and needed much repair. With a sum of one lakh of rupees it was repaired, extended and remodelled. It served as the Cathedral church of the diocese of Vellore from 1952. Again, this church was further extended with two wings with new concrete slab structure and was consecrated on 3 January 1988 by Cardinal Simon Lourdusamy, the Prefect of the Congregation for Oriental Churches when Fr. A. Nambikairaj was the Parish Priest. In 1884, the Catholic population numbered 3,376 at Vellore; 1429 at Kortampet; 2,473 at Polur; 2,546 at Koviloor and 15,751 at Chettupattu and Arni. Archbishop Joseph Morel of Pondicherry (1909‚Äì29) and Archbishop Mederlet (1928‚Äì34) of Madras were those who played a great role in the formation of the diocese of Vellore in the initial stage. Pondicherry missionary Fr. Francis Darras, also called the Apostle of North Arcot, welcomed into the Church 30,000 persons and founded several parishes in North Arcot district during 1876‚Äì1916. He built the Shrine of Our Lady of Lourdes at Chethupattu in 1896 and a chapel on the hill near by in 1880. It is now the Shrine of Our Blessed Lady and the biggest center of pilgrimage in the diocese of Vellore. =Arrival of Salesians of Don Bosco= In April 1928, the mission of North Arcot with nine parishes, which were under the French Fathers, was consigned by the Holy See to the Salesians of Don Bosco. After three months, Fr. Eugene Mederlet, the first Salesian parish priest of Vellore, was made Archbishop of Madras to succeed Bishop Aelen John (1911‚Äì1928). The Archbishop of Madras was entrusted to the Salesians of Don Bosco, and the Salesian mission of North Arcot and the three taluks of Palmaner, Tiruthanni and Chittoor in the civil district of Chittoor were added to the territory of the Archdiocese to Madras. After the death of the Archbishop Mederlet on 12 December 1934, Bishop Louis Mathias was transferred from the See of Shillong to the Archdiocese of Madras, and he took charge of it on 20 July 1935 and governed it till 1965. One of his outstanding achievements was the formation of the dioceses of Vellore and Thanjavur in 1952. =Favourable factors for Christianity in North Arcot= The Portuguese had control over coastal areas of Tamil Nadu and Santhome (Mylapore) in the 16th and the first half of the 17th centuries. Whenever the Portuguese exercised any authority or influence they supported the spread of Catholicism. The interior of Tamil Nadu was influenced by Mughal ruler Akbar with his friendly attitude to all religions, and similarly by Tirumala Nayak and Queen Mangammal of Madurai and the Kathirava Narasmiah Raj Udayar of Mysore. They all allowed the Christian priests to preach freely in their territories and convert the people to Christianity. The last great prince Venkatapathy Deva Rayalu of Vijayanagar conquered the kingdom of Vellore in 1604 and as we mentioned earlier, he kept two Jesuit priests in his court, first at Chandragiri and later at Vellore, and allowed them to build a church at Vellore fort. The first Portuguese Jesuits were called back by king Philip III due to their scandalous life, and this hindered evangelisation. Fr. Rubino wrote to the Jesuit general \\"The missionaries must adapt themselves to Indian customs\\". The Renaissance period created a spirit of conquest among the Europeans. The period of Reformation helped to reduce corruption in the Church structures ‚Äì the clergy, religious and similar organisations.  Important Churches in the Diocese =St.Anthony's shrine Viruduvilanginan= Viruduvilanginan was a sub-station of Athipakkam Parish, Pondicherry Archdiocese. Seven years before Fr. Anthony Thumma, the parish priest of Athipakkam, wanted to make it a separate parish. At that time, in November 1969, when the portions of North Arcot in Tiruvannamalai and Chengam Districts were detached from Pondicherry Archdiocese and attached to Vellore Diocese, Viruduvilenginan was one of those sub-stations with a good number of Catholic families, which became part of the Diocese of Vellore. S. Lazar, the Vicar Capitular of the Diocese erected this village as a parish and appointed Rev.Fr. A. Nambikairaj as its first priest on 16 February 1970. There are 3 sub-stations, namely, Porrikal, Kadagaman and Valavetty. Fr. A. Nambikairaj started to put up a shrine of St Antony on 16 December 1970. The large granite shrine, built of was blessed on 13 June 1976, the feast of St. Antony. The shrine is still visited by many.

Dr.P Soundararaju SDB Name of the Rector: Rev.Fr. S. Daniel =St Lordhu's Shrine, Chetpet= The Mission of Chethupattu, under missionary priest Jean Francois Darras, dates back to 1876. He was born of Mr. Francois Joseph and Marie Josephine Dowey on 16 March 1835. He was ordained on 18 June 1859 along with eight companions. He came to Pondicherry as a missionary; from there he came to the diocese of Vellore. Chethupattu was made a separate Parish on 11 March 1878. Fr. Darras had taken a vow to build a shrine in honour of Our Lady of Lourdes and built it on a hill top about 2 ¬Ω miles away from Chethupattu. Since this Church was too small, Fr. Darras built a larger one and dedicated it to Our Lady of Lourdes. It was blessed on 1 May 1896, by Rev. Gandi. The feast of Our Lady of Lourdes is celebrated there in the first week of May. In 1948 the parish priest, later Bishop of North Arcot, S. David Marianayagam, built the present Hill Chapel to replace the old one. Chethupattu has a population of 4,000 Catholics with 21 mission stations. It has a High Secondary School for boys and one for girls, and five Elementary Schools. Sisters of St. Anne‚Äôs Madavaram manage the Higher Secondary School for Girls. There are more than 2,000 pupils. The parish also contains the St. Thomas Hospital and Leprosy Centre. Missionaries include Frs. A. Fernandes, F. Capiaghi, M. Arockiasamy, F. Schlooz, Maria Arul, Peter Mathew, S. Susai and Fr. Thomas George. The Centenary of the shrine of Our Lady of Lourdes was celebrated in March 1978. Fr. Kuriakos on 26 January 2002 started Marivalam in the hill chapel of Chetpet. =Cathedral= View of the cathedral at night History of the cathedral The Society of Jesus spread Christianity in Vellore from 1604. In 1854 Vellore was made a parish. In the same year Assumption church was built. It was under the Madras Archdiocese and looked after by the Mill-Hill Fathers. In 1928, the North Arcot mission was entrusted to the care of Salesians of Don Bosco. On 13 November 1952, Catholic Diocese of Vellore was bifurcated from Arch Diocese Madras-Mylapore and Assumption church was announced as the cathedral of the new born Diocese of Vellore. In 1955, David Maria Nayagam, Bishop of Vellore Diocese, repaired the Assumption Cathedral and consecrated it. During the time of Bishop Michael Augustine, Rev. Msgr. A. Nambikairaj built the right and left wings of the cathedral. The new cathedral Even with these extensions, the cathedral had space only for 300 to 500 people. So during the reign of Bishop Chinnappa, the cathedral was demolished and basement for the new cathedral was blessed in 24 May 1999. The new Cathedral was consecrated on 15 September 2002 by Simon D. Lourdusamy and opened by Bernard Prince. Blessed Sacrament chapel, prayer meeting hall, Glass paintings of 18 important events of salvific history and 15 mysteries of Rosary, and 165 feet height Belfry are special features of the new cathedral. The present cathedral has capacity for 3,000 to 5,000 people. Bishops * Bishops of Vellore (Latin Rite) ** Bishop Pablo Mariaselvam, S.D.B.

Educated at the school of the Paris Opera Ballet, he joined the company in 1801 after an initial engagement with Jean Dauberval in Bordeaux. The Paris Opera's ma√Ætre de ballet Pierre Gardel presented an obstacle which led Aumer to choose the Th√©√¢tre de la Porte Saint-Martin as the venue for which to create his early ballets. Faced with the implacable competition from Gardel, Aumer left France for engagements in Kassel (1808‚Äì1814) and Vienna (1814‚Äì1820). Brief periods in Paris (1821‚Äì1822) and London (1824‚Äì1825) were followed by his return to the Paris Opera Ballet (1820‚Äì1831), where, enriched by the experience of working abroad, he engaged in a profound renovation of the French repertory, capped by his chef-d'≈ìuvre, Manon Lescaut (1830).

Flower (1964) included Beekmanoceras in the Ellesmeroceratidae believing the siphuncle to be ventral and the curvature to be endogastric with the ventral side concave. Structural details of the genotype Beekmanoceras priscum the only species known, are obscure, allowing for different interpretations (ibid). A few things can be said however. No other trocholitids are known to have an openly coiled gyroconic shell which casts doubt on that placement.

Previously, a station existed at this location which was in operation as part of the North Shore Line's Niles Center Route from 1925 until 1948, and later demolished in 1964. The current station opened on April 30, 2012. History In the 1920s, both the Chicago Rapid Transit Company and the North Shore Line (an interurban railroad linking Chicago and Milwaukee) existed under the private ownership of Samuel Insull. The North Shore Line's original route to Milwaukee ran through numerous North Shore communities that had become densely settled. In order to provide faster service between Chicago and Milwaukee, the North Shore Line decided to build a high-speed bypass several miles west of its original line. The new route would traverse the Skokie Valley and converge with the 'L' at . In an attempt to encourage development in the village of Niles Center on the southern portion of the line, the Chicago Rapid Transit Company would operate rapid transit service as far as Dempster Street. The new \\"Niles Center Route\\" included several intermediate stations served only by the Chicago Rapid Transit Company, including one at Oakton Street, just a few blocks from the intersection of Lincoln Avenue and Oakton Street where the business district of Niles Center was forming. Arthur U. Gerber, staff architect for Samuel Insull, designed the station in the Prairie School style, similar to the Dempster station at the end of the line. The station at Oakton was smaller and set between the tracks, with a single high-level island platform projecting from the rear of the station house. The line entered operation on March 28, 1925, but did not encourage much development before the Great Depression and World War II put a halt to building activity for nearly 20 years. The Niles Center service remained unprofitable in 1947 when the privately owned Chicago Rapid Transit Company was subsumed into the public Chicago Transit Authority, and on March 27, 1948, rapid transit service was terminated and replaced by the 97 Skokie bus route. All rapid transit stations along the line were closed, except for Dempster where North Shore Line service continued until the company went out of business in 1963. On Monday, April 20, 1964, the Chicago Transit Authority reinstated service on the Niles Center Branch as a nonstop shuttle between Howard and Dempster, dubbed the Skokie Swift. No station was located at Oakton, even though it is only one block from Skokie's central business district. =Reconstruction= During reconstruction Since the Swift began operating in 1964, there has been interest on the part of the Village of Skokie and its citizens to reestablish at least one of the local stations. The most likely candidate to return was Oakton because of its location near Skokie's downtown and its potential to generate the most traffic. A study commissioned by the Village of Skokie and completed in Fall 2003 recommended establishing a stop at Oakton. Village officials discussed and planned for a downtown Skokie Swift station for more than five years. More recently, a developer purchased the Pfizer Pharmaceuticals property adjacent to the station site to build a life sciences research park, now Illinois Science + Technology Park. The employees at the research park would drive ridership at the station. The CTA has supported plans for the Oakton station, as indicated in a 2003 letter from then CTA President Frank Kruesi: \\"By... providing infill stations (along the Yellow Line), the CTA will make better use of existing service capacity and provide expanded reverse commute opportunities.\\" =Style and design= In early 2005, the village received $417,000 in a federal grant earmarked for the station's design, which covers about 80 percent of design costs for the station. The village would pick up the remainder, about $104,000, according to Village Director of Engineering Fred Schattner. Then, in mid-2005, village staff submitted a grant proposal to the federal Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality grant program, which provides funds for projects that contribute to traffic congestion relief and cleaner air quality. In late November 2005, the Skokie secured a $1 million federal grant for the village's downtown Skokie Swift project with the help of U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-9th. Then, in early December 2005, Skokie learned they would receive an additional $9.2 million in federal grant funds to construct the station. The entire project is estimated to cost about $15 million including any land acquisition needed, which means the village had by this time secured more than two-thirds of the funding. Skokie Mayor Van Dusen has said he is exploring options to help pay for some or all of the remaining cost. Location The station is located on the site of the original station, just west of Skokie Boulevard, north of Oakton Street and adjacent to the new Illinois Science + Technology Park. The village sought proposals from firms for design work for the new station, eventually awarding the contract to McDonough Associates. Construction of the new downtown station was expected to begin in 2007 and officials estimated the station would be completed in 2007 or 2008. Issues of financing delayed the project as various funding sources were secured, and later issues of land acquisition delayed the project further. Finally in 2007 after extensive deliberation, the Village of Skokie initiated eminent domain proceedings against two landowners (an auto repair shop and a truck rental business) to make room adjacent to the station for a \\"kiss and ride\\" area, a bus turnaround and a taxi drop-off area. A groundbreaking ceremony took place at the adjacent Illinois Science + Technology Park on June 21, 2010. On June 8, 2011, the Chicago Transit Board revealed that the name of the station would be Oakton‚ÄìSkokie. Naming of the station was done concurrently with the renaming of the Yellow Line station and terminus. Facilities left The station consists of an island platform at grade level located between the Yellow Line's two tracks; the eastern track serves trains to Dempster‚ÄìSkokie, while the western track serves trains to Howard. Oakton‚ÄìSkokie has two entrances: one located off of Oakton Street and the other off Skokie Boulevard near Searle Parkway.

Auction Theory. San Diego, USA: Academic Press. . The need for travel auctions emanated principally due to the high cost of travel. This high cost is also what led to the growth in popularity of low-cost carriers, a concept initially pioneered by Southwest Airlines, and later mimicked by Ryanair. As with a standard auction, the bidders, having made a judgment on how much a particular voyage is worth to them, place their bid over a set period of time. At the end of this period of time, the highest bidder wins the product at whatever price is finally reached.Krishna, Vijay (2002). Auction Theory. San Diego, USA: Academic Press. . There are many variations to the way in which Auctions are carried out. Like a number of other travel websites, travel auction sites pull their stock inventory in from a wide variety of suppliers. The range of products may include cruises, package holidays, hotels and flights.  Types of Flight Auctions  As well as the most familiar English auction (or open ascending price auction) model, where the participant places a bid higher than the last, a handful of operators run no-reserve auctions or absolute auctions. Some sites also operate a system of mystery auctions, whereby the bidder is unaware of the product they are bidding on. Another variation on the theme is proxy bidding which involves the bidder stating their maximum bid for a particular product, and the auction site placing the bids for them automatically. Other sites offer pay to bid or Penny auctions. In these auctions, each bid that the user makes only increases the final price of the flight by 1 cent, while each bidder is charged a small participation fee for each bid that he or she makes. Research from Brown University http://cs.brown.edu/research/pubs/theses/ugrad/2012/estix.pdf suggests that such penny or pay per bid auctions have been able to survive thanks to customer retention initiatives such as the Buy-Now functionality which offsets the outright purchase price option of the good by the cost of the bids that the user has incurred, and also by limiting the number of times a particular user can win, leading to a greater pool of winners.

Wilhelmus Hubertus (Wiel) Nolens (Venlo, 7 September 1860 - The Hague, 27 August 1931) was a Dutch politician and a Roman Catholic priest. Life Willem Hubert Nolens was born to Martin Nolens, a tanner, and Hermina Hubertina Linskens. He studied philosophy at the Bisschoppelijk College of Rolduc (1874‚Äì1880), theology at Roermond Seminary (1880‚Äì1884) and jurisprudence and law at Utrecht University (1887‚Äì1890). He was ordained a Roman Catholic priest in 1887 and taught economics and moral philosophy at Rolduc. In 1896 he was elected to the Dutch House of Representatives. He joined the club of Roman Catholic members of parliament of which fellow priest Herman Schaepman was the chairman. Politics In 1904, a year after Schaepman's death, Nolens and other Roman Catholic politicians founded the General League of Roman Catholic Caucuses. He was a democratically minded politician who strove to better the fate of the working class and favoured better social security. Like Schaepman before him, this brought him into conflict with the conservative Catholics in parliament. In 1910 Nolens became the fractievoorzitter of the General League in parliament, a position he would retain until his death in 1931. In 1918 he became formateur of a cabinet. Although in Dutch political discourse becoming formateur normally leads to the office of Prime Minister, Nolens could not accept the position because of his clerical status. Instead Charles Ruijs de Beerenbrouck was named the first Roman Catholic Prime Minister in Dutch history and he chaired the cabinet Nolens had formed. In 1926 the loose organisation of the General League was further tightened and it was renamed to Roman Catholic State Party. When young Catholic intellectuals drifted towards right-wing extremism at the end of the 1920s Nolens faced increasing criticism. In 1930 the National Socialist Catholic poet Gerard Wijdeveld fiercely attacked Nolens in his poem De Droom van Nolens (Nolens's Dream) because of his perceived soft stance on freedom of religion in the Dutch East Indies. Importance Nolens was an influential politician in Dutch politics throughout the 1920s and 1930s as the Roman Catholic State Party was the largest party in Dutch parliament at the time. He was immensely popular amongst the miners in his native Limburg for they owed much of their improved working and living conditions to his support for social reforms. The night before his funeral street lighting in Venlo was covered as a sign of mourning. Ten thousand people attended the funeral next day.

History The forerunner of the Trust was the Chesterfield Canal Society, founded in September 1976, at a time when the canal was derelict above Worksop. The Society worked with the Retford and Worksop Boat Club and the local branch of the Inland Waterways Association to organise a boat rally to celebrate 200 years of the canal in 1977. The event attracted around 150 boats and 21,000 people, and was the first step towards plans to restore Morse Lock, then the head of navigation.Britain's Restored Canals, 2nd Ed., (2008), Roger Squires, Landmark Publishing, With progress on the extension of the navigable canal above Worksop being slow, the Society turned its attention to the Chesterfield end of the canal, and completed the restoration of Tapton Lock, which was opened on 29 April 1990 by the Mayor of Chesterfield. Another major step forward occurred in 1995, when Dixon's Lock and Hollingwood Lock were opened, both having been restored by the Society. Dixon's lock was the biggest achievement, as open-cast coal mining had destroyed the original lock completely, but the replacement was surveyed, designed and built by members of the Society.Chesterfield Canal, (2006), Christine Richardson and John Lower, Richlow Guides, The Trust was incorporated in 1997, and a year later it took over the assets of the Society. In 2007, a new mobile information display was funded from a grant given to the Trust by the National Grid and AMEC. The money was part of a safe working initiative for workers refurbishing the overhead power lines between Chesterfield and High Marnham power station. Aims The Trust has over 1500 members, and its aims include * the promotion of the restoration and development of the Chesterfield Canal * campaigning for the construction of the Rother Link which would join the Chesterfield Canal to the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation. This was first proposed by the Chesterfield Canal Society in 1995, and would involve the canalisation of of the River Rother from Killamarsh to the River Don at Rotherham. Trip boats The Trust operates three 12-seat trip boats, one based at Chesterfield, another at Retford and the latest one at Kiveton Park. The boats are crewed by volunteer members of the Trust and are named after influential figures in the building of the canal, namely John Varley (based at Chesterfield), Seth Ellis (after Seth Ellis Stevenson, based at Retford) and Hugh Henshall (Kiveton Park). All the boats run public trips along their respective stretches of the canal and are available for private charter. The Hugh Henshall is a 45 ft diesel electric hybrid boat, funded by a grant from Peoples Millions and the Big Lottery Fund. The Hugh Henshall and John Varley boats are both accessible by wheelchair users. Volunteers In a similar way to the Waterway Recovery Group the trust has a volunteer workforce. This workforce meets most Sundays at various locations along the Canal to carry out repairs, or to work on specific projects. Between 2008 and 2011 they were working on the head of navigation at Mill Green. This has now been opened up to boat traffic as a direct result of the efforts of the volunteers.

It was established on January 13, 1818. The Grand Lodge of Indiana's offices and archives are located in the Indianapolis Masonic Temple. Pre-1900 The first Lodge in Indiana was created by residents of Vincennes, Indiana. They sought a dispensation to create the Lodge from Louisville, Kentucky's Abraham Lodge #8 in 1806. One was granted in 1807, but due to the distance, they were not able to constitute the lodge. After a second dispensation was sought in 1808, a lodge was formed on March 13, 1809 and the officers were initiated. Other lodges in the Indiana Territory founded by the Grand Lodge of Kentucky were Madison (1815), Charlestown (1816), Melchizedek in Salem (1817), Pisgah in Corydon, Lawrenceburg, Rising Sun, and Vevay (1817). On May 9, 1817, the Grand Lodge of Ohio granted a dispensation for Brookville Harmony Lodge in Brookville, Indiana; this lodge would remain under the Grand Lodge of Ohio for two years following the founding of Indiana's Grand Lodge.Smith, Dwight L. Goodly Heritage (Grand Lodge F. & A.M. of Indiana, 1968) pg.6,8,9,11 After Indiana attained statehood, it qualified for its own Grand Lodge. While attending the annual meeting of the Grand Lodge of Kentucky in September 1817, members of several lodges within the new state agreed to meet in Corydon with representative from all lodges and discuss the viability of forming a Grand Lodge with the State of Indiana. On December 3, 1817, discussion began as to whether a Grand Lodge for Indiana should be formed, 354 days after Indiana gained statehood. Eleven Freemasons from the various lodges in Indiana met in Corydon, and decided to initiate the new Grand Lodge. Amongst these was the first Lieutenant-governor of Indiana, Christopher Harrison. Thus, the Grand Lodge of Indiana was chartered on January 13, 1818, at the presently-named Schofield House, owned by Alexander Lanier, father of James Lanier and a Freemason as well, in Madison, Indiana. Only three Freemasons were at both meetings. The first Grand Master of Indiana was Alexander Buckner of Charlestown, who would later become a United States senator from Missouri.Smith pg.18, 42-44Indiana Freemasons OnlineMorris, Martha. Christopher Harrison, Indiana Magazine of History Volume 100, #2. (Indiana University Dept. of History, 1920) pg.107 The Grand Lodge would have its first annual meeting in Charlestown, and would alternate between cities until in 1828 it met in Indianapolis, where it has met ever since.Mackey, Albert. The History of Freemasonry (The Masonic History Co., 1898) pg.1458 Indiana would not escape the anti-Masonry hysteria of the 1820s-1840. In 1828 there were 33 lodges in Indiana. In both 1833 and 1835 ten lodges were closed. At one point, between 1835‚Äì1837, there were only twelve lodges left in Indiana. Eighteen lodges were started during this, but only five of which lasted. In 1834 there was even talk of abolishing the Grand Lodge. In many of the years between 1828‚Äì1842, the Grand Master did not even attend the Grand Lodge meetings. By 1842 the anti-Masonry hysteria had waned, and the various Grand Lodges could again growSmith pg.78,79 Post-1900 In 1916 the Grand Lodge created the Indiana Masonic Home to support elderly Masons, the widows and orphans of Master Masons, and older members of the Order of the Eastern Star. The Home still exists in Franklin, Indiana and changed its operating name to Compass Park in 2016.Hodapp, Christopher L., Heritage Endures: Perspectives On 200 Years Of Indiana Freemasonry, p. 179-180 By 1957, there were more than 4 million Freemasons in the United States. The Grand Lodge of Indiana had its highest membership at that time with 185,211 members, or 4% of the state's total population of 4.5 million. Indiana at that time was the fifth largest Masonic jurisdiction in the world. Indianapolis is also home to the two largest Masonic appendant body chapters in the U.S.: throughout the 20th century, the Indianapolis Valley of the Scottish Rite at the Scottish Rite Cathedral was the world's largest Scottish Rite Valley; and the Murat Shrine was the largest body of Shriners International. In 2016 the number of Freemasons in the Grand Lodge of Indiana was 55,553 amongst its 394 separate lodges, currently making it the sixth largest Masonic jurisdiction in the U.S.2016 List of Lodges Masonic, Pantagraph Printing & Stationary Co. Beginning in the early 1960s, the Grand lodge of Indiana began erecting historical markers at sites with great Masonic significance. By 1976, 27 of these bronze plaques had been placed across the state, and the majority of them are still standing in 2018.Hodapp, p. 73-108 In 1987, the Masonic Library and Museum of Indiana was established to preserve and protect historical items and records of Indiana Freemasonry. Much of the initial collection was amassed for the 1968 sesquicentennial celebration of the Grand Lodge's founding, but that mission has continued and expanded. The MLMI is located today in the Indianapolis Masonic Temple, which is also the headquarters of the state's fraternity. It is open to the public.Hodapp, p. 181-187 There are also 24 active predominantly African-American, Prince Hall Affiliated (PHA) Masonic lodges in Indiana administered by the Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Indiana F&AM;, which was established September 16, 1856. There were approximately 1,000 Prince Hall Masons in Indiana in 2018. The two Indiana grand lodges officially declared mutual recognition in 1998 and enjoy reciprocal visitation.Hodapp, p. 325-347 Famous Freemasons from Indiana include John Tipton, Oliver P.

Tenembaum's philosophy, first published under the title \\"Disillusionism\\" in 2012,Delilusionismo (Spanish Edition) Mookie, Tenembaum, Planeta (2012) revolving around original concepts like \\"Autothanatodeimia\\", \\"Illusions\\" and \\"Anti-Forms\\", introduces original and critical perspectives on human behavior and organization. Tenembaum's work reflects his views on the State, freedom, and ecology. For instance, he placed a ton of ice in the Plaza de Mayo in Buenos Aires and named it Placebo. He also caused controversy by publicly projecting on the chest and backs of six half naked ballerinas two video spots: one a popular Coca-Cola TV ad in which a polar bear played with a baby seal and shared a Coke with it while in the opposite one a polar bear hunts and bloodily devours a baby seal, he named the piece Bearshit. Since December 2015, Tenembaum leads a morning radio show called El Observador Internacional, in which he analyses the landscape of international politics.  Biography  He attended Law School and specialized in Anthropology at Temple University of Philadelphia. As a lawyer, he also worked as a city attorney. During the 90s he decided that some of his ideas could only be created and developed through art, specially art related to new technologies. Therefore, during the past years, Mookie has concentrated specifically on reflecting on the different problems related to the State by means of creating new-media works. Currently, Mookie is working on pieces having to do with the different social and ideological problems of the state, developing projects such as \\"Genesis\\", which by means of an on-line system which generates \\"trusts\\" with the status of juridical persons, it reveals how the State presents \\"traps\\" in their formulation and efficiency, which are not easily readable for most citizens. With this type of projects, Mookie makes them visible, strongly criticizing the State apparatus ruling Latin America. Chasing utopian goals, with his projects Mookie proposes social reinvention and, as a consequence, refoundation. His compasses in this goal are George Orwell, J.J. Rousseau, and John Locke's theories, as well as Minarchist ideas. An expert on the Internet and new technologies, Mookie is a member of FiRE (Future in Review) an annual event that gathers one hundred people from all over the world to discuss the likely penetration of the latest technological innovations and their impact on a not so far away future. He also founded United Virtualities, a company of on-line systems, and created over twenty on-line technologies, such as Ooqa Ooqa (Explorer's enhanced native toolbar), Schvitzer (an intelligent text highlighter), and Yachne (a 3D animated messenger). His art piece \\"Paranoia\\" was awarded the highest prize in 2008 official Sal√≥n Nacional de Bellas Artes the most prestigious award in Argentina. Recently he was featured on CNN's \\"Cala\\". His works have been the object of numerous individual and collective in his native Argentina, and abroad. Concurrently, Tenembaum's philosophical work started with a virulent critique of \\"Illusions\\", which is the term he uses to dub States, Religions, Families and other such juridical persons. His, is a deconstructive critique revolving around the fundamental claim that these Illusions are nothing but onerous fever phantasms spawned by each physical person's terror of death, or ATD (after its Ancient Greek initials Auto- Thanatos-Deimia). As of late, Tenembaum's system of Disillusionism has expanded into a wider discussion of human ethology. According to him, behavioral modernity, depends not only upon ATD and Illusions, but also upon the neuro-physiology that explains pain, relief, pleasure, memory, anticipation and other rival contenders for the very limited attentional span of human animals. Furthermore, Disillusionism relies heavily upon negativity and discarding as driving forces behind both human evolution and common sense. On a practical note, Tenembaum's philosophy also distinguishes animal aptitude from each individual's actual willingness to apply the abilities it possesses. Drawing a parallel with the ancestral packs, in which a division of attention and tasks was biologically enforced amongst individuals, Disillusionism attempts to make sense of the exchanges and relationships inside each human individual's Egosphere, and discuses the part Common Sense might play in optimizing such organization. Tenembaum is the father of five children and the eldest son of Baruch Tenembaum, founder of the International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation and is a resident of Paraguay.

Background and early life A member of the Vaux Breweries family, his grandfather Cuthbert Vaux (1779-1850) established the brewery in 1806.www.ancestry.co.uk Vaux was born in Bishopwearmouth, the son of John Storey Vaux (1834-1881) and his wife, Harriet, n√©e Douglas (1837-1901). He was educated at the Worcester College for the Blind Sons of Gentlemen and joined the part-time Durham Royal Garrison Artillery (Volunteers). Military career=Boer War= Vaux was a Major in the Durham RGA (V) when he volunteered for service with the Imperial Yeomanry during the Second Boer War. He was appointed Machine Gun Commander, with the temporary rank of Lieutenant in the Army from 3 February 1900, the day after he left Liverpool for South Africa on the SS Monteagle. He served in the 5th Battalion, where commanded the Maxim guns and took part in over 80 operations in the Transvaal, the Orange River Colony and the Cape Colony. He was mentioned in despatches 7 times, received the Queen's South Africa Medal with four clasps, and was appointed a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in November 1901. In 1903, he received the Volunteer Officers' Decoration. The family brewery introduced Double Maxim brown ale in 1901 to celebrate the Durham detachment's return and the beer is still brewed in County Durham by the Double Maxim Beer Company.Times Obituary of Ernest Vaux =World War I= Vaux commanded the 7th Battalion, Durham Light Infantry of the Territorial Force from 1911 to 1918, when he was invalided home on health grounds. The 7th DLI fought in many of the bloodiest battles of the Great War on the Western Front, and his long tenure of command was highly unusual for a pre-war Territorial officer.Dunn, pp. 29‚Äì157. Vaux was an extremely popular commander. The 7th DLI was recruited in Sunderland and many of the men under his commanded he knew personally. The battalion sometimes referred to itself as 'Vaux's Own'.Dunn, p. 157. In his first letter from the front he wrote to his wife \\" so my dear this is our first night on the front line. It is now past midnight, I have seen the men and made sure they all have had a hot drink and dry socks.... I very much fear that this is a war such as we have never seen before\\". He believed in leading by example and took part in many major actions. The 50th (Northumbrian) Division, of which 7th DLI formed part, was thrown straight into action at the Second Battle of Ypres as soon as it arrived in Belgium. British forces were fighting to stabilise the British line and the Northumbrian Division's units were thrown in piecemeal. On 26 April, Vaux was ordered to move up towards Gravenstafel. The battalion advanced across open fields in 'artillery formation' under heavy fire, watched by Vaux standing in the open with his shepherd's crook in his hand. They reached a position north of Zonnebeke, before being ordered to retire after dark. Unlike the rest of the brigade, 7th DLI's casualties in their first action had been light, though they suffered a trickle of other casualties before being relieved from the front line on 3 May.Dunn, pp. 36‚Äì48.Wyrall, pp. 5, 10‚Äì11, 20‚Äì1, 34‚Äì5, 40. On 21 May the battalion was sent back up to the line to learn the routine of trench holding; A and B Companies were attached to the Regulars of 3rd Battalion Royal Fusiliers in trenches that were knee-deep in mud. While the battalion was in the line, the Germans launched another serious attack (the Battle of Bellewaarde Ridge) on Whit Monday (24 May) preceded by a gas cloud and the front line was overrun. Vaux ordered his men to get out of the trench and stand up to avoid the low-hanging gas cloud, and gathered other men who were retiring from the front line, telling them, 'It's no use running. Come up here and sing a hymn'. They stood on the parapet and sang Abide with Me as the cloud passed by. The Fusiliers and Durhams repulsed the initial attack, but a neighbouring unit was driven back and the battalions' left flank was open. They were pushed back to the third line, just behind Railway Wood, before reinforcements (including C and D Companies of 7th DLI) arrived to help halt the enemy advance. The battalion lost 29 killed, 76 wounded or gassed, and 183 missing, mainly Prisoners of War (PoW) from the overrun front trench.Dunn, pp. 52‚Äì68.Wyrall, pp. 59‚Äì70. After the war, Captain Wade, who had served as a private in the battalion, painted the men standing up to avoid the gas at Bellewaarde and singing their hymn. The painting, entitled The Miracle of Ypres, is in the possession of the Vaux family.Dunn, p. 67. According to his letters, and letters sent by the men under his command, although it was highly irregular, Vaux chose to lead the attack himself. \\"At 11.00am we were ordered over the top.... When I assembled the men for roll call at tea time (17.00) the count attested to the loss of 700 of my command\\" of which Vaux himself was one of only 3 surviving Officers. Despite this terrible event the 7th was reinforced and Vaux continued to command them. The 7th DLI was converted into the divisional pioneer battalion on 16 November 1915. Although pioneers were still fighting infantry battalions, they received extra equipment (and pay) and were tasked with assisting the divisional Royal Engineers in constructing trenches and strongpoints, road-making etc. Vaux was instrumental in the battalion being chosen for this role, arguing that the various trades of the Sunderland shipbuilders among its ranks made it ideally suited.Dunn, p. 88. Vaux commanded them in these duties through the Somme, Arras, Passchendaele and the great German March Offensive in 1918.Dunn, pp. 90‚Äì157. In April 1918 he contracted dysentery and was invalided home. His letters, confirm that 'Chancellor' his favourite hunter and the horse he had brought with him from his home in Yorkshire to the battles field of France, as his companion and war horse travelled back with him after 4 years of War. Chancellor, lived out the rest of his day in the fields of Brettanby Manor. Colonel Vaux was mentioned in despatches 6 times during World War I and was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1916 and an Officer of the Ordre du M√©rite Agricole in 1919. He was recommended for the Victoria Cross VC in 1918. However dispatches were lost with his retirement and the award was not received. In 1922 he was appointed Honorary Colonel of the 7th Battalion DLI.Army List.Dunn, p. 208. The Ordre du M√©rite Agricole was awarded to him for his support of the farmers in France, 1914-1918 war. During the times that his Battalion was not on active duty at the front. Colonel Vaux volunteered himself and his troops to help with the harvest and to give general assistance to the farmers. His work greatly help to feed the beleaguered people of France, and for this he was awarded one of France's highest honours.Dunn, p. 130. Scouting Colonel Vaux was one of the first men to interest himself in the Boy Scout movement. In the early 1900s he started taking the sons of his brewery works and other Sunderland boys on camping weekends, to show them the countryside and awaken in them a love of nature. He was a close friend of Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell, having met him in the South African War. On 22 February 1908 Lord Baden-Powell visited him in Sunderland. Together they formed the official Scout troop (The Vaux Own) in Sunderland which still operates today. There is good reason to believe that this was the first official Scout Group in the world. Business and family Vaux owned and directed Vaux Breweries with his brother Cuthbert, for most of his life as well as being an active and popular member of the Sunderland community. He was a highly accomplished Landowner and farmer, a keen member of the Zetland Hunt, and the first President of the Wearside Football League 1892-1898. In 1906, Vaux married Emily Eve Lellam Ord OBE (1876-1966), the eldest daughter of Henry Moon Ord, a shipowner of Sunderland; they had four children: *Rose Lellam Ord Vaux (1907-1994) *Emily Maguerita Ord Vaux (1909-1994) M: Oliver, Bertram Morogh-Ryan.

Medical help could not be received quickly enough, and his health was so severely affected that he was moved to a nursing home on Windsor Crescent, Newcastle-upon-Tyne for treatment. He died there in 1925 and is buried in St Cuthbert's churchyard in Barton, North Yorkshire, near his home, Brettanby Manor.

Mr Kabando was on the national platform of politics since he joined parliament in 2007. His first party, the Safina Party was openly supporting the reelection of former president Mwai Kibaki in 2007. In 2013 Mr Kabando joined The National Alliance party which was led by President Uhuru Kenyatta. During the 2017 General Election in Kenya, Kabando contested the Jubilee Party's nomination to vie for the parliamentary seat in Mukurweini Constituency but he controversially lost the bid and left the party to contest the parliamentary seat on an independent ticket but was again controversially unsuccessful. Although Kabando left the president's Jubilee Party, he continued to campaign for president Uhuru's reelection and was among the senior strategists spearheading Uhuru's campaign. In October 2017 he spearheaded a caucus calling for national dialogue to heal the sharply divided country. In June 2018 he again mobilized prominent national leaders to support Building Bridges to National Unity, an initiative of President Kenyatta and Opposition Leader Raila Odinga. Kabando first came to national light when he was elected as chairman of the Students Organization of Nairobi University (SONU) in 1992 by an overwhelming majority of students. Although at the time campus politics was highly tribal, Kabando was able to unite all ethnic groups together to vote for him. At around that time he changed his name to Kabando wa Kabando to conceal his ethnicity at the period since the then president was the Chancellor to the University and he was very interested in campus leadership. Other than student leadership and parliament, Mr Kabando has served in the Nairobi City Water Board as Chairman water management authority 2004-7. He doubled as the Chiefs Executive of Kenya Hotelkeepers Association 2003-7. Nationally he is known for defending President Uhuru and supporting his party's agendas in parliament. He was also at the forefront in supporting the 2010 referendum that saw the inauguration of the new Constitution of Kenya. In 2015 and again in 2016, he initiated bipartisan parliamentary initiatives for dialogue on electoral, economic and constitutional reforms. Both efforts were successful and were legislated into national policy and programs. Kabando wa Kabando is described as a compassionate and eloquent leader with insights and foresight on social trends. As a former student Leader, Kabando has been an agitator for reforms that positively affect the common Mwananchi by calling leaders to account for their time in Office. Kabando is on record as citing chapter six of Kenya's Constitution on Integrity as his pet subject. Kabando's track record indicate a keen focus on provision of Bursary funds for education to the less fortunate of his Constituency. He also oversaw several other development projects in the Constituency including the building of Mukurweini Technical Training Institute and electricity and water and electricity connections in the constituency. Mr Kabando continues to be a respected figure in national politics due to his open support for Uhuru Kenyatta. He is also close to opposition leader Raila Odinga . He is reputed for agitating national reconciliation and unity. He remains vocal on national issues mostly through his Twitter handle and national media commentaries. Mr. Kabando‚Äôs first degree from University of Nairobi was in Political Science. He graduated in 1994. He thereafter graduated with Masters in Public Policy from State University of New York in 2001. In 2008, he received a Distinguished Alumnus award from SUNYSB. With Kenya again on the threshold of a defining succession politics and suggestions of constitutional reforms, it will be interesting to see where and how Mr. Kabando-Wa-Kabando roles. 1999-2001: State University of New York, USA - Masters in Public Policy & Management University of Nairobi: Bachelor of Arts in Political Science International Training in Corporate Governance and Leadership Living people Year of birth missing (living people) The National Alliance politicians Members of the National Assembly (Kenya) ","title":"Kabando wa Kabando"},{"id":"18572844","text":"Kivuti Maxwell is a Kenyan politician.

She is a Guggenheim Fellow, a Mac Dowell Colony Fellow and a Rockefeller foundation's Bellagio Center Fellow. In 2005, she won an Emmy Award for her documentary In Rwanda We Say‚Ä¶The Family That Does Not Speak Dies. In 2009, her film \\"My Neighbor My Killer\\" was Official Selection of the Cannes Film Festival and a nominee for Best Documentary at the Gotham Awards. Filmmaking career Aghion is best known for her documentary films on post-genocide Rwanda. Her feature film My Neighbor My Killer, an official selection at the Cannes Film Festival in 2009, poses the question of \\"How do you make it right again?\\" after the end of the genocide. This film as well as the three installments of the Gacaca trilogy are the result of nearly ten years of footage gathered in a small rural community in Rwanda. In Aghion's first Rwanda film Gacaca, Living Together Again In Rwanda?, the first installment of the Gacaca series, Anne Aghion closely examines the Gacaca courts, a citizen-based justice system that aims to try the crimes of the genocide. The proceedings would occur on grass ‚Äì \\"Gacaca\\" in Kinyarwanda ‚Äì where anyone who had a denouncement against the accused would be free to speak. If no one accused a prisoner, then that prisoner would be freed. In Rwanda We Say‚Ä¶The Family That Does Not Speak Dies, the second film of the trilogy, chronicles the release of a suspect in his community and how victims and suspects slowly learn how to live together. The third installment of her Rwanda series The Notebooks of Memory was released in 2009 and gives an account of the beginning of the Gacaca trials. It focuses on the local citizen-judges' examination of testimonies from both the survivors and those accused of the crimes. The Gacaca films have won numerous awards and gained international fame. They have also been widely used by non-profit organizations for educational and training purposes, and have been screened to officials, victims and prisoners in Rwanda. On a grant of the National Science Foundation Antarctic artist and writer program, Aghion peregrinated to Antarctica, where she filmed the feature-length, Ice People,. In Ice People, she filmed the lives of geologists and North Dakota State University professors Allan Ashworth and Adam Lewis and the McMurdo Station staff over four months. The scientists, accompanied by two undergraduate students, researched fossils of ancient specimens as they sought to uncover the climatic evolution of the world's coldest continent. The film premiered at the San Francisco International Film Festival in April 2008 and was shown at the Independence Night Film of the Film Society of Lincoln Center in 2008. Her first film, Se Le Movi√≥ El Piso (The Earth Moved Under Him)--A Portrait of Managua, was shot in the skid row of Managua. The film gives viewers an inside look in the life of Nicaraguan slum dwellers as they recount the numerous obstacles they have had to overcome in their lives. Aghion is a member of Film Fatales women's independent filmmaker collective. Biography and early career Aghion splits her time between residences in New York City and Paris. Before becoming a filmmaker, Aghion held various posts at The New York Times Paris bureau and the International Herald Tribune. Prior to her debut as director and producer of her own films, she worked as a videographer, as well as production and post-production manager. Aghion earned a Bachelor of Arts Magna Cum Laude in Arab Language and Literature from Barnard College at Columbia University in New York, and following her studies, lived in Cairo, Egypt, for two years. Awards Aghion won an Emmy Award in 2005 for her documentary In Rwanda We Say‚Ä¶The Family That Does Not Speak Dies. My Neighbor My Killer was an Official Selection of the Cannes Film Festival in 2009, nominated for Best Documentary at the Gotham Awards.

The victory for the man, popularly referred to as the bullfighter, over Mr Shinali, whom he defeated with a slim margin of 200 votes in the 2007 elections, must came in the wake of high-profile campaigns mounted by the then ODM leadership led by Deputy Prime Minister Musalia Mudavadi. The defeat was seen as a blow not only to Mr Mudavadi but also ODM which was restamping its authority in the region where it has more MPs than any other, and as a boost to the presidential ambitions of Saboti MP Eugene Wamalwa who along with Housing minister Soita Shitanda for the New Ford-K candidate.

The seat is currently held by Mr Wycliffe Oparanya of ODM. His home sub county of Ikolomani neighbours the populous sub counties of Shinyalu and Lurambi; a factor that is assessed to give him a head-start in the contest. In addition to the widespread support, he is a good public speaker and as such, many people in Kenya have come to love his activism role. He also commands a wide network of women in the county due to his love for bullfighting sport and the fact that the educated youth feel unfavorably left out in the county government appointments. These factors and bearing in mind that the incumbent is a deputy ODM party leader and a close ally of his earthquakeness, Jakom Baba Raila Odinga (who still harbours presidential ambitions) have left some political analysts predicting a tough village elder contest. Mr. Oparanya has won the hearts of many electorates since being MP for initiating several projects that uplift the lives of the common mwanachi. However his critics says he has somehow adopted a tribal line in the allocation of county resources and employment slots.

Matusz was named to the West Coast Conference Pitcher of the Year honors and finalist for the Roger Clemens Award. Professional career=Baltimore Orioles= Matusz with the Orioles Drafted fourth overall by the Baltimore Orioles in the 2008 MLB draft. Matusz signed a contract with the Orioles on August 15, 2008, the deadline to sign draft picks. In spring 2009 he was invited to the Orioles spring training. In June 2009, he was promoted from high Single-A (Frederick Keys) to a starting pitcher for the Double-A Bowie Baysox. He struck out 10 batters in his first start for Bowie on June 17. Matusz was named Baseball America's ninth best overall prospect mid-season in 2009. Before the 2010 season, Baseball America named him the fifth best prospect in all of baseball. Matusz made his MLB debut on August 4, 2009, against the Detroit Tigers. On his MLB debut Matusz went five innings, allowing six hits, one earned run and striking out five. He earned a win in his effort. On September 14, the O's decided to shut Matusz down for the remainder of the season, wary of overextending the rookie in his first big league season. He was named a starting pitcher on Baseball America's 2010 All- Rookie Team. He missed the first two months of the 2011 season with an injury. He returned and got six starts and finished with a 1‚Äì4 record with an ERA above 7.00 before being demoted to Triple-A Norfolk on June 30 to work on his velocity. He was later recalled and continued to struggle, posting a 1‚Äì7 record and 9.84 ERA before his removal from the starting rotation in September. Matusz began the 2012 season in the rotation, but was demoted to the bullpen in August. In the bullpen, Matusz excelled, striking out 19 with a 1.35 ERA in 18 appearances. He also did not allow a single inherited runner to score. He pitched the last three months of the season with a rectus abdominis tear, preventing him from sprinting, but not pitching. He had surgery in October to repair the tear, and was expected to be back for spring training. In 2013, Matusz made the transition to full-time reliever, appearing in 65 games. He was 2‚Äì1 with a 3.53 ERA for the Orioles. On May 23, 2015, Matusz was ejected from the game against the Miami Marlins in the 12th inning for cheating, specifically for having a foreign substance on his right forearm. He was the second pitcher to be ejected for a foreign substance in that past week. He was suspended for 8 games. http://deadspin.com/brian-matusz-second- pitcher-this-week-ejected-for-fore-1706597771 On February 4, 2016, Matusz and the Orioles agreed to a one-year deal to avoid arbitration.

It was originally developed by retrofitting improved wings to the fuselage and tail of the HP-13. Schreder won the 1966 US national soaring championship in the prototype HP-14. The HP-14 features a folding V-tail and 90-degree flaps for glidepath control. The fuselage and wings are of all- aluminum riveted construction. Development Development of the HP-14 was carried out by several parties but the biggest modifications to the design were carried out by Slingsby Aviation at Kirkbymoorside, North Yorkshire, England, where a 20-metre wing was fitted on the prototype HP-14C, along with an enlarged V-tail. Later Slingsby production aircraft had a conventional cruciform tail. Slingsby production and sales were hampered by certification problems, particularly with flap actuation at high speed, and the disastrous fire at Kirbymoorside on 18 November 1968. Slingsby produced only three aircraft. Other homebuilders incorporated their own modifications but none achieved production status.

Baker (1819‚Äì1850), founded a publishing company that would eventually become Charles Scribner's Sons. Early life Scribner was born in New York City on February 21, 1821. He was the son of Uriah Rogers Scribner (1778‚Äì1853) and Betsey (n√©e Hawley) Scribner (1787‚Äì1871). Among his siblings was the Rev. William Scribner and Walter Scribner, a druggist. He attended the Lawrenceville School from 1834 to 1837. After a year's study at New York University, he entered Princeton University and graduated with the class of 1840. He began the study of law, but was obliged by ill health to make a trip to Europe. Career After returning from Europe, in 1846 Scribner became the younger partner of Baker in forming a new kind of publishing house under the firm name of Baker and Scribner. Unlike traditional houses, which were generally outgrowths of printing companies or book sellers, theirs would exist purely as a publisher. This had an influence on the character of its publications, which were chiefly confined to the works of contemporary authors. It also published Presbyterian philosophy books. With the death of Baker in 1850, Scribner gained control of the company, renaming it Charles Scribner, and then Charles Scribner and Company. With Charles Welford, who died in May 1885, he formed the house of Scribner and Welford in 1857 for the importation of foreign books. In 1865, Charles Scribner and Co. made its first venture into magazine publishing with Hours at Home, a monthly magazine. In 1870 this magazine was merged into Scribner's Monthly under the editorship of Josiah G. Holland, and published by a separate company, Scribner and Co., with Dr. Holland and Roswell Smith as part owners. Upon Scribner's death the next year in August 1871, Charles Scribner and Co. was reorganized as Scribner, Armstrong, and Co. The partners in the new firm were Scribner's eldest son, John Blair Scribner, Andrew C. Armstrong, and Edward Seymour. In 1877, the publication house moved to 743 Broadway. Upon Seymour's death in April 1877, and Armstrong's retirement in 1878, the firm-name was changed to Charles Scribner's Sons, under which form the business was conducted after John Blair Scribner's death in 1879 by Charles Scribner and Arthur H. Scribner, younger brothers of John Blair. Personal life In 1846, Scribner was married to Emma Elizabeth Blair (1827‚Äì1869), daughter of the magnate John Insley Blair and Nancy Ann (n√©e Locke) Blair. Her brother DeWitt Clinton Blair, continued their father's business and his son, C. Ledyard Blair, was a prominent investment banker. Together, they were the parents of: * John Blair Scribner (1850‚Äì1879), who married Lucy Ann Hawley Skidmore (1853‚Äì1931) in 1875. After his death, she founded Skidmore College. * Emma Locke Scribner (1852‚Äì1922), who married Walter Cranston Larned (1850‚Äì1914), art editor of the Chicago Daily News. * Charles Scribner II (1854‚Äì1930), who married Louise Flagg (1862‚Äì1948), daughter of priest and painter Jared Bradley Flagg and sister of architect Ernest Flagg. * Arthur Hawley Scribner (1859‚Äì1932), who married Helen Annan (1868‚Äì1928). He died of typhoid on August 26, 1871 while traveling in Lucerne, Switzerland. He is interred in the family plot at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York City.

Concluded in 1945, the agreement endorses the principle of an Arab homeland while respecting the sovereignty of the individual member states. The internal regulations of the Council of the Arab League and the committees were agreed to in October 1951. Those of the Secretary-General were agreed to in May 1953. Since then, governance of the Arab League has been based on the duality of supra-national institutions and the sovereignty of its member states. Preservation of individual statehood derived its strengths from the natural preference of ruling elites to maintain their power and independence in decision making. Moreover, the fear of the richer that the poorer may share their wealth in the name of Arab nationalism, the feuds among Arab rulers, and the influence of external powers that might oppose Arab unity can be seen as obstacles towards a deeper integration of the league.

Celestine V had only months earlier restored the election procedures set forth in the papal bull Ubi periculum of Pope Gregory X, which had been suspended by Pope Adrian V in July 1276. Every papal election since then has been a papal conclave. It was the first papal conclave held during the lifetime of the preceding pontiff, an event not repeated until the papal conclave of 2013 following the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI. Abdication of Celestine V Castel Nuovo, where the conclave was held Celestine V, founder of the Order of Celestines, widely esteemed and venerated for his holiness, was elected to the papacy on 7 July 1294, as a compromise choice after an over two-years long sede vacante. It quickly became clear that this saintly eremite was wholly incompetent and unsuited for a job as pope. Admitting his own incompetence soon after his election, Celestine expressed the wish to abdicate and return to his solitary cave in the Abruzzi Mountains. However, before doing so he issued two bulls. The first bull established the regulations concerning the abdication of a pope. The second bull (Quia in futurum, 28 September 1294) restored the constitution Ubi periculum, which established the papal conclave; the constitution had been suspended by Pope Adrian V in July 1276.

Guide to the events and documents, 13th Century It has been widely stated that the alleged great influence of the ambitious Cardinal Benedetto Caetani and the pressure he applied on Celestine V were important factors in Celestine's decision to abdicate, but it seems nearly as certain that it was an entirely voluntarily step of the Pope, with the role of Caetani limited to participation in the solution of the legal problems connected with the resignation of a pope. In particular, there were doubts whether a pope could resign at all, and who would be authorized to accept such a resignation.(The Catholic Encyclopedia: Pope Boniface VIII) List of participants All 22 living cardinals participated in the conclave; 12 of them were created by Celestine V, five by Nicholas IV, two by Nicholas III, one by Urban IV and one by Honorius IV:F.

On the next day, Christmas Eve, Cardinal Benedetto Caetani received the required two- thirds majority and took the name of Boniface VIII. Caetani's nephew, who was an eyewitness, says that Caetani was elected after one scrutiny and an accessio: scrutinio accessioneque eligitur.A. Theiner (ed.), Caesaris Baronii Annales Ecclesiastici Tomus 23 (Bar-le-Duc 1871), under year 1294, ¬ß 23, p. 147; Ludovico Antonio Muratori, Rerum Italicarum Scriptores III pp. 616-617. There was another candidate (Matteo Rosso Orsini ?), according to Jacopo Caetani Stefaneschi, but Benedetto Caetani had a majority (but not the required two-thirds majority) on the first ballot. That would mean that at the scrutiny Caetani had at least twelve votes, but not the required fifteen. Several cardinals agreed to support him after the results of the ballot were announced. Soon after his election he returned to Rome, where on 23 January 1295 he received his episcopal consecration from Cardinal Hugh Aycelin, Bishop of Ostia. He was crowned by Matteo Rosso Orsini, who was prior Diaconorum of the Sacred College.S.

He was also known as Costobar.Josephus \\"War\\" i: 486.Josephus \\"Antiquities\\" xv: 253-255 Another member of the Herodian dynasty was Costobar, who was the brother of Saul. Both Saul and Costobar were likely grandsons of Costobarus.Josephus \\"War\\" ii: 418 ; \\"Antiquities\\" xx: 214 Costobar(us), husband of Salome Costobarus was an associate of Herod during the latter‚Äôs rise to power. Following the capitulation of Jerusalem in 37 BC during the campaign by Mark Antony and Herod against the Hasmonean king Antigonus II - Costobar controlled the exits from the city.Josephus ‚ÄúAntiquities‚Äù xv: 260-266 Around this time, Antony appointed Herod as Tetrarch of Jud√¶a and Herod appointed Costobarus as Governor of Idum√¶a and Gaza.Josephus ‚ÄúAntiquities‚Äù xv: 254 , 261¬ßa In c. 34 BC, Herod gave his sister Salome in marriage to Costobarus.Josephus ‚ÄúAntiquities‚Äù xv: 255 , xv:255 ¬ßa ; ‚ÄúWar‚Äù i: 486 While Costobarus ‚Äúgladly accepted these favours, which were more than he had expected‚Äù,Josephus ‚ÄúAntiquities‚Äù xv: 255 he was never ‚ÄúHerod's man\\". His focus was always towards Idum√¶a and his own ambitions in that region. Costobarus was from a noble and priestly family in Idum√¶a;Josephus ‚ÄúAntiquities‚Äù xv: 253-254 and he resented that the Hasmonean John Hyrcanus had made the Idum√¶ans adopt the customs and laws of the Jews. He ‚Äúdid not think ... it ... proper for him to carry out the orders of Herod, or for the Idum√¶ans to ... be subject to them.‚Äù He also had ambitions to rule Idum√¶a himself, and ‚Äúto achieve greater things‚Äù.Josephus ‚ÄúAntiquities‚Äù xv: 267 These attitudes led him to three acts which aroused Herod against him and eventually led to his execution. His first transgression to become known (but the second to be initiated) was to approach Cleopatra to ask Antony for Idum√¶a to be transferred to her (instead of to Herod), as it ‚Äúhad always belonged to her ancestors‚Äù. Costobarus was ‚Äúready to transfer his loyalty to her‚Äù and hoped that he would eventually become its ruler.Josephus ‚ÄúAntiquities‚Äù xv: 256-258 Cleopatra did ask, but Antony refused. Herod sought to kill Costobarus as soon as he found out, but his mother and sister prevented him from doing so. Herod eventually pardoned Costobarus for his actions. But from then on, Herod no longer trusted Costobarus. The next revelation (the third event in sequence) came as part of the divorce proceedings which Salome initiated against Costobarus. Between c. 27 BC and 25 BC, she issued him a writ of annulment (which the woman was not permitted to do under Jewish Law, but Salome did so none the less), and declared to Herod that she did this ‚Äúout of loyalty to ... [Herod] himself‚Äù.Josephus ‚ÄúAntiquities‚Äù xv: 259-260 She then informed Herod that Costobarus was intending to flee the country in the company of Herod‚Äôs brother Pheroras,Josephus ‚ÄúWar‚Äù i: 486 who was out of favour with Herod at this time because of his infatuation with a slave girl and his consequent rejection of a marriage which Herod had arranged. Then Salome added the third revelation (but the first and longest running transgression): Costobarus had been protecting, for at around 12 years,The present translator gives ‚Äútwelve‚Äù, but in a footnote indicates that previous German scholars have proposed ‚Äúten‚Äù because of continuity issues from surrounding events. It is for this reason that the year of Salome‚Äôs divorce, and of Costobar‚Äôs execution, has to be approximated over a few years. the sons of Baba, Herod‚Äôs enemies. When Costobarus had been guarding the exits to Jerusalem in 37 BC, Baba and his family were some of the people Herod had wished to restrain, but Costobarus hid them on his own estate (because of their popularity with the people), and later denied all knowledge of them. ‚ÄúAnd when the king [Herod] was informed of these things ... he sent [his officers] to the place where they were reported to be staying, and had them kill these men and those who were accused with them ...‚Äù Josephus ‚ÄúAntiquites‚Äù xv: 266 And so, Costobarus was executed (c.27-25 BC).Josephus ‚ÄúAntiquities‚Äù xv: 252 , 299¬ße, 266 Costobar, brother of Saul Close family of Costobar ben Antipater Costobar and Saul were royal Herodian brothers, and kinsmen of Antipas ben Alexas,Josephus ‚ÄúWar‚Äù ii: 418-421 and of Agrippa II. Josephus ‚ÄúAntiquities‚Äù xx: 214. While Josephus does not specify the parents of Costobar and Saul, the name ‚ÄúCostobar‚Äù provides a clue: their grandfather was very likely Costobar(us), the second husband of Salome, the sister of Herod ‚Äúthe Great‚Äù.Josephus ‚ÄúWar‚Äù i: 486 ; ‚ÄúAntiquities‚Äù xv: 253-255. ‚ÄúCostobar‚Äù is an uncommon name, there being only these two individuals so named in all of Josephus' writings. This means that Antipas ben Alexas was a nephew of Costobar and Saul, through their sister Cypros bat AntipaterJosephus ‚ÄúAntiquities‚Äù xviii: 138 and Agrippa II was first cousin once removed to them through their aunt Bernice (Berenice),Josephus ‚ÄúWar‚Äù i: 552-553 who married Aristobulus ben Herod and are the parents of Agrippa I.Josephus ‚ÄúAntiquities‚Äù xvi: 11 ; xvii: 12 ; xviii: 133. ‚ÄúWar‚Äù ii: 220. When the Jewish insurrection against Roman rule was gaining momentum, Costobar, Saul and Antipas requested Agrippa II to send assistance to prevent the imminent uprising.Josephus ‚ÄúWar‚Äù ii: 420-421 The two brothers also were active against the insurgents.Josephus ‚ÄúAntiquities‚Äù xx: 214 Following the Battle of Beth-horon (25 November 66 AD) Josephus ‚ÄúWar‚Äù ii: 555 in which the Jewish insurgents defeated the Roman general Cestius, Costobar, Saul and Antipas were besieged in the royal palace. Subsequently, Costobar, with his brother Saul, escaped from Jerusalem to re- join Cestius: who dispatched them to Emperor Nero in Archaia, Greece.Josephus ‚ÄúWar‚Äù ii: 555-558. Antipas, who had remained in Jerusalem, was arrested by the insurgents, and slain in prison by John ben Dorcus, (i.e. John benTabitha), who was under commission from the ‚Äúbrigands‚Äù [zealots].Josephus ‚ÄúWar‚Äù iv:139-145 There is a fringe theory that the Saul in Josephus' writings was the same person as Saul of the New Testament. According to this theory, references to Saul in Acts of the Apostles and some verses of Paul's Epistle to the Romans are believed to reveal connections to the Herodian royal family. In Acts of the Apostles, Saul is named in a list of Christian prophets and teachers in Antioch, following Manaen, who was ‚Äúbrought up with Herod the Tetrarch‚Äù, but the verse does not clearly connect Saul to Manaen, or to Herod;Acts xiii: 1 In the last chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, Paul sends greetings to a man named Herodion, whom he calls a kinsman (Gk: œÉœÖŒ≥Œ≥ŒµŒΩ·øÜ).Romans xvi: 11 However, Herodion is a not uncommon name in the ancient world, and Paul refers to several others as kinsmen in the same chapter.Romans xvi: 7, 21b This term likely meant nothing more than that they were also Jewish.see Romans ix: 3-4 If he were a member of the Herodian family, Saul would indeed have been a Roman citizen.Acts xxii: 27 His behaviour prior to his conversion, in which he ‚Äúmade havoc for the church‚ÄùActs viii: 3 could be seen as reminiscent of that in which Costobar and Saul ‚Äúwere lawless and quick to plunder ... those weaker than themselves‚Äù, however, the account of the violent behaviour of Costobar and Saul in Josephus would have post-dated Paul's conversion to Christianity by decades. The Costobarian Herods Costobarus and Salome (the elder) had two children: Bernice and Antipater. Salome had another anonymous daughter: but whether her father was Joseph (first husband) or Costobarus is not mentioned in Josephus. By her marriage to Aristobulus ben Herod, Bernice united the Costobarian and Hasmonean scions of the Herodians. The descendants of the two principals included two kings of Jud√¶a - Herod Agrippa (Agrippa I), and his son Agrippa II, the Tetrarch, Herod of Chalcis, Herodias and Salome (the younger) of the New Testament, a line of treasurers of the Temple, and the brothers Costobar and Saul.

PTL Satellite Network was dedicated in April 1977. During PTL's 14-year history, the Bakkers, as hosts of the network's flagship talk show, The PTL Club, became two of the most recognizable and highly-rated televangelists in the United States. However, the PTL ministry collapsed in 1987, after a former church secretary, Jessica Hahn, accused the evangelist of rape, and later financial scandals purported that the couple had used the nonprofit PTL's donations to fund an opulent personal lifestyle. Bakker went to prison for embezzlement in 1989. After PTL declared bankruptcy, the cable network was sold in 1989 to Morris Cerullo World Evangelism of San Diego, California, and came to be known as The Inspiration Network, later changed to INSP, now headquartered at facilities that were constructed in Indian Land, South Carolina.  History  In 1960, Jim Bakker met Tammy Faye LaValley while both were students at North Central University in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Tammy Faye worked in a boutique, while Jim found work in a restaurant inside a Minneapolis department store. They were married on April 1, 1961, and left the Bible College to become itinerant evangelists. In 1966, the Bakkers began working at Pat Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network in Virginia Beach, Virginia, which at the time barely reached an audience of thousands. The Bakkers would make contributions to CBN as a nationally recognized television ministry.Jay Bakker, Son of a Preacher Man. New York: Harper Collins, 2001 (). The couple hosted The Jim and Tammy Show, a variety program hosted by the Bakkers and several puppet characters. The program was aimed at young children, whom they entertained with comic routines with the puppets, as well as airings of Davey and Goliath, a claymation Bible-story series. Due to the success of The Jim and Tammy Show, Robertson made Bakker the host of a new prime-time talk show called The 700 Club, which would gradually become CBN's flagship program, and become syndicated on numerous cable channels and network affiliates. In the early 1970s, the Bakkers left CBN and traveled, holding telethons at Christian TV stations. In Charlotte, North Carolina, the Bakkers set up Trinity Broadcasting Network with TV executives Sandy and Martha Wheeler, who began airing a local version of Praise the Lord on WRET, Channel 36, owned by Ted Turner at the time. The Bakkers moved to California, teaming with their former youth pastors Paul and Jan Crouch, to create the Praise the Lord show for the Crouches' new Trinity Broadcasting Network in California. However, the relationship only lasted about eight months due to a falling-out between Jim Bakker and Paul Crouch, causing the Bakkers to leave this ministry as well. Trinity Broadcasting Systems was based in Charlotte, NC and the California entity was named Trinity Broadcasting Network, which would grow to become the world's largest faith-based network in later years. Before leaving and moving east, the Bakkers managed to retain the rights to use the initials \\"PTL\\". What began as a local TV broadcast in Charlotte changed when several members of the Bakker's staff in California moved to Charlotte in February 1974 and with the local staff built Trinity Broadcasting Systems into what became known as the PTL Television Network. The parent company changed its name to Heritage Village Church & Missionary Fellowship in 1976‚Äì77. The purchase of the Heritage USA properties in Fort Mill, South Carolina, began at that time. The PTL Satellite Network uplinked from Heritage Village on Park Road in Charlotte until December 1986. The Heritage Village Property was sold and satellite and video tape editing operations moved to Heritage USA. Scandals PTL's fund raising activities between 1984 and 1987 underwent scrutiny by The Charlotte Observer newspaper, eventually leading to criminal charges against Jim Bakker. From 1984 to 1987, Bakker and his PTL associates sold $1,000 \\"lifetime memberships,\\" which entitled buyers to a three-night stay annually at a luxury hotel at Heritage USA. According to the prosecution at Bakker's later fraud trial, tens of thousands of memberships had been sold, but only one 500-room hotel was ever completed. Bakker \\"sold\\" more \\"exclusive partnerships\\" than could be accommodated and raised more than twice the money that was needed to build the actual hotel. Much of the money went into Heritage USA's operating expenses, and Bakker kept $3.4 million in bonuses for himself. The $279,000 payoff for the silence of Jessica Hahn, who was mistakenly supposed to be a Bakker staff member, was paid by Tammy Faye's later husband, Roe Messner. Hahn was actually a onetime acquaintance of Bakker set up by a \\"friend\\" in 1980. Bakker, who apparently made all of the financial decisions for the PTL organization, allegedly kept two sets of books to conceal the accounting irregularities. Reporters from The Charlotte Observer, led by Charles Shepard, investigated and published a series of articles on the PTL organization's finances. On March 19, 1987, following the revelation of a payoff to Jessica Hahn to keep secret her allegation that Bakker had raped her, Bakker resigned from PTL. Bakker acknowledges that he met Hahn at a hotel room in Clearwater Beach, Florida, but denies raping her. Following Bakker's resignation as PTL head, he was succeeded in late March 1987 by Jerry Falwell. Later that summer, as donations sharply declined in the wake of Bakker's resignation and the end of the Bakkers' popular PTL Club TV show, Falwell raised $20 million to help keep the Heritage USA theme park solvent, including a well-publicized waterslide plunge there. Falwell called Bakker a liar, an embezzler, a sexual deviant, and \\"the greatest scab and cancer on the face of Christianity in 2,000 years of church history.\\"Tammy Faye Bakker - Obituary In 1988, Falwell said that the Bakker scandal had \\"strengthened broadcast evangelism and made Christianity stronger, more mature and more committed.\\" Bakker's son, Jay, wrote in 2001 that the Bakkers felt betrayed by Falwell, who they thought during Bakker's resignation intended to help in Bakker's eventual restoration as head of the PTL ministry organization. Aftermath Following a 16-month Federal grand jury probe, Bakker was indicted in 1988 on eight counts of mail fraud, 15 counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy.U.S. v. Bakker, (C.A.4, 1991), 925 F.2d 728, 740, case no. 89-5687 In 1989, after a five-week trial which began on August 28 in Charlotte, the jury found him guilty on all 24 counts, and Judge Robert Potter sentenced him to 45 years in federal prison and a $500,000 fine. He served time in the Federal Medical Center, Rochester in Rochester, Minnesota, sharing a cell with activist Lyndon LaRouche and skydiver Roger Nelson.https://securesite.chireader.com/cgi- bin/Archive/abridged2.bat?path=2004/040402/SKYDIVE&search;=khakpour In early 1991, a federal appeals court upheld Bakker's conviction on the fraud and conspiracy charges, but voided Bakker's 45-year sentence, as well as the $500,000 fine, and ordered that a new sentencing hearing be held. Jim and Tammy Bakker were divorced on March 13, 1992. On November 16, 1992, a sentence reduction hearing was held and Bakker's sentence was reduced to eight years. The judge also cited Bakker's time in the prison shower as a life transforming event . In August 1993, Bakker was transferred to a minimum security federal prison in Jesup, Georgia, and was subsequently granted parole in July 1994, after serving almost five years of his sentence. Bakker's son, Jay, spearheaded a letter-writing campaign to the parole board on his father's behalf, urging leniency. His Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) number was 07407-058, and he was released from BOP custody on December 1, 1994.\\"James O. Bakker.\\" Federal Bureau of Prisons. Retrieved on January 8, 2010. On July 23, 1996, a North Carolina jury threw out a class action suit brought on behalf of more than 160,000 onetime supporters who contributed as much as $7,000 each to Bakker's coffers in the 1980s. The Charlotte Observer reported that the Internal Revenue Service still holds Bakker and Roe Messner, Tammy Faye's husband from 1993 until her death in 2007, liable for personal income taxes owed from the 1980s when they were building the PTL empire, taxes assessed after the IRS revoked the PTL ministry's nonprofit status.

Localbahn (sometimes Lokalbahn; literally: 'local line') means 'branch line' and is mainly used in southern Germany and Austria in lieu of the usual term Nebenbahn. The BLV's objectives are the operation of historic trains and the collection of historically valuable railway items from Bavaria.  Operations  The society runs the Localbahn Museum in Bayerisch Eisenstein257 and a locomotive shed in Landshut. It also operates the museum railway Tegernsee- Schaftlach-Holzkirchen263  Localbahn Museum  The BLV dedicated its museum to the once common branch lines of the railway - called Vicinalbahnen, Sekund√§rbahnen or Localbahnen - which connected most of Bavaria in the 19th century. Many of them have now fallen prey to the structural changes or have been changed to suburban trains in the vicinity of large cities. The museum is installed in the former engine shed of Bayerisch Eisenstein on the border to the Czech Republic. The round shed with its seven tracks as well as the two- tracked long house contain steam engines, electric and diesel locomotives, passenger coaches as well as goods wagons from 1890 to 1949. Special exhibitions cover issues such as the construction of railway lines. The open- air area has a working turntable. On some weekends the museum offers rides to Bohemia with historical steam trains. The society also owns a restored local steam train and offers rides from Landshut.BLV information supplied by the Museums in Bavaria website  History  The Bavarian Localbahn Society emerged from a working group of the German Railway History Company (Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Eisenbahngeschichte or DGEG), that ran steam train services between 1969 and 1975 on the private Tegernsee Railway (Tegernsee-Bahn). Because the operating licence for the locomotive (TAG 7) ran out and neither DGEG nor the Tegernsee Railway wanted to take on the cost of the general inspection, the Bavarian Localbahn Society was founded. To keep operations going during the period whilst TAG 7 was out of service the steam engine 378.32 was purchased in Austria. In 1978, TAG 7 was once again back in service as well, and the Austrian engine took over historical steam services on the Regen Valley railway until it was sold in 1996. The engine, J. A. Maffei, was also working on the Tegernsee Railway until the 1990s and now stands in the society's own museum. The Bavarian Localbahn Museum was established between 1981 and 1994, in the old locomotive shed built in Bayerisch Eisenstein in 1877. In 1999 the shed and tracks at Tegernsee had to be cleared and the TAG 7 steam train moved to Landshut. Since 2005 the society has once again owned an operational steam engine, a former Bavarian Pt 2/3, number 70 083. On September 11, 2005, the BLV celebrated its 30 years of existence with both a Class 70 and the TAG 7 steam engines operating.BLV information and contact details at Bayerische Oberlandbahn (BOB) site  Rolling stock = Steam locomotives = The BLV steam train headed by locomotive no. 70 083 *02 / ANNA of the Gotteszell-Viechtach Lokalbahn operated by the Regentalbahn, built by Krauss & Cie, 1890 *1854 from the Royal Bavarian State Railways operated by the Regentalbahn, built by Krauss & Cie, 1892.

This arrangement can be a part of flexible working hours, and is sometimes used to cut costs, as seen in the example of the so-called \\"4/10 work week,\\" where employees work a normal 40 hours across four days, i.e. a \\"four-ten\\" week. However, a four-day week can also be a fixed work schedule. More modest attempts to enact a 32-hour workweek (a four-day week and an eight-hour day combined) have remained elusive in the following 80 years despite pockets of residual support. Rationale The push towards implementing the 'four-day week' has remained loosely relevant within the contemporary workplace due to the various possible benefits it may yield. Although mostly untested, these benefits mainly lie within increased cost- cutting, productivity and work-life balance. The theory behind this is that by having employees or students work or attend school one less day a week, then they will have additional time to pursue hobbies, spend time with family, get more sleep and increase overall morale. There are several ways the four-day week can take shape. Taking Fridays off, half days, and different days off for different employees are all options that are considered when starting the four-day week. Consequently, these employees or students will be more productive and refreshed for working or learning, which will make up for the lost day where they would otherwise be overworked and/or overtired. In addition, by having the workplace or school open one less day a week, the operating costs and environmental costs will decrease for businesses and society alike. Notable examples=Utah state government= In 2008, employees of the Utah state government all began working ten-hour days from Monday to Thursday.Rex L. Facer II and Lori L. Wadsworth. 2010. \\"Four-day Workweeks: Current Research and Practice\\" Connecticut Law Review 42, (4): 1031-1046. By closing state government offices on Fridays, the state expected to save on operating costs such as electricity, heat, air conditioning, and gasoline for state-owned vehicles. Utah ended this practice however, in 2011, with the Utah Legislature overriding Governor Gary Herbert's veto of five-day work week legislation.Heather Kerrigan, Utah's Demise of the Four-Day Workweek, Governing (July 13, 2011). Many local governments have had alternative schedules for many years.Lori L. Wadsworth, Rex L. Facer II, and Chyleen A. Arbon. 2010. \\"Alternative Work Schedules in Local Government: Qui Bono?\\" Review of Public Personnel Administration 30, (3): 322-340.Rex L. Facer II and Lori L. Wadsworth. 2008. \\"Alternative Work Schedules and Work Family Balance: A Research Note.\\" Review of Public Personnel Administration 28, (2): 166-177.Rex L. Facer II, Lori L. Wadsworth, and Chyleen Arbon. 2009. \\"Cities Leading the Way: The Use of Alternative Work Schedules by Cities. 2009 Municipal Yearbook. ICMA Press: Washington DC, pp. 28-33. =K-12 public schools in the United States= Public schools in Hawaii closed on 17 Fridays in 2010. Over 100 school districts in rural areas in the United States have changed the school week to a four-day week; most also extended each school day by an hour or more. The changes were often made in order to save money on transportation, heating, and substitute teachers. =The Gambia civil service= In The Gambia, a four-day work week was introduced for public officials by president Yahya Jammeh, effective 1 February 2013. Working hours were limited to Monday through Thursday, 08:00 to 18:00, with Friday designated as a day of rest to allow residents more time for prayer and agriculture. This regulation was abolished in early 2017 by his successor, president Adama Barrow, who decreed a half-day of work on Fridays. =Perpetual Guardian trial in New Zealand= In New Zealand, trust company Perpetual Guardian announced in February 2018 that it would begin trialing a four-day work week in March 2018. The six-week trial, initiated by founder Andrew Barnes, saw the company's 240-plus staff nominating a day off each week whilst still receiving full pay. The trial, held in March and April 2018, attracted international media attention. In late March 2018, Barnes noted that the trial was going well with staff reporting more time for their families, hobbies, completing their to-do lists and doing home maintenance. The trial, which was tracked and assessed by the University of Auckland Business School and Auckland University of Technology, was described as a success and 'a total win-win'. Perpetual Guardian then extended the four-day work week scheme permanently. The trial saw increased productivity, customer engagement levels, and staff engagement; reduced staff stress levels; and improved work‚Äìlife balance. The company's revenue remained stable while costs went down, due to less power being used throughout the period. The trial sparked publicity both in New Zealand and internationally. New Zealand workplace relations minister Iain Lees-Galloway said the trial was 'fascinating'. The initiative was held up by Barnes as a way of helping to close the gender pay gap and increase diversity in the workforce. Barnes also held the scheme up as a potential blueprint for the workplace of the future, ensuring companies were attractive to millennials and easing Auckland's traffic congestion. However, while four- day work weeks were deemed a success for most, not everyone involved within the Perpetual Guardian trial was able to adapt, with some reporting feeling increased pressure to complete work within a shorter time frame, particularly around deadlines. Other staff reported they were bored on their extra day away from work and missed the work environment. =United Kingdom, c. 2018‚Äì2019= In the United Kingdom, late 2018 and early 2019 saw an increased interest in organisations switching to a four day work week, including call centre Simply Business, Aizle restaurant in Edinburgh and the productivity firm Think Productive. Research foundation the Wellcome Trust was reported in early 2019 to be considering moving all its employees to a four day week but ultimately decided against the move after a three-month study. The UK Labour Party, however, has adopted the four day week as official party policy and pledged to shift the country to it (without loss of pay) by 2029, if they won the December 2019 general election. Since the Labour Party lost the 2019 United Kingdom general election, many have worried that the 4 day work week would be abandoned as Labour policy, but former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn assured many, that the loss is merely a set back and not a vote against the policy. Plymouth based Portcullis Legals also gained significant media exposure in 2019 following their conversion to the four-day working week whilst increasing pay following a 5-month trial and colleague consultation. Portcullis Legals highlighted improvement with productivity and stress levels amongst staff, whilst providing higher levels of satisfaction amongst its clients. =Microsoft Japan= Microsoft Japan conducted a trial 4-day work week in summer 2019, granting workers paid leave on Fridays. At the same time it cut the length of most meetings from a full hour to half an hour, and capped attendance at five employees. For the duration of the trial, the company reported a 23% reduction in electricity costs.4-Day Workweek Boosted Workers' Productivity By 40%, Microsoft Japan Says  See also  * Three-Day Week * 35-hour workweek * Eight-hour day * Furlough * Six-hour day * Working time * Weekend References Human resource management Working time Labor rights ","title":"Four-day week"},{"id":"18573544","text":"Detelinara Stadium is a multi-use stadium in Novi Sad, Vojvodina, Serbia.

He is a member of Freestyle Fellowship along with Aceyalone, Myka 9 and Self Jupiter. He has released two solo albums. History Peace grew up mostly in Los Angeles, California. However, he stated that he lived in Dallas, Texas for about ten years. In elementary school, he played the accordion. He picked up the double bass when he had joined his school's marching band. When he returned to Los Angeles, Peace started playing the saxophone. In an interview, Peace stated he started rapping in his high school years in the mid to late 1980s. One of his friends had told him that there was a guy who rapped just like him at The Good Life Cafe, a local open-mic venue, named Myka 9. Not believing his friend, he went to go check out Myka 9 at The Good Life Cafe. Peace waited around for a while, but Myka 9 didn't show up. So then he got up on stage and performed for a bit and blew a few whigs back. With no luck, Peace had to wait until the next Thursday night. When he returned, Myka 9 was there. Peace listened to him perform and somewhat agreed with his friend. They both had the fast rapping down, but Myka 9 had his own style. Aceyalone was there that night and had asked Peace what his name was. Peace said \\"Mtulazaji\\". Aceyalone then asked what his rap name was and he replied with \\"Peace\\". Released independently and distributed by tape collectors, Freestyle Fellowship's first album To Whom It May Concern... was a landmark. Although it only contains a few songs where they all rap together, each individual rapper's songs truly showcased each of their styles. Peace had two songs, \\"Physical Form\\" and \\"For No Reason\\", on the album. Their second album, Innercity Griots, has been described as \\"an acknowledged underground masterpiece\\". Peace released his first solo album, Southern Fry'd Chicken, in 2000. His second solo album, Megabite, was released in 2004.

Call (September 19, 1843 Truxton, Cortland County, New York ‚Äì April 1929) was an American labor leader and politician. Life On October 1, 1861, he enrolled at Cortland, New York, and was mustered in as corporal of the 76th NY Volunteers to fight in the American Civil War. On December 13, 1862, he was wounded in the Battle of Fredericksburg. In July 1863, he was commissioned a second lieutenant, and in February 1864 a first lieutenant. He was captured in action on May 5, 1864, during the Battle of the Wilderness, later paroled, and discharged in February 1865. After the war, he settled in Syracuse, New York, and worked as a meat cutter, and later ran a meat market and grocery. He was Secretary and Treasurer of the Butchers and Meat Cutters of North America from 1897 to 1917, and a vice president of the American Federation of Labor. In 1912, he ran on the Progressive and Independence League tickets for Secretary of State of New York, but was defeated by Democrat Mitchell May. After the suicide of Treasurer John J. Kennedy on February 15, 1914, neither Democrats nor Republicans had a majority on joint ballot in the New York State Legislature due to the presence of 19 Progressive members. The Progressives offered the Republicans a deal, but were turned down. Then they combined with the Democrats and, on February 25, elected Call New York State Treasurer to fill Kennedy's unexpired term (98 votes for Call, 96 votes for the Republican candidate William Archer) with the understanding that the Democratic officials, including Deputy Treasurer George W. Batten would continue at their posts in the Treasury. In November 1914, Call ran on the Progressive and Independence League tickets for re-election, but was defeated by Republican James L. Wells.

In 1889 he took his first job as principal violist of the Symphony Orchestra in Basel, also playing viola in a string quartet, and later began teaching violin at the local music school. In 1898 he was appointed a violin teacher at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, and was also violist of the Heermann Quartet led by his former teacher. K√ºchler returned to Basel in 1910. The following year became director of a private music school and worked as a choral conductor. From 1927 to 1936 he taught violin at the Landeskonservatorium der Musik zu Leipzig (State Conservatory of Leipzig). K√ºchler wrote textbooks on violin technique and composed instructive pieces for the violin including several student concertos.

The development of national waste strategies is intended to foster a move to sustainability in waste management within the United Kingdom. Structure The Environment Act 1995 added a requirement to the Environmental Protection Act 1990 requiring the Secretary of State, the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, to prepare a National Waste Strategy for England and Wales and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, a Strategy for Scotland.Ss.44A-44B The Strategy must include:Environmental Protection Act 1990, s.44A(4)/ 44B(5) *A statement of policies for attaining the statutory objectives of the 1990 Act; *Provisions relating to: **The type, quantity and origin of waste to be recovered or disposed of; **General technical requirements; and **Any special requirements for particular wastes. The statutory objectives are:Environmental Protection Act 1990, Sch.2A *Ensuring that waste is recovered or disposed of without endangering human health and without using processes or methods which could harm the environment and, in particular, without: **Risk to water, air, soil, plants or animals; **Causing nuisance through noise or odours; or **Adversely affecting the countryside or places of special interest. *Establishing an integrated and adequate network of waste disposal installations, taking account of the best available technology not involving excessive costs *Ensuring that the network referred to above enables: **The European Community as a whole to become self-sufficient in waste disposal, and the Member States individually to move towards that aim, taking into account geographical circumstances or the need for specialised installations for certain types of waste; and **Waste to be disposed of in one of the nearest appropriate installations, by means of the most appropriate methods and technologies in order to ensure a high level of protection for the environment and public health. *Encouraging the prevention or reduction of waste production and its harmfulness, in particular by: **The development of clean technologies more sparing in their use of natural resources; **The technical development and marketing of products designed so as to make no contribution or to make the smallest possible contribution, by the nature of their manufacture, use or final disposal, to increasing the amount or harmfulness of waste and pollution hazards; and **The development of appropriate techniques for the final disposal of dangerous substances contained in waste destined for recovery. England=Waste Strategy 2000 (WS2000)= The first version of the Strategy for England and Wales was published in May 2000. By 2007 Defra reported that: *Recycling and composting of waste had nearly quadrupled since 1996-97, achieving 27% in 2005-06; *The recycling of packaging waste had increased from 27% to 56% since 1998; *Less waste is being landfilled, with a 9% fall between 2000‚Äì01 and 2004‚Äì05; and *Waste growth was being reduced with local authority domestic and business waste collections growing much less quickly than the economy of the United Kingdom at 0.5% per year. =Waste Strategy for England 2007 (WS2007)= WS2000 was superseded by the Waste Strategy for England 2007 which was published in May 2007. The main proposals for England were to: *Incentivise efforts to reduce, re-use, recycle waste and recover energy from waste; *Reform regulation to drive the reduction of waste and diversion from landfill while reducing costs to compliant business and the regulatory agencies; *Target action on materials, products and sectors with the greatest scope for improving environmental and economic outcomes; *Stimulate investment in collection, recycling and recovery infrastructure, and markets for recovered materials that will maximise the value of materials and energy recovered; and *Improve national, regional and local governance, with a clearer performance and institutional framework to deliver better coordinated action and services on the ground. =Waste Management Plan for England (2013)= WS2007 was superseded by the Waste Management Plan for England in December 2013. It did not introduce any new policies or change the landscape of how waste is managed in England. Its core aim was to bring current waste management policies under the umbrella of one national plan. It reports that (at the time of publication) \\"recycling and composting of household waste in England increased to 43% and business recycling rates have increased to 52%. Local authorities, who cover all household waste and some commercial and industrial waste, have reduced the amount of waste they send to landfill by about 60% since 2000.\\" Wales=Wise About Waste: The National Waste Strategy for Wales (2002)= The Welsh Assembly Government published Wales' first national waste strategy in 2002, which replaced WS2000. The targets set in the strategy included those where Wales must meet targets set for the UK in EC Directives, primary Wales specific targets where the Assembly Government and its key partners (e.g. local government) had a direct influence over their outcome and secondary Wales specific targets where the Assembly Government‚Äôs influence is less. =Towards Zero Waste: One Wales. One Planet (2010)= Wales published its updated national waste strategy, Towards Zero Waste, in 2010. It sets out how the Welsh Assembly Government will build on the successes achieved through Wise About Waste, via a long term framework for resource efficiency and waste management between now and 2050. Scotland=National Waste Plan (2003)= Published in 2003, the National Waste Plan established the direction of the Scottish Executive‚Äôs policies for sustainable waste management to 2020. It had the following waste management objectives: *provide widespread segregated kerbside waste collections across Scotland (to over 90% of households by 2020); *aim to stop growth in the amount of municipal waste produced by 2010; *achieve 25% recycling and composting of municipal waste by 2006, and 55% by 2020(35% recycling and 20% composting); *recover energy from 14% of municipal waste; *reduce landfilling of municipal waste from around 90% to 30%; *provide widespread waste minimisation advice to businesses; and *develop markets for recycled material to help recycling become viable and reduce costs. =Scotland's Zero Waste Plan (2010)= The Zero Waste Plan sets the strategic direction for waste policy for Scotland up to 2020. Its objectives include the following: *Target of 70% recycling and maximum 5% to landfill by 2025 for all Scotland‚Äôs waste; *Landfill bans for specific waste types; *Source segregation and separate collection of specific waste types; and *Restrictions on inputs to energy from waste facilities. Northern Ireland=Waste Management Strategy 2000 - 2006= In March 2000 the Department of the Environment published the first waste management Strategy for Northern Ireland. This set out how waste generated should be managed based on the waste hierarchy. =Towards Resource Management: The Northern Ireland Waste Management Strategy 2006 - 2020= In 2006, the Department of the Environment published Towards Resource Management, which focused on the period up to 2020. The strategy highlighted the need to increase waste recycling and recovery in a number of ways that included: *the renewal of recycling targets; *focused awareness campaigns; and *the possible introduction of incentive schemes. =Delivering Resource Efficiency (2013)= The revised waste management strategy entitled Delivering Resource Efficiency was published in 2013. It retains and builds on the core principles of the previous strategy, Towards Resource Management.

Location Bora is located east of Garshankar. It is situated on the Garhshankar - Sri Anand pur Sahib Road. History In the 19th century, between 1800-1820 AD, Shri Mahant Ram, a Digpal Brahmin, came from Garhi Mansowal and purchased or occupied some land. As the time passed people from nearby villages started to come there, and Mahant Ram started selling plots to those people, becoming wealthy in the process. According to the caste norms of the time, Brahmins occupied the center of the developing town, while peasants occupied the East side of the village, and lower castes, the North side of the village. =Etymology= The village was named for the prevalence of banyan trees (\\"boharh\\" in Punjabi) in the area. The banyan trees have since been cut down. Culture=Festivals= Bora celebrates all Hindu and Sikh festivals, including Diwali, Holi, Gurpurab, and Raksha Bandhan, but Janamastami is the most popular festival in the village and is celebrated with great pomp and show by Hindus and Sikhs. On this day Sri Mahakali temple is decorated and the goddess Mahakali is worshipped with prasad prepared by the temple administrators and offered to the goddess. In the 19th century there was a great confusion among the villagers that on which day Mahakali should be worshipped. The people of the Digpal gotra suggested that this holy ceremony should be done on the day of \\"Janamashtami\\". =Houses of worship= Bora is home to several temples: * Sri Mahakali Temple * Sri Sai Baba Temple (Gugga Zahir Peer) * Sri Gugga Marhi Temple * Shivalya (Shiv Mandir) * Do Lathian Wala Mandir (Shivalya) * Bagge Da Mandir There is also a Sikh gurudwara named Gurudwara Chhevi Patshahi Sri Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji.

In 1958, he established the Lester Polakov Studio of Stage Design, later known as the Studio and Forum of Stage Design, where he employed some of the best-known designers of sets, lights, and costumes to teach design. In addition to teaching and overseeing the operation of the school, he continued to design sets and costumes for the stage. In 1993, Polakov published his book, We Live to Paint Again.Polakov, Lester (1993). We Live to Paint Again. Logbooks Press. .Theatre Development Fund website. Lifetime Achievement Award. In 1999, Polakov was the recipient of the Distinguished Achievement Award in Scenery presented to him by the United States Institute for Theatre Technology. His credits include Call Me Mister (1946, scenic design), Crime and Punishment (1947, costume design), The Member of the Wedding (1950, scenic, costume, and lighting design; also replacement stage manager),Carr, Virginia Spencer (2003).

Lifetime Achievement Award. He was a scenic designer who, through his years of working in theatre, gathered together a group of like-minded designers to create a teaching environment that was esteemed, though it was not connected to any university or academic institution.Wilmeth, Don B., editor. Bigsby, Christopher, editor (2000). The Cambridge History of American Theatre. Volume III. Cambridge University Press. p. 522. Through this school, and the corresponding work done by union members of United Scenic Artists l.u. 829 (now a part of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees), they created and promoted the idea of conceptual-based designing. All the teachers in the school were working professionals, usually Broadway-based designers. The list included: Lester Polakov, John Gleason, Tom Skelton and Arden Fingerhut. The school had courses that included scenic design, scenic painting, still-life sketching, costume design and lighting design. Today, none of the original creators of this school survive.

It is a rarely found as an aquarium fish. Although still included as a highly aberrant member of Cichlasoma by FishBase, other authorities such as Catalog of Fishes have moved it to the genus Amphilophus.  Appearance  The three spot cichlid is a large heavy bodied cichlid. It has a green or yellow hue base with the distinct spots on its sides.

The female is smaller growing up to 9-10\\" and a less dominant red spot. The male may also grow a nuchal hump when mature. Distribution and habitat The threespot cichlid is found in slow flowing stretches in the lower river valleys of the rivers of the Pacific Slope of Central America from Mexico to Panama, where there is a muddy or sandy substrate. Here it is found among the roots and weeds. It has been found as an introduced species in Florida and Nevada but these populations were extirpated, and in Singapore.

He also founded and led the Talmudical Yeshiva of Philadelphia together with Rabbi Shmuel Kamenetzky, and co-founded the first yeshiva in Israel for baalei teshuva (returnees to the faith). He taught and influenced tens of thousands of students,\\"Tribute: Harav Dov Schwartzman, zt\\"l\\". Hamodia, 10 November 2011, p. A14. many of whom received semicha (rabbinic ordination) from him and went on to lead their own communities. He was renowned as a Talmudic genius and was conversant in all areas of Torah and Kabbalah. Early life Schwartzman was born in Elul 1921 in Nevel, Russia to Rabbi Yehoshua Zev Schwartzman, a graduate of the Slabodka yeshiva. In the 1930s, his family escaped Communist Russia and immigrated to Tel Aviv, where his father served as a Rav. Schwartzman enrolled in Yeshivas Bais Yosef Novardok and learned under Rabbi Yaakov Yisrael Kanievsky, the Steipler Gaon. In 1933, at age 12, he transferred to the Hebron Yeshiva in the Geula neighborhood of Jerusalem, where his hasmadah (diligence) was evident and widely admired. During one period, he would study for 40 hours at a time. He would begin learning on Sunday morning at 7:00 a.m. and continue straight through till Monday night, with short breaks for prayers and eating. He would sleep on Tuesday night, and then rise early on Wednesday for another 40-hour stretch. His roommate in the yeshiva, Rabbi Michel Yehuda Lefkowitz, never saw him in the room, since Schwartzman would come in after Lefkowitz was sleeping and leave before he awoke. Rabbi Aharon Kotler, rosh yeshiva of Beth Medrash Govoha (the Lakewood Yeshiva), chose him as a son-in-law after visiting Israel and witnessing Schwartzman's genius and diligence. In 1946 Schwartzman came to America to marry Rabbi Kotler's daughter and began learning at the Lakewood Yeshiva, where he led chaburas (small-group learning sessions). In the mid-1950s, as part of Lakewood Yeshiva's effort to establish out-of-town yeshivas, Schwartzman and Rabbi Shmuel Kamenetzky were sent to head the new Talmudic Yeshiva of Philadelphia. In 1955 Schwartzman departed to open his yeshiva in Israel and was replaced as rosh yeshiva by Rabbi Elya Svei. From 1961 to 1962 he was a maggid shiur (lecturer) at Yeshivas Rabbeinu Chaim Berlin. Israeli rosh yeshiva Schwartzman moved back to Israel in the early 1960s. He established a yeshiva in Ramat HaSharon, and in 1965 founded Yeshiva Maron Tzion in the Bayit Vegan neighborhood of Jerusalem, which evolved into Yeshivat Bais HaTalmud, now located in Sanhedria Murhevet; Bais HaTalmud now includes a yeshiva ketana, yeshiva gedola, and kollel. In addition to delivering a daily blatt shiur (lecture on two pages of Gemara) and a weekly shiur klali (lecture to the entire yeshiva), he traveled abroad frequently to raise funds for the yeshiva's upkeep. His lifelong dedication to Torah study produced a scholar who was completely at home in the breadth and depth of Judaism's holy works. He was fluent in the works of the Maharal and had a thorough mastery of Jewish philosophical works, Hasidic thought, and Kabbalah. His shiurim were known for their depth and clarity. In his Gemara shiurim, he presented the pshat (simple understanding of the text) in such a way that it was clear this was indeed the only meaning. He was also known for his Friday- night shiur in the yeshiva on Mizmor Shiur L'Yom HaShabbat, which presented a different explanation each week of Psalm 92. He enlivened his students with his excitement for learning, and also endeared them with his paternal concern for their needs and his pleasant and humble personality. Schwartzman was one of the fathers of the Israeli baal teshuva movement. In the early 1970s, he co-founded the first yeshiva for baalei teshuva, Shema Yisrael, with Rabbi Mendel Weinbach, Rabbi Nota Schiller, and Rabbi Noach Weinberg. After this yeshiva evolved into Ohr Somayach yeshiva, Schwartzman continued on as a rosh yeshiva, delivering shiurim and guiding the staff in establishing policies for the new and untested field of baal teshuva education. Final years Schwartzman's health worsened in his last years, forcing him to give up his duties as rosh yeshiva of Beis HaTalmud. He died on 7 November 2011 (10 Cheshvan 5772) and was buried on the Mount of Olives. Family With his first wife, Schwartzman had three sons and three daughters.

Anchor stores include two Belk locations, as well as JCPenney, Barnes & Noble, and Dick's Sporting Goods, with one vacant anchor store last occupied by Sears. History Mall at Barnes Crossing opened March 7, 1990 as the third mall in the Tupelo area. Original anchor stores included Kmart, Belk, and McRae's, along with JCPenney and Sears. Kmart closed in 1996 and was sold to McRae's, which moved its men's clothing and home goods into the former Kmart while retaining women's clothing, children's apparel, and cosmetics at the existing store.

Part of the National Ramah Commission, Ramah is affiliated with the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism. Camp Ramah in Canada was founded in 1960, and attracts approximately 500 campers each year from Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Israel. Units-Edot Camp Ramah in Canada has the following age units Alonim-Oak Trees (CIT Program entering Grade 11) Magshimim-Fulfillers (Entering Grade 10) Nachshonim-Risk Takers(Entering Grade 9) Tzeirim-Young Ones (Entering Grade 8) K'firim-Lion Cubs(Entering Grade 7) Arazim-Cedar Trees(Entering Grade 6) Nitzanim-Buds(Entering Grade 4/5) Shorashim-Roots(Two week \\"taste\\" program entering Grade 3) Garinim- Seeds(Weekend \\"taste\\" program entering Grade 2) Yom Sport Camp Ramah in Canada is known for their intense colour war, also known as Yom Sport. Each year, the Alonimers plan a colour war complete with a detailed theme, heads, judges, captains, Marathon, and decorated Beit Am Gadol (the largest building onsite). The BAG is used for opening and closing ceremonies, to begin the festivities, tell the story of the theme, and introduce the Roshes, Judges and captains. Each team is assigned 2 colours, with each edah being divided shortly after dinner, leaving everyone to frantically get dressed before opening ceremonies. Captains, Roshes, and Judges The Alonimers have the opportunity to campaign for the position of Captain, Rosh, and Judge. There are two Roshes, one boy and one girl, 4 judges, two boys and two girls, and 8 captains, a boy and girl for each of the 4 teams. The Captains and Roshes each prepare a 1-minute speech filled with costumes and cheering in an effort to gain votes from their edah for said position. The Judge applicants must write either an essay or make a video submitted to their staff before the summer starts. Marathon The last activity of Yom sport is Marathon, a two-hour race of challenges around camp to be performed by each team. A coloured baton (with team colours) must be carried throughout the entire Marathon, if dropped, the task must be completed again, or it will result in a time penalty. Accompanying the captains for the entire marathon is one of 4 judges, and a \\"runner\\" someone on Va'ad marathon selected to ensure everything is completed fairly. The Marathon usually ends with everyone separated by teams on the migrash, and a puzzle to be completed by the Magshimimers in order to raise the team's flag. Traditionally, the winner of Marathon will not win Yom Sport. (exceptions include 2016) Magshimimers Since it is their last Yom Sport as campers, Magshimimers take the day very seriously, and it can be quite emotional. Each captain has the option to \\"draft\\" a Magshimimer to their team, usually a friend or someone they see as a future captain. Each magshimimer receives a braided bracelet in team colours, tied and kissed by their captains. If the bracelet falls off in the middle of the year, another Yom Sport captain, not necessarily their own), must tie it back on and kiss it again. It is a tradition for magshimimers to stand on the poles outside the BAG cheering the team's colours in Hebrew before opening ceremonies. Magshimimers are an integral part of Marathon, and have a huge responsibility in the final stages. Cheers There are 4 main Yom Sport Cheers: Unga La Bunga, Zoopa Loopa Loopa, HaRishonah, and Ay Eloway. There are additionally secondary cheers ranging from Coach Carter to Hail to the Victors, and new ones made up each year by the Edah. The pairs of captains draw numbers from a hat to determine first pick for team colours, with last choice colours picking main cheers first, and vice versa. Every cheer for one team is written on a decorated cheer sheet. Judging Each year, the 4 judges come up with a \\"judge's secret\\" that determines the winner. The winner is announced to the captains minutes before closing ceremonies, during which the captains jump out from behind painted butcher paper. Camping Trips Ramah Canada offers camping trips in each edah (age group). In Niztanim through Kfirim, the trips are one night at a campsite owned by Ramah on Skeleton Lake, Georia, High Lake, or Ramah Island. The trips increase in duration and difficulty with each edah, with Alonim trips taking place for 6 days in Ontario Parks such as Algonquin, Killarney, and Temagami. Camping trips are canoe trips, taking advantage of Muskoka Lakes. Camp Ramah Outdoor Adventure Camp in the Colorado Rockies was inspired by the Tripping programs at Ramah Canada. \\"Camps struggle to contain swine flu\\", The Toronto Star, July 15, 2009 ReferencesExternal links *National Ramah Commission *Website Canada Youth organizations based in Canada Buildings and structures in the District Municipality of Muskoka Jewish summer camps in Canada Jews and Judaism in Ontario Conservative Judaism in Canada ","title":"Camp Ramah in Canada"},{"id":"18573990","text":"The Los Angeles Limited on its first run in 1905 The Los Angeles Limited was a named passenger train in the United States. It was operated by the Union Pacific Railroad from 1905 to 1954.  History  1920 newspaper ad for the train. Beginning in 1905 the Los Angeles Limited was the flagship train of the Union Pacific between Chicago and Los Angeles. (From Chicago to Omaha the train was handled by the Chicago and North Western Railway). Union Pacific, which owned the train, completed the trip via Cheyenne, Ogden, Salt Lake City, Las Vegas and San Bernardino. In early years the schedule was 68‚Äì74 hours; in November 1926 the schedule dropped to 63 hours each way to justify a $10 extra charge (which ended in June 1929). = Equipment = The buffet-smoking car, circa 1909. Until 1948, the cars had a black roof, dark Pullman-green body with yellow lettering, and black trucks. In 1948 the Union Pacific painted all of its heavyweight fleet in a two-tone gray paint scheme to match Pullman's lease passenger car equipment which were also being painted in the two-tone gray paint scheme. By 1952, all of Union Pacific's heavyweight passenger cars were painted in the amour yellow and gray to match the rest of the railroad's streamlined passenger cars. During this time, many streamlined and heavyweight cars were seen mixed into the LA Limited's consist, while some of the two-tone gray paint scheme was visible; since it took some time to repaint all of the heavyweight equipment Union Pacific's large rail network. In the beginning the cars of the train were wood; after 1912 steel heavyweight cars started to replace the wooden cars. Until 1936 the Los Angeles Limited was the top train of the Union Pacific as a rival to other Chicago to Los Angeles trains such as Santa Fe's California Limited, De Luxe, Chief, and the Southern Pacific's Rock Island Golden State Limited. In 1930 the train started carrying coaches for the first time because of the Great Depression. After the more economical secondary train Challenger was introduced in 1935, the train regained its all- Pullman status and once again became a very fine train; in 1936 it was the first Union Pacific heavyweight train to receive air conditioning. But in 1936 the Los Angeles Limited lost its prestigious premier status to the new City of Los Angeles streamliner, which became the new Union Pacific flagship train. The Los Angeles Limited became the secondary Chicago-to-Los Angeles train, but was the only Union Pacific all-Pullman train on that route (the City of Los Angeles streamliner always carried some coaches). After the City of Los Angeles went daily in 1947 the train resumed handling coaches, this time forever. In 1948 lightweight streamliner cars with four-wheel trucks began appearing, usually not more than five. = Ridership decline = In the 1950s ridership on the Los Angeles Limited declined rapidly. Sleeping car passengers could enjoy more modern streamlined sleeping cars on a faster schedule on the City of Los Angeles, which took 39-3/4 hours Chicago to LA while the Los Angeles Limited needed 45 hours. In January 1954 the once-proud flagship was replaced by a new Challenger with lightweight coaches and sleepers on a fast schedule.  Motive Power  In the early years of the Los Angeles Limited's service, the train's primary motive power was an ALCO 4-6-2 Pacific type. In the early 1920s, the train was upgraded with newer steel, heavyweight passenger cars leased from Pullman, which caused troublesome for the Pacific types to keep schedule, especially through Echo Canyon and Cajon Pass. The Union Pacific responded by purchasing 39 4-8-2 Mountain types from ALCO. These locomotives exceeded UP's expectations. They became the primary motive power for the train until 1937, when UP began purchasing 4-8-4 Northern types, famously known as the FEF-1; to pull the train between Ogden and Omaha. The Mountain types maintained being the primary power between Ogden and Los Angeles until 1946 when the FEF's were all converted to oil in response to the coal strikes that broke out across the nation. Between Omaha and Chicago, the Chicago & Northwestern Railroad pulled the train with an ALCO 4-6-4 Hudson type.

The six English language translations provided are Wiclif's (1380), William Tyndale's (1534), Cranmer's (the Great Bible 1539), the Geneva Bible (1557), Rheims (1582), and the Authorised version, or King James Bible (1611), arranged in columns underneath. The term \\"hexapla\\" signifies \\"six-fold\\" or \\"six-columned\\", and describes the arrangement of the six English versions underneath the Greek text in the book. The term \\"hexapla\\" is also applied to Origen's 3rd century edition of the Old Testament, which present six versions of the old testament, in Hebrew, Hebrew in Greek letters, Aquila of Sinope's Greek version, Symmachus the Ebionite's version, the LXX or Septuagint, and Theodotion's version. The English Hexapla was published in 1841 by Samuel Bagster and Sons, of Paternoster Row, London, who are described on the title page as being a \\"warehouse for Bibles, New Testaments, Prayer-books, Lexicons, Grammars, Concordances, and Psalters, in ancient and modern languages.\\" Greek text The Greek text usedAccording to the English Hexapla itself, page 162 is that of Dr. M. A. Scholz, compiled between 1830 and 1836, but is itself based largely on the work of Griesbach, who published several editions of the Greek New Testament between 1775 and 1805.  Translation texts  The edition of Wiclif's translation is based on a manuscript belonging to the then late Duke of Sussex. The edition of William Tyndale's translation is one revised and published by Tyndale himself in 1534, provided by the Baptist College in Bristol. Cranmer's Bible is actually the Great Bible, with a preface written by Cranmer for the second edition in 1540. The version in the English Hexapla is reprinted from a first edition of the Great Bible published in 1539, also provided by the Baptist College in Bristol. The Geneva New Testament is reprinted from a first edition published in 1557. The Rheims edition, also referred to as the \\"Anglo-Rhemish\\" translation, is reprinted from the original edition of 1582. This is a Roman Catholic translation from the Vulgate, first published by the English College at Rheims in that year. The Authorised version (or the King James Version) used is from a black letter (or gothic script) copy from the year 1611, provided by the Reverend John Henry Montagu Luxmoore. The Authorised version underwent some revision in 1762 and 1769, with current Authorised versions being the 1769 Oxford University edition virtually unchanged.

Geological and geophysical datasets, such as lithological, structural and topographical maps, aeromagnetic, gravity and radiometric imagery are the typical datasets used in the construction of prospectivity maps. There are two main approaches to prospectivity mapping: data-driven and knowledge-driven. In areas with significant known mineralisation, a data- driven approach can be adopted in which known deposits are analysed in relation to the surrounding geology. A number of parametric and non-parametric statistical tests can be used to determine if identified spatial relationships are considered statistically significant. Important relationships are then spatially quantified over the entire region of interest. Ultimately multiple quantified relationships are combined, typically using a geographic information system (GIS) into a single prospectivity map. In areas with little known mineralisation, a knowledge-driven approach can be implemented in which a mineral-systems approach is used in which theories about the formation of the deposit are identified, spatially quantified and then combined using a GIS. Prospectivity mapping can be constructed using a mix of data-driven and knowledge-driven components and these are often referred to as hybrid prospectivity maps.

The Igbo produce a wide variety of art including traditional figures, masks, artifacts and textiles, plus works in metals such as bronze. Artworks from the Igbo have been found from as early as 9th century with the bronze artifacts found at Igbo Ukwu. With processes of colonization and imperialism, the vocabulary of fine art and art history came to interact with established traditions. Therefore, the term can also refer to contemporary works of art produced in response to global demands and interactions. The relative lack of centralization that characterized Igbo forms of governance has resulted in greater difficulties in terms of the scholarly study of artistic productions. Lacking the expansive and hierarchical as well as widespread mythology of, for example, the Yoruba, Igbo art is more localized. As such, general studies of Igbo art do not exist. An added difficulty in studying Igbo art is that there is no clear consensus on who counts as being a member of the Igbo culture. There is often a tension between self-identification and external classification which means that the identity is fluid and continually re-negotiated. Understanding the developments of Igbo art production is often hindered by the assumption that forms of \\"traditional\\" art remain unchanging. Many art pieces were stolen during the colonial period. In 2020, art historian Okeke-Agulu called on auction house Christie's to cancel its planned Paris sale of two Igbo sculptures, which were stolen during colonialism. The auction went ahead. Masks Masks have been used for a variety of purposes within Igbo culture in both historic and modern times. For specific segments of the Igbo population, some mask pairs have been traditionally interpreted as representing the duality of beauty and ugliness. The former being depicted as the maiden spirit and the latter as the elephant spirit. Anthropologist Simon Ottenberg also ties masquerade performances to a duality, but he sees their function as primarily relating to gender difference and the initiation ritual during which Igbo boys become men. Young women are excluded from performing and are, therefore, passive witnesses. The rituals associated with mask- wearing establish and maintain gender difference. Additionally, the experience of ritual mask-wearing is related to the alleviation of sexual and social anxieties that result from the boy moving from his childhood home and away from his mother. Within some portions of northern Nigeria, Igbo communities continue to utilize masquerade events in order to maintain connections with the deceased. Masks become physical embodiments of those no longer living which facilitates the flow of blessings and knowledge between generations. Knowledge of the secret aspects of the ritual are limited to initiated men who then have access to the supernatural tools necessary to contend with pressing socio-cultural concerns. Overall, however, the ceremonies serve as the site for important processes of communal healing, continuity, and connection. Joy is intermixed with grief as the living are able to again interact with those that have been lost. Maiden Spirit helmet mask of Agbogho Mmuo The use of masks within Igbo culture has been usually portrayed as an uninterrupted tradition or as a tradition impossibly altered by cross-cultural interactions. More recent scholarship, however, perceives contemporary Igbo masquerade performance to be the product of selectively-adapted external influences that perpetuate the traditional aims of the activity. As such, they should not be considered new and unique art forms but rather the result of the adaptation of imported elements. Pre-colonial conceptions of aesthetic experience and artistic goals were re-worked and understood through new paradigms introduced by cross-cultural movements. For contemporary viewers of masks within the context of museums, the inability to see such sculptures in motion as part of performances makes understanding difficult. The effect intended by the artist in terms of experience is limited to the one static perspective that display permits. The exhibiting of masks emphasizes the object itself which is not always the most important aspect of the multimedia and multisensory ritual performance. Without the full costume and the atmosphere of music, spoken or sung word, and physical movements, the full meaning of masks is lost. The same physical object, when placed in different performance contexts, can symbolize different things which makes interpretations difficult after collection. = Eze Nwanyi mask = Otherwise known as the Queen of Women, this mask represents a wealthy, senior wife and grandmother who commands enormous respect in the village. She embodies the ultimate feminine ideals of strength, wisdom, beauty, stature and dignity, and is a leader among women. This mask is worn in performances that occur at funerals and ceremonies that purify the village and other communal places. = Agbogho mmuo = Agbogho mmuo, or Maiden Spirit masquerades perform annually during the dry season in the Nri- Awka area of northern Igboland. At these performances men dance as adolescent girls, miming and exaggerating the girls' beauty and comportment. The performance is also accompanied by musicians who sing tributes to both real and spirit maidens. The following are examples of quotes that may be heard during a performance : Mmanwu si n‚Äôigwe: The masked spirit from the sky Udemu na lenu: My fame is potent These masks showcase an ideal image of an Igbo maiden. This ideal is made up by the smallness of a young girl‚Äôs features and the whiteness of her complexion, which is an indication that the mask is a spirit. This whiteness is created using a chalk substance used for ritually marking the body in both West Africa and the African Diaspora. The chalky substance is also used in uli design, created and exhibited on the skin of Igbo women. Some maiden spirit masks have elaborate coiffeurs, embellished with representations of hair combs, and other objects, modeled after late 19th century ceremonial hairstyles.  Igbo Ukwu (Bronzes)  Anklet beaten from a solid brass bar of the type worn by Igbo women. Now in the collection of Wolverhampton Art Gallery. The leg-tube extends approx 7cm each side of the 35cm disc. Igbo-Ukwu Alice Apley says: \\"It is possible that the inhabitants of Igbo Ukwu had a metalworking art that flourished as early as the ninth century.\\" (though this date remains controversial). Three sites have been excavated, revealing hundreds of ritual vessels and regalia castings of bronze or leaded bronze that are among the most inventive and technically accomplished bronzes ever made. The people of Igbo-Ukwu, ancestors of present- day Igbo, were the earliest smithers of copper and its alloys in West Africa, working the metal through hammering, bending, twisting, and incising. They are likely among the earliest groups of West Africans to employ the lost-wax casting techniques in the production of bronze sculptures. Oddly, evidence suggests that their metalworking repertory was limited and Igbo smiths were not familiar with techniques such as raising, soldering, riveting, and wire making, though these techniques were used elsewhere on the continent.  Pottery  In addition to the famous bronzes, clay vessels were discovered at the Igbo Ukwu archeological site that bear striking resemblance in terms of design to those produced during the twentieth century. The most common type in this long legacy of production is the narrow-mouth bottle design. This kind of container usually has two lug handles, one on either side, which may indicate that the objects were suspended using rope. Another possibility is that the handles could be used as the anchoring points for ropes that held a stopper in place. Often decorated with various colors and motifs, contemporary vessels are used for both practical utilitarian purposes such as carrying water or storing foods and ceremonial purposes. Popular Western perceptions of art as works removed from daily life have resulted in a misunderstanding of the abstract meanings applied to potted vessels in the Igbo tradition. Clay objects often have physical uses but also spiritual and aesthetic uses. Decoration is often seen as superficial but has complex associations. Unfortunately, the removal of the objects from their original context inhibits the degree to which meaning can be reconstructed. The practical and artistic qualities of the works are complementary but display strips clay vessels of their everyday uses. It has been argued the process of shaping the natural material of clay is a starting point for aesthetic and metaphysical value within the Igbo culture. Ethnographic studies have demonstrated that the production of traditional Igbo pottery has declined as a result of the spread of Western technologies. The heightened cross-cultural connections in the period immediately following de-colonization led to a period of peak production. Eventually, however, the more widespread acceptance of modern influence coinciding with intense economic development resulted in the extinction of Igbo pottery in some areas. The traditional importance of the vessels in some locales has been cited as a driving force for continued production despite the influx of mass-produced containers.  Uli  Uli is the name given to the traditional designs drawn by the Igbo people of Nigeria. Uli drawings are strongly linear and lack perspective; they do, however, balance positive and negative space. Designs are frequently asymmetrical, and are often painted spontaneously. Uli generally is not sacred, apart from those images painted on the walls of shrines and created in conjunction with some community rituals. The drawing of uli was once practiced throughout most of Igboland, although by 1970 it had lost much of its popularity, and was being kept alive by a handful of contemporary artists. It was usually practiced by women, who would decorate each other's bodies with dark dyes to prepare for village events, such as marriage, title taking, and funerals; designs would sometimes be produced for the most important market days as well. Designs would last about a week.  Carved doors  Contemporary carved Igbo door in Awka-Etiti Gordon Campbell saysThe carved wooden doors establish the boundary between the inner space of the structure and the area outside. The visibility of the works and their location on the boundary permit them to serve as both a warning and an invitation to the viewer. As markers of status within the Ozo society, the carvings act as visual representations of the status and privileges of the household. In consideration of the house as a reflection of the human body or entire cosmos, the door have been equated to the human skin which provides structure and order. Mbari Igbo art is noted for Mbari architecture. Mbari houses of the Owerri-Igbo are large opened-sided square planned shelters. They house many life-sized, painted figures (sculpted in mud to appease the Alusi (deity) and Ala, the earth goddess, with other deities of thunder and water). Other sculptures are of officials, craftsmen, foreigners (mainly Europeans), animals, legendary creatures and ancestors. Mbari houses take years to build in what is regarded as a sacred process. When new ones are constructed, old ones are left to decay. Everyday houses were made of mud and thatched roofs with bare earth floors with carved design doors. Some houses had elaborate designs both in the interior and exterior. These designs could include Uli art designed by Igbo women. In Mbari houses, there is a close relationship between where material objects are placed within the domestic environment and their symbolic significance. Domains within the house reflect societal dynamics outside on the house. The house delineates the private space from the public space, and within the house itself, male and female spaces exist through the work performed. Accordingly, the objects within the gendered sections gain meaning through the associations with the work and activities that occur there. Mbari houses are seen as taking on a larger societal significance beyond just being shelters. They become reflections of the cosmos and a cycle of rebirth.

He was the president of Republika Srpska from late 1998 to 1999. He was removed by the High Representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Carlos Westendorp, on 5 March 1999. The removal was enforced on 2 September 1999. Following his removal from the presidency, he also worked as a member of the Senate of Republika Srpska. He testified as a defense witness for Radovan Karad≈æiƒá in his trial. Bosnian War Following the outbreak of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Popla≈°en left Sarajevo with his family to work for the newly-formed government of Republika Srpska in Pale. There he served as a member of the Advisory of Serb Democratic Party and also personally advised Radovan Karad≈æiƒá. However, he left SDS in 1992 and founded the Serbian Radical Party of Republika Srpska. Subsequently, he worked as a commissioner for the government of Republika Srpska in Vogo≈°ƒáa up to December 1992. He saw combat and was formally given the title of a Chetnik Vojvoda by Vojislav ≈†e≈°elj. Political career Popla≈°en ran as the Serbian Radical Party candidate in the 1998 Republika Srpska election. He beat Biljana Plav≈°iƒá and was elected president of Republika Srpska on 13 September 1998. His victory was received negatively by the government of the United States, which supported Plav≈°iƒá during the election. High Representative Westendorp stated that he would recognize Popla≈°en's victory on the condition that he does not name Momƒçilo Kraji≈°nik as Prime Minister. In November 1998, Popla≈°en attempted to appoint Dragan Kaliniƒá as Prime Minister. However this was rejected by the Office of the High Representative. On 5 March 1999, Westendorp dismissed Popla≈°en after he refused to give Milorad Dodik a new mandate as Prime Minister. Additionally, Westendorp also removed Brƒçko from Republika Srpska's control, moving it into the administration of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Republika Srpska's National Assembly responded with a vote to cut off relations with Bosnia and Herzegovina, and also ruled that both of Westendorp's decisions were unconstitutional and defied the Dayton Agreement. CBS reported that thousands protested Popla≈°en's removal in Doboj. In an ironic development, Dodik resigned as Prime Minister in protest of the decision to remove Brƒçko from Republika Srpska's control. Later career Popla≈°en was appointed as a member of the board for the Agency for Development of Higher Education of Bosnia and Herzegovina in November 2015. His appointment was controversial given his background in the war and also due to the unexpected votes he received from some members of the Party of Democratic Action and the Democratic Front.

In his youth, he was involved in the radical underground organisation Brit HaKanaim, which sought to establish a Halakhic state in Israel by imposing Jewish religious law in the country. In 1949, he was amongst the founders of moshav Komemiyut, and later helped found two youth villages, Sde Hemed (now a moshav) and Hazon Yehezkel (now named Aluma).Shlomo Lorincz: Public Activities Knesset website In 1956 he helped found the Housing and Development company of Agudat Yisrael.

In 1963 she made her first international appearances with Vancouver Opera and the Israeli Opera in Tel Aviv. In 1972, she returned to the City Opera, again in Susannah. Later the same year, she appeared in Le nozze di Figaro at the Wolf Trap Farm Park, with Treigle, Curtin and Susanne Marsee in the cast. She also appeared in a number of productions with the Th√©√¢tre de la Monnaie in Brussels during the 1975-1976 season. Among the roles she sang with these companies included Bess in Porgy and Bess, Gilda in Rigoletto, Juliette in Rom√©o et Juliette, Lucy in The Telephone, the title heroine in Massenet's Manon, Marguerite in Faust, the title role in Flotow's Martha, Mimi in La Boh√®me, Olympia (the doll) in Les contes d'Hoffmann, Pamina in The Magic Flute, Shemakhan Tsaritsa in The Golden Cockerel, Violetta in La Traviata, and many of the roles she portrayed in New York City.

He was the SNP's longest serving Glasgow councillor, and during his term, he led many protests against Labour's moves to weaken effective opposition by altering the council committee system. In his ward, he attended a wide variety of community groups, including Garrowhill and Swinton Community Councils, local school boards, tenants association, and Garrowhill Action Partnership. He was also on the management committee of Tenant Controlled Housing, which aims to give local tenants control of their housing, in place of Glasgow Housing Association (GHA).  Parliamentarian =Member of Parliament= On 30 June 2008, David Marshall, Labour MP for Glasgow East, resigned from the UK Parliament on the grounds of ill-health, thereby triggering a by-election. The decision by Labour to call a quick by- election (set for 24 July 2008) was partly attributed to Labour's troubled finances and fears of an SNP campaign building up enough momentum. John Mason was selected as SNP candidate for Glasgow East on 3 July. During the by- election, the candidate stance on abortion was displayed on noticeboards in catholic churches; Mason was reported to be opposed to abortion occurring for social reasons. Mason won the by-election in a surprise victory, defeating the Labour candidate Margaret Curran, MSP for Glasgow Baillieston.Labour concedes defeat in Glasgow East by-election , The Herald, 25 July 2008 He overturned a Labour majority of more than 13,500 to win the seat on a swing of more than 22%. It was Labour's third-safest seat in Scotland. Mason resigned his council seat immediately after his election as MP. Mason served as the SNP's Westminster spokesperson on Work and Pensions during his tenure as an MP. From 2009 until losing his seat in 2010, he also sat on the House of Commons' Select Committee on Administration. In an interview with the Guardian newspaper in April 2010, when questioned about his Protestant religious beliefs, and how that could conflict with the rights of others in the UK, Mason acknowledged the difficulty that this issue raised with him, informing the newspaper that he had been warned to leave this issue alone by his party, = Member of the Scottish Parliament = In the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, he won the Glasgow Shettleston constituency with a majority of 586 votes. During the debate on same-sex marriage in Scotland, Mason was widely condemned for raising a motion stating that no person or organisation should be forced to be involved or to approve of same-sex marriage. In January 2015 he spoke in parliament in favour of young Earth creationism. He was re-elected in 2016. Controversies In February 2016, he publicly asked \\"How is national debt different from national deficit?\\" on Twitter, prompting The Spectator to say that he \\"appears to lack a basic understanding of finance\\". In January 2017, he tweeting \\"Girls don't always say yes first time\\" leading to criticism that his comments were sexist and trivialised \\"rape culture\\" by Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale, the Scottish Conservatives and the President of NUS Scotland, Vonnie Sandlan. Mason defended his comment as innocent and reflected the fact that \\"asking a girl for a relationship or to dinner, they don't always say yes the first time.\\" In February 2017, The First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon apologised to the families of three Scottish IRA murder victims after Mason had claimed members of the terrorist organisation could be considered freedom fighters. Mason apologised for his comments after a meeting with the SNP's Scottish Parliament chief whip Bill Kidd. In May 2018, Mason was criticised for comparing the child sexual abuse by former Celtic F.C. employees to tax avoidance schemes. Mason defended his comments. In September 2019, he tabled a motion called \\"Both Lives Matter\\", which called for abortion to be restricted. In March 2020, he came under criticism for refusing to follow Scottish Government advice and keeping his parliamentary office open to the public during the COVID-19 pandemic. In May 2020, he came under fire for proposing a motion that the Scottish Parliament should \\"recognise the sacrifices\\" the armed forces make, the Parliament should \\"believe that some people use Armed Forces' Day to celebrate military might and power for the promotion of what considers to be an unhealthy British nationalism\\". Leading to criticism from opposition parties that it was \\"deeply disrespectful\\" to the armed forces. Mason defending his proposed motion stating: \\"I think my motion is clear in that I fully support the armed forces and am happy that we celebrate them.\\" Personal interests Mason is a supporter of the Scottish football club Clyde F.C.. His other interests include involvement in Easterhouse Baptist Church, hill-walking, camping, and reading Scottish history.

Langdell has defended these practices, stating that Edge has only sued two companies since the late 1980s. In 2010, Edge Games sued Electronic Arts for trademark infringement, but eventually settled, with Edge surrendering many of its registrations. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) cancelled the trademarks by court order in April 2013.  History  Edge Games was founded in California in 1990 by Tim Langdell. At that time, it acquired the intellectual property assets of Langdell's former company, Softek Software, itself founded in 1980 in London. Softek's catalog includes several games, such as: Fairlight, released in 1985, and Garfield: Big Fat Hairy Deal, released in 1987. Since the 1989 release of Snoopy and Peanuts Edge Games have released nine games in the last 25 years.  Trademark disputes  Edge Games has been involved in a number of disputes over trademarks connected to the word \\"edge\\". = Edge (iOS game) = In May 2009, French indie game developer Mobigame had their iOS title Edge removed from Apple's App Store in the US and the UK due to lawsuit threats by Tim Langdell. According to Mobigame, the dispute arose while they were trying to register a trademark for Edge in the US, while Langdell claims he owns the global trademark on \\"Edge\\". According to the email dialogue between Langdell and Mobigame head David Papazian, shared with Eurogamer, Langdell delivered an ultimatum to Mobigame in exchange for a promise not to litigate. If they changed the game's name, he demanded 25% of the game's revenue for the time the title was on sale under the name \\"Edge\\", and if they licensed the Edge name, they would give him 10% of the game's revenue in perpetuity and subtitle it \\"An Homage To Bobby Bearing\\", with the Edge Games logo on the title screen. Papazian claims that he suggested the alternative title \\"Edgy\\", but that this was rejected by Langdell for being too similar to \\"Edge\\". Edge Games subsequently registered \\"Edgy\\" as a trademark. An Edge Games spokesperson, writing from Tim Langdell's personal email address and signing off as \\"Tim Langdell\\", claims that their registration was the result of a misunderstanding \\"probably in part caused by David Papazian's less than perfect English\\". However, many journalists who talked with David Papazian confirmed that Papazian's English is \\"absolutely flawless\\". On June 18, 2009, it was reported that the game had been restored to the App Store with its original name intact, though later reports indicated that the game had once again been pulled in July 2009, and Mobigame confirmed that they had voluntarily withdrawn the game while considering their options. Mobigame's lawyer, speaking to Eurogamer, stated that \\"Mobigame's position is that the trademarks owned by Edge Games are not enforceable against Mobigame or any third party in respect of the distribution of the Edge game,\\" because \\"there is unlikely to be any confusion or association between them and Mobigame's game\\" and those trademarks \\"are liable to be revoked\\". Soon after, Edge Games published an \\"open letter\\" on its website claiming that several of the statements in the Eurogamer article were false. Mobigame's lawyers issued a response to the effect that the Eurogamer article is accurate and that Edge Games's rebuttal is false, and stated that they were gathering evidence to demonstrate that communications Edge Games claims, in its rebuttal, to have made did not actually occur.Mobigame: ‚ÄòEdge Games‚Äôs open letter is false‚Äô, Pocket Gamer The game was eventually put back on the App Store in UK and US markets on October 7, 2009, under the title Edge by Mobigame. Speaking with Kotaku, Papazian said, \\"On the legal side, (Langdell) cannot claim anything against \\"Edge by Mobigame\\" and Apple knows that, so we hope everything will be alright now.\\" On November 26, 2009, Edge by Mobigame was again removed from the App Store. An unnamed Edge Games representative stated \\"Adding 'by Mobigame' was determined not to get around infringement.\\" On December 1, 2009, the game returned to the App Store under the name Edgy, but Mobigame soon removed it for fear that Langdell would use the legal precedent in his legal battle against EA. In May 2010, the game returned to the App store under the name Edge. Mobigame had the following to say regarding the ongoing legal battle: = Electronic Arts petition for trademark cancellation = Electronic Arts (EA) petitioned the United Stated Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to cancel a range of registrations associated with Edge Games and Future Publishing on September 11, 2009. EA stated that it had filed the petition because Edge Games had \\"continuously\\" threatened legal action with respect to the title of EA's 2008 game Mirror's Edge, and that the trademarks had either been obtained by fraud or abandoned through nonuse. Edge Games' Tim Langdell responded that Edge Games had not threatened EA with legal action, and that the two companies had been in amicable settlement talks over EA's use of the mark \\"Mirror's Edge\\" since late 2008. Langdell added that the 2008 federal court case Edge Games, Inc. v. Velocity Micro, Inc. had ruled that Edge had not obtained any of its trademarks by fraud, nor abandoned them through nonuse. Prior to filing their petition, EA voluntarily abandoned their application for the \\"Mirror's Edge\\" mark on September 8, 2009. Edge Games filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against EA over the \\"Mirror's Edge\\" mark in June 2010. Almost a year later, and after a case in the UK court against Future, Langdell claimed that Edge Games filed the lawsuit against EA at the insistence of its trademark partner Future Publishing. Edge Games charged EA with engaging in willful infringement and unfair competition, and requested damages and a court injunction against further infringement. EA responded with a counterclaim to cancel Edge Games' trademarks, and argued that Edge Games obtained the trademarks based on fraudulent representations to the USPTO including doctored submissions of magazine covers and game boxes. EA added that the trademarks had not been in commercial use at the time of registration. The judge denied Edge Games' request for an injunction in October 2010, stating that Edge Games had abandoned use of its marks, misrepresented its case to the USPTO, and not shown their use of the trademarks to \\"legitimately extend beyond trolling various gaming-related industries for licensing opportunities.\\" EA and Edge Games reached a settlement in early October, where Edge Games would surrender the trademarks \\"edge\\" (registered twice), \\"cutting edge\\", \\"the edge\\", and \\"gamer's edge\\". No damages were awarded to EA or Edge Games, and each would pay their own legal fees. The settlement stipulated that neither party admitted fault or wrongdoing and that no party was found guilty of wrongdoing. On October 10, 2010, it was reported that the settlement had been approved by the judge, and a final order had been issued. The USPTO cancelled the five \\"Edge\\" trademarks on April 9, 2013. =Future Publishing breach= In 2011, it was revealed that Future Publishing, the publisher of game magazine Edge, had brought suit against Langdell in the United Kingdom for breach of contract, breach of copyright, and passing off through the use of the magazine's logo for Edge Games and his representations of his connection with the magazine. Future had licensed the trademark for the use of the word \\"Edge\\" in magazines from Langdell in 1993, when launching the magazine. The publisher bought the relevant part of the trademark from Langdell outright in 2005. In the intervening years, Future claimed, Langdell had co-opted the magazine's logo as his own, and claimed to have been involved in the creation or publication of the magazine. The action succeeded in all claims, in a decision that described Langdell's own evidence as \\"invention\\", \\"incredible\\", \\"totally unconvincing\\", and \\"concocted\\". During the trial, Langdell claimed he invented the Edge logo in 1991, prior to the magazine's launch in 1993, and submitted a floppy disk from 1991 containing a file with the logo. However, Future's expert found the disk's contents were created using Windows 95. The judge summarized: \\"Dr Langdell concocted disk 1 in support of his claim that he had invented the EDGE logo in 1991. When this was exposed by the claimant's expert he constructed an elaborate explanation and created disk 3, having learned from the Report how to avoid the mistakes he made the first time.\\" In two lengthy missives sent to online games publications, Langdell indicated that he had lodged an appeal, placing the blame for his actions with Future and the responsibility for his loss with a \\"gullible\\" judge who had made \\"almost 100 errors of fact and law\\". Future, in turn, indicated that it had not been served with any new proceedings but had received permission to pursue contempt of court proceedings against Langdell. Edge Games was ultimately denied permission to appeal. Subsequently, the company applied to have Future's UK trademarks assigned to it, with Langdell signing on behalf of both Future Publishing and Edge Games. This application was rejected. = Other = In 2001, Edge Games sought revocation of Namco's United Kingdom trademark \\"Soul Edge\\" (for the arcade game Soul Edge) for reasons including an alleged similarity between the \\"Edge\\" and \\"Soul Edge\\" marks. The opposition failed on all grounds. Nevertheless, Namco had already decided to use the name Soul Blade for the PlayStation version in the United States and Europe to avoid potential complications, with the name Soulcalibur being used on all sequels for the same reason. In March 2009, Cybernet Systems Corporation filed a lawsuit in Federal court against Edge. In the suit, Cybernet states that they were contacted by Tim Langdell beginning in January 2009 and that he asserted his ownership of the term \\"Edge.\\" The suit also alleges that Langdell asserted his right to have the trademark for Cybernet's \\"Edge of Extinction\\" game assigned to Edge Games, and his further right to require Cybernet to enter into a paid license agreement with him due to their use of the name. Cybernet refused, and when Langdell threatened a lawsuit, Cybernet instead filed suit against Edge. \\"Edge of Extinction\\" was released in 2001, and is no longer an active game. As of June 1, 2009, Edge Games applied for a US trademark for the phrase, \\"Edge of Twilight.\\" This is the name of an upcoming steampunk fantasy game that has been in development by Fuzzyeyes Studios for at least two years. In addition, Edge Games has been a plaintiff in lawsuits with New World Computing over their title Planet's Edge, Marvel Entertainment over their titles Cutting Edge, Double Edge, and Over the Edge, Sony Entertainment over their PlayStation Edge, Edge Tech Corporation over their \\"The Edge\\" hardware, and the EdgeGamers online community. Edge Games' website also claims that the aforementioned Marvel comics, the movie The Edge and the games magazine Edge, among other properties, were all released under license from Edge Games, though it is not clear what, if any, involvement Edge Games or Langdell had in these products.Edge Games licensees In 2014, Edge Games began a trademark case against the game peripherals company Razer Inc., regarding its Razer Edge gaming tablets. Edge Games filed an application for \\"SL8\\" in tablets in 2012, serial number 85704825, indicating that it would sell Windows 8 tablets at some point. The application was eventually denied, while Langdell's subsequent attempts to trademark hardware under the \\"Edge PC\\" name have been suspended. In July 2009, members of the International Game Developers Association (IGDA) began circulation of a petition calling for a special meeting of the membership to vote on the removal of Langdell from that organization's board of directors citing, among other things, his use of his position on the IGDA to \\"work directly against the mission of the organization.\\" In late August, the IGDA announced that a special meeting of the membership would be held on October 3, the sole purpose of which was to vote on whether Langdell should be removed, and on August 31, 2009, Langdell resigned from the IGDA board. Langdell had served on the board since March 2009. In a statement, Langdell said he resigned \\"with the best interests of the IGDA at heart\\". He stated he was confident that if a quorum was formed the vote would go in his favor, but feared that a quorum would not be attained and the \\"vocal minority\\" would not accept the outcome and continue to cause further disruption to the IGDA. On October 13, 2010, his IGDA membership was terminated due to his \\"...lack of integrity or unethical behavior, as determined by the Board of Directors.\\"  References  External links  * Video game publishers Video game development companies Video game companies of the United States Companies established in 1990 Companies based in Los Angeles County, California ","title":"Edge Games"},{"id":"18574522","text":"Air Vice-Marshal Albert Earl Godfrey MC (27 July 1890 - 1 January 1982) was a Canadian First World War flying ace, officially credited with 14 victories while flying for the Royal Flying Corps.http://www.theaerodrome.com Retrieved on 8 June 2010. He spent the remainder of his career in the Royal Canadian Air Force. Early life and service \\"Steve\\" Godfrey was the son of Nellie and Christopher Godfrey. He was building his own airplane when World War I began. He jumped at the chance to volunteer for the Royal Flying Corps. He was told he would be accepted if he could pay for his own flight training. As he was unable to do this, he enlisted, originally in the 11th Mounted Rifles CEF in January 1915, then in the 1st Pioneer Battalion CEF of the Canadian Expeditionary Force. He arrived in England in November 1915. While there, he tried to take flying lessons, but his commanding officer would not allow him the time off from his duties. He shipped off to France, and served in the trenches until mid-1916. He finally arranged a transfer to the RFC as an aerial observer. Aerial service Godfrey served as an observer/gunner in both 10 and 25 Squadrons, and tallied his first win by driving a Roland fighter down out of control on 16 October 1916. He then finally got his chance at pilot's training. Once he received his wings, he was assigned to 40 Squadron to fly a Nieuport. On 28 May 1917, he shared another \\"out of control\\" victory over an Albatros D.III while teaming with William Arthur Bond. Then, still using Nieuport 17 serial number B1684, between 1 June and 14 August 1917, he ran off a string of eleven wins‚Äînine versus Albatros D.III fighters and two against two-seater reconnaissance machines. He then switched to Nieuport 24 serial number B3601 for his final win on 22 August 1917. A summary of his victories shows he destroyed four enemy planes and drove down ten out of control. This sufficed for a MC. He was then withdrawn to Home Establishment to serve in 44 and 78 Squadrons until April 1918. He then returned home to serve with the Canadian Training Brigade, which he did through war's end. In September 1926, American aviator James Dalzell McKee and Squadron Leader Godfrey flew from Montreal to Vancouver over nine days, pioneering trans-Canada aviation.

By the beginning of World War II, he was serving at the Imperial Defence College as a Group Captain. He attained the rank of Air Vice- Marshal during World War II before retiring in 1944. Political career Godfrey ran as the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation's candidate in the February 1945 Grey North by-election against General Andrew McNaughton who had been appointed Minister of Defence the previous November and was contesting the by-election for the Liberal Party of Canada. While Godfrey placed third, General McNaughton was upset in the by-election by the Progressive Conservative candidate with Godfrey, whose vote total was less than the difference between McNaughton and the Conservative candidate, acting as spoiler.

L. Vincent, Bim Shieman and Lloyd Tomlinson), was a Jamaican musician and singer-songwriter. Biography Rooted in reggae, his music developed in later years in many directions, combining influences from all around the world, notably India. Sherman was also hailed as \\"reggae's sweetest voice\\". Bim Sherman was gifted with a haunting, ethereal voice that reached into the very heart of his listeners. In the mid 1970s he recorded a small body of classic roots tunes as a young struggling singer in Jamaica. He later moved to London where, as part of the post-punk reggae infatuation, he made a name for himself recording with Adrian Sherwood's On-U Sound label. He became part of various musical collectives associated with On-U Sound, such as New Age Steppers (alongside Ari Up, formerly of The Slits), Singers & Players (with Congo Ashanti Roy and the late Prince Far-I ), Dub Syndicate and Justice League of Zion. Sherman also recorded a handful of solo reggae LPs. Towards the end of his life, Bim Sherman took a whole new musical direction. He went to India and re-recorded his classic 70s roots tunes alongside a full Indian classical orchestra in Bombay, creating his masterpiece LP, the highly acclaimed Miracle. This opened Sherman up to an entire new audience and he seemed at last to be emerging from the reggae underworld. It Must Be A Dream, an entire remix of Miracle was released with dance mixes by top UK DJs, followed by another notable Indian/reggae crossover LP What Happened? Then, out of the blue, Bim Sherman was diagnosed with cancer and died within weeks of his diagnosis. He received an obituary in The Times, a rare accolade for an underground reggae singer.

Biography  Dandelion Cottage with llustrations by Florence Scovel Shinn and Elizabeth Reynolds Finley Rankin was born May 11, 1864 in Marquette, Michigan, in the Upper Peninsula, and raised her four children there. Her first writing assignment came at the age of 16, when she was hired as a reporter for the Daily Mining Journal. She kept the job until her marriage to Ernest Rankin in 1886. Her free lance stories were published by Century, Harper's Monthly, Youth's Companion, St. Nicholas, Leslie's, Lippincott's, Metropolitan and other widely circulated periodicals. Her best known novel is Dandelion Cottage, published in 1904 by Henry Holt and Company. She first wrote the story serially for her own children. Considered a regional classic in the Midwest, it tells of four young girls who negotiate the use of a derelict cottage belonging to a church as a playhouse by pulling dandelions for the senior warden of the church, prosperous Mr. Black. The real life model for Mr. Black is generally acknowledged to be Marquette businessman and philanthropist, Peter White. The original Dandelion Cottage is located at 440 East Arch and is privately owned. Now that the book is in public domain, it is available from Project Gutenberg and a print edition is available from the Marquette Regional History Center, published by the Marquette County Historical Society. Rankin allowed her characters much latitude in emotion and behavior at a time when writing for children was often tepid and tutelary.

Description  Most NBC University Theater programming aired on NBC's Red Network, but the Blue Network (later to become ABC) also participated. The Armed Forces Radio Network also distributed some of the programs. About 1948, NBC replaced this category with NBC Presents. = The World's Great Novels = The World's Great Novels was one of the radio series included in NBC University Theater. The series was produced by Margaret Cuthbert and directed by Homer Heck. It presented adaptations of classic novels, often described as \\"Anglo-American literature.\\" The show was born The World's Great Novels on WMAQ, Chicago, and NBC from 1944 to 1948, and adopted its better known name when it relocated to Hollywood in July 1948.It initially aired Saturdays at 7:00 pm CST during the first 1944‚Äì45 season and then moved to Fridays at 11:30 pm. Music for the series was composed by Emil Soderstrom (n√© Emil Otto Edvard S√∂derstr√∂m; 1901‚Äì1972) and conducted by Bernard \\"Whitey\\" Berquist (n√© Bernard H. Berquist; 1903‚Äì1962). The Chicago-based programs were a production of The NBC University of the Air. Through agreements with the University of Louisville, the University of Tulsa, Kansas State Teachers College, and Washington State College, listeners could receive college credit through accredited, radio-assisted literature correspondence courses. A study guide, The Handbook of the World's Great Novels, was available for 25 cents.Dunning, John. On The Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio. Oxford University Press, 1998. The series began October 28, 1944, with Henry Fielding's Tom Jones, followed by Voltaire's Candide and Jane Austen's Emma. Over the next four years, it aired adaptations of such novels as Kidnapped, The Last of the Mohicans, Thomas Hardy's The Mayor of Casterbridge, Moby-Dick, A Tale of Two Cities and War and Peace. Since this was a half-hour program, many of the novels were serialized in multi-part adaptations of two to six 30-minute episodes. Chicago actors The group of Chicago actors heard on the series included Larry Alexander, Ernie Andrews, Everett Clarke, Johnny Coons, Maurice Copeland, Harry Elders, Sidney Ellstrom, Charles Flynn, Donald Gallagher, Hilda Graham, Ken Griffin, Jonathan Hole, Geraldine Kay, Eloise Kummer, Jack Lester, Ken Nordine, Hope Summers and Lee Young. Some episodes were narrated by Nordine. The announcers were Charles Chan, John Conrad and Dave Garroway. Guest commentators Some shows in the series had guest speakers. Amy Loveman, an editor with The Saturday Review of Literature, was the guest commentator with the 1944 adaptation of Emma. The novelist Ida Alexa Ross Wylie was the guest commenting on Charles Dickens' The Pickwick Papers. The adaptation of Theodore Dreiser's Free (July 9, 1948) featured a brief talk by the Dean of the University of Chicago. On July 23, 1948, the final program featured readings from different works by Thomas Wolfe. The series was retooled by Cuthbert and renamed NBC University Theater (aka NBC University Theater of the Air, NBC Theater of the Air and NBC Theater) and moved from Chicago to Hollywood. That series was heard from July 30, 1948, to February 14, 1951.Passage, Frank The World's Great Novels. In the new format, the program also included adaptations of short stories and plays in addition to novels and occasionally featured commentary on the original work by distinguished writers and critics. The new series won a Peabody Award in 1948 and was considered one of the most distinguished radio programs of its day; all the episodes from this period still survive. The NBC University of the Air also produced a summer replacement series, American Novels, which was broadcast when The World's Great Novels was off during the summers of 1947 and 1948. Some sources give the title of the 1944‚Äì48 series as The World's Greatest Novels, but there is no evidence this title was ever used.

It is the oldest and first national student organization in Canada. It was the primary student organization in Canada during the 1920s, 1930s (except for the Canadian Student Assembly created in 1937), 1940s (NFCUS ceased operations from 1940‚Äì1946) the 1950s, and the early 1960s. NFCUS changed its name to the Canadian Union of Students (CUS) in 1963 and continued operations under that name until CUS ceased to exist in 1969. Several adhoc committees operated on a national level for a few years until the National Union of Students in Canada was organized in 1972.  Formation  The Federation was formed in Montreal on December 1926 with representatives from ten student associations. Its formation was encouraged by a former president of National Union of Students in England, Ralph Nunn May, who was touring Canada as a member of the Imperial Debating Team.Robert Fredrick Clift, The Fullest Development of Human Potential: The Canadian Union of Students, 1963-1969, Masters Thesis, University of British Columbia , (2002), p.8 NFCUS was initially established to facilitate student engagement in debating events, and to organize student exchanges, sports events, and discounts on train tickets. Although NFCUS was organized amongst other more politically involved student organizations, NFCUS remained largely apolitical in its early existence.  Early years: 1926-1940  In the 1920s and 1930s, university in Canada was the purview of the wealthy and upper middle class. University students were predominantly white males and were a minority amongst their cohort. In 1930, approximately 33,000 students attended Canadian universities full-time, which comprised 3% of college aged youth.Paul Axelrod, ‚ÄúThe Student Movement of the 1930s‚Äù in Youth, University, and Canadian Society: Essays in the Social History of Higher Education, Paul Axelrod and John G. Reid (eds), p. 216 Aside from regular university antics, University administrators during this time had traditionally succeeded in managing and socializing students. Paul Axelrod, professor and Dean of the Faculty of Education at York University, asserts NFCUS had been created amongst a common desire for peace and international harmony after the carnage and collective trauma experienced as a result of the First World War. Initially NFCUS resolved to ‚Äúpromote national unity‚Äù through campus cooperation and to facilitate the exchange of information on student concerns. Axelrod asserts that NFCUS became an apolitical service organization for students, even during a time in the 1930s when other student groups advocated peace and social change, ‚ÄúNFCUS avoided taking controversial positions on issues of the day.‚Äù This is consistent with Nigel Moses and Robert Fredrick Clift's assessment of NFCUS in its early days.see Nigel R. Moses, All That was Left (1995) Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Toronto, and Robert Fredrick Clift, The Fullest Development of Human Potential: The Canadian Union of Students, 1963-1969, Masters Thesis, University of British Columbia (2002) Canadian university administrators were warm to NFCUS and saw it as part of student learning and development on campus. Surveillance reports of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police mention NFCUS as a ‚Äúreliable and approved institution.‚ÄùPaul Axelrod, ‚ÄúThe Student Movement of the 1930s‚Äù in Youth, University, and Canadian Society: Essays in the Social History of Higher Education, Paul Axelrod and John G. Reid (eds). p. 217 Other groups, many inspired by the Social Gospel movement, were more active on social justice initiatives, such as the Student Christian Movement, the Canadian Youth Congress, and the Canadian Student Assembly (created in 1937). There were students involved in activism resembling a type of student movement at the time, but as Axelrod wrote, the campus culture of conformity and repressive nature of university administrators made it difficult for students to express independent political views. It wasn't uncommon for editors of newspapers and student councilors to lose their positions after criticizing the university, government, or the dominant order.  Middle years: 1940-1963  In 1940, NFCUS shut down operations so that university students could concentrate on Canada's prosecution of the Second World War. NFCUS restarted in 1946 (with a false start in 1944 and 1945). In Nigel Moses‚Äô Ph.D. Dissertation, he suggests that the influx of veterans with working class origins is related to the re- emergence of NFCUS in 1946-1947].Moses, All That Was Left (1995), p.56 In a subsequent article, Moses states that The NFCUS of the late 1940s and early 1950s was not just a straightforward continuation of the rather conservative NFCUS of the 1930s ... In the late 1930s, it was the Canadian Student Assembly (CSA), founded in 1938, not the NFCUS that pursued a campaign to pressure the federal government to provide a thousand student bursaries worth $500 each. So the post-war NFCUS was really an heir to the CSA and NFCUS of the 1930s. p. 87 After the Second World War, service men and women received the Veterans Affairs University Training Allowance and the subsequent increase in presence of veterans is thought to have changed the social composition and customs of university life.Moses (1995), p.55 Their presence in post secondary institutions was significant; during the 1945/1946 academic year some 30,000 (roughly half the Canadian university student population) veterans attended university, 23,000 in 1948-1949, and 14,500 in 1949-1950. The numbers of ex- service men and women tapers off by 1955-1956.Moses (1995) Most of the veterans were older, many were working class, and they were reported to have commanded respect from peers and professors. According to research by Helen Lefkowitz Horowitz (Professor of History at Smith College), these veterans, after fighting a world war against fascism, challenged the elitist norms and customs of the university and had an ever-lasting effect on the university system in Canada.Moses (1995), p.56 NFCUS reemerged after the war in 1944 and 1945, however there was disagreement over continuity from 1940). However, by 1946 a conference was organized and held at the University of Toronto where Maurice Sauv√© was elected president. By the mid-1950s, with university enrollment down which resulted in low funds, student councils pulled out of NFCUS, putting its existence in danger. By 1953, tensions with Quebec were becoming apparent as delegates disagreed over questions of federal aid versus Quebec students‚Äô prerogative to lobby their provincial government. In March 1956, McGill University, University of British Columbia, University of Toronto, Universit√© de Montr√©al and University of Manitoba had left NFCUS. NFCUS recovered in the late 1950s after it invested considerable time convincing local student councils of the ‚Äòusefulness‚Äô of the Federation. Also, enrollment crept up again and NFCUS improved its student travel discount program.Moses (1995), p.61 In return, university student councils played a more active role in NFCUS as responsibility for selecting delegates became the responsibility of the councils (instead of local NFCUS committees). As a result of these efforts NFCUS was able to hire more staff, balance its budget, and engage in government lobbying with respect to funding for universities. The late 1950s was a turning point for NFCUS. By 1957, NFCUS rebounded from the mid-1950s doldrums. Alliances were made with university professors through their newly formed (1951) union, Canadian Association of University Teachers (CAUT), and the National Conference of Canadian Universities (NCCU, today known as the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada (AUCC)). In 1957, NFCUS also resolved to fight for financial aid for any \\"needy and worthy\\" student.Robert Fredrick Clift, The Fullest Development of Human Potential: The Canadian Union of Students, 1963-1969, Masters Thesis, University of British Columbia, (2002), p. 11Moses, 2001 From the late 1950s to the early 1960s, government aid for university students was NFCUS‚Äô primary objective on the national level. Annual briefs were researched, written and published by NFCUS and presented to provincial and federal governments. A former NFCUS president (1959‚Äì1960), Jacques G√©rin, recounts NFCUS‚Äô political aims at the time: > The first and foremost [issue] was more money for education, namely > scholarships for students, accessibility to education. We argued for reduced > costs. The issue in those days was that university education was for a > reserved lot: privileged students who had the means. And that meant only 8% > of the student-aged population was at university. So at al levels ‚Äî > provincially, nationally ‚Äî that was the big fight ‚Äì to open up university > education.Excerpt from Nigel R. Moses, ‚ÄúStudent Organizations as Historical > Actors: the Case of Mass Student Aid‚Äù, The Canadian Journal of Higher > Education, Volume XXXI, No. 1, 2001 pages 75-120, p. 78 Through years of lobbying the federal government, NFCUS (by 1964 was known as CUS) finally had a breakthrough with the Liberal Party of Canada in 1964. The Liberal Party adopted the NFCUS student aid proposal, but with one key difference, Liberals opted for student loans instead of non-repayable assistance in the form of bursaries, which NFCUS had been pushing for. Many students felt betrayed by the Liberal Party's creation of the Canada Student Loans Program in 1964. International Affairs and NFCUS participation in the International Union of Students and the International Student Conference Moses (2006) article Canadian Student Movements on the Cold War Battlefield, 1944‚Äì1954 goes into great detail on NFCUS' involvement in international affairs and in the two international student organizations. Moses shows how the devastation of the Second World War, impelled students around the world (with the financial support of the Soviet Union) to form the International Union of Students (IUS). National student organizations around the world, including NFCUS, were eager to form such an international student organization, in part, to help thwart the possibility of yet another (nuclear) world war. As Moses (2006) shows, in one way or another, Canadian students and student veterans linked to NFCUS were involved in the early formation of the IUS. In 1944, at the first NFCUS conference since ceasing operations in 1940, NFCUS leaders immediately grappled with defining NFCUS‚Äô role in international development and in the early discussions on forming the IUS. It soon became apparent to NFCUS delegates to IUS that the sympathies of its members were toward the Soviet Union and against continued global capitalist expansion. In 1950, with the covert assistance of the CIA, the International Student Conference (ISC) and its Coordinating Secretariat (CoSec) were created. (The CIA which formed in the same year as the US National Student Association‚Äî1947‚Äîhad completely taken-over the international activities of the US National Student Association). Drawing mainly from the work of Joel kotek and Karen Paget (2003), Moses describes how the ISC was created under the stewardship of the CIA mainly to undermine the Soviet-influenced IUS which was active in anticolonial national movements and promoting Soviet communism in general. The ISC created a parallel or alternative international student organization that ultimately succeeded in dividing students internationally throughout the Cold War until 1966. NFCUS became embroiled in a cold war struggle for the hearts and minds of the world's youth leaders; the Soviets, and soon after, the Americans, reasoned (correctly) that national student organizations were powerful social agents of state formation. This was especially so in struggles for national liberation and decolonialization. The Soviets and Americans knew that student leaders within a few years would ‚Äògraduate‚Äô to key positions in national governments. So governments on both sides of the Iron Curtain strove to cultivate the political sympathies and support of student leaders internationally ‚Äì as well, collect intelligence on them. The Soviets hoped to gain the support of the leaders of newly liberated former colonies; the US needed a foil to stop this, and thus the ISC was created. NFCUS leaders would come in regular contact with covert operatives of Soviet, American and European governments. For example, Moses documents how starting in the early 1950s, delegates of the US National Student Association (CIA operatives), would regularly attend and formally and informally address NFCUS meetings and seminars. However, Moses's work raises more questions than it answers: it is not clear for example how effective the US's cultural cold war offensive was on the minds of Canadians throughout the 1950s until 1967, when the NSA-CIA link was revealed in Ramparts magazine. Karen Paget's 2015 book, Patriotic Betrayal: The Inside Story of the CIA's Secret Campaign to Enroll American Students in the Crusade Against Communism,C-SPAN.org: Hey Hey CIA ‚Äì How many US college students SPOOK  Video  C-SPAN.org, accessdate: 3/28/2015 documents how the CIA used the USNSA National Student Association, to recruit students as undercover agents inside America and abroad.Yale University Press: Patriotic Betrayal - Paget, Karen M. - Yale University Press, accessdate: 3/28/2015  The influence of Quebec syndicalism  Tensions with French Canadian students inside NFCUS became apparent by 1961. The student society at the Universit√© de Montr√©al (Association g√©n√©ral des √©tudiants de l‚ÄôUniversit√© de Montr√©al‚ÄîAGEUM) had adopted a manifesto entitled ‚ÄúCharte de l‚Äô√©tudiant universitaire,‚Äù which declared students as intellectual workers, which could and should be catalysts for social change.Robert Fredrick Clift, The Fullest Development of Human Potential: The Canadian Union of Students, 1963-1969, Masters Thesis, University of British Columbia , (2002), p.15 Thus, \\"student syndicalism\\" became a distinct attribute of Quebec students. At this time NFCUS was still careful not to engage in politics outside of student issues. Also, the ‚ÄúQuiet Revolution‚Äù in Quebec, which secularized Quebec society and divided Quebec politics along federalist and nationalist lines, had major influences on Quebec's students. In 1962, at the NFCUS national Congress, an English document, which mirrored the ‚ÄúCharte de l‚Äô√©tudiant universitaire‚Äù, was introduced, however most English delegates were against it and it did not pass. Also in 1962, Quebec students began to organize themselves into the Union g√©n√©rale des √©tudiants du Qu√©bec (UGEQ), which caused considerable distress among members of the NFCUS. It was the influence of student syndicalism in France and Quebec that helped change NFCUS into a student movement and less of a service and single-issue lobby group. At the 1963 NFCUS Congress, NFCUS‚Äô name was changed to Canadian Union of Students (CUS), in order to recognize Quebec's unique status. CUS also became a French and English organization, instituted a bi-national veto in its constitution, and adopted an agreement to cease lobbying the federal government. However, by 1964, this arrangement fell apart and many of Quebec's universities pulled out of CUS in order to join the UGEQ, which had been officially created that year. Quebec students were more interested in provincial politics and felt CUS‚Äô bias towards lobbying of the federal government conflicted with their nationalist orientation.  Final years: 1964-1969  In 1964-1965 school year, tuition fee levels across Canada increased markedly in response to the initialization of CSLP. In 1964 a tuition freeze position was adopted by delegates, and in 1965 a tuition abolition position was taken at national Congress. Students at the local level became more combative which took university administrators by surprise. Individual student councils pointed to progressive tax reform, which would pay for post- secondary education and make tuition fees redundant.Nigel R. Moses, ‚ÄúForgotten Lessons: Student Movements Against tuitions fee hikes in Ontario in the 1960s and 1970s.‚Äù trans  forms p. 156 Also, inspired by the Students for a Democratic Society and the Civil Rights Movement, students councils in cooperation with CUS began to organize rallies and other actions on campuses. In response to years of intense lobbying by NFCUS and CUS, along with the tuition freeze and tuition abolition movements on campus, tuition fees were frozen in Canada in 1965. During this time CUS had radicalized, and became more critical of the university system and the political order. New Left politics, the war in Vietnam, Students for a Democratic Society, and the black power movement had influenced leaders in the CUS. However, the fee freeze and the infiltration of right wing students aligned with the administration, undermined the CUS and served to drive New Left students out of the Union and into other organizations on campus. Several student councils/unions initiated pull-outs at the same time which put immense strain on CUS. This led to the collapse of CUS in 1969. Nigel Moses characterizes the collapse as ‚Äúwithout support from the ‚Äòleft‚Äô and ‚Äòright‚Äô CUS collapsed....‚Äù Students met provincially and nationally through ad hoc committees however, students lacked a coherent nationwide organization from 1969 to 1972.

It is a small mushroom with a 1.4‚Äì3 cm diameter pale orange or orange-brown cap and buff-coloured stipe and gills. It is known only from near Sydney, Hazelbrook in the Blue Mountains, and Victoria. Taxonomy Hygrocybe austropratensis was originally collected by mycologist Bruce A. Fuhrer in Warrandyte State Park in Melbourne's outer northeastern suburbs on 23 May 1996, and officially described by Australian mycologist Tony Young in 1999, from a designated holotype collected by Ray and Elma Kearney in Lane Cove Bushland Park in Sydney's suburban Lower North Shore district on 7 June 1996. Its specific epithet is made with the prefix austro- \\"southern\\" onto the existing pratensis \\"of a meadow\\". It was separated from the wide-ranging buffcap (Hygrocybe pratensis) by its smaller spores and the fine white fur that covers young mushrooms.Young, p. 68 Description Hygrocybe austropratensis is a small mushroom with a pale orange to orange-brown cap in diameter, initially convex and later flattening irregularly. All parts of the mushroom are covered with fine white down which disappears with age. The widely spaced thick gills are decurrent, and occasionally fork at the margin of the cap, and are buff. The buff stipe is high and 0.4‚Äì0.7 cm thick and may be bulbous at the base. The spore print is white, the oval spores measuring 7.5 x 6.3 Œºm. Distribution and habitat Saprotrophic, this species has been recovered from locations in southeastern Australia including Hazelbrook in the Blue Mountains and Sydney Basin, and Warrandyte in outer Melbourne. Fruiting bodies appear in autumn and winter (May and June), in leaf litter and mossy areas in dry forest, particularly with Kunzea ericoides, in warm temperate or subtropical climates. It is currently listed by the Government of New South Wales as endangered, that is \\"likely to become extinct unless the circumstances and factors threatening its survival or evolutionary development cease to operate\\" as defined by the NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995. Searching of suitable habitat has only yielded a very limited occurrence, and its habitat has been deemed vulnerable to waterborne pollution, weed encroachment and damage from pedestrians.

Lovelock was active in the 1950s and 1960s and was primarily known for his work in the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Lovelock was the first to use the name \\"the Great Bolo\\" but would later allow Tom Renesto to use the name as well. Professional wrestling career Al Lovelock began wrestling in the late 1940s under his real name. In 1950 he worked for Dory Funk's \\"NWA Western States\\" territory, teaming with Danny McShain. The duo reached the finals of a tournament to crown new NWA Texas Tag Team Champions but lost to Rito Romero and Miguel Guzm√°n. In 1953 Lovelock had travelled to Hawaii and worked for NWA Hawaii, winning the promotions main title, the NWA Hawaii Heavyweight Championship from Ben Sharpe on February 14, 1954. Three months later Lovelock vacated the title and left the promotion. While working in Hawaii Lovelock had also begun working for the Los Angeles NWA territory as \\"The Great Bolo\\", a masked villain. Together with Tom Rice they held the International Television Tag Team Championship, which they won from Wilbur Snyder and Sandor Szabo. Bolo and Rice would hold the International Tag Team title one more time in 1955. After working in the Los Angeles area for a couple of years the Great Bolo moved on to Texas, returning to Dory Funk's Western States territory. Bolo would beat Dory Funk himself for the Amarillo version of the NWA North American Heavyweight Championship on February 7, 1957. A week later he defeated Funk for the NWA Southwest Junior Heavyweight Championship as well becoming a doubles champion. His double title reign only last two weeks before Dory Funk won both titles back. Bolo would go on to win the promotion's Southwest Tag Team Championship three times, each with a different partner: Dizzy Davis, Art Nelson and Tokyo Joe. In 1958 Tokyo Joe left the promotion forcing Bolo to team up with Kurt Von Poppenheim to lose the tag team titles to Ricky Romero and Dory Funk. From Texas Bolo moved on to the Gulf region of the South Eastern United States working for the local promotions NWA Gulf Coast and NWA Mid-America. On April 20, 1960 Bolo and partner Joe McCarthy won the NWA Gulf Coast Tag Team Championship and the NWA Mid-America Southern Tag Team Championship, both held by Bobby and Don Fields. A week later Bolo and McCarthy lost the titles back to the Fields brothers and split up. After this Lovelock began working with Tom Renesto who had been Lovelock's manager in Los Angeles. Renesto took the name \\"the Mighty Bolo\\" and the two became a tag team known as \\"the Bolos\\". When Lovelock moved to another territory he gave Renesto permission to work as the Great Bolo in the area since he was booked to work in Texas. In those days it was not uncommon for several people to use the same gimmick in various territories, often leading to confusing records on who wrestled where, Renesto worked as the Great Bolo in the Carolinas, mainly for Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP) while Lovelock worked all over the country. Renesto made \\"The Missouri Mauler\\" Larry Hamilton his tag-team partner giving him the \\"Mighty Bolo\\" name. Renesto was so popular as the Great Bolo that Al Lovelock sued promoter Jim Crockett to get a part of the profits that his creation had earned. Later on Hamilton's brother Jody Hamilton started to team with Renesto as The Assassins, but the Bolo name was so popular in JCP that the two worked as the Great Bolo and the Mighty Bolo for a while to capitalize on the popularity of the Bolo gimmick. Lovelock would go on to recruit Pepper Martin to work alongside him as \\"the Mighty Bolo\\" forming another Bolos team, the team would work together until Lovelock retired in the late 1960s. After his retirement Lovelock discovered and trained Gary Fletcher aka Man Mountain Mike for a professional wrestling career.

The game was developed and published by Telltale Games. It consists of four episodes, which were released to Microsoft Windows from March 23 to July 30, 2009 and to Xbox 360 from May 27 to November 4, 2009. Episodes are developed by Telltale Games in collaboration with Aardman Animations to develop the story, characters, and setting. Players control both Wallace and Gromit at times through the gameplay. Ben Whitehead, Aardman's official backup voice actor, portrays Wallace, instead of Peter Sallis, who had voiced the character in all screen appearances up to that point. A playable demo of the first episode was made available on March 16, 2009 and can be downloaded from the official site as well as Yahoo Games. It is also included on the Region 2 DVD and Blu-ray releases of A Matter of Loaf and Death as DVD-ROM content. On January 14, 2014, Telltale Games removed the game from sale due to the expiration of their distribution rights for the Wallace & Gromit intellectual property; customers who previously purchased the game can still download the episodes from their game library. Synopsis=Episode 1: Fright of the Bumblebees= Wallace and Gromit have opened a new business, \\"From Bee to You\\" specialising in delivering freshly made honey to customers. They take up the offer to provide fifty gallons of honey in repayment to the local grocer after Wallace's electric cheese-detecting machine accidentally rampaged through the store on a test run. However, Wallace has used up all the flowers in his garden, and is forced to improvise a growth formula to turn some daisy seeds provided by his neighbour, Ms. Flitt into giant flowers. The formula is a success, and he meets his client's demand but things soon go wrong when the bees react to the growth formula, becoming huge and terrorizing the town and Wallace's home. Gromit is able to trap most of the bees, but Wallace is stolen away by the giant bee queen. Gromit gives chase in Wallace's honey tanker truck, and is able to rescue Wallace. The two work together to feed the queen more honey dosed with more of the growth formula, forcing the bee to become stuck in a tunnel. Wallace works out an antidote to the growth formula to restore the bees to normal, though he accidentally shrinks himself in the process. =Episode 2: The Last Resort= Wallace prepares to Gromit to Blackpool, but the weather both spoils their plans and creates a small flood in the cellar. The flood eventually gives Wallace the idea of temporary converting their into an indoor holiday resort. He and Gromit do it up and he then decides to open it for the rest of the townsfolk. The guest aren't happy at first, due to Ms. Flitt's two puppies, Pudgie-Woo and Tinkie-Wee causing havoc or due to being bullied by Flitt's ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù, Duncan McBiscuit. Wallace manages to satisfy everyone before dinner time and avoids having to give refunds. At the table during dinner time, the day appears to be a big success until Duncan is almost murdered by only one of the other guests during a blackout. Gromit eventually deduce from evidence and advice from everyone including a hurt Duncan that Pudgie-Woo and Tinkie-Wee attacked him when he bullied them. When Wallace, Gromit, Pudgie-Woo and Tinkie-Wee fall in the pool, the cellar drain becomes dislodged and the puppies‚Äô favourite chew toy goes down the drain. Wallace watches the dishearted Pudgie-Woo and Tinkie-Wee jump down the drain after their toy and with Gromit, makes it back to shore before wishing all the appalled guests that they had a good time before their departure. Despite the mess made, Gromit finally enjoys the resort in private. That night, a whistling man with a mustache posts a flyer for a charity fair through the door to 62 West Wallaby Street. =Episode 3: Muzzled!= Shortly after the holiday season, a charity fair comes into town, run by Monty Muzzle, to raise money for a new dog shelter, the old one being destroyed in the storm last episode. After dealing with three strays in their home, Wallace and Gromit go to the fair with Wallace's new invention to create any flavor of ice cream. At the fair, Gromit discovers that Mr. Muzzle is actually attempting to steal away the townspeople's donations and using the strays as manual labor for the fair. When Wallace and Gromit uncover Mr. Muzzle's intentions, he escapes on a makeshift balloon, but Wallace and Gromit give chase, denying Mr. Muzzle of his ill-gotten money while saving all the strays. Ms. Flitt, who dumped Duncan McBiscuit earlier in the episode and has grown to admire the \\"bravery\\" of Wallace (unaware that it was actually Gromit that stopped Muzzle), mistakes his confusion at finding a loose fastening nut as an engagement ring and a marriage proposal from him. =Episode 4: The Bogey Man= Wallace and Gromit start a new business called Golden Retrieval which aims to find lost objects and Major Crum hires them. In order to defuse Ms. Flitt's mistake in accepting what she had mistaken as a proposal from Wallace, Gromit manages to make him a member of the local country club, Prickly Thicket, which Ms. Flitt's aunt Prudence loathes and soundly rejects her niece's marriage to Wallace. Ernest Dibbins, the local constable, jealous that Wallace was admitted over him, uses an obscure bylaw to threaten the club with closure since it does not have a golf course‚Äìor rather it does, but members do not know where it is because the deed is missing, safely held in a security system designed by Wallace's (apparent) ancestor, Goodman Witless (and his faithful dog Gimlet). Using his detective equipment Wallace manages to find the deed which Major Crum hired him to do, but discovers that the entire town was built on the golf course, and a vengeful Duncan decides to have the town destroyed in order to rebuild the course. Wallace challenges Duncan to a golf tournament so that he may become chairman and tear up the deed, saving the town, and manages to win with Gromit's help. However, as he goes to tear the deed, the security system traps him and the other townsfolk in a room, and Gromit is forced to disable the trap and free everyone. Wallace tears up the deed, and is thankful to find that Ms. Flitt has cancelled their engagement and gone back to Duncan, who her aunt almost now approves of since he is no longer the club chairman.

Brown. 1913. An illustrated flora of the northern United States, Canada and the British Possessions. 3 vols. Charles Scribner's Sons, New York. Vol. 3: 36 Cynanchum laeve is a vining perennial herb native to eastern and central U.S. states and Ontario. Common names include sand vine, honeyvine, honeyvine milkweed, bluevine milkweed, climbing milkweed, and smooth swallow-wort. The root system of C. laeve can cause it to be very difficult to eradicate, especially in agricultural fields. It is a larval food of monarch butterfliesKansas Native Plants: Butterfly Gardening and milkweed tussock moth larvae. C. laeve can cause eye irritation if touched and can be toxic to humans and livestock if consumed in large quantities.  Taxonomy  Cynanchum laeve was originally described in 1803 as Gonolobus laevis Michx. Mixed elements on the type sheet that was published has led to confusion around the correct nomenclature. Currently under the International Plant Names Index it is listed as Cynanchum laeve Pers. Synonymous plant names include Ampelamus albidus (Nutt.) Britton, Ampelamus laevis (Michx.) Krings, and Gonolobus laevis Michx. Cynanchum laeve is in the Apocynaceae, or milkweed family. Cynanchum, or swallow-wort genus, and the laeve, which is a specific epithet meaning smooth .  Description  Like bindweed and some other members of the Convolvulaceae, Cynanchum laeve is a twining vine with heart-shaped leaves and commonly found in roadsides, fence rows, fields, and disturbed areas. However, C. laeve is easily recognized as a member of the Apocynaceae by its opposite leaves, milky sap, and distinctive flowers and follicles (\\"milkweed pods\\"). The seeds are wind dispersed and can travel long distances. Each plant can produce up to 50 follicles. The root system is fleshy and brittle with a large taproot with other lateral roots, these roots can grow up through 6 feet deep. Developing stems are a light pink and produce a milky sap when broken. Vase-shaped flowers have 5 white petals. These occur in clusters on short stalks. C. laeve flowers from June through September.  Distribution and habitat  Cynanchum laeve occurs in the eastern and central United States and Ontario, Canada. C. laeve can be found in wetland areas in the arid West, Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plain, Eastern mountain and Piedmont, the Great Plains, Midwest, and the North Central and North Eastern United States. Cynanchum laeve typically lives disturbed habitats such as thickets, low moist fields, riverbanks, fence rows, and cultivated fields.  Conservation status  In Pennsylvania, Cynanchum laeve is listed as endangered.  Insect use  Cynanchum laeve is a food plant of caterpillars of monarch butterflies. Larvae of Euchaetes egle, the milkweed tussock moth, both in the Eastern and Western United States consume C. laeve. The larvae of these moths eat Cynanchum laeve and other plants when developing.  Human use  Cynanchum laeve is not a human edible plant. Its sap can cause eye irritation damaging mucous membranes. If C. laeve is consumed in large quantities it can be toxic. Thorough hand washing is recommended after handling the plant. Hay fed to livestock can contain C. laeve which can be toxic when consumed in large quantities. Most animals will not eat ‚ÄúC. leave‚Äù due to its bitter taste. It is recommended by the US Fish and Wildlife Service to take precautionary steps. These steps include not grazing hungry animals in pastures containing C. laeve, eradicating it from driveways and trails, and closely observing livestock that have just been introduced to areas containing C. laeve. C. laeve can be very difficult to eradicate from fields because of its deep, extensive root system. This vine climbs on other plants, and this can cause problems in crop harvesting.

Built in 1911 by the Austin Organ Co. as Opus 323, it was the second-largest organ in the world at the time, and it remains the largest organ in Maine today. The organ was donated to the city by Portland native Cyrus Hermann Kotzschmar Curtis (founder of the Curtis Publishing Company of Philadelphia) as a memorial to Hermann Kotzschmar, a close family friend for whom he had been named. Kotzschmar was a German-born musician who came to Portland in 1849, acquired a reputation as the city's most prominent musician, and lived there until his death in 1908.

She stood as the ANC's candidate as mayor of Cape Town in 1999 and served as provincial Minister (MEC) for finance, economic development and tourism until her elevation to the office of Premier in 2008. The ANC lost control of the province in the 2009 election with the Democratic Alliance garnering 22 of the 42 seats in the Provincial Parliament. The DA premier candidate Helen Zille replaced Brown on 6 May 2009. She served as Leader of the ANC Opposition from 2009 until May 2014, when she was appointed by former President Jacob Zuma to his cabinet as Minister of Public Enterprises. Lynne Brown's political legacy hangs in the balance following the Eskom enquiry. She initially claimed the Eskom inquiry amounted to a kangaroo court after she was called a liar by Eskom board spokesman Khulani Qoma over her role in the capture of the power utility. She denied having read the Gupta emails despite being given a brown envelope by Natasha Mazzone containing them, and denied that President Zuma had called her after meeting Tsotsi (Eskom Chairman at the time), a meeting that led to the suspension of Matona, Marokane and Koko. She denied knowing Tony Gupta and Salim Essa after Tsotsi stated under oath that Brown had invited him to her house and \\"Tony Gupta and Salim Essa were present.\\" As of February 2018 she was removed from the Cabinet of President Cyril Ramaphosa, being succeeded by Pravin Gordhan. On 1 March 2018 she resigned as an ANC member of parliament.  Personal life  Brown is openly gay.

In the 2002 census, 38,964 people of Slovenia declared Serb ethnicity, corresponding to 2% of the total population, making them the largest ethnic minority in the country. History The vast majority of the Serbs in Slovenia are first or second generation settlers from other republics of former Yugoslavia, mostly from Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia, but also from Croatia and Montenegro. After World War II, many Serbs employed in the Yugoslav People's Army were stationed in the Socialist Republic of Slovenia with their families. In the period of 1971-1981, many ethnic Serbs migrated from Bosnia and Herzegovina to pursue better careers and economic opportunities in Slovenia. Before 1991, many Serbs in Slovenia registered as Yugoslavs, and many still prefer referring to their mother language as Serbo-Croatian, rather than Serbian. There also exists an autochthonous community of Serbs in White Carniola from 16th century (see Serbs of White Carniola). In 2013, the combined community association of Serbs in Slovenia requested that Serbs be given the status of national minority.http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/planeta.300.html:451673-Slovenija-Srbi- traze-status-nacionalne-manjine Demographics Most of Serbs in Slovenia are concentrated in larger urban areas, especially in Ljubljana and Jesenice. The table shows the year and number and percentage of Serbs in Slovenia after World War II, according to the official censuses. *1948 - 7,048 *1953 - 11,225 (0.8%) *1961 - 13,609 (0.9%) *1971 - 20,521 (1.2%) *1981 - 42,182 (2.3%) *1991 - 47,097 (2.5%) *2002 - 38,964 (2.0%) It also has to be noted that in the last census in 2002, more than 10% of all Slovenian population decided not to answer the question regarding their ethnic affiliation. All these elements make the estimate of the overall number of Serbs in Slovenia difficult.  Culture  Dances from White Carniola. Yugonostalgia is strong among the older generation. The urban former Yugoslav immigrant community in Slovenia have developed a \\"Balkan culture\\" in the 1990s. The Leskovac-styled grilled meat, including ƒáevapƒçiƒái, have today become part of everyday-diet in Slovenia. =Language= Most Serbs in Slovenia use Slovene as their language of communication, since only 4,300 people in Slovenia declared that they use only Serbian language at home, while about 15,000 declared they use both languages at home. However more than 31,000 people declared their mother tongue as Serbian (and another 36,000 as Serbo-Croatian). A mixed Slovenian‚ÄìSerbian slang, srbosloven≈°ƒçina, became an \\"unofficial\\" language in football and construction building, among other traditional domains of post-war immigrants from former Yugoslavia. =Religion= Serbs in Slovenia are predominantly Eastern Orthodox by faith, adhering to the Serbian Orthodox Church.

It can be found in Spain and parts of Portugal, Iran, France, Lebanon, Central and Southern Italy, Bulgaria and Greece. The species invalidly cited by their synonyms in many tropical checklists such as in India and Sri Lanka. Empusa pennata General information Empusa pennata generally has large and thin body along with a great flying apparatus by their pair of wings and light body mass. Also, they are mostly found in perennial herbs and scrubs. There are three ways for insects to find mates: chemical, acoustic, and visual signals. Cryptic coloration is significant to some predatory insects like Mantids, which is used to protect themselves from predators and to capture their prey.Gemeno C, Claramunt J, Dasca J. 2004. Nocturnal Calling Behavior in Mantids. Journal of Insect Behavior 18(3):389-403 This species of mantis, although similar in size to the common European mantis (Mantis religiosa), is easily distinguished by the protrusion from its crown. Both male and females, even from first hatching carry this tall extension giving them a very alien appearance. They live in areas that are warm and dry and use their cryptic colouring of either greens and pinks or various shades of brown to keep them hidden from predators. The female may grow to a length of 10 cm while the male is shorter and slimmer. The male has distinctive ‚Äòfeather‚Äô type antennae as shown on the image above. Nocturnal pheromone release However, insects that depend on vision will hinder to find their mate because they will be undetectable to each other. Therefore, as an alternative way to find mates, sex pheromone is used. The releasing of sex pheromone by Empusa pennata is an adaption derived from sexual selection.Nentwig W, Reitze M. 1991. Comparative investigation into the feeding ecology of six Mantodea species. Oecologia 86(4):568-574 Feeding ecology Mantids stalk their prey and pounce on it, grasping it with their raptorial forelegs. Only living prey is selected and it is consumed directly after the catch. The predator orients itself optically, and therefore only takes notice of moving prey. The maximum size of prey which mantids can overwhelm is species-specific and depends on the prey type. On average mantids eat crickets of 50% their own body weight, while cockroaches can weigh up to 110%.

It has an unusually unsettled status, as of 2019, due to the complex legal history of the area. Palestinian law includes many of the legal regimes and precepts used in Palestinian ruled territory and administered by the Palestinian Authority (West Bank areas A and B) and Hamas (Gaza Strip), which is not an independent nation-state. The scope of this article is to explain the legal history, context and development of law, the current fields of study of law in Palestinian ruled territory, as well as the state of lawlessness in those territories. It is also to discuss the domestic and international positions on which set of laws are controlling in Palestinian ruled territory today. Terminology Due to the changing usages of the terms \\"Palestine\\" and \\"Palestinian\\" throughout history, the term may also be associated with regimes that are not associated with the Palestinian law of today. Examples include the discussion (in a reference work dating from 1906) of the Talmudic interpretation of laws from Palestine before 70 AD, also known as Halakha: \\"Those of the laws of Palestine that were extended after the Exile were originally enacted for the purpose of protecting the judicial administration and economic interests of Palestine, and with a view to encourage settlement there.\\"Jewish Encyclopedia online from 1906. Accessed July 24, 2008. Such references to ancient Palestinian law do not apply to the Palestinian legal situation since at least 1948. Jurisdictional background Essentially, says one legal scholar, \\"the legal system in 'Palestine' consists of layer upon layer of law that almost all remain in effect.\\"Wadi Fouad Muhaisen, The Palestinian Legal System (essay, 2003), found at The Palestinian Legal System at Yap.com website . Accessed July 31, 2008 The major issue is the: The laws that applied come from many jurisdictions through history: \\"Customary Law ... Ottoman Law ... British Law ... Jordanian Law ... Egyptian Law ... Israeli\\" law and even the informal strictures of the intifada, and finally, the Palestinian National Authority's Basic law. The subject of sovereignty is both controversial and unsettled; \\"neither the PLO nor the PA is recognized as a sovereign state by the United States., citing Waldman v. PLO, 2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 16089 (2d Cir. Aug. 31, 2016) and Daimler AG v. Bauman, 134 S.Ct. 746 (2014). Basic Law The Basic law, established in 2002, is the proposed constitution of a future Palestinian state.Mideastweb website. According to one report, \\"Palestinians had been requesting that the law be signed into effect since 1997, in order to formally guarantee a modicum of basic rights.\\" It was enacted by the PLC (the Legislature of PNA) and signed by Yasser Arafat.It is not entirely clear that Chairman Arafat's signature was required. It was amended on March 19, 2003 \\"to allow the creation of the Prime Minister Position in the Palestinian National Authority....\\"Amended Basic Law, found at USAID government law website English translation . Accessed July 24, 2008. The Basic Law is based loosely on Shari'a: The Basic Law is introduced with \\"In The Name of God, The Merciful, The Compassionate,\\" as are most documents in Islamic countries. =Articles of the Basic Law= With 121 articles, it is more akin to a state constitution in comprehensiveness, detail and length. The \\"bill of rights\\" Articles of the Basic Law, as amended March 19, 2003, cover the following topics: # \\"Palestine is part of the large[r] Arab World ....\\" # \\"The People is the source of power\\" and the 3 branches of government enshrines \\"the principle of separation of powers\\" # States that \\"Jerusalem is the Capital of Palestine.\\" # Islamic law is the basis, and Arabic is the official language, of Palestine # Creates \\"a democratic parliamentary system based on political and party pluralism\\" and a popularly elected President # Recognizes the \\"principle of the rule of law\\" # Regulates citizenship # Defines the official flag # Protects against \\"discrimination because of race, sex, color, religion, political views, or disability\\" # Protection of human rights # Protection of freedom and procedural due process # Rights to \\"be informed of the reasons for his arrest or detention\\", to contact an attorney, and a speedy trial (see Miranda rights) # No duress, torture or forced confessions # Rights to be \\"innocent until proven guilty\\", to a defense, and to a lawyer for defense # Crime and punishment defined by law # Right to bodily integrity # Prohibition of searches except by lawful order # Freedom of private religious practice (\\"Freedom of belief, worship, and performance of religious rituals are guaranteed, provided that they do not violate public order or public morals.\\" ) # Freedom of expression # Freedom of movement # Creation of a free market economy and prohibition against taking without fair compensation # Insurance for health, disability, retirement, \\"welfare of families of martyrs‚Äô\\", and prisoners of war # Right to housing # Right to an education Statutes and legislation There is some confusion amongst jurists, scholars and laymen about exactly what legal regime exists, and which laws apply, in Palestinian ruled territory. Mahdi Abdul Hadi, a legal scholar, believes that all prior and current law continues to apply in the Palestinian territories, including \\"the British Mandate laws, the Jordanian laws that used to govern the West Bank before 1967 and the Egyptian law that governed Gaza Strip before 1967, in addition to the Israeli military orders.\\"Seminar summary notes, The Party Law in Palestine (Summary of the Seminar organized by PASSIA at Best Eastern Hotel in Ramallah on Political Parties Law and the upcoming PLC elections), found at Passia.org website . Accessed July 29, 2008. According to Abdul Hadi, the first step was the organization of \\"Palestinian civil society\\", that is, a traditional law, \\"then came the Madrid Conference and the Oslo Accords which drafted laws to govern the Palestinian political life for the interim period.\\" Following that, \\"the general elections in 1996 ... brought about the Palestinian Legislative Council as the legislative body of the Palestinian people in the Palestinian lands.\\" Ottoman law has governed Palestine since 1517, and the Ottoman Land Code of 1858 is still in force, one of the causes of international controversy over land seizures. The Ottoman statutory \\"codification mirrored Islamic law but also incorporated elements of European law, especially the law of France.\\" Judicial and customary law Islamic customary law applies in Palestinian ruled territory: The term urf, meaning \\"to know\\", refers to the customs and practices of a given society. Although this was not formally included in Islamic law,\\"Urf\\", Encyclopaedia of Islam the Sharia recognizes customs that prevailed at the time of Muhammad but were not abrogated by the Qur'an or the tradition (this is called \\"Divine silence\\"). Practices later innovated are also justified, since Islamic tradition says what the people, in general, consider good is also considered as such by God. Urf is the Islamic equivalent of \\"common law\\".Hasan (2004), p. 169-71 In the application of urf, custom that is accepted into law should be commonly prevalent in the region, not merely in an isolated locality; jurists also tend, with caution, to give precedence to custom over doctoral opinions of highly esteemed scholars. Criminal law For the most part, crimes and violent acts are considered crimes of violence and fall under the purview of the criminal justice system. The Palestinian Authority operates under its own criminal law, such as its Penal Code. In addition, \\"the Palestinian Authority also imposes the death penalty pursuant to the PLO Revolutionary Penal Code, of 1979.\\" The PNA utilizes both military and special, state security courts for most death penalty cases.Death Penalty in the PA B'Tselem~~ Civil law Civil law used the customary law in Palestine: \\"Urf covered disputes such as contracts, family disputes, personal injury, and land matters.\\" Participatory justice Through the use of urf, Palestinians use alternative dispute resolution, specifically forms of participatory justice: \\"This system stressed conciliation, mediation, and family honour.\\" Palestinian Land Law The Palestinian Land Law is a law that prohibits Palestinians from selling land to citizens of Israel. The punishment for violators is the death penalty.

Terminal cisternae are enlarged areas of the sarcoplasmic reticulum surrounding the transverse tubules. These discrete regions within the muscle cell store calcium (increasing the capacity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release calcium) and release it when an action potential courses down the transverse tubules, eliciting muscle contraction. Because terminal cisternae ensure rapid calcium delivery, they are well developed in muscles that contract quickly, such as fast twitch skeletal muscle. Terminal cisternae then go on to release calcium, which binds to troponin. This releases tropomyosin, exposing active sites of the thin filament, actin. There are several mechanisms directly linked to the terminal cisternae which facilitate Excitation-Contraction coupling. When Excitation of the membrane arrives at the T-tubule nearest the muscle fiber, a Dihydropyridine (DHP) channel is activated. This is similar to a voltage gated calcium channel, but is not actually an ionotropic channel. Instead, it serves to activate Ryanodine, which will let calcium ions pass into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and triggers calcium release to the muscle fiber itself. A T-tubule surrounded by two terminal cisternae is referred to as a \\" triad\\" in physiology. As previously explained, the terminal cisternae along with the transverse tubules are the mechanisms of transduction from a nervous impulse to an actual muscle contraction.

Education Rathgeber was born in Paris, Montmartre on 11 June 1908. His father, Daniel Rathgeber was German, working for Robert Bosch GmbH, and his mother Hortense Desmousseaux was French. Just before the outbreak of first world war, he moved to Bad D√ºrkheim with his French mother, while his father served in the German army. From 1919-1924 he lived in Geneva, Switzerland and went to school at the College. In 1934 he completed an undergraduate degree at the Technische Hochschule in Stuttgart and in 1938 completed his doctorate in physics. During this period the physics department was very active at the Technische Hochschule, with teachers such as Erwin Schr√∂dinger, Erich Regener and Paul Peter Ewald. Rathgeber played an important role in Erich Regener's aerial cosmic ray measurements, as he was the only student at that time who owned a car, and was therefore asked to collect the balloons and measuring apparatus, which could travel up to a distance of 200 km from Stuttgart. On 2 August 1932 Rathgeber married Erich Regener's daughter, Erika Regener. Career In 1939 Rathgeber emigrated to Melbourne, Australia with his wife and two children. From 1940 to 1946 he worked as a part-time as a research physicist with the Optical Munitions Panel at the University of Melbourne. In 1940 he obtained the Thomas Lyle fellowship in physics at the University of Melbourne. In 1952 he shared the David Syme Research Prize and was asked by Harry Messel to take up a position as a reader at the University of Sydney. Economics research During the inter-war period, Rathgeber was heavily influenced by the economic ideas of Silvio Gesell which were popular in Germany at the time. Rathgeber retired in 1973 and in retirement returned to his earlier interest in economics and its connection with physics and in particular entropy and control system design. In 1974 he developed a theory explaining how random noise in the form of an error rate, as defined in Claude Shannon's information theory causes an inverse linear relationship between unemployment and inflation, but at the time such ideas were not taken seriously.

Gollobin wrote extensively on the civil liberties and civil rights of both the native- and foreign-born. He left a legacy of principled advocacy. Gollobin was born in Newark, New Jersey to first generation immigration parents from Czechoslovakia and the Ukraine, who had arrived as infants to the United States in 1885 . Career=Education= Gollobin attended the City College of City University of New York (CCNY) in the late 1920s and 1930s where he developed two lifelong interests: Latin and law, and was greatly influenced by one of his professors, the eminent Morris Raphael Cohen. While at CCNY he enrolled in Fordham Law School where he received his LL.B. degree and passed the New York Bar Examination in June 1933. =National Lawyers Guild= Gollobin was a founding member of the National Lawyers Guild (1937) where he was a strong force behind their earliest immigration work. He served first as associate counsel from 1936-1966 for the American Committee for the Protection of Foreign Born (ACPFB) and then as General Counsel from 1967-1982 where his approach to immigration issues had both legal and political dimensions. In 1938, Gollobin met Carol Weiss King, another founding member of the National Lawyers Guild and the lead lawyer for the ACPFB. He assisted the League of American Writers from 1937-1938 to successfully get a number of anti-Nazi German writers admitted to the United States and from 1938 through 1940 helped refugees from the Spanish Civil War. Gollobin was counsel to the Transport Workers Union of America (1939‚Äì1940) thereby securing citizenship for almost 1,500 subway workers. He continued citizenship matters for the Greater New York Industrial Union Council (CIO) from 1940-1942. =Military Service= Drafted into the U.S. Army in November 1942 as a Staff Sergeant, Gollobin was assigned to the Judge Advocate General Staff Section in the Philippines. In January 1946 he was one of the principal organizers of a GI demobilization demonstration movement in Manila and was honorably discharged in March, 1946. [Nature, Society and Thought, vol. 15, no. 1, 2002, pp. 5‚Äì39 by Erwin Marquit. Gollobin used the pseudonym John David.] https://www.jstor.org/pss/3022995 =Return to NLG= In 1946, Gollobin represented the National Lawyers Guild- NYC Chapter at the United Nations (1946) and took courses in International Law taught at Columbia Law School by Professor Philip Jessup who went on to serve at the State Department and sit on the International Court of Justice at the Hague. =Anti-HUAC efforts= In the late 1940s until 1966, Gollobin's practice expanded as the need for legal representation for citizens and non- citizens alike called before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC; HUAC) and the Senate International Security Committee. In 1948 before HUAC, Gollobin provided counsel to Victor Perlo, whom Elizabeth Bentley and Whittaker Chambers alleged had led (Bentley's \\"Perlo Group\\") and partaken in (Chambers's \\"Ware Group\\") a communist \\"apparatus\\" in Washington made up of Federal officials. (NLG fellow Carol Weiss King represented J. Peters in related hearings.) In 1960 Gollobin devised a strategy which turned the tables with HUAC as evident in the hearings in April 1964 in Buffalo, NY where witnesses skillfully and relentlessly challenged the legitimacy of the Committee (, Pam Sporn). In 1964 Gollobin fought for 16 years (1951‚Äì1967), all the way to the Supreme Court of the United States, before victory was achieved in Hong Hai Chew v. Colding [344 U.S. 590, 595 (1953)]. Gollobin's work with progressive organizations continued throughout the McCarthy period, and his interest in Asia, which dated from his years in the Philippines, impelled him to edit and write for the Far East Reporter from 1953-1986. He served on the board of the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law for 25 years (), and was a founder of The National Coalition for Haitian Rights. ( Starting in 1972, Gollobin began working with the thousands of Haitian refugees fleeing \\"Baby Doc\\" Duvalier's brutal regime, and also collaborated with Father Antoine Adrien and Anthony Cardinal Bevilacqua in this effort. ( .) Recognition Ira Gollobin was appointed Managing Attorney to a Commission of Inquiry by the Haitian Fathers and the National Council of Churches where he organized successful judicial attacks for Haitian asylum seekers in Haitian Refugee Center v. Smith 676 F.2d 1023 (5th Cir. 1982). See also, Harrisiades v. Shaughnessy. Gollobin testified before the United States Congress, reported to the Congressional Black Caucus, met with various bodies of the United Nations, secured support from legislators Bella Abzug and Shirley Chisholm and finally from President Jimmy Carter to grant the Haitians \\"entrant status.\\" Gollobin's commitment and contributions to two immigrant clients was the subject of a column in 1967 by the New York Post journalist James Wechsler. In recognition of his more than seven decades of legal work and lifelong commitment to social justice, particularly on behalf of the foreign born, Gollobin received numerous awards including from the National Council of Churches, the Center for Immigrants Rights, the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA; ), the National Lawyers Guild and a number of Haitian organizations. The brilliant attorney Ira Kurzban, author of Kurzban's Immigration Law Sourcebook, as well as the internationally renowned conductor of the Symphony of the United Nations, Joseph Eger (Einstein's Violin, Tarcher/Penguin, 2005) wrote about Gollobin too . Writing Ira Gollobin was the author of his self-published Dialectical Materialism: Its Laws, Categories and Practice (Petras Press, 1986), Winds of Change: An Immigration Lawyer's Perspective of Fifty Years (1987), and numerous articles on immigration policy, dialectics, East Asia, and Marxist theory that appeared in such publications as The Nation, Immigration Journal, Migration World Magazine, Jewish Life, Jewish Currents, Science and Society, Cafeteria Call, Philippines Today, China and Us, World View, Rights and Guild Notes.

After being an apprentice to Aubert, court jeweller to Queen Marie-Antoinette, he moved to Paris in 1780. He survived the French Revolution and, in 1802, was appointed jeweller to Emperor Napoleon. With the help of his son Fran√ßois Regnault (1779‚Äì1853), Nitot created jewellery symbolizing the power that Napoleon wished to convey.Henri Vever La bijouterie fran√ßaise au XIXe si√®cle (1800-1900) 1976 - Page 46 \\"Sa maison resta √† l'un de ses quatre fils, qui √©tait d√©j√† son associ√© : Fran√ßois-Regnault Nitot, n√© √† Paris en 1779.

Work  As official jeweller to Napoleon, Nitot made a number of significant pieces. He designed the Napoleon Tiara and the Imperial Sword. He also designed the Cameo Tiara for Jos√©phine before 1810, but no portraits of Jos√©phine wearing the Cameo exists (only one portrait of her daughter Hortense wearing the Cameo and dating from 1812 exists). Marie-√âtienne Nitot actually designed Jos√©phine's entire Emerald Parure that belongs today to the Royal family of Norway. The Leuchtenberg sapphire parure, now part of the Swedish royal family jewel foundation, is attributed to Nitot.

Most of the countries in the world are members of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and work together to establish common standards and recommended practices for civil aviation through that agency. Civil aviation includes two major categories: * Scheduled air transport, including all passenger and cargo flights operating on regularly scheduled routes; and * General aviation (GA), including all other civil flights, private or commercial Although scheduled air transport is the larger operation in terms of passenger numbers, GA is larger in the number of flights (and flight hours, in the U.S.) In the U.S., GA carries 166 million passengers each year, more than any individual airline, though less than all the airlines combined. Since 2004, the US Airlines combined have carried over 600 million passengers each year, and in 2014, they carried a combined 662,819,232 passengers.United States Depart of Transportation. \\"Bureau of Transportation Statistics \\". Retrieved 24 July 2015 Some countries also make a regulatory distinction based on whether aircraft are flown for hire like: * Commercial aviation includes most or all flying done for hire, particularly scheduled service on airlines; and * Private aviation includes pilots flying for their own purposes (recreation, business meetings, etc.) without receiving any kind of remuneration. A British Airways Boeing 747-400 departs London Heathrow Airport. This is an example of a commercial aviation service. All scheduled air transport is commercial, but general aviation can be either commercial or private. Normally, the pilot, aircraft, and operator must all be authorized to perform commercial operations through separate commercial licensing, registration, and operation certificates. History=Postwar aviation= After World War ‚Ö°, commercial aviation grew rapidly, using mostly ex-military pilots to transport people and cargo. Factories that had produced bombers were quickly adapted to the production of passenger aircraft like the Douglas DC-4. This growth was accelerated by the establishment of military airports throughout the world, either for combat use or training. These could easily be turned to civil aviation use. The first commercial jet airliner to fly was the British de Havilland Comet. By 1952, the British state airline BOAC had introduced the Comet into scheduled service. While it was a technical achievement, the airplane suffered a series of highly public failures, as the shape of the windows led to cracks due to metal fatigue. By the time the problems were overcome, other jet airliner designs such as the Boeing 707 had already entered service. During the COVID-19 pandemic, most airlines are struggling due to the decline in travel. https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/most- airlines-may-go-bankrupt-by-may-without-govt-action-on- coronavirus/articleshow/74647567.cms Civil aviation authorities The Convention on International Civil Aviation (the \\"Chicago Convention\\") was originally established in 1944; it states that signatories should collectively work to harmonize and standardize the use of airspace for safety, efficiency and regularity of air transport. Each signatory country, of which there are at least 193, has a civil aviation authority (such as the FAA in the United States) to oversee the following areas of civil aviation:Also federal administration relies on 99.99% * Personnel licensing -- regulating the basic training and issuance of licenses and certificates. * Flight operations -- carrying out safety oversight of commercial operators. * Airworthiness -- issuing certificates of registration and certificates of airworthiness to civil aircraft, and overseeing the safety of aircraft maintenance organizations. * Aerodromes -- designing and constructing aerodrome facilities. * Air traffic services -- managing the traffic inside of a country's airspace. * Security and facilitations -- Statistics The World Bank lists monotonously growing numbers for the number of passengers transported per year worldwide with a preliminary all-time high in 2015 of 3.44 billion passengers. Likewise, the number of registered carrier departures worldwide has reached a peak in 2015 with almost 33 million takeoffs. In the US alone, the passenger miles \\"computed by summing the products of the aircraft-miles flown on each inter airport segment multiplied by the number of passengers carried on that segment\\" have reached in 2014 (as compared to highway car traffic with ). The global seasonally adjusted revenue passenger kilometers (RPK) per month peaked at more than (~6.6 trillion per year, corresponding to roughly 2000 km per passenger) in January 2016, a 7% rise over one year.

It was a retailer of discount variety merchandise including gifts, cosmetics, clothing, books, craft goods, hardware, stationery, toys, jewellery, kitchenware, caneware, haberdashery, manchester, small electrical goods, luggage and furniture.An Introduction to Clints Crazy Bargains handout / folder History  The Business was initially a single store (Bankstown, NSW, Australia) and a market stall operation dealing primarily in distressed and surplus merchandise bought from public auction. A second store in Leichhardt (October 1980) followed by the move into substantially larger premises of in Bankstown (April 1981) saw the commencement of a serious attempt to build a new retail concept. The St Marys store (July 1983), spectacularly successful in , became the prototype of the new \\"Discount Variety\\" or \\"Bargain Store\\". As the business evolved through wholesaling and new shop openings, techniques and policies changed constantly, but the theme of the \\"Bargain Store\\" remained. A diverse range of goods perceived to be cheap. Throughout the early and mid 1980s, the principal product source continued to be distressed or opportunity merchandise. As stock needs increased the weakness of such a dependence emerged, low cost manufactured goods from South East Asia became the target. Volandu Pty Ltd was formed in October 1985 as an import company with the same ownership as Clints. Wholesaling was commenced to increase purchasing power and credibility overseas. The continuing growth of Clints and similar chains in other states brought about fanatic import volume increases. From 100 containers in 1987 to over 3000 in 1995. The original 23 000 square foot warehouse was replaced by a 50 000 square feet warehouse in 1990, only to be replaced by a 215 000 square feet warehouse complex purchased in January 1992. Also in 1992, a warehouse in China was completed for the consolidation of goods for Clints and other Volandu customers. This facility allowed flexibility and control over a massive range of cheap products being produced in Southern China. An additional distribution warehouse of 100 000 square feet was purchased in February 1995 in Footscay, Victoria, Australia, to service the then growing number of Victorian stores and to facilitate the movement of increasing volumes of merchandise between Sydney and Melbourne. The business operated 116 stores across New South Wales, Victoria and the ACT, eventually acquired Fair Dinkum Bargains and Silly Sollys. Acquisitions  In 2000 the Clint's Crazy Bargains business was sold to the New Zealand company The Warehouse.The Warehouse Group: Entry into Australia - Journal of Management & Organization (JMO) In 2008 the remaining stores were sold to Australian Discount Retail a group of Australian investors and subsequently renamed Sam's Warehouse.

Konishi had originally arrived in Minneapolis earlier that month, traveled to Bismarck, North Dakota, then to Fargo, North Dakota and finally to Detroit Lakes, Minnesota where she died. Her death was ruled a suicide, but some erroneous media stories at the time reported that she, under the mistaken impression that the 1996 film Fargo was based on a true story, had died trying to locate the money hidden by Steve Buscemi's character, Carl Showalter.  Suicide  Investigations by American film writer/director Paul Berczeller discovered the Fargo theory surrounding Konishi's death resulted from a misunderstanding between Konishi and one of the Bismarck police officers with whom she had been speaking. The story was then misreported by the media, leading to the urban legend that she had come to the United States to search for the money in the film. In reality, Konishi had become depressed after losing her job at a Tokyo travel agency (owing to its bankruptcy), being unable to find another job, and also had begun to drink. She had come to Minneapolis because‚Äîit is speculated‚Äîit was a place that she had previously visited with her former lover, a married American businessman whom she had met in Tokyo but who had left after taking another job in Singapore. Konishi had been seen wandering Detroit Lakes before she apparently decided to commit suicide by lying down in the snow after consuming two bottles of champagne. This was supported by the discovery that she had made a forty-minute phone call to her former lover in Singapore the previous night, a suicide note she had sent to her parents expressing her intent to kill herself and that she had disposed of most of the belongings she had brought with her to the U.S. before she left Bismarck. Konishi's story was detailed in the 2003 short documentary film This Is a True Story, directed by Paul Berczeller, in which she was portrayed by Mimi Ohmori. In addition, the urban legend surrounding her death is the basis for the 2014 film Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter.

Usage of the term was inspired by Marc Porat‚Äôs categories of ages of human civilization: the Agricultural Age, the Industrial Age and the Information Age (1978). Informatization is to the Information Age what industrialization was to the Industrial Age. It has been stated that: :The Agricultural Age has brought about the agriculturization of the planet. The Industrial Age has caused among other things the industrialization of agriculture. The Information Age has resulted to the informatization of the agricultural industry (Flor, 1993). The term has mostly been used within the context of national development. Everett Rogers defines informatization as the process through which new communication technologies are used as a means for furthering development as a nation becomes more and more an information society. However, some observers, such as Alexander Flor (1986) have cautioned about the negative impact of informatization on traditional societies. Recently, the technological determinism dimension has been highlighted in informatization. Randy Kluver of Texas A&M; University defines informatization as the process primarily by which information technologies, such as the World Wide Web and other communication technologies, have transformed economic and social relations to such an extent that cultural and economic barriers are minimized. Kluver expands the concept to encompass the civic and cultural arenas. He believes that it is a process whereby information and communication technologies shape cultural and civic discourse. G. Wang describes the same phenomenon (1994) which she calls \\"informatization\\" as a \\"process\\" of change that features (a) the use of informatization and IT (information technologies) to such an extent that they become the dominant forces in commanding economic, political, social and cultural development; and (b) unprecedented growth in the speed, quantity, and popularity of information production and distribution.\\" Origin of the term The term informatisation was coined by Simon Nora and Alain Minc in their publication L'Informatisation de la soci√©t√©: Rapport √† M. le Pr√©sident de la R√©publique which was translated in English in 1980 as The Computerization of Society: A report to the President of France. (SAOUG) However, in an article published in 1987 Minc preferred to use informatisation and not computerization. After the 1978 publication the concept was adopted in French, German and English subject literatures and was broadened to include more aspects than only computers and telecommunications (SAOUG). Social impact Informatization has many far-reaching consequences in society. Kim (2004) observes that these include repercussions in economics, politics and other aspects of modern living. In the economic sphere, for example, information is viewed as a focal resource for development, replacing the centrality of labor and capital during the industrial age. In the political arena, there are increased opportunities for participative democracy with the advent of information and communication technology (ICT) that provide easy access to information on varied social and political issues. In economic systems Industrialization propelled transformation of the economic system from agricultural age to modernized economies, and so informatization ushered the industrial age into an information-rich economy. Unlike the agricultural and industrial ages where economics refers to optimization of scarce resources, the information age deals with maximization of abundant resources. Alexander Flor (2008) wrote that informatization gives rise to information- based economies and societies wherein information naturally becomes a dominant commodity or resource. The accumulation and efficient use of knowledge has played a central role in the transformation of the economy (Linden 2004). Globalization Over the years, globalization and informatization have \\"redefined industries, politics, cultures, and perhaps the underlying rules of social order\\" (Friedman 1999). Although they explain different phenomena, their social, political, economic, and cultural functions remarkably overlaps. \\"Although globalization ultimately refers to the integration of economic institutions, much of this integration occurs through the channels of technology. Although international trade is not a new phenomenon, the advent of communications technologies has accelerated the pace and scope of trade\\" (Kluver). ::a) Globalization and Informatization will have great impact on cultural and social consequences of society. ::b) \\"Globalization and informatization are likely to diminish the concept of the national as a political institution\\" (Poster 1999). Friedman (1999) argues that as nation states decline in importance, multi-national corporations, nongovernmental organizations, and \\"superempowered individuals\\" such as George Soros gain influence and importance. As these non-political organizations and institutions gain importance, there are inevitable challenges to political, economic, and cultural processes. ::c) On the other hand, globalization and informatization allow for efficient flow of information. Individuals and societies are, therefore, greatly empowered to engage in international arena for economic, political, and cultural resources. ::d) \\"There is proliferation of information about lifestyles, religions, and cultural issues. The telecommunications and computer networks also allow for unprecedented global activism. This democratization of information increases the potential for international harmony, although it by no means guarantees it\\" (Kluver). ::e) These twin forces greatly affects \\"centuries of tradition, local autonomy, and cultural integrity.\\" ::f) \\"Finally, one of the potentially most devastating impact of the forces of globalization and informatization is that there is created an insidious conflict between the new global economic order and the local, or even tribal, interests\\" (Kluver). Measurement Kim (2004) proposed to measure the informatization in a country using a composite measure made up of the following extraneous variables: Education, R&D; Expenditure, Agricultural Sector and Intellectual Property. Kim also relates increasing democracy as evidence of social informatization. It supposedly take into consideration the three approaches to conceptualizing informatization namely the economic, technological, and stock. Each can be measured with economic data (e.g. GDP), ICT data (e.g. number of computers per population), and amount of information (e.g. number of published technological journals) respectively. Such composite measure is similar to the World Bank's Knowledge Assessment Methodology (KAM) Variables (2008) which are clustered into: overall performance of the economy, economic incentive and institutional regime, innovation system, education and human resources, and information and communication technology. =Difficulties with measurement= The measurement for the level of informatization is an ongoing area of development. Among the issues are the ambiguity of the definition of \\"information\\" and whether this entity can be quantifiable in contrast to the tangible products of industrialization. Taylor and Zang (2007) explored the issues behind the limitations of current theoretical models in terms of quantifying the positive impacts of ICT projects, and provided critiques of the information indicators used to gauge and justify informatization projects. International organizations such as the United Nations, through its World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) and International Telecommunication Union (ITU); and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) also recognize this challenge and have initiated efforts to improve the methodologies for measuring an \\"information society\\". National laws Informatization is recognized by states as important to national development. Some states have created laws implementing or regulating informatization. In Russia the State Duma enacted the Federal Law on Information, Informatization, and the Protection of Information on January 25, 1995. It was signed into law by President Boris Yeltsin on February 20, 1995. Azerbaijan had a Law on Information, Informatization and Protection of Information in 1998.  Through TV white space (TVWS) technology  TV white space refers to the unused TV channels between the active ones in the VHF and UHF spectrum. TV spectrum is commonly referred to as television \\"white spaces\\". TV white space can be used to provide broadband internet access, particularly in remote and rural areas (Edwards, 2016), and as such can serve as a tool for increasing information access and social and economic development. In 2008 The Federal Communications Commission voted to reallocate unlicensed white space spectrum for public use (White Space, n.d.)

Written by Dick Wolf, the film is about a recently orphaned millionairess who falls in love with a young yacht racing captain who isn't completely truthful with her about his past. The film was nominated for the Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best (Mystery) Motion Picture in 1989. Plot Young yachting captain Tim Whalen (Rob Lowe) is having an affair with Brooke Morrison (Kim Cattrall), the wife of his boss, Granger Morrison (Brian Davies), in the upscale town of Southampton, Long Island. Tim is the new captain of Granger's racing sailboat Obsession. Young heiress Olivia Lawrence (Meg Tilly), following the recent death of her mother, returns home to Southampton after graduating from college. At a party, Olivia is introduced to Tim, who asks her to dance. Impressed with her knowledge of sailing, Tim asks her to go sailing with him, and she accepts. Olivia is living in the family mansion with her alcoholic stepfather, Tony Gateworth (John Glover), and his new live-in girlfriend, Anne Briscoe (Dana Delany). Her mother's will provided that Gateworth retain access to the family's eight properties. Olivia has nothing but contempt for her stepfather, who married her mother for her money. At her family attorney's office in New York City, Olivia learns she cannot restrict Gateworth's access to her homes, and the nearly one million dollars a year he receives from the estate barely covers his gambling debts. Olivia and Tim go sailing on her boat Masquerade, which was her late father's pride and joy. Later, at Olivia's mansion, they are confronted by a drunk Gateworth who insults Tim, his former sailing competitor. In the coming days, Olivia and Tim begin dating and eventually fall in love. However, Olivia's newfound happiness is soon offset by another ugly confrontation with Gateworth who tells her as her \\"guardian\\" he wants Tim out of her life. Olivia confides to her aunt that Tim is the first man she has felt comfortable with and that he isn't interested in her money. Later that day, at a lobster house on the outskirts of town, Gateworth and Tim meet surreptitiously to discuss their conspiracy to murder Olivia for her money. When Tim expresses doubts, Gateworth threatens to expose his past. He tells him the next step is to gain Olivia's confidence by having Tim defend her against him. That weekend, Olivia and Tim have passionate sex in the mansion. Afterwards, a drunken Gateworth breaks into Olivia's room as planned, but Tim double-crosses him and kills Gateworth with his own pistol. Believing they will be accused of murdering Gateworth, Olivia covers up Tim's role in the killing by claiming she killed Gateworth in self-defense. Tim establishes an alibi with an unsuspecting Brooke by resetting her bedside clock. During the investigation, Officer Mike McGill (Doug Savant)‚Äîa childhood friend with a romantic interest in Olivia‚Äîfinds evidence that Tim may have been involved in the killing, but he does not report it to his captain, presumably because of his feelings for Olivia. Gateworth's girlfriend, Anne Briscoe, begins questioning the investigation's findings, and tells the authorities about Olivia and Tim. Meanwhile, Tim breaks up with Brooke, who later confirms Tim's alibi to the police. Not long after Anne Briscoe informs McGill that her friend saw Gateworth at a diner with Tim, she is found hanged in an apparent suicide. McGill requests an autopsy. While sailing aboard Masquerade, Olivia asks Tim to marry her, but he is reluctant, telling her he once spent 30 days in jail for writing bad checks. He also tells her about his affair with Brooke Morrison. His \\"honesty\\" convinces Olivia he is the right man, and the couple are soon married. Later, Olivia reveals she is pregnant. That night, Tim drives to the marina where he meets secretly with McGill, who was part of the original conspiracy‚Äîwho in fact planned everything. Tim is reluctant about killing Olivia, but McGill insists she must die in a staged car accident. He threatens to put Tim away for Gateworth's murder if he doesn't cooperate. When McGill learns that Tim has no intention of killing Olivia and that they are planning to sail for Florida on Masquerade the next day, he sabotages Olivia's sailboat and plants incriminating evidence in Tim's linen drawer. Tim discovers McGill's treachery and races to the marina to save Olivia, but is killed in the gas explosion meant to kill Olivia. In the marina office afterwards, Olivia discovers a newspaper clipping with a picture of Tim, Gateworth and McGill, just as McGill enters the office. Seeing that she has figured out the conspiracy, he tries to kill her. In the ensuing struggle, Olivia pushes McGill out a window causing his death. At Tim's funeral, Olivia learns from her family attorney that Tim recently insisted he be removed from Olivia's will, and however it may have started, he came to love Olivia in the end.

In his review in the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert gave the film three of four stars. Ebert singling out Meg Tilly's performance wrote, \\"Tilly's acting style is the right choice for the movie: Her dreaminess, which at first seems distracting, becomes an important part of the suspense, because while she drifts in her romantic reverie, a sweet smile on her face, we're mentally screaming at her to wake up and smell the coffee.\\" In her review in The Washington Post, Rita Kempley called the film \\"mushy\\" and \\"pockey\\". Kempley reduces the director's efforts to \\"a gym teacher's sense of the erotic matched with a jackhammer's flair for the subtleties of psychological artifice.\\" =Awards and nominations= * 1989 Edgar Allan Poe Award Nomination for Best Motion Picture (Dick Wolf) =Box office= The film earned $15,855,828 in gross revenue in the United States. =Film ratings= In New Zealand, the film was rated M for offensive language and sexual references.

This was the first poem of Johnson's to be published, and consists of 119 lines written in Latin verse. The whole translation was completed in two days and was submitted to Pope for appraisal. Background In 1728, Johnson was admitted into Pembroke College, Oxford, and William Jorden was made his tutor. During his first weeks, Johnson was assigned various poem topics to write on, which he refused to complete. However, he did complete one poem, the first of his tutorial exercises, on which he spent comparably significant time (that of two rereads), and which provoked surprise and applause. Jorden, impressed with Johnson's skill at Latin verse, asked his student to produce a Latin translation of Pope's Messiah as a Christmas exercise. Johnson completed half of the translation in one afternoon and the rest the following morning. The poem was finished quickly because Johnson was hoping for patronage that would help him overcome the financial difficulties that he was experiencing while at Pembroke. After Johnson finished the poem, it was sent to his home, and his father Michael Johnson, a bookseller, immediately printed the work. It was later contained in a collected of work by the Pembroke tutor John Husbands titled Miscellany of Poems (1731). Messiah Pope's Messiah deals with Virgil's Fourth Eclogue which was said to predict the birth of Christ. The poem merges the prophecy of Isaiah about the Messiah with wording that echoes Virgil. Johnson's translation into Latin relies on Virgil directly and incorporates more of the Eclogue's language. Critical response The work was immediately favoured among students of Oxford and Husbands's Miscellany of Poems (1731) contained a list of subscribers including half of the enrolled students at Pembroke. Although the poem brought him praise, it did not bring him the material benefit he had hoped for. The poem was brought to Pope's attention by Charles Arbuthnot, the son of Pope's friend John Arbuthnot; according to Sir John Hawkins, Pope praised the work when he claimed that he could not tell if it was \\"the original\\" or not. However, John Taylor, his friend, dismissed this incident as \\"praise\\" by claiming that \\"Pope said it was very finely done, but that he had seen it before, and said nothing more either of it or its Authour.\\" Instead of Johnson being the first to send Pope a copy, Johnson's father had already published the translation before Johnson sent a copy to Pope, and Pope could have been remarking about it being a duplication of the published edition that he earlier read. This possibility is reinforced by Johnson becoming \\"very angry\\" towards his father. Johnson told Taylor, \\"if it had not been his Father [who had done this] he would have cut his throat,\\" even though Pope did praise the poem even if it may not have been during the second time Pope saw the work. Regardless, Johnson \\"had gained great applause\\" for the poem. 20th-century criticism focused on the poem as a model of Johnson's ability to write; Walter Jackson Bate praised the work and called it a \\"major effort\\".

In a coincidence, the incident occurred on the same day as the Zagreb mid-air collision. Hijacking The Boeing 727 plane took off from New York's LaGuardia Airport and was headed to O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. The hijackers were Slobodan Vla≈°iƒá, Zvonko Bu≈°iƒá, his wife Julienne Bu≈°iƒá, Petar Mataniƒá, and Frane Pe≈°ut. The hijackers claimed to have a bomb with them as they seized control of the plane in the 95th minute of its flight. The group redirected the plane to Montreal's Mirabel International Airport where they refueled and told officials that they had planted a bomb in a locker at Grand Central Terminal and gave them instructions on finding it. They demanded that an appeal to the American people concerning Croatia's independence be printed in the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Chicago Tribune, the Los Angeles Times, and the International Herald Tribune. The plane was then flown to Gander, Newfoundland, where 35 of its passengers were released. From there the plane was accompanied by a larger TWA plane that guided it to Keflav√≠k, Iceland. The hijackers' initial European destination was London, but the British government refused them permission to land.Bombs for Croatia (Part I), Time Magazine During the hijacking the device at Grand Central Terminal was found and taken to Rodman's Neck Firing Range where police attempted to dismantle it rather than detonate it. After setting a cutting instrument on the two wires attached to the device, the officers retreated from the pit for several minutes. When they returned to the pit to continue dismantling the device, it exploded and killed NYPD officer Brian Murray, and wounded another, Terrence McTigue. The plane landed in Paris where the hijackers surrendered after direct talks with U.S. ambassador Kenneth Rush, and their supposedly explosive devices were revealed to be fakes, simple pressure cookers.Bombs for Croatia (Part II), Time Magazine As the police took Julienne Bu≈°iƒá away, the plane's pilot gave her a hug in gratitude for her calming of the passengers during the hijacking.The Hijackee Syndrome, Time Magazine Imprisonment Frane Pe≈°ut served 12 years in prison.

June 24, 2008. In 2003, the Croatian Parliament passed a resolution that Bu≈°iƒá should be transferred to Croatia, which it submitted to the Council of Europe. The liberal Croatian Helsinki Committee also took up the cause of Bu≈°iƒá's release.

Agenda-setting  Agenda-setting is a concept created and developed by Dr. Max McCombs and Dr. Donald Shaw. It is a function of mass media, highlighting issues seen as more important at the expense of other news. In this manner, the media forces attention towards a certain issue.https://books.google.ca/books?id=XeP1O_vhZAC&pg;=PA68&lpg;=PA68&dq;=agenda+setting+theory+and+terrorism&source;=bl&ots;=SmO3mwNU_E&sig;=TeVBYAOYOR9mq89WfXXtCIYLzz8&hl;=en&sa;=X&ei;=6ZJuVLqJCs71yAT84IKgCw&ved;=0CCkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q;=agenda%20setting%20theory%20and%20terrorism&f;=false For terrorist groups, this agenda setting function is a key tool for communicating a message across a nation or around the world. Terrorist groups may manipulate or compel influential media organisations, such as the New York Times and the Washington Post, to assist them in this. Prior to the TWA Flight 355 hijacking, the Croatian criminals demanded that flyers be dropped throughout large cities in order to force attention to their motivations and arranged with certain newspapers to use their statements to report on the issue.

The technique originates in the 18th century, but was only used for a short period. Between 1765 and around 1820, German immigrant cabinetmakers in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, used it to decorate the surface of chests. The Deitrich chest of 1783 is now in the Smithsonian. Commercial reproducers of such chests may rarely re-create this inlay technique as well.  Technique  The inlay technique is simple. A small groove is carved into the surface of the wood, then molten sulfur is poured into the groove. Once cooled and hard, the surface may easily be scraped flush. Sulfur is used as it has a low melting point, easily achieved on a hotplate. This also reduces the risk of charring the wood with a hotter liquid inlay material. On cooling, sulfur also expands slightly, locking it into place. The colour of the sulfur inlay is a pale yellow or off-white. Overheating the sulfur causes it to darken to brown, and also produces noxious fumes and a risk of fire. Antiquarians unfamiliar with sulfur inlay have mistaken old examples for varieties of beeswax or white lead.  Related techniques  * Pewter may be inlaid by a similar process, albeit rather hotter, giving a silvery metallic inlay. Wood's metal has also been used as a low-temperature alternative. * Sulfur has also been used as a historical hot- melt glue for setting ironwork into stone, or for bonding stone together. * Niello uses the darkening effect of sulfur compounds on silver.

The film stars Fred MacMurray and Joan Bennett. The screenplay was written by Kenyon Nicholson and Bogart Rogers, based on story Wild Wings by Bogart Rogers and Frank Mitchell Dazey. 13 Hours by Air was also the forerunner of the disaster film, a genre featuring a complex, heavily character-driven ensemble cast film, exploring the personal dramas and interactions that develop among the passengers and crew as they deal with a deadly onboard emergency. Plot Airline pilot Jack Gordon (Fred MacMurray) on a flight from New York to San Francisco, is immediately attracted to beautiful passenger Felice Rollins (Joan Bennett). Known as a \\"lady's man\\", he bets stewardess Vi Johnson (Ruth Donnelly) that he will take Felice out to dinner that evening. A jewel robbery is in the news and a beautiful blonde is implicated, with Jack suspecting that Felice may be the culprit. On a stop over in Chicago, Jack learns instead that his passenger is a wealthy socialite at odds with another passenger, Count Stephani (Fred Keating). Jack worries that he may have a crisis involving the Count when he finds Stephani has a gun aboard. Other passengers include Dr. Evarts (Brian Donlevy) and Curtis Palmer (Alan Baxter), both of whom seem to be harboring a secret. Felice is trying to get to San Francisco in order to prevent her sister from marrying the Count's brother, but the flight runs into bad weather. Jack and Freddie Scott (John Howard), his co-pilot, are persuaded to fly on, but are eventually forced to make an emergency landing. Dr. Evarts tells Jack he is a federal agent pursuing Palmer, a notorious criminal. Palmer shoots Freddie and Dr. Everts and hijacks the aircraft. Jack manages to overcome Palmer, and with the help of Felice, is able to take off and fly to San Francisco. When the flight lands, he is able to have his dinner with Felice, collecting his bet, knowing that he will need the money for a marriage licence.

Under the working title of 20 Hours by Air, the production changed its name to more closely approximate the actual flying time to fly cross-country in the United States, based on the recent exploits of pilots such as Wiley Post. Filmed at the Alhambra Airport, California, in Cleveland, Ohio, and Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, using United Air Lines Boeing 247 airliners. Second unit filming involved a flight from Newark to Los Angeles to obtain actual footage to be used in the film. An aircraft assigned to the production was also involved in a minor accident.\\"Notes: 13 Hours by Air\\". Tunrer Classic Movies. Retrieved: December 14, 2014.

The device of tossing a miscellany of humans and motives together on a bus, plane, train or airliner and letting them work out their destiny is as formular as the Bartender's Guide and has been used as often, but Bogart Rogers's and Frank Mitchell Dazey's story has been screened with a shrewd sense of pace, with a purposeful preservation of suspense and a knack for comic interlude.\\"Nugent, Frank S. \\"' 13 Hours by Air,' a Transcontinental Melodrama.\\" The New York Times, April 30, 1936. 13 Hours by Air is one of over 700 Paramount Productions, filmed between 1929 and 1949, which were sold to MCA/Universal in 1958.

Individual inclusions are oval or round in shape and consist of clear glass, together with a small round vapor bubble and in some cases a small square spinel crystal. The black arrow points to one good example, but there are several others. The occurrence of multiple inclusions within a single crystal is relatively common A melt inclusion is a small parcel or \\"blobs\\" of melt(s) that is entrapped by crystals growing in magma and eventually forming igneous rocks. In many respects it is analogous to a fluid inclusion. Characteristics Melt inclusions are generally small - most are less than 80 micrometres across (a micrometre is one thousandth of a millimeter, or about 0.00004 inches). They may contain a number of different constituents, including glass (which represents melt that has been quenched by rapid cooling), small crystals and a separate vapour-rich bubble. They occur in the crystals that can be found in igneous rocks, such as for example quartz, feldspar, olivine, pyroxene, nepheline, magnetite, perovskite and apatite. Melt inclusions can be found in both volcanic and plutonic rocks. In addition, melt inclusions can contain immiscible (non-miscible) melt phases. Their study is an exceptional way to find direct evidences for presence of two or more melts at entrapment. Analysis Although they are small, melt inclusions can provide an abundance of useful information. Using microscopic observations and a range of chemical microanalysis techniques geochemists and igneous petrologists can obtain a range of unique information from melt inclusions. The most common uses of melt inclusions is studying the composition and compositional evolution of magmas existed in the history of specific magma systems. This is because inclusions can act like \\"fossils\\" - trapping and preserving these melts before they are modified by later processes. In addition, because they are trapped at high pressures (P) and temperatures (T) many melt inclusions also provide important information about the entrapping conditions (P-T) and their volatile content (such as H2O, CO2, S and Cl) that drive explosive volcanic eruptions. History Henry Clifton Sorby, in 1858, was the first to document microscopic melt inclusions in crystals. The study of melt inclusions has been driven more recently by the development of sophisticated chemical analysis techniques. Scientists from the former Soviet Union lead the study of melt inclusions in the decades after World War II, and developed methods for heating melt inclusions under a microscope, so changes could be directly observed.

As a schoolboy at Scotch College, Heywood excelled in multiple sports including tennis, in which he won the Victorian Schoolboys Doubles title in 1942, and football, where he captained the team into an undefeated year in 1942. Heywood made his VFL debut in the 1943 season and after sporadic appearances that year was a regular selection in 1944, playing 16 of a possible 18 games. He was used mostly as a half forward flanker. His football career was put on hold in 1945 with his service in the RAAF taking precedence. After being discharged from Darwin in 1946 he moved back to Melbourne where he undertook and completed a Commerce Degree. He won premierships in the Victorian Amateur Football Association with the University Blacks during his time at Melbourne University. With the Melbourne Football Club suffering from injuries in the 1948 finals series, Heywood and his University Blacks teammate Denis Cordner were surprise recalls for the preliminary final against Collingwood despite both not having played with the club for four years. Melbourne won the game and took on Essendon in the Grand Final, with Heywood lining up in his favoured half forward flank position. For the first time in VFL history the Grand Final was drawn and Heywood lost his place in the team for the replay when Bob McKenzie returned from injury. Heywood played another full season in 1950, including a game against Hawthorn where he kicked six goals, and retired after ten senior appearances in 1951. As a sports commentator, Heywood called football games and appeared on panel shows on ABC TV as well as commentating on tennis matches at the same network. He also commented on Saturday football games for radio station 3AW. He was a committeeman of the Melbourne Cricket Club and a promoter of its Gallery of Sport.

Consumer protection measures are often established by law. Such laws are intended to prevent businesses from engaging in fraud or specified unfair practices in order to gain an advantage over competitors or to mislead consumers. They may also provide additional protection for the general public which may be impacted by a product (or its production) even when they are not the direct purchaser or consumer of that product. For example, government regulations may require businesses to disclose detailed information about their products‚Äîparticularly in areas where public health or safety is an issue, such as with food or automobiles. Consumer protection is linked to the idea of consumer rights and to the formation of consumer organizations, which help consumers make better choices in the marketplace and pursue complaints against businesses. Entities that promote consumer protection include government organizations (such as the Federal Trade Commission in United States), self-regulating business organizations (such as the Better Business Bureaus in the US, Canada, England, etc.), and non-governmental organizations that advocate for consumer protection laws and help to ensure their enforcement (such as consumer protection agencies and watchdog groups). A consumer is defined as someone who acquires goods or services for direct use or ownership rather than for resale or use in production and manufacturing. Consumer interests can also serve consumers, consistent with economic efficiency, but this topic is treated in competition law. Consumer protection can also be asserted via non-government organizations and individuals as consumer activism. Concept of Consumer law Consumer protection law or consumer law is considered as an area of law that regulates private law relationships between individual consumers and the businesses that sell those goods and services. Consumer protection covers a wide range of topics, including but not necessarily limited to product liability, privacy rights, unfair business practices, fraud, misrepresentation, and other consumers/business interactions. It is a way of preventing frauds and scams from service and sales contracts, eligible fraud, bill collector regulation, pricing, utility turnoffs, consolidation, personal loans that may lead to bankruptcy. The following lists consumer legislation at the nation-state level. In the EU member states Germany and the United Kingdom, there is also the applicability of law at the EU level to be considered; this applies on the basis of subsidiarity. =Australia= In Australia, the corresponding agency is the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission or the individual State Consumer Affairs agencies. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission has responsibility for consumer protection regulation of financial services and products. However, in practice, it does so through privately run EDR schemes such as the Financial Ombudsman Service (Australia). =Brazil= In Brazil, consumer protection is regulated by the Consumer's Defense Code (C√≥digo de Defesa do Consumidor), as mandated by the 1988 Constitution of Brazil. Brazilian law mandates \\"The offer and presentation of products or services must ensure correct, clear, accurate and conspicuous information in the Portuguese language about their characteristics, qualities, quantity, composition, price, guarantee, validity and origin, among other data, as well as the risks they pose to the health and safety of consumers.\\" In Brazil, the consumer does not have to bring forward evidence that the defender is guilty. Instead, the defense has to bring forward evidence that they are innocent. In the case of Brazil, they narrowly define what a consumer, supplier, product, and services are, so that they can protect consumers from international trade laws and protect them from negligence and misconduct from international suppliers. =Germany= Germany, as a member state of the European Union, is bound by the consumer protection directives of the European Union; residents may be directly bound by EU regulations. A minister of the federal cabinet is responsible for consumer rights and protection (Verbraucherschutzminister). In the current cabinet of Angela Merkel, this is Katarina Barley. When issuing public warnings about products and services, the issuing authority has to take into account that this affects the supplier's constitutionally protected economic liberty, see Bundesverwaltungsgericht (Federal Administrative Court) Case 3 C 34.84, 71 BVerwGE 183). =India= In India, consumer protection is specified in The Consumer Protection Act, 2019. Under this law, Separate Consumer Dispute Redress Forums have been set up throughout India in each and every district in which a consumer can file his/her complaint on a simple paper with nominal court fees and his/her complaint will be decided by the Presiding Officer of the District Level. The complaint can be filed by both the consumer of a goods as well as of the services. An appeal could be filed to the State Consumer Disputes Redress Commissions and after that to the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC). The procedures in these tribunals are relatively less formal and more people friendly and they also take less time to decide upon a consumer disputeV. Balakrishna Eradi, \\"Consumer Protection and National Consumer Disputes Redress Commission\\" . New Delhi: National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. Accessed 25 June 2013. when compared to the years-long time taken by the traditional Indian judiciary. In recent years, many effective judgments have been passed by some state and National Consumer Forums. Indian Contract Act, 1872 lays down the conditions in which promises made by parties to a contract will be legally binding on each other. It also lays down the remedies available to aggregate party if the other party fails to honor his promise. The Sale of Goods Act of 1930 act provides some safeguards to buyers of goods if goods purchased do not fulfill the express or implied conditions and warranties. The Agriculture Produce Act of 1937 act provides grade standards for agricultural commodities and livestock products. It specifies the conditions which govern the use of standards and lays down the procedure for grading, marking and packaging of agricultural produce. The quality mark provided under the act is known as AGMARK-Agricultural Marketing. =Nigeria= The Nigerian government has a duty to protect its people from any form of harm to human health through the use and purchase of items to meet daily needs. In light of this, the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC), whose aim is to protect and enhance consumers' interest through information, education, and enforcement of the rights of consumers was established by an Act of Parliament to promote and protect the interest of consumers over all products and services. In a nutshell, it is empowered to eliminate hazardous & substandard goods from the market. Provide speedy redress to consumer complaints and petition arisen from fraud, unfair practice and exploitation of the consumer. On 5 February 2019, the President of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari, assented to the new Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission Bill, 2018. Thus, the bill became a law of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and binding on entities and organizations so specified in the Act. The long title of the Act reads: \\"This Act establishes the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and the Competition and Consumer Protection Tribunal for the promotion of competition in the Nigerian market at all levels by eliminating monopolies, prohibiting abuse of dominant market position and penalizing other restrictive trade and business practices.\\" The Act further repealed the hitherto Nigerian Consumer Protection Council Act and transferred its core mandate to the new Commission. =Taiwan= Modern Taiwanese law has been heavily influenced by European civil law systems, particularly German and Swiss law. The Civil Code in Taiwan contains five books: General Principles, Obligations, Rights over Things, Family, and Succession. The second book of the Code, the Book of Obligations, provided the basis from which consumers could bring products liability actions prior to the enactment of the CPL. The Consumer Protection Law (CPL) in Taiwan, as promulgated on 11 January 1994, and effective on 13 January 1993, specifically protects the interests and safety of customers using the products or services provided by business operators. The Consumer Protection Commission of Executive Yuan serves as an ombudsman supervising, coordinating, reporting any unsafe products/services and periodically reviewing the legislation. According to the Pacific Rim Law & Policy Association and the American Chamber of Commerce, in a 1997 critical study, the law has been criticized by stating that \\"although many agree that the intent of the CPL is fair, the CPL's various problems, such as ambiguous terminology, favoritism towards consumer protection groups, and the compensation liability defense, must be addressed before the CPL becomes a truly effective piece of legislation that will protect consumers\\"Carol T. Juang, \\"The Taiwan Consumer Protection Law: Attempt to Protect Consumers Proves Ineffective\\" Pacific Rim Law & Policy Association, 1997. =United Kingdom= The United Kingdom, is not in the European Union, but is in the transition period (until end of 2020) still bound by directives of the European Union. Specifics of the division of labour between the EU and the UK are detailed here. Domestic (UK) laws originated within the ambit of contract and tort but, with the influence of EU law, it is emerging as an independent area of law. In many circumstances, where domestic law is in question, the matter is judicially treated as tort, contract, restitution or even criminal law. Consumer Protection issues were dealt with by the Office of Fair Trading before 2014. Since then, the Competition and Markets Authority has taken on this role. =United States= automotive repair shops in California In the United States a variety of laws at both the federal and state levels regulate consumer affairs. Among them are the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Truth in Lending Act, Fair Credit Billing Act, and the Gramm‚ÄìLeach‚ÄìBliley Act. Federal consumer protection laws are mainly enforced by the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Food and Drug Administration, and the U.S. Department of Justice. At the state level, many states have adopted the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act including, but not limited to, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, and Nebraska. The deceptive trade practices prohibited by the Uniform Act can be roughly subdivided into conduct involving either a) unfair or fraudulent business practice and b) untrue or misleading advertising. The Uniform Act contains a private remedy with attorneys fees for prevailing parties where the losing party \\"willfully engaged in the trade practice knowing it to be deceptive\\". Uniform Act ¬ß3(b). Missouri has a similar statute called the Merchandising Practices Act. This statute allows local prosecutors or the Attorney General to press charges against people who knowingly use deceptive business practices in a consumer transaction and authorizes consumers to hire a private attorney to bring an action seeking their actual damages, punitive damages, and attorney's fees. Also, the majority of states have a Department of Consumer Affairs devoted to regulating certain industries and protecting consumers who use goods and services from those industries. For example, in California, the California Department of Consumer Affairs regulates about 2.3 million professionals in over 230 different professions, through its forty regulatory entities. In addition, California encourages its consumers to act as private attorneys general through the liberal provisions of its Consumers Legal Remedies Act. California has the strongest consumer protection laws of any US state, partly because of rigorous advocacy and lobbying by groups such as Utility Consumers' Action Network, Consumer Federation of California, and Privacy Rights Clearinghouse. For example, California provides for \\"cooling off\\" periods giving consumers the right to cancel contracts within a certain time period for several specified types of transactions, such as home secured transactions, and warranty and repair services contracts. Other states have been the leaders in specific aspects of consumer protection. For example, Florida, Delaware, and Minnesota have legislated requirements that contracts be written at reasonable readability levels as a large proportion of contracts cannot be understood by most consumers who sign them.Lewis D. Eigen, \\"A Solution to the Problem of Consumer Contracts That Cannot be Understood by Consumers Who Sign Them\\", Scriptamus, 2009. Considering the state of Massachusetts, the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Law, MGL 93A, clearly highlights the rights and violations of consumer protection law in the state. The chapter explains what actions are considered illegal under the law for which a party can seek money damages from the other party at fault. Some examples of practices that constitute a Chapter 93A violation would be when: # A Business charges a consumer higher rates than the marked price # The refund policy is not clearly posted where it can be readily noticed and understood # A business fails to tell you relevant information regarding your product or service misleads you in any way. The laws under MGL 93A prohibits activities that relate to overpricing to a consumer and use of \\"Bait and Switch\\" techniques. A court will award the plaintiff the damages if they can prove the (1) defendant knowingly and intentionally violated the MGL 93A agreement or (2) the defendant would not \\"grant relief in bad faith\\" knowing that the actions violated the MGL 93A agreement. Additionally, failure to disclose refund/ return policy, warranties and critical information about the product/service are all in violation of the legislation, and can result in triple damages and lawyer fees. Constitutional laws 47 national constitutions currently include and enforce some sort of consumer right.Elkins, Zachary, Tom Ginsburg, and James Melton. 2014. \\"Characteristics of National Constitutions, Version 2.0.\\" Comparative Constitutions Project.

The screenplay was written by Jo Swerling, based on a story by Samuel Fuller and Henry Wales. Plot In September 1940, American war correspondent \\"Mitch\\" Mitchell is stationed in London, working for Consolidated Press of America, which represents 1000 newspapers. Mitch is anxiously waiting for news of the expected German invasion of Britain from a reporter on the Continent (the United States being neutral at the time), determined to scoop his competition. He manages to rent Sir Titus Scott's wire from Penzance in Cornwall for a week to save forty minutes (for an exorbitant amount, much to the dismay of his boss, H. Cyrus Stuyvesant). The information is to come by coded radio and homing pigeon messages. Twelve-year-old Albert Perkins and the elderly Mr. Bindle watch for the pigeons. During one of the many nighttime air raids against London, Mitch meets Jennifer Carson, a teletype operator at the Ministry of Information. They seek shelter in the Tube and become acquainted. The Consolidated offices (and all the teletype machines) are destroyed in the raid, but Mitch obtains the services of Jennifer and a teletype machine from Duffield, a Ministry of Information official. He then talks Mr Hobbs, the Regency Hotel's managing director, into letting Consolidated Press use the hotel's wine cellar for its new headquarters. A bomb plunges into the cellar, but fails to explode, so everyone assumes it is a dud. Later, however, Jeff, a blind Consolidated employee, realizes it is live and notifies Mitch, just as Mitch finally receives the pigeon message he has been waiting for. Mitch evacuates the place, but Jennifer suspects he is merely trying to bypass the censor, Captain Lionel Channing, so she refuses to leave. Another bomb closes the entrance, trapping them in the cellar. Mitch has Jennifer use the teletype to begin sending his big scoop: Hitler has gone to Calais, indicating the invasion is imminent. When Jennifer realizes he is sending uncensored information, she tries to persuade him to stop. They engage in a struggle before he locks her up. Then, Albert telephones with more pigeon-delivered vital information, but in the middle of the call, he is killed by the aerial attack. Mitch is devastated. Instead of transmitting his news, Mitch describes Albert's death. Jennifer is touched, and when the rescue team frees them, Mitch and Jennifer leave the wine cellar together.

Early life  Astudillo was born in the Philippines, but grew up in Los Angeles California, though he lived throughout the Eastern United States, including Upstate New York, Indiana, Missouri. He studied English literature in college and was an avid surfer and diver, interests he picked up while attending the combat diver course at the United States Naval Air Station, Trumbo Point Annex, Key West, Florida, while in the military. Astudillo left school twice to join the army before graduating, where he served in a reconnaissance platoon of a U.S. Army Ranger Regimental Detachment (RRD) based out of Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He declined re-enlistment after his last combat-related injuries, earning the rank of staff sergeant, but ironically found himself back in various war zones when he served as a war photographer for the following two years. While in college, Astudillo was influenced by a black-and-white photography class taught by the University's then Art Department Chair, Richard Ross, the principal photographer for the Getty Conservation Institute. After further encouragement by Ross and the subsequent color photography course, Astudillo was determined to become a photographer, even if self-taught. After graduating from college, Astudillo held a series of jobs, including work as a bounty hunter, a consultant, and a combat photographer. After considering employment in Blackwater USA, Astudillo decided to finish his studies. Photography Astudillo began working as a war photographer for nearly two years, where he was wounded on more than one occasion. He has documented a variety of armed conflicts, spending time in Latin America, Europe and the Middle East. Astudillo's experiences in the military profoundly influenced his early photography, drawn to social issues which included stories on gang violence, the homeless, and Hollywood vice. He moved into mainstream photography only after a series of close calls while on assignment in the Middle East conflict, switching to magazine editorial and still photography, although the eclecticism remained, from his photo series on the Los Angeles Coroner's Office morgue in downtown Los Angeles, to the photo story of a multi-national skinhead wedding in San Francisco, California. He began shooting reportage photography for a number of entertainment magazines and studios using his photojournalism experience. His celebrity photography includes portraiture, often using a single source of light, an influence of one of his favorite photographers, celebrity and fashion photographer, Robert Maxwell. One of the highlights of his career was the opportunity to photograph Maxwell in the photobooth. Astudillo's other photographic influences include instruction by photographer Richard Ross at the University of California, Santa Barbara, Charles Biasini, Elliott Erwitt, Guy Bourdin, Sean Ellis, Richard Avedon, Duane Michals, Patrick Demarchelier, Annie Leibovitz, James Nachtwey, Eddie Adams and the encouragement of his ranger detachment SRS, Sapu Maiava, and that of his brother, Godofredo Astudillo, a filmmaker and photo editor.

As an academic field Social Information Processing studies the information processing power of networked social systems. Typically computer tools are used such as: * Authoring tools: e.g., blogs * Collaboration tools: e.g., wikis, in particular, e.g., Wikipedia * Translating tools: Duolingo, reCAPTCHA * Tagging systems (social bookmarking): e.g., del.icio.us, Flickr, CiteULike * Social networking: e.g., Facebook, MySpace, Essembly * Collaborative filtering: e.g., Digg, the Amazon Product Recommendation System, Yahoo! Answers, Urtak Although computers are often used to facilitate networking and collaboration, they are not required. For example the Trictionary in 1982 was entirely paper and pen based, relying on neighborhood social networks and libraries. The creation of the Oxford English Dictionary in the 19th century was done largely with the help of anonymous volunteers organized by help wanted ads in newspapers and slips of paper sent through the postal mail. Current state of knowledge The website for the AAAI 2008 Spring Symposium on Social Information Processing suggested the following topics and questions: ; Tagging : Tagging has already attracted the interest of the AI community. While the initial purpose of tagging was to help users organize and manage their own documents, it has since been proposed that collective tagging of common documents can be used to organize information via an informal classification system dubbed a folksonomy. There is hope that folksonomies will eventually help fulfill the promise of the Semantic Web. ; Human-based computation and collective intelligence : What type of problems are amenable to human swarm computing approaches? How can we design the \\"wisdom of crowds\\" effect to benefit our problem solving needs? ; Incentives to participation : How to elicit quality metadata and content from users? How can users resistant to tagging be encouraged to tag content? ; Social networks: While users create social networks for a variety of reasons ‚Äì e.g., to track lives of friends or work or opinions of the users they respect ‚Äì network information is important for many applications. Globally, an information ecosystem may arise through the interactions among users, and between users and content. A community of users interested in a specific topic may emerge over time, with linkages to other communities giving insight into relationships between topics. ; Evolution of social media and information ecosystems : How does content, and its quality, change in time? There is increasing interest in peer-production systems, for example in how and why some open-source projects like Linux and Wikipedia are successful. Under what circumstances are user-generated content sites likely to succeed and what implications does this have for information-sharing and learning within communities? ; Algorithms : Before we can harness the power of the social information processing, we need new approaches to structured data analysis, specifically algorithms for synthesizing various types of metadata: e.g., social networks and tagging. Research in this area will provide a principled foundation for the development of new algorithms for social search, information discovery and personalization and other approaches that exploit the power of the social information processing. Key concepts=Social Recommender Systems= Social overload corresponds to being imposed to high amount of information and interaction on social web. Social overload causes some challenges from the aspect of both social media websites and their users. Users need to deal with high volume of information and to make decisions among different social network applications whereas social network sites try to keep their existing users and make their sites interesting to users. To overcome social overload, social recommender systems has been utilized to engage users in social media websites in a way that users receive more personalized content using recommendation techniques. Social recommender systems are specific types of recommendation systems being designed for social media and utilizing new sort of data brought by it, such as likes, comments, tags and so on, to improve effectiveness of recommendations. Recommendation in social media have several aspects like recommendation of social media content, people, groups and tags.  Content  Social media lets users to provide feedback on the content produced by users of social media websites, by means of commenting on or liking the content shared by others and annotating their own-created content via tagging. This newly introduced metadata by social media helps to obtain recommendations for social media content with improved effectiveness. Also, social media lets to extract the explicit relationship between users such as friendship and people followed/followers. This provides further improvement on collaborative filtering systems because now users can have judgement on the recommendations provided based on the people they have relationships. There have been studies showing the effectiveness of recommendation systems which utilize relationships among users on social media compared to traditional collaborative filtering based systems, specifically for movie and book recommendation. Another improvement brought by social media to recommender systems is solving the cold start problem for new users. Some key application areas of social media content recommendation are blog and blog post recommendation, multimedia content recommendation such as YouTube videos, question and answer recommendation to question askers and answerers on social question-and-answer websites, job recommendation (LinkedIn), news recommendation on social new aggregator sites (like Digg, GoogleReader, Reddit etc.), short message recommendations on microblogs (such as Twitter).  People  Also known as social matching (the term is proposed by Terveen and McDonald), people recommender systems deal with recommending people to people on social media. Aspects making people recommender systems distinct from traditional recommender systems and require special attention are basically privacy, trust among users, and reputation. There are several factors which effect the choice of recommendation techniques for people recommendation on social networking sites (SNS). Those factors are related to types of relationships among people on social networking sites, such as symmetric vs asymmetric, ad-hoc vs long-term, and confirmed vs nonconfirmed relationships. The scope of people recommender systems can be categorized into three: recommending familiar people to connect with, recommending people to follow and recommending strangers. Recommending strangers is seen as valuable as recommending familiar people because of leading to chances such as exchanging ideas, obtaining new opportunities, and increasing one‚Äôs reputation. Challenges  Handling with social streams is one of the challenges social recommender systems face with. Social stream can be described as the user activity data pooled on newsfeed on social media websites. Social stream data has unique characteristics such as rapid flow, variety of data (only text content vs heterogenous content), and requiring freshness. Those unique properties of stream data compared to traditional social media data impose challenges on social recommender systems. Another challenge in social recommendation is performing cross-domain recommendation, as in traditional recommender systems. The reason is that social media websites in different domains include different information about users, and merging information within different contexts may not lead to useful recommendations. For example, using favorite recipes of users in one social media site may not be a reliable source of information to effective job recommendations for them. =Social awareness= Participation of people in online communities, in general, differ from their participatory behavior in real-world collective contexts. Humans in daily life are used to making use of \\"social cues\\" for guiding their decisions and actions e.g. if a group of people is looking for a good restaurant to have lunch, it is very likely that they will choose to enter to a local that have some customers inside instead of one that it is empty (the more crowded restaurant could reflect its popularity and in consequence, its quality of service). However, in online social environments, it is not straightforward how to access to these sources of information which are normally being logged in the systems, but this is not disclosed to the users. There are some theories that explain how this social awareness can affect the behavior of people in real-life scenarios. The American philosopher George Herbert Mead states that humans are social creatures, in the sense that people's actions cannot be isolated from the behavior of the whole collective they are part of because every individuals' act are influenced by larger social practices that act as a general behavior's framework. In his performance framework, the Canadian sociologist Erving Goffman postulates that in everyday social interactions individuals perform their actions by collecting information from others first, in order to know in advance what they may expect from them and in this way being able to plan how to behave more effectively. Benefits In the same way that in the real-world, providing social cues in virtual communities can help people to understand better the situations they face in these environments, to alleviate their decision-making processes by enabling their access to more informed choices, to persuade them to participate in the activities that take place there, and to structure their own schedule of individual and group activities more efficiently. In this frame of reference, an approach called \\"social context displays\\" has been proposed for showing social information -either from real or virtual environments- in digital scenarios. It is based on the use of graphical representations to visualize the presence and activity traces of a group of people, thus providing users with a third-party view of what is happening within the community i.e. who are actively participating, who are not contributing to the group efforts, etc. This social-context-revealing approach has been studied in different scenarios (e.g. IBM video-conference software, large community displaying social activity traces in a shared space called NOMATIC*VIZ), and it has been demonstrated that its application can provide users with several benefits, like providing them with more information to make better decisions and motivating them to take an active attitude towards the management of their self and group representations within the display through their actions in the real-life. Concerns By making the traces of activity of users publicly available for others to access it is natural that it can raise users concerns related to which are their rights over the data they generate, who are the final users that can have access to their information and how they can know and control their privacy policies. There are several perspectives that try to contextualize this privacy issue. One perspective is to see privacy as a tradeoff between the degree of invasion to the personal space and the number of benefits that the user could perceive from the social system by disclosing their online activity traces. Another perspective is examining the concession between the visibility of people within the social system and their level of privacy, which can be managed at an individual or at a group level by establishing specific permissions for allowing others to have access to their information. Other authors state that instead of enforcing users to set and control privacy settings, social systems might focus on raising their awareness about who their audiences are so they can manage their online behavior according to the reactions they expect from those different user groups.

It was moved to the Shelburne Museum in Shelburne, Vermont, in 1956. In 1869 the United States Lighthouse Service commissioned the building of the Colchester Reef Lighthouse on Lake Champlain to protect ships from the \\"Middle Bunch Reef\\", comprising the Colchester Reef, the Colchester Shoals, and the Hogback Reef.Shelburne Museum. 1993. Shelburne Museum: A Guide to the Collections. Shelburne: Shelburne Museum, Inc. Architecture This lighthouse was one of a group of New England lighthouses built to the same plan. Nearly identical lighthouses were constructed at Esopus Meadows Light in New York and Sabin Point, Pomham Rocks, and Rose Island, all three located in Rhode Island waters. In the mid- nineteenth century, due in large part to the booming lumber business, which relied on easy shipping of raw timber from Canada to planing mills in western Vermont, commerce on Lake Champlain significantly increased. To protect ships in potentially hazardous waterways, the Lighthouse Service held a national competition for lighthouse designs, and Albert R. Dow, a Burlington native from the University of Vermont, won the commission. The Lighthouse Service implemented Dow's designs in building the Colchester Reef Lighthouse, which marked the reef consisting of several groups of exposed rocks northwest of Colchester Point. It was completed in 1871. Because the lighthouse needed to endure the lake's strong winds and heavy winter ice-floes, Dow pegged and bolted together the lighthouse's twenty-five-foot square stone foundation, post-and-beam frame and tower, and slate and tin roof. Dow then secured the entire building with one and a half inch thick iron rods to assure its stability. Despite Dow's focus on the building's framework, he ornamented his lighthouse with a mansard roof and scrolled window frames typical of the then- fashionable French Second Empire style.http://www.shelburnemuseum.org/buildings_and_grounds/detail.php?id=14 A sixth order Fresnel lens exhibited a fixed red light beginning in 1871. Use The lighthouse served as both the home and workplace of eleven successive keepers and their families. The first floor was divided into a living room and kitchen and the second floor into four bedrooms. Coal stoves provided heat, while large pumps retrieved water from the lake. The keepers used the nearby island to the north, Hogback Island, as farmland. The island was auctioned off in 1956 after the lighthouse was decommissioned and was renamed Sunset Island. The exposed location and northerly climate meant that ice figured heavily in incidents involving the lighthouse. In one instance, the keeper's wife went into labor in January 1888. Summoned by the fog bell, the doctor and his assistant attempted to cross the ice, but were blown north when it broke up, eventually landing safely at South Hero Island (also known as Grand Isle), to the north. The baby was safely born with the father assisting alone. The move In 1933 the Lighthouse Service decommissioned the Colchester Reef Lighthouse after the automatic electric beacon made the hand-operated system obsolete. Over the years the light suffered damage from ice floes and gradually fell into disrepair. Nineteen years later, in 1952, it was put up for auction and sold to Mr. & Mrs. Paul and Lorraine Bessette of Winooski, Vermont, for $50, to be dismantled for timber to construct a home. After this sale, Vermont historian Ralph Nading Hill ferried Electra Havemeyer Webb to the now-derelict lighthouse. Entranced, she persuaded the Bessettes to sell it for $1,300 and substitute building materials. Webb purchased the lighthouse and had it moved to the museum grounds in the fall. Undaunted by the hazards involved, her veteran crew catalogued each piece of the building before moving the heavy beams, stairways, doors, and windows to reconstruct the building on museum grounds. The Coast Guard donated the lens, fog bell, and striking mechanism, and in 2006 assisted with the mounting of a modern solar-powered beacon in the lantern, allowing the beacon to be lit for the first time since its decommissioning. With the house removed, a modern steel tower was mounted on the pier. Collection=Furniture= Shelburne Museum's furniture collection represents the different styles and tastes of 18th and 19th century America. It includes examples of the most sophisticated urban furniture produced in the nation as well as many simpler pieces made by country cabinetmakers for use in rural homes. These country pieces include one of the greatest strengths of the museum ‚Äì its collection of paint-decorated furniture. During the American industrial revolution (ca. 1865-1900) the furniture industry, like every other major industry, was mechanized. Individual craftspeople and designers like Louis Comfort Tiffany, whose work can be seen in the Electra Havemeyer Webb Memorial Building, continued to work for upper class patrons, but inexpensive, factory-made chairs, tables, beds, and stands flooded and eager market of middle-class Victorians. The popularity of carved decoration and elaborate upholster, characteristic of the period, can be seen on the furniture displayed in the parlor of the Colchester Reef Light.

History=Pre Alliance Atlantis (1984-1998)= The company was formed in 1984 by Stephen Roth, Denis H√©roux, John Kemeny, Robert Lantos, Andras Hamori and Susan Cavan as Alliance Entertainment. It acquired a Montreal-based Francophone distribution company, Vivafilm, in 1990. In 1998, it merged with Atlantis Communications, forming Alliance Atlantis Communications. =Post Alliance Atlantis (2007-2013)= In partnership with Cineplex Entertainment, Alliance Films (operating as Motion Picture Distribution LP under Alliance Atlantis) also operated Alliance Cinemas, owner of two Toronto-area theatres. During the MPD era, all materials relating to Alliance Atlantis‚Äìdistributed films contained a disclaimer stating that Alliance Atlantis was \\"an indirect limited partner of Motion Picture Distribution LP, not a general partner\\". However, in fact, the company controlled the general partner of the partnership, and hence effectively controlled the distribution unit itself. Formally known as Motion Picture Distribution LP, it was rebranded and relaunched in 2007 due to the collapse of its preceding company, Alliance Atlantis, which was sold off piece by piece to CanWest Global, GS Capital Partners, along with several other smaller companies. Soci√©t√© g√©n√©rale de financement du Qu√©bec, an investment agency of the provincial government, owns 51% of the voting shares of the company and 38.5% of the equity. GS Capital owns the remainder of the company. Alliance Films was headquartered in Montreal, Quebec, in the Quartier International. In the mid-2000s, Alliance Films began to produce films in moderation. In addition to producing films as The Rocket (Maurice Richard) with Cin√©maginaire (as well as other movies), National Lampoon's Senior Trip with New Line Cinema and Munich with Universal Pictures, DreamWorks SKG and Amblin Entertainment of and before the days of Alliance Atlantis respectively, they were responsible for co-producing the 2008 teen slasher Prom Night with Screen Gems and Original Film. They also produced and distributed the war drama Passchendaele, and co-produced the comedy Stone of Destiny with Infinity Features Entertainment and The Mob Film Company. They are also responsible for co-producing the 2011 horror film Insidious with FilmDistrict and Wanderlust with Universal Pictures and Apatow Productions. In 2010, Alliance Films expanded its home video operations with an aggressive push into the TV-on-DVD market. It began releasing various television series on DVD, the majority are Canadian productions or Canadian co-productions. To date they have released over 20 series and continue to release more. On June 24, 2011, Alliance Films bought Maple Pictures from Lionsgate for a sum of 38.5 million dollars before Alliance was folded into Entertainment One in early 2013. Since early 2010 Alliance Films has been partnering with Jason Blum and his BlumHouse Productions to produce low budget horror films. This began with Insidious which was released in 2011. The next to be released was Sinister in 2012 and Dark Skies in 2013. Since the 2013 acquisition and absorption, it is unclear if eOne will be a partner on subsequent BlumHouse films and their sequels. On January 3, 2012, it was announced that Goldman Sachs Group is looking to sell its majority stake in Alliance Films.Goldman looks to sell majority stake in Alliance Films = Acquisition by eOne = On May 28, 2012, Entertainment One confirmed their bid to purchase Alliance Films from Goldman Sachs Group, similar to the purchase of Maple Pictures a year prior.EOne confirms talks to buy Alliance FilmsTartaglione, Nancy.

Built by Roy Harnish in 1946, it has become locally renowned for serving a lobster supper. Now in the third generation of owners, Shore Club bids itself as the \\"Original Nova Scotian Lobster Supper\\" and also the \\"Last of the Great Dance Halls\\" built after the Second World War. Notable musical acts that have performed at the Shore Club include Joel Plaskett, Matt Mays, Wintersleep and Classified. History Roy Harnish started building the Shore Club in May 1946, with the first supper and dance taking place only three months later on August 25. Roy and wife, Lois, were active operators of the club until 1985. Today, Rhys Harnish, a third generation Harnish (with son Luke close behind), continues the legacy started by his father, Roy, in 1946, that of running the restaurant. To date well over one million lobsters have been served. While the Shore Club dates back more than 60 years, its history runs even deeper. Its first lobster supper was cooked in a cooper cook pot from the USS Chesapeake. On June 1, 1813, HMS Shannon had entered Boston Harbor and in a battle lasting less than 15 minutes had captured the Chesapeake. The Chesapeake was towed into Halifax Harbour where its chattels were auctioned. Its large copper cook pot eventually ended in the possession of Guy Harnish (Roy's father). On August 5, 1936 Guy, who had been approached by The Gyro International Club to host their national convention, catered the first \\"Lobster Supper\\" on Hubbards Beach. The old Chesapeake pot was shined up and cooked its first meal in over 120 years. The lobster supper was a great success, and soon more groups came to eat lobster on Hubbards Beach. Today the old cook pot can be seen at Maritime Museum of the Atlantic.

The screenplay was written by David Hertz, based on the novel Summer Lightning by Allene Corliss. The film stars Joan Bennett and Henry Fonda. Synopsis The film begins with Julie and Ives, who are two teen sweethearts, on a walk together. They declare they love each other and want to get married as soon as Ives has earned enough money for them to live on. The following Christmas, Julie is out in town with her friend, buying provisions for a Christmas party. Although there is a blizzard, the girls wager on who can reach home first; Julie takes the mountain road. She gets lost in the storm and her family and Ives begin to panic. She finds a small cottage, rented by pulp fiction writer Michael Shaw. He seduces her and the next morning they marry and elope to Paris. Ten unhappy years pass for Julie and Ives. When Michael is shot in a brawl, Julie returns to her hometown with her daughter, Michael. Ives has become a college professor and the two meet curtly. One of Ives' students, Brenda Lane, has developed a massive crush on her teacher, and professes her love for him. Brenda uses almost the exact words Ives used to Julie ten years previously when she describes her love for him, and suddenly he realizes he still loves Julie. He rejects Brenda and invites Julie to the school prom with him. During the evening, they find their love has re-blossomed, but it is ruined when Brenda makes a scene. Someone takes Brenda home and Julie and Ives decide to leave, but they also decide to get married as soon as possible. When they arrive home, a man arrives with Brenda claiming she tried to hang herself after the party. Ives declares he can't marry Julie if Brenda is prepared to die for love of him. Julie, distraught, rushes out to the car where Brenda is waiting and begins to drive it at high speeds, claiming she is going to kill them both as neither of them can have Ives. Brenda begs her not to do it, claiming she didn't really try to kill herself, and only pretended to do so to get Ives back for rejecting her. Julie and Ives get married at long last. CastProduction The film was known as Carelessly. Reception The film didn't make a profit, but lost $64,104.

Platinum as an investment has a much shorter history in the financial sector than gold or silver, which were known to ancient civilizations. Experts posit that platinum is about 15‚Äì20 times scarcer than gold, on the basis of annual mine production. Since 2014, platinum rates have fallen significantly lower than gold rates. More than 75% of global platinum is mined in South Africa. Overview Platinum is relatively scarce even among the precious metals. New mine production totals approximately only five million troy ounces (150 Mg) a year. In contrast, gold mine production runs approximately 82 million ounces (2,550 Mg) a year, and silver production is approximately 547 million ounces (17,000 Mg). As such, it tends to trade at higher per-unit prices. Platinum is traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and the London Platinum and Palladium Market. To be saleable on most commodity markets, platinum ingots must be assayed and hallmarked in a manner similar to the way gold and silver are.London/Zurich Good Delivery List The price of platinum changes along with its supply and demand; during periods of sustained economic stability and growth, the price of platinum tends to be as much as twice the price of gold; whereas, during periods of economic uncertainty, the price of platinum tends to decrease because of reduced demand, falling below the price of gold, partly due to increased gold prices. Platinum price peaked at US$2,252 per troy ounce in March 2008 driven on production concerns (brought about partly due to power delivery problems to South African mines). It subsequently fell to US$774 per troy ounce ($25/g) in November 2008. As of 15 October 2018, the platinum spot price in New York was $845.10 per ounce, compared to $1,222 per ounce for gold and $15.16 per ounce for silver. Platinum is traded in the spot market with the code \\"XPT\\". When settled in United States Dollars, the code is \\"XPTUSD\\". As of 3/4/2018, the price of platinum has fallen below the price of gold, platinum being valued at US$963 an ounce vis-√†-vis gold at US$1322 an ounce, respectively.http://www.kitco.com/charts/livegold.html http://www.kitco.com/charts/liveplatinum.html As the cost of platinum per ounce fell, the cost per ounce for other metals in the platinum group - especially Palladium - rose strongly. As of September 2019, Palladium sits at around US$1600 per ounce, compared to US$950 for platinum. Investment vehicles=Exchange-traded products= Platinum price 1880‚Äì2011 Platinum price 1968‚Äì2012 Platinum is traded as an ETF (exchange-traded fund) on the London Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol and on the New York Stock Exchange as ticker symbols and There are also several ETNs (exchange-traded note) available, some of which are inverse to the price of platinum. A list can be found at ETFDB, stock encyclopedia. =Platinum coins and bars= Platinum bars are available from different foundries in different sizes, like 1 oz, 10 oz, 1 kg. Platinum coins are another way to invest in platinum, although relatively few varieties of platinum coins have been minted, due to its cost and difficulty in working. Since 1997, the United States Mint has been selling American Platinum Eagle coins to investors. =Accounts= Most Swiss banks offer platinum accounts where platinum can be instantly bought or sold just like any foreign currency. Unlike physical platinum, the customer does not own the actual metal but rather has a claim against the bank for a certain quantity of metal. = Futures = Another investment option is to create a futures contract where a predetermined time and place is designated to buy or sell the platinum. Unlike options, the transaction is an obligation, and not a right. The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and the Tokyo Commodity Exchange (TOCOM) trades in platinum futures with a minimum contract size of 50 troy ounces and 500 grams respectively. =Others= Other ways of investing in platinum include spread betting or contracts for difference on the price of the metal, owning shares in mining companies with substantial platinum assets or exposure, owning traded options in platinum (only available in the US market).

After a period in government service he founded the Rwanda Rushya (\\"New Rwanda\\") newspaper, which was critical of the Habyarimana government. He campaigned for democracy and was a prominent member of the Parti Liberal. He was killed in June 1994. Biography Andr√© Kameya was born on 15 May 1946 in Southern Province, Rwanda, the child of Augustin Rubwiriza and Nyirabahakwa Pascasie. Upon finishing primary education at Mugombwa Primary School, he attended the Karubanda Catholic seminary and then continued to Nyakibanda Major Seminary for priesthood training. While in his last year, working in Kabgayi in 1971‚Äì72, he was subjected to discrimination that awoke his sense of justice. He started to write articles for the Catholic newspaper Kinyamateka. Discrimination against Tutsi was not uncommon. This brought him to the attention of the internal security services and he was ejected from the seminary under the orders of Kayibanda. This purge instituted by the government saw many Tutsi students ejected from many Catholic seminaries and some killed. Like many Tutsis, he took the road to exile in 1972 and returned to Rwanda in 1974. He subsequently worked for the Catholic church Kinyamateka until 1981 when he moved to then Rwandan Office of Information (ORINFOR) in La Releve French newspaper. Following training in law in 1984 he moved to the ministry of justice (MINIJUST) where he was the editor of the ministry journal. After a few years in the ministry of justice, he moved to the ministry of scientific research and culture (MINESUPRES) until his resignation from public service in 1991 to start his own weekly newspaper, Rwanda Rushya (\\"New Rwanda\\"), which was critical of the government of Juv√©nal Habyarimana. He was among the 33 intellectuals who signed a petition to the then president JUvenal Habyarimana for the introduction of democracy and a multiparty system. At the time when the government was fighting the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), he is credited to have traveled to Byumba in the RPF zone via Kampala and met the RPF leaders Alexis Kanyarengwe and Paul Kagame for interviews. Upon his return he published the first ever article inside Rwanda - called \\"U Rwanda mu Rundi\\" (Rwanda inside Rwanda) - to comment on the objectives of the RPF and the legitimacy of their war. He was subsequently jailed for this. The government was then depicting RPF as a bunch of Ugandan foreigners who were mounting a campaign of aggression towards Rwanda. Rwanda Rushya at times was published bi-monthly and managed to reach 3000 copies per month. Kameya was also a founding member and Secretary-General of the Parti Liberal and was in charge of the Information Commission and editor of the party's journal that came out a few times. Kameya was killed in June 1994.Journalists Killed  Rwanda  Andr√© Kameya CPJ (Committee to Protect Journalists) His wife, Suzanne Nyiramuruta, was also killed along with their daughter in April 1994. Among many controversies surrounding his death, Olivier, Kameya's eldest son, has consistently accused the then Parish Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka of responsibility for delivering him to the killers under the orders of Tharcisse Renzaho which were carried out by Odette Nyirabagenzi.\\"Wenceslas Munyeshyaka\\" , Trial-Watch (Switzerland)\\"Rwanda Ste Famille\\", Orwell Today: Jackie Jura\\"Tharcisse Renzaho\\" , Trial-Watch (Switzerland) He is buried together with other assassinated politicians at Rebero, Kicukiro District.

Murray in A History of Board-Games Other Than Chess (1952). The game is related to Draughts and even more so to Alquerque. Pieces are captured by leaping over them. Dash-guti consists of a Lau kata kati board, but with the addition of two line segments connected to the vertex (one on each side) but exterior to both triangles. Dash-guti belongs to a specific category of games called Indian War-games, and the other games in this category are Lau kata kati, Egara-guti, Pretwa, Gol- skuish. All Indian War-games have one important thing in common, and that is that all the pieces are laid out on the grid patterned board, with only one vacant point in the centre. This forces the first move to be played on the central point, and captured by the other player's piece. Setup The board consist of two triangles connected together at a common vertex. Players play on opposite sides of the board with the base of each triangle forming the first rank of each player. Two lines cross the breadth of each triangle forming the second and third ranks respectively of each player. The common vertex and two line segments one on each side of the common vertex but exterior to both triangles form the fourth rank of each player. The common vertex is also the central point of the board. A single line perpendicular to the base of each triangle runs through the common vertex. There are a total of 19 intersection points and 2 endpoints (both hereforth referred to as \\"points\\") for a total of 21 points. Pieces are situated on the points, and move along the lines. Each player has 10 pieces. One plays the black pieces, and the other plays the white pieces, however any two colors or distinguishable objects will do. Players choose which color to play, and who starts first. Players place their 10 pieces on their first four ranks. On the fourth rank, the central point is left vacant and a black piece and white piece occupy either side of it. Dash-guti game: *Players alternate their turns using one piece to either move or capture exclusively per turn. *A piece moves one space per turn onto a vacant adjacent point along a line. *Captures are compulsory and are done by the short leap as in draughts and Alquerque, where the adjacent enemy piece is leaped over onto a vacant point adjacently behind. The captures must be done in a straight line following the pattern on the board. A piece must continue to capture if it is able to. Captured pieces are removed immediately from the board. *If a player captures all of their opponent's pieces, he or she is the winner. *If a player cannot perform a move or a capture because its pieces have been blocked or immobilized by the other player's pieces, this is known as a stalemate, and the player loses; the other player wins. *If neither player can capture anymore pieces, the player with more pieces wins. If both players have the same number of pieces, then the game is a draw.

Written in 1738, it was his first major published work. The poem in 263 lines imitates Juvenal's Third Satire, expressed by the character of Thales as he decides to leave London for Wales. Johnson imitated Juvenal because of his fondness for the Roman poet and he was following a popular 18th-century trend of Augustan poets headed by Alexander Pope that favoured imitations of classical poets, especially for young poets in their first ventures into published verse. London was published anonymously and in multiple editions during 1738. It quickly received critical praise, notably from Pope. This would be the second time that Pope praised one of Johnson's poems; the first being for Messiah, Johnson's Latin translation of Pope's poem. Part of that praise comes from the political basis of the poem. From a modern view, the poem is outshined by Johnson's later poem The Vanity of Human Wishes, as well as works like his A Dictionary of the English Language, his Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets, and his periodical essays for The Rambler, The Idler and The Adventurer. Background During March 1737, Johnson lived in London with his former pupil the actor David Garrick. Garrick had connections in London, and the two stayed with his distant relative, Richard Norris, who lived in Exeter Street. Johnson did not stay there long, and set out to Greenwich near the Golden Hart Tavern to finish his play, Irene. Later, in October 1737, Johnson brought his wife to London; they first lived at Woodstock Street and then moved to 6 Castle Street. Soon, Johnson found employment with Edward Cave, and wrote for his The Gentleman's Magazine. According to Walter Jackson Bate, his work for the magazine and other publishers \\"is almost unparalleled in range and variety\\", and \\"so numerous, so varied and scattered\\" that \\"Johnson himself could not make a complete list\\". During this time, Johnson was exposed to the \\"imitations\\" of Horace composed by Pope and saw how they were used to attack contemporary political corruption. Both the form and subject were popular, and Johnson decided to follow Pope's lead by creating his own imitation. In May 1738, London was published anonymously, and it went into a second edition that year. This was his first major work to be published to a wide audience and one of his longest \\"non-dramatic public poems\\". It was not written to be a general satire; instead, it was written to demonstrate Johnson's skill as a writer and to become popular to further his literary career. London First page of London (1738) London is part of the eighteenth-century genre of imitation, or Neoclassicism. The work was based on Juvenal's Third Satire which describes Umbricius leaving Rome to live in Cumae in order to escape from the vices and dangers of the capital city. In Johnson's version, it is Thales who travels to Cambria (Wales) to escape from the problems of London. Johnson chose Juvenal as a model based on his own appreciation for Juvenal's works. The epigraph from Juvenal, ‚ÄúQuis ineptae [iniquae] / Tam patiens urbis, tam ferreus ut teneat se?‚Äù (Juv. 1.30-1) can be translated as ‚ÄúWho is so patient of the foolish [wicked] city, so iron-willed, as to contain himself?‚Äù. The poem describes the various problems of London, including an emphasis on crime, corruption, and the squalor of the poor. To emphasise his message, these various abstract problems are personified as beings that seek to destroy London. Thus, the characters of Malice, Rapine, and Accident \\"conspire\\" (line 13) to attack those who live in London. The poem begins: Who Thales represents is unknown, but it is possible that he represents Richard Savage, Johnson's friend who left London to travel to Wales. The main emphasis of the poem comes to light on line 177: \\"Slow rises worth, by poverty depressed\\". The poem is forced to cut short, and the narrator concludes: =Politics= The British government under the Whig Sir Robert Walpole opposed to the content expressed in \\"London.\\" The poem does not hide its political agenda, and the lines directed against George II follow a Jacobite political sentiment. Although it does not mention George in line 50 (\\"Let ____ live here, for ____ has learned to live\\"), the poem is referring to the king. Not until the end of the poem does the narrator directly address the government when he says: It is through the \\"Ways and Means\\", or the Committee of Ways and Means of the House of Commons, that the king is able to tax the people, and this function is part of many that Johnson satirises. The city of London was seen as a means to attack the Whig political party run by Robert Walpole. In particular, Johnson compares the actions of George II and Walpole to those of the Roman emperors during the decline of the Roman Empire. Part of the attack included, as Brean Hammond puts it, \\"a nostalgic glorification of English history that went hand- in-hand with the representation of the present as in the grip of forms of corruption never previously encountered\\". This \\"nostalgic glorification\\" includes multiple references to Queen Elizabeth and her defeat of the Spanish invaders while simultaneously claiming that Walpole is seeking to allow Spain to conquer England's trade investments. With England's rivalry with Spain, Johnson included the lines \\"Has heaven reserved, in pity to the poor,/No pathless waste or undiscovered shore,/No secret island in the boundless main,/No peaceful desert yet unclaimed by Spain?\\" Modern Latin American historians have used the lines to illustrate Europeans' wonder at the sheer size of the Spanish Empire.Simon Collier, \\"The Spanish Conquests, 1492-1580\\" in The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Latin America and the Caribbean, 2d edition. New York: Cambridge University Press 1992, p. 192. Critical response Johnson judged his own poem harshly; he revised it in 1748Now the standard version. Many years later, Johnson made annotations on an edition of 1750; Johnson's copy has disappeared, but his biographer James Boswell transcribed them. (See Mason, \\"Samuel Johnson. \\"London: A Poem in Imitation of the Third Satire of Juvenal\\", London 1738, rev. ed. 1748). and came to depreciate the genre of poetic imitations of which London was an example. Another aspect of the poem that Johnson disliked in his later years was the pastoral bias of the poem, to prefer the countryside to the city. However, his contemporaries did not agree with his later assessment, and Alexander Pope from the first claimed that the author \\"will soon be d√©terr√©\\",\\"Flushed from earth\\", a hunting metaphor. although it did not immediately happen. This would be the second time that Pope directly praised a work of Johnson.Bate p. 92 Not everyone praised the work, as its political themes did cause controversy within the Hanoverian government and with the supporters of Walpole's administration. Johnson was not to receive recognition as a major literary figure until a few years later when he began to work on his A Dictionary of the English Language. The printer and bookseller Robert Dodsley bought the copyright from Johnson for ¬£10.Mason, \\"Samuel Johnson. \\"London: A Poem in Imitation of the Third Satire of Juvenal\\", London 1738, rev. ed. 1748 Later, London would be rated as his second greatest poem, as The Vanity of Human Wishes would replace it in the eyes of Walter Scott and T. S. Eliot. The later critic Howard Weinbrot agreed with Scott's and Eliot's assessment, and says \\"London is well worth reading, but The Vanity of Human Wishes is one of the great poems in the English language.\\" Likewise, Robert Folkenflik says: \\"It is not Johnson's greatest poem, only because The Vanity of Human Wishes is better\\". Some critics, like Brean Hammond, only see the poem as \\"no better than a somewhat mechanical updating of Juvenal's third Satire\\". Others, like Walter Jackson Bate, consider the poem as \\"masterly in its versification\\". NotesReferences * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * .

For cost reasons the new gun retained the bronze barrel of the original, although it was actually redesigned to withstand the more powerful propellants coming into use. A touch hole lock was added to prevent accidental misfiring when the breech was open. A spring- mounted spade brake reduced recoil from 5‚Äì6 metres to 80 centimetres, although it only worked if the spade was buried in the ground. A depression lever was added to elevate the carriage's trail to allow the gun greater depression in mountainous areas. Many guns had shields added after the outbreak of World War I.

University of AucklandRamsay, G. W. 1990. Mantodea (Insecta) with a review of aspects of functional morphology and biology. Fauna of New Zealand 19, 96 pages. . Published 13 June 1990. Purkayastha, M. 1999, Orthodera novaezealandiae, University of Michigan Animal Diversity Web. Accessed July 27, 2008 Tree of Life New Zealand Praying Mantis (exotic-pets.co.uk) Description Female viewed from above O. novaezealandiae nymphs are pale, translucent green with a dark stripe running from head to end of abdomen. As adults, they are bright green and grow to between 35 mm and 40 mm in length.(see note This information from the University of Michigan reports that O. novaezealandiae grows between 3.5 and 4.5 inches in length, a size that seems incompatible with the information given in other sources. 3.5 to 4.5 centimetres may be what the text should read.) As in most mantis species, sexual dimorphism means the female is larger. The New Zealand mantis has a triangular head with slightly oversized compound eyes that give it excellent binocular vision (although they do have a blind spot). Its wings differ from those of other species in the \\"development of the archedictyon and the absence of cross-veins in the forewing\\". \\"A very active little Mantis\\", O. novaezealandiae is well adapted as a predator. Its specialized forelimbs are long and equipped with extremely sharp spikes to trap prey. Blue eyespots on the underside of the insect's forelegs helps in differentiating this species from Miomantis caffra, an introduced species from South Africa that became established in New Zealand during the 1970s. Photo of O. novaezealandiae female creating ootheca and discussion of Miomantis caffra The ootheca of the New Zealand mantis has eggs arranged in two rows, quite different from the messier egg mass of Miomantis caffra. Oothecae are generally arranged facing north towards the sun, on the warm faces of branches and tree trunks. Ecology A nymph eating a fly O. novaezealandiae prefer open, shrubby terrain where its similarity to leafy vegetation may be used as camouflage to ambush prey. It can reach high numbers in the branches of small manuka and kanuka trees in open meadow-like habitats where grass-dwelling prey such as small moths are abundant. It hides well from predators and is near or at the top of the invertebrate food chain in its habitat. As an endemic species of New Zealand that eats pests and has a very large appetite, O. novaezealandiae is a beneficial insect to those involved in agriculture and they are used in many gardens. Rimutaka Forest Park, New Zealand The New Zealand mantis is vulnerable to the use of pesticides, both directly and through the effects of a diminished food supply, and their ootheca are sometimes attacked by parasitic wasps. Praying Mantids in the Brisbane area, Queensland, Australia Male O.novaezealandiae appear to be attracted to females of the introduced species M. caffra, which can result in their fatality due to the sexually- cannibalistic behavior of the latter species. The only two species of mantis in New Zealand are this native species and the previously-mentioned introduced species M. caffra discovered as established in the Auckland suburb of New Lynn in 1978. O. novaezealandiae is taxonomically very close to, and has sometimes been considered conspecific and synonymous with, the Australian species O. ministralis. New Zealand praying mantis illustration by Des Helmore Cultivation Laying eggs The New Zealand mantis is bred in captivity. Species Database: Mantodea Special care must be taken to prevent this small, quick-moving species from escaping. Nymphs are especially fast and can leap relatively far as well. It can be kept at room temperature () but does prefer warmth. Their enclosure should be sprayed with water a few times a week, and when they are young their enclosure should be kept at around 50%‚Äì60% humidity. Captive O. novaezealandiae can be fed on a diet of small crickets and flies. Nymphs can be reared easily on fruitflies such as Drosophila melanogaster. The 7 mm insects emerging.

He is currently Assistant ProfessorHarvard School of Dental Medicine: Winston Patrick Kuo, DDS, MS, DMSc in the Developmental Biology at Harvard School of Dental Medicine and Director of the Laboratory for Innovative Translational Technologies.LITT Biography Winston Kuo completed his education at Columbia University earning his dental degree, as well as a DMSc from Harvard Medical School and a MS from MIT.https://www.kenzpub.com/scholars/1009/ He went on and completed a two-year dental General Practice Residency program at Catholic Medical Center in Brooklyn, New York. In addition he completed specialty training in Pediatric Dentistry at the University of Southern California and Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center. He then enrolled into an Oral Medicine program at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey and before he completed his program he transferred to Harvard School of Dental Medicine and completed his Doctorate in Oral Biology and dental specialties in Oral Medicine and Dental Informatics. At the same time he completed his Medical Informatics degree from Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Research He was the first to compare DNA microarray platforms on a large scale. He further developed a framework for comparing DNA microarrays at a graduate student in Connie Cepko's lab in the Department of Genetics, Harvard Medical School, which addressed issues related to the reliability of DNA microarrays. He also worked with Lucila Ohno-Machado from the Decision Systems Group, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Peter Park from the Children's Hospital Informatics Program, Children's Hospital . He is currently in the process of finishing up the data analyses portion of this latter study and several manuscripts have recently been published . He also was a participant of the MAQC study led by Leming Shi. Kuo has another role as a post-doc in Arhat Abzhanov's lab at the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University. He is currently trying to understand craniofacial abnormalities related to bone and cartilage. Craniofacial abnormalities are some of the most common structural birth defects that are often associated with developmental disabilities, abnormalities to brain maturation, hearing loss, functional problems related to breathing, eating, and speech. Children with these malformations and disabilities generally require an interdisciplinary team composing of many specialties for most of their life. Impaired cranial bone formation and remodeling can contribute to many of these craniofacial abnormalities such as Apert's, Crouzon's, Treacher-Collins, Pierre Robin Complex, hemifacial microsomia, etc. Great strides have been made in identifying the genetic etiologies of a number of syndromes, though the pathogenesis of the developing cranial skeletal structures still remains poorly understood. His research focuses on roles of microRNAs in craniofacial development in general and in skull development in particular. A conditional knock-out mutation in Dicer, which is involved in microRNAs processing, with several cre-LoxP lines that target various craniofacial and skeletal tissues and structures will be used to describe the overall roles for miRNAs in craniofacial development. Preliminary results showed a profound yet specific intramebranous (dermal) bone phenotype. His goals are to better characterize the nature of miRNA involvement and search for specific microRNAs involved in cranial development. He plans to study the transcriptional activity of multiple skeletogenic markers and signaling molecules using microRNA and DNA microarrays, and of key classes of kinase-dependent pathways using kinase-protein chips. In addition, he was part of a team that identifies a gene linked to beak length in Darwin's Finches. Kuo analyzed the data that used the living ancestral vampire finch as a reference and compared the short-beaked ground finches to the long-billed morphology of the cactus finches.

Tom Stoppard wrote the screenplay based on John le Carr√©'s 1989 novel of the same name. The film was filmed in Technovision. It was filmed on location in the Soviet Union, only the second American motion picture (the first being the 1988 film Red Heat) to do so before its dissolution in 1991. Plot Bartholomew \\"Barley\\" Scott- Blair (Sean Connery), the head of a British publishing firm, arrives in Moscow on business. At a writers' retreat near Peredelkino, he speaks of an end to tensions with the West, heard by the mysterious \\"Dante\\" (Klaus Maria Brandauer), who demands Barley promise to do the right thing if the opportunity arises. A few months later, unable to locate Barley at a trade show, a young Soviet named Katya Orlova (Michelle Pfeiffer) asks publisher Nicky Landau (Nicholas Woodeson) to give Barley a manuscript. Landau sneaks a look and delivers it to British government authorities. The manuscript is a document detailing the Soviet Union's capability for waging nuclear war. An investigation reveals \\"Dante\\" is renowned Soviet physicist Yakov Efraimovich Saveleyev, author of the manuscript. British intelligence officers track Barley to his holiday flat in Lisbon and interrogate him about his ties to Katya, but realize he knows as little as they do. MI6 realizes the manuscript is also of vital importance to the CIA, with both agencies seeking Barley to work on their behalf. British agent Ned (James Fox) gives Barley some fundamental training as a spy. Barley returns to the Soviet Union to seek out Dante and confirm he is a genuine informant. He meets with Katya and is instantly smitten. Through her, he confirms that Dante is indeed Saveleyev, and he also denies to Katya that he is a spy. The British run the operation through its first phase while apprising the CIA of its results. The CIA team, headed by Russell (Roy Scheider), is concerned at the manuscript's description of the Soviet nuclear missile programme in complete disarray and suggests the United States has engaged in a pointless arms race. Katya sets up a meeting with Yakov, going to great lengths to avoid being followed. Barley explains that the manuscript is in the hands of British and American authorities. Yakov feels betrayed, but Barley convinces him that the manuscript can still be published, and is given another volume of the manuscript after assuring Yakov he is sympathetic to the scientist's cause. Impressed by the additional volume, Russell's boss Brady (John Mahoney) and U.S. military officer Quinn (J. T. Walsh) interrogate Barley to be certain of his loyalties. Russell states he would help the British operation out of a true ideological belief in Glasnost, although this would not be good news to his 'customers' in the weapons industry, who need an arms race for continued prosperity. Convinced the manuscripts are truthful, the CIA and MI6 create a \\"shopping list\\" of questions to extract as much strategic warfare information as Dante can provide. \\"Russia House\\" handler Ned senses something is amiss with Barley, but the British-American team continues its plans. Barley returns to the Soviet Union and declares his love to Katya, admitting he is an operative. Katya confesses that Yakov is not acting like himself and fears he may be under KGB observation or control. She gives Barley Yakov's address in Moscow. Under full British-American surveillance, Barley takes the shopping list to Yakov's apartment. Ned suddenly concludes that the Soviets know all about the operation and will steal the list to learn what the British and Americans know, and is convinced that Barley has made a deal to turn over the questions to the KGB. Russell disagrees, and instructs the mission to proceed as planned. The meeting with Yakov is expected to be brief, but after seven hours, Russell admits he was wrong. The team must now pretend the questions were deliberately false. Barley sends a note to Ned explaining that during a pre-arranged phone call to Katya, Dante used a code word to let her know that he has been compromised by the KGB and that her life is in danger. Barley admits he traded the shopping list to the Soviets in exchange for the safety of Katya and her family. He admits his actions might be unfair, but tells Ned, \\"You shouldn't open other people's letters.\\" Barley returns to his flat in Lisbon, where he waits for Katya and her family to begin a new life with him.

The opening sequences and the closing scenes were filmed on location in Lisbon, Portugal, and the sequence at the safe house was shot near Vancouver, British Columbia, while the remainder of the film was shot in London. Soundtrack The critically acclaimed music to The Russia House was composed and conducted by veteran composer Jerry Goldsmith. The score featured a mixture of Russian music and jazz to complement the nationalities and characteristics of the two main characters. There were four main featured soloists, with only one receiving a card on the opening titles - Branford Marsalis on soprano saxophone. Other soloists include a duduk player (an Armenian double reed instrument), pianist Mike Lang and double bassist John Patitucci. A soundtrack album has been released twice.

Hal Hinson in The Washington Post wrote: \\"Making a picture about the political situation in a country as much in flux as the Soviet Union can be disastrous, but the post-glasnost realities here seem plausible and up to the minute. The Russia House doesn't sweep you off your feet; it works more insidiously than that, flying in under your radar. If it is like any of its characters, it's like Katya. It's reserved, careful to declare itself but full of potent surprises. It's one of the year's best films.\\" Peter Travers in Rolling Stone wrote: \\"At its best, The Russia House offers a rare and enthralling spectacle: the resurrection of buried hopes.\\" Time Out less enthusiastically wrote: \\"Overtaken by East-West events, and with an over-optimistic ending which sets personal against political loyalty, it's still highly enjoyable, wittily written, and beautiful to behold in places, at others somehow too glossy for its own good.\\" Tom Stoppard's adapted screenplay was criticised by Vincent Canby in The New York Times: \\"There is evidence of Mr. Stoppard's wit in the dialogue, but the lines are not easily spoken, which is not to say that they are unspeakable. They are clumsy.\\" Roger Ebert held a similar view in the Chicago Sun-Times: \\"What's good are the few emotional moments that break out of the weary spy formula: Connery declaring his love for Pfeiffer, or the British and Americans getting on each other's nerves. But these flashes of energy are isolated inside a screenplay that is static and boring, that drones on lifelessly through the le Carr√© universe, like some kind of space probe that continues to send back random information long after its mission has been accomplished.\\" Sean Connery was praised for his portrayal of Barley, \\"bluff, incorrigible, jazz-loving... his finest performance in ages.\\" Variety wrote: \\"As the flawed, unreliable publisher, Connery is in top form.\\" Peter Travers in Rolling Stone thought he captured \\"the 'splendid quiet' that le Carr√© found in Blair.\\" Hal Hinson in The Washington Post wrote: \\"This may be the most complex character Connery has ever played, and without question it's one of his richest performances. Connery shows the melancholy behind Barley's pickled charm, all the wasted years and unkept promises.\\" Desson Howe, also in The Washington Post, wrote: \\"Sean Connery, like Anthony Quinn, takes a role like a vitamin pill, downs it, then goes about his bighearted business of making the part his idiosyncratic own.\\" However, he received criticism from the New York Times, who thought that the \\"usually magnetic Mr. Connery... is at odds with Barley, a glib, lazy sort of man who discovers himself during this adventure. Mr. Connery goes through the movie as if driving in second gear.\\" Michelle Pfeiffer also garnered critical plaudits for delivering \\"the film's most persuasive performance... Miss Pfeiffer, sporting a credible Russian accent, brings to it a no-nonsense urgency that is missing from the rest of the movie,\\" according to The New York Times. Desson Howe in The Washington Post wrote: \\"As Katya, a mother who risks her love to smuggle a document and falls for a Westerner in the process, her gestures are entirely believable, her accent (at least to one set of Western ears) is quietly perfect.\\" Peter Travers in Rolling Stone wrote that \\"Pfeiffer, who gets more subtle and incisive with each film, is incandescent as Katya.\\" Hal Hinson in The Washington Post congratulated her for portraying a rounded character: \\"Her triumph goes beyond her facility with the Russian accent; other actresses could have done that. She's great at playing contradictions, at being tough yet yielding, cloaked yet open, direct yet oblique. What's she's playing, we suspect, is the great Russian game of hide- and-seek. But Pfeiffer gives it a personal dimension. Katya holds herself in check, but her wariness, one senses, is as much personal as it is cultural -- the result, perhaps, of her own secret wounds. It's one of the year's most full-blooded performances.\\" However, Pfeiffer also had her detractors. Variety thought that her \\"Russian accent proves very believable but she has limited notes to play.\\" Time Out wrote that \\"Pfeiffer can act, but her assumption of a role for which her pouty glamour is inappropriate - a Russian office-worker seen rubbing shoulders in the bus queues - is a jarring note.\\" Awards and nominations Fred Schepisi was nominated for the Golden Bear at the 41st Berlin International Film Festival. Michelle Pfeiffer was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Motion Picture Drama, but lost to Kathy Bates in Misery (1990).  Home video release  Twilight Time released The Russia House on Blu-ray on July 12, 2016. The package included booklet notes by Julie Kirgo. The extras were a contemporary documentary from the film's release and an isolated score (non diegetic) and source (diegetic) music track but no commentary. The film had been released on DVD before the Blu-ray version.

Dankyi-Koranteng was hired on television during the premier season finale of The Apprentice Africa in Nigeria on (Nigerian Television Authority), Silverbird TV, Super Screen, and MBI Television; Ghana on (TV3); Kenya on (KTN); Uganda on (WBS); and Tanzania (TBC1). Until he was hired, Dankyi- Koranteng was the Customer Account Manager for Chinese Telecom giants Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. in Ghana. During the season, Dankyi-Koranteng was Project Manager on four occasions winning three. He was never taken to the boardroom by any other Project Manager as the weakest link throughout the season. Education He attended University Primary School in Kumasi and continued at Salvation Army Primary School in Accra. Isaac Dankyi-Koranteng started his secondary education at Abetifi Presby Secondary School in the Eastern Region (Ghana), and continued at Twene Amanfo Secondary School, in the Brong-Ahafo Region (Ghana) where he obtained his GCE 'O' Level Certificate in 1994. In 1996, Dankyi-Koranteng obtain GCE 'A' Level Certificate with A,A,B,B from Technology Secondary School in Kumasi. Dankyi-Koranteng graduated from the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) in 2001 with a Bachelor of Arts in Publishing Studies degree. In the university, Dankyi- Koranteng established himself as a capable leader when he was elected the Secretary of Unity Hall of residence in 1999. He was subsequently elected the President of the Hall in 2000 and also represented students on the University Residence Committee. In 2001, Isaac was elected the Co-ordinating Secretary of the National Union of Ghana Students (NUGS). Dankyi-Koranteng holds an MBA(General) from Wuhan University of Technology,2005. In China, Dankyi- Koranteng was elected the President of the National Union of Ghana Students in China (NUGS-China) The Apprentice Africa There were 18 contestants in all, including Deox Tibeingana, Hannah Acquah,Bekeme Masade, Anthony Njagi, Regina Agyare, Blessing Njoku, Oscar Kamukama, Michelle, Nancy Kalembe, Akatu Ochai, Eunice Omole, Joyce Mbaya, Nnamdi Mbonu, Eddie Mbugue, Kathleen Ndongmo and Omar Bah. Isaac was faced in the final with Eunice Omole, a 28-year-old Nigerian born in the United States. For the final task, Dankyi-Koranteng organized a walk through event for Bank PHB. He exhibited the strong financial growth of the bank to its customers as well as gave them a first hand experience of the banks CSR activities by showcasing a model house constructed by a brilliant but needy student on Bank PHB's scholarship scheme. The student was present to interact with customers of the bank. He also organized an interactive banking experience of the banks wide range of electronic and internet based products. His event ended with performances by Nigerian top comedian, Gbenga Adeyinka and Timi Dakolo of Idols West Africa fame. Though he was commended for putting up a good event, Biodun Shobanjo criticized him for allowing the comedian to handle the event as the master of ceremony. During the finale, Dankyi-Koranteng realising from the interview stage of the competition that his only weakness was being 'laid' back, did a damage control by debunking that perception by describing himself as tactfully aggressive. He enjoyed enormous support from most of the evicted contestant. The finale was dramatic as Omole accused Dankyi-Koranteng of having excelled as Project Management on the hard work of her and other contestants. Dankyi-Koranteng also accused Omole of having no integrity for condoning foul play during the show. However, it was the CEO's final call as he said he wanted an apprentice who possessed a combination of intelligence, street smartness, character, and integrity. Personal life Dankyi-Koranteng is married to Ghanaian gospel musician Obaapa Linda and they have three children, Darrel Asiama Dankyi- Koranteng, Aimee Sampomaa Dankyi-Koranteng and Hillary Kwesibea Dankyi- Koranteng. The Dankyi-Koranteng reside in Tema, Accra. Before the Apprentice Africa show, Isaac worked with Huawei Technologies Ltd for 3 years. He later worked with Bank PHB in Lagos, Nigeria, from 2008 to 2009 as a member of The Corporate Execution Team. He returned to Ghana and joined Airtel Ghana as the Corporate Sales Manager from 2009 to 2012 June and he joined IBM as Territory Sales Manager for Ghana. From January 2014 Isaac was appointed the Managing Director of Resourcery Ghana Limited, an IT integration giant in West Africa.

In this offense, a loophole in the rules governing kicking formations is used to disguise which offensive players would be eligible to receive a pass for any given play. It was designed by Kurt Bryan and Steve Humphries of Piedmont High School in California. The scheme was used at the high school level for two seasons before the national governing body of high school football, the National Federation of State High School Associations, closed the scrimmage kick loophole in February 2009, effectively banning important facets of the offense. Due to rules regarding player numbering and eligible receivers, the scheme as originally designed is not usable at most levels of football, including the National Football League and college football. The A-11 offense was to be the basis of the A-11 Football League (A11FL), a professional football league which was scheduled to play its first season in 2015. However, after announcing franchises names and scheduling \\"showcase games\\" in early 2014, the A11FL folded before taking the field.  History =Development= The A-11 offense was developed in 2007 by head coach Kurt Bryan and offensive coordinator Steve Humphries at Piedmont High School in Piedmont, California. Coming off a 5‚Äì6 record in 2006, the coaches were looking for an edge to compete against other teams that fielded more top athletes. Bryan and Humphries found a loophole in the rules concerning allowable punt formations which they used it to design an every-down offense in which all 11 (hence the name \\"A-11\\") players were potentially eligible to receive a forward pass. Using the A-11, Piedmont's record improved to 7‚Äì4 in 2007 and 8‚Äì3 in 2008, with the offense often confusing defenses and scoring more points.http://www.maxpreps.com/local/team/records/year_by_year_results.aspx?gendersport=boys,football&schoolid;=653cb677-764e-4d81-9a2d-42421e439e9chttps://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95035232 =Controversy, banning, and modifications= While some high school coaches noticed Piedmont's success with the A-11 and began incorporating aspects of the offense into their own playbooks, others called the system \\"an unsporting act\\" and \\"outside of the spirit of the rule code\\". Bryan and Humphries began heavily promoting coaching clinics, instructional DVDs, and other materials soon after completing their first season running the offense, which also drew criticism from other coaches.https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- dyn/content/article/2008/08/11/AR2008081102806.html High school athletic associations in North Carolina, West Virginia, Louisiana, and the District of Columbia banned the use of the A-11 for the 2008 season. In February 2009, the National Federation of State High School Associations rules committee voted 46-2 to close the loophole allowing the linemen-free formations featured in the A-11. The system's creators petitioned the California Interscholastic Federation to allow use of the offense over the next three seasons on an experimental basis, but the appeal was denied.Piedmont's innovative A-11 offense loses appeal The scheme's creators modified the system to comply with the rule changes in 2009. Though the offensive personal is spread out more than in conventional formations, this version of the A-11 abides by the numbering requirements, making it easier for the defense to determine which players could legally go out for a pass. As such, it is similar to spread schemes from the early days of football such as the Emory & Henry formation. As such, unlike the original A-11, the modified version is legal in most levels of football.  Basic concepts  The most striking characteristic of the A-11 is its use of a formation in which most offensive players except the center are spread out across the line of scrimmage standing upright. In conventional football formations, five or more offensive players are offensive linemen, who set up before each play in a three-point stance and who serve exclusively as blockers. Offensive linemen almost never carry the football and are almost always ineligible to catch a forward pass or even advance beyond the line of scrimmage before a pass is thrown. At most levels of football, (including the National Football League (NFL), college football, and American high school football), offensive linemen must wear jersey numbers from 50 to 79, marking them as ineligible receivers in all but very limited situations. In the A-11, however, offensive linemen in the traditional sense are not typically employed. Any player with any jersey number may be stationed anywhere across the line of scrimmage, and depending on their position at the snap, any player may serve as an eligible receiver on any given play. This was possible because, when the A-11 offense was introduced in 2007, a loophole existed in the high school rule books that allowed teams in a \\"scrimmage kick\\" (i.e., a punt or field goal) formation to be exempted from numbering requirements. Instead of employing five offensive linemen who are obviously ineligible to receive a pass, teams were allowed to station any player wearing any number anywhere on the field, causing confusion for the defense as they try to determine who might go out for a pass. And since there were no restrictions concerning when the \\"scrimmage kick\\" exemption could be used, the A-11 offense could be used on every down. To use the scrimmage kick formation exemption, the player who receives the snap (presumably the kicker or placeholder) must stand at least seven yards behind the line of scrimmage. The A-11 places the quarterback in that position, which becomes a deep shotgun formation. This has the effect of reducing the need for offensive line protection since defensive players have more ground to cover before reaching the passer. The offense also places an additional passing back (similar to the wildcat offense) in the backfield next to the quarterback, creating the potential for either back to receive the snap, pitch to the other back, run or pass the ball, block, or go out for a pass. The A-11 complies with the rule that caps the number of eligible receivers during any given play at five (maximum six if the quarterback hands the ball off or laterals to an ineligible receiver who then passes the ball). However, because players in the scrimmage kick formation can make themselves an eligible or ineligible receiver by going in motion or by simply stepping on or off the line of scrimmage, the defense does not know which offensive players will be eligible until just before the snap. This has the effect of confusing defensive personnel, as they must quickly figure out which offensive players to cover and adjust their assignments accordingly. The constantly changing offensive roles coupled with the deep position of the quarterback forced most opposing defenses to play a soft zone pass defense against the A-11, making it difficult to play standard run defense or pressure the quarterback. In the modified version of the A-11 developed after 2009, the center is flanked by ineligible numbered \\"anchors\\", basically creating a 3-man offensive line in the center of the formation. Like any ineligible receiver, the anchors can neither receive forward passes nor advance downfield before a forward pass is thrown across the line of scrimmage, but can catch lateral and backward passes, take handoffs, advance downfield prior to a screen pass to an eligible receiver, recover a short punt behind the line of scrimmage, or even throw the ball if it is handed, punted or pitched backwards to them. Two other players spread out along the line of scrimmage must also wear numbers that automatically make them ineligible, resulting in formations similar to the old swinging gate or Emory & Henry formations. In this version of the A-11, the offensive players who cannot legally go out for a pass are clearly identified before the snap by their uniform numbers, making it easier for the opposing team to set their defense accordingly.  Legality at various levels= High school = As mentioned, a loophole in the rules regarding punt formations allowed the A-11 to be used at the high school level until 2009, when the National Federation of State High School Associations rules committee closed the loophole. A modified version that complies with uniform numbering regulations can still be used. = College football = The scrimmage kick formation is allowed on fourth downs under NCAA rules and on conversion attempts, and a few situations which define a scrimmage kick formation with an additional requirement that \\"it is obvious that a kick may be attempted.\\" It is otherwise not allowed for most normal plays, making the original A-11 impossible to use on an every-down basis. = NFL = The A-11 as originally designed is not legal in the National Football League (NFL) due to rules concerning the required jersey numbers of players at different positions.An offensive revolution ESPN the Magazine Players who play at positions that are usually ineligible to receive a pass must declare themselves as eligible receivers to the referee if they will be lining up at an eligible position in a formation. The referee then announces their eligibility before the play, negating the surprise factor of not knowing which players may go out for a pass. The league imposed an additional rule to discourage teams from placing players with eligible numbers at an ineligible position (Bill Belichick had used such a strategy during select games in the 2014 season); as of the 2015 season, players with eligible numbers must line up in a position that makes it obvious that they are ineligible. The two-quarterback system is legal under NFL rules but (especially since the decline of the wildcat fad) seldom used. = CFL = The A-11 was also not legal under Canadian football rules. There is no scrimmage kick exemption in the Canadian Football League (CFL). Persons who wish to change position from an eligible to an ineligible receiver (or vice versa) must physically change their uniform to a number that reflects their eligibility, and must seek permission from the official to do so. Furthermore, until the end of the 2008 season the CFL rule book dictated that a designated quarterback must take all snaps, which made the two-quarterback system used by the A-11 (as well as offenses such as the Wildcat) illegal in the CFL. This rule was removed in CFL, mainly so that the Wildcat formation could be used. However, the A-11 is still unusable. = XFL = Some aspects of the A-11 might be legal in the new XFL, which is scheduled to start play in 2020. While numbering restrictions have not yet been announced, a proposed rule would allow offensive linemen to catch forward passes so long as they remain behind the line of scrimmage.XFL sends team to Mississippi to explore potential rule changes and What rule changes might be in store for the #XFL2020?

It is a not for profit event that celebrates the relationship between humanity & iron, steel and other metals. Hosted as a series of events combined under one large theme, celebrating the cultural heritage and diversity of the Lithgow region, it brings together artists, designers/makers, blacksmiths, performers of all kinds, musicians, historical re-enactors, machine enthusiasts and hobbyists from all over Australia, and the world. Two of the most popular annual events are large scale historical re-enactments: The St George's Day Jousting Tournament and the Napoleonic 'Battle of Lithgow'. History Ironfest was first held in April 2000 to celebrate the 100 year anniversary of the birth of steel in Australia, which occurred in Lithgow, New South Wales. Since that time Ironfest has taken out numerous cultural, tourism and business awards, and has been acclaimed as a unique regional cultural experience. It originally consisted of an exhibition of metal sculpture, paintings and drawings accompanied by blacksmith demonstrations by artist Harry Piers, and metal music by local band, ‚ÄòThe Mullpigs'. Around 25 artists participated in this first event which was held at Blast Furnace Park in Lithgow. In 2002 and 2003, it was held at the State Mine Museum, before moving in 2004 to its current home at the Lithgow Showground. In 2007 Ironfest was recognized by the NSW government as an event of State significance, recognizing the valuable economic contribution that the event makes to the local Blue Mountains Central West NSW region. Each year, it has grown on average by 20% both in terms of participants and visitors. In 2008 it involved close to 700 participants and attracted over 10,000 visitors. In 2009, it involved slightly more participants and again attracted in excess of 10,000 people. In 2011 the theme for Ironfest was Steampunk which attracted a large new audience from the inner city suburbs of Sydney. 2020 saw a virtual festival caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Built in 1890, the house is considered to be a combination of Stick and Eastlake styles. The identity of the architect is not known, though some have attributed the design to Joseph Cather Newsom. A short distance from the University of Southern California campus, the house is now used primarily for student housing. History The house was built as part of the Harper Tract developed by Miller & Herriott. In 1888, the two developers bought a piece of land west of Hoover Street, between the prestigious West Adams district to the north and the nascent University of Southern California to the south. They subdivided the land into 98 lots, building \\"substantial and tasty residences, costing not less than $3000 each.\\" Considered a \\"suburb\\" at the time, the Los Angeles Times correctly predicted: \\"The whole city is growing rapidly to the southwest, and it will not be long before it will be a misnomer to call that section a suburb.\\" The Miller and Herriott House is the oldest surviving structure in the Harper Tract. By 1980, the house had gone through 27 owners. It was restored in the early 1980s, though the original stained glass in the front door transom was removed for use in a restaurant near Disneyland. After touring the house in 1980, Los Angeles Times columnist Jack Smith called it \\"tall and lacy, with a plush, ornate and comfortably cluttered interior in Victorian style.\\" Commenting on the removal of the stained glass to an Orange County restaurant, Smith noted: \\"There was new glass in its place, but it looked like that wooden leg must have looked on Sara Bernhardt.\\" The exterior was used in 2012 in the fifth episode \\"Open House of Horrors\\" of the fourth season of the American sitcom Modern Family, while the interior was shot in the Holmes-Shannon House in Los Angeles. Landmark The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 and designated as a Historic Cultural Monument (HCM #242) by the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission in 1981.

In order to use existing tooling, five Chrysler (bore , stroke ) L-head inline six cylinder engines were arranged around a central shaft, producing a unique 30-cylinder engine in a relatively compact but heavy package. The crankshafts were fitted with gears, which drove a sun gear arrangement.Berndt, p.190. With iron block and head, it featured Carter TD-1 carburetors and 6.2:1 compression ratio, for an output of at 2400 rpm. It necessitated a longer hull (same as the M4A6),Berndt, p.192. becoming the M4A4; most of these were supplied to Allied countries under Lend-Lease. In the February 1944 issue of the magazine Popular Science, an advertisement by Chrysler claimed the A57 could still move the tank it was fitted in even if 12 out of its 30 cylinders were knocked out.Popular Science, February 1944, p.7. https://books.google.com/books?id=oiUDAAAAMBAJ&printsec;=frontcover&source;=gbs_summary_r&cad;=0_0#PPP1,M1 A total of 109 Lees and 7,499 Shermans were fitted with the A57. The M4A4 was largely supplied to the British, the US preferring the M4A3 with the more conventional Ford GAA V8 engine, and restricting their M4A4s to overseas use.Fletcher The Universal Tank, p 70 Museum display The engine was preserved at the Walter P. Chrysler Museum in America and at the Imperial War Museum Duxford in the United Kingdom. The Tank Museum in Dorset, England has a complete A57. That museum also acquired a second engine without radiator in 2019, from the UK Defence Academy at Shrivenham. Both are currently in storage in the museum's Conservation Centre.

The Chulevi monastery sits on the left bank of the Kvabliani river, near the town of Adigeni in the historic province of Samtskhe. The monastery is alternatively known as Chule (·É≠·É£·Éö·Éî) or Chulebi (·É≠·É£·Éö·Éî·Éë·Éò). The site was home to a monastic community already in the 11th century, but it was in the latter part of the 14th century that the current edifice was constructed to become a major religious and cultural center in south Georgia. An inscription in the medieval Georgian asomtavruli script reveals the name of the artist Arsen who frescoed the interior of Chulevi in 1381. The murals depict, inter alia, a group portrait of the local princely house of Jaqeli, patrons of the monastery. The Chulevi monastery shares a series of common features with the contemporary and nearby located churches of Zarzma and Sapara such as the typically elongated overall plan and the interior space, rectangular shape with no projections, a dome resting upon the walls of the altar and two cross- shaped pillars, the dome tholobate containing twelve windows with half of them false. At the same time, Chulevi is an example of decline in Georgian architecture and monumental painting due to two hundred years of Mongol dominance.–ó–∞–∫–∞—Ä–∞—è, –ü.

Monuments of Eastern Georgia](In Russian) After the Ottoman conquest of the area, the Chulevi monastery declined and had been completely abandoned by 1595. The locals, still Christian at that time, saved the bells and some other church items by burying them in the adjacent wood. The bells were accidentally discovered in the 1980s and donated to the Akhaltsikhe local museum but were eventually turned over to the monastery once it was restored to the Georgian Orthodox Church in October 1999. A team of Russian architects attempted, unsuccessfully, to repair the church in 1935/36 and several architectural details were lost in the process. Another attempt at rehabilitation was made in the 1970s and 1980s but was then interrupted. It was not until 2003 that systematic reconstruction fieldworks were launched and the monastery has largely been repaired since then.

Mary Parsons, Countess of Rosse (n√©e Mary Field; 1813‚Äì1885), was a British amateur astronomer and pioneering photographer. Often known simply as Mary Rosse, she was one of the early practitioners of making photographs from waxed-paper negatives.For more on waxed-paper negatives, see John Towler, \\"Negatives on Paper\\", chap. 29 of The Silver Sunbeam (New York: Joseph H. Ladd, 1864).  Life  Mary Field was born in 1813, in Yorkshire, the daughter of John Wilmer Field, a wealthy estate owner. Through her family she met the then Lord Oxmantown (1800‚Äì1867), an Anglo-Irish nobleman, and they were married on 14 April 1836. In February 1841, Lord Oxmantown succeeded his father in the family peerage to become The 3rd Earl of Rosse. Mary, Baroness Oxmantown, thus now became The Countess of Rosse. In the early 1840s the couple became interested in astronomy, and Mary helped her husband, Lord Rosse, build a giant telescope, that was considered a technical marvel in its time. She was an accomplished blacksmith ‚Äì which was very unusual for higher class women of this time ‚Äì and much of the iron work that supported the telescope was constructed by her. During the Great Famine of 1845‚Äì47 in Ireland she was responsible for keeping over five hundred men employed in work in and around Birr Castle, where she and her husband lived. The Countess of Rosse gave birth to eleven children, but only four survived until adulthood: * Lawrence Parsons, 4th Earl of Rosse (17 November 1840 ‚Äì 30 August 1908) * Reverend Randal Parsons (26 April 1848 ‚Äì 15 November 1936) * Hon. Richard Clere Parsons (21 February 1851 ‚Äì 26 January 1923), apparently made a name for himself building railways in South America. * Sir Charles Algernon Parsons (13 June 1854 ‚Äì 11 February 1931), known for his commercial development of the steam turbine. His wife, Lady Katherine Parsons and their daughter Rachel Parsons were founders of the Women's Engineering Society and its first and second presidents. Mary, Dowager Countess of Rosse, died in 1885.  Photography  In 1842, Lord Rosse began experimenting in daguerreotype photography, possibly learning some of the art from his acquaintance William Henry Fox Talbot. In 1854, Lord Rosse wrote to Fox Talbot saying that Lady Rosse too had just commenced photography, and sent some examples of her work. Fox Talbot replied that some of her photographs of the telescope \\"are all that can be desired\\". Lady Rosse became a member of the Dublin Photographic Society, and in 1859 she received a silver medal for \\"best paper negative\\" from the Photographic Society of Ireland. Many examples of her photography are in the Birr Castle Archives. Much of the topography of Birr Castle that she portrayed has changed very little, and it is possible to compare many of her photographs with the actual places. Notes References  Taylor, Roger.
