American privateer and the Royal Navy warship engaged in a fierce contest that ended with the capture of the British ship after a long battle.Maclay, pg. 311‚Äì319. Background HMS Dominica was a schooner under the command of the young Lieutenant George Wilmot Barette. She had a crew of 88 men and was armed with twelve 12-pounder guns, two long 6-pounders, one brass 4-pounder and one 32-pounder. The British vessel was escorting the packet ship Princess Charlotte.Hepper (1994), p146, At about 10:30 am on 5 August 1813 the schooner Decatur appeared on the horizon. Captain Dominique Diron commanded the privateer, which was armed with one 18-pounder Long Tom and six 12-pounder guns. She had a complement of 103 officers and crew. Diron approached cautiously but none of the vessels were flying colours. For over an hour the three vessels sailed side by side almost at gunshot distance as Diron attempted to ascertain the identity of the other vessels and to position his ship off Dominicas starboard bow. At 12:30 pm the Americans learned that their prey was a schooner-of-war when Lieutenant Barette raised the British flag and attempted to flee with the merchantman.Maclay, p.311‚Äì312. Capture At about 1:30 pm Dominica fired when it maneuvered in for an attack, but the shot fell short. Although Dominica was more heavily armed than Decatur, Diron chose to engage her. The Americans then raised their colors and beat to quarters. To ensure that none of his men fled below, Captain Diron ordered all the hatches closed after all the ammunition, water and grappling hooks were brought on deck. Diron planned to get as close as possible to Dominica without firing a shot so as to release a broadside and a discharge of musketry before boarding under cover of the smoke. It was around 2:00 pm when Decatur maneuvered for this but the Americans were answered with a broadside and a deadly duel ensued. The two schooners exchanged fire while the merchantman continued her escape.Maclay, p.312‚Äì313. The combatants fought at such a short distance from each other that Diron could hear Barette shouting to his men, telling them to take better aim and to fire into Decaturs hull. Their next salvos smashed two shot-holes through Decaturs hull, killing two men and also damaging the ship's sails and rigging. This, the most damaging British broadside of the battle, stopped an attempt at boarding and temporarily disabled Decatur, whose crew had to quickly repair the rigging. After repairs the Americans responded with fire from the Long Tom and began scoring more hits on Dominica. Many of the cannonballs landed on deck so the British tried to flee but Decatur was a fast ship and remained in Dominicas wake.Maclay, pg. 313‚Äì314 A seven gun American privateer schooner during the War of 1812. The battle was a chase at this point, neither side could accurately fire on each other and when Diron moved in for a second attempt at boarding, he was repulsed in the same manner as the first. Barrete's last maneuver prevented the Americans from boarding but he ultimately steered his ship out of the wind so Decatur was able to overhaul Dominica and carry out a third attempt at boarding. It was about 3:30 pm when Captain Diron ordered his boarders to prepare for going over the side. At the last moment, Diron moved his ship so that the bow sprit of Decatur was heading directly for Dominicas stern. The two ships collided and Diron's jib boom pieced Barette's mainsail. The Americans were then able to board and gain control of Dominicas deck, forcing her colors down and ending the fight.Maclay, pg. 314‚Äì315 Aftermath The Americans had five dead and fifteen wounded. Lieutenant Barette was mortally wounded but continued fighting with sword in hand until he died. In all, thirteen Royal Navy sailors were killed in action, forty-seven others were wounded, five mortally. Dominica and Decatur were both heavily damaged but Decatur managed to bring Dominica into Charleston, South Carolina a few days later. Captain Diron was made a hero for being one of the few privateer commanders to make a prize out of a Royal Navy warship during the war. Diron was already well known before the battle and Dominicas demise added to his notoriety. Barette was also reported by the Americans as having defended his ship until death in a most gallant fashion and when the survivors were released after the war, they said that they were treated well by Diron and his crewmen. The British never surrendered in the battle and were defeated by force alone.Maclay, pg. 314‚Äì319. Post script On 22 May 1814, recaptured Dominica.

His importance to modern scholarship comes from his writings in the field of Old Testament chronology. His study of the methods of the authors of the books of Kings and Chronicles led him to conclusions that were later discovered, independently, by Edwin R. Thiele. A distinctive of his approach was the use of citations in classical authors in order to obtain fixed dates in biblical history, most notably the date for the beginning of construction of Solomon‚Äôs Temple.  Biography  Coucke was born on 2 February 1888, in Poperinge, in the province of West-Flanders in Belgium. He studied in Leuven, where he obtained a bachelor's degree in theology (S.T.B.). He was ordained a priest of the Roman Catholic Church in 1912 and was appointed to several parishes: Bredene, Staden, and Hooglede (all in the diocese of Bruges in Belgium). In 1919, he became a professor at the Grootseminarie in Brugge/Bruges (Le Grand S√©minaire de Bruges), where he taught sacramental theology and moral theology. In 1927 he became the seminary‚Äôs librarian and also bursar, responsible for the finances of the seminary. In 1928, he was appointed canon of the Holy Savior‚Äôs Cathedral of Bruges. He died on 20 December 1951, in Bruges.  Academic Contributions  = Comparison of his chronology to that of Thiele = Coucke broke precedent with the approach of the Documentary Hypothesis that was popular among European scholars in his day by starting with the working proposition that the chronological data of Kings and Chronicles represented authentic traditions that could be understood once the methods of the ancient scribes were determined. This was in contrast to the skepticism to such an approach inherent in the postulates of the prevalent higher-critical methodology, which assumed that the chronological and other historical data of the Bible‚Äôs historical books were the product of late-date editors, and hence were of little or no historical value.\\"Wellhausen has shown, by convincing reasons, that the synchronisms within the Book of Kings cannot possibly rest on ancient tradition, but are on the contrary simply the products of artificial reckoning.\\" R. Kittel, A History of the Hebrews, (London, 1986), II, P. 234.\\"The numerical errors in the Books of Kings have defied every attempt to ungarble them. Those errors are largely the creation of the editors who set out to write a synchronistic history of Judah and Israel, using as sources two sets of unrelated court chronicles . . . the editors did not execute the synchronisms skillfully.\\" Cyrus Gordon, The World of the Old Testament (New York: 1958), p. 194. Coucke departed from this presupposition- based approach, using instead the data of the biblical texts as his starting place (an inductive approach). From those data, he came to the following conclusions: 1) During the period of the divided kingdom, Judah‚Äôs regnal year began in the fall month of Tishri, whereas that of the northern kingdom, Israel, began in Nisan. (Coucke also allowed that the northern kingdom may have begun its calendar in the Egyptian month of Thoth, since Jeroboam resided in Egypt for many years before becoming the first king of Israel, but Coucke was wrong in assuming that at the time of Egypt‚Äôs Third Intermediate Period, Thoth came in the spring at the same time as the Hebrew Nisan.) 2) For the first few years of the divided kingdom, Judah used accession reckoning for its kings, whereas Israel used nonaccession reckoning.Accession reckoning counts the partial calendar year in which a king came to the throne as his \\"zero\\" year, whereas nonaccession reckoning counts it as his first year. Both methods were used in the ancient Near East. When reckoning spans of time counted by nonaccession reckoning, one year must be subtracted from the total for each monarch. 3) During the rapprochement between the two kingdoms in the ninth century BC, Judah adopted Israel‚Äôs nonaccession reckoning. 4) Later, both kingdoms used accession reckoning until the end of their respective kingdoms, and 5) In order to make sense of the biblical data, coregencies, both those expressed explicitly in the text and those implied by the data, must be taken into account. This last principle has been much criticized when espoused by Thiele, but it is widely used by Egyptologists in their computations of Egyptian chronology.William J. Murnane, Ancient Egyptian Coregencies (Chicago: The Oriental Institute, 1977), esp. pp. 39, 44, 49, 81, 95, 169, 189‚Äì193, and 239. These five principles are identical to those later discovered by Edwin R. Thiele, who was unaware of Coucke‚Äôs work when he published the results of his doctoral dissertation in 1944.Edwin R. Thiele, \\"The Chronology of the Kings of Judah and Israel,\\" Journal of Near Eastern Studies 3 (1944), pp. 137‚Äì186. It apparently was Thiele‚Äôs colleague, Siegfried Horn, who introduced Thiele to the writings of Coucke when Horn came to America in 1946.Siegfried H. Horn, \\"The Chronology of King Hezekiah‚Äôs Reign,\\" Andrews University Seminary Studies 2 (1964), p. 44. In his subsequent writings, Thiele acknowledged the earlier work of Coucke, and he was gratified that the discovery of these basic principles by two scholars working independently served to authenticate the soundness of their respective approaches.Edwin R. Thiele, The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings (3d ed.; Grand Rapids: Kregel, 1981), p. 59, n. 17. The two authors, however, differed somewhat on how to apply the principles they had discovered, so that their chronologies disagree in several places. They are in exact agreement at the beginning of the divided monarchy, which both Coucke and Thiele placed in the year starting in Nisan of 931 BC. Coucke‚Äôs method of deriving this date differed radically from Thiele‚Äôs method, as explained in the next two sections. For the end of the kingdom period, Coucke placed the fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonians in the summer of 587 BC, whereas Thiele put it a year later, in 586. = His use of the Parian Marble to date construction of Solomon‚Äôs Temple = Coucke had some difficulty in determining dates for Ahab, king of Israel, and so he did not place the Battle of Qarqar, at which Ahab was present, as the last year of Ahab, as Thiele did in assigning absolute (BC) dates to the first kings of Israel. His date for the battle, 854 BC, was also one year too early, although that was the date used by most Assyriologists when he wrote. He knew that it would be unwise to assign absolute dates to the kings in this time frame based on his proposed emendations of their reign lengths, and so he sought a more reliable method of finding a fixed date for the early monarchic period. He developed such a method in just three sentences of his Suppl√©ment article, using classical authors with no utilization of any biblical text. His starting place was the end of the Trojan War, which the Parian Marble dated to the year 1208 BC, seven days before the end of the month of Thargelion, that is, 10 June 1208 BCFor the determination of the Julian date, see Rodger C. Young and Andrew E. Steinmann, \\"Correlation of Select Classical Sources Related to the Trojan War with Assyrian and Biblical Chronologies\\", Journal for the Evangelical Study of the Old Testament 1.2 (2012) 235 n. 30. (Coucke mistakenly thought that the Marble gave the year as 1207 BC, but the correct year of 1208 BC, as given at the Ashmolean Web site,http://www.ashmolean.org/ash/faqs/q004/q004006.html will be used in what follows). He then cited a statement of Pompeius Trogus/Justin (18:3:5) that said that Tyre was founded (or refounded)Tyre was in existence in the Amarna period (middle of 14th century BC), as shown by letters from its king to the pharaoh. However, it apparently had become abandoned and was subsequently resettled at the time of the invasion by the Sea Peoples, according to W. F. Albright, \\"The Role of the Canaanites in the History of Civilization\\" in G. E. Wright, ed., The Bible and the Ancient Near East (New York, 1961), p. 340, and H. J. Katzenstein, The History of Tyre from the Second Millennium B.C.E. until the Fall of the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 538 B.C.E. (Jerusalem, 1973), pp. 59‚Äì61. The first invasion of the Sea People was in the reign of Merneptah (ca. 1213‚Äì1203 BC). Coucke‚Äôs date of 1209 BC for the (re)founding of Tyre, as derived from Josephus, would place it in this first invasion of the Sea Peoples when, according to Pompeius Trogus, the people of Ashkelon were driven from their city, after which they occupied Tyre. The Merneptah stele from Merneptah‚Äôs fifth year says that \\"Carried off is Ashkelon.\\" one year before the fall of Troy, that is, in 1209 BC.Coucke assumed that the founding of Tyre was in the summer preceding the fall of Troy. With his date of May 1207 BC for the fall of Troy, the founding of Tyre would be the summer of 1208 BC. Using the Tishri-based years that Coucke assumed for Tyre, this would be the year starting in Tishri of 1209 BC. From Josephus, who apparently was using the archives of Tyre as his source, he determined that it was either 240 years (Antiquities 8:3:1/62) or 241 years (Against Apion 1:18/126) from Tyre‚Äôs founding to the 11th or 12th year of Hiram, King of Tyre, at which time Hiram sent assistance to Solomon at the beginning of construction of the Temple in Jerusalem. Coucke therefore determined that Temple construction began in either (1209 BC ‚Äì 240 =) 969 BC or (1209 BC ‚Äì 241 =) 968 BC, depending on whether it was in the eleventh year of Hiram (so Antiquities) or his twelfth year (so Against Apion).V. Coucke, \\"Chronologie biblique\\" in Suppl√©ment au Dictionnaire de la Bible (ed. Louis Pirot; Paris: Librairie Letouzey et An√©, 1928), Vol. 1, col. 1251. = His use of the Tyrian King List to refine this date = Coucke had another avenue of approach to the date of construction of Solomon‚Äôs Temple. Like the first approach that started from the Parian Marble‚Äôs date for the fall of Troy, his second method was also derived from classical writings, with no utilization of biblical texts. It made use of the list of Tyrian kings recorded in Josephus‚Äôs Against Apion 1:17/108 and 1:18/117‚Äì126. In providing the list of kings, Josephus said he was taking his information from Menander of Ephesus, who translated the records of the Tyrian archives from Phoenician into Greek. Although the individual reign lengths of the various kings in the list show considerable variation due to copying errors over the centuries since Josephus wrote, the total number of years given from the time that Hiram sent assistance to Solomon at the beginning of Temple construction to the flight of Dido/Elissa from Tyre, after which she and her associates founded Carthage, has been preserved intact due to its three-fold repetition. This figure is given twice as 143 years and eight months, and once as 155 years from the accession of Hiram, minus the 12 years until he began to help Solomon. This redundancy of expression has preserved the total of years in virtually all extant copies of the Tyrian King List, so that Coucke and other scholars have felt confident in using it in their calculations. Coucke derived either 825 or 824 BC as the possible dates for the founding of Carthage, based on Pompeius Trogus‚Äôs statement that it was founded 72 years before the founding of Rome, for which Coucke accepted either 753 BC (Varro) or 752 BC (Dionysius of Halicarnassus). Using the statement of Josephus/Menander that placed the founding of Solomon‚Äôs Temple 143 years earlier than the founding of Carthage, Coucke derived 968 or 967 BC as the dates for the founding of Solomon‚Äôs Temple. Since only the first of these agreed with the two dates he had derived when starting from the Parian Marble (969 and 968), he decided on 968/67 BC as the time of foundation of the Temple. He assumed Tyre used Tishri-based years, since the use of Phoenician month-names (Ziv, Bul, Ethanim) in the time of Solomon suggested that Israel and Tyre were using the same calendar at this time in their histories.V. Coucke, \\"Chronologie des rois de Juda et d‚ÄôIsra√´l,\\" Revue b√©nedictine 37 (1925), p. 327. With this assumption, he then turned to the biblical datum that construction began in the spring month of Ziv, deriving the date for the beginning of construction as the spring of 967 BC, with Solomon‚Äôs fourth year (1 Kings 6:1) starting in Tishri of 968 BC.  Writings  Only two publications by Coucke are known. The earlier is the article \\"Chronologie des rois de Juda et d‚ÄôIsra√´l,\\" Revue b√©nedictine 37 (1925), pp. 325‚Äì364. The ideas and chronology of this article were expanded and included in his contribution to the article \\"Chronologie biblique\\" in Suppl√©ment au dictionnaire de la Bible, ed. Louis Pirot, vol. 1 (Paris: Librairie Letouzey et An√©, 1928), cols. 1245‚Äì1279. In late 2010, a search by the principal librarian of the Grootseminarie library, where Coucke had been principal librarian several decades previously, failed to find any further publications for which he was the author.

The band was made up of members of various other punk bands from the area and existed from 1997 until early 2001, releasing numerous seven-inch records and splits, releasing one full-length album, and touring the United States twice. Biography Le Shok formed in 1997 (originally under the name The Shock) by Asshole Andrew (Treadwell) on guitar, Joey Juvenile (The Locust) on drums, and Hot Rod Todd on vocals. After hearing a rehearsal tape, Darryl Licht (Action League) joined the band on keyboards and Over the Counter Rusty (Treadwell) joined as bassist. The band released four seven-inch records on various labels, and in 2000, Gold Standard Laboratories released the band's sole album, We Are Electrocution, and the band went on a nationwide tour of the United States. Shitty Shaan, who had filled in for Darryl Licht at shows he couldn't make, was eventually brought on full-time as a second guitarist. When Darryl left the band, Shaan switched to keyboards. Material recorded while the band was a six-piece found its way onto various vinyl releases. When Andrew subsequently left the band, Shaan took over guitar duties and John Fones of Tunigs was brought in on keyboards. Following their second U.S. tour, Fones departed and Darryl briefly rejoined the band before Shaan quit, signaling the demise of the band in early 2001.

It was founded in Sarasota, Florida by Denise Kowal. During the festival artists use chalk, and occasionally special paint, to paint the road surface to create large works of art while the viewer can watch the creative process. The festival is focused around the street artists who are known as Madonnari in Italy or commonly referred to Street Painters, Chalk Artists, Sidewalk Artists, or Pavement Artists. The festival is held annually in downtown Sarasota in Burns Square. On October 28, 2013 the festival was featured by the New York Times as a destination recommended on its Guide to Intelligent Travel.Coming Events In Florida, A Guide to Intelligent Travel, In Transit, Calendar, New York Times, October 28, 2013Cummings, Ian, Chalk festival gets travel blog's nod, Sarasota Herald-Tribune, Tuesday, October 29, 2013 History In 2010 during its third season, the Sarasota Chalk Festival became the first international street painting festival in the United States of America,The First International Street Painting Festival in the United States, Cuomo, Alessio and de Nooij, Sander, Coldsun Productions, 2010 inviting artists from around the world to participate. Setting a unique theme for each year was instituted for the planning of each annual event with that year as well. Documenting the origins, diversity, spirit, appeal, and growing popularity of street painting, filming for a 2013 film on modern street painting around the world began with scenes and interviews at the first international Sarasota festival; a video production describing the film was released in February 2012.Westerink, Peter, de Nooij, Sander, Cuomo, Alessio, I Madonnari, 2012, ColdSun Productions and Planet StreetPainting, Netherlands A book, Sarasota Chalk Festival (right), was published by the festival organization in time for availability at the 2011 festival. The 214-page book, described as a collector edition, provides an extensive history of the street painting it features and discusses many of the artists who have become famous for performing the art at various locations around the world. Many of these artists were invited to the debut of broadening the scope of the festival to international status. The book provides examples of their work‚Äîeither here or abroad. Many of the artists return each year, so the material remains timely as well as historic. It also describes the music and arts on Sarasota's \\"Cultural Coast\\" and the many attractive Sarasota beaches on the Gulf of Mexico. The book has been available at each festival since its publication and always is available at the festival offices. =Themes= = ‚Äî 2010 ‚Äî Halloween = The theme of the 2010 festival was Halloween. Many renowned street painters from all over the world participated in the event that was held October 25 through October 31. More than 80,000 people attended the seven-day event, and in an unprecedented action prompted by the popularity of the festival, the municipal government extended the street closure for an additional day so people could view the completed artworks. Several documentaries were created about the 2010 festival that were released locally and in Europe, including the first documentary on Street Painting to be released at the Grazie di Curtatone 24-hour Madonnari Competition, August 15, 2012. Sarasota Chalk Festival founder Denise Kowal was invited to be a judge at the 2011 Grazie di Curtatone, making her the second foreigner and first American to be invited to judge this prestigious festival that was the first street painting festival in the world. The Grazie di Curtatone festival is celebrating its fortieth anniversary in 2012 and Denise Kowal was invited again to be a judge of the competition. The featured artist at the Sarasota festival, Maestro Madonnaro and Guinness World Record holder, Edgar Mueller, created a three-dimensional (3-D) street painting that made history for introducing a new perspective in street art that with special equipment may be seen in three-dimensions. This ground-breaking street painting also appeared to change from a giant by day, to a fetus by night, through the use of photoluminescent paints and artificial lighting. It measured 100' x 40'. A second guest artist and first Guinness World Record holder for a street painter, Tracy Lee Stum, also was featured in 2010. She created a two-point perspective 65' x 30' 3-D interactive Mousetrap game and completed the installation with assistance from Sharyn Namnath, Julio Jimenez, Charlene Lanzel, and Fred Wilms. A third Guinness World Record holder, Leon Keer, traveled from the Netherlands and won third place for his original street painting featuring depictions of Alice in Wonderland and Little Red Riding Hood. Genna Panzarella, the first woman to be awarded the Maestra Madonnaro title in Grazie di Curtatone, Italy, created a giant painting of a skeletal horse during the festival. and Maestro Madonnaro Vera Bugatti traveled from Italy to America for the first time in order to create her original street painting, incorporating a Batman theme.

They included the Hallowscreen Fringe Film Festival with indoor and outdoor movies organized by executive director Lori Bowen, the France Engels Couture 60' Runway Show in cooperation with Carrianna Hutchinson, Sarasota's Largest Pumpkin Carving Contest, a performance stage with multiple artists such as flutist Jane Hoffman and guitarist Rick Peterson, the Moving Ethos Dance Company, the West Coast Civic Ballet, the Jump Dance Company, The Garbage-Men, and the Dragonfly Caf√© Poets. = ‚Äî 2011 ‚Äî Pavement art through the ages= In 2011, with the theme 'Pavement Art Through the Ages', the Sarasota Chalk Festival attracted 250 renowned pavement artists from all over the world. Artists from France, Australia, Germany, Canada, Peru, Spain, Mexico, Netherlands, Japan, Italy, France, and Brazil as well as from almost every state in the United States traveled to participate in the week-long festival that drew 200,000 visitors. Three-dimensional A museum gallery displaying works by Kurt Wenner, the innovator of three-dimensional (3-D) pavement art, was held and Wenner presented six lectures and demonstrations as well as creating a street painting with students as an instructional lesson on perspective during the event. Wenner had started the first street painting festival in the United States more than 25 years previously. Dutch artist Leon Keer returned to the festival and, along with other members of Planet Street Painting, executed a 3-D depiction of China's Terracotta Army in Lego. This piece attracted international media attention including videos Sarasota Chalk Festival, images and link to a video (no real than you are) on the painting, The Art Whisperer, Sarasota Day, September 12, 1012 on the work. It was painted in conjunction with the appearance of a 9-feet-tall Lego man, by artist Ego Leonard, that washed up on Siesta Key in Sarasota on October 25, 2011 with the words, \\"No Real Than You Are\\", emblazoned on his green T-shirt. The giant Lego man was \\"arrested\\" on charges of \\"loitering\\" by the Sarasota County sheriff, and many attempts were made to release Ego Leonard in time for him to attend the festival. Unfortunately, these attempts failed and he missed the entire festival. The sheriff stated that the sculpture must be kept for ninety days so that its owner had time to claim it. With no one coming forward as his owner, finally, he was released to Denise Kowal after the ninety-day period had elapsed. Ego Leonard stayed in Sarasota at historic Burns Square until July 2012, when he \\"swam\\" to Los Angeles, California where he was invited to show his artwork. Another monumental 3-D installation created at the festival was a 30' x 60' opera set by the Baltimore artist, Michael Kirby. The piece was a mix of 3-D art painting and real props and it was created for a performance of Madame Butterfly by the Sarasota Opera. This undertaking was the first of its kind. Among the many monumental 3-D installations at the festival others included, a 30' x 60' piece entitled Avatar by German artist Gregor Wosik, a 15' x 20' piece depicting mermaids by USA artist Melanie Stimmell, a 15' x 15' piece entitled Four Continents by USA artist Julie Kirk- Purcell, a 15' x 30' circus piece by Spanish artist Eduardo Relero, a 15' x 20' piece entitled Books by Brazilian artist Eduardo Kobra,Ngebgebgenm Eduardo Kobra √© premiado no Sarasota Chalk Festival, October 11, 2011 a 30' x 40' piece entitled Augmented Realty by USA artists Art for After Hours, a 12' x 24' piece entitled Pirate Ship by USA artists Wayne and Cheryl Renshaw, and a 15' x 30' piece entitled Skatepark by USA artist Rod Tryon. Cellograff The 2011 festival introduced Cellograff to the United States. It is a form of graffiti executed on cellophane wrapped between poles. More than five of these temporary installations were created by iKanoGrafik. Going Vertical The 2011 Sarasota Chalk Festival also added Going Vertical as an additional feature of the festival and invited graffiti artists and muralists from around the world to participate.Weingarten, Abby, ‚ÄúGoing Vertical‚Äù extends the Chalk Festival off the streets, Sarasota Herald-Tribune, Ticket, Thursday, October 4, 2012 French artist MTO from Berlin,Street art and murals by MTO, Flicker, accessed 2012.10.12 Kanos, Astros, and Katre from France, ChorBoggie and Max Ehrman from California, Eduardo Kobra from Brazil,LaHurd, Jeff, The hustle and bustle of Sarasota's golden age, Sarasota Herald Tribune, March 18, 2012Portfolio Eduardo Kobra, Issuu, May 23, 2012 A mural depicting a historic scene of the busy downtown in Sarasota at the turn of the twentieth century was created by Eduardo Kobra that covered the entire eastern side of a prominent building in Burns Square. It has become the background for photographs of the main events and primary drawings of each succeeding festival. Anat Ronan, Sunny Miller from Lafayette, Indiana, Dutch artist Remko Van Schaik, and many regional artists including Truman Adams completed works in different areas of the city. The artists were assigned to create murals on the walls of several buildings selected in the city, including both private and public properties, but visually accessible to the public. The pieces were created in cooperation with the artists, the city, and the property owners. Following the festival, on November 30, the architect and the city held a reception atop its dramatic new parking garage on Palm Avenue to celebrate the murals that had been painted on each of its five floors as part of Going Vertical. Each floor has a unique mural celebrating the arts in Sarasota, representing dance, film, music, opera, and theatre.Schelle, Charles, City Celebrates Murals at Palm Avenue Garage, Sarasota Patch, December 1, 2011 The garage murals were funded through a public art fund that is created with donations required of the developers of new buildings in the city who do not provide public art for their project. = ‚Äî 2012 ‚Äî Circus City USA = In January 2012 the dates of that year's annual event were announced on the festival's web site as, October 28 through November 6, and the theme, Circus City, USA, was declared. The theme of the festival was chosen to celebrate the 1920s in Sarasota, when the city became the winter home of the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus. Throughout the year announcements of celebrity artists and performers who would be featured included Sarasota resident and tight rope walker Nik Wallenda, 3-D pavement art innovator Kurt Wenner, Ego Army artist Leon Keer, and Sword-swallower Johnny Fox. Performers from Circus Sarasota, Sailor Circus, Big Cat Habitat, and Fuzion Dance were scheduled to participate. The 2012 festival also would feature international acrobats and performers alongside the artworks and two life-size sculptures of Indian elephants, as well as two performance stages and a music stage. A publisher of several local newspapers created a free, forty-page guide to the ten-day festival (right) that provided a map of the 2012 festival, a timeline for its events, articles featuring most of the special events, documentation of donors and volunteers, as well as a history of the festival and the street art it presents. This free publication was made available in the Sarasota Observer, at many local stores and venues throughout the county, at the offices of the festival, and it was handed to attendees as they entered the festival gates as well as at refreshment and souvenir sales booths among the artworks on the street. The Observer is a newspaper that is distributed for free at newsstands, museums, libraries, government offices, stores, and sidewalk literature boxes in neighborhoods throughout the county. International coverage of the 2012 festival began with the start of the three-dimensional artwork and this news report, Chalk street art festival heads to Florida, discusses the Kurt Wenner piece extensively.Chalk street art festival heads to Florida, jn1, November 2, 2012 Numerous videos about the 2012 chalk festival, have been released in the United States and various native countries of the artists, as well as by fans and producers of similar festivals. Ego Leonard, who appeared on a Sarasota beach in 2011 and became ranked as the Number 2 oddball story of the year 2011 according to Time, was featured at the festival. He missed last year during his protective custody \\"incarceration\\" by the Sarasota county sheriff. Snowflake and Surus, two life-sized sculptures of Indian elephants, were created to mark the entrances to the festival. They quickly became a favorite of the crowds. After the close of the festival, they were retained on the private property of the founder of the festival, at her historic building that was built by Owen Burns at the point defining the Burns Square section of town that hosts the festival each year. The elephant pair took on a life of their own, becoming a community favorite for photographs and regular visits. When removed for restoration before being integrated into the 2013 festival, they became a topic of concern,Favorite, Merab, Where Did the Elephants in Burns Court Square Go?, Sarasota Patch, News Around Town, Thursday, August 1, 2013 until reassurances that they would return were published. Going Vertical also accompanied the festival in 2012 for a second season with Pixel Pancho, Entes y Pesimo, MTO, and many more national and international street artists participating. Many dramatic and colorful murals were created and under the leadership of its manager, Kafi Benz, the project expanded to include a mural in Manatee County. The final mural of the 2012 project, Go, Go, Denise, Go!, was painted in December by MTO and featured an image of the chalk festival director as a boxer, presumably in response to the skirmishes in which she acted to defend the street artists when a few people criticized the cutting- edge-street-art nature of some of the artwork,Smith, Jessi, Get a ringside seat: MTO is not pulling any punches in his latest mural, This Week in Sarasota, December 20, 2012 and about which MTO produced a documentary movie, FL: unpremeditated movie,MTO, FL: unpremeditated movie, 2013, Berlin, Germany that was released in March 2013. The festival and the murals received accolades in the community and planning for the 2013 season began quickly in January with conferences with city officials about early approvals for essential logistical details for the event scheduled for mid-November. = ‚Äî 2013 ‚Äî Legacy of valor = Honoring veterans for the 2013 Chalk Festival was suggested by its official photographer since 2011 and a veteran of the Vietnam War, David Taylor. Choosing the suggestion enabled the festival to receive a sponsorship by the Patterson Foundation, which donated extensive additions to the Sarasota National Cemetery and kicked off its celebrations leading up to the opening of the planned amphitheater. Partnering with the foundation resulted in the adoption of its theme, Legacy of Valor: honoring veterans, inspiring patriotism, and embracing freedom and planning on the adaptation to events scheduled for the festival began. The poster for 2013 (right) carries the festival theme to a universal level, emphasizing the \\"heart\\" felt by veterans, support personnel, and citizens alike in a legacy of valor. More than 500 artists and thousands of people participated in the event embracing the theme as the festival began on November 13 and lasted six days through November 18. The festival announced in July that it would expand significantly farther to the north for 2013, doubling its area, and the Sarasota Observer provided a map with a diagram of the new areas of Pineapple Avenue that would host portions of the event.Gnaegy, Mallory, Sarasota Chalk Festival to cover more ground in fewer days, Sarasota Observer, Tuesday, July 30, 2013 The event extended across Main Street in the heart of downtown, past Five Points Park, to First Street. The southerly boundary of the festival remained in Burns Square where South Pineapple Avenue converges with South Orange Avenue. Sculpture was featured at the festival again, but in a grander scale. A minimalist sculpture garden based on the Sarasota National Cemetery was featured prominently at one section of the festival, taking up an entire block that to emphasize the solemnity of the sacrifice fallen veterans made for their country. The garden consisted of headstones and memorial features. Participation by festival goers was planned to honor veterans known or related to them as well as to all working to defend the country throughout its existence, including Rosie the Riveter! Ceremonies in the garden were held throughout each day, ending with \\"Taps\\" at dusk. In August the festival responded to the extensive concern in the community about the two elephant sculptures being removed from Burns Square by explaining that they would return and be integrated into the 2013 festival.Favorite, Merab, Where did the Elephants in Burns Square Go?, Sarasota Patch, August 1, 2013Elephant Statues downtown moved to Kowal's building, Longboat Key News, August 10, 2013 In September the festival organization made an announcement that a curated exhibition of studio artworks by major artists participating in the chalk festival and Going Vertical, Reimagining the Sarasota Chalk Festival Artists, was planned.Krapcheva, Elena, Re-Imagining Sarasota Chalk Artists Art Nov.15-24 at the Ice House, video of preparations for the exhibit and the opening Although recognized as street artists, their studio works also hang in museums around the world.

The founder, Denise Kowal, organized artists from around the world to create a Guinness World Record for the Largest Anamorphic (3d) Pavement Art in the world. Kurt Wenner, the innovator of the 3d pavement art form created the design composed of 11 square sectors, each sector was 42 feet on a side and composed of 14 tiles- three feet square each. This makes a total footage of 19,404 square feet. Wenner wrote Kowal, \\"As I was composing the work I became very aware of the implications of the size. It is really an almost impossible task. A single extra row of plain (unbroken) tiles painted around the work would put this size over 22,000 square feet.\\" The artists led by Julie Kirk- Purcell, one of the first female pioneers of the art form, finished the piece in 11 days with one rain day. Artists even added fossils in the rocks and signed their names to make the 1/4 mile walk around the painting interesting to viewers. The final measurements was measured at 22,747.6 square feet by Strayer Survey & Mapping in accordance with the National Surveying Standards meeting the accuracy standards required for the record. In February 2015 Guinness World Records, the global authority on record-breaking achievements, announced that the Sarasota Chalk Festival, a 501c3 nonprofit cultural arts organization, secured the title for the 'Largest Anamorphic Pavement Art' in the world during the November 2014 Chalk Festival in Venice, Florida, U.S.A. Anamorphic (3D) pavement art that involves tricking the brain into seeing something rise above or sink below a flat surface was invented by KURT WENNER in 1982 by combining traditional street painting with his classical training and understanding of illusion. Artists traveled from all over the world to participate, including past record holders, Remko van Schaik from the Netherlands, Marion Ruthardt, Gregor Wosik and Lydia Hitzfeld from Germany. Other notable pavement artists included Matthew May from the Netherlands, Roberto Carlos Trevi√±o Rodriguez, Carlosalberto Gh, Adry del Roc√≠o and Ruben Arriaga from Mexico, Frederike Fredda Wouters from Germany, Tomoteru ToMo Saito from Japan, Alex Maksiov from Ukraine, JM Navello from France, Vera Bugatti, Ketty Grossi, Luigi Legno, Tony Cuboliquido and FabioFedele ItalianStreetpainting from Italy, Philippenzo Madonnaro, Darya Sharova and Victorio Puzzini from Russia, Sergio Nino from Columbia, Sharyn Chan Namnath, Genna Panzarella, Lori A.

The attempt was made possible because of hundreds of people that included the support of all the artists, volunteers, visitors and major sponsors such as the City of Venice, Fairfield Inn & Suites of Venice, Sharky's On The Pier, Suncoast Air Center, Safway Scaffolding, Sherwin Williams Paint, Pro Paint, Venice Fire Department, LandShark Lager, Venice Gondolier Sun, Clothesline Tees and Kenyon Kowal. = ‚Äî 2019 ‚Äî Museum in Motion= On April 5-7, 2019 the chalk festival returned to Burns Square Historic District in downtown Sarasota. This special date for a festival was created to take the place of the November 2018 festival that was cancelled due to a red tide event in southwest Florida involving the Gulf of Mexico and the bays along Sarasota County.

Solovetsky Monastery, Russia) - was a Russian Orthodox Deacon, a convert to Byzantine Catholicism, and one of the first martyrs of the Russian Catholic Church.  Biography  Born as the son of a Russian Orthodox priest, Peter Artemiev spent his childhood in Nizhny Novgorod, Vasilsursk and Suzdal. In years 1687-1688 he studied at the Slavic Greek Latin Academy in Moscow. In February 1688, as a \\"student and a novice\\" he travelled with Ioannikos Litkhoudis to the Republic of Venice. In Venice, Artemiev secretly adopted Catholicism. From Venice he travelled to Rome on pilgrimage and to see the Pope, and at the end of 1688 he returned to Moscow. Here Patriarch Adrian ordained him to the rank of deacon. While serving in the Peter and Paul Orthodox Church, Artemev became friendly with Moscow Jesuits Jerzy David and T. Tikhavski. After their expulsion ( 5 October 1689 ), confessed to the Jesuit missionary Fr. Conrad Terpilovsky, in Moscow on his way from Persia. In 1698, Deacon Peter began to openly profess and preach reunion with the Holy See. According to a denunciation of the priest at St. Peter and Paul Church to Patriarch Adrian, he \\"harbors many who follow his heresies\\". Summoned from Suzdal, Peter's father could not persuade him to renounce Catholicism. Peter was sent to the Novospassky Monastery, where the wrote a letter to Patriarch, expressing willingness to accept martyrdom, denouncing the Patriarch and his Greek favorites, and defended the rights of the Old Believers. (The message has not been preserved, but we know the answer to it, entitled \\"Unmasking the Fallacies of Deacon Peter\\"). 13 June 1698, according to the decision of Council with the participation of Patriarch Adrian, and other senior hierarchs of the Russian Orthodox Church, Artemiev was defrocked, anathematized and banished to a Vazhsky Monastery in Kholmogory diocese. Orders were given to keep him in strict isolation, do not give him ink and paper for writing and to not allow to attend the church. While imprisoned there between July 5 and 11 September 1698, Deacon Peter remained faithful to Catholic beliefs, continued to denounce the anti-Catholic elements of the Orthodox Church and preaching reunion with Rome. As a result, Bishop Athanasius of Kholmogory imprisoned him in Solovetsky Monastery, where Deacon Peter Artemiev died.

Blount was educated at Brasenose College, Oxford where he matriculated in 1623. He was admitted to Grays Inn in 1624. He was present at the meetings of Royalist country gentlemen at Maidstone, which resulted in the getting up the Kentish petition of March 1642, and turned informer, giving an account of the proceedings in evidence at the bar of the House of Commons. He was a colonel in the Parliamentary Army during the Civil War. On the Restoration of the monarchy he was imprisoned but subsequently released. He represented Kent as an MP in the Barebones Parliament of 1653. He was a highly ingenious man and knew many of the Fellows of the Royal Society. He was himself admitted as a Fellow in February 1665 but resigned in 1668. He constructed with his own hands a carriage with an improved action, \\"for the ease of both man and horse\\", which attracted considerable attention at the time, and is often mentioned by Samuel Pepys.

The treaty was negotiated by the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit, Adolfo de la Huerta, and the chairman of the ICBM, Thomas W. Lamont. It was considered the initial step in the normalization of the foreign relations of Mexico and was the basis of the next several decades of Mexican foreign financing agreements. Background Mexico had been in default on its bonds since late 1913. Thomas W. Lamont ca. 1922 Claiming pressure from European bankers, in 1918, Lamont solicited the approval of the State Department to organize an international committee of bankers. In February 1919, the State Department granted approval to bring together American, British, and French banks, which were concerned with investments in Mexico on the condition that control of the committee's policy remain in American hands.The international committee of bankers on mexico - Consortia Initially, 50% of the seats on the committee were for American banks, with 25% each for English and French banks. Banking interests from Switzerland, Netherlands, and Belgium were later added to the committee. On February 23, 1919, bankers and representatives of foreign bondholders created the ICBM. The ICBM included the most prominent and influential commercial and investment banks of the time. It was designed to be a powerful mediator between bondholders and the Mexican government. No major bank in the world would have been able to build a syndicate to lend to Mexico without having a selection of ICBM members. The ICBM agreement stated that Mexican debt bondholders would agree to adhere to the ICBM agreements with the Mexican government. At its peak in 1925, the ICBM represented 97% of Mexico‚Äôs debt holders.http://www.international.ucla.edu/economichistory/summerhill/musacchio.pdf There was a significant amount of pressure from both the United States and Europe for Mexico to repay its debts and to deal with issues around Article 27 of the Political Constitution of the United Mexican States. =Different priorities= There was a tension between the repayment of debt and the Mexican government‚Äôs potential control over Mexican natural resources, which could be used to pay down the debt. The State Department wanted the bankers to get their money and for assets not to be seized, but the bankers tried to keep the two issues separate. Article 27 of the Political Constitution of the United Mexican States implied that US citizens' oil holdings in Mexico could be seized. In 1921, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation ruled that Article 27 was not retroactive for oil reserves if \\"positive acts\\" had been undertaken to exploit them. Therefore, only untouched lands were covered under Article 27.Triumphs and Tragedy: A History of ... - Google Books The United States had initiated a ban on loans to Mexico in 1921 and had put the repudiation of Article 27 as its condition for lifting the ban. At the time, the United States had a virtual monopoly on potential lending capital. Lamont and the ICBM were only marginally concerned with Article 27 and its effect on American oil companies. The primary concern of the bankers was to protect the holders of Mexican securities. The United States wanted all American claims against Mexico to be settled simultaneously. The ICBM, on the other hand, was willing to negotiate a separate settlement of Mexico's foreign debt. Negotiations President Obreg√≥n. The Mexican government initially invited Lamont to discuss its finances in 1921. Lamont obtained approval to begin negotiations with the administration of President √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n from the State Department in June 1921. Lamont sent a letter with a quasi-ultimatum, stating that negotiations could not begin until Mexico had declared that Article 27 was not retroactive. The Mexican government ignored that but was not pressed by Lamont. Lamont negotiated in Mexico from October 5 to October 21, 1921. The initial negotiations were unsuccessful. Lamont did not accept a plan that required a depreciation of the debt. De la Huerta felt that Lamont's terms were too onerous and humiliating.Historical background There were a number of issues in the negotiations. The Mexican government insisted for any debt settlement to include a new loan, and Obreg√≥n argued that without new funds, Mexico would probably be unable to live up to any agreement. The ICBM said that no new loan would be granted without a debt agreement and official American recognition of Mexico. Negotiations resumed in January 1922 in New York City with Eduardo Iturbide, managing director of the Bank of Commerce and Industry of Mexico City, representing de la Huerta and the Mexican government. They failed to come to an agreement, and Iturbide was recalled on January 18, 1922. On March 3, 1922, the US State Department sent a message to the banking community, which effectively stopped any loans originating from the United States from non-members of the ICBM. In late May, de la Huerta was sent to the United States. =Agreement reached= Adolfo de la Huerta, July 18, 1922 A new round of talks began on June 2, and de la Huerta and Lamont signed the self-titled De la Huerta‚ÄìLamont Treaty at 6pm on June 16 at the offices of the Mexican Finance Commission at 120 Broadway, New York City. The signatures were attested by I. H. Pachin, the secretary of the ICBM. The tentative accord awaited ratification from Obreg√≥n. Initially, Obreg√≥n refused to ratify the agreement and stated that he was skeptical of the \\"good faith and sincerity\\" of the committee. Instead, he told de la Huerta to immediately open negotiations for a new loan. Lamont reminded de la Huerta that no loan was possible until the United States recognized the Obreg√≥n government. Realizing that recognition from the United States would not be forthcoming without a debt agreement, Obreg√≥n reluctantly signed the treaty on August 7, 1922. It was a surprise that he signed the treaty before he went on vacation because he had said that he would study it while on vacation. Hoeevyer, he was convinced of the urgency of signing it by de la Huerta. The Congress of Mexico ratified the treaty in September, and the agreement became effective on September 29, 1922.Merrill Rippy, Brill Archive, 1972, pg 120-122, https://books.google.com/books?id=mNIUAAAAIAAJ&pg;=PA120&lpg;=PA120&dq;=de+la+huerta+lamont+treaty&source;=bl&ots;=Kq6A2RshSf&sig;=rI- WQtJls_am5bfniMFneqfOwlw&hl;=en&ei;=vIwGTbOyHIPVnAeukbnlDQ&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&ct;=result&resnum;=2&ved;=0CB4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q;=de%20la%20huerta%20lamont%20treaty&f;=false Terms Mexican debt in 1922 The ICBM got nearly everything that it wanted in the treaty.The Mexican Revolution, 1910-1940 - Google Books Payments on the current interest on Mexican bonds was to start January 2, 1923, and back interest was going to be paid by January 1, 1928. The treaty dealt with all the external Mexican government debts, direct or guaranteed, the railroad debt, and some internal government debts largely held outside Mexico. The treaty consolidated Mexico's debts. The preamble of the treaty stated that the ICBM recognized the \\"difficulties with which Mexico has had to contend and the limitations upon her capacity for the immediate payment.\\" The country desired to co-operate \\"with the Mexican government in the solution of its problems and in the upbuilding of its credit.\\" In addition, the ICBM recommended ‚Äúbondholders make substantial adjustments of their rights.\\" Mexico agreed to set aside funds that would allow it to begin making full payments on its bonds in 1928. Mexico said it would commit $15 million to the fund in 1923 and to increase the amount that it was putting in the fund by $2.5 million each year. The money was to come from 10% of the gross revenue of Mexican railroads and an oil export tax. If that was too little, the difference was to be made up of bonds, which would not bear interest until 1928 and then would bear 3% after 1928, with a maturity date of 1943. Mexico agreed to make forty equal payments from 1928, which would pay off all the bonds by 1968. Also, Mexico agreed to privatize its railroads, but the government would still be in charge of the railroads' debt. The total debt covered by the agreement pre-interest was $507,457,000. The interest owed was around $280,000,000. The amount of direct debt held was 22.9% United States, 19.6% United Kingdom, and 32.4% France. The railroad debt was also mostly in foreign hands: 12.5% United States, 35.9% United Kingdom, and 36.4% France. There was no timeline set for privatizing the Mexican railroads. Aftermath The treaty had mixed effects. It was considered a brilliant success by some. The treaty represented a short term solution to others because of the heavy burden it imposed on government finances. De la Huerta's supporters tried to claim the treaty was a victory for Mexico. The treaty paved the way for the Bucareli Treaty between Mexico and the United States in 1923, which led to recognition of Obreg√≥n's government by the United States in August 1923. The repayment of the debt took money away from social reform. Mexico paid about $15 million in 1922 for the first annual deposit of the debt agreement. The ICBM lent $350,000, which Mexico lacked to complete the first payment and paid back a year later. Mexico also sent the ICBM $700,000 at the beginning of 1923, as part of the second payment, due in 1924. The treaty also led to de la Huerta's rebellion in 1923. The cost of putting down the rebellion, as well as the inability of Mexico to secure new loans, caused Mexico to go into default again.Mexico: an encyclopedia of ... - Google Books On June 30, 1924, Obreg√≥n ordered the suspension of further payment, which made it necessary for another adjustment of the foreign Mexican debt. That was done in the Pani-Lamont Amendment to the De la Huerta‚ÄìLamont Treaty, which reduced Mexico‚Äôs debt while the country kept its credit status.Contemporary M√©xico: papers of the ... - Google Books Mexico again defaulted on the agreement soon after the amendment was signed. Mexico made small payments on its debt from 1923 to 1927. Efforts to resolve the default continued throughout the 1930s. The Mexican oil expropriation eventually occurred in 1938. All of the Mexican rail system was nationalized between 1929 and 1937.

In 1915, around 120,000 Flexible Fliers were sold, and almost 2,000 Flexible Flyers were sold in one day. In 1968, Leisure Group of Los Angeles, California bought the S. L. Allen Company. Leisure Group continued to produce Flexible Flyers in Medina, Ohio. In 1973, a group of private investors bought Leisure Group's toy division and started manufacturing the sleds under the name \\"Blazon Flexible Flyer\\" in West Point, Mississippi. In 1993, Roadmaster purchased the rights to production and moved production to Olney, Illinois, and in 1998, production was moved to China. , Flexible Flyers are mostly made in China and some are made in South Paris, Maine by Paricon, Inc.

He was New York County District Attorney from 1930 to 1933. Biography Crain was born on May 25, 1860, on 14th Street, near the old Tammany Hall in Manhattan. He was the son of Dunham Jones Crain who was appointed U.S. Consul in Milan in 1877. Thomas Crain accompanied his father to Italy but returned in 1881, and began the study of law. He was admitted to the bar in New York City in 1884, and commenced practiced with Cockran & Clarke. Later he became a partner in Kenneson, Crain & Allen. In 1887, he became a member of the Tammany General Committee, representing the 7th Assembly District. In 1889, Mayor Hugh J. Grant appointed him as his private secretary, and in February 1890 as City Chamberlain to succeed Richard Croker who had resigned. He remained in office until May 1893, when Mayor Thomas Francis Gilroy appointed Joseph J. O'Donohue to the office. He was Tenement House Commissioner from 1904 to 1905 when he resigned following a dispute with Mayor George B. McClellan Jr. in the wake of a fire at 105 Allen Street that killed 18 people, mostly children. Fire officials said windows and fire escapes were blocked. Charges were made that the department had not properly inspected it although Crain said the records showed inspections twice a month. He was the presiding Judge in the 1911 trial of Triangle Shirtwaist Factory owners Max Blanck and Isaac Harris. He was a judge of the Court of General Sessions from 1906 to 1924. In 1914, his wife Agnes (Clarke) Crain died. In 1921, he was elected a sachem of the Tammany Society. In January 1924, he was appointed by Governor Al Smith to the New York Supreme Court (1st D.) to fill the vacancy caused by the election of Irving Lehman to the New York Court of Appeals. In November 1924, he was elected to succeed himself. In November 1929, he was elected New York County District Attorney. He convened a grand jury to look into the Arnold Rothstein murder and it adjourned saying it could not solve the case. In 1930, he convened a grand jury to investigate job buying Magistrate George F. Ewald. When the jury did not indict, Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt convened a jury and got an indictment. In 1930, he announced a war against rackets which produced few results. Charges were filed against him for general negligence, urging his removal. This was common procedure by Anti-Tammany reformers since the precedent of 1900 when Governor Theodore Roosevelt removed D.A. Asa Bird Gardiner. This time the charges were ultimately dismissed by Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt. After leaving the D.A.'s office at the end of his term in 1933, he became a New York Supreme Court referee. He died on May 29, 1942.

He is currently the head football coach at Liberty University. A successful high school football coach at Briarcrest Christian School in Memphis, Tennessee, Freeze coached Michael Oher and Greg Hardy. He subsequently served as the head football coach at Lambuth University from 2008 to 2009, Arkansas State University in 2011, and the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss) from 2012 to 2016. Under Freeze, the Ole Miss football program committed various recruiting and academic violations that figured in the NCAA's decision to expunge 27 of Freeze's wins and ban it from post-season play for two years. He resigned from Ole Miss after officials discovered that he had used a university cellphone to call escort services multiple times over the course of five years. Early life Freeze attended Senatobia High School and the University of Southern Mississippi, from which he graduated in 1992 with a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics and a minor in coaching and sports administration.Hugh Freeze Bio, Arkansas State University, retrieved December 16, 2010. Coaching career =Briarcrest Christian School= In 1992, Freeze joined the staff at Briarcrest Christian School in Memphis, Tennessee, as the football team's offensive coordinator and defensive backs coach. Freeze also served as dean of students. In 1995, he was promoted to head coach. Freeze ran the no-huddle spread offense and led his team to the state championship twice, in 2002 and 2004, and the regional championship each year from 1995 to 1998 and in 2001 and 2002. He received Region 8-AA Coach of the Year honors five times and Associated Press Coach of the Year honors six times. In ten years at Briarcrest, Freeze was 94‚Äì30 as head coach (.785 winning percentage) and 126‚Äì37 overall. Freeze was depicted in the book and motion picture The Blind Side, about one of his former players, current free agent offensive tackle Michael Oher.Oher's HS Coach Gets Top Job at Arkansas State, NBC Sports, December 2, 2010. While at Briarcrest Christian School, Freeze also coached the girls basketball team from 1992 to 2004, and actually had more success in this role, with an overall record of 305‚Äì63 (.829 winning percentage), seven straight championship appearances, and four championships. Following his dismissal from Ole Miss in 2017, some former students alleged that Freeze had engaged in inappropriate conduct with female students while at Briarcrest. Freeze has denied the allegations. Briarcrest officials said they were unaware of any sexual improprieties committed by Freeze during his tenure. =Ole Miss assistant coach= In 2005, the University of Mississippi hired Freeze as an assistant athletic director for football external affairs. The following season, he became the tight ends coach and recruiting coordinator, positions he held through 2007. After that season, he replaced head coach Ed Orgeron on an interim basis before the hiring of Houston Nutt. Freeze interviewed for the offensive coordinator position with Nutt, a position that eventually went to Kent Austin. =Lambuth= In January 2008, Lambuth University, a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), named Freeze its head coach.Hugh Freeze Named Lambuth University Head Football Coach, Lambuth University, January 19, 2008.

During the press conference to introduce Freeze as the head coach, he stated that he wanted to \\"retire at Ole Miss.\\" He was signed to a four-year contract with an annual salary of $1.5 million plus incentives up to $2.5 million. In his first season at Ole Miss, Freeze led the Rebels to a 6‚Äì6 record in the regular season, making Ole Miss bowl eligible for the first time since 2009 with a 41‚Äì24 victory over Mississippi State in the Egg Bowl. His Rebels accepted a bid to play in the BBVA Compass Bowl in Birmingham, Alabama, on January 5, 2013. They beat the University of Pittsburgh 38‚Äì17 to finish 7‚Äì6. Freeze received national attention on National Signing Day 2013 as Ole Miss brought in the fifth ranked recruiting class in the country. Freeze won the 2014 Grant Teaff Coach of the Year award by the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. During Freeze's third season at Ole Miss, he led the Rebels to a 7‚Äì0 start, the program's best start since the Johnny Vaught era. By October, they had risen as high as third in the nation, their highest ranking at that late stage in the season in almost half a century. They ultimately finished 9‚Äì3, only the third time since Vaught's tenure that Ole Miss has won that many games in the regular season. That netted them an appearance in the 2014 Peach Bowl: their first major bowl appearance since the 1970 Sugar Bowl, and the biggest since Vaught's tenure. On September 19, 2015, Freeze's Rebels beat Alabama, 43‚Äì37, in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, making Freeze only the third head coach, along with Les Miles and Steve Spurrier, to defeat a Nick Saban-coached team in back-to- back years (Michigan's Lloyd Carr beat Saban's Michigan State Spartans in three consecutive years, '96‚Äì'98). The victory catapulted the Rebels to No. 3 in the AP rankings. They went on to tally their second straight nine-win season, and garnered a berth in the 2016 Sugar Bowl, where they won 48‚Äì20 over Oklahoma State. They finished ninth in the AP Poll and 10th in the Coaches' Poll‚Äîtheir first top-10 finishes in a final poll since 1969. It was also only the Rebels' third 10-win season since the Vaught era.  Scandals and resignation  In January 2016, the NCAA charged Ole Miss with numerous recruiting violations. An investigation turned up evidence that Ole Miss employees and boosters arranged numerous \\"impermissible benefits\\" for players, such as car loans and cash. At least one recruit was suspected of getting help on his college entrance exam. The investigation reopened soon after star offensive tackle Laremy Tunsil admitted taking money from one of Freeze's assistants. In February 2017‚Äîthree months after suffering its first losing season since the year Freeze arrived‚ÄîOle Miss withdrew from bowl consideration for the upcoming season. The move came on the same day that the NCAA sent an updated notice of allegations charging the Rebels with eight additional violations. Most seriously, it accused Freeze of not monitoring his assistants, and also accused Ole Miss of not properly controlling the program. On July 13, 2017, Freeze's predecessor, Houston Nutt, sued Ole Miss for defamation, contending that Freeze and school officials falsely blamed him for the violations. As part of discovery for the lawsuit, Nutt's attorneys filed a Freedom of Information Act request for calls Freeze made on his university- issued cell phone during January 2016. Nutt's attorneys contended that Freeze and others at Ole Miss leaked information to the press as part of an effort to smear their client. While reviewing those records, Nutt's attorneys discovered a call to a number associated with a female escort service, and alerted Ole Miss officials about it. Freeze claimed it was a misdialed number. School officials investigated, and discovered what they later described as \\"a concerning pattern\\" of similar calls dating back to shortly after he arrived in Oxford. On July 20, chancellor Jeff Vitter and athletic director Ross Bjork gave Freeze an ultimatum: resign or be fired for violating the morals clause of his contract. Freeze opted to resign; offensive coordinator Matt Luke was named interim coach. In February 2019, the NCAA punished the Ole Miss football team for the recruiting and academic violations committed under both Nutt and Freeze. The punishments included a two-year postseason ban, three years of probation, and a four-year ban on some scholarships. As well, the NCAA forced Ole Miss to vacate 33 wins from 2010 to 2016. As a result, 27 of Freeze's wins were stripped from the books; only the 2015 season was unaffected. His record at Ole Miss is now officially 12‚Äì15; it was 39‚Äì25 on the field. =Liberty= On October 11, 2018, Freeze was offered a job as offensive coordinator of the Arizona Hotshots of the Alliance of American Football league; he turned it down. Freeze was named head coach of the Liberty Flames football team on December 7, 2018. In his first year with the team, the Liberty Flames played to a 7-5 record, qualified for bowl games for the first time in school history, and accepted an invitation to the Cure Bowl in Orlando, Florida. On December 10, 2019, Freeze signed a 5-year extension with Liberty.

Many of her short stories and poems have been anthologised in collections by leading publishers, including Oxford University Press and Macmillan. Her initial novel, Private ‚Äì Keep Out, was shortlisted for both the Carnegie Medal and The Other Award, and she has since been the recipient of a number of additional awards and shortlisted for others. She was also the subject of a documentary by Thames TV and her works have been featured on BBC and ITV segments. In addition to her contributions as a writer, Gwen Grant has also done important outreach work in schools, stimulating interest in reading and creative writing in children by leading individually crafted classes and seminars. She also coaches aspiring new writers, serving as a respected guide and editor of their beginning efforts. Biography Gwendoline Ellen Rewston was born in Worksop, Nottinghamshire in 1940, in the early days of World War II. At the time, the town's economy was based almost entirely on the fortunes and misfortunes of the coal mining industry. Gwen, the fourth of six children, was the daughter of George Rewston, a general labourer and miner, and his wife, Alice (n√©e Hall), a homemaker. Her early life and experiences were strongly impacted by the poverty of a miner's family and what she heard and observed of the dangerous working conditions of the \\"pit\\", as the mines were commonly known, and by the deprivations and strains of the war. Despite that, her parents taught her that there was opportunity for everyone. For an anthology of women's writing published in the United States, she wrote, Gwendoline Rewston married Ian Grant and is known personally and professionally as Gwen Grant. She became the mother of twin sons, and is now a grandmother and great-grandmother. In 1975, she earned a Bachelor of Arts in Humanities from The Open University and in the same year, began her writing career. Her first picture book, Matthew and His Magic Kite, was published in 1977. In 1978, she published Private ‚Äì Keep Out and followed up with Knock and Wait. Her output since has been prodigious and she continues her work today. In 2010, she contributed a story to Stories for Haiti, an anthology published as a charitable project to help bring relief to the victims of the destructive earthquake there.

History Captain Martel, Escaping the Scarborough, from the Pirates of the Spanish Main series (N19) for Allen & Ginter Cigarettes MET DP835012 Martel began his career as a privateer during the War of Spanish Succession, turning to piracy after the Treaty of Utrecht ended the war. By September 1716 he was active off Jamaica taking several ships with his 8-gun, 80-man sloop. He soon traded up to larger ships, keeping the best for his growing fleet. He forced a number of captured sailors to serve on his ships but let most of his captives go.Johnson alone claims that Martel was deposed by his crew for excessive cruelty, replaced by a Captain Kennedy, and placed aboard a prize ship with a few loyal followers. At one point he swapped with the master of a captured ship, taking his vessel but giving him a prize ship in trade and setting him free. With his new 22-gun, 100-man flagship and four other vessels he put into St. Croix in late 1716 to resupply and careen. Jamaican officials were tipped off to his location and dispatched the warship HMS Scarborough under Francis Hume to hunt him down. Hume found Martel's flotilla in January 1717. After sinking one of the pirate sloops and demolishing the shore batteries they had set up, Hume anchored offshore. Martel tried making a run for it in his flagship but ran aground in the attempt. He ordered the ship burned (with some captured slaves still aboard) and fled to a captured sloop, in which he and a few of his crew made their getaway. The remainder of his crew hid on the island as Hume looted and hauled away the remaining ships. Later that month Samuel Bellamy and his partner Paulsgrave Williams put into St. Croix to repair and resupply when they were hailed by sailors from ashore. They were the remainder of Martel's crew and soon joined Bellamy, who sailed away before HMS Scarborough could return. Blackbeard is often cited as having fought Scarborough, though Royal Navy logs never mention such an incident; it is generally believed that later writers conflated Blackbeard's close encounter with HMS Seaford and Martel's fight against Scarborough. Hume was rewarded for the action against Martel and others with command of the much larger warship HMS Bedford. Martel himself disappears after escaping Hume; some sources claim he accepted King George I's general pardon offered in late 1717 to all pirates who surrendered within a year.

Charles I of Sicily was defeated, and his entire invasion failed. The battle was also the end of the Astigiani participation in the wars of the Guelphs and Ghibellines, and the end of Charles' intervention in the rest of the Italian Peninsula.  Background  Charles I of Sicily had landed in Piedmont to challenge the commune of Asti, who defeated Thomas II of Savoy's army at the Battle of Montebruno and subsequently moved at the conquest of Asti. Charles defeated a coalition of Ghibellines at the Battle of Cassano in 1259, and he was determined to bring down the Astigiani forces that remained. He found an Astigiani force waiting for him at Roccavione, in what is now the province of Cuneo.  Battle  Asti had made allies with the Marquess of Montferrat, William VII. He was to lead the army, and his men awaited the Neapolitan army. When the two sides met, the Neapolitans were destroyed. Charles I's campaign in Piedmont, and Italy in general, had failed. He would not set foot in Piedmont again after he left back for Naples.  Aftermath  After the failed invasion of Piedmont by Charles I, there would be no more war in Asti. However, there were more troubles. Inner struggles for the control of trading and bank enterprises soon divided the city into factions. The most prominent was that of the powerful bankers of the Solaro family, who, in 1314, gave the city to King Robert of Naples. The free Republic of Asti ceased to exist. In 1339 the Ghibelline exiles recaptured the city, expelling the Solaro and their helpers. In 1342 however, the menace of the Solaro counter-offensive led the new rulers to submit to Luchino Visconti of Milan. Visconti built a citadel and a second ring of walls to protect the new burgs of the city. In 1345, in the Battle of Gamenario, the Ghibelline Astigiani and John II of Montferrat again defeated the Angevine Neapolitan troops. John also ruled over Asti until 1372, but seven years later the city council submitted to Galeazzo II Visconti's authority. The latter in turn assigned it to Louis of Valois, Duke of Orl√©ans.

Biography Igor Borisovich Berezovsky was born on 8 September 1942 in Omsk, during evacuation. He was the third child out of six. Since early childhood he liked to draw and make photos. He had always wanted to study‚Äîin an art school, an art institute. However, he hadn't managed to get a formal education. Since the age of 15 he started to work, spent three years serving in the Russian army in the Far East. His life as an artist was decided upon, when he joined the All-Union Institute for Technical Esthetics in 1967. Other employees in the Institute included philosophers Georgy Shchedrovitsky and Oleg Genisaretsky, design and architecture scholar Alexandr Yermolaev, art scholar Vladimir Paperny, saxophone player Alexei Kozlov. Elena Vsevolodovna Chernevich, and outstanding graphic design scholar and historian, played an important role in Igor Berezovsky's life and art. Designer scene at the end of sixties and the beginning of seventies was fueled with a passionate interest towards Western pop and conceptual art. Berezovsky majored in graphic design. He not only received outstanding designer education, but also acquired a clear understanding of modern art. 1973 is the year, when he began free artistic work. His early works already demonstrate the artistic principles, which are to become his main features. A documentary-like, expressive picture. Free, expressive color. A lot of experimentation, much randomness, mistakes. Here is the paradox: everything starts with a photo‚Äîthis is important, but only the photos made by the author \\"from within\\"‚Äîthe transformation of the photo yields a creative result. The artist's individual manner fully matures in his still life pictures: early, simple and frankly daring. (1978‚Äì1979). In 1976 Berezovsky leaves his job at the Institute and becomes a freelance artist. In 1979 he becomes a member of the Artists' Union of the USSR. In the next year he enjoys his first personal exhibition and the Graphic Arts Complex. He earns his living by designing exhibitions (graphics, posters, catalogues), working together with such exhibition design gurus as M. Konik, E. Bogdanov, S. Chermensky. Some of his major works are: design of the national exhibition \\"Artists for the People\\", CHA, 1982; \\"Mayakovsky and Khlebnikov\\", Mayakovsky Museum, 1985; modern Soviet art exhibition \\"New Reality\\", Ravenna, 1989; exhibition \\"An Artist and Traditional Art\\", CHA, 1990. All his life Berezovsky has been working with outer forms, and only with them. His artistic thinking avoids literature, not inclined towards symbolism, doesn't employ implications and underlying messages. He has always aimed to articulate modern vision. He was interested in the texture of TV images (\\"TV Parallels\\", 1974‚Äì77); reproduced photos from magazines and, using large dot patterns, almost eliminated them (\\"Reproacts\\", 1981); employed original textures using \\"stuff\\" at hand; paraphrased Jean-Michel Folon and Dibbets, Warhol and D√ºrer. He used quotation techniques long before the emergence of talks about postmodernism in this country.

Upon his retirement from American Express in 1980, Waters was bestowed with the title, \\"Father of the American Express Card\\".Books.google.com Early career George Waters graduated from Indiana University in 1938 and was hired by IBM in its sales and marketing program. During World War II, he joined the US Army Air Forces where he served as Deputy Chief of Staff in the Office of Statistical Control. During the war, Waters led a team that used some of the earliest computers to keep track of planes, the weather and results of combat missions. Many noted postwar executives came out of the Office of Statistical Command, including Robert S. McNamara and others who became known as the Whiz Kids. After the war, Waters served as the President of the Massachusetts Steamship Authority, a ferry service between Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket. Waters eventually sold the business to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. He went on to become an Executive Vice President in charge of marketing at Colonial Stores, an Atlanta-based supermarket chain. American Express American Express entered the credit card industry in 1958 with its own product, a purple charge card for travel and entertainment expenses. By the time Waters was hired in 1961, The American Express Card was number two in the industry behind Diners Club, still unprofitable, and management was unsure about what to do with the business. They considered merging with Diners Club and also forming a joint venture with Hilton Hotels. The card at that time was primarily accepted in restaurants, as hotels, car rental companies and airlines were either reluctant to accept credit cards or issued their own cards. Soon after his arrival in 1961, Waters recognized several problems. The division had grown so fast that internal controls for monitoring card activity and service establishment payments were weak. Too many card members were not paying their bills on time, and the company was not charging enough relative to the services that it was providing to card members and service establishments. Waters' plan for reviving the business was based on positioning the card as a product that was not for everyone. He teamed up with mathematicians at MIT to develop algorithms to track card spending activity that avoided the need for credit limits and allowed card members to establish their own responsible spending patterns. Drawing on his Air Force computer experience, he installed a data processing system that kept track of card activity and improved accounting controls. Next, he terminated card members who were not paying their bills on time ‚Äì approximately one third of the card base. He then raised the annual card fee to $8.00 from $6.00 and raised the discount rate - the percentage of the sale that the service establishments had to pay American Express ‚Äì from 3% to 7%. To make the discount rate more palatable to merchants, Waters drew upon his supermarket marketing experience by partnering with merchants in a cooperating advertising program. Waters proposed to give back .5% of all charge card volume to merchants to fund cooperative ads that helped service establishments advertise their products, accompanied by the little blue box Amex logo at the bottom of the advertisement. The strategy soon worked. On the strength of its advertising and growing list of participating businesses, The American Express Card became profitable by 1962 and in 1964, American Express saw its volume of charged sales surpass Diners Club. There was still more work to be done. The card was still not widely accepted by airlines and hotels. But Waters soon convinced American Airlines to drop its card and accept the American Express Card. Soon afterwards, all other major airlines followed. Next, Waters negotiated an exclusive arrangement with the American Hotel Association and soon thereafter, the card became broadly accepted at hotels in Europe and throughout the world. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Waters went on to build the brand and expand the franchise globally. He and American Express CEO James D. Robinson commissioned Andrew Kershaw at Ogilvy and Mather to come up with an advertising tag line for the business. Ogilvy came back with the highly successful slogans \\"Do You Know Me\\" and \\"Don't leave home without it\\". By the time Waters stepped down as Executive Vice President and President of Travel Related Services in 1978, the American Express Card was accepted worldwide at every major travel establishment. The card had 9.5 million members, was generating close $1 billion in revenue, and accounted for the largest share of the company‚Äôs net income. Still today, the American Express Card remains one of the most recognizable global brand names and the leading profit center for the company.

It is a sequel to the 2009 film Offspring. The film stars Pollyanna McIntosh, Angela Bettis, Sean Bridgers, Lauren Ashley Carter, Carlee Baker, and Alexa Marcigliano, and introduces Zach Rand and Shyla Molhusen. In 2019, McIntosh has directed a sequel titled Darlin'. The film was released as part of the Bloody Disgusting Selects line. Plot A feral woman circles what appears to be her child. A wolf, apparently tamed by the feral woman, circles the infant as well, but does it no harm. Although it is not referenced in the film, the woman is the last remaining member of a cannibalistic tribe that has roamed the northeast coast for decades (as seen in the 2009 film Offspring). Chris Cleek, a country lawyer, sits at a local barbecue with his family. His oldest daughter, Peggy, sits off to the side, upset. His only son, Brian, watches as a couple of boys abuse and push a small girl into a corner and makes no effort to save her. While out hunting, Chris happens upon the woman, who is bathing. He returns with a net in an effort to capture her. He knocks her out and returns home with her, restrains her in a cellar, and directs his family to participate in \\"civilizing\\" her. Over the following days, the family is revealed to be dysfunctional. Brian enjoys causing pain to others. Peggy is withdrawn and afraid of her father, who gives the appearance of a smart, charming man. Chris's first attempt to approach the woman results in her biting off and eating his ring finger. Chris and his wife, Belle, argue, and the youngest daughter, Darlin', attempts to befriend the imprisoned woman. Chris's will prevails and he orchestrates a violent series of civilizing measures. Chris bathes the woman with boiling water and later decides to bathe her with a high-pressure power washer, causing her extreme pain. Belle watches in horror, but Peggy rushes to the woman's aid and turns off the washer. Peggy is forced into the house, while Belle and Chris move the woman back into the cellar. Later, Chris rapes the woman while Brian secretly observes. The next day, Brian also violates the woman and is caught by Peggy. Belle, unable to stand it anymore, announces her intention to leave Chris and take their two daughters, but not their rapist son. Chris knocks Belle unconscious just before Peggy's teacher, Ms. Raton, rings the doorbell. Ms. Raton tells Chris that she believes Peggy is pregnant. He becomes angry, believing that she will somehow expose the family's secret, and knocks her unconscious. He and Brian tie her hands and drag her to the barn where he keeps German shepherds. Peggy protests, but Chris subjects her to a vicious verbal assault. In the barn, Chris and Brian lock Ms. Raton in the dog's cage. The cage is shown to also contain an eyeless girl named \\"Socket\\", the Cleek's other daughter, who behaves like the two dogs. Ms. Raton revives and tries to escape, but Socket and the dogs kill and eat her. Peggy releases the imprisoned woman from the cellar. The woman attacks and kills Belle, gnawing off most of her face. Taking a lawnmower blade, she then kills Brian, severing his torso, and rips Chris's heart out and eats it. A terrified Peggy attempts to escape with her little sister. The woman does not attack the girls. Instead, she takes Darlin' and they walk away from the house together, along with Socket acting as a dog, apparently forming a new family. Peggy, reluctant at first, follows the new family at a distance as the screen cuts to black.

He sat in the House of Commons from 1895 to 1905 as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Peterborough. Early life Purvis was born in Roxburghshire, the third son of Joseph Purvis. The family moved to Hexham when Purvis was small.1851 England Census He was educated at Marlborough and at Downing College, Cambridge, where he graduated with a BA in 1880, an MA and LL.M in 1875, and as a Doctor of law (LL.D) in 1881. Career He was called to the bar in 1873 at the Inner Temple, and practised on the North Eastern Circuit. At the 1885 general election he unsuccessfully contested the Abingdon division of Berkshire as a Liberal Party candidate. When the Liberals split over Home Rule for Ireland, they took the Unionist side, and at the 1886 election he stood as a Liberal Unionist in Edinburgh South, but lost to William Ewart Gladstone's ally and former minister, Hugh Childers, who had been defeated in his previous district the previous December.Craig, page 485 Purvis then contested the Peterborough by-election in October 1899, but lost to the Liberal candidate Alpheus Morton.Craig, page 169The Constitutional Year Book, 1904, published by Conservative Central Office, page 172 (196 in web page) The election was fought largely on the issue of Home Rule, which Purvis asserted was opposed to the true principles of democracy, because if Ireland got Home Rule because its people wanted it, then they would also have to get separation if they demanded it. (The report in The Times did not explain why Purvis considered separation to be opposed to democracy). He contested the seat again in 1892, cutting Morton's majority to 158 votes (4% of the total), down from 251 votes (7%)in 1889. Purvis won Peterborough on his third attempt, when he defeated Morton at the 1895 general election. Morton had hoped to contest the seat again in 1900, but the local Liberals declined to nominate him again, and Purvis was re-elected with a reduced majority over the Liberal candidate Halley Stewart. In 1903 he supported Joseph Chamberlain's policy of Imperial Preference, a proposed system of reciprocally-levelled tariffs or free trade agreements between different Dominions and Colonies within the British Empire which had caused a division in Unionist ranks. He was knighted in 1905, in the King's Birthday Honours, but lost his seat at the 1906 general election to the Liberal Granville Greenwood, who won by a large majority of 1,159 votes (21% of the total). Purvis continued as an active Liberal Unionist, and in December 1908 he was one of several speaker at a mass meeting on tariff reform held in Stamford. He contested Peterborough again at the January 1910 general election, but even before Parliament was dissolved on 10 January, The Times was pessimistic about his chances. The Liberal majority in 1906 was \\"decisive\\", and Greenwood had the support of most of Peterborough's railway and engineering workers made up a large proportion of the electorate. When the votes were counted, Greenwood had held the seat, although with a more modest majority of 43 votes (7%). In 1914, he supported calls by Unionist MP Jesse Collings for tenant farmers to become owner-occupiers of their lands. He saw it as an alternative to encouraging he emigration of young men to take up land grants in the colonies, and as a bulwark against radical Liberal proposals to nationalise the land. Family In 1874 Purvis married Elizabeth Marion Peat, eldest daughter of William Henry Peat, a merchant from London.

Born and raised in the Soviet Union, he trained in Leningrad and performed with the Kirov from 1964 to 1972. He and his second wife Galina, who was a ballerina at the Kirov, came to international attention in 1972 when they applied for exit visas to emigrate to Israel, which they were given in 1974. Panov worked with the Berlin Opera Ballet, as well as companies in other western European and North American countries, during the late 1970s and 1980s. He formed the Ashdod Art Centre in Israel, in 1993, and five years later founded the Panov Ballet Theatre, also in Ashdod. Early career Valery Panov was born in Vitebsk, Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (present-day Vitebsk, Belarus) in 1938. He studied at the Vaganova School in Leningrad, which is the present-day Academy of Russian Ballet, St. Petersburg. Panov attended the Moscow and Leningrad Ballet Schools, graduating from the latter in 1957. He danced with the Maly Ballet in Leningrad (1957‚Äì64), where he created roles in Lopukhov's Ballad of Love (1959), in Davitashvili's Daphnis et Chloe (1960) and Bolero (1960), and in Boyarsky's Petrushka (1961), Orpheus (title role, 1962), and The Lady and the Hooligan (1962).

The Panovs were expelled from the Kirov, imprisoned briefly and forbidden from taking class for two years. Artists in the West (including Laurence Olivier) appealed to the authorities on their behalf. Finally, in 1974, the Panovs were allowed to leave Russia. They settled in Israel, making frequent guest appearances abroad as a couple. In Israel, the Panovs danced with the Bathsheva and Bat-Dor dance companies from 1974 to 1977. Choreographer Panov was guest choreographer and principal dancer with the Berlin Opera Ballet between 1977 and 1983. There he choreographed several ballets, including Cinderella, The Rite of Spring, The Idiot, and War and Peace.

With a construction history dating to the early 18th century, it is one of the town's oldest buildings, and is historically associated with George Washington, who stopped here for a meal in 1789. Now a private residence, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The former Brigham's Tavern is located in far northeastern Coventry, at the northeast corner of Boston Turnpike (United States Route 44) and Brigham Tavern Road, a short distance west of the town line with Mansfield. It is a clapboarded two-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. The main facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance flanked by simple moulded corner boards and topped by a four-light transom and cornice. Two large additions extend from the rear and left of the main block. The left ell has an entrance similar in style to the main entrance. These three sections of the house are all of 18th century origin, with the rear addition believed to be the oldest part, dating to c. 1717. An 18th-century barn stands at the rear of the property. The tavern had a long history, serving travellers on the turnpike between Hartford and Boston. Uriah Brigham is the first documented resident of the property, believed to have occupied what is now the rear ell of the main block. His son Gershom is credited with building the main block in 1778, having gained official sanction to operate a tavern from the town. The building was clearly purpose-built as a tavern, with a second-floor ballroom and a first-floor taproom, although the bar elements of the latter have been lost. The tavern played host to George Washington in 1789 for breakfast, after he spent the night at a residence in Mansfield. and See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Tolland County, Connecticut References National Register of Historic Places in Tolland County, Connecticut Buildings and structures in Tolland County, Connecticut Coventry, Connecticut Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut Houses in Tolland County, Connecticut ","title":"Brigham's Tavern"},{"id":"30083275","text":"Botany is a monthly peer-reviewed scientific journal that has been published since 1951 by NRC Research Press.

Hilbert Morton Shelly Hilbert (January 3, 1917 ‚Äì December 24, 1998) was a professor of public health, environmentalist, and co-founder of Earth Day that was first celebrated on April 22, 1970. He is best known for developing public sanitation systems and sanitary public healthcare facilities throughout the United States, Europe, U.S. Virgin Islands, and developing nations. As a dedicated and determined public health professional, Morton S. Hilbert worked towards the promotion and protection of environmental health. With the U.S. Public Health Service, Hilbert organized the Human Ecology Symposium in 1968. This forum helped to inform students about grave threats to environmental health in the 1960s and 1970s, and ultimately it inspired them to take action. In 1970 their efforts, along with a federal proclamation from U.S. Senator Gaylord Nelson, culminated in the observance of the first Earth Day. Education In 1940, Hilbert graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a bachelor's degree in civil engineering and began his career as a public health official and field engineer in Michigan. He then enrolled in the University of Michigan School of Public Health, and in 1946 received his master's degree in Public Health.  Career  = Environmental health = For 18 years he was director of the Environmental Health Department for Wayne County in the Detroit, Michigan area. In 1954, he helped to relocate 1 million refugees in Vietnam. In 1961, he returned to the University of Michigan as associate professor of environmental health. In 1968, Hilbert was appointed chairman of Environmental Health for the University of Michigan School of Public Health. The department eventually became Environmental and Industrial Health, and Hilbert was the first chairman. From 1962-1969, he was the chairman of the board of the American Public Health Association. His reports address a range of environmental health issues such as care of laboratory animals, air pollution, and sanitation in hospitals. In 1968, he served as a member of President Richard Nixon's Task Force on Urban Problems. =Earth Day beginnings= In 1968, Hilbert and the U.S. Public Health Service organized the Human Ecology Symposium, an environmental conference for students to hear from scientists about the effects of environmental degradation on human health. For the next two years, Hilbert and students worked to plan the first Earth Day. Professor Hilbert worked with graduate students nationwide to develop increased interest and awareness about environmental issues. As a result of his efforts, the first \\"Earth Day\\" demonstration in the U.S. took place on The University of Michigan campus in March 1970, which was followed by similar events across the country. In the spring of 1970‚Äîalong with a federal proclamation from U.S. Sen. Gaylord Nelson‚Äîthe first Earth Day was held nationwide. = American Public Health Association = thumb In 1975-76, Hilbert served as the first elected president of the American Public Health Association (APHA). He was elected president in 1976, and focused his tenure on promoting the importance of prevention, rather than corrective action, in managing environmental health. https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.66.1.99 = Research = Spanning the several decades of his career, he authored numerous articles on sanitation, disease prevention, housing, and the environment. Through his consulting business, Hilbert worked in many different locations including the Virgin Islands, Thailand, Egypt, and Malaysia.  Personal life  After retiring from the University of Michigan in 1986, Hilbert and his family moved to Brussels, Belgium, where Hilbert was director of the European Office of the National Sanitation Foundation. In 1992, he and his family moved to Bellevue, Washington. = Legacy = Hilbert is remembered by students, colleagues, and especially his family, who continue to honor his legacy. In 2008, his wife Stephanie Hilbert, Daughters Barbara Kaier and Major Kathi Murray, (Ret.) and son Stephen Hilbert, were honored guests of the Dalai Lama at the Earth Day celebration in Ann Arbor. In 2010, Stephen was keynote speaker celebrating Earth Day at Cascadia College in Bothell, Washington. Morton Hilbert's work can be viewed at the Bentley Historical Library at the University of Michigan. He is referenced in the history of conservation and environmentalism movements in Michigan. Recently, some have called for an increased awareness of Hilbert's role in the founding of Earth Day.

Background The show, co-produced by TV JOJ and TV Barrandov, premiered on 1 September 2009 and ended on 16 December 2010. Synopsis The show is set in a women's prison. The main character is Eva Koll√°rov√° (Zuzana Maurery), who, fleeing her husband, kills another driver while under the influence of alcohol, and almost causes the death of her own son, who ends up in a coma. She is sentenced to three years in a medium- security prison. Eva adapts to her new environment while trying not to lose her dignity. First season The first season reveals that the person Eva killed in the accident was actually hired by her husband to kill her in order to receive a life insurance settlement. Eva's lawyer tries to obtain a retrial for her. Meanwhile, Eva is accused and eventually convicted of killing a fellow inmate, who died of a drug overdose. This increases the length of her overall sentence. Second season In the second season, Eva gradually adapts to her new living condition. The inmate who caused the drug overdose she was previously convicted of comes clean, Eva is exonerated, and gets a chance at parole. She is allowed a one-day release from prison and becomes pregnant with her lawyer, with whom she has become close. Third season Eva's pregnancy is the major theme of the third and last season of Ods√∫den√©. She tries to keep her condition a secret for as long as possible. However, during a fight in the showers, the truth is revealed and an investigation begins to reveal the child's father, as the prison guards fall under suspicion. Eva tries to protect her lawyer, who is at risk of losing his bar license. The prison warden eventually finds out the truth, however, and Eva's lawyer is disbarred. Eva gives birth to a healthy daughter and her sentence is suspended for twelve months. Her probation officer eventually proposes a complete pardon, which is granted in the end.

Illinois, 493 U.S. 307 (1990), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court forbade the admission of evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment for the use of impeaching statements made by a defense witness. Background On August 30, 1982 a group of eight boys was confronted by another group of boys who demanded money. The group of eight refused and was fired upon, resulting in the death of one boy and injury to another. After police arrived on the scene the group of eight acted as witnesses by recounting their experience to the police. Darryl James was eventually brought into custody as a suspect. He was arrested in his mother's beauty salon. The police questioned him about his hair color to which he responded that although his hair was currently black and curly it had previously been reddish-brown and slicked back. After arriving at the police station James was again questioned and he then told police he changed his hair color to alter his appearance. James was eventually indicted for murder and attempted murder. James attempted to suppress the statements he had previously made about his hair as being \\"fruit of the poisonous tree\\" obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment, as there had been no probable cause for his arrest. =Lower courts= At trial the state's witnesses testified that the shooter had reddish hair that was slicked back. Each witness also identified James from weeks prior where they admitted he met the description, although one witness, Henderson, said James' hair was black on that day. Although James objected to the testimony, the trial court allowed James' statements regarding his hair to impeach Henderson, and James was subsequently convicted. The Illinois Appellate Court reversed the conviction, holding that James' statements should have been suppressed as \\"fruit of the poisonous tree\\", even to impeach Henderson. The Illinois Supreme Court reversed this decision, holding that there was no Fourth Amendment violation and thereby reinstating the murder conviction. Opinion of the Court Justice Brennan delivered the opinion of the Court in a 5-4 decision in favor of James, reversing both his conviction and the decision of the Illinois Supreme Court. He noted that James' statements could not be used in a court of law and that the Illinois Supreme Court \\"wrongly expanded the practice\\" of illegally obtaining evidence to impeach a defendant's own testimony. Justice Brennan noted that this expansion \\"would frustrate rather than further the purposes underlying the exclusionary rule.\\".

The listing encompasses ten historically significant houses, clustered near the site of the former Coventry Glass Factory, in a linear district along what was the Boston Turnpike, now U.S. Route 44. The Skungamaug River is a creek cutting through the district. The glassworks operated here between 1813 and about 1845, and most of these houses date to that time, exhibiting largely vernacular Federal and Greek Revival styles. The most sophisticated and best-preserved house is that of Nathaniel Root, at 1044 Boston Turnpike. The ground in the area of the glassworks (of which no structures survive) is littered with melted glass fragments and burnt brick fragments. and The Coventry Glassworks was established in 1813, in part to meet demand for glass objects that had previously been fulfilled by English companies, a source cut off by the War of 1812. The glassworks founders included experienced glassblowers and local businessmen, who combined their capital and expertise. The company produced small bottles, inkstands, and flasks, and is credited with creating the first \\"portrait flask\\", bearing a depiction of the Marquis de Lafayette in commemoration of his 1825 visit to the United States. The company had a rotating cast of partners and glassblowers, and remained in operation until about 1845, when its proprietors at that time moved the business to Willington. Most of the houses in this area were built by or for either the proprietors, or the workers they hired.

All that Prince Peter would acknowledge took place at the meeting was a request from him for the Austrians to stop the bombardment of towns by their aeroplanes, and that he was acting on instruction from his father. However a number of arrangements also took place, these included supplying the Austrians with Serbian national sandals, so that they climb the rocks more easily; and giving a verbal, then written order to his two brigadiers that they must not resist the Austrians and allow them to capture Lovƒáen.Baerlein, Henry.

Youngstown Vindicator, 25 January 1916King Nicholas leaves for France. Evening Post, 24 January 1916 Exile and marriage In the Autumn of 1918 while still in exile in France, Prince Peter met a married woman named Violette Brunet, (otherwise Violet Brunetta d'Usseaux) whose husband (Italian nobleman Sergio Brunetta d'Usseaux) was in the service of his father, King Nicholas I of Montenegro. Having fallen in love and wishing to marry her, Prince Peter wrote to his father instructing him to arrange the marriage. When his father objected, Prince Peter tried to blackmail his father, threatening to reveal damaging secrets about the surrender of Lovƒáen. In any case, Prince Peter's father died in 1921. With the end of the First World War, Prince Peter and the Montenegrin Royal Family were exiled and denied the chance to return to their kingdom when the Podgorica Assembly chose to unite Montenegro with the other Slavic lands as part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Prince Peter with this tutor Charles Piguet (ca. 1900) It was reputedly at the bedside of a dying friend, that Prince Peter met the London-born music hall performer Violet Emily Wegner, daughter of William Wegner, a police detective, and his wife, Arabella Eliza Darby. Violet had married Count Sergio Brunetta d'Usseaux in London in 1912. D'Ussueaux was the son of Comte Eugenio Brunetta d'Usseaux who had been the Secretary General of the Olympic Committee responsible for reviving the games and administering the 1908 London Olympic Games. Eugenio died in mysterious circumstances in 1919 and his body was never received at the place of its intended burial. Eugenio had been seeking news of a son missing in Russia after the October Revolution which may have been his son Sergio. There is no confirmed information about Sergio's death. Prince Peter's proposal of marriage to Violet was accepted which suggests Violet's previous marriage was ended, probably by the death of Sergio. Violet's mother, it is said, persuaded the couple to delay marriage as Prince Peter had a claim of compensation against the Yugoslav government, (estimated at around ¬£6million for the confiscation of the Royal Family's property in Montenegro). Violet's mother feared that if Prince Peter married her daughter, a commoner, it could jeopardise his claim. It is asserted she advised him to collect the money before he wed her daughter. After a number of years of failed attempts to secure the money, Prince Peter attempted to strike a deal with the Yugoslav government whereby he would drop his claim to ¬£6million for a lower ¬£2million. After going to Belgrade and signing paperwork he was told by the government that having agreed to accept ¬£2million, the sum would still not be remitted to him until a later date.Gave Up a Throne To Marry a Policeman's Daughter.

In October 2011, Piers Morgan Tonight had an average total audience of 589,000 each night, down from Larry King Live's average of 657,000 in the same month a year before.

Despite the designation of this Belgrano enclave as a Chinese ethnic enclave, the area is populated by different Asian communities, with a predominance of Taiwanese people and, to a lesser extent, Japanese and Thais. Overview This neighbourhood contains several Chinese restaurants, grocery stores, and a Buddhist temple. It is the core centre of the Chinese community in Argentina. The neighbourhood began to develop in the 1980s when newly arrived Taiwanese and mainland Chinese immigrants settled in this area. The neighbourhood is also known for its celebration of the Chinese New Year. On January 22 the streets of South Belgrano dress up in bright red and golden yellow, as dragon-like puppets and chariots run through the streets undulating and waving to the rhythm of traditional Chinese music. A proposal for the creation of Chinatown as an official barrio of Buenos Aires was promoted by a group of Asian businessmen for commercial purposes in 2006. The requested designation was without success, however, because \\"Chinatown\\" didn't reflect the real population structure of Belgrano, which is populated overwhelmingly by people who are not Asian in origin but European.

There are several ongoing formal complaints about the numerous irregularities that exist in this donation. The donation of this arch had been rejected by competent bodies on two occasions: by the Department of City Planning in 2006 and by the Evaluation Commission Acceptance of Donations Monuments and the Legislature of the Government of the City in 2007. The installation of this arch, and its having been done without consultation is an issue of contention among neighbourhood residents (among them Taiwanese) who do not adhere to the Communist Party of China, and therefore view the arch as an imposition in their Buenos Aires home by the People's Republic of China. = Dedication plaque= > Chinese Arch The Chinese community in Argentina donates with affection this > Arch on the occasion of the Bicentennial of May Revolution to the beautiful > city of Buenos Aires and the great Argentine people thanking the generosity > and love given to Chinese immigrants with the hope that the Chinese- > Argentine friendship will last from generation to generation.

Description The cap is convex to flattened to slightly concave, measuring up to in diameter. The color is bluish violet to greyish violet, drying to brownish. It is dry and smooth, although dry specimens may show radial grooves at the margin corresponding to the gills on the underside. The closely spaced gills have an adnate attachment to the stipe, and are pinkish brown to violet brown. The stipe measures about long by thick, and is somewhat bulbous at the base. It has a smooth surface that is whitish to light gray when fresh, drying to the same color as the cap. The flesh is whitish with a pleasant odor and taste. Spores are cross-shaped, thin-walled, hyaline (translucent), and typically measure 4.8‚Äì5.6 by 3.2‚Äì4 ¬µm. They have a negative staining reaction with Melzer's reagent, and feature a conspicuous hilar appendage. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped with clamps at the base, and measure 24‚Äì32 long by 4.8‚Äì5.6 ¬µm wide. Clamp connections are common in the hyphae. The hymenium contains an abundance of cystidia on both the gill edges (cheilocystidia) and faces (pleurocystidia). =Similar species= The subtropical fungi Tricholosporum atroviolaceum and T. pseudosordidum are similar species with small spores. They can be distinguished from T. tropicale by their less robust fruit bodies, and microscopically by the relative dearth of cystidia. Habitat and distribution The type collection of Tricholosporum tropicale was discovered in September, fruiting singly on the ground in a cacao plantation. The location was a tropical rainforest in the State of Chiapas, Mexico.

Jo√£o\\", a page from Bernardo Gomes de Brito's Historia Tr√°gico-Mar√≠tima, 1735. The Hist√≥ria tr√°gico-mar√≠tima (trans. Tragic History of the Sea) is a famous 18th-century collection of narrative accounts of the travails and wrecks of several Portuguese ships, principally carracks (naus) on the India run between 1552 to 1602, and the oft-harrowing stories of their survivors. The accounts (some of which had been previously published as pamphlets) were collected by historian Bernardo Gomes de Brito and published in two volumes in 1735 and 1736. It is said that Brito had enough material to publish five volumes, but ended up only publishing two. In the course of the 18th century, several collections of other shipwreck accounts were published, alleging themselves to be the 'third volume' of Brito's work. Some of these latter accounts were appended to Brito's original in a multi-volume 1904-1909 edition of the Hist√≥ria prepared by Gabriel Pereira. The original title of Brito's collection was Hist√≥ria tr√°gico-mar√≠tima, em que se escrevem chronologicamente os naufragios que tiveram as naus de Portugal, depois que se poz em exerc√≠cio a Navega√ß√£o da √çndia., published in Lisbon by the Off. da Congrega√ß√£o do Orat√≥rio, volume I in 1735 (4¬∞ de XVI-479 pag.) and volume II in 1736 (4¬∞ de XVI-538 pag.)

The wings are white, although the base of the wings is darker, almost the same colour of thorax. The forewings have light brown spots toward the apical margin very close to the middle, forming an irregular band. The hindwings have smaller spots. The larvae feed on the leaves of Fraxinus excelsior and are considered a pest. The newly hatched caterpillars mostly feed on the lower epidermis and parenchyma tissue, leaving a network of veins. As the caterpillars grow, the size of these grooves increases. Infested leaves usually dry and turn brownish in time. The damage caused can be significant and some trees may be completely defoliated. There are five instars.  References  External links *Light Magpie at UKMoths *Moths and Butterflies of Europe and North Africa *Lepiforum e.V.

Levy (; October 11, 1941 ‚Äì March 11, 2014) was an Israeli judge of the Supreme Court of Israel and member of the Judicial Selection Committee. In January 2012, he was appointed by Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu to head a three-member committee which was to examine the legal aspects of land ownership in the West Bank. The committee‚Ä≤s report, usually referred to as \\"Levy Report\\", was published in July 2012. Biography Levy was born in Basra, Iraq to supporters of the Herut movement. He emigrated to Israel with his parents at the age of 10. He grew up in Ramat Gan, where he finished high school in 1958. After his military service which ended in 1961, he began working at the Ramla Magistrate's Court and at the same time he studied statutory law at Tel Aviv University. He also served as Vice-Mayor of Ramla on behalf of the Likud party for a short time. In 1969 he finished his law studies, and opened his own office in Tel Aviv after he got his lawyer license in 1970. In 1977 he was appointed as a military judge, in 1979 as a Magistrate judge, and in 1984 he became District judge in Tel Aviv. Levy was appointed to the Supreme Court in August 2001 along with Ayala Procaccia. The kippah wearing Levy was perceived as representing the Religious Zionists, complementing Procaccia‚Ä≤s secular views. On 24 March 2008, Levy was elected by the Supreme Court justices to serve on the Judicial Selection Committee in place of the court's Vice-President Eliezer Rivlin.◊ó◊ì◊©◊ï◊™ ◊û◊ó◊ú◊ß◊î ◊®◊ê◊©◊ï◊†◊î - News1: ◊î◊©◊ï◊§◊ò ◊ê◊ì◊û◊ï◊†◊ì ◊ú◊ï◊ô ◊û◊¶◊ò◊®◊£ ◊ú◊ï◊ï◊¢◊ì◊î ◊ú◊ë◊ó◊ô◊®◊™ ◊©◊ï◊§◊ò◊ô◊ù 24 March 2008. In January 2012 he was appointed by Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu as head of a three-member committee dubbed the ‚Äúoutpost committee‚Äù to examine the legal aspects of land ownership in the West Bank and to review the 2005 government report known as the Sasson Report which had found that several dozen outposts were built without state approval and on privately owned Palestinian land. The 89-page report referred to as Levy Report was published by the Israeli government on 9 July 2012. Legal views and rulings Levy's main expertise was criminal law. Among others, he presided over the highly publicized trial of Yigal Amir, the political assassin who murdered of Yitzhak Rabin, and made sure that the trial was a regular criminal trial, which was both praised and criticized. He also wrote the ruling in Ze'ev Rosenstein's extradition to the United States, wherein he recognized the legality of extraditing an Israeli citizen who has committed offenses connected to the territory of a foreign country. Levy was an activist judge considered the most activist Supreme Court justice ever. He intervened in administrative and governmental decisions, including Knesset laws, when he thought it necessary, even in cases where the court usually does not get involved. He was not afraid to hold the minority opinion and wrote several court opinions as the single dissenting judge. He was the only judge who did not approve the slashes in the guaranteed income allowances, ruling \\"The right to live a dignified basic existence is an inseparable part of the right to human dignity\\". In his opinion, this right includes \\"the right to adequate living conditions and is not intended merely to keep a man from intolerable deprivation.\\" His humanity was also reflected in his verdict revoking the practice of binding migrant workers to their employers. According to this practice, the workers lose their right to be in Israel once they leave their employers. \\"We must not turn their poverty into an instrument for uncontrolled, disproportionate infringement of basic rights,\\" he ruled. \\"We, who know what it is like to be in exile and know what it is like to be a stranger, for we were strangers in the land of Egypt.\\" His most important verdict, according to Haaretz is his minority opinion against ten colleagues about the 2005 disengagement from the Gaza Strip: He wanted to annul the Evacuation-Compensation Law and the entire pullout.

Captain John Lovewell led a privately organized company of scalp hunters, organized into a makeshift ranger company, and Chief Paugus led the Abenaki at Pequawket, the site of present-day Fryeburg, Maine. The battle was related to the expansion of New England settlements along the Kennebec River (in present-day Maine). The battle was the last major engagement between the English and the Wabanaki Confederacy in Governor Dummer's War. The Fight was celebrated in song and story for at least several generations and became an important part of regional lore‚Äîeven influencing the stories of Nathaniel Hawthorne in the early 19th century as well as other writers. Its importance is often exaggerated in local histories, as arguably the August 1724 English raid on Norridgewock was probably more significant for the direction of the conflict and in bringing the Abenaki to the treaty table. But the Norridgewock raid, also celebrated in song and poetry, has been less well remembered, probably because it was essentially a massacre of Indian civilians by New England forces.  Historical context of Dummer's War  The Treaty of Utrecht (1713), which ended Queen Anne's War, had facilitated the expansion of New England settlement. The treaty, however, had been signed in Europe and had not involved any tribes of the native's Wabanaki Confederacy. Since they had not been consulted, they protested this incursion into their lands by conducting raids on British fishermen and settlements. For the first and only time, Wabanaki would fight New Englanders and the British on their own terms and for their own reasons and not principally to defend French imperial interests. In response to Wabanaki hostilities toward the expansion, the Governor of Nova Scotia, Richard Philipps, built a fort in traditional Mi'kmaq territory at Canso, Nova Scotia, in 1720, and Massachusetts Governor Samuel Shute built forts on traditional Abenaki territory at the mouth of the Kennebec River. The French claimed the same territory on the Kennebec River by building churches in the Abenaki villages of Norridgewock and Medoctec further upriver. These fortifications escalated the conflict.  Lovewell's expeditions  In early September 1724 some Indians came to Dunstable and captured two men. When they did not return from work, a party of ten or more men started in pursuit. One man, Josiah Farwell, warned the leader of the possibility of running into an ambush. Despite this the posse rushed ahead, with Farwell following behind. They were ambushed and eight of the men were killed; the others, excepting Farwell who barely escaped, were captured. Because of these attacks it was thought best to carry on the war more vigorously. Bounties for scalps were once again offered by the provincial government in order to encourage volunteer companies to form (and save the colony the time and expense of raising troops). John Lovewell quickly organized a company of amateur scalp- hunters from the Dunstable area. While they were favored by a grant from the provincial assembly, these troops were not part of the Massachusetts military establishment, but rather a privately organized group of raiders. Lovewell was not a commissioned officer in the provincial forces. Lovewell, whose maternal grandparents had been killed and scalped by Indians, raised the company of thirty men and was appointed by them as captain. In part because of Farwell's common sense Lovewell selected him as his second-in-command and made him lieutenant. Lovewell and Farwell went on three scalp hunting expeditions from December to May.  The battle  Lovewell's third expedition consisted of only 47 men, many of whom were unfamiliar with ranging. With men who were more inexperienced and far fewer in number than in the earlier expeditions, they left from Dunstable (present day Nashua, New Hampshire) on April 16, 1725. The Indian guide and another were unable to continue and returned to Dunstable, along with a relative of the injured colonial. When another fell ill they built a fort at Ossipee and left 10 men, including the ill man, the doctor and John Goffe, to garrison the fort while the rest left to raid the Abenaki village of Pequawket, located near the Saco River. On May 9, as the 34 militiamen were being led in morning prayer by chaplain Jonathan Frye, a lone Abenaki warrior was spotted hunting at the lakeshore. Suspecting that this man was a decoy and that there was an Indian force in front of them, nonetheless the rangers decided to hide their packs and proceed cautiously. Lovewell's men waited until the warrior was close and, although accounts differ in who fired first, the Abenaki did have a chance to fire his fowling piece loaded with beavershot at close range, wounding Lovewell and another. Further fire from the rangers killed the Indian. Chaplain Frye is reported to have scalped the dead Indian. Meanwhile, the rangers' packs had been discovered by an Abenaki war party (some accounts say two) who, seeing that they outnumbered the rangers, hid in ambush. When the rangers returned to their packs (in single file) the Abenakis fired at the front and rear and charged. Lovewell was killed in the first volley along with eight others. Lovewell's lieutenants, Josiah Farwell and Jonathan Robbins, were among the wounded at this point (they critically). Ensign Seth Wyman organized the defence and was in command of the rangers during the rest of the fight. After the initial volleys the battle turned into a firefight with individuals on both sides hiding behind trees in the pine plain. Being outnumbered, the rangers had to take care not to be surrounded. Since a tree did not provide any cover from the sides and rear the colonials slowly pulled back to the lake to protect their rear. They then withdrew eastward to a location passed twice earlier that day where, in addition to the lake protecting them from the south, they had a swollen stream on the east (now named Fight Brook), flooded land to the north and fallen trees to the west. Although surrounded, they were able to keep the more numerous enemy further away from accurate fire. During the battle, the Indian war chief Paugus was shot dead. There is debate over who shot him. Some posit that he was shot by John Chamberlaine (\\"John Chamberlain, the Indian fighter at Pigwacket\\"), while others report that it was Seth Wyman who killed the warrior with the next shot. With the death of Paugus, the rest of the Indians soon vanished into the forest.  An Abenaki account of the battle  The story of the Battle of Pequawket recounted below was originally told by a daughter of Powack, a chief of the Penobscot people, allied with the Abenaki in the Wabanaki Confederacy. It was retold through generations until written down. It appears, as written, in . Powack wanted peace with the English. He called a council which then sent him as an envoy to the Pequawkets. Powack took his daughter and Little Elk, her betrothed. While they were staying with the Pequawkets, Paugus, a non-Pequawket, came to the village to recruit for a raiding party against the English. He led all the warriors down the Saco River to English settlements in Maine. The remaining villagers fished at the south end of Saco (Lovewell) Pond until the raiding party finally returned to be the vanguard back to the village. On the way back to the village the Penobscots heard gunfire from the battle. Powack and Little Elk remained at the battle while all the non-combatant Abenaki skirted the battle to return to the village. The remaining Pequawkets moved to Canada, and Powack's daughter went with them until she found someone to take her back home.  Aftermath  Only 20 of the militiamen survived the battle; three died on the retreat home. The Abenaki losses except for Paugus are unknown. The Abenaki deserted the town of Pequawket after the battle and fled to Canada (New France).  Legacy  * More than one hundred years later, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (poem, \\"The Battle of Lovells Pond\\"), Nathaniel Hawthorne (story, \\"Roger Malvin's Burial\\") and Henry David Thoreau (passage in the book A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers) all wrote about Lovewell's Fight. * The lake at which the battle occurred is named Lovewell Pond, and a stream leading to it is named Fight Brook. Paugus Bay in Laconia, New Hampshire; the town of Paugus Mill (now part of Albany, New Hampshire; and Mount Paugus in New Hampshire were named after Chief Paugus. (The town of Fryeburg was not named for the ranger's chaplain, Jonathan Frye, but rather was named after Joseph Frye, who was awarded a land grant in the area much later.) * At the north end of Lovewell Pond in Fryeburg there is a small monument to the English rangers near where the battle took place. It is on Lovewell Pond Road near its junction with Battleground Road and Island Road.

Frayne and with Booth Tarkington on Monsieur Beaucaire. Over the last decade or so of her life, Sutherland would write a number of plays with her close friend Beulah Marie Dix. Their most successful play, The Road to Yesterday, written in 1906, became the genesis for Victor Herbert's 1924 operetta The Dream Girl. Sutherland continued to contribute short stories and poetry to national magazines throughout her career and in 1894 was awarded first prize in a short story competition sponsored by McClure‚Äôs for her army tale, \\"Dikkon's Dog\\". Death Sutherland died at her Boston home on December 24, 1908, from burns she suffered when her gown brushed up against a gas stove and caught fire.

It was founded in 1964 by Rabbi Gedaliah Anemer. It consists of separate high schools for boys and girls and a beis medrash. The Yeshiva of Greater Washington Boys Division The Yeshiva Boys Division is for boys in grades 7 through 12, with a student body of approximately 145. The Yeshiva of Greater Washington (or YGW) has a dual curriculum that emphasizes both general and Judaic studies, and holds its students to high academic standards. The Yeshiva encourages its students to pursue a year of study in Yeshiva in Israel before attending college. In addition to the boys school, The Yeshiva has a girls division located in a separate building. The Yeshiva College Of The Nation's Capital The Yeshiva College Of The Nation's Capital program offers a nationally accredited Bachelor's in Talmudic Law (BTL). To earn this degree, a student must earn four years of Talmud study credits, two of which can be transferred from other accredited Yeshivos. The Yeshiva offers a warm and unique atmosphere in which one's development can thrive, catering best to those who are self-motivated in making learning their priority. University of Maryland University College (UMUC) and the Yeshiva College have an exclusive articulation agreement and is their primary college program. The program offers a full range of undergraduate degree programs with a schedule that allows the talmidim (students) to still learn a full 1st and 2nd seder in yeshiva. Rabbi Gedaliah Anemer Rabbi Anemer led one of the Washington area's oldest and largest Orthodox Jewish synagogues and was considered the chief rabbi of Greater Washington. Rabbi Anemer led the Young Israel Shomrai Emunah synagogue for over 50 years and he established a large orthodox Jewish community in the Kemp Mill Silver Spring Area. Rabbi Anemer came to Washington, DC in 1957 to lead a Hyattsville congregation that eventually moved to Washington. In 1961, he settled in Silver Spring and led Jewish services in his basement while also leading the synagogue in his community. On Sabbath Rabbi Anemer had to walk 7 miles just to lead his services at the synagogue. In 1964, as the community began to expand, he established a Jewish school, the Yeshiva of Greater Washington which is here till this day. He taught advanced classes on the Talmud, or Jewish law. In 1974, Rabbi Anemer's synagogue expanded with a second location on Arcola Avenue. Unfortunately Rabbi Anemer died April 15, 2010, but was well known for building the community which expanded from 30 families to over 500 today and will be remembered for many generations to come. Although Rabbi Anemer was not buried in Silver Spring, there was a large gathering to commemorate the Rabbi who had such a great impact. The commemoration ceremony was filled with students, Rabbis and families throughout the Jewish communities. Every student from the Yeshiva of Greater Washington and the Melvin J. Berman Hebrew Academy attended this ceremony. Curriculum Yeshiva curriculum is split into two parts. One part is devoted to the general studies of Mathematics, Science, English, Computers, and History. The other part of the day consists of Judaic studies such as Gemorah, which is focused on the most, Chumash, Jewish Law, and Hebrew Language. The school offers three levels of High School courses: Regular, Honors, and A.P Classes. The various Advanced Placement classes include AP European History, AP United States History, AP English Literature and Composition, and AP Government. The school has a College preparatory program that is designed to provide the students with a comprehensive academic program, emphasizing the development of critical thinking and research skills both written and oral. These classes prepare the students academically for admission to the colleges of their choice as a primary goal. Faculty The development department is led by Rabbi Binyamin Sanders, who assists the headmaster, Rabbi Yitzchok Merkin. The development coordinator is Mrs. Donna Goldman. The boys middle school and high school division is currently under the leadership of the Menahel, Rabbi Amram Hes. Rabbi Ahron Lopiansky is the Rosh Yeshiva of the Yeshiva Gedolah Division. Rabbi Kreiser is the Mashgiach. Yeshiva has both Jewish and non Jewish staff for their classes throughout the day. The classes are quite small in size, so that the focus is on attention to the students. Throughout the year the faculty becomes very close with their students making them feel at home. Extra curricular activities The Yeshiva of Greater Washington has some extra curricular activities which include, but are not limited to, a robotics club, a public speaking club, Minyonaire Club, Art club, science club and a krav maga club (a number of these clubs no longer exist). They have a Junior Varsity basketball team and a varsity baseball team. During the fall season they play an intramural football team called Yeshiva Football League. The school has a newspaper printed every quarter of the school year that many of the students post articles in for the community. Once a year they have a Shabbaton program for both the high school and the middle school. The past few years the school has taken the seniors to Israel to tour and evaluate the schools for their upcoming year in Israel. In addition, the whole school takes a ski trip during the winter. They have many different committees in school, such as: the Chesed committee, the business committee, yearbook committee, and the trip committee. The school has a student council for each grade but one president from the senior class. Overall the students participate in the schools extra curricular activities during school and help the Jewish community with their needs. Yeshiva Gedolah The Yeshiva Gedolah of Greater Washington takes in intelligent and mature students who are focused on becoming serious Jews committed to making Torah the major focus of their formative years. This is a separate section of the Yeshiva High School, and takes in students after High School. Students that attend Yeshiva Gedolah receive a four-year Bachelor of Talmudic Law (BTL) degree and could then go to Graduate school. Many other students learn Torah during the day, and at night they take college classes. Most of the Yeshiva Gedolah students live in the Warwick apartments in Kemp Mill Maryland; the students who do not live in the apartments live in houses in Kemp Mill Maryland. The rabbis that teach them Torah are Rabbi Aaron Lopiansky, Rabbi Reingold, Rabbi Arzouan, and Rabbi Kreiser. The Yeshiva Gedolah provides a three \\"seder\\" yeshiva education with their personalized interaction that are easier to offer with a smaller yeshiva. The Yeshiva places a major focus on their students to develop their own learning skills with the Torah and how to apply it to their daily lives. The classes are given at a very high level to make sure that they develop self-sufficiency in their learning. The Yeshiva Gedolah offers a unique atmosphere where student development can thrive, and is looking for students who are self-motivated in making learning their priority.

Historically the house was on a farm, this has been reduced over time to , which includes the house, a barn, an ice house, and a privy. The main block was probably built c. 1833, with the ell possibly older. A building is referenced on the property in an 1823 deed, which may have been the ell, which is thought to have served as overflow housing for a nearby tavern operated by the Pomeroy family. The Pomeroys established the tavern in 1801, next to the church, whose congregation was established in 1745. Eleazer Pomeroy, in addition to operating the tavern, also ran stagecoaches, and had acquired a large amount of land in the area by 1828. He is believed to be the builder of this house, which was sold to his son George in 1843.

Attendance As of August 31, 2010, the pavilion reported that attendance had surpassed 4.7 million and was averaging more than 41,000, people per day. On September 30, 2010 the pavilion welcomed its 6 millionth + visitor. By the end of October, the USA Pavilion had received 7.3 million visits. Reception The Chinese media reported that the pavilion's content and message left visitors to the pavilion with a lasting and memorable impression of \\"U.S. Spirit.\\" According to a Fudan University poll commissioned by the USA Pavilion, the pavilion was well liked by Chinese visitors. The Fudan University research study, posted October 14, 2010 on PRNewswire, found that the USA Pavilion met high visitor expectations and generated positive perceptions of Americans. In the study, 95 percent of respondents felt their visit to the USA Pavilions was worth the \\"time and effort\\" and 93.4 percent thought it was a good representation of the \\"American spirit.\\" However, a study conducted by Duke University business school professor Liu Kang, then acting as dean of the Institute of Arts and Humanities at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, gave \\"Thumbs down for US pavilion\\" and deemed it the \\"most disappointing\\" at the Expo (This document has since been removed from the Shanghai Daily archives, a copy of it can be found on Google Docs at https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid;=explorer&chrome;=true&srcid;=0BzkHBYsY9tkfNWZlMDlhODYtZTMwZi00OTgwLTg1YTgtMDFjZjA1ZTI0NWVl&hl;=en/). According to Liu, \\"Maybe people had higher expectations so they left disappointed.\\" Reactions among US officials and US media were mixed. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the most senior US official to visit the pavilion, responded \\"It's fine,\\" when asked to express an opinion on the structure and its programs.https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/23/world/asia/23diplo.html US Senator Richard Lugar, in a February 15, 2011 letter introducing a report on public diplomacy efforts in China, noted that the USA pavilion \\"drew criticism for its hastily organized presentations and lack of a cogent message.\\" [lugar.senate.gov/issues/foreign/diplomacy/ChinaInternet.pdf] A Los Angeles Times editorial commented that the mainly Chinese visitors to the pavilion enjoyed watching the American citizens in the pavilion's introductory film make fun of themselves as they attempted to learn simple Chinese greetings. The editorial also noted that \\"the pavilion is so loaded with corporate logos that the messages are nearly lost to branding by Chevron, General Electric and others.\\" The Washington Post reported that the pavilion was a hit among the Expo's mostly Chinese visitors. The same paper's Ezra Klein, however, summed up the pavilion's appeal to China visitors thusly: \\"We're bad at languages, in hock to corporations, and able to set up gardens when children shame us into doing so.\\" Reacting to US media focus on the pavilion's commercial sponsorship, National Public Radio (NPR, US) reported: \\"Some American visitors find it gauche, but the Chinese seem unperturbed by all the corporate messages.\\" Reporter: \\"I talked to more than a dozen Chinese visitors. I asked them to resist their urge to be polite and give me a no-holds barred review. No one had a bad word to say. Here's visitor Zhu Shan Bin exiting the pavilion.\\" Bin: \\"It shows us the American spirit, which is multi-cultural and filled with imagination and creativity. From the movies here, I see Americans value children and a good education.\\" Reporter: \\"Now that is some brilliant corporate messaging.\\" Pavilion exit interviews by the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS, US) program News Hour found the audience pleased by what they saw, and commenting that it showed them another side of America, which was well worth the long lines endured to enter the pavilion. In a typical response, one woman interviewed by PBS News Hour commented: \\"My View of America Changed‚Ä¶from what I saw, America seemed more sincere and friendly...right now, America and China, they are good friends.\\" Themes The pavilion's content was based on four core concepts: teamwork, sustainability, health, and the spirit of striving for success. Visitors passed through four spaces: a welcome hall, a pre-show, a main show, and a post show display area. In the first hall, visitors were greeted in Mandarin Chinese in a series of vignettes featuring a cross-section of the United States' multi-cultural residents. The second space presented the \\"Spirit of America\\", promoting collaboration and celebrating opportunity, diversity, freedom, and innovation. The third space featured the main attraction, a 4-D film entitled \\"The Garden.\\" In the fourth and final space, the pavilion's corporate sponsors displayed their emerging technologies and products. \\"The Garden\\" told the story of a 10-year-old girl who envisions turning a blighted vacant city lot in her neighborhood into a beautiful, urban pocket park. The young girl encouraged her neighbors to come together to make the park a reality. In the process, she also created a closer community of neighbors. The eight-minute film was projected upon five 10-meter-high screens trimmed by programmable LED lighting effects (833 lighting cues in eight minutes). Audiences were especially captivated by the 4-D effects, which included lighting, mist, and vibrating seats. These special effects combined with a non-verbal approach made the message universally understandable by all visitors, with no language barrier to interfere. As described in the \\"Beijing Review,\\" the film, \\"With its 4-D wind and rain effects, gives audiences an amazing visual and tactile experience. Although there was no dialogue in the film, the excellent visual and audio effects make the film accessible to audiences with different cultural and language backgrounds.\\" Show design The show aspects of the USA Pavilion were conceived and produced by Bob Rogers (designer) and Tony Mitchell from a Burbank, California based firm, BRC Imagination Arts, which has produced attractions and content for 11 world's fair presentations, including the film for the Vancouver Expo, \\"Rainbow War\\", which was nominated for an Academy Award (\\"Oscar\\"). Plaza stage In addition to the theater shows, entertainment was provided at the USA Pavilion on an ongoing basis with live performances by various US artists, including Dee Dee Bridgewater, Herbie Hancock, and Ozomatli. The Philadelphia Orchestra performed during the opening week of the Expo; Harry Connick Jr was featured at the pavilion's National Day celebration. Student ambassadors Many visitors, bloggers and newspapers praised the role of the pavilion's \\"Student Ambassadors.\\" Chosen through a national competition organized by the U.S.-China Institute at the University of Southern California, these Chinese- speaking university students were responsible for introducing exhibits, talking to visitors as they waited to enter the pavilion, working with visiting dignitaries and delegations, and participating in various community projects (e.g., a Habitat for Humanity effort). Several of these student ambassadors appeared on Chinese television and were interviewed by newspapers about their experience working at the Expo and living in the Expo Village. Celebrity guests President Hu Jintao visited the pavilion a few days before the opening. In addition to many Chinese officials, notable guests included Quincy Jones, Robert De Niro, Patrick Stewart, Roger Federer, Adiran Brody, Diane Von Furstenberg, Halle Berry, Harry Connick Jr, Indra Nooyi, JW Marriott, Jeffrey Sachs, Anna Sui, and Maya Lin. NBA players Kevin Durant and Kevin Garnett visited, as did the presidents of University of Michigan, Northwestern University and a number of other colleges and universities. Other guests included former US President Jimmy Carter, Hillary Clinton, Al Gore, Gary Locke, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Richard Daley. Architecture The USA Pavilion was a gray steel structure designed to resemble an eagle with its wings outstretched to welcome pavilion visitors. The 60,000-square-foot (5574 sq. meter) United States Pavilion, constructed largely from glass and steel, was designed by Canadian architect Clive Grout. In May 2010, one on-line article criticized the exterior of the structure as unimaginative and resembling an ordinary office building. This simplicity in design was likely to have been the intent of the facility designer; in a February 2010 article in Fast Company magazine, Grout explained that, \\"We have not felt the need to do an architectural handstand to get attention.\\" Funding A lack of US Government funding has hampered US participation in World Fairs since the 1990s. Although the US had a pavilion at the 2005 Expo in Japan, there was no US official presence at the Universal Expo 2000 in Hanover, Germany. It was widely reported in the press that American law prohibits or limits the spending of public money for participating in world's fairs. However, a persistent pavilion critic asserted that this was a State Department fabrication, part of the Bush Administration's policy decision to privatize the US Pavilion. In his commentary on the internet blog, \\"Foreign Policy\\", Jacobson claimed that a 2006-2007 RFP process was aborted, and the US pavilion project was outsourced, in March 2008. He further claimed that, with initial difficulty finding support, in October 2008 the team reportedly received some undisclosed form of support from the US Consulate. [80] With the Obama administration replacing the Bush administration in the fall of 2008 election, newly appointed Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's first overseas trip was to East Asia. Clinton soon began efforts to raise the funds necessary to make the USA Pavilion a reality. Clinton's personal intervention and her fund- raising network are widely credited with helping the U.S. avoid the embarrassment of being a no-show at the largest world expo ever. She also recruited Jose H. Villarreal, a lawyer and Democratic Party fundraiser from San Antonio, Texas, to serve as Commissioner General. Thomas E. Cooney, Public Affairs Officer of the United States Consulate General Shanghai, acted as the Deputy Commissioner General. The USA Pavilion at the 2010 Shanghai Expo was noted as the only national pavilion at the Expo solely funded by the financial contributions of approximately 60 multinational corporations. Sponsors‚Äîcalled \\"Marketing Partners\\" by Shanghai Expo 2010, Inc., the pavilion producers‚Äîinclude: Yum!, PepsiCo, Microsoft, Johnson & Johnson, Boeing, Procter & Gamble, The Walt Disney Company, General Electric, 3M and Wal-Mart. A contribution of US $ 5 million from Citigroup completed the year-long campaign among corporations to reach the project's US $61 million funding goal, although additional corporate contributions (including from the American branch of Haier, China's largest household appliance manufacturer) continued to be raised. According to one reporter, the presentations and post show exhibits, their design, projection systems, sound systems, show sets, finishes, installation, training, etc. cost $23 million, or about $2.3 million per minute of entertainment. In addition to funding the USA Pavilion, corporate America was present in several other venues. The food-court building adjacent to the USA Pavilion was managed by fast-food conglomerate Yum Brands, a USA Pavilion \\"marketing partner\\" (sponsor). Several US corporations who were not sponsors of the official pavilion built their own stand-alone pavilions in other areas of the Expo.

Biography  Melnik is a Tier I Canada Research Chair in Mathematical Modeling and Professor at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, Canada. His other affiliations include the University of Waterloo and University of Guelph.  Education and career  He earned his Ph.D. at Kiev State University in the late 1980s. According to the Mathematics Genealogy Project, his scientific ancestors include A. Tikhonov and other outstanding mathematicians and scientists. Before moving to Canada as a Tier I Canada Research Chair, Melnik gained a worldwide reputation in mathematical modelling and applied mathematics,Rindy Metcalf, New professor brings ideas, The Tech Talk, January 23, 2004. while working in Europe, Australia, and the United States.  Awards and honors  Melnik is a recipient of many fellowships and awards,Af Bente Dalgaard, At bringe verden til SDU, Ny Viden, No. 1, January 2007. including the Andersen fellowship at Syddansk Universitet in Denmark, the Isaac Newton Institute visiting fellowship at the University of Cambridge in England, the Ikerbasque Fellowship in Spain, the fellowship of the Institute of Advanced Studies at the University of Bologna in Italy, and others. He is a life member of the Canadian Applied and Industrial Mathematics Society. Melnik is the director of the Laboratory of Mathematical Modeling for New Technologies (M2NeT Lab) in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.  Research  In his early works Melnik studied fully coupled hyperbolic-elliptic models applied in dynamic piezoelectricity theory. Such models, originally proposed by W. Voigt in 1910, have found many applications, and Melnik was the first to rigorously prove well-posedness of a large class of such models in the dynamic case.Masayuki Akamatsu & Gen Nakamura, Applicable Analysis, 81, 2002. The piezoelectric effect itself, captured by such models, was discovered in 1880 by Pierre and Jacques Curie. Mathematical models describing this effect in time-dependent situations are based on initial-boundary value problems for coupled systems of partial differential equations. The mathematical and computational analysis of such coupled systems has been in the focus of many Melnik's works. In the 1990s he extended his scientific interests to applications of mathematics in semiconductor and other advanced technologies, including smart and bio-inspired materials technologies, where in collaboration with A. Roberts and their students he pioneered computationally efficient low-dimensional reductions of complex time-dependent nonlinear mathematical models. His other important contributions at that time included fundamental problems in control theory and dynamic system evolution, as well as a range of problems in industrial & applied mathematics and numerical analysis. Melnik is an expert in computational and applied mathematics with a number of important results in the coupled field theory as applied in physics, biology, and engineering. He is a leading computational analyst, well known for his contributions to the analysis of coupled multiscale phenomena, processes, and systems. His recent significant contributions are in the analysis of mutual influence between quantum and classical effects in complex systems, in particular in the study of coupled effects in low-dimensional nanostructures,Unraveling coupled multiscale phenomena in quantum dot nanostructures , Nanotechnology, 20, 125402, 2009 as well as in bio-inspired engineering and biological systems.Coarse-graining RNA nanostructures for MD simulations , Physical Biology, 7, 036001, 2010.

Founded in 1988, the company employs nearly 500 people domestically and internationally who design, manufacture, and market orthopedic implants and surgical devices. The company is a subsidiary of Colson Associates, a spin-off of the Marmon Group, a Berkshire Hathaway company. History Randall and Mary Huebner started Accurate Machine and Design in 1988 in New Jersey. Then in 1990 the couple moved the company west to the state of Oregon. After being renamed as Acumed, the company was later one of four nominees from Oregon for the National Blue Chip Enterprises' 1996 award for small business who had faced and overcome challenges. In 1999, Acumed was sold to the Marmon Group. By April 2001, the company was based in Beaverton, Oregon, and employed 90 people at a facility after adding 30 people to the payroll in a years time. That month the company purchased in Hillsboro off Cornelius Pass Road and Jacobson Road for $2.3 million in order to continue expansion. In 2001, the Portland Business Journal ranked Acumed as the ninth largest bioscience and medical technology company in Oregon based on the number of employees. The next year the Marmon Group split off Acumed and its other medical companies into Colson Associates, headed by Robert Pritzker. Acumed headquarters Acumed partnered with Oregon Health Sciences University to fund start-up Acute Innovations in 2006 to refine thoracic surgical procedures. Acute operated out of Acumed's Hillsboro facilities. Due to sales growth, largely on the international side, the company hired an additional 45 people in 2006, bringing total employment at the company to 195. Alan Kozlowski was the president of the company at that time. Acumed's plant suffered a small fire in May 2007 when a titanium lathe caught fire, which only damaged the $350,000 machine. A jury found that Stryker Corporation willfully infringed on Acumed's patent on a shoulder fracture treatment in a September 2005 verdict. After a mostly unsuccessful appeal by Stryker to the Federal Circuit, judge Anna J. Brown of the federal district court in Portland issued a permanent injunction in December 2007 that prevented Stryker from selling its humeral nail. The Federal Circuit court then affirmed the permanent injunction a year later.Acumed LLC v. Stryker Corp., 551 F.3d 1323 (Fed. Cir. 2008). The company's facility on Brookwood Parkway in Hillsboro, Oregon In 2007, machinists at the company built a custom motorcycle that the company approved of as a marketing tool. Costing $20,000 to build, the blue-colored motorcycle featured the company's logo and products, but was not street legal. The bike's unique features included titanium humeral stems sold by Acumed and used on the motorcycle as the clutch lever and hand brake. As of October 2004, Acumed employed 130 people at its facilities in Oregon, which totaled in space. That year the company announced plans to expand by adding to their existing facility in Hillsboro and hire an additional 140 employees over five years. The expansion was estimated to cost nearly $23 million, with $200,000 coming from the state of Oregon's Strategic Reserve Fund in the form of working training. In November 2009, the company purchased a building and of land located along Brookwood Parkway in Hillsboro for $4.9 million. The building had been used by Hansen Architectural Systems Inc., with Acumed purchasing the building for a planned expansion of their business while keeping their headquarters off Cornelius Pass Road. At that time, Acumed employed 295 people and sold products in 30 countries. Alan Kozlowski stepped down as company president in 2008 and was replaced by David Jensen. Jensen left the company in July 2013. Acumed appointed Robert Johnson as president in September 2013. Products Acumed designs and builds orthopedic medical devices that are implanted into patients, as well as surgical devices. Implant products are used for reconstruction and repair from trauma injuries. These include screws and plates that attach to feet, ankles, fingers, arms, and shoulders. The products are manufactured at Acumed's Hillsboro facility.

Kathajodi River is an arm of the Mahanadi River in Odisha, India. It branches off at Naraj, then immediately is bifurcated. The southern branch, known as Kuakhai, which means Crow's pool, and flows into the Puri district. Its mouth is closed by a bar, so that little water flows into it except at flood times. A little lower down from Cuttack the kathajodi is bifurcated. The right branch is Sidhua and the left branch is Khatajodi. from flowing divide area 17 km the khatajodi is merge with sidhua. The merge area is known as Odisha famous Dalei Ghai . The Kathajodi and the Sidhua create an island known as 42 Mouza. it is near about cuttack town just 2 km. again the kathajodi is bifurcated at Gobindpur, the right branch is known as the Devi and the left branch as the Biluakhai. Flowing in the northerly direction, the river Kathajodi again divides into the Alaka and Kathajodi proper, which have been cut off at their head by the Devi left embankment. The water originally carried by them has been diverted into the Devi. The river Kathajodi is said to have been originally a comparatively small stream. Its name implies that it could at one time be crossed by a plank of wood known as katha in Oriya. During the last century the volume of water passing down its channel increased considerably and the head of the river became too large to carry off the enormous volume of water poured into it by Mahanadi. A weir and training embankments were, therefore constructed at Naraj between 1860 and 1865, in order to regulate the flow and direct some of the water to the Mahanadi channels. During rains, the river and its branches carry great volume of water in them and at the time of high floods they overflow their banks. To safeguard people from the ravages of flood, embankments have been erected on their banks where necessary. Around Naraj Bridge, which is approximately from Cuttack city there are the following villages: Naraja Marthapur(Local Railway Station), Godi Sahi, Sandhapur, Bidyadharapur, Nua Sahi and Ratagarh. All these villages are rich in ancient heritage. The people of these villages cultivate paddy and vegetables. Some of the villages by the side of the Kathajodi River: Raghunathpur, Matagajapur, Mahura, etc. The famous Hansanath Temple dedicated to Lord Shiva is situated near Kathajodi River near Paramahansa famous for Jagar Yatra during Maha Shivaratri.

Rivkin is best known as the co-founder of CryptoLogic, a pioneering online casino software company, and FUN Technologies, one of the world's largest providers of casual games and fantasy sports. History Andrew Rivkin was born and raised in Toronto. He graduated from University College, University of Toronto in 1992 with a bachelor of commerce degree in finance and economics. In 2002, Rivkin co-founded Columbia Exchange Systems Software PLC with Lorne Abony, another collaborator from CryptoLogic with whom Rivkin has worked with on several business ventures. In 2003, after the two raised C$1.8 million from initial investors, they rebranded the company to FUN Technologies before issuing two initial public offerings in short order, the first on the London Alternative Investment Market in 2003 and the second on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 2004. In particular, Rivkin's past association with CryptoLogic was considered key to the success of the London IPO. The Meridian, Colorado based Liberty Media acquired a majority interest in FUN Technologies stock in 2005. Liberty Media purchased the rest of FUN Technologies in late 2007. The company was valued at nearly C$500 million at the time of its final sale to Liberty Media. Since leaving FUN Technologies, Rivkin has served as a consultant for Mood Media, a Toronto-based in-store media company headed by Abony. In 2009 Rivkin founded Rivkin Asset Management, an asset management firm dealing in hedge funds. In March 2011 Rivkin was involved with Mood Media's acquisition of Muzak Holdings for $345 million. Rivkin is an avid polo player and participates in several charity polo tournaments in Canada. CryptoLogic After founding a network business systems company while still in his teens, Rivkin moved on to co-found CryptoLogic in Toronto in February 1995 with his brother, Mark. Although founded as a general Internet security software company, CryptoLogic soon focused on online gambling, which had become a growth industry since Antigua and Barbuda became the first country to legalize the practice in 1994. In 1996 InterCasino, the world's first real wager Internet casino, went online using CryptoLogic software. By 1998 CryptoLogic was considered a major player in the emerging online casino industry, with its software used by online casinos in Cura√ßao and Dominica as well as Antigua and Barbuda. By mid-2000 CryptoLogic software was used by over 500,000 online casino end users worldwide and processed over $4 billion in online transactions. CryptoLogic was listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange in September 1998 and on the NASDAQ stock exchange in March 2000, both during Rivkin's tenure as CEO. Citing a desire to allow new leadership to take the company to the next level, Rivkin stepped down as CEO of CryptoLogic in January 2001 but remained on the company's board of directors. In 2002, after Rivkin stepped down as CEO, the Canadian business magazine Profit estimated CryptoLogic experienced a 26,181 percent growth rate over the previous five years, which made it the fastest-growing business in Canada during that period. Also in 2002 CryptoLogic was named the top company in the Profit 200.

Hankey was the son of Thomson Hankey from Portland Place in London, and his wife Martha, the daughter of Benjamin Harrison from Clapham Common. He became a merchant in the City of London and a director the Bank of England, serving first as its Deputy Governor and then as its Governor from 1851 to 1853. In June 2020 the Bank of England issued a public apology for the involvement of Hankey, amongst other employees, in the slave trade following the investigation by the Centre for the Study of the Legacies of British Slave-ownership at UCL. At the 1852 general election, Hankey unsuccessfully contested the borough of Boston in Lincolnshire. He then contested the by-election in June 1853 for the City of Peterborough, where he lost by a margin of 21 votes (out of a total 451) to the Liberal George Hammond Whalley.Craig, pages 237‚Äì238 Whalley had been returned for Peterborough at a by-election in December 1852, but an election petition was lodged and his election was subsequently declared void on 8 June 1853 on the grounds that Whalley had been complicit in the \\"treating\\" of voters. After his second by-election win, a further petition was lodged, and a committee of the House of Commons found that Whalley's election was invalid, because he had been disqualified as a result of the previous void election. The seat was therefore awarded to Hankey, who was declared duly elected on 14 August 1853. Hankey was re-elected in 1857, 1859 and 1865, but was defeated at the 1868 general election by the Liberal William Wells. He was re-elected in 1874, but was defeated in 1880. His name was discussed in early 1882 as a possible candidate for any future vacancy in Peterborough, but when Hampden Whalley resigned in June 1883, Hankey did not contest the resulting by-election, and did not stand again thereafter. He was also a Justice of the Peace (JP) for Middlesex, Kent and the City of London, and a member of Commission of lieutenancy for the City of London. He died on 13 January 1893, aged 88. In his later years, his advanced age prevented him from taking any active part in public life.

The Hundred Guilder Print is an etching by Rembrandt. The etching's popular name derives from the large sum of money supposedly once paid for an example. It is also called Christ healing the sick, Christ with the Sick around Him, Receiving Little Children, or Christ preaching, since the print depicts multiple events from Matthew 19, including Christ healing the sick, debating with scholars and calling on children to come to him. The rich young man mentioned in the chapter is leaving through the gateway on the right., Rijksmuseum. Retrieved 4 September 2011. Aert de Gelder, a Rembrandt pupil, portrayed himself holding this print, c. 1700 Rembrandt worked on the Hundred Guilder Print in stages throughout the 1640s, and it was the \\"critical work in the middle of his career\\", from which his final etching style began to emerge.Christopher White, The Late Etchings of Rembrandt, (London: British Museum/Lund Humphries, 1969) pp. 6-10. He probably completed it in 1649. Although the print only survives in two states, the first very rare, evidence of much reworking can be seen underneath the final print and many drawings survive for elements of it. Wieseman describes the etching as a \\"technical tour de force, incorporating an enormous diversity of printmaking styles and techniques\\": > The group of figures at the left side of the print, for example, is deftly > indicated with a minimum of lightly bitten lines; in contrast, the evocative > richness of the blacks and the depth of tone in the right half of the print > represents Rembrandt's experimental competition with the newly discovered > mezzotint technique. The Baillie Print Around 1775, Captain William Baillie printed a 100 impression edition of an extensively re-worked, by his own hand, version of Rembrandt's original copper plate. He acquired the plate, already worn down by repeated printings, from the painter and engraver John Greenwood. As an engraver himself, Biallie attempted to restore the work, but his effort was considered \\"hard and unfeeling, lacking all the subtleties of Rembrandt's own work\\". After his edition, Baillie cut the plate into four pieces, reworked them further, and had them printed as separate images. To the reduced center fragment with Christ, he added the frame of an arch. Known locations While the number of copies printed by Rembrandt and subsequent owners is unknown, the Hundred Guilder Print is not rare by the standards of Rembrandt prints, though the quality of impressions varies considerably.

It was co-developed by Konami and Winkysoft, and designed by Zone of the Enders director Noriaki Okamura. The game is set in late 19th-century Paris, and follows the eponymous protagonist, archaeologist Doctor Lautrec, on his quest for a hidden treasure of the Bourbon dynasty. Gameplay Doctor Lautrec and the Forgotten Knights is played on the Nintendo 3DS. The game progresses as the player navigates the environment, puts together clues, and solves puzzles. Plot Doctor Lautrec and the Forgotten Knights takes place in Paris at the end of the 19th century, during the Belle √âpoque. The protagonist of the game, the eccentric and mystery-solving archaeologist Doctor Jean-Pierre Lautrec, is a lecturer at the city's Museum of Natural History. Together with his assistant Sophie Coubertin, a university student, he comes into possession of a map that leads to a hidden treasure of Louis XIV of France. On their quest through Paris and the catacombs beneath it, Doctor Lautrec and Sophie are pursued by a crime syndicate and the Knights of the Iron Mask, an order of knights with iron masks and claws. Development Doctor Lautrec and the Forgotten Knights was designed, written, directed and produced by Zone of the Enders director Noriaki Okamura. It was co-developed by Konami and Winkysoft, and marked Okamura's first experience with the stereoscopic three-dimensional graphics of the Nintendo 3DS handheld console. The game shares many aesthetic, and story similarities to Level-5's Professor Layton series of adventure games, and Okamura said he is inspired by that series. Reception The game was met with mixed reception. The UK Official Nintendo Magazine stated that the game had a lot of work put into it, but in general, slowly falls into repetition. The game also received a 69% \\"average\\" rating from the magazine. They also noted its overt similarities to the Professor Layton series, and often referred to the game as a flagrant rip-off of the aforementioned franchise that is clearly intended to \\"cash-in\\" on its success.

Sheridan He came to the United States as a result of his participation in the Revolutions of 1848, and settled in Missouri. He was appointed colonel of the 2nd Missouri Infantry and assigned to the Army of the Southwest. His regiment was part of the understrength 2nd Division commanded by Brig. Gen. Alexander Asboth. By seniority of his rank, Schaefer assumed command of the 1st Brigade.Shea p.332 During the battle of Pea Ridge, Asboth's division was primarily held in reserved. On the second day of the battle, Schaefer's brigade took part in Franz Sigel's counterattack.Shea p.237 After the Union victory at Pea Ridge much of the Army of the Southwest was transferred to the Western Army Group commanded by Henry Halleck. Asboth's division was decreased to a brigade status in the Army of the Mississippi. Schaefer returned to regimental command during the siege of Corinth. During the Kentucky Campaign, Schaefer was on sick leave and his regiment was led by Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Laiboldt. When Schaefer returned to command he was once again the ranking officer in his brigade. He assumed command of the 2nd Brigade in Philip H. Sheridan's 3rd Division of the XIV Corps. During the battle of Stones River Schaefer's brigade was initially held in reserve of Sheridan's division. His men were soon on the front lines and eventually began to run low on ammunition. Not having an adequate supply on hand, Sheridan ordered his brigade commanders to fix bayonets and continue to resist the Confederate attacks. Sheridan's division was hard pressed throughout the first day of the battle and Schaefer became Sheridan's fourth brigade commander to fall in battle. Notes =References= * Shea, William & Earl Hess.

The Luxborough Galley was an English ship involved in a notorious maritime incident during the 18th century.  Last voyage  The vessel, commanded by William Kellaway, was 340 tonne and fitted to carry 26 guns. She was employed by the South Sea Company in a triangular trade route, transporting cotton goods, slaves and rum between England, Africa and the Americas. The delivery of enslaved people to the Spanish territories was made under the conditions stipulated in the Assiento contract. The disastrous journey had seen one third of the human cargo, 600 African slaves, die from smallpox before they were delivered. Having left England in October 1725, her end came in the mid-Atlantic on 25 June 1727; she caught fire while carrying rum and sugar on the return leg to England and sank. The testimony of William Boys is often referred to in later notices; he was a 24-year-old second mate on the voyage, having already served with the Royal Navy for ten years. The vessel left Jamaica on 23 June, being destined for England on the final leg of the journey. Her position two days later was determined to be latitude 41¬∞ 45' north, longitude 20¬∞ 30 east, from Crooked Island, Bahamas when the final disaster struck. The cause was reported as resulting from the actions of two youths, described as \\"black boys\\", who were in the hold of the ship when they noticed liquid on the floor. Fearing this was water leaking from a keg, they held a candle to it to investigate; the substance turned out to be rum and it quickly caught fire. The two boys then hid themselves, afraid of the consequences of their actions. At half past twelve the captain's cook noticed flames emerging from the forecastle, as he raised the alarm a keg exploded and filled the hold with flames. Several members of the crew attempted to quench the fire with water, even stripping their clothing to smother the flames, but the hold had become an inferno. The deck overhead was breached in an attempt to douse the flames, this allowed air to enter, increasing the intensity of the fire, and the front of the ship was soon ablaze. During the conflagration the panic-stricken captain and some crew had fallen to their knees and prayed, expecting at any moment that the gunpowder below the fire would explode; others sought to escape on a yawl that had been hurriedly launched. The sixteen foot boat contained three oars, its fourth was lost, but held no other equipment or provisions. The Luxborough Galley was equipped with a longboat, but despite the efforts of some of the crew, it could not be launched, most likely because the tackle had caught fire. The smaller boat was filled beyond its regular capacity, 22 men and boys; when this was under-way there were sixteen persons left behind. The yawl was turned into the waves to avoid swamping, putting distance between any salvage or survivors. The huddled occupants watched the Luxborough continue to burn to the waterline and eventually explode.  Survivors  The survivors, with improvised sail, in the mid-Atlantic. Cleveley, c. 1727.BHC2385, Luxenborough Galley, yawl National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, London The escape on the boat left those fleeing in a precarious situation, with no food or water, no compass, and ill-prepared for an ocean voyage to safety. Some of those on board the yawl, decrying their predicament, proposed to relieve their craft's burden by casting the alleged instigators of the blaze, the two boys, into the ocean. This was overruled, and the captain vetoed a proposal to settle the matters by allotment. The later deaths of some occupants made this unnecessary. The Luxboroughs crew were adrift for two weeks, and their number was reduced to twelve before their rescue by fishermen off the coast of Newfoundland. The captain died the next day. They were tended to by their rescuers before setting out for a major port. Only five men reached this destination; one man went to New England and the rest reached London on 14 October. Of the few survivors, William Boys survived to the age of 74; the surgeon, Scrimsour, to 80; and George Mould died at Greenwich Hospital aged 82. The gruesome details of the survivors of the Luxborough Galley appeared in notices in newspapers. In September, the Evening Post and others reprinted the ghoulish report of the Boston Gazette. An account of the incident was the subject of a 1787 book by William Boys, the son of one survivor, Commodore William Boys, R.N. (‚Äì1774), who had risen through the ranks to become lieutenant-governor of Greenwich Hospital.Boys, William, 1787 An account of the loss of the Luxborough Galley, / electronic resource by fire, on her voyage from Jamaica to London: with the sufferings of her crew, in the year 1727. By William Boys printed for J. Johnson, London : The Penny Magazine of 1834 reproduced part of Boys' narrative, comparing it to the later disaster of the sinking of Royal George. The narrative detailed the journey leading up to the sinking, and the means by which they navigated, improvised a sail, and obtained a meagre amount of water. The frank account of the fifth day of the voyage gave the recipe for their continued survival, > The sensation of hunger was not so urgent, but we all saw the necessity of > recruiting our bodies with some more substantial nourishment, and it was at > this time we found ourselves impelled to adopt the horrible expedient of > eating part of the bodies of our dead companions, and drinking their blood. > Our surgeon, Mr. Scrimsour, a man of the utmost humanity, first suggested > the idea, and, resolute to set us an example, ate the first morsel himself; > but, at the second mouthful, turned his face away from as many as he could > and wept. With great reluctance we brought ourselves to try different parts > of the bodies of six, but could relish only the hearts, of which we ate > three. We drank the blood of four. By cutting the throat a little while > after death, we collected a little more than a pint from each body. Here I > cannot but mention the particular respect shown by the men to the officers, > for the men who were employed in the melancholy business of collecting the > blood in a pewter bason that was in the boat, and the rest of the people, > would never touch a drop till the captain, surgeon, and myself had taken as > much as we thought proper. And I can truly affirm, we were so affected by > this strong instance of their regard that we always left them a larger share > than of right belonged to them. This expedient, so shocking in relation, and > so distressing to us in the use, was undoubtedly the means of preserving > those who survived, as we constantly found ourselves refreshed and > invigorated by this nourishment, however unnatural. We often saw birds > flying over our heads, and fish playing round the boat's stern, which we > strove to catch with our hat-bands knotted together, and a pin for a hook, > baited with a piece of the dead men's bodies; but with all our contrivance > could not catch either fish or bird. John Nichols mentions Boys' work in his Literary Anecdotes, and ends his retelling of the events by remarking on the \\"very great age\\" of the few survivors. A series of paintings detailing the events was displayed by the younger Boys in his parlour, according to Thomas Pennant. Another series of small paintings, attributed to John Cleveley the Elder in 1727, are assumed to be reproductions of the same; these were acquired by the Greenwich Hospital and are now part of their collection held at the National Maritime Museum. A history of the hospital reproduces the rarer published account by the younger Boys.History of Greenwich Hospital, by John Cooke and John Maule, 1789, pp. 110 et seq.

December 1989) was a Belgian musicologist, pianist, and conductor of Flemish background. Through concerts and radio broadcastings, he played an important role in the popularization of 20th century music in Belgium. An early proponent of period instruments practice, he dedicated his last years to ethnomusicology.  Life  Collaer was born in a musical family. His parents, teachers and music lovers, raised him in Mechelen where he studied piano and harmony at the local music school (later renamed a conservatory). He also studied chemistry, receiving a doctorate from the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles (1909-1914). Collaer was an avid follower of Belgian musical life, attending operas at the theatre of La Monnaie, and concerts at the Concerts du Conservatoire, the Concerts Ysa√øe, and the Concerts Populaires. From 1911, encouraged by his piano teacher √âmile Bosquet, who was an early music lover, Collaer gave a dozen lecture-recitals focused on that repertoire. During the War, he was drafted and assigned to a surveillance position on the Yser river, but he developed pneumonia and was evacuated to Davos in 1917. There he met Ferruccio Busoni and Karol Szymanowski, played chamber music with the Ros√© Quartet and accompanied the violinist Joseph Szigeti. In Davos he also met Elsa Meyer, whom he married in 1919, on the day when his return to Belgium was officially approved. In 1919, Paul Collaer attended a series of lectures given by Jean Cocteau in Brussels about new poets and new musicians. There he met Darius Milhaud with whom he would maintain a long friendship. For some years, Collaer served as supervisor at secondary schools in Ixelles, and later as professor of chemistry in Mechelen. In 1920, he resumed his lecture-recitals interrupted in 1914 because of the war. The new programs featured more contemporary music, including works by Francis Poulenc, Darius Milhaud, Georges Auric, Maurice Delage, and Igor Stravinski. A strong advocate of modern music (particularly from France), he founded in 1921 in Brussels the Pro-Arte concerts. Musical Director of the Flemish station at Belgian Radio from 1937 to 1953, he spent his last years mainly into ethnomusicological research. Under his influence, the Cercle International d'√©tudes ethno-musicologiques was founded.
