She is a former Member of Parliament and founding member and former secretary-general of the Namibian Congress of Democrats (CoD). A prominent voice on gender issues, human-rights violations, and violence against women and children in Namibia, she is the director of Woman Solidarity Namibia and works at the Dolam Residential Child Care centre, a day-care centre for vulnerable children. Early life and education Namises was born on 20 April 1958 as one of nine children to an Angolan father and Damara mother in the Old Location of Windhoek, the capital of Namibia. She grew up with her father until she was 15 years old and attended the Augustineum Secondary School in Windhoek. After graduating she worked first as a cleaner, then as a nursing assistant, and in parallel she completed her matric through a correspondence course with Sukses College. Her political activism first landed her in jail and then led her into exile, conditions that forced her to discontinue her education. Only in 1990 when Namibia became independent did she continue to study. She obtained a Diploma in Adult and Basic Education from UNISA and a Diploma in Gender Development and Planning from the University of London. She further holds a Diploma in Women in Management, has had some paralegal education, and acquired counselling and facilitation skills. Political career In the early 1980s Namises joined the then-illegal SWAPO party. She organised meetings, acquired new members, and distributed promotional material. She was caught and spent two months in solitary confinement but soon returned to her activist's activities. In 1985 she lost her job in the hospital after having been seen holding hands in public with a white doctor, violating apartheid legislation on racial segregation. She was also jailed a second time for her political activities, this time for 14 months. Once released she was offered a job by the Catholic Church as community development officer. In the same year Ben Ulenga was released from Robben Island prison. Namises and Ulenga met and became a couple soon thereafter. When she was pregnant with their second child in 1987 but they still refused to marry each other, Namises was fired. She also abandoned her Catholic faith at that time, and for that reason. Namises then went into exile and worked in Europe and America. She only returned after the Independence of Namibia in 1990. Not long thereafter several past human rights violations by SWAPO were uncovered. When the party subsequently erected a wall of silence instead of reappraising what had happened, Namises ceased her SWAPO membership in 1992. When the Congress of Democrats (CoD) was founded in 1999, Namises was one of its founding members. In the subsequent parliamentary elections, the CoD gained seven seats, and Namises as secretary- general became a Member of Parliament for the 3rd National Assembly. When the CoD only gained five seats in the next elections in 2004, Namises was one of the politicians not to return to parliament. However, after the party expelled Nora Schimming-Chase in 2009, Namises took her seat for the remainder of the legislative period. Activism As Namises went in and out of politics, she spent the time in between as an activist and lobbyist. Her first formal role was her work at the Legal Assistance Centre in the early 1990s, a job she took after quitting SWAPO. She helped to discover and fight human rights violations there, a step she described as \\"revenge\\". She is the director of Woman Solidarity Namibia, an organisation fighting violence against women and children. Namises is also the founder and main operator of Dolam Residential Child Care, a day-care facility for vulnerable children. There are 21 children at the centre.

Activism and arrest  = Context = Following the 2012 coup in Mali and the political instability that followed, Islamist insurgents alongside Tuareg fighters began to make strategic gains. A force of 4,000 French soldiers intervened on January 11. Seven days later a cease-fire agreement was signed between Tuareg fighters and government forces; despite continuing and sporadic terrorist attacks the intervention was considered successful. France's intervention in the Mali conflict came only two years after their involvement in NATO air-strikes against Muammar Gaddafi‚Äôs government forces in Libya. = Letter to French embassy = On January 28th, 2013 al-Matroushi, along with 150 other activists submitted a request to Qatar‚Äôs interior ministry to orchestrate a protest in front of the French embassy in Doha. The protest was intended to criticize France‚Äôs planned military intervention in Mali. The activists‚Äô request to hold a protest was denied. Instead, al-Matroushi and a fellow activist, Mohammad Issa al-Baker, delivered a letter to the embassy which directly addressed the French ambassador.https://www.scribd.com/doc/132849713/Qatari-activists-letter-to- the-French-Embassy The letter, which would later be described as ‚Äúthreatening‚Äù by Qatari authorities, was handed to the French on behalf of 70 activists, whose signatures were not included. The tone of the letter in question is undoubtedly hostile towards French presence in not only Mali, but North Africa as well, claiming that ‚Äúit is common knowledge that the crimes [France] committed in Algeria martyred more than a million Muslim persons‚Äù. It goes on to state that France is currently killing and torturing Malian Muslims, describing its policies as ‚Äúterrorist‚Äù and ‚Äúracist‚Äù. Perhaps the letter's most alarming statement comes in the form of a warning: ‚ÄúWe demand that you immediately cease your military campaign in Mali or else you would be exposing yourselves to the wrath of people who love death as much as you love life‚Äù. Within four days of receiving the letter, the French embassy reported it to Qatari authorities on March 7, but refused to comment publicly. = Arrest, detention, and release = In the weeks following delivery of the letter, al- Matroushi had received multiple phone calls from state officials questioning him about his activism and recent activities; he was summoned to report for questioning by authorities but refused. On the 22nd of March both al-Matroushi and al-Baker were arrested by plain clothed officers on their way back from a family trip in Mesaieed (approximately 30 miles south of Doha). The two men were held in solitary confinement with no official charge, and were re- questioned about the nature of the letter. Sultan al-Khalaifi, a fellow- activist, was quoted defending the letter, saying ‚Äúthe letter we sent to the French embassy carried no threat. It was advice‚Äù. Al-Khalaifi was previously associated with Alkarama after his 2011 arrest by Qatari authorities. After numerous appeals and petitions sent by Amnesty International and other human rights groups, the two men were released on April 18, but were subject to a travel-ban. Al-Matroushi later requested permission to travel to Egypt in order to pursue his education which was granted. = Controversies and ties to extremism = Al-Matroushi's close associate, al-Baker, has been tied to two U.S. designated al-Qaeda financiers and a purported charity that served as a fundraising mechanism for the Al-Nusra Front (al-Qaeda's branch in Syria). Despite his alleged travel ban, Al-Baker appears in a video of a 2014 aid shipment into Syria (14), furthermore a video was uploaded from Bakr's Twitter account which appears to have been recorded in Turkey. The video promotes Madad Ahl al-Sham, featuring collections and deliveries intended for Syria.https://twitter.com/Boessa73/status/439961948545769473 Madad Ahl al-Sham was openly endorsed by Nusra Front fighters as well the group's official social media accounts. Al-Baker also posted to his Twitter account the phone numbers of Sa‚Äôad bin Sa‚Äôad al-Ka‚Äôabi and Abd al-Latif bin 'Abdullah al-Kawari. Both al-Ka‚Äôabi and al-Kawari were designated as al-Qaeda financiers and facilitators in 2015. Additionally, Al-Matroushi is associated with Alkarama, which advocated for Matroushi during his detention by authorities. The organization itself has been listed as a terrorist entity by the United Arab Emirates and two of its three founding members, Abdel Rahman al-Nuaymi and Abdul Wahab al-Humayqani, have been designated by the United States government as financiers of terror in 2013. Moreover, Alkarama's legal director, Rachid Mesli, was arrested in Italy on August 19, 2015 under an Algerian warrant through Interpol for his connection to the Islamic Salvation Front.

She teaches creative writing and literature at University of Houston‚ÄìDowntown. Moshiri has published five books of fiction: At the Wall of the Almighty (Interlink, 1999), The Bathhouse (Black Heron Press, 2001, Beacon Press, 2002), The Crazy Dervish and the Pomegranate Tree (Black Heron Press, 2004), Against Gravity (Penguin, 2006), and The Drum Tower (Black Heron Press and Sandstone Press {U.K}, 2014). Among other grants, fellowships, and literary awards, Moshiri is the recipient of Barthelme Memorial Award, C. Glenn Cambor/Inprint Fellowship: Presented by Inprint, Inc., Two Barbara Deming Awards (a grant for feminist writers whose work speaks of peace and social justice, two consecutive Black Heron Awards for Social Fiction, and Valiente (courage) Award from Voices Breaking Boundaries for artists who have taken risks to speak out and act as advocates. Her third novel, Against Gravity, was chosen by Barnes and Noble for Discover New Writer Series and by Borders Books in Original Voices selections. Moshiri has spoken about her work and writing in exile at Columbia University, West Carolina University, Syracuse University, Bronx Community College, University of Houston Campuses, Rice University, Lone Star College Campuses, Houston Community College Campuses, San Jacinto College, University of the Incarnate Word (San Antonio), Asia Society, AWP Conference, Voices Breaking Boundaries, and more. In 2012, in collaboration with the composer, Gregory Spears, she created a chamber opera by the name of \\"The Bricklayer\\" commissioned by the Houston Grand opera. The world premier was on March 16, 2012. Moshiri has been a professor of literature, drama, and creative writing in College of Dramatic Arts of Tehran, Houston Community College, Lone Star College, Kabul University, Syracuse University, and the University of Houston‚ÄìDowntown. She lives and writes in Houston.  Early life and education  Moshiri grew up in a literary family. Her uncle, Fereydoon Moshiri was one of the most prominent and popular poets of Iran. Moshiri wrote fiction and poetry since she was a child. Her first short story was published in \\"Sokhan\\" (one the prestigious literary periodicals of pre-revolutionary Iran) when she was eighteen-years old. She was also a ballet dancer and a member of the National Iranian Ballet Company, where she danced in major classical ballet performances in the 60s and the early 70s. Moshiri left the ballet company to study playwriting at the College of Dramatic Arts. During the 70s, she wrote plays and short stories and went onstage as actress. In 1977, with a scholarship, she entered the graduate studies of drama at the University of Iowa. In 1979, after receiving master's degree in dramatic literature, she returned to Iran to teach at the College of Dramatic Arts. In this period, she wrote plays and short stories, and published translated literature from English into Persian. In 1983, the rehearsals of her full-length play were interrupted by the guards and the director and actors were arrested. She was purged from her job as a professor and a dramaturg and had no way other than exile. She left the country on foot, living in the refugee camps of Afghanistan and India. In the summer of 1986 she received right of asylum from the U.S. and a few months later entered the graduate program of creative writing at the University of Houston, where she received MFA in Fiction. She published novels and stories, taught literature, and held fiction workshops for the decades to come.

It includes portions of Brodmann areas BA8, BA9, BA10, BA24 and BA32, although some authors identify it specifically with BA8 and BA9 Some notable sub-components include the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (BA24 and BA32), the prelimbic cortex, and the infralimbic cortex.  Functions  Evidence shows that the dmPFC plays several roles in humans. The dmPFC is identified to play roles in processing a sense of self, integrating social impressions, theory of mind, morality judgments, empathy, decision making, altruism, fear and anxiety information processing, and top-down motor cortex inhibition (Gusnard, Akbudak, Shulman, & Raichle2001; Ferrari et al., 2016; Narayanan & Laubach, 2006; Waytz, Zaki, & Mitchell 2012; Mitchell, Banaji, & Macrae, 2005 in Ferrari et al., 2016). The dmPFC also modulates or regulates emotional responses and heart rate in situations of fear or stress and plays a role in long-term memory (Corsi & Christen, 2012; Decety & Batson, 2007). Some argue that the dmPFC is made up of several smaller subregions that are more task-specific (Eickhoff, Laird, Fox, Bzdok, & Hensel, 2016). The dmPFC is attributed with many roles in the brain. Despite this, there is no definitive understanding of the exact role dmPFC plays, and the underlying mechanisms giving rise to its function(s) in the brain remain to be seen. = Identity = The dmPFC is thought to be one component of how people formulate an identity, or a sense of self (Gusnard et al., 2001; Meares, 2012). When actors were tasked with performing a character, fMRI scans showed relative suppression of the dmPFC compared to baseline tasks (Brown, Cockett, & Yuan, 2019). This same deactivation was not seen in the other tasks performed by the actors. The authors theorize that this may be due to the actors actively suppressing their own sense of self in order to portray another character. Similarly, the dmPFC has been shown to be inactive in individuals with psychological disassociation (Meares, 2012). = Social judgements and theory of mind = Mitchell et al. (2005, in Ferrari et al., 2016) indicated that the dmPFC plays a role in creating social impressions. One study showed that by using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the dmPFC during a social judgment task directly disrupts a person‚Äôs ability to form social judgments (Ferrari et al., 2016). Additionally, the dmPFC is active when people are trying to understand the perspectives, beliefs, and thoughts of others; this is known as Theory of Mind (Isoda & Noritake, 2013). The dmPFC has also been shown to play a role in altruism. The amount that a person‚Äôs dmPFC was active during a socially-based task predicted how much money that person would later donate to others (Waytz, Zaki, & Mitchell, 2012). Furthermore, the dmPFC has been shown to be play a role in morality decisions (Bzdok et al., 2012). = Emotion = The dmPFC has been shown to be involved in voluntary and involuntary emotional regulation (Ford & Kensinger, 2019; Phillips, Ladouceur, & Drevets, 2008). When recalling negative memories, older adults show activation in the dmPFC. This is believed to act as mechanism that reduces the overall experienced negativity of the event (Ford & Kensinger, 2019). The dmPFC is thought to be impaired in individuals diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder resulting in disrupted emotional regulation (Phillips et al., 2008). = Decision making = In addition to social judgments, the dmPFC shows increased activation during complex decision making tasks. (Venkatraman, Rosati, Taren, & Huettel, 2009). Other studies have shown increased activation in the dmPFC when a person must decide between two equally-likely outcomes, as well as when a decision is counter to their behavioral tendencies (Pochon et al., 2008 and Paulus et al., 2002 in Venkatraman et al., 2009)  Other species  The DMPFC can also be identified in monkeys. The prelimbic system in mice is believed to be functionally analogous to the dmPFC's emotional regulation function in humans. = Animal models = In rats, the dmPFC has been shown to exert top-down control over the motor regions, although the exact mechanisms of how this is accomplished remain unknown (Narayanan & Laubach, 2006). Researchers have shown in mice that the dmPFC 5-HT6 receptors play a role in regulating anxiety-like behaviors (Geng et al., 2018). Another study looked at how dopamine receptors in the dmPFC play a role in regulating fear in rats (Stubbendorff, Hale, Cassaday, Bast, & Stevenson, 2019) See also * Self-model theory of subjectivity References * Brown, S., Cockett, P., & Yuan, Y.

It was launched in June 2016 as a free mobile app. It debuted on iOS on Apple App Store during the first week of June and it became the leading app at the App Store in Russia and other neighboring countries. A week after its launch, the app received over 7.5 million downloads. It had over 1 million active users as of July 2016. On 19 July, 2016, the developer launched a beta version of the app for Android, which the developers closed a few hours later after receiving feedback from users. This version was released publicly on 24 July, 2016 on Google Play. In July 2016, the developer announced a video and virtual reality version of the app was under development. On 7 July, 2017, Prisma launched a new app called Sticky which turns selfies into stickers for sharing to social feeds. History The app was created by the team led by Alexey Moiseenkov who also founded the Prisma labs, based in Moscow. Moiseenkov previously worked at Mail.Ru and later resigned from his job to dedicate his time to the development of the app. He has said that the development of the app took one and a half months and the team did not do anything to promote the app. The algorithm that powers the app is based on the open source programming and algorithms behind DeepArt. Features Users can upload pictures and select a variety of filters to transform the picture with an artistic effect. At launch, the app offered twenty different filters. Additional filters are added daily. In July 2016, Moiseenkov stated that the app will offer forty filters by the end of the month. The image rendering takes place in Prisma labs's servers and uses a neural network with artificial intelligence to add the artistic effect. The result is delivered back to the user's phone. Unlike other photo editing apps, Prisma renders the image by going through different layers and recreating the image rather than inserting a layer over the image. In August 2016, the iOS version of the app was updated to edit image offline by utilizing the phone's processor for image rendering. Reception =Downloads= One week after its debut on iOS App Store, the app was downloaded over 7.5 million times and received over 1 million active users. It also became the top listed app in Russia and its neighboring countries. In the end of July 2016, it was installed over 12.5 million devices with over 1.5 million active users worldwide. According to App Annie, it was listed in the top 10 apps on the App Store in 77 different countries. Image of Maynooth University captured through prisma On the first day of the Android version release, it received over 1.7 million downloads with 50 million pictures processed by the app. Research and technology The research paper behind the Prisma App technology is called \\"A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style\\" by Leon Gatys, Alexander Ecker and Matthias Bethge and was presented at the premier machine learning conference: Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) in 2015. The technology is an example of a Neural Style Transfer algorithm. This technology used in Prisma was developed independently and before Prisma, and both the university and the company have no affiliation with one another. Further recent work developed by Stanford University, titled Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution by Justin Johnson, Alexandre Alahi and Li Fei-Fei, has also been able to create real-time style transfer through video. The code for the previous papers is available at no charge at GitHub for research purposes.https://github.com/jcjohnson/fast-neural-style  See also  *DeepArt *List of Prisma (app) filters References External links 2016 software Mobile software Photo software Video software IOS software Android (operating system) software Neural network software Companies based in Moscow ","title":"Prisma (app)"},{"id":"51113880","text":"The following lists events that happened in 1962 in Iceland.

Godfrey and his brother took the cross in 1096 were among many leading knights from Walloon and the Lotharingian territories that joined the army of Godfrey of Bouillon in the First Crusade. These included Godfrey‚Äôs brothers and their cousin Baldwin of Le Bourg, Baldwin II of Hainaut, Rainald of Toul, Giselbert of Clermont, Warner of Grez, Baldwin of Stavelot, Peter of Stenay, Dodo of Cons, and Conon of Montaigu and his sons and heirs Gozelo II and Lambert. Godfrey was chosen to negotiate the passage of the crusading army through Hungary. The first three armies passing through Hungary resulting in calamitous slaughters, and the king Coloman the Learned was determined to not repeat these disasters. In September 1096, Godfrey successfully negotiated the passage of the army through Hungary, but the price was high. The family of Godfrey of Bouillon was required to be held hostage until the army had passed. The incident apparently greatly enhanced the standing of Coloman in the eyes of European royalty. As Henry and Baldwin hurried to Constantinople in search of booty, Godfrey and the others would arrive shortly thereafter. Emperor Alexios I Komnenos and Godfrey differed on the goals of the crusade, and Godfrey was unwilling to agree to the emperor‚Äôs demands prior to the main force of Crusaders that would shortly arrive in the Holy Land. Godfrey sent his cousin Baldwin of Le Bourg, Conon of Montaigu, and Godfrey (of Esch) to the palace to meet with Alexios, but with no resolution of the conflict. A charter dated February 1098 by Emperor Henry IV relating to the abbey of Nivelles indicate the both Godfrey and his brother Henry had returned from the crusades. There is no further reference to them in the histories. It is uncertain whether Godfrey had any children, although Godfrey II, Count of Esch, could have been his son.

It was built in the late 16th century, and it produced bread for the inhabitants of Valletta and the surrounding area, as well as for the Order's garrison and navy. It remained in use by the French and later the British militaries, until a new Royal Naval Bakery was opened in Birgu in 1845. The bakery was subsequently converted into stores, before falling into disrepair. The building was demolished in the early 20th century to make way for Vincenti Buildings. The bakery gave its name to Old Bakery Street, one of the main streets of Valletta. History =Background= The first prominent bakeries for the Order were built in Birgu in 1545.https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/bitstream/123456789/51888/10/Orizzont_Dawra%20Kulturali%20mal- Port%20il-Kbir%20%2811%29.pdf In 1566 Architect Francesco Laparelli designed a plan for a new city, Valletta, where all public and prominent buildings were to be in a reserved area. Among these buildings were the Forni della Sacra Religione. Small individual bakeries were first built on site, which had existed since the 1570s. These bakeries were built during the magistracy of Grand Master Jean de la Cassi√®re at his own expense, and were known in Italian as the Forni pubblici della religione (Public Bakeries of the Religion). The bakeries were among the first erected buildings in Valletta. According to Leonard Mahoney (1988), similar to the first buildings of Valletta, these bakeries were built for convenience of the first wave of workers and migrants rather than keeping also in mind the aesthetic appeal of architecture. Thus, these bakeries can be considered to have had a vernacular architecture to a certain extant. The reserved area, generally known as the collachio, was toyed about for years and was eventually abandoned as it proved not practical for business, administration and the rest of inhabitants of the city. However, more or less, the mentioned buildings occupied the designated area. =Construction and use= The Order's bakery was being planned by 1582 and an engraving by Matteo Perez d‚ÄôAleccio of Valletta including the planned bakery was drawn up that year. The building was marked as Il Forno d.la Signoria et l‚ÄôArmaria, meaning part of the building had to also include an armoury to serve in case of a siege. This also because it was mainly intended to serve the military. It was eventually built in around 1583 or 1584, during the magistracy of Grand Master Hugues Loubenx de Verdalle. The building was designed by Maltese architect Girolamo Cassar, who also designed many other buildings in Valletta. As planned, the building was used primarily for the making of bread, while another part of the edifice was used as an armoury or ferreria. Other food products from similar ingredients of bread, such as biscuits, were also made. In the 17th century a mill room was added to the building. Interior of the bakery while still in use during the British period The building was property of the Treasury of the Order, and under the responsibility of the Castellan. The building was rented, each part to different owners, however was administered by one person known as Commendatore dei Forni (Bakeries‚Äô Commander). The owners were to sell bread at an estabslished price. The bakery produced most of the bread for the inhabitants of Valletta and Floriana, as well as for the Order's hospital, prison, galleys and garrison. Some of the expenses for the operation of the bakery were relieved as a number of slaves were engaged in forced unpaid labour. Only trusted slaves were allowed to work at the bakery. However, after the revolt of the slaves during the magistry of Grand Master Manuel Pinto da Fonseca, none of the slaves were trusted in important buildings such as the bakery which provided traditional everyday food. The incident followed by a shortage of bakers in Valletta that villages bakers were ordered to do so on site and those who refused to bake bread in the city were jailed by the Castellania for a roughly a week. The building gave its name to Strada Forni, now Old Bakery Street During the French occupation of Malta, the bakery was used to produce bread for the French garrison, and it was heavily guarded during the blockade of 1798‚Äì1800. At this point, the street where the bakery was located, originally called Strada San Giovanni Battista,https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_yK80AQAAMAAJ/bub_gb_yK80AQAAMAAJ_djvu.txt was renamed Rue des Fours after the bakery. It was later known as Strada Forni in Italian during the early British period, and since 1926 it has been called Old Bakery Street. It is known as Triq il-Fran or Triq l-Ifran in Maltese, but it is still commonly called Strada Forni by Valletta residents. This means that the bakery gives the name to a main street in the capital Valletta. At some point, during the British period, the building became known as the Forni Regii or the Majesty‚Äôs Bakery. It was also known as The King‚Äôs Bakery. In 1824 the upper floor, which housed the armoury, was handed over to the British military. The bakery remained in use throughout the early 19th century, supplying bread to the British military. The British Army prominently used it as a colonial department, which stored and supplied food for the troops stationed in Mallta, better known as the Commissariat. The British also used it for the grinding of corn. It fell out of use when the Royal Naval Bakery was opened in Birgu in 1845. It was initially used as stores, but the building fell into a state of disrepair. An English boy is said to have died when part of the building collapsed while he was playing there. =Demolition= The bakery was demolished in 1926. The Times of Malta published an article accompanied with a photo to inform the general public that the bakery was demolished and not destroyed by war. The newspaper stated: > No! this building has not suffered from an aerial bombardment; it is the > Knights' Bakery in Old Bakery Street that is in the process of demolition to > make way for a better and more imposing building. =Redevelopment and remains= The Vincenti Buildings, the place where the bakery stood In the mid-1930s the site was purchased by the architect Gustavo R. Vincenti. He raised a Modernism (Art Nouveau or simply an Art Deco) block, known as Vincenti Buildings after its architect in 1938. Vincenti Buildings were damaged during WWII but were faithfully repaired to the original design. Some of the residences have been converted into offices. In March 2010, Enemalta workers uncovered remains of the bakery's foundations during paving works in Strait Street. The remains consist of sections of a wall up to four courses high and laid on bedrock. Other remains were also found at Melita Street across Old Bakery Street. A detailed wooden model of the bakery, probably dating back to the British period, is found at the Heritage Malta reserve collection at the Inquisitor's Palace in Birgu. Architecture Interior of the building The bakery of the Order was located on a city block bordered by Old Bakery, Melita, St. John and Strait streets.More information available in source. Its main fa√ßade was in Old Bakery Street facing the Church of St. Augustine, and it consisted of a central bay with two sloped roofs, with three-storey high sections on either side. It had imposing corners, typical of Architect Cassar, which were characterised by large rusticated pilasters to support the massive building. The fa√ßade was asymmetric and had no moulding. It contained two main doorways, but there were other entrances in Strait Street. The exterior was plain, contrasting with other Valletta buildings, however this was typical when built. Though the exterior may not have had any aesthetically pleasing features, the interior was spacious and adequate for its purpose. Similar to other prominent buildings, the bakery was provided with water from the Wignacourt Aqueduct. The building did not suffer damage during the 1693 Sicily earthquake though, as documented, the surrounding buildings did.

The painting was inspired by streetlights at the Piazza Termini in Rome. History Lamp posts were a subject of Balla's work as early as 1900‚Äì1901. The iconography of a stylized street lamp appeared in a commercial poster in 1910, though it is not known if this work influenced Balla or vice versa. Other sources state that he was inspired to paint after seeing Rome's first electric street lights, the design of which were then universally regarded as looking pass√©ist. Though dated 1909, Street Light was most likely painted in the latter half of 1911, following Balla's rejection from an art exhibition in Milan. Fellow Futurist Umberto Boccioni encouraged Balla to continue his efforts in Futurism, with an eye to the 1912 Futurist exhibition at the Bernheim-Jeune Gallery in Paris. Though the work is mentioned in the catalog for that exhibition, it was not actually displayed there. The painting was later exhibited by Balla in 1928. The acquisition of the painting by the Museum of Modern Art in New York was publicly announced on October 17, 1954. The painting, catalogued as object number 7.1954, was included in exhibitions in 1954‚Äì55, 1961, 1964, 1971, 1984, and 2012‚Äì13. , it was not on permanent display. The museum also houses a pencil-and-ink study that Balla made for the painting. Context Painted around the time of the organization of the Futurist artists, the work may be seen as a response to Filippo Tommaso Marinetti's 1909 manifesto ' (Let's Kill the Moonlight!), in which Marinetti writes, \\"'\\" (\\"three hundred electric moons wiped out with their dazzling rays of plaster the ancient green queen of love.\\") Balla's painting is an analytical study of the patterns and colors of a beam of light; it typifies his exploration of light, atmosphere, and motion as a member of the Italian Divisionism movement, in which he was inspired by the Neo-Impressionism of Georges Seurat and Paul Signac. Bella stated of his painting, decades later, that it \\"demonstrated how romantic moonlight had been surpassed by the light of the modern electric street light. This was the end of Romanticism in art. From my picture came the phrase (beloved by the Futurists): 'We shall kill the light of the moon'.\\" Critical responses The work is described in the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica as a \\"dynamic depiction of light\\", conveying \\"a sense of speed and urgency that puts [Balla's] paintings in line with Futurism‚Äôs fascination with the energy of modern life.\\" It is said to reflect Balla's fascination with artificial light, and to encapsulate Balla's and the Futurists' conviction of the capacity of human endeavors to surpass nature. Chevrons of color radiate from the lamp \\"like flood waves crashing on a parched beach\\", overwhelming the light cast by the moon. Art critic Donald Kuspit describes the painting as a \\"crypto-scientific\\" study of the emotionally neutral sensation of light and color. In The End of Night: Searching for Natural Darkness in an Age of Artificial Light, author Paul Bogard contrasts the painting with Van Gogh's 1889 The Starry Night, also at the MoMA; while the latter depicts a deep and dynamic night sky, the sky in Balla's Street Light is submerged into the background by his celebrated artificial light.

In almost 30 years, the organization has grown from an all-volunteer nonprofit organization to one with a Board of Directors, Staff, and Advisory Council. Conference on Asian Pacific American Leadership (CAPAL)'s Official Logo CAPAL aims to promote AAPI interests and success in public service careers, to provide information and education on policy issues affecting the AAPI community, and to serve the AAPI community at large through its various programs offered throughout the year. Most notable of the programs and events are the Washington Leadership Program, Public Service Scholarship Program, Federal Internship Program, and Professional Development Program. Leadership =Board of Directors= CAPAL‚Äôs board consists of 17 early to mid-career professionals with diverse backgrounds who volunteer their time to guide the organization. They are overseen by an Executive Team led by an elected Chair. The Executive Team consists of the Chair, Secretary, Treasurer, and three Vice Chairs who in turn oversee each of the board's three committees. Board members serve on one of three board committees: the Programs Committee, Operations Committee, and Development Committee. While each board member is assigned to one of these three committees, all board members are expected to have a role in program oversight, organizational governance, and fundraising. Board members may also opt to participate in additional subcommittees. These subcommittees currently include the HR Committee, WLP Planning Committee, Communications Committee, Strategic Planning Committee, Scholar and Intern Application Review Committee, and Board Recruitment Committee. These subcommittees consist of board members, members of our Advisory Council, and external stakeholders, including CAPAL Board alumni. The Board of Directors is also assisted by CAPAL's general counsel, who is charged with assessing and ensuring the organization's legal compliance in the areas such as employment, contracts, and tax. =Staff= Current CAPAL staff consists of the Managing Director as well as the Programs and Operations Associate. The Managing Director and Programs and Operations Associate manage the organization's day-to-day operations. They act in support of the Board and their respective committees but also strive to expand on their own projects and goals for the organization. Board members are expected to work alongside staff by providing guidance and support in order to make sure that all organizational activities are proceeding as intended. =Advisory Council= The Advisory Council honors founders and influential AAPI community leaders who believe strongly in continuing their support for CAPAL, and is led by an elected Chair and Vice-Chair. These positions are voted in by members of the Advisory Council on a yearly basis. The Advisory Council keeps the Board connected to the wisdom of these individuals and assists the Board through its perspective, feedback, and sources. As leaders in the public, private and non-profit sectors, Advisory Council members continue to serve CAPAL in a variety of ways. Board members work with members of the Advisory Council in various capacities, primarily in strategic planning, outreach, and fundraising. The Advisory Council is updated with quarterly phone calls as well as an Annual Meeting and Reception with the Board, in which a high-level overview of the year‚Äôs accomplishments is shared. Programs =Washington Leadership Program= The Washington Leadership Program is a free panel-based summer series offered by CAPAL each year that is open to anyone who would like to attend in the DC area, particularly interns and young professionals. The series features Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) leaders within the DC community who represent the public and private sectors, as they discuss pertinent issues affecting the AAPI community. Topics range from environmental justice to mental health, and these dialogues create a learning space where interns can interact with the panelists and each during and after the presentations, panel discussions, and Q&A; sections with public service leaders. WLP has been the only educational and leadership development working series in the city that focuses specifically on the AAPI community and AAPI individuals' roles in public policy. =Federal Internship Program= This program places student applicants in federal offices in Washington DC, with opportunities to be placed in regional offices. Each intern is required to attend all of the Washington Leadership Program Sessions and complete a Community Action Project (CAP). The CAP is a group project that fulfills a community service requirement to develop a tangible way to connect personal and professional goals and reflections, giving back to communities important to each intern. At the end of each summer, CAP groups present their projects to sponsors, board members, and other invited guests at the intern Closing Ceremony. =Public Service Scholarship Program= Within this program, scholarships are awarded to students completing unpaid internships in public service work in the metropolitan DC area over the summer. They are expected to fulfill the same requirements as those accepted to CAPAL's Federal Internship Program, attending every Washington Leadership Program Session and completing their CAP Projects. =Professional Development Program= This program encompasses a multitude of events that CAPAL puts together throughout the year, and includes an AAPI Leadership Roundtable Series, Happy Hours, a CAPALTalks Series, and a Career Fair. Each event is free and open to the public, and offers opportunities for attendees to connect with professionals in specific fields in the DC area. These events also provide a venue for AAPI leaders in government, policy, and nonprofit sectors to explore and reflect on their own careers in public service with the community at large. Collaborations CAPAL hosts a variety of alternate events with the government, primarily for but not necessarily limited to each class of scholars and interns within CAPAL. A common partner is with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to provide USA Jobs training through a Conservation Careers Symposium, which promotes careers in service dealing specifically with natural resource management and biological sciences. The organization also works with other AAPI groups such as the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) and the Organization of Chinese Americans (OCA) to promote solidarity within their specific communities, hosting programs such as APIA-U: Leadership Trainings in collaboration with OCA.

If the normalized mass flux through the channel is plotted over the Knudsen number based on the channel width a distinct minimum is observed around Kn= 0.8. This is a paradoxical behaviour because, based on the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations, one would expect the mass flux to decrease with increasing the Knudsen number. The minimum can be understood intuitively by considering the two extreme cases of very small and very large Knudsen number. For very large Kn the viscosity vanishes and a fully developed steady state channel flow shows infinite flux. On the other hand, the particles stop interacting for small Knudsen numbers. Because of the constant acceleration due to the external force, the steady state again will show infinite flux., A solution algorithm for the fluid dynamic equations based on a stochastic model for molecular motion.

At 17 years of age, he became the youngest flight instructor in U.S. Army history. He was a lead pilot for the U.S. Postal Service's airmail service, and was the first pilot to initiate night air mail flights. He was an executive for many airlines and aircraft companies. Smith was a pilot for the Byrd Antarctic Expedition of 1928‚Äì1930 involved in aerial overflights to discover new land that could be claimed for the benefit of the United States. The land was later viewed by Byrd and named after his wife. Smith was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Congressional Gold Medal. An Antarctic peak bears his name. He was inducted into the New Jersey Aviation Hall of Fame in 1986.  Early life and education  Smith was born in Cove, Oregon, on September 27, 1899 at his grandparents home. His parents were Joshua Cullow Smith and Rhoda Harris Smith. When he was three years old he traveled with his family to Central America where his father's business was headquartered. He would often run away from home to go to his grandmother's to hear her talk about the pioneer days of covered-wagons. As a child, Smith attended public schools in Oregon. After high school he attended two years at Principia College in St. Louis, Missouri, but did not graduate.  Mid life and career  Dean Smith, airmail pilot in 1922 Smith enlisted in the aviation Section of the United States Signal Corps in July 1917, several months before his eighteenth birthday. Soon after he enlisted, he was promoted to master signal electrician, the highest non-commissioned rank of the US Army Signal Corps. During this time, he was the youngest enlist to serve in the capacity. In this position he was able to promote himself to be a cadet in Ground At 17, Smith became the youngest ever flight instructor in U.S. Army history after receiving just under 57 hours of flying instruction. Though he volunteered to serve overseas to the front lines with the American Expeditionary Forces, he was posted as a flying instructor at Fort Scott. He was promoted to second lieutenant and stayed in the United States for the duration of his service duties. From August 1918 to January 1919, Smith was assigned to Gosport Instructor's School in San Antonio, Texas, as an Army flight instructor. Later he was then transferred to Rockwell Field in San Diego to teach at the Pursuit School of Instruction, where he remained until he was discharged in March 1919. Subsequently, Smith flew as a barnstormer for about a year at carnivals. He also gave five-minute rides, for five dollars each, at county fairs in various states during this time. Eventually he destroyed his plane and discontinued these ventures. Smith was instrumental in the inauguration of the air mail service by the United States Postal Service (USPS) in the summer of 1919. He had logged 900 hours of flying time in the Army before he joined the U.S. Mail Service at age nineteen. His first assignment was to fly mail from Omaha, Nebraska, to California, essentially following the same route as the Oregon Trail. His mother had taken this trail by covered wagon from Council Bluffs, Iowa, to Cove, Oregon, in 1871. His mother and grandparents had taken two years to complete their trip, whereas Smith flew his route to California within a week with several stops along the way. Smith delivering mail, Bellefonte Station He became an official air mail pilot on May 21, 1920. He helped to develop a transcontinental route that included the technology of flying using electronic instruments.This was needed for the air mail service that the USPS intended to provide. Smith was the first pilot to initiate night air mail service. His first route was from Hadley Field in New Jersey to Bellefonte in Pennsylvania and then from there to Cleveland, Ohio, a distance of 394 miles along a four hour lighted route. The next segment he added later was from Cleveland to Chicago and that leg was later extended to Omaha. Flying planes carrying air mail, day or night, was hazardous and accidents happened often, more so even than in barnstorming. Smith worked as an air mail pilot until August 31, 1927. In his association with USPS for more than 7 years, he logged 3764.57 hours and flew 365,719 miles (588,568 km). Smith was permanently stationed at Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, as an air mail pilot starting in May 1920. He often flew from there in and out of Cleveland and used the De Havilland Airco DH-4B aircraft for the delivery of airmail. Smith reported in his autobiography, during one run from Omaha to Cheyenne, that he had had to ditch into a pasture, landing on a cow. He sent a laconic telegram to his division supervisor at headquarters in College Park, Maryland, reporting the mishap. Crashes were part of the job. Engines were unreliable, and pilots were using road maps. Unpredictable, bad weather was a constant risk. In the first five years of US Post Office air mail service the average forced landing was every 800 miles and a pilot was killed about every 80,000 miles. Thirty-five pilots died during the Postal Service's operation of air mail flights; most deaths were between 1920 and 1925. Smith was involved in another incident that scared him to death. One day when he was flying his normal air mail route from Hadley Field to Cleveland, he caught something out of the corner of his eye that looked like a skyscraper. He pulled back on the control stick to quickly gain altitude and just missed hitting the U.S. Navy airship USS Los Angeles that was in his direct path. It was a close call of just over a hundred feet.  Byrd expedition  Engineer Elbert J. Thawley standing beside the \\"Floyd Bennett\\" airplane In 1928, Smith was selected as a pilot for the Byrd Antarctic Expedition of 1928‚Äì1930 from a list of over 25,000 pilots. Byrd selected Smith not only for his all-weather experience, but because of the respect he had for Smith's mother after meeting her. Smith flew a three-engined Ford Trimotor plane named the Floyd Bennett (named in Bennett's honor) and headed for the South Pole on August 25, 1928. He logged 70 hours of Antarctic flying during the time he was at the South Pole with Admiral Richard Byrd. Smith flew Antarctic missions with Bernt Balchen, a Norwegian, who piloted the first plane to traverse the South Pole. He was a pilot involved in aerial overflights to discover new land in Antarctica that had not been claimed by other countries. One was a Matterhorn-like mountain, and surrounding region which was named Marie Byrd Land in honor of Byrd's wife. The mountain range was seen first by Smith before Byrd saw it. Byrd claimed his \\"pet mountain\\" for the United States and a narrative of Byrd's story, and how the land got his wife's name, was published in The New York Times of February 21, 1929. Smith returned from the expedition to his home town in Oregon for a festive welcome on July 21, 1930. Among the many questions the crowd had for him, the one that stood out was a question about the most impressive thing he experienced while at the South Pole. His answer was of the notable silence in the Antarctic. He accounted for this by remarking that no woman had ever been there. Smith went back to the air mail delivery after being at the South Pole for two years with Byrd, even setting a record on the notorious \\"hell stretch\\" over mountains in Pennsylvania.  Later life and death  Throughout his career in aviation, Smith worked for various companies such as Learning Curtiss Company, Fairchild Aviation, Hughes Tool Company, Douglas Aircraft Company, American Airlines, and United Airlines at one time or another, in various capacities. He died in Maryland on March 4, 1987. Though he stopped flying commercially in 1943, Smith continued his work with the aircraft and aviation industry. In 1973, he returned to New Zealand after more than 40 years as a guest for Air New Zealand on its first flight of McDonnell Douglas DC-10, this time as a passenger. He also was on board for a landing on the Tasman Glacier, passing through Milford Sound and Mount Cook, New Zealand.  Personal traits  Smith was nicknamed \\"The Dean\\" because of his given name. As an adult he was 6 feet 3 inches tall, weighed 180 pounds, and had black hair. He was known as a man of few words. Some claimed his extreme shyness was unexpected, given his large size. Smith married Mrs. Elizabeth Schuyler on January 3, 1931.  Societies  Smith was a member of the Aero Club of America. He was also a member of several pioneer aviator groups including the Air Mail Pioneers Association and the Quiet Birdmen. He was the last president of the National Air Pilots Association, as it was subsumed in 1932 into the Airline Pilots Association. As a pioneer flier, he was named to the Curtiss OX5 and Aviation Halls of Fame.  Awards  Smith was decorated in 1930 with the Distinguished Flying Cross for assisting Byrd. He received the Harmon Trophy in 1934 for being America's most outstanding aviator. Smith was also a recipient of The Detroit News Aerial Trophy. He was a featured aviator in Chasing the Sun, a public television documentary on commercial aviation, produced by KCET Hollywood. Legacy Smith Peak on Thurston Island, Antarctica, is named for Smith.

The game's first season was released on December 8, 2015, for iOS devices and later ported to Android. In Star Billions, players observe a hopelessly lost spaceship that is piloted by four unique artificial intelligences represented by anthropomorphic animal characters. After each character presents its plan for resolving a given situation, the player must select the ideal AI to solve the problem. Star Billions takes place in real- time as players wait to see how their decision will affect the story. Players may also reduce the wait time by playing Game Boy style minigames. Plot Star Billions takes place in the distant future. Humanity is forced to flee Earth aboard the \\"Big Brother\\" spacecraft after a series of disasters. The humans attempt to find a new planet suitable for organic life, but soon realize that their food and fuel stores will be depleted before an ideal planet is found. An advanced artificial intelligence known as EIN is placed in charge of finding a new planet while all of humanity is put into a state of cryogenic sleep. EIN constructs a small scouting vessel known as the \\"Little Brother\\" and programs three additional AIs with unique, human-like personalities designed to balance one another. These AIs are SARGE, ROSIE and LACIE.  Development  The game's initial design was created by James Tillman just before he graduated from college in 2015. Co-designer Matthew Taylor visited James and found a crudely drawn design document for Star Billions. In this early phase, the artificial intelligences were not yet anthropomorphic animals and some characters featured different names that would later change.  Reception  The game received generally positive reviews with VentureBeat praising the game's \\"presentation\\" and \\"charm\\" while Pocket Tactics described the game as \\"cute, funny [and] well-written.\\" AppUnwrapper criticized the game's real-time elements, saying \\"In theory, it works.

V. Davies) (1898‚Äì1979) was an Indian- born Singaporean social worker and women's rights activist. In her younger days, she was an educator but after her move to Singapore she was active in church work and social service organisations, serving as president of the YWCA on two separate occasions. Davies was instrumental in the committee which drafted the rules for the Singapore Council of Women and served on its executive committee. Davies received the Public Service Star in 1970 and was inducted into the Singapore Women's Hall of Fame in its inaugural year, 2014. Early life Checha George was born in 1898 in Kerala, India to T. D. George, a Methodist lay preacher. Receiving her education during the British rule of India, she attended school in Madras, studying economics and English History and earning her bachelor's and master's degrees. George also earned a medal for playing tennis and continued to play even after her marriage and move to Singapore, wearing her sari on the courts. She joined the YWCA Association in 1916, adopting their mission to improve education opportunities for women and girls. She also served as a lay preacher for the Methodist church. George became a school teacher and was employed at the Women's Christian College in Madras. On 3 April 1925 at Madras, she married E. V. Davies (Edward Vethanayagam), of Singapore's Outram Road School, and returned with him to Singapore. Community activism When she arrived in Singapore, Davies joined the Tamil Methodist Church and served as both a preacher and a lecturer. She travelled abroad, to various places in Asia, the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East as the president of the Women's Society of Christian Service. Though travelling as an unaccompanied Indian woman was unheard of in the 1930s, she also travelled as an ambassador-at-large for the YWCA. In 1931, Davies founded the Indian-Ceylonese Club, later known as the Lotus Club, which was the first ladies' organisation for women of Indian descent in Singapore. After a dinner with Jawaharlal Nehru, in which he suggested that the Lotus Club merge with another organisation called the Ladies Union, the two clubs became the Kamala Club. The club served as both a social and cultural organisation and was a landmark of charitable works. She also served as president of the International Women's Club, which aimed at uniting women of various nationalities in completing community improvement projects. In her endeavours, Davies was driven by the idea that \\"doing rather than talking\\" was a demonstration of faith. After the Japanese occupation of Singapore, Davies and other women worked to improve the deplorable conditions affecting many women's lives. She met with Shirin Fozdar in 1951 to draft a constitution for a woman's council to address women's issues. When the Singapore Council of Women (SCW) was founded in 1952, Davies, along with Fozdar and Tan Cheng Hiong Lee served in its executive council. Davies was chair of the membership committee and as such, increased membership by 1955 to over 2000 women. Though the aim of the organisation was to increase the political and socio-economic equality of women in Singapore, Davies preferred to work on social projects for women in need; however, she was a staunch supporter of the anti-polygamy campaign of the SCW and pressed for men's support in the cause. When the Women's Charter passed the Singaporean Parliament in 1961, a ban on polygamy was adopted, as well as many legal protections for which Davies and the SCW had pressed. After passage of the Charter, Davies turned her attention to social projects with the YWCA and decreased her participation in the SCW. In her work with the YWCA of Singapore, Davies pushed for adult women's education and children's programs. She was an advocate for hostels for low-income workers and women with children. From 1960 to 1964, and again from 1966 to 1968, Davies served as president of the Singapore YWCA. In 1967, she was awarded a gold badge from the YWCA for her service. In a 1969 project to build a 6-storey women's hostel on Fort Canning Road, Davies proposed that women donate their weight in dollars. To reach her own donation goal, Davies sold her house The building was completed, allowing the YWCA to generate income for other projects from the rent. For this and other services to the community, on National Day in 1970, Davies was awarded the Bintang Bakti Masyarakat (Public Service Star). Davies died on 2 September 1979 at the Tan Tock Seng Hospital after a brief illness. She was posthumously inducted in 2014 into the Singapore Women's Hall of Fame in their inaugural group of women.

A plyscraper is a skyscraper made (at least partly) of wood. They may alternatively be known as mass timber buildings. Materials The use of cross-laminated timber (CLT), a type of mass timber, gives high fire resistance, because when exposed to fire, CLT forms a surface char layer, which protects its interior from fire damage. As they are made of wood, they lock up carbon during construction, and are sustainable if the timber they are made from is replanted. Plyscrapers, may, besides using wood (often cross- laminated timber), also use concrete. These plyscrapers are called \\"hybrids\\".The rise of skyscrapers made of wood Concrete may, for example, be used for making the columns. As an alternative to concrete columns, \\"glulam\\" is sometimes also used. With this type of laminated wood, the boards are not glued cross-wise, but rather glued while pointing the same direction.Kijk magazine, 12, 2019 Tallest plyscrapers Until 2017, the tallest habitable building made of timber was the Brock Commons on the campus of the University of British Columbia near Vancouver, Canada. In 2019 the Mj√∂sa Tower in Brumunddal, Norway, was completed, taking over the title with its 85.4 metres (280 ft). Several proposals for taller timber buildings have been made, including a tower in Tokyo. Although quite high buildings can be made using cross-laminated timber, and/or other materials, building high with current techniques does have its drawbacks. For example, walls and columns get so thick then that the size of the usable interior space gets heavily reduced. This issue does not occur with shorter buildings.Kijk magazine, 12, 2019 See also * Skyscraper design and construction References External links *Wood Skyscrapers, Home to Tall Wood Architecture *2016: The year in wood construction TreeHugger, 2016 Wooden architecture ","title":"Plyscraper"},{"id":"51114662","text":"Team MTEK (commonly known as BMW Team MTEK) is a racing team located in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

The band formed in June 2013 and are currently signed to the French record label Norma Evangelium Diaboli. They released their debut studio album S√∂ngvar elds og √≥rei√∞u on 7 February 2015 to widespread critical acclaim. The band have since toured Europe and the United States, performed at Eistnaflug, and were named an 'artist in residence' at the famous Roadburn Festival in 2016. History The band started as founding member D.G.'s solo project. T√≥mas √çsdal, with whom he ran the V√°nagandr record label, joined him. He eventually deferred his graduation date in favour of touring with the band, passing his final exams after being tutored by band-mate Helgi. Their debut studio album S√∂ngvar elds og √≥rei√∞u was released on 7 February 2015 to positive reviews from critics, being named one of the best metal albums of 2015 by Stereogum. Later that year the band performed in Brussels, Belgium at the Nidrosian Black Mass V festival. The band were one of three artists in residence at the famous Roadburn Festival in 2016. In a review of the band's show on April 14 for Invisible Oranges, described the band's performance as \\"incredible\\", writing that \\"These new songs were a swirl of near dissonance, levied by ‚Äúblink and you‚Äôll miss it‚Äù melodies that grounded the listener just long enough to kick the floor out from under them again. It was more head spinning than head banging.\\" Later that year, Metal Hammer named them one of the 10 best Icelandic black metal bands. On January 10, 2017 the band released a split 10\\" EP with fellow Icelandic band Sinmara, each band contributing one song; Mis√æyrming's song was titled \\"Hof\\" while Sinmara's was titled \\"Ivory Stone\\". The EP was released through Terratur Possessions. On April 27, 2019 the band announced their long-awaited sophomore album would be titled Algleymi and was released on May 24 through Norma Evangelium Diaboli.https://www.heaviestofart.com/blog/misthyrming-announce-new-album- algleymi According to D.G.; he wrote the music in 2015 after the release of the band's debut and started recording it in 2016 however due to production and mixing errors caused by cheap equipment the album was delayed and entirely rerecorded from scratch. The band continued touring in spite of this and even played some of the new songs in concents throughout 2016, 2017 and 2018. In 2017 after extensive rehearsal of the material the band secured a professional studio to record a new version of the album which was done between autumn 2017 and 2018 and featured guest vocals by Sturla Vi√∞ar of Svartidau√∞i and Wraath of Behexen, as well as the second lyrical contribution from poet and musician Krist√≥fer P√°ll for one of the songs. Algleymi like its predecessor was very well received by fans and critics alike.

SPV-Verlag, Dunkirk (GB), 1998. Sugar cane trains at Kahului Sugar Mill After the US government of the Hawaiian government had allowed sugar to be exported duty- free in 1876, the sugar industry experienced a strong upswing. The head of the postal authority of Kahului, Thomas H. Hobron, saw the need to transport the sugar quickly to the ports and opened already on 17 July 1879 a railway line from Wailuku to the harbor in Kahului under the name Kahului and Wailuku Railroad. The first passenger train ran on 29 July 1879. In September 1879, the construction was completed on this section. The track was the first public railway in the Kingdom of Hawaii. Scheduled mixed trains operated from Tuesday to Friday. On 21 September 1880, the extension to Pa'ia was opened. From 1 July 1881 rail operations operated under the name Kahului Railroad . From 1884, the branch to Spreckelsville was in operation. From 1894 until the annexation of the archipelago by the United States in 1899, the web used its own stamps for the transport of mail that were produced by the US Postal Service.www.hawaiianstamps.com In 1899, the railroad was acquired by the Hawaiian Commercial & Sugar Co. In 1906, the railway company built from the port of Kahului. The line was extended again on 8 February 1913. The railway crossed the Maliko Gorge via a steel bridge to reach Ha'ik≈´ and Kuiaha. The bridge was with a height of 230 ft (70 m) above the valley floor the highest railway bridge in Hawaii, and had a length of 682 ft (208 m). The railway was from 1959, the last public railway in the state of Hawai'i and after a total of almost 87 years, the organisation with the longest operating time. In 1962, Hawaiian Commercial & Sugar was acquired by Alexander & Baldwin. It was decommissioned on 22 May 1966, and subsequently degraded. The Maliko bridge was demolished. The tracks and some vehicles were used for the construction of Lahaina Kaanapali and Pacific Railroad, a tourist train in the west of the island.

Typically this effect is produced by keeping the melody in the middle register, with accompanying arpeggios in the treble and bass registers.Hamilton (1998), p. 58 History The effect had been prefigured by composers including Francesco Pollini (1762‚Äì1846), a pupil of Mozart, whose 32 esercizi for the piano (1829), based on techniques found in the keyboard music of Johann Sebastian Bach and Jean- Philippe Rameau, included music written on three staves, and using interlocking hand positions, to generate the impression of three, or even four, hands.Cvetko (1980), p. 48; Rowland (2004), p. 122. Another early example exists in an 1817 caprice in E-flat Major by Alexandre Pierre Fran√ßois Bo√´ly. This four-voiced composition has two melodies in bass and treble, with a third melody harmonized in sixths played simultaneously between them. In Paris of the 1830s, bravura piano technique became very fashionable. Various intricate problems in piano playing were solved during this period, and unusual techniques invented. Advances in piano technology also enabled innovative techniques.See Loesser (1990), pp. 358‚Äì359, and Harding (1978), p. 153. Sigismund Thalberg employed a three-hand effect in his Fantasy on Don Juan (1833‚Äì34) and subsequently gained great success using it in his Fantasy on Rossini's Mo√Øse (1835). Thalberg primarily used the technique in settings of other composers' works. Arthur Loesser describes his style as \\"drawing scarves of quick arpeggios\\" above and below a melody. He adds \\"[Thalberg's] clever shading that helped make this device convincing: since the accompanying arpeggios were very soft, the resonance of the well brought out melody tones...could seem to 'sing'.\\"Loesser (1990), p. 372. Moriz Rosenthal alleged that Thalberg had adapted this effect from the harp technique of Elias Parish Alvars (1808‚Äì1849).Rosenthal (2005), p. 75. A contemporary review of Thalberg playing in London mentioned \\"myriads of notes sounding from one extremity of the instrument to the other without disturbing the subject, in which the three distinct features of this combination are clearly brought out by his exquisite touch.\\"Cited in Harding (1978), p. 155. Carl Czerny noted that the technique also required careful novel use of the piano pedals, especially the sustaining pedal; normally having been used to sustain notes in the bass register, Thalberg applied it \\"to the notes of the middle and higher octaves, and thereby [produced] entirely new effects, which had hitherto never been imagined.\\"Cited in Hamilton (2008), p. 156. Thalberg's entry in Grove Music Online is more circumspect, explaining that \\"Thalberg's basic compositional method was relatively simple, consisting of placing the melody in the centre of the keyboard first in one hand, then in the other (the thumbs and the sustaining pedal used in particular to prolong the sound), and ornamenting it with florid counterpoint and chords above and below\\", and concluding that \\"Thalberg's compositions are of questionable value\\". Douglas Bomberger has commented \\"Thalberg has come to represent the excesses of the romantic period, when bigger was better and two hands could sound like three.\\"Bomberger (1991), p. 198. Franz Liszt, initially condemning Thalberg's use of this technique, later adopted it himself, for example in his Grandes √©tudes on themes of Paganini.Hamilton (1998), pp. 58‚Äì61 By 1840, Felix Mendelssohn, inspired by hearing Thalberg play,Harding (1978), p. 155. was occasionally using this technique in his own compositions. The style became part of the repertoire of many virtuoso pianist-composers of the 19th century. Ferruccio Busoni composed six studies, constituting \\"Book Four: 'For Three Hands'\\" of the second edition of his Klavier√ºbung (published posthumously in 1925), which exhibit different versions of three-hand effect. The studies include transcriptions of music by Bach, Beethoven, Schubert, Offenbach, and Busoni himself.Busoni (1925), pp. 51‚Äì62. Kenneth Hamilton comments that \\"[Thalberg's] inheritance is still with us today, as anyone will testify who has ever heard a cocktail pianist wreath a slow popular tune in elegant arpeggios.\\"Hamilton (2008), p. 158.

Two types of tectonic erosion exist: frontal erosion at the outer margin of a plate and basal erosion at the base of the plate's crust. Basal erosion causes a thinning of the overriding plate. When frontal tectonic erosion consumes a crustal block at the outer margin it may induce a domino effect on upper crustal tectonics causing the remaining blocks to fault and tilt to fill the ‚Äúgap‚Äù left by the consumed block. Subduction erosion is believed to be enhanced by high convergence rates and low sediment supply to the trench. Before the Neoproterozoic, subduction erosion rates were probably higher than at present due to higher convergence rates. A scarcity of blueschists from this time seems to support this view. However, this assertion is arguably wrong because the earliest oceanic crust would have contained more magnesium than today's crust and, therefore, would have formed greenschist- like rocks at blueschist facies. The following features and processes have been associated with subduction erosion: *Extensional tectonics: Tectonic erosion is believed be a widespread phenomenon in northern Chile with the normal faulting around Mejillones Peninsula attributed to an extensional domino effect caused by the consumption of a lithospheric block. *Regional subsidence and transgression: The Miocene transgression of southern Chile has been suggested to have been caused by basal tectonic erosion. Subduction erosion do not explain the Miocene transgression further inland in Patagonia. *Magmatic belt migration: Concurrent with the Andean orogeny the eastward migration of the magmatic belts in Chile from the Late Cretaceous onward is thought to be caused by subduction erosion.

About 110 boys who had gone to the convent to receive bread on the last day of carnival celebrations were killed after falling down a flight of steps while trying to get out of the convent. Background At the time of the tragedy, Malta was under British rule and experiencing a famine, and it had become a tradition to gather 8- to 15-year-old boys from the lower classes of Valletta and the Three Cities to participate in a procession during the last few days of carnival. After the procession, they would attend Mass, and they would be given some bread afterwards. This activity was arranged by ecclesiastical directors who taught catechism, and its main aim was to keep children out of the riots and confusion of carnival. This activity was organized on 10 February 1823, when children attended mass at Floriana and then went to the Convent of the Minori Osservanti (now better known as ta' ƒ†ie≈ºu) in Valletta where they were given bread. Everything went as planned, and the same procedure was planned for the following day. Disaster The same procedure took place on 11 February 1823. Children were gathered and attended mass at Floriana, but the ceremony lasted an hour longer than usual. The children's procession to the convent in Valletta occurred at the same time as the carnival celebrations had ended, so they met with many people who were returning home. At this point, some adults and children from the crowd mixed in with the boys in order to receive some free bread. The boys entered one of the convent's corridors from the vestry door in the church, and were to be let out through another door in St. Ursula Street. The bread was to be distributed at the latter door. Although the vestry door was usually locked to prevent boys from reentering to receive more bread, this time the door was left open since the boys were late. Due to this, more men and boys entered without anyone realizing. Those who had entered began to push the boys queuing in the corridor, who were shoved to the end of the corridor near a half-open door. At this point, a lamp went out leaving the corridor in darkness, and the people inside began to push forward even more. The boys at the front fell down a flight of steps, blocking the door in the process. Those who were distributing the bread as well as some neighbours rushed to assist the children after they heard screams. They managed to open the doors, and many boys got out and were revived. However, a number of boys had already died due to suffocation or being trampled upon. The exact number of casualties is not known. Records of the Sacra Infermeria show that 94 bodies of boys aged between 15 and 16 were brought to the hospital on 11 February, and they were buried the following day. However, contemporary records such as The Gentleman's Magazine, and Historical Chronicle reveal that \\"no less than 110 boys perished on this occasion\\". Aftermath An investigation led by the Lieutenant Governor took place after the disaster, and a report about the findings was published a few days after the incident. The investigation concluded that the stampede took place as a result of a succession of errors, and no one was accused for the deaths of the children.

It is believed that their coal lights ignited the methane and blasting powder kegs, which caused a severe explosion that killed 46 men and boys, most of whom suffocated from carbon monoxide inhalation. The second disaster resulted from a mine car accidentally running over some loose explosives. This, coupled with a failure to damp the coal dust, resulted in a large explosion that killed 13.

In 2014 the Cavu became the first place of re-emerging schistosomiasis in Europe. 120 people have become infected after bathing in it.  Geography  The Cavu originates at an elevation of with what the Institut national de l'information g√©ographique et foresti√®re calls the creek of Sainte-Lucie, and the creek of Finicione north-east of Puntacci in the regional forest of l'Ospedale, above the community of Zonza.

Tourism The river is popular with locals and tourists alike, and people bathe in the natural pools. Sanitary issues People who had bathed in the Cavu starting in 2011 or 2013 were found to have acquired bilharziosis, an infection with the parasite Schistosoma. The French government screened exposed people and by March 2015 reported that 110 French residents acquired the urogenital form of schistosomiasis. These were the first autochthonous Schistosoma infections acquired in Europe since 1965. Of 43 exposed Italian tourists, Italian scientists later found two to be infected per ELISA testing. more than 120 local people or tourists were known to have been infected. A French epidemiological study surveyed the Bulinus truncatus snails of the Cavu, which can harbor the parasite, and did not find any infected with the Schistosoma haematobium, Schistosoma bovis, and S. haematobium‚ÄìS. bovis hybrids which had been isolated from people with the infection, thus making the environment an unlikely reservoir. Public Health England issued a travel warning in 2014. In July 2015, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control declared the risk of transmission to be low.European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control Rapid Risk Assessment.

In early September 2016 she was sentenced to five years' imprisonment after being found guilty of \\"plotting to topple the Iranian government\\". She was temporarily released on 17 March 2020. The prosecutor general of Tehran had stated in October 2017 that she was being held for running \\"a BBC Persian online journalism course which was aimed at recruiting and training people to spread propaganda against Iran\\". Arrest and trial Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the Canadian news agency Thomson Reuters' charitable arm, travelled to Iran on 17 March 2016 to visit her family for Nowruz (Iranian New Year) with her 22-month-old daughter. On 3 April 2016, members of Iran's Revolutionary Guard arrested her at the Imam Khomeini Airport as she and her daughter were about to board a flight back to the UK. Her daughter's British passport was confiscated during the arrest, but later returned, and she remained in Iran under the care of her maternal grandparents so she could visit her mother. The exact reason for her arrest was initially unclear, though according to Amnesty International it is believed to be related to the 2014 imprisonment of several Iranian technology news website employees. The head of Kerman province's justice department, Ali Tavakoli, said they had participated in projects run by the BBC and received funds from London: > \\"This gang was running a number of projects and plans for anti-revolutionary > Iranians based abroad, especially for the BBC Persian, under the guise of > legitimate activities. Financial aid for this group was usually provided > from London under the pretext of charitable donations. The director of the > team was an individual who has served the BBC as a mentor and teacher in a > number of countries such as Malaysia, India and Afghanistan and his travels > to these countries were paid for by British intelligence services.\\" Zaghari-Ratcliffe has worked for the BBC World Service Trust (now called BBC Media Action), an international charity that provided training courses to Iranian citizen journalists and bloggers in its Iran Media Development Project's ZigZag magazine and associated radio programme. In 2014, several graduates were convicted and sentenced by Iran to up to 11 years in jail for their participation in these courses. Zaghari-Ratcliffe worked for the BBC World Service Trust between February 2009 and October 2010, \\"in a junior capacity as a Training Assistant\\" according to the CEO of the Thomson Reuters Foundation, before moving to the Thomson Reuters Foundation. BBC Media Action described her role as \\"junior and purely administrative\\". According to Yadollah Movahed, the head of the Justice Department in the Iranian city of Kerman, and as reported by the Iranian news network Press TV, Nazanin was arrested \\"over her involvement in post-election riots that engulfed Tehran and some other cities in 2009\\". Movahed said Zaghari was among the suspects who \\"conducted activities against the security of the country by designing websites and carrying out campaigns in the media‚Äù during 2009. According to Movahed, Nazanin was not arrested for activity inside Iran or for activity during her 2016 holiday to Iran: ‚ÄúSome members of the group were outside Iran, including the suspect Nazanin Zaghari‚Äù. Mashregh News, an outlet close to Iranian authorities, pointed to her alleged involvement with the human rights organizations Women Living Under Muslim Laws and Hivos as a motive for her arrest. According to Press TV in June 2016, \\"The IRGC headquarters in Kerman province announced that Nazanin Zaghari had been identified after a large intelligence operation. She was one of the liaison officers of networks hostile to Iran abroad. According to this source, she was responsible for several missions, and conducted her criminal activities under the direction of media and intelligence services of foreign governments.\\" In early September 2016, she was sentenced to five years in prison \\"for allegedly plotting to topple the Iranian regime.\\" The prosecutor general of Tehran stated in October 2017 that she was imprisoned for running \\"...a BBC Persian online journalism course which was aimed at recruiting and training people to spread propaganda against Iran\\". PressTV in 2017 reported she had been \\"found guilty of spying and spreading propaganda against the Islamic Republic\\", describing the activities involved as her BBC World Service Trust work: Imprisonment On 23 August 2018, Zaghari-Ratcliffe was released on temporary licence for three days, which is standard practice prior to lengthier releases. However, Zaghari-Ratcliffe suffered from panic attacks after returning to prison, and regretted having been given the temporary release. Her husband said the temporary licence was a \\"cruel game\\" subject to conditions including the monitoring of her movements. In March 2019, the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) granted Zaghari-Ratcliffe diplomatic protection, raising the status of her case from a consular matter to a dispute between the two governments. Iran argues the designation is contrary to international law, the Master Nationality Rule, with Iran's ambassador in London stating \\"Governments may only exercise such protection for own nationals, ... Iran does not recognise dual nationality\\". On 11 October 2019, Zaghari-Ratcliffe's daughter returned to her father in the United Kingdom to start school. In December 2019, the prosecutor general of Iran denied conditional release for Nazanin Zaghari, which was requested by her lawyer. At the height of COVID19 pandemic crisis in Iran in March 2020, Zaghari-Ratcliffe was released on temporary basis. As of then, she has been under an effective house arrest. On September 8, 2020, Iranian state media said that Zaghari-Ratcliffe was facing new charges.  1971 arms deal dispute  In February 2018, Richard Ratcliffe said he believed his wife's release was dependent on the interest on a ¬£450 million debt the UK has owed to Iran since the 1970s for a cancelled arms deal. In October 2019 he repeated the claim with more detail, stating that a UK government agency was using \\"every legal roadblock to delay and minimise the payment\\". In 1971, the Iranian government, then under the Shah of Iran, paid Britain for thousands of military vehicles as part of a ¬£650m deal. When the Shah's regime fell, the succeeding Islamic regime asked for a partial refund on undelivered tanks. A complex legal dispute has existed between Britain and Iran ever since. In 2001, Iran won its case at arbitration against the supplying company, UK government owned International Military Services (IMS). In December 2002, IMS paid ¬£500 million into the Court Funds Office as security, claiming that EU sanctions prevent it from paying any money directly to the Iranian government, to await a High Court action. The Iranian government has since applied to HM Treasury's Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation for approval of its payments. A judge has been asked to rule on the final amount owed, which is likely to be around ¬£400 million. In 2013, Iranian officials coming to Britain to progress court action on the debt had their visas revoked on arrival at Heathrow Airport, and were detained a few days before deportation. In January 2016, the United States refunded Iran $400 million for undelivered military equipment which was associated with the release of four Iranian-Americans, including Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian, which could be viewed as a precedent for Zaghari-Ratcliffe's situation. Zaghari-Ratcliffe was allegedly told by her military interrogators of the link between her detention and the disputed arms deal. This claim was denied by both the Iranian Foreign Ministry and the British Foreign Office, with the latter stating: The UK's Ministry of Defence is reportedly unwilling to release settlement funds because it believes the Iranian Government would use the money to extend Iran's military activities in Yemen, Syria, and Lebanon. A High Court hearing on the return of the debt was scheduled for May 2019, but as it is an action for enforcement of an arbitration award the proceedings were intended to be confidential and private. However, due to press interest, the proceedings were made public.  Release campaign  On 7 May 2016, Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband Richard Ratcliffe launched an online petition urging both the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Iran's supreme leader to take appropriate action to secure the safe return of his wife and daughter. The petition now has over 3.5 million supporters in 155 countries. Through his lawyers, Richard Ratcliffe has pressed for any settlement of the IMS deal to be paid to an entity other than the Iranian Government's defence ministry, alternatively that the dispute be settled in humanitarian aide rather than cash, thereby circumventing EU sanctions. In April 2019 the Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif suggested a prisoner swap. = Boris Johnson intervention = On 1 November 2017, British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said \\"When we look at what Nazanin Zaghari- Ratcliffe was doing, she was simply teaching people journalism, as I understand it, at the very limit.\\" These remarks appear to have put her at risk, prompting condemnation from politicians across the spectrum including Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn and London Mayor Sadiq Khan, leading to calls for Boris Johnson to be sacked. A central part of Zaghari-Ratcliffe's defence was that she was there on a holiday and never worked to train journalists in the country. Her employer, Thomson Reuters Foundation, called on Johnson to \\"immediately correct the serious mistake he made\\" in this statement. They added \\"She is not a journalist and has never trained journalists at the Thomson Reuters Foundation\\". Four days later, Zaghari- Ratcliffe was returned to court in Iran where the Foreign Secretary's statement was cited as evidence against her. Zaghari-Ratcliffe was thought likely to appear in court again on 10 December 2017 to face additional charges relating to her work for the BBC World Service Trust; however, Iranian court officials released a statement that no new charges had been raised and these reports were false. Boris Johnson visited Tehran on 9 December 2017, raising the case of Zaghari-Ratcliffe. = United Nations = The United Nations has on several occasions called for Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release. On 7 October 2016, the United Nations rapporteur on human rights in Iran, Ahmed Shaheed, called on Iran to immediately release Zaghari-Ratcliffe. The call was repeated a year later by Shaheed's successor, Asma Jahangir, as well as by Jos√© Antonio Guevara Berm√∫dez, Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention: \\"We consider that Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been arbitrarily deprived of her liberty and that her right to a fair trial before an independent and impartial tribunal has been violated ‚Ä¶ These are flagrant violations of Iran‚Äôs obligations under international law\\". The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention had also formally called for her immediate release in its Opinion 28/2016, adopted in August 2016. Further calls for Zaghari- Ratcliffe's release have been made by the US Congress, the Canadian Parliament, and the European Parliament. = Hunger strike = In June 2019, both Nazanin and Richard Zaghari-Ratcliffe went on hunger strike, in protest at Nazanin's imprisonment, with Richard Zaghari-Ratcliffe camping outside the Iranian Embassy in London. They both ended the hunger strike on 29 June 2019, after 15 days. = Coronavirus pandemic = In February 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic spread to Iran, Zaghari-Ratcliffe was suspected of falling ill with COVID-19 from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Her family called on the UK and Iranian governments to ensure that Zaghari-Ratcliffe was tested for the virus and received proper medical treatment. However, Iran's judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili said she did not have coronavirus and was in \\"good health\\". Gholamhossein also described reports of her infection as \\"propaganda\\". On 17 March, she was temporarily freed for two weeks until 4 April, which was later extended until 18 April.

The area of the project is approximately 4,080 dunams and it is the largest, undeveloped land reserve remaining in Holon. The scheme is bounded in the north by Sderot Yerushalayim and the Kiryat Sharet and Kiryat Pinhas Ayalon neighbourhoods, in the east by Highway no. 4, in the south by the border with the city of Rishon LeZion and in the west by Highway 20 (Israel) (the Ayalon Highway).  General Background  The scheme (Holon H-500) adapts the land zoning, and the deployment and height of construction, to the restrictions deriving from NOPS 2/4 (the National Outline Planning Scheme for the development of Ben Gurion Airport), which fixed the location of the flight paths adjacent to and above the site of the H-500 scheme. The restrictions deriving from the Airport's activity are expressed in a limit of the final height of the buildings in the project (a maximum of 22 stories), height limits for masts and antennas and also restrictions relating to the erection of cranes during construction. In addition, the use of acoustic elements for noise insulation is prescribed, as are provisions intended to minimise the hazards deriving from flying birds that might endanger passing aircraft. According to the scheme, in the version that has been deposited (Holon H-500), a green area of 1,200 dunams or thereabouts is planned for the development of a metropolitan sand dune park at the centre of the site. The centre of the park, which is called the \\"preserved heart\\", will include an area of not less than 400 dunams of natural sand dunes in order to preserve the unique ecology that includes a wide range of rare plants, the like of which is not to be found elsewhere along the coast. The ring around the \\"preserved heart\\" will form the outer envelope of the park and will be zoned for municipal recreation and leisure activity. Further to the hearing of oppositions to the deposited version of the scheme (Holon H-500), the district planning and building committee decided to extend the \\"preserved heart\\" of the park at the expense of the area for future planning. The 1,500 dwelling units that were allotted in an area for future planning according to the deposited version of the scheme were moved by the district committee's decision to the residential domains, so that their allotment will not be dependent on changes to the Airport flight paths.

History  The sand dunes of South Holon have been a focus of real estate activity since the beginning of the last century. At that time, before the establishment of the Holon Local Council, the area was defined as being under galilee jurisdiction, that is to say that it was not under the jurisdiction of any local authority, adjacent to the Arab village of Yazur. The first outline scheme that was prepared for the area by the planning agencies during the British Mandate was called the \\"Agrobank And Neighbourhood Regional Outline Road Scheme\\". The scheme was provisionally approved on October 30, 1939 and finally on January 14, 1942 (its approval was published in the Official Gazette, no. 1164). The purpose of the scheme was to delineate the road network for the new neighbourhoods that were to be built around the Agrobank neighbourhood, situated to the north, adjacent to Mikveh Israel. In the 1930s private individuals and commercial companies started buying large tracts of land totalling hundreds of dunams from the Arab landowners. Parcellation plans were prepared in accordance with the Mandatory City Building Ordinance, which divided the large tracts of land into small parcels of between 300 and 500 m¬≤ each, creating neighbourhoods that incorporated roads and plots for public purposes, in conformity with the Mandatory outline scheme for Holon, R/128, the preparation of which began in the early 1940s The parcels resulting from the parcellation plans were entered in the Land Registers and came to be traded on the open market in Israel and also abroad. At that time great importance was attached to the redemption of the land and for that reason many parcels were bought by the Jews of Europe, USA and South Africa, with the assistance of public leaders who were harnessed to the task on visiting Jewish communities abroad. Thus, for example, Dr Haim Kugel, who went on to become the first Mayor of Holon, helped in the land redemption when he visited the Jewish community in South Africa. For that reason there are still many owners (the heirs of the original owners) of land within the boundaries of the scheme who are non-residents. The following are examples of the historical parcellation of land in South Holon: * The creation of blocks 6747, 6748, 6749 and 6750 by the Agricultural and Building Bank for Palestine Ltd * The partition of parcel 690 in block 6043 by the Land and Loan Company Ltd. The first outline planning scheme for the City of Holon, H/1, dating from 1958, cancelled all the Mandatory plans for the construction of new residential neighbourhoods in South Holon and zoned the whole area for planning again as an \\"area for reparcellation\\" (fresh consolidation and partition). The H-500 scheme is the third and most recent of the outline planning schemes (following H/1 and Amendment no. 3 to H/1) and it proposes a new planning scheme for the whole area.  The Moledet Neighbourhood  The Moledet neighbourhood is included within the boundaries of the H-500 scheme in the area that is zoned for the sand dune park. The neighbourhood was established in 1930 as the first residential suburb of South Holon and it is one of the first five neighbourhoods (together with Agrobank, Greene, Kiryat Avoda and Am) that combined into the Holon Local Council in 1940. The Moledet land was purchased by a company called Hamizrach, headed by the engineer, Alexander Hissin. The centre of the neighbourhood was the Water Tower. The first residents were eight immigrant families from Yemen but by the end of 1934, just four years later, the population of the neighbourhood had reached about 100 families. Because of Moledet's remoteness from other Jewish settlements and its proximity to the Arab villages of Yazur and Bayt Dajan, the neighbourhood was attacked by Arabs from Jaffa in the great Arab revolt between 1936 and 1939 and almost completely abandoned. Its residents went to live temporarily at the Mikveh Israel Agricultural School. The Security Road, which was paved in 1948 as an alternative to the Jaffa ‚Äì Jerusalem Road (now Highway no. 44), with the object of connecting Tel Aviv to the settlements of the South and Jerusalem, ran through Moledet. Dozens of families now live in Moledet, alongside a few businesses and workshops. All the buildings in the neighbourhood, apart from the Water Tower and Security Road that have been zoned for preservation, are to be cleared according to the H-500 scheme (see below ‚Äì the Clearance of Givat Holon and Moledet).  The Givat Holon Neighborhood  Givat Holon is located within the boundaries of the H-500 scheme in the area that is zoned for the sand dune park. This small suburb is located to the south of Kiryat Sharet in the heart of the sand dune area, alongside the road leading to the site of the municipal abattoir. Givat Holon includes several dozen homes. The buildings were constructed at the beginning of the 1940s and remain in their original format. Although according to outline scheme H/1 (Amendment no. 3), which was approved in 1978, the area was zoned as residential, in order to enlarge construction in the area it was necessary to prepare a detailed plan. Because of the limitations deriving from the neighbourhood's location in the area affected by the Airport, it was not possible to develop the neighborhood and it has therefore remained in its original state, without modern infrastructure. The residents of Givat Holon took legal proceedings against Holon Municipality and in June 2014 they were awarded judgement requiring the Municipality to grant them proper municipal services, like garbage removal and the provision of refuse bins, and the installation of lampposts and street signs. Givat Holon is due to be cleared as part of the H-500 scheme (see below ‚Äì the Clearance of Givat Holon and Moledet).  The Abattoir  The Abattoir tract is a 254 dunam piece of land that is included in the H-500 scheme. The land was expropriated from private owners in 1961 further to authority obtained by the Mayor of Holon in accordance with the Land Ordinance for the establishment of a regional abattoir and associated industrial facilities. To that end a joint company was established by the Tel Aviv and Holon Municipalities (80% Tel Aviv and 20% Holon) in order to promote the venture and bear its costs, including the compensation payable to the private landowners. Further to the expropriation proceedings, in 1966 a town planning scheme (H-142) for the construction of an abattoir and associated industries was approved. According to the scheme it was permitted to build an abattoir and meat processing facilities. The aforegoing might today sound like a figment of the imagination: to expropriate 250 dunams of land for an abattoir in the sandhills of South Holon, big enough to serve the whole Middle East. Nevertheless, at that time, the venture did appear to justify such a large-scale expropriation. Not one of the private landowners objected to the venture and even had anyone objected, it is doubtful whether he would have had any chance of succeeding against Holon's then legendary mayor, Pinchas Ayalon. In fact, apart from one building that was constructed at the end of the 1960s, which served as a municipal abattoir until the beginning of the 1990s, the rest of the land remained empty and undeveloped. The abattoir building was blown up in June 2015 as part of an exercise by the Home Front Command. The landowners in the abattoir domain, Tel Aviv and Holon Municipalities, are expected to obtain rights in the scope of the H-500 scheme for the clearance of the abattoir (section 2.2.4 of the scheme regulations).  The Clearance of Givat Holon and Moledet  The H-500 scheme lays down directions for the preservation of the Security Road and the historic sites associated with it in accordance with the municipal preservation plan. The scheme nevertheless prescribes the clearance of Givat Holon and Moledet because of the limitations of using the area, which is affected by the flight paths according to the Ben Gurion Airport national outline scheme. After clearance, the neighborhoods will become part of the municipal sand dune park. The deposited plan contains merely general provisions for the compensation of the residents of Moledet, the clearance to be financed from building rights that have been allotted specifically for the purpose, totalling 800 dwelling units (designated for the clearance of three centres: the refuse site, the abattoir and Moledet). The scheme further provides that the total compensation will be determined by a real estate appraiser to be appointed by the local planning and building committee. Further to appeals that were filed against the district planning and building committee's decision (which the residents of Givat Holon also joined), which culminated in the decision of the appeal subcommittee of the national council of May 15, 2014, several operative decisions were made in respect of the clearance of Givat Holon (from which inferences may be drawn in respect of the clearance of Moledet) as follows: * The clearance of the existing residents will be effected in consolidation and partition proceedings in accordance with the detailed plan, in which the area will be zoned for the park. The residents will be allotted other land in accordance with the relevant provisions of law. * Until the clearance of Givat Holon it will be possible to continue using the existing lawful buildings for residential purposes. * So long as residential use continues in Givat Holon, the issue of building permits for the renovation (not including extension) of existing buildings will be permitted by virtue of existing permits. * The residents will obtain their rights in the scope of the first plan that is approved by virtue of the H-500 scheme. * Clearance will only be effected when the implementation of the first detailed plan commences or at such other time as it prescribes.

As part of the fund, a number of fundraising schemes were implemented including charitable subscriptions by employees, public concerts and railway excursions. By April 1918, it was estimated that over 2,350 Queensland railway employees had enlisted since the start of the war.  Formation  On 19 August 1914, a delegation of employees from the Southern Division of the Queensland Railways Department attended a meeting at the Railway Commissioner‚Äôs Office in Brisbane. The purpose of the meeting was to establish a Queensland Railways Patriotic Fund to raise funds to assist fellow employees who had enlisted, as well as provide support to their dependents. At the meeting it was agreed that subscriptions to the fund by employees would be voluntary. Arthur James Crowther, Secretary to the Railway Commissioner was elected chairman of the Queensland Railway Patriotic Fund. All monies raised would be paid into the general Queensland Patriotic Fund. Crowther also held a position on the General Sub-committee No.1 of the Queensland Patriotic Fund, so he could represent the railwaymen serving at the Front. It was reported in April 1918 that 2,350 Queensland railway employees had enlisted since the start of the Great War.  Fundraising  Along with voluntary subscription by employees, the Queensland Railways Patriotic Fund also organised many other fundraising activities during the course of World War I. In September 1914, railway guard Robert Munro from Tooowoomba offered all the proceeds from the sale of his song, British Call to Arms Across the Sea, to support the Fund. On October 17, 1914, a Queensland Railways Patriotic Concert was organised with tickets sold at all Brisbane suburban railway stations. The concert was held at the Exhibition Building in Brisbane and featured the musical talents of railway staff, including a choir of 60 men from the Ipswich Railway Workshops. The concert raised ¬£120 for the Fund. Further Queensland Railways Patriotic Concerts were held during World War I. Ten Miles of Pennies In February 1918, the Queensland Railways Patriotic Fund pushed to increase the amount of monies coming in by introducing the Ten Miles of Pennies scheme with the intent of raising ¬£2,200 by July of that year. In an open letter addressed to all railway employees, published in the March edition of the Queensland Railway Railway Express, chairman of the Fund, Arthur Crowther explained the reason behind the Ten Miles of Pennies scheme. > ‚ÄúThe Committee of the Railway Patriotic Fund regret to have to admit a > serious falling off in the recipts [sic] to the Fund, the amount now > received barely reaching ¬£200 per month. The claims on the Fund on behalf of > the returned soldiers and their dependents, at present, amount to ¬£500 per > month. Taking the receipts and expenditure into consideration points to the > necessity of immediate action being taken to keep the Fund solvent.‚Äù The scheme included appealing for further subscriptions from railway workers as well as other fundraising activities, such as public street collections on the 26 and 27 April and a cheap excursion train journey from Brisbane to Tweeds Heads on 21 April. Railway staff and their families volunteered their time in running these events. It was reported that ¬£4,707 was raised during this campaign.

South America is an important region for the worlds biodiversity, and includes a wide variety of native species, many of which provide medicinal uses. Introduced species in South America, have the potential to pose harm to ecosystems of the region and the aforementioned biodiversity. Although many of these non-native species are invasive, residents of the region often value these species, making it more difficult to organize efforts to get rid of them. Because of the instrumental and cultural value placed on these species, greater awareness, research, and policy are all necessary steps in solving invasive issues in South America. Here is a list of just a few of the species that have invaded South America and where they originate.  Mammals * Beaver from North America to Tierra del Fuego In 1946 the Argentine Navy imported 10 beaver couples from Canada and set them free in Isla Grande, there were consequences of such initiative were disastrous. These beavers were protected from hunting for 35 years, and free from natural predators. The beavers grew in population drastically. This caused irreversible changes in the forest ecosystem and started advancing over the continent. Now, a study published in Chilean Natural History suggests that the demographic explosion of those beavers could be bigger than suspected because it can take years or even decades for local inhabitants to notice the rodents' presence and their impact on the surrounding ecosystems. *European hare from Europe to Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Brazil The European hare has a wide range across Europe and western Asia and has been introduced to a number of other countries around the globe, often as a game species. In general, it is considered moderately abundant in its native range. They have been associated with the intensification of agricultural practices. The hare is an adaptable species and can move into new habitats, but it survives best when there is an availability of a wide variety of weeds and other herbs to supplement its main diet of grasses. The hare is considered a pest in some areas; it is more likely to damage crops and young trees in winter when there are not enough alternative foodstuffs available. *European rabbit in Argentina *Pallas's squirrel in Argentina * Chital from Asia to Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Chile Chital's breeding takes place throughout the year, with peaks that vary geographically. Sperms are produced year-round, though testosterone levels register a fall during the development of the antlers. Females have regular estrous cycles, each lasting three weeks. The female can conceive again two weeks to four months after birth. Due to the quick pace that they can reproduce, the population is growing so rapidly it causes serious damage to agriculture and natural areas. * Red deer from Europe Red deer can damage native and cultivated vegetation and pose a hazard to vehicles and humans. They are listed as one of the world's 100 worst invasive alien species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Crops that are affected are pasture, forestry, gardens. They damage the natural environment by eating native vegetation, damaging trees, spreading weed seeds and fouling water. The red deer also cause damage to forestry seedlings, agricultural and horticultural crops, commercial flower crops, orchards, irrigation systems, and fences. In dry seasons, they compete with cattle for pasture and supplementary feed. They can be a traffic hazard on suburban roads and highways. Aggressive rutting stags can also pose risk to humans. * Wild boar from Europe Invasive wild pigs‚Äô success can largely be attributed to their lack of natural predators, impressive fertility, adaptability to a variety of climates and conditions, and tendency to eat almost anything. Humans have also helped these invaders spread. By releasing them from farms and hunting preserves, as well as illegal translocation of pigs to create recreational hunting opportunities, has contributed to invasive wild pigs‚Äô recent range expansion. These wild boars cause damage to native plants and crops and compete with native species. * Hippopotamus from Africa to Colombia, originally kept by Pablo Escobar The hippopotamus is an invasive species and very resistant to everything. With no predators and ample food, the rivers prove to be an ideal habitat for the hippos. They carry diseases that can kill livestock. They pollute the water courses where they defecate. The hippopotamuses are causing damage to the ecosystem and not only affecting the environment but the animals who also live off this land as well. Fish No fish are accounted to be invasive in South America. *Brook trout in Argentina Invertebrates Giant-African-land-snail was introduced in Brazil in the 1980s as an alternative to escargot's farming, as the species grows faster and is more prolific. Mainly due to the rejection of the snail's meat by the Brazilian population, the investors ultimately released the animals in the wild. In 1993, imports of invertebrates, as well as many other animal groups, were forbidden in Brazil. In 2005, the species was officially declared an invasive species.  Plants  * Water hyacinth from Amazon basin Water hyacinth is a native plant of South America. This plant species grows in water and is known for the pretty flowers it produces. The problem is the plant spreads quickly and causes harm to wildlife by choking them. When this plant grows too thick in water, it also causes boats to have an extremely difficult time getting through. This plant harms wild life and travel/ trade if the Water hyacinth blocks certain areas of water. Water hyacinth also prevents sunlight from getting into the water which then affects the fish and plants under water. The lack of plants and algae will cause a lack of feeding and reproduction for the fish.  Targeting the issue  Invasive species are a worldwide epidemic threatening ecosystems and costing billions of dollars to control. The reason these invasive species thrive in these locations is due to no predators to hunt them. With no predators, they are able to grow in population quickly but they are taking up too many of the resources in the location they settle in. Invasive species oftentimes destroy the environment which harms the other plants and animals who also share this environment. These various species can also hurt the economy in the long run as we see with the Water hyacinth plant. The government and officials are taking various tactics to try to put an end to and also try to get rid of this issue of invasive species. Sometimes other species are introduced to help get rid of an invasive species. For example, the government in Australia brought in cactus moth caterpillars to eat the cactuses. These caterpillars are natural predators of the cactus. The issue with this introducing insects to solve these problems can cause this insect to ruin other plants then making them invasive. Chemicals is another way officials have tried to control invasive species, but they can sometimes these chemicals can harm noninvasive plants and animals.

He is particularly known for an effect \\"Collective Quantum Tunneling of CDW Electrons\\" and for a well-known paper on the topic written by him and his colleagues, as published in Physical Review Letters. He was a noteworthy student of the twice Nobel laureate physicist John Bardeen who mentioned him at several places in his biography \\"True Genius: The Life and Science of John Bardeen\\" (John Bardeen) (particularly in Chapter 15 of the book which discusses the work which Miller carried out under the guidance of Bardeen and J. R. Tucker). Biography Miller grew up in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains of northern New Mexico. His family lived in the small resort town of Red River. His parents were owners of the small beginner ski area at the Powder Puff mountain, and later Enchanted Forest Cross Country Ski Area. He attended school in Questa, New Mexico, where many descendants of the original Spanish conquistadores live, some speaking a sixteenth-century dialect of Spanish. He was a slalom, giant slalom, and downhill ski racer, first on the Red River and later on the Taos ski teams. While an undergraduate, he was a member of the Northwestern University Ski Team, acting as both captain and coach during one season. After completing his high school, Miller completed his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering at Northwestern University (1980) and his doctorate, in 1985, from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in physics, under J. R. Tucker and John Bardeen as his advisors. His PhD project was a combined experimental- theoretical study of quantum transport of electrons in Charge density waves, as one of the last students to work with Bardeen, who was the co-inventor of the transistor and the only recipient of two Nobel laurels in physics (his second Nobel prize awarded for the BCS theory of superconductivity). Soon after completion of his PhD, he was awarded a prestigious IBM Postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Illinois. He joined the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1986 as an Assistant Professor of Physics, where he remained till 1989, before joining the University of Houston, Department of Physics faculty, where he continues as a full professor of physics, in addition to being the Director, HTS Device, Biophysics, and Charge Transport Lab at the Texas Center for Superconductivity at University of Houston. He has held the Adjunct Assistant Professorship of Pediatric Cardiology at the Baylor College of Medicine, from 1994 to 2004. In 1987 he was selected for and awarded the Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship. Scientific contributions While exploring biomedical applications of novel superconducting devices (such as SQUIDs and SQUID-based sensitive magnetometers) at the University of Houston, he laid down the foundations of a Biophysics research group in association with researchers in the Texas Medical Center (TMC) in the mid 1990s. The group has expanded and evolved significantly since then, to develop new techniques and devices to study various living organisms. His group‚Äôs work on the dielectric properties of living cells and organelles led to studying the electromagnetic properties of living cells and creating collaborations with TMC researchers (including Dale Hamilton, MD) to develop electromagnetic biosensors to detect metabolic activity in mitochondria, as related to various human conditions such as obesity and its complications (under various grants funded by the National Institutes of Health with Miller as their P.I.). This led also to group's various theoretical efforts, such as development of electric field-driven torque models of the mitochondrial motor ATP synthase and efforts to understand mechanisms of disease-implicated mitochondrial mutations in the Electron transport chain,E.

It was the first communications satellite of Angola, designed for a 15-year mission to deliver television, internet, and radio services to Angola and other territories. The satellite suffered a power problem in the first hours of flight and lost contact with ground control. After the power problem, contact was established with the satellite, but ultimately the satellite did not recover, and contact was lost permanently 3 days into the mission. After repeated failures to establish contact in the following weeks/months, the satellite was declared lost. Russia will build a replacement satellite called AngoSat 2 to be delivered in late 2019. History The project was born out of a 2009 agreement between the governments of Angola and Russia, and work started in 2012. The spacecraft was originally supposed to be launched along the Energia 100 satellite on a Zenit-3SL with SeaLaunch in 2016, but political tensions following the annexation of Crimea and SeaLaunch legal issues made the use of the Ukrainian launcher uncertain. Consequently, the launch was first moved to an Angara A5 / Blok DM-03 configuration, and finally back to a Zenit-3F version which was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome on 26 December 2017, 19:00:00 UTC. The satellite was financed by Rosoboronexport with a 286.2 million euro loan. Payload AngoSat 1 is based on RKK Energia's USP Bus of Gazprom Space Systems' Yamal-heritage. Airbus Defence and Space (formerly Astrium) provides the payload. The satellite is designed for direct insertion into the geostationary orbit by the launch vehicle upper stage and therefore does not feature an apogee engine.http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/angosat-1.htm The AngoSat 1 payload is composed of 16 C band and 6 Ku band transponders supplied by Airbus Defence and Space.  Demise and replacement  On 26 December 2017, RKK Energia announced contact with AngoSat 1 was lost while the satellite was moving to its geostationary orbit due to low onboard batteries. On 27 December 2017, communications had been restored with the satellite after the satellite was properly aligned with the sun to allow the onboard batteries to recharge, but it is unclear whether the satellite could fully recover its operability. On 29 December 2017, Roscosmos and satellite manufacturer RKK Energia confirmed that its onboard systems were in good health. In the days after the contact was regained with AngoSat-1, the satellite continued drifting westward, according to NORAD data. But independent observers became alarmed, when by mid January, the Angosat had passed over its operational point without any visible attempt to slow down and stop its drift. RKK Energia issued a press release on 15 January 2018, disclosing that the telemetry from the satellite had allowed to reveal a problem in the Angosat's power supply system. The company stated that the spacecraft would leave the range of ground control stations before any additional troubleshooting tasks can be attempted. Since the satellite left the communications range of the mission control center in Korolev, the next attempt to contact the satellite and correct the problem was attempted in April 2018. The satellite failed to respond to signals, and was considered lost. The Russian government and RKK Energia have agreed to finance and provide a replacement satellite called AngoSat 2, with upgraded capabilities. The new satellite was expected to be completed within 18 months and delivered towards the end of 2019. In the meantime, Russia will loan Angola equivalent communications relay capacity on its existing satellite fleet. In January 2020, the Angosat-2 project's readiness status was unclear; rumors were published that the construction of the satellite had been taken away from RKK Energia and given to ISS Reshetnev. At the same time, Angolan press reported the satellite being 50% ready,http://russianspaceweb.com/angosat2.html for a launch in December 2021.https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/angosat-2.htm - 1 May 2020 References External links * SATBEAMS page * AngoSat official page Satellites using the USP bus 2017 in Angola Satellites of Angola First artificial satellite of a country Spacecraft launched in 2017 Spacecraft launched by Zenit and Energia rockets Communications satellites in geostationary orbit Derelict satellites orbiting Earth ","title":"AngoSat 1"},{"id":"51115596","text":"Events from the year 1903 in Russia Incumbents * Monarch ‚Äì Nicholas II Events *14 January - Opening of Hotel National, Moscow *dates unknown * Chernoe Znamia * Estonian Chess Championship * Kharovsk * Klavdiievo-Tarasove * Mensheviks * Rahum√§e cemetery * ≈†evƒç√≠k-Lhotsk√Ω Quartet * Zimin Opera *ongoing - Central Committee compositions elected by the 1st‚Äì3rd congresses of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party Births Deaths  References Years of the 20th century in the Russian Empire ","title":"1903 in Russia"},{"id":"51115617","text":"Martin is an unincorporated community in Armstrong Township, Vanderburgh County, in the U.S. state of Indiana.

Many porn stars have made scenes for the production company, among them are Bobby Clark, Landon Conrad, Rocco Reed, Luke Adams, William Seed, and Paddy O'Brian. History Beginning in October 2015 with the \\"Stealth Fuckers\\" series, Men.com began to introduce female characters into non-sexual roles, creating controversy over whether female performers belonged in gay porn. In January 2018, Men.com released a controversial scene featuring heterosexual sex and created a category for \\"bisexual porn\\". In August 2018, Men.com released its first scene featuring MMF bisexual porn titled \\"The Challenge\\", creating further controversy over whether bisexual porn belongs on a gay porn website. Men.com stated that they decided to feature bisexual content because \\"After asking our users what they would like to see, a surprisingly large number asked for a fully bisexual scene.\\" Arad Winwin, the star of the scene and a self-identified gay man, faced backlash from fans for acting in the scene, with some fans accusing him of being straight or of having \\"converted\\" to heterosexual or bisexual. Winwin told the gay website Str8UpGayPorn that \\"I'm a gay man...This was only a job, and it was nothing more. Nothing personal. I was working, and it was like any other scene I've done\\". In February 2019, Men.com released \\"He's Always Hard For Me\\", its first scene featuring a transgender man. The scene features transgender porn actor Luke Hudson and gay porn actor Dante Colle. In April, a second scene featuring a trans man was released. Some gay men have complained about the presence of transgender men on the website, leading the gay porn reporter Zachary Sires to respond by defending Men.com's decision, arguing that it was a smart business decision that could broaden Men.com's audience and that could lead some viewers to be more tolerant of transgender men. As of March 2019, Men.com no longer features more bisexual content. After the release of the Arad Winwin scene \\"left many angry gay porn fans in complete shock\\", the MindGeek conglomerate decided to create a separate studio for bisexual porn called WhyNotBi.com. In popular culture In January 2015, in the wake of several controversies involving Justin Bieber and his allegedly \\"out-of-control\\" behavior, Men.com posted an Internet ad featuring its most popular actor Johnny Rapid inviting the singer to do a sex scene with him for US$2 million.\\"A Gay Porn Site Just Offered Justin Bieber $2 Million To Film A Sex Scene.\\" NewNowNext from Logo. 2015-01-15.

These studies are generally used by clinicians and pathologists for adequate assessments of the growth and development of the fetus at any specific point of gestational maturity. Fetal height, fetal weight, head circumference (HC), crown to rump length (CR), dermatological observations like skin thickness etc. are measured individually to assess the growth and development of the organs and the fetus as a whole and can be a parameter for normal or abnormal development also including adaptation of the fetus to its newer environment. Another important factor that contributes towards the anthropometric measurement of the human fetal growth is the maternal nutrition and maternal well-being. Malnutrition, as already established by WHO, is a global serious health problem not only in adults but in pregnant and lactating mothers too and is a serious problem in third world countries. In Africa and South Asia, 27%-50% of women in the reproductive age are underweight resulting in 30 million low birth weight babies. For decades, the topic of question pertaining to crown-rump length (CR), crown-heel length (CH), head circumference (HC) with respect to the body weight of human fetus at different time periods of gestation has baffled many developmental researchers and biostatisticians. These biological variations are all based on linear curves based on human fetuses between 9 and 28 weeks of gestation. Co-relation of fetal weight and fetal growth Body weight, for example, is an important function and parameter for growth with respect to gestational age of the fetus. There will be great variations in the body weight of a 16 weeks old fetus. The weight will not be constant for every fetus and will vary from individual to individual. Therefore, rather than an appropriate or standard value, a range can be specified like 90 to 100 grams. This number of variations applies to all other anthropometric measurements. Often, the scientific world cover up their ignorance by stating that the rate of growth of particular human fetus depends on its intrinsic growth potential and environment provided by the normal mother. It is a visible function of the genetic potential. The fetal growth is not an individual growth and is dependent on the composite growth of the organs. Growth of the individual organs is controlled by the genetic potential, the environment provided by the mother and by the fetus itself. Scientists have or are trying to determine such relationships through series of investigations. Streetr, Schults et al., all studied the fetal dimensions obtained from spontaneous abortions and pathological pregnancies on mainly formed and fixed specimens. The growth of an organ from inception to a definitive functional stage is dependent on the integrated function of the whole organism which depends on a number of parameters such as the nucleic acid content of the cells which is one of the most important factors. Functioning of an organ is important for development of the organism.Schultz AH. \\"Fetal growth in man and other primates. A Nigerian study showed that the birth weight of the human fetus also depends upon the size and weight of the mother including her height and weight.Baird SD.The epidemiology of prematurity. J Paedit 1965;65: 909-923. Further a Polish study reported a similar report that some measurements like the ear height, muscular strength of the shoulders, skin fold thickness, mandibular breadth including the height of the upper and the lower limbs can be co- related to the mother also.Wolanski N, Spruch HC. Maternal regulation of intrauterine life: Anthropology of maternity. Charles University, Prague. 1977; 109-117 Similar observations were also reported by Gueri et al. One of the first original and unique works to be conducted on the anthropometric measurement of the human fetus in the Indian context was conducted by a group of scientists in Calcutta between 1977 and 1987 under the supervision of K.L.Mukherjee, a stalwart in the field of medical biochemistry in Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research. The researchers divided the fetuses into 6 groups consisting of A, B, C, D, E and F with a difference of 4 weeks of gestation period among the 6 groups. Group A had 90 fetuses of 9‚Äì12 weeks of gestation and the weight varied between 1-14 grams. Group B had 337 fetuses, age 13‚Äì16 weeks of gestation with weight variation between 15-105 grams whereas the third group had 435 fetuses of 17‚Äì20 weeks of gestation with a weight range between 106-310 grams. Group D consisted of 531 fetuses of 21‚Äì24 weeks and weight between 331-640 grams and Group E had fetuses of the age range 25‚Äì28 weeks of gestation and weight 640-1070 grams. The last two groups F and G had fetuses with gestation period between 29-32 and 33‚Äì36 weeks. All aborted fetuses were collected after permission from the Institute Ethics committee followed with donor consent form with primary objective being the aborted mother's health and safety. Liver growth Researchers observed that the liver weight is directly proportional to the body weight. At 8‚Äì12 weeks of gestation, liver is a relatively bigger organ which forms 4-5-5.5% of the total body weight and protrudes through the abdominal wall. By 13 to 32 weeks of gestation, it forms 3.4% to 4.0% of the total body weight. The liver weight hence forms a more or less constant proportion of the total body weight of the fetus. Growth of the lung Although in adult life, the lung is the only major respiratory organ, in case of fetal life such is not the case though the fetal lung is known to expand and contract in the last phase of development. Both the weight of the right and left lungs are normally assessed at different periods of gestation and is expressed as a function of the total body weight. An irregular graph was observed by K.L.Mukherjee and his group instead of the standard normal linear graphs which should be normally observed after plotting a graph of weight of the lungs expressed as gm/kg of body weight against the body weight. This relationship was observed from fetuses weighing 350 grams to 850 grams after which the rate of the growth became uniformly proportional again. Brain and Central nervous System Brain and the central nervous system are the two most important components of the fetus. Further analysis by this same group involved the CNS up to the medulla at 2nd cervical vertebral level. The process of analyzing the fetal brain and the CNS involved dissecting out the whole brain tissue followed by decantation of an 8.5 weeks old fetal brain weighing 15 grams. The brain at this time had already assumed the appearance of primary divisions and flexures, and the prosen, messen and rhombocephalon already gave rise to the different brain- derived constituents like rhinocephalon, corporastriata, cerebral cortex, hypo and epithalamus and pons medulla to a less differentiation extent. The growth of the fetal brain from this time onwards was proportional to the body weight although some brains from other groups showed variations at the same stage between 20% to even 12% or 13% of the body weight by and large. Scientists are still yet to find an explanation for this. Kidney and the Adrenal Glands In the early gestational period, the weight of the adrenal glands outweighs even the metanephric kidneys and is comparatively a larger organ. After the 10th week of gestation, the kidney grows at a much rapid rate than the adrenal glands. Hence with an increase in gestational time, i.e. by the 12th week of gestation, both the kidneys and adrenal glands measure the same. Post 12 weeks the kidneys measure more than the adrenal glands. However, the Adrenal gland is a larger organ in the fetus than the adult. The same group of researchers further observed that with the increase of fetal age, the adrenal glands also weigh more as observed by the research group in 90 human fetuses. However, the rate of increase is not uniform and varies throughout the fetal growth like other organs. Human fetal testes The growth of the fetal testes is not uniform as revealed through various other studies. The weight of the right testes weighed more than the weight of the left testes. Exceptions were however noticed in some of the cases as reported by K.L.Mukherjee and his group. Normally like all other organs the growth of the testes including its weight also increases with increase in the gestational period. The research group through their graph plot studies further examined that the growth of testes was not uniform with proportional growth at the initial stages. It soon flattened to increase with different spikes consistently throughout the whole length of the gestational period. Further the weight of the human testes marked as mg/100 gram of body weight was investigated and was observed that there was a steep decline in the early gestation period from about 200 mg/100 gram of body weight to roughly about 60 mg/ 100 gram of body weight when the fetal weight was about 1.5 grams to 20 grams. In the case of a 1.6-kilogram fetus, the testes weighed only 20 mg/100 gram of body weight. This decline was however not maintained uniformly. Growth of the Human fetal ovaries A steep decline in the ovarian weight in the early gestational period was observed though it was not a uniformly maintained decline. With increase in the gestational time, progressive weight of the ovaries was found and in most cases, the weight of the ovaries was identical to the weight of the fetuses although some exceptions were observed by the group.  Fetal Thymus growth  At 8 weeks of gestation when the fetus weighed 1 gram, the thymus could not be detected. In many of the 39 fetuses weighing around 1.3-14.7 grams, the thymus tissues could not be dissected by the group especially in the smaller fetuses due to its non-detection. Fetuses weighing more than or equal to 5 grams could be detected. Plotting a graph it was observed that thymus organ formed 52 mg/100 gram of body weight in case of a 5 gram fetus. Further study on 28 fetuses weighing 15 to 100 grams revealed the thymic weight to be 77 mg per 100 grams of the body weight. The relative growth of the thymus was more in this group compared to all the earlier observations. A further group including 39 fetuses weighing between 100-300 grams showed a fetal thymic weight between 136 mg/100 gram to 77 mg/ 100 gram. In fetuses up to 28 weeks, it was observed by scientists that the fetal thymic weight was the highest and was in contrast to many other organs like brain, liver which constitute more or less constant proportion of the body weight with very few exceptions. Therefore, it was inferred that with an increase in the gestational period, the thymic weight also increase although exceptions were observed. Conclusion Growth and development throughout the fetal life are two most important factors which determine the growth rate of each individual and their specific organs. This process of maturation and development of the organs are observed in postnatal life also. With an increase in gestational time, the fetal organs also grow in progression to the body weight, the phenomenon which is still not understood clearly by many researchers. Some believe that genetic potentiality of the different endocrine organs related to the growth and various other unidentified processes mediate the whole phenomenon.

He made his MLB debut with the Washington Nationals in 2016. Career =Minor Leagues= L√≥pez signed with the Washington Nationals as an international free agent in June 2012. His signing bonus of just $17,000 was relatively tiny compared to most other contemporaneous Latin American prospects that would reach his same level of success in the minor leagues. The lower signing bonus may have been because Lopez took several years off of baseball to finish his highschool degree, and signed at age 18. He made his professional debut that season with the Dominican Summer League Nationals where he pitched to a 1-1 record and 3.38 ERA in 10.2 innings pitched. L√≥pez started one game each for both the Auburn Doubledays and Hagerstown Suns in 2013. He pitched for the same two teams in 2014, starting 16 games and finishing with a 7-3 record and 1.08 ERA. In 2015, he pitched for the Potomac Nationals where he was 6-7 with a 4.09 ERA in 19 starts. L√≥pez started the 2016 season with the Harrisburg Senators. After posting a 3.18 ERA with the Senators through 14 starts, he was promoted to the Syracuse Chiefs on June 27, 2016.

After he allowed three batters to reach base and gave up two more runs in the fifth inning, he was relieved.

Background and characterization Simmons is of mixed Caucasian and Korean parentage (like actor Daniel Henney) and it is implied that he was ostracized by his paternal grandparents, who were against his parents' union. His late mother was born in Korea before the Korean War. According to Simmons, she had spent much of her adulthood trying to assimilate and \\"forget\\" her past, although she did teach him Korean. He is a native of Carson City, Michigan and worked in Detroit for some time before joining the FBI. He was formerly a member of the FBI's International Response Team (IRT) and has some prior history with Agents Derek Morgan (Shemar Moore) and Jennifer \\"JJ\\" Jareau (A.J. Cook) of the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit. When introduced, Simmons and his wife Kristy (Kelly Frye) have four young children: sons Jake and David and twin daughters, Chloe and Lily. In the season 14 finale of Criminal Minds, Kristy revealed to him that she was pregnant with their fifth child, and early in season 15, gives birth to their third daughter, Rose Mary. It was stated in Season 13 of Criminal Minds that the couple have been married for almost ten years. Like Jack Garrett (Gary Sinise), Simmons' full and fulfilling family life was a deliberate choice. Daniel Henney said of his character, \\"His big struggle is, when can I get home to see my kids and how much is my wife working?\\". A United States Army veteran, little is known about Simmons' military service. Simmons is known for his resourcefulness and \\"always [has] a guy\\" to turn to for help whenever the team hits a dead end. Like most of the IRT he knows several languages and is shown to be fluent in Arabic, Spanish and Korean. Highly resourceful and adaptable, he thinks quickly on his feet and is often tasked with coordinating search and rescue efforts or navigating unfamiliar terrain. Simmons has an eclectic variety of interests, ranging from sports to vintage cars. In the episode \\"Harvested\\", in which the team investigates a case in Mumbai, India, his knowledge of cricket, India's unofficial national sport, proves useful in building a rapport with the local police officers. Character arc =In Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders= In the episode \\"Love Interrupted\\", Simmons is forced to shoot serial killer Antonio Cayetan (Jonathan Medina) to prevent him from killing his own young daughter in a fit of desperate rage. Cayetan had suffered a breakdown after losing his wife. He then kidnapped newlywed couples, killing and cannibalizing the groom and taking the brides as his \\"wives\\", even impregnating them. Simmons later admits to Garrett that the case affected him more than he would like because the girl reminded him of his own daughters. Simmons and Clara Seger (Alana De La Garza) made an appearance in the Criminal Minds season 12 episode \\"Spencer\\" to help out their colleagues at the BAU prove Dr. Spencer Reid's (Matthew Gray Gubler) innocence after he was imprisoned in Mexico after being found in possession of drugs. Simmons and the IRT had been in Costa Rica working a case when they received the call for help. In the season 2 episode \\"Pretty Like Me\\", Simmons takes some time off to fulfill his late mother's dying wish to find her biological mother in her birth country of South Korea. She had been left at an orphanage around the time of the Korean War and moved to the United States at some point with Simmons' father. Because of the disruption and loss of records caused by the war, she was never able to fulfill her wish before her death. Simmons, however, was finally able to track down and meet his grandmother. =In Criminal Minds= Simmons was introduced to Criminal Minds in \\"Beyond Borders\\" in which the IRT is called in to help the BAU with the death of a family overseas. He is brought in by Technical Analyst Penelope Garcia to help the team after they are ambushed in the field and Agent Emily Prentiss (Paget Brewster) is kidnapped by serial killer Peter Lewis (Bodhi Elfman). When asked what he is doing at the BAU headquarters, Simmons vaguely mentions that he is awaiting a new assignment as the IRT had been dissolved as a result of events in the Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders episode \\"Blowback\\" ‚Äì in which the IRT had been targeted by Assistant Director Linda Barnes (Kim Rhodes), who herself would have the BAU shut down temporarily ‚Äì and is offered a position on the BAU team by Prentiss by the end of the episode. As he and Jareau are the only two members of the team who are married with children, they often exchange jokes about the mishaps of parenting. In the episode \\"Ex Parte\\", Kristy is caught up in a hostage situation at her workplace. The usually calm and collected Simmons nearly strangles the hostage taker to death in a fit of rage but stops when Kristy tells him \\"It's not you\\", prompting her husband to let go of the criminal and arrest him instead. In the season 14 episode \\"Rule 34\\", it is revealed that Kristy had been going for therapy due to trauma from the hostage incident. Their son David (Declan Whaley) is suspended from school after physically lashing out at a friend over a comment regarding cop shows. He admits to his parents that his classmate losing her mother brought about fears for his own parents' safety, especially his father's, given the dangerous nature of his job. Character development and casting Henney stated that he had accepted the role as it was a departure from Asian stereotypes perpetuated by Hollywood and the American entertainment industry. In an interview with August Man, he described his character as \\"a really interesting character for an Asian- American actor to play because it's never been done before.\\" In both shows, Simmons is one of two main characters on the show who is happily married with children, the other being his supervisor Jack Garrett (Gary Sinise) on Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders and Jennifer \\"JJ\\" Jareau on Criminal Minds. Showrunner Erica Messer noted that both Matt Simmons and Jack Garrett share similarities and, in conceiving Simmons as a younger agent with both a successful career and family life, hoped \\"to show that this kind of lifestyle can work\\".

Life Stevens was born in August 1802. in New Canaan, Connecticut. He attended Yale College (1824‚Äì1828) and Yale Divinity School (1829‚Äì1832), serving as a teacher and principal at a school in Aurora, New York, in between. While at Yale, he befriended Peter Parker, who later became a medical missionary to Guangdong; in April 1832, while at its seminary, he accepted appointment as the American Seamen's Friend Society's chaplain at Guangzhou (then romanized \\"Canton\\"). He was one of three foreign missionaries sent out by the ASFS around that time, along with John Diell to Honolulu in the Kingdom of Hawaii and F.S. Mines to Marseilles, France. Ordained as a minister on June 7, he received $376.19 in donations from the New Haven ASFS to help pay his way and a further $50 from its United Society's Missionary Association to print tracts and Bibles in China. He travelled to Philadelphia and left aboard the Morrison on June 29, and, despite falling ill through the first half of his journey, arrived off Nei Lingding (\\"Lintin\\"), the oceanic anchorage for ships entering or leaving Guangzhou, on October 24. He reached Guangzhou two days later. He succeeded David Abeel as the ASFS's chaplain at Huangpu (\\"Whampoa\\") on what is now Pazhou. At the time, there were 42 ships at Whampoa, with about 2000 Britons, Americans, and Dutch, all of whom were generally limited to the three islands of Pazhou (\\"Whampoa\\"), Xiaoguwei (\\"French Island\\"), and Changzhou (\\"Dane's Island\\"). There were also another 20 ships and 900 seamen at Nei Lingding.. Stevens also served as a chaplain to the foreigners resident at Guangzhou's Thirteen Factories trading ghetto and worked under a special arrangement which also placed him under the supervision of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions.. He worked with the ABCFM's missionary Elijah Bridgman and printer Samuel Wells Williams until 1836. The three welcomed Peter Parker at his arrival on 26 October 1834. Stevens learned some Chinese and wrote essays published in the Chinese Repository. He was among the dozen members of the Christian Union of Canton, which Bridgman and Robert Morrison consulted prior to their January 1835 call for more missionaries for China. In defiance of Qing laws, Stevens repeatedly made voyages along China's coast. In March 1834. or April 14 or May 1835,. he travelled with Karl G√ºtzlaff and Gordon from Nei Lingding on the brig Governor Findlay. They intended to explore the Min River's Wuyi Range (\\"Bohea Hills\\") in search of its high-quality tea to transplant to British India, while he looked at the prospects for evangelization in China's interior. Reaching the river's mouth on May 6, they transferred to the ship's boat to travel upriver. They passed Fuzhou (\\"Foochow\\") but, on May 11, were fired upon from both banks of the river by the garrison at Meicheng (\\"Min-tsing\\"). They reached the Governor Findlay on the 13th and returned to Macao, having gotten about upriver and procured some Wuyi seeds. Stevens felt the expedition would \\"go to prove that the interior of China cannot be traversed with impunity by foreigners. The erection of new, and the repairing of old, forts, and the garrisoning of deserted military stations, all indicate a sort of indefinite apprehension of danger from abroad. The vigilance of the imperial officers in the interior forbids the hope that a foreigner can penetrate far without detection\\". He noted, however, that millions of coastal Chinese could be visited by missionaries briefly. On 26 August 1835, he joined the LMS missionary Walter Medhurst on a two-month tour and survey of the coast as far north as Shandong aboard D.W.C. Olyphant's brig Huron.. The pair passed out around 18,000 books and tracts while encountering varying levels of interest and hostility. As did G√ºtzlaff before them, they found curiosity and eagerness for books when officials were not present, coolness when they were, and increasing animosity as the imperial government became aware of the voyage and exerted pressure on the area's mandarins, particularly to block Stevens and Medhurst's attempts to travel inland. They returned to Nei Lingding on October 31. Stevens also joined Tradescant Lay on the Himmaleh on another, less successful coastal tour, despite the Huron voyage having prompted the imperial council to issue mandates to the coastal viceroys to strenuously oppose any more such expeditions. Stevens became directly affiliated with the ABCFM's work among the Chinese on 7 July 1835 or March 1836. After the Chinese convert and missionary Liang Fa began distributing tracts with Qu Ya'ang to the candidates attempting the prefectural and provincial examinations, Stevens joined Liang in missionizing at the Guangzhou testing grounds.. He is generally believed to have been the foreign missionary who gave Hong Xiuquan his copy of Liang Fa's 1832 Good Words to Admonish the Age after his second failed imperial examination in Guangzhou. Its ideas were later adapted by Hong in his preaching of an idiosyncratic form of Christianity which led to the Taiping Rebellion of the 1850s and '60s. On 3 December 1836, he departed Macao with Tradescant Lay on the Himmaleh to explore the prospects for evangelization on Borneo and through the Indonesian islands (the \\"Indian archipelago\\"). They reached Singapore on the 15th but Stevens contracted an \\"intermittent fever\\" which forced him to remain there.. He died on January 5, 1837. Works Stevens wrote \\"a good deal\\" for various periodicals in the United States and China, chiefly for the Chinese Repository.

Early life and family John Webb was born in Washington D.C. to Martin Taylor Webb (1885-1970) and his wife, the former Lilie M. Cobourn (1882-1960). He received an LLM degree from the Washington College of Law. Webb married Harriet Shelton Rhinehardt and had several children. He served in the U.S. Army's 11th Airborne Division in the Pacific Theater in World War II, and was active in the Freemasons. Career After admission to the Virginia bar, Webb practiced in Fairfax County, Virginia. He also served as President of the Fairfax Bar Association, as well as was Chairman of the Board of the Bank of Annandale. He was also President of the McDonald Corporation of Hampton, Virginia and the McDonald Corporation of Norfolk, Virginia. In 1953, Webb and Omer L. Hirst were elected to represent Falls Church and Fairfax in northern Virginia in the Virginia General Assembly, a part-time position. They replaced Edwin W. Lynch, who was the only delegate elected to represent fast-growing Fairfax between 1946 and 1951. Webb was soon embroiled in the Massive Resistance crisis whereby the Byrd Organization following the lead of U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd refused to allow desegregation of Virginia's schools after the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education. Webb and fellow delegates Kathryn H. Stone of nearby Arlington and Republican Vernon S. Shaffer of Shenandoah County became the only three delegates to oppose all seven anti- NAACP laws contained in the Stanley Plan. Thus, Webb's was one of the few moderate voices during the special legislative session that ultimately adopted the Stanley Plan, portions of which were declared unconstitutional by both the Virginia Supreme Court and a three judge federal panel on January 19, 1959.Benjamin Muse, Virginia's Massive Resistance (Indiana University Press 1961) p. 33 at the Internet Archive at https://archive.org/stream/virginiasmassive013514mbp/virginiasmassive013514mbp_djvu.txt Hirst declined to seek reelection, and after a multi-candidate Democratic primary Dorothy S. McDiarmid, who ran against the Byrd Organization's school closing strategy and was elected (and Webb was re-elected) in November, 1959. Webb was again re-elected in 1961, although McDiarmid was temporarily defeated by Republican Glenn A. Burklund in that election. Nearly a decade after his first electoral win, Webb (together with Stone and Senators C. Harrison Mann and John A. K. Donovan) became named plaintiffs in the reapportionment case ultimately decided (in Northern Virginia's favor) by the U.S. Supreme Court in Davis v. Mann. The case had been brought because after the 1960 census, the Byrd Organization refused to accord the fast-growing areas in northern Virginia representation in Virginia's General Assembly proportionate to the number of voters. Whereas Webb represented over 100,000 citizens, delegates from some districts in rural Southside Virginia represented only about 20,000 voters.

In total, his oeuvre comprises 82 works with opus numbers and about 40 without. While Madetoja composed in all genres, he found his greatest success with the orchestra: symphonies, operas, cantatas, and orchestral miniatures all flowed from his pen. Curiously, he composed no concerti, although at various times in his career he hinted at plans for a violin concerto. Madetoja was also an accomplished composer for voice, as his numerous choral pieces and songs for voice and piano evidence; he found less success with‚Äîand composed sparingly for‚Äîsolo piano. Finally, Madetoja wrote little for chamber ensemble after his student years, although it is unclear if this was due to insufficient skill or waning interest in the genre. Today, Madetoja is primarily remembered for his set of three symphonies (1916, 1918, and 1926, respectively); two operas, The Ostrobothnians (1924) and Juha (1935); the ballet-pantomime, Okon Fuoko (1927); the Elegia from the Symphonic Suite (1909); the Kalevalic symphonic poem, Kullervo (1913); and, The Garden of Death (1918, r. 1919), a three-movement suite for solo piano. In the inventory that follows, the dates provided indicate the year of composition, unless otherwise preceded by an \\"r.\\", for revision; an \\"a.\\", for arrangement; or, an \\"fp.\\", for first performance. Where possible, names in the original Finnish are included, with English translations in parentheses. At present, this list is incomplete, particularly in the songs and choral works subsections.

The destroyers of the 1908‚Äì09 program would be the last coal-fired destroyers of the Royal Navy. She and her sisters served in the First Destroyer Flotilla then were moved en masse to the Third Destroyer Flotilla and before the start of the Great War to the Fifth Destroyer Flotilla. With the advent of the convoy system they were moved to the Second Destroyer Flotilla. With the Armistice she was laid up then scrapped in 1921. Construction and design Laid down as Yard number 387 on 17 March 1909 at the John Brown & Company's shipyard at Clydebank, Beagle was launched on 16 October 1909.Friedman 2009, p. 305.

On 30 August 1912 the Admiralty directed all destroyer classes were to be designated by alpha characters starting with the letter 'A'. After 30 September 1913, she was known as a G Class destroyer and had the letter ‚ÄòG‚Äô painted on her hull below the bridge area and on her fore funnel. In October 1913 as the L-class destroyers came on line the entire G-class was moved to the Mediterranean as the newly formed Fifth Destroyer Flotilla along with the depot ship Blenheim.Manning 1961, p. 25. With war clouds looming on 2 August 1914 the Fifth Destroyer Flotilla was involved in the search for and in the Mediterranean. On 3 August, the 3rd Division of the 5th Flotilla (Beagle, , and ) were at Malta and while it was initially planned that they reinforce Rear Admiral Ernest Troubridge's squadron patrolling the entrance to the Adriatic, they remained at Malta until 6 August, when Beagle and Bulldog left in company with the cruiser .Naval Staff Monograph No. 21, pp. 13, 28. Goeben and Breslau had been spotted by the cruiser east of the Straits of Messina later that day, with Gloucester shadowing the two German ships on their course towards Cape Matapan. Dublin and her two destroyers were ordered to intercept Goeben and Breslau, and expected to make a night torpedo attack off Zante. Breslau was sighted and chased for a while, but the ships turned away to intercept the more important Goeben, but missed the German battlecruiser during the night.Corbett 1920, pp. 64‚Äì65.Marder 2013, pp. 25‚Äì26.Naval Staff Monograph No. 21, pp. 30‚Äì33. On 9 August, Beagle and Bulldog joined the 1st Division at Port Vathi on the Island of Ithaca off the west coast of Greece. The units of the 1st Division were short of coal and were awaiting the arrival of a collier.Naval Staff Monograph No. 4, p. 202.The Naval Review Vol. 7, No. 4, pp. 518. After coaling the ten destroyers were ordered to establish a patrol line in the Aegean Sea off the Dardanelles thereby blockading the German ships there. In November 1914, as a response to a shortage of destroyers in home waters, Beagle was recalled to Britain, reaching Plymouth on 29 November, and being used to operate from Portsmouth, patrolling the routes used by cross-Channel transports.Naval Staff Monograph No. 28, pp. 74‚Äì75. It had been planned to use the Beagles to equip a new Tenth Destroyer Flotilla based at Harwich, but the need for escorts for transports in the Channel led to these plans being abandoned, and the ships remained at Portsmouth.Naval Staff Monograph No. 28, pp. 81‚Äì82.

On 25 April 1915, Beagle took part in the Landing at Anzac Cove, carrying troops of the 9th Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment who were landed in row boats.Dorling 1931, pp. 60‚Äì61.Bean 1941, pp. 245‚Äì247, 262‚Äì267. On the night of 12/13 May, the pre-dreadnought battleships and were anchored in Morto Bay, supporting French troops. To protect the two battleships, Beagle and Bulldog patrolled the north side of the straits, with and patrolling the southern side and in the centre of the straits. Despite these patrols, the Turkish destroyer managed to sneak past Beagle and Bulldog on the northern side of the straits and torpedoed and sunk Goliath before successfully escaping.Corbett 1921, pp. 406‚Äì408. On 28 June Beagle, together with the destroyers Bulldog, and escorted the cruiser as she provided naval gun support to the advancing British and Indian troops during the Battle of Gully Ravine.Corbett 1923, p. 71. The British made another attempt to break the stalemate at Gallipoli on 6‚Äì7 August 1915, with the Landing at Suvla Bay, to the north of Anzac Cove. This time, instead of row-boats, armoured shallow-draught self-propelled landing craft known as \\"Beetles\\" were used, which were towed close to shore by destroyers. While the main landing took place on Nibrunesi beach to the south of Sulva Bay, Beagle, together with Bulldog and landed troops of the 34th Brigade in Sulva Bay itself. Each destroyer carried 500 troops aboard, while towing a \\"Beetle\\" carrying a further 500 troops. The \\"Beetles\\" would land their troops and then return to pick up the remaining troops on the destroyers and land them. While the landings on Nibrunesi beach went well, those in Sulva Bay were less successful, landing to the south of the planned place, with the result that the \\"Beetles\\" ran aground off shore, with the remaining troops aboard the destroyers having to be landed by reserve row boats. Beagles troops were not all landed until nearly 5:00 AM on 7 August, several hours late.Dorling 1931, pp. 78‚Äì82.Corbett 1923, p. 93. Beagle helped to cover the evacuations from Anzac Cove on 20 December 1915.Corbett 1923, p. 241. On 13 December 1916 Beagle and were involved in a friendly fire incident when on patrol near Kum Kale. Both destroyers raced to engage a low flying aircraft. HMS Racoon fired four shells causing damaged to the aircraft and forcing it to alight on the water. HMS Racoon rescued the French pilot and observer then towed the aircraft to Kephelo Air Base on Imbros.The Naval Review Vol. 6, p. 58. On 9 January 1917, Beagle was escorting the pre-dreadnought , on passage from Mudros to Malta, when Cornwallis was torpedoed twice by the German submarine . When attempts at damage control failed and it was clear that Cornwallis was sinking, Beagle went alongside the battleship and took off her crew. After this was complete, and Beagle had pushed off from Cornwallis, U-32 struck the battleship with a third torpedo. An attempt by Beagle to depth charge the German submarine was unsuccessful. Fifteen of Cornwalliss crew were lost in her sinking.Naval Staff Monograph 34 1933, p. 166.Kemp 1999, p. 46. In mid-1917 as the convoy system was being introduced, the Admiralty began reassigning older destroyers to escort duties. She was recalled to home waters and assigned to the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla now based at Buncrana, near Lough Swilly in the north of Ireland in October 1917. Equipped with depth charges she was employed for anti-submarine patrols and as a convoy escort for the North West Approaches to the British Isles for the remainder of the war. Disposition By March 1919, with the disbandment of the Second Destroyer Flotilla she was withdrawn from active service and laid up in reserve at the Nore. In April 1920 she was placed on the disposal list. She was sold on 1 November 1921 to B. Fryer of Sunderland for breaking.Dittmar and Colledge 1971, p. 60.

While there he comes to know his English family roots for the first time and is initially seduced by the show of class and privilege. But his experiences in the war gradually change his attitudes, and he finally returns to Australia a very changed man.

The sweep required by the saga did not adapt easily to the narrow, more rigid unity of the aesthetically patterned novel and the final attempt to write the, saga as a sequence of self-contained novels was hampered by the necessity to convey the amplitude of the saga in the confines of schematic pattern. \\"When Blackbirds Sing\\" seems to be more successful because it throws out almost the whole Langton family and concentrates on the troubled consciousness and feelings of a single member, Dominic Langton, who is the hero not of a saga wedded to the novel of psychological realism, but of the latter alone.\\"\\"Writers' World\\" by Maurice Dunlevy, The Canberra Times, 27 March 1971, p14 Reviewing the 2014 release from Text in Southerly Shaun Bell notes: \\"Difficult to define in terms of genre and uneasily placed in canonical formations, the expected and characteristic nostalgia in Boyd‚Äôs treatment of a belated anglo-Australianism aligned with British colonialism is curiously absent.

The record is a follow-up to Sketches from an Island (2014), a record based on Barrott's experiences living in Ibiza. Sketches from an Island 2 is a balearic downtempo album with the same concept, and was also produced by Barrott with the same equipment used for making Sketches from an Island. Sketches from an Island 2 garnered generally favorable reviews from music journalists, some reviewers spotlighting its musical style. Background and production When interviewed about his life and his debut studio album Sketches from an Island (2014) in March 2016, Mark Barrott said that he was not willing to make another record influenced by his experiences living in Ibiza: \\"If I was banned from making another field recording, I‚Äôd be good for 20 years. You want Barcelona airport? Bora Bora sunset? Tokyo bullet train station? The interior of a fucking boat? I‚Äôve got enough.\\" Barrott was \\"about as interested [...] in doing another Sketches record as [he was] in eating cat shit raw.‚Äù Barrott used money from the sales of Sketches from an Island to buy more music equipment for his next LP. However, this led him to be more focused on purchasing music production products than actually creating new tracks. In the winter of 2016, he got rid of the equipment he bought and only used a slide guitar, a small-sized MIDI keyboard and a laptop for making his next album as he did in producing Sketches from an Island. As Barrott recalled, \\"it became about the music[,] not the equipment and everything happened really quickly\\". When Barrott starting working on Sketches from an Island 2, he originally planned it to be an extended play with a concept representing a Thursday where Barrott was DJing at La Torre, a municipality in Cap Negret, Ibiza. The day began with Barrott eating with a friend and going to Dieters, the recording place of Barrott's first album, before going to La Torre. Barrott \\"just kept on writing and writing, and the EP became the album\\". Composition Labeled by a reviewer for NPR Music as a \\"soundtrack to nature as a psychedelic trip\\",Orlov, Piotr (23 June 2016). \\"Review: Mark Barrott, 'Sketches From An Island 2'\\". NPR Music. Retrieved 19 July 2016. Sketches from an Island 2 is a balearic downtempo record with more of a \\"relaxed mood\\" than its predecessor, according to Resident Advisor. The Ibiza island concept is also symbolized by what Pitchfork critic Andy Beta described as the album's \\"beautiful, spare melodicism\\". He wrote that \\"Forgotten Island\\" and \\"One Slow Thought\\", the album's final two cuts, were the most \\"evocative\\" works in Barrott's discography to date. He analyzed that \\"Over at Dieter's Place\\" uses instruments and sounds such as a pedal steel guitar, a mbira, birdcall, woodwinds, and a hand drum to \\"render\\" Ibiza's \\"bucolic miniatures\\" that Cluster, a group that musician Dieter Moebius was a part of, emulated in their works. The Arts Desk and the Financial Times spotlighted Sketches from an Island 2's \\"rich\\" combination of genres; \\"Der Stern, Der Nie Vergeht\\" (English: ‚Äúthe star that never fades‚Äù) is an ambient krautrock track, its instrumentation consisting of a talking drum, a fretless bass guitar, and a digital synthesizer lead melody that mimics an analog synth texture. \\"Cirrus & Cumulus\\" has a \\"mesmerising minimalist melody\\" over \\"bird song and electronic drones\\". Beta noted that some tracks contains elements of musical styles and artists that the balearic genre is commonly associated with; these include the \\"stiff swing\\" of production music on ‚ÄúBrunch With Suki‚Äù and the guitars of ‚ÄúDriving To Cap Negret‚Äù that the reviewer compared to the works of Chris Rea and Andreas Vollenweider. Resident Advisor wrote that some parts on the record, like the mallet and strings on \\"Over at Dieter's Place\\", are reminiscent of styles like new wave. Elements of gamelan music on ‚ÄúCirrus & Cumulus‚Äù and \\"Over At Dieter's Place\\" are also present. Critical reception Sketches from an Island 2 received favorable reviews from critics. Allmusic journalist Timothy Monger wrote that it had \\"enchanting, easily digestible rhythmic soundscapes that recall the golden era of pre-gift shop new age music\\" at best, but also contained tracks like \\"Brunch with Suki\\" and \\"Driving to Cap Negret\\" that \\"feel a bit more like Ibeza hangover helpers and pass by without much notice\\" at worst. He called the record a \\"winsome set\\" overall. Andy Beta of Pitchfork praised the album as one of the few \\"sequel\\" albums ever released to \\"improve\\" its predecessor, while Resident Advisor's called the album a \\"welcome reprise\\" of Sketches from an Island, his only criticism being the record is too similar to the previous album. The Arts Desk reviewer Barney Harsent suggested Barrott's previous experiences living in places other than Ibiza, such as Germany, France and Uruguay, strongly contributed to the quality of the album. Harsent wrote that the album \\"remains as convincing an argument for embracing other cultures as I can imagine.\\" Track listing and credits All tracks written and produced by Mark Barrott, mixed by Lopazz and mastered by Lewis Hopkins.

It is a shrub with narrow leaves and is often covered with masses of creamy-white coloured flowers in late spring. Description Verticordia roei is a shrub which grows to a height of with a single main stem at its base. The leaves on the stems are linear to narrow elliptic in shape, triangular in cross-section, long and have a rounded end. The flowers are scented and arranged in corymb-like groups on erect stalks from long. The floral cup is a broadly hemispherical in shape, about long, ribbed and covered with short hairs. The sepals are creamy-white, sometimes pink, long, with 5 to 7 long-hairy or feathery lobes. The petals are a similar colour to the sepals, long, dished with small teeth around its edge. The style is long, with a few short hairs. Flowering time is from October to November. Taxonomy and naming Verticordia roei was first formally described by Stephan Endlicher in 1838 and the description was published in Stirpium Australasicarum Herbarii Hugeliani Decades Tres. The type specimen was collected by John Septimus Roe. The specific epithet (roei) honours Roe, the first surveyor-general of Western Australia. Alex George undertook a review of the genus Verticordia in 1991 and described two subspecies: * Verticordia roei Endl. subsp. roei which has stamens long and styles long; * Verticordia roei subsp. meiogona A.S.George which has stamens long and styles long. George placed this species in subgenus Verticordia, section Catocalypta along with V. inclusa, V. apecta, V. insignis, V. habrantha, V. lehmannii and V. pritzelii. Distribution and habitat This verticordia usually occurs in sandy soil, often with clay or loam over laterite. Subspecies roei is widespread and locally common in areas between Merredin, Boorabbin, Wickepin, Hyden and Lake Grace in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie, Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic regions. Subspecies meiogona has a smaller distribution near Dalwallinu and Mukinbudin in the Avon Wheatbelt and Coolgardie bioregions. Conservation Subspecies meiogona is classified as \\"Priority One\\" meaning that it is known from only one or a few locations which are potentially at risk. Subspecies roei is classified as \\"not threatened\\". Use in horticulture Subspecies roei has proven to be difficult to propagate and maintain in cultivation but more success has been achieved with subspecies meiogona. The latter subspecies has been grown from cuttings and by grafting onto Chamelaucium uncinatum rootstock.

A large number of fossilised tree specimens from the family Araucariaceae have been found in New Zealand, but in many cases the level of preservation is not sufficient to reliably distinguish between Araucaria species (related to extant modern trees such as the Norfolk pine) and Agathis species (related to New Zealand's iconic Kauri tree). Araucaria haastii is known from some of the better preserved fossils, found in Cretaceous sediments from several sites in the South Island. These fossils show sufficiently detailed morphology and cuticular structure in the leaves to allow this species not only to be definitively identified as an Araucaria, but also to place it within the Intermedia section of this genus, meaning that its closest living relative is the Klinki pine found in the mountains of Papua New Guinea. North Island fossil specimens from the same time period appear to be from a closely related but slightly distinct species of Araucaria, though the relatively poorer quality of the fossils means that the identification is not so precise. Related species of tree are also known from fossils found in Tasmania and South America, reflecting the broad Gondwanan distribution of the family Araucariaceae.Edwards BA.

Overview  All through its history Mexico has been a net importer of coal, and most of Mexico's coal output has been consumed domestically. Until 1910, most of it powered regional railroads. Since 1910, it has primarily gone to fuel Mexico's steel production and related industries. Annual coal production peaked in 1925 at 1.45 million tons, declined in the 1930s, then surged again because of the demand for steel during World War II. (By contrast, coal extraction in the United States is forecast to peak some time in the 21st century.) In the 21st century Mexico burns coal for energy generation and for steelmaking.

Retrieved on 26 December 2015. with 1.3 billion tons.  History  1893 South Pacific railroad network, showing Mexican International Railroad route Exploitation of coal resources was known since the days of Spanish rule, as European methods of resource extraction crossed the Atlantic. The first identified coal field in the country in the country is the Rio Sabinas basin, west of the old capital city of Monclova. The first Mexican mine to produce coal on an industrial scale was the Alamo Mine, in San Felipe, Coahuila, in 1884. American railroad magnate C.P. Huntington established the Mexican International Railroad in 1882, running south from Piedras Negras, Coahuila, as part of the Southern Pacific Railroad. In Coahuila Huntington bought his coal supplies from local landowners, including Evaristo Madero,son of Jos√© Francisco Madero, grandfather of Mexican president Francisco I. Madero, and Governor of Coahuila for local use, and to ship back north to the U.S. to supply Southern Pacific trains.at the rate of 3,000 tons per month by 1890; A bitter contract dispute in 1886 disrupted that relationship and changed the market. Within a few years Huntington himself controlled at least four local producers (the Sabinas Coal Mines Company, the Coahuila Coal Mine Company, the Alamo Coal Company, and the Fuente Coal Company), with his Mexican International and its spur lines serving as transport for the mines, and his mines fueling the railroad. In the same years, Porfirian mining reform laws in 1884 and 1892 scrapped colonial-era doctrine and established mineral rights for landowners, which revived the entire industry and attracted more foreign capital. In 1905, after Huntington's death, the largest producer in the region had become William Ludlow's Mexican Coal & Coke Company, incorporated in New Jersey. That firm owned Las Esperanzas mines, the \\"most important mines in the Republic.\\" British industrialist William Broderick Cloete was also active in the region as an owner of land, rails, and coal mines. After Cloete died in the Sinking of the RMS Lusitania in May 1915, the mining town Cloete in Sabinas, Coahuila was named for him.  Workers  Mine operations in the first decades were characteristic of the \\"hand-loading era\\": labor-intensive, primitive, and unsafe. The numbers of local workers were inadequate, so foreign capital turned to foreign labor, and imported thousands of Japanese. Japanese immigrant laborers circa 1910, here at the copper mine of Cananea, Sonora Between 1901 and 1907, some 11,000 Japanese and Okinawan workers immigrated to Mexico, under contracts with immigration companies. (Mexico had been the first nation to diplomatically recognize Japan in 1888.) The Kunimoto Imin Gaisha sent 1,242 workers to Fuentes and Las Esperanzas, for example, and the Toyo Imin Gaisha sent hundreds more to Las Esperanzas, along with thousands more into unrelated industries. These workers normally had four-year contracts to work ten hours a day, six days a week. Conditions for workers were extremely poor. Many died from beriberi, typhoid fever or malaria, and there was a pattern of frequent industrial accidents (see below). In the deadliest coal mining disaster in Mexican history, the Mina Rosita Vieja disaster of February 27, 1908, most of the 200 fatalities were Japanese immigrant laborers. By 1906 immigrant workers on plantations had begun to strike and/or leave, often for California or Texas. Mexican Coal & Coke Company in 1907 complained that of 1,500 contract workers they'd paid passage for, 1,400 had fled. By November 1920 coal workers had organized under the Mexican Federation of Miners, and struck, successfully, for wage increases. Notably their secretary, J. M. Tristan, was denied entry into the U.S. by immigration officials in Laredo.  Accidents  Following is a list of coal mining accidents in Mexico.

From July 1, 2015, to August 31, 2017, Illinois was without a complete state budget for fiscal years 2016, 2017, and part of 2018. As a result, many state agencies had to cut services or continue borrowing to operate. The budget impasse has adversely affected Illinois' economy, its credit rating, and public confidence in Illinois' state government. Background According to the Constitution of Illinois, the Governor is required to submit a balanced budget proposal for the next fiscal year to the Illinois General Assembly. The General Assembly, in turn, must pass a balanced budget and send it to the Governor's desk to sign before the beginning of the new fiscal year on June 30th. Historically, Illinois governors have presented budget proposals in mid-February, allowing around four and a half months of negotiations before the deadline. Each fiscal year starts on July 1 and ends on June 30 of the following year. Each fiscal year is also named after the year in which it ends; for example, fiscal year 16 (FY16) started on July 1, 2015, and ended June 30, 2016. Although the recent Illinois budget impasse is not the first in the state's history, it is the longest. At the beginning of July 2007, disagreements between then-governor Rod Blagojevich and the General Assembly delayed the FY08 budget by six weeks. Under Governor Pat Quinn, Illinois went 16 days in FY10 without a budget. Fiscal year 2015 On January 12, 2015, Bruce Rauner was sworn in as the 42nd Governor of Illinois. During the 2014 Illinois gubernatorial election, Rauner ran against incumbent governor Pat Quinn on a platform of a series of reforms dubbed \\"The Turnaround Agenda.\\" The Turnaround Agenda included but was not limited to proposals such as unemployment insurance reform, tort reform, right-to-work reform, and collective bargaining reform. Upon his ascension to the governorship, Governor Rauner intended to act on the Turnaround Agenda. These reforms were largely supported by Illinois' Republican legislators, but largely opposed by Illinois' Democratic legislators, including Illinois Speaker of the House Michael Madigan. At the time, Illinois was still in FY15 with a budget that had been signed by then-governor Quinn the previous summer. That budget would not expire until June 30, 2015. Fiscal year 2016 From January 12, 2015, until February 18, 2015, the Illinois Governor's Office of Management and Budget, in conjunction with Illinois' state agencies, crafted a proposed FY16 budget which Governor Rauner introduced in a budget address on February 18, 2015. Both Governor Rauner and Speaker Madigan continued to disagree on how to implement a balanced budget. Governor Rauner insisted that the objectives listed in his Turnaround Agenda, rather than raising taxes, were essential for revitalizing Illinois' economy. Speaker Madigan, on the other hand, insisted that tax increases, rather than budget cuts, were essential. The General Assembly passed a series of budget bills to the Governor; however, on June 25, 2015, he vetoed most of them. One notable exception to the Governor's veto was a partial budget for the Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE), which manages Illinois' K-12 education. In August 2015 a supplemental education budget would be passed. However, on July 1, 2015, the fiscal year ended without a budget for all state agencies except for ISBE. As the new fiscal year began, not all spending stopped. State agencies often purchase goods and services from vendors on credit. The agencies are then reimbursed from the State according to appropriations in the budget and, in turn, are able to pay the vendors. However, on September 18, 2015, the Supreme Court of Illinois ordered that the State of Illinois must pay state workers and adhere to federal consent decrees which mandated the continuation of various health and social service programs. While this prevented a government shutdown, it also meant that state agencies were required to continue purchasing services with no way to pay the vendors. Throughout the remainder of summer and autumn of 2015, negotiations between the Governor and Speaker continued, with few results. As January 2016 approached, the Illinois Governor's Office of Management and Budget began preparing an FY17 proposal despite the fact that FY16 did not yet have a budget. Fiscal year 2017 On February 17, 2016, Governor Rauner presented his FY17 budget proposal. In response, in May 2016, the General Assembly attempted to pass its own budget for the Governor to sign, but it failed in the Senate. However, close to midnight on June 30, 2016, a stopgap budget was passed by the General Assembly and signed by the Governor. The stopgap budget provided limited appropriations to help agencies pay off their backlog of bills from FY16, and fully funded all state agencies in FY17 until January 1, 2017. Again, the Illinois State Board of Education was the sole exception, receiving a full-year FY17 budget. No meaningful revenue increases or legislative reforms occurred. Both Governor Rauner and Speaker Madigan admitted that the stopgap budget was not perfect, and neither solved nor ended the budget impasse. Although the first half of FY17 began with a budget, both Republicans and Democrats in the General Assembly were preoccupied with the 2016 elections. Donald Trump's unpopularity in Illinois provided Democratic candidates with the opportunity to tie Governor Rauner ‚Äì and by extension, the budget impasse ‚Äì to Trump. The Illinois Democratic Party performed strongly in the 2016 Illinois elections. Former City Clerk of Chicago Susana Mendoza defeated incumbent Comptroller Leslie Munger, while incumbent senator Mark Kirk lost in a landslide to congresswoman Tammy Duckworth, yet Republicans gained seats in both chambers of the General Assembly. The ruthless campaign atmosphere did not help ongoing negotiations between Governor Rauner and Speaker Madigan. Fiscal year 2018 In February 2017, Governor Rauner presented an FY18 budget proposal to the General Assembly. During his address, Governor Rauner mentioned ongoing negotiations for a \\"Grand Bargain\\" in the State Senate, although the details of this bargain were yet to be determined. In March 2017, negotiations came to a standstill as the General Assembly failed to vote on the series of bills that included appropriations, tax hikes and freezes, and school funding.http://wtax.com/news/101101-grand-bargain-dead-lawmakers-blame-rauner/ In late June, Governor Rauner announced he would order a special session of the General Assembly to convene until a budget had been passed. On June 30, 2017, House Amendment 2 to Senate Bill 6 passed in the House 90‚Äì25. The bill provides some appropriations for FY17. including the Illinois State Board of Education. However, the House adjourned in the early afternoon before voting on the bill. https://capitolfax.com/2017/06/30/house-passes-budget-proposal- will-remain-in-session-through-saturday/ On July 4, 2017, the House passed Senate Bill 6 and sent it to the Governor's desk; however, later that day Governor Rauner vetoed the legislation, claiming that the bill, along with the proposed tax increase, would not address Illinois' fiscal crisis. Later that same day, the Senate voted 39-15 to override the Governor's veto.http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=10000SB0006gms&GA;=100&SessionId;=91&DocTypeId;=SB&LegID;=98849&DocNum;=6&GAID;=14&Session;= On July 6, 2017, the Illinois House of Representatives voted 71‚Äì42 to override Governor Rauner's veto of an income tax increase and FY17 state budget, providing Illinois with its first full year budget since FY15. Although appropriations in the FY18 budget are ostensibly for FY18 costs only, the budget allows for some of its appropriations to also be used to pay for costs incurred in FY17. However, the veto override did not fully end the budget impasse, as there was still risk that the state's public school districts would not receive much of their funding for FY18. As of late August 2017, school districts had already missed two regular installments of state aid due to the impasse.https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-illinois- legislature-school-funding-met-0825-20170824-story.html A full appropriation for the Illinois State Board of Education depended on replacing Illinois' current school funding formula, called General State Aid, with a new formula called \\"Evidence-Based Funding.\\" $6.6 billion was appropriated in the Senate Bill 1 for Evidence-Based Funding, when technically that formula was not yet law; General State Aid legally remained the current school funding formula. The $6.6 billion could not be used until Evidence-Based Funding was enacted into law to replace General State Aid.http://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/long-awaited-budget-vote-wont-yet- solve-school-funding- problems/http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/100/PDF/100-0021.pdf On July 31st, Senate Bill 1, a bill which would formally replace General State Aid with Evidence-Based Funding, was sent to the Governor.http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/billstatus.asp?DocNum=1&GAID;=14&GA;=100&DocTypeID;=SB&LegID;=98844&SessionID;=106&SpecSess;=15 On August 1, Governor Rauner submitted an amendatory veto of Senate Bill 1 to the General Assembly. In his veto message, he articulated his disagreements with the bill's mechanisms holding districts harmless and appropriating money for the Chicago Teacher's Pension Fund (CTPF).http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=10000SB0001gms&GA;=100&SessionId;=91&DocTypeId;=SB&LegID;=98844&DocNum;=1&GAID;=14&Session;= However, on August 13, the Illinois Senate voted 38‚Äì19 to override the Governor's veto, but on August 28, the House failed to override the veto, voting 63‚Äì46 while requiring a 3/5 majority.http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/billstatus.asp?DocNum=1&GAID;=14&GA;=100&DocTypeID;=SB&LegID;=98844&SessionID;=106&SpecSess;=15 In late August, both Democratic and Republican leaders announced a tentative bipartisan education funding reform compromise bill, Senate Bill 1947. The bill contains much of the language of the defunct Senate Bill 1, including replacing General State Aid with Evidence-Based Funding. On August 28, in wake of the failed override of Senate Bill 1, the House passed Senate Bill 1947 73‚Äì34, with 3 voting present. An amendment passed later that day, 38‚Äì13 with 4 voting present, and the bill was sent to the Governor. On August 31, the bill was signed into law.DocNum=1947&GAID;=14&GA;=100&DocTypeID;=SB&LegID;=105288&SessionID;=106&SpecSess;=15 Credit rating of Illinois Throughout the impasse, Illinois' credit rating has been downgraded by several credit rating agencies. In 2014, Illinois' S&P; credit rating was A‚Äì, already the worst out of the 50 United States. In October 2016, S&P; downgraded Illinois' credit rating from BBB+ to BBB with a negative outlook. In June 2016, Moody's downgraded Illinois' bond ratings to Baa2 from Baa1, also with a negative outlook. These agencies each have cited the lack of a budget and a prolonged history of financial mismanagement as the causes of the downgrades. In June 2017, S&P; threatened to downgrade Illinois' credit rating to junk if an FY18 budget were not passed before the end of the fiscal year. Speaker Madigan wrote a letter to S&P; asking them to delay any judgment until after the weekend, promising that the General Assembly would convene on Saturday, July 1 to finish negotiations. Illinois' credit rating remains one notch above junk status (BBB-) according to S&P;, as of January 2020.

The sequel to Azure Striker Gunvolt, it was released in Japan in August 2016 and worldwide in September 2016. A physical release containing the game and its predecessor, titled Azure Striker Gunvolt: Striker Pack, was released alongside the digital release in Japan and North America. A Nintendo Switch version was released as part of a port of the Striker Pack on August 31, 2017. A PlayStation 4 version was released as part of a port of the Striker Pack on April 23, 2020. The game was later ported to PC on June 22, 2020. A sequel, Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 has been announced for Nintendo Switch and is in development.  Gameplay  The gameplay is directly based on the one in the original game. The main character, Gunvolt, controls nearly identically as in the previous game, using a gun to lock onto enemies and then using his electric field in order to attack them. The game, however, now adds the option to play as Copen, a character that played a major role in the previous game. He has an entirely different control scheme, now focusing on his dash attack. Copen can dash into an enemy and slam into it, which locks onto the enemy and allows Copen to shoot it with targeted attacks. He can also use powers from defeated bosses, similar to the Mega Man franchise.  Plot  Sometime after the ambitions of Sumeragi Group controlling the whole population of adepts with the failed \\"Project Muse\\" project and the death of their leader, Nova, the Sumeragi Group is in a massive power vacuum. As the story begins, three executives are aboard the Sumeragi airship, Seraph, arguing about the future of Sumeragi, when an alarm breaks out: an intruder has been cornered. The intruder is none other than Gunvolt, who has long left QUILL behind and works as a solo agent. He is accompanied by his girlfriend, Joule, who only exists in the form of Lumen, her own septimal projection known as \\"The Muse\\", as she was physically killed in events prior and bonded herself to Gunvolt's septima. The duo make short work of the guards on the Seraph, until they are made aware by Xiao, a young adept whom Gunvolt befriended and acts as his handler on missions, that the Seraph is on a crash course with a skyscraper in the middle of the city. Gunvolt races to stop the Seraph from crashing, forced to use his septimal powers as a magnetic cushion to pull the Seraph away from the building, with Joule amplifying her abilities to their limits. Meanwhile, Copen, a human scientist and warrior who harbors a massive hatred of adepts, arrives on the scene to investigate the events, as well as to search for his younger sister, Mytyl, who is hospitalized in the very building the Seraph was about to crash into. Gunvolt arrives with Mytyl, having rescued her from a mechanical guard, and delivers her to Copen, but Copen's attitude towards Gunvolt is still sour after their prior encounter. The two are suddenly ambushed, however, by Zonda, a bigender adept Copen thought he had killed months before, who reveals to them a new group of adepts called the Seven, members of a cult called Eden, all led by Zonda. Zonda has stolen Sumeragi technology with aims to create much more powerful versions of the Glaives, and reveals what they call their true form: a young, pink-haired girl. In this form, Zonda uses their septima to capture Joule in a mirror and shatter her to pieces, taking the shards to amplify the powers of the Seven's septimal forms, now housed in new containers known as Grimoires. Copen manages to snatch a shard from Zonda and gives chase, and Gunvolt finds one last piece of Joule has remained with him, albeit reverted to a much younger, childlike form and severely weakened in power. Gunvolt and Copen later meet with their operators and allies: Gunvolt returns to his new apartment to meet with Xiao and Quinn, a human girl who harbors strong feelings for Gunvolt, much to Joule's dismay; Copen returns to his lab to visit Mytyl and his lab assistant and maid, Nori, to discuss their plans to eradicate the Seven. The two follow slightly differing but parallel paths. =Gunvolt's Path= Gunvolt is given a new outfit by Quinn and Xiao, and the trio outline four members of the Seven to investigate and take out. The first, Gibril, is a young punk girl whose septima, \\"Metallon\\", allows her to create bladed weapons through metal, especially via hemoglobin in blood. The second, Milas, is an environmentalist who uses his \\"Ichor\\" septima to control and freely move through water to deliver deadly attacks. The third, Teseo, is an internet troll and black hat hacker who constantly harasses Gunvolt and Joule, and can use his \\"Hack the Planet\\" septima to digitize and destroy reality. The fourth, Tenjian, uses his \\"Permafrost\\" septima to attack with deadly ice blades and sub-zero temperatures. En route to Tenjian, Gunvolt runs into Copen and is forced into battle with him, but Copen breaks and retreats. After killing the first four members of the Seven, Gunvolt is sent to a highway in the city by Xiao, where he runs into Copen again, as well as a fifth member of the Seven: Ghauri, a street dancer and slam poet who uses his \\"Prism Cataclysm\\" septima to create deadly crystallized weaponry. Copen retreats again, leaving Gunvolt to deal with Ghauri. Gunvolt makes short work of Ghauri and returns to his apartment, where Xiao reveals that he's located Eden's fortress, the Garden, in a remote nation called Tashkent. The two head off to take out Eden once and for all, while Quinn stays to watch over the base. In the fortress, Gunvolt finds and eliminates the remaining Seven members. Deep within the fortress, he encounters Zonda, who battles him in their bigender form, but when Zonda shatters, Gunvolt deduces he was fighting an illusion. Continuing on, he finds Zonda in their young girl form, who has Mytyl captive and unconscious. Zonda explains that Joule and Mytyl are two halves of a whole; Joule was the adept part of Mytyl removed in an operation that left her mute and sickly, and cloned into her own body by Sumeragi. Using Mytyl as a proxy, Zonda rips Joule completely from Gunvolt's septima and uses her to power their own septima to unspeakable levels and transform into a deadly demonic form. Undeterred, Gunvolt manages to fight and kill Zonda for good, but at a cost: Mytyl has died thanks to Zonda, and Gunvolt curses himself for allowing an innocent girl to die. Copen arrives on the scene, and seeing Mytyl dead, swears to Gunvolt that he will kill every adept on the planet, starting with him. The two face each other in a Mexican standoff. =Copen's Path= Checking in with Mytyl, Copen's robotic partner, a sentient weapon pod he named Lola, suddenly projects a humanoid female form, much to Copen and Mytyl's shock. Copen deduces that the shards he was collecting from adepts is the cause, but is puzzled by its occurrence only around Mytyl. Copen and Nori outline four members of the Seven to investigate and take out. The first, Desna, is an amateur astrologer who attacks with living hair brought about by her \\"Splitting Ends\\" septima. The second, Asroc, is a former pastry chef who can control machinery with his \\"Puppetmaster\\" septima. The third, Ghauri, is a street dancer and slam poet who uses his \\"Prism Cataclysm\\" septima to create deadly crystallized weaponry. The fourth, Tenjian, uses his \\"Permafrost\\" septima to attack with deadly ice blades and sub-zero temperatures. En route to Tenjian, Copen runs into Gunvolt and is goads him into battle, but Gunvolt breaks and retreats. After killing the four members of the Seven, Mytyl is kidnapped by Eden. Copen is forced to chase down two of the members, Gibril and Teseo. He corners both of them in the sewers, where Teseo tells Copen that Mytyl was sent to their fortress, the Garden. Gibril sends Teseo off and confronts Copen, but Copen manages to kill her. He returns to base to determine the location of the Garden with Nori, and locates it in the remote nation of Tashkent. Traveling to the Garden, Copen destroys the remaining members of the Seven, and encounters Zonda once again in their bigender form; however, when Zonda shatters after battle, Copen realizes he was fighting an illusion. Continuing deeper into the fortress, Copen encounters Zonda once more in their little girl form, who has Mytyl captive and unconscious. Zonda explains that Mytyl is an adept, and that her adept half was removed and cloned as Joule; the trauma of the operation left Mytyl mute and sickly. Copen is shaken beyond belief at the notion that his sister is an adept, and Zonda uses Mytyl as a proxy to rip the power of the Muse away from Lola, transforming into a horrible demonic form. Copen manages to kill Zonda after a ferocious battle, but at a cost: Mytyl dies from the severe strain. Copen has a breakdown and swears bloody vengeance to all adepts, innocent or not. Gunvolt arrives on the scene, and the two are locked in a Mexican standoff. =Finale= When both paths are completed, the final act of the game sees Gunvolt and Copen locked in a standoff as before, but Copen instigates that every adept must die, no matter what. Gunvolt tries to sway him out of killing adepts, and the two engage in combat with one another until one of them is killed. At that moment, Mytyl revives, demanding that the two stay away from one another, and surrounded by the power of Lola and Lumen, she revives the fallen warrior, whose power is amplified to its utmost limits, and the two battle each other to absolute exhaustion. However, they decide not to kill one another, thanks to the words of a revived Mytyl, now reunited with the essence of Joule and having regained her voice once again, but losing her memories of the two. In Gunvolt's ending, he and Quinn are out together on a date, when he has a chance encounter with Mytyl, who stops, puzzled, and asks him if he's an angel, echoing Joule's first words to him. Gunvolt kindly tells her he's not, deciding it's for the best that she never remember him again. In Copen's ending, Copen decides that he can no longer be around his sister again, and asks Nori to tell his sister that he died in combat. Nori asks him what he will do, and Copen tells her that he needs to search for answers, but he cannot face his sister, now knowing that she's an adept. In a post-credits scene, Mytyl is shown to be happy at last, although she occasionally has dreams about Gunvolt, revealing that Joule's memories still live on in her. She hopes to thank Gunvolt personally one day for everything he's done for her.  Development  The game was teased in February 2015, when Inti Creates posted a tweet with the logo for the game. No further info was revealed until over a year later, when a Nintendo Direct on March 3, 2016, showed footage for the game. An official trailer was published the same day, revealing a vague release date of \\"Summer 2016\\". When Azure Striker Gunvolt Striker Pack was announced, the Japanese release date for both versions was set as August 25. Later, when it was announced that Inti Creates have partnered with Yacht Club Games in order to bring the physical release to North America, which will release on October 4. In an official Twitch stream by Inti Creates on August 20, it was also revealed that Europe would be getting the digital version on September 30 as well, but the release date for the physical version remains unknown. As a result of the collaboration with Yacht Club Games, players can unlock a special boss battle against the titular protagonist of Shovel Knight through use of the Shovel Knight amiibo. In December 2016, Japan released a DLC pack that contains score attacks, a song track and a speed run mode.  Reception  The game received positive reviews. Inti Creates announced that global eShop sales of Azure Striker Gunvolt 2 have reached 38,000 downloads as of May 1, 2017.

His work led to the discovery and description of the ventricular myocardial band. His work can be found in reference books on anatomy and cardiac surgery.  Biography  Torrent-Guasp started his cardiac research during medical school at the University of Salamanca, Spain. He was affectionately called \\"Paco\\" by those that knew him well. During his fourth year, working with prof. G√≥mez Oliveros, he began to focus on his lifelong interest in cardiac anatomy and physiology. This motivated him to write his first monograph El ciclo cardiaco (The cardiac cycle) After graduation, he started working as a family doctor in D√©nia, doing research during his free time, independent from the scientific community and separated from its orthodoxy, Paco understood the gap between academic and true clinical medicine better than most. Along with his research, he published monographs and presented his work in many conferences, often self-funding these activities. Starting in the 1970s and supported by the Juan March Foundation, he was able to hold dozens of invited lectures at universities worldwide. After the discovery of the ventricular myocardial band in 1972, he received the Miguel Servet (Michael Servetus) Prize in 1978 and was nominated for the Nobel Prize in medicine in the same year. Paco Torrent-Guasp died suddenly in 2005 after giving the closing lecture in a cardiology meeting in Madrid.  The ventricular myocardial band  Rubber model of the folded ventricular myocardial band. The atria are absent from the model. On the left, the ventricular chambers separated by the septum. Several anatomists had previously focused on the structure of the heart: Andreas Vesalius, Enrico Rueda, Jean-Baptiste de S√©nac, Thomas Bartholin, Jules Germain Cloquet and Robert Koch. It was well known that the mammalian and avian heart has four chambers (two atria and two ventricles) and that its muscle fibers are intertwined on several levels. Many have attempted to explain the mechanism of blood circulation, such as Galen, Ibn-Al Nafis, and William Harvey. Little attention was paid to the general anatomical architecture of the myocardium, the intricate layering of the muscle fibers within the myocardium and its effect on the blood circulation. The combined writings of Drs. Al-Nafis and Harvey, (400 years apart) yield the basis of the systemic and pulmonary circulation. Torrent-Guasp performed hundreds of anatomical dissections of animals hearts in his D√©nia laboratory. He also compared the structure of the heart in other vertebrates and annelids. From these dissections he discerned that the ventricles of the heart represent a continuous muscular band folded on itself as a helix during the embryonic development. By folding, the myocardial band crates a septum that separates two ventricular chambers of the heart close to the time of birth. Torrent-Guasp focused further on the relationship between anatomy and physiology, i.e. between the form, structure and function of the human myocardium. It is commonly believed that the motion of the heart (systole-diastole) is active-passive: the former is produced by the active contraction of the cardiac musculature contraction while the second by its relaxation. The ventricular myocardial band model supports the existence of an active muscular contraction that creates suction (creation of suction in diastole is extremely problematic with current theory) during ventricular diastole. Thus, it is the contraction of the ascending segment of the myocardial band that paradoxically increases the ventricular volume.  Practical applications of the ventricular myocardial band  The insights provided by the ventricular myocardial band model allows glimpses of possible advances in cardiac surgical procedures, notably those associated with the remodeling seen in hearts with systolic heart failure. This procedure aims to improve the shape of the ventricles in dilated hearts by removing part of the excess muscle tissue within the ventricular cavity (ventriculotomy). However, using Torrent-Guasp model, Drs. Suma and Burkberg replaced the ventriculotomy by placing a Dacron patch longitudinal to the muscle fibers, modeling the ventricular cavity with an abnormal spherical shape to a normal ellipsoidal shape, therefore improving the stroke volume. This procedure, called septal anterior ventricular exclusion, was named \\"pacopexia\\" in honor of Torrent- Guasp.  References   Scientific articles  * Torrent Guasp, Francisco.

This manga soon received its motion comic adaptation and provided with voice actors. SSSP SSSP, stands for (also shortened as ) is an attack team that had protected the Earth from monster threats and alien invasions from the past. Following Hayata's separation from Ultraman after his defeat from Zetton, SSSP disbanded and had its original base turned into museum made for remembering the SSSP and Ultraman's missions. In truth, the SSSP operated from shadows and had since protected Hayata and his entire family from being government test subjects after discovering his connection to Ultraman and the fact that he possessed what remains from Ultraman's power. The current SSSP is now led by Edo and several remaining members of the original SSSP. As several outlaw aliens emerge, SSSP finally revealed themselves to the society and created -empowered suits based on the original Ultraman, known as to counter these aliens. At one point, it was considered for cancellation until Shinjiro's development in his flying ability saved the project. ; :Voiced by: Ryohei Kimura (motion comic, anime), Megumi Han (child) (motion comic) (Japanese); Josh Hutcherson, Cassandra Lee Morris (child) (English) :The 17 year old protagonist of this manga. As the son of Shin Hayata, Shinjiro inherited his father's , which gives him superhuman strength and resilience, as shown when he was able to survive from a fall at the age of 5. He also tried to master these abilities by jumping from high buildings while keeping it as a secret to resume a normal life. However, once the emergence of an alien named Bemular threatened him and his father's life, Shinjiro was forced to be enlisted as a member of SSSP. At the request of Edo, Shinjiro was provided with a finalized model of the Ultraman Suit which he used to fight against outlaw aliens, as well as inheriting the title \\"Ultraman\\". In a mock battle staged by SSSP, with the hired Red fighting against Shinjiro, the boy soon developed an additional ability to maneuver anti-gravity flight, thus saving the Utraman Suit project from cancellation. :While in use of the suit, Shinjiro utilizes a similar fighting stance to the original hero and wields a pair of underneath his arms. These blades can be modified when Shinjiro utilizes the original Ultraman's , performed by having his forearms form a cross stance, with his left arm in a horizontal position and placed forward while his right arm is in a vertical position and placed backward. In contrast to the original, Shinjiro's variant had the beam released from his left Spacium Blade instead of the right arm. The small light on his chest is the (based on Ultraman's Color Timer) which can be removed to access Shinjiro's full power as a last resort tactic. Edo soon provides him with a mimicry system which allows him to become \\"Ultraman\\" via holographic disguise should the Ultraman Suit be incapable of being deployed. ; :Voiced by: Takayuki Sug≈ç (motion comic), Hideyuki Tanaka (anime) (Japanese); Fred Tatasciore (English) :The original \\"Ultraman\\" and Shinjiro's father. He has been given the title of Minister of Defense at the beginning of the story. Long ago in the past, he bonded with Ultraman but loses his memory after the giant left him. Following the \\"dissolution\\" of SSSP, Hayata has settled down and had a family, with a son named Shinjiro Hayata. When Shinjiro was a 5-year-old child, Hayata discovered his son's abnormality when the boy fell from a great height and finally regained his lost memories after Ide showed him the footage of Bemular attacking an airplane. Hayata also inherited the Ultraman Factor (which also passed to Shinjiro) and unknowingly had his entire family protected by his former teammates from being the government's test subjects. Due to this, Hayata enlisted into the reformed SSSP once more and had a hand in developing the Ultraman Suits. Hayata wore the prototype of the Ultraman Suit, called the Proto Suit and first used it to fight Bemular when he threatened Shinjiro's safety. But as the suit was in fact a prototype, Hayata was defeated by Bemular until Shinjiro returned with the finalized Ultraman Suit, using it to fend off against Bemular before he retreated. Hayata would later oversee his son and the entire SSSP's activities after finally passing the \\"Ultraman\\" title to Shinjiro but once again returned to action when the Ace Killer Squad strikes. He is initially reluctant to have Shinjiro employed into SSSP, wanting his son to experience a normal life. He also views the Ultraman Factor as nothing more than a \\"curse\\". :The original seems to be identical to that of the finalized version, though lacking a helmet and had its color scheme being black. Hayata fights using the Ultraman's fighting stance in his memory but is comparably weaker due to being lag behind from its finalized version. When Hayata returns to action, the suit was given a helmet based on the finalized version to hide his identity. During the final battle in New York, the suit is further modified with indentations on the chest and shoulder armor, making it Hayata the counterpart to Zoffy, the leader of the Ultra Brothers. ; :Voiced by: Masashi Ebara (motion comic), Ken Uo (anime) (Japanese); Brian Palermo (English) :A former member of the Japan Branch of the Science Special Search Party, and now chief of the .

Edo was approached by Ide to join the SSSP as he agreed, having lend a hand in developing the Ultraman Suits. As the presence of alien beings were supposed to be made secret, Edo bears a wristwatch that allows him to create holographic disguise of a human when walking out in the human world. Knowing that there are times when the Ultraman Suit cannot be deployed, he gave Shinjiro another mimicry system in his possession that allowed the boy to become \\"Ultraman\\" via holographic disguise. As humanity were initially unprepared for the arrival of aliens, Edo's residential area is in fact the Giant of Light Memorial. He often felt nostalgic whenever he watched the diorama display of Ultraman and Zetton, reminiscing his days as an invader. Being an Alien Zetton, Edo only needed to sleep for two minutes a day. :His appearance, such as wearing a business suit bears resemblance to the Alien Zetton infiltrator that appeared in episode 39 of Ultraman, along with the fact that his human form is also based on Dr. Iwamoto from said series, the same man that the Zettonian infiltrator used to disguise, though no connections between the two were revealed. ; :Voiced by: Tomokazu Seki (motion comic), Takuya Eguchi (anime) (Japanese); Liam O'Brien (English) :A stoic officer who had worked for a long time within SSSP.

He has a rather strained relationship with Shinjiro, doubted if the youth is fit enough to become an Ultraman. He also views Ultraman nothing more as an enforcer-like figure that instantly killed his opponents, which is not shared by the boy. Moroboshi later dons his own Ultraman Suit and revealed his alien heritage to Shinjiro when they pursue Seiji Hokuto. His name is in fact based on Dan Moroboshi from Ultra Seven. :Moroboshi's Ultraman Suit is called , which requires no Ultraman Factor and has a singular visor. His main weapon is the katana and several throwing knives. According to Moroboshi, because of the lack of Ultraman Factor, his fighting skills relies on weaponries, as well as his swordsmanship. The Spacium Sword is empowered by Spacium energies and is capable of slicing through harder materials such as Alien Bris' exoskeleton. Soon, the Ultraman Suit was upgraded into Ver.7.2, which gives him an additional Spacium, two machine guns that are stored in his shoulders and a pair of cannons. The entire suit and its throwing knives are based on Ultraseven and his Eye Slugger.

Sometime later, Red and Jack was hired by SSSP to create a commotion in the human world in hopes of witnessing any improvements in the Ultraman Suit. Prior to the attack, Jack had Red appeared in the human world through the use of wristwatch-type mimicry system that disguised him as a kindergarten child. While fighting Red, Shinjiro/\\"Ultraman\\" developed an ability to perform anti-gravity flight, allowing SSSP to maintain the Ultraman Suit project and gave Jack the signal to stop Red's assault. :Red's appearance is based on Red King from episode 8 of Ultraman.

Although having saved the day, this event left him traumatized, due to Adacic being his first kill, as well as Edo and Ide discovered that there are more perpetrators behind the death of civilians with strange barcodes.

Her debut album 'Dreams from the Factory Floor' was released in May 2015. She has received media attention from BBC Radio 1, The Guardian, and Kerrang who described her as \\"The most exciting voice in UK punk right now.\\" Her forthcoming second album is produced by Ross Petersen (Bruce Springsteen, Goo Goo Dolls) and Steve Whale of The Business.  Career  Louise Distras released her first single 'The Hand You Hold' on International Women's Day 2012 and was vocal in the campaign to release Pussy Riot. In 2015, she released her debut full-length album 'Dreams from the Factory Floor' via Pirates Press Records picking up media attention from The Guardian, The Independent, and BBC Radio 1. Produced by Steve Whale of The Business and featuring Mick Talbot of Style Council the album balances propulsive, old- school punk anthems and assertive, socially-aware folk-punk. Music journalist John Robb called her \\"the most important protest singer we have\\" in an article on the Louder Than War website. She auctioned the test pressings on eBay and donated the funds to California non-profit human rights organisation Justice Now and promoted their anti-violence and gender justice message on her summer USA tour. Justice Now co-ordinated an art project based around 'Dreams from the Factory Floor' lyrics, where people in the Central California Women's Facility (the world's biggest women's prison) illustrated copies of her songs 'The Hand You Hold' and 'Love Me The Way I Am'. The finished art pieces were displayed at various events throughout the year. In 2015, she toured across mainland Europe and supported the Buzzcocks,The Damned and Stiff Little Fingers on their UK tours. Later that year she performed alongside Mick Jones (The Clash) and Glen Matlock (Sex Pistols) at London's Coronet Theatre to raise funds for the London Fire Brigade in Joe Strummer's memory, and she also supported Television at Shepherds Bush Empire. In December 2015, Louise Distras appeared live on Channel 4 news to discuss the closing of Kellingley Colliery in Wakefield with poet Matt Abbott and Channel 4 News presenter and Europe editor Matt Frei. In 2016, Louise Distras released the hard hitting new single 'Aileen' as an appetite whetter for forthcoming new material. The track was inspired by 'America's first female serial killer', Aileen Wuornos, and blends 60s British Invasion girl-group sound with more contemporary, crunchy Power pop. 'Aileen' received radio support from Kerrang Radio, Huw Stephens (BBC Radio 1), John Kennedy (Radio X) and Rodney Bingenheimer (KROQ). It also featured on the Hugs for Chelsea online benefit album for whistleblower Chelsea Manning. The compilation premiered on Rolling Stone and also included tracks from Michael Stipe, Tom Morello, Thurston Moore and Against Me. Against the backdrop of the 2017 UK general election and #Grime4Corbyn campaign, Distras announced two Punk and Grime collaboration shows under the banner of Nu Punk. She said \\"The youth in the UK have been voiceless, ignored and forgotten about for too long. These shows are about more than bringing grime and punk together. These shows represent the new energy here in the UK that has seen a record number of young people registering to vote against division, hatred and austerity.\\" Kerrang named Louise Distras a 'Star of 2017' saying \\"Louise Distras is the most exciting voice in UK punk right now!\\" and she performed at Glastonbury Festival for a second time under the invitation of Billy Bragg. In 2018 Distras announced she was working on her sophomore album in Oakland California with producer Ross Petersen (Bruce Springsteen, Goo Goo Dolls) and Steve Whale of The Business. Distras returned in 2019 with the 'Street Revolution EP' saying \\"This collection of songs is a small taste of what to expect from the upcoming album, coming soon.\\" Upon its release, Street Revolution peaked at #10 on the iTunes singer-songwriter album chart and received more critical acclaim from Kerrang who said \\"Louise Distras has the kind of voice that could charm the paint from a car\\". The rallying title-track was immediately championed at Radio X being made John Kennedy's ‚ÄòX-posure Hot One‚Äô as well as airplay support from BBC Radio London where radio DJ Gary Crowley praised the track as \\"A song for our times. It leaps out of the radio\\".

The series, co-produced by Amazon Studios, BBC Worldwide's Lookout Point, Federation Entertainment and , premiered on 2 September 2016. The eight-part series was filmed in Wales, France and Pinewood Studios in the first half of 2016 and marked the first time a continental-European public national broadcaster has collaborated with a major subscription video on demand platform, a global distributor and a British production company, on an English-language drama. The creator of this fashion drama, Oliver Goldstick, was previously an executive producer of the fashion drama series Ugly Betty. Plot The series focuses on brothers Paul and Claude Sabine at their family's Paris fashion house. Around them, the city is emerging from the Occupation of World War II. The charming and outgoing Paul has the business savvy of the two brothers. Claude is the artistic talent, but also introverted, misanthropic and homosexual. Paul seeks to stake a claim in the top tiers of the Paris fashion scene as the city poises itself to reclaim the title of fashion capital of the world. He encounters obstacles in the forms of his past, his conniving mother's actions and the competitive environment of the industry. Paul's American wife, Helen, comes from a wealthy family whose money helped the Sabine fashion house survive during austere times. Throughout the first season, she and Paul face marital problems due to his many secrets. Claude, meanwhile, grapples with the emotional trauma of a vicious attack and robbery by a lover who then suddenly disappeared. He also longs for more recognition of his artistic contributions to the Sabine house, but his efforts are often thwarted by his dominating family and his own anti- social behavior. The series also follows Billy Novak, a young American photographer who is hired by the Sabine family. He is inspired by and falls in love with a seamstress-turned-model named Nina. She, however, is more concerned with finding the illegitimate son she was recently forced to give up for adoption. The series includes the lives and relationships of other employees in the fashion house. It also addresses the atmosphere of uneasiness and paranoia that arose in the Cold War era, as well as the hunt for former Nazi collaborators.

Speech pathologists call the condition de-rhotacism, or de-rhotacization, because the sounds lose their rhotic quality rather than becoming rhotic.  Language development  Rhotic sounds are usually the last ones a child masters. Some people never learn to produce them; they substitute other sounds, such as the velar approximant, the uvular approximant (often called the French R), and the uvular trill. In English, the most common occurrence of this type is a pronunciation perceived as closer to [w] (typically, though, actually the labiodental approximant ), which is known as r-labialisation. This form of rhotacism has often been used in English- language media for comedic effect, since it evokes among English speakers a childlike way of pronouncing the letter R, an example being Elmer Fudd's pronunciation of \\"rabbit\\" [Àà…πÃ† ∑√¶b…™Ãàt] as \\"wabbit\\" [Ààw√¶b…™Ãàt] in Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons. Often, people with the condition are mistakenly referred to as a person with a lisp, which is a different speech pattern.  Across languages  Rhotacism is more common among speakers of languages that have a trilled R, such as Afrikaans, Arabic, Armenian, Belarusian, Bulgarian, Czech, Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, Frisian, Hungarian, Icelandic, Indonesian, Italian, Macedonian, Malay, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, and Swedish (except in the provinces of Sk√•ne, Halland, Blekinge, √ñland and southern Sm√•land), Ukrainian, Welsh. In the Czech language there is a specific type of rhotacism called rotacismus bohemicus which is an inability to pronounce the specific sound /≈ô/ [rÃù] which is even more stressed than R sound. (For more info about this letter see voiced dental, alveolar and postalveolar trills.) Public personalities with rhotacism * Isaac Arthur * Sister Wendy Beckett * John Berger * Oliver Sacks * Jeremy Brett * Vojislav ≈†e≈°elj * Yaron Brook *Teresa Leger Fernandez, 2020 candidate for New Mexico's 3rd Congressional District * Kay Francis * Robert Gascoyne-Cecil * King George VI of the United Kingdom * Roy Hodgson * Roy Jenkins *Terry Jones, member of the Monty Python comedy troupe * Edward Ka-Spel *Vladimir Lenin, Russian revolutionary and Soviet leader * Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery, Senior British Army officer who fought in both the First World War and the Second World War. * The leader of Hezbollah, Lebanese Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, has been ridiculed for his rhotacism, particularly his \\"*Amwƒ´ka\\" and \\"*IswƒÅ'ƒ´l\\" for Arabic Amrƒ´ka (\\"America\\"), IsrƒÅ'ƒ´l (\\"Israel\\"). * Irina Odoyevtseva * Chris Packham, British naturalist and television presenter * Jonathan Ross, British television and radio presenter * Matt Bellamy, British musician * Chris \\"Mad Dog\\" Russo * Lucy Worsley  In popular culture  * Elmer Fudd in Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies. * Barry Kripke in The Big Bang Theory is depicted as having this speech impediment. However, he has problems with both \\"R\\" and \\"L\\" sounds. His Siri on his iPhone answers him back as \\"Bawwy\\". He is last seen in season 11 episode \\"The Bow Tie Asymmetry\\", at the end of the wedding, singing the song \\"At Last\\" as \\"At Wast\\". * In the 1979 film Monty Python's Life of Brian, Pilate (played by Michael Palin) is also depicted as having this speech impediment. Because of this, people around him often cannot understand his words, and he is mocked by the townspeople of Jerusalem when he talks to them in the square. * In the 1986 animated film An American Tail, the character Gussie Mouseheimer (voiced by Madeline Kahn) also replaces 'R' and 'L' with 'W', similar to Elmer Fudd, especially when saying the word 'rally', pronouncing it as 'wawwy'. * In the 1974 film Blazing Saddles, Madeline Kahn again played a character with a speech impediment, this time the singer Lili von Sht√ºpp, the \\"Teutonic Titwillow\\". * In the 1987 film The Princess Bride, the character known as the Impressive Clergyman (played by Peter Cook), also has problems with multiple sounds, including \\"R\\" and \\"L\\", pronouncing \\"marriage\\" as \\"mawwage\\". * Tony Angelino, a one-time character from Only Fools and Horses, suffered from rhotacism, becoming apparent during his stage performance of the Roy Orbison song \\"Crying\\". *Homestar Runner from Homestar Runner. *Baby Bear in Sesame Street also has this trait. * Ming-Ming in Wonder Pets! * Jimmy Five from Monica's Gang replaces 'R' with 'W' in the English version, except for the 'R' in words like 'car' or 'hair'. In the original Portuguese version, he replaces 'R' with 'L'. * Napoleon Brie in the original Biker Mice from Mars. * Greta from the Spyro series speaks this way in all of her appearances.

Early life and pre-political career Aoki was born in the town of Taisha (now a part of Izumo city) in Shimane Prefecture on 25 March 1961. His father Mikio Aoki is a veteran politician within the prefecture, having served five terms in the from 1967 to 1986 before representing the prefecture in the House of Councillors in the national Diet for four consecutive terms from 1986 as a member for the Shimane at-large district. Aoki attended in Shimane and graduated from Waseda University with a bachelor's degree in education in 1985. After graduating he joined the Fuji Television before moving to the San- in Ch≈´≈ç Television Broadcasting company in Shimane a year later. Political career In 2000 Aoki left San-in Ch≈´≈ç to become a secretary to his father, who was serving in the role of Chief Cabinet Secretary in the Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) government at the time. When Mikio was replaced as Chief Cabinet Secretary the following year, Kazuhiko remained as his father's official secretary. =First term as Councillor (2010-2016)= In January 2010 Mikio Aoki, who was 76 years of age, expressed his intention to seek a fifth six-year term in the House of Councillors at the election to be held in the middle of the year. He received official LDP backing from party leader Sadakazu Tanigaki, despite some people within the party wanting for him to step aside in favour of a younger candidate. However, Mikio suffered a stroke on 13 May 2010 while campaigning in Unnan city and informed LDP officials in Shimane the following day that he would have to abandon his campaign. At this time Kazuhiko's name was immediately raised as a replacement, and he later received the official nomination to contest the Shimane district at the July 2010 election. In the election he received 52.9% of the vote in a four- candidate contest. During his first term as a Councillor, Aoki has served on the House's Land and Transport Committee, Administration Oversight Committee and the Special Committee on Regional Issues and Consumer Affairs. In October 2012 he became a deputy chairman of the LDP's house committee on Diet policy. In February 2013 he became a director of the House's Budget Committee. In September 2014 Aoki was appointed by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as a parliamentary vice-secretary for Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism alongside Kenichiro Ueno and Takashi ≈åtsuka. He retained the role in Abe's next cabinet that was formed after the December 2014 House of Representatives election, but was replaced during a shuffle in October 2015. In July 2015 Aoki was one of six LDP Councillors from rural districts who were opposed to the party's policy of merging smaller districts to address the problem of vote malapportionment. Aoki and the other Councillors exited the House before a vote on a bill that merged Aoki's Shimane district with the neighbouring Tottori at-large district, the two smallest districts in the country, amongst other changes to district representation. =2016 re-election campaign= Following the 2015 electoral reform intended to address disproportion in voter representation, Aoki's Shimane district was merged with the neighbouring Tottori at-large district to create the Tottori-Shimane at-large district. Tottori was represented by Kazuyuki Hamada, who was elected in 2010 as an LDP candidate but defected to an opposing party a year later. As the only incumbent LDP member in the new district, Aoki received the party's nomination to contest the newly merged district at the July 2016 election and an endorsement from Komeito, the LDP's junior coalition partner. In the election Aoki received 62.7% of the vote to defeat Hirohiko Fukushima, a nominally independent candidate who was jointly endorsed by the main opposition parties.

Renard (Sasha Roiz) is visited by a woman named Mia (Alice Evans) from Tokyo to discuss something she would \\"make up\\". Nick (David Giuntoli) is called by Monroe to discuss Angelina. She explains that someone hired her to kill Monroe for $25,000 and if she does not, they will kill her. Rosalee leaves Portland for a time and asks Monroe to run the shop. He accepts but does not tell her about his assassination attempt. With help from Hank (Russell Hornsby), they begin to plan a ruse to make it look like Monroe is actually dead.

Angelina takes him to the location where Arbok and his enforcers think Monroe is really dead and the person who hired her is revealed to be Mia. Monroe wakes up and Nick and Hank get to the location. Angelina fights the enforcers but is shot in the chest and dies in Monroe's arms. Nick chases Arbok but is attacked by him and Hank is forced to kill Arbok while Mia escapes.

'Over My Dead Body' falls on the positive side of the list for me, but not completely, since among many elements that worked ‚Äî Hank slipping into a bit of a less-quippy Xander role as he questions Monroe, sparing use of Juliette and Renard, and a surprisingly resonant death and final scene ‚Äî there are still some logistical issues that gum up the works and prevent it from progressing to something more than just above-average for Grimm.\\" Emily Rome of EW wrote, \\"It's date night in Portland. And even for the Portlanders whose nights were filled with more zitherists and wine than creepy would-be rapists, the course of love never does run smooth. Not smooth at all.

Coming along for the solely serial ride is Angelina, who you may remember from 'The Three Bad Wolves,' and she's just as charming as ever. Sadly, even for all of Angelina's charm, over the course of the hour it became apparent her story arc would be coming to a close rather than staying open-ended again.\\" Shilo Adams from TV Overmind, wrote: \\"Much of the latter part of the first season (and beginning of the second season) of Grimm has focused on the impact that Nick has had on the Wesen world as a whole. His emergence as a powerful, efficient Grimm with connections has sent shockwaves through the Wesen population, making him a major target of both the Wesen and the royal families. It's one thing to have a Grimm around, but to have one that has gotten this good this quickly with a partner from the Wesen world could have major implications that reverberate for years to come.\\" Josie Campbell from TV.com wrote, \\"I've said it once and I'll say it again: It's hard out there for a Grimm!

It was established in 1890 as one of the first cooperative creameries in Minnesota. The Clarks Grove Cooperative Creamery used new technology and a well-organized cooperative system. It became a model for the Minnesota dairy industry. Ten years later, there were more than 550 cooperative creameries in the state. The original building burned down and was replaced with a new facility in 1927 which included a second-floor meeting hall. Still standing, this building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986 for having local significance in the themes of agriculture, architecture, commerce, and social history. It was nominated for its seminal status and influence on the state's cooperative creameries, as well as its association with the small local community of Danish Americans and their outsized success in dairy farming, its role as a social center, and being Minnesota's best example of its type architecturally. Background In the 1870s and 1880s, farmers in southern Minnesota were turning their wheat fields into dairy farms. Yet making butter on the farm was difficult. It required a lot of labor, mostly done by women. And many people did not like farm butter, because it took on the flavors of other food from the farmer's kitchen. After an 1884 visit to Denmark, farmer Hans Peter Jensen came back to Minnesota with the idea for a cooperative creamery. In Denmark, Jensen learned about innovations in butter-making that could transform the dairy industry in Minnesota. But these new technologies would be difficult for individual farmers to access. Minnesota farmers typically owned only a dozen cows and small dairy farms were not very profitable. Cooperatives, or \\"coops,\\" helped by pooling farmers' resources. Farmers brought their milk to the coop. At the coop, butter was made in large batches using the new technology of cream separation. Cooperative farmers benefited from the efficiency of the factory, and they shared the profits and losses with each other rather than investors. Impact The Clarks Grove Cooperative Creamery became a model for the rest of the state. It was made famous by Theophilus Levi (T.L.) Haecker. Haecker was a dairy science professor at the University of Minnesota, and he was known as the \\"Father of Minnesota Dairying.\\" In 1892, Haecker traveled around the state to inspect creameries. He was disappointed by the poor conditions that he found. But when Haecker found the Clarks Grove creamery, he was impressed. He spoke across the state and told farmers about the creamery's principles. In 1894, he published a popular bulletin that showed farmers how to found a cooperative creamery. The bulletin was based on the constitution and bylaws of the coop in Clarks Grove. With Clarks Grove as a model, cooperative dairying in Minnesota grew. By 1898, more than 550 cooperative creameries existed in Minnesota. The state became known for its butter and for its cooperative agriculture system. In 1928, nearly half of the cooperative creameries in the United States were in Minnesota. These included important cooperative associations like the Minnesota Co-Operative Dairies Association (founded in 1911) and Land O'Lakes, Incorporated (founded in 1921). The Clarks Grove creamery was also important for the local area. It was the first building and the first business in the Clarks Grove community. In the early 20th century the cooperative expanded, adding a cooperative grain elevator, a general store, and a lumber yard. For decades the creamery was a community center. It hosted talks, meetings, and school recitals. In 1956 it became a temporary school after the local schoolhouse burned down. Closure In 1996 the Clarks Grove Cooperative Creamery closed. As dairy farmers retired there was no longer a need for the coop.

It was produced by Black Fawn Films and Breakthrough Entertainment. The plot is about a young woman who is bitten by a waterborne insect while in Costa Rica and suffers horrifying consequences. Plot Casey (played by Elma Begovic) celebrates her bachelorrette party with her friends Kirsten and Jill in Costa Rica; Casey gets bitten by an insect at one point during the trip. She is however too preoccupied with her issues at home to take note. An over-bearing mother-in-law, and cold feet over Casey's impending wedding between her and Jared are at the top of her list of concerns, as Casey was beginning to doubt the upcoming wedding. In addition, she notes strong changes to herself; as her body mutates gradually, her senses get worse while she is no longer able to feed herself and is plagued by nightmares. When she wakes up one day, there are insect eggs in her apartment. Jared's mother invades Casey's apartment to angrily challenge her of marrying her son, but Casey kills her by spitting acid. Her friend Kirsten is very worried and visits Casey, but she also kills her when Kirsten finds the body of Mrs. Kennedy and panics. Casey's girlfriend Jill is actually in love with Jared. In order to prevent the wedding, she stole Casey's engagement ring on Costa Rica and let Casey believe that she had a one-night stand. In fact, Casey was forced into sex while drunk against her will. This was filmed by Jill, who shows Jared only pictures of how Casey is kissed by the man. Jill seduces Jared into sex in her car but is heard by Casey because of her tighter senses. Discovering that Jared had seemingly cheated on her, Casey releases a loud, superhuman cry that causes nausea and vomiting in Jill and Jared. Jill enters Casey's apartment and is overwhelmed; she is stunned and tied to a chair. When she wakes up again, Casey, meanwhile heavily mutated, forces her to watch the videos of her rape. She also forces Jill to call for Jared, who then enters the apartment. Casey kills Jill, causing a fight between Jared and her. Although Jared can kill Casey, he is seriously injured by a sting. He drags himself back to his apartment and tries to dial the emergency call with his mobile, but fails. A week later, the entire house is quarantined. The police raid the house and find the bodies of Mrs. Kennedy, Jill and Kirsten in Casey's apartment. In Jared's apartment, they find the seriously injured and already mutated Jared in a kind of cocoon. When they want to help him, many eggs and insects swell from his body; these attack the police. At the end of the film, two joggers are talking about an upcoming trip to Costa Rica, before one of the two is bitten by an insect.

Metacritic reports an aggregated score of 57 based on 4 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". The beginning of the film and character development in particular were criticized, with the relationships and acting being described as unconvincing and generic to the point of being parodic, while the complex themes and body-horror elements were generally viewed more favorably by critics, Brian Tallerico from RogerEbert.com called it \\"one of those early career horror entries in which the filmmakers don't quite nail the set-up or the landing, but the gooey center of the film works for those with a high tolerance for things that might make a majority of the population queasy.\\" Phil Wheat from Nerdly had a slightly more positive takeaway after seeing the Frightfest 2015 screening: \\"Bite is strange and claustrophobic tale of sexuality, horror and bodily fluids recalls the best of David Cronenberg (Rabid, Shivers, The Fly), even echoing of Roman Polanski's Repulsion in the isolated madness of Casey's condition.

History Lunalilo died from tuberculosis on February 3, 1874, after a short reign of a year. On his deathbed, Lunalilo had requested a burial at Kawaiaha ªo Church on the church's ground instead of Royal Mausoleum at Mauna  ªAla in Nu ªuanu Valley, the burial site of most modern Hawaiian monarchs. Historians have speculated that the democratically elected king wanted to be buried in the cemetery to be closer to the common people. Another reasoning for his refusal to be buried alongside his predecessors was rooted in a feud between Lunalilo and the Kamehameha family over his mother KekƒÅuluohi's exclusion from the list of royalty to be buried there in the 1860s. KekƒÅuluohi's remains were buried at sea by Lunalilo. After his state funeral in 1874, Lunalilo's remains were temporarily interred at the Royal Mausoleum at Mauna  ªAla, awaiting the completion of the Lunalilo Mausoleum. The tomb was built under the instructions of his father Charles Kana ªina, who survived him. Robert Lishman, an Englishman from Australia, designed and supervised the construction. On November 23, 1875, his remains were taken from the Royal Mausoleum to the almost completed tomb on the grounds of Kawaiaha ªo Church. His father requested a second funeral and a 21-gun salute from King KalƒÅkaua like during the first royal funeral. KalƒÅkaua granted the second funeral but refused to allow the 21-gun salute. During this procession, eyewitness reports stated that a sudden storm arose, and that twenty-one rapid thunderclaps echoed across Honolulu which came to be known as the \\"21-gun salute.\\" The Mausoleum in the 19th-century The tomb was completed in 1876. His father Charles Kana ªina was buried in the vault after his death in 1877. A maternal cousin of Lunalilo Miriam Auhea KekƒÅuluohi Crowningburg served as kahu (caretaker) for the mausoleum until her death in 1899. In acknowledgement of her chiefly status, she was buried in the lot outside the vault of Lunalilo's Mausoleum. Her grandson William Bishop Taylor, who served as kahu for the Royal Mausoleum at Mauna  ªAla, would also later be buried within the same lot. The interior of the Mausoleum contains the two koa wood caskets of Lunalilo and his father on red-carpeted floors. Three kƒÅhili encased in Italian marble are set near the caskets. In 1917, Albert Gergbode and Paul Payne, two American naval sailors, broke into the tomb in search of burial goods and stole a silver crown and a silver plate inscribed with the biography of Lunalilo. The culprits melted down the silver objects and tried to pawn it in Key West, Florida, where they were arrested for the crime. =Interments= Interior of Lunalilo Mausoleum with Lunalilo's casket center and Kana ªina's casket to the right *Lunalilo (1835‚Äì1874), sixth monarch of the Kingdom of Hawaii *Charles Kana ªina (1801‚Äì1877), father of Lunalilo *Miriam Auhea KekƒÅuluohi Crowningburg (1839‚Äì1899), cousin of Lunalio, buried outside the tomb *William Edward Bishop Kaihe ªekai Taylor (1882‚Äì1956), grandson of Crowningburg, buried outside the tomb See also *Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii **List of burials in the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii References Bibliography  Buildings and structures in Honolulu Burial sites of Hawaiian royal houses Cemeteries in Hawaii Landmarks in Hawaii Mausoleums in the United States Protected areas of Oahu Royalty of the Hawaiian Kingdom Buildings and structures completed in 1876 1876 establishments in Hawaii House of Kalaimamahu ","title":"Lunalilo Mausoleum"},{"id":"51117637","text":"Portrait by Fr√©d√©ric Boissonnas from the Biblioth√®que de Gen√®ve collection Edouard Sarasin (20 May 1843 ‚Äì 22 July 1917) was an independent scientist in Geneva.

The Dead Room was inspired by the 1970s urban legend of a haunted farmhouse in Central Otago, New Zealand.http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/film/72700342/central-otago- haunted-house-legend-captured-on-film/ It stars Jed Brophy, Jeffrey Thomas, and Laura Petersen as ghost hunters who are hired to determine if a house is haunted. It premiered at Sitges Film Festival in October 2015 and was released later that month in New Zealand. Plot After a ghost scares a family out of their house, an insurance company hires three ghost hunters to determine if it is haunted. They include Liam, who handles their technological tools, skeptic Scott, and psychic Holly. At first, Holly senses nothing in the house, and Scott's tools measure no electromagnetic disturbances. After Liam sets up several cameras with sensors, they go to sleep. At 3am, the cameras pick up movement, which Scott later dismisses as a draft. As Liam and Scott discuss their previous cases, Scott describes his theory that low frequency sound can disperse a ghost, and Liam shows Holly footage of a chair rocking by itself. Scott admits that he can not explain the footage and says he wants to find a scientific explanation for the paranormal. A loud noise wakes the ghost hunters at 3am the next night, and Holly says she sees a ghostly figure, which neither of the men can see. In the morning, Scott tells them nobody will accept their evidence, as it is too subjective. Although frustrated, Liam and Holly eventually agree, and the three go through each room, trying to make contact. Before going to sleep, they set alarms to wake just before 3am. That night, Holly sees the ghostly figure again, and it reacts aggressively, threatening her. Scott calms the others by telling them that there is no evidence a ghost has ever harmed a living person; all it can do is scare them. Holly, more shaken than the others, reveals she took the job to conquer her fear of ghosts. During the day, Holly senses a presence and strong temperature change, which the others do not feel. Scott's EMF meter reads nothing, but he soon realizes he forgot to insert a battery. When he does so, it immediately begins reading a large disturbance. The reading suddenly goes dead at the end of the main hallway, and Holly agrees that there is no presence in the kitchen. This is reinforced when the ghost later chases them, and they take refuge in the kitchen. Worried that the attacks could turn dangerous, Liam and Holly argue they should leave the house. Scott, however, insists they stay to capture evidence of the paranormal. When they subsequently film a telekinetic attack by flying furniture, Scott again insists they stay, this time to test his theory. Liam, who owns their transportation, reluctantly agrees, overriding Holly's objections. During the ghost's next appearance, Liam restarts the house's generator while Scott sets up his equipment. After the machine reaches its lowest frequency, the attack suddenly ends, and Holly admits that the ghost is gone. As the relieved ghost hunters pack up their equipment, Liam notices a strangely-cold corner in the kitchen. Upon further investigation, a hidden passage leads to another room. There, they discover the mummified remains of a woman. Overwhelmed by a paranormal presence, Holly is forced to leave the room, and the others call the police, who, after looking, say there is no body in the room. As the ghost hunters attempt to convince the police officers of their story, Holly is suddenly possessed and reveals that the first ghost was trying to frighten them off and protect them from the second, the woman. The second ghost quickly kills the police officers, then Scott. Liam saves Holly, only to be killed himself. As Holly flees the house, the ghost kills her. In the final scene the killer ghost finally shows itself and the credits roll.

Launched in October 1939, it was operated by the Denholm Line. In June 1940 as part of Operation Ariel it brought 33 French scientists including Lew Kowarski and Hans Halban, and their families to Britain before the Fall of France. They brought with them 26 cans containing of heavy water, machine tools, and $10 million in diamonds. The ship was torpedoed on 21 September 1940, but made port under its own steam. Building SS Broompark was built by Lithgows Limited in Port Glasgow, Scotland, for J. & J. Denholm Limited. It was launched in October 1939, and operated by the Denholm Line. A cargo ship of 5,136 gross register tons, it was long overall and abeam, with a depth of . Her draught was She was propelled by a three-cylinder triple expansion engine, with a single drive shaft and screw. Broompark was allocated the Code Letters GCBC and the United Kingdom Official Number 168288. Her port of registry was Greenock, Renfrewshire. The ship's master was Captain Olaf Paulsen. Born in Christiania, Norway, in 1878, he had left when he was 14 and made his home in Leith, Scotland, becoming a British citizen in 1904. After starting out with Christian Salvesen as a cook, he had earned his master's certificate, and joined the Denholm line. He had commanded SS Briarpark in the 1920s, but had been forced to retire in 1938 after running his ship aground. Soon after the Second World War broke out, Paulsen found himself in charge of the line's newest ship, and the most valuable cargo it had ever carried. Bordeaux On 13 June 1940, Broompark entered Bordeaux harbour with a load of coal. She had sailed as part of convoy OG-33F in company with SS Earlspark, another vessel of the Denholm line also carrying coal, but Earlspark had been sunk en route by a German U-boat, on 12 June. Paris had fallen the previous day, and Paulsen agreed that once his cargo was discharged, he would take on refugees and carry them to England. About a hundred people took up his offer. Amongst those who boarded was the Earl of Suffolk, who had been the British Scientific Liaison Officer from the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research to the French government. With Major Ardale Golding and their secretaries, Eileen Beryl Morden and Marguerite Nicolle, they had left Paris on 10 June. They had escorted thirty-three eminent scientists and technicians, including Lew Kowarski and Hans Halban, along with their families, from Clermont Ferrand to Bordeaux, and arranged for their passage to England on Broompark. The scientists brought with them 26 cans containing of heavy water worth ¬£22,000. Originally from Norway, it was a vital ingredient in nuclear energy research that would find use in the British Tube Alloys project. The managing director of the Antwerp Diamond Bank, Paul Timbal, joined them, bringing with him between ¬£1 million and ¬£3 million in diamonds. They also discovered of machine tools in wagons on the quay, which were loaded on board. The diamonds and the heavy water were strapped to the deck on wooden pallets, so that if the ship was sunk they might float free, and possibly be recovered. On 19 June, Broompark weighed anchor and sailed down the Gironde estuary without the assistance of a pilot or tugboats, and made its way safely to Falmouth, arriving on 21 June. U-boat attack On 21 September 1940, Broompark was travelling from Vancouver to Glasgow in convoy HX-72, laden with of lumber and metal. At 23:38 it was torpedoed by a German U-boat, . One crewman was killed. Paulsen was in his bunk at the time. When he reached the bridge, he found that 40 of his 48 crewmen had abandoned ship. With his chief engineer and the seven other crewmen on board, he had ballast pumped into the leeward bilge to lift the ship onto an even keel, and Broompark continued the voyage under its own steam. It was bombed and strafed by a Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor off the coast of Scotland, but the Condor was driven off by anti-aircraft fire from Broompark and its escort. Broompark made port, and was repaired and restored to service. For his gallantry, Paulsen was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in January 1941. He was also awarded the Lloyd's War Medal for Bravery at Sea. Sinking On 25 July 1942, Broompark, now under the command of Captain John Leask Sinclair was en route to New York with convoy ON-113. The ship was carrying ballast only. At 03:52, the convoy came under attack from under the command of Fregattenkapit√§n Erich Topp, which torpedoed the tanker British Merit. At 04:49, it torpedoed Broompark. Four members of the crew were killed, including Sinclair. The remaining 45, including the seven- man naval gun party, were picked up by the corvette and taken to St. John's. The ship was taken in tow by the fleet tug , but sank at 06:00 on 28 July 1942.

On his return to the United States in 1935 at age 12 he studied at Maryknoll School, and then O'Dea High School, in Seattle. Self-portrait (injured in a foxhole), 1953, John Matsudaira. Collection of the Matsudaira family. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and American entry into the Second World War in 1941, Matsudaira, along with his family, was forcibly relocated to Camp Minidoka in Idaho. He later volunteered to serve in the U.S. Army's all-Nisei 442nd Infantry Regiment. After training at Camp Shelby in Mississippi, he was severely wounded in combat in Italy in 1944, and spent two and a half years in recovery. It was an experience he rarely spoke of later, only telling a friend, \\"It's hard to explain to anyone who wasn't there.\\" Career On his return to Seattle in 1947, Matsudaira made use of the G.I. Bill to enroll in the Burnley Art School, where he studied with noted artists Jacob Elshin and Nick Damascus. At this time he was working in a Social Realist style, often painting urban or waterfront scenes, in oil and watercolor. He entered pieces in the Seattle Art Museum's Northwest Annual juried exhibition several years in a row, gaining considerable notice. He became friends with prominent artists such as Paul Horiuchi, Kenjiro Nomura, George Tsutakawa, and Mark Tobey; the influence of Horiuchi and Tobey, in particular, can be seen in some of his early work. Around 1950 Matsudaira began his career of over thirty years as a draftsman at the Boeing aircraft company. He had started out painting in the cramped kitchen of the apartment he and his wife Lillian shared in Seattle's First Hill neighborhood, but as the first of their four children came along, they were able to buy a more spacious home in the Rainier Beach neighborhood. Quiet Motion and Blue, 1961, John Matsudaira. Collection of the Matsudaira family. Despite his commitments to work and family, Matsudaira was a dedicated artist, continually experimenting with new techniques, materials, and means of expression. A 1953 oil painting, Self-portrait (Injured in a foxhole), is figurative yet highly symbolic, representing the foxhole in which he was nearly killed as a place of both death and rebirth. His art evolved toward abstraction, with works such as Adoration (1955) and Quiet Motion and Blue (1961) having a sombre, introspective quality. Matsudaira's work was shown at the 1962 World's Fair in Seattle, the International Art Exhibition in Chinatown, the Seattle Art Museum, the Zoe Dusanne Gallery, and many other institutions around the Northwest. Later years For a time Matsudaira was a major figure in the Pacific Northwest's Asian-American art community, even sharing an exhibition with Horiuchi, Tsutakawa, and Nomura at the Dusanne Gallery in 1954; by the late 1970s, however, his output - never prolific - slowed to a trickle, and his art was largely forgotten. Matsudaira died in Seattle on January 30, 2007; his memorial service was held at St. Paul's Catholic Church. Legacy In the 2010s, due to the efforts of family members, a handful of curators and journalists, and a general upsurge of interest in mid-century modern art in the Pacific Northwest, Matsudaira's work has been reintroduced to the public, with new appreciation for the scope and depth of his artistic career. In May 2016 the first-ever retrospective of Matsudaira's life and work, curated by David F. Martin, opened at the Cascadia Art Museum in Edmonds, Washington.

He was last seen by anyone who knew him later that morning, when his son said goodbye to him while Robert was mowing the lawn of the family home, a conversation also witnessed by a neighbor. He failed to show up for work the next morning or pick up his wife when she returned home from an overseas trip that afternoon. He was reported missing and his whereabouts are still unknown. Police investigated several sightings of Hoagland over the next year, mostly nearby. Tips also placed him in Southern California and South Carolina; neither they nor the alleged sightings yielded any trace of him. Theories about his disappearance range from foul play possibly connected to his son's drug problems to an attempt to start a new life. The case has been featured on an episode of the Investigation Discovery channel series Disappeared. Background Hoagland and his wife Lori, a culinary arts teacher at Newtown High School, lived on Glen Road in the town's Sandy Hook section, where they had raised their three sons to young adulthood. The couple had at one point separated for two years, but later reconciled. Lori Hoagland says they had begun planning their retirements. Robert and Lori's 24-year-old son, Max Hoagland, had a history of problems with drug addiction. Earlier in 2013 he had been in rehabilitation. Robert left his restaurant job for a position in a friend's law firm to better help his son with his recovery; he also worked as a real estate appraiser. Robert and Lori had talked about going on a hiking trip with Max on the Appalachian Trail that summer as part of that effort. In July, Lori went on a two-week trip to Turkey with some friends; she and Robert regularly exchanged email while she was away. In the week before her return, two of the family's laptop computers were stolen. Robert came to believe that Max had taken them to either sell or exchange in order to obtain drugs, and sent an email to Lori apologizing for having let it happen. Investigators later learned that he had traveled to an abandoned industrial building in Bridgeport to confront some men they described as Max's \\"associates\\" over the theft, which Max had said they were responsible for. On July 25, $600 was withdrawn from one of the family's bank accounts. Disappearance Robert and Lori spoke briefly by phone on the evening of July 27, confirming his plan to pick her up upon her return from Turkey at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City two days later. Early the next morning, he went out in his wife's Volkswagen Golf to buy bagels for breakfast at a local bakery, then stopped at a Mobil station on Church Hill Road (U.S. Route 6 and Connecticut Route 34) near Interstate 84 to get gas. Security cameras inside recorded him paying for the fuel and also buying a map of the eastern United States at 6:45 a.m. It was the last documented evidence of his presence anywhere. Upon Robert's return home, he and Max had breakfast. After the meal, Max said later, his father paid some bills and played Scrabble online for a while. Around 10 or 11 a.m., his father went out to mow the lawn. While he was doing so, Max went out in the Golf, telling his father he expected to be back a few hours later. A neighbor also told police he saw the two talking on the lawn. The next day, Robert was not at the airport when Lori arrived around 4 p.m. She tried calling both their home and his cell phone, but got no answer at either. She assumed that he was in traffic on his way there and his phone's battery was dead. \\"This happens with him frequently,\\" she later said. She did not initially return to Newtown, instead going to a relative's home nearby. She learned from another phone call, to Robert's boss's wife, that he had not shown up for work that morning. When she did make it home on July 30, she found her husband's phone, keys, passport and prescription high blood pressure medications in the house, but not him. The mower he had been using had been returned to its usual storage location, and the loafers he had been wearing when he went on his morning shopping trip, his preferred summertime footwear, were also in the house, as was his other pair. Robert's dirty clothes were in the laundry. His Mini Cooper was still parked in the driveway. The Golf was still absent and she presumed he might have had some other reason to leave for a short term. But then Lori heard from police in Bridgeport that they had arrested Max the night before, near the same building where his father had gone a few days before to confront the men Max had told him took the laptops, a location known to the police for drug sales and prostitution. Since the area is clearly posted, he was charged with third-degree criminal trespass, a misdemeanor. Max Hoagland told them he had gone there in the Golf to buy drugs, and that he had his mother's permission to use it. She told the Bridgeport police that he did not, and they held him on $2,500 bond. However, Max did not know where Robert might have gone. Investigation The Hoaglands also let the National Park Service Rangers know, on the theory that Robert might have gone on his own to hike the Appalachian Trail. Along with friends of the family, they printed up and distributed flyers with Hoagland's picture, and worked to bring media attention to the case. The Newtown police looked into the case as well, and soon learned of the events before Robert's disappearance such as the confrontation in Bridgeport and the cash withdrawal. A week after his disappearance his information was entered into the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System data base. About August 6, Lori found her husband's wallet and the keys to his car, hidden under a doll on a chair in their bedroom. She said later that this led her to change her original theory that her husband had left voluntarily to include the possibility that he might have been abducted. Around that time, Max pled guilty to the trespassing charge in Bridgeport and was released from jail. Police questioned the two men he said had stolen the laptops, but could not establish any link to the disappearance. Max also denied any knowledge of his father's whereabouts. Lori later said his arrest was unconnected to Robert's disappearance. Police also looked online. On his work computer, he was found to have searched several times on an address in Rhode Island, but no connection was found to his disappearance when it was investigated. A similar search on his home computer was frustrated due to a program, which he had apparently downloaded and installed a month before his disappearance, that allowed the user to delete all records of searches and results. In the fall, Lori and volunteers searched wooded areas in and around Sandy Hook; police brought in search dogs as well. The Newtown police used sonar to search Lake Zoar along the Housatonic River on the edge of town in September. None of these efforts turned up any trace of Robert. Lori said these searches were about \\"eliminating possibilities.\\" The next month, Chris Hoagland, the eldest son, left his job in the tourism industry in Hilton Head, South Carolina, to take over his father's responsibilities around the house. Also in September 2013, the family began the court process necessary to appoint a trustee to represent Robert's interests, although they hoped it would not be necessary. =Possible sightings= Later in September, two sightings of men matching Hoagland's description were reported in Rhode Island, which borders Connecticut to the east. A man with a backpack was seen walking along Rhode Island Route 117 and Interstate 95 near Warwick; it turned out to be someone else. A short time later, Rhode Island Department of Transportation workers also reported seeing a similar-looking man, also with a backpack, walking west along Rhode Island Route 165 near the Connecticut state line at Voluntown. Police were unable to locate that man or determine his identity. In December the Los Angeles Police Department asked citizens of that area to be on the lookout for Hoagland, who his family said had connections to several Los Angeles suburbs, including Hollywood. While no significant sightings have been reported there, in January another sighting came, much closer to Newtown. Someone reported to police that they saw Hoagland at a Savers thrift store in Brookfield, just to the north. He was reportedly driving a car with New York license plates. However, review of security-camera video from the store was inconclusive. Around the one-year anniversary of Robert's disappearance, in late July 2014, another sighting near Newtown was reported. A man told officials of the Putnam County, New York, sheriff's office that he had seen Hoagland going into the county jail in Carmel, the county seat, a short distance from Connecticut, and then leaving after two minutes. However, the only video footage the county could find that might have shown the man was from the building's exterior, and the man on it could not be conclusively identified. At that time, some of the Hoagland family friends complained about the slow pace of the search. They believed the possibility of criminal activity was highly likely in the case, and that the police had tacitly concluded that he had left the area of his own accord, in order to devote less resources to the investigation. \\"All we know is that he went to the Church Hill Road Mobil gas station, filled up his car and bought a map. We're at the same place we were at Day One,\\" said one officer. They faulted the police for not publicizing the case more or enlisting the assistance of other law enforcement agencies. In his department's defense, Kehoe said detectives were still \\"putting a lot of effort\\" into the investigation. In November 2014, Newtown police received another tip that Robert might be working in a restaurant in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. They clarified to a local newspaper that the tipster had not claimed to have actually seen him, only that he might be there. Their counterparts in Horry County, where Myrtle Beach is located, provided assistance. At that time, Richard Robinson, a Newtown supervising detective stated \\"We cannot say how long it may be before it's known whether Mr. Hoagland is [in South Carolina] or not.\\" =Disappeared episode= In 2016 the producers of the Investigation Discovery series Disappeared focused an episode on Hoagland's disappearance. Since there had been no significant leads or sightings since late 2014, Newtown police and the Hoagland family (who cooperated) were hopeful that it would produce some new information. The episode, \\"A Family Man\\", aired on May 31. =Theories= \\"Everything is on the table,\\" Newtown police chief Charles Kehoe said in 2014, as what might have happened to Robert. Two possibilities have emerged: that he was the victim of foul play, or that he decided to walk away from his life. The evidence suggests both and neither has emerged as more likely. Since Lori discovered her husband's wallet and keys hidden in their bedroom, she has come to believe foul play is a stronger possibility. She believes the (still unaccounted for) $600 to be an odd amount to withdraw if he was planning to disappear. This amount was more than could be withdrawn at an automatic teller machine yet nowhere near enough to live on for an extended period. Concerning their earlier separation, she stated \\"[i]f he wanted out of the marriage, all he would have had to say is that he wanted out of the marriage. But that was not remotely where we were.\\" His son Chris also finds it unlikely that his father left wearing neither pair of his loafers, \\"the only shoes he ever wore.\\" Lori says she believes it is possible that, where his children were concerned, Robert could have made someone feel scared enough to do him harm in return. \\"I've seen him chase people down the street with baseball bats,\\" she told the Danbury News-Times. Family and friends also do not believe he would have walked away from his children so readily. \\"I don't believe he just left,\\" says Lori. \\"Wouldn't he have surfaced by now?\\" The Hoagland family believes he is no longer in the Newtown area. \\"He's going to be stumbled upon,\\" Lori said. \\"Someone's going to find him accidentally, and I hope that's sooner than later.\\" His son Chris states: \\"What if he was taken ... and he's in a hole somewhere? ... I don't want to think it, but I have to.\\" See also *List of people who disappeared References External links *, page set up by family 2010s missing person cases Missing person cases in Connecticut Newtown, Connecticut 2013 in Connecticut July 2013 events in the United States ","title":"Disappearance of Robert Hoagland"},{"id":"51117983","text":"Zinc finger protein 229 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ZNF229 gene.

The club currently competes in the Leamington and District Chess League with neighbouring clubs including Solihull, Stratford, Banbury, Kenilworth, Solihull and Nuneaton. The club is based at the Oak House Liberal Club, 87 Upper Holly Walk, Leamington Spa, CV32 4JS, and meets every Tuesday, year round, starting at 7.30pm. History The first president of the club was the Rev. John Henry Smith, the Vicar of Milverton, The secretary was the Rev W S Temple. In 1858, the \\"Chess Association\\" as it now styled itself, held a meeting at Queen's College, Birmingham. On 27 August, Paul Morphy gave a blindfold simultaneous display against eight opponents, chosen apparently more for their official positions than their chess ability. One board was taken by the new secretary of the Leamington Chess Club, Jabez Carr, who tried to confuse the blindfolded Morphy with an irregular flank opening and was duly trounced in 23 moves. In 1885, the Rev William Grundy, headmaster of King's School in Warwick and a member of the Leamington Chess Club, organised a small invitation Chess Congress at the school from 5 to 10 January. Again there were two tournaments. The First Class ended in a tie between Grundy and Rev John Coker of Buckinghamshire. The Second Class was won by Rev. Arthur Percy Dodd, at the time curate of Weston under Wetherley and secretary of the Leamington Chess Club. There were also three consultation games, one of which contributed to the theory of the Steinitz Gambit in the Vienna Game. It was published in the British Chess Magazine and the white king was chased right across the board, where the tables were turned and it helped to mate black in only twenty moves. Rosario Aspa, a Sicilian-born member of the Leamington Club, was one of the victorious consultees. In December 1890, the great J H Blackburne gave two simultaneous displays at the Royal Pump Rooms against the members of the Leamington Club, winning all 22 games on 22 December and the next day taking on six players blindfolded, winning four games and drawing two. A document from 1896 lists Blackburne as an honorary member of the club and at that time the club possessed a framed list of past members which also included Howard Staunton and Herr Lowenthal from the 1850s. In the earliest document still in the club archive (existing only in photocopied form) dated February 1891, with the address \\"Pump Room\\", Signor Aspa, Rev. A.P. Dodd, W. Hannay Esq. and Dr. Haynes are named as vice-presidents and the club president as Right Hon. Arthur Wellesley Peel. The earliest known evidence of the latter comes from an article (reprinted from the Hereford Times) on the popularity of chess in the smoke-room of the House of Commons, in the December 1890 British Chess Magazine. \\"The Speaker, we presume, is a chessplayer, since he is the president of the Leamington Chess Club.\\"British Chess Magazine, December 1890 It is not known when A W Peel (youngest son of Sir Robert Peel) became club president but from 1865 he had been one of the two MPs representing rural Warwickshire and, having been elected Speaker of the House of Commons in 1884 following franchise reform, in 1885 he was returned unopposed by the new single-member constituency of Warwick and Leamington. According to the Dictionary of National Biography, \\"Peel proved to be a formidable Speaker.... his moral effect was famously seen on the night of 27 July 1893 when during the committee stage of the second [Irish] Home Rule Bill a serious fight broke out on the floor of the House. The chairman of committees summoned the speaker whose arrival in the house, like that of 'a parent wise as well as fond' at once restored order.\\"H. C. G.

Presumably keeping Leamington Chess Club in order was a doddle in comparison. He retired as Speaker for reasons of ill-health and was raised to the peerage; Rt. Hon. Viscount Peel remained president until at least 1896.

He wrote two volumes of The Official History of Australia's Involvement in Southeast Asian Conflicts 1948‚Äì1975, and several other high- profile works on Australia's military history. He was the first non-American to become the president of the Society for Military History, but is perhaps best known as the author of A Military History of Australia (first edition 1990). Early life and education Jeffrey Guy Grey was born on 19 March 1959, the son of Ron Grey, an Australian Army officer and his wife Patricia. He had two sisters, Penny and Gina. His family was a military one; his father eventually reached the rank of major general, and two of his uncles became brigadiers. Raised as an Army brat, he moved about frequently; but lived most of his early life in Canberra, where he settled. He entered the Australian National University, from which he graduated in 1983, and joined the Faculty of Military Studies at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, as a teaching fellow. He completed his doctorate there under the supervision of Peter Dennis, writing his 1985 thesis on \\"British Commonwealth forces in the Korean War: a study of a military alliance relationship\\". Career Grey joined the Historical Section of the Department of Foreign Affairs, but returned to the University of New South Wales at the new Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA) campus in 1988, and became a professor there in 2003. Over the years he taught thousands of cadets and midshipmen, and supervised numerous postgraduate students. He wrote prolifically about the Korean War and the Vietnam War. With Peter Dennis he wrote about the Indonesian Confrontation in Emergency and Confrontation (1996), a volume of The Official History of Australia's Involvement in Southeast Asian Conflicts 1948‚Äì1975, and was the sole author of another volume in the series, Up Top (1998), which detailed the role of the Royal Australian Navy in the Malayan Emergency, the Indonesian Confrontation and the Vietnam War. He was perhaps best known as the author of A Military History of Australia (first edition 1990), a widely used single- volume textbook. With his colleagues at ADFA, he produced the Oxford Companion to Australian Military History. He wrote the volume on the Australian Army for the Oxford Australian Centenary History of Defence, and the volume on The War with the Ottoman Empire (2015) for The Centenary History of Australia and the Great War, a project for which he was a driving force. In cooperation with Peter Dennis and Roger Lee from the Army History Unit, he ran the annual Army History Conference, for which he managed to secure distinguished historians from around the world as speakers. For an Australian military historian, he was unusually well known outside Australia. He held the Major General Matthew C. Horner Chair of Military Theory at the United States Marine Corps University in Quantico, Virginia, from 2000 to 2002, and in 2015 he became the first non-American to become the President of the Society for Military History. Grey died suddenly on 26 July 2016. A memorial service was held at the Anzac Memorial Chapel at Duntroon, conducted by Tom Frame, the former Anglican Bishop of the Australian Defence Force. He was survived by his father Ron; sisters Penny and Gina; his first wife, Gina, and their daughter Victoria and son Duncan; his second wife, Emma and their five-year-old son Sebastian; and his step-daughters Hannah and Sophie. The October 2017 edition of The Journal of Military History was dedicated to Grey's memory, and featured several articles by or about him.

He suffered incarceration several times during the pre-independence period, including a term in the Cellular Jail. The Government of India awarded him the third highest civilian honour of the Padma Bhushan, in 1977, for his contributions to society.  Biography  Prithvi Singh Azad was born on 15 September 1892 at Lalru, a small town in Mohali district of the North Indian state of Punjab. He was a Rajput but he did a lot of work for the upliftment of Dalits. He was attracted to the nationalist movement while he was still in his teens and was reported to have been influenced by the arrest of Lokmanya Tilak and Khudi Ram Bose by the British government in 1907‚Äì08. He visited the US in 1912 and it was during this time he met Lala Har Dayal, one of the founders of later-day Ghadar Party, a militant organization formed by Indians in North America for the liberation of India. He also assisted in the establishment of Hindustan Ghadar, the mouthpiece of the party. Returning to India along with around 150 freedom fighters, he was captured by the British on 7 December 1914, tried, sentenced for 10 years' imprisonment and spent time in various jails, including Calcutta, Madras and the Cellular Jail. After the initial futile attempt, he escaped by jumping out of a running train while he was being transferred from one jail to another. Later, he became an associate of Chandra Shekhar Azad and reportedly received a Mauser pistol from him. It was reported that Azad was with Chandra Shekhar Azad just before the British forces surrounded him at Alfred Park on 27 February 1931, but the latter asked Prithvi Singh to escape while deciding to continue his battle with the forces; alternatively another contention was that the two Azads met at Alfred Park a few days before the death of Chandra Shekhar. the plaque at Pruthvisinh Azad's bust at Bhavnagar It was Chandra Shekhar who advised Azad to visit Russia for further training; it was reported that the idea to send Azad to Russia in fact came from Bhagat Singh, another martyred revolutionary and Chandra Sekhar was conveying Bhagat Singh's request. He visited Russia to spend a few months there and his experiences in Russia were later published as a book, Lenin ke Desham Me, which was subsequently translated into English by Vijay Chauhan under the title, Prithvi Singh Azad In Lenin's land. On his return to India, he met several mainstream freedom fighters, including Mohandas Gandhi and joined the nationalist movement led by Gandhi. Between 1933 and the Indian independence in 1947, he was arrested several times which included the Lahore Conspiracy Case in which he was sentenced to death; the sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment in the Cellular Jail. After the Indian independence, he successfully contested the elections to the first Constituent Assembly of India from Punjab and was its member since the assembly met for the first time at Constitution Club Hall, New Delhi on 9 December 1946. After the Indian independence, he was selected as the Minister for Labor and Local Self-government, the only harijan member of the ministry, when Bhim Sen Sachar took over as the second Chief Minister of Punjab in 1949. The Government of India honored him with the civilian honor of Padma Bhushan in 1977. Azad died on 5 March 1989, at the age of 96. The story of his life has been documented in two autobiographies; Kranti Path ka Pathik (A Traveler in the Revolutionary Path), was published in 1990 by Haryana Sahitya Akademi while Baba Prithvi Singh Azad, the Legendary Crusader was published by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan three years earlier in 1987. A set of documents related his life has been preserved in Nehru Memorial Museum and Library, New Delhi as Baba Prithvi Singh Azad Papers. A local Hospital in Lalru, his native place, is being considered for renaming as Baba Prithvi Singh Azad Memorial Hospital.

It was proclaimed in 1869 by Governor Fergusson after whom the county was named.  Description  The County of Fergusson covers the part of Yorke Peninsula \\"lying to the south of the south boundary of the County of Daly, including Wauraltee Island\\", the county boundary approximately aligning with Price town centre. History The County of Fergusson was proclaimed by Sir James Fergusson, the eighth Governor of South Australia on 18 February 1869 along with three of its constituent hundreds, Melville, Moorowie and Para Wurlie. The county was named after Governor Fergusson, who held office from 1869 to 1873. Sixteen hundreds were proclaimed within the county from 1869 to 1878: Carribie and Coonarie in 1878, Cunningham in 1873, Curramulka in 1874, Dalrymple and Kilkerran in 1872, Koolywurtie in 1874, Maitland in 1872, Melville in 1869, Minlacowie in 1874, Moorowie in 1869, Muloowurtie in 1874, Para Wurlie in 1869, Ramsay in 1872, Warrenben in 1878 and Wauraltee in 1874. The earliest local government bodies established within the county were the District Council of Melville, formed in 1875 and comprising the Hundred of Melville and part of the Hundred of Moorowie, the Corporate Town of Yorketown which seceded from Melville in 1879, the Corporate Town of Edithburgh which seceded from the same in 1882, the Corporate Town of Maitland, formed in 1883 within the Hundred of Maitland, and the District Council of Dalrymple, formed in 1877 and comprising the Hundred of Dalrymple. Until 1888 the remaining residents of Yorke Peninsula, scattered across 14 hundred divisions, strongly resisted the establishment of local government. This allowed them to escape being subject to the expense of council rates until 1888 when the promulgation of the District Councils Act 1887 forced the incorporation of the entire peninsula into district councils. Thus, from January 1888: * The hundreds of Cunningham, Kilkerran, Wauraltee and Muloowurtie were incorporated as the new District Council of Yorke Peninsula, along with a previously unincorporated portion of the Hundred of Maitland; * The hundreds of Curramulka, Koolywurtie and Minlacowie were incorporated as the new District Council of Minlaton, along with a previously unincorporated portion of the Hundred of Ramsay; and * The hundreds of Carribie, Coonarie, Para Wurlie and Warrenben were incorporated into the District Council of Melville along with a previously unincorporated portion of the Hundred of Moorowie.

The conference is attended by procurement managers, procurement specialists, financial managers, medical equipment suppliers, representatives from cities, municipalities and authorities who are responsible for public procurement, and many more. One of the biggest attractions of eBF is the participation of foreign guests from multinationals such as RWE, Google, and Siemens. The conference organisers are rebranding it as a festival of the e-enabling of public and corporate procurement, which means that the programme takes place in five spaces concurrently and includes more than 75 speakers. The conference opens with an exhibition where works of art created by the organisers, speakers, and other participants are exhibited. The conference also features the announcement of the winners of the international Esourcing FSA (Fair Sourcing Awards) competition. Prizes are awarded to representatives of municipalities and companies, and to individuals who have contributed to the development of eAuctions.*Konference eBF aneb ka≈ædoroƒçn√≠ rande eAukƒçn√≠ch p≈ô√≠znivc≈Ø.

Following the unification of Montenegro with Brda, the Ottoman governor of the Sanjak of Scutari launched a military offensive onto Montenegrin territory. Two Montenegrin divisions, led by Prince-bishop Petar I Petroviƒá-Njego≈° and guvernadur Jovan Radonjiƒá, containing 3,000 men, took positions near Martiniƒái. The Ottomans advanced towards Martiniƒái from Spu≈æ with 18000 men, fighting guerilla resistance for nine days, before launching an assault on Montenegrin positions on 11 July. Montenegrins counter-attacked and the Ottomans suffered significant casualties. The result of this victory, followed by another victory at Krusi was the unification of Piperi and Bjelopavliƒái clan regions, previously occupied by the Ottoman Empire, with Montenegro.

Life Jones was born in the neighbourhood of Wolverhampton in 1835. While young he began to study the rocks of his local district, and published a short treatise The Geology of South Staffordshire. He was secretary of the South Staffordshire Ironmasters' Association from an early age until 1866, when he was appointed secretary to the Cleveland Ironmasters' Association, and moved to Middlesbrough. In his new position Jones took an active part in the formation of the board of arbitration and conciliation for the iron trade of the north of England. He acted on this board, as the representative of the employers, until his death. He was also secretary of the Middlesbrough Chamber of Commerce and of the British Iron Trade Association; shortly before his death he was appointed secretary to the Association of Agricultural Engineers. He founded the Iron and Steel Institute in 1868, and he continued to act as secretary and editor of its journal until his death. Jones established a weekly iron exchange at Middlesbrough. He founded and edited two or three newspapers connected with the iron trade, notably the Iron and Coal Trades Review. He was elected an associate of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers in 1869, and became a full member in 1873. Jones died at Saltburn-by-the-Sea on 6 June 1877, aged forty-two, after a long illness. He had invested in companies in iron industries of the north of England which failed, and died penniless; a fund was raised by the members of the Iron and Steel Institute for the benefit of his wife and children. Scientific papers Jones wrote about twenty papers on scientific (mainly geological) subjects, the first of which, \\"On Rhynchonella acuta and its Varieties\\", appeared in The Geologist in 1858. At the Middlesbrough meeting of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers in 1871 Jones read a paper \\"The Geology of the Cleveland Iron District\\" (Proceedings of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers for 1871, page 184).

The poem seeks to express the wondrous diversity of creation, usually by drawing vivid contrasts between different natural phenomena, one of which is usually physically higher and more magnificent, and one of which is usually physically lower and more mundane. De creatura is one of two of Aldhelm's riddles known to have been translated into Old English (the other being the Leiden Riddle): a fairly close but expansive, albeit now fragmentary, translation survives as the 108-line Riddle 40 of the Exeter Book (according to the numbering of the Anglo-Saxon Poetic Records). This was itself shortened and reworked as the ten-line Riddle 66, and adapted even further as the now largely lost, presently six-line Riddle 94, both also found in the Exeter Book. These riddles stand as a rare example of an Old English poem surviving in multiple copies.Erin Sebo, 'The Creation Riddle and Anglo- Saxon Cosmology', in The Anglo-Saxons: The World through their Eyes, ed. by Gale R. Owen-Crocker and Brian W. Schneider, BAR British Series, 595 (Oxford: Archaeopress, 2014), pp. 149-56. Aldhelm's De creatura De creatura is the culminatory hundredth poem of Aldhelm's collection of verse riddles, known as the Enigmata, and also much the longest. The Enigmata survive included in his work on Latin poetics, the Epistola ad Acircium (presumably composed during the reign of its apparent addressee, Aldfrith of Northumbria, 685-704/5). Many of the Enigmata are based on the riddles of Symphosius. Not so, however, De creatura. Several lines of De creatura seem to be echoing a text in the Corpus Hermeticum, Treatise XI, 20, where the Divine Intellect, the Mind of God, is addressing Hermes Trismegistus. This text is otherwise unknown until its discovery and translation (from Greek into Latin) in the Renaissance.A.D. Nock and A.-J. Festugi√®re, Corpus Hermeticum, 4 Vols., Paris : Les Belles Lettres, 1945-1954, Vol. I, Poimandr√®s - Trait√©s II-XII, 147-157. Frances A. Yates, Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition, London etc. : Routledge and Kegan Paul / The University of Chicago Press, 1982 (1964), 31-32. Brian P. Copenhaver, Hermetica: The Greek Corpus Hermeticum and the Latin Asclepius in a New English Translation, with Notes and Introduction, Cambridge : Cambridge University Press, 1992, 41. One possible explanation for Aldhelm's acquaintance with this passage is his teacher, the North African Berber scholar Hadrian (before 637-710), abbot of Saints Peter and Paul at Canterbury since 668. Hadrian came from Egypt, the home-land of Hermes Trismegistus. A sample, lines 18-30, follows, in the translation of A. M. Juster: > :Dum pater arcitenens concessit iure guberno; :Grossas et graciles rerum > comprenso figuras. :Altior en caelo rimor secreta Tonantis, :Et tamen > inferior terris tetra Tartara cerno; :Nam senior mundo praecessi tempora > prisca, :Ecce, tamen matris horno generabar ab alvo :Pulchrior auratis dum > fulget fibula bullis, :Horridior ramnis et spretis vilior algis. :Latior en > patulis terrarum finibus exto :Et tamen in media concludor parte pugilli; > :Frigidior brumis necnon candente pruina, :Cum sim Vulcani flammis > torrentibus ardens. > : > :While God the Archer deigns, by right I rule :The universe beneath the > highest star; :I grasp things, gross and graceful as they are. :Behold! I > see God's secrets down through the sky, :yet under land foul Hell attracts > my eye; :I lived before time, older than the Earth. :Behold! My mother's > womb begets my birth, :More gorgeous than gold amulets that glitter, :More > gross than thorns, more vile than low-tide litter. :Behold! I'm wider than > the limits of Earth's lands, :Yet can be held within a person's hands; > :Colder than gleaming frost and winter, though :In Vulcan's searing blazes I > may glow. Here is the text of the Corpus Hermeticum, Treatise XI, 20 (in the translation by Brian P. Copenhaver) to which these lines in Aldhelm‚Äôs poem correspond:Hermetica: The Greek Corpus Hermeticum and the Latin Asclepius in a New English Translation, with Notes and an Introduction, trans. by Brian P. Copenhaver (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992), p. xi. . > Thus, unless you make yourself equal to God, you cannot understand God; like > is understood by like. Make yourself grow to immeasurable immensity, outleap > all body, outstrip all time, become eternity and you will understand God. > Having conceived that nothing is impossible to you, consider yourself > immortal and able to understand everything, all art, all earning, the temper > of every living thing. Go higher than every height and lower than every > depth. Collect in yourself all the sensations of what has been made, of fire > and water, dry and wet; be everywhere at once, on land, in the sea, in > heaven; be not yet born, be in the womb, be young, old, dead, beyond death. Riddle 40 Linguistic evidence suggests that Riddle 40George Philip Krapp and Elliott Van Kirk Dobbie (eds), The Exeter Book, The Anglo-Saxon Poetic Records, 3 (New York: Columbia University Press, 1936), pp. 200-3. was probably not composed before the tenth century.R. D. Fulk, A History of Old English Meter (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1992), pp. 408‚Äì09. This is consistent with the fact that it was clearly translated from a recension of Aldhelm's poem in which lines 61-67 have been moved to before line 44. As the only manuscript of De creatura from Anglo-Saxon England to contain this recension is Oxford, Bodleian Library, Rawlinson C. 697, originally written on the Continent but brought to England by the earlier tenth century, and since this manuscript contains some glosses consistent with Riddle 40, it is conceivable and even likely that Riddle 40 was translated from Rawlinson C. 697 itself.Katherine O‚ÄôBrien O‚ÄôKeeffe, 'The Text of Aldhelm‚Äôs Enigma no. C in Oxford, Bodleian Library, Rawlinson C. 697 and Exeter Riddle 40', Anglo-Saxon England, 14 (1985) 61‚Äì73. Thomas A. Bredehoft has gone so far as to argue that Riddle 40 enjoys relatively little formulaic diction, but that those lines it does have in common with other Old English poems suggest a particularly strong association with other Exeter Book poems, suggesting that the translation must have been done in the mid-tenth century by someone familiar with a similar corpus of texts, and familiar with Dunstan's promotion of interest in Aldhelm at Glastonbury.Thomas A. Bredehoft, Authors, Audiences, and Old English Verse (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2009), pp. 107-13. Riddle 40 was given unusual prominence by the scribe of the Exeter Book, and might in an exemplar of the manuscript have stood as the culmination of a collection of 40 Old English riddles. Unfortunately its ending is lost due to a missing bifolium in the manuscript.Mercedes Salvador- Bello, 'Patterns of Compilation in Anglo-Latin Enigmata and the Evidence of A Source-Collection in Riddles 1-40 of the Exeter Book, Viator, 43 (2012), 339‚Äì374 (pp. 368-70). 10.1484/J.VIATOR.1.102554. Riddle 66 As edited by Krapp and Dobbie and translated by Sebo, Riddle 66 reads: > :Ic eom mare √æonne √æes middangeard, :l√¶sse √æonne hondwyrm, leohtre √æonne > mona, :swiftre √æonne sunne.

Say what I am called.Saint Aldhelm's > 'Riddles', trans. by A.M. Juster (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, > 2015), pp. 62-63. Riddle 66 has been praised for its tight composition, paring down the exuberant Riddle 40 to a cosmographical focus, giving an elegant structure and memorable form, most of which is paralleled in Riddle 94.Sebo, p. 153. Riddle 94 Riddle 94 is mostly now lost due to damage to the Exeter Book. As edited by Krapp and Dobbie and translated by Sebo, Riddle 66 reads: > :Sme√ær/ /ad, :hyrre √æonne heofon/ :gl√¶dre √æonne sunne, :/style, :smeare > √æonne sealtry/ :leofre √æonne √æis leoht eall, leohtre √æon w/Krapp and Dobbie, > p. 242. : > :Smoother ...

He was also a miner, dogger and perhaps the most widely travelled cameleer in Australia who could speak more than 30 languages. Early life Arltunga Historical Reserve Smith was born at the Arltunga goldfield and was the eldest of eleven children to William Smith, a goldminer of Welsh descent and an Aboriginal woman Topsy White (Topsy Smith). Although he had no formal education, his father taught him English and his mother and grandmother taught him eastern Arrernte and Arabana languages. At the age of 12, he accompanied Arrernte people on their last large ceremonial gathering in the Simpson Desert. They travelled with camels to a large clay-pan, where traditional hunting and gathering took place. After severe drought in 1914-15 drought and the 1919 influenza ceremonial gatherings took place on the desert-fringe cattle stations or at the edges of outback towns instead. After the death of his father in 1914, Smith's family moved to Alice Springs with the help of the Hayes family of Undoolya station and police sergeant Robert Stott. In Alice Walter lived with his mother at The Bungalow, a ‚Äòhalf-caste‚Äô institution. Smith married Millie Carnegie on 11 February 1929 at the Oodnadatta police station. While he was away on a prospecting journey to the western deserts, government officials removed Millie to Nepabunna Mission in the Flinders Ranges. Smith never saw her again. Working life Smith began working with Afghan cameleer Charlie Sadadeen, meeting the train at the railhead at Oodnadatta in South Australia, and taking a load to Alice Springs with a camel team as a teenager. He then worked as a prospector, gem fossicker, dogger (dingo trapper) and miner at Tennant Creek during the 1930s. He took out several mining leases in the Harts Range.

Victory is dependent upon solution to the logistic problem.\\" Although identified early as a vital strategic outpost, Port Moresby, the most significant Papuan town, had just two airfields and basic port facilities in early 1942. An enormous amount of work was required to transform it into a major base for both air and land operations against the Japanese. This was done in the face of frequent Japanese air raids. During the course of the Kokoda Track campaign, the two original airfields were improved, and five new airfields were developed. To make them operational, the engineers had to construct more than just runways; taxiways, hardstands, facilities and access roads all had to be built. The operation of the base depended on shipping, but the port facilities were limited. To increase the capacity of the port, a causeway was built to Tatana Island, where pontoon docks were emplaced. Engineers also built roads, warehouses, and a water treatment plant. They ran the town's electricity and water supply, and quarried stone for the roads and airstrips. The Allies were confronted with an interior covered with rainforest and tall mountains where wheeled vehicles could not operate. The Australian Army was forced to rely on air transport and native carriers, two modes of transportation that it had never used before. The techniques and technologies to deliver supplies by air were in their infancy. There were few aircraft available, and these were of a variety of different types, complicating maintenance. Air operations in New Guinea were restricted by the weather. Transport aircraft were vulnerable in the air, and required fighter escorts. They were also subject to destruction on the ground by Japanese air raids. The loss of the airstrip at Kokoda led to the adoption of air dropping. Due to a shortage of parachutes, supplies often had to be dropped without them, and loss due to breakages and unrecoverable goods was high. Thousands of Papuans were conscripted to help the war effort. Trucks and jeeps carried stores, ammunition and rations only part of the way; pack animals and a flying fox took them a bit farther. The rest of the journey was completed on the backs of Papuan carriers, who struggled over the mountains lugging heavy loads. The environment posed the danger of endemic tropic diseases, particularly dysentery, scrub typhus and malaria. Medical units had to combat these, while caring for the sick and wounded, many of whom had to walk back to the base area along the Kokoda Track. Often the Papuan carriers had to carry the wounded on the way back, earning them the sobriquet of \\"Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels\\". Background =Geography= Papua, New Guinea and the Solomon Islands The Kokoda Track In 1942, Papua was a territory of Australia. Around in area, it occupied the south eastern part of the island of New Guinea. The vegetation is largely rainforest; higher altitudes are covered in moss. The climate is mostly hot and humid with high rainfall, although the higher parts are cold, particularly at night. Tropical diseases, including malaria, scrub typhus, hookworm and dysentery were endemic. The native population also suffered from tropical ulcers, yaws and vitamin deficiencies, mainly beri beri. The population was about 300,000, of whom 1,800 were Europeans; there were very few Asians owing to Australia's immigration policy. The main exports were copra and natural rubber, of which it contributed about one-eighth of Australia's supply. There had been little development and it was largely devoid of infrastructure except around the administrative centre of Port Moresby on the southern coast, which had two airfields and basic port facilities. Port Moresby was relatively dry, with a rainfall of less than per annum, mostly as a result of the north eastern monsoon, which comes between December and April. By air, it was from the nearest Allied airbase at Townsville, although there was a small airfield on Horn Island in the Torres Strait, whereas the Japanese airfields at Lae and Salamaua were less than away. The Kokoda Track is a foot track that runs roughly south west from Kokoda overland through the Owen Stanley Range toward Port Moresby. It was used before the war as a mail route. While there is a main track that is associated with the fighting during the campaign, there are many parallel, interlocking tracks that follow much the same general course. The track reaches a height of . The terrain rises and falls with regularity, up to . This markedly increases the distance to be traversed, although there are flat areas, particularly around Myola. The higher elevations are frequently above cloud level resulting in fog. =Strategy= In the first six months of the Pacific War Japanese forces overran the Dutch East Indies. Rabaul was captured on 23 January 1942, Singapore fell on 15 February, Lae and Salamaua were occupied on 8 March, and Java surrendered on 9 March. Lieutenant General George Brett, the American commander in Australia, feared that the Japanese would invade north western Australia. The Australian Chiefs of Staff disagreed. In an appreciation drafted by Major General Sydney Rowell, then the Australian Deputy Chief of the General Staff, on 5 March they argued that the Japanese would attempt to cut Australia's communications with the United States by moving against Port Moresby, New Caledonia and Fiji. By mid-April, Allied intelligence was warning of an imminent Japanese seaborne attack on Port Moresby, which was repulsed in the Battle of the Coral Sea on 5‚Äì8 May. General Douglas MacArthur arrived in Australia on 17 March, and was appointed Supreme Commander of the newly established South West Pacific Area (SWPA) on 18 April. Ultra intelligence picked up Japanese plans for an overland advance on 19 May, and on 9 June he informed the commander of Allied Land Forces, General Sir Thomas Blamey, that the evidence was mounting that the Japanese might attempt to attack Port Moresby overland from Buna via Kokoda. On 20 June, Blamey ordered Brigadier Basil Morris, the commander of the 8th Military District, in charge of all the troops in Papua and New Guinea, to prevent such an attempt. In the wake of the Battle of Midway on 4‚Äì7 June, MacArthur began planning to recapture Rabaul. On 15 July, the Joint Chiefs of Staff ordered the first phase of the advance, the capture of Guadalcanal, despite MacArthur's warning that inadequate aircraft, airbases and shipping resources on hand made the operation extremely risky. A first step was to secure the Buna area, where airfields could be established from whence the Japanese bases could be attacked without aircraft having to overfly the Owen Stanley Range. Organisation The Australian Chiefs of Staff identified Port Moresby as an important outpost early in the war. A company of the 15th Infantry Battalion was sent to Port Moresby in July 1940 and in October was transferred to the 49th Infantry Battalion. In February 1941, the Chiefs of Staff decided to reinforce the garrison by sending the rest of the 49th Infantry Battalion, a Militia unit, but specially enlisted for service in the tropics. Port Moresby and the base installations On 8 December, warned that the Japanese might attack Rabaul and Port Moresby, the Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Vernon Sturdee decided to reinforce the garrison, sending the 39th and 53rd Infantry Battalions, and other units of the 30th Infantry Brigade, and the guns of the 13th Field Regiment and the 23rd Heavy Anti-Aircraft Battery. In January 1942, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) at Port Moresby consisted of six Hudson light bombers, four Wirraway general purpose aircraft and two Catalina flying boats. No fighters were available. The first Japanese air raid on Port Moresby occurred on 3 February 1942, and the anti-aircraft gunners shot down their first Japanese aircraft on 28 February, during a raid in which two RAAF Catalinas were destroyed. The February 1942 raids touched off panic, disorder and looting which Morris did not have the provost resources to control. The first fighter aircraft, Kittyhawks of No. 75 Squadron RAAF under the command of Squadron Leader John Francis Jackson, reached Port Moresby on 21 March, flying by way of Horn Island because they lacked the range to fly directly from Townsville. They soon became involved in the Battle of Port Moresby, taking heavy losses, and were relieved by the Bell P-39 Airacobras of the US 35th and 36th Fighter Squadrons on 30 April. Port Moresby experienced its one-hundredth air raid on 23 January 1943. The first unit of the Second Australian Imperial Force (AIF) to arrive, the 2/3rd Light Anti-Aircraft Battery, disembarked on 11 April 1942, having returned to Australia from the Middle East just four weeks before. The US 101st Coast Artillery (Anti-Aircraft) Battalion followed on 5 May, and its commander, Lieutenant Colonel Joseph B. Fraser, took charge of Port Moresby's anti- aircraft defences. Morris's command became New Guinea Force on 15 April. By the end of June the ground forces in New Guinea consisted of 1,098 AIF, 12,273 Militia and 2,208 American troops. On 24 June, Morris ordered the 39th Infantry Battalion (less one company) and the Papuan Infantry Battalion, as Maroubra Force, to defend Kokoda. The Japanese landed in the Buna area on 21 July. At this point, B Company of the 39th Infantry Battalion was at Kokoda, with C Company advancing along the track, departing Ilolo on 23 July. The remainder of the battalion was poised to move and most of it had arrived at Deniki by 4 August. Maroubra Force was run out of Kokoda on 29 July. MacArthur was sanguine about this, believing that the landings on Guadalcanal on 8 August would cause the Japanese to withdraw to Buna. Blamey was not so sure, and ordered the AIF 7th Division, under the command of Major General Arthur Allen, to Port Moresby to reinforce Maroubra Force. On 12 August 1942, Rowell assumed command of New Guinea Force. Morris remained as commander of the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit (ANGAU), which was responsible for civil affairs in Papua and New Guinea. United States Army Services of Supply (USASOS) units in Papua were initially part of Base Section2 in Far North Queensland, but on 20 August 1942, the US Advanced Base, New Guinea, was established under the command of Colonel A. J. Matthews. At first there was no Australian equivalent. Blamey suggested that one was required. Rowell demurred, but agreed to a Port Moresby Base Sub Area commander with a small staff. He emphasised that what he wanted was not some \\"officer wallah type\\" but a \\"practical man with commonsense\\". So Blamey sent Major Charles Moses, who possessed the requested attributes, being a former officer of the 8th Division who had escaped from Singapore. Blamey superseded Rowell in command of New Guinea Force on 23 September. MacArthur visited Blamey in Port Moresby on 4 October 1942 and the two agreed to establish a Combined Operations Service Command (COSC) to co-ordinate logistical activities. To command it, MacArthur appointed Brigadier General Dwight Johns, the deputy commander of USASOS in SWPA, an expert on airbase construction. He was given an Australian deputy, Brigadier Victor Secombe, who had directed the rehabilitation of the port of Tobruk in 1941. All Australian and American logistical units were placed under COSC, which also controlled a fleet of small craft and luggers. Shipping A cargo ship being unloaded at the wharf in Port Moresby in August 1942 Since New Guinea is an island, logistic support of the defenders ultimately depended on shipping. Australia started the war at a disadvantage because the Bruce-Page government sold the Government Line at a loss in 1928, leaving the country without shipping under national control. Australian ships were requisitioned by the Shipping Control Board, and by the end of 1942 almost all Australian coastal vessels had been taken up by the Board, the armed services, or the Americans. The Board resorted to chartering ships, but few were obtainable, as the British Ministry of War Transport and the American War Shipping Administration were in control of almost all the world's shipping. Some 24 ships were on charter on 1 January 1942; 22 were on 1 January 1943. Some \\"refugee\\" ships‚Äîships from occupied countries‚Äîreached Australian ports in 1942, although many of these were already on charter. An important role in the upcoming campaign was played by 21 Dutch Koninklijke Paketvaart-Maatschappij (KPM) refugee ships of . These, along with two other refugee ships and six vessels originally intended for the Shipping Control Board, were transferred to American control. During 1942, of cargo was carried by chartered ships, of which was coastal cargo. Lacking other options, resort was made to using ships on overseas voyages to carry coastal cargo. Between April and November 1942, this averaged each month. In addition, the Australian Army operated five troopships: the and , which could each carry 1,500 troops; and the smaller Gorgon, and Ormiston, which carried between 590 and 650 troops each. Having separate American and Australian shipping organisations saved the two armies from having to learn each other's procedures while still trying to master their own, but it created inefficiencies through the need for coordination. Twenty merchant ships were lost in Axis naval activity in Australian waters in 1942. In an air raid on Port Moresby on 17 June 1942, the was hit and set ablaze; three crewmen and a member of the Army working party were killed. A second air raid the following day scored more direct hits on the ship, which burned fiercely, and was a total loss. Five more members of the crew were killed and one fatally injured. Another 63 men were injured in the attack, including the master, Captain James Campbell. Two ships were attacked by Japanese submarines in the Gulf of Papua. The sank the by gunfire on 6 August 1942, and machine gunned survivors in the water. Of Mamutus 142 passengers and crew, 114 were lost. RO-33 struck again on 29 August, torpedoing the MV Malaita, which was returning to Cairns after delivering troops and supplies to Port Moresby. Although listing ten degrees to starboard, Malaita remained afloat, and was taken in tow by and . Their escort, the destroyer , picked up an ASDIC contact on the RO-33, and delivered a series of depth charge attacks and sank it. MV Malaita lists after being torpedoed by the off Port Moresby on 29 August 1942 Port Moresby became congested in September 1942. This represented a dangerous situation, as ships there were subject to Japanese air attacks, so procedures were instituted whereby ships would wait at Townsville until called forward. Due to lack of capacity at Port Moresby, it made no sense for ships to travel in convoy, so they sailed to and from Port Moresby individually or in small groups. Convoys to New Guinea did not commence until December 1942. Turnaround time for ships from Townsville to Port Moresby was 11 to 13 days, of which five to seven were spent awaiting discharge in Port Moresby. Some 125 ship voyages were made to Port Moresby between May and November 1942. During 1942, 3,033 vehicles, 199 guns and of stores were shipped to New Guinea. The standard ocean-going cargo ship was the Liberty ship. They were not ideal for logistical purposes. With a maximum speed of , they were slow, but this was considered less important than their ability to be turned out cheaply and in large numbers. They were deliberately built small, which reduced the loss when one was sunk, but limited the cargo capacity to . Critically, their draft was when fully laden. They had five small holds, each with its own hatch. Their curved sides made them wider at the top than the bottom, and wider amidships than fore and aft. Containerisation of shipping did not begin until a decade after war, so most wartime military shipments were break bulk cargo, with goods in bags, boxes, crates, barrels and drums. This was very efficient in terms of shipping space, but loading and unloading was consequently slow and manpower intensive. It also meant that ships could be unloaded with their own tackle, without special port facilities. Loading a ship was something of an art form. The ideal was to make best use of irregular spaces. Goods had to be stowed so as to wedge everything together tightly, as items that shifted at sea could break open and cause damage to their contents and other items. A load that shifted could even cause the ship to capsize. Loading at Australian ports was frequently disorganised and sloppy. Manifests were not flown ahead, so New Guinea Force did not know the contents of a shipment beforehand. Some ships arrived without manifests. The labelling of contents was also poor, and boxes often had to be broken into to determine their contents. Even then it was not always apparent who the intended recipient was. Much of the problem was poor staff work by the inexperienced Movement Control staff at Advanced Allied Land Forces Headquarters (LHQ) in Brisbane. The Australian Army had never had to handle such work before. Men with experience in the shipping industry were appointed as Movement Control officers, but it took time for them to learn about military cargoes and procedures. Base development =Port= Causeway to Tatana Island In early 1942 Port Moresby had only one deepwater wharf and two small jetties. Another pre-war wharf had existed at Bootless Inlet but in the panic, had been demolished and the inlet mined without recording the location of the mines. The timber wharf had an approach that was long and wide and a T-section long and wide. As such, it could accommodate only one Liberty ship at a time. The jetties, one stone and one timber, were just long, and could be used only by lighters and shallow draft vessels. To increase the rate of discharge, the Tug and Lighter Company, a unit which had served in the Siege of Tobruk, was sent to Port Moresby. On arrival on 23 August, it found only two lighters and no tugboats. It improvised, repairing the wharf's crane and salvaging tackle from the wreck of the Macdhui. Harbour craft arrived on Liberty ships over the next couple of months, but no more than one tug and ten lighters were available at any time during 1942. The African-American 611th Port Company arrived in June, and the Australian 2/1st Docks Operating Company in mid-September. Major R. C. Ballantyne, who had been in charge of wharf operations at Tobruk, was appointed Docks Superintendent. Unloading was still slowed by the lack of storage space in the wharf area. The dumps had been dispersed in the hills up to from Port Moresby, the roads were poor, and there was a serious shortage of trucks to move stores from the wharf to the dumps. Ship berths on Tatana Island were initially earth causeways leading to pontoon docks, which were later replaced with pile structures Eight ships bound for Port Moresby were lying idle off Townsville or Cairns on 12 October, waiting to be called forward. General Headquarters (GHQ) SWPA estimated that at the current rate of discharge it would take two weeks before they were called forward. Ironically, five of them were carrying equipment and stores needed to upgrade the port facilities. Extending the wharf required pilings and heavy timbers that were not immediately available. Matthews decided on a bold plan. Tatana Island, about west of Port Moresby, had deep water off its northwest side. About offshore, it was separated from the mainland by shallow water with a coral reef bottom. He proposed taking the 2nd Battalion, 96th General Service Regiment off its work on aerodrome maintenance and refuelling and rearming aircraft, and use them to construct a causeway from the mainland to Tatana Island, where pontoon docks could be built. The materials required were immediately available, but doubts were expressed about whether a causeway could withstand the force of storms and tides. Lacking boats for a hydrographic survey, one was conducted by wading during an exceptionally low tide in late September. Work commenced on 5 October. Equipment and personnel were ferried across to Tatana Island so it could proceed from both ends. Some of fill totalling was required to establish a roadway long and wide above the high tide mark. Work was completed on 30 October and the first ship berthed there on 3 November. Port capacity was increased from per day. However, the project did not proceed without controversy. A heavy downpour on 21 October confirmed the airmen's worst fears, and Lieutenant General George C. Kenney, the commander of Allied Air Forces (AAF), sent a letter to MacArthur on 26 October informing him that while work to upgrade the airfield runways before the wet season was nearly completed, aircraft could not operate from them without taxiways, hardstands, facilities and access roads, all of which were far from ready. He warned that he might have to withdraw at least two squadrons back to Australia. Major General Richard Sutherland, MacArthur's chief of staff at GHQ, and Brigadier General Hugh J. Casey, his chief engineer, reassured Kenney everything possible would be done to keep the airfields operational in the wet season. Additional engineer units were ordered to Port Moresby, and work on the port and the Nine Mile Quarry was handed over to the Australians. =Airfields= Kila Drome, also known as Three Mile Drome On 31 March‚Äîjust a fortnight after his arrival in Australia‚ÄîMacArthur sent Casey and his air officer, Brigadier General Harold H. George to survey the situation in Port Moresby. They drew up plans to develop it into a base to support future operations. They recognised that to secure the area required work far beyond its environs. They called for the airfield at Horn Island to be upgraded, and new airfields to be constructed on the Cape York Peninsula north of Townsville around Mareeba, Cooktown and Coen. This would allow ships to have fighter cover crossing the Torres Strait. To protect Port Moresby's eastern flank, GHQ decided to establish an airstrip in the Abau‚ÄìMullins Harbour area. Milne Bay was subsequently determined to be a better location, and a garrison was sent by sea from Port Moresby on 22 June. Another strip, at Merauke on the south coast of Dutch New Guinea, was authorised on 22 June to protect the western flank. The airfields in the Port Moresby area were initially known by their approximate distance from Port Moresby. In April 1942, there were only two operational airfields: Seven Mile Drome, an airfield developed by the RAAF with a single runway, and Three Mile Drome (also known as Kila Airfield), a pre-war civilian airfield. Work had commenced on two more: Fourteen Mile, also known as Laloki, and Five Mile, which had originally been developed as an emergency landing strip. Four more were subsequently developed: Twelve Mile, Fourteen Mile, Seventeen Mile and Thirty Mile. On 10 November, the Port Moresby airfields, except for Kila, were renamed after men who had been killed defending them. Seven Mile was renamed after Jackson, who was shot down over Port Moresby on 28 April; Fourteen Mile after Charles Schwimmer, one of four American P-39 pilots who was lost in an attack on Lae on 4 May; and Five Mile after Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Ward, the commander of the 53rd Infantry Battalion, who was involved in its construction, and was killed in the fighting on the Kokoda Track on 27 August. Twelve Mile was renamed Berry after Major Jack W. Berry, the commander of the 39th Fighter Squadron, who was killed on a practice bombing mission on 4 August when his bomb exploded directly underneath his aircraft, causing it to flip and crash into the sea. Seventeen Mile was renamed Durand after First Lieutenant Edward D. Durand, the first American fighter pilot shot down over New Guinea. After being forced down near Salamaua on 30 April, he was captured and executed by the Japanese. Thirty Mile Drome, also known as Rorona, was renamed Rogers after Major Floyd (Buck) Rogers, the commander of the 8th Bombardment Squadron, whose A-24 Banshee dive bomber was shot down over Gona on 29 July. Engineer units in Port Moresby at the end of April were the 7th Field Company, 1st Army Troops Company, the field stores section of the 61st Field Park Company, a section of the 1st Mechanical Equipment Company, and the 1st Bomb Disposal Section. The 14th Field Company arrived with the 14th Infantry Brigade in May. The first US troops to be stationed in New Guinea were an advance party of the African-American 96th Engineer Battalion on 28 April, but the battalion was not complete until June. They were followed by Company E of the 43rd Engineer General Service Regiment and a dump truck section of the 576th Engineer Company. The 808th Engineer Aviation Battalion arrived in July. The 96th Engineer Battalion was reorganised as the 96th Engineer General Service Regiment in September. In response to Kenney's 26 October warning to MacArthur, the 46th and 91st Engineer General Service Regiments and the rest of the 576th Dump Truck Company were ordered to move to Port Moresby in November. Steel bridge over the Laloki River completing the route between Port Moresby and Schwimmer Drome The main mission of the 96th was patching Jackson Drome's runways after Japanese bombing, but they also assisted with refuelling aircraft and loading them with bombs, and unloading ships in the harbour. It was found that craters could not be repaired simply by filling the holes with rubble. They would quickly fill with water, settle, and become a bog hole. A proper repair required that the water be pumped out, and the crater filled with stone, which had to be compacted, rolled and re- surfaced. In addition to the craters, bombing sprayed fragments that could puncture tyres, causing accidents on takeoff and landing. A visual search for fragments had to be made after each raid. The engineers discovered that they had much to learn about airfield construction in Papua, particularly the importance of proper drainage. The arrival of the 808th Engineer Aviation Battalion permitted extensive rehabilitation work on Jackson. The runway had been sealed with an excess of bitumen, which became soft in the heat, and parked aircraft tended to sink into it. When the bitumen was removed to be re- laid, hydroscopic clay under parts of the runway became supersaturated through seepage, and springs developed. The engineers were forced to install underground drains, and put down a new base of crushed rock, which was sealed with bitumen. Although air operations were curtailed, the airfield remained operational. Kila Drome was originally considered too poorly-located to be more than an emergency strip, because a high ridge from one end of the runway, restricted air operations. However, the airfield was seldom fogged in, and could often operate when all the other airfields were closed. It was therefore decided to increase the runway to . The first coat of bitumen was applied in November 1942, but before the final coat could be applied, heavy rains came and saturated the subgrade. The runway rutted and became more hazardous than ever. The 96th Engineer General Service Regiment dug a ditch along the length of the runway, but this became another aviation safety hazard. The ditch was then filled in with rock to create a French drain. Supply road from Port Moresby to Jackson Drome Bulldozers carved Schwimmer Drome out of the jungle. Only a few feet above the normal level of the Laloki River, it was susceptible to periodic flooding. The base material used for the runway was laid over alluvial sand and gravel, and Marston Mat used for the surface. The resulting runway was not capable of all-weather operation, so a second runway was constructed parallel to the first. This time gravel dredged from the Laloki River was used as a base. It was spread while wet and then rolled to form a firm base. Marston Mat was removed from the original to provide a surface for the new all-weather runway, which was ready for use in November 1942. A low trestle bridge over the Laloki River provided access. It was understood that the bridge might be washed away by floods, so pontoon equipment was provided for this eventuality. This was needed; a downpour on 21 October swept away the bridge, and rendered Three Mile, Seven Mile and Thirty Mile non-operational. The bridge was replaced by a high steel structure. Berry was located on higher ground south east of Schwimmer. Casey and George assigned it a high priority, and the 96th Engineer General Service Regiment was assigned to the task. The existing dry weather strip was cleared and grubbed for a runway. The short runway restricted air operations to fighters and transports, but it could not be extended without extensive earth removal. It was ultimately surfaced with of crushed rock and gravel. C-53 Dakota transport of the 21st Troop Carrier Squadron takes off from Kila on a supply dropping mission to the Kokoda area. To enable heavy four-engine bombers to fly long-range missions, longer all- weather airfields were required. Casey designated two sites for development: the emergency airstrip at Wards, and a new site at Seventeen Mile. The work at Wards was assigned to No. 1 Mobile Works Squadron RAAF, which had been working on Wards since 17 August, surfacing it with gravel. It received its orders to construct a new runway west of the old one on 11 September. The runway was provided with a compacted gravel surface to hold the weight of heavy bombers. As the squadron also had to construct a water pipeline from the Waigani Swamp, the schedule slipped. Following a visit on 3 November by Colonel Leif Sverdrup from GHQ and Matthews, now the head of construction at COSC, additional resources were allocated. B Company of the 2/1st Pioneer Battalion arrived on 13 November to assist with laying the Marston Mat and the water pipes. The 46th Engineer General Service Regiment assisted with the dispersal areas and revetments. The original runway was then upgraded to all-weather standard too. The other site designated for heavy bombers was Seventeen Mile. The 808th Engineer Aviation Battalion cleared and grubbed the area, and laid out the runway. This was surfaced with of clay-bound shale, and sealed with tar to create an all-weather surface. This did not prove satisfactory, and Marston Mat had to be laid down. The Thirty Mile site on Galley Reach, an inlet north west of Port Moresby was accessible by water transport through a channel through the coral reef. A dry weather airstrip was constructed by Company E, 43rd Engineer General Service Regiment, with help from large numbers of Papuan labourers who loaded the river gravel into trucks. This was ready for use on 20 July, but to make it into an airbase required the construction of two docks on Galley Reach. In September, work was halted by the tactical situation, with Japanese patrols reported not far from Rorona. Air warning equipment was removed, and Marston Mat earmarked for Thirty Mile was allocated to other projects. By the end of November, the runway had been extended to , with sections at each end topped with Marston Mat. Work continued on all the other airfields in 1943, but Rogers was abandoned. =Infrastructure= American and Australian engineers at the Nine Mile Quarry in June 1943 The 1st Army Troops Company was responsible for Port Moresby's utilities: the power house, freezers, electrical installations, lighting and water supply. By June 1942 the water supply was close to its maximum capacity, with the pumping station at Bomana pumping water from the Laloki River 24 hours a day. The main water main ran under the south eastern end of the Jackson Drome, a prime target for Japanese air raids, and the water pipe was consequently prone to damage. From one cause or another there were 40 to 50 breaks per month. By October 1942 the reservoir level was falling, indicating that usage was exceeding pumping capacity. A new intake and pumping station was constructed near Schwimmer Drome to bring water from the Laloki River to a treatment plant and concrete reservoir on Twin Peaks Mountain. The 1st Army Troops Company assumed responsibility for its operation upon its completion in March 1943. Depots were established inland rather than in the vicinity of the port because the Japanese threatened a landing on the coast. A speed limit was imposed to minimise damage to the main road. This was covered with of dust that turned to mud when it rained. The surface soon broke up under heavy military traffic. The road was only wide enough to allow for one-way traffic and had a number of hairpin bends that required 3-ton trucks to make three-point turns. The 10th Advanced Ordnance Depot was established at 17 Mile in prefabricated huts, erected by Papuan labour, while the 8th Advanced Ammunition Depot handled the ammunition depots at 12 Mile and 19 Mile. In the crisis days of early 1942 some of ammunition was dumped where it was unloaded off the trucks and covered with tarpaulins, with only one storeman on hand to receive it. Soon, no one knew what lay under the tarpaulins. This was hard to rectify as there was an acute shortage of ordnance personnel due to the low priority accorded to service units. The 19 Mile site was poor and a new depot was developed on a better site at 12 Mile. US Army engineers manufacture concrete culvert pipes to alleviate the pipe shortage, watched by Brigadier General Dwight Johns (right) The depots and airbases depended on an efficient road network, so the engineers gave this a high priority. A major effort was made to bring the roads up to all-weather standard before onset of the 1942 wet season. New roads were also built. One of the first was the By Pass Road, which was designed to divert traffic from the main road, which ran around the south eastern end of Jackson Drome, and was therefore an operational hazard. The By Pass Road ran between Jackson and Wards Dromes, and was later extended to Berry, Schwimmer and Durand Dromes. The opening of the new wharf at Tatana Island in October caused a sudden increase in road traffic, so a new Barune Road was opened in November, providing a loop to Jackson and Wards Dromes. Fortunately, the local red shale contained clay and rock fragments, and when laid on a prepared subgrade and watered, either by sprinklers or rain, became hard like concrete. This could take motor vehicle traffic, although it became dusty when dry and slippery when wet. Surfacing material was obtained from the Nine Mile Quarry. Wood was found to be unsuitable for culverts, as it was quickly destroyed by the action of climate and insects. Oil drums were found to be superior, but they rusted, and using them for culverts depleted the drum supply. There were no facilities in Port Moresby for the bulk storage of petroleum products, so they were shipped and distributed in 44-gallon drums, as they were known in SWPA, where food and fuel distribution was through the Australian Army, which used the imperial gallon. A shortage of 44-gallon drums developed in late 1942. Some 150,000 went north but only 10,000 returned. New production was ordered from Rheem in Australia, and civilian holders of 44-gallon drums were urged to empty and return them. Unserviceable drums were either repaired by the Bulk Issues Petrol and Oil Depot (BIPOD) or handed over to salvage. A well-organised collection effort was undertaken by the Port Moresby Base Sub Area which resulted in over 20,000 empty drums being returned to Australia in November. Crucial to road and airfield development was the output of the Nine Mile Quarry. Initially it was run by the 1st Army Troops Company, which installed suspended electric lighting, allowing the quarry to be worked around the clock from 30 April 1942. Companies A and C of the 96th Engineer Battalion took over the running of the quarry in June. In turn, they were relieved by C Company of the 2/1st Pioneer Battalion in November. Work went on in three eight hour shifts per day, seven days a week. The face of the quarry was drilled from the top and dropped to the floor by blasting. Knapping hammers were used to break the stone into small pieces that could be lifted onto trucks by hand. There were two rock crushers on hand; an old model and a modern mobile diesel crusher supplied by the US Army. Support of combat operations =Overland supply= The 2/14th Field Company improves the road from Ilolo When the campaign began, the Kokoda Track started at McDonald's Corner, just beyond Ilolo. From there, the track slowly rose about to what later became known as Owers' Corner. The road from Port Moresby was sealed as far as Seven Mile, and from there a gravel surface was laid to provide an all- weather road as far as Sogeri, roughly from Port Moresby. On 24 June, GHQ queried whether it would be possible to upgrade the track to one that could handle animal transport or, better still, motor vehicles. There were multiple tracks leading to Kokoda, and in addition to the main track, there was interest at New Guinea Force HQ in a route along the Brown River that had been partially surveyed in 1912. On 5 July, there were 1,140 motor vehicles with New Guinea Force. Of these, 300 had arrived with the garrison in 1941, 120 were local vehicles that had been taken over, and 600 had arrived in April and May. The state of the available motor vehicles at this time was poor. Many of the impressed vehicles were odd types for which spare parts were scarce. Most vehicles had been in constant use, and maintenance had been neglected. Many were missing log books or had never had them, so what maintenance had been performed was uncertain. Moreover, the 30th Brigade had no light aid detachment (LAD) to work on them. Major P. A. Billis, the Deputy Assistant Director of Ordnance Services (DADOS) for Engineering recommended that 200 new vehicles be sent as a matter of urgency. More vehicles arrived with the 7th Division, and the 21st Brigade section of the 2/7th Division Workshop established itself at Ilolo on 19 August, mainly to service engineer equipment used for road work. Owers' Corner was named after Lieutenant Noel Owers, who was given the task of surveying a new route from Ilolo to Nauro. The project of constructing a jeep track to Nauro was pushed aggressively by the Chief Engineer at New Guinea Force, Brigadier John Main. Lieutenant Colonel Sidney Bleechmore was placed in charge, and was given the 7th and 2/14th Field Companies and a section of the 2/1st Mechanical Equipment Company. Work commenced on 19 August. Removing the trees allowed the sun to dry out the ground, and by adding drainage, a track was created passable by light vehicles, allowing plant and equipment to be brought up. Owers' Corner was reached in early September. At this point the route Owers surveyed departed from the mule track. The track descended down the ridge on a grade too steep for motor vehicles, so the road then proceeded along the ridge line. The 7th Field Company then encountered of rock, which had to be drilled and blasted. The jeep track was abandoned at this point, but work continued on a mule track, which was advanced about per day until mid-September, when the engineer units were withdrawn to Port Moresby due to the deteriorating tactical situation, with the Japanese closing in on Ioribaiwa. Work resumed on 28 September, but was abandoned in early October. Units working on the road were supplied by pack transport. Improvements to the road allowed 3-ton trucks to reach Owers' Corner on 28 September. The jeeps were then moved to a new line of communications running from Itiki through Subitana. The 1st Independent Light Horse Troop was a small mounted unit consisting of one officer and twenty other ranks. It was raised at Koitaki on 1 April 1942, using the horses from the station there. It was originally engaged in patrolling and locating crashed aircraft around Port Moresby, but on 26 June it was assigned to the pack transport role on the Kokoda Track. A remount sub section of six men impressed mules, horses and pack saddlery from the plantations around Sogeri, and rounded up and broke brumbies from the Bootless Inlet area.[Transport, Pack ‚Äì General:] Report on work of Pack Transport Kokoda, Line of Communication Area ‚Äì 1942, 31 December 1942, Australian War Memorial, Canberra, AWM54 957/1/1 It was found that the mules were best-suited for the task, with the brumbies next. Because the tracks were narrow, they trained the animals to walk in single file, led by a mounted rider at the front and trailed by one at the rear of the column. Each animal carried of stores, which were packed in bags to facilitate their transfer to Papuan carriers. The Goldie River was bridged on 2 July, and the mule track was extended to Uberi. Pack transport hauled of supplies in June, between 3 and 16 July, between 17 July and 16 August, and between 17 and 29 August. Men leading pack horses and mules loaded with supplies down the precipitous curving track from the end of the road down into the Uberi Valley. In the foreground is a 25-pounder gun that is being man-hauled through the valley to Imita Ridge. The steep descent near Owers' Corner to the Goldie River crossing at Uberi involved a steep ascent for the animals on the return trip. The 2/6th Field Company constructed a flying fox, which went into operation on 26 September. Descending , it was long, with an intermediate station. The empty tackle was returned by the weight of the cargo, which was up to . In late August, the 1st Light Horse Troop was reorganised as a pack transport section, with six sub sections. One prepared the loads, weighing them to ensure that there was on each side. The other five were each under the command of a non-commissioned officer, with five other ranks, three riding horses and ten to twelve pack horses or mules. With a call for more supplies to be delivered, the remount unit was recalled, and 29 other ranks were added from the 55th Infantry Battalion in September, bringing the total strength to one officer, 81 other ranks, 39 mules and 63 horses, and allowing four more sub sections to be formed. The 1st Independent Light Horse Troop struggled with epidemics of strangles and infectious nasal catarrh among horses imported from Australia, and the saddlery became increasingly worn until 60 new saddles arrived from Australia in September. Meanwhile, the 1st Pack Transport Company was formed at Royal Park in Melbourne on 25 August. It had entrained for Queensland on 25 September, and arrived in Port Moresby on 7 October. In late October it began relieving the 1st Light Horse Troop.War Diary, 1st Pack Transport Company, Australian War Memorial, Canberra, AWM52 10/13/1 By the end of October, the 1st Pack Transport Company had one officer and 110 other ranks with 43 mules and 135 horses working on the track. The 1st Light Horse Troop was relieved on 5 November, and was reorganised as the New Guinea Force Pack Transport Company. It was later renamed the 7th Pack Transport Company. In all, some of supplies were moved forward of the jeephead by animal transport. The acting Commander, 7th Division Australian Army Service Corps (AASC), Lieutenant Colonel Gordon Richardson,War Diary, AASC 7th Division, Australian War Memorial, Canberra, AWM52 10/2/2 assumed control of logistics on the track on 10 September. Supplies were then brought from the Base Supply Depots at Sogeri and Ilolo to Newton's Depot in 3-ton trucks by the 2/5th AASC Company. The 2/4th AASC Company moved them by jeep to the roadhead at Owers' Corner. The flying fox was used to take them to the floor of the Goldie River Valley, from whence the 1st Independent Light Horse Troop carried them to Uberi. From there, they were carried on the backs of Papuan porters, known as carriers. If there were more stores than the animals could carry, they would assist with that too. Since the number of pack animals and carriers was limited, the requirements for stores and supplies of all types, including rations, ammunition, ordnance, signals equipment and medical supplies, were submitted to 7th Division headquarters, which allocated movement priorities. One of Richardson's first actions was to obtain more saddlery for the pack horses. He also acquired five more American jeeps to augment the five that had been working the jeep track. The original five were found to be in poor condition, and needed overhaul. While the 25th Infantry Brigade was conducting operations in the Imita Ridge area, the carry was short, and despite the fact that there were no suitable air dropping zones, the supply situation was good. As the Australians began advancing toward Kokoda again in October, the supply line became steadily longer, and the demand for carriers more acute. From Uberi, the track ran to Ioribaiwa. The first involved a gruelling climb. Sappers cut steps to create what became known as the \\"Golden Stairs\\". In many ways this made it harder, as it forced the walker to lift his feet higher. This was especially so for the Papuans who were the most frequent users of the track, and who were not used to stairs. The technique would not be used in 1943. The Papuan carriers moved supplies forward from Uberi, often under arduous conditions. The pre-war plantation economy of the Australian territories of Papua and New Guinea was based on a system of indentured labour. On 15 June 1942, Morris issued the Employment of Natives Order under the National Security (Emergency Control) Regulations. This provided for the conscription of Papuan labour to support the Australian war effort. About 800 Papuan civilians were working in the Port Moresby area in April 1942. Responding to increasing calls for carriers, ANGAU conscripted 2,033 Papuans in June, 3,354 in July, and 4,947 in August. On 9 October, ANGAU was maintaining 9,270 Papuan workers. Casting such a wide net created problems. Although all spoke Motuan, the prevalence of different dialects meant that they could not all communicate with one another. ANGAU representatives sorted them into groups who spoke the same dialect. Taking away so many able-bodied men caused hardship for their families and villages, as jobs they normally performed went undone, and food production fell away. However, atrocities committed by the Japanese against Papuan and New Guinea civilians proved a persuasive recruiting tool. Papuan carriers in Australian service crossing a river between Nauro and Menari in October 1942 A carrier could carry about 13 days' worth of food, and traversing the track took eight days. A carrier load was assessed at , but the water-logged wrapping caused it to weigh more. Since the carriers could not carry more, ANGAU had to take this into account when preparing the loads. The initial movement of the 39th Infantry Battalion to Kokoda was supported by 600 carriers under Lieutenant H. T. (Bert) Kienzle from ANGAU. Along the track, Kienzle and Sergeant Major Maga of the Royal Papuan Constabulary established way stations, which they stocked with food gathered locally, and were manned by ANGAU, who were responsible for both the carriers and the stores. The 39th Infantry Battalion was able to travel light because it did not have to carry heavy stores or equipment. Morris arranged for an old Thursday Island schooner, the Gili Gili, to take of stores and equipment by sea. These included Vickers machine guns and Lewis guns. Gili Gili departed Port Moresby on 4 July, and arrived at Buna on 19 July. Captain Thomas Grahamslaw, the local ANGAU District Officer, arranged for 1,500 carriers to take the stores to Kokoda.War Diary, 39th Infantry Battalion, Australian War Memorial, Canberra, AWM52 8/3/78 The Allied retreat from Kokoda in August and September was a trying time for the carriers, who were pushed to their limit, hauling supplies up to the front, and then carrying the wounded back. Not only did it take eight men to move each casualty, but they were far slower, taking three times as long to traverse the track. It was intended that there would be separate carrier lines for supply and casualty evacuation, but this could not be adhered to. Each non-walking casualty meant three fewer bundles of supplies delivered per day for each carrier employed evacuating wounded. By 30 August, all the carriers had been drafted into evacuating the wounded except those reserved for carrying the 3-inch mortars. The retreat and the sight of the wounded depressed the morale of the carriers, who repeatedly asked Kienzle why the Australians could not defeat the Japanese. On 13 September, there were 310 carriers working in the forward area, and 860 at Uberi.[Owen Stanleys ‚Äì Operations:] \\"Report on Kokoda L of C native carriers during Campaign Owen Stanley Range, Kokoda, Gona, Buna\\" (Abbrev), by Capt H T Kienzle ANGAU (February 1943), Australian War Memorial, Canberra, AWM54 577/6/8 Overwork and illness took its toll on them. Captain Geoffrey (Doc) Vernon, a deaf veteran of the Great War, was sent by ANGAU as medical officer for the carriers. He was greatly disturbed at what he saw in August: Newspaper reports, photographs, and newsreel films soon appeared of Papuan carriers tending to Australian wounded while struggling over towering mountains and across raging torrents of rivers. This produced an outpouring of gratitude among the civilian population in Australia, who called them \\"Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels\\"; it would affect the way that Australians viewed their neighbour for many decades to come. =Air supply= The first air transport unit in SWPA was the Air Transport Command, a United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) unit which was formed at RAAF Base Amberley in Queensland on 28 January 1942. It was equipped with five C-53s originally bound for the Philippines, and two B-18s and a C-39 that had escaped from there. Only two of the original 14 pilots were fully qualified on transports; the rest had to be retrained. Of the 19 airmen, 12 were trained as aircrew members. It was redesignated the US 21st Transport Squadron on 3 April. On the same date, the US 22nd Transport Squadron was formed at Essendon Airport in Victoria with former Royal Netherlands Indies Airways (KNILM) and Royal Netherlands East Indies Army Air Force (RNEIAAF) aircraft that had arrived in Australia from Java. The two squadrons were redesignated the 21st and 22nd Troop Carrier Squadrons on 26 July. Dropping food supplies on a cleared space at Nauro village during the advance of the 25th Infantry Brigade over the Owen Stanley Range On 21 May, the 21st Transport Squadron had a B-18, two C-39s, a C-47, three C-53s, two ex-KNILM DC-2s, two ex-KNILM DC-3s, three ex-KNILM DC-5s, two ex-KNILM L14s, and three O-47s. The 22nd Transport Squadron had a B-17, two C-39s, a C-47, a B-18, an ex-KNILM L-14, and eleven ex-RNEIAAF C-56s. The 21st Transport Squadron flew its first mission in New Guinea on 22 May, flying from Port Moresby to Wau and Bulolo with supplies for Kanga Force, the small Australian garrison there. Thereafter missions were frequently flown; but the two squadrons were still based in Queensland, not Port Moresby, and would not relocate there until the following year. The RAAF formed four transport squadrons in February and March 1942, and No. 33 Squadron RAAF began flying a regular passenger and freight service from Townsville to Port Moresby on 5 March. It received Avro Ansons in September and a detachment was sent to Port Moresby the following month. Aircraft of No. 36 Squadron RAAF also made occasional trips to New Guinea in 1942, and twenty RAAF pilots were seconded to US troop carrier squadrons. The difficulties of operating in New Guinea soon became apparent. Two attempts to reach Wau on 23 May 1942 failed due to bad weather. On 26 May, five transports were flying to Wau when they were attacked by 16 Mitsubishi A6M Zeroes, which were engaged by the escorting P-39s of the 35th, 36th and 39th Fighter Squadrons. The transports delivered their loads successfully, but one P-39 was lost. The transports always took off in daylight; weather reports were not available before dawn, and the fighter escort could not operate in darkness. Weather was a constant hazard over the Owen Stanley Range, and clouds could build up faster than an aircraft could climb. Poor flying weather, either over Port Moresby or over the target, could ground the transports for a week or more at a time. Weather and rough airstrips increased the amount of maintenance required to keep the planes flying. So too did the climate. The high humidity encouraged the growth of fungus which shorted out electrical components; metal surfaces were subject to corrosion; and lubrication oils evaporated in the high temperatures. Critical spare parts were often out of stock, and their delivery was an important role of the intra-theatre air transport. Availability did not just mean the transports; there was also the fighter escorts, which were normally based at another field. If they could not fly, or were required for another mission, then the transports could not fly.\\"[Transport, Air ‚Äì Supplies and Equipment:] Australian Army Service Corps ‚Äì Supplies by air ‚Äì Notes on the growth of maintenance by Air Transport, Report on New Guinea Campaign\\", 31 December 1942, Australian War Memorial, Canberra, AWM54 964/2/6 For planning purposes, a C-39 planeload was reckoned at with of fuel, while that of the larger C-53 was reckoned at with of fuel; but loading charts were not available in 1942, and aircraft were sometimes overloaded. The first air transport mission to the Kokoda front was flown on 26 July, when a DC-3 from the 21st Troop Carrier Squadron landed 15 troops of the 39th Infantry Battalion and some stores. A C-53 followed that afternoon with another 15 men and some stores. reports that the reinforcement was made by a single plane in two flights; however, identifies it was flown by two different planes of different types and is able to identify them by type. reports that there were only two transports at Port Moresby at the time, having just arrived from Australia, and one of these was declared unserviceable on arrival with engine problems. The flight time to Kokoda was about twenty minutes. An air supply run the following day by a C-53 and a DC-2 found the airstrip barricaded. The barricades were removed, but the aircraft were recalled by a radio message that the Kokoda Drome could not be held. The loss of the airstrip meant a switch to air dropping supplies. An aircraft was sent that afternoon, but was recalled. On 28 July, a DC-5, a DC-3 and a DC-2 dropped supplies near Kokoda. Three transports dropped supplies near Kagi on 29 July, and one on 30 July. No more missions were flown until 6 August. Morris formed a good working relationship with the air commander in New Guinea, Brigadier General Martin F. Scanlon, but in early August Scanlon was replaced by Brigadier General Ennis C. Whitehead, who sent the two DC-3-type transport aircraft back to Australia. By 18 August, some of vital supplies had piled up in Townsville, awaiting air transport to Port Moresby. This left only a single DC-2 at Port Moresby; a Lodestar arrived on 8 August.[Transport, Air ‚Äì Organization:] File of messages and correspondence dealing with air transport in New Guinea ‚Äì 1942, Australian War Memorial, Canberra, AWM54 964/4/2 An urgent message from Morris to Advance LHQ resulted in GHQ despatching four DC-3-type aircraft to Port Moresby. Advance LHQ reminded New Guinea Force of the procedure for requesting transport aircraft, to which Colonel Frederck Chilton, the GSO1 at New Guinea Force HQ, protested that it was \\"too slow and has already cost us Kokoda\\".War Diary, New Guinea Force, HQ and G(Air), Australian War Memorial, Canberra, AWM52 1/5/51 A DC-2 is loaded with supplies for the troops at Kokoda on 19 August 1942 Techniques for air dropping had yet to be developed. Following the loss of the airstrip at Kokoda, the AAF concluded that the only way to get supplies to A Company, 39th Infantry Battalion in the Kokoda area was to adopt a suggestion from the Army to put them in fighter drop tanks. The tanks were slit, along the bottom, and they were filled with supplies. The first attempt on 11 August was called off due to bad weather, but four fighters dropped a total of on 12 August. By then it was too late; the area was in Japanese hands. A forward supply dump was established at Myola, in a dry lake bed that Kienzle found on 3 August. The lake bed was flat and treeless, making it a good candidate for a supply drop zone. Several days of good weather after 9 August allowed the transport aircraft to concentrate on dropping at Myola. When he assumed command, Rowell was informed that 25 days' supply of food and ammunition for 2,000 men was stored there, but on checking it was found that there were only four days' rations, with two days' reserves held forward of Myola. The official historian, Dudley McCarthy, suggested that \\"the rations were never dropped at all, and that the explanation lay in faulty work by an inexperienced staff\\". In his memoirs, Rowell maintained that the missing rations had been sent, and must have fallen outside the target area. On 21 August, Kienzle discovered a second, much larger, dry lake bed at Myola. The two lake beds came to be called Myola1 and2, but the maps issued to air crews showed only one. Drops may have been made at the wrong one. But there are other explanations for the missing rations. The inexperienced New Guinea Force staff assumed that the supplies they despatched would arrive, but this was far from the case with air dropping, the techniques for which had yet to be properly developed. Kienzle picked what he thought were good drop zones, but the air crews sometimes found them restricted or dangerous. The aircraft had to fly low over the drop zone, at about , and slow, at about . They had to take the wind into account, as it might cause parachuted packages to miss the drop zone. The load would be placed in the doorway, and three or four men would push it out when the pilot gave the signal. The pilot would fly level or with the nose slightly down, so that cargo would not hit the tail of the aircraft. The pilot would retract the landing gear if it was down, and climb to gain altitude. Multiple passes over the drop zone might be required. Heavy loads were not practical for air dropping missions, since the aircraft had to arrive low and slow over the drop zone, but higher speed was required for greater weight. Nor could an overloaded aircraft climb or dive quickly. The 21st and 22nd Troop Carrier Squadrons were still based in Queensland and not at Port Moresby, so the aircrew were there on short rotations. Their learning process was therefore fitful and slow. Men from various Army and RAAF units assisted the aircrew in the task of pushing stores out of the aircraft. Packaging was primitive and inadequate in 1942, even for normal handling under New Guinea conditions. Cardboard boxes disintegrated, cans rusted, and wooden boxes rotted or were eaten by insects. Parachutes for air dropping were in short supply. Orders for parachutes were placed in Australia, the United States and India. A request for 5,000 cargo parachutes with containers was made to Washington on 21 July. On 22 September it was decided to send 1,000 without containers by air, while the rest went by sea. Due to the shortage of parachutes, most supplies had to be \\"free-dropped\\"‚Äîdropped without parachutes‚Äîso the rate of breakage was high. As the contents of the packaging usually burst, they were encased in two or more sacks, the outer being much larger than the inner, so it could contain the contents when the inner burst, and prevent them from scattering. Three layers was found necessary. Items such as sacks and blankets were preferred as packaging, as these were useful to the troops. About 12,000 blankets were used in the five weeks up to 12 October. The earlier adoption of blankets as packaging would not only have saved supplies from breakage, but would also have increased the volume of supplies delivered over the track, as thousands of blankets were sent by carrier. Without a well-organised effort, less than half of what was dropped was recovered with perhaps 70 per cent of that still usable. Loading a plane with ammunition wrapped in blankets in December 1942. General Sir Thomas Blamey talks to the loaders. On 16 August, Whitehead promised to deliver of ammunition, of rations and of supplies, a total of , to Maroubra Force daily to maintain three battalions in the Kokoda area; but the following day there was a disastrous air raid on Jackson Drome. A large force of Japanese 25 Mitsubishi G4M (Betty) bombers escorted by 22 Zero fighters reached Port Moresby undetected. No air raid warning was sounded and no fighters took off to intercept before the attack. They caught ten Martin B-26 Marauders of the 22nd Bombardment Group on the ground armed and fuelled. Four were destroyed, as were three transports of the 21st and 22nd Troop Carrier Squadrons, a DC-5 and two C-56s. Another eight aircraft were badly damaged: four B-26s, a C-39, a C-49 and two C-53s. The two C-53s were patched up and flown back to Australia for more extensive repairs.There is some variation in the type and number of planes damaged or destroyed. See also: , , , and Rowell pressed Blamey for more aircraft. He wanted to build up 20 days' reserves over and above Maroubra Force's daily requirement of , which would require the movement of another of stores and ammunition. Even spread over 20 days, this would require an additional 2,000 carriers. Blamey went to MacArthur, who arranged for six A-24 Dauntless dive bombers, a B-17 and two transports to be made available. MacArthur reminded Blamey that: MacArthur and Kenney did prevail on Washington to provide more troop carrier aircraft. In July, SWPA was given a high priority for transport aircraft, with six additional squadrons earmarked to bring it up to two groups. They were scheduled to arrive in November and December, but their movement was expedited, and the first new squadron, the 6th Troop Carrier Squadron, reached Port Moresby on 14 October. Part of the 33rd Troop Carrier Squadron was held up in the South Pacific Area, which also had urgent needs. In the meantime, ten DC-3s were converted into C-49s and C-50s at the Sacramento Air Depot and flown out to Australia, where they were allocated to the 21st Troop Carrier Squadron in September. Ten C-60 Lodestars were also despatched, which joined the 22nd Troop Carrier Squadron. When the 17 August raid occurred, two battalions of the 21st Infantry Brigade under Brigadier Arnold Potts were moving forward to retake Kokoda and prepare for operations to recapture Buna. Upon being informed by Potts that only 10,000 instead of the anticipated 40,000 rations were at Myola, Rowell took immediate steps to ease the supply situation. He held back the third battalion of Potts' brigade, the 2/27th Infantry Battalion, and ordered Allen to return the 39th Infantry Battalion to Port Moresby. Kienzle had 933 Papuans working between Myola and Isurava. Not all were carriers; some collected supplies from the drop area, and others were engaged in other work, such as building huts and shelters. Rowell turned down a request from Potts for 800 more carriers to move supplies forward from Myola, allowing him only another 300 from the Port Moresby-Myola carrier line until stocks at Myola were built up. Potts' role was to be a defensive one until then, and the 2/14th and 2/16th were to remain in the Myola area. On 23 August, an aircraft dropped rations, medical supplies, two 3-inch mortars and 120 mortar bombs. Another four loads were dropped the following day before clouds closed in over Myola. Allen reported that 5,000 emergency rations and 1,500 balanced rations had been dropped, along with of biscuits and of other ration components, and 21,000 quinine tablets. Some 237,000 rounds of .303 ammunition for the rifles, 140,000 rounds of .45 for the Thompson submachine guns, and 1,050 hand grenades had been sent to Myola. The Japanese landing at Milne Bay on 25 August caused Allen to retain the 2/27th Infantry Battalion in the Port Moresby area in case of a seaborne attack, and he ordered Potts to expedite the return of the 39th Infantry Battalion. As late as 25 August, Potts still intended to recapture Kokoda with the 2/14th, but his plans were overtaken by events. The Japanese attacked at Isurava, and although his force, which still included the 39th Battalion, slightly outnumbered the Japanese, Potts was defeated. Myola was lost on 5 September, along with 10,000 rations. In his report, Potts noted that due to the delay caused by the shortage of supplies at Myola, \\"at no time were the 2/14th and 2/16th Australian Infantry Battalions ever intact and available for a concerted operation, wholly and solely due to delays occasioned by supply\\". From 16 September, the AASC officer at each depot reported the stock levels at 18:00 each day. Demands for supplies were forwarded from the Q Branch at New Guinea Force headquarters to the Deputy Director of Supplies and Transport. This was matched up with the number and type of available aircraft. Trucks drew the stores from the depots, where they were packaged and prepared for dropping, and took them to the aerodrome, usually Jackson or Kila. As time went by, standard load lists were developed. Packages of rations were \\"balanced\\"‚Äìarranged so they contained a complete set of commodities‚Äîso that the loss of some packages would not result in surpluses of one commodity and shortages of another. One truck was allocated to each plane, plus one additional truck in case another aircraft became available. Each plane would be loaded with the contents of one truck. Planes might return with some or all of their load, or not take off at all. At the end of the day, stores remaining on aircraft would be loaded back onto the trucks, and would be returned to the depots. Some were despatched by air supply in August, in September, and in October.[Owen Stanleys ‚Äì Reports:] Reports on operations in the Owen Stanleys, Buna, Gona area: Serial 10 ‚Äì \\"Supplies by Air Transport ‚Äì Report by S&T; Service\\" [Part 9 of 25], Australian War Memorial, Canberra, AWM52 577/7/29 Part 9 New drop zones were developed around Efogi, Nauro and Manari. Myola was recaptured on 14 October, and Myola1 and2 were developed as drop zones. Medical support A Papuan assists Private Jerry Cronin to cross a creek after Cronin had been wounded in a clash against the Japanese. The first medical unit to arrive was the 3rd Field Ambulance, which left Adelaide on 25 December 1941, and moved into the Murray Barracks in Port Moresby on 3 January 1942. The base hospital became the 46th Camp Hospital, and moved to King's Hollow, a site on the Laloki River from Port Moresby. A Red Cross convalescent home at Rouna became the 113th Convalescent Depot. On 3 June the hospital ship brought the 14th Field Ambulance and the 5th Casualty Clearing Station. The 2/9th General Hospital arrived from South Australia on the hospital ship Manunda on 23 August. It moved to a site at Rouna, from Port Moresby. It was the only general hospital in New Guinea until the 2/5th General Hospital arrived in January 1943. Due to the prospect that Port Moresby might fall, it was sent without its nurses or Australian Army Medical Women's Service physiotherapists. Staffed as a 600-bed hospital, it held 732 patients on 6 October. Its commanding officer, Colonel A. H. Green, suggested that it be expanded to a 1,200-bed hospital, or that another 600-bed hospital be sent from Australia. Authorisation was given to expand to 800 beds on 29 September, and the nurses and physiotherapists were sent. Between when it opened in September and the end of December, the 2/9th General Hospital admitted 10,083 patients. Malaria was a concern, as it was endemic in New Guinea. There was no plasmoquine to cure it, and the main drug used to combat it was quinine, which was not fully effective. The recommended dosage of per day was found to be insufficient to give protection against the disease in highly malarious areas. Quinine was also in short supply, as Java, which had been overrun by the Japanese, accounted for 90 per cent of the world's supply. Moreover, many failed to take the required dose with regularity, insect repellents were not available or not used, protective clothing was not issued to all the troops, and some still went around at night in short sleeves and shorts. Colonel Neil Hamilton Fairley, the Australian Army's Director of Medicine, and Major Ian Murray Mackerras visited Port Moresby in June 1942. Both were experts on tropical medicine. They noted that the garrison had suffered 1,184 cases of malaria, an infection rate of 149 per thousand. They recommended that to conserve quinine, men could be taken off it during the dry season, and observed for relapses. Fortunately, the climate in the Owen Stanley Range was not favourable to mosquitoes, and most cases were relapses by men infected in Port Moresby or Syria. Potts therefore decided on 24 August that anti-malarial precautions were no longer necessary. An epidemic of dysentery broke out on the Kokoda Track that threatened the entire force. Some 1,200 casualties, mostly dysentery, reached Ilolo in September. Simple hygiene procedures involving the disposal of rubbish and excrement were required, but were neglected in the early stages of the campaign. Lieutenant Colonel Edward Ford, the Assistant Director of Pathology at New Guinea Force headquarters, arranged for supplies of a new drug, sulphaguanidine, to be shipped from Australia. The widespread use of a scarce drug was a gamble, as it used up all the stocks in Australia, but one that paid off; it arrested the epidemic, and allowed sick men to travel, thereby saving lives. When the Australians advanced on Kokoda in October, special details constructed latrines, buried the dead, and, in extreme cases, burned villages that the Japanese had fouled beyond redemption. Scrub typhus is spread by mites that live in the soil. Soldiers walking through mite-infested areas were fairly safe, but if they sat or lay down or stood still for long enough, the mites could attach themselves. Although the incidence of typhus was much less than that of malaria or dysentery, it was more lethal. Of 2,839 Australian servicemen affected in SWPA, 9.05% died. Scrub itch, a skin irritation caused by mite bites, was a more common but far less serious ailment. Tinea was also a problem, due to the inability of men to keep their clothes or boots dry, or to wash them. A shortage of fresh fruit and vegetables caused vitamin- deficiency-related problems. To save weight and simplify the distribution of rations, the 7th Division staff cut back the number of commodities in the ration from thirteen (bully beef, biscuits, tea, sugar, salt, dried fruit, jam, butter, milk, cheese, tinned fruit, tinned vegetables and bacon) to just the first six. Inevitably, both the troops and the carriers began to suffer from vitamin deficiencies as well as exhaustion and illness. To supplement the carriers' vitamin B intake, marmite was air dropped for them, but only was available. A Stinson L-1 Vigilant air ambulance operating at Kokoda, November 1942. The aircraft is evacuating two sick or wounded Australian soldiers to Port Moresby from the Main Dressing Station (MDS) of the 2/4th Field Ambulance near the airstrip. Major J. R. Magarey, the Senior Medical Officer of the 2/6th Field Ambulance, initially instituted an unusual casualty evacuation plan, under which casualties were evacuated forward instead of rearward, as Potts expected to be able to recapture the airstrip at Kokoda, which would allow casualties to be flown out. In forward areas where the carriers could not go, the men of the Papuan Infantry Battalion pitched in, making four teams of stretcher bearers available. During Potts' retreat to Ioribaiwa, casualty evacuation had to be along the track. Medical care was available at each way station. Magarey recalled that: War correspondent Osmar White saw wounded men on the track: Those with more serious injuries had to be carried down the track. The usual decision as to whether it was safe to move someone was simplified by the Japanese, who killed all the wounded they encountered. Only those near death were abandoned. Casualties were held at the aid posts and dressing stations until they could walk, or the Japanese threatened. It took eight or ten Papuan carriers to move each man. Army stretchers rotted and fell apart; the Papuans improvised stretchers from blankets, copra bags and timber cut along the track. The pace of the withdrawal was dictated by the rate at which casualties could be evacuated. When Myola was recaptured in October, a Main Dressing Station (MDS) was established there, manned by the 2/4th Field Ambulance and a surgical team from the 2/9th General Hospital. On 1 November, 438 patients were held at Myola. Three days later, Kokoda was back in Australian hands and an MDS established there. It was hoped that aircraft could land at Myola and evacuate the sick and wounded, but Myola was above sea level, and the pilots reported that a fully loaded aircraft would not be able to take off or land at that altitude, and would have trouble clearing the surrounding hills. Risking the precious transports seemed inadvisable. Five light aircraft were made available: three Stinson L-1 Vigilants, a De Havilland DH.50, and a Ford Trimotor. Two Stinsons evacuated 35 patients, and the Ford another eight from Myola, but the Ford and a Stinson crashed while attempting to land at the Port Moresby end of the lake bed, which had become soft after recent rains, on 22 and 24 November respectively. Over time, more than 200 patients recovered sufficiently to return to their units. Walking wounded were sent down the track, while those unable to walk were carried to Kokoda by Papuan carriers, and flown out from there. The last seven walking cases left for Ilolo on 16 December, and the last four stretcher cases for Kokoda on 18 December; the MDS at Myola closed the following day.War Diary, 2/6th Field Ambulance, Australian War Memorial, Canberra, AWM52 11/12/15 Outcome The Australian Army had entered the Second World War with inadequate resources due to severe cutbacks at the hands of conservative governments in the 1920s and 1930s. This was compounded by a lack of interest and appreciation of logistics on the part of its civilian and military leadership. There was an assumption that the Australian Army would form part of an expeditionary force that would fight overseas in a larger British force. This was indeed the case in the Great War, and again in the Second World War in the Middle East and Malaya, but not in SWPA, where the Australian Army had to provide not only its own logistic support but its Allies' as well. In an environment where motor transport could not operate, the Australian Army was forced to rely on air transport and native carriers, two modes of transportation that it had never used before. The Australian Army had many lessons to learn, but it proved capable of adapting to the circumstances it found itself in. The fighting along the Kokoda Track was but the start of the effort to drive the Japanese from New Guinea that would continue in 1943.

Those who use the term are implying that Gutmenschen have an overwhelming wish to be good and eagerly seek approval. Further suggesting a supposed moralising and proselytising behaviour and being dogmatic. In political rhetoric Gutmensch is used as a polemic term. Context Users of the term believe that people or groups of people with a specific moral attitude show a wrong or problematic behaviour.Clemens Knobloch: Moralisierung und Sachzwang. Politische Kommunikation in der Massendemokratie. Duisburg 1998 (k√ºnftig: Knobloch: Moralisierung). Therefore, it was used as a popular term in the 1980s for people who valued humanistic, altruistic, but also religious and human goals in life higher than utilitarian ones. They organise their actions, politics as well as their lives accordingly. The term Gutmensch is also connected to the term political correctness and has been used in a derogatory manner since the mid 1990s. In general language use it is always used as a negatively connoted foreign appellation. A use that is meant in \\"a nice way\\" can often be found only in face-to-face conversations, such as the saying \\"to have a heart of gold\\", in generosity or in an extreme form of altruism.Katrin Auer: \\"'Political Correctness' ‚Äì Ideologischer Code, Feindbild und Stigmawort der Rechten.\\" (PDF; 103 kB). In: √ñsterreichische Zeitschrift f√ºr Politikwissenschaft. Volume 31, Nr. 3, 2002, pp. 291‚Äì303, especially p. 294; further: Knobloch: Moralisierung; Gesa von Leesen: \\"'Das sagt man nicht!' Political Correctness zwischen Moral und Kampfbegriff\\". In: Das Parlament. 1 February 2007. The term also hints at the possible difference between \\"meant well\\" and \\"well done\\". Gutmenschen have good intentions, want to solve specific problems or have the desire to create a better world. Those who use the term Gutmensch in a negative way evaluate the actions of Gutmenschen as not appropriate or unnecessary. This is how the term is used in everyday language. The German dictionary Duden, which included the term in 2000, defines Gutmensch as \\"a naive person who acts in an uncritical, exaggerated or tedious way while fighting for political correctness.\\" in duden.de, accessed 24 February 2012.  Origins and use  According to researcher Rembert H√ºser, the term Gutmensch was coined as a joke made by German feuilleton writers of the \\"generation 1989\\", such as and Klaus Bittermann. They were among the authors of dictionaries opposing the protests of 1968. These dictionaries were written in the style of Eckardt Henscheids Dummdeutsch dictionary (dealing with language criticism) and can be considered a combination of popular and political literature. They did not differentiate between the meaning of a word and how it is used. Bittermann explains in his epilogue of the W√∂rterbuch des Gutmenschen (dictionary of the Gutmensch): Since the mid 1990s, Gutmensch has been used alongside political correctnessZ. B. von Reinhard G√ºnzel, siehe dort. in political and ideological debates, in order to degrade political opponents as over-moralizing.Cf. Auer: \\"Political Correctness\\", p. 294; Brigitta Huhnke: \\"'political correctness' ‚Äì ein Mantra nationaler Erweckung\\". In: ZAG 30, 1999 (also in: ZAG Online); Brigitta Huhnke: \\"'pc' ‚Äì Das neue Mantra der Neokonservativen\\". In: Andreas Disselnk√∂tter u. a. (eds.): Evidenzen im Flu√ü. Demokratieverluste in Deutschland. Duisburg 1997. Former Merkur publisher Kurt Scheel once claimed to have used the term first in that sense.Letter to the editor by Karl Scheel in the Frankfurter Rundschau, 19 November 1997.Dieter Herberg u. a.: Neuer Wortschatz: Neologismen der 90er Jahre im Deutschen. Berlin 2004, pp. 148 ff Gutmensch was considered the \\"latest critical chic\\" in the art sections of newspapers. Writers like Klaus Bittermann came up with a variety of neologisms referring to PC and accompanying the appearance of Gutmensch. Some of them can roughly be translated as Gutmensch language, bleeding-heart language, attitudinal kitsch, attitudinal language or chatter jargon. In 2006, the German Journalists Association (DJV) claimed that the term Gutmensch had its origins in Nazi Germany. Following that claim, the association planned on including the term in a handbook on the sensitive use of language for journalists, which they wanted to publish in cooperation with the Duisburg Institute of Language and Social Studies.J√ºrgen Hoppe/Deutscher Journalisten-Verband: , 27 March 2006 (accessed 26 October 2007; PDF; 27 kB). However, some time later the Institute explicitly objected to that claim made by the DJV. Having conducted their own research on this topic, the Institute concluded that there was no clear connection between Gutmensch and Nazi Germany.DISS-Journal des Duisburger Instituts f√ºr Sprach- und Sozialforschung Nevertheless, in a pre-published sample of the above-mentioned handbook, it was stated that Gutmensch had been introduced by the Nazis to refer to followers of Cardinal von Galen, who had openly opposed the Nazi programme of forced euthanasia. According to the DJV, Gutmensch was derived from the Yiddish expression \\"a gutt Mensch\\" (a good human). Furthermore, they indicated that it was Adolf Hitler, who in his book Mein Kampf had repeatedly used the prefix \\"gut\\" (good) in a derogatory way, so as to accuse people who expressed goodwill and good-heartedness of collaborating with the German enemies.Cf. Adolf Hitler: Mein Kampf. There \\"well-meaning\\" is often a synonym for \\"Jews\\", but also for Germans who were ambivalent about the National Socialist \\"movement\\". As in the case of Nietzsche, however, no use of the word \\"Gutmensch\\" could be documented here. Another widespread opinion on the origin of Gutmensch is that it was coined by Friedrich Nietzsche. There are numerous disparaging remarks in Nietzsche's writings concerning the \\"good human\\", albeit not as a fixed expression. The Association for the German Language mentions as their first source a 1985 edition of Forbes magazine, in which Franz Steink√ºhler, at that time co- chairman of Germany's biggest metalworker's union, is called a Gutmensch.Gesellschaft f√ºr Deutsche Sprache zum ersten Aufscheinen des Begriffs im Deutschen: Fragen und Antworten: Gutmensch. A more positive link may be Bertolt Brecht's play The Good Person of Szechwan () whose main theme is the difficulty of acting good in a world that is not good.Theaterbremen: Der gute Mensch von Sezuan (accessed 2 January 2017) Die Welt journalist Matthias Heine brings into play German pedagogical scientist Christian Oeser, who may have invented the term. In Oeser's book Letters to a Maiden on the most fundamental Topics of Aesthetics, published in 1859, he writes about naive Gutmenschen as follows: \\"Isn't it clear that in the end, such a gullible Gutmensch will be laughed at for his unconditional love towards humans, that the whole world will call him a fool and that he will eventually fall prey to his own weakness?\\" Similar terms can be found in other languages as well, for example the Italian buonismo, with meanings all referring to the Gutmensch. =In areas critical of society= Occasionally, people who see themselves as critics of society ironically condemn would-be campaigners who criticize society without applying the same criteria to themselves. The term Gutmensch sees criticism of racism as symbolic when the speakers own racist behaviour is not reflected. That kind of criticism means that political utterances which don‚Äôt demand consequences are only made to allow the speaker to appear in a good light. Sunday speeches of politicians will be especially criticized if they pretend to be advocates for \\"victims\\". People who are concerned determinedly reject being locked into a role as victim.Siehe Susan Arndt: Wei√üsein. Die verkannte Strukturkategorie Europas und Deutschlands und Mythen des wei√üen Subjekts: Verleugnung und Hierarchisierung von Rassismus. In: Maureen Maisha Eggers u. a. (Hrsg.): Mythen, Masken und Subjekte. Kritische Wei√üseinsforschung in Deutschland. M√ºnster 2005, pp. 24‚Äì29 and p. 340‚Äì362. The \\"friend of foreigners\\", having good intentions, is a specific example. According to humanistic approaches, they think everyone is equal, but foreigners impose their \\"own needs, ethical and moral ideas and goals\\" on him (jemandem etwas aufzwingen, aufdr√§ngen) Sabine Forschner).See also Susan Arndt: \\"Mythen des wei√üen Subjekts: Verleugnung und Hierarchisierung von Rassismus\\". In: Maureen Maisha Eggers u. a. (eds.): Mythen, Masken und Subjekte. Kritische Wei√üseinsforschung in Deutschland. M√ºnster 2005, pp. 340‚Äì362 On 11 August 2014, Norbert Bolz (TU Berlin), an academic in media and communication, said on radio station Deutschlandfunk: In political debates The term is used with a different purpose and frequency in the overall political spectrum, i.e. as a polemic term in a discussion with (actual and would-be) representatives of a \\"political correctness\\", but mainly in the field of conservativeness, rightwing populism and rightwing totalitarianism.Auer: \\"Political Correctness\\", p. 294. =In political rhetoric= The political right use the term more often in order to discrediting political opposites. By downgrading \\"left\\" ideals to \\"do- goodism\\", they emphasise the claim to argue in an own realistic way and on a factual level while the Gutmensch are implied to have lost touch with reality, to have a weak reflecting capacity, an unrealistic and high claim or utopian ideas.Auer: \\"Political Correctness\\"Von Leesen: \\"Das sagt man nicht!\\". Michael Klonovsky, for example, chief executive at German news magazine Focus, accused:Michael Klonovsky: Das Gott-Wort der Guten. In: Focus, 31, 2 August 2010. People who are offended in such a way see this as a rhetoric trick, which ridicules their striving for humanism, solidarity and social equity. Seeing the counterpart as Gutmensch took the discussion to a personal (argumentum ad hominem = \\"ad personam\\") and emotional level, in order to avoiding a discussion on a content level. The term is often used as an aggressive defense strategy against criticism on personal positions. Potential criticism on (factual or putative) racist, homophobic, anti-semitic (and increasing also anti-Islamic) or sexual violations taboos is debilitated by downgrading the person with those rhetoric strategies. =Moralistic strategy= In political discussions the usage of the term Gutmensch gains a moral polarized shape, which is convenient to decrease the respect of the political opponent and to discredit them. There are strategies in political rhetoric to discuss political topics either on a factual level or on a moral level. Stigmatizations of political opponents by using terms like \\"pc\\" (political correctness) or Gutmensch moralize communications. Therefore, the position of the political opponent is discredited and he is forced to change position, if he doesn\`t want to lose reputation. Especially obvious becomes the strategy, if there are actual or claimed taboos. The art of the rhetoric is working when terms like Gutmensch or \\"moralizing prig\\" bring the political opponent in discussions into situations where the reply is supposed to say \\"my opinion or the tabooed view\\". This rhetoric proves as effective, because only under difficult circumstances can factual matters be discussed analytically. Clemens Knobloch (Universit√§t Siegen) refers to this relationship. =As \\"ideological code\\"= According to a discourse analytical survey, which was published by political scientist Katrin Auer in the √ñsterreichischen Zeitschrift f√ºr Politikwissenschaft (√ñZP), are especially topics placed by the political right under the cipher \\"pc\\" (the term coming up usually because of Gutmenschen) of which the society was not able to talk openly without falling victim to the \\"terror of Gutmenschen\\". Gutmenschen thereby revealed were often pictured club swinging, in this context talking about \\"moralizing prig\\", \\"racist prig\\", \\"fascist prig\\", \\"Auschwitz prig\\" or similar, so Auer. Therefore, a concept of the enemy and a concept of the taboo came up, in which in particular misogynist, racist and anti-Semitic comments appeared rebellious and taboo breaking, it was said in the article. The term Gutmensch functioned here as code in order to being able to talk and being understood in this paradigm without having to expose one's own attitude, Auer adds. A well-known example was to replace the word \\"Jew\\" by the term Gutmensch in anti-Semitic speeches. Parts of the audience which understood themselves not as anti- Semitic, were allowed to agree without hesitation, concludes Katrin Auer.Auer: Political Correctness., pp. 294, 300 (PDF; 103 kB).  Further use  =Until 20th century= Gutmenschen, then called bonhommes or boni homines, was a term used for members of the heretic movement in medieval times. They were also referred to as Cathars, but for themselves they used the name veri christiani (true Christians). Aside from the derogatory use, the French term bonhomme (good person) did carry a positive connotation at times, ascribing moral qualities just as the English term gentleman does. On the other hand, it was none other than Karl Marx who used bonhomme in a derisive manner. He polemically wrote about \\"Jacque le bonhomme\\", which was a disguise for mocking Max Stirner.Marx, Engels: Marx-Engels-Werke. 3, pp. 121‚Äì123. = Harald Martenstein = German author and journalist Harald Martenstein developed his own definition of Gutmensch after repeatedly having dealt with the term shitstorm (in German exclusively referring to an internet meme) in his writings. In 2015, he proposed using Gutmensch to describe people who act aggressive and self-righteous when fighting for what they think is the good cause, unmindfully considering themselves being excluded from any set of social rules. Gutmenschen, in that sense, believe that it is ok to be offensive, humiliating and to even exert violence.Harald Martenstein: , Zeit- Magazin, 6 April 2015 Not even having publicized his proposal, Martenstein already received heavy criticism. Among the critics was Die Welt journalist Matthias Heine, who accused Martenstein of tempting the wrong people to over- use the word by putting too much of an emphasis on the term, therefore turning Gutmensch into an unusable word for those being of sound mind.Matthias Heine: , Die Welt, 23 March 2015 Ironically, one year earlier, German writer Akif Pirin√ßci had called Martenstein a Gutmensch in his polemic Deutschland von Sinnen (Germany unhinged).Harald Martenstein: Zeit-Magazin, 17 May 2014; Akif Pirin√ßci: Deutschland von Sinnen. Der irre Kult um Frauen, Homosexuelle und Zuwanderer. Manuscriptum, Waltrop 2014, , p. 228 At that time, Martenstein was still rather in favor of the term, polemically explaining in his book Die neuen Leiden des alten M. (The New Suffering of Old M.): \\"As for good-doing and most things in general, it is a question of the dosage: when overdone it becomes totalitarian.\\"Harald Martenstein: Die neuen Leiden des alten M. Unartige Beobachtungen zum deutschen Alltag. Bertelsmann Verlag, M√ºnchen 2014, , p. 45  Wordmark Gutmensch  In 2014, Patrick Orth, manager of German rock band Die Toten Hosen, registered the wordmark Gutmensch.Deutungshoheit: \\"Tote Hosen\\" sichern sich Rechte am Unwort \\"Gutmensch\\", spiegel.de Since then, the band has been selling print T-shirts labeled \\"Gutmensch ‚Äì No one likes us. We don't care!\\". Unwort des Jahres In Germany, the \\"Unwort des Jahres\\", a word with bad connotations, is annually nominated by a changing, independent jury of four linguists and one journalist. Gutmensch was nominated in 2011 (second position) and 2015 (first position). In 2011 the jury stated: > By using the term the ethical idea of the good man is picked up maliciously > in internet forums in order to vilify all dissidents without considering > their arguments. The term \\"Wutb√ºrger\\" (enraged people) is used in a similar > way, although the term Gutmensch violates principles of democracy (...). The > term has been used in that way for already 20 years. However, it has gained > more influence in different socio-political contexts in 2011 and has > therefore increased its potential of vilifying dissidents.\\"Pressemitteilung: > Unwort des Jahres 2011\\" , 17 January 2012 The statement in 2015 said that the term is connected to the refugee crisis.

The choice was influenced by the refugee crisis in 2015.

The \\"pizza box\\" also makes home delivery and takeaway substantially easier. The pizza box has to be highly resistant, cheap, stackable, thermally insulated to regulate humidity and suitable for food transportation. In addition, it provides space for advertising. The pizza packages differ from those of frozen pizzas, which contain the frozen product in heat-sealed plastic foils as is the case with much frozen food.  History  A pizza box collection point at Old Orchard Beach, Maine Containers to deliver freshly baked pizzas have existed at least since the 19th century, when Neapolitan pizza bakers put their products in multi-layered metallic containers known as stufe (singular stufa, \\"oven\\") and then sent them to the street sellers. The aerated container was round and made of tin or copper.Heston Blumenthal: In Search of Perfection. Bloomsbury Publishing, 2006, , S. 63. Disposable packaging started to be developed in the United States, after the Second World War. At that time pizza was becoming increasingly popular and the first pizza delivery services were created. In the beginning they attempted to deliver pizzas in simple cardboard boxes, similar to those used in cake shops, but these often became wet, bent or even broke in two. Other pizza chefs tried to put pizzas on plates and transport them inside paper bags. This partly solved the problem. However, it was almost impossible to transport more than a single pizza inside one bag. In this way, the pizzas on the top would have ruined the surface of the others. The first patent for a pizza box made of corrugated cardboard was applied in 1963 and it already displayed the characteristics of today's pizza packaging: plane blanks, foldability without need of adhesive, stackability and ventilation slots.Abraham L. Tunick, Container, U.S. Patent 3,163,344 erteilt am 29. Dezember 1964. The combination of such slots along with water vapour absorbing materials (absorption agent) prevented the humidity build-ups that characterized traditional transport packaging. It is assumed by brand historians that the pizza box was invented by Domino's Pizza, even if they did not file a patent application. Until 1988, this chain employed a type of packaging whose front side was not directly connected to the lateral sides, but rather the flaps fixed to the lateral sides were folded inward under the lid. This design is also known as \\"Chicago folding\\". Domino's was the first pizza producer which employed pizza boxes on a large scale and in this way expanded its delivery range beyond the area immediately close to the pizzeria. Towards the end of the 1960s, the delivery service was further developed thanks to the introduction of heat-insulating bags.Jean L. Walsh, Insulated Container for Pizza Pies, U.S. Patent 3,428,103 erteilt am 18. Februar 1969. In October 2019, restaurant chain Pizza Hut announced that it was trying out a new high-tech round design of pizza box.  Requirements  = Stability and stackability = Traditional way of folding a pizza box Most packaging for the transport of pizzas is made of cardboard, as this is both cheap, easy to work with and lightweight while maintaining adequate structural integrity to hold and deliver pizzas. Both solid fibre board and single wall corrugated board are used. The corrugated cardboard in use is often of the E flute size (micro or fine waves with a flute pitch of 1.0 to 1.8 mm), but thicker B flute cardboard with a flute pitch of 2.2 to 3.0 mm are also used. Not only the geometric construction of the cardboard determines the stability of the box, but also especially the type of paper and its grammage. For the liner mostly containerboard is used on the inside of the box. This does not only make the box stable, it becomes more resistant against humidity and oil as well. To reduce the space needed to store the packaging to a minimum, the pizza boxes are folded just before use out of flat blanks. The required storage space depends very much on the different thickness of the material. Pizza boxes made from solid fibre board take up about half the space the boxes with E flute size cardboard need, and a quarter of the space of those made of B flute size cardboard. Apart from the material itself, the stability of the box is determined by the form it is folded into. The type of pizza box with flaps firmly attached to the side walls that are folded into the front wall has established itself as the standard. In this case, the walls of the box are connected at the edges and this increases its stability. The traditional way of folding the box is an example of this folding type. Its disadvantage is that the walls of the box rise vertically which makes cutting the pizza in the box with a pizza cutter more difficult. = Heat insulation and humidity regulation = The opening on the side of the box allows water to evaporate The pizza box is supposed to allow the transport of a baked pizza with the minimum loss in quality possible. This means the box has two tasks to fulfill that are not easy to combine: On one hand, the box should insulate as well as possible against the cold air outside, the occasional wind and heat radiation, in order to keep the pizza warm. To reduce heat flow the box has to close as firmly as possible to keep the warm air inside. Consumers consider a temperature between 70 and 85¬∞C to be ideal for pizza consumption. On the other hand, the box should keep the pizza from getting soggy, so that the crust and the covering are crisp on arrival. To ensure this, the condensation caused by the pizza must be let out (airing holes and some diffusion through the cardboard) or absorbed by the box. Pizza boxes made of single wall corrugated board that are not equipped with additional insulation cool the transported pizza down too far after just ten minutes. The oil in the pizza dough can extract some of the essence in the cellulose when in contact with untreated corrugated cardboard. To prevent a change in the taste of the pizza through the material of the pizza box, and simultaneously to stop the cardboard from getting soggy, the pizza boxes have a thin coating of aluminium foil on the inside. Another possibility is to lay the pizza on either aluminium foil, a mixture of corrugated cardboard and blotting paper, or waxed paper. However, this changes the thermodynamic properties of the pizza box considerably. The pizza crust cannot give up any humidity downwards, meaning the layer beneath does not only impedes fat from trickling down but also steam.  For pizza delivery  = Pizza saver = In the US, many pizza boxes include a spacer made of heat-resistant plastic (usually polypropylene) placed in the middle of the pizza called the pizza saver (also known as \\"package saver\\", \\"box tent\\", \\"pizza table\\", or \\"pizza lid support\\").About.com: Package Saver.Produktbeschreibung: Pizza Lid Support . This stops the box lid from touching the pizza and prevents cheese and toppings from sticking to the lid when it is being delivered.Alexis Madrigal: The 3 Big Advances in the Technology of the Pizza Box. In: The Atlantic. 18. Juli 2011. The pizza saver's origin goes back to a 1985 patent by Carmela Vitale.Henry Petroski: A Round Pie in a Square Box. In: American Scientist. Juli‚ÄìAugust 2011.Europ√§isches Patentamt, retrieved, 26 October 2011 (Englishmen). The pizza saver is often criticized for being a waste of resources as it is only used once and then thrown away.Kritik am Pizza saver (englisch). For this reason, ideas for its reuse are being developed. File:Pizza saver.JPGA pizza saver File:Pizza Funghi mit Pizzahalter.JPGA pizza with a pizza saver = Bags and boxes for transport = Domino's Pizza motor bikes that are used for pizza home delivery in Goa, India, with transport boxes mounted atop There are special padded transport bags and boxes for delivery. Some of these bags can be heated in order to keep the temperature at the desired level. Mostly, they can either be plugged to a socket or powered by the 12 volt car battery. This means that the insulation of pizza boxes themselves is less important. Carry bags insulate best when their lid is connected to the rest of the bag on one side and the remaining three sides can be attached to lid by a zip. A bag can contain about three to five pizza boxes. = Pizza box with thermometer = The pizza boxes by Pizza Hut in Morocco and other countries have a thermometer indicator on the outside which color codes the temperature of the pizza inside. When the pizza is hot, the indicator shows the words \\"HOT\\" in red letters on a white background. However, if the temperature of the pizza goes below a certain value, the \\"Hot Dot\\" turns black and the words are no longer legible.Scott Wiemer: Take a 'Tour' of Pizza Boxes of the World, privates Video √ºber besondere Pizzakartons aus verschiedenen L√§ndern (Englisch), retrieved, 15 July 2012  Variations of new pizza box designs for reuse or improved recycling or composting  = Reuse Box = One variation to the traditional cardboard pizza box is the reusable box. It is made out of recyclable plastic, is round or square has a variety of cover options with vents. They can be hand-washed, by dishwasher or commercial cleaning to be used over and over again. An advantage to this new variation is that there is no taste absorption from corrugated cardboard. = Biodegradable or Compostable Box = Another variation is biodegradable or compostable boxes mostly made out of sugarcane or bamboo or plant based materials. There are several variations in the marketplace as with their cardboard counterpart. Most variations noted of pizza boxes support the same carry methods, stackable and nestable both unused and with enclosed pizza. There are no known differences when using a transport bag or warming bin. Where cardboard is usually delivered flat requiring 2 storage areas for unassembled and assembled boxes, most of the new variations only require a single area of storage.  Possible contaminations  = 2,6-Diisopropylnaphthalene (2,6-DIPN) = DIPN is used as a solvent in certain kinds of paper. These can be part of scrap paper which is used in the manufacturing of packaging like the pizza box. Direct contact or evaporation can transfer DIPN from the packaging onto the packed food, contaminating it. Especially food containing fat, like pizza with a layer of cheese, can absorb DIPN.Nieders√§chsischen Landesamt f√ºr Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit: Kernl√∂semittel DIPN in Verpackungen: 8 von 128 Proben beanstandet, Presseinformation Nr. 063. 17 December 2004. Accessed 5 January 2012. To date, there is no knowledge of danger to the health of the consumer. Still, paper contaminated with DIPN must not be used in the food sector in order to minimise danger of contamination.Bericht √ºber die 109.

It has since been redeveloped as a business park. History The area was populated by a cotton mill in the 19th century, which had easy access to the Mersey and the London North Western Railway. A sand pit was dug in 1899, and used in the early 20th century before being filled in 1923. A housing estate was built in the mid to late 1930s, including a number of terraced houses and a recreation ground. By the 1970s, the estate had become one of the worst in Greater Manchester, with a fearsome reputation for vandalism, burglary and arson. A 1978 report in the Stockport Advertiser suggested that the estate should be razed to the ground and turned into industrial units. By the 1990s, Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council had decided to demolish the estate for redevelopment after 200 homes on the estate had become vacant and half the council-housed residents were on a transfer list. In 1999, the last remaining residents moved out and all buildings were demolished. The land sat unused for some years afterwards, and continued to attract antisocial behaviour from youths and fly tipping. Redevelopment In 2007, the site was cleared to create a new business park. In 2015, Stockport MBC planned to invest ¬£10m to regenerate the area with a light-industrial park, creating a potential 240 new jobs.

It was NJPW's biggest show between August's G1 Climax and January's Wrestle Kingdom 11 in Tokyo Dome and featured nine matches with four of them contested for championships, main evented by Kazuchika Okada defending the IWGP Heavyweight Championship against Pro Wrestling Noah representative Naomichi Marufuji. This was the fifth event under the King of Pro-Wrestling name. Production =Background= The event aired in Japan on TV Asahi and worldwide through NJPW's internet streaming site NJPW World with English commentary provided by Kevin Kelly and Steve Corino. =Storylines= King of Pro-Wrestling featured nine professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Pro Wrestling Noah representative Naomichi Marufuji, who challenged for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship in the main event King of Pro-Wrestling was main evented by Kazuchika Okada defending the IWGP Heavyweight Championship against Pro Wrestling Noah representative Naomichi Marufuji. The match stemmed from the previous summer's G1 Climax tournament, where the two wrestled in the same block. While both failed to advance from the block, Okada with a record of five wins, three losses and one draw and Marufuji with a record of five wins and four losses, Marufuji was victorious over the reigning IWGP Heavyweight Champion in their opening match on July 18. On August 14, the final day of the tournament, Okada himself nominated Marufuji as his next title challenger. During the two months between the announcement and the match, Marufuji's GHC Tag Team Championship, which he held in his home promotion with Okada's Chaos stablemate Toru Yano, also came into play. On September 25, after Okada and his Chaos stablemates Gedo, Jado and Yoshi-Hashi had defeated Marufuji, Yano and two other Noah representatives, Atsushi Kotoge and Daisuke Harada, in an eight-man tag team match, Okada and Yoshi-Hashi challenged Marufuji and Yano to a tag team title match at Noah's October 8 event. Marufuji and Yano went on to retain their title with Marufuji pinning Yoshi-Hashi for the win. The King of Pro-Wrestling main event marked Marufuji's second shot at the IWGP Heavyweight Championship, having unsuccessfully challenged Hiroshi Tanahashi for the title in September 2012. The semi-main event of the show featured a rematch from the finals of the 2016 G1 Climax as Kenny Omega took on Hirooki Goto. On August 14, Omega defeated Goto to win the G1 Climax and earn a contract for a shot at the IWGP Heavyweight Championship on January 4, 2017, at Wrestle Kingdom 11 in Tokyo Dome. The holder of the contract would have to defend it until the end of the year in order to get his title shot. Omega made his first defense on September 22 at Destruction in Hiroshima, defeating Chaos member Yoshi-Hashi, who had defeated him during the G1 Climax. Following the match, Yoshi-Hashi's stablemate Hirooki Goto entered the ring and challenged Omega to a rematch from their final match. Omega first asked the audience if they wanted to see the match, but when the audience responded with a loud cheer, told Goto to \\"go to hell\\". NJPW, however, officially announced the rematch on September 26. Katsuyori Shibata, defended the NEVER Openweight Championship at the event The NEVER Openweight Championship would also be defended at King of Pro-Wrestling as reigning champion Katsuyori Shibata defends against Kyle O'Reilly. This match stemmed from the September 19 Destruction in Tokyo event, where Shibata successfully defended the title against O'Reilly's reDRagon tag team partner Bobby Fish. Following the match, O'Reilly confronted Shibata, challenging him to a title match, which was accepted by Shibata and officially announced on September 26. O'Reilly, much like Fish, held a victory over Shibata from a Ring of Honor (ROH) event the previous August. Both of NJPW's tag team titles would also be defended at the event. The IWGP Tag Team Championship match was set to feature a rematch from the previous June's Dominion 6.19 in Osaka-jo Hall, where The Briscoe Brothers (Jay Briscoe and Mark Briscoe) would defend against the Guerrillas of Destiny (Tama Tonga and Tanga Loa). After capturing the title at Dominion 6.19, The Briscoe Brothers went on to make their first successful title defense against The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson) on September 22, but were afterwards attacked by the Guerrillas of Destiny, who demanded a rematch. In the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship match, The Young Bucks were set to defend the title against David Finlay and Ricochet. On September 25 at Destruction in Kobe, Finlay, who had recently graduated from his \\"young lion\\" status, replaced Ricochet's regular tag team partner Matt Sydal in a match, where the two teamed with Satoshi Kojima to defeat The Young Bucks and Adam Cole for the vacant NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championship. Following the win, Finlay proceeded to challenge The Young Bucks to a match for their junior heavyweight tag team title. Sydal had missed the Hiroshima and Kobe shows officially due to \\"travel issues\\". Heading into King of Pro-Wrestling, Finlay essentially took over his spot as Ricochet's regular tag team partner. Other featured matches included an eight- man tag team match, where the Los Ingobernables de Japon (L.I.J.) stable of Bushi, Evil, Sanada and Tetsuya Naito take on Hiroshi Tanahashi, Jay Lethal, Kushida and Michael Elgin. Over September's Destruction tour, Bushi captured the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship from Kushida, while Naito, the leader of L.I.J., defeated Elgin for the IWGP Intercontinental Championship in a match, which featured outside interference from not only Bushi, Evil and Sanada, but also Kushida and Tanahashi, with the latter two coming to Elgin's aid. ROH wrestler Jay Lethal had been a part of L.I.J., before having a falling out with the group during an ROH show in August. Another eight-man tag team match will feature four wrestlers from the Pro Wrestling Noah promotion; Go Shiozaki, Katsuhiko Nakajima, Masa Kitamiya and Maybach Taniguchi taking on the NJPW quartet of Hiroyoshi Tenzan, Manabu Nakanishi, Satoshi Kojima and Yuji Nagata. Prior to King of Pro-Wrestling, NJPW was set to present a special match celebrating the October 1 launch of the new Tiger Mask W anime on TV Asahi. In the match, Tiger Mask W would take on Red Death Mask. Event Kota Ibushi, who made a surprise return to NJPW as \\"Tiger Mask W\\" Prior to the King of Pro-Wrestling event, Tiger Mask W defeated Red Death Mask in a pre-show match. During the match, Tiger Mask W performed several of Kota Ibushi's signature moves, which led to the crowd chanting Ibushi's name. Shortly after the event it was confirmed that the character had been portrayed by Ibushi. Ibushi had resigned from NJPW in February 2016, stating that he wanted to continue his career as a freelancer. Throughout 2016, Ibushi wrestled for several promotions in both Japan and the United States, most notably taking part in WWE's Cruiserweight Classic tournament. WWE reportedly made several attempts to sign Ibushi to a contract, but he insisted on remaining a free agent. Prior to his surprise return to NJPW, WWE had already announced Ibushi for their upcoming Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic tournament. The first title match of King of Pro-Wrestling saw The Young Bucks make their second successful defense of the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship against David Finlay and Ricochet with Matt Jackson pinning Finlay following the More Bang for Your Buck. In the next match, the Guerrillas of Destiny defeated the Briscoe Brothers to regain the IWGP Tag Team Championship with Tama Tonga pinning Mark Briscoe with the Guerrilla Warfare double-team finishing maneuver. After the match, the Guerrillas of Destiny, along with their Bullet Club stablemates The Young Bucks, continued attacking the Briscoe Brothers. This led to Tomohiro Ishii trying to make the save, but he was stopped after being hit with the Guerrilla Warfare. Kazuchika Okada, who retained the IWGP Heavyweight Championship in the main event The next match saw Hiroshi Tanahashi, Jay Lethal, Kushida and Michael Elgin take on the Los Ingobernables de Japon stable of Bushi, Evil, Sanada and Tetsuya Naito. The match ended with Lethal and Elgin isolating Naito from his stablemates with Lethal hitting him with the Lethal Injection, after which Elgin pinned him for the win with the Elgin Bomb. Following the match, Elgin posed with Naito's IWGP Intercontinental Championship belt, before the victors were attacked by L.I.J. As Kushida was being stretchered out of the arena with a supposed neck injury, Bushi nominated him as his next challenger for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship. The next title match saw Katsuyori Shibata make his third successful defense of the NEVER Openweight Championship against Kyle O'Reilly. Shibata won the match by referee stoppage after locking O'Reilly in a sleeper hold. Following the match, Pro Wrestling Noah representative Go Shiozaki entered the ring, indicating he wanted a shot at the NEVER Openweight Championship. After Shiozaki had exited the ring, Shibata was attacked by Evil, who laid him out with the Evil and then posed with the NEVER Openweight Championship belt. The next match saw Kenny Omega defend his contract for a shot at the IWGP Heavyweight Championship at Wrestle Kingdom 11 against Hirooki Goto. Goto attacked Omega before the opening bell, hitting him with his contract briefcase and then dropping him with a DDT on top of it. Omega, however, recovered with help from the interfering Young Bucks, and eventually won the match following a V-Trigger and the Katayoku no Tenshi, retaining his contract. In the main event of the show, Kazuchika Okada made his first successful defense of the IWGP Heavyweight Championship against Pro Wrestling Noah's Naomichi Marufuji. Towards the end of the match, Okada hit Marufuji with Noah founder Mitsuharu Misawa's signature Emeral Flowsion move and then pinned him for the win with his own finishing maneuver, the Rainmaker. After the match, Okada had a staredown with Kenny Omega, setting up the main event of Wrestle Kingdom 11 in Tokyo Dome.

Coils are used as components of circuits, and to provide the magnetic field of motors, transformers, and generators, and in the manufacture of loudspeakers and microphones. The shape and dimensions of a winding are designed to fulfill the particular purpose. Parameters such as inductance, Q factor, insulation strength, and strength of the desired magnetic field greatly influence the design of coil windings. Coil winding can be structured into several groups regarding the type and geometry of the wound coil. Mass production of electromagnetic coils relies on automated machinery. Coil Stator  Principles  Efficient coils minimize the materials and volume required for a given purpose. The ratio of the area of electrical conductors, to the provided winding space is called \\"fill factor\\". Since round wires will always have some gap, and wires also have some space required for insulation between turns and between layers, the fill factor is always smaller than one. To achieve higher fill factors, rectangular or flat wire can be used. fill factor The fill factor can be calculated from: :F = frac{d^2 cdot frac{pi}{4}cdot n }{bcdot h} :d  Wire gauge including the varnish insulation :n  Number of windings :b cdot h  Cross section of the coil body Polished cut image of orthocyclic winding orthocyclic wound round coil Dense packing of wires reduces air space, and is said to have a high fill factor. This increases the efficiency of the electrical device and an improved heat conductivity of the winding. For best packing of round wires on a multi- layer winding, the wires in the upper layer are in the grooves of the lower layer for at least 300 degrees of the coil circumference. The wires occupy a dense package which is called ‚Äúorthocyclic winding‚Äù. The opposite of this would be a random wire structure within the winding space, which is called ‚Äúwild winding.‚Äù = Wild winding= Also known as jumble winding, with this type of winding structure only poor fill factors can be achieved. The random wire placement leads to a wider distribution of resulting wire length on the coil body and consequently a wider range of electric coil resistances. Despite its disadvantages, it is common in mass production. It is characterized by low demands for machinery and operator and can be wound with very high speeds. Wild windings are mostly applied in contactor- and relay coils, small transformers, Ignition coils, small electrical motors, and generally devices with relatively small wire gauges up to 0.05 mm. Achieved fill factors with the use of round wires are about 73% to 80% and are lower compared to orthocyclic windings with 90%. The winding height can be estimated using the formula: :h = d^2 cdot frac {n}{b} :d  Wire gauge including the insulation :n  Number of windings :b  Width of winding Wild Winding =Helical winding = Helical winding The wires are placed helically in every layer. Owing to the direction of movement from layer to layer changing between right- hand and left-hand, the wires cross and locate themselves within the gap of the layer underneath. A wire guiding of the lower layer is not existent. If the number of layers exceeds a certain limit the structured cannot be maintained and a wild winding is created. This can be prevented with the use of a separate layer insulation, which is needed anyway when the voltage difference between the layers exceeds the voltage strength of the copper wire insulation. = Orthocyclic winding = Orthocyclic winding Orthocyclic wound coil Orthocyclic winding of a round coil Orthocyclic winding of a rectangular motor coil This type of winding structure creates an optimal fill factor (90.7%) for round wires. The windings of the upper layer need to be placed into the grooves provided by the lower layer. The best volume use is found when the winding is parallel to the coil flange for most of its circumference. When the winding has been placed around the coil body it will meet with the previous positioned wire and needs to make a step with the size of the wire gauge. This movement is called winding step. The winding step can occupy an area of up to 60 degree of the coil circumference for round coil bobbins and takes one side of rectangular coil bobbins. The area of the winding step is dependent on the wire gauge and coil bobbin geometry. If the winding step cannot be executed properly then the self-guiding ability of the wire is lost and a wild winding is produced. Overall, the first intruding wire mainly determines the location and quality of the winding step. It should be recognized that the wire needs to enter in a possibly flat angle into the winding space. That way an unnecessary bending of the wire is being avoided and the needs space for the second winding step is minimized. For orthocyclic wound coils, the winding step areas is always located at the area of wire entering the winding space and is being continued in helical form against the winding direction. As a consequence a bigger winding width of the coil, leads to a bigger winding step area along the circumference of the coil. The created offset leads to a different position of the layer step, from the first to the second layer, in comparison to the wire entry. This behavior repeats itself with every layer which leads to a spiral shaped crossover section at the side of the winding. Owing to the fact that wires are crossing within the crossover section the resulting winding height is increased. As a result, orthocyclic wound coils with a round coil ground are never circular in the cross over section, but the radial moving winding and layer step creates a hump shape. Experience has shown that, depending on the winding width, coil and wire diameter, the crossover section is about 5 to 10 percent higher than the regular winding height.  Location and size of the crossover section  Owing to the fact that the winding should be mostly positioned parallel to the winding flange, meeting an orthogonality condition, it is necessary to adjust the winding width to the number of turns per layer of the winding. In particular for non-circular shaped coil cross-sectional areas, it is desired to locate the crossover area to the small side of the coil body, also called winding head. This is due to the fact, that non-circular coils are being mounted on a sheet metal package or in a circular arrangement. The coils should be rather small, in order to avoid a contact with the neighboring coil or the sheet metal package. For orthocyclic round coils three winding geometries can be defined: a) Equal number of turns per layer 293x293px b) Unequal number of turns per layer, starting with shortened layer 281x281px c) Unequal number of turns per layer, starting with longer layer 290x290px The choice of the winding structure to be used basically depends on the design of the coil or the coil body. Among others, the available space conditions for winding width and winding height must be considered. Moreover, it is possible to influence the location and the end of the last winding by selecting a clever winding pattern. The winding height of an orthocyclic coil winding results from the following equation: :h = [1+(n-1)cdot sin 60^circ]cdot d :h -Winding height :n  Number of layers :d  max. wire gauge above the varnish (CuL) Since an orthocyclically wound coil with at least 300¬∞ of the circumference of winding layers has the tightest circle package of the wire cross-sections. This winding method reaches the highest fill factor and is the best way to fill the available winding cross-section with round wires. Square coils are seen as orthocyclically wound when the winding and layer jump occur only on one of the sides of the winding cross-section. In theory, a geometric fill factor of 0.91 will be reached. In practice, however, the value cannot be reached because there exists a winding jump and layer jump area and the wire insulation is not taken into account. Orthocyclic winding : ADelta = frac {d^2}{4} cdot sqrt{3} : Sigma ADelta = frac {d^2 cdot pi} {4} cdot frac {60}{360} cdot 3 =frac {d^2 cdot pi} {8} fill factor = frac {Sigma ADelta}{ADelta} = frac {frac {d^2 cdot pi}{8}} {frac {d^2}{4} cdot sqrt{3}} = frac {d^2 cdot pi}{8}  frac {1}{frac {d^2}{4}cdot sqrt {3}} : = frac {pi}{2 cdot sqrt {3}} = 0,907 In general, it can be stated that the requirements that need to be fulfilled for orthocyclic windings are very high. The summation of all tolerances has to be kept at a very low value. Consequently, the following values can be named as indicatory values: a) Tolerance of the winding space width : Delta b= 0,2 cdot d :Delta b  tolerance of winding space :d  max. wire gauge including the varnish coat (CuL) b) Tolerance of the wire Max. wire diameter tolerance should not be larger than : Delta d = 0,4 cdot frac {d}{n} : Delta d  gauge ‚Äì wire tolerance :n  number of turns per layer :d  nominal wire gauge including the varnish coat (CuL) This corresponds to about half the wire tolerance according to the specification of the German standard DIN46435.  Manufacturing orthocyclic windings Even if the demands for low tolerances of the wire and the winding space had to be observed with correspondingly high technical effort, there would still remain the problem that the wire guiding on the machine side has to follow the previously described winding design also at high winding speeds. In practice, this is hardly possible at high winding speeds since, e.g., at 18.000 windings per minute, the wire guide for a wire with a thickness of 0.3 mm would need to perform a winding pitch in only 0.7 ms. The problem is amplified by the fact that in practice the ideal wire is never absolutely straight. These unevennesses and bends resulting from the winding of the wire on delivery rolls have the effect that the wires are never completely close together according to their actual diameter but at a distance according to their unevenness. This gap formation is additionally influenced during the winding-up of the wire by the surface quality of its coating, e.g. the sliding behavior as well as by the expansion behavior or stiffness of the copper. The wire elongation may be between 6% and 3% depending on the wire diameter and the supplier. Practice has shown that an orthocyclic winding can only be manufactured in an acceptable way when choosing a very high wire elongation level (stretching leads to a straight or even wire) at the beginning. For the reasons described above, it is therefore in practice impossible for the wire guide to determine a precise gradient according to the wire diameter. These unpredictable circumstances may be prevented or counteracted at the beginning of the winding by forcing the wire, meaning, every single winding of the first layer on the inner coil diameter, into a predefined position. The wire places itself into a prefabricated groove geometry of the coil body and the wire guide does not need to follow it exactly but only approximately. Since the wire always loses in cross-sectional area due to the wire drawing to be used and the necessary deflections (mechanical stresses under tensile load) during winding, the distance between the grooves is designed only for the max. possible wire diameter. Effects of bends and tolerances of the wire and the coil body as well as changing surface qualities can be avoided that way. Especially wire bends that develop due to wire deflections caused by, e.g., pulleys, wire eyelets or even the wire guiding nozzle itself within the wire feeder of a winding machine can lead to deformations that remain on the winding of a coil. Applying grooves to the winding basis supports the layer-accurate position of the wire during the winding process. This behavior is particularly beneficial for the winding processes where a plastic deformation of the wire is unavoidable immediately before the depositing of the wire onto the winding basis. This behavior can be observed especially in the needle winding technology. Owing to physical reasons, it is unavoidable that the wire leaves the wire guiding nozzle at an angle of approx. 90¬∞. Therefore, mechanical tensions remain inside the wire that are visible in the form of a bent winding on the winding basis. As a result, the following windings, or also the following layers, can change in their desired position. Starting from the second layer, the relocation is facilitated, since the wire is guided through the inter-spaces of the preceding layer. In case of deflections that are not too excessive as far as the process is concerned, the wire leads itself and with a constant number of windings per layer. It means for the wire guiding movement that the smaller the distance of the wire guiding nozzle towards the coil, the more precise the tracking must be. In certain circumstances it can be completely performed without a relocating movement, if the distance from the nozzle to the coil is that long that the force component against the guiding behavior of the wire itself has no longer an effect. Owing to the self-guiding behavior of the wire, it is therefore possible that also during orthocyclic winding the wire guide can run continually and does not need to follow gradually.  Design of an orthocyclic winding The design or interpretation of the required space of an orthocyclic winding is usually realized by applying an iterative approach. At first, the specified parameters of the required number of windings, the required wire cross section and the maximum space available for an insulated coil are used for the calculation basis.  Calculation example An orthocyclic winding design for a round coil with 150 windings, a wire diameter of 0.3 mm and a maximum winding width of 9 mm shall be calculated. The winding diameter at the winding base measures 8 mm. Structure of a coil with an even number of turns per Given: Wire-√ò Cu 0,3 mm ‚Üí CU1L=0,334 mm (According to the table) Coil width: should be 9 mm // 150 turns, coil inner diameter 8mm. a) Calculation of the winding width In the first iteration step, a winding with the same number of windings per layer is assumed or taken as a basis. 9/0,334 ‚Üí 26,9 turns/layer ‚Üí chosen 26 turns per layer : Winding width = 26 cdot 0.334 + 0.5 cdot 0.334 = 8.85mm b) Calculation of the number of layers Number of layers = 150/26 = 5,76 ‚Üí 6 layers c) Calculation of the winding height : text{Winding height h}= [1+(h-1) cdot sin 60^circ] cdot d : text{ Winding height h}= [1+(6-1) cdot sin 60^circ] cdot 0.334=1.78mm d) Calculation of the winding height in the layer cross section area : h_text{Lagensprung} = 1.78 + 5% = 1.86mm b=8,85 mm; e=1,78 mm; c=1,86 mm; d=0,334 mm; winding structure calculation example for an orthocyclic area. 150 turns in 6 layers with 26 turns per layer and an equal number of turns per layer e) Calculation of the outer diameter of the coil : text{Outer diameter }: D=2 cdot h + inner diameter of winding : D = 1.78cdot 2 + 8 = 11.56mm f) Calculation of the outer dimensions of the coil in the cross section area : text{ Outer diameter }: D_text{max}=2 cdot h_text{layer step} + inner diameter of winding : D_text{max}=1.86 cdot 2+8=11.72mm Summary of results: The calculation showed that the space needed for the purely orthocyclic winding with enameled wire fills a rectangular area that measures 1.86 mm x 8.85 mm. Taking into account the assumption that it is a round coil with an inner diameter of 8 mm, then, the outer diameter is 11.72 mm. The winding space constraints (flanges of a coil body) of a winding support must have a diameter of at least Dmin=11,72mm considering the layer jump area. = Calculation of the fill factor= The fill factor measures the ratio between the volume of a winding package and the volume needed to house the winding pack. For this purpose, it is necessary to take the required space for the rotation diameter of the coil in the \\"cross over section\\" into consideration. Scheme for the needed volume of a winding; D1=1,78mm D=8mm D2=1,86mm a) Calculation of the mechanical fill factor The imaginary space with the dimensions of 8,85 mm x 1,86 mm contains an area of 16.461 mm2.

The wire is pulled from a supply roll that contains 400 kg enameled copper wire. The wire is fed through a guiding tube. Before starting the actual winding process, the wire is mounted to a post or a clamping device of the coil body or winding device. By the linear laying movement of the wire guiding tube, the component to be wound is turned in a way that the wire is distributed throughout the winding space of the coil body. The rotary motion as well as the laying movement is achieved by using computer controlled motors. In relation to one rotation of the rotation axis and depending on the wire diameter, the traversing axis of the wire guiding tube is moved accordingly (traverse pitch). In doing so, rotational speeds of up to 30,000 1/min can be reached, especially when processing thin wires. Depending on the winding diameter, wire speeds of up to 30 m/s are achieved during the winding process. The components to be wound are mounted on so-called winding devices. The winding devices are coupled to driven spindles that generate the turning motion. Since bringing the wire into the winding area should be done as evenly as possible, the rotational axis and the traversing axis operate synchronically during the winding process. In order to be able to control the positions of the wire guiding nozzle in relation to the component to be wound, even with different component geometries, normally three CNC axes are used for the method with a wire guiding nozzle. This enables the terminating to coil body posts (the posts are also intended to make contacts by soldering or welding): By letting the three axes run in a way that a spiral movement of the wire guiding nozzle around the initial winding post is resulting, it is possible to fix the start or end wire of a coil by the so-called termination. To keep the wire under tension when changing the product, it is fixed to a wire parking pin of the machine. This wire parking pin can either be a clamp or a copy of a post that is wrapped at the coil similar to the termination process. Before the winding starts and after terminating the start wire post, the wire to the parking pin needs to be cut. This takes place according to the wire thickness by tearing or cutting. Enameled copper wires up to a diameter of approx. 0.3 mm can be torn normally by a tearing pen that passes close to the post of the coil or the wire guiding nozzle itself. The separating point should be very close to the post of the coil in order not to impede a subsequent contacting process (soldering, welding etc.). Since all the movements during winding are directed via CNC axes, it is possible to realize wild windings, orthocyclic windings or other winding geometries (e.g. cross- coils). The wire guiding control can often be switched between continuous and gradual movement. Owing to the separation between wire guiding and rotation of the component to be wound, the configuration of product and wire guiding can be duplicated in the linear winding technology. Therefore, it is possible, e.g., to wind onto 20 spindles simultaneously. This makes the linear winding method a very efficient process since the cycle time for producing a component results from the quotient of the winding process cycle time and the number of used spindles. The linear winding technology is often applied efficiently where low-mass coil bodies have to be wound.

Aumann GmbH = Flyer winding = \\"Flyer\\"-winding with a sequential winding process In the flyer winding method, a winding is produced by feeding the wire via a roll or through a nozzle that is attached to a so- called flyer that is rotating at a certain distance from the coil. The wire is fed by the flyer shaft. For winding the component to be wound, it needs to be fixed inside the winding area of the flyer. It is necessary that the wire is fixed outside of the flyer at any time of the winding procedure. The fixation of the wire is made possible normally by the so-called successive winding method (often used at rotary indexing tables): At the circumference of the table are wire clips or wire deflections that enable a pulling along and with it a fixation of the wire. This will allow a very quick component change, given that no separate depositing of the wire in a wire clip on the machine is required. Because the last guided point of the wire is located at a nozzle or roll of a flyer arm which is moving on a fixed circular path that can only be shifted in laying direction, a precise laying close to the coil surface is impossible. As a result, it is not easily possible to clearly lay down or even to terminate the start and end wires onto the component to be wound. But it is certainly possible to produce also orthocyclic coils with the flyer winding process. Here, a self-guiding behavior of the wire on the coil surface is an advantage. As the component to be wound has to be presented only in the winding position and otherwise does not need to perform any movement during the winding process, also very bulky and massive products can be manufactured. One example is the rotors of electric motors (rotor winding technology, special form of the successive winding method): The wire is held by a clip fixed to the machine during the component change. Since the rotors often consist of heavy, punch-packed metal sheets, the flyer winding technology is of particular advantage in this regard. Since the flyer cannot be directly guided in case of the rotor winding technology, the wire is guided across polished guiding blocks into the corresponding groove or slot. Special wiring sleeves ensure the correct wire position at the terminals of the Commutators. = Needle winding technology= Determination of the necessary groove slot width depending on the wire gauge (Source: Aumann GmbH) Inner-grooved stator with six poles To efficiently wind the pole shoes lying close together of electronically commutated multipole three-phase motors, they will be coated with insulation and directly wound with the needle winding method. A needle with a nozzle that is placed at a right angle to the direction of movement travels in a lifting motion passing the stator packs through the groove channel between the two neighboring poles of the motor to drop the wire in the desired place. The stator is then turned at the reversal point on the winding head by one tooth pitch so that the previous process can run again in reverse order. With this winding technology a specific layer structure can be realized. The disadvantage is that there must be a clearance between two adjacent poles with a size of at least the nozzle diameter. The nozzle diameter is about three times the diameter of the winding wire. The space between two adjacent poles can therefore not be filled completely. An advantage of the needle winding technology is the fact that the needle support carrying the wire guiding nozzle is normally coupled to a CNC coordinate system. This allows moving the nozzle through space towards the stator. This way, it is possible to also perform a laying movement apart from the normal lifting motion and the rotation of the stator. A targeted placing of the wire is nevertheless only possible to a limited extend since the wire is pulled at an angle of 90¬∞ from the wire guiding nozzle resulting in an undefined bulging. The 90¬∞ redirection of the wire when exiting the hollow needle stresses the wire a lot and makes it difficult to wind copper wires with a diameter of more than 1 mm in a reasonable way. Orthocyclic winding with a needle winder is therefore only partly possible for these winding tasks. Since the wire guiding nozzle can be moved freely throughout the room, it is possible for the nozzle to terminate the wire at the contact points if equipped with an additional swivel device. As in the case of the conventional linear winding technology, a contact pin or a hook contact can be terminated for the electrical connection and for interconnecting the single poles in a star connection or delta connection.

Aumann File:E Aumann Nadeltraeger 01.jpgWinding nozzle in winding position File:E Aumann Nadeltraeger 02.jpg Winding nozzle in position for termination ¬¥ A precise synchronization of the rotary motion with the stroke movement is required so that the needle does not touch the groove channel during the up and down movement. Influencing variables for the maximum winding speed are the needle stroke, the rotation angle of the stator (number of poles), the wire diameter and the groove channel width and the helix angle of the angularly grooved stators. The mass of the wire guide and the needle support experience a high acceleration. This can lead to unwanted vibrations that have an effect on the winding quality. The lifting motion is normally generated by ball screws. During this movement, the servo drives must constantly reverse in order to reverse the direction of the needle movement. Another way of initiating the stroke movement is to apply a crank disk that can also have a stroke adjustment and that uses the advantage of the sinusoidal movement pattern without needing a drive motor to reverse. Strokes (windings) up to 2500 per minute can be achieved. With the needle winding technology, it is possible to produce a finished assembly such as stator coils or a connection and contacting onto a machine. Apart from the not fully utilized space between the poles, it is possible ‚Äì in contrast to the conventional pull-in technique ‚Äì to wind also motor coils with a good fill factor onto low stator sheet stack heights (coiler head heights). = Toroidal core winding technology= Torodial coil With the toroidal core winding technology an electric coil or winding is created by winding an electrical conductor (e.g. copper wire) through the circular ring and evenly distributing it over the circumference (Toroidal inductors and transformers, toroidal chokes). Before the winding starts, the Toroidal / Magnetic core is mounted into a holding fixture that can initiate a slow rotary movement of the core with mostly three rubberized points of contact. A wire storage ring (orbital wheel) arranged 90¬∞ to the toroidal core will now be opened at the circumference and introduced into the center of the toroidal core. The wire is then coiled around the wire storage ring that was closed again. When the required amount is present on the wire accumulator, the end of the wire from the wire accumulator is fixed to the toroidal core that needs to be wound. By simultaneous rotation of the toroidal core and the wire accumulator ring, a winding develops that is distributed along the circumference of the toroidal core. Upon completion, the wire accumulator has to be opened again in order to be able to remove the ready wound toroidal core. Since the start and end wire are often not fixable to the toroidal core, toroidal winding machines can only be partly automated. Toroidal cores are used despite the high manufacturing costs (a great deal of manual work) due to the low magnetic flux leakage (MFL ‚Äì Leakage inductance), low core losses and the good power density. One possible quality feature of transformers is a uniform distribution of the windings along the circumference (low stray field). The insulation between the various windings can be solved quite differently. In case of covering windings, a film is applied after the first winding to achieve good stray field characteristics. This film needs to be wound to cover the whole circumference. For this, also toroidal winding machines with special magazines can be used.  Winding technology for motor coils  =Trends in motor winding technology= Stators with different winding topologies Because of the higher performance density, brushless EC drives (electronically commutated motors) with permanent magnet rotors are increasingly used instead of the asynchronous technology. Owing to the compact design, the copper content can be cut in half in the best-case scenario. The manufacturers of electric motors also demand more flexibility of the production technology. For producing asynchronous motors, drawing-in systems are usually used that are initially winding air-core coils only to draw them later into the stator with a tool. In contrast, the concentrated winding of EC stators is more flexible in the manufacturing process, energy saving when implemented, better adjustable during operation and it requires less space. Hairpin winding has been widely used in electric motors in the automotive sector. This winding method offers the advantage of automated winding process. However, the large size of the conductors are prone to proximity losses resulting in high winding AC loss. Similar method, plug-in winding, has been proposed where the coils are pre- made with plug-in features (male-female). Compared to hairpin, the plug-in method offers the advantages of automated winding process and small conductors size, however, the disadvantage of high contact resistivity in the plug-in connectors could result in a thermal hot spots. Examples for different Designs of EC-Stators (Source: Technoexpert Dresden) = Manufacturing process of distributed winding= Asynchronous motors with distributed winding account for the major share of electric motors. Unlike the concentrated winding, not every tooth pole is wound in a distributed winding; instead, coils are in slots and span multiple pole teeth. Since the winding may block slots from further insertion of wire, it may be necessary to wind a complete phase winding at one time. Comparison of concentrated and distributed windings Coil insertion machines insert prefabricated groups of coils into the stators of electric motors. The coil groups are frequently manufactured with flyer winding machines and put onto the insertion tool with a transfer instrument. In small-batch manufacturing, the coil groups are relocated manually from the winding masks to the insertion tool using transfer instruments. Subsequently, an insertion tool places the preformed winding into the stator slots. The slots are sometimes insulated with paper. When diagonally winding the coil into the slot of the stator, the coil's internal width must be larger than the stator's height which leads to the formation of the large winding head that is characteristic for the insertion technique. Process steps for insert technique: 1) Non equipped insert tool; 2) With coils equipped insert tool; 3) Insert tool with coils and mounted stator; 4) Stator with inserted coils This in turn results in a relatively loose winding in the stator slots. Consequently, it is necessary to close the slot openings towards the middle of the stator with a so-called sliding cover. In many cases, this may be conducted concurrently with the insertion of the coils. Since the coil's conductors have to pass through an oftentimes tight slot, the coils consist of a certain number of small spare cross-sections which are later connected in parallel. It is with this measure, that large conductor cross-sections may also be produced. Another reason for using many thin conductors connected in parallel lies in avoiding the so-called Skin effect. In order to keep the impact of this effect as small as possible, wires with the largest possible surface are used in high-frequency technology, e.g. in the form of thin spare cross-sections or Litz wires. The low losses of Litz wires partly stem from the fact that a large area of the inner surface is taking part in the current flow. In particular in electric mobility, the motor is often powered by high- frequency voltage. When using large conductor cross-sections, this may possibly lead to high losses and an undesired heat development in the stator winding. After inserting the winding, rework on the stator or the winding ends needs to be performed. Usually, the multitude of connecting lines is separated manually and bundled according to the different phases. Both winding ends are tied up with an adhesive tape or strap in the further course of the finishing. When using a high operating voltage, the partial winding of each phase must be insulated against the respective adjacent phase with foil or insulation paper. To ensure that the winding heads are positioned exclusively at the back of the stator, both of them must be molded. This is either executed by using an enameled wire receiving a bonding electric current during molding or by cold forming which is followed by impregnation. The creation of a certain winding head shape allows a rotor to be installed or a stator to be inserted into the housing afterwards.

The number of holes q constitutes a characteristic dimension of the winding setup. It states how many slots q per phase m and pole (provided by pole number 2p) are available. : q=frac{N}{2pcdot m} q = Number of holes N = Number of grooves 2p = Number of poles m = Number of phases In the case of distributed windings, q ‚â• 1, and if q is integer, it is an integral slot winding. If q = zq/nq is a fractional rational number, it is referred to as fractional slot winding. When it comes to single tooth winding, q < 1 and thus always a fractional rational number. Example for a distributed winding topology The winding scheme shows the execution of three-phase winding with 30 groups of coils at a winding pitch of 1:6 with the same width at a star connection. The combination of the star connections is depicted in form of a circle on the yellow contact bar. Each coil needs two slots. Consequently, 30 slots (coil groups) x 2 slots / group = 60 slots are required in order to achieve a consistent occupancy of the slots. The number of poles amounts to 10. The respective number of slots is determined by: : q=frac{60}{2 cdot 5 cdot 3} = 2 = Manufacturing process of concentrated windings for stator coils= Needle winding displayed with end wires on the lead frame Manufacturing stator windings in a concentrated manner can be performed in various ways. The choice of the respective winding process is primarily based on the design and setup of the stator as well as the commercial aspects. Most stators are designed in a way that allows the application of different winding processes. The stator construction of the full-metal cut which is internally slotted constitutes the only exception. This construction can solely be manufactured by applying the needle-winding technique and in some rare cases the insertion technique for concentrated windings. Most concentrated windings are executed as double-layer windings, i.e. each tooth entails a concentrated winding and two coil phases in each slot. In the case of single-layer winding, the reference tooth of two adjacent tooth coils is not winded. There is always only one phase of one coil found in the slots. ‚Ä¢ Inside slotted stator laminations The needle-winding technique basically represents the only feasible winding process for inside slotted stator laminations. The stator mainly consists of a steel package, two end plates and slot insulation. The particular benefit of this process technology lies in the fact that the winding machine produces a completely winded assembly group when adequate electrical slot fill factors are employed. If, however, the use of single teeth requires joining and interconnecting operations, all interconnecting measures of the coil sections of one phase may be executed by the winding machine for the stator laminations. In this case, the electric slot fill factor may amount up to 45%. Since manufacturing a functioning stator merely requires a small effort, the negative impact on the electric fill factor is gladly accepted. In order to be able to use various additional functions of the winding machine, the end plates are often designed in a way which allows e.g. the taking on of cutting terminal contacts. In addition, winding space restrictions and laying ducts for the connecting wires of a phase may be integrated. Example for a lead from for a full sheet metal package stator displaying several design characteristics The material costs are also low due to the small number of individual components. In combination with the modest costs of the means of production, stator laminations constitute a practical solution. Three essential basic concepts frequently come to the fore when dealing with the design of stator laminations. Stator laminations for concentrated winding are divided into the following main groups. a) Paper-insulated stator laminations Paper-insulated stator Insulation paper or insulation foil is usually attached to the slots of the stator package before the insulated end plates are installed. The insulation material, e.g. Nomex or Mylar or Kapton, is taken from the endless strip. It is pre-hemmed, cut to the length of the stator and inserted. The insulation strip must be slightly longer than the stator package to ensure complete insulation of the winding. Thin insulation takes up little of the slot area, which improves the fill factor of the winding. b) Insulated stator laminations at end plates Concept of an end plated insulated stator When using this type of stator design, lining the slot with insulation paper is not required. The plastic end plates are designed in a way that the sides of the injected shafts insulate half of the stator slot. It is also beneficial, that costs for paper as well as costs for the production process for the mounting of the paper do not arise. Under consideration of a certain wall thickness of these injected shafts, z-shaped overlapping of the shafts in the area of the stator nut center may be achieved in order to increase the creepage distance and clearance to avoid dielectric breakdowns. However, a disadvantage constitutes in the fact that the depth of the shot of the injection process is limited depending on the stator lengths and the plastic material used. When e.g. using PA with a solid material content (e.g. glass fibers) of approx. 25% and a shot of approx. 25 mm depth, a wall thickness of at least 0.5 mm may be achieved. However, it has negative repercussions on the fill factor compared to the use of insulation paper which e.g. is only 0.1 mm thick. c) Molded stator laminations Concept for a coated stator An extended form of the stator's end insulation with injected slot shafts constitutes in the molded stator. In the last few years, injection molding has progressively been developed. It now allows to place the stator package into the injection mold and to facilitate the molding process. In doing so, the wall thickness reached is similar to the one of the end plates with injected slot shafts. A particular benefit of this process lies in the fact that a pre-assembly of the end bells and the insulation paper can be avoided which prevents the danger of insulation gaps that could lead to short circuits. However, due to the very costly complex injection mold, costs are only covered at a batch size of approx. 50.000 stators per year, compared to single component insulation. In addition, the diversity in types is only conditionally lucrative since a new injection mold needs to be produced whenever the length of the package or the laminations changes. ‚Ä¢ Outside slotted stator laminations Schematics for flyer winding of an outer-grooved stator Outside slotted stator laminations may be processed with the needle-winding technique, the flyer-winding technique and the linear- winding technique. The selection of the process depends on the desired number of turns in the winding and the intended fill factors. Consequently, flyer- winding is particularly used if a thin wire and thus high numbers of windings are expected in combination with a medium and high voltage application. Therefore, it is typically used with ‚Äúwhite goods‚Äù, such as e.g. household applications, or in general domestic engineering with an operating voltage of 230 V. In the case of stators with less windings and a lower mass, it is common to process outside slotted stator laminations using the needle-winding technique or the linear winding technique. Wickelvorrichtung_f√ºr_die_Linearwickeltechnik.pngLinearwinding application used for an outer grooved stator Nadelwickelanwendung_zum_Bewickeln_eines_au√üen_genuteten_Vollblechschnittstators.pngNeedle winding application for an outer grooved stator Basically, there is also a variety of different ways of insulation for outside slotted stator laminations as it is for inside slotted stator laminations: Verschieden isolierte Vollblechschnitte ‚Ä¢ Segmented stator coils Polechain consisting of segments Segmented stator coils are used, for example, if a high winding number is required in addition to the demanded high fill factor and the corresponding orthocyclic winding. They are preferably processed with the flyer-winding technique as well as with the linear-winding technique. For this type of stator construction, it is particularly beneficial to produce accurately layered windings with extremely high fill factors because of the freely accessible winding space. However, the design of the segmented stator coils has negative repercussions on the material and production costs. Often, complex processes need to be applied in order to form the single teeth to a round stator. Another disadvantage constitutes in the large number of contact points, except when the pole-chain winding technique is used. For segmented stator coils, a distinction is made between T-segments and plugged engine coils. The latter may be bodiless or winded onto a coil body and subsequently be transferred to a T-segment or directly to the stator laminations, depending on the application. Contingent on the expected contact points, there are three different options for the production of T-segments. For one, there is the classic single T-segment with the disadvantage of having a high number of contact points. In addition, there is the phase winded T-segment with a reduced number of contact points. Finally, there is also the winding of so- called pole chains with a drastically reduced number of contact points. a) T-segments Winding tool for the fixation of a T-segment in a linear winding process T-segments are preferably processed with the linear winding technique or the flyer-winding technique. For this, the winding supports are designed in a way that a mounting at the tooth back can be carried out. It is in particular the outer geometry that will serve as the contact surface of the adjacent tooth later on, which is used for securing the tooth in the winding device. It is also quite common to place a dovetail slot in the outer part of the back of the tooth which is axially arranged to the tooth and serves the purpose of securing the tooth in the winding device. Insulation of the winding of the T-segment may be performed the same way as for inside and outside stator laminations which is either by paper insulation, end bell insulation or as a molded tooth. b) Phase-wise wound T-segments Winding tool for the fixation of a T-segment chain in a linear winding process In combination with a series connection, T-segments are often produced as a phase compound in the form of a toothed chain. As is the case of single T-segments, the linear- winding technique as well as the flyer-winding technique are also applied in this context. When it comes to the winding of the teeth, the final wire of the first tooth is guided to the next tooth and then serves as the starting wire for the second tooth. This process continues, depending on the number of a phase's sub-segments. The design of the components does not show any substantial difference compared to the one of classic single teeth. The main reason for the processing of T-segments into one tooth chain lies in the reduced of number of contact points. Six contact points are required for three wound single tooth poles. However, only two contact points are needed if the just mentioned arrangement inside the winding machine is adopted. When using high current with low operating power, this type of manufacture is especially beneficial since it reduces contact resistances and potential errors. However, it is a very complex endeavor to form the tooth chains to a complete stator which is of disadvantage. It must be ensured, for example, that the end wires of each tooth are equipped with tension relief to ensure that the winding does not open during handling. Usually, it is taken care of with adhesive tape or pole or bag-type forming of the tooth's frontal insulation where the wire may be attached after the winding process. Single teeth are easy to handle, whereas tooth chains must be built in carefully, taking into account the risk of damaging the connecting wires. c) Plugged tooth coils Stator design with plugged tooth coils Plugged tooth coils are frequently used in a star-shaped stator design where a final ring or yoke is mounted after the assembly of the coils. Inside slotted stator laminations can also be fitted with plugged tooth coils. But in that case, fill factor losses can be registered due to the plug- in direction from the inside to the outside. Conical windings are only possible and beneficial, if the plug-in direction is from the outside to the inside. As for the type of insulation, it is possible ‚Äì as with the classical single teeth ‚Äì to work with paper insulations or insulating end plates. If insert molding is applied with a star-shaped package, it is not referred to as plugged tooth coils anymore because of the necessary direct winding with a needle winding system, flyer winding technique or linear winding technique. Plugged tooth coils eventually require at least two contact points per coil, just as the single teeth. Toothed chains of a phase connected in series are rarely produced since, compared with the already difficult assembly of phase- wise wound T-segments, they will be followed by further assembly movements (pushing onto the stator pack) and the changing length ratios of the connecting wires between the coil sections of a phase. Therefore, two cut-and- clamp contacts per coil are frequently used for plugged tooth coils which finally reach into a control card or a lead frame via pin-like forms of the contacts. d) Chains on poles (chained poles) With this kind of stator design they try to combine the benefits of the needle-wound laminations => Minimum number of contact points ‚Äì with the advantages of the linear wound single tooth => Maximum fill factor. For this, the chained poles winding technique is used that provides a very high fill factor due to the fact that the structure of the stator is opened up into a linear arrangement of the single teeth and besides, in contrast to the otherwise common single teeth, generates only a few contact points. The connecting wires of the coil sections of a phase connected in series do not need to be separated. Schematics of an open winding space using a needle winding process for chained pools When winding toothed chains, the flyer winding technique, also a type of needle winding and chain winding can be used. Schematics of an open winding space using a flyer winding process for chained pools A disadvantage when using the flyer winding technique is the fact that only one tooth at a time can be wound. So, toothed chains are developing as a result but due to the wiring topology most of the stators have to be undone again. A simultaneous winding of multiple stator phases usually is not possible. If, however, the flyer winding technique for toothed chains requires auxiliary tools for placing the wire into the winding space or the linear arrangement needs to be given up when the winding of a single tooth takes place, the wire can be directly deposited with the needle winding technique. A special benefit when using the needle winding technique is provided by the possibility to wind all three phases at the same time depending on the type of stator circuitry. Especially advantageous is the behavior of the connecting wires between the coils of the individual phases at the rounding of the teeth if the linear arrangement of the teeth for the winding does not need to be given up. Therefore, it is opportune to make sure that the connecting wires pass through the center of the rounding radius. Three workpiece carrier with each one pole chain and a wire guide for a parallel winding of the phases U,V and W Owing to this smart arrangement of the wires, it is possible to avoid changes in the wire length during rounding. When using the needle winding technique, it is quite common to wind multiple toothed chains simultaneously. This happens mainly on carrier tools or workpiece carriers that are positioned inside the needle winding machine. Owing to the fact that the phases U, V and W as well as multiple stators can be wound at the same time, the needle winding technique has a high performance density in connection with the use of toothed chains. = Definition of the fill factors for motor coils= Electric motors must be compact and lightweight. They should also deliver a higher output with less copper usage. A prerequisite for this is an appropriate design of the coil body and suitable wire dimensions. One parameter of importance for the developer of motors is the electrical fill factor. The fill factor measures the ratio between the volume of a winding package and the volume needed to house the winding package. In case of stators, it can be said that the electrical fill factor is the ratio of the content of non-ferrous metals of the stator including the stator slot to the sum of the uninsulated copper cross sections. But in contrast to round coils, only the stator slot is considered. The reason for this is that merely the conductor strands in the stator slot contribute to the torque of the motor. The winding overhangs on the narrow sides of the winding cross section of a tooth only result in unwanted losses in the form of increasing electric resistance and undesired heat development. = Winding space examination of concentrated windings for stators = The required space for stator winding is designed by an iterative approach just as with the round coils. First, the parameter of the required number of windings, the required wire cross section and the maximum space provided by an insulated stator slot are considered for the calculation basis.  Example for calculating the fill factor of a stator lamination  An orthocyclic winding design for a stator with 40 windings per tooth at a wire diameter of 0.5 mm shall be calculated. The available insulated winding space is geometrically defined and has a surface of 35 mm2. An insulation paper with a thickness of 0.25 mm is used. ‚Ä¢ Determination of the mechanical fill factor Given: Wire-√ò Cu 0,5mm ‚Üí CU1L=0,548mm (Value according to norm) 40 turns, insulated winding space = 35mm^2, insulation paper 0,25mm Geometry aspects for determining the mechanical fill factor; A= insulated winding space When looking at the insulated winding space graphically and the required number of windings at a given wire diameter, it can be said that considering the space requirements for the winding nozzle (required groove width: about 3*0.548=1.6 mm) only 38 windings can be introduced into the winding space of the stator slot. : A= frac{pi cdot D^2}{4} cdot n cdot 2 : A= frac{pi cdot 0.548^2}{4} cdot 38 cdot 2 = 17.9mm^2 A= Accumulated partial spaces of the _insulated_ wires DL= wire gauge including the varnish coat n= Number of turns per tooth : F_text{mech}= A_text{wire}/A_text{winding space} cdot 100% : F_text{mech}= 17.9mm^2 / 35mm^2 cdot 100% : F_text{mech}= 51.1% ‚Ä¢ Determination of the electrical fill factor The theoretical consideration takes place by assuming that the uninsulated wire is to be found in the uninsulated groove.

Oeuvre Brkanoviƒá was one of the most prominent representatives of the so-called national style in Croatian music. Using traditional musical means, he blended elements of Croatian folk music with his own strong artistic ideas, and in an attempt to evoke folk art in all its aspects, he drew on traditional rites, particularly on their most primitive features. His musical style is characterized by innovative formal and harmonic procedures, and dense polyphonic textures. Brkanoviƒá's feeling for dramatic tension and powerful emotions made him an ideal operatic composer. His first opera, Equinox, is a realistic musical drama, while the opera-oratorio St Simon's Shrine, inspired by scenes from a 14th-century shrine in Zadar, is strongly archaic. Brkanoviƒá's best-known work is the Triptych of 1936, a requiem setting of epic folk poetry. This intensely emotional work contrasts restrained choral settings, striking for their Slavonic melodic inflections, with passages of blazing passion and intensity, reinforced by a sharp-edged orchestration. The five symphonies are dramatically conceived; outstanding among them is the traditionally-planned, tragic Second Symphony. Its freely tonal, and sometimes harsh, harmonic structure shows Brkanoviƒá's great contrapuntal skill with simple melodic lines, often reminiscent of folksong. The accumulation of motifs and the magnificent handling of the brass are equally noteworthy. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Brkanoviƒá has chosen not to investigate new techniques, but has aimed to draw the best from traditional means.

Composed over a period of seventeen years, the complete work was finished in 2002 on a commission from the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Its world premiere was given by the soprano Christine Brewer, mezzo-soprano Margaret Lattimore, tenor Paul Groves, baritone Jonathan Lemalu the Tanglewood Festival Chorus, and the Boston Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Bernard Haitink on March 6, 2003. Composition =Background= Harbison composed the first sketches of what would become his Requiem in early 1985. The music was written on the opposite side of a page that also contained the first passages his 1999 opera The Great Gatsby. Like The Great Gatsby, the Requiem wouldn't be completed for over a decade. He composed much of the \\"Introit\\" over the course of 1985, but didn't return to the work until 1991, when he wrote a piece that would become the basis for the \\"Sanctus\\" on a commission from The Rivers School Conservatory. Harbison misplaced the score, however, requiring him to present a different piece for the school. He wouldn't find the sheet music of the \\"Sanctus\\" until seven years later. Later, in 1995, Harbison was one of thirteen international composers commissioned by Internationale Bachakademie Stuttgart to write a movement for the collective Requiem of Reconciliation to commemorated the victims of World War II. Harbison was assigned the \\"Recordare\\" section (then titled \\"Juste judex\\"), which he based on musical ideas he had earlier developed for the \\"Introit.\\" Then, in 1999, he \\"very spontaneously\\" composed a \\"Hostias\\" section and was motivated to finish the Requiem. Finally, a 2001 commission from the Boston Symphony Orchestra allowed him to complete the work. The Latin text of the Requiem is set to traditional sections of the Requiem Mass, scripture, and a medieval poem \\"all added in at different times, but acquiring a weight and dignity through use and age.\\" The composer wrote, \\"I wanted a sense of ancient inheritance to inhabit my setting: a ritual steeped in the inevitability of death ‚Äì gradually moving toward consolation and acceptance.\\" Harbison composed the piece through the initial shock and aftermath of the September 11 attacks, causing him to reflect on the meaning of the composition. He recalled, \\"My account of the genesis of the piece makes it clear that its sources go back fifteen years. But the events of that fall made my purposes clearer. I wanted my piece to have a sense of the inexorability of the passage of time, for good and ill, of the commonality of love and loss. I wanted to open up an aural space where this could be acknowledged.\\" He continued: =Structure= The Requiem has a duration of approximately 58 minutes and is composed in two parts comprising thirteen smaller movements: Part I :Introit :Sequence I: Dies irae :Sequence II: Tuba mirum :Sequence III: Liber scriptus :Sequence IV: Quid sum miser :Sequence V: Recordare :Sequence VI: Confutatis ‚Äì Lacrymosa Part II :Offertorium :Sanctus :Agnus Dei :Lux aeterna :Libera me :In paradisum Harbison described the two parts as \\"an accidental collection of words about mortality (part I) and continuity (part II), to be shaped into a purposeful collection of sounds.\\" =Instrumentation= The work is scored for solo soprano, mezzo-soprano, tenor, baritone, SATB chorus, and an orchestra consisting of two flutes (2nd doubling piccolo), two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons (2nd doubling contrabassoon), two horns, two trumpets, three trombones, timpani, three percussionists, piano (doubling celesta), harp, and strings. Reception The Requiem has been praised by music critics. Reviewing the world premiere, Lloyd Schwartz of The Phoenix remarked, \\"There's such amplitude, so much going on, it's more than one can take in from a single hearing (I went back to hear it again). On opening night, the audience gave the piece, the performers, and the composer a prolonged standing ovation.\\" He added, \\"In this Requiem, the variety is there, certainly in the glittering array of orchestral color. Yet the tone is consistent ‚Äî yearning, struggling, tragic. Even the most joyous music is permeated with foreboding, and that ties it to our own time. And as we know from the great Requiems of Verdi, Berlioz, and Faur√©, these are the very pieces that last.\\" Richard Dyer of The Boston Globe similarly described it as \\"a particularly radiant work.\\" The music was also praised by Ellen Pfeifer of The Wall Street Journal and Bernard Holland of The New York Times, who wrote, \\"There is more to this piece than simply medievalism revised, but one feels in it a chill of old churches, and this creates the overriding impression. Mr. Harbison describes his piece as 'a place to be true to your own thoughts.' I would have preferred him to be more selfish, but in the end one admired his modest steadfastness.\\" References Compositions by John Harbison 2002 compositions Harbison, John Music commissioned by the Boston Symphony Orchestra ","title":"Requiem (Harbison)"},{"id":"51119017","text":"Holy Trinity Church in Eccleshall, Staffordshire, England, is a Grade I listed Anglican church. The building dates mostly from the 13th century, and there was restoration in the 19th century. The church contains the tombs of four Bishops of Lichfield. Anglo-Saxon period The Domesday Book of 1086 recorded that St Chad held the estate of Eccleshall, meaning that before the Norman Conquest the estate belonged to St Chad's Cathedral in Lichfield. It may have been granted originally to Saint Chad, the first Bishop of Lichfield in the 7th century, or to a successor. The first part of the name \\"Eccleshall\\" is the Celtic word for church, suggesting that the estate was based on a Celtic Christian community.D. M. Palliser, The Staffordshire Landscape. Hodder and Stoughton, 1976. Pages 44‚Äì45. The building Viewed from the north The oldest parts of the church, the foundations and pillars, date from around 1189, when Hugh Nonant was bishop of Lichfield. It is thought that the building of this time replaced a small Norman church. The chancel and arcades are largely 13th-century. The clerestory was built in the 15th century. The height of the church, to the top edges of the tower battlements, is . The tower shows two phases of English Gothic architecture, being in 13th-century Early English style for most of its height, with an extension of 15th-century Perpendicular style. The stone pinnacles on the tower were added in recognition of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in 1897. The sandstone font in the church dates from the 13th century. =Restorations and alterations= The five-light window at the east end In 1866‚Äì9 the church was restored by George Edmund Street. The roofs of the north and south aisles were replaced, and the north wall was rebuilt, making the north aisle four feet wider. The ceiling of the nave was removed and the roof above was panelled. In the chancel, the east window was replaced by a five-light window in Early English style; a pointed chancel arch was built, and the chancel roof was raised. The box pews were replaced by oak seating. At the west end, a baptistry and choir vestry were built on either side of the tower.Holy Trinity Church Eccleshall: a history & guide. Obtained at the church in July 2015. The reredos was created in 1898 as a memorial to Colonel Francis Chambers; it was designed by Basil Champneys and made by Bridgemans of Lichfield. A raised dais at the east end of the nave was introduced in 2011. Approval for this (a faculty) had originally been refused by Chancellor Martyn Coates in a Lichfield Consistory Court judgment dated 5 November 2009; but in a judgment dated 31 July 2010 the Arches Court of Canterbury overturned Chancellor Coates' judgment on grounds both of substance and procedure (Re Holy Trinity, Eccleshall [2010]). =Organ= The organ was installed in 1827; it was rebuilt in 1913, and in 1930 by Hill, Norman and Beard. The organ case, of 1931, was designed by W. D. Caroe and made by Bridgemans of Lichfield.Organ Restoration Appeal Official site, accessed 13 October 2016: via Wayback Machine. The last work on the organ was in 2017, when it was repaired and enhanced at a cost of approximately ¬£60,000. Tombs of bishops and churchyard The Bishop's Door, on the south side of the church, leading to the chancel The church contains the tombs of four Bishops of Lichfield. Richard Sampson, who earlier in his career was an agent of Henry VIII concerning his divorce from Catherine of Aragon, died in 1554 and was buried on the north side of the altar; the tomb-stone was moved to the Old Baptistry (located in the south-west of the church) in the nineteenth century. Thomas Bentham, who became bishop soon after the accession of Queen Elizabeth I, died in 1578 and was buried in the chancel; his tomb-stone was also moved in the nineteenth century, to the choir vestry (located in the north-west of the church). The tomb of William Overton, bishop from 1579 until 1609, is in the chancel. It has a recumbent effigy of the bishop, and effigies of his two wives kneeling. The tomb of James Bowstead, who became bishop in 1840, is in the north-east corner of the chancel, near the altar. He died aged 42, after a fall from a horse. Bishop John Lonsdale, who died in 1867, is buried in the north-east corner of the churchyard. The churchyard also contains five Commonwealth war graves, of three British Army soldiers of World War I and a British Army officer and Royal Navy sailor of World War II.Eccleshall (Holy Trinity) churchyard Commonwealth War Graves Commission, accessed 13 June 2019. Bells Four bells were hung in 1547. In 1710, these were replaced by six bells, cast by Abraham Rudhall I. The lightest of these was recast in 1873 by Taylor's Bell Foundry of Loughborough. In the 1950s a steel frame for eight bells was installed, two new bells being added, which were the gift of the Lowe family of Sugnall. There is also a small \\"sanctus\\" bell, made in 1735 by Abel Rudhall, grandson of Abraham I, and added in recent years.Bell tower Eccleshall Parish. Retrieved 13 June 2019.

It tells the story of two immigrants to New France, Ren√© Sel and Charles Duquet, and of their descendants. It spans over 300 years and witnesses the deforestation of the New World from the arrival of Europeans into the contemporary era of global warming.  Plot  The eponymous \\"barkskins\\" are indentured servants, transported from Paris slums to the wilds of New France in 1693, \\"... to clear the land, to subdue this evil wilderness,\\" (p. 17) according to their master, a seigneur. The two men are contracted for three years of service to earn land of their own, but Charles Duquet runs away at the first opportunity, seeking to make a fortune for himself in the fur trade or by any means he can. Ren√© Sel, on the other hand, dutifully wields the axe clearing farmland for the master. Later, he is forced to marry the master‚Äôs cast off Mi‚Äôkmaq woman, Mari, a healer who gives him children. The Sel family heritage is thus Native American and working class. Duquet, luckily surviving his escape through the wilderness, has a fortune to make, mostly on furs and lumber, and by swindling others whenever he can get away with it. Only then will he marry the daughter of a Dutch business partner, open an office in Boston, therefore Anglicizing the family name to Duke, and father or adopt the boys who will build the Duke & Sons timber empire after him. All the while, for the Sel family, there is unceasing discontent. The young are always seeking their future as Native Americans in a whiteman's world. Indian lumbermen, for example, were always recruited for river work balancing on the longest logs rushing down a river where an awkward move could get a man crushed before he drowned.(p. 299)  Major themes  =Nature= Human struggles with nature are a recurring theme in Annie Proulx's books. About the forest in Barkskins, Proulx said, \\"It's the underpinning of life. Everything is linked to the forest. This is but one facet of larger things, like climate change and the melting of the ice. So deforestation is part of a much, much larger package.\\" = Borders = As noted in her memoir, Bird Cloud, Annie Proulx grew up in New England, attended college in Canada, and had a lifelong practice of spending summers in Newfoundland and winters in the States. Thus, she was well acquainted with the geography of the novel and familiar with national and cultural borderlands. Proulx herself descended from English Americans on her mother's side and French Canadians on her father's, which makes her \\"mixed\\", although not to the same degree as the Sels in Barkskins. For the Sel family, the whiteman's cultural borders were closed to them in many ways because the borders of their homelands were never closed enough.  Reception  Barkskins received a 74% rating from the book review aggregator iDreamBooks based on 26 critics' reviews. Review aggregator Book Marks reported three mixed and two negative reviews among 26 total, indicating \\"positive\\" reviews. With few exceptions, reviewers praised the novel particularly with regard to the brilliance of Annie Proulx‚Äôs prose, the intimately detailed scenes by which she reveals the complex inner lives of her characters, and/or breathtaking scenes of fearful destruction as well as awesome beauty. The forests and deforestation of the New World underlie the epic scope of the book, while human adventures range beyond the central concerns of forest ecology and the logging industry. The narrative is partitioned into books that turn the reader‚Äôs attention to one family or another across generations. Some reviewers thought the sweeping epic scope of the work created a faulty or difficult structure for the novel as a whole. Several expressed disappointment that the passage of so many years seemed to shorten the time given to the portrayals of some promising characters, especially toward the end of the book. Some inconsistencies were noted; for example, changes in the diction of a Native American character's speech within a single episode. The didactic nature of the theme was both applauded and faulted. A few reviewers thought it undercut the narrative perspective at times, imposing a good vs. evil dichotomy. Proulx‚Äôs descriptions were universally admired. Most readers found verisimilitude in these observations of the uncertainty and fragility of life, while a few spoke of an overwhelming echo of doom long foretold. Publication Excerpts from the novel were published in The New Yorker in March 2016. In other media =Television= A dramatic television series, based on the novel premiered on May 25, 2020 on National Geographic.

Synopsis  Bin Roye is set in Pakistan. It is the story of Saba (Mahira Khan) and the struggles she faces due to being in love with her best friend and cousin Irtaza (Humayun Saeed). From the very first episode it is established that Saba is madly in love with Irtaza, who she has grown up with. It is also established that Irtaza also cares a lot for Saba, and both have a very close bond. Saba is an extrovert, who lives life to the fullest, and expects Irtaza to fulfil all her childish demands. Irtaza happily does everything Saba asks for, and feels happy seeing her happy. The story starts with Saba and Irtaza celebrating Eid, and enjoying their life in Pakistan. Soon after Irtaza decides to go to America for post-graduate studies. Saba is unhappy hearing about this and gets angry at Irtaza. Irtaza reasons with Saba and tells her that he will return in two years. Saba understands that post-graduate studies is important for his career and agrees for him to go. Irtaza goes to America and whilst studying there develops feelings for his cousin Saman (Armeena Khan). After completing his studies he comes back to Pakistan and Saba is extremely happy to see him. Soon Saman's parents die in a plane crash, and Saman comes to Pakistan along with Irtaza to her extended family for emotional support, Saba and Irtaza take care of her. Soon Saba learns that Saman is not her cousin, but her elder sister, and that Saman was adopted by her uncle when she was a baby. This fact brings Saba and Saman closer to each other. Both Saman and Saba start sharing a very close sisterly bond. Until one day Saba realises that both Saman and Irtaza have feelings for each other. In spite of loving her sister she cannot help but feel jealousy and anger. Soon after Saba's realisation, Irtaza proposes marriage to Saman. Saba is heartbroken seeing this, but she collects herself and tries her best to be happy for her best friend and her sister. Saba happily participates in all wedding rituals, however Saba loses all patience when she finally sees Saman and Irtaza making their wedding vows. In the heat of the moment Saba goes off in a separate room and in a state of anger and shock curses Saman and wishes for the fact that she dies! Saba curses Saman and says that Saman should have died in that plane accident with the parents who adopted her, and she can still die! Why did she come here to ruin her life! Saba's Grandmother who is aware of the situation tells Saba to calm down but in vain! The next morning Saba feels guilty about what she said about Saman, and apologises to her Grandma. After the marriage, Saba keeps a distance from Irtaza, Irtaza notices Saba's behaviour and questions her on a number of occasions. Saba also starts changing from a very full of life person to a very serious person, Irtaza again observes this and does not seem to like this change in her. After a while Irtaza and Saman go back to America and settle there for sometime. Saman gets pregnant and tells Saba about it, Saba gets very happy about the news and congratulates Saman. Irtaza and Saman decide to call Saba to America. Saba is very hesitant to go and meet them as she still has feelings for Irtaza, she politely declines, but is forced by the family to go and stay with them and help Saman while she is pregnant. Saba goes to America. Whilst she enjoys the company of her sister, she again feels very helpless, as her feelings for Irtaza do not die. Irtaza's concern for Saba and his friendliness does not help her helplessness either. One day Saba, Saman and Irtaza go to a party, there, a man named Amir (Adnan Malik) develops feelings for Saba. After the party, on a number of occasions the Amir comes over to Irtaza and Saman's place to try and meet Saba. Both Saman and Irtaza are overjoyed, and feel that the guy will be a great match for her. One day Irtaza sits Saba down and asks her if she is interested in marrying the guy, and she can tell him if she has feelings for him, Saba loses her patience and rudely reverts stating that he has no business meddling in her personal life and he should stay away! This behaviour of Saba makes Irtaza upset, for which later Saba also apologises! Soon Saman delivers a baby boy and Irtaza and her name him Maaz. Saba goes back to Pakistan. A few years pass and Saba does not accept the proposal of Amir, Irtaza feels disappointed, where else Saman tries to understand why Saba does not have any love interest in her life. Saman and Irtaza go to Pakistan for holidays with Maaz. Saman tells Saba that Amir is now getting married, Saba does not seem concerned and says \\"congrats,\\" Saman asks Saba about why she did not want to marry him? to which Saba replies \\"He is not the person she can see her life with!\\" Soon after she says this it starts raining, and Saba gets excited and carries Maaz out to the rain, and both of them start enjoying dancing in the rain! Saman closely observes Saba enjoying and dancing in the rain, and suddenly it hits her that even Irtaza loves the rain a lot! After which she starts reminiscing and realises that Saba has been in love with Irtaza all this while! Thinking this Saman feels quite guilty!

Saba runs to Saman to see her covered in blood! Irtaza and Saba call the ambulance. Whilst Saman is being taken to the hospital, she tells Saba that she is sorry, and now both Irtaza and Maaz are hers, when Saba hears this she gets very anxious, and tells the driver of the ambulance to drive faster! However Saman does not survive the hit and run! Saba is shown to be extremely guilt-ridden and broken down after the accident. She keeps on getting flashbacks of Saman getting rammed in by the car coupled with the voice over of her cursing \\"she should have died\\" Saba feels that she is responsible for Saman's death as she cursed her on her wedding. Saba is completely broken but develops a very strong bond with Maaz. Soon the Grandmother feels that it would be good if Saba marries Irtaza, as this will benefit Irtaza and Maaz, as they are lonely, and it will also benefit Saba since she has always been in love with him. Saba gets very angry hearing this proposal, as she is extremely guilt ridden, and says that she will never marry Irtaza! When Irtaza is asked about the same proposal, he outright rejects it stating that Saba deserves a much better man, and not a man who was married and has a kid, and that he cannot even think like this. Irtaza soon realises that Saba is angry with him due to the proposal, Irtaza talks with Saba and reasons with her! He tells her that he cannot even think of marrying her in his dreams and that he wants the best man for her, and he is not the best, he also says that he loves her a lot, and to not be angry with him!

You told me you will be home by the evening!\\" Irtaza tries to explain that he met with an accident, Saba gets more hyper after hearing this and says \\"All of you guys are planning to leave me, first Saman left and now even you are planning to leave me, all of you guys want to leave me here all alone!\\" She gets hyper and starts shoving him, Irtaza loses his cool and holds her and shouts \\"I am going nowhere!

It was later revealed that Bin Roye will be released as a theatrical film and later on as TV series. Actor Humayun Saeed who played the lead role in film revealed, \\"Bin Roye is a romantic drama. But it will not just be a film; it will also be turned into a serial to be aired on Hum TV with the same cast.\\" In July 2015, after the release of film, the drama serial went into production with same cast and crew, with Haissam Hussain replacing Momina Duraid as a co-director with Shahzad Kashmiri. Farhat Ishtiaq wrote the screenplay for series, changing several plot details in contrast to film. In an interview she explained, \\"Bin Roye the drama has the same cast as in the movie, but things which were not included in movie from the novel will be seen in drama. The shoot is done and most probably will on air somewhere between April and July of this year.\\" This became the Farhat's second consecutive collaboration with Duraid in a year and seventh over all, she recently worked on Diyar-e-Dil (2015) and Udaari (2016), which were the highest-rated and critically acclaimed serials.

Describing his role differences from film, Humayun said, \\"there's already a lot of difference between film and TV. In 2 and half hours, we already have to show a very large story in a limited time in a film, but when it comes to television, we personally like the way the story is narrated. Thus, the progression is completely different; you will get to see a lot that you weren't able to see before. You will find a lot more depth in a few characters, plus, a lot more answers to those unanswered questions. Of course, in a series of 20 episodes, a lot changes.\\" While Khan expressed, \\"It's not really different. Well, there's a whole new track in it which wasn't in the original, so that's new (Laughs)! Saba is the same, I mean, the variation you would see is that you will see a lot more shades to her. Of course, Bin Roye was just 1 hour and 58 minutes, so you will get to see a lot more intricacies in this.\\" Episodes Music The soundtrack of the series is adapted from the film. The original soundtrack of the series is \\"Bin Roye\\", that is penned by Shakeel Sohail, and composed and sung by Shiraz Uppal. Broadcast and release Bin Roye was originally scheduled to release between April‚ÄìJuly 2016, but latter it was announced that it would be released after 2016 Eid-ul-Adha.

Writing for Dawn News, Sheeba Khan wrote, \\"Bin Royes TV version fills in plot holes the movie couldn't\\" and expressed \\"Humayun Saeed was flawless and his chemistry with Mahira Khan was very evident. He easily fit the typical Farhat Ishtiaq character: kind, really good-looking, and successful. The comfort level and the bond that needed to be shown between Saba and Irtaza was easily visualized, thanks to the directors and actors.\\" Saira Khan of HipInPakistan praised Humayun Saeed's performance, saying \\"He is the undisputed king of romantic plays. No other actor can play a romantic hero as well as him\\" and also praised Mahira Khan's performance. Fatima Awan of Reviewit.pk wrote, \\"The power-packed performances of Humayun Saeed and Mahira Khan proved how much potential this drama had if the story had more substance.\\" The rating of Bin Roye (blockbuster) made a huge in UK.

In 2012, Klein and Bistis coined the term \\"wunder-roman\\" to describe their alternative genre.As described in the novel, this term references a mythical 19th-century version of the picaresque novel where the layers‚Äîas story roll along a water wheel.Norman M.

It was written and storyboarded by Joe Johnston and Jeff Liu. The episode was viewed by 1.549 million viewers. It is the series' first fully musical episode, and features seven songs, more than any other Steven Universe episode. The episode shows Steven traveling to Empire City with Pearl and his father Greg, who received a check for $10 million in the previous episode \\"Drop Beat Dad\\" after one of his songs became a success. However, Pearl still heavily resents Greg since Rose, Steven's mother and the love of her life, chose him over her. To improve their relationship, Steven tries to show Pearl and Greg that they have more in common than they think. Plot Steven (Zach Callison) and Greg (Tom Scharpling) are in awe to discover that Greg's song \\"Comet\\" has been used as the basis of a successful burger commercial jingle (\\"Like a Burger\\"). The two debate what they should do with the $10 million Greg received for the jingle, mutually believing the best things in life to be free (\\"Don't Cost Nothin'\\"). Eventually, they decide to take a vacation to Empire City, and Steven suggests that Pearl (Deedee Magno Hall) accompany them (\\"Empire City\\"). Pearl and Greg are reluctant to vacation together, but Steven is optimistic. In Empire City, the trio book a stay at Le Hotel, where the staff joins them in a song about the hotel's opulence and the fun they are having there (\\"Mr. Greg\\"). Greg asks Pearl to dance with him, but she refuses, abruptly ending the song. Later that night, while Steven and Greg are asleep, Pearl sings about her feelings for Rose Quartz and her jealousy for Rose and Greg's love, expressing her regrets and her inability to move on since Rose ultimately chose Greg and created Steven (\\"It's Over, Isn't It\\"). Steven and Greg awaken during the song, and Greg, lamenting that his relationship with Pearl is beyond repair, flees to the hotel bar. Steven reveals to Pearl that he invited her along so that she and Greg could work out their differences. Getting them together, he plays a song on the piano, urging them to talk to each other about their feelings about Rose (\\"Both of You\\"). Once they have discussed their feelings, they are cheered by the hotel staff, and Greg is presented with the bill for their service. The three depart from Empire City; Greg and Pearl chat amiably while Steven happily observes that they are on better terms (\\"Don't Cost Nothing (Reprise)\\"). Production Promotional art for the episode by writer Joe Johnston Episodes of Steven Universe are written and storyboarded by a single team. \\"Mr. Greg\\" was written and storyboarded by Joe Johnston and Jeff Liu, being Johnston's final episode as a storyboarder as he now serves as the show's supervising director full-time, while Ki-Yong Bae and Jin-Hee Park provided animation direction and Jasmin Lai served as art director. The scene during \\"It's Over, Isn't It?\\" in which the camera spins around Pearl was inspired by a similar scene during \\"Crazy World\\" from the film Victor/Victoria.

Taxonomy O. annulifer has a poorly known classification. A number of other species were originally listed as subspecies of it. A 1999 paper suggested that O. annulifer, which at that point was only known from four juvenile specimens, was actually only a juvenile of a different Oligodon species. However, a 2010 paper confirmed the existence of O. annulifer as a distinct species, based on the recent capture of an adult specimen. The species name annulifer derives from the Latin word anus which means \\"ring,\\" and the word fero, which means \\"carry.\\" Oligodon annulifer is a member of the genus Oligodon, a genus common throughout central and tropical Asia. The genus belongs to the snake family Colubridae, the largest snake family, with member species being found on every continent except Antarctica. Description The species is brown on the back, with black rings that contained oval yellowish-brown spots. A specimen described in 1893 had 26 such rings. The sides of the snake are black, with yellowish lines, and the head is also yellowish brown. It has a dark bar across the forehead, and a dark inverted Y shape above the nape of the neck. The underside of the snake is white, with small black dots. The 1893 specimen, which was a young snake, was 16 centimeters long. Habitat and ecology Oligodon annulifer is oviparous, or egg-laying. The species is known to eat the eggs of other reptiles, and it has teeth which are adapted for this purpose; they are sharply edged, to slit eggs easily. It primarily lives in lowland rainforest, and it is a terrestrial, or ground-dwelling, species. Distribution O. annulifer is found on the island of Borneo, where it is thought to be endemic. Specimens have been caught at five different locations across the island, including at Bukit-Baka National Park in Indonesia and the Ulu Temburong National Park in Brunei. It is not thought to be very abundant. It has been observed at up to 100 meters above sea level. Oligodon annulifer has been described from five scattered locations in Borneo, including from inside two protected areas. This broad distribution has led to the IUCN classifying it as a species of \\"least concern.\\" The habitat that it occupies, lowland rainforest, is under threat from human activity, specifically agricultural activity for the production of palm oil. However, the effect of this activity, which also includes logging and mining, on the snake is not known.

He studied at the Academy of Music, University of Zagreb. From 1951 he worked as a teacher in New York. His sister was a famous soprano Zinka Milanov (maiden name Kunc).  Biography  Bo≈æidar Kunc was born on July 18, 1903, in Zagreb, the fourth child of accountant Rudolf Kunc (1867‚Äì1932), a scion of the Kunz van der Rosen family of Graz, and Ljubica Smiƒçiklas (1873‚Äì1936). Apart from Bo≈æidar, only Mira Tereza Zinka (May 17, 1906 ‚Äì May 30, 1989), later a celebrated opera singer, was to attain adulthood. Bo≈æidar grew up in a musical atmosphere encouraged by his musical father (he played the cello and also sang), who gave him an exemplary musical education. He started to compose when he was 12, and from the age of 18 he did this systematically and continuously. Although in 1926 he had completed his four-year course of studies in law, the emphasis of his interest lay in music, which he studied at the Music Academy, choosing two areas that were to occupy him the whole of his life: pianism and composing. He took his piano degree on June 27, 1925, class of Svetislav Stanƒçiƒá, and obtained his diploma for composition and instrumentation on June 25, 1927 under Blagoje Bersa. At the degree concert on June 23 the same year, Bo≈æidar figured as composer and as pianist, performing his own piano compositions, and also accompanying sister Zinka and violinist Ljerko Spiller. Immediately after his degree he started his rich concert and composing career. As early as June 29, 1927, the Zagreb Philharmonic Orchestra performed a concert dedicated to his works (Idyll, the cantata On the Nile, Sonata for Cello and Piano), while the next year for his Violin concerto he won the highly prestigious Zlatko Balokoviƒá Prize. From 1929 on Kunc worked as a teacher as well, tutoring piano at the Music Academy and coaching young singers. For ten years (1941‚Äì1951) he also managed the Opera Studio. In the 1930s Kunc rang up new international successes at European festivals: at the international festival in Dresden in 1934 the Staatskapelle performed his Piano Concerto in B Minor, with the composer himself as soloist (on March 7, 1954, the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Eug√®ne Ormandy performed the same work). After that came well reviewed performances in Karlovy V√°ry, Frankfurt/M and Prague. World War II halted any further development of his reputation. In these years, Kunc still composed, and after the war appeared throughout Croatia and in the Yugoslavia of the time, as soloist and accompanist for singers, often in improvised conditions. A crucial turning-point in Kunc's life was in 1951 when he decided to follow his sister Zinka (now Milanov) to the United States. An affectionate closeness with his sister, now a celebrated prima donna, as well as hope for an international career of his own (combined with an awareness of his peripheral position in the communist Yugoslav regime) all affected Kunc's decision. He soon got involved in Zinka's concert tours, and coached her for all the time she was under contract to the Metropolitan. In the framework of Zinka's concerts, Kunc also played as a soloist, most often performing his own compositions. Still, his appearances stayed in the shadow of his sister's art, and he did not manage to make that breakthrough into the world composing scene as he had hoped. When he went to the United States, the external circumstances of Kunc's life changed essentially. His new and essentially insecure musical status forced him, like so many before him (including B√©la Bart√≥k), into a struggle for mere existence. He worked in a broad field and this caused him lasting stress. Year after year, Kunc undertook many tours with Zinka around the United States and Europe, he played at benefits and in recordings, coached singers and accompanied them at their appearances, played music in a four- handed ensemble, and performed celesta and triangle parts in the orchestra of the Metropolitan Opera. An invaluable source of revenue lay in his coaching in the ballet school of Mia ƒåorak Slavenska (although he considered this work to be beneath him as a pianist). He kept up contacts with some of his friends from Zagreb, and they were joined by others in America. In addition to his versatile and vigorous artistic engagements, the last years of his life were burdened with personal circuities and crises. After his marriage with Karla, n√©e Raƒçiƒá (later married name Cizelj), who to her death kept his Zagreb artistic legacy (today in the Croatian Music Institute) and his second marriage to American nurse Ruth Higgins, from which union came his son Douglas, in 1959 Kunc met DeElda Fiebelkorn (born 1923), and in his marriage with her, and with their daughter, Ivana Joy, found happiness and artistic inspiration. The last performance of Bo≈æidar Kunc was in the packed Ford Hall in Detroit, on April 1, 1964. The Detroit Symphony Orchestra was conducted by Sixten Ehrling and performed, with participation from Zinka, works from the international and Croatian repertoire. The focus of this benefit was the performance of Kunc's Piano Concerto in B Minor, with the composer as soloist. Immediately after the concert, Kunc had a heart attack and died. His friends remember him as a vivacious, always kindly and witty man, a brilliant improviser.  Oeuvre  The extensive oeuvre of Bo≈æidar Kunc encompasses all the musical kinds apart from opera. At the focus of his interest was the piano, to which he devoted four sonatas and about 90 other compositions (programme cycles, bagatelles, nocturnes, preludes, toccatas, stylised dances, music for and about children). The piano was the hub of his chamber works, which in part belong among classical-romantic compositions (violin sonata, sonata for cello and piano, piano quartet and piano quintet), and are partly shorter compositions. Sometimes the composer gives it the leading role in works that have distinctive subject matters, such as Two Chapters from the Book of Job, Two Dance Improvisations, Three Episodes for Piano and String Orchestra, Ballet Scene for Two Pianos and the cycle For Piano and Percussion. Kunc's favourite instrument delivered a powerful musical energy in the brilliantly orchestrated virtuoso First Concerto for Piano and Orchestra (the second concerto was not completed). The private world of Bo≈æidar Kunc is revealed to us particularly in his solo songs. There are some forty of them to English and Croatian lyrics, and they are partially collected into cycles. Their inventive melodies derive from the composer's familiarity with voice, and the aesthetic piano part interacts and mingles with the vocal part. We might recall just the youthful anthology-piece songs Zima (Winter; Antun Branko ≈†imiƒá) and Smrt karnevala (Death of Carnival, Miroslav Krle≈æa) and the later work De Elda's Love Songs to words by his wife. Kunc's youthful orchestral works (Idyll and others), as well as the cantata On the Nile are unjustly forgotten. Bo≈æidar Kunc was quite aware of his worth as a composer. He thought of himself as a \\"link in the chain of the greats\\" and ‚Äì wanting to round off his oeuvre in America ‚Äì worked with great intensity on composition, sometimes only at night. His composerly poetics, which in his homeland was quite distinct from the prevailing trend, on his change of setting and on meeting the international repertoire, acquired certain new characteristics, which invoked restraint along with the widespread labelling of his musical expression as \\"Impressionist\\" or \\"post-Impressionist\\". Such considerations are encouraged in particular by Kunc's harmony, which during his creative lifetime developed according to an expanded tonality in line with the general development of harmonic thinking. It is at the base of the refined and ever- new structure of his works, in which a luxuriant colouring alternates with harsh dissonant consonances of a remarkably expressive impression. In his piano style, Kunc pushes back the previous borders of sonority with a specific registration, imaginative use of the pedal and a new, but typically Kuncian, ornamentation. At the same time he is fond of a markedly melodic line and an easily readable formal disposition, which gives his compositions both equilibrium and classicist clarity. The characteristic constants of Kunc's musical expression are its danceability, picturesqueness (programme music) and its occasional discreet stylisation of folk music.

Abstract: \\"The history and current activities of the Operations Research Society of South Africa (ORSSA) is presented in this paper.\\" The society is affiliated to the International Federation of Operational Research Societies and its subgrouping, the Association of European Operational Research Societies, and is the main national society for Operations Research in the country., IFORS, retrieved 2016-07-20. ORSSA is a nonprofit organization. The society is continually involved in matters which concern operations researchers, such as organising conferences at which papers on OR-related topics are delivered, drawing up guidelines for OR education, presenting short courses on specialist topics in OR, marketing OR at secondary school level, providing information to the public on the nature of OR, and providing information to students at tertiary level on career opportunities in OR.  History  On 18 April 1968 a meeting of individuals interested in OR was held at the Gatehouse at the Sunnyside Hotel in Johannesburg, as a result of initiatives taken by Dave Masterson, Jonathan Miller, Alan H. Munro and John C. Joslin with the support of Dr. H.S. Sichel. The attendance at this multi-disciplinary meeting was in excess of 180. The guest speaker was Prof. B.H. Patrick Rivett of England, an excellent speaker and at that time one of the best known operations researchers in the world. Out of this meeting a National Steering Committee was formed which would be responsible for the organisation of the possible establishment of an Operations Research Society in South Africa.Masterson, Dave. 1990. \\"Some recollections of the early days.\\" Newsletter of ORSSA/Nuusbrief van ONSA, May/Mei, 17-18. The committee consisted of Dr. H.S. Sichel (Chairman), Profs. G.J. Rudolph of Rhodes University, H.J. Venter of the University of Potchefstroom and C. Jacobs of the CSIR, and Messrs. H.I.D. du Plessis and J.W. Grobbelaar of Unisa, and Peter C. Pirow, R.T. Rozwadowski and J.C. Joslin of Johannesburg. ORSSA was then founded in Johannesburg on Thursday, 20 November 1969. About 150 individuals were present, coming from all parts of South Africa and the Rhodesia of that time (Zimbabwe). The following office bearers were elected in terms of the newly adopted constitution: Dr. H.S. Sichel (President), Mr. J.W. Grobbelaar (Vice- President), Mr. J.C. Joslin (Secretary), Mr. D.D. Masterson (Treasurer), Mr. M.C.F. (Mike) King (Editor), and Profs. G.J. Rudolph and C.G. Troskie (Additional Members).Grobbelaar, Jos. 1990. \\"Nog herinneringe uit die ou dae.\\" Newsletter of ORSSA/Nuusbrief van ONSA, July/Julie, 10-12.Pirow, P.C. 1969. Notule van vergadering gehou in die Dorothy Susskind Gehoorsaal om 4:00 nm. op Donderdag 20 November 1969. Johannesburg. The new society was privileged to get an excellent management team under the leadership of Dr. Sichel, who was known internationally for his work in mining statistics. Tom Rozwadowski was one of the main driving forces behind the founding meeting of ORSSA, and he also made major contributions at the founding meeting itself. He worked for Control Data Corporation (CDC). In 1970 CDC transferred him to their head office in Minneapolis to enable him to work towards a Ph.D. in Computer Science. He and his wife and children went on a weekend outing to Annandale, near Minneapolis, where he was to address a meeting of the Roman Catholic Church on South Africa. Due to a tragic gas leak, the entire family died at their stopover place. At the Annual General Meeting of ORSSA in 1970 it was announced that in memory of him an annual Tom Rozwadowski Medal would be made available for a paper of outstanding merit delivered by a member of ORSSA [8].Anonymous. 1972. ORSSA/ONSA Newsletter/Nuusbrief, October/Oktober. This coveted and prestigious medal of ORSSA was first awarded in 1971, to Dr. Gerhard Rudolph. The Johannesburg Branch was the first chapter of ORSSA. A new Pretoria Chapter was founded on 19 March 1970. The Western Cape Branch was founded on 14 August 1972. Branch chairmen also served on the national Executive Committee of ORSSA. One of the main tasks of the Executive Committee in its first year was to decide on membership issues. By 16 June 1970 membership had been granted to 75 individuals, of which 47 were for full membership and 28 for associate membership. The second annual congress of ORSSA was held in November 1970 at Iscor in Pretoria, where Jos Grobbelaar was elected as the new President. The other members of the new Executive Committee were D.D. Masterson (Vice-President), Dr. H.S. Sichel (Past President), Dr. J.D. Roode (Secretary), Dr. G.J. Rudolph (Treasurer), M.C.F. King (Editor), and J. Buttery and J.C. Joslin (Additional Members). In the new term of office two new branch chairmen also served in the Executive Committee, namely Dr. D.M. Hawkins (Johannesburg) and Dr. R.J. van den Heever (Pretoria). Since 1969 the society has had the following presidents: Dr H Sichel (1970), Mr JW Grobbelaar (1971), Mr D Masterson (1972), Dr GJ Rudolph (1973), Mr J Miller (1974), Mr K Sandrock (1975), Mr HID du Plessis (1976), Mr R Eales (1977), Prof TJ Stewart (1978), Prof JS Wolvaardt (1979), Dr MJ Venter (1980), Dr AH Money (1981), Mr M Splaine (1982), Mr D Masterson (1983), Dr LP Fatti (1984), Mr DW Evans (1985), Mr MA de Vries (1986), Mr HW Ittmann (1987), Prof G Erens (1988-1989), Ms A Pachyannis (1990-1991), Mr LA Visagie (1992-1993), Ms E Ferreira (1994-1995), Dr E Dixon (1996-1997), Prof JW Hearne (1998-1999), Dr PduT Fourie (2000-2001), Mr HW Ittmann (2002-2003), Prof WR Gevers (2004-2005), Ms KM Harmse (2006-2007), Prof VSS Yadavalli (2008-2009), Mr DW Evans (2010-2011), Prof JH van Vuuren (2012-2013), Prof HA Kruger (2014-2015), Mrs WC Pelser (2016-2017), Dr D L√∂tter (2018-2019), Ms Gemma Dawson (2020-2021).  Governance  At a national level the Society is managed by an Executive Committee (EC), which is elected annually at an Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Society. The various members of the EC each have a specific portfolio for which they are responsible. The portfolios entail, inter alia, membership aspects, finances, the publications of the society, interaction with international societies, the different chapters of ORSSA, the website, etc. The EC consists of the following office bearers: (i) The President, (ii) The Vice-President (either elected to become the next President or The Past President who last held office), (iii) The Secretary, (iv) The Treasurer, (v) The Database Manager, (vi) The Marketing Manager, (vii) The Newsletter Editor, (viii) The Newsletter Business Manager, (ix) The Journal Editor-in-Chief, (x) The Journal Manager, (xi) The Webmaster, a number of elected Additional Members, all Chapter Chairpersons and possibly further individuals co-opted by the EC with the aim of performing specific tasks. In the larger centres of the country, activities of the Society are arranged by regional chapters. Currently the Society consists of the following five regional chapters: * the Johannesburg Chapter, * the Pretoria Chapter, * the Vaal Triangle Chapter, * the Western Cape Chapter, and * the Kwazulu-Natal Chapter. Seminars, workshops and panel discussions are arranged by these regional chapters on an annual basis. Case studies, theoretical work, new technology, etc. are typically presented and discussed at these get-togethers. OR is, of course, the main subject at these events, but topics in specific related areas of interest, such as statistics, decision support systems, expert systems, the management sciences and industrial engineering, are also covered.  Membership  ORSSA has about 350 members - individuals (students, professors and researchers from university and research institutions, as well as professionals from industry) and corporate affiliates. The society offers the following membership grades: Student, Full, Fellowship, Retired, Honorary life as well as Corporate membership. The first two membership grades are open for application by individual persons. The Corporate membership is open for application by companies or institutions. The third and fifth membership grade are by invitation only, and finally, a full member may apply for retired membership status.  Publications  ORiON is the official scholarly journal of ORSSA and has been published biannually since 1985., ORiON journal website, retrieved 2016-07-20. The journal enjoys accreditation by the national Department of Education and hence qualifies for government subsidies to authors employed by academic institutions. An interesting mixture between theoretical and applied work is published in ORiON, which welcomes contributions in the following four broad categories: * new OR-related theory or methodologies, * success stories in OR, * OR case studies, and * OR methodological reviews. Members of the Society automatically receive paper copies of this journal. The Society also publishes a quarterly Newsletter., ORSSA, retrieved 2016-07-22. Apart from snippets of OR-related news, general OR articles and advertisements which are of interest to members, notices of forthcoming activities and reports on recent conferences are contained in the Newsletter. News items from the EC meetings and OR umbrella-organisations, such as IFORS and EURO, may also be found in the Newsletter. In 2019, the book Operations research in South Africa: The first 50 yearsKruger HA & Van Vuuren JH (Eds), 2019. Operations research in South Africa: The first 50 years, African SunMedia, Stellenbosch, 1028 pp., was published by the Society, with editors Prof JH Van Vuuren and Prof HA Kruger. Both Van Vuuren and Kruger are Fellows of ORSSA, an award given to members of ORSSA who served the Society or the science and profession in an exemplary manner over a considerable period of time. The volume contains a concise history of operations research in South Africa from its local inception during the late 1950s until 2018. It is both a comprehensive record of the activities of the Operations Research Society of South Africa during its first fifty years of existence and a compendium of operations research as practised locally in the public, private and tertiary education sectors.  Conferences  A national conference is organised by the Society at different venues annually, usually during the month of September, to serve as a forum for communication about OR. An international expert or a prominent local operations researcher is usually invited as the keynote speaker. This is the premier annual meeting of the Society, and apart from a rich and varied programme of presentations by both practitioners and academics, the conference usually also boasts a very enjoyable social component.  Awards  The Society awards a number of prizes and awards annually to recognise outstanding achievements in the field of Operations Research. The Tom Rozwadowski medal is the Society's premier award and has been awarded on an almost annual basis since 1971. The medal is awarded for the best written contribution to Operations Research published by a member of the Society during the previous year. The nominating committee invites nominations or submissions for consideration for this award. The Executive Committee may also invite long-standing full members of the Society to become Fellows of the Society. These would include individuals who have served the Society in an exemplary manner for a considerable period of time, or who have served the science and profession of Operations Research over a considerable period of time. The Society also makes recognition awards to individuals who have served the profession of Operations Research in an exemplary fashion. A recognition award is a prestigious distinction and is reserved only for outstanding achievements and/or contributions typically over a long period of time. The Society also hosts two student competitions on an annual basis. Tertiary institutions may nominate candidates, based on a written Operations Research project of Honours or Masters (or similar) level. These projects are evaluated by a panel of experts, and then a cash prize is awarded to the winner at the annual conference each year. Nominations usually close around June. In 2019, the Society hosted its first science communication competition. Entries consist of three-minute science communication videos based on a research project, and are evaluated by a panel of experts. Cash prizes are awarded to the top two each year. The top 5 video's are available on ORSSA's YouTube channel. Gunther Husselmann, Dirk Human and Timothy Whitehead were the top three awarded in the first competition hosted.

Early life Beaver Henry Blacker was born in Dublin on 31 May 1821, the eldest son of Latham Blacker, and a grandson of the historian and priest George Miller (1764-1848), author of the 1832 work History, philosophically illustrated. Blacker was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, where he was the three-time recipient of the vice- chancellor's prize for English prose, and from where he received his B.A. degree in 1843, and his M.A. in 1846. Family Blacker married Isabella Rutherford in Ireland in 1850.Ireland Marriages 1619-1898 Transcription. Retrieved 21 July 2016. In 1855 he married Sophia Eliza O'Reilly in Monkstown, Dublin.Ireland Marriages 1619-1898 Transcription. Retrieved 21 July 2016. There were children from both marriages. Career Blacker was curate- in-charge of Donnybrook, in County of Dublin, from 1845 to 1856. In 1857 he was appointed to the vicarage of Booterstown, in Dublin; where he oversaw several improvements to St. Philip and St. James Church in Booterstown, and to the rural deanery of South Dublin in 1862. He resigned both positions in 1874 upon his retirement to England. Between 1847 and 1854 he published several theological pamphlets, but his first topographical work was his Brief sketches of Booterstown and Donnybrook, in the County of Dublin, with notes and annals, issued in four parts between 1860 and 1874. A separate 186 page Annals of the parishes was appended to the descriptions of the four churches of Booterstown and Donnybrook. In England, Blacker was curate-in-charge of Charlton Kings, in Gloucestershire, in 1875-76, and senior curate of Cheltenham, in 1876-78. He lived for three years in Stroud and moved to Clifton in 1881. Gloucestershire Notes and Queries It was in Clifton that Blacker began researching and editing Gloucestershire Notes and Queries, and collecting materials for a bibliography of Gloucestershire, as well as copying monumental inscriptions in local churches and contributing to the Dictionary of National Biography, for which he wrote more than 60 articles which he signed as B.H.B. His Gloucestershire Notes and Queries originally appeared in the columns of the Stroud Journal and its popularity there led to its publication in 48 parts from April 1879 to October 1890. In the preface issued with the 48th part which completed the fourth volume, Blacker, writing as the editor, asked for further support to enable him to continue the work, describing it as not a \\"profitable speculation\\", but a \\"labour of love\\" in archaeology. The preface was written at the beginning of October 1890, and Blacker's health began to fail shortly after, leading to his death at Clifton on 11 November 1890. He was interred in Deans Grange Cemetery in Dublin on 19 November.

Training is primarily geared towards the staff of Inuit communities in Canada's far north. Since its inception, the work of the Nunavut Municipal Training Organization (MTO) has evolved into three core activities; Training Programs, Program Development/Enhancement, and improving municipal operations in Nunavut's 25 communities. The training itself is divided into three main categories: the college-accredited Municipal Government Program through the Nunavut Arctic College, Protection Services training, and community-targeted training courses.  History  In 2002, the new territory of Nunavut was just three years old and beginning to discover the infrastructure needed to maintain 25 municipalities. The Nunavut Association of Municipal Administrators (NAMA) and the Government of Nunavut's Department of Community Government & Transportation created a steering committee which began the work of developing structures, courses, budgets and protocols to meet the training needs identified by municipalities at the time. The resulting recommendations led to the incorporation of the MTO as a legal non-profit society in February 2003.  Mandate  The MTO's mandate since its inception has been To identify, develop and implement training programs that will improve the performance of municipalities through training, education and professional development.  Governance & Oversight  The MTO membership is made up of each senior administration officer from Nunavut's 25 municipalities. At the annual general meeting each fall, the membership elects members to the MTO board of directors. The Government of Nunavut appoints two members to the board as well. The full-time executive director reports to the MTO board, and supervises MTO staff and operations. The current president is Steve England; senior administration officer with the Hamlet of Arviat.  Training  = Municipal Government Program = The Municipal Government Program (MGP) was launched in September 2004 as part of the Nunavut Arctic College's 2004/05 school year. This program consists of numerous single credit courses delivered in a blended format (some online courses, some face-to-face courses). Completion of five core courses and an additional five courses in any specialty stream (Finance, Senior Administration Officer, Works Foreman, Recreation Director, Office Administrator, Bylaw Officer, and Lands Officer) will lead to a Diploma in Municipal Government from the Nunavut Arctic College. As part of its strategy to increase participation in these college- accredited courses, the MTO Board authorized the issuance of 1,500 aeroplan miles to each MGP course participant in 2016/17. = Protection Services = The MTO provides all firefighter training for municipal fire departments through practical, kinaesthetic, face-to-face courses which incorporate the principles of Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit (IQ). The MTO also provides comprehensive Ground Search & Rescue training for local search & rescue groups. The courses were designed to meet national standards but have been modified extensively to incorporate local knowledge and community elders often participate in order to pass along knowledge. The MTO is a partner of the Canadian Red Cross and has trained community members to teach First Aid & CPR in Inuktitut for both community members and municipal staff. = Targeted Training = Each year municipalities submit a Training Needs Assessment where they request courses, training or professional development specific to their community. Therefore, the MTO offers a plethora of Targeted Training courses from Inuktitut-As-A-Second Language training, to road dust suppression training, to Zamboni operations, to Bronze Medallion courses for lifeguard training, to Class 3/Airbrakes, to Heavy Equipment Operator Training. All courses incorporate a cultural component to ensure relevance with the students being instructed.  Partnerships  The MTO receives core funding through the Government of Nunavut's Department of Community & Government Services. However, the legal status of the school allows private partnerships that will further the MTO's mandate. In the past, the MTO has partnered with the following organizations, departments, agencies or associations to offer additional training opportunities for Inuit: * Government of Nunavut Departments of: ** Economic Development & Transportation ** Health ** Justice ** Education ** Culture & Heritage ** Environment * Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency (CanNor) * Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC) * Nunavut Tunngavik Inc (NTI) * Qikiqtani Inuit Association (QIA) * Kitikmeot Inuit Association (KIA) References Organizations based in Nunavut ","title":"Nunavut Municipal Training Organization"},{"id":"51119782","text":"It's Not Me, It's You is an album by Lily Allen It's Not Me, It's You may also refer to: *\\"It's Not Me, It's You\\" (song), song by Skillet *It's Not Me, It's You (game show), British comedy panel game show *It's Not Me, It's You!, book by Jon Richardson *\\"It's Not Me It's You\\", 2001 song by Prozz√§k See also *It's not you, it's me, a popular phrase *Not Me (disambiguation) ","title":"It's Not Me, It's You (disambiguation)"},{"id":"51119798","text":"Cortinarius atroviolaceus is a fungus native to Borneo, where it was originally collected by E.J.H.

Stollenwerk collaborated with Saint Arnold Janssen and Blessed Hendrina Stenmanns and co- founded the Missionary Sisters Servants of the Holy Spirit. Pope John Paul II presided over the beatification celebration for Stollenwerk in 1995 after naming her a Servant of God on 2 April 1982 and as Venerable in 1991. Life Helena Stollenwerk was born on 28 November 1852\\"Our Roots\\" Holy Spirit Missionary Sisters -USA to Hans Peter Stollenwerk and his third wife Anna Bongard (b. 1827). Her sole sibling was Caroline (1855 - 13 August 1859). Her father died on 27 May 1859. On 24 November 1860 her mother married Hans Peter Breuer. Breuer had three daughters by his first marriage, and the youngest became a close friend of Helena. Her childhood saw her occupied with the thought of joining the missions and going to China. She tried to find a convent that sent missionaries around the world, but her search was in vain. In 1882 she met Arnold Janssen who was in the Netherlands at the time and he supported her idea of the establishment of a new religious congregation of dedicated women. For a time she served in the kitchen of Janssen's \\"St. Michael the Archangel Mission House\\" in Steyl. In 1884, she was joined by Hendrina Stenmanns. On 8 December 1889 Stollenwerk became of postulant of a women's congregation esrablished by Janssen, the Missionary Sisters Servants of the Holy Spirit, and on 17 January 1892 assumed the religious name \\"Maria Virgo\\". She made her vows on 12 March 1894 and later became abbess on 12 August 1898. Stollenwerk also had a hand in preparing sisters that went out on missions across the globe; she sent the first missionaries in 1895 to Argentina and others to Togo in 1897. At Janssen's request she resigned from being Superior General on 8 December 1898 having been in that position since 1890. In autumn 1899 she was diagnosed with meningitis. She died in 1900 and her final words were \\"Jesus: I die for You\\". Her remains were transferred on two occasions in 1907 and 1915 and for a final time in September 1934. Veneration The cause for canonization commenced in 1950 in Roermond in an informative process that had been assigned the task of collecting available documents and interrogatories pertaining to her life and her time as a religious. Her writings received theological approval on 28 February 1983 from the Congregation for the Causes of Saints. The official start of the cause came on 2 April 1982 after Stollenwerk was titled as a Servant of God. The Positio was submitted to Rome for their assessment in 1985 and the theologians voted in favor of the continuation of the cause on 23 October 1990 while the C.C.S. themselves likewise approved the cause on 26 March 1991. This allowed for Pope John Paul II to confirm her life of heroic virtue on 14 May 1991 and name Stollenwerk as being Venerable. The miracle required for her beatification occurred in 1962 and was investigated before being sent to Rome for greater examination; the C.C.S. validated the diocesan process of the alleged miracle on 31 May 1991 and passed it to a team of medical experts for their approval on 17 June 1993. A group of theologians also approved the cause on 26 November 1993 and the C.C.S. gave their assent as well on 18 January 1994.

PinpointBPS is a methodology for process improvement in laboratories. It is underpinned by eight principles that form the basis for decision-making in a laboratory. While its application is mainly in healthcare ‚Äî particularly medical laboratories ‚Äî it has also been applied in other industries. The methodology has been heralded as \\"groundbreaking\\" in the field of laboratory performance improvement.  Overview  Medical laboratories operate in highly regulated environments that demand consistent quality of patient outputs. The external environment‚Äôs impact on the broader global healthcare industry is also dictating the need for ongoing improvements in quality and delivery while using fewer resources that leads to cost savings. Among other regulations, the Carter Report in the United Kingdom dictates that GBP¬£200-million in cost savings must be achieved by 2020, while the Affordable Care Act in the United States, also known as Obamacare, imposed further taxation requirements on medical laboratories, reducing cost saving ability. Dr. Jonathan Berg stated at The Royal College of Pathologists' annual meeting in 2012 that \\"We need to be creative and innovative in the services we offer, and we need to get our finances under control\\", indicating the critical need for innovation within pathology and a stronger focus on financial controls and performance. Within this context, PinpointBPS was founded as a methodology focusing on innovation, risk reduction and financial impact relating to laboratory performance improvement.  Methodology  The PinpointBPS methodology is centered on the following process of discovery that highlights current performance, expected future performance and the means to achieve it. The methodology has also been aligned with ISO 15189 requirements. = The PinpointBPS Methodology = The steps below provide a high-level overview of the methodology in practice.  1. Focus on quantified value  While all effort within the laboratory is put into value creation, from turnaround time improvements to quality output and cost savings / profit increases, it is important that the performance of each of these can be quantified and their relationship with the financial performance of the laboratory understood. This enables the laboratory to understand current performance needs while at the same time establishing the key performance indicators that are important and should be measured.  2. Determine current performance  Understanding the current performance of the laboratory provides the necessary context to highlight performance improvement requirements as well as areas of excellence. This should be conducted by looking at sample turnaround time and resource utilization, and should be considered on a holistic basis, creating a virtual model of the whole laboratory by mapping out all processes and activities in detail. This provides an end-to-end perspective on current performance and forms the basis for future performance improvement initiatives.  3. Understand future performance  The expectation for future performance should be done through business process modeling, with current performance as the foundation. Using LIS data as well as data from workforce scheduling, and combining this data with the process model of the laboratory, creates an environment where changes to the laboratory can be simulated and the impact to performance understood in quantifiable terms. It is important to validate both the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the model. Once a desirable outcome for future performance has been found, the difference (or delta) in performance is evaluated to understand future performance requirements.  4. Establish performance delta and requirements  The difference in performance between current (baseline) and future (expected) performance highlights the necessary process changes and related initiatives that are required to achieve the future performance. This impact should be measured according to finance (cost or profit), quality and turnaround time. For these changes to take effect, each change initiative is prioritized based on a quantified understanding of its impact to the laboratory 'bottom line', while also improving turnaround time, quality or both. = Comparison with Lean = While the PinpointBPS methodology can support Lean (and other continuous improvement methodologies like Six Sigma) in that it ultimately aims to provide patients and other stakeholders with quality outputs, its approach differs from other methodologies like the Lean Laboratory in various ways: * While lean focuses on waste and the elimination thereof, PinpointBPS focuses on understanding process and the impact of changes to processes on value while reducing risk. * The definition of success differs in its layers of ambiguity. The focus of lean is to achieve \\"the happy situation of perfect value provided with zero waste\\", while PinpointBPS aims to establish a quantified definition of future value ‚Äî \\"facts and figures, no fluff\\". * Lean has evolved from the manufacturing approach first designed by Toyota in the 1950s, while PinpointBPS has been specifically developed for use in pathology performance improvement. * Lean allows for the focus and treatment of individual or isolated performance issues, while PinpointBPS motivates for a system-wide approach first by creating visibility and testing. * Prioritization in Lean is done according customer priority or on a FIFO (first in, first out) basis, while PinpointBPS encourages prioritization according to expected, quantified output linked to cost reduction or profit generation.  PinpointBPS in Practice  PinpointPBS has been based on eight practical principles that allow laboratories to take ownership of the methodology and performance improvement initiatives. = The 8 Principles =  1. Boost the bottom- line, or bust  As with any organization, value creation is the ultimate goal, however purely focusing on quality output may neglect cognizance of financial value. Understanding the ultimate financial impact of any value creating activity is critical for ongoing sustainability.  2. Led by a common language  Ensuring that everyone in the organization (and value chain) has the same understanding of value creation and how it links to financial performance Continuous innovation requires us to draw from the same knowledge and speak the same language. We establish a universal truth that enables us to work together seamlessly.  3. Trust the transparency  We value a clear line of sight into our strengths, our weaknesses and the connections between every process, person, and piece of technology.  4. Facts and figures, no fluff  We believe in making decisions based on evidence. In our quest for bottom-line impact, every business action must be supported by real, tangible proof.  5. Driven by decisiveness  We are empowered through understanding our performance and what shapes it. This allows everyone in our organization to make decisions swiftly, with understanding and certainty.  6. Inaccuracy is inexcusable  Close is not close enough. Every decision we take is based on fact, and our execution must be accomplished with the same precision  7. Big impact beats small  We believe in following the big opportunities that significantly impact the bottom line, rather than wasting time and resources on those that do not.  8. Knowledge knows no bounds  We are only as good as the collective we represent. We fundamentally believe in continually imparting knowledge and learning from each other to move the industry forward.  Tools  Various tools have been developed to enable the methodology in laboratories, including performance overviews, standardized process mapping using BPMN (business process model and notation), as well as simulation and scenario modeling.  Professional certification  PinpointBPS professional certification can be granted to both laboratories that practice the methodology, as well as people who have successfully completed further study of the methodology. Two levels of PinpointBPS professional certifications exist. These certifications have been accredited by PACE, CPD, and the Royal College of Pathologists. = Champion = A PinpointBPS Champion is a professional who is able to interpret laboratory performance improvement metrics, map out all processes within a laboratory and make improvement recommendations. = Master = A PinpointBPS Master builds on the PinpointBPS Champion certification and is a professional who is able to simulate changes to a laboratory and interpret performance outputs, to make performance improvement recommendations and manage initiatives from start to end.

During their first season together the big three averaged a combined 47 points with Tim Duncan leading the way averaging 23.3 points, along with Tony Parker's 15.5 points and Manu Ginobili's 7.7 points. As the big three continued, so did their contributions to the team. Ginobili had the biggest jump in points of the big three as he averaged more than five points more than he had the previous season. Before the season, David Robinson announced he was planning to retire at the end of the season, signifying a transition from the \\"Twin Towers\\", a nickname given to the duo of Duncan and Robinson. The new \\"Big Three\\", along with some help from David Robinson, assisted the Spurs to an NBA-best 60‚Äì22 record and home-court advantage throughout the entire playoffs. In their first series, the Spurs defeated the Phoenix Suns in six games, setting up a second-round match-up with the Los Angeles Lakers. Having lost their last two postseason games to the Lakers, the Spurs and The Big Three were looking to avenge their previous losses against The Los Angeles Lakers. In Game 6, Duncan posted 37 points and 16 rebounds, as The Spurs won with a 110-82 victory and winning the series. Following the game, Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich said: \\"I thought in Game 5 and Game 6, he [Duncan] was astounding in his focus. He pulled everyone along these last two games.\\" Tony Parker and Manu Gin√≥bili, the other two members of the \\"Big Three\\", were also playing throughout the series. After moving past the Lakers, the Spurs defeated the Dallas Mavericks in a six-game series in the Western Conference Finals to advance to the 2003 NBA Finals. The finals featured several performances from Duncan, who averaged 28 points and 16 rebounds and was named Finals MVP. In Game 6, Duncan recorded a triple-double, as the Spurs were able to close out the series and secure the \\"Big Three's\\" first NBA title. Following the NBA Finals victory, Duncan said: \\"We were all confident that something would happen, that we would turn the game to our favor, and it did.\\" Duncan also expressed sadness over the impending retirement of his friend and teammate David Robinson. However, his remaining teammates, Ginobili and Parker, appeared poised to fill the void left by Robinson. Both made contributions in the series, as Parker averaged 16.3 points for the series while Ginobili added 9.7. Following their championship, The San Antonio Spurs faced a team overhaul; veterans David Robinson, Steve Kerr, and Danny Ferry retired, while Stephen Jackson and Speedy Claxton left for free agency. However, the Spurs were able to address these absences in free agency by signing Rasho Nesterovic, Hedo T√ºrkoƒülu and Robert Horry. =2003-2004 season= Despite changes to the team, The \\"Big Three\\" and the Spurs made it to a 57‚Äì25 record, finishing one game behind the Minnesota Timberwolves for the Midwest Division title and the best record in the Western Conference. Their strong regular season play secured them a trip to the NBA Playoffs and a first-round match-up with the Memphis Grizzlies. The Spurs promptly swept the Grizzlies and advanced to a fourth consecutive conference semifinal match-up with the Los Angeles Lakers. The Spurs and the Lakers split the first four games of the series with the home team winning every game. In Game 5, Duncan continued to play in the series, making a jump shot with 0.4 seconds remaining to give the Spurs a 73‚Äì72 lead. However, with a fraction of a second left on the clock, Derek Fisher hit a buzzer-beater to give the Lakers a 74‚Äì73 win. After The Spurs defeat in Game 5, The Spurs lost Game 6 to the Lakers 88‚Äì76, and were eliminated from the playoffs. =2004-2005 season= The following season, the \\"Big Three\\" played in this series and contributed with points as the Spurs were able to make it to a Southwest Division title with a 59‚Äì23 record, securing the second seed in the Western Conference.
