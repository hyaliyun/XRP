The American Civil War is a popular point of divergence in English-language alternate history fiction. The most common variants detail the victory and survival of the Confederate States. Less common variants include a Union victory under different circumstances from in actual history, resulting in a different postwar situation; black American slaves freeing themselves by revolt without waiting for Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation; a direct British and/or French intervention in the war; the survival of Lincoln during John Wilkes Booth's assassination attempt; a retelling of historical events with fantasy elements inserted; the Civil War never breaking out and a peaceful compromise being reached; and secret history tales. The point of divergence in such a story can be a \\"natural, realistic\\" event, such as one general making a different decision, or one sentry detecting an enemy invasion unlike in reality. It can also be an \\"unnatural\\" fantasy/science fiction plot device such as time travel, which usually takes the form of someone bringing modern weapons or hindsight knowledge into the past. Still another related variant is a scenarios of a Civil War that breaks out at a different time than 1861 and under different circumstances (such as the North, rather than the South, seceding from the Union). American Civil War alternate histories are one of the two most popular points of divergence to create an alternate history in the English language, the other being an Axis victory in World War II. Depictions of the later development of a victorious Confederacy vary considerably from one another, especially on two major interrelated issues: the independent Confederacy's treatment of its black population and its relations with the rump United States in the North. Scenarios * The South wins the Civil War, and slavery still exists as of the present time of the story. Examples include the 2004 mockumentary C.S.A.: The Confederate States of America, the United States is annexed by the Confederate States and slavery continues until the present, including a depiction of \\"an electronic slave auction\\" carried on via the internet. * The victorious South ends slavery, such as in Hallie Marshall: A True Daughter of the South (1900) by Frank Williams, the earliest known Civil War alternate history, in which the Confederacy won by mobilizing black slaves to its army, their participation turning the tide at Gettysburg. Thirty years later, the independent Confederacy is full of happy, well-treated black slaves feeling perfectly content under the benevolent, paternalistic planters, comparing favorably with the rump United States, which is torn by a brutal class struggle, with nominally-free factory workers protesting inhumane working conditions or starving in unemployment. In Gray Victory, set in the immediate aftermath of the war, the Confederacy is faced with both subversion by Northern Abolitionists and the increasing organization and assertiveness of Black Southerners, and the story gives the clear impression that no matter who wins, the end of slavery is inevitable. * Slavery ends in the South in name only, or minorities are oppressed into low socio-economic parts of society, such as in The Guns of the South, freeing the slaves is attributed to Robert E. Lee, who becomes the second Confederate President. It is logical to assume that his prestige would have run high and made him a plausible candidate to succeed Jefferson Davis, but the position he would have taken regarding slavery is the subject of some debate. However, ending slavery would not necessarily provide equality for Black Southerners, and Bring the Jubilee has blacks, despite Lee's grand gesture, remain disenfranchised into the 20th century, as are people from Latin America, who are annexed by the Confederacy and its immigrant population. The rump United States is completely broken down by its defeat and becomes an impoverished and backward country while the Confederacy goes on to annex everything to its south as far as Tierra del Fuego (except the Republic of Haiti) and become a major world power. In Harry Turtledove's Southern Victory series, it is President James Longstreet who frees the slaves from being property, as a prerequisite for retaining British and French support for the Confederacy in the Second Mexican War, but blacks remain an underclass that is very oppressed and discriminated, denied basic civil rights, and is not even allowed to have surnames. In later volumes of the series, the blacks burst out in a brutal armed revolt, called the Red Rebellion during the Great War, which are met with equal brutality from white authorities, which make them the target of a terrible Holocaust-like genocide. * A more optimistic result in The Guns of the South and several other works have both nations settle down and have reasonably-good neighborly relations within a few years of the war's end and, in some cases, agree to reunite as one nation after 50 or 100 years of being apart. If the South Had Won the Civil War by MacKinlay Kantor has reunification come later: in the 20th century, the United States, the Confederate States and Texas, which seceded from the CS, become economically integrated and in both World Wars and all fight against Germany as close allies. After World War II, all three all feel threatened by Soviet missile bases and armored brigades in Alaska, which was never purchased from Russia. Therefore, they announce a formal reunification in 1961, on the precise centennial of Fort Sumter. Conversely, a GURPS game setting book presents a 1993 in which the US and the CS still watch each other warily across an armed border that stretches to the Pacific. * In Southern Victory, the US and the CS develop into hereditary enemies that go to war again every decade or two, spend the rest of the time preparing for new war, and become entangled in webs of worldwide military alliances. Southern Victory has both drawn into the worldwide war that immediately follows the Archduke's murder. They open an American front of trench warfare that is every bit as terrible as the one in Europe. Conversely, the 1914 of \\"A Hard Day for Mother\\", in Alternate Generals 1 by William R. Forstchen, sees an amicable treaty of reconciliation and voluntary reunification between the two nations. Fiction =Novels= * Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter, by Seth Grahame- Smith, recasts the Civil War as a war on vampires that use slaves as a food source. The novel was later made into a film of the same name. * \\"Beyond the Wildest Dreams of John Wilkes Booth\\" by Jay Winik, first printed in What Ifs? of American History, a scenario in which Booth assassinates not only Lincoln but also Andrew Johnson and William H. Seward. * Bring the Jubilee by Ward Moore * Britannia's Fist (trilogy) by Peter Tsouras. Britain and France enter the War in 1863 when British-built warships enter the Confederate Navy, instead of being seized by British forces before they could service, as really happened. * By Force of Arms, Rebel Empire, Reaping the Whirlwind, and Flags & Honor by Billy Bennett. A series of books focusing on a victorious CS that has won the Civil War after the Battle of Gettysburg and its subsequent conflict with the US under William Tecumseh Sherman in the Second American Civil War with aid from the French Empire, war with Spain over the territory of Cuba in 1895 called the Spanish‚ÄìConfederate War, and an alternate World War I between the \\"Continental Entente\\" (the Confederate States and the French Empire) against the \\"Grand Alliance\\" (the United States and the British Empire). * Confederate States: What Might Have Been by Roger L. Ransom. * Crosstime Traffic series by Harry Turtledove visits many alternate realities and briefly mentions a few in which the South won the Civil War. The fourth volume, The Disunited States of America, focuses on an alternate reality in which the adoption of the Articles of Confederation resulted in the dissolution of the United States by the 1800s. There were frequent small localized wars between states (such as Ohio versus Virginia, Massachusetts versus Rhode Island) but no single massive civil war. * The Difference Engine by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling. In an alternate reality in which Charles Babbage successfully develops an analytical engine by 1824, Britain interferes in North American affairs to prevent the rise of the United States as a world power. By 1855, the Confederate States had seceded from the Union with other breakaway states including a Texan Republic, a Californian Republic and a Communist Manhattan Commune; there is also a Native American-dominated terra nullius in the Great Plains. * Dirk Pitt series: Volume 11: Sahara by Clive Cussler. The series's recurring macguffin in which the heroes discover an astounding secret history, involves the Lincoln assassination in this one. It is a brief side plot that is only tenuously related to the main adventure and is completely left out of the film adaptation of the novel. * 1862 by Robert Conroy. After the Trent Affair, the British Empire joins the Civil War on the side of the Confederacy. * If the North had Won the Civil War by Andrew J. Heller Set in an independent CSA in the Twenty-First Century, it is the story of a professor at a Southern college who writes an alternate history wherein the North wins the Civil War, instead of the South, as in his own timeline. In the Confederacy, Blacks are non-citizens confined to Preserves and live in primitive conditions. The other half of the novel contains the professor's alternate history of the Civil War. * Fire on the Mountain by Terry Bisson. Instead of a Civil War breaking out between North and South, there is a massive successful slave revolt in the Deep South, with blacks creating their own separate nation called \\"Nova Africa,\\" which leads to Socialist revolutions in France, the United States, Ireland, and Russia. * \\"The Forest of Time\\" by Michael F. Flynn. A war among the Thirteen Colonies directly follows the American Revolution, resulting in a stillborn United States and a perpetually-balkanized North America. * Gettysburg: An Alternate History by Peter Tsouras.

President-elect Lincoln is assassinated in 1861, and a version of the Crittenden Compromise is adopted preventing the Civil War from occurring. Slavery thus continues in four southern states (the \\"Hard Four\\" comprising Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and a united Carolina) to the present. The title refers to the secret network assisting escaping slaves, updated from the Underground Railroad. The protagonist is a black US Marshal who is forced to work tracking down runaway slaves. * War Between the Provinces series by Harry Turtledove. This fantasy allegory of the Civil War is set in imaginary countries with recognizable analogous characters, such as King Avram, General Bart, and General Hesmucet. =Short stories= * Alternate Generals, volume 1, contains three US Civil War-related stories:  \\"The Charge of Lee's Brigade\\" by S.M.

A Southern-dominated United States fights the New Englanders for two years resulting in a Union victory, with the New England states readmitted and President Stephen A. Douglas passing the Civil Rights Act of 1861, which abolishes slavery and grants freedmen the right to vote.  \\"Now Falls the Cold, Cold Night\\" by Jack L. Chalker focuses on a scenario in which former President Millard Fillmore on the Know Nothing Party is elected the 15th President in 1856 after James Buchanan suffers a stroke in October. Fillmore upholds the fugitive slave laws in 1858, which results in ethnic tensions and riots in New England and causes it to secede from the Union. John C. Fr√©mont becomes President of the New England Confederacy with William Tecumseh Sherman as his commanding general, opposed by the Army of the United States under Robert E. Lee.  \\"Lincoln's Charge\\" by Bill Fawcett focuses on Douglas becoming President of the United States. In both Roberts' and Chalker's entries, the North seek to secede from the Southern-dominated Union. * Dixie Victorious: An Alternate History of the Civil War by Peter Tsouras. The anthology of various Civil War/Confederate victory has ten alternate history scenarios, written by various authors.  \\"Hell on Earth\\" by Andrew Uffindell focuses on an Anglo-French intervention on the side of the Confederates against the Union because Albert of Saxe-Coburg dies in a carriage incident before he could handle the Trent Affair between American and Britain. It worsens with the wounding of Thomas Fairfax and the death of two British citizens as well as a successful St. Albans Raid in 1861 and a harsh ultimatum to the Lincoln administration.  \\"Ships of Iron and Wills of Steel\\" by Wade G. Dudley focuses on a Union victory at the Battle of Hampton Roads and a Confederate counterblockade with resources properly-allocated to the Confederate Navy.  \\"What Will Our Country Say?\\" by David Keithly focuses on Lee not losing the famous Lost Orders during the Maryland Campaign.  \\"When the Bottom Fell Out\\" by Michael Hathaway focuses on a financial crisis and collapse of the Union economy in 1862, coupled with a Southern victory in Maryland.  \\"We Will Water Our Horses in the Mississippi\\" by James R. Arnold focuses on Albert Sidney Johnston surviving his wound at the Battle of Shiloh thanks to a torniquet applied to him and going on to face Ulysses S. Grant in the Vicksburg Campaign.  \\"Absolutely Essential to Victory\\" by Edward G. Longcare focuses on JEB Stuart's cavalry not riding around the Army of the Potomac and staying with Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia.  \\"Moves to Great Advantage\\" by John D. Burrett focuses on Braxton Bragg fired from the Army of Tennessee and replaced by James Longstreet after the Battle of Chickamauga.  \\"Confederate Black and Grey\\" by Tsouras focuses on the Confederacy accepting Patrick Cleburne's proposal to use black slaves and to free blacks in the Confederate Army as soldiers.  \\"Decision in the West\\" by Cyril M. Lagvanec focuses on the Trans-Mississippi Theater of the Civil War for the Confederacy in which there is a different depth of a sandbar, coupled with the disastrous Red River Campaign.  \\"Terrible as an Army with Banners\\" by Kevin F. Kelley focuses on Jubal Early succeeding in his raid on Washington, DC, as a result of the United States Marine Corps loosening on him, which allows him to break the Siege of Petersburg. * \\"East of Appomattox\\" (in Alternate Generals III) by Lee Allred. In the late 1860s, the CS sends Ambassador Lee to London to assure continued British recognition, and he finds unexpected challenges and even more unlikely allies. * If It Had Happened Otherwise (1931) anthology contains two relevant entries: \\"If Lee Had NOT Won the Battle of Gettysburg\\" by Winston Churchill, and \\"If Booth had Missed Lincoln\\" by Milton Waldman. * \\"If Grant Had Been Drinking at Appomattox\\" by James Thurber. Inspired by the above book, the wrong man surrenders. * In \\"If President James Buchanan Had Enforced the Law,\\" by Joseph Edgar Chamberlin, President Buchanan fully enforced federal law upon South Carolina's succession stopping the civil war. * If the South Had Been Allowed to Go by Ernest Crosby. Another early Civil War alternate history written in 1903. * \\"If the Lost Order Hadn't Been Lost: Robert E. Lee Humbles the Union, 1862\\" by James M. McPherson, first printed in What If? and reprinted in What Ifs? of American History, a scenario posited by McPherson that focuses on the Lost Order staying in Confederate hands, allowing the South to advance to Pennsylvania and to win an alternate version of the Battle of Gettysburg, resulting in the death of George B. McClellan and Braxton Bragg and Edmund Kirby Smith winning and taking over Kentucky during the Heartland Campaign. The decisive victory allows the Copperheads to win the 1862 legislative elections, coupled with Britain and France recognizing the new nation. Lincoln and his cabinet are thus forced to issue a proclamation to recognize the Confederacy as a sovereign, separate nation by New Year's Eve 1863. * If the South Had Won the Civil War by MacKinlay Kantor, originally published in Look Magazine in 1960 and published as a book in 1961 * A Rebel in Time by Harry Harrison * \\"Must and Shall\\" (collected in the anthology Counting Up, Counting Down, also in Volume 32 of the Nebula Awards series) by Harry Turtledove * \\"The Lincoln Train\\" by Maureen F.

History In the mid-1920s, Kern County decided to build a structure that would showcase both products and innovations from the county. Although it would be the headquarters of the Kern County Chamber of Commerce, the building would be constructed by the county government. A site on Chester Avenue near the Kern River, which the county already owned, was selected. The location was chosen, in part, for two primary reasons: Chester Avenue was the route for U.S. Route 99 (Golden State Highway), the main highway connecting northern and southern California, and the site was adjacent to the Kern County Fairgrounds. The building was designed by Charles H. Biggar in 1927 and completed in 1928, but the official opening was not until September 29, 1929. In 1945, the Kern County Museum opened. It utilized a small portion of the Chamber of Commerce building. The museum became very popular, and the amount of artifacts on display continued to increase. By 1952, the museum was large enough that the Chamber of Commerce would move out of the building to a location in downtown. The museum would occupy the rest of the space. The structure was also converted to the museum's needs.

Kern County Museum. Accessed: 04-13-2011. In 2010, the building would undergo a major restoration effort. The goal was to restore the building to its original condition in 1928. The mezzanine was removed and the underlying paint was used to match the original color. The fluorescent lighting was replaced with chandeliers. The windows were reopened and museum sign was removed. In addition, the building exterior would return to the original multicolor paint scheme (at some point the build was painted completely white). The exhibits inside were removed and relocated to other parts of the museum. The hall is now rented for events.

Early years Ziegler was a student at the Institut de Science Politique. Studying under the direction of Professor Nicolas Grimal, she is a graduate of Paris-Sorbonne University. She began studying Egyptology with a thesis on the Queen Tiye, wife of Amenhotep III. Ziegler's internship was at the Louvre's Department of Oriental Antiquities. Career Ziegler started her career as a high school teacher. She began working at the Louvre in 1972 and her archaeological research at Saqqara began in 1991. She is the author of numerous important scientific articles and books about Egyptology. She has also authored translations of ancient letters from Egypt and Nubia as well as several books on History of Egyptian Art. In particular, she has studied the monuments of the time of the pyramids of Ancient Egypt (hieroglyphic inscriptions, statues, paintings and reliefs of the tombs), the various components of the site of Saqqara, metal arts from the Pharaonic period (bronze and silver) and has written a monograph devoted to Queen Tiye, wife of Amenhotep III. A long-time Egyptian archaeology professor at the Ecole du Louvre, Christiane Ziegler also co-directs the department of Egyptian Archaeology. Since 1991, she has headed the archaeological mission from the Louvre Museum at Saqqara on the \\"North of the Unas Causeway\\" under the Supreme Council of Antiquities. In 1993, she was named chief curator of the Louvre's Department of Antiquities. During the period 1994‚Äì2004, she was director of the Research Unit Louvre, whose work focuses on the Theban region. While her mission's initial purpose was to locate the mastaba of Akhethetep, it also located two other Old Kingdom mastabas, many burials dating to the Twenty-sixth through Thirtieth dynasties, as well as Coptic settlements. During which time she excavated and wrote a book on the Tomb of Akhethetep, paying particular attention to its reliefs. A team led by Ziegler was responsible for finding hundreds of mummies in an underground maze of caves, most likely an ancient multifamily cemetery, crammed into shafts and corridors at Saqqara. Ziegler has curated major exhibitions, notably \\"Origins of Writing\\" (Grand Palais, 1982) \\"Tanis, the gold of the Pharaohs\\" (Paris-Grand Palais Edinburgh, 1987‚Äì1988), \\"Memoirs of Egypt\\" (Paris-Berlin, 1990), \\"Egyptomania\\" (Paris, Ottawa and Vienna, 1994‚Äì1996), and \\"Egyptian Art in the Age of the Pyramids\\" (Paris-New York- Toronto, 1999‚Äì2000). For her exhibition \\"The Pharaohs\\" (Venice-Paris-Madrid- Bahrain-Valencia, 2002‚Äì2007), Ziegler curated 300 masterpieces of ancient Egypt, brought together for the first time, to be viewed from two perspectives; on the one hand being powerful, monumental images, as they are best known, and, secondly, as the human person who recognized himself as a divine intermediary. The display in the National Museum of Bahrain, which featured 120 objects, was designed by Cairo-based architect Agnieszka Dobrowolska. According to Ziegler, the 2008 \\"Queens of Egypt\\" (July‚ÄìSeptember 2008, Grimaldi Forum, Monaco) exhibition is the first to be devoted entirely to Egypt's queens while also being unique in the number and quality of the assembled pieces from some of the world's greatest museums. She is preparing an international exhibition at the site of Saqqara, planned for 2011‚Äì2012. Ziegler is a member of numerous learned societies. These include the International Committee of UNESCO for the new museums in Aswan and Cairo, the Scientific Council of the Institut Fran√ßais d'Arch√©ologie Orientale, the Commission on excavations of the Department of Foreign Affairs of the German Archaeological Institute, and Vice President of Friends of Museums in Egypt. She sits on the scientific board of Agence France-Mus√©ums in charge of the program Louvre Abu Dhabi, and participates on the board of the National Museum of History and Art. Awards Ziegler is a recipient of the Gaston Maspero Lifetime Achievement Award awarded by the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles- Lettres. She is a 2008 recipient of the prestigious L√©gion d'honneur and Commandeur de l'Ordre national du M√©rite awards.

History Documentary records for Burneside Hall extend to 1290, when a property was owned on the site by Gilbert Burneshead, the Under-Sheriff of Westmorland.Jones, p.5. Richard Bellingham, a member of an influential Northumberland family, married Burneshead's daughter, acquiring the site.Jones, p.6. Burneside Hall in its current form was originally built in the second half of the 14th century by the Bellingham family.Emery, p.198. The medieval heart of Burneside Hall was a pair of pele towers, linked by a large, open hall.Emery, p.197; Pettifer, p.268. Only one of these towers still remains, three storeys tall but badly ruined, measuring 20 feet by 35 feet (6 metres by 11 metres).Emery, p.197. This tower was originally the buttery and pantry, forming the service end of the castle.Pettifer, p.268. A two-storey gatehouse at the front of the property was built in the late-16th or 17th century, with a relatively substantial barmkin wall, 6 feet (2 metres) thick in places, erected around it.Emery, p.198; Pettifer, p.268. The original open hall was converted into smaller rooms in the 17th century, and additional windows added.Emery, p.197. The second tower was of similar height to the first, but narrower; it was rebuilt in the 18th century and effectively destroyed.Emery, p.197.Emery, p.197. A 2019 dendrochronological analysis report for Historic England dated 39 timbers from the hall. Dates ranged from timber felled in 1422, with the bulk of the dated timbers, mostly used in the hall roof, being felled between 1579 and 1604. Later timbers in the building date from between 1612‚Äì37 and 1605‚Äì30.  Ownership  The Bellinghams remained the owners until Burnaldeshede 'Castle' was seized by the King in 1461, when Henry Bellingham was attanted for treason, and it was held by the Parr family until Bellingham's general pardon in 1480. During the 1530s it was sold by the Bellinghams to Sir Thomas Clifford, and passed from him to John Fitzwilliam, who in 1552 sold it to John Machell of Kendal and London (Sheriff of London 1555-6).William Farrer & John F. Curwen (editors), 'Strickland Roger', Records relating to the Barony of Kendale: volume 1 (1923), pp. 265-275. His heirs sold it to the Braithwaite family, who retained it for the next seven generations.Jones, p.6., reciting from Sir Daniel Fleming of Rydal's MS \\"Description of the County of Westmorland AD 1671\\" (Bodleian), see Sir George Floyd Duckett (ed.), Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and Archaeological Society, Tract Series Vol. I (London 1882), pp. 13-14. During the early 17th century it was the home of the poet Richard Brathwaite. The second tower was rebuilt in the 18th century and effectively destroyed in the process. In the late 19th-century, Stephen Brunskill inherited the property and conducted some restoration work on the medieval parts of the property.Jones, p.6. Today Burneside Hall is a Grade II* listed building and scheduled monument; as of 2014, Historic England (then known as English Heritage) considered the Burneside Hall pele tower to be formally at risk of slow decay. The Hall is part of a working tenanted farm.

It is the first in his World of Tiers series. Plot summary The story follows Robert Wolff, a man disenchanted with his life and his marriage. One day, while looking at a new house, Wolff discovers a strange horn in the basement. Blowing the horn, Wolff is transported to a strange new world, the World of Tiers. Wolff finds himself initially in an edenic paradise known as Okeanos. This region is the first level of the planet, which contains a number of tiers like a wedding cake, separated by vast mountain ranges. The entire planet is ruled over by a cruel and mysterious lord named Jadawin, who created it. Okeanos consists of a beach, an ocean, and a small forest and is populated by nymph like humans who originated in and near ancient Greece. In this new world, Wolff regains his youth and vigor and falls in love with a local woman named Chryseis who lived in Troy at the time of the Trojan War. When Chryseis is kidnapped, Wolff follows after her, climbing to the next level of the world, Amerind, a plains region populated by Native Americans and centaurs. Along the way he is joined by the adventurer Kickaha, who had also come from Earth, where he was known as Paul Janus Finnegan, some time ago. The two continue their adventure as they ascend the various levels of the World of Tiers including the medieval Dracheland and the jungle Atlantis. When they finally make it to the palace of Jadawin they make a shocking discovery; Robert Wolff is Lord Jadawin, who lost his memory after being defeated by another lord, and ended up stranded on Earth. At the end, Wolff/Jadawin is reunited with Chryseis and restored to his rightful place as ruler of the World of Tiers, his experiences as a human on Earth having tempered his previous cruelty.

The unit was invented by Bill Tolhurst (a former president of the National Police Bloodhound Association) while working for the Niagara County Sheriff's Department. Several law enforcement agencies have bought scent transfer units. The device works by vacuuming an odour from a desired object onto a sterile gauze pad placed over the air intake. The resulting scent pads can either be given to a tracking dog, used in a 'scent lineup', or preserved in a freezer. Tolhurst has claimed that evidence pads can be stored successfully in a frozen state for more than 11 years. Although the reliability of scent evidence in general has been called into question, certain experiments have demonstrated successful use of scent transfer units.

SW1 consist of six residential buildings and four commercial towers with retail nodes. Design Landscape architects Gamble McKinnon Green designed the ground floor atmosphere to resemble the surroundings of a rainforest oasis. Fern trees have been planted along the pedestrian pathways and green vines climbs the wall of the A1. According to the architects, the ground plane is crucial as it has to attract people to walk through the space. A long pedestrian spine divides the buildings and allows the sun to penetrate at the urban square which is also along the thoroughfare. The pedestrian spine aims to connect the sense of open space in between the buildings and so that the surrounding buildings will not give a sense like the block is a block by itself but rather an open space block. Sustainability Like other buildings located at the SW1, the A1 is given a 5stars rating for its energy efficiency under the Australian Building Greenhouse Rating (ABGR) scheme.

It is located on the corner of City Rd and Cleveland St in Chippendale, just south- west of the city centre. The building was designed by architectural firm Allen Jack+Cottier and was opened in 1975. Internal refurbishments were carried out in 2000, designed by Lahz Nimmo Architects. As well as the public performance areas, the building provides accommodation for the Department of Music at the University of Sydney.  History  Sydney businessman, Everest York Seymour, died in 1966 and left a significant bequest for ‚Äò...the construction of a building to serve as a centre for the cultivation, education and performance of musical and dramatic arts...'. The University of Sydney became the trustee of this bequest, and Allen Jack+Cottier were commissioned to design a performing arts centre to be known as The Seymour Centre.  Performance venues and facilities = The York Theatre = The York is the largest theatre in the centre, with seating for 780 patrons . It has a Thrust stage configuration, with seats in a semi-circular, amphitheatre-style arrangement and is used for drama and musical performances, and spoken-word events. = The Everest Theatre = The Everest theatre is an end-stage theatre, seating up to 605, depending on configuration. It was designed for musical performances and includes a variety of acoustic features to manipulate and control sound quality, but is also used for theatrical and dance performances. = The Reginald Theatre = The Reginald Theatre, previously known as the Downstairs Theatre is a smaller, informal Studio theatre, seating up to 200, with a wide variety of uses. = The Sound Lounge = An intimate cabaret style venue for up to 120, which serves light meals and refreshments. = Restaurants and Bars = Refreshments are available on each level, including a coffee cart in the main foyer. A BBQ also operates in the front courtyard opposite the main entrance, from one and a half hours prior to selected shows.  Program  Each year the Centre presents a wide range of performing arts productions and events; plays host to a number of festivals; provides an education program; presents children's theatre and produces dance, theatre and music productions. The Seymour enjoys a high public profile within Sydney, with a good central city location and parking facilities. Festivals which program events at the Seymour centre include the Sydney Festival, the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, the Sydney Children's Festival, the Sydney Fringe Festival and the Sydney Comedy Festival. The program is an eclectic mix of self-produced work, co-productions and hires of the venue, and includes theatre, gigs, dance pieces and showcases. The University of Sydney student revues are held at the Seymour each year, as well as many end-of-year dance school concerts. The centre hosts family and kids' shows each school holiday, and has recently commenced a comprehensive primary and secondary education program, featuring workshops and Q&As; to augment the students' experience of the theatre. The Wiggles performed in this centre during their December 1996 concerts shown on their first concert video: \\"Wiggledance!\\".

The hut lies in a narrow defile between the H√∂llental-Blassen and Waxenstein-Riffelwand crest and is open from the end of May to mid- October. It has more than 80 bedspaces. Its predecessor, with 80 bedspaces, was demolished in September 2013 in order to make way for an entirely new hut. It was built in 2014/15 and opened on 23 August 2015.  History  The category 1 hut was built in 1894 and has had its present appearance since 1925 when it was extended. Since 2004 a completely new hut has been in planning. The cost of construction has been assessed by the German Alpine Club at ‚Ç¨2.3M. The new hut is intended to take the extreme avalanche situation in the H√∂llental into account. The winter room was closed by the authorities in 2004 or 2005 due to the avalanche danger in winter. The demolition of the old hut began in autumn 2013. To adapt the new hut to today's ecological standards, a hydroelectric turbine got installed replacing the previously used diesel generator. Further, sewage water will be treated in a newly constructed plant. The new hut opened in August 2015. As part of the complete demolition the blockhouse, which is the original core of the hut, was initially moved to the grounds of the Alpine Museum in Munich, rebuilt and furnished with historical artefacts and, in March 2017, opened to the public.Neustart im Museumsgarten.

Over a professional career that spanned more than seven decades, and three continents, Kagan was active not only in the field of architecture and design but also as a writer, translator, lecturer and political activist. Early life and training Born in St Petersburg, Kagan was the son of Abraham S Kagan (rus. –ê–±—Ä–∞–º –ö–∞–≥–∞–Ω; 1889 - 1983) - a university lecturer/publisher and a school teacher. As a young child, Anatol witnessed the atrocities of the Russian Revolution, which aroused a deep concern for social justice that would remain with him for the rest of his life. In 1922, Kagan's father became one of many intellectuals to be exiled from the new Soviet Union aboard the so- called Philosophers' Ships. The family settled in Berlin, where Kagan's father re-established his publishing business and Kagan himself commenced his architectural studies at the Technische Universit√§t Berlin. Completing his Diploma of Architecture in 1937, Kagan found himself unable to obtain work in Berlin, as he was a foreigner. This, coupled with the increasingly unstable political situation in Germany at the time, prompted the family to leave Berlin. Intending to emigrate to Australia, Kagan travelled to Melbourne via London, where he worked for a few months in an architect's office. His parents and younger sister settled in the United States, and Kagan would not see them again until 1962. Architectural career After arriving in Melbourne in 1939, Kagan worked in the offices of several prominent architectural firms of the day, including Hugh & Arthur Peck, Seabrook & Fildes, Joseph Plottel, and Geelong-based firm of Buchan, Laird & Buchan. By 1942, he had commenced his own private architectural practice in partnership with a friend and fellow Russian emigre, Yuri Blumin. Their firm, styled as Blumin & Kagan, undertook several projects, including a box factory and an apartment block, that were published in contemporary books and journals. However, the promising partnership ended prematurely when wartime building restrictions brought Australia's construction industry to a virtual standstill. Kagan then entered the government sector, working for the Department of Works & Housing on the design of military camps. He was subsequently involved in the development of the Beaufort House, a prototypical steel dwelling that was designed by architect (and one-time employee of Walter Gropius) Arthur Baldwinson. After the War, Kagan decided to recommence his private practice with his former government colleague, Albert Young together with his erstwhile pre-war partner, Yuri Blumin, and Blumin's army friend William Millar. The practice specialised in large luxurious residences for wealthy businessmen, many of whom were members of Melbourne's thriving post-war Jewish emigre community. It was such links that led to Kagan being selected as design architect for the new campus of Mount Scopus Memorial College in Burwood. In 1957, Kagan participated in the competition for the Sydney Opera House, which he prepared during a brief stay in that city. While his entry was unplaced, his drawings were later displayed as part of an exhibition to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the competition in 2007. As the only surviving competitor from the original competition at that time, Kagan spoke briefly at the opening of the exhibition, and recorded an audio guide that explained the philosophy behind his own entry. By 1960, Kagan had tired of designing luxury houses for moneyed businessmen. Wishing to create buildings that might have a more profound impact on society, he took a position with the Public Works Department in Sydney, where he was involved in the design of high school buildings and, later, mental hospitals. He remained employed there until his retirement in 1973. Political activist Kagan's left-wing political leanings were heavily influenced by the circumstances of his early life and upbringing: witnessing the Russian Revolution and its aftermath during the late 1910s, his family's expulsion from Russia in the 1920s, and the discrimination of Nazi regime in Berlin in the 1930s. As a teenager, Kagan read the works of Leon Trotsky and subsequently embraced socialist thinking. After settling in Australia, Kagan became associated with the Sydney-based Balmain Trotskyists, led by Nick Origlass, and would remain a member of the Australian Labor Party for the rest of his life. To honour his contribution and dedication in the party, he was awarded life membership of ALP in 1994 and, after his death, his family received personal message of condolence from three one-time Labour Prime Ministers: Paul Keating, Kevin Rudd and Bob Hawke.

It has, however, been included in most subsequent reissues of the album. Background The song was written from the point of view of a patient who has just undergone an eye transplant and discovers that he has received the eyes of the executed double murderer Gary Gilmore. Gilmore had requested that his eyes be donated to science after his execution as \\"they'd probably be the only body part usable\\".

High flow nasal cannula is a good treatment option for COVID-19. Heart Lung. 2020;49(5):444-445. doi:10.1016/j.hrtlng.2020.03.018. A relevant parameter is the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). Medical uses  High-flow therapy is useful in patients that are spontaneously breathing but have an increased work of breathing. Conditions such as general respiratory failure, asthma exacerbation, COPD exacerbation, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and congestive heart failure are all possible situations where high-flow therapy may be indicated. HHHF has been used in spontaneously breathing patients with during general anaesthesia to facilitate surgery for airway obstruction. =Newborn babies= High-flow therapy has shown to be useful in neonatal intensive care settings for premature infants with Infant respiratory distress syndrome, as it prevents many infants from needing artificial ventilation via intubation, and allows safe respiratory management at lower FiO2 levels, and thus reduces the risk of retinopathy of prematurity and oxygen toxicity. Due to the decreased stress of effort needed to breathe, the neonatal body is able to spend more time utilizing metabolic efforts elsewhere, which causes decreased days on a mechanical ventilator, faster weight gain, and overall decreased hospital stay entirely. High flow therapy has been successfully implemented in infants and older children. The cannula improves the respiratory distress, the oxygen saturation, and the patient's comfort. Its mechanism of action is the application of mild positive airway pressure and lung volume recruitment. = Benefits = HFT, the clinician can deliver higher FiO2 to the patient than is possible with typical oxygen delivery therapy without the use of a non- rebreather mask or tracheal intubation. Heated humidification of the respiratory gas facilitates secretion clearance and decreases the development of bronchial hyper-response symptoms. Some patients requiring respiratory support for bronchospasm benefit using air delivered by HFT without additional oxygen. HFT is useful in the treatment of sleep apnea. During use of HFT the patient can speak. As this is a non-invasive therapy, it avoids the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia in situations where it can supplant the use of a ventilator. Use of nasal high flow in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure does not affect mortality or length of stay either in hospital or in the intensive care unit. It does however reduce the need for tracheal intubation (by 15%) and escalation of oxygenation and respiratory support. However, the certainty that this result is reliable is low, as different studies were less precise than they could have been. People on nasal high flow feel more comfortable, less breathless, and there was little evidence of harm.  Mechanism Oxygenation is achieved by providing an increased FiO2 in the air flow to the patient. The constant flush of the upper airway creates a reservoir that reduces room-air entrainment to such an amount that it becomes a true fraction of inspired oxygen as set by the device. =Ventilation = Through a nasal cannula a high-flow system delivers flows that approach (and can meet) total respiratory demand.. This flow, being delivered though a small diameter delivery system and small-bore nasal cannula allows the flow that would traditionally move slowly through the upper airway to move quickly and maintain a constant stream of fresh gas which effectively washes out upper airway dead space. (Review). This constant stream of fresh gas flow creates an environment that assists exhalation effort by flushing the exhaled air out to maintain this reservoir of fresh air ready to be inhaled. = Humidification= The higher the flow, the more important proper humidification and conditioning of the flow becomes. Without humidity, the oxygenation and ventilation effects of high-flow therapy would be quickly overcome by the negative impact that dry air has on lung tissue.  History  Nasal cannulae used for medical gas delivery are usually limited to delivery of 1‚Äì6 liters of flow per minute. The percent oxygen inhaled by the patient (FiO2), usually ranges roughly 24‚Äì35% as the pure oxygen delivered from the cannula is diluted by entrainment of ambient air (21% oxygen). Flow rates for delivery of oxygen using typical nasal cannula are limited because medical oxygen is anhydrous, and when delivered from a pressurized source the gas cools as it expands with the drop to atmospheric pressure. Delivery of cold dry gas is irritating to the respiratory mucosa, can cause drying and bleeding of the nasal mucosa and can increase metabolic demand by cooling the body. Even with quiet breathing, the inspiratory flow rate at the nares of an adult usually exceeds 12 liters per minute, and can exceed 30 liters a minute for someone with mild respiratory distress. Traditional oxygen therapy is limited to six liters per minute, does not begin to approach the inspiratory demand of an adult, and therefore the oxygen is diluted with room air during inspiration. Prior to the advent of HFT, when increased FiO2 was required for respiratory support; special face masks or intubation was required. With High Flow Therapy, the goal is to deliver a respiratory gas flow volume sufficient to meet or exceed the patient's inspiratory flow rate. The gas is heated and humidified to condition the gas as increased flows would be detrimental to tissue if left dry and cool. HFT, a source of oxygen is usually blended with compressed air. Hospitals usually have compressed oxygen and air available for therapeutic use. This allows the delivery of air or blends of air and oxygen with the use of an oxygen blender. The gas is then heated, generally to about 37 ¬∞C, and humidified to near 100% RH using a humidifier. The gas is transported to the patient through a heated delivery tube to prevent cooling and condensation of the water vapor that has been added to the respiratory gas(es). HFT requires the use of nasal cannulae and a system designed to deliver high flow rates and the pressure generated to do so. At the same time the nasal cannula must be small enough that they do not occlude more than 50% of the nares, as this allows flow to have multiple points of exit for a continuous airway flush effect.  Commercial developments  Vapotherm introduced the concept of heated humidified high flow therapy via nasal cannula in 1999 after being originally developed for use in race horses. * References Medical equipment Respiratory therapy Mechanical ventilation ","title":"Heated humidified high-flow therapy"},{"id":"31499481","text":"Police Review (also known as Jane's Police Review) was a weekly magazine for police officers in the United Kingdom, latterly published by Jane's Information Group.

It is an exceptionally short river, with a length of only 1 mile/1.6 kilometres long. It is formed when two rivers, the Ogney Brook and the Hoddnant converge south of Llantwit Major. Its valley, the Cwm Col-huw, is a Scheduled Ancient Monument - it was used in the Dig for Victory campaign in World War II. Ogney Brook The Ogney Brook flows at Llantwit Major's western boundary. The Ogney Brook is one of the two rivers that join to form the Col-huw. Its total length is over 1 mile long, and it flows along the western fringes of Llantwit Major. Its source is just northwest of the town. In 1998 the brook flooded, causing significant damage to 9 properties and a pumping station. Hoddnant The Hoddnant near the village of Boverton The Hoddnant is the larger of the Col-huw's tributaries. It is two miles long and is formed at Llanmaes, at the confluence of the Llanmaes Brook and the Boverton Brook. In days gone by, the Hoddnant's name was translated into English, and it became known as the Merryvale, or Merry Brook. =Boverton Brook= The Boverton Brook is the smaller of the Hoddnant's two tributaries. It does not run through Boverton per se; by then it has merged with the Llanmaes Brook to form the Hoddnant. The Boverton Brook flooded significantly in the 1998 floods, causing damage on 31 October that year to 11 properties and an electricity sub-station. =Llanmaes Brook= A photo of the Llanmaes Brook taken after snowfall. The Llanmaes Brook is the longest section of the Col-huw watercourse. Its source is over a kilometre north of Llantwit Major. The Brook flows in a southeastern direction through the town of Llanmaes, joining the Boverton Brook by a railway in northeast Boverton. Like many other small Welsh rivers, the Llanmaes Brook caused damage and flooding in the 1998 floods; in Llanmaes a total of 7 properties were disrupted, and the floodwaters also caused havoc as they flooded the properties downstream. Areas of Llanmaes are still susceptible to flooding today.Llanmaes Mouth The river meets the sea at Col-huw Point, where Llantwit Major beach is situated. At its mouth the river flows through the sand and stones of Llantwit beach. The mouth of the river was originally sandy, but dredging in the Bristol Channel and thus degradation of the Nash Bank, have meant that less and less sand lies around the estuary. Defences to keep dissipating sand in place were installed at the river's mouth, which can be seen behind the boulders. Remains of a small port have been discovered roughly 200 metres out to sea from the beach. It lay at the historical mouth of the Col-huw, like several other such settlements in South Wales. Radiocarbon dating of its remains have been dated as between 1400 and 1600. The port was destroyed when the surrounding land began eroding and receding. A flat area below the cliffs that went out a long way, but became submerged. It is assumed that due to this, the river, along which goods could be transported all the way upstream to Llantwit, silted up and became the mere stream it is today.

His studies focused on changes throughout various cultures over time; he saw great importance in empirical research and made his reports as detailed as possible. Spier‚Äôs early years were spent studying the many diverse areas of anthropology ranging from archaeology to physical anthropology. His main interests were studying human relations and analyzing cultural processes among Native American groups. As a teacher, Spier was greatly admired by his students because he was extremely successful in passing along his methodological techniques for gathering exact data. Spier is remembered best for his explanatory studies and widespread fieldwork of cultural groups.\\"Viking Awards 1960.\\" American Anthropologist, 63(4): 835‚Äì837.

Background Leslie Spier was born in New York City, New York on December 13, 1893. He was one of four children born to Simon P. Spier and Bertha Adler Spier. In 1920, Spier married Erna Gunther; Gunther was a fellow anthropology student at Columbia University. After graduating and receiving their degrees, Spier earned his Ph.D. while Gunther received her Masters, the newly married couple moved to the University of Washington. The couple had two children, Robert and Christopher. In 1927, Spier and Gunther separated, divorcing a few years later in 1931. In the same year following his divorce, Spier remarried; his new wife Anna H. Gayton was also anthropologist.Harry W. Basehart and W. W. Hill, \\"Obituary: Leslie Spier, 1893‚Äì1961,\\" American Anthropologist, 67(5): 1258‚Äì1277. During his childhood and teenage years, he received his education through the New York public school system. As an undergraduate, he attended the College of the City of New York, graduating in 1915 with a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering. Despite earning a degree in engineering, he had developed a strong interest in anthropology and was accepted into graduate school at Columbia University; he graduated with a doctorate in anthropology in 1920. His years at Columbia would prove be extremely fulfilling, allowing him to study under the famous anthropologist Franz Boas. Boas was a strong influence on Spier; the techniques and methods he learned guided Spier‚Äôs anthropological work throughout his entire career. Employment history Spier began his career in the field of anthropology before he had acquired a college degree. In 1913, he was assigned to be an assistant anthropologist with the New Jersey Archaeological and Geological Survey. While studying at Columbia as a graduate student (1916‚Äì1920), he was employed as an assistant anthropologist at the American Museum of Natural History. After graduating with his Ph.D. in 1920, Spier began his teaching career, which he continued until his retirement in 1955. He taught at many institutions throughout his career, staying the longest at the University of Washington (1920‚Äì1929), Yale University (1933‚Äì1939), and the University of New Mexico (1939‚Äì1955). He taught at several other universities as well including the University of Oklahoma (1927‚Äì1929), the University of Chicago (1928 and 1930), and Harvard University (1939 and 1949). In addition, Spier was a visiting professor for summer courses at Columbia University (1921, 1923, 1925, and 1932), the University of California, Berkeley (1924, 1925, 1927, 1932, 1933, and 1948), and at the University of California, Los Angeles (1947). Spier, along with Melville Jacobs, was responsible for creating the anthropology department at the University of Washington.University of Washington Department of Anthropology, \\"Welcome.\\" University of Washington, 2004. In 1945, while at the University of New Mexico, Spier founded the Southwestern Journal of Anthropology; by this time, the university was employing six faculty members in the anthropology department.University of New Mexico Department of Anthropology, \\"Our History.\\" University of New Mexico, 2008. Research Early in his career, Spier was involved in many research projects in the Northeast United States including in his home state of New York, and in New Jersey and Delaware. In the time period between 1916 and 1935, Spier dedicated at least part of every year to field research. He was a research assistant at Yale University in 1932 and 1933 and at the University of California from 1960 to 1961. The greater part of Spier‚Äôs research involved detailed investigations into the life and cultures of Native American groups‚ÄîZuni, Klamath, Havasupai, Wishram, Kiowa, and various others. He was interested in analyzing the origins and distributions of these groups across North America. His research led to many important discoveries for the application of anthropology, first in archaeology and later in ethnology. Archaeology Even though Spier‚Äôs main research focus was in ethnology, he started his career in anthropology through archaeological studies. Spier, along with other archaeologists such as Nels Nelson, Clark Wissler, and A. R. Kroeber, created new seriation-based chronologies for the American Southwest.Clive Gamble, \\"Seriation Dating.\\" Archaeology: The Basics 2nd Edition, 2008: 64. In 1918, during his time working with the New Jersey Archaeological and Geological study, he published one of his most important works in archaeology‚ÄîThe Trenton Argillite Culture.Regna Darnell, Frederic Wright Gleach, \\"Leslie Spier 1943.\\" Celebrating a Century of the American Anthropological Association: Presidential Portraits, 2002: 101‚Äì104. From the collected data on the \\"argillite culture,\\" Spier determined that this culture did not exist. He combined his knowledge of statistical analysis with the archaeological deposits, concluding that the artifacts were present due to natural geological changes in the area.Leslie Spier, \\"New Data on the Trenton Argillite Culture.\\" American Anthropologist, 18(2): 181‚Äì189. Another well known archaeological publication by Spier concerns the Zuni; in his research with Zuni groups, Spier demonstrated his use of seriation to chronologically order site deposits. In conjunction with Kidder‚Äôs seriation, Kroeber‚Äôs ranking and concurrent variation, and Nelson‚Äôs stratigraphy, Spier was helping develop fundamental methods in archaeological theory that are used to this day.Walter W. Taylor, \\"Leslie Spier, 1893‚Äì1961.\\" American Antiquity, 1963: 379‚Äì381. Through use of these procedures, Spier was able to determine that the Zuni culture was a continuation of the earliest cultures of the same area.Leslie Spier, \\"Zuni Chronology.\\" Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 1917: 280‚Äì283. Ethnology Spier‚Äôs main anthropological interest was ethnographic studies, especially of American Indians. His favorite ethnological courses to teach were those concentrated on the Southwest, the Great Basin, the Plains, and California. Spier‚Äôs previous anthropological experience made him well-suited for ethnographic studies; he completely immersed himself in the culture he was studying, acquiring the language, learning cultural customs, and bringing a new awareness to an otherwise unknown group of people. He conducted many ethnographic studies among Native American populations; for Spier, it was crucial to gain knowledge and evidence about these cultures before they became extinct. From the 1910s to the 1930s, he studied Zuni, Havasupai, Kiowa, Wichita, Wishram, Klamath, and numerous other groups. Spier‚Äôs personal interest in gathering firsthand knowledge of American Indian cultures shaped his place in the ethnographic world. His interest in Native American cultures led him all across the United States, but a majority of his research is based in the western areas of the country from California to the Great Basin, and everywhere in between. Spier studied extensively on the complex ceremonial sun dance performed by the Plains Indians. He looked closely into the lifestyles of the native cultures, taking detailed inventory of housing, clothing, economy, etc., and created a detailed account of how the cultural system worked and prospered. Spier‚Äôs ethnographic studies went far beyond descriptions; he frequently compared the cultural systems over a surrounding area in order to gain a deeper understanding of the people he was studying. Awards and honors In 1919, Columbia University awarded Spier the Cutting Travelling Fellowship; in 1923, Spier was awarded a National Research Council Fellowship. Spier was presented with the Townsend Harris Medal in 1946 and the Viking Fund Medal and Award in 1960. Throughout his career, Spier was affiliated with many professional and honorary societies. He was president of the American Anthropological Association in 1943, American Anthropologist editor from 1934 to 1938, and vice-president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1943 and 1946. He first became a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1946; in the same year, he became part of the American Philosophical Society. In 1960, he became an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland. He was also recognized as a member of the Andean Institute, the Society for American Folklore, and Sigma Xi. Selected works *Spier, Leslie. An Outline for a Chronology of Zuni Ruins.

He was among the first sports photographers to use remote controlled cameras for unique camera placements, and was \\"a pioneer in the use of motor-driven camera sequences, slit cameras and double-shutter designs to show athletes in motion.\\"\\"John G. Zimmerman, 74, Leader Of Action Sports Photography\\". The New York Times, 11 August 2002 Early life and early career Zimmerman was interested in photography from an early age. His father, John L. Zimmerman, a gaffer at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, taught him the basics and bought him a 4√ó5 view camera. He joined a photographic hobby club in junior high school and spent afternoons developing film with friends in their mothers‚Äô kitchens. Zimmerman took a three-year photography course at John C. Fremont High School in Los Angeles, where he was taught by Hollywood cinematographer Clarence Bach.Sports Illustrated After graduating high school, Zimmerman was a Navy photographer. In 1950, he landed a job as a staff photographer at the Time bureau in Washington D.C. On his first assignment on November 1, 1950, Zimmerman was driving away from the White House with a group of photographers when two Puerto Rican nationalists stormed nearby Blair House, attempting to assassinate President Truman. Hearing gunshots, the photographers rushed out of the car. Zimmerman had a camera around his neck where as the others had locked theirs in the trunk. Zimmerman got the first photos of the attack,Boston Globe which were published in both Time and Life. In 1952, Zimmerman moved to Atlanta. During his time there he shot a series of noteworthy assignments for Ebony depicting the experiences of African Americans in the Jim Crow South and the Midwest.Google Books, Ebony MagazineSmithsonian Magazine By 1954 he had moved to Detroit and was freelancing for Life. One assignment required him to document Detroit's old Mariners' Church being moved to a new location across town. The building's move took four weeks to complete, yet Zimmerman's photo gives the effect of the church hurtling through downtown Detroit at top speed.Moving Mariners' Church, Life Magazine The use of technology to show on film what the naked eye could not see would become a hallmark of Zimmerman's work. Sports Illustrated, 1956‚Äì1963 Zimmerman's approach caught the eye of Gerald Astor, Picture Editor of the newly founded Sports Illustrated. Astor hired Zimmerman in 1956 as one of the magazine's first staff photographers. Zimmerman helped make the magazine a vanguard of innovative sports photography. He was among the first to use remote controlled cameras for unique camera placements, and was \\"a pioneer in the use of motor-driven camera sequences, slit cameras and double-shutter designs to show athletes in motion.\\" Sports Illustrated photographer Walter Iooss recalled watching Zimmerman edit photographs of basketball player Wilt Chamberlain in 1961. ‚ÄúIt was the first time a photojournalist had placed a camera above the rim of a basket‚Ä¶it was like looking at something from another planet. It had never been done before. No one had seen the game from there.‚Äù Sports Shooter Tribute Sports Illustrated, \\"The Ubiquitous Hands of Mr. C,\\" February 5, 1962, pp. 28-35 By the time Zimmerman left Sports Illustrated in 1963, he had assembled a portfolio that showed all the elements of his unique photographic style. He had discovered new ways to portray his subjects, often stretching and blurring his images to show the athletes in motion.

The film starred Eleanor Boardman and Johnny Mack Brown. The story of The Great Meadow, written by Elizabeth Madox Roberts, is similar in theme to that of Drums Along the Mohawk by Walter D. Edmonds which was made into a 1939 film of the same name directed by John Ford.The American Film Institute Catalogue of films 1931‚Äì40 c. 1993 by The American Film Institute Plot The title background is a sculpture of an American frontierswoman, a child on her left arm and the barrel of a flintlock in her right hand. The picture is dedicated to the women of the wilderness, ‚Äúthe wives and sweethearts who endured martyrdom for love‚Äôs sake [and] lie quiet and unsung in the great meadow.‚Äù The fortitude of women is the focus of most episodes in the film. In 1777, on their farm in Albemarle County in the Piedmont of Virginia, the Hall family go about their routine, drawing water, feeding chickens, forging tools, plowing rocky hillsides. In the evening, Thomas Hall (Russell Simpson) reads the latest war news to his family‚Äîhis wife Molly (Sarah Padden), their grown son, Rubin (Guinn ‚ÄúBig Boy‚Äù Williams), their daughters Diony (Eleanor Boardman) and Betty (Anita Louise), and the youngest child, Samuel (Andy Shuford). Widow Sally Tolliver (Helen Jerome Eddy) also lives with them. They admire the exploits of young George Washington who has just captured Harlem Heights on Manhattan. No hands are idle. Rubin dips candles, Diony runs her spinning wheel, Molly works at her loom , Betty tends a pair of lambs and Sally knits. Young Samuel plays with his dog, and tried to get out of stretching deerskins out to dry in the morning; he wants to go hunting instead. His father reminds them that his mother can't make new hunting shirts for them out of wet hides. They are soon joined by a neighbor, Evan Muir (Gavin Gordon), who is clearly smitten with Diony. Evan impresses everyone with the success of his flour mill and of his farm, including 8 cows, ‚Äúnot counting the bull‚Äù and 24 hogs, ‚Äúnot counting the boar.‚Äù Diony teases that he'll have no trouble finding a woman to marry with that ‚Äúgrest Nosh‚Äôs Ark.‚Äù But Evan is soon upstaged by the arrival of Berk Jarvis (Johnny Mack Brown), with a token for Diony‚Äîa beautiful bird fan‚Äîand news of a meeting that night in the clearing to hear Daniel Boone (John Miljan) speak. Boone has come to recruit settlers for Kentucky. He describes it as the promised land, with ample game and lush meadows, with rich soil ‚Äúlike cream.‚Äù He will blaze the trail for them: Southwest to the Holston River and across the Blue Ridge to Mount Powell, from which they will see a white cliff, the gateway to Kentucky, then on to Fort Harrod and the great meadows. Inspired by this speech and ignoring the desperate warnings of Sally Tolliver, whose husband and children were killed by Indians, Berk, his mother Elvira (Lucille La Verne), his younger brother, Jack (William Bakewell) and several others, including Evan, volunteer. The next day, Berk asks Diony to come with him. He warns her it will be a hard life, but she says as long as she is with him she would choose no other. The group begins the more-than-500-mile trek to Kentucky on Berk and Diony's wedding day. Their trials begin with the deep grief of parting from family and friends, knowing that they will never meet again. Betty is distraught at losing her sister. Diony weeps, cradled in her mother's lap. Her heart is torn in two. Molly says women's hearts seem made that way. She thought she would be near Diony when she ‚Äúhad a wedded woman‚Äôs work upon her.‚Äù Diony laments that she has never been apart from her mother one night since the day she was born, and now they will never see each other again. ‚ÄúHard it is and bitter,‚Äù Molly replies. She has faced it twice, first when leaving her own Mammy to help make the land here, and now, is giving Diony. But people who are in each other's thoughts cannot be separated, and she will be thinking on Diony ‚Äúfor my whole enduring life.‚Äù Diony joins the waiting train. Thomas gives her two books and charges her to teach her children to read. Samuel, weeping, gives her his dog. Her mother gives her a case of needles and a bag of gourd seeds, ‚Äúthe use-fullest things next to bread.‚Äù Rubin almost forgets his gift, clutched in his hand, and runs after her; it appears to be a pair of gloves. Samuel's dog runs back to him. The journey takes much longer than planned as they wade through mud flats, travel up and down mountains and ford rivers. They lose stock, supplies and baggage‚Äîincluding Diony's books‚Äîenduring hunger, rockfalls and torrential rain. They fend off Indians, the women shooting ‚Äúrifles‚Äù side by side with the men, and Berk's brother is killed in one such attack. At last they struggle up and over Mount Powell in a thunderstorm, and Boone's landmark is in sight. After six months‚Äô journeying, the ragged survivors stagger into Fort Harrod. People pour out of the gates to welcome them, including the founder of the settlement, Jim Harrod (James A. Marcus) and a flock of women who know exactly what these people have experienced, because they have lived through it themselves, with arms outstretched to help and console the weary travelers. Eight months later, Diony and Elvira leave the fort to gather corn in their now-abundant fields. An Indian finds them, kills Elvira and scalps her, in front of Diony, before fleeing at the sound of gunshots... Berk and three other men are about to set out to get salt, necessary for the settlement's survival. [They say it is to prevent scurvy. Salt was and is indeed essential for life, but it was not historically a remedy for scurvy, so this mistake belongs to either the book or the script.] Berk and Diony's child will be born before the men return from the 4-month-long journey. Berk and Diony, who is still recovering from the shock of her mother-in-law's murder, talk about what she will tell their child, a strong boy to be named Tom. And indeed, when the men come back, Diony shows him his son. The community holds a jubilee to celebrate their return. The dance is interrupted by a cry warning that mounted Shawnee are attacking. Black Fox brandishes a length of hair and cries ‚ÄúSquaw Jarvis,‚Äù enraging Berk. Diony holds him back, but later, their cabin built and the crops in, Berk is driven to seek vengeance. Dione gets him ready... Months pass... A canoe pulls up to a riverbank and Berk gets out. He was captured by the Cherokee, sold to the British and imprisoned for a year. He has escaped and is striking out for Shawnee country, aiming to trap Black Fox... High in the mountains, Jarvis lures Black Fox out of camp. He seizes the warrior by the throat, strangling him so that he can't call for help. They fight and Jarvis wins, but two men who came out of the camp with Black Fox run to where Berk lies on the ground... It is winter and a blizzard rages. Diony tries to get out of the cabin to get help but the snow is too deep. She can't make it to the fort, and she can ‚Äúabide no more.‚Äù A fur-wrapped figure dragging a sledge behind him struggles to her door. It is Evan, come to help her and to tell her that there is news of Berk‚Äîthe Shawnee have killed him. Back in Albemarle, Hall is reading Diony's letter aloud to the family. She tells of how her skills with spindle and loom made it possible for her to make clothing out of nettles and buffalo hair and to teach other women to do the same. The next year she married Evan, and they do very well together. Her mother praises the Lord that Diony's hardships are over. In the cabin, Diony, with little Tommy standing beside her, welcomes Evan home. Meanwhile, a man on horseback stops at the gate in the palisade. It is Berk, come to the fort looking for Diony. He has kept alive all this time only for the sight of her. Diony is spinning and Evan is dipping candles. Berk halloos the cabin and immediately embraces Dione. It took him a year to escape the Shawnee; he has been gone more than two years. Although Berk says he doesn't blame anyone, a confrontation brews and when they start talking about whether they are going to fight with fists or cudgels, Diony stops them cold. She is not property to be fought over. According to the law of the wilderness, it is for her to choose. Diony tells the story of the last several years, beginning with their marriage, and Berk understands before she finishes‚Äîshe chooses the man who has been her mainstay for the past two years. Berk goes to the bed, tenderly caresses his sleeping child and moves to leave. Then Evan says that Diony chose him from duty, there is something greater than duty or right. That's love. He has always known that Berk was the man for her content. He is proud and happy with what they have been to each other. His time with Diony will be like a treasure to him, for his whole enduring life. He leaves, and Diony turns toward a still-stunned Berk.

Delete  O(log log M) amortized average } In computer science, a y-fast trie is a data structure for storing integers from a bounded domain. It supports exact and predecessor or successor queries in time O(log log M), using O(n) space, where n is the number of stored values and M is the maximum value in the domain. The structure was proposed by Dan Willard in 1982 to decrease the O(n log M) space used by an x-fast trie. Structure An example of a y-fast trie. The nodes shown in the x-fast trie are the representatives of the O(n / log M) balanced binary search trees. A y-fast trie consists of two data structures: the top half is an x-fast trie and the lower half consists of a number of balanced binary trees. The keys are divided into groups of O(log M) consecutive elements and for each group a balanced binary search tree is created. To facilitate efficient insertion and deletion, each group contains at least (log M)/4 and at most 2 log M elements. For each balanced binary search tree a representative r is chosen. These representatives are stored in the x-fast trie. A representative r need not be an element of the tree associated with it, but it does need be an integer smaller than the successor of r and the minimum element of the tree associated with that successor and greater than the predecessor of r and the maximum element of the tree associated with that predecessor. Initially, the representative of a tree will be an integer between the minimum and maximum element in its tree. Since the x-fast trie stores O(n / log M) representatives and each representative occurs in O(log M) hash tables, this part of the y-fast trie uses O(n) space. The balanced binary search trees store n elements in total which uses O(n) space. Hence, in total a y-fast trie uses O(n) space. Operations Like van Emde Boas trees and x-fast tries, y-fast tries support the operations of an ordered associative array. This includes the usual associative array operations, along with two more order operations, Successor and Predecessor: *Find(k): find the value associated with the given key *Successor(k): find the key/value pair with the smallest key larger than or equal to the given key *Predecessor(k): find the key/value pair with the largest key less than or equal to the given key *Insert(k, v): insert the given key/value pair *Delete(k): remove the key/value pair with the given key =Find= A key k can be stored in either the tree of the smallest representative r greater than k or in the tree of the predecessor of r since the representative of a binary search tree need not be an element stored in its tree. Hence, one first finds the smallest representative r greater than k in the x-fast trie. Using this representative, one retrieves the predecessor of r. These two representatives point to two balanced binary search trees, both of which one searches for k. Finding the smallest representative r greater than k in the x-fast trie takes O(log log M). Using r, finding its predecessor takes constant time. Searching the two balanced binary search trees containing O(log M) elements each takes O(log log M) time. Hence, a key k can be found, and its value retrieved, in O(log log M) time. =Successor and Predecessor= Similarly to the key k itself, its successor can be stored in either the tree of the smallest representative r greater than k or in the tree of the predecessor of r. Hence, to find the successor of a key k, one first searches the x-fast trie for the smallest representative greater than k. Next, one uses this representative to retrieve its predecessor in the x-fast trie. These two representatives point to two balanced binary search trees, which one searches for the successor of k. Finding the smallest representative r greater than k in the x-fast trie takes O(log log M) time and using r to find its predecessor takes constant time. Searching the two balanced binary search trees containing O(log M) elements each takes O(log log M) time. Hence, the successor of a key k can be found, and its value retrieved, in O(log log M) time. Searching for the predecessor of a key k is highly similar to finding its successor. One searches the x-fast trie for the largest representative r smaller than k and one uses r to retrieve its predecessor in the x-fast trie. Finally, one searches the two balanced binary search trees of these two representatives for the predecessor of k. This takes O(log log M) time. =Insert= To insert a new key/value pair (k, v), one first needs to determine in which balanced binary search tree one needs to insert k. To this end, one finds the tree T containing the successor of k. Next, one inserts k into T. To ensure that all balanced binary search trees contain O(log M) elements, one splits T into two balanced binary trees and remove its representative from the x-fast trie if it contains more than 2 log M elements. Each of the two new balanced binary search trees contains at most log M + 1 elements. One picks a representative for each tree and insert these into the x-fast trie. Finding the successor of k takes O(log log M) time. Inserting k into a balanced binary search tree that contains O(log M) elements also takes O(log log M) time. Splitting a binary search tree that contains O(log M) elements can be done in O(log log M) time. Finally, inserting and deleting the three representatives takes O(log M) time. However, since one splits the tree at most once every O(log M) insertions and deletions, this takes constant amortized time. Therefore, inserting a new key/value pair takes O(log log M) amortized time. =Delete= Deletions are very similar to insertions. One first finds the key k in one of the balanced binary search trees and delete it from this tree T. To ensure that all balanced binary search trees contain O(log M) elements, one merges T with the balanced binary search tree of its successor or predecessor if it contains less than (log M)/4 elements. The representatives of the merged trees are removed from the x-fast trie. It is possible for the merged tree to contain more than 2 log M elements. If this is the case, the newly formed tree is split into two trees of about equal size. Next, one picks a new representative for each of the new trees and one inserts these into the x-fast trie. Finding the key k takes O(log log M) time. Deleting k from a balanced binary search tree that contains O(log M) elements also takes O(log log M) time. Merging and possibly splitting the balanced binary search trees takes O(log log M) time. Finally, deleting the old representatives and inserting the new representatives into the x-fast trie takes O(log M) time. Merging and possibly splitting the balanced binary search tree, however, is done at most once for every O(log M) insertions and deletions. Hence, it takes constant amortized time. Therefore, deleting a key/value pair takes O(log log M) amortized time.

According to 2009 its population was 1,889 inhabitants. Vilallonga del Camp is the only village within the municipality. It is located north of the provincial capital of Tarragona, roughly 12 miles from the coast. It lies along the A-27 road, north of El Morell and La Pobla de Mafumet, near El Rourell, just to the northeast. Heavily surrounded by fields full of crops, the municipality's main economic activity is agriculture; mainly hazelnuts, grapes, almonds, olive and carob trees. History The first manor in the area was first mentioned in documents in 1174. In 1213, Pere I made a pledge to limit the growth of the immediate area and so remained in the hands of the court until 1391, when the King Juan I of Aragon sold it to the archbishop of Tarragona. Later it was in hands of the Montoliu family, who retained in possession until the fourteenth century. A census of 1358 documents a Berenguer de Requesens being an owner of the manor, although in 1365-70 it was back with the Montoliu family with Berenguer de Montoliu. In the seventeenth century, Vilallonga was in the hands of the Dalmases family and in 1710 the lord of the town, Pau Ignasi de Dalmases i Roc, was appointed by the Archduke Carlos, 1st Marquis of Vilallonga. In 1838, a violent battle occurred between the militiamen and the \\"carlists\\". commanded by Llarg de Copons during which 138 men lost their lives. Vilallonga del Camp became a formal municipality on 19 February 1937. Culture Sant Mart√≠ Church The parish church is dedicated to Sant Mart√≠ and is built in the seventeenth century neoclassical style; its facade is unfinished. At the top of the door is a relief representing the saint sharing his cloak with a beggar. Over the cornice is a triangular pediment that is supported by four columns with Corinthian capitals. On the outskirts of the village is a shrine dedicated to the Mare de D√©u del Roser whose construction date is unknown. It contains one of the entrances to the old city wall and is mentioned in Francesc Blasi Vallespinosa's, \\"Santuaris Marians‚Ä¶\\". The feast day of Vilallonga is the 30 July, the feast day of Sant Abd√≥ and Sant Senen. On 11 November, another feast day is celebrated to honour to Sant Mart√≠. The Feast of La Rosa occurs on the second Sunday of May, and the feast of Del Roser is on the second Sunday of October. There is also a fair, known to the locals as simply \\"Fira\\", which takes place on the first Sunday of October.

Plot summary The story begins with the mention of Ashton Doyne, a distinguished writer, who left his wife a widow. Mrs. Doyne decides to write a biography about her husband. Three months after the author‚Äôs death, Mr. George Withermore, a young journalist and friend of the author, is approached by Mr. Doyne‚Äôs publishers stating that Mrs. Doyne wants him to take on the role of writing her husband‚Äôs biography. Withermore is surprised with this request. Nevertheless, Withermore takes the offer. Mr. Withermore and Mrs. Doyne make an arrangement to finally meet. Mr. Withermore tells us his impression of Mrs. Doyne. He says she is \\"strange\\" and \\"never thought her an agreeable one\\". Mrs. Doyne's intention to write the biography was not based on her behalf of her husband but of herself. \\"She had not taken Doyne seriously enough in life, but the biography should be a solid reply to every imputation on herself.\\" Mrs. Doyne takes George Withermore into her husband's study.\\"Dover, Adrian.\\"The Real Right Thing.p.1-2\\" Mrs. Doyne leaves George Withermore alone for him to look over pieces of her husband's past. Every now and then she'd pop her head in to check on him, and he'd thank her for her help. It becomes apparent that even though her husband may not have trusted her, she trusted his friend George. George determines that although she acts okay, Mrs. Doyne is not at peace yet with the death of her husband and the anxiety-causing grief follows her around. Although she leaves the room quite frequently, George thinks that he can feel her; one night while sitting at Ashton's desk looking over his correspondence, he feels as though someone is watching behind him. It was Mrs. Doyne who had entered the room without making a sound. When this encounter happens, George admits that he believed it was Ashton himself standing behind him. Mrs. Doyne admits that she still feels as though Ashton is around her, which George finds very surprising. George tells Mrs. Doyne that working in the place his friend worked, using his utensils and reading his written word, he feels as though Ashton is just out for a walk, and it seems impossible that he is really gone. As their discussion on this matter deepens, Mrs. Doyne reveals to George that she truly believes Ashton is around, to which George laughs and says that they better keep him happy if he is. Mrs. Doyne looks at him with a \\"vague distress\\" look in her eyes. Mrs. Doyne exits the room that evening telling George that she only came in to see if he needed help, convincing George that she did only have his best interest at heart.\\"Dover, Adrian.\\"The Real Right Thing.p.3\\" George starts to anticipate the evenings more and more each day because he enjoys going to the house and feeling a personal connection to Ashton's rumored presence; he looks forward to going there every evening. George is elated with feelings that what he is doing is exactly what his friend wanted him to do, and that he trusted George enough to let him in on his deepest secrets. George is determined to make Ashton and his secrets come out in a very beautiful way - only enhancing people's views on Ashton, not diminishing them. There are moments when George feels his dead friend lightly breathing in his hair and that he was leaning his elbows against the table in front of him. There were even moments where he would peer across the table and see his friend as vividly as he saw the papers in front of him. Ashton's spirit remains quietly within the room, almost like a \\"discreet librarian,\\" just making sure that his prized possessions were being taken care of in the best way possible. George starts to hear the shuffling of documents that he placed on the table as well as papers he misplaced being put into his line of view. Drawers and boxes started opening on their own, and George is determined that he saw Ashton.\\"Dover, Adrian.\\"The Real Right Thing.p.4\\" After receiving what he thought to be cues and guidance from the spirit of Ashton, he waited for days and made sure to take notice of anything that felt out of the ordinary and that could have been understood as the next step in the construction of the biography. As time passed, George began to feel ‚Äúsad‚Äù and ‚Äúuneasy‚Äù about not being surrounded by the spirit of Ashton. Suddenly, George found himself restless in the room and felt as if something had been out of place because of this feeling. As George finds himself on the stairs staring at Mrs. Doyne, they suddenly wind up in her room and begin to discuss what seems to be the passing spirit of Ashton throughout the house. Mrs. Doyne seems to have known that the spirit of her husband was in the room with George and knows that the spirit had gone back and forth between his room and hers and even passed them while they were on the stairs. After they speak about where his spirit had been lurking, they sit hand in hand in silence completely alone (at this point, they felt as if the spirit had vanished.) After George interrupts the silence because of a sudden feeling of anxiety, Mrs. Doyne states, ‚ÄúI only want to do the real right thing.‚Äù They begin to question what it is that they are doing and whether or not it is the right thing in honor of Ashton. George goes back and reviews what he had previously written to make sure it was thorough and suddenly, Mrs. Doyne feels the spirit. Although Withermore and Ashton were best friends, the presence did not leave off good a feeling. In fact, Withermore got this negative feeling while he was writing about Ashton. Withermore wanted to let Mrs. Doyne know that maybe we shouldn‚Äôt do what we are doing we shouldn‚Äôt just lay out his life in front of this world letting everyone know about him. Withermore is not satisfied with what he is doing. At the end Withermore finally tells Mrs. Doyne to end the completion of the biography. Mrs. Doyne still doesn‚Äôt want to give up on writing about his life but finally agrees with Withermore to bring an end in writing his biography. Characters =Ashton Doyne= * Ashton Doyne is a successful writer who died from undetermined causes. He was a very rich and fake man, always striving to make himself look the absolute best in front of his rich friends. He kept a lot of his personal journals and writings to himself in order to never be judged. =Ashton Doyne's Spirit= * Ashton Doyne's spirit comes into the study where Ashton always worked in order to keep his own watchful eye on what his wife and friend were doing with his belongings. It becomes apparent toward the end of the story that Ashton's ghost doesn't represent the Ashton people knew when he was alive; he is cold and distant to his wife and friend. He haunts George and Mrs. Doyne in order to stop him from writing the biography; he didn't want the biography to lead to an inaccurate perception of him to those who read it. Eventually he gets his wish when George and Mrs. Doyne stop working on the biography. =George Withermore= * George Withermore is a young, conscientious journalist and critic who lives a lower class lifestyle with little to show for himself. He had very few writings, and there were not a lot of people he associated with. However, he was a good friend of the more famed writer and recently deceased Ashton Doyne. George goes to meet with the widow Mrs. Doyne in order to collect materials of Ashton. It is very clear that George was very attached to his friend, and still was even after he died. As George compiles information for the biography on his friend, he notices a ghost-like character in the room with him, who he believes to be Ashton himself. He found this spirit to be a stranger; it wasn't kind and warmhearted to him like he remembered his friend as. George eventually gives up on writing the biography when he is haunted and scared too many times by Ashton's ghost. =Mrs. Doyne= * Mrs. Doyne: Her walk was \\"ugly and tragic\\" but also very striking; she gave off a rather elegant presence to those around her. Mrs. Doyne has superficial qualities; she wants complete control of what Mr. Withermore writes in the biography about her husband. She wants to make sure she doesn't come out looking bad to the circle of people her husband and she surrounded themselves with. She cares about \\"quantity\\" not \\"quality\\" for his book, only caring about how many volumes will be involved, not the context of what will be written. She often speaks for her husband, even though she barely knew him and it is determined that she didn't care to know him. She is a perfectionist who doesn't want to look anything less than stellar. She keeps a very watchful eye on what sources George is using and how he is using them. Like George, she starts to feel the presence of her deceased husband in the office where they work, and she agrees that they should give up on the biography. Critical Interpretations =The Supernatural in \\"The Real Right Thing\\"= In Telotte's article \\"The Right Way With Reality,\\" the significance of the supernatural is an important element to note in discussing ‚ÄúThe Real Right Thing‚Äù by Henry James. The ghost of Ashton Doyne is ambiguous in appearance. Therefore, Telotte notes that the ‚Äúsignificance of this distinction, and thus of the haunting and problematic vision it notes, rests, on the one hand, in its reminder of the many similar ‚Äúghosts that haunt James‚Äôs short fiction in his later period, and, on the other, in its pointed parallel to another problem of removed perception that dominates this story-- Withermore‚Äôs attempt to write Doyne‚Äôs biography, to reconstruct a life from the paper trail a man has left behind. In the conjunction of the modes of approaching reality, which this supposedly supernatural vision and the act of writing imply, we might discern not only a basic tension informing this story, but also a larger concert with presences and absences and a desire-- common to both readers and writers‚Äîto close the gap between the two, for it is a gap that informs much of James‚Äôs fiction and gives the reason to his recurrent ‚Äúghosts.‚ÄùTelotte, J.P. The Right way with Reality:The Real Right Thing. Georgia Institute of Technology, 1984, p. 8. =Ambiguity in \\"The Real Right Thing\\"= Telotte discusses the play between the perceptions of our reality and the more concrete forms of reality, like written work, that James uses as a technique for his stories. In the \\"Real Right Thing\\", it is Ashton's ghost and the biography that represent these two forms of reality. What is the \\"Real Right Thing\\"? Is it this mysterious apparition or is it the biography? The difficulty in answering this question can be found in all of James's works. As readers, we have the desire to \\"fill in the gaps\\" and seek some sort of knowledge and certainty within James's works. Henry James poses this question but purposely leaves out the answer.‚ÄùTelotte, J.P. The Right way with Reality:The Real Right Thing. Georgia Institute of Technology, 1984, p. 8. =Queer Theory= In the reading \\"Resistance of Queory\\" by Hugh Stevens, Stevens' argument is that in the short story \\"The Real Right Thing\\" it suggests the theory of homosexuality between the characters Mr. Withermore and Ashton's spirit.‚ÄùStevens, Hugh. \\"The Resistance to Queory: John Addington Symonds and 'The Real Right Thing'.,Henry James Review 20.3,1999, p.260.

Stevens makes a reference to the story's text to support this theory: > \\"When once this fancy had begun to hang about him he welcomed it, persuaded > it, encouraged it, quite cherished it, looking forward all day to feeling it > renew itself in the evening, and waiting for the evening very much as one of > a pair of lovers might wait for the hour of their appointment...Withermore > rejoiced at moments to feel this certitude: there were times of dipping deep > into some of Doyne's secrets when it was particularly pleasant to be able to > hold that Doyne desired him, as it were, to know them.\\"Dover, Adrian.\\"The > Real Right Thing.\\" Stevens suggests that the presence of the ghost is much more than its mention. Its presence is Doyne \\"coming out of the closet.\\" Stevens, Hugh. \\"The Resistance to Queory: John Addington Symonds and 'The Real Right Thing'. Henry James Review,1999, p.260. Henry James was interested in J.A. Symonds theories of sexuality involving homosexual men.

However, James found the task difficult because James did not want to leave out information about Symonds' life. He felt that if he had to keep certain details out of the public's attention than he did not feel fit in writing a biography that does not present the entire colorful personality and life of the dead author.Stevens, Hugh. \\"The Resistance to Queory: John Addington Symonds and 'The Real Right Thing'.Henry James Review,1999,p.261 Therefore, \\"The Real Right Thing\\" \\"meditates on the problematic relationship between a private sexual life, a marriage, and how these two things might be represented in the public biography of a dead writer-- all factors that James perceived as important in writings on Symonds after his death.\\"Stevens,Hugh. \\"The Resistance to Queory: John Addington Symonds and 'The Real Right Thing'.

He'arat Shulayim) is a 2011 Israeli drama film written and directed by Joseph Cedar, starring Shlomo Bar Aba and Lior Ashkenazi. The plot revolves around the troubled relationship between a father and son who teach at the Talmud department of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The film won the Best Screenplay Award at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. Footnote won nine prizes at the 2011 Ophir Awards, becoming Israel's entry for the 84th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film. On 18 January 2012, the film was named as one of the nine shortlisted entries for the Oscars. On 24 January 2012, the film was nominated for an Academy Award in the category of Best Foreign Language Film, but lost to the Iranian film A Separation. Plot Eliezer Shkolnik (Shlomo Bar Aba) is a philologist who researches the different versions and phrasings of the Jerusalem Talmud. He and his son Uriel (Lior Ashkenazi) are both professors at the Talmudic Research department of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Uriel, a charismatic academic, is extremely popular with the department's students and the general public, and is also recognized by the establishment when he is elected member of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities. The father, on the other hand, is a stubborn old-school purist in his research methods. He is unpopular, unrecognized, and frustrated by his would-be lifetime research achievement having gone unfulfilled, as a rival scholar, Prof. Yehuda Grossman (Micah Lewensohn), published similar results one month ahead of Eliezer. Eliezer is also highly critical of the new methods of research used by his son and other modern researchers, as he considers them superficial. His ambition is to be recognized by being awarded the Israel Prize, but he is disappointed every year when he does not win it. His nature and the lack of recognition have made him bitter, anti-social, and envious of his son's popularity. Eliezer receives a phone call from the Minister of Education. She tells Eliezer that he was elected this year's laureate of the Israel Prize and congratulates him. The following day Uriel is summoned to an urgent meeting with the Israel Prize committee. Uriel is told that an error had occurred and that in fact it was he, not his father, who was awarded the Israel Prize. The committee wishes to discuss ways to correct the error, but Uriel objects, saying the revelation would devastate his father. Uriel and the head of the committee, Grossman, argue over the issue until Uriel loses his temper and shoves Grossman. Regretting his outburst, Uriel relents, and asks that the committee permit him to break the news to his father personally. During the meeting Uriel says he has been submitting his father's name for the Israel Prize every year, and accuses Grossman of blocking that and other ways of recognizing Eliezer. According to Grossman, Eliezer never published anything significant in his career, and his only claim to fame is being mentioned as a footnote in the work of a more famous scholar. Uriel goes to the National Library to break the news to his father but finds him raising a toast to winning the prize with colleagues. Unable to break the news, he once again meets with Grossman, asking that the prize be given to Eliezer. Grossman relents but with two conditions: Uriel must write the committee's recommendation and Uriel can never be a candidate for the prize. Uriel agrees. Uriel writes the recommendation text, picking and choosing every word carefully; at the same time Eliezer, finally recognized, is interviewed by the newspaper Haaretz, during which he denounces the scientific and academic validity of Uriel's research. When the interview is published, Uriel is angry but keeps his secret. Later, though, he whispers the secret to his mother. She does not disclose the truth to anyone else. During preparations for a television interview, Eliezer is struck by an uncommon Talmudic expression in the Israel Prize committee's recommendation. He flees the television studio and returns to his study. He examines the expression, cross-checking its published uses, and realizes that the text must have actually been written by Uriel. Eliezer also reconstructs his phone conversation with the Minister of Education, realizing she had addressed him by his last name only. He concludes that the minister thought she was talking to his son when she broke the news about the Israel Prize. On the day of the prize ceremony, Eliezer and his wife arrive at the Jerusalem International Convention Center to prepare for the ceremony; Eliezer is stressed and distracted. The movie ends a moment before the laureates are called to the stage. Cast *Shlomo Bar Aba as Eliezer Shkolnik *Lior Ashkenazi as Uriel Shkolnik *Alisa Rosen as Yehudit Shkolnik, Eliezer's wife and Uriel's mother *Alma Zack as Dikla Shkolnik, Uriel's wife *Daniel Markovich as Josh Shkolnik, Uriel's son *Micah Lewensohn as Yehuda Grossman *Yuval Scharf as Noa the reporter *Nevo Kimchi as Yair Fingerhut *Yona Elian as Yuli Tamir, Minister of Education (voice) Production Director Joseph Cedar explained why he chose to make a film that focuses on Hebrew University's Talmud department: \\"It is the smallest department in the university, but it is famous worldwide for its uncompromising methods, and its unforgiving attitude toward the notion of 'mistake'. Once I started hearing stories from within this department, about mythological rivalries between scholars, stubbornness on an epic scale, eccentric professors who live with an academic mission that is bigger than life itself, even if its topic is radically esoteric, I fell in love with them all, and they became the centre of this story.\\" The film was produced by United King Films and Movie Plus. It received support from the Israel Film Fund, Jerusalem Film Fund and the AVI CHAI Foundation. The film marked the return to cinema after 20 years for Shlomo Bar Aba, a stage comedian, in the role of the father. Bar Aba prepared his character for six months. Lior Ashkenazi, who was raised in a secular home, took Talmud classes at the Hebrew University and let his beard grow for eight months. Release Footnote premiered in competition at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival on 14 May, winning the Best Screenplay Award. It was released in Israel on 2 June through United King Films. North American distribution rights for the film were acquired by Sony Pictures Classics. Box office As of 8 July 2012, the film has grossed $2,007,451, in North America. Critical reception The film received high critical acclaim. At Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 90%, based on 89 reviews and an average rating of 7.63/10. It also has a score of 83 on Metacritic, based on 27 reviews, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Hannah Brown of The Jerusalem Post called the film \\"brilliant and audacious\\", and wrote: \\"Cedar uses dramatic cinematography, music and visual effects to signal that this is a film about an earth-shaking battle, at least in its protagonists‚Äô hearts and minds. The acting is outstanding, notably by Bar-Abba and Ashkenazi.\\" Cedar received the Cannes Film Festival's Best Screenplay Award. A. O. Scott, film critic for The New York Times, called Footnote the fourth best film of 2012. Wrote Scott: > This Israeli film takes what might have been a trivial anecdote ‚Äî a > committee accidentally awards a prize to the wrong scholar ‚Äî and turns it > into a tragicomic opera with a great deal to say about Zionism, academia, > family life and the way language functions as a bridge between the sacred > and the profane.

He caught one game for the New York Mets in 1990. He hit a single in his only Major League at bat, on June 3, 1990, giving him a lifetime batting average of 1.000. His Major League slugging percentage and on-base percentage are also 1.000. His at bat came in the 8th inning of a game against the Philadelphia Phillies as a pinch hitter for Mets' catcher Mackey Sasser against pitcher Pat Combs. His hit came on the only Major League pitch he ever faced; author George Rose estimates that his Major League career as a hitter thus lasted only about 20 seconds. He scored a run later in the inning. He also caught one inning with one putout for a lifetime fielding percentage of 1.000. Liddell had been called up to the majors on June 3 due to the death of backup catcher Orlando Mercado's father. Pitcher Wally Whitehurst was sent to the minors to clear roster space for Liddell and after the minimum ten days that Whitehurst was required to remain in the minors, Whitehurst was recalled and Liddell was sent back to the Tidewater Tides for the remainder of the season.

His first notable works were Techniques of the Observer: On Vision and Modernity in the 19th Century (1990), and Suspensions of Perception: Attention, Spectacle and Modern Culture (2000). He has published critical essays for over 30 Exhibition catalogues, mostly on contemporary art. His style is often classified as observational mixed with scientific, and a dominant theme in his work is the role of the human eye. Biography Crary attended high school at the Putney School in Vermont. He graduated from Columbia College where he was an art history major. In 1987 he received his Ph.D from Columbia as well. Crary also earned a B.F.A. from the San Francisco Art Institute, where he studied film and photography. He first taught at the Visual Arts Department at University of California, San Diego. In 1989 he began teaching at Columbia. Writing Crary's 24/7: Late Capitalism and the End of Sleep explores the nonstop pace of the modern world and its effects on human psychology and physiology, with an emphasis on sleep patterns. His Suspensions of Perception focuses on the period from about 1880 to 1905, exploring the second half of the nineteenth century in which a new way of seeing was introduced. Crary describes this shift as an emergence of subjective vision. In addition, Crary discusses how Attention became a ‚Äúnew object within the modernization of subjectivity...‚Äù. Crary's book examines how the perception of various cultures were reconstructed and uncertainties were argued. This new development of vision created controversy because it implied that seeing was dependent upon one's subjective thoughts, which were based on what the observer saw. Therefore, this new way of seeing was thought of as unclear, unreliable, and always questioned among a large population of people. Suspensions of Perception published in 2000 was the winner of the 2001 Lionel Trilling Book Award.Meyer Schapiro Professor of Modern Art and Theory, Jonathan Crary Crary's Techniques of the Observer gives a unique study on the origins of modern visual culture.

It was established through the combined efforts of Edgar M. Gregory, who had received approval from the U.S. War Department to begin recruiting soldiers for an entirely new regiment during the fall of 1861, and Edward E. Wallace, who had initiated his own recruitment efforts that October. Their recruits were volunteers, the majority of whom initially enlisted for three-year terms of service from their hometown of Philadelphia; they were divided into 10 lettered companies upon muster in during early December 1861: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, and K.

Leaving dead and wounded men behind, they were assaulted by intense artillery fire during their retreat, but were able to regroup and be reposted at the fork of the Chancellorsville and United States Ford roads, where they remained until noon the next day (May 4) when they were ordered to move to the rear of the Union's lines and resume work on fortifications. Ordered back to the front that evening, they protected other retreating soldiers before being ordered to return to camp.\\"91st Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers,\\" PA-Roots.Bates, pp. 188‚Äì189. Relieving the 32nd Massachusetts at Stoneman's Switch on May 28, the 91st Pennsylvanians guarded the railroad from the station to Potomac Bridge before being assigned to cavalry relief on June 4 at United States Ford. Five days later, they were ordered back to Mount Holly Church and then to Catlett's Station before being attached to the forces of Gen. Stephen H. Weed. Ordered to head for Frederick City by way of Manassas Junction, Gum Spring and Aldie, they crossed the Potomac at Edwards' Ferry, they then continued on to Hanover, Pennsylvania, arriving during the evening of July 1, 1863.\\"91st Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers,\\" PA-Roots.Bates, p. 189. =Battle of Gettysburg= 91st Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry monument, Gettysburg National Military Park. At 8 p.m. on July 1, 1863, the 91st Pennsylvanians marched for Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Arriving four hours later, they were ordered to rest on their arms until 4 a.m., when they again resumed their march. After reaching their designated position on the right of the Union Army during this second day of the Battle of Gettysburg, they fought at this spot for an hour before shifting left to support the Union's center.\\"91st Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers,\\" PA-Roots.Bates, p. 189. At 2 p.m., they marched for Little Round Top to relieve a segment of the beleaguered 3rd Corps, and were soon engaging CSA sharpshooters positioned in the Devil's Den. Gen. Weed was among those killed here during this time. As night fell, the 91st Pennsylvanians prepared for further combat by improving their fortifications.\\"91st Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers,\\" PA-Roots.Bates, pp. 189‚Äì190. On the Fourth of July, skirmishers from the regiment took several CSA soldiers prisoner as they infiltrated CSA positions. En route, the 91st sustained 21 casualties (two officers, 19 enlisted men). Departing Little Round Top the next afternoon at 4 p.m., they marched for Marsh Creek, where they remained until ordered to drive CSA troops from Utica, Middletown, Boonsboro, and across the Antietam Creek.\\"91st Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers,\\" PA-Roots.Bates, p. 190. Within a week, major newspapers across American had begun to publish casualty reports from the 91st Pennsylvania and other Union regiments.\\"Fifth Corps,\\" in \\"The Casualties: Names of Some of the Killed and Wounded\\" (Army of the Potomac, Gettysburg). New York, New York: The New York Herald, July 7, 1863, p. 10. By July 12, the 91st Pennsylvanians were once again engaged in strengthening Union fortifications. The next day, they fired heavily upon CSA troops nearby, forcing their continued retreat. Advancing toward Williamsport the next day, they captured more CSA soldiers. By campaign's end, they were guarding rail lines along the Rappahannock, as well as the Orange and Alexandria Railroad.\\"91st Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers,\\" PA-Roots.Bates, p. 190. =Reenlistment and veterans' furlough= Despite the intense combat experiences they had endured during the early part of their service, many of the 91st Pennsylvanians opted to re-enlist when their initial three-year terms of service expired. For a significant number of these men, that reenlistment date was December 26, 1863.\\"Civil War Veterans' Card File, 1861‚Äì1866.\\" Harrisburg, Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania State Archives. Some who did not reenlist were transferred to the 155th Pennsylvania.\\"91st Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers,\\" PA-Roots.Bates, p. 190. As a reward for these reenlistments, members of the regiment were granted veteran furloughs and permitted to return home. Departing January 2, 1864, the regiment paraded down Chestnut Street after its arrival in Philadelphia, passing in front of Independence Hall. Regimental headquarters were then opened on Chestnut (below Fifth), and recruiting was resumed under the management of Lt. Shipley.\\"91st Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers,\\" PA-Roots. While home on furlough, the regiment's First State Color was retired (in January 1864) and returned to Harrisburg for safekeeping. The regiment was then issued its Second State Color (in February 1864), which was manufactured by the same firm which had produced its first battle flag.\\"91st Infantry,\\" Pennsylvania Capitol Preservation Committee.Bates, p. 190. Their furloughs over on February 16, the 91st Pennsylvanians reported back to headquarters, and were then moved to the Upland Institute in Chester, where they remained until leaving for winter quarters at Warrenton Junction on March 2. According to Bates' History of Pennsylvania Volunteers, during this phase of duty, regimental leaders used this time to replenish their ranks, enrolling additional recruits from mid to late March (five of whom were categorized as \\"Unassigned Men\\").\\"91st Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers,\\" PA-Roots.Bates, pp. 190, 233. =1864 campaigns= U.S. Army Chief of Engineers' map showing key sites of the Union's 1864-1865 Overland, Petersburg and Appomattox campaigns (updated Nov. 30, 1865). During their spring campaign in 1864, the 91st Pennsylvanians departed Culpepper, Virginia at 11 p.m. on May 3, and headed for Germania Ford. Crossing the river early the next morning, they marched on to Wilderness Tavern, where they were ordered to post pickets and make camp. The next morning, they were positioned at the right side of their brigade's battle line near the vicinity of Parker's Store as part of the Overland Campaign. After one brief charge through a thicket, they remained on duty at their assigned post. Ordered to relieve a unit of reserves from the Keystone State the next day, they skirmished with CSA troops off and on until 1 a.m. May 7 when they were ordered to move behind the Union's earthenworks nearby. Fending off a series of CSA charges, they were ordered to withdraw at 9 p.m. During this retreat, Color-Sgt. Robert Chism was trampled by a horse; he died later following the amputation of his injured leg.\\"91st Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers,\\" PA-Roots.Bates, pp. 190‚Äì191. Assigned to relieve the cavalry stationed near Todd's Tavern around 7 a.m., they slowly advanced under heavy artillery fire to Laurel Hill. Holding this spot for several hours, they then retreated to a ridge at the rear, leaving regimental skirmishers to keep control of the knoll. The bulk of the regiment then set to work bolstering existing earthenworks.\\"91st Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers,\\" PA-Roots.Bates, p. 191. During the morning of May 12, the 91st Pennsylvania staged a diversion in the face of heavy rifle and artillery fire which enabled the 2nd Corps to effect a larger, surprise charge on the CSA. When Lt. Col. Sinex and Lt. Shipley were wounded during the ruse, Maj. Lentz assumed command. The 91st Pennsylvania then moved on to the Spottsylvania Court House, where it joined with the 140th New York in driving away CSA troops stationed at the Myers' House. Following a brief respite from the action, during which they were relieved by a 6th Corps brigade which ultimately lost the ground they had just gained, they returned with the 140th New York to recapture the area around the court house. After succeeding under heavy artillery fire, they were then relieved again and repositioned in front and to the left of Spottsylvania.\\"91st Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers,\\" PA- Roots.Bates, p. 191. Positioned near the front of the Union Army as it marched on Richmond, the 91st Pennsylvania sustained 11 killed and wounded in the fight at North Anna on May 23. F Company's Capt.

Sweitzer after arriving at Cold Harbor on June 4, they crossed the James River on June 16, and headed for Petersburg. Posted initially to the left of the 9th Corps, they were shifted to the battle lines at the rear of the 3rd Division at dawn two days later. Charging with other Union troops, they drove away CSA troops and helped capture a key segment of the Suffolk and Petersburg Railroad as part of the Siege of Petersburg. During the intense, four-hour battle, Lts. Edward J. Maguigan and Justus A. Gregory were wounded. As their division moved on at dusk, they drove more CSA troops away by charging a hill nearby. June 21 was then spent on skirmish detail. But these successes were costly. Eighty-two members of the regiment (nearly a full company's worth of men) had been killed or wounded.\\"91st Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers,\\" PA-Roots.Bates, pp. 191‚Äì192. Assigned to strengthen Union fortifications during most of July and to garrison detail from the end of that month until August 18, the 91st Pennsylvanians briefly engaged the CSA near the Weldon Railroad. By September 30, they were engaged in the Battle of Peebles's Farm and involved in the capture of a neighboring fort. After building additional fortifications in the area in early October, they drove off CSA troops stationed at Davis House, and burned the structure.\\"91st Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers,\\" PA-Roots.Bates, p. 192.

John Edgar, Jr., who was killed, and Lt. William H. Frailey, who was wounded. In addition, Capt. George P. Finney was captured, as were several other members of the regiment. Then, while fighting at Dabney's Mill in the Second Battle of Hatcher's Run and the Battle of Gravelly Run in late March, the regiment lost 14 more men, including Capt. Hope. During the fighting at Five Forks and Sailor's Creek, the regiment had less costly successes, however, and was able to assist in the capture of supply wagons and CSA troops while driving the larger body of the CSA toward the Appomattox Court House. While there, the 91st Pennsylvanians witnessed the formal surrender on April 9, 1865 of the Confederate States Army by Gen. Robert E. Lee.\\"91st Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers,\\" PA-Roots.Bates, pp. 192‚Äì193.

Under the Act, this police force was placed under the control of the Lord Provost, three magistrates and nine elected commissioners. The force was supported financially by a rate levied by the City Council on houses and businesses; the lack of such a levy had frustrated the previous attempt at having a professional police presence in the city. The Act was a forerunner of similar Acts of Parliament establishing police forces in other Scottish cities and burghs, culminating in the Policing of Towns (Scotland) Act 1850 and the General Police and Improvement (Scotland) Act 1862.

Description Narrative communication is a way of communicating through telling stories. The stories are written or told and are named narratives. Most often, narratives are used to recount a story or in other cases to express an opinion or give information to circumscribe a situation like e.g. past events from the perspective of the storyteller. This use of narrative communication may be more effective than enumerating facts and statistics, because it provides an experience people can understand and share. Narrative communication is one way, as in a speaker addressing an audience. What is narrative communication? Narrative communication is an account of events over a passage of time shared to one or many listeners. The time it takes to tell these narratives can vary. As per Kellas, ‚ÄúPeople build and communicate their relationships, cultures, and identities, in part through the stories they tell‚Äù (Baxter, 241). One may ask, why not call it ‚Äústory telling theory‚Äù, instead of narrative theory? Most communication scholars view this as the story being retold in a micro fashion which does not have extensive details. While the term 'narrative' encompasses a macro aspect than just story telling. For example, a story is generally describing or recounting a noteworthy event in someone‚Äôs life, whereas a narrative for example is not just the event but could describe multiple events to a whole sequence of someone in more detail than just telling one single story about the person. There are two types of narratives that create the biggest impact in our lives. First there is personal narrative, second there are professional narratives. Personal This concept explains that most of the narratives we use come from our personal experiences. When a friend or family member tells us about their day, and what has gone wrong to what is good, they are telling us how they want us to see them. History shows us that all cultures use some kind of narrative to form stories and dances to tell about their tribes and cultures. Same as family stories that are passed down from generation to generation. Professional This facet of narrative states that professionalism at the work place provides many outlets to produce narratives that express who we are (Alder & Rodmen, 2009 ). In the professional world we are exposed to many different cultures that shape how we share are narratives. This includes higher education and any organization we belong to.

Plot A tough undercover cop named John (Cuba Gooding Jr.) inadvertently gets involved in a dangerous heroin ring when Mike (Devon Bostick), a young defector of the drug trade leaves his five-year- old sister, Angel (Arcadia Kendal) within his care. After Mike is killed, Angel is kidnapped and trapped in an underground drug ring. John then sets out to save the girl with the help of Father Porter (Christian Slater). John is initially acquainted with the priest after the death of his family in an underground operation that went south, where his wife and daughter were the victims. His life after the murder has him finding solace in alcohol as he turns to Father Porter for salvation in his attempts to save Angel. Unbeknownst to this, Father Porter enlists in the help of John once the statues within his church are stolen by violent criminals and he too is then wrapped up in the whirlwind of this world of crime and punishment.

The production began March 28th, 2010 in Ottawa, Ontario on the indie crime film into late April. The reported budget of the film is $6.8 million. Although the film is set in Los Angeles and Toronto, the production team dressed the streets of Ottawa to look more like these cities while making the most of their surroundings. The movie being filmed outside of Toronto had to do with the preferable provincial tax breaks given to filmmakers who film in other areas of the province. With this push, it was reported that in the year of 2011 Canadian owned and controlled distributors were responsible for 77% of films released in Canada (both Canadian and non-Canadian films).

Description Displayed during the latter years of J.M.W. Turners career, this painting depicts a deluge scene where the natural effects of light and weather (the atmosphere) play a crucial role on Turner's concept of vision. The deluge being referred to in the title is the representation of the great flood story told in the Book of Genesis. As suggested by its title, the painting also acknowledges Moses, known as the author of the book of Genesis found in the Old Testament of the Bible.Finley, Gerald. Angel in the Sun: Turner's Vision of History. McGill-Queen's University Press. Canada, 1999 In this painting the role of man is portrayed as passive through his inability to control nature, which is beautiful to the eye yet has the power to destroy and recreate life. This piece also illustrates Turner's belief that God is the one in charge as it is He who creates the flood, allows Noah to survive, and inspired Moses to write the Book of Genesis. Genesis, in this case leads back to the creation of man, light, and the water which light is being reflected on. Style For most of his career Turner, whose works are predominantly subjective, was recognised for his watercolor and oil paintings that reflected landscape images and scenes of natural entities such as the weather, the ocean, the effect of light, and vision. Through the blurring of images, Turner attempts to justify the belief that the eye is always trying to form an image as it tries to recreate nature. Traditionally, colour is used as a type of accessory to form, but Turner's attraction to light and colour allows colour to take the place of form.Finley, Gerald. Angel in the Sun: Turner's Vision of History. McGill-Queen's University Press. Canada, 1999. The main colours used by Turner were red, yellow, and blue, which is discussed more in depth in relation to other works that influenced that of Turner. His work also illustrates his relationship to the Romantic Movement and position as the precursor of the impressionist movement. Influence As expressed in the title of the painting, J.M.W. Turner found interest in Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe's book, Theory of Colours also known as Zur Farbenlehre, published in 1810.Finley, Gerald. The Deluge Pictures: Reflections on Goethe, J.M.W.

Zeitschrift f√ºr Kunstgeschichte, 60 Bd., H. 4 (1997), pp. 530‚Äì548 Goethe's Theory Turner absorbed Goethe‚Äôs theory of light and darkness and depicted their relationship in a number of his paintings, including Light and Colour (Goethe's Theory) ‚Äì the Morning after the Deluge ‚Äì Moses Writing the Book of Genesis. According to this theory, the creation of colour is dependent on the distribution of dark and light reflecting through a transparent object. Turner uses main concepts from Goethe‚Äôs theory, which is a rejection of Newton's Seven Color Theory, and expresses the belief that every colour was an individualised combination of light and darkness. Newton's reasoning in his theory of light and colour was, in the words of Michael Duck, too simplistic for Goethe. As a result, Goethe found his own form of vision in regards to the physiological aspects of the concept of colour.Duck, Michael (September 1988). \\"Newton and Goethe on colour: Physical and physiological considerations\\". Annals of Science, Volume 45, Number 5, pp. 507‚Äì519. As a result, Goethe claims that there is an infinite amount of colour variation, and through his paintings Turner attempts to reflect this theory. Turner also responds to the plus and minus concepts that Goethe created to address both emotions and the eye. His main focus was the after image that is left on the retina after seeing an image. Through this after image the plus addresses the colours red and yellow which is intended to evoke a buoyant feelings, while the colour blue contrasts such as it creates the emotion of melancholy and desolation. According to Goethe's concept, yellow undergoes a transition of light becoming darker when light reaches its peak, just as the Sun shines in the sky, it develops to a white light that is colourless. But the light deepens and evolves the yellow into an orange and then finally to a ruby red hue. Turner illustrates the process of yellow transitioning into phases of light by showing how, as the viewer moves away from the centre, the edges get darker. Symbolism The yellowing colouring of the painting is a reference to Goethe‚Äôs Theory of Colour, which explains the colour yellow as being the first colour transmitted from light.Werner Backhaus, Reinhold Kliegl, John S. Werner. Color Vision: perspectives from different disciplines. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin, 1998. pp 13‚Äì26 The form of the painting is circular, symbolising the construction of the human eye, changing the focus of a typical linear splitting of space to a more subjective portrayal. The colour yellow is typically optimistic, but Turner captures the negativity of yellow by attaching the colour to a light that is subject to change. The morning sun aspect of the colour is something transient. Companion piece *Turner's paired piece titled Shade and Darkness ‚Äì The Evening of the Deluge was also exhibited in 1843. In this piece as well as The Morning After the Deluge, Turner makes no attempt to mirror the scene of the flood in its naturality. *Fallacies of Hope is a poem that Turner supposedly wrote to parallel the two paintings. 1994 Frankfurt theft Light and Colour was among three paintings stolen from a Frankfurt museum in 1994.

Russell Athletic supplied jersey uniforms and apparel for many professional sports teams of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada, and also high schools, colleges, universities, and minor league teams, until it shut down its team uniform division in 2017.Russell Throws In The Towel On Uniforms, SGB Media, Sep 29, 2017 Nevertheless, Russell reactivated the manufacturing of team uniforms in 2018 through an agreement with Georgia-based company Augusta Sportswear.Russell Athletic on Augusta Sportswear site, retrieved 2 Aug 2020 Today, Russell Athletic primarily focuses on casual wear, producing t-shirts, hoodies, jackets, sweatpants, shorts and underwear. The company also manufactures American football, baseball/softball, and basketball uniforms in its partnership with Augusta Sportswear. History =Founding= The company was founded by Benjamin Russell in Alexander City, Alabama, in 1902. The original mill produced women's undershirts and children's undergarments. The mills beginning capacity was 150 garments daily. During the 1910s, Russell Manufacturing Co. become an established business. In 1920 Russell Sr. & Jr. created the first cotton jersey that is now known as the sweatshirt. By 1925 long underwear, sweaters, athletic shirts, and women's bloomers were added to the production of women's vests, making a more complete product line. 1932 saw how Russell acquired Southern Manufacturing Company, which gave the company access to athletic team apparel. With it, the company became Russell Southern. This was the beginning of the Russell Athletic division's cutting and sewing operations. Later in 1938, Russell began making woven athletic garments, including basketball, baseball, and football pants and jackets. =Expansion= In 1941, founder Benjamin Russell died on December 16 and the reins of the company were passed to his son Benjamin C. Russell. During World War II, Russell's 'Athletic' Division sold primarily to the military. Shirts, drawers, T-shirts, athletic garments, and special outer garments were made for the Army and Navy. Benjamin C. Russell died in 1945 and was succeeded as president by his brother, Thomas D. Russell. After the War, the company embarked on further expansion and development throughout its knitting, weaving, dyeing, finishing, and cutting departments. During the 1960s, the 'Athletic' division was the largest marketer and manufacturer of athletic apparel and uniforms in the country. In 1962, Russell Manufacturing Company's name was changed to Russell Mills, Inc. In 1973, Russell Mills' name was changed to the Russell Corporation, and the company expanded manufacturing across the Southern USA, also to Latin America and Scotland. In 1992, Russell Athletic dealt a five-year contract to serve as the exclusive producer and marketer of athletic uniforms for most Major League Baseball (MLB) teams. The contract also stipulated that the company held the exclusive right to manufacture and market replicas of major league uniforms, T-shirts, and shorts. By 1995, Russell Athletic was the official supplier of team uniforms for 25 of (the then) 28 MLB teams, outfitted more NFL teams than any other company, and was still the largest manufacturer of athletic uniforms in the U.S. Meanwhile, the contract with the MLB was extended to 1999; after which there was no exclusive uniform supplier to MLB, but continued to supply uniforms to some MLB teams through the end of the 2004 season, when Majestic Athletic became the exclusive supplier to uniforms to MLB, something which continued until the end of the 2019 season, when Nike took over the MLB uniform contract.MLB pens ten-year Nike uniform deal by Sam Carp on Sports Pro Media, 25 Jan 2019 =Acquisition= On April 17, 2006, Berkshire Hathaway agreed to purchase 100% of Russell. Finally on August 1, 2006, Russell shareholders approved the sale of their firm to Berkshire Hathaway for $18.00 per share in cash. The acquisition was successfully completed on the following day. Russell's brands joined Fruit of the Loom in the Berkshire Hathaway family of products. =International operations= Over the last decade Russell Athletic expanded under licence of Russell Brands to a number of markets around the world focusing on their signature authentic American sportswear and the story behind the invention of the sweatshirt.

In early 2015 Russell Athletic Europe visited one of their factories and filmed the process of the making of a T-shirt.The T-Shirt How It's Made on Russell website =Refocus and reversal= On September 28, 2017, Russell Athletic said it would be exiting the team uniform manufacturing business after 115 years, and the company would be refocused on activewear for the consumer apparel market. The company cited that companies like Nike, Adidas, and Under Armour (which all started making athletic footwear) starting their own team uniform units, and as a result eating away at Russell's market share in that department was a contributing factor in discontinuing Russell's team uniform manufacturing business. However, the company reversed course and restarted its uniform manufacturing department, via a partnership with Georgia-based company,Augusta Sportswear, Inc. company profile on Hoovers.com Augusta Sportswear.

It is an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor), which inhibits the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II and may potentiate some of the pharmacological actions of bradykinin. It has a molecular formula of C53H76N14O12 and has been looked at as an antihypertension agent. Isolation and synthesis The antihypertensive effects of teprotide were first observed by Sergio Ferreira in 1965 and it was first isolated by Ferreira et al. along with eight other peptides in 1970. Teprotide was synthesized in 1970 by Ondetti et al. and from there its antihypertensive properties were studied more closely. Medical use Teprotide was chosen as a lead because of its long-lasting in vivo activity. This was demonstrated by Bianchi et al. by administering teprotide to dogs and rats and observing that it inhibited the vasopressor response induced by angiotensin I. Teprotide was shown to be an effective antihyperension agent but it had limited use because of its expense and lack of oral activity. It was found that teprotide inhibits the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II. From this researchers conducted structure-activity studies which allowed them to identify the active binding site of the ACE which allowed for the development of antihypertension drugs to be developed. Captopril was the first antihypertension drug developed by Ondetti and Cushman. Many ACE inhibitors have been developed since this time but this was the start of them.

It is characterised by having stalked teliospores borne on telia each having a row of four or more cells. All species have a caeoma which is a diffuse aecidium lacking a peridium.Fungi. Lilian E Hawker, 1966, Hutchinson University Library There are a number of species of Phragmidium, most of which are restricted to one or a few host species. Examples include: *Phragmidium acuminatum on Rubus saxatile *Phragmidium bulbosum on Rubus fruticosus and Rubeus caesius *Phragmidium mucronatum *Phragmidium sterilis on Potentilla sterilis *Phragmidium potentillae on Potentilla anglica *Phragmidium rosae-pimpinellifoliae *Phragmidium rubi-idaei on raspberry *Phragmidium tuberculatum on some rose cultivars *Phragmidium violaceum on cultivated blackberry and loganberry Possibly the most commonly encountered is P. mucronatum, found on most species of wild roses including Rosa canina and Rosa arvensis. Hosts and symptoms Phragmidium tuberculatum, also known as rose rust, is a parasitic fungus that feeds on living cells of a host plant. It can affect all species of the family Rosaceae. This includes all species of roses. Rose rust causes distortion and discoloration on stems. Sometimes it will cause galls and lesions. In the spring, there are yellow spots on the upper portion of the leaf and during the Spring and Summer there are orange spores on the abaxial surface of the leaf. Environment The climate most favorable to rose rust is mild temperatures with high moisture. Most of this strain of Phragmidium is found in Europe but there have been cases found in Asia and North America. Most of the cases of rose rust in the United States are found on the coasts, mainly the Pacific Coast. The Midwest is poor for this pathogen because of its extreme winter and summer temperatures. Disease cycle In the spring, the very first spores, spermatogonia, arise out of the debris on the ground and infects the young stem, distorting them and producing orange pustules. These pustules break open and infect the leaves. In the Summer, these darker orange spores called urediniospores spread through wind. Eventually in late August, the urediniospores and sori become speckled with black fascicles and dark resting spores called teliospores. The teliospores turn into aeciospores which are the spores that adhere to stems and leaves to overwinter. Pathology Roses infected with species of Phragmidium will show a characteristic orange mass of spores and distorted growth at specific locations on the bush. The rose may be substantially weakened and lack vigour and may die. Later in the year, small black spots or raised areas will be visible. These are telia containing overwintering teliospores. Prevention Rose growers recommend the use of fungicides some of which may have health implications for the gardener.Fungicides: Chemistry, Environmental Impact and Health Effects, Costa and Bezerra Many cultivated roses are now bred to have resistance to rust diseases. In wild roses, Phragmidium infections are one of a normal range of pests and diseases which are part of the normal ecological pressures affecting all species. Non-chemical controls include pruning out the spring infections as soon as possible along with collecting and destroying fallen leaves to prevent overwintering.

Description This ant is distinctively coloured with the head, antennae, thorax, legs and petiole and the anterior part of the first abdominal segment reddish or ochre-brown. The remainder of the abdomen is black or deep brown. The integument is smooth and reflective, though fine sculpturing granules can be seen under magnification. The propodeum is longer than it is wide. Posteriorly, the propodeum is concave with some fine vertical striations. The head and body are hairless.Identification and nesting Sites of North American species of Dolichoderus Distribution This ant has a wide range which includes Illinois, Minnesota and Oklahoma, North and South Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana and northern Florida. The type locality is Vineland, New Jersey.Smith, D. R., 1979. Superfamily Formicoidea. In Catalog of Hymenoptera in America north of Mexico. Eds. Krombein, K. V., P. D. Hurd, Jr., D. R. Smith, and B. D. Burks. Smithsonian Institution Press, Washington, D. C., P 1323-1467. It is common in some areas such as North and South Carolina, but rare in others and in the southern part of its range it can be confused with the similar species, Dolichoderus pustulatus. Ecology This ant is found in prairies, glades and fens. It nests underground among plant roots.AntWeb A study of this species was undertaken in northern Florida. It was found that the worker ants remove soil from under clumps of wiregrass, other grasses or other fibrous rooted plants such as blackberry (Rubus spp.) or cattails (Typha spp.). The nest is a single, large conical chamber, which is open to the air round the base of the plant. Colonies make a number of these nests which are linked by trails across the ground along which ants move from one to another. There are many queens per nest. Over the winter there are just one or two nests in a colony but as summer advances, more and more chambers are excavated and there may be as many as sixty nests by late summer. After this the number starts to contract again. The colonies occupy roughly the same area each summer and territorial aggression has been noted between adjoining colonies. Within their territory, the ants tend and milk aphids and scale insects for their honeydew and also scavenge for dead insects. The size of the colony and the number of nests seemed to depend on the number of hemipterans in the territorial area. When these are abundant during the winter, the colony does not contract to such a great extent as when the season is harsh. Observations inside nests showed that the workers, queen, alates and brood took up stations on the fibrous roots which formed a sort of scaffolding in their nests. The size of the nest varied with the size of the root system of the plant above. During the summer, above some of the nests, workers chewed bits of plant material to produce a papery felt or thatch. However, it was not clear why this was done for some nests and not others. During the winter, the average nest housed about 75,000 workers and 12 to 59 queens. In the summer, the number of workers ranged from 13,000 to 19,000 while there were about 180 queens per nest. Alates first appeared in April but the majority were found in July. Nuptial flights took place early in the morning after heavy rains with thousands of male alates taking to the wing in search of other nests or colonies. The female alates mostly remained at their nests of origin where they presumably mated and joined the other queens already present. During the winter, the abandoned nests provide shelter for vertebrates and invertebrates such as snakes, lizards and ground dwelling spiders.

Games Magazine named, ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù the ‚ÄúBest Party Game Runner Up‚Äù for 2009 (released in December 2008 issue). Gameplay Each What? card has three category questions that each equal one ‚Äòround‚Äô. Question 1 is a General category with short snappy questions that always begin with ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù. Question 2 is the Personal category where the Questioner fills in the blank with someone's name. The name can be someone playing the game, a famous person that everyone knows, or even a fictional or generic character. Question 3 is a Sticky Situation category where players are faced with predicaments that always end up asking, ‚ÄúWhat do you do?‚Äù. There is one Questioner who reads a question out loud to the group of players. Everyone writes down their answer. Answers can be dead honest truths or outright lies. The Questioner reads all the answers out loud and chooses his/her favorite response. The goal is for each player to correctly guess who wrote the response. Answers that correctly guess the author score one point. If nobody guesses the author correctly, the author scores 3 points. After this round is over, the Questioner returns the What? card to the bottom of the pile, then the player on his/her left becomes the Questioner and reads a question from the next category.

It was formally described in 2011.  Ecology  Meconopsis autumnalis grows in sub-alpine habitat commonly along stream margins, grassy alpine slopes or at edges and openings of Abies forest. Commonly associated herbaceous species include Rumex, Arisaema, Stellaria, Nepeta, Persicaria, Aster, Swertia, as well as dwarf shrubs such as Berberis, Rhododendron and Juniperus. The species ranges in elevation from 3300‚Äì4200 m, favouring stony, humus-rich soils. Similar to Meconopsis manasluensis and other Meconopsis of Nepal, the species appears to exhibit a very limited geographic distribution, thus necessitating more in- depth conservation assessment.

It also stars Connor Paolo, Danielle Harris and Kelly McGillis. The plot revolves around an orphaned young man being taken under the wing of a vampire hunter known only as \\"Mister\\", and the battle for survival in their quest for a safe haven.  Plot  When a pandemic of vampirism strikes, humans find themselves on the run from vicious, feral beasts. Large cities are left as tombs and survivors cling together in rural pockets, fearing nightfall. When his family is slaughtered, young Martin (Paolo) is taken under the wing of a grizzled, wayward vampire hunter, called Mister (Damici). Mister takes Martin on a journey through the locked-down towns of America's heartland, searching for a better place in the famed 'New Eden', up north, while taking down any bloodsuckers that cross their path. Along the way, they are joined by fellow travellers, the first being a nun known only as Sister (McGillis), whom they rescue from two young rapists whom Mister kills without hesitation. They continue to move north, avoiding major thoroughfares that have been seized by The Brotherhood, a fundamentalist militia headed by such fanatics as Jebedia Loven (Michael Cerveris), who interprets the plague as God's will at work. The group is then captured by The Brotherhood and it is revealed that one of the rapists killed by Mister was Loven's son. As punishment, Mister is left at the mercy of a group of vampires, while Sister is taken as a sex slave and Martin will be kept as a forced convert to the Brotherhood. Martin promptly escapes the Brotherhood camp and discovers that Mister has survived the vampire attack and they drive off together, unable to help Sister. Coming across a survivors' roadhouse, they pick up another traveler, the pregnant Belle (Harris), who hopes to make it to New Eden to have her child. Later, they also pick up Willie (Sean Nelson), a former Marine, who is found hiding in a workmen's toilet having been abandoned as vampire bait by The Brotherhood. Willie informs the group that American military forces were withdrawn from the Middle East to help contain the outbreak, and that there is no Middle East to fight over anymore, as it is completely overrun by vampires. He goes on to say that The Brotherhood was partially responsible for the fall of America, ramming cars filled with vampires through blockades and crashing airplanes filled with vampires into cities. Overwhelmed as the plague spread across the U.S., the Armed Forces collapsed and no longer exist. The four decide to go after Jebedia, whom they successfully ambush, then tie to a tree and leave for the vampires. The group next encounters a survivors' settlement and discover that Sister also escaped. The same night, celebrations are interrupted when The Brotherhood, using helicopters, drops vampires into town, killing many residents. Though invited to stay and help rebuild the settlement, the group decides to move on towards the north again. Midway, their car breaks down and they have to continue their journey on foot. They manage to avoid dangerous areas for some time but, while sleeping at an abandoned auto junk yard, they are attacked by 'berserkers', the oldest and strongest kind of vampire. They run into a corn field, and Sister diverts the chase away from the others, then shoots herself in the head when overrun. After several days of walking through the wilderness, they take shelter in a broken-down school bus turned camper and notice in the morning that Willie is missing. The three search for him, first finding his blanket then finding Willie killed and strung up in a tree. Mister notes he has never encountered a thinking vampire before and warns the others to stay alert. Despite their best efforts, Belle is taken from their campsite during the night and Mister and Martin find her in an abandoned silo the following day, wrapped in barbed wire and bitten. Jebedia Loven, now a thinking vampire thanks to having given himself willingly to the vampires that attacked him, reveals himself and attacks Martin and then Mister. Martin manages to impale Jebedia, and an injured Mister is successful in finishing him off. Martin mercy kills the dying Belle, saving her from becoming a vampire. The duo then heads north again, acquiring a pickup truck, and they meet Peggy, who lives alone in an abandoned restaurant and who picks off approaching vampires using a crossbow. Martin and Peggy have an instant connection, and Martin easily attacks and kills a vamp outside the restaurant that night, with Mister covertly looking on. The next day, Mister is gone and Martin finds his mentor's skull pendant hanging from the truck's mirror. He and Peggy head off by themselves, finally arriving at the border to Canada, or the New Eden for which they were searching.  Cast  * Nick Damici as Mister, hunter of the zombie-like vampires who takes Martin under his wing while traveling north. * Connor Paolo as Martin, in his early to mid-teens when he first meets Mister. * Danielle Harris as Belle, a young woman who is pregnant when she starts traveling with Mister and Martin. According to Damici, Belle was originally written as an older character and something of a love interest for Mister. After interviewing Harris, Damici thought she seemed more like his character's \\"grandkid\\", and that they could rewrite the script accordingly. * Kelly McGillis as Sister, a nun saved from two rapists by Mister and Martin who then begins traveling with them. Stake Land was the first feature film for McGillis after a ten-year hiatus from acting. * Michael Cerveris as Jebedia Loven, a cult leader who claims the vamps are sent to do his and the Lord's work. * Sean Nelson as Willie, a former Marine picked up on the road. * Bonnie Dennison as Peggy, slightly older than Martin, she is found living alone in a roadside diner. * Chance Kelly as Officer Harley * Marianne Hagan as Dr. Foley * Larry Fessenden as the roadhouse bartender. Fessenden also produced the film. * Gregory Jones as Martin's father * Traci Hovel as Martin's mother  Prequels  The producers, Glass Eye Pix, created seven webisodes as prequels set during the start of the apocalypse, to coincide with the release of the film. * Origins (Directed by Larry Fessenden): A boy is filming his father, a butcher, on the job for a school project. He continues filming the family at dinner as a news report about the plague can be heard in the background. Later, the boy goes outside to see his father but the man, turned into a vampire, begins chasing the boy, who runs back to his house and is attacked by his mother, also turned. The father then slashes the boy's head off his body. * The Day I Told My Boyfriend (Written and directed by Graham Reznik, story by Nick Damici): Belle lets her boyfriend know about her pregnancy as they ride in his car. They are immediately involved in a car accident and Belle, trapped in the upside-down, smashed car, sees her motionless boyfriend being dragged away into a field. * Jebedia (Written and directed by Larry Fessenden): Jebedia Loven reads the Bible while receiving a tattoo on the back of his head. * Willie (Written and directed by Danielle Harris, story by Nick Damici): Former Marine Willie is walking through a rural area, dragging a body. He arrives at a treeline where another body is hung. He kneels down, using a Rosary to pray before continuing his journey into woods alone. * Sister (Directed by JT Petty, story by Nick Damici): Sister is alone in her church. A body, wrapped in cloth, begins to twitch, and other wrapped bodies are revealed. Sister drags them outside and douses them with gas, then begins praying. A truck pulls up and three men get out, two of them dressed in Brotherhood robes. One removes his robes to reveal he is naked underneath. Sister tosses a lit candle on the dead bodies and looks at the men. * Martin (Written and directed by Glenn McQuaid): Martin is having a dream about himself and the plague, when his mother wakes him and tells him to pack a bag. He hears noises outside the house but joins his mother to head out. Both characters are wearing the same clothes as in the initial scene in the film. * Mister (Directed by Larry Fessenden, written by Nick Damici): Mister makes his way to his childhood home in the woods, where his father has had to shoot his mother after she turned. The father then dies, and Mister retrieves his skull pendant from around his neck before burying him and his mother.  Production  Stake Land was originally envisioned by Mickle and Damici, who had worked together on the film Mulberry Street in 2006, as a web series about a vampire hunter that they could produce cheaply, \\"on the weekends.\\" They had developed forty and brought them to producer Larry Fessenden, who suggested a feature film instead. Fessenden, a producer on the film and mentor to Mickle, rejected an early script that he felt lacked heart. Mickle agreed and reworked the script to emphasize feelings of isolation over bloodshed. Mickle and Damici specifically wanted to include happy moments and co-operation in the script, as they felt that many post-Apocalyptic films were unremittingly grey. Religious extremists were added to show their toxic effect on society. They also wanted to emphasize reality, and they avoided overly stylized action sequences. Mickle and Damici also wanted to emphasize more than just monsters and a vampire plague. Mickle states that he wanted to make a film that would still work without the horror elements. Mickle was unaware of Danielle Harris' history in horror films, and he was more familiar with her work on sitcoms. Shooting took place in Pennsylvania, upstate New York, and the Catskills Mountains. There was a three-month hiatus in the shooting schedule so that the seasons could change for the exterior shots. Shooting took 26 days. The long take in the survivor's settlement, with the vampires being dropped by the brotherhood, was not originally planned that way but evolved as time limitations forced the scene into a single day's shooting. Mickle decided that the best way to solve the time issues was to get it over with as a single take. In the end, only a few frames were edited out to remove poor acting from extras. The score was performed by Glass Eye Pix regular Jeff Grace, whose work on The Last Winter had impressed Mickle.  Release  The film opened on one screen on April 22, 2011, and made $7,258 in its first week. In its second week, the film expanded to five screens and made an additional $8,437. The total domestic gross for the film in its limited theatrical run was $33,245. It was released on home video August 2, 2011.  Reception  The film received fairly positive reviews with Rotten Tomatoes giving the film a 75% \\"fresh\\" rating from 60 reviews; the consensus states: \\"Though the genre is well worn at this point, director Jim Mickle focuses on strong characterization and eerie atmosphere to craft an effective apocalyptic vampire chiller that also manages to pack a mean punch.\\" At the site Metacritic, which assigns films a weighted average score of 0 to 100, the film received a score of 66 based on 15 mainstream critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars out of four, writing that \\"Director Jim Mickle, who co-wrote the film with his star, Nick Damici, has crafted a good looking, well-played and atmospheric apocalyptic vision.\\" Alissa Simon of Variety called it \\"a highly satisfying low-budget horror-thriller\\". Serena Whitney of Dread Central rated it four out of five stars and called it \\"a taut thriller replete with gripping emotion behind it\\". Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times named it a NYT Critics' Pick and called it \\"unusually taut\\". Salon made it their \\"pick of the week\\", and praised it for its focus on characters rather than monsters. However, Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out New York rated it one out of five stars and wrote, \\"You really shouldn't see Stake Land‚Äîeven if you are in the mood for lax, uninspired end-of-the-world-with-vampires thrills.\\" The film was shown at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF), where it won the Midnight Madness Cadillac People's Choice Award.  Sequel  In June 2016, it was revealed that a sequel had been filmed and would be released as a Syfy original film later in the year. The sequel, titled Stake Land II: The Stakelander, premiered on Syfy on October 15, 2016.

Sports in Somalia are regulated by the Ministry of Sports of Somalia. The government ministry works closely with the Somali Olympic Committee and various sports governing bodies, including the Somali Football Federation. Abdi Bile from Las Anod is Somalia's most decorated athlete in history; Abdi Bile also holds the highest number of Somali national records. The longest continuously serving national team captains of Somalia's two most popular sports, basketball and football, are Yusuf Qaafow and Hasan Babay respectively. History In the late 1920s, Italian authorities began to organize sport in Somalia. The Italian-organized sports were initially concentrated only in the capital Mogadishu and practiced by Italian Somalians.Sport e fascismo (in Italian); p. 248 In 1931 governor Maurizio Rava created the Federazione Sportiva della Somalia, which organized competences of athletics, tennis and football and promoted the first sport activities among the young native population. In 1933 the first Somalian football championship was created, called Coppa Federazione Sportiva, with three teams (\\"Societa' Mogadiscio\\", \\"Marina\\" and \\"Milizia\\") from the capital. In 1938 the football championship was won by the \\"Amaruini\\" team, made up mainly of local Somalians; in 1939 the winning team was the \\"Araba\\". In 1938 competitions of other sports, like swimming, basketball, athletics and cycling, were held: the boxing was practiced by Ballin Nur and Isac Barrachi, two Somalis champions with international fame.Sport in fascist Somalia; p.250 In 1938 Mogadishu's first auto race (the \\"Circuito di Mogadiscio\\") was held.1938 Car race of Mogadishu (in Italian) After World War II, motorcycle races were held in Mogadishu:Postcard of the 1953 Moto race the \\"Circuito Mogadiscio\\" was done only with motorcycles races and was called Gran Premio Motociclistico della Somalia (GP Motorcycle of Somalia). It was celebrated from 1950 until 1954, when the Italian governmnent obtained the \\"Somalia Trusteeship\\" from the ONU. The race was held on the coastal streets of Mogadiscio, near the port and on \\"Lungomare Corni\\", Mogadiscio postcard: Lungomare Corni in 1939 and was more than one mile long.Corriere della Somalia of August 7, 1951 (in Italian) In 1956 the first stadium in Somalia was built by the Italian National Olympic Committee:http://www.aipsmedia.com/index.php?page=news&cod;=3762&tp;=n the Banadir Stadium in Mogadishu. In 2008, BBC Somali correspondent Maxamed Xaaji Xuseen described Abdi Bile as \\"yahay ciyaartoyda ugu caansan ee soo marta taariikhda Soomaaliya\\", which roughly translates as Abdi Bile is Somalia's most famous athlete in history, or Abdi Bile is the greatest athlete in Somalia's history.https://www.bbc.com/somali/news/story/2008/10/081017_cabdi_bile.shtml The Somalist scholar Cabdiraxmaan Cismaan Aw Aadan, in his 2014 list of 100 most notable Somalis, listed Abdi Bile as the greatest Somali athlete in general.https://www.academia.edu/30879633/BOQOLKA_QOF_EE_SOMALI_UGU_CAANSAN.docx Football Gedo province football trophy. Football is the most popular sport amongst Somalis. The first football teams in Somalia were established in the 1930s by the Italian colonial authorities. The competitions were basic in structure, and were associated with the anti-colonial movement after WW2. The Somali Youth League (SYL), the nation's first political party, had put together a team of local youth to play against the Italian expatriate teams. In 1955 -during the Trust Territory of Somalia under Italian administration- was created the first football stadium in Mogadishu: the Coni Stadium, later called Banadir Stadium. The teams that played a Trust Territory of Somalia championship with the stadium inauguration were: \\"Lavori Publici\\", \\"Autoparco\\", \\"El Gab\\", \\"Sicurezza\\", \\"Somali Police FC\\" and \\"AS Mogadiscio\\".\\"Corriere di Mogadiscio\\", page # 3 of November 28, 1955 (in Italian) In 1958, the first commissioner for sport in Somalia was also established. The football squad that the SYL had assembled, which would later change its name to Bondhere, won the first several competitions. However, it was not as successful in its early forays against foreign teams. Important countrywide competitions are the Somalia League and Somalia Cup. The Ocean Stars, the national team, is popularly known as the \\"giant killers\\" because of its underdog status, and the upsets it has achieved during games against better funded and established teams at continental tournaments. A multi-ethnic squad, Somalia first participated at the Olympic Games in 1972 and has sent athletes to compete in most Summer Olympic Games since then. The equally diverse Somali beach soccer team also represents the country in international beach soccer competitions. In addition, several international footballers such as Mohammed Ahamed Jama, Liban Abdi, Ayub Daud and Abdisalam Ibrahim play in European top leagues. On 17 December 2015, Horseed FC vs Heegan FC became the first association football match to be aired live in Somalia. Track and field In track and field, Abdi Bile, one of the most successful athletes from Somalia, won the 1500 m World Championship in 1987, running the fastest final 800 m of any 1,500 meter race in history. He was a two-time Olympian (1984 and 1996) and dominated the event in the late 1980s. Bile was ranked first in the world at the mile distance in 1989. He was World Cup champion in the 1500 m in 1989 and two-time world Grand Prix final champion. Hussein Ahmed Salah, a Somalia-born former long-distance runner from Djibouti, won a bronze medal in the marathon at the 1988 Summer Olympics. He also won silver medals in this event at the 1987 and 1991 World Championships, as well as the 1985 IAAF World Marathon Cup. Many Somalia-born athletes have found success in the diaspora. Mohamed Suleiman, who competes for Qatar, achieved the greatest success of his career when he won the bronze medal in the Barcelona Olympics, becoming the first-ever Olympic medallist for Qatar. Throughout his career, Suleiman ran several Asian records over 1500 m and the mile run. He won the gold medal in the 1500 m representing Asia at the 1992 IAAF World Cup. Suleiman ran for Qatar at two further Olympic Games (in 1996 and 2000) and reached the event finals, although he did not make the podium. Suleiman's younger brothers Nasser and Abdulrahman Suleiman have also competed internationally in middle-distance running ‚Äì Abdulrahman was the 2002 Asian champion for the 1500 m.Mohan, K. P.

Basketball Somalia's Faisal Aden set the scoring record for points in an official match between basketball national teams. The Somalia national basketball team is a member of the International Basketball Federation (FIBA). Although the squad has yet to pass the qualifications stages for the FIBA World Championship, it won a bronze medal in the 1981 FIBA Africa Championship, when Somalia hosted the tournament. The team also participates in the basketball event at the Pan Arab Games. In January 2013, national basketball team player Faisal Aden scored 59 points against the Rwanda squad. This remains the global scoring record in an official international FIBA match. Bandy In 2013, a Somalia national bandy team was formed in Borl√§nge, Sweden, by Somali expats. The team later participated in the 2014 Bandy World Championship in Irkutsk and Shelekhov in Russia. Six of the players took part in the Federation of International Bandy's October 2013 camp in ABB Arena, which was open to developing bandy countries.

In the , Amamoor had a population of 636 people. History The town is named after a pastoral run held by J.D. McTaggart in the late 1850s. It is an Aboriginal word meaning swimming in water or a swimming creek. When the construction of a railway line between Brisbane and Gympie was being contemplated in 1884‚Äì5, one of the routes being considered was through the Mary Valley. However, this was not the route chosen, and the residents of the valley who were disappointed at missing out on rail connection agitated for many years until the Mary Valley branch line was built. The first section south from Monkland to Kandanga (via Amamoor) was completed in October 1914. The second stage to Brooloo was completed in April 1915. The final stage to Kenilworth was to be built in 1920 but was never completed. Amamoor Post Office opened around 1920 and Amamoor State School opened on 10 October 1921. It was relocated to its current location in Elizabeth Street in the 1950s. In 1993, the services on the Mary Valley railway line were reduced, terminating at Melawondi, and the entire line was closed in 1994, ending Amamoor's rail connection.  Heritage listings  Amamoor has heritage-listed sites, including: * Mary Valley Railway Cream Sheds Geography Amamoor is south of Gympie. The Bruce Highway passes to the east of the town and the Amamoor Forest Reserve is to the west. Amamoor is situated on the Amamoor Creek which is a tributary of the Mary River.

It's what she's been trained to do: manipulate biocyph to terraform alien worlds, while the Crib - her employer - drains the Fringe populations dry. When a band of rovers kidnaps her, Edie can't decide if it's a blessing or a curse. Until they leash her to her new bodyguard, Finn - a serf whose past isn't clear to anyone. If she strays from his side, he dies; if she fails to cooperate, the rovers will kill them both. The deal worsens when Edie finds they're taking her to her one failure... a planet called Scarabaeus. The world itself has a few surprises in store for Edie. Characters *Edie Sha'nim - The best cypherteck in the galaxy, Edie was born half Talasai. This half of her genetics left her dependent on the neuroxin found only on Talas. She was trained by the Crib to seed worlds, but isn't happy about the politics that go along with her station. *Finn - A serf, Finn was liberated from his labor gang when Edie cut the tie to the implanted boundary chip in his head.

As is typical for agricultural pests, the species is known by a number of common names, including lemon wheat blossom midge, wheat blossom midge, wheat yellow blossom midge, yellow wheat blossom midge, and yellow wheat gall midge The Database of the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO) . Description The typical insect is 1/30 of an inch long, orange red, with whitish wings hairy on the edges, and black eyes. They deposit their eggs in the centre of the corolla of the wheat flower, coming out in great numbers between 7 and 9 p.m. early in June, several laying on the same ear. The eggs are hatched in eight to ten days. The larvae, footless grubs nearly an eighth of an inch long when fully grown, feed upon the flower, rendering it abortive, and not upon the stem like the Hessian fly. They are yellowish, with sharp head and truncated tail, and have a quick wriggling motion. By the first of August they descend about half an inch into the earth, and remain there through the winter. The pupa is narrower, rufous, and sharp at both ends. History An insect considered by Harris the same appeared in northern New England about 1828, whence it spread to Canada, Massachusetts, and New York, and disappeared only by being starved out by a change of crop or the substitution of late sown spring wheat. (See Harris, On the Insects injurious to Vegetation.) Treatment In the late 19th century, the most efficacious remedies were: fumigations with sulphur for several evenings in succession while the grain was in blossom, lime and ashes strewn over them when wet with dew, liming and ploughing the soil into which they have burrowed, and sowing late in spring or early in autumn. A little black ichneumon fly deposits her eggs within these larvae, and destroys many.

Following a sale of the vessel in May, 1912, this boat was known as Bay Island. Career In 1899, the Hunt Brothers, a family steamboat business, had Crest built at Tacoma for service on the Tacoma-Gig Harbor routeNewell, ed., McCurdy Marine History, at 32, 49, 203. Crest was built according to a tear drop shaped design, which was originated by the Hunt brothers. While this did not increase the speed of the boat, it allowed the vessel to carry more passengers and cargo at the same speed. In 1902 the Hunt Brothers divided their interest in the firm's boats, with Emmett Hunt taking ownership of Crest.Gig Harbor Museum, ‚ÄúSteamboats and the Hunt Brothers‚Äù (accessed 04-14-2011) In 1912, Emmett Hunt, for $11,500, sold Crest to the Hale Passage and Wollochet Bay Navigation Company, which was a farmer's cooperative seeking a way to lower transport costs on produce. The cooperative renamed the vessel Bay Island. Bay Island made as many as 10 stops along the cooperative's route in Hale Passage and Wollochet Bay, and ran in the evening so the produce cargo would be fresh in the morning at the market. Bay Island was abandoned in 1929.

He attended the public schools of the various places where his father served as a Methodist minister. He became interested in socialism as a boy, through the influence of his Sunday school teacher, a German iron moulder, who started him reading Socialist literature. He joined the Socialist Party as soon as he was permitted to join (the age of 18). He graduated in 1909 from North Division High School (Milwaukee), and attended the University of Wisconsin. He graduated from the University of Wisconsin Law School, and was admitted to the Wisconsin bar in 1916. He then returned to Milwaukee to practice. Later in life he was a strong proponent of Esperanto. He died on July 10, 1975 at a nursing home in Black Earth, Wisconsin.

Due to Tacitus's usage of interpretatio romana elsewhere in the text, his admitted uncertainty, and his reasoning for referring to the veneration of an Egyptian goddess by the Suebi‚Äîa group of Germanic peoples‚Äîscholars have generally held that Tacitus's identification is incorrect, and have debated what goddess Tacitus refers to. Attestation In chapter 9 of Germania, Tacitus, employing interpretatio romana (a process in which what an author deems Roman equivalents are listed in place of non-Roman deity names), says that the Suebi principally venerate \\"Mercury\\", and that they regard it as sacral to offer him both human and non-human sacrifices on specific dates (unprovided). The Suebi also worship \\"Mars\\" and \\"Hercules\\", who they appease by offering animals in a traditional manner. Tacitus adds that a part of the Suebi, however, venerate \\"Isis\\", although he admits that he doesn't know how worship of Isis could have been imported: > {  Latin: : Stuart (1916:5).  Birley translation: :Part of the Suebi > sacrifice to Isis as well. I have little idea what the origin or explanation > of this foreign cult is, except that the goddess's emblem, which resembles a > light warship, indicates that the goddess came from abroad.Birley (1999:42). >  Rives translation: :Some of the Suebi sacrifice also to Isis. I cannot > determine the reason and origin of the foreign cult, but her emblem, > fashioned in the form of a Liburnian ship, proves that her worship comes > from abroad.Rives (1999); page number not provided in text.  } Theories and interpretations While Tacitus's \\"Mercury\\", \\"Mars\\", and \\"Hercules\\" are generally held to refer to Odin, Tyr, and Thor respectively, the identity of \\"Isis\\" has been a matter of debate. In his translation of Germania, scholar J. B. Rives comments that while, in Tacitus's time, the cult of Isis was widespread and is well attested in provinces on the border of Germania, Tacitus's identification is problematic because the cult of Isis seems to have spread with Greco-Roman culture. Rives comments that \\"most scholars believe that Tacitus has misidentified a native Germanic ritual that bore some resemblance to a well-known Isiac ritual that involved a ship [...]\\".Rives (1999) footnote number 27. Page number not provided in text. In a 2012 paper, Joseph S. Hopkins and Haukur √ûorgeirsson propose a connection between a Vanir goddess, particularly Freyja, and the ship symbolism of the \\"Isis\\" of the Suebi. The two propose that Old Norse texts mentioning F√≥lkvangr and Sessr√∫mnir present an image of a 'ship in the field', implying a strong association between Freyja and ship imagery, particularly the stone ships of Scandinavia.Hopkins and Haukur (2012:14-17).

Similar to hand-kissing, the person giving the greeting bows towards the hand of the elder and presses their forehead on the elder's hand. Usually performed with the right hand, the person showing respect may ask \\"Mano po\\" or \\"[Pa-]bless po\\" to the elder in order to ask permission to initiate the gesture. Typically someone may mano to their older relatives upon entry into their home or upon seeing them. The word mano is Spanish for hand while the word po is often used in Filipino culture and language at the end of each sentence as a sign of respect when addressing someone older, akin to English (sir/ma'am). Put together, mano po literally translates to [your] hand please as the greeting initiates the gesture of touching the back of the hand of an elder lightly on one‚Äôs forehead. An identical tradition is followed in neighbouring Indonesia and Malaysia called salim and salam respectively, suggesting that the mano po tradition dates to precolonial times. Historical Accounts \\"Of the civilities, terms of courtesy, and good breeding among the Filipinos. Chapter XVI...As among them it is not courtesy to remain standing before a person whom they respect, they seat themselves upon the ground, or rather on their heel- bones. Seated in this way, with head uncovered and the potong thrown like a towel over the left shoulder, they talk with their superiors. The mode of salutation upon entering or meeting anyone is as follows: They draw the body together and make a low reverence, raising one or both hands to the face, and placing them upon the cheeks; they next sit down waiting for the question that may be put to them, for it is considered bad manners to speak before one is spoken to.\\" Fr. Pedro Chirino, Relacion de Islas Filipinas (1604) \\"422. The natives of these islands employ innumerable other elegancies and courtesies, now in actions, now in words, now in names and titles, which they apply to themselves; these are various according to the difference of the provinces, and are too numerous to mention, for they are ceremonial, and they value their ceremonies highly. No one will pass in front of another, without asking permission, and in order to pass, he doubles the whole body with the most profound bow, at the same time lifting one foot in the air, and doubling the knee and lifting both hands to the face. If one has to talk to any person of higher rank, he shows all reverence and squats down [pone en cuclillas], with raised face, and waits thus, until he is asked his reason for coming; for to speak without being questioned would be a point of bad breeding.\\" Fr. Juan de San Antonio, Cronicas (1738)  Origin  The custom of mano is dated to precolonial times, and is still followed by the related countries of Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei, which the Philippines shares a common ethnolinguistical origin with. In these countries however, the custom is called salim originating from Arabic. Salim is also done in the family to respect elder family members and relatives. Salim is also a normal gesture done in a traditional Islamic society to respect the ulama (religious elite/scholars).  Usage and context  In today's Philippine setting, the mano is still used by Filipinos as a sign of respect to their elders. It is usually done when the elder is seen for the first time in the day or upon entering a house or gathering. There is no age limit for the usage of the mano, but it is usually practiced on those older by two generations or more. By offering your hand to mano, you are allowing yourself to be subservient to the elder to accept their blessing and wisdom. It is considered impolite if one does not exercise the custom of pagmamano when entering the home of an elder or after seeing them at a gathering. The respect for elders stems from the high value of family in Filipino culture. Filipinos are loyal to their family, such that the elderly live in the homes of their children and/or grandchildren to be taken care of, and the nursing home business is almost nonexistent in the Philippines. By having the elderly live at home, you are respecting their value in the family. Though the mano po gesture is usually practiced on one's parents, grandparents, uncles, and aunts, it is not restricted to one‚Äôs relatives. Godparents are often greeted this way as well. During the Spanish colonial era, Catholic priests were also greeted this way alongside the European practice of hand-kissing, and this still continues today often after a Catholic Mass, though the latter has fallen out of use. The reason why Filipinos mano elders although they are not necessarily a relative is due to the value of family. Filipinos call older non-relatives \\"grandfather/mother, aunt, uncle, etc.\\" even when they are not actually related in this way. By addressing elders in this way, you are acknowledging their age and the respect you need to show them. It‚Äôs considered to be disrespectful to call an elder just by their first name. Hence, Filipinos treat friends and acquaintances like family. The mano po gesture is usually followed by a response of \\"God bless you\\" or \\"May the Lord have mercy on you\\" by the elder; the sign of the cross may be made over the recipient. The latter response of \\"May the Lord have mercy on you\\" is used when the pagmamano is performed with both hands to ask an elder's pardon and forgiveness. With both hands, the younger person takes the elder's hands and lifts them to the forehead to formally ask forgiveness for an offence. This may be done whilst kneeling and weeping. This is the highest form of the pagmamano.  Similar Filipino customs  = Beso-Beso = Though the mano po gesture is still widely used at present in the Philippines, many Filipinos have also replaced this gesture with the beso. The beso-beso which originated from the Spanish word for kiss, is a common greeting in the Philippines similar to the mano. The beso-beso is a cheek-to-cheek kiss. The beso is more commonly used amongst the upper classes as a greeting to relatives and close friends, but is not reserved for an older person unlike the mano. = Po and opo = Similar to the mano po gesture, po and opo are also distinctly Filipino ways of showing respect to one‚Äôs elders. The po is usually affixed to the end of sentences or phrases when one is addressing someone older than him or her. For example, paumanhin in Filipino means sorry. To an elder, one would say paumanhin po, The word po alone does not really have its own meaning but adds formality and is used as a sign of respect. This is why it is affixed to mano and thus is said as mano po when one is requesting for the blessing of an elder.\\"Filipino Traditions and Customs\\". Retrieved on 6 January 2014.

Dryad is a curated general-purpose repository that makes data discoverable, freely reusable, and citable. The scientific, educational, and charitable mission of Dryad is to provide the infrastructure for and promote the re-use of scholarly research data. The vision of Dryad is a scholarly communication system in which learned societies, publishers, institutions of research and education, funding bodies and other stakeholders collaboratively sustain and promote the preservation and reuse of research data. Dryad aims to allow researchers to validate published findings, explore new analysis methodologies, re-purpose data for research questions unanticipated by the original authors, and perform synthetic studies such as formal meta-analyses. For many publications, existing data repositories do not capture the whole data package. As a result, many important datasets are not being preserved and are no longer available, or usable, at the time that they are sought by later investigators.Vision, T.J. (2010) Open Data and the Social Contract of Scientific Publishing. BioScience 60(5):330-330. Dryad serves as a repository for tables, spreadsheets, flat files, and all other kinds of published data for which specialized repositories do not already exist. Optimally, authors submit data to Dryad in conjunction with article publication, so that links to the data can be included in the published article. All data files in Dryad are associated with a published article, and are made available for reuse under the terms of a Creative Commons Zero waiver. Dryad is also a non-profit membership organization registered in the US, providing a forum for all stakeholders to set priorities for the repository, participate in planning, and share knowledge and coordinate action around data policies. Dryad is listed in the Registry of Research Data Repositories re3data.org. Features A citation to a Dryad data package on Wikipedia Embargoes chosen by Dryad data authors Dryad enables authors, journals, societies and publishers to facilitate data archiving at the time of publication, when the data are readily available. Data in Dryad receives a permanent, unique Digital object identifier (DOI), which can be included in the published article so that readers are able to access the data. Authors can archive data in Dryad and be assured of its preservation, while satisfying journals' and research funding agencies' mandates to disseminate their research outputs.Data Archiving. Michael C. Whitlock, Mark A. McPeek, Mark D. Rausher, Loren Rieseberg and Allen J. Moore, The American Naturalist, Vol. 175, No. 2 (February 2010), pp. 145-146 Authors submit data to Dryad either when the associated article is under review or has been accepted for publication. The choice depends on whether the journal includes data within the scope of peer reviewer. Authors may also submit data after an article has been published. Data submission is facilitated by journals sending notices of new manuscripts to Dryad. This saves authors from having to re-enter the bibliographic details when they upload their data files. Dryad curators review submitted data files and perform quality control on metadata descriptions before inclusion of new content in the repository. Dryad‚Äôs metadata approach emphasizes simplicity and interoperability, supported by a Dublin Core metadata application profile. The Metadata Research Center now at the College of Computing and Informatics, Drexel University, formerly served as Dryad‚Äôs central curation hub, with primary curation activity now taking place via the non-profit in North Carolina. Greenberg, J., White, H., C, Carrier, C. and Scherle, R. (2009). A Metadata Best Practice for a Scientific Data Repository. Journal of Library Metadata, 9:3, 194‚Äî212. Dryad coordinates data submission to specialized repositories where in order to (a) lower user burden by streamlining the submission workflow and (b) allow Dryad and specialized repositories to exchange identifiers and other metadata in order to enable cross-referencing of the different data products associated with a given publication. The first two handshaking partners are TreeBASE and GenBank, which Dryad's partner journals have previously identified as required points of deposition for phylogenetic tree data and DNA sequences, respectively. Governance, history and funding Dryad is governed by a twelve-member Board of Directors, elected by its Members. Members may be independent journals, societies, publishers, research and educational institutions, libraries, funders, or other organizations that support Dryad's mission. The organization coordinates data sharing policies and promotes the long-term sustainability of the repository. Dryad began charging submission fees in September 2013. Dryad is a nonprofit organization that provides long-term access to its contents at no cost to researchers, educators or students, irrespective of nationality or institutional affiliation. Dryad is able to provide free access to data due to financial support from members and data submitters. Dryad‚Äôs submission fees are designed to sustain its core functions by recovering the basic costs of curating and preserving data. Dryad emerged from a National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent) workshop entitled \\"Digital data preservation, sharing, and discovery: Challenges for Small Science Communities in the Digital Era\\" in May 2007. Initial funding for Dryad was provided by the National Science Foundation to the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center and other partners in the US. DryadUK was a Jisc-funded project run from the British Library and the University of Oxford, in partnership with NESCent, the Digital Curation Centre, and Charles Beagrie Ltd. The project led to a UK mirror of the Dryad repository based at the British Library. The project also improved the tools available for the publication and citation of data, expanded the disciplinary range of participating journals, and further developed the business framework for an international organization dedicated to long-term data preservation. In 2019 Dryad announced a partnership with fellow data-repository Zenodo to co-develop new solutions focused on supporting researcher and publisher workflows as well as best practices in software and data curation. Dryad is a member of the Data Observation Network for Earth (DataONE). Software Dryad was originally built upon the open source DSpace repository software, developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Hewlett-Packard. In 2019, Dryad migrated to an open-source, Ruby-on-Rails data publication platform called Stash.

(Downloadable at www.umich.edu/~cses/) Making democracy work requires a deeper understanding than we have hitherto been able to gain, of how various kinds of democratic institutions operate and how citizens respond to them. In any study of a single country it is difficult to ascertain this, since the institutions are invariant for all citizens one can study. The CSES is a large cross-national survey involving approximately 50 countries in which an international team has conducted a common survey over the last five years. The survey is designed to allow analysis of the impact of political institutions on citizens‚Äô political engagement and political choices, with the data made available immediately on our website to all scholars. I was chair of the project until the fall of 2003, and until 2006 was the PI for the project. To date at least 120 books, chapters, articles, and Ph.D. theses have been written using these data.

A 1988 study of Williamson County historic resources lists two buildings, each named John Winstead House, that are designated as county historic resources WM-107 and WM-108. The house designated WM-108 comprises two log structures. The first was built as a single log pen home around 1800 by John Winstead, Sr., who was one of the first white settlers in the Williamson County area, having arrived in 1799. Around 1820, by which time Winstead had extensive land holdings and owned 10 slaves, he built a second single pen log cabin, oriented diagonally to the first cabin. Winstead, Sr., died in 1822, and his family continued to live on the property. Around 1870 the two cabins were connected by a framed-in structure. Similar construction is found in the Lamb-Stephens House and the Abram Glenn House. The house designated WM-107, now known as Pleasant Hill Mansion, was built near the cabins by John M. Winstead, Jr., who by then owned about of farmland. It is a two-story brick central passage I-frame home that was started in 1855 and took three years to complete. It has a central-bay entrance with Greek Revival detailing, including a two-story portico with square columns topped by capitals with Doric motifs. John Winstead, Jr., lived in this home until his death in 1896, after which ownership of the home passed to a related family named Edmondson. The house is now used as the clubhouse of the Governors Club golf course. It is similar in design to the James J.

Anderson and J.W. Joseph). National Park Service, Interagency Archeological Services-Atlanta, Russell Papers. p. 3. The work in the reservoir documented human occupation from the Paleoindian period all the way through to Historic Period. Site The projected area encompassed a total of 52,000 acres, much of which witnessed was surveyed by archaeologist in the late 1960s and 1970s. About half of that the project area 26,650 acres, was located in the floodpool and the remainder was in the adjoining public use lands and was less intensively examined. The reservoir was the last undammed section of the Savannah above the fall line, and was flooded between 1983 and 1984. The construction of the reservoir lead to many historic investigations under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. A synthesis of the archaeological investigations was produced in 1988 by David G. Anderson and J. W. Joseph.

The circumstances surrounding his death remain disputed. Personal Brown was born in East London on 18 June 1971, the third of four children to Doris and Vic Brown. He went to Godwin Junior School in Forest Gate, then Rokeby Secondary School. Later, when the family moved to Devon, he went to Kingsteignton Secondary School. He resided in Ilford, Essex at the time of his death. Incident at Burj al Arab hotel In April 2011, Brown took a last minute vacation to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, where he stayed at the Burj Al Arab luxury hotel. According to the hotel staff, a Nepalese housekeeper entered his room unannounced and with no form of uniform or identification. In her statement to police she said she thought the room was empty and needed cleaning. The staff explained that after verbally abusing the maid, an agitated Brown attempted to throw the housekeeper from the internal balcony. Another guest at the hotel reported that Brown shouted for staff to call the police as he had caught her stealing. Hotel security and staff intervened, and they subsequently called an ambulance and then later the police, noting that the Nepalese maid required minor medical attention for her injuries. CCTV footage of the incident at the Burj al Arab had been requested, but none has been forthcoming to date. Resisting arrest According to Essam Al Humaidan, the Dubai Public Prosecutor, the group of hotel employees that intervened to prevent Brown from throwing the Nepalese maid off the balcony met \\"violent resistance\\" as they attempted to contain him. According to Lieutenant General Dahi Khalfan Tamim, then the Dubai Chief of Police, Brown resisted arrest, banging his head against a wall and trying to throw himself from the hotel's balcony. Police officers also testified that Brown continued to beat on the metal mesh barrier in the patrol car while he was being driven to the police station. Despite repeated claims of Brown's 'violence' nobody received or reported any injuries or other damage. The statement of the booking officer at Bur Dubai Police Station described Brown as 'calm and in good health'. Criminal charges and bail denial Brown was charged with using abusive language and intimidating behaviour and was denied bail. Assault by fellow inmates Shortly after his arrest, Brown was placed in a cell with other European prisoners. He got along well with his cellmates and four were British. He was moved to solitary confinement after returning from the prosecutor's office with injuries so severe an ambulance was called. Lieutenant General Tamim initially alleged that Brown's injuries were the result of an altercation with other inmates and said in a statement to the press that he would make surveillance camera tapes of the incident available as proof that Brown's behaviour warranted such action. This CCTV footage was requested on numerous occasions by both the Foreign Office in Britain and by the UK coroner but was never released. In a later statement Tamim retracted what he had previously stated and reported that Brown had caused all his injuries to himself by 'throwing himself to the ground'. Health issues in prison A European prisoner who shared a cell with Brown described Brown's condition as \\"terrible\\", but clarified he did not see him being beaten. The prisoner explained, \\"I saw him bleeding. He had bruises on his face, shoulder and arms when he asked me for help....he kept saying: ‚ÄòPlease help me, please help me'.\\" The European prisoner noted that \\"Brown was half naked with both his hands and legs in cuffs. He wore nothing on top ‚Ä¶ and no shoes‚Ä¶ his pants were hanging well below the waist.\\" The prisoner noted that Brown was not eating, and asked the police to help him. Dubai police noted that Brown had been vomiting the day before his death but added that Brown neither complained about nor sought medical help. Death The Foreign Office confirmed that Brown died in custody six days after his arrest, on 12 April 2011. Allegations of police abuse The allegations that Brown was beaten by police originated from four British citizens, who were being held at the same police station on charges unrelated to those of Brown. One of the British inmates used his cellular phone to contact the sister-in-law of Brown, Su Brown, after he found her phone number as the next of kin contact in Brown's passport, which had been left in his cell. Media The arrest and subsequent death of the 39-year-old Brown in 2011 caused an international uproar as many publications reported the events surrounding the incident. Many British publications even downplayed the fact that the maid had entered his room unannounced, not in uniform and, as Lee's police statement said he found her going through his bags, in what could only be an attempt to steal, and that he was found to have no alcohol in his system. Both these facts were conveniently mis-reported in the heavily controlled UAE press. On 14 April 2011, only two days after Brown's death, and before any forensic examinations had been concluded, the British tabloid the Daily Mail, ran a headline that read, \\"Briton 'beaten to death' in a Dubai police cell after being arrested for swearing,\\" which reclassified Brown's charge of \\"using abusive language\\" as simple \\"swearing,\\" and altogether neglected to note the additional charges of intimidating behaviour against the Nepalese maid. Likewise, the United Kingdom's newspaper of record, The Daily Telegraph, ran a headline that read, \\"British inquiry launched after tourist beaten to death\\". Following a story that ran two days earlier in the Gulf News about a witness who actually met with Lee Brown's family, the Daily Mail ran a story on 23 April 2011 about a witness, an alleged cellmate of Lee Brown, The Gulf News reported that Brown only kept repeating, \\"Please help me, please help me.\\" The Daily Mail reported that the witness stated that Brown begged him, \\"Please, please help me. Call my embassy, call my family . . . They beat me badly. Please help me otherwise I will die.\\" Yet another British newspaper, The Independent, ran a story in 2013, noting that a consultant pathologist, Dr Benjamin Swift, privately hired by Brown's family, had concluded that the irrefutable finding that Brown was under the influence of drugs at the time of the incident was irrelevant and would not have contributed to a death by asphyxiation on his own vomit. The article asserted that the finding \\"lends credibility to mounting claims about brutality towards prisoners in the emirate.\\" However, the article notably failed to mention that Dr. Swift did not rule out the possibility that Brown nonetheless sustained life-threatening injuries due to being under the influence of the drugs, and even more pointedly, that Dr. Swift explicitly ruled out violent trauma as a possible cause of death. Forensic conclusions A preliminary post mortem report, based on an examination performed one week after Brown's death, stated \\"the death... was caused by suffocation as result of outflow of vomiting liquids into his respiratory tract,\\" and noted that hashish was found in Brown's system through analysis of his blood and urine. The report of the Dubai authorities noted that Brown suffered irregular bruising on the left side of the forehead, as well as bruising on the nose and on the inner arm. An examination of Brown's body by British officials one week later found no evidence that Brown had vomit in his airways. Another post-mortem examination was carried out ahead of the British inquest into his death by consultant pathologist, Dr Benjamin Swift in 2012, at the behest of Brown's family. Dr. Swift concluded that the finding about cannabis was \\"not relevant\\" ‚Äì adding that the drug had not \\"caused or contributed to his death\\". However, Dr. Swift also discounted violent trauma as a possible cause of death, describing the bruising as \\"light\\". An official inquest was conducted at Walthamstow Coroner's Court in East London, and this proceeding was attended by Brown's mother, Doris Shafi, his brother, Steven, and his sister-in-law Su Brown. Unusually, no witnesses were called and no other evidence other than the post mortem reports was permitted. No CCTV footage was released by the Dubai authorities, despite references to this footage in UAE press by the Chief of Police and others. The coroner, Chinyere Inyama, rejected the efforts of barrister John Lofthouse, to draw attention away from the evidence by citing the conflicts between the forensic findings of Emirati and British officials, reminding him that his submissions bore no relevance to the inquest's role, which was limited to a determination of the cause of death. As such, the British coroner returned an open verdict, indicating that there was insufficient evidence to prove either an unlawful nor a natural cause of death, which effectively served to leave doubts about the circumstances of Lee Brown's death.

He received his first newspaper job in 1970, having previously played lacrosse, and in 1974 began working for the Canadian Press. Stevens has been honoured by the Hockey Hall of Fame, National Lacrosse League Hall of Fame, and St. Catharines Sports Hall of Fame. Early life and lacrosse career Stevens was raised in Port Dalhousie, Ontario, and began playing lacrosse at the age of five. At 16, his midget team won the Ontario championship, though Stevens, a center, missed the deciding game of the finals due to injury. He then played three seasons for the St. Catharines Lakesides junior team, and was named an All-Star by the Ontario Lacrosse Association once. Stevens joined the professional St. Catharines Golden Hawks in 1969; National Hockey League (NHL) goaltender Doug Favell was one of his teammates. Writing career He attended Ryerson University briefly before backpacking through Europe. He ended up at Niagara College, leaving early after being hired as a sports reporter by the Peterborough Examiner in 1970. At the age of 23, Stevens ended his lacrosse career due to a lack of time caused by his job at the Examiner. Stevens travelled for the first time as a reporter in 1971, when he provided coverage of the Minto Cup junior lacrosse event in British Columbia. Following two years with the Examiner, he was fired for being critical of the sports editor to the managing editor. A few months later, he began working for the Sudbury Star, where he stayed for two years. In 1974, Stevens was hired by the Canadian Press. having gained its notice for writing about an inquiry. Stevens spent his early years at the agency covering news, and in 1979 was moved to sportswriting. He covered ice hockey starting in the 1980s, providing coverage of the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in 1982. After reporting on the 1986 and 1989 championship series, he covered the event annually starting in 1991. By 2008, Stevens had written on 20 Finals series. That year, Professional Hockey Writers' Association president Kevin Allen said of Stevens that \\"he might have been the most widely read hockey writer in Canada for the past 30 years.\\" Stevens also served as a beat reporter on the Toronto Maple Leafs. In addition to the NHL, Stevens reported on numerous international tournaments, including the World Cup of Hockey twice, the Canada Cup four times, and the Ice Hockey World Championships four times. He covered the 1999 IIHF Women's World Championship, the 2001 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, and the Memorial Cup on multiple occasions. In 1998, the National Lacrosse League added a Canadian team, the Ontario Raiders. At the time, the Canadian Press did not cover the sport. Stevens recommended to the agency's sports editor that the league be reported on, and he was made the first Canadian Press lacrosse writer. He covered the Raiders and their successors, the Toronto Rock. Stevens provided coverage of other sports as well; among them were the Olympic Games (which he covered eight times) and figure skating (22 world championships). On March 1, 2008, he retired from full-time work at the Canadian Press. However, he remained an active freelance writer and reporter for the Rock's games. Stevens served as a media contact for Canada's national men's lacrosse team during the 2010 World Lacrosse Championship in Manchester, England, and covered the 2011 FIL World Indoor Lacrosse Championship in Prague and the 2015 event in Syracuse, New York. He is a book author and maintains an interest in music. Honours Multiple sports halls of fame have given Stevens honours for his work. In 2008, the National Lacrosse League Hall of Fame recognized him. That same year, the Hockey Hall of Fame presented Stevens with the Elmer Ferguson Memorial Award, presented annually to a sportswriter chosen by the Professional Hockey Writers' Association. Canadian and American writers had given him a nomination before he was selected. In addition, the St. Catharines Sports Hall of Fame inducted Stevens, also in 2008. He joined two members of his family in that hall of fame; Stevens' uncle, Ken Croft, was also honoured in 2008, and his father, John, was a previous inductee.

The Library Journal praised the book, describing it as \\"an emotionally solid tale,\\" its \\"songlike prose a match for its ethereal characters and its allegorical message of inner truth.\\" The Midwest Book Review called it \\"an evocative and emotionally moving tale.\\" The MoonQuest has won several national and regional awards, including the 2008 New Mexico Book Award as best fantasy/science fiction book of the year in the U.S. Southwest and the 2008 Independent Publishers Award Gold Medal for best visionary fiction, a national award. The book is now being adapted as a feature film by Anvil Springs Entertainment, based on Gerson's screenplay. The two other books in The Q'ntana Trilogy are The StarQuest (2013) and The SunQuest (2013).

It was the first album since the band's third album, Be Forewarned, to feature guitarist Victor Griffin. This album had been in the works for many years under the tentative title Last Rites of the Setting Sun. As indicated in the Last Days Here film, the original plan was to use remaining members Greg Mayne and Geof O'Keefe along with new musicians to round out the lineup for a release on Housecore Records, but things ultimately fell through. Frontman Bobby Liebling announced different songs on Myspace circa 2008 as the album progressed to fruition (\\"Everything's Turning to Night\\", \\"Horseman\\" and \\"Walk in the Blue Light\\" did make it to the album from the original intended track listing). The original intention for the album was to feature a lineup of Leibling, Russ Strahan, Mark Ammen and Gary Isom, but that lineup almost entirely changed as 2010 progressed, before recording sessions could be arranged. \\"South of the Swamp\\" and \\"I'm Takin' No More\\" were written and intended for the album, but ultimately were not included. Hank Williams III was also rumored to appear on the album at one point. \\"Into the Ground\\" and \\"Nothing Left\\" originated from rehearsal tracks from the first Pentagram lineup, played in a faster and groovier tempo. \\"Old Man\\", from those same sessions, was originally intended for the album but ultimately not chosen.

It is an ecological centre, educational centre and visitor attraction consisting of three glasshouses, operated and run by the Trust for Sustainable Living. The glasshouses are named Amazonica, Lowlands and Small Islands respectively. The Living Rainforest has been accredited by the Council for Learning Outside of the Classroom and awarded the LOtC Quality Badge. Each year around 25,000 children visit the Living Rainforest as part of their school's curriculum. History The site was once an orchid nursery called Wyld Court Orchids who were well known for their collection of rare and beautiful natural orchid species, especially Cymbidiums and Lycastes. Wyld Court Orchids received considerable recognition from the R.H.S. including a distinction of Grand Champion Hybrid and Best in Show for a home-raised seedling at the British Orchid Council Congress Show. The privately owned ‚ÄòWyld Court Rainforest‚Äô was created in 1991 by philanthropist Keith Bromley (former chairman of the shoe retailer Russell and Bromley) and horticulturalist Barry Findon. Keith Bromley said he was inspired to create Wyld Court Rainforest after sailing in the Orinoco delta in Venezuela in the 1980s. It first opened to the public in April 1993 as a rainforest visitor centre. They donated the facility to the World Land Trust in 1996. On 30 June 2000, ownership of Wyld Court Rainforest Ltd transferred from the World Land Trust to a new company \\"The Living Rainforest\\", and has been operated by Karl Hansen as an independent educational charity since July 2000. The centre is home to over 700 plants and animals including rare and endangered species of global conservation value. Attractions Lowlands PathwayThe visitor attraction consists of three glass houses that adjoin each other; the flora and fauna in each glass house are representative of different layers or areas of tropical rainforests. The rainforest layers represented in the Amazonica and Lowlands glasshouses include the canopy, understory and forest floor layers. The Small Islands glasshouse exhibits shows life at the edge of an island rainforest, the exhibits in this glasshouse are being developed to highlight the issues and concerns faced by Small Island Developing States (SIDS) throughout the world. The Human Impact Building opened in 2006 incorporating sustainable materials, Low Embodied Energy, passive/natural ventilation, passive solar gain and a small photovoltaic solar array.

History  Woodblock print of the Shikemichi, depicting the Sengen shrine at the lower part, and the Goj≈ç bridge over the Hori river in the upper part. (Depiction from the Owari meisho zue, 19th century) The district was founded for merchants at the time when Nagoya Castle was constructed as the seat of the Owari lords in 1610 CE (Keich≈ç 15), following the move from the town of Kiyosu. The move from Kiyosu to Nagoya was called \\"Kiyosu goshi\\". The merchants who lived and worked here in their machiya houses traded in rice, miso, sake, salt, charcoal and wood. The Hori River was used as a transportation canal and commerce began to flourish. A large fire in 1700, called Genroku-no-Taika, destroyed a large number of merchant houses and 15 temples and shrines in Nagoya. As a result, Tokugawa Yoshimichi, the 4th lord of Owari, decided to widen the back street that runs parallel to the Hori Canal. The measurements are four ken (shike), which is around 7 metres. The warehouses were constructed with plaster walls on the east side as a protection against future fires. It took around 40 years to complete the whole area. Most houses that are standing date to 1740. The city designated the townscape as a historic conservation district on June 10, 1986. Access by public transport is Marunouchi Station on the Tsurumai Line or Kokusai Center Station on the Sakuradori Line. Bordering directly south of the street is the Funairi-ch≈ç neighbourhood.  Yanegami  Yanegamisama (Â±ãÊ†πÁ•û„Åï„Åæ) rooftop shrine on one of the houses An interesting feature on a warehouse is the rooftop shrine, called Yanegami (Â±ãÊ†πÁ•û). This rooftop deity honours Tsushima, Akiba and Atsuta Shrines. A small altar erected on the roof is a Nagoya custom. It is a means to ward off disease and disasters, and reflects the great devotion of ordinary people.  Goj≈ç Bridge  The Goj≈ç bridge (‰∫îÊù°Ê©ã) over the Hori River is located at the northern end of the street. The name is thought to date back to time of the migration of the seat of government from Kiyosu to Nagoya in 1610 CE. The original bridge was said to have spanned the Goj≈ç River in front of the Kiyosu Castle. The wooden bridge was replaced in 1938 with a concrete one. The inscription on the ornamental metal knobs are inscribed with \\"Goj≈ç Bridge, Keicho 7, Year of the Tiger, June, Lucky Day.\\"  Fuji Sengen Shrine  Located at the southern end of the street is the Shinto Fuji Sengen Shrine.

The species lives in caves in northern New Caledonia, and forms colonies of up to 300.  Habitat  The New Caledonia blossom bat is a cave roosting species that is endemic to New Caledonia and is found in few caves located in Northern Grande Terre. It has on occasion been found in hollow trees, which can provide temporary roosts for the bats but are inadequate to provide for the needs of a large nursing colony. This species is presumed to forage in the tropical moist forest.  Diet  The New Caledonia Blossom Bat is a nectar-feeding bat that forages for food in montane ecosystems rather than dry forest. It has been observed feeding on coconut flowers near human habitations.  Conservation  The species is classified as endangered by the IUCN. Threats include disturbance at roosting caves and, to a small degree, hunting. Hunting is regulated under wildlife laws.

This type of multi-mode resource constrained project scheduling problem (MRCPSP) seeks to create the shortest logical project schedule, by efficiently using project resources, adding the lowest number of additional resources as possible to achieve the minimum makespan.1 The term commonly appears in the context of scheduling. There is a complex project that is composed of several sub-tasks. We would like to assign tasks to workers, such that the project finishes in the shortest possible time. As an example, suppose the \\"project\\" is to feed the goats. There are three goats to feed, one child can only feed one goat at a time, and there are two children that can feed them: Shmuel feeds each goat in 10 minutes and Shifra feeds each goat in 12 minutes. Several schedules are possible: # If we let Shmuel feed all goats, then the makespan is 30 (3√ó10 for Shmuel, 0 for Shifra); # If we let Shifra feed one goat and Shmuel two goats, then the makespan is 20 (2√ó10 for Shmuel, 12 for Shifra working beside and in parallel to Shmuel); # If we let Shifra feed two goats and Shmuel one goat, then the makespan is 24 (2√ó12 for Shifra, 10 for Samuel working beside and in parallel to Shifra); # If we let Shifra feed all goats, then the makespan is 36 (3√ó12 for Shifra, 0 for Shmuel). So in this case, the second schedule attains the shortest makespan, which is 20.  Types of makespan minimization problems  * Job shop scheduling ‚Äì there are n jobs and m identical stations.

Coffman, Jr. and Ronald Graham, for arranging the elements of a partially ordered set into a sequence of levels. The algorithm chooses an arrangement such that an element that comes after another in the order is assigned to a lower level, and such that each level has a number of elements that does not exceed a fixed width bound . When , it uses the minimum possible number of distinct levels, and in general it uses at most times as many levels as necessary. Problem statement and applications In the version of the job shop scheduling problem solved by the Coffman‚ÄìGraham algorithm, one is given a set of jobs , together with a system of precedence constraints requiring that job be completed before job begins. Each job is assumed to take unit time to complete. The scheduling task is to assign each of these jobs to time slots on a system of identical processors, minimizing the makespan of the assignment (the time from the beginning of the first job until the completion of the final job). Abstractly, the precedence constraints define a partial order on the jobs, so the problem can be rephrased as one of assigning the elements of this partial order to levels (time slots) in such a way that each time slot has at most as many jobs as processors (at most elements per level), respecting the precedence constraints. This application was the original motivation for Coffman and Graham to develop their algorithm... In the layered graph drawing framework outlined by . the input is a directed graph, and a drawing of a graph is constructed in several stages:. Bastert and Matuszewski also include a description of the Coffman‚ÄìGraham algorithm; however, they omit the transitive reduction stage of the algorithm. #A feedback arc set is chosen, and the edges of this set reversed, in order to convert the input into a directed acyclic graph. #The vertices of the graph are given integer -coordinates in such a way that, for each edge, the starting vertex of the edge has a higher coordinate than the ending vertex, with at most vertices sharing the same -coordinate. #Dummy vertices are introduced within each edge so that the subdivided edges all connect pairs of vertices that are in adjacent levels of the drawing. #Within each group of vertices with the same -coordinate, the vertices are permuted in order to minimize the number of crossings in the resulting drawing, and the vertices are assigned -coordinates consistently with this permutation. #The vertices and edges of the graph are drawn with the coordinates assigned to them. In this framework, the -coordinate assignment again involves grouping elements of a partially ordered set (the vertices of the graph, with the reachability ordering on the vertex set) into layers (sets of vertices with the same -coordinate), which is the problem solved by the Coffman‚ÄìGraham algorithm.. Although there exist alternative approaches than the Coffman‚ÄìGraham algorithm to the layering step, these alternatives in general are either not able to incorporate a bound on the maximum width of a level or rely on complex integer programming procedures.. More abstractly, both of these problems can be formalized as a problem in which the input consists of a partially ordered set and an integer . The desired output is an assignment of integer level numbers to the elements of the partially ordered set such that, if is an ordered pair of related elements of the partial order, the number assigned to is smaller than the number assigned to , such that at most elements are assigned the same number as each other, and minimizing the difference between the smallest and the largest assigned numbers. The algorithm The Coffman‚ÄìGraham algorithm performs the following steps. #Represent the partial order by its transitive reduction or covering relation, a directed acyclic graph that has an edge from x to y whenever and there does not exist any third element of the partial order for which . In the graph drawing applications of the Coffman‚ÄìGraham algorithm, the resulting directed acyclic graph may not be the same as the graph being drawn, and in the scheduling applications it may not have an edge for every precedence constraint of the input: in both cases, the transitive reduction removes redundant edges that are not necessary for defining the partial order. #Construct a topological ordering of in which the vertices are ordered lexicographically by the set of positions of their incoming neighbors. To do so, add the vertices one at a time to the ordering, at each step choosing a vertex to add such that the incoming neighbors of are all already part of the partial ordering, and such that the most recently added incoming neighbor of is earlier than the most recently added incoming neighbor of any other vertex that could be added in place of . If two vertices have the same most recently added incoming neighbor, the algorithm breaks the tie in favor of the one whose second most recently added incoming neighbor is earlier, etc. #Assign the vertices of to levels in the reverse of the topological ordering constructed in the previous step. For each vertex , add to a level that is at least one step higher than the highest level of any outgoing neighbor of , that does not already have elements assigned to it, and that is as low as possible subject to these two constraints. Analysis As originally proved, their algorithm computes an optimal assignment for ; that is, for scheduling problems with unit length jobs on two processors, or for layered graph drawing problems with at most two vertices per layer. A closely related algorithm also finds the optimal solution for scheduling of jobs with varying lengths, allowing pre-emption of scheduled jobs, on two processors.. For , the Coffman‚ÄìGraham algorithm uses a number of levels (or computes a schedule with a makespan) that is within a factor of of optimal... For instance, for , this means that it uses at most times as many levels as is optimal. When the partial order of precedence constraints is an interval order, or belongs to several related classes of partial orders, the Coffman‚ÄìGraham algorithm finds a solution with the minimum number of levels regardless of its width bound.. As well as finding schedules with small makespan, the Coffman‚ÄìGraham algorithm (modified from the presentation here so that it topologically orders the reverse graph of and places the vertices as early as possible rather than as late as possible) minimizes the total flow time of two-processor schedules, the sum of the completion times of the individual jobs. A related algorithm can be used to minimize the total flow time for a version of the problem in which preemption of jobs is allowed.. and . state the time complexity of the Coffman‚ÄìGraham algorithm, on an -element partial order, to be . However, this analysis omits the time for constructing the transitive reduction, which is not known to be possible within this bound. shows how to implement the topological ordering stage of the algorithm in linear time, based on the idea of partition refinement.. Sethi also shows how to implement the level assignment stage of the algorithm efficiently by using a disjoint-set data structure. In particular, with a version of this structure published later by , this stage also takes linear time..

A dark bay gelding with a narrow blaze and white hind feet, he developed a reputation for being rather inconsistent, but was one of the most talented hurdlers of his era with a peak rating of 165. Background Hors La Loi III was bred in France by Fran√ßois Cottin. His sire Cyborg, was a thoroughbred who specialised in producing jumpers. Hors La Loi's dam was the non-thoroughbred mare Quintessence (described in some sources as a Selle Fran√ßais), who also produced his full-brother Cyborgo, winner of the 1996 Stayers' Hurdle. The post-nominal \\"III\\" was added to distinguish him from a successful, but less notable thoroughbred racehorse, who had already been registered as \\"Hors La Loi\\". Racing career =1998‚Äì1999: Early career= Hors La Loi III first went into training with Fran√ßois Doumen in France and was ridden in most of his early races by the trainer's son Thierry. He began his career in 1998, running without success in four races on the flat at provincial tracks. Switched to jumping he won on his hurdling debut at Auteuil and was then aimed at races in Britain where he was unbeaten in four starts that season. In December he led early and recorded a sixteen length win in the Grade II Summit Junior Hurdle at Lingfield, and a month later he followed up with another easy win in the Grade II Finesse Juvenile Novices' Hurdle at Cheltenham beating the Tolworth Hurdle winner Behrajan by eight lengths. After these two successes he was moved to the stable of Martin Pipe for the remainder of the season. Unusually for a four-year-old, he was not aimed at the Triumph Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival, instead taking on older Novices in the Supreme Novices' Hurdle. Ridden for the first time by AP McCoy he put in an impressive performance, moving into the lead three flights from home and pulling away to win by seventeen lengths in a time that was 2.2 seconds faster than that recorded by Istabraq in winning the Champion Hurdle one hour later. His performance was described by The Independent's correspondent as one of \\"the most impressive at the Festival\\". A month later, Hors La Loi and McCoy came together again for another easy win in the Anniversary 4-Y-O Novices' Hurdle at Aintree. He had established himself as the leading Novice in the British Isles and a potential challenger to Istabraq for the following season's Championship. =1999‚Äì2001: Championship contender= Returned to Fran√ßois Doumen's stable for the 1999/2000 season, Hors La Loi began with two disappointing efforts at Auteuil, but once again showed improved form when raced in England. In February he won the Grade II Kingwell Hurdle at Wincanton, an important trial for the Champion Hurdle. He had some problems in training, and his connections considered running him in the Stayers' Hurdle before opting for the Championship. At Cheltenham, he went off as at 11-1 and ran up to expectations, but was no match for Istabraq, finishing a four-length second. As a result of this effort he was made odds-on favourite for the Aintree Hurdle, but after leading three hurdles from the finish, he weakened badly and finished a disappointing fourth. The 2000/2001 season proved to be disappointing. Moved to the stable of James Fanshawe, he managed a fair second in the Kingwell Hurdle, but was pulled up in his other three starts, including a substitute Championship race at Sandown (the Cheltenham Festival was cancelled because of the foot-and-mouth outbreak). By the end of the year his official rating had fallen 15 pounds to a mark of 150, well below Championship standard. James Fanshawe was later to say of this season \\"We couldn't get him to do a thing... He was an embarrassment\\". =2001‚Äì2002: Champion hurdler= The early part of the 2001‚Äì2002 season saw signs that Hors la Loi was adjusting to his new environment. He put in place efforts in the Ascot Hurdle, Bula Hurdle and Christmas Hurdle against top class opposition. A three and a half-length victory in the 2002 Kingwell Hurdle saw him back amongst the leading contenders for the championship. Most of the interest, however, was on Istabraq, attempting to win an unprecedented fourth title, and the Christmas Hurdle winner Valiramix. In the Champion Hurdle, Hors La Loi was sent off 10-1 fourth favourite. In an eventful and controversial race, he raced prominently, took the lead two flights from home, and pulled away to win by three lengths under Dean Gallagher, who had \\"never lost faith\\" in the horse. His triumph was somewhat overshadowed by the runs of Istabraq, who was pulled up early in the race, and Valiramix, who suffered a fatal injury when falling on the home turn. =2002‚Äì2006: Later career= Hors la Loi never recaptured his Championship form. In 2002/2003 he ran five times without success, his best effort being a third place in the Kingwell Hurdle. At Cheltenham, his Championship defence ended when his stubborn temperament came to the fore, as he refused to race and was left at the start. His retirement was announced in June 2003, with his owner citing ongoing back problems, but, more than two years later, Hors La Loi re-appeared as a Novice Chaser, now under the care of Paul Nicholls. According to RT√â he produced some \\"magnificent leaps\\" to win at Taunton in December 2005 and recorded placed efforts in good races later in the season, including one back at Wincanton. He was finally retired after running unplaced as a 40-1 outsider in the Jewson Novices' Handicap Chase at the 2006 Cheltenham Festival.

CDM embraces a range of software or cloud computing applications designed to give large organizations rapid and efficient access to customer data. Surveys and data can be centrally located and widely accessible within a company, as opposed to being warehoused in separate departments. CDM encompasses the collection, analysis, organizing, reporting and sharing of customer information throughout an organization. Businesses need a thorough understanding of their customers‚Äô needs if they are to retain and increase their customer base. Efficient CDM solutions provide companies with the ability to deal instantly with customer issues and obtain immediate feedback. As a result, customer retention and customer satisfaction can show marked improvement.

Uses for management  Customer data management * should provide a cost-effective, user-friendly solution for marketing, research, sales, human resources and IT departments * enables companies to create and email online surveys, reports and newsletters * encompasses and simplifies customer relationship management (CRM) and customer feedback management (CFM)  Background  Customer data management, as a term, was coined in the 1990s, pre-dating the alternative term enterprise feedback management (EFM). CDM was introduced as a software solution that would replace earlier disc-based or paper-based surveys and spreadsheet data. Initially, CDM solutions were marketed to businesses as software, specific to one company, and often to one department within that company. This was superseded by application service providers (ASPs) where software was hosted for end user organizations, thus avoiding the necessity for IT professionals to deploy and support software. However, ASPs with their single-tenancy architecture were, in turn, superseded by software as a service (SaaS), engineered for multi-tenancy. By 2007 SaaS applications, giving businesses on-demand access to their customer information, were rapidly gaining popularity compared with ASPs. Cloud computing now includes SaaS and many prominent CDM providers offer cloud-based applications to their clients. In recent years, there has been a push away from the term EFM, with many of those working in this area advocating the slightly updated use of CDM. The return to the term CDM is largely based on the greater need for clarity around the solutions offered by companies, and on the desire to retire terminology veering on techno-jargon that customers may have a hard time understanding.

Early life and career David Syme Russell was born in Glasgow in 1916. His father was a joiner, working on the River Clyde. As a child, Russell showed promise as a footballer and completed trials for the Scottish schoolboys' side and at Queen's Park. Heavily involved with Cambuslang Baptist Church, he later recounted that he knew even as a child that he would end up in ministry. A pupil of Hamilton Academy, Russell then entered Trinity College, Glasgow, before continuing his studies at Regent's Park College, Oxford. Having attended the World Conference of Christian Youth both in 1939 and after the war, learning the realities of Auschwitz had a tremendous effect on him throughout his career. Russell's first charge was as pastor at the Castlegate Church, Berwick, and between 1945 and 1951 he was minister in Acton, London, where in his final year there he conducted the funeral of the Foreign Secretary, Ernest Bevin, preaching to a congregation including the cabinet of the Attlee government. Later career In 1953, Russell was appointed Principal, Rawdon College, the Baptist college at Leeds, England, and was much involved in the merging of Rawdon College with the Northern College, Manchester, in 1964, the merged colleges becoming the Northern Baptist College of which he was Joint Principal. Becoming active in the European Baptist Federation and the Human Rights Programme of the Conference of European Churches, Russell was to advocate human rights in meetings with communist authorities and managed to secure funding for a translation into Russian of William Barclay's New Testament commentaries. He travelled widely in eastern Europe and Africa. Russell was appointed General Secretary of the Baptist Union of Great Britain in 1967, a position he was to hold until his retirement in 1982. Among other appointments, he also served as Moderator of the Free Church Federal Council (1973‚Äì74) and as its president (1983‚Äì84). In 1967 Russell was awarded the degree of Doctor of Letters from the University of Glasgow and in 1982 was invested Commander of the Order of the British Empire. David Russell married Marion Campbell in 1943, the couple having a son and daughter. Retiring in 1982 he moved to Bristol where he died, aged 93, in 2010. Published works Russell was the author of numerous works, writing six of his fourteen published books during his retirement. He also made significant contributions to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica.

It remained in circulation until it became the British shilling as the result of the Union of England and Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707. There were twenty shillings to the pound sterling and twelve pence to the shilling, and thus 240 pence to the pound. This currency was in use until January 1971. Name The word shilling comes from the Old English scilling (meaning to separate ), an accounting term dating back to Anglo-Saxon times, to mean a 20th of a pound, although there was no specific coin of that value. A common misconception is that the word is a Norse loanword into English, however, it can be found in English laws many years before Norse incursions into Britain, for example the Law of √Üthelberht, of Kent.the laws of King Athelbert History =Testoon= Mary & Francis Scottish testoon In the Kingdom of England, during the reign of Henry VII, the forerunner of the shilling, the testoon, was introduced. This coin was produced in extremely small quantities, probably around 1489, and the fact that there are only three known dies for this issue (and three subsequent legend varieties, HENRIC, HENRIC VII and HENRIC SEPTIM) shows clearly that the coins were not made for general circulation. The HENRIC SEPTIM legend is the rarest and a high rarity also being one of the first testoons. They were made during the same period as the trials for the Profile issue of groats and half- groats, so they were probably trial pieces or patterns. In the Kingdom of Scotland, during the reign of Mary, Queen of Scots, the testoon and half testoon were introduced to the Scottish coinage in 1553 and 1555 respectively. The 1553 is a Scottish rarity and Mary was presented with one (this piece was EF which sold for 61 gbp during the 1850s Thornburn). =Henry VIII (1509‚Äì1547)= Henry VIII testoon The testoon was struck in quantity during the last part of the reign of Henry VIII, with The Tower, Southwark, and Bristol mints producing testoons in 1544‚Äì1551. These testoons were made in the very poor base silver in this period, and are known as base testoons. The coins were struck after Henry's death in 1547, at The Tower, Southwark, and at Bristol. Legend BRISTOLLIE and BRISTOLIE on reverse. BRISTOLIE are extremely rare and were struck pre and post death Henry VIII 1547 with WS monogram in legend. [one was recorded pre WW2 at 6.89gms fully round, said to be from BRISTOL used as evidence at the trial of William Sharington] The mint-marks for these testoons are as follows: :TOWER (London) :* two lis OR :* lis OR :* pellet in annulet :Southwark :* S OR :* E :Bristol :* WS (for William Sharington) The coins from Southwark have the reverse legend \\"CIVITAS LONDON\\" (City of London) and the Bristol coins the legend \\"CIVITAS BRISTOLLIE\\" (City of Bristol) or later \\"CIVITAS BRISTOLIE\\" (City of Bristol) The obverse of these coins shows a facing bust of Henry VIII and the reverse side, a crowned rose with [WS] in legend. Very Rare are any BRISTOL testoons which are full, round and not clipped or shaved. =Edward VI (1547‚Äì1553)= Henry VIII's young son Edward VI continued the issues of base testoons. In his reign the testoons were called \\"shillings\\" for the first time, and the coins show the bust of the young boy king. Unlike his father's coins, the shillings of Edward VI cannot be differentiated by their reverse legend. There are six slightly different busts for these issues. Most importantly, these coins are the first English ones to carry the date, which is in Roman numerals. The coins were minted at the Durham House, Tower, Southwark, Canterbury and Bristol mints. The mint-marks for these coins are: :Durham House MDXLVIII (1548) :* BOW :This issue is exceedingly rare and could be a pattern or contemporary forgery. :Durham House MDXLIX (1549) :* BOW :Tower MDXLIX (1549) :* ARROW OR :* GRAPPLE OR :* PHEON OR :* SWAN :Southwark MDXLIX (1549) :* Y OR :* EY :Canterbury MDXLIX (1549) :* ROSE OR :* T :Bristol MDXLIX (1549) :* TC :Tower MDL (1550) :* LION OR :* LIS OR :* PHEON AND :* SWAN OR :* MARLET OR :* CROWNED LEOPARD'S HEAD :Southwark MDL (1550) :* Y OR :* LIS AND Y :Tower MDLI (1551) :* LION AND ROSE OR :* ROSE AND ROSE :Southwark MDLI (1551) :* Y AND LIS :Undated issue (Durham House) :* BOW Fine silver issue  In 1551 the silver standard was restored from about 0.250 silver to the normal 0.925 \\"sterling\\" silver. This issue has a stunning facing bust of the king and is very highly collectible. It was struck in large quantities but is normally found fairly worn and sometimes holed. Mint-marks: :Tower or Southwark. No date (1551) :* Y :Tower. No date (1551-3) :* TUN =Mary (1553‚Äì1558)= No shillings were struck in England until Queen Mary I of England was married in 1554 to Philip of Spain, though Irish shillings with Mary's portrait were struck in 1553 and 1554 before her marriage. After Mary's marriage some shillings were coined. To boost Philip's popularity his bust was placed on these coins, facing Mary's. These coins are fairly rare, but nevertheless do frequently appear on the market. There are two main varieties: Spanish titles (which adds on \\"Prince and Princess of Spain\\") and English titles. Many of these coins were dated using Arabic dates and some coins have a mark of value (I__II) above the royal shield. There is an exceedingly rare variety which has the date under the busts. All the coins were made at the Tower mint. =Elizabeth I (1558‚Äì1603)= One of the first events of Elizabeth I's reign was the counter-marking of the Edward VI shillings to revalue them to their true worth. These coins have the counter-mark of a portcullis or greyhound and are extremely rare. The coins with the portcullis counter-mark were revalued at fourpence halfpenny, and the coins with the greyhound were revalued at twopence farthing. A major recoinage was then embarked upon, with thousands of silver coins being produced. The shilling was no exception with the date being removed from the design (however, mint-marks can be used to reveal the date). No shillings were produced between 1562 and 1582, but the next issue was also very large and a good number have survived for collectors. Mint-marks: :Hammered issue (all coins were produced in the Tower) :* Lis (1559‚Äì1560) :* Cross crosslet (1560‚Äì61) :* Marlet (1560‚Äì61) :* Bell (1582‚Äì83) :* A (1582‚Äì84) :* Escallop (1584‚Äì86) :* Crescent (1587‚Äì89) :* Hand (1590‚Äì92) :* Tun (1592‚Äì95) :* Woolpack (1594‚Äì96) :* Key (1595-98) :* Anchor (1597‚Äì1600) :* 1 (1601) :* 2 (1602) :Milled issue (Tower mint only) :* Star (1560‚Äì1) The milled issue was produced by Eloye Mestrelle using horse power. The issues were a success, especially the sixpences, but he lost his post over various disputes with the mint workers. Although Eloye found it very difficult to make smaller coins the sixpences and shillings were made in fairly large quantities. The shillings still tend to be much rarer than sixpences and are often found weakly struck, gilded, holed, mounted etc. They are still available to collectors, albeit in poor condition. =James I (1603‚Äì1625) = During the reign of James I, coinage continued in much the same way as in Elizabeth's but the coins have a mark of value (XII) in front of the bust. Some shillings were struck with a plume above the shield (Welsh silver). The mint marks for these coins are: :First coinage (reverse legend Exurgat deus dissipentur inimici) :* Lis (1603‚Äì4) :* Thistle (1603‚Äì4) :Second coinage (reverse legend Quae deus coniunxit nemo seperat, square cut beard) :* Lis (1604‚Äì5) :* Rose (1604‚Äì6) :* Escallop (1606‚Äì7) :* Grapes (1607) :* Coronet (1607‚Äì9) :* Key (1609‚Äì10) :* Mullet (1611‚Äì2) :* Tower (1612‚Äì3) :* Trefoil (1613) :* Tun (1613‚Äì5) :* Cinquefoil (1613‚Äì5) :* Closed book (1615‚Äì6) :* Plain cross (1617‚Äì18) :Third coinage (very long curly hair) :* Spur Rowel (1619‚Äì20) :* Rose (1620‚Äì1) :* Thistle (1621‚Äì3) :* Lis (1623‚Äì4) :* Trefoil (1624) :Welsh issues (with plume above shield) :* Thistle (1621‚Äì3) :* Lis (1623‚Äì4) :* Trefoil (1624) =1625 to 1706= Shillings were minted in every subsequent reign as well as during the Commonwealth period.

My especial delight is people's heads. I love to convey personalities, any personalities onto canvas. I regard myself as an expressionist. I paint what I feel strongly about.

As a boy he learned to play the violin and piano, and loved to sing; he also wrote poetry.Burris Devanney,\\"Kenneth Leslie: A Biographical Introduction,\\" Canadian Poetry: Studies / Documents / Reviews No.05 (Fall/Winter 1979), UWO, Web, Apr. 15, 2011 He \\"was a child prodigy, attending Dalhousie University in Halifax at age 14.\\"\\"VisionTV documentary tells the story of unsung Canadian hero Kenneth Leslie, poet and political activist ,\\" VisionTV (press release), June 11, 2008. Web, Apr. 15, 2011. Later he was educated at Colgate Theological Seminary for a year; the University of Nebraska, where he received his Master of Arts degree in 1914; and Harvard, where he studied \\"under the brilliant idealist Josiah Royce\\" but did not receive a doctorate. =First marriage= Leslie was married four times. His first wife, Elizabeth, was the daughter of the wealthy Halifax candy manufacturer, James Moir. The couple led an active social life, travelling widely, acquainted with some of the leading literary and artistic figures of the day. In Halifax they were members of The Song Fishermen, a social and literary set led by their friends, Andrew and Tully Merkel, whose Halifax, Nova Scotia, home was \\"a favourite rendezvous for writers and artists.\\" Leslie became a close friend of Song Fisherman Robert Norwood, \\"a native of New Ross, N.S. who published eight books of poetry and became, as rector of St. Bartholomew‚Äôs Church in New York, one of the most renowned preachers in North America.\\" \\"In about 1928\\" the Leslies \\"went with their children to Paris for a year, ostensibly to enable Leslie to study at the Sorbonne; in actuality they spent most of the year touring [continental Europe].\\" In the late 1920s the Leslies relocated to New York City, where Leslie began losing his wife's money playing the stock market: \\"Estimates of the loss run from $25,000 to $250,000.\\" During those years, the Leslies were active in theatre circles. Leslie studied acting, and his children were cast in a Broadway play. Leslie wrote his own \\"'Broadway' musical, which collapsed in rehearsals, and a few dozen other songs which did not sell in Tin Pan Alley.\\" During the 1930s Leslie hosted a radio program on Newark, New Jersey, station WOR on which he read poetry, sang Gaelic songs, and played the violin. In the 1930s the Leslies' marriage fell apart. As Kenneth Leslie later told it: \\"My wife had the habit of taking all the children away to stay with relatives for months at a time, leaving me alone. I stepped out on her and she divorced me.\\" Beth prevented him from seeing his children again in her lifetime, and even changed the name of his son (from Kenneth Alexander to Alexander Moir). After her death Leslie reconciled with his daughters; but he never saw his son again. =Second marriage= In 1934 Leslie married Marjorie Finlay Hewitt, a divorc√©e, who had \\"become enamoured of him when she attended a poetry reading he was giving in Montclair, N.J.\\" The dozen years of their marriage were the most productive of his life. In 1934 he published Windward Rock, \\"the first of several acclaimed volumes of poetry in 1934.\\" Three more books of poetry Lowlands Low, Such a Din and By Stubborn Stars would follow in the next four years. The last volume, By Stubborn Stars, won Canada's Governor General's Award in 1938. But by then Leslie had other concerns. During the mid-1930s, \\"he had become increasingly disturbed by the growth of fascist and anti- semitic attitudes in the United States throughout the 'thirties and the concomitant influence of isolationist sentiments on American foreign policy.\\" In particular he was concerned about the radio broadcasts of the Roman Catholic priest Charles Coughlin, who was reaching as many as 40 million listeners. He worried about the spread of groups like the German-American Bund, the Protestant War Veterans Association, the Christian Mobilizers, the Christian Front, and William Dudley Pelley's Silver Shirts, all of whom he saw as being inspired by Coughlin's anti-semitism. So \\"during the late 1930s, he chose to take a public stand, launching the Protestant Digest (later The Protestant), a progressive journal of religion and politics.\\" In December 1938, with the \\"support of his second wife, who provided almost all of the initial investment money (approximately $40,000), he created the Protestant Digest, ... which eventually attained a circulation of 50,000 and became a powerful voice in the war against fascism and anti-semitism in the United States.\\" \\"With contributions from the leading public intellectuals of the day, the magazine called for a declaration of war against the Axis powers, and stood firmly against the oppression of Jews.\\" The theologians Paul Tillich and Reinhold Niebuhr became editorial advisers to The Protestant, \\"as did ... Dr. John Mackay, President of Princeton Theological Seminary, James Luther Adams of the Meadville Theological Seminary in Chicago, and Louie D. Newton of Atlanta, Associate Secretary of the Baptist World Alliance. \\"But [Leslie's] leftist politics and pointed criticism of the Catholic Church (which in his view had enabled Europe‚Äôs fascists) earned him enemies as well.\\" \\"By the early 1940s, Leslie's organization [Protestant Associates] had produced numerous offshoots, including a national organization of anti-fascist Protestant clergy.... Leslie himself was in constant demand as a speaker, and earned endorsements from the likes of Eleanor Roosevelt,\\" the First Lady. One initiative of Protestant Associates was \\"the Textbook Commission, with Leslie as 'national' chairman. ... The Commission gave itself the mandate of searching out and eliminating anti-semitic statements in American textbooks.\\" In December 1943 the Commission released a list of 33 books carrying what it called \\"race-hating propaganda.\\" \\"The fact that a large number of these publications were in use in Roman Catholic parochial schools contributed to Leslie‚Äôs undeserved (but growing) reputation as a virulent anti-Catholic.\\" Leslie also came up with the idea of The Challenger, \\"an anti-fascist comic book which appeared sporadically in 1944 and once in 1945, this last time in a 64 page \\"deluxe\\" edition which had a press run of 400,000 and sold at 10 cents. The cover of the 1945 edition shows youths of the white, yellow and black races battling green demons of fear, hate and greed. Gerald Richardson, the editor, made use of nationally known cartoonists in this attempt to counter the mass production of fascist propaganda aimed at the young.\\" By 1945, though, there was little need to worry about 'fascist propaganda'. Fascism was dead; the perceived threat was no longer fascists but Communists, Leslie's progressive allies in the anti-fascist coalition. Just as Leslie criticized the Catholic Church as enablers of fascism, so he was criticized by its supporters as an enabler of Communism. And just as he called the Church anti-semitic, he was called anti-Catholic. Typical of the attacks on him was a \\"widely-distributed Roman Catholic newspaper in 1947 [that] described The Protestant as the 'Red Hope' and accused Leslie of serving faithfully 'the Moscow purpose to wipe out the Catholic Church, as the chief moral obstacle in the path to Soviet World domination.\\" At the same time, by Leslie's account, he was fighting \\"to keep editorial policy out of the hands of certain supporters of the Communist Party on the executive staff\\" of The Protestant. As a result of that struggle, six members of the executive resigned in November 1946, \\"allegedly because of Leslie‚Äôs dictatorial, one-man control of the publication.\\" Suddenly, at that time, \\"Leslie‚Äôs ability to attract financial support, and, indeed, his personal prestige, became severely diminished.\\" To make matters worse, his wife discovered he was \\"having an affair with his private secretary, Cathy, a Polish-American girl some thirty years younger than himself,\\" and filed for divorce. Since Leslie had never taken a proper salary from The Protestant, this left him with no personal income. Next, \\"Leslie attracted the scrutiny of the FBI and Senator Joseph McCarthy's anti-communist crusade. He made Life Magazine's list of the top 50 Communist 'fellow travelers and innocent dupes,' in such illustrious company as Albert Einstein, Norman Mailer, Leonard Bernstein, Arthur Miller and Langston Hughes.\\" In 1949 Leslie \\"left the U.S. and returned to his native Nova Scotia for good.\\" =Third and fourth marriages= Kenneth Leslie arrived back in Canada with a new wife, \\"Cathy, whose parents were peasant class Polish immigrants [and] had no independent source of income. Leslie had to find a job.\\" He drove a taxi and found some work as a substitute teacher. He tried to enter academe: \\"financially down-and-out and reduced to driving a taxi to earn a living, he entered the education faculty of Dalhousie University, only to withdraw after a few weeks, thoroughly disillusioned with the feeble intellectual quality of the program.\\" His new marriage fell apart quickly. \\"Cathy was not happy in Nova Scotia ‚Äî and she had fallen in love with one of Leslie‚Äôs nephews, a man close to her own age. Tearfully, and still with great fondness for her husband, she left him to join the nephew.\\" Kenneth Leslie lived quietly in rural Nova Scotia, working as a lay preacher and substitute teacher. Due to his activist past, plus a 1958 trip he made to the Soviet Union, he was for some time under Royal Canadian Mounted Police surveillance, and an object of \\"parental anxieties about Communists in the classroom\\". The Protestant finally shut down in 1953. But for the next 20 years Leslie continued to publish successor periodicals: One, New Christian, Man, and New Man. In 1960 Leslie heard of the death of an old friend, Judge Totten. He \\"drove alone to California to console ‚Äî and to marry ‚Äî the judge‚Äôs widow, Nora Steenerson Totten. The couple were devoted to each other and collaborated on the publication of New Man until 1972, when ill-health forced them both to enter a Halifax nursing home. Leslie died there in relative obscurity on October 6, 1974. Only about a dozen friends and relatives attended the funeral. Nora died the following spring.\\" Poetry Leslie wrote poetry as a boy; his first poem, he later recalled, was about Bonnie Prince Charlie. In the 1920s in Nova Scotia he and his first wife were members of The Song Fishermen, a literary and society group that included Charles G. D. Roberts and Bliss Carman. Leslie began contributing poetry to the Song Fishermen broadsheets, and soon in other small Halifax literary publications too. By the end of the decade he had published poems in Literary Digest and Scribner's. His first collection, Windward I Rock, \\"was published by Macmillan in New York in 1934 and received favourable critical attention on both sides of the Atlantic. The Times Literary Supplement praised him for having 'broken through the crust of the conventional to something that is burningly alive.'\\" His next two books, Lowlands Low (1935) and Such a Din! (1936), were published in Halifax and received little critical notice. \\"But in 1938 he won considerable acclaim and the Governor-General‚Äôs award with the publication in Toronto of By Stubborn Stars and Other Poems. Roberts, by then the grand old man of Canadian letters, ranked Leslie at this time a better poet than E.J. Pratt, and Pratt himself wrote to Leslie.... 'I gave an address the other day on the newer poets and quoted at length from your book.'\\" After 1938 Leslie published very little outside his own periodicals. But he continued to write poetry and publish poetry through the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. \\"Some of his best poems of these years are highly political: 'Moscow‚Äôs Measure,' 'Remember Lumumba!' and 'Praise the Viet Cong.' They are as stirring and passionately rhetorical as anything he ever wrote.\\" Ladysmith Press published The Collected Poems of Kenneth Leslie in 1971. However, because editor Sean Haldane omitted a number of poems 'because they were light verse, or political verse, which fulfilled a temporal need,' Leslie published his own collected edition, O‚ÄôMalley to the Reds and Other Poems, in 1972. Jennifer Fandel wrote in ForeWord Review: Recognition Leslie won the 1938 Governor General's Award for his book, By Stubborn Stars. The lyrics to Leslie's song \\"Cape Breton Lullaby\\" (set to a different, traditional melody) have been recorded by several Canadian Celtic artists, including Catherine Mackinnon, Ryan's Fancy,\\"Cape Breton Lullaby (Ryan's Fancy),\\" #01062, WTV-Zone.com, Web, Apr. 15, 2011. and The Cottars.\\"The Cottars ‚Äì Cape Breton Lullaby (3:35),\\" Last.fm, Web, Apr. 15, 2011 Leslie was the subject of a 2008 VisionTV documentary, God‚Äôs Red Poet: The Life of Kenneth Leslie.

Villa Seghetti Panichi There was originally a castle on the site of the villa, probably from the late 10th century, which was fortified in 1311 when it was known as ‚ÄòCastel della Lama‚Äô, now the name of the adjoining village Castel di Lama. The castle was then a Guelph outpost in the war against the Ghibellines.Historiae Asculanae IV by Sebastiano Andreantonelli, Padua 1673 The castle was a square building with a round watch tower on one corner, part of which is still visible in the current villa. In the late 17th century war declined in the region and from 1680 to 1750 the fort was transformed into a grand residence with an austere counter- reformation exterior. Gardens (Parco Storico Seghetti Panichi) In 1875, the owner of the villa commissioned Ludwig Winter, the German botanist and landscape architect who had just finished working on the Giardini Botanici Hanbury, to create a garden around the imposing villa. Winter found that the Tronto valley had a gentle microclimate similar to the Ligurian gulf and introduced his signature exotic palm trees that he had pioneered in Liguria. He complemented the soft hillside and views of the Adriatic Sea and Sibillini Mountains with a lake and winding gardens, now listed in the Grandi Giardini Italiani. As well as the palms, these include a miniature oriental landscape featuring Styphnolobium japonicum \\"Pendulum\\" and \\"Prunus\\", and a large Cycas revoluta.

Inconspicuous unless in flower, it grows from high. The stems are ridged and usually leafless, and arise from the plant's woody base. The rarely seen leaves are at the base of the shoot. They are thick in texture, and measure 8 mm long by 2 mm wide. This plant first appeared in scientific literature in Plantae Preissianae in 1846, authored by the German botanist Joachim Steetz. Endemic to New South Wales, Comesperma sphaerocarpum is found along the tablelands and coast, from Warialda in the north to Nowra. In the Sydney region it is found in the Munmorah State Conservation Area, Royal, Lane Cove and Brisbane Water National Parks and other bushland reserves. The habitat is sandy soils in heathland or low eucalyptus country, sometimes in high rainfall areas. The specific epithet sphaerocarpum is from the Ancient Greek, referring to the ball-shaped fruit. The attractive violet or blue flowers form from October to May. The width of the flower is around . The fruit is somewhat broadly triangular or round, and tapers to the stem, although not as prominently tapered as are other plants in this genus.Les Robinson - Field Guide to the Native Plants of Sydney, page 199 The fruit is 4 mm long.

The Moderne style building was constructed in part with Works Progress Administration funds and is the third building to serve as the Burnet County Courthouse. Lewis Milton Wirtz of Columbus designed the structure. It was completed August 1, 1937 at a cost of approximately $135,000. The first Burnet County Courthouse was a one-story frame building containing a courtroom, a jail and offices. In 1874, the courthouse, located on the southwestern corner of the present courthouse square, burned down. The second courthouse was constructed of limestone in 1875 and also housed a jail. When the 1875 courthouse fell into disrepair, the county decided to build a new courthouse. The need for a new courthouse had long been evident in Burnett County, with various county offices having to be housed outside the courthouse due to space constraints. The need for a new courthouse came to the forefront in 1934. In June of that year, a report of the Burnet County Grand Jury found that \\"the Tax Assessor and the Tax Collector are without a vault to protect the records of their offices,\\" and noted that a fire could destroy valuable records. The grand jury recommended, since the two offices were set to be combined in to one in 1935, moving a men's restroom in the courthouse to accommodate the need for larger office space. In December of that year, Burnet Mayor W.C. Galloway proposed using government match-funding programs to construct a new courthouse. The last week of November, 1935, the Works Progress Administration announced that $74,000 had been allocated for the construction of a new courthouse and jail repairs in Burnett County. Because the courthouse was proposed as a Works Project Administration project, the local government of Burnett County was required to bear a portion of the costs. The county was required to come up with $74,000 to match with federal funds of $61,000. In order to raise these funds, the Burnett County Commissioners Court voted to hold an election to allow voters to decide if the county should sell bonds to come up with its portion of the funds necessary for the courthouse project. It was projected that the additional five-cent maintenance tax required to pay off the bonds would cost a property owner with $1,000 worth of property an additional fifty cents per year in taxes. The Burnett Bulletin editorialized in favor of the bonds. The bond election for voters to approve $74,000 in bonds to be matched with federal funding of $61,000 for a total of $135,000 to build the new courthouse was conducted December 21, 1935. The bond election passed by 81 votes, 401-220. 721 votes were cast. The box for the city of Burnett voted in favor of the bonds 236-30. County offices moved out of the old courthouse, and crews began tearing it down during the week of February 13, 1936. County Judge O.B. Zimmerman received the first installment check of $33,750 from the federal government for the courthouse project the week of April 2, 1936. Southern Office Furniture Company was awarded an $8,49.53 bid to outfit the courthouse with furniture and equipment in early February, 1937. The current Burnet County Courthouse is two-story and finished in polished pink granite veneer with scenes of Burnet County history and commerce etched in panels. The pink granite is the same material that was used on the Texas State Capitol. An addition designed by Willis Environmental Engineering of Marble Falls was constructed on the rear of the courthouse in 1974. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 15, 2000.

As a child, she excelled in horseback riding, beauty pageants and was an honors student. Hughes earned her Bachelor's degree from the University of Southern Mississippi in the early 2000s. She next earned her Master of Education degree from Belhaven College in Jackson, Mississippi. Hughes then began taking graduate coursework in education at Delta State University. At the time of her arrest, she was pursuing a doctorate in education. In 2004, she gave birth to a son. Hughes started out her teaching career at an elementary school but then took a job as a 7th grade language arts teacher at Chastain Middle School in Jackson, Mississippi. It was there where she met fellow schoolteacher and basketball coach Keyon Pittman, a graduate of Alcorn State University. The two began having an intimate relationship. At the same time, Pittman had a live-in fiancee, Avis Banks, who was pregnant. Murder and Investigation On the night of November 29, 2006, Avis Banks, a daycare worker, was found shot and stabbed to death in the garage of her Ridgeland, Mississippi home. Her body was discovered by her fiance Keyon Pittman, and it appeared as if the perpetrator had kicked in their back door. After discovering the body, Pittman called his co-worker Carla Hughes. Hughes was later interrogated by police, where she initially denied her sexual relationship with Pittman and later denied having access to a gun. However, Hughes's cousin indicated to police, via an attorney, that he had lent a loaded .38 caliber 5-shot revolver to Hughes shortly before the murder, and that she had returned the gun empty. Hughes was originally charged with accessory to murder after the fact, but on December 8, 2006, the charges were upgraded to two counts of capital murder. Trial Carla Hughes' trial began in October 2009. Prosecutors believed that Hughes killed Avis Banks so she could be with Pittman. Pittman testified for the prosecution on October 6, 2009, stating to jurors how he found Avis Banks' body in their garage and talked about his relationship with Hughes. In addition to Pittman's testimony, prosecutors were able to prove that Hughes' cousin's gun was the murder weapon and that Hughes shoes were used to kick in the door. Cell phone records also showed that Hughes was near Banks and Pittman's home at the time of the murder. Hughes' attorneys called Pittman a \\"bona fide womanizer\\" who did not want to be married with a child. They claimed that he had worn Hughes' shoes during the murder, and he discounted testimony about how Hughes' cellphone records placed her at the crime scene, claiming that she had a friend in the area. On October 12, 2009, Hughes decided not to testify in her own defense. The case was then handed over to the jury. Verdict After eight hours of deliberation, Hughes's jury announced they had reached a verdict on October 13, 2009. Hughes was found guilty on both counts of capital murder. Although Hughes could have faced the death penalty, she was instead sentenced to serve two consecutive life sentences without parole. Aftermath On August 30, 2010, a Madison County judge denied Carla Hughes' request for a new trial. On June 21, 2012, the Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the Madison County Circuit Court. Six issues were raised on appeal, all of which were found to be without error.  Media  The Carla Hughes case and the murder of Avis Banks have been explored and re-enacted on several true-crime television shows that include Criminals at Work, Dateline NBC, Snapped, Forensic Files, Stolen Voices, Buried Secrets, Scorned: Love Kills, Fatal Attraction, A Wedding and a Murder, and Redrum (played by Melissa Joyner).

Life and work Her family's home was in Suining in Sichuan, but she often lived with her father, who was a high-ranking official of the Ming court. She was known to be intelligent and she got a good education by any standards. After returning to Sichuan when she was 21, she married Yang Shen, the son of Grand Secretary Yang Tinghe. Both spouses had great interest in literary activities.Chang, Saussy and Kwong, pp. 172‚Äì173. Both Yang Shen and his father opposed the Jiajing Emperor and Yang Shen was beaten and then banished to Yunnan. She then went to the Yang's family's house in Chengdu, where she took care of financial matters as well as the education and upbringing of the children and grandchildren of the Yang family. They communicated with letters and sent each other poems, which Yang Shen showed to others and thereby became famous. The two were briefly reunited in 1526 when Yang Shen was allowed to return to visit his dying father. Once his trip was finished, Huang E traveled with Yang Shen to Yunnan to help him and share his hardships. They returned to Sichuan in 1529 to attend Yang Tinghe‚Äôs funeral. Afterwards, Huang E stayed to take care of the house as Yang Shen returned to Yunnan.Peterson, He Hong, Wang, Han, Zhang, p. 300. In 1559, tragedy fell as Yang Shen died at the age of 71 at the barracks where he had been exiled. Huang E traveled to Huzhou, Yunnan to take her husband‚Äôs remains to their family tomb in Xingdu. It was said that the tragedy was too great for Huang E and she became ill as a result. She died in 1569. Many poems have been written in her name in which she admonishes Yang Shen for his irresponsible behavior in Yunnan, though it is possible that he wrote some of those as a parody on himself.Chang, Saussy and Kwong, p. 174. Several of Huang E‚Äôs works were collected into Selected Poems of the Wife of Zhangyuan Yang, Afterthought of Madame Yang‚Äôs Silk Songs and Ballads, Yuefu of Madam Huang, Letters Between Husband and Wife, and Sanqu of Yang Shen and His Wife. In 1983 AD, there was a Huang E Memorial Hall built at Gui Lake in Xingdu where several of her objects were left to be exhibited.Peterson, He Hong, Wang, Han, Zhang, p. 302. Sent to My Husband An example of her poetry used to communicate with Yang Shen is Sent to My Husband:Chang, Saussy and Kwong, p. 175. ‚ÄúWild geese have never flown as far as Hengyang‚Äù; How then will my embroidered words be carried all the way to Yongchang? Like the willow‚Äôs flowers by the end of spring, I am ill-fated indeed; In the mists of that alien land, you feel the pangs of despair. ‚ÄúOh, to go home, to go home,‚Äù you mourn to the year‚Äôs bitter end. ‚ÄúOh, if it would rain, if it would rain,‚Äù I complain to the bright dawn. One hears of vain promises that you could be set free; When will the Golden Cock reach all the way to Yelang?

Both styles date to Late Paleoindian times and share similar lanceolate shapes. Golondrina points (formerly Plainview Golondrina) are lanceolate spear or dart projectile points, of medium size, dated to the transitional Paleo-Indian Period, between 9000‚Äì7000 BP. Golondrina points were attached on split-stem hafts and may have served to bring down medium-sized animals such as deer, as well as functioning as butchering knives. Distribution is widespread throughout most of Texas, and points have also been discovered in Arkansas and Mexico. The concentration of Golondrina specimens is highest across the South Texas Plains, where the point is the most prevalent of Paleo-Indian types and defines a distinctive cultural pattern for the region. The Golondrina point is so named for its flared basal corners (\\"ears\\"), which resemble a swallow's (golondrina in Spanish) split tail. Classification of Golondrina can be difficult because of its similarity to other types, particularly the Plainview point, to which it was originally thought to be related. Classification Classification of the Golondrina point was made by Texas Historical Commission archeologist LeRoy Johnson Jr. in 1964, after the discovery of a collection of unrecognized projectile points at the Devil's Mouth site in the Amistad Reservoir, Texas. Initially believed to be related to the Plainview point classification, the new type was termed \\"Plainview Golondrina\\" by Johnson, who used a genus-species approach for the naming. This classification method sought to describe the relationship between the two types, placing Plainview as the genus, and Golondrina as the species, to highlight key similarities and differences. But by 1977, the genus-species classification approach had been discarded, and the name Golondrina alone was being used to represent the Devil's Mouth specimens. Subsequent research and technological analysis determined this type to be separate and distinct from the Plainsview point, and the name was shortened to simply \\"Golondrina\\" by Thomas C. Kelly in 1982. The type takes its name from a pronounced flaring of the basal corners (stem), which recall the split tail of a swallow (golondrina in Spanish). The Golondrina is considered to be a Plano point. Description The Golondrina point is medium-sized and lanceolate-shaped with a lenticular cross-section that exhibits convex sides. The type displays a distinctive auriculate (\\"eared\\") stem with basal corners that flare outward. The blade edges are slightly serrated with a recurved outline‚Äîwide at the bottom, then narrowing before becoming wide and then thin again at the distal end, a so- called \\"fish shaped profile\\". The flaking style is generally random, with no attention given to alignment of flake scars. However, collateral flaking‚Äîwhere parallel flakes have been removed equally, resulting in a median ridge on the blade edges‚Äîhas also been observed in some specimens. The basal edge of the Golondrina presents concave with a deep basal notch that varies from a flattened, inverted, v-shape to recurved. The Golondrina point can range in length from 32‚Äì61 mm, with a width ranging from 23‚Äì32 mm and a thickness from 6‚Äì8 mm. The width of the base ranges from 22‚Äì29 mm with a typical basal concavity of 4 mm or more. The Golondrina is unfluted, without a longitudinal channel flake. The point has an expanding hafting area where the width, upward from the stem, increases in size. Analysis suggests that Golondrina points were attached on split-stem hafts either with or without foreshafts. They may have served a dual function as projectile points as well as butchering knives. By nature of a split-stem haft style, Golondrina points would not need to be deeply set, resulting in a largely exposed cutting edge. The hafting area, as well as the side and basal edges are usually ground dull. Edwards chert, Alibates agate, and Tecovas jasper were the major materials utilized by Paleo- Indians in the Southern Plains for the manufacture of flaked stone implements. Chert was the most important stone for tool making throughout pre-historic central Texas and there were many available sites where it was acquired and knapped. Age and cultural affiliations Most Golondrina points have been dated to the Transitional Paleo-Indian Period, between 9000‚Äì7000 BP, with excavation of stratified sites along with radiocarbon dating providing a definitive age. The first dating of Golondrina points was made after excavations of area C in the Devil's Mouth site which revealed Paleo-Indian projectile points that were radiocarbon assayed to 8700 BP. Later excavations in 1976, at the nearby Baker Cave in Texas, revealed a large hearth in the Golondrina stratum containing a wide variety of small game and plant remains left by early hunter gathers. This archaeological assemblage was termed Golondrina Complex, and the materials were attributed to the post-Pleistocene period. At the same site, Golondrina materials stratified near the base of a rock-shelter deposit were radiocarbon dated at 9000 BP Projectile points featuring more Archaic characteristics, including early barbed and early stemmed, share an overlapping chronology with Golondrina. Distribution Golondrina points are widespread across much of central, southern, and western Texas, with distribution extending northward along the Balcones Escarpment. They are particularly prevalent across the South Texas Plains, so much so as to be said to represent the first unique cultural pattern in the area. Most Golondrina specimens from the South Texas Plains are not excavated but rather found on the site's surface. They often appear as part of mixed collections with artifacts of later periods. Several sites have also been found in Arkansas as well as in the Lower Pecos Canyonlands and the Mexican states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Le√≥n. Comparison with other projectile points Dalton points display a similar auriculated stem as the Golondrina which can lead to confusion between the two types. Dalton blade edges, however, are characteristically more serrated. The Golondrina can be difficult to type because of its similarity to other point classifications. In particular the distinction between Golondrina and Plainview is not yet completely resolved. =Plainview= Past hypotheses have suggested mistakenly that the Golondrina was a descendant or variant of the Plainview type. Although the two points exhibit similarities, particularly in terms of shape, they are now recognized as separate types. Identification is made from a lack of an auriculated, fishtail base on the Plainview and a deeper basal concavity on the Golondrina. Plainview points may have served to bring down large bison, while Golondrina points may have been used for killing smaller game such as deer, as well as doubling as a butchering knife. Compared to the split-stem hafting style of the Golondrina point without a deep setting, the shape of the Plainview points would necessitate them being set relatively deeply into a socketed haft that once bound would leave less of the cutting edge exposed. Stratigraphic evidence from the St. Mary's Hall site in southern, central Texas implies that Golondrina may have superseded Plainview on the southern Plains. =Others= The Simpson and Suwannee points, found in Florida and the Southeastern United States, are similar to the Golondrina in shape and age. The Dalton point, found in the central United States, shares a similar outline and basal corner auriculation with Golondrina, which may imply that they are part of a series. Identification is made by examination of the blade edges‚ÄîGolondrina exhibits much less serration. The Meserve type has also been known to cause confusion, as it is considered a resharpened variant of the Plainview and Golondrina types.

It was designed by Finnish modernist architect Alvar Aalto.  History  Nave Design on the project began in 1965‚Äì66. The Archbishop of Bologna, Cardinal Giacomo Lercaro secured Aalto's participation upon seeing his work in an exhibition in Florence at the Palazzo Strozzi. Lercaro had also commissioned architects Kenzo Tange and Le Corbusier to design churches in his domain. Because both Aalto and Lercaro died in 1976, and only some portions of the project masterplan were completed, this work could be considered posthumous.Altar Construction began in 1975. The church was consecrated in 1978. The Campanile was completed as late as 1993.  Architecture  The church is structured by six asymmetric prefabricated concrete frames, or arches in descending size towards the chancel. They support a series of prefabricated light scoops, which are conic sections, giving the church its distinctive exterior profile, which some liken to an abstraction of the local Apennine mountains. The facades are faced with mortared stone, and the roof is copper sheeting. The interior is mostly whitewashed plaster, which advantageously reflects northern light brought in from the scoops above. Wooden pews, each slightly shorter in length than the preceding one as they approach the chancel are placed on the terra cotta tile floors. The altar is unadorned and hewn from a single block of marble. The tabernacle was also designed by Aalto, although it is not in its original location. A slightly sunken hexagonal baptistery is appended to the northwest corner of the church, that has a large pyramidal skylight placed over the baptismal font as well as a vertical slit window viewing the river Reno, which flows by the church to the north. Model of the building at Alvar Aalto Museum The architecture references both the distinctive light fixtures Aalto designed as well as his bent plywood furniture produced by his company Artek.

Clark. Birch plies are impregnated with phenolic resin, such as Haskelite and laminated together in a mold under heat (280 ¬∞F, 138 ¬∞C) and pressure for use as a lightweight structural material. Similar to plywood, Duramold and other lightweight composite materials were considered critical during periods of material shortage in World War II, replacing scarce materials like aluminum alloys and steel.Parker, Dana T. Building Victory: Aircraft Manufacturing in the Los Angeles Area in World War II, pp. 51-52, 56, Cypress, CA, 2013. . The material has some advantages over metal in strength, construction technique, and weight. A cylinder made of duramold is 80% stronger than a cylinder made of aluminum. There are over 17 varieties of Duramold, using various quantities of birch or poplar wood, with as many as seven plies. The Duramold process has also been used to make radomes for aircraft as well as missile bodies. The Fairchild Aircraft Corporation patented the process, designing and constructing the AT-21, (NX/NC19131) as the first aircraft made using the Duramold process. Several aircraft used Duramold in parts of their structure but the largest aircraft manufactured with the process is the Hughes H-4 Hercules designed by Howard Hughes and Glenn Odekirk, which was almost completely built with Duramold in very large sections.Parker, Dana T. Building Victory: Aircraft Manufacturing in the Los Angeles Area in World War II, pp. 49-58, Cypress, CA, 2013. . Hughes Aircraft had purchased rights to the process for this use. The Duramold and Haskelite process was first developed in 1937, followed by Gene Vidal's Weldwood and later the Aeromold process produced by the Timm Aircraft Company. In the United Kingdom, the De Havilland Aircraft Company (founded by Geoffrey de Havilland, a cousin of Olivia de Havilland, the actress who dated Howard Hughes in 1938) used similar composite construction for aircraft including the DH.88 Comet, DH.91 Albatross, the Mosquito, and Vampire.

Edwin J. Hayes Campbell R. Scott  Personal lives  = Edwin J. Hayes = Edwin James Hayes was born 23 March 1918 in Brisbane, the son of Edwin Hayes and Kathleen Hayes (n√©e Gredden). He completed secondary school at Saint Ignatius' College, Riverview in Sydney, then attended the Julian Ashton Art School in the Queen Victoria Building, Sydney, for one year. In 1935 he commenced his tertiary education at Brisbane Central Technical College, then went on to complete his articles with E. M. Ford of Chambers & Ford, from 1935 to 1938. In 1939, he moved back to Sydney in order to pass the Board of Architects of NSW examination. Successful in his results and following his registration as an architect, Hayes received his RAIA and decided to move back to Brisbane to re-join the practice of Chambers & Ford. His time with the practice lasted until 1944 as he then chose to join the army where he remained until the end of all hostile action in 1945. Returning to Australian soil, he went on to work for J. P. Donoghue for six months, but resigned from the practice in order to develop a partnership with Campbell Scott which lasted until June 1984. Hayes died in Brisbane on 4 October 1997. = Campbell R. Scott = Campbell Royston Scott was born 4 May 1921 at Corinda, a suburb of Brisbane. He received his primary education at Coorparoo State School, and later moved to England to complete his secondary schooling at Clifton College. On completion of his courses, Scott had a series of jobs which ranged from selling bacon slicers and weighing scales, to carpentry with his uncle. Scott‚Äôs architectural studies began after he undertook an extra year of maths and an art subject in order to begin his study of architecture at Brisbane Central Technical College. During World War Two, Scott also volunteered for the army. His enlistment was denied because the principal of the college (a certain Mr. Cummings) wanted to begin a degree course in architecture at the University of Queensland and his diploma students, including Scott, were required to write a thesis. Scott‚Äôs thesis was later described by Professor Cummings as \\"the worst thesis he had ever read\\". In 1946, Scott completed his sixth year at the University of Queensland and in 1947 was awarded the RAIA Student Medallion. He died in Brisbane on 7 January 2007.  Notable projects  Hayes and Scott began their practice in 1946. Many opportunities presented themselves because of the expansion and development throughout Australia. As major cities began to grow, it became evident that affordable, post-war housing was required. This provided a window for Australian architects to expand their understanding of this sector and to develop ideas and techniques to achieve needed results. Hayes & Scott could stand out as their small, modest, economic and technologically explorative works of slab-on-ground construction, flat roofs and floor-to-ceiling glazing could replace the traditional Queensland corrugated roof houses set on stumps. = Harvey Graham House, 1953 = Harvey Graham House, 1953 Their most notable project is the Harvey Graham Beach House, built in 1953. It was seen as a vanguard of post-war residential architecture. The design itself was in typical Hayes & Scott style with a slab-on-ground construction, flat roof and floor-to-ceiling glazing. The project was influenced by architects such as Walter Gropius, Marcel Breuer and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. Due to similar characteristics, it has also been said that the design of the Beach House was strongly influenced by the drawings of the Case Study House by Charles Eames. Along with the modernist design came the murals which portrayed the partnership‚Äôs developmental approach to colour. Their love of using black on everything \\"against the sky\\" (e.g. eaves, gutters, chimney caps, etc.) is also seen. = The Ritchie House, 1955 = An unusual example, the Ritchie House is in fact two dwellings designed by Haynes & Scott, the first in 1955 and the second (at the back of the property) in 1965 located on Gilgandra Street in Indooroopilly, Brisbane. The houses are an excellent example of Haynes & Scott post-war residential architecture and provide a unique perspective of the evolving style of the firm over the 10 year period between the completion of each house. Notable aspects include the slab-on-ground construction, floor-to- ceiling doorways throughout, and the use internally of greens and blues to make rooms appear larger and cooler. Particular attention was given to the small details including the use of a striking ceiling to the ground twin pole at the front of the property reminiscent of the design feature of the Villa Mairea by Alvar Aalto. = The Jacobi House, 1957 = The Jacobi House, 1957 A house designed for Carol and Joan Jacobi on the slopes of Mount Cootha was acknowledged to be one of the firm‚Äôs exemplars for regional modern residential projects. The design of the house contributed to the formal transformation of the traditional \\"Queenslander\\" ‚Äì pyramid roof, surrounding verandas on three sides and floor raised on stumps. Particular attention was given to acoustic conditions for the enjoyment of recorded music. This resulted in an open \\"pavilion\\" style, where a diagonal split through the overall plan was strategically devised under a low-rise pyramid roof. = The Tait House or \\"Dream home\\", 1962 = The Tait House or \\"Dream Home\\", 1962 This home was designed as part of a competition organised by Hooker-Rex (a real estate development firm) to mark the opening of their Centenary Estate. Alma Tait was the Queensland winner. Hayes & Scott had to satisfy both the developers and the client. All entrants had to answer a series of questions about the designs of their ideal dream home. The results were then calculated and averaged. The results were conventional, so they had to work within those constraints. The final design reflected Tait‚Äôs desires but is still recognisable as the work of Hayes & Scott. Terracotta tiles were the result of a public vote in the competition. Interesting features present in this house are large north-facing windows, paved patio, roof overhang, side entry and perforated masonry screen that creates a drying court & rock garden. = Other projects = *Edwin Hayes: Walter's House, 1946, 99 Alexander Road, Ascot *Edwin Hayes: Hayes Residence, 1947, 125 The Esplanade, St Lucia (extended in 1966) *Campbell Scott: Hood House, 1947, 108 Ninth Avenue, St Lucia *Campbell Scott: Penny House, 1947, 41 Ninth Avenue, St Lucia *Campbell Scott: Scott's residence, 1948, 43 Ninth Avenue, St Lucia *Edwin Hayes: Frazer House, 1950, Broadbeach Boulevard, Surfers Paradise (demolished) *Campbell Scott: Vincent House, 1954, 153 Hawken Drive, St Lucia (substantially altered) *Campbell Scott: Archer House, 1956, Alexandra Parade, Alexandra Beach (demolished) *Edwin Hayes: Corbould House, 1958, 15 Cannes Avenue, Surfers Paradise *Edwin Hayes: Herford House, 1958, 41 River Drive, Surfers Paradise (substantially altered) *Campbell Scott: Clowes Extension, 1961, 66 Central Avenue, St Lucia *Edwin Hayes: Stubbs House, 1961, 30 Scenic Drive, Kenmore *Edwin Hayes: Bishop House, 1962, 67 Albatross Avenue, Mermaid Beach (demolished) *Campbell Scott: Hooker-Rex Display House, Centenary Estates, 1962, 28 Looranah Street, Jindalee *Campbell Scott: Zlotkowski House, 1967, 49 Monaco Street, Surfers Paradise (demolished)  Awards  * In 1947, Campbell Scott was awarded the RAIA Student Medallion. * In 1953, the practice was awarded the Queensland Award for Meritorious Architecture for their design of The Pfitzenmaier Beach House.

The most prominent leader was Barton W. Stone. The group was committed to restoring primitive Christianity. It merged with the Disciples of Christ (Campbell Movement) in 1832 to form what is now described as the American Restoration Movement (also known as the Stone- Campbell Restoration Movement.) Barton Stone Barton W. Stone Barton W. Stone was born to John and Mary Stone in 1772 in Port Tobacco, Maryland. During his childhood, the boy grew up within the Church of England, then had Baptist, Methodist and Episcopal church influences as well. Preachers representing Baptists and Methodists came to the area during the Second Great Awakening, and Baptist and Methodist chapels were founded in the county. Barton entered the Guilford Academy in North Carolina in 1790. While there, Stone heard James McGready (a Presbyterian minister) speak. A few years later, he became a Presbyterian minister. But, as Stone looked more deeply into the beliefs of the Presbyterians, especially the Westminster Confession of Faith, he doubted that some of the church beliefs were truly Bible-based.Leroy Garrett, The Stone-Campbell Movement: The Story of the American Restoration Movement, College Press, 2002, , , 573 pages He was unable to accept the Calvinistic doctrines of total depravity, unconditional election and predestination. He also believed that \\"Calvinism's alleged theological sophistication had . . . been bought at the price of fomenting division\\" and \\"blamed it . . . for producing ten different sects within the Presbyterian tradition alone.\\"Douglas Allen Foster and Anthony L. Dunnavant, The Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), Christian Churches/Churches of Christ, Churches of Christ, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2004, , , 854 pages, entry on \\"Calvinism\\" Cane Ridge revival Interior of the original meeting house at Cane Ridge, Kentucky In 1801, the Cane Ridge Revival in Kentucky planted the seed for a movement in Kentucky and the Ohio River valley to disassociate from denominationalism. In 1803 Stone and others withdrew from the Kentucky Presbytery and formed the Springfield Presbytery. The defining event of the Stone wing of the movement was the publication of Last Will and Testament of The Springfield Presbytery, at Cane Ridge, Kentucky, in 1804. The Last Will is a brief document in which Stone and five others announced their withdrawal from Presbyterianism and their intention to be solely part of the body of Christ.Marshall, Robert; Dunlavy, John; M'nemar, Richard; Stone, B. W.; Thompson, John; and Purviance, David (1804). The Last Will and Testament of the Springfield Presbytery The writers appealed for the unity of all who follow Jesus, suggested the value of congregational self-governance, and lifted the Bible as the source for understanding the will of God. They denounced the divisive use of the Westminster Confession of Faith,McAlister, Lester G. and Tucker, William E. (1975), Journey in Faith: A History of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), St. Louis, MO: Chalice Press, and adopted the name \\"Christian\\" to identify their group. Christian Connection Elias Smith had heard of the Stone movement by 1804, and the O'Kelly movement by 1808.Douglas Allen Foster and Anthony L. Dunnavant, The Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), Christian Churches/Churches of Christ, Churches of Christ, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2004, , , 854 pages, entry on Christian Connection The three groups merged by 1810. At that time the combined movement had a membership of approximately 20,000. This loose fellowship of churches was called by the names \\"Christian Connection/Connexion\\" or \\"Christian Church.\\"C. Leonard Allen and Richard T. Hughes, Discovering Our Roots: The Ancestry of the Churches of Christ, Abilene Christian University Press, 1988, Characteristics of the Stone movement The cornerstone for the Stone movement was Christian freedom, which led them to a rejection of all the historical creeds, traditions and theological systems that had developed over time and a focus on a primitive Christianity based on the Bible. While restoring primitive Christianity was central to the Stone movement, they saw restoring the lifestyle of the early church as essential, and during the early years \\"focused more . . . on holy and righteous living than on the forms and structures of the early church. The group did also seek to restore the primitive church. However, due to concern that emphasizing particular practices could undermine Christian freedom, this effort tended to take the form of rejecting tradition rather than an explicit program of reconstructing New Testament practices. The emphasis on freedom was strong enough that the movement avoided developing any ecclesiastical traditions, resulting in a movement that was \\"largely without dogma, form, or structure.\\" What held \\"the movement together was a commitment to primitive Christianity.\\" Another theme was that of hastening the millennium. Many Americans of the period believed that the millennium was near and based their hopes for the millennium on their new nation, the United States. Members of the Stone movement believed that only a unified Christianity based on the apostolic church, rather than a country or any of the existing denominations, could lead to the coming of the millennium. Stone's millennialism has been described as more \\"apocalyptic\\" than that of Alexander Campbell, in that he believed people were too flawed to usher in a millennial age through human progress.Richard Thomas Hughes and R. L. Roberts, The Churches of Christ, 2nd Edition, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2001, , , 345 pages Rather, he believed that it depended on the power of God, and that while waiting for God to establish His kingdom, one should live as if the rule of God were already fully established. For the Stone movement, this had less to do with eschatological theories and more about a countercultural commitment to live as if the kingdom of God were already established on earth. This apocalyptic perspective or world view led many in the Stone movement to adopt pacifism, avoid participating in civil government, and reject violence, militarism, greed, materialism and slavery. Merger with the Disciples of Christ \\"Raccoon\\" John Smith The Stone movement was characterized by radical freedom and lack of dogma, while the Campbell movement was characterized by a \\"systematic and rational reconstruction\\" of the early church. Despite their differences, the two movements agreed on several critical issues. Both saw restoring apostolic Christianity as a means of hastening the millennium. Both also saw restoring the early church as a route to Christian freedom. And, both believed that unity among Christians could be achieved by using apostolic Christianity as a model. The commitment of both movements to restoring the early church and to uniting Christians was enough to motivate a union between many in the two movements. The Stone and Campbell movements merged in 1832.Monroe E. Hawley, Redigging the Wells: Seeking Undenominational Christianity, Quality Publications, Abilene, Texas, 1976, (paper), (cloth)Davis, M. M.

Eerdmans Publishing, 2004, , , 854 pages, Introductory Chronology This was formalized at the High Street Meeting House in Lexington, Kentucky with a handshake between Barton W. Stone and \\"Raccoon\\" John Smith. Smith had been chosen, by those present, to speak in behalf of the followers of the Campbells. A preliminary meeting of the two groups was held in late December 1831, culminating with the merger on January 1, 1832. Two representatives of those assembled were appointed to carry the news of the union to all the churches: John Rogers, for the Christians and \\"Raccoon\\" John Smith for the reformers. Despite some challenges, the merger succeeded. Many believed the union held great promise for the future success of the combined movement, and greeted the news enthusiastically. With the merger, there was the challenge of what to call the new movement. Clearly, finding a Biblical, non-sectarian name was important. Stone wanted to continue to use the name \\"Christians.\\" Alexander Campbell insisted upon \\"Disciples of Christ\\". As a result, both names were used.Douglas Allen Foster and Anthony L.

RuPay facilitates electronic payment at all Indian banks and financial institutions. NPCI maintains ties with Discover Financial, JCB to enable RuPay card scheme gain international acceptance. In India, 90% of credit card transactions and almost all debit card transactions are domestic; however, the cost per transaction was low with RuPay compared to foreign card schemes.  Background  In 2009, RBI had asked the Indian Bank Association to create a non-profit payment solutions company which will design an indigenous payment card offering state-of-the-art technology that is secure, robust, scalable, simple and cost effective meeting the requirements of having domestic, open, multilateral system of payments. The card was tentatively referred as India Pay. After years of planning, NPCI had finalized the name of the proposed card as Rupay, a portmanteau of the words rupee and payment to avoid naming conflicts with other financial institutions using the same name. The colours used in the logo are an allusion to the tricolour flag of India. NPCI conceived it as an alternative to Mastercard and Visa while consolidate and integrate various payment systems in India. RBI in its vision paper 2009‚Äì12 on payment systems in India said that the need for such a system arises from the absence of a domestic price setter that has caused the Indian banks to bear the high cost for affiliation and the connection with international card associations schemes like Visa and Mastercard resulting in the need for routing even domestic transactions which account for more than 90%, through a switch located outside the country.https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/PublicationReport/Pdfs/VIS01092009.pdf The RuPay scheme was launched on 26 March 2012. RuPay was dedicated to India on 8 May 2014, by the then President of India, Pranab Mukherjee, at the Rashtrapati Bhavan in New Delhi.  Products  = Consumer =  RuPay Debit  RuPay Debit cardAs of July 2018, RuPay cards have been issued across the length and breadth of the country to saving-account and current- account holders of over 1100 banks in India. Apart from the main private- sector and public-sector banks, RuPay cards are also issued by cooperative banks (scheduled cooperative banks, district cooperative banks, state cooperative banks, urban cooperative banks) and regional rural banks (RRBs) in the country.  RuPay Credit  Rupay credit cards were in operation since June 2017, according to NPCI Managing Director and CEO A P Hota with eight public sector banks, one private sector bank and one cooperative bank issuing the card without any formal launch. A pilot project was going on to technically enabling more and more banks in RuPay credit cards with additional five public sector banks and by March 2018, NPCI plans to have 25 banks altogether on board.

Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) in collaboration with the Union Bank of India and the National Payment Corporation of India launched the IRCTC-UBI RuPay pre-paid card on 2015 to book tickets, do shopping and pay service bills. The card is a first-of-its-kind in the market as both virtual as well as physical cards are being issued to customers in two variants. Kochi1, a RuPay prepaid smart card rolled out by the Kochi Metro Rail Ltd (KMRL) with the help of the Axis Bank on 2 March 2019 became the first inter- modal transit card when its usage was extended to private buses with additional services including parking solutions in near future. It is launched under Kochi Smart City project and there are plans to extend the card to auto- rickshaws, ferries including that of the Kerala State Water Transport Department, proposed Water Metro, KSRTC buses so as to make it a Common Mobility Card in all respects. RBL Bank had partnered with GI Technology, a Wirecard subsidiary and India's largest wallet-based domestic money remittance company operating under the Brand Name ICashCard to launch RBL-ICASH co- branded, open loop RuPay Prepaid Card. ItzCash, India's largest digital payments company announced that it has partnered with RBL Bank to launch the country's first co-branded Rupay Platinum Prepaid Card. The multi-purpose card will roll out a suite of prepaid services across physical and virtual platforms. The service was launched to ensure seamless interoperability, access to unlocking multiple solutions and driving the prepaid program of the nation.  RuPay Contactless  alt=New Symbol RuPay Contactless is a contactless payment technology feature that allows cardholders to wave their card in front of contactless payment terminals without the need to physically swipe or insert the card into a point-of-sale device. This is an EMV- compatible, contactless payment feature similar to Mastercard Contactless, Visa Contactless, and ExpressPay which use RFID technology. The National Payments Corporation of India's (NPCI) card network RuPay has launched a contactless prepaid NFC card. It launched the contactless card for the Ahmedabad Smart City project in association with ICICI Bank and Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. It also launched similar prepaid contactless cards for the Kochi Metro Rail Ltd (KMRL) and Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) in association with Axis Bank. Contactless can currently be used on transactions up to and including ‚Çπ2000. On March 2019 under ‚ÄòOne Nation, One Card‚Äô scheme a National Common Mobility Card (NCMC) for transportation was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a function in Ahmedabad on RuPay platform in order to avoid vendor lock-in and create an interoperable system under Make in India.alt= This is the latest development in the forward movement of the Interoperable Fare Management System. The main aim behind the card is to redefine payment for public transport systems and retail ease of access, at the cutting edge of digital payments. The project is under the purview of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, with the vision ‚ÄúOne Card for all payments‚Äù. With this theme, the card needed to be accepted across multiple verticals. It then made sense to take up a card which is gaining a significant amount of adoption in the contactless payment space. The specifications for the NCMC programme are with the government and it is not owned by any specific body, hence all card payment schemes are welcome to join the programme. Brihanmumbai Electricity Supply and Transport (BEST) buses are set to become the first public transportation in India to roll out the National Common Mobility Card (NCMC). The one nation, one card system will initially be implemented on a pilot basis from November 2019 and will be available widely only from 2020. More than 10,000 BEST conductors will be given the hand-held devices that would be able to scan the NCMC cards with just one tap, alongside generating paper tickets. Visa is ready with the specifications to start issuing cards on the NCMC network and has started discussions with banks to issue their cards on NCMC as well, but it will take some time for the cards to start getting rolled out in the market. Just weeks after its biggest competitor Visa, Mastercard set to join One Nation One Card project. After discussions with Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) and Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) confirmed the trial run from 1 January 2020 with four automatic fare collection (AFC) gates at Nadaprabhu, Kempegowda and Byappanahalli stations. Passengers of Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) buses and Metro trains on the Majestic-Whitefield route will be able to use the card. Existing AFC gates at Phase 1 metro stations will have to be upgraded while AFC gates at Phase 2 metro stations operational by 2024 will accept new cards. Around 11,000 old electronic ticketing machines will be replaced with new android-based ones of which around 2,000 have already been changed to accept the card. State Bank of India (SBI) in collaboration with Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) launched SBI-IRCTC RuPay contactless card on 28 July 2020 to reward frequent railway travellers in India with the proposal of maximum savings during the journey period. The card uses Near Field Communication (NFC) technology and can be used by the railway travellers for benefits on retail, dining and entertainment besides transaction fee waivers.  RuPay Global  RuPay- JCB Global CardThe NPCI started issuing global cards in 2014. Singapore has offered assistance to promote India's digital payment network RuPay card overseas by becoming its first international partner. On 7 March 2012, NPCI entered into a strategic partnership with Discover Financial Services (DFS) for RuPay, enabling the acceptance of RuPay Global Cards to utilize the Discover, Diners Club International and PULSE networks for international purchases and cash access outside of India. Both companies were also working to implement D-PAS, Discover's EMV technology to offer chip-based cards to RuPay card members. The cards are accepted by over 4.1 crore (41 million) merchants and 18 lakh (1.8 million) ATMs across 190 countries. NPCI with JCB launched RuPay-JCB Global card on 22 July 2019. After extending domestic POS terminal and ATM support for incoming foreign JCB card holders in 2017, NPCI entered into the second phase of partnership with the launch of co-branded card to further increase the international acceptance of RuPay. The card will offer special cashback program for POS transactions outside India in addition to selected popular international destinations for travellers. It will support additional services such as in-city JCB Lounges located in airports with round the year merchant promotions all over the world. While debit cards are only being issued initially through the partnership, credit and prepaid cards are also on the anvil. RuPay issued 6.4 crore (64 million) Global Cards between 2014 and March 2019. RuPay has tied-up with international players like Discover, Japan Credit Bureau and China Union Pay to enhance its international acceptance and recently achieved a milestone of issuing 25 million RuPay ‚Äì Discover global cards.

PUNGRAIN (Punjab Grains Procurement Corporation Ltd) pays commission agents through the RuPay Debit Card and developed a commission agent network called the Kisan Arhtia Information and Remittance Online Network (KAIRON) with the help of the National Payments Corporation of India. Kotak Mahindra Bank, in partnership with RuPay, rolled out an initiative for financial inclusion, where the dairy farmers across 75 cooperative societies of Amul in regions of Burdwan and Hooghly of West Bengal will be able to get their payments directly into their accounts on the same day as the sale of their milk. The same model is planned to be adopted in the state of Gujarat where 1200 cooperative societies comprising over 3,00,000 dairy farmers will be the part of the programme. In 2017 post demonetisation, the government decided that NABARD will coordinate the conversion of operative/live Kisaan Credit Cards into RuPay ATM cum Debit Kisaan Credit Cards by Cooperative Banks and Regional Rural Banks on priority.

His career thus far has included being an editor, lecturer, critic and writer. Background and career Paul Morgan was born in Melbourne and is an Australian architect. Morgan completed high school in Melbourne and then followed his education into RMIT University (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology) to study architecture and completed a Master of Design in Urban Design.http://www.paulmorganarchitects.com/content/profile/paul_morgan.asp He also coordinated of RMIT University‚Äôs Master of Architecture course during the early 1990s. Morgan has tutored in architectural design studios at RMIT from 1989‚Äì2016 and Monash in 206/17 and been a regular lecturer. As a result of this teaching, he has been able to produce informed and diverse teaching and learning environments. Through this his designs have recently become more focused on educational buildings with sustainable design elements. Morgan has been practicing architecture for more than 20 years and since 1997 has worked in private practice with most of his projects being educational, government, commercial and residential. He was editor of Transition Magazine a Melbourne‚Äìbased architecture publication in 1985-87 and also in 1992-94, and also has written magazine articles contributing to the local and international design dialogue. Morgan has now emerged as one of Australian most innovative architectural practices, with various awards for diverse ranges of architecture. In 2007 the practice was awarded the Robin Boyd Award for Residential Buildings by the AIA for the Cape Schanck House. The practice has won awards from the European Centre for Architecture Art and Urban Design /Chicago Athenaeum and was nominated for the Zumtobel Award (Berlin) honoring outstanding sustainable contributions to architecture and humanity. PMA has exhibited at the Venice, Istanbul and Beijing Biennales as well as the World Architecture Festival. A monograph on the practice entitled Minimono 01: Paul Morgan Architects was published by Uro Media in 2013. GippsTAFE Learning Centre, Leongatha GippsTAFE Learning Centre Designed in Leongatha, this is the first TAFE building in Australia to be awarded a 5 Star Green Star rating by the Green Building Council of Australia.http://www.paulmorganarchitects.com/content/education_and_public_projects/gipps_tafe_leongatha_learning_centre.asp The design approach was to integrate expressive architecture with sustainable design. The building responds to the kinetics of the environment with the design similar to an envelope to enhance natural ventilation through the building. Wind scoops surrounding the south elevation windows to direct airflow into teaching area's reducing the need for air-conditioners. The aerodynamic form enables air to pass freely through the structure while fairings on the north elevation deflect hot northerly winds and capture the cooling easterly breeze. The result is a building that incorporates the building‚Äôs conceptual and sustainable design aspects without having to compromise one for the other. The steel cladding communicates the typical industrial sheds surrounding the town and translates to the ground with the exploration of the Australian veranda through contemporary design. The materials all have a degree of sustainability while the innovative envelope encloses an energetic and varied series of interior spaces.http://www.paulmorganarchitects.com/content/education_and_public_projects/gipps_tafe_leongatha_learning_centre.asp Cape Schanck House Cape Schanck House The Cape Schanck House (Australia 2006) is positioned in close proximity to a jagged shoreline vulnerable to the natural elements. The precarious location of the house and the integration of such natural element have been crucial design elements in the result of an innovative and sensitive approach to residential architecture. Paul Morgan describes the Cape Schanck House as a ‚Äòbreakthrough‚Äô project for the Paul Morgan Architects practice. Morgan discusses this house as ‚Äòpure architecture‚Äô, a project whose architectural intent was not mediated by constraints. Morgan describes the architectural approach to the Cape Schanck House and the focus on sustainability as expressive. The direct integration of the house with the coastal vegetation operates as a design method to direct the form of the house. The Cape Schanck House illustrates a consistent design approach that Morgan defines as ‚Äòkinetics of the environment‚Äô. Expressionism found in nature is utilised as a tool to inform the design process. Aspects of nature are used as inspiration and mimicked in various details throughout the design.

It was instantly successful, having to be reissued three times that year alone and with the 1991 release reaching number 25 on the Oricon chart. Background and release Having completed their final lineup in July 1988 with the joining of vocalist Kyo, D'erlanger began recording their first album in October. La Vie En Rose was released on February 10, 1989 via Danger Crue Records. Its sound was a drastic departure from their previous material, being punk and alternative rock instead of the speed and power metal they originally had. The first press sold out by pre-order alone, so another press was made just 11 days later, which had a different cover. That version was reissued one month later on March 21. On December 10, another press was released in two covers; the original and another new one. On April 21, 1991, one more different cover version was released that would become the cover used on all future reissues. La Vie En Rose was remastered, along with their second album Basilisk, and released on April 21, 1995. It, along with the rest of the band's albums, was remastered and released again on April 18, 2007. The arrangement for all tracks is credited to guitarist Cipher, except \\"1999 -Shy Boy Story-\\", which is credited to Cipher and Jimmy of 44Magnum. A demo of \\"Sadistic Emotion\\" with original drummer Shi-Do and second vocalist Dizzy was previously released in 1987. A version of \\"Lullaby\\" titled \\"Lullaby -1990-\\" was released as a single on September 5, 1990, it included a ballad version of the song as a b-side. Legacy The title track was reworked into \\"Bara Iro no Jinsei\\" for D'erlanger's second album Basilisk, which also included an acoustic arrangement of \\"I Can't Live Without You\\".

Robbins was a former member of the folk band, The Highwaymen. The New York Times described Robbins as a \\"fixture on the folk-music scene.\\" He was the father of actor and director Tim Robbins. Early life Robbins was born in Spokane, Washington, in 1931, the son of Agnes J. (n√©e Hughes) and Richard Lee Robbins.https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/K86M-DW5 He moved with his family to Los Angeles, California, when he was less than one year old. Robbins began playing with the percussion section of the Long Beach Symphony Orchestra as a high school student. He received a scholarship to attend the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he joined the university's marching band as a drum major. He met his future wife, Mary Bledsoe, then a collegiate flautist, as a student at UCLA. Robbins left UCLA before his graduation and enlisted in the United States Air Force in 1951. During his time in the U.S. Air Force, Robbins became a conductor and drum major for the 542nd Division at an air force base in Selma, Alabama. Career Robbins played with several bands and musicians early in his career. he became a member of the trio, Cumberland Three, in 1960. The band had been formed by Roulette Records and musician John Stewart, who sent them New York City. Robbins soon became active in the city's folk music scenes, especially in Greenwich Village. Robbins recorded three albums with the Cumberland Three, including two albums of American Civil War music. Robbins left the Cumberland Three after three albums and joined the Belafonte Singers, a twelve-member group which performed with Harry Belafonte. He also performed with Tom Paxton. Robbins joined the folk band, The Highwaymen in 1962, replacing departing member Stephen Trott, who left the band to attend Harvard Law School. He remained as a member of the band for three years until its breakup in 1964. Robbins, who appeared on five of the band's albums, performed for the band as a guitarr√≥n mexicano player, songwriter and baritone singer. His live album credits with the band included Hootenanny With the Highwaymen, One More Time and Homecoming. Robbins has been credited with influencing some of The Highwaymen more politically oriented music during his membership. Robbins became the manager of The Gaslight Cafe, a former folk music club in New York City's Greenwich Village, during the late 1960s. The club saw performances by well known musicians early in their careers, including Bob Dylan, Bonnie Raitt and Bruce Springsteen. Robbins also became active within other sectors of the Greenwich Village community, including as the choir director of the Church of St. Joseph in Greenwich Village. He also founded the Occasional Singers, a choral group which performed \\"avant garde\\" music, according to the New York Times. Outside of music, Robbins also pursued a career in acting. He worked as a stage actor in New York City, including off Broadway productions and musicals. He was also cast in several small films roles, including Bob Roberts in 1992, Dead Man Walking in 1995, the 1999 dramatic film, Cradle Will Rock, and the 1998 M. Night Shyamalan film, Wide Awake.

Two Quran verses, 5:11 and 4:101, are related to this event. Note: Book contains a list of battles of Muhammad in Arabic, English translation available hereMu·∏•ammad Ibn  ªAbd al-WahhƒÅb, Mukhta·π£ar zƒÅd al-ma ªƒÅd, p. 345..  Background  Muhammad learned that certain tribes of Banu Ghatafan were assembling at Dhat al-Riqa with suspicious purposes.  Battle  He proceeded towards Nejd leading 400-700 men after he had mandated Abu Dhar to manage Madinah during his absence. In the Umayyad version, the Umayyad chief who killed Abu Dhar, Uthman bin Affan, is given this honor. The Muslim fighters penetrated deep into their land until they reached Nakhlah where they came across bedouins of Ghatfan. This is called the expedition of Dhat al-Riqa (the patchwork of mountains). Muhammad conducted a surprise raid to disperse them. The Ghatafan fled to the mountains, leaving their women behind. No fighting took place, but Muhammad attacked their habitations and captured their women. Other sources report Muhammad signed a treaty with the tribe.. When prayer time came, the Muslims worried that the Ghatafan men might descend from their mountain hideout and attack them while they were praying. Apprehending this fear, Muhammad introduced the ‚Äòservice of prayer of danger'. In this system, parties of faithful take turns standing guard while the other party prays. According to Muslim sources, God revealed verses 4:101 regarding shortening of a prayer. .  Aftermath  While Muhammad was resting under a shade tree at Dhat al-Riqa, a polytheist man came to him with the intention of killing him. The man was playing with Muhammad's sword and pointed it to Muhammad; asking him: Muhammad replied: The man asked: Muhammad said: The would-be assassin then sheathed the sword and returned it to Muhammad. Verse 5:11 was then revealed, proclaiming Allah's protection for Muhammad. After fifteen days Muhammad returned to Medina. However, he was not at peace; he apprehended that the Banu Ghatafan might attack to reclaim their women. Timing Some scholars claim that the expedition took place in Nejd (a large tableland in the Arabian Peninsula) in Rabi‚Äò Ath-Thani or Jumada Al-Ula, A.H. 4 (or beginning of AH 5). They claim that it was strategically necessary to carry out this campaign in order to quell the rebellious Bedouins to prepare for the encounter with the polytheists, i.e. minor Badr Battle in Sha‚Äòban A.H. 4. However, Safiur Rahman Mubarakpuri claimed that Dhat Ar-Riqa‚Äò campaign took place after the fall of Khaibar (and not as part of the Invasion of Nejd). This is supported by the fact that Abu Hurairah and Abu Musa Ashaari witnessed the battle. Abu Hurairah embraced Islam only some days before Khaibar, and Abu Musa Al-Ash‚Äòari came back from Abyssinia (Ethiopia) and joined Muhammad at Khaibar. The rules relating to the prayer of fear that Muhammad observed at Dhat Ar-Riqa‚Äò campaign, were revealed at the Asfan Invasion. Scholars say that this took place after Al-Khandaq (the Battle of the Trench). Islamic sources =Quran 4:101 and 5:11= The Quran verse 4:101 was reportedly revealed in this event, regarding shortening of prayers, as was verse 5:11, regarding a man who was sent to kill Muhammad or threaten him which states: =Biographical literature= The event is mentioned by the Muslim jurist Tabari as follows: This event is mentioned in Ibn Hisham's biography of Muhammad. The Muslim jurist Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya mentions the event in his biography of Muhammad, Zad al-Ma'ad. Among the modern secondary sources that mention this is The Sealed Nectar.Ar-Raheeq Al-Makhtum - The Sealed Nectar . Dar-us-Salam Publications. =Discrepancy in dates= It is well documented that the Battle of Badr was fought on Friday, 17 Ramadan AH 2. In his book Essai sur l'histoire des arabes avant l'islamisme, pendant l'epoque de Mahomet Armand-Pierre Caussin de Perceval equates Ramadan with the Muslim month ending in January AD 624 and notes (correctly) that the seventeenth of that month was a Saturday (14 January). Again, it is well documented that the battle of Uhud was fought on Saturday, 7 Shawwal AH 3. Caussin de Perceval equates Shawwal with the Muslim month ending in February 625 and says that the seventh of that month was Tuesday. The new moon of that month fell on a Monday morning so would have become visible that evening. Thus the first would have been Tuesday and the seventh Monday. The reason why the dates do not agree is that Caussin de Perceval assumes an intercalation every three years (thus in AH 1, AH 4 and AH 7). This period is too long (the average is seven intercalations in nineteen years rather than seven in 21), which means that his dates become progressively more and more late moving back from the reform of the calendar in AD 632. Since the day of the week in the Muslim calendar advances by one or two days per month the discrepancy is resolved by pushing Caussin de Perceval's calculated dates back a month. =Hadith literature= The Sunni Hadith collection Sahih Muslim also says about this event: See also * List of battles of Muhammad Notes 625 Campaigns led by Muhammad ","title":"Expedition of Dhat al-Riqa"},{"id":"31502998","text":"Donal Lynch is an Irish journalist who has worked as a columnist for the Sunday Independent since 2002.

The farm‚Äîlocated in the townships of Palmyra, Wayne County and Manchester, Ontario County, New York‚Äîincludes the Sacred Grove, the Smiths' restored frame home, and a reconstructed log home. The farm site passed into ownership of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1915, and in the 1990s, the Church restored the frame home, reconstructed the log home, and built a welcome center. Church missionaries provide free tours. History Reconstructed Smith log cabin Joseph Smith, Sr., his wife Lucy Mack Smith, and some of their children moved from Norwich, Vermont, to Palmyra, New York, in 1816. In 1818 or 1819, the family built a log home near property owned by the estate of Nicholas Evertson of New York City, but did not enter a purchase agreement for the land until a land agent had been appointed in 1820. Smith, Sr. agreed to pay the Evertson estate between $600 and 700 for the farm. In 1825, the family moved into a larger and more comfortable frame home that they had built on the property but were unable to make payments on the land. A carpenter who had completed the house sued the Smiths for his costs in February 1825. A new agent for the Evertson estate also foreclosed on them, although a sympathetic Quaker, Lemuel Durfee, purchased the farm and permitted the family to rent the frame house until they returned to the log home in the spring of 1829. The Smiths left the area in 1830. The farm was purchased by the LDS Church in 1907 and passed into its care in 1915. The instigator of the purchase was LDS Church president Joseph F. Smith. The grove of trees on the site where Joseph Smith was assumed to have had his First Vision became a pilgrimage site, and centennial celebrations were held there in 1920.

Modern scholars speculate that he was a key intelligence agent for Britain during the Great Game. Elias travelled extensively in the Karakoram, Hindu Kush, Pamirs, and Turkestan regions of High Asia. Life =Education= He born in Widmore, Bromley, Kent on 10 February 1844,http://search.findmypast.co.uk/results/world-records/england-and-wales- births-1837-2006?firstname=ney&lastname;=%20elias was the second son of Ney Elias (died 1891) of Kensington. Educated in London, Paris, and Dresden, he became in 1865 a fellow of the Royal Geographical SocietyWheeler, Stephen. \\"Obituary: Ney Elias, C. I. E.\\" The Geographical Journal, Vol. 10, No. 1 (Jul. 1897), pp. 101‚Äì106.[ and studied geography and surveying under the society's instructors. =Travels= In 1866, he went to Shanghai in the employment of a mercantile house; and in 1868 volunteered to lead an expedition and examine the old and new courses of the Hoang-ho. His account of this journey was published in the Royal Geographical Society's Journal in a paper which gave, Sir Roderick Murchison said, for the first time accurate information about the diversion of the Yellow River. In July 1872, accompanied by one Chinese servant, Elias started on a journey across the Gobi desert, travelling nearly 2,500 miles from the great wall to the Russian frontier, and thence another 2,300 miles to Nizhny Novgorod. The geographical results of the journey were summed up by Elias in a paper for the Royal Geographical Societyhttps://www.rgs.org/. It was accomplished at a time when the Chinese provinces traversed were overrun by the Tungani rebels. For many weeks Elias travelled in constant apprehension of attack; he had scarcely any sleep; and when he reached the Siberian frontier, the Russian officers stared at him as if he had dropped from the sky. By no means a robust man, his indomitable will and silent courage carried him through all the perils of the way; while the accuracy of his observation and the scientific value of his record earned the highest approval of authorities like Sir Henry Rawlinson and Sir Henry Yule. Elias received the Founder's Medal of the Royal Geographical Society (26 May 1873), and on the recommendations of Rawlinson and Sir Bartle Frere, his services were retained by the government of India. Nominated an extra attach√© to the Calcutta foreign office on 20 March 1874, Elias was appointed in September 1874 assistant to the resident at Mandalay; and shortly afterwards second in command of the overland mission to China, which turned back, owing to the murder of Augustus Raymond Margary. In 1876, Elias drew up a project for an expedition to Tibet ; but, owing to misunderstandings, the scheme fell through. In 1877, he was attached to Robert B. Shaw's abortive mission to Kashgar, and went in advance to Leh, where, on the death of Yakub Beg, ruler of Eastern Turkestan, and the abandonment of the mission, he remained as British joint-commissioner of Ladakh. In 1879, he started, on his own initiative, to inspect the road over the Karakorum, and, on nearing the frontier, sent a friendly message to the Chinese Amban of Yarkund, who invited him to come on. Accompanied by Captain Bridges, an ex-dragoon officer, and without waiting for the Indian foreign office to forbid the enterprise, he proceeded to Yarkund, where the Amban, though educated at the Pekin Jesuit college, pretended never to have heard either of England or India, and the insolent attentions of some Hunan braves nearly led to a collision. The visit, however, ended without serious misadventure, and the Indian government gave its sanction to this and subsequent journeys into Chinese Turkestan. Elias was thus gazetted as 'on special duty' at Yarkund from 14 June to 17 August 1879, 'on deputation to Kashgar' from 8 March to 26 August 1880, and 'on special duty at Kashgar from 26 May to September 1885,' having in the meantime taken furlough to England. In a letter to the Times, dated Kashgar, 10 July 1880, he gave an account of the reconquest of Eastern Turkestan by the Chinese. In September 1885, under orders from the Indian government, Elias left Yarkund for the Pamirs and Upper Oxus, and, in the course of an arduous journey, he made a route survey of six hundred miles from the Chinese frontier to Ishkashim, determined points and altitudes on the Pamirs, and visited the confluence of the Murghab and Panja rivers, solving the problem as to which was the upper course of the Oxus. Afterwards, crossing Badakhshan and Balkh, he joined the Afghan boundary commission near Herat, and thence returned to India by way of Balkh and Chitral, having traversed Northern Afghanistan without an escort, under a safe-conduct from Abdur Rahman Khan. In January 1888, he was made a C.I.E., but never accepted the distinction. From November 1888 to February 1889, he was on special duty in connection with the Sikkim Expedition, and in October 1889 took command of a mission to report on the political geography and condition of the Shan States on the Indo-Siamese frontier. Francis Younghusband states that in the spring of 1889 Elias advised him at the outset of his second major expedition through Hunza territory to the Yarkand River. On 14 December 1891 he was appointed agent to the governor- general at Meshed, and consul-general for Khorasan and Seistan. While on furlough in 1895, in collaboration with Mr. E. D. Ross, he brought out an English version of the Tarikh-i-Rashidi, by Mirza Haidar of Kashgar, cousin to the Emperor Baber, revising the translation and supplying an introduction and notes embodying much of his wide knowledge of the history and geography of Central Asia. =Retirement and death= In November 1896, he retired from the service. On 31 May 1897, he died suddenly at his rooms in North Audley Street, London, from the effects of blood poisoning. He was unmarried.

The new facilities were expected to advertise international sales of the crop; also to guarantee continuity of supply by regulating the sales and storing the beans for years. It was satisfied by giving over most of the site to a long term storage warehouse right behind the office headquarters. The Goroka air strip is located to the west of the site.

He was the son of prominent architect, civil engineer, and surveyor, Albert Purchas.  Biography  Guyon Purchas was born on 6 September 1862 in his father's mansion in Fitzwilliam Street, , Melbourne, and he spent his childhood in suburbs of Kew and Hawthorn.R.F. French, 1968, R.G.W. Purchas 1862 - 1940: a study of his life and work, Thesis Research Essay - University of Melbourne, Faculty of Architecture, P.3 After private secondary schooling, he sat for the matriculation examination of the University of Melbourne in February 1882, where he studied civil engineering and concurrent with this he commenced articles in his father's office. He reportedly failed a number of subjects during the second year, the reason said to be receiving his first big commission. His father however deemed one year of architectural experience to be worth three years of study. Guyon established his own practice in 1884, and also travelled overseas. In the 1880s he designed a number of houses and extensions in typical styles of the day, with the plain red brick picturesque Gothic and fretwork gables of Endion (now Kingsgate) at 252 Domain Road, built in 1890 hinting at his developing interests. A major project and the first of a number of hospital commissions was a substantial addition to the Women's Hospital on the corner of Grattan and Cardigan Streets in completed in 1888. The ward blocks were in a similar plain red brick style to Endion, while the entry block was in an unusual interpretation of Quuen Anne style. In 1889 he married Mary Teague, a widow whose son Eric Teague would later become his partner in his firm Purchas & Teague. In 1891-2 he built a mansion for himself and his family called Tay Creggan on a steep riverside site in . It is believed that Guyon may have speculated a good deal in property during the Land Boom of the late 1880s, and with the bank crash and depression starting in 1893 he eventually had to leave his house, and sold all the furniture, including antiques, in early 1894. Notices at the time stated his wife was then departing overseas, perhaps to join her husband, or he may also have tried his luck in gold boom Western Australia like many other architects, but by late 1894 he is noted as the architect of extensions for the Women's Hospital in Carlton. At the end of 1896 Guyon went into partnership with William Shields. Their first project was a new hotel In the late 1890s he contributed many articles to the local journal Arts & Crafts, and ran a course in Applied Art at the National Gallery School, which was focussed on wood carving. The class of 1896 was entirely female students, and the results were favourably reviewed, the products described as in various historic styles but also representing the growing desire for 'art in the household'. He was then engaged for his first project adding to and extending a large homestead in Victoria's rural Western District, then undergoing a period of growth. Many homesteads were rebuilt or greatly altered and extended at this time, with many notable examples in the new Arts & Crafts style. Purchas' design for Coragulac near Colac in 1897 involved a large addition to the earlier formal bluestone house, in matching bluestone, but as a picturesque compositions including a semi-circular bay with conical roof. The interiors included extensive use of plasterwork in the new Art Nouveau style, and a large timber fireplace with carved dragons on the corners, as seen at Tay Greggan. Coragulac was for the Robertson family, and this was followed by the work for which Purchas is best known, the extensive alterations to Purrumbete, with its multiple gables and lofty great hall, compete with minstrel's gallery with an elaborate Art Nouveau carved screen and integral artworks. This was for W T Manifold, a member of one of the most prominent Western District families, and was followed a few years later by work at the adjacent Wiridgil, for his brother Edward Manifold. Another large project continued in many stages was the rebuilding of the Children's Hospital in Carlton, beginning with a simply designed outpatients wing opened in 1899. The next stage was the far more prominent Princess May Pavilion on the corner of Drummond and Pelham Streets, completed in 1902. A tall design in red brick with lofty elaborate Dutch gables sporting oriel windows on three sides, and much plainer brick arched western elevation with inset verandahs. A nurses home was added in 1907, in a similar though less elaborate style facing Nicholson Street, though this, and the even plainer Edward Wilson wing facing Pelham Street built in 1913, are recorded as by William Shields alone. By 1906 William Shields then left to establish his own practice, and Purchas took his stepson on as a partner forming Purchas & Teague, who designed a range of warehouses and office buildings in the Melbourne's CBD in the next 10 years. In 1913 they designed a new Wool Exchange in King Street in a very early example of the revival of the Neoclassical, complete with engaged columns and pediment, but still in Edwardian red brick. It is also noted for its early use of reinforced concrete. In 1923 he retired from practice, and moved to the Blue Mountains in 1927. He returned to Victoria to in 1940, dying there the same year.  Notable projects  = Tay Creggan = In 1891-2 Guyon designed and built a large house for himself on a steep site on the Yarra River in Hawthorn, which he named Tay Creggan. Its extraordinary style led to suggestions that it was a copy of a house in England but there is no evidence for this. The house is more inventive than most Melbourne houses of the time, an imposing fantasy of shingled bays and window hoods, balconies and gables, a vibrant mix of English vernacular elements put together in an utterly romantic and picturesque way. After the sale of the house to the Spencer family, Purchas was invented back to redesign major rooms, creating the most important interiors in c1898. He rebuilt the central hall with a stair of finely worked kauri timber, with a notable stained glass window by William Montgomery depicting a hunting scene above, and tiled fireplace with beaten copper panel depicting the Spencer family crest. The most outstanding room is the billiard room, created out of the former ballroom, which is remarkable for the three stained glass domes above, the enormous Scottish Oak fireplace with Art Nouveau style copper repousse work, and the carved decoration of the roof timbers, which have carved dragons on the beam ends. = Purrumbete = Purrumbete Sketch The extensions and alterations to Purrumbete of 1902 can be considered a monument of Guyon's design sensibility and shows that his creativity was not lost during the depression. Designed for the Manifold family in the Western District, Purrumbete was in great contrast to Woodend Hotel. The homestead consisted of bluestone portions from 1860 and 1882, the latter part altered by Purchas, with new interiors and a second floor, along with an entirely new wing. All the elements of spatial design reflect the approach of the Arts & Crafts movement, creating an unusual Federation Arts and Crafts style. Guyon shows an understanding of a nascent Modernism, such as a logical progression of functional spaces and the use of solid and void as expression. Guyon's sensitivity allowed him to ensure each part of the alterations contributed to the unity of the whole building. The Arts & Crafts interiors include Art Nouveau details, and a spectacular great hall, with a minstrels gallery, and a series of integral painting by Walter Withers.

It was a village Panchayat until the mid 1980s when it became part of the Municipal Corporation of Alwal (MCA). In 2007, 12 Municipalities, including Alwal, and 8 Village Panchayats in and around Hyderabad were merged to become the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC). Since then, Now Yapral has been a part of GHMC (Neredmet Division, Malkajgiri Circle). Communities & Neighborhood In the mid 1980s, Yapral was a village surrounded by agricultural land with less than 3000 residents. Shortly thereafter, the surrounding farmland transformed into a huge residential area consisting of posh, gated communities and high-rise apartments. A similar change took place in the village itself, with most of the old houses being replaced by single/multi-story buildings. Posh communities in the village include Bhanu Enclave,Sylvan gardens,Patel's green park,green front,Mani Enclave,Prakrutikh Vihar, jupally homes,Tulsi Gardens, Shaili Gardens,Mahalakshmipuri Colony, Radha Regal Rows, Swarnandhra, Shridi enclave,Shanthi nagar,Sai Krupa Colony, and Employees Colony,Sai enclave, alongside many others like Rajha Convention. Nearby villages include Sainikpuri, Kapra, Alwal, Bolarum and Kowkur. Also nearby, is the Secunderabad Cantonment area. Culture Yapral lake was the major source of water for agriculture in the village. However, because of the local administration‚Äôs failure to preserve it, the water quality has continued to degrade for decades. For example, residents now must search for pure water to immerse florals during the famous annual Bathukamma festival. The famous Hindu Mahankali, Pochamma, Ranganayak, Mallanna, and Sai baba temples are in Yapral. Also in the vicinity, is the Hanuman temple on the cross roads towards Kowkur village. Over many decades, the Mahankali Bonalu and Mallanna jathara festivals have become a part of the villages annual tradition. Education & Recreation For decades, the Yapral Government School served as the major educational institution of the village and surrounding area. Later, Kendriya Vidyala, Valerian Grammar High School, and Pragathi High School were established for local students. Today, with Indus International School nearby, Yapral has state of the art study and sports facilities. The school is well known in Hyderabad, with students coming from various parts of the city.

Shaw's work has been widely exhibited in the United States. His work is in hundreds of private and corporate collections throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Europe, including the Bank of America, The Gap, Marriott Hotels and eBay Corporation.Excerpt from Life and work Adam Shaw was born in New York City. He has been painting his entire life and began working with oils in the mid-1970s. He was educated in the Renaissance tradition, receiving a BA in Classics, with a minor in Russian and Italian. In 1979 and 1980 he lived in Italy, in Florence and Urbino, studying art history. In 1981 he moved to San Francisco to pursue a master's degree in Poetics. Following that he became a physician and was in private practice for 14 years. He has taught workshops and lectured at numerous institutions, including Palmer College and the College of Marin. He has published a number of his own poems and has translated poetry from Latin, Russian and Italian. His work combines abstract tradition with a sensibility to the present moment that is the result of an affinity for Eastern spiritual teachings. His paintings have lush surfaces built up over the course of 3 to 5 years or more, and a luminous tension that evokes a deep emotional response in the viewer.Excerpt from content by Hiro Miyamoto at =Process= Adam Shaw in studio In his early career, Shaw would often work on a single piece over many months, spending hours ‚Äújust looking‚Äù interspersed with outbursts of painterly activity. At the time he was generally regarded as a ‚Äúcolor field‚Äù painter. However, in the 1990s and beyond he became preoccupied with dense textural surfaces and his work habits evolved to exploring the development of an entire body of work simultaneously, with as many as 20 paintings in varying degrees of process. In creating his paintings he uses brushes, sticks, rags, pouring, sanding, grinding, scraping, etc., working both on the easel and the floor inside his studio in the Sonoma wine country north of San Francisco, as well as outside where his paintings often bake in the sun. He will frequently work on a painting for an entire day, later to completely scrape off all the paint that was applied, leaving only remnants of the paint that found its way into previously gouged out areas. He works like this over the course of years to build a single painting, with its layers mostly never seen by the viewer though they impart a sense of history. Throughout the process the use of language ‚Äî written, painted, or scraped into the paint ‚Äî is actively employed, expressing poetic, philosophical and personal messages, most of which get covered over or remain as fragmentary relics. His work expands the tradition of abstraction by reliance on classical painterly techniques and a view towards the referential. He has explored numerous directions loosely referred to as landscape, flowers, trees, and work using language as an element. Adam Shaw's process involves the application and removal often of well over one hundred layers on a single painting, which may take over a decade to make, creating lush textural surfaces that retain a remarkable luminosity. His work is informed by lifelong study of esoteric western and eastern traditions evoking transformative spiritual experience.

The museum was opened in 1990, although efforts to preserve artifacts related to Australia's naval aviation history began in 1974. The museum houses aircraft used throughout the history of the Fleet Air Arm, the naval aviation branch of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), along with other aircraft of relevance to Australia's aviation history, and memorabilia relating to Australian aircraft carriers. The museum includes 34 aircraft and helicopters in its collection. It is open to the public daily, except for major public holidays. The museum building is also home to Albatross Aero Club. History The Fleet Air Arm Museum can trace its origins to 1974 when a group of volunteers associated with the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) obtained five obsolete RAN aircraft and began work to establish a museum for display of artifacts to present the story of Australian Naval aviation. $80m were raised from various sources for a large hangar and function centre. In 1990, the Australian Naval Aviation Museum Foundation was established to operate the museum. In 2000, the museum was renamed Australia's Museum of Flight and its role expanded to displaying artifacts related to Australian aviation.

Doerfler (1919‚Äì2004) helped develop the practice of audiology in the 1940s. He played a leading role in establishing professional bodies and educational standards for audiology practitioners. Early life Born June 25, 1919, in New York City to Anna (Steiner) and Gustav Doerfler, he earned degrees in English literature from New York University and Columbia, but then accepted a scholarship at the Central Institute for the Deaf (CID) and earned his master's degree in deaf education. At CID, he also met Alice Turechek, a young teacher of the deaf, who was to be his wife for nearly 57 years until her death in 2000. In 1941, Doerfler took a job at the Iowa School for the Deaf, then enlisted in the army in 1942. In 1943, the day before he was to be sent to Germany, Doerfler was assigned to be an acoustic officer at Deshon General Hospital in Butler, Pennsylvania. There, he and three others treated soldiers with hearing loss. They were soon joined by Raymond Carhart, and the work they did during the war helped lay the foundation for audiology. Establishing audiology Acting on Carhart's advice, Doerfler pursued a doctorate in audiology at Northwestern University, becoming only the second person ever to receive a PhD in this field, after which he established an audiology program at the University of Pittsburgh and served as its director for 28 years. He went on to co-develop the well-known Doerfler Stewart Test for pseudohypacusis (non-organic hearing loss). He joined president of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) where he served on the executive council, was later elected vice-president and, in 1967, president. As the first chairman of the American Board of Examiners in Speech Pathology and Audiology, he guided ASHA's efforts to accredit audiology programs. Despite his prominence in ASHA, Doerfler was frequently at odds with the establishment. He began a dispensing program at the University of Pittsburgh, despite, as he later told The Hearing Journal, \\"being threatened with excommunication or disembowelment by ASHA.\\" Academy of Dispensing Audiologists In 1976, at age 57, he left academia to start a private dispensing audiology practice in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, outside of Pittsburgh. In 1977, he and seven like-minded audiologists, met in Colorado Springs, Colorado, where they launched the Academy of Dispensing Audiologists. He was elected president and presided over the first ADA convention in 1978. He became an early leader in the movement to establish the \\"AuD\\" (Doctor of Audiology). Writing on ADA's web site, he recalled that tumultuous time: \\"My academic friends did not support the concept of the ADA and let me know at ASHA conventions and through the mail. Most are now dispensing, although none ever admitted being wrong.\\" Supreme Court ruling A 1978 Supreme Court ruling, in an indirectly related case, forced ASHA to lift its ban on dispensing, and Doerfler resumed being active in ASHA. In the 1980s, he fought to have ASHA recognize audiology as a separate profession from speech pathology, and later urged ASHA to endorse the AuD. He lost those battles at the time, but lived to see the association reverse its position on both issues. Later life Doerfler helped establish the Audiology Co-Op, one of the earliest buying groups, and served as its first president and later chairman of its board. In 1988, he was one of the 31 audiologists who joined James Jerger, PhD, in founding the American Academy of Audiology (AAA). In 1988, he and 24 other audiologists attended the ADA-sponsored Conference on Professional Education in Chicago, where the campaign for the professional doctorate truly began. Afterwards, he helped create a model curriculum for the AuD and served on the board of the Audiology Foundation of America. Recognition Doerfler received many honors and awards, including AAA's first \\"Career Award in Hearing\\" in 1994, and ADA's 1991 Wernick Award in recognition of outstanding educational contributions. ADA created the Leo G. Doerfler Award to honor excellence in clinical practice.

They would see action in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, before ending the war in Germany. It was commonly referred to as The 19th Field Regiment, The 19th Army Field Regiment, The 19th Field or by the men of the regiment, Hell on Wheels.  Canada  The 19th Field received its mobilizing orders in August 1941, for three batteries to be formed from the three Reserve Brigade areas in Military District No. 1. The batteries were the 55th Field Battery (London, Ontario), the 63rd Field Battery (Guelph, Ontario), and the 99th Field Battery (Wingham, Ontario). From September 1941 to July 1943, the 19th Field was brought up to full strength and received training at Camp Borden, Ontario; Shilo, Manitoba; Prince Rupert, British Columbia; and Petawawa, Ontario. During this time, they trained first with 18-pounders, 4.5\\" howitzers, and finally, what would become their main armament in Europe, the 25-pounder RAM, better known as the Sexton.  England  On 5 July 1943, the 19th Field received orders to move overseas. They left Halifax on 21 July on board the RMS Queen Elizabeth and arrived in Greenock 27 July 1943 and fell under the command of the II Canadian Corps.. On 19 October 1943, the 19th Field was briefly transferred to the command of the 5th Canadian Armoured Division before once again being transferred to the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division when the 5th was moved to the Italian Campaign.. Between July 1943 and May 1944, the 19th Field would begin training for the coming invasion of mainland Europe and exchanged their Sextons for American M7 Priests, which were self-propelled 25-pounders, similar to the Sexton that had an armament of 105mm and could fire a distance of 11,500 yards.Middleton, Michael. The Tools of War, 1939/45 and a Chronology of Important Events. Toronto: Reader's Digest, 1969. P. 50. While in England, the 19th took part in several training operations, but specifically \\"Exercise Savvy\\". It was the first divisional training exercise the regiment took part in, which focused on the firing of artillery on ships towards coastal targets and landing on beaches under fire.. While in England, the 19th Field was also inspected by General Bernard Montgomery on 28 February 1944, and King George VI on 25 April 1944, in the prelude to the invasion of Europe.. On 23 May 1944, the 19th Field's camp was sealed for security reasons and plans were finalized for Operation Overlord: the long-awaited invasion of German occupied France. The final preparations were made as all vehicles were waterproofed and ammunition was brought up. On 1 June 1944, the 19th Field moved to its marshalling areas in Gosport and Southampton before embarking on the longest day.. On June 3, 1944, Forward Observation Officers (FOOs) went to their respective units with the North Shore Regiment as Landing Craft were prepared to be filled with infantry units.  D-Day: 6 June 1944  The Canadian assault on Juno Beach had three infantry brigades ‚Äì the 7th, 8th and 9th ‚Äì of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division with the 7th landing at Courseulles-sur-Mer, the 8th at Bernieres-sur-Mer and St. Aubin-sur-Mer with the 9th landing after the initial assault passing through the 8th's sector and advancing on Authie and Carpiquet airfield before capturing the high ground above Caen. The 19th was attached to the 8th brigade and the 12th, 13th, and 14th Field Regiments were also involved bringing a total of 96 M7 Priest guns into action.Nicholson, G.W.L. The Gunners of Canada: The History of the Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery, Volume II 1919 ‚Äì 67. Toronto: McClelland & Stewart Ltd., 1972. p. 273 - 74. Specifically, the 19th was part of the 14th Canadian Field Regiment Artillery Group led by Lt.-Col. H.S. Griffin with each regiment firing towards the beaches from four Landing Craft towards their target of Nan Red beach.Stacey, C.P.. The Victory Campaign: The Operations in North-West Europe, 1944-45. Ottawa: Department of National Defence, 1960. p. 98. The Landing Craft carrying the 19th and the other three Field Regiments advanced at about 6:30 a.m. with the 22nd and 30th LCT Flotilla carrying the 24 M7 Priests of the 19th. At 7:39 a.m., Major Peene the Fire Control Officer, gave the order to commence firing when they were 9,000 yards out. The guns of the 19th were the first Canadian to go into action and began firing towards northern France to signal the imminent invasion of German occupied Europe. Each gun launched 100 to 150 rounds over the course of about 30 minutes further saturating the German held territory. One gun from each of the six troops were firing phosphorus shells with seven fires being started on the Nan Red beachStacey, C.P. Canada's Battle in Normandy. Ottawa: Department of National Defence, 1946. p. 50. The commander of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division, General Rod Keller, said the SP's \\"put on the best shoot they ever did.\\"Stacey, C.P. The Victory Campaign: The Operations in North-West Europe, 1944-45. Ottawa: Department of National Defence, 1960. p. 98. The Field Regiments had their M7 Priests strapped to the deck of the landing craft and went in firing towards the beaches as planes and naval vessels pounded the beaches. After they reached a 2,000 yards from shore they turned around and passed the inbound North Shore Regiment infantry of the first wave. Once the beachhead had been secured they came around again and landed with the second wave of infantry to provide close artillery support against any German counterattack. Artillery is often a feared weapon of war, but studies conducted by the 21st Army Group's 2nd Operational Research Section found the gunners were highly inaccurate thanks to the intense waves of the English Channel. The report said the 19th missed their targets by up to 1,000 yards since they were sent on the wrong course inland by the navy. Once it was corrected, the inaccuracy prevailed with the unpredictable English Channel wreaking havoc on the sights of the gunners. They were still about 700 yards wide and 300 yards deep from their intended target.Stacey, C.P. Canada's Battle in Normandy. Ottawa: Department of National Defence, 1946. p. 50. Also causing difficulty was that the concrete fortifications were between three and seven feet in thickness.Copp, Terry. Montgomery's Scientists: Operational Research in Northwest Europe. Waterloo: Laurier Centre for Military Strategic and Disarmament Studies, 2000. p. 385. At 9:10 a.m. 'D' Troop of the 63rd Battery landed west of St. Aubin- sur-Mer under mortar and rifle fire on Nan Red beach and within 10 minutes they had their first gun 200 yards inland and in action providing fire support. 'C' Troop followed shortly after with 'E' and 'F' Troop also landing and in action by 10 a.m. with the 55th Battery and Q Battery being delayed due to a rudder being damaged and massive traffic trying to land on the beaches.\\"With Canadian Units: Deadly Fire of 19th Field Paves Way for Allied Advance.\\" The Maple Leaf, January 2, 1945. Shortly after landing, the 19th took their first casualties of the war with Lt. Malcolm, the regimental survey officer, being wounded and Gunner B.T. McHughen being killed. A further two men were killed and 17 more wounded on the first day. The regiment had its vehicle damaged when a M7 Priest of 'E' Troop hitting a mine and a track was blown off with it taking two hours to repair. The 55th Battery also faced its first difficulty when an ammunition explosion had two M7 Priests and a Bren Carrier catch fire quickly spreading to other vehicles and threatening to become larger as it moved towards live ammunition. Gunner H.R. Chaplin, already wounded from shrapnel, jumped in the Bren Carrier that had the ammunition and moved it safety to prevent further casualties or damage. Chaplin received the Military Medal for this act.Zuehlke, Mark. Juno Beach: Canada's D-Day Victory, June 6th, 1944. Toronto: Douglas & McIntyre, 2004. p. 204 - 05. They ran into the German 716th Infantry Division that was primarily used as an occupation division and primarily made up of Polish, Russians, Ukrainians and other nationalities from the Soviet Union who were pressed into service. They had mostly obsolete Czechoslovakian equipment from the late-1930s, but also had a small cadre of non-commissioned officers that had combat experience on the Eastern Front giving the green troops veteran leadership.Zetterling, Niklas. Normandy 1944: German Military Organization, Combat Power and Organizational Effectiveness. Winnipeg: J.J. Fedorowicz Publishing, Inc., 2000, 297. The 19th ended D-Day in positions just outside St. Aubin-sur-Mer with them being called for close fire support multiple times throughout the day as German tanks and infantry counterattacked the positions gained by Canadian infantry.War Diary, 19th Canadian Army Field Regiment, RCA. National Archives of Canada, RG 24, C-3, Vol. 14530, 810, 6 June 1944.

Enggano Island is a small island located adjacent to the southwest coast of Sumatra in Indonesia. The population of Enggano people is not closely tracked. As such, no population estimates beyond the year 2000 appear to exist. Furthermore, the estimates from 1990 and 2000 are not in agreement. The source for the year 2000 estimates that there were 1,500 Enggano people inhabiting the island. While the 1999 source estimates that there were approximately 1,000 Enggano people inhabiting the island. However, both sources agree that the population is likely to continue decreasing. Language The Enggano language belongs to the Northwest Sumatra‚ÄìBarrier Islands subgroup of the Austronesian languages. Origin and social structure Enggano warriors in traditional war attire and Ekajo javelin from Bengkulu. The Enggano people are one of the oldest tribes of Sumatra. They were first discovered by Portuguese explorers in the early 1500s and the Enggano people referred to themselves as E Lopeh people. Ethnically, they are closely related to the indigenous tribes of Java and Sumatra, from where migration flows directly to Enggano Island. The most anthropologically related people of the Enggano people are the Batak and Nias people and distantly related to the Lampung people (Abung and Pepaduan). The social organization of the Enggano people largely resembles the social model of the Nias people and now retains the paternal features of the family. Rural communities are of a neighbor-large-family type. The main social unit is marga or merga (surname), an expanded genus whose members are descended from a common male ancestor and retain its name, usually legendary. Outsiders from other margas that came later also live in the settlement. Within the marga there are also saompu, large patriarchal families, where each of them occupies one house. A large family has land and is governed by its elder. Communities are governed by elective village councils. Depiction of Enggano islander by Dutch, 1596. It is thought that they strictly observe matrilineal exogamous traditions, where men and children of the village belong to the marga of their forefathers, while wives are taken from other marga. One cannot marry into the same marga or to a woman from the marga from which the groom's sister marries. But this is not exactly the case, as Enggano couples from the same clan are still allowed to married, provided they are of a different sub-clan. The core family unit in Enggano society is based on the monogamy marriage, as polygamy is strictly forbidden. Marriage settlement is patrilocal. A married woman passes into the family of her husband, takes on his surname, preserving it as her family name. The groom's father allocates a piece of land to his son, the child that receives the family name of his father. Modern political orientation Enggano women plays the role of the peacemaker dancers in the Enggano war dance. Today, the Enggano people; due to prolonged cultural isolation, is on the verge of extinction. They are alien to the neighboring peoples, for example, unlike the Batak people in recent decades, the appearance and growth of ethnic self-awareness are prevalent, especially among the mainstream Indonesians. Religion Among the Enggano people, approximately equal of the population professes Islam (mainly Sunni) and Christianity (mainly Catholicism). Apart from that, there are places where animism, totemism and ancestral worship are still being preserved. Traditional settlement Enggano settlements are structurally cumulus. Their houses have stilt frames, stacked and rectangular in shape (whereas the past, they were rounded), with the walls and roof are strengthened by rigid leaves. Lifestyle Enggano people engaged in manual farming (maize, yam, peanuts, taro, coconut palm), hunting for turtles, breeding of chickens and fishing. Handicrafts works are such as weaving, pottery, woodcarving, making of masks and necklaces, weaving mats and ornaments from beads. Wood carvings by the Enggano people have a very strange resemblance to those in Polynesia. Enggano men wear kain loincloths of various lengths, and the length of the kain in direct proportion testifies to the economic status of its wearer. Enggano women always wear long kain. Men's outer garment is a shirt with long sleeves and a blind collar, while women have a shirt without a collar. Enggano food is mainly vegetable, and rice is usually bought.

This piece was one of two composed in response to a request from United States President Chester Arthur for a new piece to be associated with the United States President. The words Semper Fidelis are Latin for \\"Always Faithful.\\" The piece was created for a wind band in addition to a percussion section. There is a very prominent drum solo in the middle of the piece which includes a skillful dynamic change. It features staccato notes and sharp tonguing. History There does not exist an original general order documenting the proclamation of Semper Fidelis as the official march of the Marines. According to accounts summarized in the CD liner notes, Sousa is regarded by historians as honest and on many occasions noted that the march was named the official march of the Marine Corps. However, a flood destroyed many Marine Corps records, even those documenting Sousa's rank as leader of the United States Marine Corps Band; an order designating it as an official march could have been lost. The United States Marine Corps website refers to the song as \\"the Official March of the Marine Corps\\". Sousa began as the musical conductor of the United States Marine Corps Band, known as \\"The President's Own\\", in 1880 and led the Band for five presidential administrations. President Arthur felt that Hail to the Chief was undignified and requested a new presidential composition. Sousa began performing Presidential Polonaise (1886) and later Semper Fidelis, although Arthur predeceased the latter. Neither displaced Hail to the Chief as the song most closely associated with the United States President. In an October 1927 interview published in the Independent (Nebraska), Sousa claimed \\"I wrote Semper Fidelis one night while in tears after my comrades of the Marine Corps had sung their famous Hymn at Quantico (which is now home to Marine Corps Base Quantico).\\" However, no Marines were stationed at Quantico until May 14, 1917 and he wrote the song in 1888. This could be explained by a misquote or by Marine maneuvers or exercises at Quantico.

Founder, Richard Gans was the son of a doctor from Karlsbad, Austria who emigrated to Spain in 1874 where he founded the business in 1888. After his death in 1925 the foundry was led by Mauricio Wiesenthal until 1936. In the 1920s and 30s, Gans types were sold in the United States by Continental Type Founders Association. Richard Gans' children, Ricardo, Manuel and Amalia Gans Gimeno took over operations in 1936, but Ricardo and Manuel were assassinated in the Civil War only a few months later. During the war the foundry was used to make ammunition. Amalia Gans rebuilt the business after the war, and remained in charge until the business closed in 1975. Type Design Before 1925, the foundry cast almost no original types, taking designs from German foundries, principally those of the Woellmer Type Foundry and Edmund Koch.

It was once considered extinct, until a single plant was discovered on the island in 2003. At that time, cuttings and seed were used to propagate several plants at a nursery on the island and botanical gardens in Ireland and England. The last wild surviving plant died in a landslide in 2005, making the plant extinct in the wild. Description Abutilon pitcairnense is a spreading shrub, growing tall with nodding bell-shaped yellow flowers that have long petals. The alternate leaves are by . The plant is native to unstable slopes, flowering from July to August. Conservation and habitat The plant is native to tiny Pitcairn Island (), a remote island between New Zealand and South America which is mostly known for being settled by the mutineers from . After being considered extinct for twenty years, a single plant was found growing in native forest of Homalium taypau and Metrosideros collina in 2003. Vegetative propagation, along with seed from the plant, were used to establish a small population on the island's nursery, with some propagation material also being sent to Trinity College Botanic Gardens, Dublin. A landslide killed the only wild plant in 2005, making the plant extinct in the wild. Cuttings from the Trinity College collection were taken to the National Botanic Gardens of Ireland, Glasnevin in 2007, and later to the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew. The forest where the plant is native is threatened by invasive species, with the Homalium taypau trees under competition from Syzygium jambos and Lantana camara. Chemical control of the invasive plants, along with reintroduction of native species, have had some success. As of 2011, there are plans to attempt the reintroduction of Abutilon pitcairnense to the island. There are also plans for a more thorough search of the island for surviving native plants during July and August, the flowering season of Abutilon pitcairnense. Taxonomy Abutilon pitcairnense was discovered in 1934 by two American botanists, Harold St. John and Francis Raymond Fosberg, and named after the island.

Over the years, it has been featured in magazines such as \\"Dark Spy\\" from Germany, \\"Alamode\\" and Risknote\\" from Japan, and \\"Anime Food\\" and \\"Gaku-X\\" in the USA. Spectrum-X can have many meanings, a notable one being \\"the ghost without a name.\\"  History  Founder band members Nullifer and Candy Bones met in 2004, with Nullifer moving to Italy from Chicago, USA in order to create Spectrum-X. In 2004 they released their demo CD \\"Dreambook,\\" a self-produced metal mix inspired by Halloween. In 2005 Spectrum-X began to work on their first full-length album, Tea Party With Zombies(2006), which was self-produced and released in late 2006. This album is still their best selling to date, and was inpsired by the theme of Alice in wonderland, but was twisted into a darker and more Gothic atmosphere. In early 2006 Spectrum-X also filmed a music video for the song \\"SLOW\\" from the album, directed by Pananu Productions, with Candy Bones taking the part of a darker and more gothic Alice. In 2007 Spectrum-X met Kiwamu, the guitarist of BLOOD and owner for the Japanese Record label Darkest Labyrinth. Darkest Labyrinth provided record distribution for Spectrum-X in Japan, and later a record contract. They then released their first single, Gnomes Bones (2007), including a music video directed by Mirco Andreas. The song itself is based mostly on a fairy tale theme of thievish gnomes. The video also followed along the lines of a fairy tale but the band itself were depicted as mannequins. In 2008 Spectrum-X released their second full-length album Darkest Night Ever(2008). This album's theme was a mix of Victorian gothic fairy tales, and a more futuristic second half speaking from the point of view of two otherworldly alien creatures trapped in present day. Later that year (2008) Spectrum-X was invited to tour in Japan, where they played a few shows in Osaka and Tokyo, and also made a few in store appearances. Tea Party With Zombies (New Version)(2008) was re- released under the Japanese record label Darkest Labyrinth. In 2009 Spectrum-X toured in Hollywood at The Knitting Factory. In June 2010 Spectrum-X returned to tour in Japan to promote the re-release and to help promote the release of Darkest Labyrinth's compilation CD Darkest Labyrinth: Volume 2 (2010). In early 2011 Spectrum-X decided to remove most of the electric guitar and acoustic instrument from their music to pursue their roots in electro- industrial music. On October 21, 2011 Spectrum-X released the Album \\"Black Death,\\" released both under the Japanese record label Darkest Labyrinth and also under the European record label TraumaFactor. More recently, Spectrum-X worked on a new album with their black metal project (band) which is called Abaddon, which was released in 2017.

Activism =1889= Broken Hill's first mining strike occurred in 1889 as a result of the trade union ultimatum that members not be made to work with non-unionised workers. The strike lasted a week and during this time the Women's Brigade was formed.Kearns, R.H.B, 1982. Broken Hill, A Pictorial History, Broken Hill Historical Society, Broken Hill, NSW. By the time of the arrival of BHP directors from Melbourne on 13 November, the Women's Brigade had set up as 'sentinels' in order to catch any non-union labour, including shift bosses who were 'tarred and whitewashed' the following day while the 2500 miners met to negotiate the dispute with the directors.THE BROKEN HILL STRIKE.

According to Bloodworth (1996), there were daily mass rallies and the Barrier United Females' Strike Protest Committee was formed in the initial weeks. The 500-strong Brigade passed a resolution to join the 24 August union demonstration but this was later abandoned in favour of a women's rally on the 25th.Bloodworth, S.

Between 1998 and 2018, NXIVM developed a following primarily through its personal development seminars, recruiting several celebrities and socialites. However, the organization also faced multiple accusations of systemic sexual abuse of female members by Raniere and members of his inner circle, leading to the arrests of Raniere and other NXIVM members in early 2018. Raniere has subsequently been characterized in media reports as a cult leader. On June 19, 2019, Raniere was convicted of federal crimes including sex trafficking of children, conspiracy, and conspiracy to commit forced labor, all related to a secret society within NXIVM known as DOS, or The Vow. Raniere is scheduled to be sentenced on October 27, 2020. He faces a mandatory minimum prison term of fifteen years and a possible life sentence.  Early life and career =Childhood and education= Keith Raniere was born on August 26, 1960, to James Raniere, (May 9, 1932 - April 10, 2020) a New York City advertiser, and his wife Vera Oschypko,January 19, 1931 - December 13, 1978) a ballroom dancing instructor.https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nyed.416187/gov.uscourts.nyed.416187.925.0.pdf Raniere's father recalls that Vera \\"drank more than she should have,‚Äù and in adulthood, Keith himself privately described his mother as an alcoholic. When Raniere was five, he and his family relocated from Brooklyn to Suffern, New York. When he was around eight years old, his parents separated. From the late 1960s to the early 1970s, Raniere attended a Waldorf school. One classmate recalled an incident in which she had unwittingly shared \\"compromising\\" information about one of her sisters in front of Raniere, then aged around 10. According to her recollection, Raniere had told her: \\"You know, it‚Äôs like I have this little bottle of poison I can hold over your head ... I just don‚Äôt think your parents or your sister would be very happy if I told them.\\" She claims Raniere \\"would call me sometimes and say, 'Little bottles, little bottles.'\\" Raniere attended a public junior high school and attended Suffern High School for ninth grade before transferring to Rockland Country Day School in Congers, NY; he graduated in June 1978, two months prior to his eighteenth birthday. As an adult, Raniere reported that he read Isaac Asimov's mind control-themed work Second Foundation at age 12 and credited the novel with inspiring his work in NXIVM. Raniere's former partner, Barbara Bouchey, has shared stories about his childhood which she claimed to have been told by his father, James: \\"What we did is we told Keith about how gifted and how intelligent he was. And he said it was almost like a switch went off. And suddenly overnight he turned into like Jesus Christ. And that he was superior and better than everybody like he was a deity. He said it was that dramatic and that profound; he said it went right to his head.\\" Bouchey herself likewise recalled a story about a 13-year-old Raniere's relationships with girls: \\"dozens of young girls were calling the house and [Raniere's mother] was overhearing his conversations with them where he was telling every single girl the same thing: I love you. You're the special one. You‚Äôre important. You are the only one in my life and I love you.‚Äô And she says, he's saying this to all these girls. He's clearly lying ‚Äòcause all of them are not special!\\" In 1982, Raniere graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) with a 2.26 GPA. =Early adulthood= According to reporting by the Times Union, in 1984, the 24-year-old Raniere became sexually involved with 15-year-old Gina Melita after the two met in a theater group. After ending their relationship, Melita introduced him to her friend Gina Hutchinson, also 15. Gina Hutchinson's sister Heidi told the Times Union that Raniere became sexually involved with Gina. After Heidi found Raniere climbing into Gina's bedroom window and confronted them, Raniere told her that Gina was a \\"Buddhist goddess meant to be with him.\\" Gina dropped out of school and continued her relationship with Raniere, working at his company Consumers' Buyline for a time; she died by suicide in 2002. In June 1988, the Times Union profiled Raniere, reporting on his membership in the Mega Society after he achieved a high score on founder Ronald K. Hoeflin's MEGA test, an unsupervised, 48-question test published in the April 1985 issue of Omni magazine.Morris, Scot. \\"The one-in-a-million I.Q. test\\". Omni magazine, April 1985, pp 128-132. Although the MEGA test has been widely criticized as not having been properly validated, the 1989 edition of the Guinness Book of World Records (the last to include a category for Highest IQ) described the Hoeflin Research Group as \\"the most exclusive ultrahigh IQ society,\\" and identified Raniere, Marilyn vos Savant, and Eric Hart as the highest-scoring members of the group. =Multi- level marketing career= Through the 1980s, Raniere was involved with Amway, the multi-level marketing company. Heidi Hutchinson recalled that during the late '80s, Raniere was fascinated by Amway, Scientology, and neuro-linguistic programming. Raniere also worked as a computer programmer for New York State's Division of Parole. Consumers' Buyline Inc. By 1990, Raniere founded his own multi-level marketing company, Consumers' Buyline Inc. (CBI). It was at a CBI pitch meeting that Raniere met Toni Natalie, who subsequently became a top seller for the organization along with her then-husband. Natalie and her son later moved to Clifton Park to be near Raniere; her marriage ended shortly thereafter. Natalie and Raniere dated for the next eight years. CBI shut down in 1993 after being investigated by twenty states; that year, New York filed a lawsuit alleging the organization was a pyramid scheme. In 1996, Raniere signed a consent order permanently barring him from \\"promoting, offering or granting participation in a chain distribution scheme\\" and ordering him to pay a $40,000 fine. National Health Network In 1994, Raniere created \\"National Health Network,‚Äù a multi-level seller of vitamins. That business failed in 1999. In the mid-90s, Raniere and partner Toni Natalie operated a health-products store. Executive Success Programs and NXIVM In 1998, Keith Raniere's then-partner Toni Natalie met Nancy Salzman, a nurse and trained practitioner of hypnotism and neuro-linguistic programming. Natalie recalled: > Nancy said, ‚ÄúYou're so wonderful, how can I help you?‚Äù So I said, ‚ÄúWell, you > can help me with my boyfriend.‚Äù He had grandiose ideas and his hours were > becoming erratic again... She listened and she said ‚ÄúOh that's easy, I can > help you. He's a sociopath...‚Äù They met and four days later she came out > with the glazed eyes and gave me the, ‚ÄúYou don't know who he is,‚Äù and I was > like, ‚ÄúWow, there goes another one.‚Äù Also in 1998, Raniere met Christine Marie Melanakos, a recently divorced mother who had won the title of \\"Mrs. Michigan 1995.‚Äù She recalled that Raniere \\"explained how there was a profound event that would often happen to the women who became intimate with him, sometimes they would even see a blue light... Ultimately I agreed to be intimate with Keith, and it was just as he said. I even saw a blue light, but I don't think I told him so. I remember thinking, 'Wow, my brain is really susceptible to the power of suggestion.'\\" Raniere and Salzman founded Executive Success Programs, a personal development company offering a range of techniques aimed at self-improvement.A&E; Cults and extreme believes S1E1, aired May 28, 2018, last accessed May 30, 2018, https://www.aetv.com/shows/cults-and-extreme-belief/season-1/episode-1. A few years later, the program was rebranded under the name \\"NXIVM.‚Äù Raniere \\"adopted the title 'Vanguard' from a favorite arcade game in which the destruction of one's enemies increased one's own power.\\" Much of NXIVM was influenced by the teachings of Ayn Rand, one of Raniere's favourite authors. In 1999, Raniere's eight-year relationship with Toni Natalie ended. Natalie would subsequently claim to have been the victim of harassment. In a January 2003 ruling, federal judge Robert Littlefield implied Raniere was using a legal suit to harass his former partner. Wrote Littlefield: \\"This matter smacks of a jilted fellow's attempt at revenge or retaliation against his former girlfriend, with many attempts at tripping her up along the way.‚Äù In 2002, Raniere and Salzman succeeded in recruiting members of the influential Bronfman family, heirs to the multi-billion-dollar Seagram's fortune. Sara Bronfman initially became involved, followed by sister Clare Bronfman. Their father, Edgar Bronfman Sr., took a NXIVM course the following year. =Death of Gina Hutchinson and disappearance of Kristin Snyder= Gina Hutchinson had been sexually involved with adult Raniere from 1984, when she was 15 years of age. In August 2002, Gina resumed contact with Raniere and began participating in NXIVM/ESP, according to her surviving sister, Heidi. On October 11, 2002, Gina Hutchinson was found dead of a gunshot wound to the head; her death was ruled a suicide. Kristin Marie Snyder was a 35-year-old environmental consultant who, in November 2002, paid $7,000 to enroll in a 16-day personal development course conducted in Anchorage, Alaska, by ESP/NXIVM leader Nancy Salzman.https://culteducation.com/group/907-nxivm/6048-an-espians-brief- life-.html The following January, Snyder traveled to visit Raniere, and other leaders, in New York. Snyder's mother recalled that her daughter \\"had come to believe she was responsible for the Columbia shuttle disaster\\" and \\"thought Keith was incredible.\\" Snyder, accompanied by her partner Heidi Clifford, signed up for a second 16-day session in Anchorage. Clifford later reported that on the tenth day of the course, Snyder began claiming to be pregnant with Raniere's child. In 2019, it was revealed that Clare Bronfman had claimed Snyder was indeed pregnant with Raniere's child, according to a former IT consultant.Lost Women of NXIVMhttps://www.timesunion.com/news/article/NXIVM- insiders-speak-in-upcoming-special-14871030.php Clifford recalled: \\"I was told (by a NXIVM instructor) not to bring her to the hospital. That's what makes me feel really bad.‚Äù On February 6, 2003, Snyder was last seen leaving the NXIVM seminar in which she claimed she had become pregnant with Raniere's child.https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/former-nxivm-follower-sex-cult- leader-keith-raniere-documentary On February 8, her vehicle was found 120 miles away at Seward, Alaska. Police recovered a note that read as follows: \\"I attended a course called Executive Success Programs ‚Ä¶ based out of Anchorage, AK, and Albany, NY. I was brainwashed and my emotional center of the brain was killed/turned off. I still have feeling in my external skin, but my internal organs are rotting... I am sorry life, I didn‚Äôt know I was already dead. May we persist into the future.‚Äù A separate page added: \\"No need to search for my body.‚Äù A witness at Raniere's 2019 trial testified that after Kristin Snyder disappeared, Raniere paid $24,000 to obtain the password to her email account. = 2003 Forbes expos√© = In 2003, billionaire Edgar Bronfman Sr. took a NXIVM course at the encouragement of his daughters Sara and Clare. Later that year, he would denounce the group as a \\"cult\\" in a quote he gave to Forbes Magazine. He died in 2013. In October 2003, Raniere was featured, cloaked in shadows, on the cover of Forbes magazine, accompanied by the appellation \\"The World's Strangest Executive Coach.\\" The \\"devastating\\" cover story, penned by Michael Freedman and entitled \\"Cult of Personality,\\" has been described as \\"a gold mine of previously unpublished information\\". The cover story discussed Raniere's title \\"Vanguard\\" and detailed his business, Consumers' Buyline, which collapsed amid accusations of being a \\"pyramid scheme.\\" The cover story included a quote from billionaire Edgar Bronfman accusing the organization of being a cult. Vanity Fair subsequently reported on the cover story's impact within the group: \\"People at NXIVM were stunned. Expecting a positive story, the top ranks had spoken to Forbes, including Raniere, Salzman, and Sara Bronfman. What upset them above all were Edgar Bronfman‚Äôs remarks.\\" According to Vanity Fair, the Forbes article was a turning point in Raniere's relationship with Edgar Bronfman: \\"'That,' says one woman, 'was when Edgar Bronfman became NXIVM‚Äôs enemy.'\\" A witness at Raniere's trial later testified that Edgar Bronfman's computer was compromised and his emails monitored by group members for a period of years. =2005 relationship with minor Camila= According to 2019 trial testimony, in 2005 Raniere allegedly commenced a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old named Camila. =Commodities trades= Barbara Bouchey spent $1.6 million covering losses of commodities trades which Raniere made in her name. From January 2005 until late 2007, Raniere lost nearly $70 million in commodities trading. Raniere suggested to Clare Bronfman that the losses were due to market manipulation by her father. Beginning in August 2005, the Bronfman sisters covered the losses, ultimately using $150 million of their funds in support of Raniere and his organization. =Collaborations with the Dalai Lama= In 2009, Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, appeared onstage and presented Raniere with a white scarf. Eager to distance themselves from ‚Äúcult‚Äù allegations in the press, NXIVM members sought the endorsement of the Dalai Lama, spending $2 million on the project. Eight years later, it would be revealed Sara Bronfman had a 2009 sexual relationship with Lama Tenzin Dhonden, the Dalai Lama's gatekeeper who arranged the appearance, who as a monk had taken a vow of celibacy. Amid accusations of corruption, Dhonden was replaced. On May 6, 2009, the Dalai Lama traveled to Albany to give a talk; during the event, he presented Raniere with a white scarf onstage. The Dalai Lama additionally wrote the foreword to the book The Sphinx and Thelxiepeia, which Raniere co-authored in 2009. The prior year, Raniere had co-authored his first book, Odin and The Sphinx. =Mass resignations and public allegations= In 2009, a group of Raniere's associates (called the \\"NXIVM Nine\\") broke with Raniere and his organization, citing \\"concerns about unethical practices and the alleged abuse of his leadership status to sexually manipulate women in the organization.\\" One of the dissenters, Barbara Bouchey, had been Raniere's partner for nine years. In March 2010, Raniere learned that inner-circle member Daniela had kissed another man. According to 2019 trial testimony, upon hearing the news, Raniere locked himself in a bathroom. Thereafter, he ordered that Daniela be confined to a room with only a mattress and video cameras, where she was held for almost two years. In November 2010, Vanity Fair published an article titled \\"The Heiresses and the Cult\\", in which Raniere's former partner Toni Natalie recalled that Raniere \\"had insisted she keep the body of her dead puppy in her garage freezer and look at it daily.\\" That same month, The New York Post reported on the existence of a video in which Raniere is heard telling two followers: \\"I‚Äôve had people killed because of my beliefs‚Äîor because of their beliefs.\\" In a 2010 Albany Times Union article, NXIVM former coaches characterized students as \\"prey\\" for Raniere to satisfy either his gambling or sexual proclivities. In 2011, Toni Natalie filed documents in federal court alleging that she had been repeatedly raped by Raniere. =Departure of Kristin Keeffe= Kristin Keeffe was a longtime partner of Raniere and mother of his son Gaelyn. The child, born circa 2007, had earlier been reported to be an orphan adopted by Raniere and Keeffe, rather than their biological child. In 2010, it was reported that Raniere had ordered that the child be kept away from peers and that he was being cared for by nannies speaking five different languages. In February 2014, Keeffe broke with Raniere and his group. After she fled the region with her son, an email bearing her name explained: \\"I have full sole legal custody of Gaelyn. Keith was experimenting on him. I had to get Gaelyn away.\\" Keeffe publicly described Raniere as \\"dangerous.\\" In 2015, it was reported that Keeffe had alleged that Raniere directed Canadian investigative firm Canaprobe to obtain financial information on six federal judges, a US senator from the State of New York, as well as a reporter, an editor, and the publisher of the Times Union. That same year, Keeffe further alleged that Raniere had planned to lure his critics to Mexico with an invitation to an anti-cult conference; once in Mexico, the critics were to be arrested on false charges by order of a judge who had been bribed. =Patent infringement litigation= In 2015, Raniere personally sued AT&T; and Microsoft, alleging they had infringed on his patents. The following year, the case was dismissed with prejudice. The trial court ruled that Raniere's \\"conduct throughout this litigation, culminating in his untruthful testimony at the hearing on the motion to dismiss, demonstrates a pattern of obfuscation and bad faith.\\" Raniere was sanctioned and ordered to pay $450,000 in attorneys fees. =Allegations of sex slavery and branding= Prosecution exhibit: a photograph of a DOS brand On June 5, 2017, Frank Parlato was the first to report that there was a secret sorority called DOS and the women known as \\"slaves\\" were branded with Raniere's initials, using a hot cauterizing pen. On October 18, 2017, The New York Times published a story about the slaves and branding, and reported that the slaves were required to provide nude photos or other potentially damaging information about themselves if they wished to join. At trial, the prosecution introduced a 2016 recording of a private meeting with DOS \\"slaves\\" in which Raniere acknowledged that \\"the [branded] monogram as it is right now is very directly related to my initials.\\" The group discussed how to obscure the connection to Raniere's initials. At Raniere's trial, DOS member \\"Nicole\\" recalled that when she and Raniere discussed her decision to leave the group, he said: \\"You guys think you have it so bad, but this is nothing compared to other subcultures.\\" In the wake of the article, Raniere fled to Mexico, accompanied by a few members of his inner circle. Arrest, trial and conviction Prosecution exhibit depicts Raniere surrounded by 'first-line slaves' On January 18, 2018, a search warrant was issued for Raniere's email account. On February 14, an agent of the FBI filed a criminal complaint against Raniere with the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York. In March 2018, Raniere was arrested by Mexican authorities in a luxury villa outside Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Lauren Salzman later recalled that the arrest interfered with a planned group sex session; when police arrived, she and Raniere barricaded themselves in the master suite, with Raniere attempting to hide in a walk-in closet. Raniere was indicted on a variety of charges related to DOS, including sex trafficking, conspiracy for sex trafficking, and conspiracy to commit forced labor. The indictment alleged that at least one woman was coerced into sex with Raniere, who forced DOS members to undergo the branding ritual alleged by Edmondson and others. United States Attorney Richard Donoghue stated that Raniere \\"created a secret society of women with whom he had sex and had branded with his initials, coercing them with the threat of releasing their highly personal information and taking their assets.\\" Raniere's federal trial began on May 7, 2019. Prosecution witnesses included Lauren Salzman; NXIVM film-maker Mark Vicente; victims \\"Sylvia\\", \\"Daniela\\", and \\"Nicole\\"; and cult educator Rick Alan Ross. The defense rested without calling any witnesses. On June 19, 2019, the jury found Raniere guilty on all charges after five hours of deliberation. Raniere was found guilty of: * Sexual exploitation of a child and possession of child pornography with regard to minor victim \\"Camila\\" * Sex trafficking of Nicole, attempted sex trafficking of Jay * Identity theft against Edgar Bronfman, James Loperfido, Ashana Chenoa, \\"Marianna\\", and Pam Cafritz * Trafficking for labor and services of \\"Daniela\\"; forced labor of \\"Nicole\\" * Conspiracy to alter records for use in an official proceeding * Sex trafficking conspiracy, forced labor conspiracy, racketeering conspiracy, and wire fraud conspiracy Rainiere, who maintains his innocence, is scheduled to be sentenced on October 27, 2020. Prosecutors are seeking a life sentence. Homicide speculation A number of Raniere's alleged lovers suffered untimely deaths. Gina Hutchinson was found dead of a gunshot wound to the head. Kristin Snyder disappeared and was last seen at a NXIVM event. Live-in girlfriends Barbara Jeske and Pam Cafritz both died of cancer. Raniere partner Kristin Keeffe survived cervical cancer. In 2009, Raniere was filmed claiming \\"I‚Äôve had people killed because of my beliefs.\\"https://nypost.com/2019/12/07/new-tv-special-links-nxivm-leader- keith-raniere-to-deaths-of-four-women/ In 2019, Investigation Discovery aired a documentary entitled \\"The Lost Women of NXIVM\\", speculating that Raniere committed homicide. According to that program, a woman who lived with Raniere and developed bladder cancer submitted a hair sample -- that sample reportedly revealed the evidence of dangerous levels of bismuth and barium.https://www.oxygen.com/crime-news/did-keith-raniere-poison-kill-women- documentaryhttps://www.foxnews.com/us/nxivm-sex-cult-convict-keith-raniere- neighbors-terrified-new-documentary-poisoned- womenhttps://calgaryherald.com/entertainment/television/is-keith-raniere-a- murderer-new-documentary-explores-if-nxivm-leader-poisoned- women/wcm/0023fd9b-4117-4937-afbe-0dedb7d4f2ff/ References 1960 births 20th-century American criminals 21st-century American criminals American businesspeople American businesspeople convicted of crimes American male criminals American motivational speakers American people convicted of child pornography offenses American people convicted of child sexual abuse American people convicted of mail and wire fraud American sex offenders Businesspeople from New York City Criminals from New York (state) Living people Multi-level marketing NXIVM people People convicted of forgery People convicted of racketeering People convicted of sex trafficking People from Brooklyn Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute alumni Sexual misconduct allegations Waldorf school alumni ","title":"Keith Raniere"},{"id":"31504178","text":"The Daily Quiz! was a live, phone-in quiz channel, previously a TV programme, which was showing on ITV Play (Freeview channel 35) and also on Men & Motors (Sky Digital channel 131) from 3pm-6pm seven days a week. Two presenters were in the studio simultaneously and took it in turns to answer calls, the second presenter waits by the jackpot board or front desk and is brought in every so often to chat. The Daily Quiz! had a newspaper/gossip theme running throughout the show and at regular intervals, the presenters sat at their desk, related celebrity news stories from the day's papers and discussed them in a light- hearted manner. Viewers could win up to ¬£5000 in the jackpot game. The Daily Quiz! was part of the ITV Play stable (along with The Mint and Quizmania) and started broadcasting on this channel on 19 April 2006. One of The Daily Quiz!s main presenters was Kat Shoob, who is also a presenter on ITV Play's flagship programme, The Mint. The show was produced by the same production team as Big Game TV. On 21 April 2006 weather forecaster Michael Fish appeared on The Daily Quiz!, and was the only celebrity guest ever featured on the show. On 19 May 2006, officers from the Fraud Squad raided the offices of Big Game TV, makers of The Daily Quiz!, after a BBC Radio 4 investigation for the You and Yours programme found that receptionists were told to ignore all incoming calls for long periods of time while 150‚Äì200 calls per minute were clocked up at 75p a time. The charges were later dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service. Due to this raid, the show was removed from the schedules of ITV Play and Men & Motors. The Daily Quiz! returned as a channel on 16 April 2007, on Big Game TV's channel (Sky channel 849) and broadcasts from 10 p.m.-3 a.m. On 25 April, just nine days after returning, it was announced that \\"The Daily Quiz is taking a break from broadcasting.\\" This message was then changed to \\"The Daily Quiz is no longer broadcasting.\\" Presenters *Jim Brooman *Georgina Burnett *Kylie Cushman *Matt Cuttle *Lisa Hanlon *Tommy Sandhu *Kat Shoob *Anoushka Williams Games =The Daily Ladder= The show usually started with a ladder game. They consisted of eight blank spaces increasing in value (and difficulty), ranging from anywhere up to ¬£1000. The question was usually either a missing word game. For example, the missing word game could be '_____Ball' (possible answers being 'foot', 'medicine', 'fire' etc. Alternatively, the game could pose a question such as \\"Name things you see at a wedding\\". =The Daily Bunch= This game had eight squares placed around a central title square. The questions posed were similar to the ladder games where players had to think of things associated with a particular place or event. Examples of questions are \\"Name things associated with Australia\\" or \\"Name things you might see at a circus\\". There were three answers worth ¬£50, three worth ¬£100 and two worth ¬£150. Unlike the ladder games, these cash values were arranged in no particular order and the more obscure answers weren't necessarily the ones that gave the most money. =The Daily Kidz= This was a basic ladder game but with a slight difference. Not only did it use blackboard themed graphics, school children had been filmed saying the correct answers and cheering, so when a viewer was correct, the appropriate footage was played. The questions were usually children based such as \\"Boys' names beginning with S\\" or \\"Things children do after school\\". =Over-exposed= An image of a celebrity was shown on the plasma screen with a filter applied to make them harder to recognise. The viewer must tell the presenter who they think the celebrity is. =Jackpot Game= This was played at random intervals (when a siren sounds) after right answers were given in the regular games. In the jackpot game, viewers were shown a 7x7 square grid labelled with letters along the X-axis and numbers down the Y-axis, and had to pick co-ordinates to unveil a hidden sum of money. The viewer was guaranteed to win at least an extra ¬£50 on the Jackpot Game. Prizes up for grabs were multiple amounts of ¬£50, ¬£75, ¬£100, ¬£200, one ¬£1000 and also hidden behind one of these squares is ¬£5000. When the ¬£5000 was found, a new jackpot board appeared for the next caller and the game started again. During the first couple of weeks of The Daily Quiz, the jackpot board was 8x8 with more squares to uncover; it was later re-sized to make finding the ¬£5000 easier.

History Following the 1960-61 season, Spokane Comets owner Mel Smith informed the WHL that he was considering moving his team to either Los Angeles or San Francisco. At the same time, Los Angeles Sports Arena general manager Bill Nicholas revealed that he intended to affiliate with the WHL if he could not gain an NHL franchise. As a result, the WHL evaluated both the Sports Arena and the Cow Palace near San Francisco to evaluate their readiness for possible expansion. On April 23, 1961, the WHL approved the transfer of the Victoria Cougars to a Los Angeles-based ownership group headed by James Piggott and Los Angeles Rams owner Dan Reeves. The WHL also approved a conditional expansion franchise on the same day, the San Francisco Seals, creating an all-California rivalry that would begin in October 1961. After finishing 25-39-6 in their inaugural season, the Blades improved to 35-32-3 in 1962-63, led by coach Jack Bownass and fleet left wing Willie O'Ree, the NHL's first black player. Los Angeles won its playoff opener over San Francisco, only to lose the next two games and the best-of-three series to the Seals. The Blades' breakout year came in 1963-64, when Alf Pike took over as coach. While Los Angeles finished at .500 (31-31-8), the Blades would make it all the way to the WHL finals, where the San Francisco Seals defeated Los Angeles in six games. Pike's biggest impact on the Blades came when he shifted O'Ree - who'd lost the vision in his right eye to a puck during his junior hockey days - from left wing to right. O'Ree went on to become one of the WHL's most exciting players and prolific scorers, improving from 17 goals in 1963-64 to 38 in 1964-65 and scoring 30 or more goals in three consecutive seasons in Los Angeles. But the Blades were unable to match O'Ree's artistry, failing to make the playoffs in their final three seasons in the WHL. On Feb. 9, 1966, the National Hockey League - sensing a possible merger between the WHL and the American Hockey League - awarded expansion franchises to Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, St. Louis and San Francisco for the 1967-68 season. Jack Kent Cooke was awarded the Los Angeles franchise, which would be called the Kings; the Blades played their final game in April 1967. The Blades name was revived twice - once for a short-lived franchise in the Pacific Hockey League from 1978‚Äì79 and again for a franchise in Roller Hockey International from 1993-97. The last link to the Los Angeles Blades is the Saskatoon Blades of the major junior Western Hockey League, founded as a feeder team for Los Angeles in 1964; the Saskatoon club wore hand-me-down Los Angeles Blades uniforms into the 1970s.

The program was created in 1991 by Robert Waxler, an English professor at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, and Superior Court Judge Robert Kane.Abraham, 2011 At a cost of less than $500 a person, proponents say that CLTL saves the government tens of thousands of dollars when compared with the cost of housing an inmate for a lifetime at an annual rate of $30,000. The program is said to help reduce the recidivism rate among certain segments of the prison population. Former offenders credit the program for giving them a second chance.Barker, 2010 Several studies of the CLTL program have been published. A longitudinal study by Jarjoura & Krumholz (1998) found favorable results, with lower rates of recidivism than those in a comparison, non-program group.Waxler & Hall, 2011, p. 5; Jarjoura & Krumholz, 1998 Liberal and conservative penal systems throughout the U.S., including Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Texas, and Virginia, have embraced the program. CLTL was brought to Manchester, England as part of the \\"Stories Connect\\" program run by the Writers in Prison Network.Trounstine & Waxler 2005, p. 37; Basbanes, 2006, pp. 306‚Äì312; Allen, 2011; Barker, 2010; Stephenson, 2010 The program has received a New England Board of Higher Education award for excellence and an Exemplary Education Grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. History In the 1980s, English professor Robert Waxler attended a summer seminar about literature and society at Princeton University. They discussed the purpose of literature in a technological society. What role would literature play in the future? Waxler felt strongly that \\"literature was the most important tool we had to humanize ourselves and society\\". A decade later, Waxler began to develop this concept into an experimental hypothesis. He contacted his friend and tennis partner, Judge Robert Kane, and proposed an idea: instead of sending criminals to jail who might otherwise go through the revolving door of criminal justice‚Äîsentence them to a discussion group run by Waxler at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth. \\"It was...a chance to demonstrate that literature did have the power to change lives\\", recalls Waxler.Waxler & Trounstine, 1999 The Changing Lives Through Literature (CLTL) program first began in the fall of 1991 at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, with Robert Waxler, Judge Robert Kane, and probation officer Wayne St. Pierre.Trounstine & Waxler, 2005, pp. 1-2 Initial applicants were male probationers from New Bedford who were offered the opportunity to participate in the program. If they successfully completed the program, six-months would be reduced from their probation.Schutt, 2011 In 1992, Jean Trounstine cofounded the first CLTL program for women.Trounstine & Waxler 2005, pp. 86-87; Jablecki, 2005, p. 32; Trounstine taught drama for a decade at Framingham Women's Prison. Her book, Shakespeare Behind Bars (2001) documents her work teaching female prisoners. The success of CLTL has led to its adoption in at least 12 other states. The program is also taught in Manchester, England. Requirements Potential participants, including juveniles and adults, must demonstrate basic literacy, equivalent to the reading level of eighth grade,Jablecki, 2005, p. 33 and the desire to improve their lives. In some difficult cases, the literacy requirement might be loosened to allow for motivated individuals. Although the majority of probationers have had to deal with substance abuse issues in the past, those currently dealing with substance abuse issues or convicted of sex offenses are not allowed to participate in the program. The CLTL program is considered challenging and is taken seriously by the class and its teachers. Students who are absent from class or fail to complete their homework can be sent back to jail. High attrition rates can occur in some cases. Programs In 2000, British writer Mary Stephenson modeled her \\"Stories Connect\\" group in UK prisons after CLTL.Stephenson, 2010; See also Allen, 2011 The CLTL program received the New England Board of Higher Education award for excellence in 2004. The National Endowment for the Humanities awarded the program a grant in 2003 which enabled them to create a website.Stoehr, 2005 The \\"Read To Succeed\\" program for juvenile offenders, a cooperation between the Johnson County Library, district court, school district, and department of corrections in Johnson County, Kansas, was based on the CLTL program. The library received the 2005 National Award for Museum and Library Service for its work. U.S. Senator Sam Brownback said \\"the library merits commendation for its Changing Lives Through Literature program, which has dramatically reduced the recidivism rate among probationary teens.\\" In 2007, Fairfax County, Virginia, implemented the CLTL program.Edwards, 2010 For their work, the received an Outstanding Achievement in Local Government Innovation Award and a National Association of Counties (NACo) Achievement Award in 2008.Taylor, 2010 By 2015, a Massachusetts Trial Court Grant funded program for the Girls Group, an alternative dispute resolution program which incorporated CLTL. Advocate and grant writer Shea Kiley, secured additional funding in 2016, for the continued expansion of the Girls Group allowing continued support of the CLTL model. Girls Group operates at the New Bedford Juvenile Court with leadership from probation officer Estella Rebeiro and court clinician Ann Condon. Additional guidance is coordinated with oversight by New Bedford Chief of Police ‚Äì Joseph C. Cordeiro, who continues the \\"CITY OF ONE\\" mission in this community collaboration. Books Sample texts used in the CLTL program include books tailored for segregated men and women's classes.Jablecki, 2005, p. 33; Major, 2002; Stellabotte, 2003, pp. 24-27; Trounstine, 2000 Gender segregation was the preferred teaching environment chosen by participants, including both offenders and professors.Carroll, \\"The Texas Women's Program\\" ;Men's program *Animal Farm *Deliverance *Greasy Lake *Of Mice and Men *The Old Man and the Sea *The Sea-Wolf *Sonny's Blues *Greasy Lake *A Chance in the World ;Women's program *Bastard Out of Carolina *The Bean Trees *The Bluest Eye *Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant *The House on Mango Street *Their Eyes Were Watching God *To Kill a Mockingbird *Night *Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been? Results Studies suggest that offenders who participate in the CLTL program are less likely to reoffend. In 1998, criminologist G. Roger Jarjoura at Indiana University and law and society scholar Susan T. Krumholz of the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth published a longitudinal study focusing on the first CLTL program in New Bedford, Massachusetts from 1993. They tested two groups, one in CLTL and another in a competing program group. In the CLTL group, 18% committed crimes compared to 42% in the non-CLTL group.

Dating from 1898, it is one of the oldest entities in South Florida. The USDA also refers to it as the Miami Station.Homepage SHRS The introduction of economically useful plants into the US is a three- step process: (1) explorers find the plants in foreign countries; (2) the plants are sent back to a USDA introduction garden where they are evaluated; (3) successful plants are distributed to farmers and nurserymen. Chapman Field is the original introduction garden for tropical plants. Over 20,000 plant introductions have been registered at the Miami station since its establishment. Emphasis has been on rubber, cacao, coffee, mango, palm, avocado, lychee, and other plants.Burditt History =Brickell Avenue= The Miami station was started as a plant introduction garden in what is now downtown Miami on six acres near Brickell Avenue in 1898. The six acres were provided to the USDA by Mary Brickell. There was an additional acre and $1000 provided by Henry Flagler. This was a temporary donation. The USDA did not take title to the land. The garden was begun by David Fairchild, the USDA's newly hired manager of the Section of Seed and Plant Introduction. It was the first Plant Introduction Garden of the United States Government.Fairchild 1947. p. 19 Herbert J. Webber was the first man in charge of the garden. It cost the government $3000 per year. Fairchild's next visit from Washington was in February 1912 when Ed Simmonds was the Superintendent in Charge. It was during this visit that Fairchild had his only meeting with Flagler.Fairchild 1938 =Buena Vista= In 1914 it was felt that the Brickell Avenue site was too small. After considering donations from various developers, the USDA accepted the donation of 25 acres from Charles Deering at his estate in Buena Vista. This was located seven miles to the north between NE 21st and 30th Streets on N. Miami Avenue.McGuire 2008 This land was then used in addition to the Brickell Avenue property. They were referred to as the big garden and the little garden. Fairchild was in town the day of the great freeze of February 3, 1917. The temperature recorded in the little garden was 26.5 F.Fairchild 1938 =Chapman Field= In 1920 Fairchild was visiting Miami and realized that the land boom in progress was crowding out the two gardens. He heard that there was an Army air corps training field called Chapman Field that was being declared surplus. He and his chief explorer, Wilson Popenoe, met with John Weeks, Secretary of War, who approved of the transfer to the USDA. Fairchild thought he was getting the entire 800 acres but some citizens of Miami who were as air-minded as he was plant-minded chiseled away all but 95 acres which was secured permanently by an agreement bearing President Coolidge's signature.Fairchild 1938 Over time the station gained an additional 65 acres and finally in 1947 another 37 acres for the current total of 197 acres. Starting in 1923 plant material was transferred from the two original gardens to Chapman Field. After the 1926 hurricane severely damaged the original gardens, they were returned to their donors.Loomis 1957 Ev Sewell assisted in getting the Aero Gunners' School for the Army located at Chapman Field. This base cost the government nearly a million dollars.Blackman 1921. p. 93 The field was named after Victor Chapman, the first American flyer to die in France during the First World War. On the land not used by the USDA the government maintained an airfield used by army reservists for bombing practice. During the Second World War the field was outsourced to Embry-Riddle to train pilots.McGuire 2008 Chapman Field was also the location of Coastal Patrol Base #7 of the Civil Air Patrol during 1942-1943. Chapman Field is located in southern Miami-Dade county. Its 197 acres are bounded by Howard Drive (SW 136 ST), Ludlam Road (SW 67 AVE), SW 144 ST, and Deering Bay DR. Current Work A Market Quality research component was added to the Subtropical Horticulture Research Station (SHRS) in 1956 to maintain consistently high quality fruit on the grocery store shelves. Greater awareness of tropical fruits led to increased imports and a corresponding higher risk of pests being imported. In response to this, in 1968 a Commodity Treatment research group was added to the SHRS to develop quarantine treatments to ensure that pests are imported. With the formation of the National Plant Germplasm System (NPGS) in 1980, the mission was modified from plant introduction to conservation of valuable genetic stocks known as germplasm. The National Germplasm Repository located on the Subtropical Horticulture Research Station is one of seventeen repositories in the NPGS.Homepage SHRS References ;Notes ;Bibliography   * Protected areas of Miami-Dade County, Florida Botanical gardens in Florida 1898 establishments in Florida ","title":"Chapman Field (Miami)"},{"id":"31504340","text":"was a Japanese prince.

History This institution opened in Bunche Park, Florida, serving the black students in the upper Dade County area from 1957 to 1966. Charles Wyche served as the school's only principal. Most teachers who taught at North Dade had graduated from Booker T. Washington High. The school's property consists of seventeen acres with the baseball field on the far east side of the campus and the football field on the far west side. A canal ran behind the campus. In 1957, the school only served seventh through tenth grades. An eleventh and then twelfth grade class were later added. The first graduating class of 1960 chose the mascot (Thunderbird) and school colors (royal blue and white). There was a dispute between the men and women for the school colors, so the administration took on royal blue from the men's side and white from the women's side. Prior to this school opening, students who lived in Bunche Park had to travel by bus or car to D. A. Dorsey Sr. High or Northwestern Comprehensive Senior High School. This school only graduated seven classes, from 1960-1966. After integration, students later went on to the white schools to complete high school; these schools are Carol City, Central and North Miami Senior High Schools.

History The history of Jharsa dates back to medieval times. During mughal and British colonial era, Jharsa was a paragana in Delhi subah and gurguram was just a small village. Report of a Tour in Eastern Rajputana in 1882-83 (Published in 1885) by Alexander Cunningham, the then Director-General of Archaeological Survey of India, he mentions a stone pillar at Gurugramm of a local feudal lord \\"Durgga Naga\\" with a 3-line inscription \\"Samvat 729 or 928, Vaisakh badi 4, Durgga Naga lokatari bhuta\\" dating back to 672 AD or 871 AD. Jharsa paragana passed to Begum Samru in 1776-77 and came under direct British rule in 1836 after her death when her territory was taken over by the British who established a civil lines at Jharsa and a cavalry cantonment at nearby Hiyadatpur.Gurugram plan a misdirected govt move from history to myth, Times of India. =During British colonial rule= The paragana of Badshahpur-Jharsa was ruled by Begum Samru (b.1753 ‚Äì d.1836) and she built a palace for herself between Badshahpur and Jharsa.Begum Samru Palace, Gurugram, Haryana Tourism. Jharsa was the place of Samru's principal cantonment. She built palaces at Sardhana, Chandni Chowk in Delhi and Jharsa. Parts of her fort compound have been completely lost to encroachments. Palace building is located between Gurgaon and Jharsa village, which is used as the official residence cum camp office of the district collector of Gurugram district. Built in Islamic style, the ruins of this palace survived till about 2008 in Gurgaon. Major Jean Etienne's tomb, also known as the \\"French Memorial of Jharsa\\", is the tomb of a soldier in Begum Samru's army who as a native of Bordeaux in France, presently located in a park at Mohyal colony in Jharsa of Sector-40 of Gurugram.A 200-year-old memorial in Gurugram dedicated to the Begum who commanded an armyHope for decrepit French memorial in Gurugram as official issues directions for restoration, Hindustan Times, Jun 2018.200-year-old memorial in Gurugram dedicated to the Begum who commanded an army, Hindustan Times, Jun 2018. Etienne served Begum Samru for 35 years until his death at the age of 75 on 5 June 1821. A restoration project for the tomb, to be undertaken by INTACH, was approved by the haryana government in 2018. An 1882 land revenue settlement report records that the idol of Sitla Mata was brought to Gurugram 400 years earlier (15th century). Begum Samru claimed the offering to Sitla Mata temple of Gurugram during the Chaitra month and the revenue from the offerings given to the deity for rest of the month was distributed among the prominent Jat zamindars of the area. In 1818, Bharawas district was disbanded and Gurugram was made a new district. In 1821, the Bharaswas cantonment was also moved to Hidayatpur in Gurugram.Yashpal Gulia, 2012, Heritage of Haryana. Several people from Jharsa took part in the Indian rebellion of 1857. Among them was Bhakhtawar Singh Thakran, a jagirdar who aided the Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah and was caught and hanged by the British for doing so.

In 2004, a defence lawyer likened it to an \\"Iraqi prison camp.\\" Some inmates are triple-bunked because of lack of space and overcrowding at the facility. In 2016 it was revealed that showers were used as segregation cells. The Ottawa Citizen revealed this fact and the Minister responsible, Yasir Naqvi stopped the practice. Inmates were put into solitary confinement 555 times between April and September 2015. Critics called these numbers \\"shocking\\".https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local- news/ottawa-jail-criticized-for-shocking-use-of-solitary-confinement. Due to overcrowding, the jail resorted to double bunking (the practice was banned in 2016), converting showers into cells and placing 3 inmates at a time who were supposed to be \\"segregated\\" in the same cell. Inmates in the 30-man dormitory are often denied the mandatory 20 minutes a day of yard time for over 2 weeks. In January 2016, correctional officers were within 24 hours of going on strike. The concerns raised by union members were increased lockdowns, a lack of personal and professional visits and a complete lockdown with no yard. A six-day hunger strike by prisoners occurred in December 2015. Prisoners were upset about having to eat meals in their cells due to lack of staffing at the prison. In March 2016, a special task force was formed to address issues as reported by inmates, staff, and their respective families and quickly identified 42 issues requiring significant improvement. Their first progress report was released late October 2016. The report showed 11 of 42 improvement recommendations having been complete.\\"Inmate population down 20 per cent as Ottawa jail works to improve conditions\\" CBC News 27. 2016-10-27.

They included a review of mental health training for staff and also guaranteed that inmates would be provided basic hygiene supplies. Additionally, the task force oversaw the introduction of a prisoner transportation coordinator, a daily bed usage reduction to 87%, and the elimination of bunking in showers as well as double/triple-bunking of cells, greatly contributing to relieving the general overcrowding issues. To date, the third and final task force progress report had reported that 21 of 42 recommended improvements had been completed, with realistic & measurable short-term goals set to complete the remaining 21.

The Arapawa pig is a feral breedGraham Duncanson (2013). Veterinary treatment of pigs. Wallingford, Oxfordshire: CABI. . of domestic pig (Sus scrofa) found on Arapaoa Island in the Marlborough Sounds, New Zealand. Although there are suggestions that the animals are descendants of pigs introduced to the area by James Cook in 1773 and 1777, they apparently derive from Oxford Sandy and Black stock brought to the island by whalers of the Te Awaiti whaling station established in 1827 by John Guard.C.M.H. Clarke, R.M. Dzieciolowski (1991). Feral pigs in the northern South Island, New Zealand: I. Origin, distribution, and density. Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand 21 (3): 237-247. They are known to have inhabited the island since 1839. In 1998 four piglets were removed from the island and have since bred successfully. Description The Arapawa pig has reverted to a wild type that is quite hairy and has a mane. Compared with Auckland Island Pigs, another distinctive feral breed deriving from many generations of insular isolation, Arapawa pigs are larger, and have shorter noses and tails. Compared to non-feral domesticated pigs, however, they are smaller, with a slower growth rate. They are principally sandy or tan in colouration, often with black patches. The boars weigh and the sows They have long faces and snouts, with small, pricked ears; they do not have wattles. They have wide shoulders and boars have a heavy shield. Their skin is thick and hard. While they are very alert, they do not have an aggressive temperament. The RBCS distinguishes between feral animals, landraces, standardised breeds and industrial strains of animals, using the definitions of the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy. The Rare Breeds Conservation Society of New Zealand recognizes \\"geographically defined feral livestock groups throughout New Zealand as individual breeds unique to [New Zealand].\\" , no research has been done to determine if there is a genetic link between the Arapawa pig and other domestic breeds. The RBCS lists the Arapawa pig among its rare and minority breeds of livestock with a priority conservation rating. In 2007, New Zealand Post issued a series of stamps about notable pig breeds of New Zealand to commemorate the Chinese Year of the Pig. The Arapawa pig was featured in the $1.35 stamp.

It is a colorless or white solid. It is produced on industrial scale as a precursor to polyurethanes.  Synthesis and applications  In the industrial production, MDA is produced by reaction of formaldehyde and aniline in the presence of hydrochloric acid.Data on manufacture, import, export, uses and release of 4-4‚Äô diaminodiphenylmethane as well as ... This reaction consumes the majority of aniline produced worldwide. MDA is consumed mainly as a precursor to 4,4 ÃÅ-methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI). MDA is treated with phosgene to give MDI. MDI is a precursor to many polyurethane foams. Lower quantities are used as hardeners in epoxy resins and adhesives, as well as in the production of high-performance polymers. MDA is hydrogenated to give 4,4-diaminodicyclohexylmethane, which is also used in polymer chemistry. Safety MDA is considered a potential occupational carcinogen by the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has set a permissible exposure limit at 0.01 ppm over an eight-hour time-weighted average, and a short-term exposure limit at 0.10 ppm.

History  The cellular algebras discussed in this article were introduced in a 1996 paper of Graham and Lehrer. However, the terminology had previously been used by Weisfeiler and Lehman in the Soviet Union in the 1960s, to describe what are also known as association schemes.  Definitions  Let R be a fixed commutative ring with unit. In most applications this is a field, but this is not needed for the definitions. Let also A be a R-algebra. = The concrete definition = A cell datum for A is a tuple (Lambda,i,M,C) consisting of * A finite partially ordered set Lambda. * A R-linear anti-automorphism i:Ato A with i^2=id_A. * For every lambdainLambda a non-empty, finite set M(lambda) of indices. * An injective map :C: dot{bigcup}_{lambdainLambda} M(lambda)times M(lambda) to A :The images under this map are notated with an upper index lambdainLambda and two lower indices mathfrak{s},mathfrak{t}in M(lambda) so that the typical element of the image is written as C_mathfrak{st}^lambda. and satisfying the following conditions: # The image of C is a R-basis of A. # i(C_mathfrak{st}^lambda)=C_mathfrak{ts}^lambda for all elements of the basis. # For every lambdainLambda, mathfrak{s},mathfrak{t}in M(lambda) and every ain A the equation ::aC_mathfrak{st}^lambda equiv sum_{mathfrak{u}in M(lambda)} r_a(mathfrak{u},mathfrak{s}) C_mathfrak{ut}^lambda mod A(<lambda) ::with coefficients r_a(mathfrak{u},mathfrak{s})in R depending only on a,mathfrak{u} and mathfrak{s} but not on mathfrak{t}. Here A(<lambda) denotes the R-span of all basis elements with upper index strictly smaller than lambda. This definition was originally given by Graham and Lehrer who invented cellular algebras. = The more abstract definition = Let i:Ato A be an anti automorphism of R-algebras with i^2=id (just called \\"involution\\" from now on). A cell ideal of A w.r.t. i is a two-sided ideal Jsubseteq A such that the following conditions hold: # i(J)=J. # There is a left ideal Deltasubseteq J that is free as a R-module and an isomorphism ::alpha: Deltaotimes_R i(Delta) to J ::of A-A-bimodules such that alpha and i are compatible in the sense that ::forall x,yinDelta: i(alpha(xotimes i(y))) = alpha(yotimes i(x)) A cell chain for A w.r.t. i is defined as a direct decomposition :A=bigoplus_{k=1}^m U_k into free R-submodules such that # i(U_k)=U_k # J_k:=bigoplus_{j=1}^k U_j is a two-sided ideal of A # J_k/J_{k-1} is a cell ideal of A/J_{k-1} w.r.t. to the induced involution. Now (A,i) is called a cellular algebra if it has a cell chain. One can show that the two definitions are equivalent. Every basis gives rise to cell chains (one for each topological ordering of Lambda) and choosing a basis of every left ideal Delta/J_{k-1}subseteq J_k/J_{k-1} one can construct a corresponding cell basis for A.  Examples  = Polynomial examples = R[x]/(x^n) is cellular. A cell datum is given by i=id and * Lambda:=lbrace 0,ldots,n-1rbrace with the reverse of the natural ordering. * M(lambda):=lbrace 1rbrace * C_{11}^lambda := x^lambda A cell-chain in the sense of the second, abstract definition is given by : 0 subseteq (x^{n-1}) subseteq (x^{n-2}) subseteq ldots subseteq (x^1) subseteq (x^0)=R[x]/(x^n) = Matrix examples = R^{dtimes d} is cellular. A cell datum is given by i(A)=A^T and * Lambda:=lbrace 1 rbrace * M(1):=lbrace 1,dots,drbrace * For the basis one chooses C_{st}^1 := E_{st} the standard matrix units, i.e. C_{st}^1 is the matrix with all entries equal to zero except the (s,t)-th entry which is equal to 1. A cell-chain (and in fact the only cell chain) is given by : 0 subseteq R^{dtimes d} In some sense all cellular algebras \\"interpolate\\" between these two extremes by arranging matrix-algebra-like pieces according to the poset Lambda. = Further examples = Modulo minor technicalities all Iwahori‚ÄìHecke algebras of finite type are cellular w.r.t. to the involution that maps the standard basis as T_wmapsto T_{w^{-1}}. This includes for example the integral group algebra of the symmetric groups as well as all other finite Weyl groups. A basic Brauer tree algebra over a field is cellular if and only if the Brauer tree is a straight line (with arbitrary number of exceptional vertices). Further examples include q-Schur algebras, the Brauer algebra, the Temperley‚ÄìLieb algebra, the Birman‚ÄìMurakami‚ÄìWenzl algebra, the blocks of the Bernstein‚ÄìGelfand‚ÄìGelfand category mathcal{O} of a semisimple Lie algebra.  Representations  = Cell modules and the invariant bilinear form = Assume A is cellular and (Lambda,i,M,C) is a cell datum for A. Then one defines the cell module W(lambda) as the free R-module with basis lbrace C_mathfrak{s}  mathfrak{s}in M(lambda)rbrace and multiplication :aC_mathfrak{s} := sum_{mathfrak{u}} r_a(mathfrak{u},mathfrak{s}) C_mathfrak{u} where the coefficients r_a(mathfrak{u},mathfrak{s}) are the same as above. Then W(lambda) becomes an A-left module. These modules generalize the Specht modules for the symmetric group and the Hecke-algebras of type A. There is a canonical bilinear form phi_lambda: W(lambda)times W(lambda)to R which satisfies :C_mathfrak{st}^lambda C_mathfrak{uv}^lambda equiv phi_lambda(C_mathfrak{t},C_mathfrak{u}) C_mathfrak{sv}^lambda mod A(<lambda) for all indices s,t,u,vin M(lambda). One can check that phi_lambda is symmetric in the sense that :phi_lambda(x,y) = phi_lambda(y,x) for all x,yin W(lambda) and also A-invariant in the sense that :phi_lambda(i(a)x,y)=phi_lambda(x,ay) for all ain A,x,yin W(lambda). = Simple modules = Assume for the rest of this section that the ring R is a field. With the information contained in the invariant bilinear forms one can easily list all simple A-modules: Let Lambda_0:=lbrace lambdainLambda  phi_lambda eq 0rbrace and define L(lambda):=W(lambda)/operatorname{rad}(phi_lambda) for all lambdainLambda_0. Then all L(lambda) are absolute simple A-modules and every simple A-module is one of these. These theorems appear already in the original paper by Graham and Lehrer.  Properties of cellular algebras  = Persistence properties = * Tensor products of finitely many cellular R-algebras are cellular. * A R-algebra A is cellular if and only if its opposite algebra A^{op} is. * If A is cellular with cell-datum (Lambda,i,M,C) and PhisubseteqLambda is an ideal (a downward closed subset) of the poset Lambda then A(Phi):=sum RC_mathfrak{st}^lambda (where the sum runs over lambdainLambda and s,tin M(lambda)) is an twosided, i-invariant ideal of A and the quotient A/A(Phi) is cellular with cell datum (LambdasetminusPhi,i,M,C) (where i denotes the induces involution and M,C denote the restricted mappings). * If A is a cellular R-algebra and Rto S is a unitary homomorphism of commutative rings, then the extension of scalars Sotimes_R A is a cellular S-algebra. * Direct products of finitely many cellular R-algebras are cellular. If R is an integral domain then there is a converse to this last point: * If (A,i) is a finite dimensional R-algebra with an involution and A=A_1oplus A_2 a decomposition in twosided, i-invariant ideals, then the following are equivalent: # (A,i) is cellular. # (A_1,i) and (A_2,i) are cellular. * Since in particular all blocks of A are i-invariant if (A,i) is cellular, an immediate corollary is that a finite dimensional R-algebra is cellular w.r.t. i if and only if all blocks are i-invariant and cellular w.r.t. i. * Tits' deformation theorem for cellular algebras: Let A be a cellular R-algebra. Also let Rto k be a unitary homomorphism into a field k and K:=Quot(R) the quotient field of R. Then the following holds: If kA is semisimple, then KA is also semisimple. If one further assumes R to be a local domain, then additionally the following holds: * If A is cellular w.r.t. i and ein A is an idempotent such that i(e)=e, then the Algebra eAe is cellular. = Other properties = Assuming that R is a field (though a lot of this can be generalized to arbitrary rings, integral domains, local rings or at least discrete valuation rings) and A is cellular w.r.t. to the involution i. Then the following hold * A is split, i.e. all simple modules are absolutely irreducible. * The following are equivalent: # A is semisimple. # A is split semisimple. # foralllambdainLambda: W(lambda) is simple. # foralllambdainLambda: phi_lambda is nondegenerate. * The Cartan matrix C_A of A is symmetric and positive definite. * The following are equivalent: # A is quasi-hereditary (i.e. its module category is a highest-weight category). # Lambda=Lambda_0. # All cell chains of (A,i) have the same length. # All cell chains of (A,j) have the same length where j:Ato A is an arbitrary involution w.r.t. which A is cellular. # det(C_A)=1. * If A is Morita equivalent to B and the characteristic of R is not two, then B is also cellular w.r.t. an suitable involution. In particular is A cellular (to some involution) if and only if its basic algebra is. * Every idempotent ein A is equivalent to i(e), i.e. Aecong Ai(e). If char(R) eq 2 then in fact every equivalence class contains an i-invariant idempotent.

Methodology The LCF is a continuous survey, with interviews being spread evenly over the year to ensure that seasonal effects are covered. The LCF has a sample size of approximately 6,000 responding households per year. The households are visited by an interviewer, and information is collected about income and regular expenditure, such as household bills and mortgage payments. Retrospective information on certain large, infrequent expenditures such as those on vehicles is also collected. Answers for children aged 15 years and younger are given by proxy by another household member. Every individual aged 16 and over in the household visited is also asked to keep a diary that records daily expenditure for two weeks. The diary is where the specialist food data used by the DEFRA is collected. Since 1998‚Äì99 the results have also included information from simplified diaries kept by children aged between 7 and 15.\\"Family Spending - A report on the 2009 Living Costs and Food Survey\\", Office for National Statistics, November 2010.

Throughout her professional career she has continued to study, experiment, and do research for her work. From a throughout background in Stanislavski‚Äôs approach she went on to investigate various acting methods and styles, performing under and observing foreign specialists at work, among them Ono‚Äô√© Baiko VII, George Devine, Yuri Zavadasky, Dimitros Rondiris, Jacques Charon. To modern dance instruction she added ballet, period manners and movement (William Burdick), Mensendieck, Yoga (Acharya and Hatha), and T‚Äôai Chi Ch‚Äôuan. Voice and speech training was extended to include dialect studies (Milenko Rado) and singing (Margaret McCulloch). Miss Loren has played over forty roles Off-Broadway and in stock and resident theatres. She has directed over twenty-five plays Off-Broadway, in stock, and in community theatres.

It is number 10 in the Perry Index. The fable The fable was briefly told in Classical Greek sources: 'A fox had never seen a lion before, so when she happened to meet the lion for the first time she all but died of fright. The second time she saw him, she was still afraid, but not as much as before. The third time, the fox was bold enough to go right up to the lion and speak to him.' Since the story was not related in Latin until very late, it was not included in early European collections of Aesop's fables. Neo-Latin poems based on it were written by Hieronymus Osius and Gabriele Faerno in the 16th century, while in England it was included in Geoffrey Whitney's Choice of Emblemes (1586) and the collections of Francis Barlow and Roger L'Estrange in the late 17th century. Most of these followed the fable's original Greek source in giving it the moral that acquaintance overcomes fear. When it appeared in emblem books, however, it was as an illustration of how difficult things become easy with practice, but after its appearance in Samuel Croxall's The Fables of Aesop in 1722, the story was given a social interpretation. In his long commentary, Croxall remarks that the lesson to be learned from it is of ‚Äòthe two extremes in which we may fail, as to a proper behaviour towards our superiors‚Äô, namely bashfulness and ‚Äòoverbearing impudence‚Äô. Although the proverb 'Familiarity breeds contempt' hardly fits the story as it stands, Jeffreys Taylor made it do so in a poem for children from his Aesop in Rhyme (1820).Archived online, page 3 In this the fox criticizes the lion's cold behaviour and is thrown by him into the river to teach him better manners. The tale with its three episodes does not present illustrators with many possibilities other than showing the two animals looking at each other and showing various emotional states. The possibilities of the Mediaeval convention of showing all the episodes in a composite design is made use of in the late 15th century Greek manuscript known as the Medici Aesop.Illustration on Flickr Thereafter one had to wait until the convention was revived towards the end of the 19th century. In 2011 the fable was set for narrator, horn and piano by American composer Anthony Plog. Another fable with the same moral but a different outcome concerns the camel. Numbered 195 in the Perry Index,Aesopica it relates how people were terrified at their first sight of the camel. Once they understood its placid nature, however, they bridled it and allowed even their children to ride on it. This too had only ancient Greek sources and was rarely recorded in England except by L'Estrange and Townsend. Ivan Krylov wrote a variant of the fable with a donkey, who was initially a small animal, but asked Jupiter to make him a big beast, and scared everyone until they learned more about him, and now he is used for menial work.The Ass and Jupiter, Ivan Krylov References External links *Illustrations from books from the 15-20th centuries Lion and the Fox Lion and the Fox Lion and the Fox Lion and the Fox Lion and the Fox ","title":"The Fox and the Lion"},{"id":"31505181","text":"Beat Records was an independent record label started by California night club promoter Stephen Zepeda (a.k.a.

Saravanan, who had earlier directed the Telugu film Ganesh Just Ganesh. Starring Jai, Anjali, Sharwanand and Ananya, it was produced by A. R. Murugadoss in association with Fox Star Studios, marking the studio's entry into Tamil cinema. Engeyum Eppodhum illustrates two love stories‚Äîone set against the backdrop of Chennai and the other in Tiruchi‚Äîwhich join together in the climax. The film released on 16 September 2011, to very positive reviews, going on to become a critical and commercial success. The film was dubbed into Telugu as Journey and released on 16 December 2011. Later remade into Kannada as Endendu Ninagagi. Plot The film focuses on two love stories in Chennai and Tiruchirappalli; one takes place in the period of a day, while the other ensues for months. Amudha (Ananya), a native village girl from Tiruchi, arrives in Chennai for a job interview, but her sister is unable to meet her to direct her to her destination. Amudha enlists the aid of a stranger named Gautham (Sharvanand), who agrees to take her as far as the bus stop. However, he ends up travelling with her the entire day, waiting for her during her interview, and dropping her off at her sister's home in the evening. In the course of the day, she comes to understand him and becomes fond of him. While remaining calm and reserved, Gautham reciprocates her feelings. The following day, Amudha returns to Tiruchi, where she realizes that she has fallen in love with Gautham and rejects marriage proposals that come her way. She decides to return to Chennai to meet him. Meanwhile, Gautham realizes that he has fallen in love with Amudha and decides to go to Tiruchi to find her, despite not knowing her address and other any details except her name. A parallel story follows. Kathiresan (Jai), a metal shop worker, harbors feelings towards his neighbor Manimegalai (Anjali), a nurse. Being shy and soft-spoken, he does not talk to her but continues to watch her every morning for six months. Manimegalai is bold and forthcoming; she agrees to his love and orders him around mercilessly. She puts him through several tests: having him meet her father (a policeman), her former one-side lover on his own, makes him undergo an HIV test, and gets him to agree to organ donation. She wants him to decide on the basis of all that she has put him through as to whether he wants to marry her and spend the rest of his life with her; Kathiresan responds affirmatively. The two grow to love each other unconditionally with their families' consent. Kathiresan decides to take Manimegalai to visit his family in Arasur, a village near Villupuram, and the two board a bus to take them there. Meanwhile, Gautham boards a bus to return from Tiruchi ‚Äì the same one that Kathiresan and Manimegalai are travelling in. Simultaneously, Amudha boards a bus to return from Chennai. A few glimpses of other passengers are also seen: a mother and her child, a girls' athletic team, a newly married couple, two college students who are attracted to each other, and a man returning from Dubai to see his five-year-old daughter for the first time. At a distance from Viluppuram on the Chennai-Tiruchi highway, one of the buses is redirected into the opposite lane, as one of the lanes is under construction. However, before the other bus is redirected, a tarp from a truck blows off and blocks the windshield. Unable to see where he is going, the terrified driver accidentally swerves into the path of the other bus. Both the buses collide head-on, killing about 35 people on the spot. Many others die en route to or at the hospital. Gautham sees a severely injured Amudha on the other bus, and she is rushed to a hospital. Manimegalai stays at the scene to help the wounded. By the time she reaches the hospital along with Gautham, Kathiresan has succumbed to head trauma. At the hospital, Gautham confesses his love to Amudha at her bedside, and she manages to regain consciousness. Kathiresan's body is taken away by a hysteric Manimegalai and his grieving parents. The site of the crash is declared an accident prone-area, and the film ends with a message on road safety.

The programme has completed over 60 reviews that aim to help improve individual and collective performance in environmental management by: promoting peer learning; enhancing countries‚Äô accountability to each other and to the public; and helping governments to assess progress in achieving their environmental goals. The OECD provides targeted recommendations designed to reinforce national environmental policy initiatives, bringing about positive change to the environment. Recommendations are supported by a broad range of economic and environmental data. About the reports The reports review the environmental performance of a country about every 10 years. Each cycle of the Environmental Performance Reviews covers all OECD member countries and selected partner countries. Progress in achieving domestic objectives and international commitments provides the basis for assessing environmental performance. Such objectives and commitments may be broad aims, qualitative goals, or quantitative targets. A distinction is made between intentions, actions and results. Assessment of environmental performance is also placed within the context of a country‚Äôs historical environmental record, present state of the environment, physical endowment in natural resources, economic conditions, and demographic trends. The reports are prepared by the Environment Directorate at the OECD, with the contribution of reviewers from a number of examining countries. The Working Party on Environmental Performance discusses the reports at their twice-yearly meetings and approves the Assessment and Recommendations. The policy recommendations aim to provide further support to a country‚Äôs initiatives on issues such as: greening growth; implementing environmental policies; international co-operation; climate change; energy and environment integration; coastal zone management; nature and biodiversity; waste management. Since the inception of the Environmental Performance Reviews programme in 1992, most of the OECD member countries have been reviewed twice: during the first (1992-2000) and the second (2001‚Äì09) cycle. Some OECD non- members were reviewed, such as China and Russia. The third cycle of reviews was launched in 2009, with the reviews of Japan, Portugal and Norway. In 2010, reviews of Israel and the Slovak Republic were launched and were published in 2011. The Reviews of Germany and Slovenia were released in 2012, with Italy and Mexico in 2013. History of the programme Environment Ministers of OECD member countries, at their meeting in January 1991, called on the OECD to start environmental performance reviews of member countries. This mandate was subsequently confirmed by the OECD Council meeting at Ministerial level in June 1991, and supported by the London G-7 economic summit in July 1991. The reviews identify good practices and make recommendations aimed at improving environmental policies and programmes. Work began in 1992 under the management of the OECD Working Party on Environmental Performance. The third cycle of the EPRs, launched in 2009, aims to sharpen the focus on performance and on selected issues that are of high priority in the reviewed countries. Scope of the reviews The second cycle of Environmental Performance Reviews (2001‚Äì09) consisted of three substantive blocks of issues: i) Environmental Management which covered air, water, nature/biodiversity and waste management which are the core tasks of Environment Ministries and related Agencies; ii) Sustainable Development which covered economic and sectoral integration of environmental consideration and environment-social interface; iii) International Commitments covered international (global, regional and bilateral) co-operation on environmental matters (e.g. transboundary air and water pollution, transboundary movement of waste, marine and climate change issues). Reviews in the 3rd cycle, launched in 2009 enhance policy advice and implementation by focusing on a few selected issues in each country review, while maintaining basic comprehensive coverage and accountability for the major environmental challenges. They speed up the review cycle by increasing the number of country reviews carried out per year, reducing the period between reviews of individual countries from between eight and nine down to five-to-six years. Review methodology The Environmental Performance Reviews are evidence- and factual accuracy-based, relying on sound national and international data. The approach of the reviews has given priority to: i) identifying national objectives (i.e. aims, goals, and targets); ii) identifying international commitments of the reviewed country; and iii) using of statistics and indicators to measure the achievement of targets. The Environmental Performance Review programme emphasises the use of economic analysis. The polluter pays principle, the user pays principle, economic efficiency, integration of environmental and financial-fiscal policies, as well as integration of environmental and sector policies (e.g. energy, transport, agriculture) are constant features of the reports. Preparation The preparation of an Environmental Performance Review begins with a preliminary mission by the Secretariat to the country under review to agree on the scope of topics to be examined. Some topics are standard for all countries to ensure consistency in a given cycle, while there are specific topics for each country review. The Secretariat then assembles a review team (8-10 members), which typically includes experts from three reviewing countries, Secretariat staff and consultants. Non-member countries engaged in the policy dialogue with the OECD are encouraged to participate in review missions, as observers. Preparations also include data and information gathering by the Secretariat, in co-operation with the reviewed country, as well as consultation with country desks within the OECD. The OECD Working Party on Environmental Information supports the process by providing internationally harmonised environmental data. National sources of information are also made available to team members. Review missions During the review mission the team meets with government and non-government representatives of the country under review, including environment and other ministry officials, representatives of industry, trade unions, NGOs, independent experts and local governments. Discussions focus on the evaluation of environmental performance and policy responses. Peer review meetings A draft report, prepared by the Secretariat is presented and discussed at the twice-yearly meetings of the OECD Working Party on Environmental Performance, usually held at the OECD headquarters in Paris. A full day is allocated to the ‚Äúpeer‚Äù examination of a given country. The reviewed country delegation is headed by a high level government official, usually the Minister or the Secretary of State, and consists of several members representing the Environment Ministry and other relevant government agencies. The reviewing countries take the lead in opening the discussion. All countries participate in the debate. At the end of the meeting the Working Party approves the \\"Assessment and Recommendations\\". The exchange of views helps countries better understand the issues at stake in the reviewed country and critically assess policy responses with a view to identifying good practices and challenges ahead. An important benefit of serving as reviewer is to draw first-hand experience from the reviewed country developments, draw lessons and bring ideas back home. Publications Following the peer review meetings country reports are published under the authority of the OECD Secretary-General. They are primarily targeted at decision-makers. The active role of the reviewed country in circulating the report and ensuring wide dissemination of its findings is critical to the implementation of the recommendations. The reports are also aimed at a wider audience (general public, NGOs, industry, government at different levels) in the country under review, and therefore help to achieve the third specific aim of the programme, i.e. to stimulate greater accountability of governments towards public opinion. Release of the reports in the public domain is associated with a press conference in the reviewed country with the participation of the Environment Minister and OECD high-level officials, often the Secretary-General. The press event is sometimes followed by a seminar (e.g. with Parliamentarians). The ‚ÄúHighlights‚Äù document is released to present the key findings of the review. Follow-up and monitoring Countries are encouraged to prepare progress reports on the implementation of the recommendations at mid-term between two cycles. The reports are presented and discussed at the Working Party meetings. Co-operation with other programmes Co-operation with the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) on the EPR methodology has contributed to the establishment of a \\"daughter\\" programme for non-OECD member countries within the UNECE area. The UNECE Secretariat has participated in several OECD review missions (Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Switzerland). The first cycle of EPRs has reviewed some non member countries of the UNECE, such as Belarus, Bulgaria and Russia, in close co-operation with the UNECE Secretariat. Similar co-operation has developed with the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (UNECLAC) with the participation of the UNECLAC Secretariat in the reviews of Canada, Spain and Chile. The OECD review of Chile was conducted in close co-operation with UNECLAC. Co-operation has been extended to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the Chinese province of Yunnan in the Greater Mekong region. This paved the way for the OECD review of China, which was carried out as part of the second cycle of reviews.

The plot concerns the theft of wild cattle from a Scottish borders castle, and their recovery by children helped by friendly ghosts. The novel's setting was inspired by Chillingham Castle and the Chillingham Cattle in north Northumberland.  Plot  Madlyn and Rollo live with their parents in a ground-floor flat in south London. Mrs Hamilton runs a theatre where the plays keep running out of money, and Mr Hamilton is a designer and helps people with their houses. Madlyn is very attractive and has many friends. She has fair hair, blue eyes and a deep laugh, and likes parties and sleepovers. Rollo is two years younger and likes animals and insects. He has an adopted skink at London Zoo called Stumpy. Madlyn is helpful to her brother and mother, who is usually frantic and forgets things like car keys. At the beginning of the summer term, Mr Hamilton receives a large offer from an American college (which the family needs) to spend two months in New York setting up a business course in design. The parents cannot take the children but decide to go to America, sending Madlyn and Rollo to stay with their Uncle George and Aunt Emily (sister and brother) at Clawstone Castle on the Scottish border. Madlyn is shocked at Clawstone's appearance. When she meets her Uncle and Aunt she is uncertain. George and his sister Emily wake early on Saturdays for that is when the castle is open to the public. George's hair is sparse and he wears a mustard-coloured tweed suit. Howard Percival, their cousin, is very shy, never comes out of his room, and is frightened of anyone he has not known for the last twenty years. Mrs Grove comes in from the village to help. She disapproves of how George and Emily deal with Howard. Emily prepares the gift shop. She feels sad at the thought of the rival Trembellow gift shop, which is larger. George starts preparing his work in the castle. He also feels sad at the thought of the rival Trembellow dungeons. Mrs Grove's sister comes to start taking the tickets, bringing with her what the villagers have donated to help the castle. The day does not go well; by midday only ten people have arrived, and most of them get bored. The next day Madlyn and Rollo make friends with Mrs Grove and Madlyn takes to the museum. Rollo likes the dungeon. Then Madlyn meets Mrs Grove's son, Ned, and learns about Olive, the Trembellow's daughter. Madlyn and Rollo go to Mrs Grove's house to watch TV. When they get back Emily is preparing for Open Day again. Madlyn asks why the money is so important, and Mrs Grove tells her it's for the cows. The next day Sir George takes Madlyn and Rollo to see his white cows. They are astonishing, and George buys Rollo a pair of binoculars. Madlyn, Rollo and Ned go see Howard, and that night Madlyn has an idea as to how they could make some more money on their Open Days. They have realised that cousin Howard is in fact a ghost (this is why he is so shy) and they ask him to try to find some scary ghosts to haunt the castle. Brenda the bloodstained bride, Mr Smith the skeleton, Sir Ranoulf the man with a rat in his chest, Sunita the sawn-in-half girl, and a pair of disembodied feet all help to make the castle popular with tourists. However, when the cows are stolen by two men pretending to be vets, the children go to find out what happened. Their search takes them to Blackscar Island, where an evil plastic surgeon has started a clinic where he changes ordinary animals into extinct or mythical animals using surgery. He plans to graft narwhal horns on the heads of the white cows, and sell them as unicorns.

Moriƒáa Han is a han (that is, a roadside inn) originally built in 1551 in Sarajevo, Ottoman Empire (now Bosnia and Herzegovina). After a fire in 1697 it was reconstructed in its current form. Moriƒáa Han is one of the buildings which were financed by and belonged to Gazi Husrev-Beg's endowment (Vakuf). It is the only surviving han in Sarajevo. It is located in Ba≈°ƒçar≈°ija, Saraƒçi street, in Stari Grad. Moriƒáa Han (also spelled \\"khan\\" when translated to English) is considered a true caravanserai because, when operational, it could accommodate about 300 passengers and 70 horses. Evliya √áelebi, an Ottoman traveler, wrote about his visit to Sarajevo in 1659 and described Moriƒáa Han as Had≈æi-Be≈°ir's han, because Had≈æi-Be≈°ir was landlord of the han then. The modern name probably comes from the surname of the han's tenants at the beginning of the 19th century, Mustafa-aga Moriƒá and his son Ibrahim-aga Moriƒá. However, some sources connect the name of this han with the Moriƒá brothers who participated in rebellions against the Ottoman Empire from 1747 to 1757. The citizens of Sarajevo gathered in Moriƒáa Han on 29 July 1878, established Narodni Odbor () and protested against the occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina by Austria-Hungary. Inscription from poem written by Omar Khayy√°m The han has survived several fires, most recently in December 1957 when the entire building was destroyed. It was reconstructed from 1971 to 1974 and decorated with Persian calligraphy inscriptions from poems written by Omar Khayy√°m. Stari Grad returned ownership of Moriƒáa Han to Gazi Husrev-Beg's endowment in 1998. Management of the endowment rents the han for business purposes that match the historical context, including a national restaurant, a Persian carpet shop, and religious societies. Moriƒáa Han is mentioned in the sevdalinka song \\"Vila kliƒçe sa vrh Trebeviƒáa\\" used in the movie When Father Was Away on Business, directed by Emir Kusturica.

These included Eric Clapton (Cream), Jimi Hendrix, Joe Cocker, Rod Stewart, Moody Blues, Spencer Davis Group, Traffic, John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, Brian Auger & the Trinity, Zoot Money & his Big Roll Band, The Animals, Sugar Pie DeSanto, Graham Bond Organisation (featuring Ginger Baker & Jack Bruce), Alex Harvey, Alexis Korner, Thin Lizzy, George Melly,PP Arnold and The Nice (Emerson on Hammond) Terry Reid, Simple Minds, Yes, Mott the Hoople, Buddy Guy, Paul Young, The Alan Bown Set, Goldie & The Gingerbreads, Jimmy James and the Vagabonds, Geno Washington and the Ram Jam Band, Spooky Tooth, the Jeff Beck Group (feat. Rod \\"The Mod\\" Stewart and Ronnie Wood) Chris Rea, Paul Rodgers, David Coverdale, Dire Straits, Marc Almond / Soft Cell and the Patter Merchants, etc. many of whom went on to superstardom. History =Early history= The club premises were (pre World War II) a filling station/garage, situated on the old A19 York road leading north to Newcastle and Sunderland, (the club's owners maintained a tradition of forecourt petrol-sales until the 1980s). During the 1950s a local dance band leader Tommy Reay converted the large 1st floor room, and built extensions to form an out-of-town (Stockton/Middlesbrough) dance hall, which often also catered as a pre- motorway service station for early car owners and was also, (long before the Govt breathalyser-test was made mandatory in 1967), a regular 'drinks' stop- off venue for race-goers driving home northwards up the A19 to Middlesbrough, Sunderland and Newcastle, from the seasonal 'meetings' held at York, Wetherby and Doncaster. =1960s= In 1965 the Club was purchased by a young local musician and promoter John Benedict McCoy (whose 8-piece R&B; band The Crawdaddies had been playing there since 1964) and his partner Ken Crawford. John McCoy had already proved himself well enough in promoting many accomplished young bands on 'the rise up' as early as 1963. Even booking the Rolling Stones for ¬£65 ($90) and The Hollies at his previous club-venue The Outlook in Middlesbrough. On Saturday 13 July 1963 both The Hollies and The Rolling Stones appeared on the same bill at The Outlook, In fact this was the Rolling Stones first booking outside of Greater London, and this one-off gig was actually 'brokered' as a favour through John McCoys friend, blues-singer Long John Baldry. In Bill Wyman's book \\"Rolling with the Stones\\" (a detailed journal of his time with the band) he is adamant that this booking was at a Middlesbrough club called the Alcove. However, there never was a Middlesbrough club of that name. John McCoy's explanation for this is that he wrote Alcove on the Rolling Stones contract (signed by McCoy and Brian Jones) to give the basement-club a separate identity from the 'Young Outlook' fashion store above it! An advertisement for this double booking at The Outlook appeared in the Evening Gazette the previous night. At another small 200 capacity venue,John McCoy opened in late 1966, Mr McCoys in Bottomley St, Middlesbrough, he had also booked 'Little' Stevie Wonder and The Who. During the mid/late 1960s and long before widespread car ownership amongst the young, Kirklevington Country Club proved surprisingly popular, even though its North Yorkshire village location was quite remote from local towns. Weekend nights at the \\"Kirk\\" were particularly well attended, as these were the nights the live-bands appeared. Many clubgoers would board the latest early-evening bus service there, and then rely on hitch-hiking home in groups along the roadside in the early hours. The club also operated a small 'casino' at this time featuring Blackjack & Roulette tables. However, the punitive taxation created by UK Gambling Acts of 1966 and 1968 soon made this facility unviable, accompanied with an immediate loss of revenue. Another difficulty to the club's operation was dealt by the creation of the County Borough of Teesside in 1968, the new boundaries of which extended into parts of the old North Riding of Yorkshire, including Kirklevington village. The immediate impact to patrons was that the very popular Sunday night, which had previously been licensed for alcohol sales until 12:00 midnight by the N. Riding licensing authority, was now reduced to 10:30pm by the new Teesside Licensing Dept. After this time, only 'soft-drinks' could be purchased until the club closed at midnight. =1970s= By the early 1970s John McCoy gave over part of the building ( a former vehicle workshop) to his brothers Peter, Tom & Eugene McCoy in order for them to open a small, almost 'bijou' 30-seater restaurant. After quickly establishing a very widespread reputation for fine food and winning the Egon Ronay Guide Award for being \\"Restaurant of the Year' in 1975, they then went onto open McCoys at The Tontine, which became a UK and internationally acclaimed gourmet dining venue, some 5 miles south, along the main A.19 road, near Osmotherley, North Yorkshire in a former 17thC. coaching-inn. The McCoy brothers eventually ceased their involvement with The Tontine as of May 2013. After his brothers vacated their restaurant from the club, John McCoy established a small 'bistro' dining area on the 1st floor which was primarily served by an open to view charcoal-grill facility, specialising in locally sourced steaks and salads, served with large bowls of US-style French fries. Another unique aspect McCoy introduced to the club in the 1970s, was 'imported' (and then hard to find in the UK) Australian 'Fosters' lager, which was served from ice-filled troughs, 'in the can' for patrons to activate the ring-pull themselves. This procedure was so unusual at that time, that an illustration of a 'foaming' can of lager bearing the club's logo quickly became part of its publicity material. During the late 1970s, John B. McCoy became personal manager of two Middlesbrough-born singer/songwriters Claire Hamill and later Chris Rea. =1980s to present day= By the early 1980s after extensive touring and the release of two albums with Rea, McCoy handed over his management role to Jim Beach (manager of Queen) and returned to Kirklevington to further develop his club premises. This was to include a unique New England influenced, 60-cover restaurant Martha's Vineyard Bar & Grill (1983) spread over two levels. It proved so popular that it very soon required at least 14-day advance table reservations. However, a huge new venture in Darlington, Perry's, around 1991 proved unsuccessful and eventually led to that venue and The Kirklevington Country Club, being sold in the mid-1990s. The new purchasers massively expanded the Club on the site, which meant that it lost much of its previous 'intimate' atmosphere, along with many longtime, dedicated 'core' patrons, (being before this redevelopment, a total 375 capacity). They also ceased the 'live' bands aspect of the McCoy years. The new Club premises, by now at 800 capacity, eventually failed after only 3-years, and the building was inevitably sold and demolished, for the erection of a group of 'faux' cottage style homes.http://www.picturestockton.co.uk/viewpage.aspx?id=5487 References Buildings and structures in the Borough of Stockton-on-Tees Music venues in North Yorkshire ","title":"Kirklevington Country Club"},{"id":"31505490","text":"Peter Weish (* 29 November 1936 in Vienna) is an Austrian scientist (biology, chemistry and physics), author and environmental activist.

In Switzerland after the Second World War, a French evacuee boy wants to stay there rather than return home, leading to a moral dilemma. It is the first film to feature the self-sacrifice of cutting a rope to save others attached. Plot The White Cradle Inn and its estates lie in a picturesque valley in the Swiss Alps. For generations it has been the property of the family of innkeeper Magda (Madeleine Carroll), who now lives there with her philandering husband Rudolph (Michael Rennie). The story is set during WWII, and a teenage French orphan named Roger (Michael McKeag) is billeted with the couple, as are many French children evacuated to families in the valley. When the time comes for the children to return to France, Magda is keen to adopt Roger, but Rudolph has taken a dislike to him, calling him a coward. Rudolph only finally agrees to sign the adoption papers if Magda will sign over the ownership of the Inn to him. She agrees to do this, but when the boy, anxious to prove he is no coward, urges Rudolph to take him on a climbing trip to the mountains, it is a journey that will have fatal consequences. At the summit of an Alpine peak Roger slips. He is roped to Rudi. He catches a tree on a very steep slope. When Rudi tries to get down he too slips, and is left dangling below Roger. His weight is going to pull Roger off so he cuts the rope to save Roger, instantly falling to his death.

The actors give weak characterizations, never injecting the needed emotion for the story to work. There is some good-looking Alpine scenery, but this doesn't compensate for the film's weaknesses\\"; whereas the Radio Times noted, \\"Despite Ian Hunter offering Carroll gallant support as the local doctor, the performances are slightly strained, with McKeag being a weak link. But the d√©nouement is authentic and tense.\\" References External links Review of film at Variety 1947 films British films 1947 drama films English-language films Films directed by Harold French British drama films British black- and-white films ","title":"White Cradle Inn"},{"id":"31505497","text":"Griveaudia charlesi is a species of moth of the family Callidulidae.

Like other old world wine producers, many traditional grape varieties still survive in Poland, perfectly suited to their local wine hills. The most popular varieties of grapes for the production of red wine are Regent, Rondo, Pinot Noir, Mar√©chal Foch, Cabernet Cortis, Tryumf Alzacji, Cascade and Dornfelder. For white wine production, Solaris, Riesling, Seyval Blanc, Pinot Gris, Johanniter, Jutrzenka, Hibernal, Aurora, Bianka, Traminer, Jutrzenka and Siberia are mostly used. Following the Second World War, most wineries were nationalized under the Polish People's Republic communist regime. After the collapse of communism and return to capitalism, the market economy returned, international wine companies moved back in and a period of consolidation followed. Modern wine-production methods have taken over in the larger wineries, and EU-style wine regulations have been adopted, guaranteeing the quality of the wine. Today, wine production in Poland is an industry with 151 officially registered wineries (2016/2017 season) to sell and produce grape table wines in Poland as defined by the national wine laws that came into being in 2008 and were updated later on. Some of the oldest wineries are Winnica Equus, Adoria Vineyards, Winnica Jaworek, Winnica Maria Anna, Winnica P≈Çochockich, Winnica Stara Winna G√≥ra, Winnica Mi≈Çosz, Winnica Wzg√≥rza Trzebnickie. There exists a very lively winery and viticulture scene throughout the country with especially strong grouping in the regions near the city of Zielona G√≥ra and in the west of the country, Wroc≈Çaw in the south- west, Krak√≥w in the south, the Podkarpacie region and Kazimierz Dolny in south-east. There are also a few wineries in the \\"Northern Poland\\" wine region. Winnica Jura, a new project of establishing a 6 hectare organic vineyard is currently underway near Krak√≥w. Scientists in the American National Academy of Sciences foresee significant global warming in the coming years. As a result, by 2050 Poland may have become a leading global wine producer, while vineyards in the south of Italy and Spain may disappear due to drought. History Winery in Poland was introduced during the nations founding with Christianity (see Baptism of Poland) and the first vineyards were cultivated by and wineries were established by Benedictine and Cistercian monks; however, wine at first was produced for religious purposes mainly. The fruitful time Polish winery was the fourteenth century, during which many wineries were operating mainly in Silesia, Zielona G√≥ra, Pozna≈Ñ, Toru≈Ñ, P≈Çock, Sandomierz, Lublin and Krak√≥w. Intensive development of wine making was in the age of enlightenment, when the viticulture and wine production were carried out in the Podole. Besides Vitis vinifera, hybrid varieties resistant to adverse climatic conditions were grown. After World War II, according to the authorities, two wine-growing regions were designated: the West (Zielona G√≥ra region and Lower Silesia) and the Central (along the Pilica river). Vineyards planted in the communistic economy, however, have begun to bear losses, and in the 1960s, it was focused on the production of fruit wines. The tradition of viticulture and winery has been reborn in the last ten years, resulting in development of small vineyards producing excellent wines for the local market. Poland is located in the zone of the continental climate, where there are also wine regions such as Burgundy and the Loire Valley, Rioja, Piedmont and most of the vineyards of Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia or Romania. Wine growing regions in Poland Winery in BƒÖczal G√≥rny, Subcarpathian Voivodeship * Lublin * Lower Silesia * Lesser Poland * Subcarpathian Voivodeship In the past, wine production was concentrated mainly in southern Poland (Lublin, Lower Silesian, Lesser Poland and Subcarpathian voivodeship); nowaday wine is produced all across the country.

A room in his medical institution (numbered 404) is rumoured to be haunted by the ghost of a student named Gaurav, who previously stayed in that room and had committed suicide there, which he surely doesn‚Äôt believe. A rational student Abhimanyu (Rajvvir Aroraa) now occupies that room. The seniors rag him and tell him to collect all the information about Gaurav. One day the ragging increases so much that he starts seeing visions of Gaurav. He visits Gaurav's house and brings over his stuff. He goes to Prof. Anirudh and discusses it with him to which he replies that it's just an illusion. His wife, Dr Mira, who's also a Professor at the same institute, suggests him to change his room to which Prof. Anirudh refuses and tells him to stop thinking about Gaurav. Abhimanyu starts hallucinating about Gaurav to an extent that he starts talking to him. Prof. Anirudh interviews Abhimanyu about his experience with Gaurav and how it all started.

Story  The Film was based on a novel by Rudolf Bolo Maeglin and based on the story of the real Gilberte de Courgenay (actually Gilberte Montavon), who was a servant in a hotel in Courgenay, a small town near the Swiss-French border. She served thousands of Swiss soldiers that were stationed in Courgenay during the First World War, when the neutral Switzerland had to protect its borders. Hanns In der Gand made the song La petite Gilberte de Gourgenay by Robert Lustenberger and Oskar Portmann from the Winter 1915/16 very famous across Switzerland. The popularity of this song quickly resulted in Gilberte becoming an idol for the soldats that had to keep watch far from home and their families. The film is a love story around Gilberte de Courgenay (played by Anne-Marie Blanc). In the winter of 1915/16 the artillery battalion 38 is sent to Courgenay. Initially assuming that the war will soon be over, they're disappointed when they hear that they won't be able to celebrate Christmas at home. Gilberte organises a Christmas celebration for the soldiers and so becomes their idol. Secretly, she loves Peter Hasler (Erwin Kohlund), who is upset because his fiancee Tilly (Ditta Oesch) is not answering his letters. When a colleague of Hasler has to travel to Berne with a sick horse, he finds out why: Tilly's rich father had seized all the letters from Peter because he thought that he was not appropriate for her. Tilly immediately travels to the Jura when she discovers this. She finds Peter just during the most famous part of the film: When he sings La petite Gilberte in the H√¥tel de la Gare in Courgenay adoring Gilberte. But Gilberte steps back and leaves Peter to Tilly.

This article covers its history, from the club's formation in 1886 to the present day. Foundation, formation and the early years Pilgrim Pete, club mascot, performs traditional comedic trip in front of the away fans The club was founded in 1886 as Argyle Football Club, the first match taking place on 16 October 1886 against Caxton, a team from Cornwall and saw the Pilgrims lose 2‚Äì0. Later that week Argyle won for the first time‚Äìbeating Dunheved College (now Launceston College) in Launceston (where many of the club's first members had been educated) 2‚Äì1. They played several friendlies against Plymouth United, but poor performances on the pitch led to the club going out of existence in 1894 before being resurrected in 1897 as one part of a general sports club, the Argyle Athletic Club. In 1898, Argyle F.C. produced its first rulebook. The club's ground was given as Marsh Mills, an area on the edge of the city of Plymouth, which still hosts sports. Much speculation surrounds the origin of the name Argyle. One explanation is that the club was named after the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, an army regiment with a strong football side of its own. Another theory is given by the local geography‚Äìsuggesting the name comes either from the nearby public house, The Argyle Tavern, where the founder members may have met, or from a local street Argyle Terrace. The club adopted its current name when it became fully professional in 1903 joining the Southern League, under the management of Bob Jack. Argyle's first professional game was on 1 September 1903 against West Ham United resulting in a 2‚Äì0 win for Argyle with the first goal being scored by Jack Peddie. Their first home game as a fully professional club was on 5 September 1903 when they beat Northampton Town 2‚Äì0 in front of a crowd of 4,438. Argyle won the Southern League in 1913, then in 1920 entered the Football League Third Division as a founder member, where they finished 11th in their first season. Chart of table positions of Plymouth Argyle in the Football League In the summer of 1924, a Plymouth Argyle team visited South America to play some exhibition football Argentina and Uruguay. Argyle thrashed Uruguay national team 4‚Äì0 in their first game (Uruguay went on to win the first ever World Cup just six years later) before pulling off another shock by beating Argentina national team 1‚Äì0. They then held Argentinean giants Boca Juniors to a credible 1‚Äì1 draw. Moses Russell captained the side and played in all nine matches. Russell's style of play caught the attention of the Argentine press; at the end of the tour 'The Standard of Buenos Aires' commented: A Plymouth Argyle team during the tour on South America, 1924 \\"The visit of Plymouth Argyle will be best remembered by the outstanding personality and genius of Moses Russell. His effective style, precise judgement, accurate and timely clearances, powerful kicking and no less useful work with his head...one of the most wonderful backs and one of the brainiest players ever seen on the football field.\\" In the match against Boca Juniors on 9 July 1924, the Boca Juniors supporters invaded the pitch after their team had scored the opening goal and carried all eleven home players shoulder high around the stadium. After a half-hour delay, the referee restarted the match, but a further invasion was sparked when the referee awarded a penalty against the home side. When the match was again restarted, the Argyle players had agreed that Patsy Corcoran would take the spot-kick and miss, to prevent another pitch invasion. However, the ultra-competitive Russell was not prepared to accept this, and just before Corcoran was about to take the penalty he was pushed aside by Russell who took it himself and scored. This prompted a further pitch invasion by the Boca fans and this time the match was abandoned. Back in England, uniquely, between 1921‚Äì22 and 1926‚Äì27, Argyle finished second in the Third Division South six seasons in a row, thereby missing promotion. Argyle eventually won promotion to Football League Division Two in 1929‚Äì30, when they topped the Third Division South, with attendances that season regularly reaching 20,000. Manager Bob Jack resigned in 1937, having spent a grand total of 27 years in charge of the Pilgrims. Eleven years earlier in 1928, David Jack, who began his career with Argyle in 1919 but left in 1920, joined Arsenal F.C. from Bolton Wanderers for a fee of ¬£10,890 ‚Äì which made him the most expensive player in the world at the time. He was also the first player to score at Wembley Stadium. The 1950s After the Second World War Argyle's 20-year stay in Division Two came to an end in 1950‚Äìdespite the efforts of inspirational captain Jack Chisholm. However, they were back in Division Two before long, after winning the Third Division South in 1952. The closest they ever came to playing in the Football League First Division (top tier) was in 1952‚Äì53, when they reached fourth place in the Football League Second Division, their highest finish to date. In the 1954‚Äì1955 season floodlights arrived at Home Park, but in 1956 Argyle went down again. The Pilgrim's reputation as a 'yo-yo club' continued after they won Division Three‚Äìby now a national league‚Äìin 1959. The 1960s The 1960s started with one of the most bizarre events in Argyle's history. It came in the spring of 1963, when they went on a mini-tour of Poland‚Äîthe Pilgrims were invited to play a game as a warm-up to an international cycle race. Amazingly, 100,000 saw Argyle that day‚Äîthe biggest crowd ever to attend a Plymouth match. In 1965 Argyle reached the Football League Cup semi-final, as a 2nd division team, for the first time in their history, but lost to Leicester City. But the decade ended disappointingly as Argyle returned to Division Three after relegation in 1968. The 1970s‚ÄìPel√© comes to Plymouth In March 1973 a memorable moment in Argyle's history was witnessed by 37,639 people at Home Park. Argyle played a friendly match against Brazilian giants Santos FC, who at the time were one of the best teams in the world. That day Santos also had arguably the best footballer of all time in their starting line-up ‚ÄìPel√©. However, Argyle, then a Third Division side, shocked the world with a 3‚Äì2 win. The Greens were actually 3‚Äì0 up at one stage (thanks to goals from Mike Dowling, Derek Rickard and Jimmy Hinch) but a penalty scored at the Barn Park End by Pel√© helped a Santos fightback. However, in the end they came up short and were defeated. There was a huge pitch invasion at the final whistle after a win for The Pilgrims. In 1974 ‚Äì with future England striker and Argyle manager Paul Mariner now playing for them ‚Äì Argyle again reached the League Cup semi-final, this time as a Third Division side. Argyle drew the first leg against Manchester City 1‚Äì1, but lost the Maine Road encounter 2‚Äì0. After spending six years in Division Three, Argyle finally returned to Division Two in 1974‚Äì75, under the management of Tony Waiters. This was mainly thanks to strike partners Paul Mariner and Billy Rafferty, who scored a very impressive 46 goals between them. However, they were back down again in 1977. Although the decade did end on a high note‚Äìin 1978‚Äì79 Kevin Hodges made his Argyle debut, and he went on to play 620 games for the club‚Äìmore than anyone else. 1984 Cup run In 1984 Plymouth reached the FA Cup semi-final despite being in the Third Division. After a successful cup run in which they beat West Bromwich Albion, a top division team at the time (1‚Äì0 courtesy of a Tommy Tynan goal after 58 minutes), and Derby County (the first game ended 0‚Äì0, but Argyle won the replay 0‚Äì1 at the Baseball Ground), they lost 1‚Äì0 to Watford in the semi- final at Villa Park courtesy of a George Reilly goal. However, manager John Hore was sacked the following campaign and was replaced by Dave Smith. In 2007, Argyle got to the quarter-finals of the FA Cup, but lost 1‚Äì0 to Watford at Home Park. In the buildup to this game, many pundits and fans relived the semi-final the two teams played 23 years ago. Success under Smith In 1985‚Äì86, Smith's first full season in charge, Argyle finished as runners-up in Division Three, resulting in promotion. The following season, despite being a newly promoted team, Argyle finished a respectable 7th place in Division Two, thereby only just missing the division's new play-off zone and the chance to move to the First Division (now the Premier League). In 1988 Smith surprisingly left to take charge of Dundee, making way for Ken Brown to become manager. The 1990s‚Äìups and downs In the 1990s a new face took over the club: Businessman Dan McCauley became chairman, and his first major decision was to sack Dave Kemp and appoint England's record cap holder Peter Shilton as player-manager in the 1991‚Äì92 season. But Shilton was unable to prevent relegation as Argyle finished 22nd in Division Two. Ahead of the 1992‚Äì93 season, English football had a revamp. The First Division (top tier) became the Premiership, Division Two (second tier) became Division One, Division Three (third tier) was now Division Two and so on. As a result, Argyle were still in Division Two, but it was now the third tier instead of the second. In 1992‚Äì93 Argyle finished in mid-table in the third tier, but Peter Shilton's side finished third the following campaign (as a result of playing some excellent football), thereby qualifying for the play-offs. But Argyle were defeated in the semi-final by Burnley, which saw the start of a fierce rivalry between the two clubs. The Pilgrims suffered even more disappointment in 1994‚Äì95 as Shilton parted company with the club, and they were eventually relegated to Division Three (fourth tier) for the first time in their history. Player Steve McCall became the club's manager on a short-term deal after Shilton's departure, but at the end of the season his contract was not renewed and Neil Warnock stepped in as his successor. Up, then down again At the end of the 1995‚Äì96 season, Warnock took Plymouth to Division Three play-off glory in his first campaign as manager, with the semi-final being a memorable affair. Argyle played Colchester United and were 1‚Äì0 down from the 1st leg, but won 3‚Äì1 at Home Park in the 2nd, meaning the Pilgrims were going to Wembley for the first time in their history. A header from Ronnie Mauge on 65 minutes gave Argyle a 1‚Äì0 win over Darlington at the national team's stadium. But Warnock was sacked within a year as the club narrowly avoided being relegated back to the basement division. Mick Jones became his successor, and, that season, in February 1997 Argyle participated in 'The Battle of Saltergate' ‚Äì in a 1‚Äì2 win at Chesterfield, an 88th minute fight broke out, involving all 20 outfield players. Chesterfield's Darren Carr and Kevin Davies and Plymouth's Tony James and Richard Logan were all sent-off. To make matters even worse, Argyle's Wembley hero Ronnie Mauge had already been sent-off in the 36th minute. It was the first time in Football League history that five players were sent-off in one game. The following season Argyle went down under Jones, and his successor Kevin Hodges (the club's record appearance holder) lasted three years before a failure to attain promotion (or even a play-off place) cost him his job. At this point Argyle were in danger of going bust, and it was the lowest point in their history. The Sturrock revolution The appointment of Paul Sturrock as manager in November 2000 marked a turning point in Argyle's history. He saved the club from relegation out of the Football League (they were fourth from bottom when he became manager), and finished 12th in his first season. The following campaign proved to be the most successful in the club's history, as they went on to win the Division Three title. Although, the season did not start well for the Greens after defeats against Shrewsbury Town (0‚Äì1), Watford (0‚Äì1, League Cup) and Rochdale (1‚Äì2). But Argyle's first win of 2001‚Äì02 came in style, as they came from 2‚Äì0 down to win 3‚Äì2 at Rushden & Diamonds. Argyle were then unbeaten in the league for another 19 games before losing 2‚Äì1 at Scunthorpe United. On 17 November, Plymouth faced non-League Whitby Town in the FA Cup First Round and were held to a 1‚Äì1 draw, and only just beat them 3‚Äì2 in the replay at Home Park. Nonetheless, their excellent league form continued, and promotion was sealed with two games to spare as Argyle won 1‚Äì4 at Darlington. On the last day of the season, Argyle defeated Cheltenham Town 2‚Äì0 to finish the season with a club and league record of 102 points to clinch the Division Three title. It also saw goalkeeper Romain Larrieu (and the team) gain a club record 28 'clean sheets' that season. In 2002‚Äì03, they narrowly missed out on the Division Two play-off, finishing two places outside it in eighth. That season started well for them, but some disappointing results against several teams near the bottom of the table saw them finish 16 points off sixth place. Plymouth's best result saw them hammer Peterborough United 6‚Äì1 in March. Argyle were one of the favourites to win the Division Two title ahead of the 2003‚Äì04 season, and they proved everyone right as they earned their second promotion in three years. In the early stages of the campaign Argyle were hanging around the mid-table. But a run in October saw the Pilgrims climb into first place. They thumped Tranmere Rovers 6‚Äì0 at home before a 4‚Äì0 win against local rivals Bristol City in the Football League Trophy. Sturrock's side then won 5‚Äì1 at fellow high- flyers Port Vale, and a 3‚Äì1 win at Sheffield Wednesday put the Greens top. On 3 January, Argyle picked up their joint record win after beating Chesterfield 7‚Äì0, scoring the fastest five goals in English football (after just 17 minutes). But Sturrock surprisingly moved to Southampton in March 2004, meaning Kevin Summerfield briefly took charge of the club, but Bobby Williamson was appointed manager soon after. Promotion as Division Two champions was perhaps uniquely, in Plymouth's first game under the management Williamson ‚Äì a 2‚Äì0 defeat of Queens Park Rangers in which Mickey Evans and David Friio both scored in the final nine minutes of the game. Plymouth in the Championship Argyle's first game in the newly re-branded 'Championship' (second tier) saw them draw 0‚Äì0 at home to Millwall, who were FA Cup finalists the season before. Argyle's strong start continued, and they sat top of the table ‚Äì their highest ever position ‚Äì briefly after a 0‚Äì1 win at Cardiff City. But their impressive run failed to continue as a long string of defeats followed, although they did win with a 0‚Äì2 win at Wigan Athletic (who eventually finished second and won promotion) and a 3‚Äì0 success over Sheffield United. Plymouth's biggest win of 2004‚Äì05, resulted in a 5‚Äì1 home win against Brighton in March. The club secured survival five games before the end of the season with a 0‚Äì3 win away to Nottingham Forest, and eventually finished 17th, five places (but only three points) above the drop zone. The 2005‚Äì06 season started with a 1‚Äì2 win at Reading (who went on to win the league with 106 points, and only lost twice), as striker Nick Chadwick scored in the dying moments of the game. But after that Argyle struggled, and Bobby Williamson was sacked as manager. His assistant, Jocky Scott, became caretaker manager, but his reign started with a 2‚Äì0 loss at Norwich City, before gaining a 1‚Äì1 draw at Home Park against fellow relegation rivals Crewe Alexandra. The next game saw the Pilgrims earn only their second win of the season with a 1‚Äì0 win over rivals Burnley, with veteran striker Mickey Evans scoring a 46th-minute goal. Scott's final game in charge resulted in a 2‚Äì1 loss at League Two side Barnet in the second round of the League Cup. Tony Pulis was appointed manager just a few days later, and his first game in charge was a 0‚Äì0 draw away at Southampton. It was Argyle's first point at Southampton for 28 years. That was followed by a 2‚Äì0 defeat at Sheffield United, who went on to earn promotion to the Premier League that season, and that result saw the Pilgrims slip into the relegation zone. But the turning point in Argyle's season was on 1 October, and was a 2‚Äì1 win at home to Pulis's former club Stoke City, as Hungarian international Akos Buzsaky scored a 77th-minute winner. On 17 December, Nick Chadwick scored Argyle's fastest ever goal after 11 seconds against Crystal Palace, and Tony Capaldi scored another in the last few second of the game to make it 2‚Äì0. Many believe that these two consecutive goals are the most widely separated in any football match. But Pulis gained a reputation for being a boring manager, as most of Argyle's games ended in scoreless draws or narrow wins. Argyle's biggest win of the season was a 3‚Äì1 success at home to Coventry City, and that game also saw on-loan striker Vincent Pericard score a hat trick on his full debut. Some memorable results for the Green Army that season was the 2‚Äì0 win against high-flying Wolverhampton Wanderers and a 0‚Äì0 draw at Leeds United, who went on to reach the play-off final at the Millennium Stadium but lost 3‚Äì0 to Watford. The final game of the campaign was also the last striker, Mickey Evans would play for Argyle, in a home game against Ipswich Town. With the score at 1‚Äì1, Evans scored with a header on 57 minutes to give Argyle a win. In total, Evans played 432 times for his home town club (in two spells) scoring 81 goals. The Pilgrims finished 14th that season, in the end well clear of the relegation zone. However, Pulis was on his way out of the exit door very soon, returning to Stoke to make way for Ian Holloway to join the club. In summer 2006, in one of Holloway's first games in charge of the club, Argyle played a pre-season friendly against nine-time European champions Real Madrid in Austria, as both clubs were training in the country at the time. Argyle, captained by Hasney Aljofree, but up a brave fight and only lost 1‚Äì0, courtesy of a 75th-minute penalty converted by Brazilian international J√∫lio Baptista. Madrid were managed by future England manager Fabio Capello and they had Iv√°n Helguera, Guti, Antonio Cassano, Ra√∫l Bravo, Thomas Gravesen and Javier Portillo in their starting line-up. The official Plymouth Argyle website said that it was 'a proud day for anyone with green in their heart'. In late 2006, Viz magazine published a one-off comic strip, \\"The Pirates of Plymouth Argyle\\", depicting Plymouth Argyle as a shipload of 18th- century pirates. Several of the characters in this strip were given the names of then-current players on the real Plymouth Argyle team. Ian Holloway's first competitive game in charge was a 1‚Äì1 draw at home to Wolves, with striker Barry Hayles scoring a debut goal. A win at Sunderland soon followed, as the Green Army travelled the longest distance to an away game that season, and despite going 1‚Äì0 down after just 30 seconds, Nick Chadwick scored nine minutes from time to give the Pilgrims a 2‚Äì3 win. On 12 September, Cardiff City visited Home Park, and despite being 3‚Äì0 down after 49 minutes, Argyle came back to draw 3‚Äì3. Plymouth's strong start to the 2006‚Äì07 Championship campaign continued, and they were soon looking capable of qualifying for the play-off. The January transfer window saw considerable activity in the transfer market with the arrival of Hungarians Kriszti√°n Tim√°r and P√©ter Halmosi (initially on loan but both signed permanently in May 2007 as part of an option to buy arrangement), the signing of Rory Fallon from Swansea City, and Kevin Gallen and Scott Sinclair on loan from Queens Park Rangers and Chelsea respectively. But their form dipped in the second half of the season‚Äìafter they finished February in 12th place, a wide gap opened up between them and the teams in the top six, making their promotion bid more difficult than it had appeared earlier in the season. Despite this disappointment, the team made significantly better progress than in recent seasons in the FA Cup, reaching the quarter-finals. They beat League Two Peterborough United at the second attempt in the third round, then a solo-goal from on-loan youngster Scott Sinclair (which was officially voted 'goal of the round') helped them to a 2‚Äì0 win at Barnet in the fourth round. They beat Championship league leaders Derby County 2‚Äì0 in the next, but in the quarter finals, they were drawn at home to Premier League strugglers Watford and lost out to a Hameur Bouazza strike against the run of play. After a run of five consecutive wins, Argyle finished the 2006‚Äì07 in 11th place, their highest league finish for 20 years. Crystal Palace in 2008, which was scored by Paul Gallagher Before the start of the 2007‚Äì08 season, manager Ian Holloway said that Plymouth were capable of earning promotion to the Premier League for the first time in their history, and they made a good start to the new season with a 2‚Äì3 win at Hull City (who actually went on to win the play-offs). The club's good start continued as they stayed near the play-off places for the first few months. However, on 21 November 2007 Ian Holloway controversially resigned to take charge of Leicester City. Sturrock returns On 27 November 2007, Paul Sturrock resigned from Swindon Town to rejoin Plymouth Argyle. His first game back resulted in a 3‚Äì0 win against Scunthorpe United. Sturrock arrived at a time where many key players were being approached by other clubs. Sturrock could do nothing to stop Sylvan Ebanks Blake, David Norris and youngster Dan Gosling leave for Wolves, Ipswich and Everton respectively. The January 2008 transfer window marked an important point in the recent history of the club. On 9 February, the Green Army went to the Walkers Stadium to face Holloway's Leicester (the game was also live on Sky Sports). To add some more 'spice' to the game, Argyle chairman Paul Stapleton accused Holloway of luring some of the club's star players away, and both sets of fans wore Holloway T-shirts, with 'Holloway is a liar' and other slogans written on some of the Argyle fans' shirts. Anti-Holloway chants could be heard from the away end constantly, and a goal from Peter Halmosi on 34 minutes gave the Pilgrims a 0‚Äì1 win. Leicester were eventually relegated on the final day of the season, with Holloway being sacked. That victory was followed with a good run of form for Argyle, including a 1‚Äì2 win away at local rivals Bristol City, with Rory Fallon scoring twice. But Argyle only won one of their final seven games, meaning that they missed out on the play-offs but finished 10th‚Äìcontinuing the club's unprecedented record of improving their league position every season since the turn of the millennium. In the FA Cup 2007-08, despite losing 2‚Äì1 at Fratton Park in the fourth round, Argyle had the honour of being the only team to score against Portsmouth, the eventual winners. With many more of the team's key players leaving Home Park during the summer of 2008, the following season promised to be a challenging one for the club. The Pilgrims began the season with a string of poor results, but a 2‚Äì1 win at Watford in mid- September sparked a good run of form for Argyle as Sturrock's new side began to come together. The Scottish manager celebrated his 100th win in charge of the club (from two spells) with a 4‚Äì0 thrashing of former club Sheffield Wednesday at Home Park. It was starting to look as if Argyle would put in another challenge for the play-offs, but consistency proved to be a problem. A 0‚Äì0 draw at struggling Southampton started an awful run for Argyle, and they finished 2008 in 15th place‚Äìnow 8 points adrift of the play-offs. On 3 January 2009, Argyle travelled to the recently built Emirates Stadium to play against Premiership giants Arsenal in the FA Cup Third Round. Arsenal scored two quick goals after the break, but Karl Duguid scored after 53 minutes to pull one back for the Greens. But Gunners striker Robin Van Persie scored his second of the game five minutes from time to give Arsenal a 3‚Äì1 win. Argyle's league form then plummeted throughout the early stages of the new year, and they had to wait nine league games into 2009 to get their first win of the year ‚Äì and it was an extremely important one as well, as it was a 1‚Äì0 success at eventual league winners Wolves. On loan Blackburn Rovers midfielder Paul Gallagher scored the only goal after just 44 seconds with an overhead kick. That was followed by a 2‚Äì1 win at home to Watford, with Gallagher scoring twice. Although Argyle couldn't keep up their revival for long as a run of 3 consecutive defeats put them in serious danger of relegation. But a late goal from defender Gary Sawyer gave them a crucial 1‚Äì0 win at fellow struggler's Blackpool, and that was followed by a 4‚Äì0 win against Coventry City (all four goals came in the first half), which looked to have secured survival. Plymouth then picked up a 1‚Äì1 draw at Birmingham, who ended up getting promoted, but a 3‚Äì0 home loss against Doncaster put Argyle right back in danger of relegation. But after a 0‚Äì0 draw at QPR and Norwich's failure to beat Reading (two games before the end of the season), Argyle's survival was confirmed. The club finished 21st in the league table, five points and one place clear of the relegation places‚ÄìArgyle's first season where they didn't improve their league position for eight years. At a packed press conference on 2 July 2009, Sir Roy Gardner took over the chairman's role with Keith Todd CBE, Yasuaki Kagami and George Synan appointed as board directors.The New Chairman Argyle scored just five minutes into the 2009‚Äì10 season, with Krisztian Timar heading home at Crystal Palace, but the match finished 1‚Äì1. A last minute own goal from Kaspars Gork≈°s gave them another 1‚Äì1 draw at home to QPR in their next game. But Argyle then went on a run of seven consecutive losses, despite putting in some decent performances. However, their effort was rewarded on 29 September after a 2‚Äì1 win at newly promoted Peterborough United, and that was followed with another 2‚Äì1 success, this time against Scunthorpe United. Former player Paul Mariner was appointed the club's head coach in late October, after assistant manager Kevin Summerfield left when told that his current contract would not be renewed. Mariner's first game on the sidelines was at home to one of his other former clubs, Ipswich Town, and resulted in a 1‚Äì1 draw. That was followed by a shock 0‚Äì1 win at promotion chasing Middlesbrough, in Gordon Strachan's first game as Boro manager, with Jamie Mackie scoring a 64th-minute goal, and a 2‚Äì1 home win over Doncaster Rovers with goals from on-loan midfielder Alan Judge and Rory Fallon, both getting their third goals of the season. Sturrock moves upstairs, Mariner takes charge Mariner during his tenure as manager of Plymouth Argyle, pictured in 2010. Paul Sturrock's second stint in charge came to an end on 10 December 2009, when a press conference confirmed he was relieved of his managerial duties due to two years of poor results and fan unrest and had taken up a 'business-support' role, working alongside Director and Chief Executive, Keith Todd. Head Coach Paul Mariner was placed in charge of team affairs. Sturrock's last game in charge was a 1‚Äì0 defeat at Swansea City on 8 December. However, Mariner lost his first two games‚Äìhis first fixture resulted in a 2‚Äì0 loss at Preston North End and then Argyle were defeated 1‚Äì0 at home to Coventry, leaving the Pilgrims bottom of the table and six points adrift of safety. On Boxing day, Argyle were away at local rivals Cardiff City, and it was the first meeting between the sides at the new Cardiff City Stadium. Cardiff were fourth in the table at the time while Argyle were bottom, but full-back Gary Sawyer scored an 84th-minute winner to give the visitors a shock 0‚Äì1 victory. Two days later, Argyle thrashed relegation rivals Reading 4‚Äì1 at Home Park to go two points adrift of safety. The Pilgim's first game of 2010 was at home to Championship league leaders Newcastle United in the third round of the FA Cup. The game ended 0‚Äì0, but Newcastle won 3‚Äì0 in the replay. Victor Moses found the back of the net as Crystal Palace won 0‚Äì1 at Home Park. Striker Jamie Mackie scored an 82nd- minute winner to give Argyle a 1‚Äì0 victory at home to fellow strugglers Derby in mid-week. Days later, Argyle went 0‚Äì1 up away at Sheffield Wednesday, another side in relegation danger, but went on to lose 2‚Äì1. They then lost 0‚Äì1 against second place West Bromwich Albion, however new loan signing David Stockdale did save a late penalty to restore some pride for Argyle. But Stockdale, on loan from Fulham, was unable to save Shane Long's last-gasp spot kick at the Madejski Stadium, as the Pilgrims lost 2‚Äì1 at relegation rivals Reading. That result meant Argyle were eight points off safety. However, The Pilgrims travelled to face Barnsley in their next game, which proved to be a memorable one for the Green Army. Hugo Colace gave Barnsley the lead just before half-time, but Argyle responded well in the second period, and on 64 minutes team captain Carl Fletcher equalised with a strike from just inside the box. Ten minutes later, Jamie Mackie fired the visitors in front, and with 83 minutes on the clock, Rory Fallon scored with a lob from out to give Argyle a 1‚Äì3 win at Oakwell. It was the first time Argyle came from behind to win a game since Boxing day 2007, when the Greens beat QPR 2‚Äì1 at Home Park. It was also the first time they won by two goals or more away from home since 19 February 2008, when Argyle won 0‚Äì2 at Southampton. Yala Bolasie‚Äìmaking his Argyle debut after a season on loan at Barnet, was given the man of the match award. January signing Damien Johnson scored his first Argyle goal just days later in a 1‚Äì1 draw at home to Swansea, however it proved to be controversial. With the hosts trailing through Darren Pratley's sublime 46th-minute goal, they were awarded a penalty five minutes from time. Jamie Mackie took it, but it was well saved by Dorus de Vries. The Devon linesman ordered the spot kick to be re-taken. Johnson took it this time, but yet again de Vries was equal to it, but Johnson converted the rebound. In their next game, Craig Noone's 39th- minute header cancelled out Kari Arnason's own goal seven minutes earlier as the Greens came from behind to get a result for the third game in a row after drawing 1‚Äì1 with Leicester City. But the Greens' good run failed to continue after an unlucky 4‚Äì3 defeat at Sheffield United (Argyle were 3‚Äì0 down before coming back to 3‚Äì2, but then went 4‚Äì2 down before the game finished 4‚Äì3), a 1‚Äì1 draw at home to Preston North End and a 2‚Äì0 loss at fellow strugglers Queens Park Rangers. But on 17 March, Argyle picked up a crucial three points with a thrilling 3‚Äì2 win over local rivals Bristol City. The Greens were 2‚Äì0 up at half-time through Chris Clark (with his first ever league goal for the club) and Bradley Wright-Phillips (with his first ever goal for the club), but two Nicky Maynard strikes made it 2‚Äì2. When it looked like Argyle were heading for another draw (or even a defeat), team captain Carl Fletcher struck in the first minute of injury time to give Argyle a sweet 3‚Äì2 win. Yet again, Argyle's run was halted after a 2‚Äì1 defeat at fellow strugglers Scunthorpe United, but they then impressively won 0‚Äì2 away at Ipswich thanks to goals from Bradley Wright-Phillips and Joe Mason to move within three points of safety. However, despite a 1‚Äì2 win at high-flying Doncaster Rovers, defeats to Middlesbrough (0‚Äì2), Watford (1‚Äì0) and Newcastle United (0‚Äì2) sealed their relegation fate (whilst simultaneously allowing Newcastle to claim the Championship title) with two games to go. Argyle then went on to lose their remaining two games; away to Nottingham Forest and Peterborough United. Argyle ended the season as the second lowest scoring team in the division, with only Swansea City scoring fewer, as well as winning the fewest games at home. The club's six-year stay in the second tier of the Football League was over. Peter Reid and Decline On 24 June 2010, former England midfielder Peter Reid was appointed manager for the forthcoming season. Peter Reid's career at Argyle got off to a good start as his team beat title favourites Southampton at St Mary's Stadium on the opening day of the season. Argyle won the game 0‚Äì1 with Luke Summerfield scoring a 47th-minute winner. Throughout the late summer and Autumn a trend of strong away performances and poor home performances began to appear. The Pilgrims won 2‚Äì3 away to Swindon on 28 September, in a game where they led 0‚Äì2, before Swindon pulled it back to 2‚Äì2, then Bradley Wright-Phillips scored his second of the game to give Argyle a 2‚Äì3 injury time win. However, in the same week, they lost 0‚Äì1 at home to Hartlepool United, and that meant that Argyle had lost four of their first six matches at home. Argyle's season was lacking consistency. This was summed up by Argyle's 3‚Äì1 home win against local rivals Bristol Rovers on 2 November 2010 followed by four straight defeats, one of which included a 1‚Äì2 injury time loss to bitter rivals Exeter City in the Football League Trophy area quarter-final. That was the first meeting between the sides in eight years, with Argyle winning the last fixture 3‚Äì0 at Home Park in February 2002. On 20 November, following a 1‚Äì2 home defeat to Brentford, newly relegated Argyle were 20th in League One, just one place and three points above the relegation zone. On 23 November, Argyle came from 0‚Äì1 down to beat fellow strugglers Dagenham & Redbridge 2‚Äì1 at Home Park, lifting them up to 15th. However, just 4,960 were present at the game. That was Argyle's lowest league attendance since they were in the bottom tier. Not long after, the Pilgrims were presented with a winding-up order by HMRC and appeared in court on 8 December, only to earn a 63-day adjournment so they could pay the taxes they owed. Three days later, after their financial incident, Argyle picked up a memorable victory ‚Äì arguably their best performance of the season resulted in them beating fierce Devon rivals Exeter City 2‚Äì0 at Home Park, in a league fixture. A total of 14,347 attended the game ‚Äì the biggest gate at Home Park in three years, and also a sell out. Both goals came from Bradley Wright-Phillips, who, as of 17 December 2010, was League One's top scorer with twelve goals. On 24 December it was announced that Keith Todd MBE had stood down as Executive Director, to be replaced temporarily by Paul Stapleton. Todd will, however, remain on the Board of Directors. On 27 December 2010, it was announced by the BBC that Sir Roy Gardner had relinquished his role as chairman and stood down from the board. On 4 January, Argyle propelled themselves up to 12th in League One ‚Äì their highest position since August ‚Äì after coming from 2 ‚Äì 0 down at half-time to beat Westcountry rivals Bristol Rovers 2 ‚Äì 3, thanks to goals from Bradley Wright-Phillips, Joe Mason and St√©phane Zubar. On 21 February, the club issued a notice of intention to appoint an administrator and were immediately docked 10 points by the Football League which dropped them to the bottom of the League One table after poor results continued.\\"Plymouth Argyle are deducted 10 points\\".

In the following season Argyle started looking to climb back up the Football League, but got off to a shaky start under Carl Fletcher, who continued to take charge of the squad after the Summer. The club found themselves bottom of the table again at the end of the Christmas period, and consequently Fletcher was sacked on 1 January 2013 and replaced on 6 January by John Sheridan. In the second half of the season, the club was again narrowly saved from relegation, and they finished 21st for the second season in a row. Sheridan then agreed a three-year contract to continue as Argyle manager, and in his first full season in charge the club finished 10th, an achievement which displayed great improvement on the previous two seasons. Argyle had a far stronger start to their fourth consecutive season in League 2, winning 4 games consecutively for the first time since 2008. Despite a poor run of results over Christmas and the New Year, including a 0‚Äì0 draw against a 10-man York City, Argyle looked set to clinch a League 2 play-off position thanks to a 3‚Äì2 home win against Tranmere Rovers, a result which, at the same time, relegated the away side out of the Football League for the first time in 94 years. Derek Adams was appointed in 2015 and by Christmas, Argyle were top of the league. But by February they had slipped down to 2nd and with a 2‚Äì2 Draw with Cambridge United F.C. made it impossible for Argyle to get automatic promotion. After a 2‚Äì2 draw with Portsmouth F.C. Argyle secured a place in the EFL League Two play-off final via a 91st minuite header from Peter Hartley. But after a poor performance in the final, Argyle were, surprising beaten 2‚Äì0 by AFC Wimbledon from 78th and 98th minuite goals. The 2016‚Äì17 season saw Argyle, for the second season in a row, at the top of the table at the midpoint of the season at Christmas. But argyle slipped down to second place after a poor run of form after Christmas. With 4 games to go, Argyle only needed 1 point to seal promotion. But a comprehensive 6‚Äì1 victory against Newport County on 17 April in front of a packed Home Park to make it impossible for Luton Town to catch them. They therefore were promoted to League One after six years in the fourth tier. On the last day of the season, Argyle had the chance to go up as champions. But after a 1‚Äì1 draw with Grimsby Town F.C. the title was handed to Portsmouth F.C. via goal difference. The pilgrims got off to an appalling start to their League one campaign with only racking up 5 points in their first 11 games and receiving 4 red cards in 4 consecutive home games, sitting rock bottom, 4 points off of safety even 11 games in. And a 2‚Äì1 defeat at home to Fleetwood added to Argyle's woes pushing their winless run to 10 games raking up 2 points from a possible 30 in that time. Some fans disputed about the board sacking Derek Adams even after taking them up in the previous season due to poor tactics and game management. The turn of December 2017, into 2018 saw argyle record 16 wins, 6 draws and only 5 losses to escape relegation and finish 7th, only missing out on a play-off spot by 3 points. Hallett takes over As early as March 2016, Plymouth-born but American-based businessman Simon Hallett had invested into Argyle and hence joined the board of directors. Hallett later increased his stake in the club, as well as offering a long-term, minimum interest loan to the club to help refurbish the Mayflower Grandstand. In August 2018, Hallett became the majority shareholder of the club, with James Brent reducing his stake, as well as stepping down as chairman. Hallett had originally appointed David Felwick CBE as Argyle's chairman-elect, but he cited \\"personal reasons\\" for being unable to takeover, so Hallett took over as chairman on 1 November 2018. On the field, it took Argyle until their 12th league game to secure their first win of the 2018‚Äì19 season, a 1‚Äì0 victory over AFC Wimbledon. The form of top goalscorer Freddie Ladapo was the shining light in a disappointing first half of the season, with a stand-out low point of a 5‚Äì1 defeat away to Luton Town. The turn of the new year saw Argyle pick up form, winning 6 of their first 9 games of 2019, and losing just 2 of the first 12, culminating in a 5‚Äì1 win over Rochdale on 23 February. This run coincided with the return of Kyle Letheren in between the sticks in place of Matt Macey. An injury to Letheren and a stop‚Äìstart March followed with Argyle winning late on against Shrewsbury Town at home, before giving away a 2‚Äì1 and then a 2‚Äì0 lead to Bristol Rovers and then Blackpool in the dying minutes to draw both matches. What was seemingly 6 points dropped to 2 proved costly as Argyle's league form dipped, losing every single game in April, and following a 5‚Äì1 defeat to Accrington Stanley which left the club in the EFL League One relegation zone with just one match of the season left to play, Derek Adams and his assistant Paul Wotton were relieved of their duties. Kevin Nancekivell took over as caretaker manager for the final game of the season, and despite winning 3‚Äì2 against Scunthorpe United, results elsewhere at games involving Southend United and AFC Wimbledon saw Argyle relegated to the EFL League Two. Ahead of the 2019‚Äì20 season, Hallett appointed Ryan Lowe as Derek Adams' successor, signing the then 40-year-old Liverpudlian and his assistant manager Steven Schumacher from newly promoted but financially troubled Bury. Hallett also increased his stake in the club once more to 94% percent, taking over James Brent's remaining shares as both he and his daughter Natasha Brent stepped down from Argyle's board, ending Brent's 8-year spell at the club.

The school served about 700 pupils aged 11‚Äì16. History Thomas Hepburn Community School was founded in 1990 following the merger of Sheriff Hill and Highfield Schools, based at the Highfield site. It was named for Thomas Hepburn, a trade union leader. The original headmaster was Mr. C.B. Buddle who had previously been headmaster at Sheriff Hill. In 2009 the school started an extensive rebuild project which saw the demolition of North and South block, the school hall, sports hall and gym as well as the refurbishment of the Technology block which now is home to the Art, Humanities and ICT departments. The Lifelong Learning building was refurbished over the summer break in 2011. In 2012 Thomas Hepburn was judged to be \\"Unsatisfactory\\" by Ofsted, and the 2012 Exam results placed the school among the 200 lowest attaining schools in the country. In January 2013 the Department of Education made the decision to convert the school into an academy, which formally occurred in October 2013. The school was then renamed Thomas Hepburn Community Academy. In 2015 a new system of a \\"mini school\\" took place, letting the year 7 students be free from the older students. In 2019, the school closed, due to dwindling student numbers, mainly attributed to poor exam results.  Ofsted  In February 2017, the academy was rated 'Inadequate' by Ofsted. The report said almost all pupils failed to achieve good enough qualifications and the brightest pupils weren't fulfilling their potential, while poorly planned teaching saw academic strugglers punished. Inspectors said teachers ‚Äúsettle too often for incomplete work or work of a poor standard‚Äù, and pupils who missed lessons weren't helped to catch up, and quickly fell behind. Meanwhile, behaviour was described as sub-standard. The report said: ‚ÄúThe majority of pupils have a positive attitude to learning but a significant number of pupils purposely disrupt learning for themselves and others. These issues have been ongoing seemingly since the school was formed.

Their different physical and biological filters work in combination to remove suspended and dissolved impurities of water. Green bridge filters help in reducing the suspended solids by filtration process, reducing Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)/Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) by aerobic degradation. Green Bridges also help in the restoration of ecological food chain.  Development  Natural streams, rivers and lakes have their own in-built purification system which consists of natural slopes, stones for biological growth and complex food web help in the purification process. This food web is nothing but utilization of one's waste by another as its own food. Nature has her own living machinery of detritivorous microbes and other living species to consume wastes. These principles have been harnessed in the treatment of polluted streams. Green bridges are developed using fibrous material with stones. All the floatable and suspended solids are trapped in this biological bridge and the turbidity of flowing water is reduced. Green plants on the bridges increase the DO level in water, which in turn facilitates the growth of aerobic organisms, which degrade organic pollutants. Sandeep Joshi, director, SERI (Shrishti Eco-Research Institute) has developed this technology and has received a patent for it.  Benefits  * Capital expenditure is comparable with the annual operational cost of conventional bioremediation systems. * Can be developed and operated in combination with conventional systems to improve the performance of the latter. * Reduce the ecotoxicity of the man-made substances released into the water bodies and facilitate the eco-assimilation of those pollutants into the ecological cycles thus reducing the quantum of hazardous residues to zero which otherwise require costly secured landfill and incineration techniques. =Expected results= * Solids control : 40‚Äì80% reduction * Pollution control : COD/BOD reduction ‚Äì 40‚Äì90% * Fecal coliforms control : 50‚Äì100% reduction * Ecotoxicity : Nil * Dissolved oxygen : Increased by 150% ‚Äì 1200% * Aquatic species :  Increase in plants/plankton ‚Äì 200%  Increase in micro-invertebrates ‚Äì 200% Other than the changes in the water quality mentioned above a multifold change in population of avifauna, terrestrial plants along the riverbanks has been noticed.

In 1941, the Eagan Homes and Herndon Homes public housing projects opened and as a result, the black population in the area increased. On Hunter Street (now Martin Luther King Jr. Drive), white business owners once lived behind their stores, but in the 1940s, black owners started taking over these businesses. In 1947 Paschal's Restaurant, an Atlanta soul food landmark and meeting place for civil rights leaders, opened in its original location on West Hunter Street. In 1951, the English Avenue Elementary School's designation was changed from white to black in response to most whites having moved out of the area.\\"Furtive Dynamiters Blast Big Atlanta Negro School\\", Meriden Record, December 13, 1960 =Heyday and Civil Rights= During the mid-20th century, the area was a middle-class African-American neighborhood. Commercial areas included English Avenue; Simpson Street/Road, in its heyday in the 1950s and 1960s; and Bankhead Highway, which was part of the US Highway system, and was in its splendor in the 1960s. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. moved to the area in 1967, and his widow Coretta Scott King continued to live here until she moved to a Peachtree Road luxury condominium purchased for her by Oprah Winfrey in 2004. In 1960, the English Avenue elementary school was dynamited, likely in retaliation for civil rights demonstrations by blacks. Mayor William B. Hartsfield condemned the dynamiting as the work of those from outside Atlanta, \\"the outhouse set\\". The area experienced notable pro- and anti-Black Power riots in 1966\\"Forming Mobs Turn into Anti-Black Power Rally\\", Lodi News-Sentinel, September 6, 1966 and 1967.\\"Negro Disorders Erupt in Atlanta Slum Section\\", Rome News-Tribune, October 24, 1967 =Decline and crime= Abandoned houses, Proctor at Oliver streets, English Avenue Suburbanization started draining the area's vitality starting in the 1970s. Over the following decades, it attracted buyers and sellers of heroin, and deteriorated into a corner of poverty in the city, characterized by large numbers of abandoned, boarded-up houses. In 1995 the English Avenue Elementary School closed. In 2006, a \\"no-knock raid\\" in search of a drug dealer, burst into the home of Kathryn Johnston. Ms. Johnston, in her 80s, opened fire on the officers and wounded three and was killed by return fire from the officers. The incident resulted in much anger in the neighborhood and in close scrutiny of police use of \\"no-knock warrants\\" in drug raids.Patrik Jonsson, \\"After Atlanta raid tragedy, new scrutiny of police tactics\\", Christian Science Monitor, November 29, 2006 The 2008 tornado caused major damage in areas of Vine City (photos). The 2010s foreclosure crisis hit the neighborhoods hard. In April 2012, Creative Loafing reported that \\"on some streets more houses are boarded up than are lived in\\". Occupy Atlanta protested the Vine City foreclosure of Mrs. Pamela Flores by Bank of America. The desperate state of the area was described by reporter Thomas Wheatley in Creative Loafing in September 2012 as:\\"The Stadium Effect\\", Thomas Wheatley, Creative Loafing, September 6, 2012 > \\"boarded-up homes built among the trees along the narrow streets,‚Ä¶people > loitering in the middle of vacant lots, casting hollow stares at passing > motorists, and‚Ä¶young men hanging out on street corners, hollering at > passers-by and then to lookouts down the street\\" Revitalization Recent revitalization efforts in the Vine City neighborhood include the Westside Commons town home complex, photographed here during the 2014 snowstorm. =1990s: Failed \\"empowerment zone\\"= In November 1994, the Atlanta Empowerment Zone was established, a 10-year, $250 million federal program to revitalize Atlanta's 34 poorest neighborhoods including the Bluff.

The park will consist of a system of storm water management including a retention pond similar to the one in nearby Historic Old Fourth Ward Park, walking trails and amenities including a terraced amphitheater and splash pad and statues and monuments honoring a number of prominent Atlantans and Civil Rights leaders, including Martin Luther King Jr. and Booker T. Washington. The site, located along the south side of Joseph E. Boone Boulevard, has been vacant for many years, after the city purchased several homes there that perpetually fell victim to severe flooding caused by historic mismanagement in the Proctor Creek watershed. In December 2011 Park Pride, a greenspace advocacy group, proposed a network of greenspaces and parks that‚Äîthrough the incorporation of green infrastructure‚Äîwould help mitigate the recurring flooding from stormwater runoff that plagued the neighborhoods of Vine City and English Avenue for years. In 2015, the City began cleaning the site, and the Trust For Public Land joined the partnership to plan, raise funds, and construct the park above and around the stormwater management solutions. The National Monuments Foundation and Rodney Cook will fund and construct \\"sculptures of civil rights leaders, an urban farm, and an 80-foot \\"peace column.\\" The design mimics Mims Park, now demolished, which was once a prominent city park in Vine City named after Livingston Mims, who was mayor of Atlanta from 1901 to 1903. It was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted who also designed Piedmont Park in Midtown and Central Park in New York City. English Avenue Elementary School, site of a proposed \\"green technology global community center\\" In 2017, it was announced that construction will commence, however the park will be named Rodney Cook Sr. Park and it is hoped to stimulate revitalization. Along with this park, Kathryn Johnston Memorial Park, named in honor of former neighborhood resident Kathryn Johnston, was also built in the neighborhood, being officially opened in 2019. =Other efforts since 2010= In May 2010, the non-profit Greater Vine City Opportunities Program, founded and directed by \\"Able\\" Mable Thomas bought the English Avenue Elementary School with the intention to convert it into a \\"state of the art green technology global community center\\". In March 2011, NPU L voted in favor of a Sunset Avenue Historic District from Joseph E. Boone Blvd. southward to Magnolia Street. In December 2011, the nonprofit Friends of English Avenue arranged for a married couple, both police officers, to live rent-free in a neighborhood house. \\"Able\\" Mable Thomas and others expressed the need for a \\"rebranding\\" of the area similar to the one which rebranded crime and prostitution-infested Stewart Avenue in Southwest Atlanta as Metropolitan Parkway. Other transformative efforts continued in 2014. A new Urban Perform gym opened on Joseph E. Boone Blvd designed to empower residents to make healthy lifestyle changes. The gym also hosts a local farmer's market on Saturdays which offers fresh, organic, produce from local community gardens. One of these gardens is the Historic Westside Gardens, which hopes to expand through a cooperative effort with the National Monument Foundation into Mims Park. The Westside Works, a non-profit and jobs training center, opened in 2014 at the site of former E.R. Carter School at 80 Joseph E. Lowery Blvd. NW. Their mission is to serve the underserved by teaching new skills crucial to the modern workforce. In Summer 2014 they graduated their first class of trainees. =2010s investments= There are multiple efforts underway to encourage and promote home ownership in Vine City and English Avenue. Invest Atlanta has a trust fund which provides up to 10% of the downpayment for a first time homeowner, up to $15,000. Home Atlanta 4.0 provides up to 5% of the house cost, but waives the first-time buyer requirement. Invest Atlanta and the Arthur M. Blank Foundation partnered to provide $30 million in seed money for innovative and transformative non-profits to help revitalize the two neighborhoods. In 2018, Friendship Baptist church held talks with developers regarding Downtown West, a new construction development adjacent to the new home of the Atlanta Falcons, Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Culture Revitalization in English Avenue continues with work on multiple community gardens. A before & after picture of the English Avenue Community Farm. =Festivals= In 2012, an annual festival was established, the Historic Westside Village Festival. The event includes educational seminars, vendors, a Kids Zone, and a concert stage, with proceeds going to local charities and services. In 2013 the festival took place on September 21. The annual English Avenue Festival of Lights is directed by the Historic Westside Cultural Arts Council. The Festival is an exhibition of the community and encourages community members to be a light in their neighborhood. There is a Children's pavilion, free food and drinks, and an exhibition of local non-profits.

MEDINA consists of two modules: * a FEM preprocessor (MEDINA.Pre) and * a FEM postprocessor (MEDINA.Post). In the preprocessor all steps are taken before the computation can start, i.e.: * Import of geometry data from CAD system; * Import of associated meta data from the CAD-system or PDM-system; * Import of FE-models; * Editing and repair of CAD geometry; * Meshing; * Model structuring; * Definition of material parameters; * Definition of boundary conditions; * Definition of load cases; * Generation of the solver specific input deck. In the postprocessor all steps are taken after the computation of the primary data of the solver is finished, e.g.: * Determination of the derived secondary data; * Illustration of the results (graphics, animations); * Export functionalities; * Generation of reports.  Characteristics  MEDINA was designed to support complex simulation tasks and huge FE models‚Äîfound typically in automotive and aerospace industries‚Äîwith high performance. Important design elements to achieve high performance are parts structures and connector elements. * Parts enable a 1:1 mapping of the product structure of the CAD-/PDM-system within the FE model. * Connector elements are used for the generic as well as solver and client specific modeling of assembling techniques like welding, bolting, bonding. Within the process step of the so-called \\"model assembly\\" the single FE-components (parts structures and connector elements) are merged to the complex comprehensive FE- model representing complex products like vehicles, aircraft, etc. Single process steps or complete process chains can be automated by protocol and script techniques. Dynamic commands enable to integrate client specific plug- ins within the standard functionality of MEDINA.  Target groups/user groups  Due to the development roots of MEDINA and the included functionalities for the analysis of huge FE-models MEDINA is a widely used pre-/postprocessor for FE analysis especially in automotive industries. Furthermore, MEDINA is used in aerospace, manufacturing industries, engineering service providers and universities.

Geography and geology The valley runs from Peak Dale down to Blackwell Mill at Chee Dale on the River Wye. The scenery is of limestone, which extends to a depth of around 380 metres. It contains the only dikes in the White Peak. Boreholes have enabled the extraction of significant amounts of water, used by local industry. Prior to the local quarrying, the southern part of the valley was described as \\"narrow, flat-bottomed, rocky... [with] almost perpendicular cliffs of limestone on either side...\\", whereas the northern part was broader and grassy. History The dale fell within the bounds of the mediaeval Forest of High Peak. The surrounding land was first farmed in about 1250, by people connected with the nearby hamlet of Tunstead. In 1867, an extension of the Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway was opened, running through the valley between Peak Forest and Millers Dale. This section of line remains open, for freight traffic, now known as the Great Rocks Line after this area. Tunstead Quarry The valley is now dominated by Tunstead Quarry, a large limestone quarry, worked since 1929. Given its economic importance, the boundary of the Peak District National Park was carefully drawn to exclude the dale. By 1973, Tunstead was the largest quarry in Europe, and permission to extend it into the National Park was rejected on the grounds that there was sufficient stone to last until at least 2000. Following a Public Inquiry and a High Court case, the Secretary of State ultimately overrode the National Park Authority's decision and granted permission for a extension within the Peak District National Park. It remains the largest producer of limestone in the Peak District, with about 5.5 million tonnes extracted each year. In 1932, quarrying opened a fissure which contained remains of bison, Irish elk and deer, washed down from the surface in the distant past. In 1957, the painter Peter Lanyon visited the valley to study the faces of the quarry, seeing them as revealing both the geological and human history of the area.

From 2012 to 2018 he was the Academic Director of the Weltethos-Institut (Global Ethic Institute) at the University of T√ºbingen before taking on a Chair for Globalization Ethics at the university's Institute for Political Science. Dierksmeier is a board member of the international think tank The Humanistic Management Network and Academic Director of the Humanistic Management Center. He is a member of the research group Ethics in Action for Sustainable Development summoned by Jeffrey Sachs on part of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network and the Pontifical Academy of Sciences and he works on the advisory councils of various academic journals and political foundations. In March 2018 he was appointed as a member of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts. As a strategic consultant he has worked, among other things, for the Bruce Henderson Institute of the Boston Consulting Group.  Research  Dierksmeier conducts research on topics of economic and political philosophy as well as globalization ethics. One of his central fields of interest is the concept of Humanistic Management, which he has advanced through various publications.e.g. From Capitalistic to Humanistic Business, Human Development in Business ‚Äì Challenges for Contemporary Management and Humanistic Ethics in the Age of Globality, all published at Palgrave Macmillan This theory criticizes the 'mechanistic' conception of human behavior in neoclassical economics and advocates for a reorientation towards a 'humanistic' paradigm in management theory and practice. The foundation of this humanist approach is his theory of Qualitative Freedom. This theory discards the classical dichotomy between positive and negative freedom in order to retrace the history of the idea of liberty along the distinction between quantitative and qualitative freedom. Quantitative conceptions of freedom, Dierksmeier argues, aim principally at maximizing the number of options available to individuals, whereas qualitative approaches are based on the supposition that certain kinds of freedoms have a higher value than others, resulting in different priorities for different liberties. As the required process of assigning different values to different liberties has to follow a liberal procedure itself, it can yield different outcomes in different societies based on the respective societies' conceptions of freedom, which makes the abstract concept of quantitative freedom compatible with various specific implementations in different cultures around the globe.

Koch then passed his Abitur and studied under Savigny until 1825. His first publication in 1826 brought him immediate recognition and led to numerous appointments. He studied French law in Cologne and Aachen and was appointed justice of the supreme court at Marienwerder (1829). He was appointed director of the law courts, successively, at Kulm (1832), Grossglogau (1834) and Halle (1840).
