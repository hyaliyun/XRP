Life  Yervant Voskan was born in 1855 in Constantinople, Ottoman Empire, son of writer Hagop Voskan (1824 - 1907), and grandson of Voskan Gotogyan of Erzurum, who was a foundryman at the Imperial Mint. After receiving his primary education from his father, he attended the Catholic Armenian Makruhyan School in Besiktas. In 1866 he went to Venice to study at the Murad Raphaelian School, graduating in 1872. He also studied in France and when he returned home he helped in the founding of the department of sculpture at the school of fine arts and was appointed as teacher of the department when the school was founded.http://www.turkishculture.org/fine- art/sculpture-580.htm He began teaching sculpture in the academy on March 1, 1883. At the time, he was the only professor of sculpture in the Ottoman Empire. He along with Osman Hamdi Bey conducted the first scientific based archaeological in the history of the Ottoman Empire. His archeological research included the Commagene tomb-sanctuary in Nemrut Daƒüƒ± in southeastern Anatolia and the Alexander Sarcophagus in Sidon. He was the chief restorer of the Sarcophagus.

Completed in 1877, the sculpture was a departure for Leighton, and heralded the advent of a new movement, New Sculpture, taking realistic approach to classical models. It has been described as a \\"sculptural masterpiece\\" and as \\"possibly Leighton's greatest contribution to British art\\". Despite its indebtedness to the Classical tradition, it can be understood as one of the first stirrings of modern sculpture in Britain as well as in Europe. The Athlete was arguably the most influential piece of English sculpture of the 19th century. The sculpture was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1877 under the title An Athlete Wrestling with a Python but it is sometimes also known as An Athlete Strangling a Python or An Athlete Struggling with a Python. The original full-size bronze was acquired for the nation using funds from the Chantrey Bequest, and is displayed at Tate Britain in London. Description The sculpture depicts a dramatic scene of life and death, with a classically proportioned male nude wrestling with a large snake. Leighton conceived the composition while working on sculptural modellos for the figures in his 1873-76 processional painting of the Daphnephoria. It may have been inspired by the story of Apollo slaying the Python of Delphi. There are obvious parallels with the classical sculpture of Laoco√∂n and His Sons, and the work also owes a debt to works of Michelangelo. The male, a muscular athlete crowned with a wreath, is standing with his legs apart, holding the python's head away with his right hand, while grasping its body with his left hand behind his back. The python has thrown two coils around the athlete's left thigh and its body curves around the athlete's back, but its mouth gapes wide in the throes of death as it is being throttled. The work depicts the musculature of the figures and the scales of the serpent realistically, with contrasting textures. The work was designed in a spiral, so it must be viewed in the round from a variety of angles. The exaggerated spiral composition confounds any singular view of the statue, and its form exceeds that of its predecessors' use of the figura serpentinata. With it, Leighton developed the Athlete as a statement about the properties of sculpture as distinct from those of painting, and the composition encourages a temporal and circumambulatory experience of the work as a means of highlighting sculpture's physicality and three-dimensionality. The model for the athlete was an Italian professional, Angelo Colorossi (father of the Angelo Colarossi who was the model for Alfred Gilbert's 1891 sculpture of Anteros). The work was originally modelled a small-scale clay figure, a plaster cast of which was later given to George Frederic Watts. Jules Dalou, a French sculptor who was in exile in London after the Paris Commune, encouraged Leighton to scale it up and to have it cast as a life-size bronze. Leighton was assisted by Thomas Brock, and comparisons can be made to Brock's 1869 work of Hercules Strangling Antaeus, and a similar sculpture of 1814 by Fran√ßois Joseph Bosio, Hercule combattant Ach√©lo√ºs m√©tamorphos√© en serpent (not cast in bronze until 1824; in the Louvre). There is a similar wrestling figure in Leighton's painting of Hercules wrestling with Death for the Body of Alcestis (at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, Connecticut). The work was scaled up and modelled in plaster at Brock's studio in Boscobel Place, Westminster, and then cast in bronze by Cox & Son, whose foundry in Thames Ditton was later taken over by A.B. Burton. The original life-size bronze measures and weighs . It was the first full-size nude adult male sculpture with no fig leaf to conceal its genitals to be made in Britain in decades. It is also one of the first modern life-size statues in Europe to eschew a clearly identifiable mythological, religious or classical source. In this, it is comparable to the contemporary sculpture by Auguste Rodin, The Age of Bronze (1876), and the slightly later 'Standing Man' (1884) by Adolf von Hildebrand. Leighton's Athlete, along with these contemporary statues, pushed the Classical tradition to its limits and helped to open the discourse of modernity in sculpture in Europe.

At the time, the purity of white marble was preferred for new imaginative works, but Leighton's work created renewed interest in the darker material. The sculpture was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1877. Joseph Edgar Boehm, Queen Victoria's Sculptor in Ordinary, wrote to Leighton in 1877 that it was \\"superb. I think it the best statue of modern days.\\" The art critic Edmund Gosse saw it was \\"something wholly new, propounded by a painter to the professional sculptors and displaying a juster and livelier sense of what their art should be than they themselves had ever dreamed of\\". The Athenaeum praised the work, saying Leighton had \\"selected a subject full of passion, and dealt with it in correspondingly energetic manner, and in a style that suited the subject, adopting a vigorous, and, to some extent, massive style\\". It won the gold medal for sculpture at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1878. It was purchased for ¬£2,000 by the Chantrey Bequest on behalf of the British nation, making it the first sculpture acquired for the national art collection in that manner. It is still held by Tate Britain. Leighton was elected the President of the Royal Academy in 1878 and was knighted in the same year. He donated the original plaster model for the full-size sculpture to the Royal Academy in 1886, the year he was created a baronet. A plaster cast of the clay study, , is held by Tate Britain, made c.1877 and presented by Alphonse Legros 1897, and a further version in bronze is in the Ashmolean Museum, in Oxford. A marble replica was carved by Frederick Pomeroy for Carl Jacobsen's Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in Copenhagen. Leighton counselled against the reproduction, as the marble is less able to hold its own weight, but eventually acquiesced and adapted the composition, adding supports for the legs. It was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1891 before being transported to Denmark. The marble sculpture was de-accessioned by the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in 1974. After passing through several private collections, it was sold at Christie's in 2003 for ¬£446,650. In 2017, John Schaeffer donated the marble replica to the Art Gallery of New South Wales, in Sydney, Australia.An athlete wrestling with a python, Art Gallery of New South Wales Smaller reproductions of the bronze were cast in two sizes by Ernest Brown and Phillips at the Leicester Galleries between 1903 and 1910. A bronze was acquired by the Leighton House Museum in 2005, part funded with a grant from the Art Fund. The museum also has a plaster model of the python which Leighton presented to George Frederic Watts around 1900. An example of the 52 cm bronze was sold at Bonhams in 2017 for ¬£106,250. Later works Leighton made only two other bronzes sculptures, both exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1886. Brock assisted Leighton with a second full-size male nude sculpture, his The Sluggard (1885), sometimes titled An Athlete Awakening from Sleep. The inspiration for the piece came from his life drawing of model Giuseppe Valona. The original bronze measures . It was donated to the nascent Tate Gallery by Henry Tate in 1894. Smaller casts are in several other museum collections. Leighton's third and last bronze sculpture was a much smaller statuette of a female nude, Needless Alarms (1886), depicting a girl frightened by a toad. It measures . A cast was acquired by John Everett Millais, and another cast was presented to the Tate Gallery in 1940 by Lady Aberconway (the wife of Henry McLaren, 2nd Baron Aberconway).

The group promotes environmental policies and produces cultural works aimed at ending America's use of gasoline. Coltura has produced several works critical of gasoline use which have been presented in cities in the United States and Canada. The organization advocates for policies to phase out the sales of new gasoline-powered vehicles by 2030.  History = Founding = Coltura was founded in 2014 by Matthew Metz, an attorney in Seattle, Washington. Coltura's name comes from an amalgamation of CO2, the chemical formula for carbon dioxide, and the word culture'. The organization was founded as a nonprofit with a mission of \\"eliminating gasoline use in America by 2040\\". Metz serves as co-director of the organization along with Janelle London. = Art events = Coltura has staged street theatre and performance art in a tradition akin to commedia dell'arte. In September 2016, Coltura staged performances at gas stations, public events, and streets in Seattle to raise awareness about pollution-emitting gasoline vehicles. The performances were inspired by the strategies employed by the Colombian politician Antanas Mockus, who as mayor of Bogot√° hired mimes to poke fun at drivers who drove past pedestrian crosswalks. Coltura performed at Seattle Design Festival, where they displayed an art installation as well as performing at the First Thursday Art Walk and Bumbershoot. Actors billed as \\"gasoline ghosts\\", carrying gasoline hoses and nozzles and dressed in white leotards, drew attention to the air pollution and greenhouse gases created by gasoline use. The \\"ghosts\\" showed their affection for gasoline, and comedically chased down cars to inhale their exhaust. In October 2016, Coltura staged a procession entitled Funeral for Gasoline as part of No Gasoline Day, in which actors carried a casket containing a fuel nozzle from the Space Needle to Downtown Seattle. Coltura won the 2017 Sustainable Seattle Arts and Culture Award for their No Gasoline Day performance and \\"for helping change cultural norms about the use of gasoline through mobile and interactive live performance, social media, and imagery and videos challenging the cultural status quo.\\" In June 2017, the group exhibited The Gas Trap, a 25-foot high clear vinyl bubble connected to the tailpipe of a gasoline-powered car, accompanied by a theatrical piece. The work was a collaboration between Metz, Samaj, the Seattle Design Nerds, Alyssa Norling and Grace Orr. During the performance first staged in Westlake Park in Seattle, the performers appeared to be trapped inside and gasping for breath as artificial smoke filled the bubble. The performance was staged again in Canada on September 10 at the Roundhouse Community Arts and Recreation Centre in Vancouver, British Columbia. Coltura held a mural contest in 2017 and collaborated with the artist Craig Cundiff to produce a large mural in the industrial Georgetown district of Seattle. It depicts a boy wearing a mask over his mouth and nose, with a view of Seattle's congested highways, hazy sky and setting orange sun in the background. Coltura‚Äôs gas ghosts and gasoline video have also received widespread publicity. = Recharge Required report = On June 1, 2018, Coltura released a report, named Recharge Required, on the status of the State of Washington's varies agencies adherence to a 2007 law requiring \\"vehicles in government fleets to run on electricity or biofuel‚Ä¶ 'to the extent practicable'\\". According to the report, in contrast to the 100% adherence set as the goal by the deadline on June 1, 2015, less than 6% of vehicles in use by county and city agencies and 2% of the state's motor pool meet this goal. In Washington State, Coltura‚Äôs Recharge Required report spurred legislative appropriation of $450,000 to study public fleet electrification. = Legislative efforts = In March 2020, Coltura led a coalition to pass Zero Emissions Vehicle legislation in Washington State. Coltura also led a coalition that introduced Washington State legislation mandating that all new cars sold be electric by 2030, ‚Äì thereby effectively banning sales of new gasoline vehicles.

It was built in 1864 in what was then the separate community of Valley Creek. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 for its local significance in the themes of architecture and exploration/settlement. As one of the original houses in Valley Creek, it was nominated for helping to depict one of the many small Washington County settlements that formed around a commercial venture‚Äîthough one that never progressed to formal platting‚Äîand the community's two-decade preference for Greek Revival architecture. Valley Creek was later formally incorporated into Afton. Description The Newington Gilbert House is a two-story wood-frame building. The original section has a simple rectangular floorplan. Patterned on ancient Greek temples, it sports as decoration full-height pilasters at the front corners, a wide entablature, and gable returns forming a broken pediment. The double-sash windows have straight wooden lintels. while an attic window at the gable peak has a shelf-like hood supported by small brackets. An enclosed porch stretches across the front of the house and wraps around much of the south side as well. The porch has square columns that echo the pilasters on the main structure. A transverse wing was added to the rear of the Gilbert House sometime after its nomination to the National Register. History Newington Gilbert was born in Onondaga County, New York, in 1815. He married his wife Celestia in 1850 and the couple moved out to Washington County, Minnesota, the following year. They initially settled on a farm in Woodbury, where Newington served as a justice of the peace. He was a member of the Democrat delegation to the Minnesota constitutional convention in 1857. In 1860 he and a business partner established a gristmill on Valley Creek. Newington sold his interest in the mill just two years later, but in 1864 the Gilberts moved to the community of Valley Creek and had this home built for themselves and their two children. When Newington died in 1912 at the age of 97, he was the last surviving member of the state constitutional convention. The Gilbert House was nominated to the National Register of Historic Places as one of three early Valley Creek houses in a 1981 thematic resource study. The Erastus Bolles House was also listed but a third residence, the Silas Geer House, was not.

Biography  Bertin Mwamba was born on 25 September 1932 in Songa, Belgian Congo into a Luba family. He received three years of secondary education at the Ecole des Moniteurs. He worked as a teacher from 1953 until 1957, when he became a chartered accountant, holding the latter job until 1960. Mwamba participated in the economic portion of the Belgo-Congolese Round Table Conference in Brussels from April to May 1960. He was a member of the Conf√©d√©ration des associations tribales du Katanga (CONAKAT) party and led its chapter in Kamina. In anticipation of the May 1960 general elections in the Congo, Mwamba directed the party's campaigning efforts in the town. Without many resources to organise the local campaign, he appealed to the local electorate by saying that CONAKAT would serve as a bulwark against domination from the neighbouring Kasai region. Mwamba was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in the election, representing the Haut-Lomami constituency in Katanga Province. Though a member of CONAKAT, he had political differences with party leader Mo√Øse Tshombe. Thus even though Katanga had seceded under Tshombe's direction, Mwamba returned to his seat in Parliament in August 1961. In March 1962 he ran as the parliamentary opposition's candidate to be President of the Chamber. He lost the Chamber vote, 51 to 59. In November he successfully secured the office and held it until March 1963. In April, following the termination of the Katangese secession, Prime Minister Cyrille Adoula reshuffled his government and appointed Mwamba Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs. He was re-elected to the Chamber in 1965. That November Joseph-D√©sir√© Mobutu took power in a coup. Mwamba was appointed Minister for the Post Office, Telegraphs and Telecommunications, and he held the post until a cabinet reshuffle on 18 December 1966. On 18 January 1967 he was arrested on charges of embezzling $570,000 of government profits from stamp resells while in office. Mwamba later involved himself in commerce and agriculture.

All of these systems adapt to their individual users, or to groups of users (i.e., Personalization). To achieve this goal, they collect and represent information about users or groups (i.e., User modeling). The UMAP conferences have historically been organized under the auspices of User Modeling Inc., a professional organization of User Modeling researchers. Until 2015, the conference proceedings were published by Springer. In 2016, the UMAP conference series became affiliated with the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), where it is supported by ACM SIGWEB and ACM SIGCHI.  History  UMAP is the successor of the biennial conference series on User Modeling and Adaptive Hypermedia. The User Modeling series started in 1986 as the First International Workshop on User Modeling (UM) at Maria Laach, Germany and was first officially called a conference at the Fourth International Conference on User Modeling in Hyannis, Massachusetts. The last conference in the original series was UM 2007. The International Conference on Adaptive Hypermedia and Adaptive Web-based Systems (abbreviated as AH) started in 2000. The last conference in this original series was AH 2008, held in 2008. For several years between 2000 and 2008, UM and AH ran biennially in alternate years. In 2009, the conference series merged into a single annual series under the UMAP designation. The first UMAP conference was in 2009. The full list of conferences in the series can be found on the UM Inc. website and in a timeline on the Springer publisher website.

It is found in North America where it is a pest of potato plants, the larvae tunnelling inside their stems. Description The adult weevil is a small species with a length of about and a width of about . The rostrum or beak bends sharply downwards at the base. The insect is inconspicuous; it is black in color but appears gray as most of the surface is covered by minute gray scales; scales are absent from the head and from three spots at the base of the elytra, one at the front and one on either side, and these appear dark. These three bare spots give the insect its scientific name of \\"trinotata\\". Ecology This weevil feeds on plants in the family Solanaceae. The potato is its most economically-important food plant, but it sometimes feeds on the eggplant (Solanum melongena), the Carolina horsenettle (Solanum carolinense), the buffalo bur (Solanum rostratum), the European black nightshade (Solanum nigrum) and several species of groundcherry (Physalis). Adults emerge from reproductive diapause in spring and the females start to lay their eggs in May. These are deposited singly in holes made in stems and leaf stalks by the insect's rostrum, or in the axils of terminal leaves. The eggs hatch in about a week and the white, legless larvae eat their way through the stem tissues, creating tunnels up to in length. Having passed through five or six instars over a period of up to 106 days, the larvae pupate in the stem, with the adults emerging about twelve days later. There is a single generation each year and the adults overwinter inside the dead potato haulms or the stems of other members of the Solanaceae such as Solanum carolinense. Few enemies of this weevil have been identified, but it is sometimes parasitised by the braconid wasp, Nealiolus curculionis and less frequently by the chalcid wasp, Eurytoma tylodermatis. Damage The adults feed on leaves producing ragged holes, but it is the larvae that cause most damage to the potato crop with their tunnelling activities. At one time this weevil was considered a serious pest of potatoes, however modern management practices have reduced its impact. The burning or removal of crop residues destroys the overwintering adults. References * Poole, Robert W., and Patricia Gentili, eds. (1996). \\"Coleoptera\\".

The meeting with the Pope took place in Rome on Saturday, April 14, 1984 before Palm Sunday. The young people found themselves in the morning in the square in front of the Basilica of Saint John Lateran for mass, then a long procession went to St. Peter's Square in the Vatican where the meeting took place with the Pope who, for the occasion, was accompanied on stage created on the steps of St. Peter's Basilica by Mother Teresa of Calcutta. About 300,000 people attended the meeting, mostly Italians, but with a significant presence of young people coming from abroad.There were 400,000 participants according to the newspaper Avvenire (source ANSA, in Pino Vicentini, The Revolution in a Day, in Avvenire, Friday 11 August 2000.) Pope John Paul II concluded the Youth Jubilee during the Angelus of Palm Sunday. The next day, the Pope concluded the Jubilee of the Youth with the Angelus on Palm Sunday. The following week, on Easter Sunday, April 22, 1984, the Pope gave the youth the Cross of the World Youth Day as a symbol of \\"the love of the Lord Jesus for humanity and as an announcement that only in Christ died and resurrected it is salvation and redemption.\\" On this occasion he renewed the appointment for a meeting with the young people for Palm Sunday next, March 31, 1985, in the year that the UN proclaimed International Year of Youth.

The back four legs are yellowish in color, and the front two legs are yellow at the base and black at the ends. They tend to rest on their back four legs and move their front two legs above their head, making them appear like antennae on the Hymenoptera species that they mimic.

Retrieved October 27, 2019, from Discover Life website: https://www.discoverlife.org/mp/20q?search=Spilomyia+longicornis These flies can be found near and around flowers that produce pollen and nectar, which they feed on. Also, rotting trees are an important environmental component of their habitat. S. longicornis larvae are typically found in rot holes, or rotting cavities found in live trees, and develop there.Sommaggio, D. (1999). Syrphidae: can they be used as environmental bioindicators? Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment, 74(1-3), 343-356. https://doi.org/10.1016/S0167-8809(99)00042-0 Almost all types of trees can develop rot holes, but they are more common for certain types of trees than others. The rot holes provide a food source and protection for the larvae. Thus, these damp environments are ideal for larval development. Adult S. longicornis flies are most often found hovering over flowers that produce large amounts of pollen and nectar, the adults' food source. Life History S. longicornis larvae are found in rot holes in rotting trees., while adults spend the majority of their time around flowers to get pollen and nectar for food and for mating. Females need pollen for reproductive development. Only adult S. longicornis flies eat the pollen and nectar from flowers.Branquart, E., & Hemptinne, J.-L. (2000).

These nutrients, which are not consumed by S. longicornis flies until adulthood, are important for vitellogenesis, also known as yolk deposition. They also consume nectar from flowers and use that energy for their hovering behavior. Mating S. longicornis males have been directly observed mate- seeking near flowers.C.T. Maier, G.P. Waldbauer (1979) Dual mate-seeking strategies in male syrphid flies (Diptera: Syrphidae). Annals of the Entomological Society of America 72: 54‚Äì61 https://doi.org/10.1093/aesa/72.1.54 Mimicry Most Syrphidae flies mimic Hymenoptera species.Waldbauer, G. P. (n.d.). Mimicry of Hymenopteran Antennae by Syrphidae. Department of Entomology, University of Illinois. S. longicornis mimics vespid species including introduced species such as Vespula vulgaris. S. longicornis flies mimic vespid wasps in three main ways: physically, behaviorally, and auditorily. Just like vespid wasps, the anterior portion of the wings of S. longicornis flies are a darker brown color than the rest of the wing. Their abdomen is yellow with black stripes, and the thorax and head are similarly colored. Behaviorally, S. longicornis flies mimic the way common wasps move their antennae. By resting on their back four legs and placing and moving their two front black legs above their head, they more closely resemble wasps.Rashed, A., & Sherratt, T. N. (2006). Mimicry in hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae): a field test of the competitive mimicry hypothesis. Behavioral Ecology, 18(2), 337‚Äì344. https://doi.org/10.1093/beheco/arl089 When threatened, S. longicornis bend their abdomen in a similar fashion to wasps who are stinging a predator. They may also move their abdomen up and down when they are on a flower, which is a mimic of wasp abdomen expansion. Finally, it has been documented that S. longicornis flies, when threatened, produce a different buzzing sound than normal.A. Rashed, M.I. Khan, J.W. Dawson, J.E. Yack, T.N. Sherratt, Do hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae) sound like the Hymenoptera they morphologically resemble?, Behavioral Ecology, Volume 20, Issue 2, March-April 2009, Pages 396‚Äì402, https://doi.org/10.1093/beheco/arn148 While wasps do not necessarily produce a different sound upon attack, the sound S. longicornis makes when threatened seems to be of a frequency similar to some hymenopteran species. This strategy may have evolved because the visual and behavioral mimicry may not always work.

History  The people of the area were first identified as Numidians by Polybius around the 2nd century BC, although they were often referred to as the Nodidians. Eastern Numidia was annexed in 46 BC to create a new Roman province, Africa Nova. Western Numidia was also annexed after the death of its last king, Arabio, in 40 BC, and the two provinces were united with Tripolitana by Emperor Augustus, to create Africa Proconsularis. In AD 40, the western portion of Africa Proconsularis, including its legionary garrison, was placed under an imperial legatus, and in effect became a separate province of Numidia, though the legatus of Numidia remained nominally subordinate to the proconsul of Africa until AD 203. During the second century, the province was Christianized, but in the fourth century, it adhered to the Donatist heresy, despite giving rise to men of Orthodox faith as illustrious as Saint Augustine, bishop of Hippo Regius (present Annaba). After 193, under Septimius Severus, Numidia was officially detached from the province of Africa and constituted a province in its own right, governed by an imperial Legatus. Under Diocletian, it constituted a simple province in the tetrarchic reorganization, then was divided in two: Numidia Cirtensis, with capital at Cirta, and Numidia Militiana (\\"Military Numidia\\"), with capital at the legionary base of Lambaesis. However, after decades, Emperor Constantine the Great reunited the two provinces in a single one, administered from Cirta, which was now renamed Constantina (modern Constantine) In 428, the Vandals began their incursions in the African provinces. They eventually managed to create the Vandal Kingdom that lasted between 432 and 534, the year in which the Vandals fell and the African provinces was reincorporated into (Eastern) Roman domain and formed the Praetorian prefecture of Africa, half century later Exarchate of Africa, by the reign of Maurice. Between 696 and 708, the region was conquered again, this time by the Arab Muslims(Umayyad) and became part of Ifriqiya, also incorporated into the Muslim World even to this day for more 13 centuries. Article ¬´ Ifriqiya ¬ª (Larousse.fr).  Major cities  Numidia as the other African provinces became highly Romanized and was studded with numerous towns. The chief towns of Roman Numidia were: in the north, Cirta or modern Constantine, the capital, with its port Russicada (Modern Skikda); and Hippo Regius (near B√¥ne), well known as the see of St. Augustine. To the south in the interior military roads led to Theveste (Tebessa) and Lambaesis (Lambessa) with extensive Roman remains, connected by military roads with Cirta and Hippo, respectively.Detailed map of Roman Numidia Lambaesis was the seat of the Legio III Augusta, and the most important strategic centre. It commanded the passes of the Aur√®s Mountains (Mons Aurasius), a mountain block that separated Numidia from the Gaetuli Berber tribes of the desert, and which was gradually occupied in its whole extent by the Romans under the Empire. Including these towns, there were altogether twenty that are known to have received at one time or another the title and status of Roman colonies; and in the 5th century, the Notitia Dignitatum enumerates no fewer than 123 sees whose bishops assembled at Carthage in 479.

In geometry, the binary tiling (sometimes called the B√∂r√∂czky tiling) is a tiling of the hyperbolic plane, resembling a quadtree over the Poincar√© half-plane model of the hyperbolic plane. It was first studied in 1974 by . As cited by Radin. Tiles The tiles are shapes bounded by three horocyclic segments (two of which are part of the same horocycle), and two line segments. All tiles are congruent. Although they are modeled by squares or rectangles of the Poincar√© model, the tiles have five sides rather than four, and are not hyperbolic polygons, because their horocyclic edges are not straight. Alternatively, a combinatorially equivalent tiling uses hyperbolic pentagons that connect the same vertices in the same pattern. In this form of the tiling, the tiles do not appear as rectangles in the halfplane model, and the horocycles formed by sequences of edges are replaced by apeirogons.

None of these different tilings are periodic (having a cocompact symmetry group), although some (such as the one in which there exists a line that is completely covered by tile edges) have a one-dimensional infinite symmetry group.

It was set to music in 1935/36 by German composer Carl Orff as part of his Carmina Burana which premiered at Frankfurt Opera on 8 June 1937. Within Orff's Carmina Burana, this drinking song is the 14th movement in section 2, called In Taberna.  Lyrics  In taberna quando sumus, non curamus quid sit humus, sed ad ludum properamus, cui semper insudamus. Quid agatur in taberna ubi nummus est pincerna, hoc est opus ut queratur, si quid loquar, audiatur. Quidam ludunt, quidam bibunt, quidam indiscrete vivunt. Sed in ludo qui morantur, ex his quidam denudantur quidam ibi vestiuntur, quidam saccis induuntur. Ibi nullus timet mortem sed pro Baccho mittunt sortem: Primo pro nummata vini, ex hac bibunt libertini; semel bibunt pro captivis, post hec bibunt ter pro vivis, quater pro Christianis cunctis quinquies pro fidelibus defunctis, sexies pro sororibus vanis, septies pro militibus silvanis. Octies pro fratribus perversis, nonies pro monachis dispersis, decies pro navigantibus undecies pro discordantibus, duodecies pro penitentibus, tredecies pro iter agentibus. Tam pro papa quam pro rege bibunt omnes sine lege. Bibit hera, bibit herus, bibit miles, bibit clerus, bibit ille, bibit illa, bibit servus cum ancilla, bibit velox, bibit piger, bibit albus, bibit niger, bibit constans, bibit vagus, bibit rudis, bibit magus. Bibit pauper et egrotus, bibit exul et ignotus, bibit puer, bibit canus, bibit praesul et decanus, bibit soror, bibit frater, bibit anus, bibit mater, bibit ista, bibit ille, bibunt centum, bibunt mille. Parum sexcente nummate durant, cum immoderate bibunt omnes sine meta. Quamvis bibant mente leta, sic nos rodunt omnes gentes et sic erimus egentes. Qui nos rodunt confundantur et cum iustis non scribantur. When we are in the tavern, we do not think how we will go to dust, but we hurry to gamble, which always makes us sweat. What happens in the tavern, where money is host, you may well ask, and hear what I say. Some gamble, some drink, some behave loosely. But of those who gamble, some are stripped bare, some win their clothes here, some are dressed in sacks. Here no-one fears death, but they throw the dice in the name of Bacchus. First of all it is to the wine-merchant the libertines drink, one for the prisoners, three for the living, four for all Christians, five for the faithful dead, six for the loose sisters, seven for the footpads in the wood, Eight for the errant brethren, nine for the dispersed monks, ten for the seamen, eleven for the squabblers, twelve for the penitent, thirteen for the wayfarers. To the Pope as to the king they all drink without restraint. The mistress drinks, the master drinks, the soldier drinks, the priest drinks, the man drinks, the woman drinks, the servant drinks with the maid, the swift man drinks, the lazy man drinks, the white man drinks, the black man drinks, the settled man drinks, the wanderer drinks, the stupid man drinks, the wise man drinks, The poor man drinks, the sick man drinks, the exile drinks, and the stranger, the boy drinks, the old man drinks, the bishop drinks, and the deacon, the sister drinks, the brother drinks, the old lady drinks, the mother drinks, that woman drinks, that man drinks, a hundred drink, a thousand drink. Six hundred pennies would hardly suffice, if everyone drinks immoderately and immeasurably. However much they cheerfully drink we are the ones whom everyone scolds, and thus we are destitute. May those who slander us be cursed and may their names not be written in the book of the righteous.

Robinson threatened to sue the school for denying them entrance in 1930, the superintendent agreed to conduct segregated classes for black students if the two could prove that enough black students would enroll. The two founded the Challenger Air Pilots Association to develop the city's black aviation community, and by 1932 they had organized enough people to begin an all-black class. When the school lost access to its original airfield in 1933, its black students opened their own field due to the discrimination they faced at the city's other fields; originally located in the black community of Robbins, it later moved to 87th Street and Harlem Avenue in Chicago. The school's students played an important role in both developing Chicago's black aviation community and fighting for equality and the growth of black aviation nationwide.

This was considered the birth of these events, which would begin to be called of this way on the next year. After the Youth Jubilee celebrated in Rome the year before on the occasion of the Holy Year, Pope John Paul II organized a youth gathering for Palm Sunday in 1985 coinciding with the International Youth Year proclaimed by the UN. Before the event Before the young people arrived in Rome, the Pope issued on December 8, 1984, a message for the World Day of Peace devoted to the young. Then John Paul II invited the youth to Palm Sunday to Rome for the World Youth Meeting. The Pope chose Palm Sunday as the date of the meeting because in the previous year, just on Palm Sunday, the Catholic Church celebrated the Jubilee of the Youth, celebrated on the occasion of the Holy Year 1983/1984 (1950 anniversary of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ). The program=Saturday 30 March= The Pope met the young Catholics for the first time in Archbasilica of St. John Lateran at 5:00 pm. The slogan of this great meeting were the words: May you know how to realize the hope that is in you (1 Peter 3:15). During this meeting the apostolic letter \\"To the young people of the world\\", written by the Pope for the occasion, was presented firstly to those present. During the following night, there was the possibility for young people to watch in eucharistic adoration at some churches in the city. =Sunday, March 31= The following morning, starting at 6:00 WYJ participants formed three parades, which joined at Via della Conciliazione to reach St. Peter's Square together - where the final mass would be celebrated. The sources attest in the morning the presence of about 250,000/ 300,000[Source ANSA, reported in The Revolution in a Day, Pino Vicentini, Avvenire, Friday 11 August 2000.] people from 70 countries, mostly Italians; but there were about twenty thousand Spaniards and five thousand pilgrims from Eastern European countries (primarily Poland, Yugoslavia and Hungary). Young people from Alaska, Lebanon were also present in Rome, as also from Africa and the Far East. Also noteworthy are the presence of other Christian confessions (especially English Protestants), and even non-Christians (including four hundred Japanese Buddhists). The event Although it is not a real WYJ (it is considered a sort of \\"zero edition\\"), this meeting has some traits that will characterize all future international events of WYD: for example, participants are given a \\"pilgrim's bag\\" and a cap with the logo of the day; for hospitality to pilgrims a network of accommodation facilities in the area is activated; an anthem is composed for the occasion. The anthem The song \\"Resta qui com noi\\" by the musical group Gen Rosso (texts by V. Cipr√¨ and music by B. Enderle) was composed for the gathering and inaugurated the tradition of adopting an official anthem for each World Youth Day. The establishment of WYDs Given the success of the day, the Pope on next December 20 officially proclaimed the establishment of the World Youth Days, which will be held every year in all the dioceses of the world on Palm Sunday (in 1986 it would be called the alternation on two-year cycle diocesan editions and world editions in a city selected by the Pontifical Council for the Laity).

By this point of his career, Rivera's record was 23-0-1 with 14 knockout wins; he was a highly regarded contender for the WBC world Welterweight title held by Pernell Whitaker, and the local press in Puerto Rico widely speculated about the outcome of a bout between the two. =Fights with Pernell Whitaker for world title= Rivera's first world championship fight was held on April 12, 1996, at the Atlantis Casino, Cupecoy Bay, in the island of St. Maarten, in front of an exclusive crowd of 1,000 casino guests. The fight was televised to Puerto Rico and the United States on HBO Boxing. Commentators Jim Lampley, Larry Merchant and George Foreman did not expect a Rivera victory. After twelve rounds, however, Rivera had impressed the HBO team enough to have HBO's unofficial judge, Harold Lederman, score the bout for Rivera, 115-113. Whitaker, however, was given a very controversial 12 round split decision win, with judges Tamotsu Tomihara (116-111) and George St. Aude (115-113) scoring for the champion and judge Barbara Perez scoring for Rivera, 115-112. Due to the closeness of their first fight, and to the protests raised by boxing magazines both in Latin America and the United States (Rivera was even called the \\"uncrowned champion\\" on some outlets), the World Boxing Council ordered an immediate rematch. The second Rivera-Whitaker bout was fought at the James Knight Convention Center in Miami, Florida. At stake was not only the WBC world Welterweight title but also a big money fight versus WBC world Junior Welterweight champion Oscar de La Hoya, who was planning to challenge the rematch's winner. Rivera dropped the champion in round five with a body blow that landed after Whitaker apparently tripped on Rivera's left foot. Whitaker then responded by dropping Rivera with a left to the chin in round six. Rivera also lost a point during that round for a low blow. Once again, Whitaker pulled a very close and somewhat controversial, but this time unanimous, decision win over 12 rounds to retain the WBC world welterweight title, with scores of 115-113 by Masakazu Ushida, 113-112 by Jay Kassees, and 115-111 by John Keene. Had Rivera not lost a point and been dropped in round six, this bout would have ended in a draw (tie) and possibly a third match between Rivera and Whitaker (by losing points due to the low blow and the fall, Rivera lost the chance of having the bout scored 114-113 for him by Kassees and 115-115 by Ushida, which, added to Keene's score-which would have read 115-113 for Whitaker-would have caused the bout to be ruled a tie). HBO's unofficial judge, Harold Lederman, also notably, this time scored the bout for Whitaker by a score of 116-109. The next year, Whitaker lost his world title to De La Hoya by way of yet another very controversial but unanimous decision. =Further career= On March 22, 1997, Rivera was matched with the legendary but shopworn former WBA world Lightweight champion Livingstone Bramble at El Condado, San Juan. Rivera dominated this bout, scoring a third-round knockout win over his experienced foe, who had beaten International Boxing Hall of Fame member Ray Mancini twice and who sported a 38-19-2 record into this fight. On April 19, 1997, Rivera faced Alex Lubo, a 10-1 contender who hoped to upset Rivera and enter the Welterweight top 10 rankings himself. Rivera halted Lubo, winning by technical knockout to continue having a spot among the WBC's top ten Welterweight championship contenders, and followed that win with a knockout victory against 24-15 -2 journeyman Benjie Marquez on July 25, also at San Juan. On September 12, Rivera faced Mark Hammon, a veteran journeyman with a record of 38 wins and 12 losses. If Rivera could get past Hammon, a fight with WBC world Welterweight champion Oscar De La Hoya would be signed. With such an opportunity lurking on the horizon, Rivera made his Caesars Palace hotel debut in Las Vegas, dispatching Hammon by knockout. =Challenge of Oscar De la Hoya= Rivera next signed to face the WBC world Welterweight champion, Oscar De la Hoya, in what constituted Rivera's third world title try. A massive promotional tour followed in which Rivera and De La Hoya got acquainted; they generally got along well during their tour, which included a stop in New York City where the two friends decided to leave their press conferences' premises and join a passing carriage, from where they took a sightseeing tour of the city. This moment was recorded by ESPN camera crews and shown on their Sportscenter highlights. Their bout was held on December 6, 1997 at the Caesars Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey and broadcast live on HBO Pay Per View. Once again, little chance was given to Rivera by the boxing press and fans alike; he did, however, trade blows evenly with De La Hoya for a good portion of the bout, falling in round four but getting up and battling it out until round eight, when the bout was stopped due to a cut (which had been caused by a De La Hoya punch) bleeding too profusely for Rivera to continue, therefore Rivera lost the fight by an eighth-round technical knockout. De La Hoya was winning the bout by a substantial number of points on the judges' scorecards when the fight was stopped. Following the fight with De La Hoya, Rivera crossed gloves with come-backing future International Boxing Hall of Fame member, former WBC world Welterweight champion, 31-3-3, 19 knockout wins rival Carlos Palomino, by then a Hollywood actor who had recently been a boxing commissioner for the California State Athletic Commission and who was undefeated in four bouts, including a first-round knockout over former world champion Rene Arredondo, during his late 1990s boxing comeback. Rivera-Palomino was held at the historic Olympic Auditorium at Los Angeles, California, and Rivera convinced the Mexican legend to re- retire, beating him by ten round unanimous decision. On April 21, 1999, Rivera faced future North American Boxing Federation Junior Middleweight (Super Welterweight) champion,http://boxrec.com/en/boxer/807 Mexican prospect, 13-0 Angel Hernandez at Rosemont, Illinois, beating Hernandez on points. On July 16, 1999, Rivera fought a mismatch against 14-34-1 triailhorse Jimmy Morgan, who was stopped by the Puerto Rican at the Radisson Hotel, in Evansville, Indiana. Then Rivera faced Shane Mosley, the former IBF world lightweight champion who had moved to the Welterweight division. A world title chance was at stake when Mosley and Rivera matched punches at the Pechanga Entertainment Center in Temecula, California on September 25, 1999 (Oscar De La Hoya had lost his title to another Puerto Rican, Felix Trinidad, Jr. at their bout one week before). Mosley-Rivera was also televised by HBO Boxing. In a bruising affair, Rivera won three of the first nine rounds on HBO's unofficial judge Harold Lederman's card before being overcome by Mosley in round 10 by knockout. Mosley went on to conquer the WBC world Welterweight title in the summer of 2000 by outpointing De La Hoya, who had beaten Derrell Coley and had the WBC reinstate him as world welterweight champion after Trinidad, Jr. vacated it to move on to the Junior Middleweight division. =Fight against Fernando Vargas= Rivera took off some time after the action-packed loss at the hands of Mosley, returning ten months after with a win on July 21, 2000, against 16-15 Gerald Coleman by technical knockout at the Harrah's hotel and Casino in Reno, Nevada, a victory that he followed with one over the veteran Rob Bleakley, who, with a record of 77 wins, 29 losses and one draw was making his 108th bout against Rivera when they met on January 7, 2001 at Nashville, Tennessee. Rivera outpointed Bleakley over ten rounds, setting up a ten-round bout against former IBF world Junior Middleweight champion \\"Ferocious Fernando Vargas\\". The Rivera-Vargas bout took place on May 5, 2001 at the Don Haskins Convention Center in El Paso, Texas. Rivera almost caused an upset when he dropped the heavily favored Vargas in round two of their bout, but Vargas rose from the canvas to win by sixth-round knockout in a fight broadcast on HBO Boxing After Dark. =Last fights= Rivera had five bouts after the Vargas loss, going 3-2 with one knockout win in those five bouts, which included a technical knockout loss to 20-4 Alfredo Cuevas on July 19, 2002 for the vacant United States Boxing Organization's Junior Middleweight title in a bout held at Chicago, Illinois. Rivera retired a winner after defeating Darien Ford (10-11 coming in) by unanimous decision at Allentown, Pennsylvania on July 10, 2005. He had a record of 35 wins, 7 losses and 1 draw, with 21 wins by way of knockout. After boxing Rivera worked as a security guard for some time once his boxing career was over. He faced a divorce from his wife and was fired from the job as a security guard, ending up homeless for some time. He lived in his van, a blue Chevrolet Astro, in Carolina, Puerto Rico. He was born with a stuttering condition, which led to many prospective employers thinking he is punch drunk,http://www.primerahora.com/deportes/boxeo/nota/wilfredoriveraquieresalirdelhoyo- video-923309/ References Living people 1969 births Puerto Rican male boxers ","title":"Wilfredo Rivera"},{"id":"56418797","text":"Maria Araujo Kahn is an Associate Justice of the Connecticut Supreme Court.

Education Huang studied political science at National Taiwan University. Political career and activism Huang ran for a seat on the Legislative Yuan in 1980, a year after his elder brother Huang Hsin-chieh was arrested for leading the Kaohsiung Incident. Relatives of other people involved in the Kaohsiung Incident also contested the 1980 election cycle and won, namely Chou Ching-yu and Hsu Jung-shu. While in office, Huang published several magazines affiliated with the tangwai movement, among them Vertical-Horizontal, Political Monitor, and Bell Drum Tower. Copies of the fifth issue of Bell Drum Tower were confiscated by the Kuomintang party-state in May 1983, and Political Monitor was suspended in November. After losing reelection in December, Huang founded Neo Formosa Weekly in June 1984. Neo Formosa Weekly also drew the attention of the government, which banned all but one of its 52 issues. On 19 June 1984, \\"A Critique of New Marxism\\" was published in Neo Formosa Weekly, accusing Elmer Fung of plagiarism. Fung sued the magazine for libel in October. On 12 January 1985, the Taipei District Court sentenced Chen Shui-bian, Lee I-yang and Huang Tien-fu to a year's imprisonment. Upon appeal to the Taiwan High Court, all three sentences were shortened to eight months. The trio were released in February 1987.

In February Brunswick took aboard Colonel Hatton and 350 officers and men of the 1st Battalion of the 66th Regiment of Foot to carry them to Ceylon.Publications (1902), Vol. 20, pp.342-365. Brunswick sailed from Portsmouth on 20 March 1804, bound for Ceylon and China. She was one of a convoy of eight East Indiamen, all under escort by . Other East Indiamen in the convoy included , , and . On 11 April Lapwing left the convoy. Captain Grant, as senior EIC captain, became the Commodore of the East Indiamen. On 23 June the East Indiamen were in the Mozambique Channel when they encountered a French brig. Brunswick gave chase and after seven hours captured the brig Charlotte. She was armed with four guns and had a crew of 29 men under the command of Captain Maquette. She was 28 days out from Isle de France (Mauritius), with a cargo of old muskets and other goods that she was intending to trade for slaves. Two days later the British captains decided that Charlotte was not worth keeping, so they had the muskets thrown overboard and returned her to her captain and crew, who quickly sailed away. Brunswick arrived at Trincomalee on 17 July. An officer from came on board and pressed ten crew men. The next day the 66th Regiment disembarked, and Brunswick lost three more crew members who deserted to join . Brunswick sailed and arrived at Madras Roads on 20 July. There an officer from came on board and pressed four seamen. Brunswick sailed for China on 13 August as part of a convoy that included Canton and , and five country ships. and provided an escort. On 23 September the convoy was off Pedro Branco. There it joined with several more vessels that formed a fleet of five warships (including the 74-gun ), seven East Indiamen, and ten country ships. Brunswick anchored below the Second Bar on 12 October. The next day she grounded on the Second Bar as she went up to Whampoa. Two other Indiamen grounded as well. Brunswick was gotten off on 14 October and she arrived at Whampoa Reach on 19 October. On 1 January 1805 Brunswick sailed through the Bocca Tigris. On 4 January she arrived at Lintin Island. On 21 January the fleet arrived at Penang. Shortly after leaving Penang on 28 January, Brunswick became leaky and sailed to Bombay for repairs rather than going on to the Cape. At Bombay she underwent repairs while her cargo transshipped with two other homeward bound Indiamen, and . By the time the repairs were done it was too late Brunswick to sail back to England so the Bombay Government decided to have her sail back to China to pick up a new cargo. Unfortunately for Brunswick she had to draw on French prisoners of war at Bombay for the repair of her sails. (The Royal Navy had impressed more of her crew.) After the French had finished their work, but before she sailed, the French were put on the cartel Prime and sent to √éle de France for exchange for British prisoners. Contre-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Durand Linois in his flagship Marengo intercepted Prime, distributing the prisoners between Marengo and the frigate , which was in company. They were cruising to raid British commerce, and from the former prisoners Linois learned of Brunswicks imminent departure and probable route. Brunswick, , and the two country ships Cambrian and James Drummond sailed from Bombay on 1 July 1805, bound for China. On 4 July the two country ships separated and Brunswick and Sarah proceeded in company. On 11 July they were off Point de Galle when they encountered Marengo and Belle Poule. Marengo quickly captured Brunswick. Grant fired only one shot and then struck. Brunswick had perhaps 20 Europeans seamen in her crew, the Royal Navy having pressed at Bombay most of the crew she had brought out from England. The remainder of her crew were Chinese and lascars. The Chinese manned the guns with a European at each gun. The remainder and the lascars were on the upper deck for the general defense of the ship. Grant had no choice but to strike; it would have been wasteful with lives for an undermanned East Indiaman such as Brunswick to engage in combat with a 74-gun ship of the line. Linois took Grant and most of his officers on to Marengo. He left her doctor to tend to the Chinese and lascars, and the fourth officer to command them, all under the oversight and control of a French prize crew. At the same time as Marengo was taking control of Brunswick, Belle Poule set out to capture Sarah, which was further to windward. Captain C.C. M'Intosh sailed Sarah straight on to the shore north of Point de Galle. The French believed her totally lost and sailed off. Sarahs crew and cargo were saved. It is unclear whether she herself was later salved.Parkinson (1954), pp.266-8. At the time of her capture Brunswick had no EIC cargo on board.Reports... (1830), Vol 2, p.977. A listing of prizes taken by Linois's squadron in the Indies describes Brunswick as an Indiaman of 1,100 tons (bm), with a cargo of cotton and sandalwood. It gave the value of her loss as 30,000 piastres. On 18 July Brunswick and her prize crew parted. On 7 August Marengo and Belle Poule met a British convoy of Indiamen bound for Madras under the escort of , under the command of Rear-admiral Thomas Troubridge. An inconclusive engagement developed at . Linois could not risk damage to his vessels as repair would be difficult, and Troubridge didn't want to risk the Indiamen. Both sides broke off the engagement and Linois sailed to St Augustine's Bay, Madagascar, hoping to find Brunswick there. When he did not, he sailed on to the Cape. Loss Marengo and Belle Poule arrived at the Simon's Bay on 29 August, or 13 September.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4277. There they awaited the arrival of Brunswick and .Parkinson (1954), p.272. Brunswick arrived on 2 September but a gale drove her on shore at Simon's Bay. Her wreck and cargo were sold for 3,500 rix dollars to an American captain that had arrived at the Cape. Post script On 1 November the 32 officers and crew from Brunswick went on board Eliza, an American ship under the command of Captain Chase. On the 18th they arrived at St Helena. There they boarded the frigate , Captain George Cockburn. Phaeton was also carrying the Marquis of Wellesley and his suite, who was returning to England after having served as Governor General of India. They arrived at Spithead on 13 January 1806.

It is the 22nd overall episode of the series and is written by Gabe Liedman & Gil Ozeri and directed by Akiva Schaffer. It aired on Fox in the United States on March 25, 2014. The show revolves around the fictitious 99th precinct of the New York Police Department in Brooklyn and the officers and detectives that work in the precinct. Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) is an immature yet very talented detective in the precinct with an astounding record of crimes solved, putting him in a competition with fellow detective Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero). The precinct's status changes when the Captain is retiring and a new commanding officer, Cpt. Raymond Holt (Andre Braugher) is appointed as the newest Captain. This creates a conflict between Jake and Holt over their respective methods in the field. In the episode, Jake investigates a civil leader who may have affiliations to drug trafficking but is told by the Deputy Commissioner to drop the case. When he is caught investigating, he is on danger of being expelled from the police. Meanwhile, Boyle acts depressed after Vivian cancels their wedding. The episode was seen by an estimated 2.59 million household viewers and gained a 1.3/4 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49, according to Nielsen Media Research. The episode received critical acclaim from critics, who praised the cast, the writing and the directing, citing it as a satisfying conclusion to the season. Plot Jake arrives drunk at a bar, where he decides to buy drinks for everyone present. He tells the man next to him that he has just lost his job. One week earlier, Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio) informs the precinct that Vivian (Marilu Henner) dumped him and that he is single again. Jake meets with Holt and Deputy Commissioner Podolski (James Michael Connor) to discuss his recent investigation into Lucas Wint (Ian Roberts), a civic leader who may be involved in money laundering. Because he has been harassing Wint, Jake is told to abandon the case, as it is just considered gossip. He continues investigating anyway but is caught and suspended for six months on administrative leave. Still determined to crack the case, Jake enlists an unnaturally rebellious Amy and a reluctant Captain Holt to help him uncover more evidence, but Holt uncovers a larger conspiracy that will require a greater sacrifice from Jake in order to solve the case. Jake feigns not getting information and is fired from the precinct. However, this was a ruse as he will need to help the FBI to arrest the Ianucci crime family in undercover operations. Before leaving, Jake confesses his feelings to Amy. Meanwhile, Terry (Terry Crews), Gina (Chelsea Peretti) and Rosa (Stephanie Beatriz) help Boyle to move on. Later, Boyle and Gina discover to their shock that they slept together. Reception=Viewers= In its original American broadcast, \\"Charges and Specs\\" was seen by an estimated 2.59 million household viewers and gained a 1.3/4 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49, according to Nielsen Media Research. This was a slight increase in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 2.49 million viewers with a 1.2/3 in the 18-49 demographics. This means that 1.3 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 4 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it. With these ratings, Brooklyn Nine-Nine was the most watched show on FOX for the night, beating Glee and New Girl, fourth on its timeslot and seventh for the night, behind Growing Up Fisher, About a Boy, Person of Interest, NCIS: Los Angeles, NCIS, and The Voice. =Critical reviews= \\"Charges and Specs\\" received critical acclaim from critics. Roth Cornet of IGN gave the episode a \\"great\\" 8.8 out of 10 and wrote, \\"Brooklyn Nine-Nine wrapped-up its freshman season with an episode that reflected much of what we've enjoyed about the series all year. The relationships simultaneously went to some interesting places and remained faithful to what had been established previously. The writers have managed to justify the time that will elapse before we see these lovable maniacs next and have left plenty of room for big changes at the start of next season.\\" Molly Eichel of The A.V. Club gave the episode an \\"A\\" grade and wrote, \\"For a show that's strength was its ensemble from the very beginning, Brooklyn Nine-Nine ended its first season near-perfectly. Every character in its considerably deep arsenal was used exactly how they should have been, with each character getting a chance to show off before the show goes on hiatus for the summer. Not only did each character get the proper hiatus send-off and 'Charges And Specs' have real stakes, but the show also set up the second season on a trajectory for a strong start for what's to come.\\" Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote, \\"That's how you do a sitcom season finale, boys and girls. 'Charges and Specs' probably wasn't the funniest episode of the season, but it brought a bunch of character arcs to a head, gave most of the cast members a moment to shine, and ended in a place that could (as Schur notes in our interview) either fuel a whole bunch of stories at the start of next year or be waved away quickly if the writers aren't feeling it.\\" Andy Crump of Paste gave the episode a 9.8 and wrote, \\"There's an impressive maturity to how season one of Brooklyn Nine-Nine bids its major and minor players adieu, and maybe more than anything else, that's what will make the wait for season two tough. We know that this series can make us laugh, we know it's capable of producing fully drawn characters; what 'Charges and Specs' demonstrates is just how much the series is objective- driven in addition to being comedy-driven and character-driven. If the next go-round with the people of the Nine-Nine precinct maintains these qualities, then we're going to be in for a stellar ride.\\" ReferencesExternal links 2014 American television episodes Brooklyn Nine- Nine (season 1) episodes ","title":"Charges and Specs"},{"id":"56419213","text":"Famoso may refer to: * Famoso Raceway, a dragstrip is located north of Bakersfield, California * Famoso, California, an unincorporated community in Kern County, California * El Famoso, the nickname of Carlos Hern√°ndez (boxer) ","title":"Famoso"},{"id":"56419247","text":"Maude is a locality on the Goyder Highway in the Mid North region of South Australia.

The centre came under criticism in the 2000s for \\"barbaric\\" and \\"degrading\\"conditions and was replaced by a new 60-bed youth training centre at Cavan in 2012. History=1869: First institution= The first official State institution for children in South Australia, completed in 1869, was the Magill Industrial School, as a home for children who were destitute, neglected or orphaned and placed in State care, but not yet placed in foster homes or in employment. They had previously been housed in the Grace Darling Hotel in Brighton. The Girls' Reformatory, Magill, shared the site from 1881 to 1891 as did the Boys' Reformatory, Magill, from 1869 to 1880. Misbehaving boys in the Industrial School were placed in the Reformatory. =1880‚Äì1891: The Fitzjames= Between 1880 and 1891, the boys were moved to a moored hulk called the Fitzjames at Largs Bay, with the girls remaining at Magill. The Fitzjames was a wooden sailing ship built in 1852 which carried more than 1,800 immigrants from England to Australia. After leaking badly in 1866 it was declared unseaworthy and condemned and left to rot on the Yarra River. It was purchased by the South Australian Government in 1876 as a quarantine ship and used to temporarily house immigrants with infectious diseases. Between 1880 and 1891 the hulk was used to house boys convicted of crimes or determined to be \\"uncontrollable\\". Pumps were operated by the boys for up to three hours a day to expel water that was leaking into the hulk and keep it from sinking. Because of its poor conditions, the hulk became known as \\"Hell afloat\\". A Royal Commission was ordered into the Destitute Board in 1883 which found the boys at Fitzjames in \\"pallid and dull appearance\\" and conditions described as \\"depressing\\" with \\"wearisome monotony of life\\", \\"gross improprieties\\" between younger children and older youths and officers, \\"deplorable\\" education standards and \\"defects in the dietary and want of open-air exercise\\". The Way Commission tabled its report in State Parliament in 1885. The report recommended Fitzjames' immediate closure and relocation of the boys to a land-based facility. Six years later the boys were removed from the Fitzjames and moved back to the site of the Magill Industrial School. =1891‚Äì1967= In 1891 a new Girls' Reformatory was built in Edwardstown, South Australia,, and the Industrial School was moved into the girls' quarters at Magill, once again sharing the site with the Boys' Reformatory. The Training School moved to Edwardstown in 1898 (renamed Glandore in 1949). =1967‚Äì2000s= In 1967 the site was established as the McNally Training Centre, for boys aged 15‚Äì18 sentenced by Juvenile Court or being held on remand. Younger boys aged 9‚Äì15 were sent to Brookway Park. In 1979 the McNally Training Centre became the South Australian Youth Training Centre (SAYTC) for youths aged between 15‚Äì18. In 1993 the site became the Magill Training Centre to house young people aged 10‚Äì14, and the boys aged 15‚Äì18 were moved to a new purpose-built facility, the Cavan Training Centre. Young women from the South Australian Youth Remand and Assessment Centre (SAYRAC) were moved to Magill and housed at a separate section of the Centre when SAYRAC closed. By the 2000s, the department acknowledged the need for a replacement facility for the ageing institution, and incidents at the facility between 2004 and 2008 were investigated for the Children in State Care Commission of Inquiry. Criticisms and controversies In addition to the criticisms of the Fitzjames Reformatory Hulk in the Way Commission Report tabled in South Australian Parliament in 1885, the Adelaide Boys' Reformatory, South Australian Youth Training Centre, McNally Training Centre and Magill Youth Training Centre all received significant public criticism throughout their history. For example, in 1933 a former police superintendent described the then Adelaide Boys' Reformatory as \\"an institution for bad boys to make others bad.\\" The South Australian Children's Welfare and Public Relief Board was aware of sexual abuse at the site in the late 1940s and early 1950s. In 1969, after 10 boys absconded from McNally Training Centre, the superintendent at the time advocated the reintroduction of caning and the Minister of Social Welfare approved the policy, despite objections of the acting director of Social Welfare who held that caning was \\"degrading\\" and \\"contrary to modern methods of treatment of offenders.\\" Boys were placed in \\"the cabin\\" or \\"the dungeon\\", a solitary confinement cell, for up to 48 hours if they had absconded or were seen as potential absconders. One boy aged 14 held in the centre in the early 1960s reported he was stripped naked and placed in solitary confinement for three days as a punishment for an attempted breakout. By 1983 corporal punishment was prohibited again, although children could still be placed in detention for up to eight hours. A Commission of Inquiry was held into Children in State Care and Children on APY Lands led by the Hon EP Mullighan QC and tabled in South Australian Parliament in 2008. The commission heard from ten people held in the Magill Reformatory in 1950s and 1960s who were sexually abused or raped by staff and older boys. The physical conditions were described as \\"run down\\", \\"appalling\\", and \\"a very, very sad place\\", with cells two by three metres in size, and windows too high for small children to see out of. Calls for closure After a tour of the site by Australia's Youth Representative to the United Nations, Chris Varney, in 2009, the Centre was described as \\"the worst of its kind\\" and a \\"living human rights abuse\\". In 2009 more than 40 welfare groups and individuals including the Executive Director of the Youth Affairs Council of South Australia and Chief Executive Officer of Anglicare SA signed an open letter to the South Australian Premier calling for a closure of the site for its appalling conditions and contravention of the United Nations Convention of the Rights of the Child. The South Australian Guardian for Children described the centre as \\"barbaric\\", and \\"a blight on the state\\" and the Social Inclusion Commission described the conditions there as \\"deplorable\\". MP Mark Parnell called it \\"barbaric\\" and \\"degrading\\". Amidst these criticisms, the then South Australian Minister for Families and Communities Jennifer Rankine described support available for young offenders as \\"second to none\\" and a spokesperson for Rankine stated that while \\"it's clear the Magill Youth Training Centre needs to be replaced in time\\" that the state budget \\"does not provide for that and there will be no change of heart\\". The site was closed in 2012, after the announcement of a new $67 million 60-bed facility to be constructed in Cavan to replace the Magill Youth Training Centre and Cavan Training Centre, at Cavan.

Opened in 2000, it sits next to the Goongoongup railway bridge which was built in 1995. A joint venture between Transfield and Thiess Contractors was selected to construct the bridge from a short-list of three parties. Construction began in 1998. The incrementally-launched bridge is long with nine spans and comprises two prestressed concrete box girders on two rows of piers. A dual-use pedestrian/cycle pathway is located beneath the main deck. The bridge is named after Windan, a wife of Yellagonga (sometimes spelt Yallgunga), chief of the Mooro tribe. Her body was buried around the area, according to her wish. The name was chosen in consultation with Noongar elders as part of the Graham Farmer Freeway project. A naming ceremony was held on 9 April 2000 where a plaque was unveiled and a traditional Aboriginal smoking ceremony performed. The opening of the Graham Farmer Freeway and Windan Bridge was celebrated with a community open day on 22 April 2000 where the public could walk or cycle through the Graham Farmer tunnel and across the bridge. The freeway and bridge was open to traffic the following day.

The rectangular, north-facing temple is saptayatana (seven shrine) type with one central large shrine surrounded by six smaller shrines. It is on low platform (jagati). This temple with multiple shrines may be modification of either panchayatana (five shrine) type with addition of shrines in east and south of the central shrine or ashtayatana (eight shrine) type with replacement of eighth shrine with the flight of the steps to access the temple from north. The jagati is buttressed on north and south. The enclosing wall which once connects the shrines. The central shrine has pancharatha (five-fold) plan. It is the earliest known five-fold planned temple in the region. It has old style vedibandha (the lowest socle or foundation block) and almost plain mandovara (middle of the outer wall of shrine). The shikhara (spire) and sukhasana (assembly seats) are also in ruins. The mandapa (roof above the assembly hall) is now restored with its Bhadraka style pillars with their lintels are still surviving. The temple once housed Saptamatrikas. The pithika of it is still there. The doorway is plain and without any ornamentation. The eastern shrine was probably for Nandi. History M. A. Dhaky and J. M. Nanavati opines that \\"Maga\\" in the name of the temple suggests that it may be connected to Maga Brahmins who were worshippers of Surya (solar deity) and immigrants from Iran to western India. So the temple may have been the Sun temple. It may have been the Shiva temple as well. The temple is currently belongs to Shiva. The spire of the temple has more elaborate lattice work than the Sutrapada temple and less elaborate work than the Roda temples. As Roda temples are placed in the last quarter of the eighth century, so this temple is placed in the middle of the eighth century by Dhaky and Nanavati. So the temple was constructed during the Maitraka period.

Divers operate in an environment for which the human body is not well suited. They face special physical and health risks when they go underwater or use high pressure breathing gas. The consequences of diving incidents range from merely annoying to rapidly fatal, and the result often depends on the equipment, skill, response and fitness of the diver and diving team. The classes of hazards include the aquatic environment, the use of breathing equipment in an underwater environment, exposure to a pressurised environment and pressure changes, particularly pressure changes during descent and ascent, and breathing gases at high ambient pressure. Diving equipment other than breathing apparatus is usually reliable, but has been known to fail, and loss of buoyancy control or thermal protection can be a major burden which may lead to more serious problems. There are also hazards of the specific diving environment, and hazards related to access to and egress from the water, which vary from place to place, and may also vary with time. Hazards inherent in the diver include pre-existing physiological and psychological conditions and the personal behaviour and competence of the individual. For those pursuing other activities while diving, there are additional hazards of task loading, of the dive task and of special equipment associated with the task. The presence of a combination of several hazards simultaneously is common in diving, and the effect is generally increased risk to the diver, particularly where the occurrence of an incident due to one hazard triggers other hazards with a resulting cascade of incidents. Many diving fatalities are the result of a cascade of incidents overwhelming the diver, who should be able to manage any single reasonably foreseeable incident. Although there are many dangers involved in diving, divers can decrease the risks through effective procedures and appropriate equipment. The requisite skills are acquired by training and education, and honed by practice. Entry level recreational diving certification programmes highlight diving physiology, safe diving practices, and diving hazards, but do not provide the diver with sufficient practice to become truly adept. Professional diver training provides more practice, but continued experience and practice of essential skills is necessary to develop reliable response to contingencies. Changes in pressure Divers must avoid injuries caused by changes in pressure. The weight of the water column above the diver causes an increase in pressure in proportion to depth, in the same way that the weight of the column of atmospheric air above the surface causes a pressure of 101.3 kPa (14.7 pounds-force per square inch) at sea level. This variation of pressure with depth will cause compressible materials and gas filled spaces to tend to change volume, which can cause the surrounding material or tissues to be stressed, with the risk of injury if the stress gets too high. Pressure injuries are called barotrauma and can be quite painful or debilitating, even potentially fatal ‚Äì in severe cases causing a ruptured lung, eardrum or damage to the sinuses. To avoid barotrauma, the diver equalises the pressure in all air spaces with the surrounding water pressure when changing depth. The middle ear and sinus are equalised using one or more of several techniques, which is referred to as clearing the ears. The scuba mask (half-mask) is equalised during descent by periodically exhaling through the nose. During ascent it will automatically equalise by leaking excess air round the edges. A helmet or full face mask will automatically equalise as any pressure differential will either vent through the exhaust valve or open the demand valve and release breathing gas for into the low-pressure space. An insufficient gas supply for the descent rate can lead to helmet squeeze. This was more of a problem with manual air pumps, and often associated with a fall off the edge of a relatively high place by a diver in standard diving equipment with a lot of slack in the lifeline. Another barotrauma hazard is helmet squeeze caused by a shallow rupture of the surface-supplied breathing gas hose and simultaneous failure of the non-return valve at the helmet, which can cause a large pressure difference between the helmet interior and the rupture. If a drysuit is worn, it must be equalised by inflation and deflation, much like a buoyancy compensator. Most dry suits are fitted with an auto-dump valve, which, if set correctly, and kept at the high point of the diver by good trim skills, will automatically release gas as it expands and retain a virtually constant volume during ascent. During descent the dry suit must be inflated manually unless sealed to the helmet. Effects of breathing high-pressure gas Breathing high-pressure gas constitutes a hazard with associated risks of decompression sickness, nitrogen narcosis, oxygen toxicity and high-pressure nervous syndrome. =Decompression sickness= Exterior of a deck decompression chamber The prolonged exposure to breathing gases at high partial pressure will result in increased amounts of non-metabolic gases, usually nitrogen and/or helium, (referred to in this context as inert gases) dissolving in the bloodstream as it passes through the alveolar capillaries, and thence carried to the other tissues of the body, where they will accumulate until saturated. This saturation process has very little immediate effect on the diver. However, when the pressure is reduced during ascent, the amount of dissolved inert gas that can be held in stable solution in the tissues is reduced. This effect is described by Henry's Law. As a consequence of the reducing partial pressure of inert gases in the lungs during ascent, the dissolved gas will be diffused back from the bloodstream to the gas in the lungs and exhaled. The reduced gas concentration in the blood has a similar effect when it passes through tissues carrying a higher concentration, and that gas will diffuse back into the bloodstream, reducing the loading of the tissues. As long as this process is gradual, the tissue gas loading in the diver will reduce by diffusion and perfusion until it eventually re-stabilises at the current saturation pressure. The problem arises when the pressure is reduced more quickly than the gas can be removed by this mechanism, and the level of supersaturation rises sufficiently to become unstable. At this point, bubbles may form and grow in the tissues, and may cause damage either by distending the tissue locally, or blocking small blood vessels, shutting off blood supply to the downstream side, and resulting in hypoxia of those tissues. Divers inside a recompression chamber This effect is called decompression sickness or 'the bends', and must be avoided by reducing the pressure on the body slowly while ascending and allowing the inert gases dissolved in the tissues to be eliminated while still in solution. This process is known as \\"off-gassing\\", and is done by restricting the ascent (decompression) rate to one where the level of supersaturation is not sufficient for bubbles to form or grow. This level is only known statistically, and may vary for reasons which are not well understood. The level of supersaturation limited by controlling the speed of ascent and making periodic stops to allow gases to be eliminated by respiration. The procedure of making stops is called staged decompression, and the stops are called decompression stops. Decompression stops that are not computed as strictly necessary are called safety stops, and reduce the risk of bubble formation further at the cost of a longer ascent time, greater gas consumption and in many cases greater exposure to other hazards. Dive computers or decompression tables are used to determine a relatively safe ascent profile, but are not completely reliable. There remains a statistical possibility of decompression bubbles forming even when the guidance from tables or computer has been followed exactly. =Nitrogen narcosis= Nitrogen narcosis or inert gas narcosis is a reversible alteration in consciousness producing a state similar to alcohol intoxication in divers who breathe high- pressure gas containing nitrogen or other potentially narcotic gas at raised partial pressures. The mechanism is similar to that of nitrous oxide, or \\"laughing gas,\\" administered as anaesthesia. Being \\"narced\\" can impair judgement and make diving considerably more dangerous. Narcosis starts to affect some divers at about on air. At this depth, narcosis often manifests itself as a slight giddiness. The effects increase with an increase in depth. Almost all divers will notice the effects by . At this depth divers may feel euphoria, anxiety, loss of coordination and/or lack of concentration. At extreme depths, a hallucinogenic reaction, tunnel vision or unconsciousness can occur. Jacques Cousteau famously described it as the \\"rapture of the deep\\". Nitrogen narcosis occurs quickly and the symptoms typically disappear equally quickly during the ascent, so that divers often fail to realise they were ever affected. It affects individual divers at varying depths and conditions, and can even vary from dive to dive under identical conditions. Diving with trimix or heliox reduces the effects, which are proportional to the partial pressure of nitrogen, and probably oxygen, in the breathing gas. =Oxygen toxicity= Oxygen toxicity occurs when the tissues are exposed to an excessive combination of partial pressure (PPO2) and duration. In acute cases it affects the central nervous system and causes a seizure, which can result in the diver losing consciousness, spitting out their regulator and drowning. While the exact limit is not reliably predictable, and is affected by carbon dioxide levels, it is generally recognised that central nervous system oxygen toxicity is preventable if one does not exceed an oxygen partial pressure of 1.4 bar. For deep dives ‚Äì generally past 180 feet (55 m), divers use \\"hypoxic blends\\" containing a lower percentage of oxygen than atmospheric air. A less immediately threatening form known as pulmonary oxygen toxicity occurs after exposures to lower oxygen partial pressures for much longer periods than generally encountered in scuba diving, but is a recognised problem in saturation diving. =High-pressure nervous syndrome= High- pressure nervous syndrome (HPNS ‚Äì also known as high-pressure neurological syndrome) is a neurological and physiological diving disorder that results when a diver descends below about using a breathing gas containing helium. The effects experienced, and the severity of those effects, depend on the rate of descent, the depth and percentage of helium. \\"Helium tremors\\" were first widely described in 1965 by Royal Navy physiologist Peter B. Bennett, who also founded the Divers Alert Network. Russian scientist G. L. Zal'tsman also reported on helium tremors in his experiments from 1961. However, these reports were not available in the West until 1967. The term high-pressure nervous syndrome was first used by Brauer in 1968 to describe the combined symptoms of tremor, electroencephalography (EEG) changes, and somnolence that appeared during a chamber dive in Marseille. Failure of diving equipment The underwater environment presents a constant hazard of asphyxiation due to drowning. Breathing apparatus used for diving is life-support equipment, and failure can have fatal consequences ‚Äì reliability of the equipment and the ability of the diver to deal with a single point of failure are essential for diver safety. Failure of other items of diving equipment is generally not as immediately threatening, as provided the diver is conscious and breathing, there may be time to deal with the situation, however an uncontrollable gain or loss of buoyancy can put the diver at severe risk of decompression sickness, or of sinking to a depth where nitrogen narcosis or oxygen toxicity may render the diver incapable of managing the situation, which may lead to drowning while breathing gas remains available. =Failure of breathing apparatus= Most regulator malfunctions involve improper supply of breathing gas or water leaking into the gas supply. There are two main gas supply failure modes, where the regulator shuts off delivery, which is extremely rare, and free-flow, where the delivery will not stop and can quickly exhaust a scuba supply. The inlet to the cylinder valve may be protected by a sintered filter, and the inlet to the first stage is usually protected by a filter, both to prevent corrosion products or other contaminants in the cylinder from getting into the fine toleranced gaps in the moving parts of the first and second stage and jamming them, either open or closed. If enough dirt gets into these filters they themselves can be blocked sufficiently to reduce performance, but are unlikely to result in a total or sudden catastrophic failure. Sintered bronze filters can also gradually clog with corrosion products if they get wet. Inlet filter blockage will become more noticeable as the cylinder pressure drops. Either of the stages may get stuck in the open position, causing a continuous flow of gas from the regulator known as a free- flow. This can be triggered by a range of causes, some of which can be easily remedied, others not. Possible causes include incorrect interstage pressure setting, incorrect second stage valve spring tension, damaged or sticking valve poppet, damaged valve seat, valve freezing, wrong sensitivity setting at the surface and in Poseidon servo-assisted second stages, low interstage pressure. The moving parts in first and second stages have fine tolerances in places, and some designs are more susceptible to contaminants causing friction between the moving parts. this may increase cracking pressure, reduce flow rate, increase work of breathing or induce free-flow, depending on what part is affected. In cold conditions the cooling effect of gas expanding through a valve orifice may cool either first or second stage sufficiently to cause ice to form. External icing may lock up the spring and exposed moving parts of first or second stage, and freezing of moisture in the air may cause icing on internal surfaces. Either may cause the moving parts of the affected stage to jam open or closed. If the valve freezes closed, it will usually defrost quite rapidly and start working again, and may freeze open soon after. Freezing open is more of a problem, as the valve will then free-flow and cool further in a positive feedback loop, which can normally only be stopped by closing the cylinder valve and waiting for the ice to thaw. If not stopped, the cylinder will rapidly be emptied. A slow leak of the first stage valve known as intermediate pressure creep can cause the interstage pressure to rise until either the next breath is drawn, or the pressure exerts more force on the second stage valve than can be resisted by the spring, and the valve opens briefly, often with a popping sound, to relieve the pressure. the frequency of the popping pressure relief depends on the flow in the second stage, the back pressure, the second stage spring tension and the magnitude of the leak. It may range from occasional loud pops to a constant hiss. Underwater the second stage may be damped by the water and the loud pops may become an intermittent or constant stream of bubbles. This is not usually a catastrophic failure mode, but should be fixed as it will get worse, and it wastes gas. Gas leaks can be caused by burst or leaky hoses, defective o-rings, blown o-rings, particularly in yoke connectors, loose connections, and several of the previously listed malfunctions. Low pressure inflation hoses may fail to connect properly, or the non-return valve may leak. A burst low pressure hose will usually lose gas faster than a burst high pressure hose, as HP hoses usually have a flow restriction orifice in the fitting that screws into the port, as the submersible pressure gauge does not need high flow, and a slower pressure increase in the gauge hose is less likely to overload the gauge, while the hose to a second stage must provide high peak flow rate to minimize work of breathing. A relatively common o-ring failure occurs when the yoke clamp seal extrudes due to insufficient clamp force or elastic deformation of the clamp by impact with the environment. Wet breathing is caused by water getting into the regulator and compromising breathing comfort and safety. Water can leak into the second stage body through damaged soft parts like torn mouthpieces, damaged exhaust valves and perforated diaphragms, through cracked housings, or through poorly sealing or fouled exhaust valves. High work of breathing can be caused by high inhalation resistance, high exhalation resistance or both. High inhalation resistance can be caused by high cracking pressure, low interstage pressure, friction in second stage valve moving parts, excessive spring loading, or sub-optimum valve design. It can usually can be improved by servicing and tuning, but some regulators cannot deliver high flow at great depths without high work of breathing. High exhalation resistance is usually due to a problem with the exhaust valves, which can stick, stiffen due to deterioration of the materials, or may have an insufficient flow passage area for the service. Work of breathing increases with gas density, and therefore with depth. Total work of breathing for the diver is a combination of physiological work of breathing and mechanical work of breathing. It is possible for this combination to exceed the capacity of the diver, who can then suffocate due to carbon dioxide toxicity. Juddering, shuddering and moaning are caused by an irregular and unstable flow from the second stage, which may be caused by a slight positive feedback between flow rate in the second stage body and diaphragm deflection opening the valve, which is not sufficient to cause free-flow, but enough to cause the system to hunt. It is more common on high-performance regulators which are tuned for maximum flow and minimum work of breathing, particularly out of the water, and often reduces or resolves when the regulator is immersed and the ambient water damps the movement of the diaphragm and other moving parts. Desensitising the second stage by closing venturi assists or increasing the valve spring pressure often stops this problem. Juddering may also be caused by excessive but irregular friction of valve moving parts. Physical damage to the housing or components such as cracked housings, torn or dislodged mouthpieces, damaged exhaust fairings, can cause gas flow problems or leaks, or can make the regulator uncomfortable to use or difficult to breathe from. Full-face masks and helmets Flooding of a full-face mask or diving helmet is also a failure of the breathing apparatus that must be corrected immediately, as this interrupts the path of breathing gas to the diver. Depending on the cause of the flood, this may be trivial or difficult to correct. =Failure of depth control equipment= Rapid and uncontrolled depth changes can seriously endanger the diver. An uncontrolled ascent can lead to decompression illness, and uncontrolled descent can take the diver to a depth where the equipment and breathing gas are not appropriate, and can cause debilitating narcosis, acute oxygen toxicity, barotraumas of descent, rapid exhaustion of breathing gas supplies, excessive work of breathing, and inability to surface. These effects can be caused by failures of weighting and buoyancy control equipment. Surface-supplied divers may avoid these problems in many cases by using a bell or stage for vertical travel through the water, but scuba divers need to be appropriately buoyant at all times when in the water. Diving weighting systems can cause problems if the diver carries too much or too little weight, if the weights are dropped at the wrong time, or cannot be dropped when it is necessary. Over and underweighting are common operator errors, often associated with inexperience, poor training, and lack of understanding of the necessary procedures for correct selection of weights. Weighting systems are usually very reliable. Occasionally weights will fall off through no fault of the diver, if a buckle or clip is released through contact with the surroundings. Buoyancy control is the use of adjustable buoyancy equipment to balance equipment which changes buoyancy but is not controlled by the diver, such as changes due to depth and gas consumption. Ballast weight is normally constant during the dive, but buoyancy is adjustable by controlling the volume of gas-filled spaces. It is simple to inflate a gas filled space at ambient pressure to achieve neutral buoyancy, but any change of depth will affect the volume and therefore the buoyancy of the system. The diver must make compensatory adjustments to retain neutral buoyancy whenever the depth varies. Any unintentional change in the gas volume can rapidly escalate a buoyancy imbalance, and the system is inherently unstable. Gas leaks into or out of the buoyancy compensator bladder or dry suit must be corrected before they become uncontrollable. When deploying a DSMB or a lift bag, entanglement and reel jams can prevent free deployment of line. It must be possible to abandon the buoyant equipment to avoid being pulled up too fast. Clipping the reel to the diver increases this risk. =Failure of other equipment= Failures of other diving equipment can endanger the diver, but are generally less immediate in their effect, allowing the diver a reasonable amount of time to compensate. *Thermal insulation and heating: *Communications equipment: For safety and efficiency, divers may need to communicate with others diving with them, or with their surface support team. The interface between air and water is an effective barrier to direct sound transmission, The equipment used by divers and the pressurised environment are also hindrances to sound-based communication. Communication is most critical in an emergency, where high stress levels make effective communication more difficult, and the circumstances of the emergency may make the communication physically more difficult. Voice communication is natural and effective where it is practicable, and most people rely on it for fast and accurate communication in most circumstances. In some cases a voice communications failure is merely an inconvenience, but when it prevents the surface team from ensuring that the diver is safe during the transport of heavy equipment to and from the worksite, it can endanger the diver. In these cases the dive will normally be terminated. *Loss of mask *Loss of fins *Breaking of guideline *Failure of instrumentation - Dive computer, timer, depth gauge, submersible pressure gauge *Failure of dive lights The diving environment=Loss of body heat= Dry suit for reducing exposure Water conducts heat from the diver 25 times more effectively than air, which can lead to hypothermia even in mild water temperatures. Symptoms of hypothermia include impaired judgment and dexterity, which can quickly become deadly in an aquatic environment. In all but the warmest waters, divers need the thermal insulation provided by wetsuits or drysuits. For extreme exposure, active heating can be provided by chemical heat packs or battery powered heated underwear, or by hot-water suits. In the case of a wetsuit, the suit is designed to minimise heat loss. Wetsuits are usually made of foamed neoprene that has small closed bubbles, generally containing nitrogen, trapped in it during the manufacturing process. The poor thermal conductivity of this expanded cell neoprene means that wetsuits reduce loss of body heat by conduction to the surrounding water. The neoprene, and to a larger extent the nitrogen gas in the bubbles, function as an insulator. The effectiveness of the insulation is reduced when the suit is compressed due to depth, as the nitrogen filled bubbles are then smaller and the compressed gas conducts heat better. The second way in which wetsuits can reduce heat loss is to trap the water which leaks into the suit. Body heat then heats the trapped water, and provided the suit is reasonably well-sealed at all openings (neck, wrists, ankles, zippers and overlaps with other suit components), this water remains inside the suit and is not replaced by more cold water, which would also take up body heat, and this helps reduce the rate of heat loss. This principle is applied in the \\"Semi-Dry\\" wetsuit. Use of a wetsuit can add the hazard of loss of buoyancy due to suit compression with depth. Spring suit (short legs and sleeves) and steamer (full legs and sleeves) A dry suit functions by keeping the diver dry. The suit is waterproof and sealed so that water cannot penetrate the suit. Special purpose undergarments are usually worn under a dry suit to keep a layer of air between the diver and the suit for thermal insulation. Some divers carry an extra gas bottle dedicated to filling the dry suit, which may contain argon gas, because it is a better insulator than air. Dry suits should not be inflated with gases containing helium as it is a good thermal conductor. Dry suits fall into two main categories: * Membrane or Shell dry suits are usually a trilaminate or coated textile construction. The material is thin and not a very good insulator, so the insulation is provided by the air trapped in the undersuit. * Neoprene drysuits have a similar construction to wetsuits; these are often considerably thicker (7‚Äì8 mm) and have sufficient inherent insulation to allow a lighter-weight undersuit (or none at all); however on deeper dives the neoprene can compress to as little as 2 mm, losing some of its insulation. Compressed or crushed neoprene may also be used (where the neoprene is pre- compressed to 2‚Äì3 mm) which avoids the variation of insulating properties with depth. These dry suits function more like a membrane suit. Use of a dry suit is associated with the hazards of suit leaks, causing loss of insulation, suit floods, with loss of buoyancy, and suit blow-ups which can cause uncontrolled ascents. Hot-water suits are used in cold water commercial surface-supplied diving. These suits are normally made of foamed neoprene and are similar to wetsuits in construction and appearance, but they do not fit as closely by design. The wrists and ankles of the suit are loose-fitting, allowing water to flush out of the suit as it is replenished with fresh hot water from the surface. A hose in the umbilical line, which links the diver to the surface support, carries the hot water from a heater on the surface down to the suit. The diver controls the flow rate of the water from a valve at the hip, allowing control of the warmth of the suit in response to changes in environmental conditions and workload. Tubes inside the suit distribute the water to the limbs, chest, and back. Special boots, gloves, and hood are worn. Hot-water suits are used for deep dives in cold water when breathing mixes containing helium are used. Helium conducts heat much more efficiently than air, which means that the diver will lose large quantities of body heat through the lungs when breathing it. This fact compounds the risk of hypothermia already present in the cold temperatures found at these depths. Under these conditions a hot water suit is a matter of survival, not comfort. Just as an emergency backup source of breathing gas is required, a backup water heater is also an essential precaution whenever dive conditions warrant a hot water suit. If the heater fails and a backup unit cannot be immediately brought online, a diver in the coldest conditions can succumb to hypothermia within minutes if they cannot get back into a dry bell. Depending on decompression obligations, bringing the diver directly to the surface could prove equally deadly. Heated water in the suit forms an active insulation barrier to heat loss, but the temperature must be regulated within fairly close limits. If the temperature falls below about , hypothermia can result, and temperatures above can cause burn injury to the diver. The diver may not notice a gradual change in inlet temperature, and in the early stages of hypo- or hyperthermia, may not notice the deteriorating condition. The suit is loose fitting to allow unimpeded water flow. This causes a large volume of water (13 to 22 litres) to be held in the suit, which can impede swimming due to the added inertia. When controlled correctly, the hot water suit is safe, comfortable and effective, and allows the diver adequate control of thermal protection. =Injuries due to contact with the solid surroundings= Some parts of the underwater environment are sharp or abrasive, and can damage unprotected skin. Diving suits also help prevent the diver's skin being damaged by rough or sharp underwater objects, marine animals, hard corals, or metal debris commonly found on shipwrecks. Ordinary protective clothing such as overalls and gloves, or special purpose clothing such as dive skins and rash vests can effectively protect against some of these hazards. A combination of overalls worn over a diving suit is worn by some professional divers. Helmets similar to climbing helmets are effective protection against banging one's head on a rough overhead surface, particularly if a neoprene hood is not worn. A diving helmet is very effective for impact protection. =Dangerous marine animals= Some marine animals can be hazardous to divers. In most cases this is a defensive reaction to contact with, or molestation by the diver. * Sharp hard coral skeleton edges can lacerate or abrade exposed skin, and contaminate the wound with coral tissue and pathogenic microorganisms. * Stinging hydroids can cause skin rash, local swelling and inflammation by contact with bare skin. * Stinging jellyfish can cause skin rash, local swelling and inflammation, sometimes extremely painful, occasionally dangerous or even fatal * Stingrays have a sharp spine near the base of the tail which can produce a deep puncture or laceration that leaves venom in the wound as a result of a defensive reaction when disturbed or threatened. * Some fish and invertebrates such as lionfish, stonefish, crown- of-thorns starfish, and some sea urchins have spines which can produce puncture wounds with venom injection. These are often extremely painful and may be fatal in rare cases. Usually caused by impact with the stationary animal. * The venomous blue-ringed octopus may on rare occasions bite a diver. * Lacerations by shark teeth can involve deep wounds, loss of tissue and amputation, with major blood loss. In extreme cases death may result. This may result from attack or investigation by a shark with bites. The risk depends on location, conditions, and species. Most sharks do not have suitable teeth for predation on large animals, but may bite in defence when startled or molested. * Crocodiles can injure by lacerations and punctures by teeth, brute force tearing of tissues, and the possibility of drowning. * The tropical Indo- Pacific Titan triggerfish is very territorial during breeding season and will attack and bite divers. * Very large groupers have been known to bite divers, resulting in bite wounds, bruising and crushing injuries. This has been linked to divers feeding fish. * Electric shock is the defence mechanism of electric rays, in some tropical to warm temperate seas. * Venomous sea snakes are a minor hazard in some regions. The venom is highly toxic, but the snakes are generally timid and their fangs are short. =Overhead environments= Scuba divers may get lost in wrecks and caves, under ice or inside complex structures where there is no direct route to the surface, and be unable to identify the way out, and may run out of breathing gas and drown. Getting lost is often a result of not using a distance line, or losing it in darkness or bad visibility, but sometimes due to the line breaking. Inappropriate response due to claustrophobia and panic is also possible. Occasionally injury or entrapment by collapsing structure or rock-falls can occur. =Entanglement= Another form of entrapment is when the diver or diving equipment is physically restrained by the environment. Some entrapment can be released by cutting free, such as entanglement in popes, lines and nets. The risk of entrapment is often greater with smaller diameter line, and larger mesh nets. Fortunately these are also less work to cut free if a suitable implement is available. Entanglement is a far greater risk to divers with a limited breathing gas supply, and without communications to a stand-by diver. There is also a risk of losing the cutting tool during the attempt to cut free. In areas of known high entanglement risk such as wrecks in fishing grounds, which often accumulate nets and fishing lines, divers may carry redundant cutting tools, often of different types, as a tool well suited to cutting thick rope may not be optimal for cutting thin nets. =Localised pressure differentials= Commonly referred to by professional divers as delta-p (Œ¥p or ŒîP), these hazards are due to a pressure difference causing a flow, which if restricted, will result in a large force on the obstruction to the flow. The most dangerous pressure differentials are those causing outflow from the region occupied by a diver and any attached equipment, as the resultant forces will tend to force the diver into the outflow stream, which may carry the diver or equipment such as the umbilical into a confined space such as intake ducting, drain openings, sluice gates or penstocks, and which may be occupied by moving machinery such as impellers or turbines. When possible, a lockout-tagout system is used to disable the hazard during diving operations, or the divers umbilical is restrained to prevent the diver from getting into the danger zone. This method is used when it is not practicable to shut down equipment, like the bow thrusters on a dynamically positioned diving support vessel, which must be operating during the dive to keep the diver in the right place. Scuba divers are particularly vulnerable to delta-p hazards, and should generally not dive in areas where a delta-p hazard is suspected to exist. =Water movement= * Currents: ** Rip currents and undertow are localised inshore currents induced by waves, but can be too strong for a diver to traverse or perform useful work. ** Overfalls and whirlpools. An overfall is a turbulent volume of water downstream of a ridge or drop-off, or where two currents meet. A whirlpool is a body of rotating water produced by opposing currents or a current running into an obstacle. Both of these phenomena can entrain a diver and cause a rapid change of depth, disorientation or impact with the environment. ** Tidal currents, races and bores ** Local wind can induce a current which can cause problems for the unwary diver, such as making the return swim difficult or impossible. The direction and strength of these currents depend on wind direction, strength and duration, depth, and the latitude of the location. Ekman transport causes the current direction to be offset from wind direction. ** Ocean currents can flow strongly enough to make diving difficult. This is usually reasonably predictable. In some places the local topography can induce enough turbulence to be dangerous. ** River and inland water currents can be strong and dangerous in areas of high gradient. * Wave motion, surf and surge are variable depending on the size and period of the waves, their direction of approach, and the bottom topography. =Loss of visibility= Loss of visibility in itself is not harmful to the diver, but can increase the risk of an adverse incident due to other hazards if the diver cannot avoid or manage them effectively. The most obvious of these is the potential to get lost in an environment where the diver cannot simply ascend to the surface, such as the inside of a wreck or cave, or underneath a large ship. The risk is much greater for scuba divers as surface supplied divers have a secure breathing gas supply, and can follow the umbilical out of the overhead environment without extreme urgency. Loss of visibility can also allow the diver to approach other hazards such as pinch points and unexpected delta-p hazards. Scuba divers who enter overhead environments can take precautions to mitigate the effects of the two most common causes of loss of visibility, which are siltout and dive light failure. To compensate for dive light failure the standard procedure is to carry at least three lights, each of which is sufficient for the planned dive, and siltout can be managed by ensuring a continuous and correctly marked guideline to the exit, and staying close to it at all times. In extreme circumstances the diver may not be able to read critical data from instruments and this may compromise a safe ascent. Hazards inherent in the diver=Pre-existing physiological and psychological conditions in the diver= Some physical and psychological conditions are known or suspected to increase the risk of injury or death in the underwater environment, or to increase the risk of a stressful incident developing into a serious incident culminating in injury or death. Conditions which significantly compromise the cardiovascular system, respiratory system or central nervous system may be considered absolute or relative contraindications for diving, as are psychological conditions which impair judgement or compromise the ability to deal calmly and systematically with deteriorating conditions which a competent diver should be able to manage. =Diver behaviour and competence= Safety of underwater diving operations can be improved by reducing the frequency of human error and the consequences when it does occur. Human error can be defined as an individual's deviation from acceptable or desirable practice which culminates in undesirable or unexpected results. Human error is inevitable and everyone makes mistakes at some time. The consequences of these errors are varied and depend on many factors. Most errors are minor and do not cause significant harm, but others can have catastrophic consequences. Human error and panic are considered to be the leading causes of dive accidents and fatalities. * Inadequate learning or practice of critical safety skills may result in the inability to deal with minor incidents, which consequently may develop into major incidents. * Overconfidence can result in diving in conditions beyond the diver's competence, with high risk of accident due to inability to deal with known environmental hazards. * Inadequate strength or fitness for the conditions can result in inability to compensate for difficult conditions even though the diver may be well versed at the required skills, and could lead to over- exertion, overtiredness, stress injuries or exhaustion. * Peer pressure can cause a diver to dive in conditions where they may be unable to deal with reasonably predictable incidents. * Diving with an incompetent buddy can result in injury or death while attempting to deal with a problem caused by the buddy. * Overweighting can cause difficulty in neutralising and controlling buoyancy, and this can lead to uncontrolled descent, inability to establish neutral buoyancy, inefficient swimming, high gas consumption, poor trim, kicking up silt, difficulty in ascent and inability to control depth accurately for decompression. * Underweighting can cause difficulty in neutralising and controlling buoyancy, and consequent inability to achieve neutral buoyancy, particularly at decompression stops. * Diving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or with a hangover may result in inappropriate or delayed response to contingencies, reduced ability to deal timeously with problems, leading to greater risk of developing into an accident, increased risk of hypothermia and increased risk of decompression sickness. * Use of inappropriate equipment and/or configuration can lead to a whole range of complications, depending on the details. * High task loading due to a combination of these factors can result in a dive that goes well enough until something goes wrong, and the diver's residual capacity is not enough to cope with the changed circumstances. This can be followed by a cascade of failures, as each problem loads the diver more and triggers the next. In such cases the diver is lucky to survive, even with the assistance of a buddy or team, and there is a significant risk of others becoming part of the accident. Hazards of the diving support infrastructure Diving support infrastructure for recreational diving includes dive buddies, charter boats, dive shops, schools etc. Professional diving support infrastructure includes dive teams, diving spreads, diving support vessels, remotely operated vehicles, occupational health and safety legislation and enforcement, contractors and clients. =Behaviour of support personnel= Where support personnel are required, their input and behaviour can have a profound effect on diving operational safety. This is particularly relevant to professional diving operations where the safety of the working diver is to a large extent in the hands of the support personnel, specifically the diving supervisor, standby diver, medical and life-support systems support, and responsible behaviour of the employer. Recreational divers, once competent, are less reliant on support personnel in most cases, but dive boat personnel and owners can provide a safe platform with competent handling and appropriate equipment, or fail to do so, sometimes in ways that are not obvious until after an accident. =Safety culture of the organisation or peer group= * Organisational influences * Peer pressure from the dive buddy * Pressure from the dive leader of a group * Adequate briefings for divers unfamiliar with the local environment * Certification of divers who are not sufficiently competent * Pressure from the employer to increase sales turnover of certification, dives and merchandise * Pressure from the client or diving contractor to get the work done on schedule =Hazards of the dive platform= Movable allow diving in a wide range of places that would be otherwise inaccessible, but this mobility leads to a range of hazards inherent in a mobile platform, and additional hazards of the technology used to move the platform or hold it in position. * Anchored platforms: The hazards include injury by the mooring system, and currents and wind, which may make it difficult or impossible to get back to the platform. The risk is lower with surface-supplied diving as the umbilical allows the crew to pull the diver back to the boat. Scuba divers can surface away ftom the boat and be unable to swim back against the current or wind. * Live-boating: Diving operations from a manually controlled vessel under way, which may use the propulsion system to maneuver during the dive, with associated hazards to the diver. The risk is greater with surface-supplied equipment as the umbilical is at risk during the whole dive, whereas a scuba diver is clear of the hazard zone when sufficiently submerged, or at a reasonable distance from the vessel. The times of greatest risk are when the diver surfaces if the skipper is not aware of the diver's position, when the vessel approaches the diver on the surface, and when boarding at the end of the dive, when the diver is necessarily close to the vessel. * Dynamic positioning: The hazards are mainly the automated thrusters used to hold station. The risk is unacceptable unless the diver is physically constrained from approaching the thrusters' danger zones. This is achieved by deploying the divers by diving stage or bell, limiting the length of excursion umbilical that can be let out, and using underwater tending points where necessary. Scuba is not used from dynamically positioned vessels. * Dive boat access facilities are intended to make water entry and exit safer and more convenient, but they come with their own sets of alternative hazards. * Diving bells and stages used to transport the surface-supplied working diver are classified as safety equipment as their use reduces specific risks, but they also require correct operation to avoid other hazards inherent in their design and function. The dive task and associated equipment Some underwater tasks may present hazards related to the activity or the equipment used, In some cases it is the use of the equipment, in some cases transporting the equipment during the dive, and in some cases the additional task loading, or any combination of these that is the hazard. *Hazmat diving is, by definition, diving in the presence of hazardous materials. The nature of the risk will vary depending on the circumstances, particularly the specific hazardous materials present. *Ordnance disposal exposes the operator to explosive devices. *Demolition may involve explosives. The diver may be required to place explosives and prepare the detonation system. Demolition also often involves unstable and otherwise hazardous structures, heavy lifting, and the moving of large objects. *Underwater construction is associated with many of the usual hazards of a construction site , complicated by visibility and communication difficulties. *Oxy-arc cutting and Underwater welding present electrical and explosion hazards, and sometimes falling objects. *Rigging, lifting and placing heavy objects *Underwater search and recovery *High-pressure water jetting uses equipment that projects a jet of water capable of cutting through diving suits and the diver. *Airlifts and suction dredging may require the diver to operate and direct the suction inlet, which develops a strong pressure differential capable of injuring the diver. = Legislative hazards = * Economic hazards of overly prescriptive and restrictive legislation (scientific diving procedures with good safety history forced to comply with inappropriate safety regulations designed for commercial operations) * Hazards of a litigious society (risk of inappropriate litigation after accidents when duty of care is not clear) References Hazards ","title":"Diving hazards"},{"id":"56419632","text":"The 2017 National Premier Leagues NSW Grand Final was played on 10 September 2017, at Leichhardt Oval in Sydney.

Archeological findings in Laili provide evidence that the cave was occupied by modern humans 44,600 years ago, making it the second oldest known such habitation in Wallacea aside from Madjedbebe in mainland Northern Australia. The age of findings made in Laili corroborates the theory that humans spread from Asia to Australia through the Southern route, via Java and the Lesser Sunda Islands.  Location  Today, the cave lies at an altitude of . 44,600 years ago, during initial settlement, the sea level was lower than today. During the Last Glacial Maximum, about 20,000 years ago, the sea level was lower than today. The steepness of the shore near Laili means that the distance from the cave to the shore has stayed relatively unchanged over time, from during the peak of the glacial era to today.  Occupation  Findings from the cave provide evidence for occupation spanning 44,600 to 11,200 years before present. Usage of the cave increased towards the end of the Last Glacial Maximum 15,000 years ago, suggesting a dramatic increase of the population as sea levels rose.  Findings = Animal remains = The remains of fruit bats, rodents, birds, fishes and turtles were found in Laili. Not all can be attributed to human hunting. For example, presence of murids (small rodents) was relatively constant during the occupation of the cave, suggesting that humans had little impact on murids. As there is no evidence of fishing by owls present in Timor at the time, fish remains (parrotfish and freshwater eel) can be attributed to human consumption. However, unlike in Jerimalai, it is thought that these fishes were caught using traps or spears, and not with fishing hooks. While abundant bird remains were found in Laili, it is thought that most were deposited by avian predators. However, larger birds like ducks and imperial pigeons were probably hunted by humans. Despite being close to the sea, few faunal remains found in Laili come from the sea. In that regard, Laili is similar to inland caves like Uai Bobo and Matja Kuru. Birds and fruit bats suggest that the local environment was covered by forests during the Ice Age. = Tools = A high number of stone artefacts were excavated at Laili, suggesting that tools used by occupants of the cave were primarily made from the reduction of stones. This contrasts with the Jerimalai cave, where tools and jewelry made from seashells were found.  Migration to the Australian continent  The Laili cave findings show that Timor was colonised at least 44,600 years ago. However, the oldest findings in Northern Australia date back more than 50,000 years. It is possible that some findings in Laili are older, but their age could not be determined using radiocarbon dating. Luminescence dating, which was used to date the earliest sites in Northern Australia, could produce earlier results.

It was proclaimed in 1877 and named after Frederic Rogers, 1st Baron Blachford who was the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1860 to 1871. It has been partially divided in the following sub-units of hundreds ‚Äì Barndioota, Cotabena, Warrakimbo, Wonoka and Woolyana. Description The County of Blachford covers the part of South Australia extending from the east coast of Lake Torrens for about along its northern boundary to the west side of the Flinders Ranges and then extending about to the south of its northern boundary. It is bounded by the following counties - Taunton to the north and north-east, Hanson to the east, Granville to the south-east and by Newscastle to the south. The county has a physical landscape consisting of a portion of the Flinders Ranges in its east and the floodplains draining from the ranges to Lake Torrens in its west. The county‚Äôs principal town is Hawker which is located in its south-east corner. The county is served by one principal road, The Outback Highway, which passes through the county in a north-south direction from Quorn in the south through the hundreds of Wonoka and Woolyana including the town centre of Hawker to Parachilna in the north. The Outback Highway is also fed by traffic from the RM Williams Way which meets the highway to the south of Hawker. The Marree railway line passes through the county in a north-easterly direction passing from the south via the hundreds of Warrakimbo, Barndiooota and Cotebena. The county is located both within the state‚Äôs Pastoral Unincorporated Area and the local government area of the Flinders Ranges Council with the latter occupying its south-east corner. Land use within the county is concerned with agriculture which is dominated by the grazing of livestock, mining and tourism. Requirements published by the state government for both the ‚Äòpastoral unincorporated area‚Äô and the Flinders Ranges Council seeks to control land use and associated development to prevent ‚Äúencroachment by incompatible land uses‚Äù and to protect the ‚Äúscenic qualities of rural landscapes.‚Äù The land is west of the Marree railway line which is zoned respectively as ‚Äòpastoral‚Äô and ‚Äòprimary production‚Äô is the basic requirement where developments such as wind farms can be considered. Land use and associated development to the east of the railway line is more highly controlled or even prohibited in some situations to conserve and protect ‚Äúthe natural character and environment of the area.‚Äù History The County of Blachford was proclaimed on 18 January 1877.

It is typically a list of powerful people in an industry alleged as being sexual harassers or abusers. The information is often shared between women by word of mouth or online in private communities, forums, spreadsheets, and crowd-sourced documents. The stated purpose of maintaining these lists is to warn potential victims of \\"people to avoid\\" in their industry. Whisper networks also purportedly help victims identify a common abuser and come forward together about a serial abuser. The term \\"whisper network\\" was newly popularized during the #MeToo movement after several private lists were published outside of private networks. Among the published lists were the Shitty Media Men list, the California State Capitol list, and the Harvey Weinstein Google doc. Karen Kelsky created a less controversial list about men in academia called \\"Sexual Harassment In the Academy: A Crowdsourced Survey\\" which had grown to over 2000 entries by the end of 2017. It includes stories without actually naming the accusing and accused parties. Kelsky said she hoped the list would help demonstrate the scope of sexual misconduct in the academic field, and it has resulted in the investigation of twelve men at the University of Michigan.  Alternatives  Publishing whisper networks to the public has been widely criticized for spreading unsubstantiated rumors that can damage reputations. However, there continues to be debate on the best alternatives for women who have been punished or ignored by official channels to warn other women. It has been noted that certain vulnerable groups, such as young women and women of color, rarely get access to these private lists. As a result, these groups rarely receive any protection from whisper networks unless they are published. The main problem with trying to protect more potential victims by publishing whisper networks is determining the best mechanism to verify allegations. Some suggestions have included strengthening unions in vulnerable industries so workers can report directly to the union, maintaining industry hotlines which have the power to trigger third-party investigations, and creating public systems that allow anonymous reporting with the ability to connect victims who report the same perpetrator. Several apps have been developed which offer various ways for women to report sexual misconduct, and some of these apps have the ability to connect victims with each other. Sex workers regularly share ‚Äúbad date lists‚Äù and St. James Infirmary Clinic (which offers health and safety services for sex workers) created a ‚ÄúBad Date‚Äù app that allows sex workers to anonymously log incidents and warn other sex workers about clients who have threatened, extorted, robbed, or been violent.

Biography  Born in Saint-√âtienne, Capezzali began learning music at the age of nine with the piano and discovered the oboe at the age of 14, listening to a recording of Vivaldi's concerti performed by Pierre Pierlot. After studying one year at the Schola Cantorum de Paris, he entered the \\"classes √† horaires am√©nag√© musique\\" (CHAM) at the CNR in Versailles where he studied oboe with Gaston Longatte. He won the Gold Medal and the Honorary Prize and obtained the Certificate of Qualification (CA) as an oboe teacher. In 1979, at the age of twenty, he was named first solo oboe of the Concerts Lamoureux. In 1984, he was awarded the first solo oboe at the Orchestre philharmonique de Radio France. He is also a prizewinner of the International Competitions of Geneva (1982) and Prague (1986). In 1988, after assuming the post of assistant in Maurice Bourgue's class at the CNSM de Paris, he replaced him as a full professor when the former left for the conservatoire de Gen√®ve. Since 1998, he has been teaching at the Conservatoire national sup√©rieur de musique et de danse de Lyon where he is also responsible for the pedagogical responsibility of the department of woodwind instruments. He is also professor of oboe at the Haute √âcole de Musique of the Lausanne Conservatory. Each year, he conducts advanced sessions in instrumental practice and in chamber music at the Britten school, Institut Sup√©rieur de Musique de P√©rigueux, and trains the next generation of oboists in international academies such as Telƒç in the Czech Republic, Musicalp √† Courchevel, and the Pablo Casals Festival in Prades. In parallel to these activities, he leads a career as a camerist and as a soloist which leads him to perform with the greatest ensembles: Orchestre National Bordeaux Aquitaine, Orchestre de chambre de Paris, etc. He is regularly invited to give concerts and master classes in China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Scandinavia, Russia, Germany, Spain, Poland, Czech Republic, USA, where he represents the French Wind School. He has been working with Buffet Crampon since 1992, and has also contributed to the development of the oboe, particularly the oboe.

Stachys hispida is a perennial that produces purple and white flowers in mid-summer. It appears to be very close to Stachys tenuifolia, which it was historically considered a variety of. S. hispida is distinguished by its more pubescent leaves, stem, and calyx, and usually unbranching stem. The taxonomy of Stachys in the eastern United States remains poorly understood, and is subject to ongoing investigations.

The album was released on 16 February 2018. Two singles have been released from the album, \\"Exactly How You Are\\" and \\"The Perfect Life Does Not Exist\\". The band promoted the album with a national tour in February and March 2018. It was the first album to have song-writing contributions by guitarist Dean Hanson. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2018, the album was nominated for three awards; Producer of the Year, Engineer of the Year and Best Cover Art. Recording and production The album was recorded at the band's studio located in an industrial estate in Stafford in Brisbane, named the Bunnings Warehouse Recording Studio, and produced by the band. It was engineered by Cromack, mixed by Paul McKercher and mastered by William Bowden. On the song- writing, Cromack said, \\"I put some rules on myself: everything had to have the classic verse-chorus-verse-chorus pop structure. I had a ball. And with my lyrics I was like, 'For God's sake, Sam, be clear about what you want to say!'. So often we look down on pop music, but the rules didn't crush our creativity.\\" Cover The photo on the cover was taken by Dean Hanson, who said, \\"It was maybe a couple of months into the recording, we were sitting in the studio one morning‚Ä¶ Sam came in and showed us a few images he‚Äôd seen of horses rearing in cool places and we thought it was a powerful image. As we always do, come out with ridiculous ideas, we thought it‚Äôd be an amazing album cover if we could get someone to rear their horse in front of the garage door of our studio.\\" Critical response The Sydney Morning Herald said, \\"Opening with the poppy, yet summery laid-back feel of \\"The End Times\\", this self- produced album brings studio whiz and ARIA award-winner Paul McKercher into the mix, elevating frontman/guitarist Sam Cromack's vocals to a new level and highlighting his lyrical strength.\\" The Herald Sun claimed, \\"The experimentation and attention to sonic detail here (it's a headphones album) makes this their Pet Sounds\\", and compared \\"The End Times\\" to, \\"a ragged Go- Betweens-style indie gem\\". The Australian noted, \\"the affable plain- spokenness, the facility for melodies that can cure a vitamin D deficiency and, yes, the festival-friendly anthems with unabashedly broad appeal\\" and declared it their best album.

It was once a celebrated natural channel which supplied water for irrigation of lands in the surrounding areas it runs through. Being one of the minor tributaries to River Kaveri, the canal gets sourced by rain through smaller rivulets and the seepage from LBP Canal. It starts near Chithode and ends its travel by inflowing into River Kaveri near RN Pudur. It runs for a length of through the areas of Sottaiyampalayam and Suriyampalayam. Environmental Issues In the recent days, a number of Tanneries, dyeing units, textile mills and bleaching units has been established in this zone of Erode Municipal Corporation. The higher industrialization rate in this zone has caused adverse effects to this canal. It faces a lot of hazards and the water turns purple often due to the mix of untreated effluents that gets released into them from the nearby tanneries, dyeing and bleaching units. The Government along with some other civic agencies has taken several measures to control pollution in this canal, by implement some biological and mechanical treatment methodologies with aid from Norway-based companies.

Lynsey de Paul devised and presents the program, which provides advice to women on how to maintain their personal safety. She also demonstrates how women can defend themselves from attacks, and interviews women who have been attacked.Interview \\"I have always had my eye on the exit\\", Choice Magazine, December 2007, p23 - p25, Choice Publishing Ltd De Paul reports that 180,000 rapes and sexual assaults are recorded each year in England and Wales, while research in the United States suggests that women can double their chances of avoiding being raped if they resist their attacker.11th August 1992, The Times It was first shown on BBC One on 10 August 1992 and repeated on 29 March 1993. The program won a Royal Television Society Award. De Paul also produced a video distributed by PolyGram Video and, in 2007, an updated DVD called Taking Control that provides further instruction with de Paul and John Steadman, a ninth dan ju-jitsu black belt expert, acting out defence strategies as well de Paul presenting facts and figures. The emphasis of the video and DVD is on disabling any assailant for long enough to get away. Confrontation is always the last option, but infinitely preferable to being a passive victim, and the popular view that fighting back increases the risk of serious injury is refuted. The evidence for this was drawn from the work of Dr Pauline Bart at the University of Chicago showing that women who screamed, shouted, resisted were at no greater risk from retaliation by their aggressors, but were more likely to successfully fend off an attacker.Dirty marks: the education of self, media, and popular culture by John F. Schostak Pluto Press, 1993 De Paul made numerous television appearances where she was interviewed about self defence techniques for women.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0966553/https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv- people/4ce2b8c45d247 Graham Keal interviewed de Paul for the Daily Record in 2007 and she is quoted as saying \\"\\"Don't address the area where he's attacking,\\" she said. \\"That's might against might, and he's stronger than you. But his main weapons - his arms - are in use while yours are free to attack his vulnerable areas. If you target them quickly, you turn the control around.\\" Keal wrote \\"It's a persuasive argument which looks even more convincing when you see Lynsey in action. And at a fighting weight of six-and- a-half stone, you realise that if little Lynsey can do it, anyone can\\". The video was released in other countries such as Spain and Germany. It was also featured in the official magazine of the British Jujitsu Association and the United Kingdom Taekwando Association Fighters: The Martial Arts Magazine.Vol 15, Number 9, September 1992, Fighters: The Martial Arts Magazine Lord Mackenzie (Brian Mackenzie, Baron Mackenzie of Framwellgate), former president of the Police Superintendents' Association endorsed the self-defence advice presented by de Paul, saying: \\"It is a very positive contribution to crime prevention and the protection of women and I will be recommending it.\\" A book, authored by de Paul and TV producer Claire McCormack, was also published in 1993 entitled \\"Taking Control: Basic Mental & Physical Self Defence for Women\\" to underscore the lessons presented in Eve Strikes Back and Taking Control.Boxtree Ltd March 31, 1993, De Paul also toured schools and universities in order to encourage them to get the self defence techniques included in their curricula.

The manor is privately owned. History The first recorded owner of the estate was a squire named Erik Tyrgilsson who owned Stora Ek during the second half of the 15th century. The estate was formed in the late 16th century. Until the 18th century the manor consisted of wooden structures. It derives its present appearance from reconstruction works carried out during the 18th century. In 1724, Peter Scheffer (1657-1731), chief justice president and governor of Skaraborg County, became the owner of Stora Ek. In 1754, ownership pasted to his sons Carl Fredrik Scheffer (1715-1786) and Ulrik Scheffer (1716-1799). Both brothers also held high positions within the government. Planning and construction work for a new manor site was started around 1757. Subsequently rebuilt, the manor house became more representative of their social status. The main building and the kitchen wing were finished in 1768. Construction work was then halted until 1778, and the entire reconstruction scheme was not finished until 1782, when Ulrik Scheffer (who was the sole owner since his brother became part owner of Tyres√∂ estate in 1766) erected a memorial stone in the park, celebrating the project. Carl Fredrik Adelcrantz (1716‚Äì1796) is often highlighted as the architect, while some sources mention Jean Eric Rehn (1717-1793). Drawings and testimonies provide conflicting information. Quite possibly both contributed to the designs. The architecture and the gardens followed the prevailing French fashion.

The sculptor was Grinling Gibbons, and the statue was executed around 1700‚Äì1714. Sir Robert was a banker, politician and Lord Mayor of London. As President of St Thomas', he was responsible for the complete rebuilding of the hospital, and associated church in the late 17th century. The statue was designated a Grade I listed structure in 1979.  Description  The statue is carved in marble, and stands on a marble plinth. Clayton is depicted in his robes, with a periwig and pigtail, and carrying a scroll. The plinth is decorated with cherubs and bears an inscription in Latin.  History  Robert Clayton was born in 1629, the son of \\"a poor man of no family\\". Working firstly as a land agent and subsequently as a banker, he made a large fortune such that, by the 1670s, the diarist John Evelyn, described him as \\"this prince of citizens, there never having been any, who, for the stateliness of his palace, prodigious feasting, and magnificence, exceeded him\\". Clayton became an M.P., served on innumerable parliamentary committees and in 1692 was made President of St Thomas' Hospital, an office he held until his death in 1707. The origin of St Thomas' Hospital was the sick house attached to the Church of St Mary Overie in Southwark, founded in the 12th century. By the late 17th century, the hospital was in a dilapidated state and Clayton employed the architect, and St Thomas' governor, Thomas Cartwright to undertake complete rebuilding. The new buildings, of red brick and in a classical style were completed just after Clayton's death, in 1709. The statue was commissioned at some time around this date, to commemorate Clayton's contribution to the hospital. Dates for the actual construction vary; Pevsner gives 1701‚Äì1702, which is supported by the Survey of London. Historic England's listing designation gives a slightly later date of 1714, supported by an inscription on the statue's plinth. The commission for the statue was awarded to Grinling Gibbons. Gibbons was paid ¬£50 \\"to cutt the said Statue in the best Statue Marble by Christmas next\\" and a further ¬£150 \\"as soon as the Work is finished\\". Following the complete reconstruction of the hospital in 1872, on a site further up the River Thames at Lambeth, the statue was moved to its present position. The work was listed at Grade I, the highest grading given to buildings and structures of \\"exceptional interest\\", in 1979.  Removal of the statue  The killing of George Floyd in the United States on 25 May 2020 led to worldwide protests against racism, including in the United Kingdom. A demonstration in Bristol organised by the Black Lives Matter movement culminated in the toppling of the statue of Edward Colston, targeted due to Colston's involvement in the slave trade. This action led to a wider debate in the UK regarding statues commemorating those connected to slavery. Clayton was a shareholder in, and assistant to, the Royal African Company, founded in 1660, a major slaving institution. On 11 June 2020, a joint statement from the Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust announced that Clayton's statue, together with that of Thomas Guy, would be removed from public view.

It is the 23rd overall episode of the series and is written by co-executive producer Luke Del Tredici and directed by Dean Holland. It aired on Fox in the United States on September 28, 2014. The show revolves around the fictitious 99th precinct of the New York Police Department in Brooklyn and the officers and detectives that work there. Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) is an immature yet very talented detective with an astounding record of crimes solved, putting him in a competition with fellow detective Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero). The precinct's status changes when the Captain retires and a new commanding officer, Cpt. Raymond Holt (Andre Braugher), is appointed. This creates a conflict between Jake and Holt over their respective methods in the field. In the episode, Jake returns to the precinct after having been on undercover missions for six months. However, he soon finds out that a criminal from an organization managed to evade capture and sets out to find him before he escapes. He also wants to question Amy about his feelings for her. Meanwhile, Holt conducts drills for Amy and Rosa without explanation. Gina and Boyle face consequences of having slept together. The episode was seen by an estimated 5.46 million household viewers and gained a 2.6/7 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49, according to Nielsen Media Research. The episode received positive reviews from critics, who called the episode as a promising start for the season, praising Samberg's performance in the episode. Plot Jake organizes a raid that ends with the arrest of the Ianucci crime family. He is then commended to return to the NYPD and goes back to the precinct. Jake talks with Amy (Melissa Fumero), but when she reveals she is still dating Teddy, he denies his feelings. Jake is notified that one member of the organization, Freddy Maliardi, managed to escape capture. Despite his status as a former cop, Jake decides to go questioning old acquaintances in the mob. He and Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio) decide to go \\"undercover\\" and find Freddy. They interrogate his girlfriend who finally gives in and reveals he is planning to flee the country. However, they arrive too late and Freddy leaves on a plane. Despite that, Jake is comforted for managing to catch the severely dangerous organization. Captain Holt forces Amy and Rosa (Stephanie Beatriz) to do a series of drills involving Terry (Terry Crews) acting out various scenarios, without explaining why. While at first accepting it, soon they decide to quit the drills. Holt informs Terry that he did it as a new Deputy Commissioner is on his way and wants everyone prepared. Gina (Chelsea Peretti) is worried Boyle will tell Jake about their tryst together, but he manages not to out of fear of Gina. Despite this, they end up sleeping together again. Reception=Viewers= In its original American broadcast, \\"Undercover\\" was seen by an estimated 5.46 million household viewers and gained a 2.6/7 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49, according to Nielsen Media Research. This was a massive 110% increase in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 2.59 million viewers with a 1.3/3 in the 18-49 demographics. This means that 2.6 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 7 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it. With these ratings, Brooklyn Nine-Nine was the third most watched show on FOX for the night, behind The Simpsons and Family Guy, fifth on its timeslot and sixth for the night, behind Once Upon a Time, The Simpsons, Family Guy, NBC Sunday Night Football, and Fox NFL. =Critical reviews= \\"Undercover\\" received positive reviews from critics. Roth Cornet of IGN gave the episode a \\"great\\" 8.0 out of 10 and wrote, \\"Brooklyn Nine-Nine returned with a strong entry that simultaneously reminded us of what we loved about the series in its freshman season, and paved the way for some interesting new directions as it heads into its second.\\" LaToya Ferguson of The A.V. Club gave the episode an \\"B-\\" grade and wrote, \\"Coming back from summer hiatus, Brooklyn Nine-Nine feels like it's been on for a lot longer than it has. That's meant as a compliment, because the show took little time becoming a fully-formed series. But this premiere specifically feels very comfortable, like an fairly new pair of sneakers you actually love but forgot to wear on a regular basis. This is a good episode, but it's also one that's more like a reminder of what you loved about it and a precursor to greatness to come.\\" Jackson McHenry of Entertainment Weekly wrote, \\"Like all of life, 'Undercover' could've used more Stephanie Beatriz, and it's a pity that Amy was mostly defined by her (lack of) relationship to Jake. But Nine-Nine proved, once again, that it has more potential than it can manage to use each week.\\" Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote, \\"All in all, 'Undercover' wasn't an episode I'd stack up against the funniest episodes of season 1, but premieres like this often have to spend a lot of time on plot and exposition, and it just felt so pleasing to have this show back. Hell, I was just glad to have the opening credits sequence back.\\" Andy Crump of Paste gave the episode an 8.7 and wrote, \\"So, Brooklyn Nine- Nines opener sets the stage, as all openers must do. If 'Undercover' is meant to play a specific role and foreshadow events that may occur further down the line, though, it does so handsomely; it's funny, maybe not as funny as it should be, but still chock full of terrific gags and punchlines, most of them property of Lo Truglio and Braugher. (If you thought Holt was dour before, you've apparently seen nothing yet, though good luck spotting the difference between his happy face and his stressed face.) 'I missed us', breathes Peralta in the episode's pre-credits sequence. We missed us, too, Jake. We missed us too.\\" Robin Harry of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 4.5 star rating out of 5 and wrote, \\"This side-story brought a lot of the familiarity I loved about this episode; Holt's apparent yet invisible sense of humor, Terry's quiet wisdom but loud intimidation, Amy's obsequiousness and subsequent self- loathing, Rosa's rebelliousness. My only complaint - not enough Hitchcock and Scully! This season didn't start off with a bang or bells and whistles, but it started with everything that I know and love about Brooklyn Nine-Nine. That makes it a win for me.\\" ReferencesExternal links 2014 American television episodes Brooklyn Nine-Nine (season 2) episodes ","title":"Undercover (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)"},{"id":"56420415","text":"Genoplesium littorale, commonly known as the Tuncurry midge orchid, and as Corunastylis littoralis in Australia, is a small terrestrial orchid endemic to New South Wales. It has a single thin leaf fused to the flowering stem and up to thirty small green flowers with a purple-brown labellum. It is only known from fewer than two thousand plants in a small area on the New South Wales North Coast and is critically endangered. Description Genoplesium littorale is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single thin, dark green leaf, long with a reddish base and fused to the flowering stem with the free part long. Between five and thirty green flowers are crowded along a flowering stem tall. The flowers lean downwards, are about long, wide and inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is about long and wide with a pointed tip and hairless edges. The lateral sepals are about long, wide, point downwards and spread widely apart from each other. The petals are about long, wide, with a sharply pointed tip and hairless edges. The labellum is purplish brown, oblong, about long, wide with a curled, sharply pointed tip and hairless edges. There is a callus in the centre of the labellum and extending almost to its tip. Flowering occurs from March to May. Taxonomy and naming The Tuncurry midge orchid was first formally described in 2001 by David Jones from a specimen collected near Tuncurry and the description was published in The Orchadian. In 2002, David Jones and Mark Clements changed the name to Corunastylis littorale. The specific epithet (littorale) is derived from the Latin word littus meaning \\"shore\\". Distribution and habitat Genoplesium littorale grows in scrub on stabilised sand dunes in the Forster-Tuncurry area. Ecology Five species of flies in the genera Conioscinella and Cadrema have been shown to pollinate G. littorale. The insects are rewarded with nectar, although the nectar supply is quickly depleted by visiting flies. Conservation In 2010, the total population of the G. littorale was estimated to be 1,960 plants. The species is threatened by weed invasion, grazing by rabbits and possible future residential developments. It is listed as \\"critically endangered\\" (CR) under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) and under the New South Wales Government NSW New South Wales Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995.

He is best known as a member of the hip hop and trap music trio Migos along with Quavo and Offset, whom are his uncle and cousin, respectively.  Early life  Kirshnik Khari Ball was born in Lawrenceville, Georgia, which is in Gwinnett County, near Atlanta. He was raised by his mother, along with family members Quavo and Offset.  Musical career = Migos (2008‚Äìpresent) = Along with fellow family members Quavo and Offset, Takeoff began rapping in 2008. The group initially performed under the stage name Polo Club, but eventually changed their name to Migos. The group released their first full-length project, a mixtape titled Juug Season, on August 25, 2011. They followed with the mixtape No Label, on June 1, 2012. Migos initially rose to prominence after the release of their single \\"Versace\\", in 2013. The song was remixed by Canadian rapper Drake and peaked at number 99 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and number 31 on the Hot R&B;/Hip- Hop Songs chart. Their debut studio album, Yung Rich Nation, was released in July 2015, and featured guest appearances from Chris Brown and Young Thug, and production from Zaytoven and Murda Beatz. The album peaked at number 17 on the Billboard 200. Migos achieved their first number one single in 2016 with \\"Bad and Boujee\\" featuring Lil Uzi Vert, peaking on the Billboard Hot 100 during the week of January 21, 2017. The song has gone on to be certified four times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). While he can be seen in one of the background scenes in the music video, Takeoff is not featured nor credited on the song. Takeoff himself has claimed that he was not featured on the song because he was busy at the time of recording. On June 24, 2017, during filming of Complex's Everyday Struggle at the BET Awards 2017, he was questioned about his absence by hosts Joe Budden and DJ Akademiks, to which he replied, \\"Do it look like I'm left off \\"Bad and Boujee\\"?\\". Takeoff's response caused Budden to leave the set, and an altercation between Migos and Budden and their entourages almost took place before it was broken up by security. Migos's second studio album, Culture, was released on January 27, 2017, debuting at number 1 on the US Billboard 200, moving 131,000 album- equivalent units, including 44,000 copies sold, during its first week of release. The album went on to achieve platinum certification in the country in July 2017. The group's second album, Culture II, was released on January 26, 2018. It became Migos's second album to debut at number 1 on the Billboard 200, moving 199,000 equivalent units, including 38,000 copies sold, in its first week of release. Legal issues= 2015: Georgia Southern University incident = On April 18, 2015, Migos were scheduled to headline Georgia Southern University's 2015 Spring concert at Hanner Fieldhouse. The show started at 7:00 pm with local opening acts; however, the group took the stage nearly an hour and a half later than their scheduled 9:00 pm set time. Although their performance contract stipulated a minimum 45-minute set length, the group performed for less than 30 minutes before leaving the stage. The University Police Department, the Statesboro Police Department and the Bulloch County Sheriff's Office, who were present at the concert as security detail, detected a strong scent of marijuana from the group's vans, and the drivers were questioned by law enforcement. Upon further investigation, the rap trio and 12 members of their entourage were arrested for possession of marijuana and another controlled substance, possession of firearms within a school safety zone, possession of firearms during the commission of a crime, and possession of firearms by convicted felons. While university officials had been aware of Migos's reputation, the group were allowed to perform as the student body had voted to have the group perform among seven acts that were up for consideration, and student fees and ticket sales were used to pay for the concert. According to the performance contract, the group were to be paid $30,000 with their promoter Big House Collective receiving an additional $3,000. University officials initially sought to put Migos in breach of contract due to the group's late arrival, shortened performance, and possession of contraband on university property; however, the university ultimately paid half of the agreed-upon fees. On April 20, 2015, Takeoff, Quavo, and six members of their entourage were released on bond by the Bulloch County District Attorney's Office while Offset and six others remained in custody without bond. As a result of their arrests, on April 28, 2015, Migos announced they would postpone their Yung Rich Nation Tour until July. = 2017: Atlanta flight incident = On July 7, 2017, Takeoff was asked to be taken off a flight prior to takeoff from Atlanta to Des Moines, Iowa, after he reportedly refused to move his bag from the floor to an overhead storage bin.

In the dizzy everyday bustle, sometimes we even have no time to take a breath. But there must be a balance in everything. And if we can not stop in time, the city will do it for us. There are traffic lights on which you can slow down and spend a moment in simple waiting. And there are railway crossings, where you will have to stand a little longer, peering into the distance and looking for the silhouette of an approaching train, and also calculate how many cars there are. What thoughts come to their mind when the barrier suddenly blocks them further? For them, every day is a new story, the sounds of which are mixed with the noise of a train passing along the rails. This story of short stories tells us about everyday life and the conversations of young people, but at the same time different people on various topics, waiting at railway junctions.

A publisher and editor, who in 1976 founded Spiral, a women's arts and literary journal that later published monographs, she was also a loving single mother, and grandmother. Her influential literary and visual arts activism was inspired by an all-male poets‚Äô evening at the 1973 Christchurch Festival, where she observed ‚Äòtwenty young men getting up on the stage one after another‚Äô.  Career  Born in Tauranga, McPherson studied at the University of Auckland and Canterbury University. McPherson's poetry first appeared in print in 1963, and she went on to publish five collections of poetry. In 1974, McPherson started one of New Zealand's first women's artist collectives, the Women Artists Group in Christchurch, and from this co-founded the first New Zealand women's art journal, Spiral. Spiral provided a forum for female artists and writers to publish their work, during a time in which female artists struggled to be recognised in New Zealand. McPherson herself said, \\"I worked with the material we received‚Äìthat it didn't reflect our own reality didn't bother me too much, it was the idea of women working together positively, that was the aim, and the amalgam of arts ‚Äì photographers as well as poets, writers, painters etc.\\" The journal was first published in 1976 and was a collective effort from the outset, with the Spiral Collective established to produce the publication. The first four issues were published by McPherson and the Christchurch collective (1976‚Äì79), issue five was published by a Wellington collective, issue six by a Tauranga collective, and issue seven by a national collective. Spiral also became a floating imprint used by these autonomous groups to publish other books by New Zealand women, including McPherson's debut poetry book, A figurehead: a face (Spiral, 1982), which was the first New Zealand poetry collection by an out lesbian, Keri Hulme's Booker Prize-winning novel The Bone People (1984), The House of the Talking Cat by J C Sturm (Jacquie Baxter, 1983), and Drawing Together by Janet Charman, Marina Bachmann and Sue Fitchett (1985). Artists and writers who were associated with the Women Artists Group initiatives and the Spiral Collectives included Joanna Margaret Paul, Marian Evans, Allie Eagle, Bridie Lonie, and Anna Keir, all prominent figures in the timeline of the feminist art movement in New Zealand. In 1980, McPherson was involved in the opening show at the Women's Gallery in Wellington (another first for New Zealand), where she worked as a co-ordinator. Her poem, Have You Heard of Artemisia? was painted on the 1981 Matariki Mural on the outside wall of the gallery on Harris Street.

At least 103 people were killed and 235 others wounded in the attack. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. Attack On 27 January 2018, attackers blew up an explosives-packed ambulance near an interior ministry building on a busy and heavily guarded street in Kabul during rush hour. The bombers detonated the explosives while passing through the second in a series of checkpoints near Kabul's embassies and government buildings including the European Union embassies. The explosion was so powerful that the shock was felt around the capital, collapsing buildings and destroying fa√ßades in the immediate area. The Jamhuriat Hospital, government offices, businesses and a school are close to the site of the blast. It was the third major attack in seven days, following shootings at an aid agency in Jalalabad and at the Inter-Continental Hotel in Kabul. A bomb was hidden in an ambulance and detonated at a second police checkpoint, according to officials. Its blast also destroyed vehicles, shops, and buildings nearby. The attack occurred on a street, locally known as Chicken Street, near a building run by the Interior Ministry. Various government agencies have offices there and the road had security checkpoints in place. The coordinator for the Italian aid group Emergency that operates a trauma center described the event as a \\"massacre\\". According to reports, the vehicle was stopped at a second security checkpoint after passing the primary one claiming they had a patient. When police attempted to stop the vehicle from going further, the driver detonated the bomb. Relatives were reported to be queuing at the city morgue. The scene of the attack was described as one of carnage with shattered bodies, many unidentifiable, lying all over. = Perpetrators = The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. The Afghan government described it as a crime against humanity, and accused Pakistan for providing support to the attackers. Pakistan denies supporting militants carrying out attacks in Afghanistan. Aftermath The third major attack in Afghanistan within a week, President Ashraf Ghani again blamed Pakistan for failing to move against Taliban terrorists. Ghani vowed revenge against the Taliban in retaliation. In addition, Ghani sent an Afghan intelligence delegation to Pakistan to hand over \\"undeniable\\" evidence that the terrorists of the bombing were planning the attack within Pakistan. Peace prospects with the Taliban also took a downward turn following increasing outrage over the attacks, with a presidential spokesman saying that the Taliban \\"has lost the opportunity for peace talks\\". The use of an ambulance to deliver the bomb was described as an act of perfidy by the International Committee of the Red Cross.

Early life  Chandi Lahiri was born in the historical township of Nabadwip, West Bengal. He was born to Mohini Mohan and Probodhbala Lahiri. He was involved in active politics in his teens. He studied in Hindu school in Nabadwip. He did his graduation from Vidyasagar College, Nabadwip. He came to Kolkata in the 1950s. He finished his postgraduation in Bengali from University of Kolkata. He was the second child among seven siblings. The whole family was creative. This involvement and immense interest in the social and political history of the nation designed his art work into an apt commentary on the national scenario of things.  Career  He began his career in 'Dainik Loksevak' newspaper as a journalist in 1951. He started drawing cartoons officially in 1961 and joined Anandabazar Patrika first for their then English daily The Hindusthan Standard and later when his friend and contemporary Cartoonist Amal Chakraborty left the magazine house's Bengali daily cartoon feature 'Tirjak', he took over. He had joined the group in 1962 as a cartoonist where he worked for almost 30 years. For the next twenty years he worked with various other media outlets. He also designed animation sequence for a colour series of Doordarshan in the late 1970s. His work was also used in popular advertisements. Being humanitarian by nature, he worked pro bono for various social organisations to support noble and just causes all throughout his life. He wrote many books on cartoon. His research works on Gaganendranath Tagore's cartoons or Basantak, a magazine that was dedicated to humor gained importance. His work in Bengali on the history of cartoons, Cartooner Itibrityo is used as a reference book on Bengali cartoons and their works. An anthropological work Manush Ki Kore Manush Holo, co written with his daughter Trina, won them the prestigious Narsingdas Award from Delhi University. His social cartoons were awarded in cartoon exhibitions in Yugoslavia, England, Canada and Japan. His admirers find it weird that he was not given any government award in India. He was great friends with other contemporary cartoonists like R.K.Laxman, Mario Miranda, Kutti, and others. He was an ardent admirer of David Lowe. Pixel or Kafi Khan and Shakila Chakraborty were predecessors he respected the most. He had a wide range of knowledge about things. He was one of the pioneers of animation in Bengal. His own projects like The Biggest Egg and Under The Blue Moon, created along with his third brother Tulsi Lahiri were not just appreciated but bought by Doordarshan. His team also made animated movie titles for popular Bengali movies like Hangsaraj, Dhanyi Meye, Mouchak, Charmurti and others. His books on cartoons like Chandi Looks Around or Since freedom are connoisseurs delight. He was close to theater groups and did lettering of plays by groups like Nandikar, Sayak, Sundaram, Purba Paschim and recently Paikpara Akhor.

Expected to be mounted on three platforms: ship, land and air launches. The prospective missiles will be located in transport and launch containers (TLC) with dimensions of 5,300 √ó 600 √ó 600 mm. The length of the rocket itself with an accelerator of 5,050 mm. TLC with a rocket with a cross- shaped hard wing can be placed on terrestrial, marine or air carriers. It is intended to defeat combat surface ships and transport vessels from the structure of shock groups (convoy) or moving individually with a displacement of up to 5,000 tons. The missile is based on a design of the Soviet anti-ship missile Kh-35, however Ukrainian constructors substantially improved missile range and electronics.  History  The missile was revealed for the first time in the exhibition \\"Weapons and Security 2015\\" which held in Kyiv. According to information from open sources, the first flight samples of the cruise missile were manufactured in the spring of 2016. Production of advanced missile weapons takes place in cooperation with other Ukrainian enterprises, including Artem Luch GAhK, , ¬´Motor Sich¬ª (turbofan MS-400 engine), Pivdenne YuMZ PivdenMash, Lviv LORTA or other radar electronics, Vyshneve ZhMZ Vizar Kiev and others. March 22, 2016, the first tests of the Neptune missile were conducted. The tests were attended by secretary of NSDC of Ukraine Oleksandr Turchynov. In mid-2017, missiles were tested concurrently with trials of the Vilkha complex. However, unlike the Vilkha, the test results and capabilities of the \\"Neptune\\" rocket were not advertised. On January 30, 2018, according to the press service of NSDC, the first flight tests of the Ukrainian ground- based cruise missile, which is capable of accurately hitting ground and naval targets, were successful. On August 17, 2018, the missile successfully hit a target at the range of 100 km during test fire in the southern part of Odesa oblast. 6 April 2019, the missile was successfully tested again and hit target during tests near Odesa, according to President Petro Poroshenko's statement, it would be provided to the Ukrainian military in December 2019. Maximum range is about 300 km. After the United States and the Russian Federation both left the INF Treaty, Ukraine announced that it was considering developing intermediate-range cruise missiles. Analysts consider an extended-range Neptune missile to be a candidate for such an effort.

Early years and education Sophronia Zulema Wilson was born in 1834, at Eaton, Ohio. She attended school at Oxford Seminary, Ohio, class of 1853. Career After completing her education, she taught school for several years. Her first husband, Harry Epply, died soon after their marriage, and she accepted the offer of her brother-in-law and his wife to go live with them in Cincinnati. There she met H.H. Wagoner and his wife, who was dying of tuberculosis. She took care of the woman, and after her death, of the woman's daughter, who also died of tuberculosis. After that she married Henry Hoover Wagoner in 1861. He was a native of Maryland. They had two sons, George C.R. and Harry Epply (who later married Adeline Palmier Wagoner). Three other children died young. The Wagoners moved to St. Louis in 1866, and since that year Wagoner stood first in the ranks of those women who devote much of their lives to missionary and charitable work. As a pioneer worker in the missionary field, Wagoner stood among the first who interested themselves in this cause in St. Louis. She was one of the charter members of the first Auxiliary of the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society, organized west of the Mississippi River. It was founded on April 4, 1870. Many donations to Foreign Missions were made by and through her efforts, and memorials and scholarships in India and Japan bearing her name stood as a glowing tribute to her untiring energy in this field. Wagoner found great satisfaction in the fact that she saw the Women's Foreign Missionary Society grow from the small organization which numbered about fifteen members to a circle that enlarged and reached every civilized country. In St. Louis at her time there were about ten societies, with three hundred or more members, each holding monthly meetings in homes of the members. The first branch in St. Louis met at Union M. E. Church at Eleventh and Locust Streets. Jennie Fowler Willing was the organizer; Mrs. T. C. Fletcher, wife of ex-Governor Fletcher, was the president; Mesdames Clinton B. Fisk, E. 0. Stanard, J. N. Schureman, Wagoner, B. B. Bonner, Kennedy and Mrs. Woodburn were charter members. The Des Moines branch ‚Äî outgrowth of the meeting held in Union M. E. Church ‚Äî had a membership of about 20,000. In 1912 more than $75,000 was collected to carry on the work in India, China, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Italy, Africa and other distant countries. The membership dues were two cents ($ in dollars) a week and a daily prayer. The first work of the society was to assist in building a schoolhouse in Tokyo, Japan, for educating girls. When it was completed, one scholarship was taken by the society and the girl selected was educated and graduated from the school with honors. The girl was Sophia Wagoner, named after Sophronia Wilson Wagoner. The Des Moines branch, comprising Iowa, Missouri and Arkansas, had forty-seven woman missionaries in various parts of the world, managing schools, colleges, hospitals, where many thousands of girls were educated in industrial and other lines of work, which tended to make them useful homekeepers, teachers and nurses. Sophronia Wilson Wagoner was district president for many years and had an interest in various schools in India and China. The first secretary was Mrs. Pierce; Mrs. Lucy Prescott was the first correspondence secretary. It was called the \\"Western Branch\\". Mrs. William A. Jones was the first treasurer. When the headquarters were transferred to Des Moines, the wife of Bishop Hamline was made president. At Thaudaung, India, Burmah, stood a chapel called the \\"Wagoner\\", which was a personal donation by Wagoner to the mission. Wagoner supported a scholarship at Jubblepore, India, for twenty years. Wagoner took a special interest in all of these movements and was identified with the missionary work in St. Louis for over forty years. She made addresses before the different auxiliary branches of the societies and to the delegates. There had been no meeting of any importance in this field of endeavor that Wagoner, by her earnest appeals, had not induced and influenced to give liberal support to the cause put before them. She was for 29 years the vice-president of the Central Mission organized on September 13, 1884; the mission became the Boyle Memorial Center, and was inter-denominational hosting The Industrial School. The Central Mission was organized with Mrs. Wilbur Boyle as president; Sophronia Wilson Wagoner as vice-president; Mrs. Elmer Adams as treasurer; Miss Capen as secretary; Mrs. Sue Owens as missionary; Mrs. Andrew Sproule, Mrs. Hodgman, Mrs. Given Campbell and Mrs. Price as managers. The work was industrial and Sunday school. A church was organized, and in a short time a new building was erected on Eleventh Street, St. Louis, between Franklin Avenue and Morgan Street. After the death of Mrs. Boyle, the name was changed to Boyle Center in her honor. The work was enlarged with the Rev. Clyde Smith as pastor and Mrs. Sue Owens as missionary. She also acted as first president of the Women's Christian Temperance Union, which was organized in January, 1880, by Elizabeth Greenwood, of Baltimore, for years the national evangelist. Wagoner was identified with the work of the Woman's Christian Home, located at Fifth and Poplar Streets, St. Louis, and was a member of the Board of Managers. Mrs. Mary A. Clardy was the secretary. Only a few ladies responded at first to the call, as the work was new. This was carried on by the distribution of literature and evangelistic meetings held in churches and missions. The work soon progressed, and Wagoner was followed by Mrs. T. C. Fletcher as president. Other unions were organized in different parts of the city; a district association was formed. Mrs. E. B. Ingalls, Mrs. A. S. Cairns, J. Ellen Foster, Clara Hoffman and other women were active supporters. Their work was to hold evangelical meetings in the interest of temperance at the Bethel Mission and of supporting patients in a sanitarium on Cass Avenue, where persons were placed to be given treatment for the alcoholic habit. Among the many benefited by this institution were several ministers, who, after re- entering the field cured, did untold and far-reaching good for the cause. She served several years as president of the \\"White Cross Home\\", a rescue home for young girls, which was first named the Magdalene Home. Later it was sold and became the Russell Home for Old Ladies. The Women's Home Mission assisted in the support of schools in the Highlander work, the mountaineers in Kentucky, North and South Carolina ‚Äî schools for the education of the poor girls in the South, and also of the Afro-American children, and work among the Indians. Wagoner was district vice-president of this for over twenty years. At Gibson and Taylor Avenues, St. Louis, a Memorial Chapel was erected by Wagoner and her husband and fitted out complete as a donation to the Methodist Church. This was done in honor of H. H. Wagoner, Wagoner's husband. The White Cross Home was one of the first homes for rescue work for the girls. Their object was to provide shelter and a home for young girls who were in trouble. Mrs. D. W. Haydock was president of that organization for many years. Wagoner and Mrs. Hagerty also served in this capacity. Mrs. W. W. Culver took an active interest in the home and gave it her loyal support. This Home was a small house located on Garrison and Thomas Streets, St. Louis, and could accommodate twelve girls. Other institutions for this purpose were established and the ladies turned their interest to the Russell Home for Old Ladies, their first money coming from the sale of the White Cross Home. Wagoner was also an early women's suffrage activist. In 1924, at 89 years old, she was asked about her activities, and her reply was \\"Just say that with any movement that was for the advancement of Christianity or opened doors of opportunity to women, I have been pleased to be identified.\\" She died on February 9, 1929, at her home at 4161 Lindell Boulevard, St. Louis.

According to the account of Al- Nasiri, the gate existed on the protected harbor of the city, which was used by the Marinid as a shipyard. The harbor connects the city to Bou Regreg via canal, and ships entered the harbor from the canal by passing through the arch of the gate. The gate is also known as a place where the sultan Abu Yusuf Yaqub dispatched his naval fleet to attack the city of Algeciras several times in 1285, in which joined by around 36 warships.

In 1655 he carried out a large survey of Ireland, the Down Survey and subsequently acquired much land himself. This made him vulnerable for accusations of corruption. Jerome Sankey, who fought in Cromwell's army in Ireland between 1650 and 1652, had become a Member of Parliament and was knighted by Richard Cromwell in 1659. He was one of the persons that accused Petty of bribery and fraud.  Bibliographical information  8 p. In 1647 and 1648 William Petty had published to short pamphlets: The Advice to Hartlib for The Advancement of some particular Parts of Learning and A Declaration concerning the newly invented art of Double Writing. It took more than ten years before he published a third short text, concerning the Down Survey. One year after the publication of this Proceedings between Sankey and Petty, Petty published his Reflections upon some persons and things in Ireland, a much larger essay of 200 pages, in which he gave much more information about the Down Survey and also reflected on the charges made against him. He also wrote an extensive manuscript on the Down Survey, which was not published during his life, and appeared in 424 densely printed pages in 1851 as The History of the Survey of Ireland commonly called The Down Survey by Doctor William Petty A.D. 1655-6, edited by Thomas Aiskew Larcom for the Irish Archaeological Society. { class= \\"wikitable\\" ! colspan=5  References to Bibliographies, Bibliographical databases and online editions - style=\\"vertical-align: top;\\"  Hull:Bibliography number in 'Bibliography of the Printed Writings of Sir William Petty' in: . 4  Keynes:Bibliography number in . 4  Wing's:Reference number in Wing's Short Title Catalogue (as used in Keynes 1971).

Next comes a second list of seven (mostly different) charges by Sankey, with the answers of Petty. Then a third list of eleven accusations by Sankey is given, again of a different nature, and again with answers by Petty. Finally Petty makes six observations \\"upon the whole matter\\". \\"Petty points out with great satisfaction the discrepancies in the (...) lists. Many of the earlier charges of fraud and bribery had been dropped, and in their place less serious accusations substituted.\\"Bevan 1894, p. 34.  Background  In 1655 and 1656 Petty surveyed half of Ireland in what was called the Down Survey. The Down Survey is one of the projects that brought great fame to Petty, apart from his publications on political economy and political arithmetic. The most important text he wrote concerning the Down Survey ‚Äì The History of the Survey of Ireland commonly called The Down Survey by Doctor William Petty A.D. 1655-6 ‚Äì was published in 1851 by Thomas Aiskew Larcom for the Irish Archaeological Society. In some biographies, the years of the Down Survey get a lot of attention. For instance in Fitzmaurice's Life of Sir William Petty two chapters are devoted to the survey and its aftermath.Fitzmaurice 1895, chapter II and III, pp. 23‚Äì101. Petty's way of organizing the survey was not without benefit for himself. He acquired much land in Ireland‚ÄìJohn Aubrey says that he owned 50,000 acres at a certain time. ‚Äì Brief Lives. See for instance: . This, of course, made him subject to accusations of corruption. The political controversies on the future of Ireland (and England) played an important role in the background. In 1659 Sir Hierom Sankey raised charges against Petty in the Parliament.Charges Against William Petty Presented to The Commons by Hierom Sankey; in The Hartlib Papers. See also Fitzmaurice 1895, pp. 81‚Äì93 for an extensive description of the development of the conflict between Sankey and Petty, and the political backgrounds.

Chen's career as a live streamer ended abruptly on 31 July 2018 when her heartless comments over Nanking massacre caused major outrage in China. Chen made fun of the Nanking massacre, a mass murder committed by Japanese troops in 1938 killing over 300,000 people, by saying ‚ÄúJapanese soldiers‚Äô blades were so fast‚Äù. While watching a live game stream, she described a scene in the game as \\"bowing to Yasukuni shrine,\\" referring to the controversial shrine honoring Japanese soldiers, including convicted war criminals. Chen also reportedly took a photo under a teenage girl's skirt on subway and posted it online in a weibo blog without masks, which together with many of her other indecent and antisocial blogs demonstrated the dark side of her twisted personalities. Her weibo account has been banned when those indecent contents attracted much wider public attention through her comments on Nanking massacre.

A boyaress by birth, she belonged to the VƒÉcƒÉrescu family. Her father Nicolae, her grandfather IenƒÉchi»õƒÉ and her uncle Alecu were politicians and professional writers; Mari»õica herself was an unpublished poet. She was orphaned as a child, but was looked after by her relatives and her family friends, including Prince Alexandru II Ghica and philanthropist Zoe Br√¢ncoveanu. Described by period sources as exceptionally beautiful, if also vain and ambitious, she married in 1834 the Prince's brother, Spatharios Costache Ghica. Her adoptive clan, the Ghicas, remained the leading Wallachian family until late 1842, when Alexandru II was deposed by the Ottoman Empire. Mari»õica's influence peaked again after the princely election of 1842‚Äì1843. Though her husband failed in his bid for the throne, Mari»õica became mistress of the winner, Gheorghe Bibescu, bearing him a child. Her third cousin, Gheorghe was at the time married to her godmother Zoe Br√¢ncoveanu. Choosing to ignore public outrage, he finally obtained a divorce in 1844. The following year, he and Mari»õica were married in Foc»ôani, a town situated on Wallachia's border with Moldavia. This was a lavish ceremony attended by Moldavian Prince Mihail Sturdza, who was their new godfather. Nevertheless, it had only partial recognition from the Wallachian Orthodox Church hierarchy. At odds with Metropolitan Neofit II, Gheorghe appealed to the Ecumenical Patriarch, and obtained approval after replacing Germanus IV with Meletius III. His effort included bribing the Ottoman Divan to depose Germanus. Policy disagreements between the conservative Gheorghe and liberal groups fed the Wallachian Revolution of 1848. During these events, Mari»õica remained by her husband's side, and was possibly present when he survived an assassination attempt. The couple eventually escaped Wallachia and settled in the Austrian Empire; the revolution was crushed by the Ottoman and Russian Empires, and the throne was handed to Mari»õica's brother-in-law, Barbu Dimitrie »òtirbei. She and Gheorghe lived in Istanbul, and later in Paris, where Gheorghe continued to press for his recognition as Prince, as well as for union between Wallachia and Moldavia. His political career in Wallachia was resumed after the Crimean War, but his prospects of becoming Prince were ended during the electoral battles of 1859; his rival, Alexandru Ioan Cuza, was in a position to unite the two countries. The same year, Mari»õica died of cancer in Paris. She was survived by five children from two marriages, including a son, Mihai Ghica, who died without heirs of his own, in 1926. Her female descendants married into several houses of European nobility, including Montesquiou, Rasponi-Murat, Courval, and Faucigny-Lucinge. In the arts, Mari»õica is remembered as a promoter of the Romanian dress, and a muse to painters Carol Szathmari and Constantin Lecca. Also a literary patron, she was the aunt of two other female writers, Elena VƒÉcƒÉrescu and Dora d'Istria, as well as the stepgrandmother of poet Anna de Noailles. Mari»õica's grandson L√©on de Montesquiou was a founding member and doctrinaire of Action Fran√ßaise.

They portrayed themselves as owners of FƒÉgƒÉra»ô Citadel, which came to be depicted on their coat of arms‚Äîhowever, this connection remains historically unattested (see Boyar of Fogaras).CƒÉlinescu, p. 111; Iftimi, pp. 22, 190‚Äì191; Opaschi, pp. 537, 548.

One of Mari»õica's ancestors, Negoi»õƒÉ VƒÉcƒÉrescu, a Wallachian envoy and hostage to the Sublime Porte, was boiled to death in 1668.Opaschi, p. 538 Her great-great- grandfather Ianache VƒÉcƒÉrescu served under Prince Constantin Br√¢ncoveanu during the Pruth River Campaign, and was executed alongside him by the Ottomans.Andronescu et al., p. 26; CƒÉlinescu, pp. 65‚Äì66; Popescu-Cadem, p. 10 Nicolae was an elegiac poet, born to writer IenƒÉchi»õƒÉ VƒÉcƒÉrescu and his third wife, Ecaterina Caragea.CƒÉlinescu, p. 69; Popescu-Cadem, p. 19 According to tradition, IenƒÉchi»õƒÉ was poisoned in 1797 by Prince Alexander Mourouzis, having allegedly courted Princess-consort Zoe.Popescu-Cadem, pp. 10‚Äì14 His other children included Alecu VƒÉcƒÉrescu, born to an earlier wife, Elena Rizo. Himself a poet and social critic, Alecu died mysteriously in 1799, after having been singled out for repression by Prince Mourouzis.CƒÉlinescu, pp. 66‚Äì69; Opaschi, pp. 539‚Äì540; Popescu-Cadem, pp. 15‚Äì18 He left a son, Iancu (Ioan) VƒÉcƒÉrescu, who was also a noted poet. Through this connection, Mari»õica was aunt of the fashion journalist Claymoor and great-aunt of writer Elena VƒÉcƒÉrescu.CƒÉlinescu, p. 983; Popescu-Cadem, pp. 25‚Äì27, 29‚Äì31 Through grandmother Ecaterina, Mari»õica descended from the Caradjas, a prominent family of Greek Phanariotes; her great-grandfather was Nicolae Caradja, who served as Wallachian Prince in 1782‚Äì1783.CƒÉlinescu, pp. 66, 69; Opaschi, pp. 544‚Äì545 and Figure IV Although her father had a congenital hunchback, which prompted him to live in relative seclusion,Popescu-Cadem, p. 19 Mari»õica became a Wallachian belle, described in contemporary sources as \\"jewel-like\\" and \\"blonde like a seraph\\".LƒÉcusteanu & Crutzescu, p. 260 As noted by scholar Constan»õa VintilƒÉ-Ghi»õulescu, her beauty standards reflected 19th-century conventions, which valued sedentary lifestyles: diarist Nicolae Golescu commented that she was \\"quite plump and quite gentle\\".VintilƒÉ-Ghi»õulescu, PatimƒÉ..., p. 215 Various records also note that, like her paternal family, she had a talent for writing poetry; her work remains unpublished. She spent some of her childhood abroad, forced out by the revolutionary unrest of 1821. The VƒÉcƒÉrescus escaped into the Principality of Transylvania (part of the Austrian Empire), finding temporary refuge at Corona (Bra»ôov).Carata»ôu, pp. 391‚Äì392; Popescu-Cadem, p. 19 They later returned to Wallachia, but Nicolae died soon after, possibly while making a return trip to »òcheii Bra»ôovului.

Both countries remained under Ottoman suzerainty but were directly governed by the Russian Empire. This Regulamentul Organic era, which increased the prestige of lesser boyars, allowed the orphaned youth to focus her efforts on social climbing. A first-hand witness to her matrimonial ascent, Colonel Grigore LƒÉcusteanu mentions her \\"superlative pride\\".LƒÉcusteanu & Crutzescu, p. 143 Her \\"vanity\\" and \\"unbound cupidity\\" were noted by the memoirist I. G. Valentineanu, while historian Constantin Gane portrayed her as \\"quite ambitious\\". Mari»õica's first husband was Costache Ghica (1797‚Äì1852), a member of the powerful Ghica family. Their wedding took place in Bucharest, on July 29, 1834. Reportedly, it had the blessing of the BƒÉleanu family, but not of Luxi»õa herself.Andronescu et al., p. 70 This arrangement also made her the sister-in-law of two Wallachian Princes: Grigore IV Ghica, who had reigned in 1822‚Äì1828, and his half-brother, Alexandru II Ghica, who took the throne in 1829.Iosipescu & Ionescu, pp. 39‚Äì42, 45; LƒÉcusteanu & Crutzescu, pp. 235‚Äì236, 250, 257 The latter pledged himself as the couple's godfather during the wedding ceremony, while their godmother was philanthropist Zoe Br√¢ncoveanu,Andronescu et al., pp. 70‚Äì71 \\"one of the richest women in either Danubian Principality.\\" Roxana Roseti, Vlad Teodorescu, \\"Prin»õul rƒÉtƒÉcitor\\", in Jurnalul Na»õional, March 20, 2010 Under his brothers' regimes, Costache had become a Spatharios and Colonel of the Wallachian militia, organized under Russian supervision; he also served terms as Ban (or Caimacam) of Oltenia (1827‚Äì1828, 1830, 1838), alternating with his other half-brother, Mihalache Ghica.LƒÉcusteanu & Crutzescu, pp. 236, 250.

Though the latter accepted the decision and left for Corona, his departure was widely perceived in the country as a tragic event. According to LƒÉcusteanu, Mari»õica played a part in the mourning, and fainted from shock in the grand hall of the princely palace in Bucharest.LƒÉcusteanu & Crutzescu, pp. 133‚Äì134 Ghica's toppling was followed by the princely election of 1842‚Äì1843. It caused political rifts between members of Mari»õica's two families. The Spatharios, probably following his wife's advice, announced himself as a candidate. Mihalache Ghica made of point of not casting his ballot; two VƒÉcƒÉrescus, Iancu and Teodor, presented themselves as both electors and candidates.LƒÉcusteanu & Crutzescu, p. 140‚Äì141, 250, 259.

See also LƒÉcusteanu & Crutzescu, p. 250 The divorce procedure was already in motion in July 1843, when Bibescu and Ghica had a gentleman's agreement, prompting Ghica to sign a document acknowledging that he was no longer intimate with his wife.Strihan, p. 70 She had already moved out of the Ghica manor, and was living at the princely palace. Mari»õica was widely seen as responsible for pushing Bibescu to divorce from Zoe Br√¢ncoveanu, making her the center of a public scandal.Tomescu & Velicu, p. 103 The Prince made sustained efforts and \\"complicated maneuvers\\" to arrange his marriage to Mari»õica, seeking absolution from the Wallachian Orthodox Church and permission from the royal courts of Europe.LƒÉcusteanu & Crutzescu, p. 260; Strihan, pp. 68‚Äì69 The highest ranking Wallachian church official, Neofit II, was a virulent opponent of the new couple. He was joined in this effort by the Ordinary Assembly, over which he presided; its other members became suspicious of Bibescu's attempts to modify the law on dowries. Their counter-proposal was a direct attack on the Prince and his mistress: under this law, adulterous men lost half of their wives' dowries, and were exiled from the country together with their »õiitoare (\\"kept women\\").Strihan, pp. 68‚Äì70 Such proposals were endorsed by the Ghica family, who mounted the opposition in alliance with the Filipescu boyars.Iorga (1938), p. 71 Bibescu was shamed into withdrawing his own project, but obtained permission from Abdulmejid to dissolve the Assembly in 1844; until the legislative election of 1846, he ruled as an absolute monarch.Strihan, pp. 69‚Äì70. See also Iorga (1938), pp. 75‚Äì76, 79‚Äì80 Mari»õica was by then pregnant, giving birth to the Prince's eighth child,Strihan, pp. 69‚Äì70, 70, 71 and her own fourth daughter.Iorga (1938), p. 80 Bibescu had sent her abroad for the delivery, which reportedly occurred at Munich, Kingdom of Bavaria, in 1844. Eventually, in August 1844, the Ecumenical Patriarchate granted Bibescu his divorce; in October, he declared his former wife clinically insane, and obtained control of her estate, which he shared with courtier Alecu Filipescu- Vulpea.Andronescu et al., pp. 104‚Äì106. See also Ghica & Roman, p. 543; Strihan, pp. 69, 70‚Äì71 Neofit turned to blocking Mari»õica's divorce from Ghica, rejecting their application in February 1845. The church tribunal noted that \\"cold relations between husband and wife\\" were not a canonical reason for separation‚Äîhowever, Neofit privately confessed that he would have rejected any of Mari»õica's applications, to get back at the Prince for his dissolving the Assembly. Bibescu responded by appealing to a higher authority, but Patriarch Germanus IV rejected his plea. This left the Prince with only an \\"extreme measure\\": he bribed the Ottoman Divan and obtained Germanus' replacement with Meletius III, who signed off on the Ghica divorce. Some reports suggest that Meletius himself had received kickbacks from Bibescu.Ghica & Roman, p. 544 =As Princess= Gheorghe Bibescu and Mari»õica were then married on September 9, 1845, with a lavish ceremony in Foc»ôani, the Moldavian border town. This highlighted the friendship between the two Principalities and thrones: their godfather was the reigning Moldavian Prince, Mihail Sturdza.»òtefan Cazimir, \\"Puncte de suspensie\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 40/2007Andronescu et al., p. 106; Beldiman, p. 143; Iorga (1938), pp. 76‚Äì77; Strihan, p. 71 Mari»õica sailed down the Danube from Mehadia, where she had followed a beautifying treatment; she was welcomed with gun salutes in all Wallachian river ports,Strihan, p. 71 and received at BrƒÉila by a delegation of boyars, including Filipescu- Vulpea‚Äîwho was by then also her in-law.Iorga (1938), p. 77 The religious service was provided by Chesarie CƒÉpƒÉ»õ√¢nƒÉ, the Bishop of BuzƒÉu, and performed at Na»ôterea Sf√¢ntului Ioan BotezƒÉtorul, a monastery church. Bishop Neofit still disapproved of the marriage, and was therefore uninvited.Iorga (1938), pp. 76‚Äì77; Strihan, pp. 70‚Äì71 The ceremony was followed by a gala ball, with music provided by the Austrian conductor Ludwig Wiest and decorations designed by Moldavian architect Gheorghe Asachi; 50,000 locals were reportedly present. In parallel festivities, the new couple acted as godparents for 12 peasant weddings, donating land and cattle to the new families. Although supporting Romanian nationalism and receptive toward liberalism (including his creation of a customs union with Moldavia), the Bibescu regime alienated the various social classes with its nepotistic habits and especially with its support for a Russian venture capitalist, Alexander Trandafiloff.Iorga (1938), pp. 66‚Äì84; Xenopol, pp. 183‚Äì190. See also Ghica & Roman, pp. 453‚Äì456, 543 Liberals were also confident that the Kingdom of France supported Neofit's obstruction of the princely divorce, which hurt Gheorghe and his Russophile tendencies.Strihan, pp. 70, 71 According to historian Pavel Strihan, the French consul Adolphe Billecocq was \\"the most unusual victim\\" of the divorce scandal, recalled by his government for having suggested that Gheorghe was acting reasonably. However, other records suggest that Billecocq and the Bibescus were enemies, and that the recall was owed to embarrassment over Billecocq's other intrigues.Bibescu, pp. 243‚Äì299 Constantin Lecca's portrait of Princess Mari»õica, painted in 1849, during her stay at Corona (Bra»ôov) On the conservative side, LƒÉcusteanu claims that the overall failures of the Bibescu regime were largely attributable to his young wife's ambitions, which the Prince felt obliged to satisfy. A similar note was made by Austrian general Franz von Wimpffen, who viewed Gheorghe as a weakling maneuvered by his \\"coquette\\" wife. Wimpffen argues that such influence also framed the Prince's nationalist, or \\"Daco-Romanian\\", projects.Nicolae Iorga, \\"CronicƒÉ\\", in Revista IstoricƒÉ, Vol. XIV, Issues 10‚Äì12, October‚ÄìDecember 1928, p. 418 According to a letter of protest signed by Wallachia's conservatives, Gheorghe took revenge on Neofit and, by July 1847, left him completed isolated: \\"Intimidation and corruption have isolated him [...]; he can only shed tears at the plight of his country.\\"VintilƒÉ-Ghi»õulescu, Evgheni»õi..., pp. 195‚Äì196 The bishop finally agreed to a formal reconciliation and baptized Mari»õica's adulterous daughter.Iorga (1938), p. 80; Strihan, p. 71 Gheorghe celebrated his wife's Orthodox name day on September 8, 1847 with a national festivity. This included the inauguration of a wooden bridge over the Olt River, at Slatina.

The opposition was initially peaceful, and issued a Proclamation of Islaz, demanding more rights; it erupted into a more violent revolt on June 9, 1848, when officers Grigore Paleologu and Grigore Pere»õ shot at Prince Bibescu, who was taking a carriage ride outside Bucharest. They only managed to hit one of Bibescu's epaulettes. Various accounts suggest that Mari»õica was by her husband's side, though others have it that the Prince was traveling with his favorite minister, Alexandru Vilara.LƒÉcusteanu & Crutzescu, pp. 147‚Äì149, 263 The following day, rebellious militiamen confronted the Prince with imperative requests for a liberal constitution. Though Gheorghe never made this pledge, he took another oath, \\"on my life and that of Her Highness the Princess\\", that \\"no Moskal shall enter this country\\".LƒÉcusteanu & Crutzescu, p. 149 =Exile= Later that month, Gheorghe secretly left the country, leaving Bucharest to be fought over between the Wallachian provisional government and a conservative dissident, Ioan Odobescu.LƒÉcusteanu & Crutzescu, pp. 144, 151‚Äì163 According to LƒÉcusteanu, the departing Prince was sure that he would be returned to the throne by \\"the Moskals\\", who \\"are set to enter Bucharest in three to four days\\".LƒÉcusteanu & Crutzescu, p. 151 Mari»õica followed her husband into exile, both of them initially settling at Corona.Beldiman, p. 146 On June 29, another conservative coup in Bucharest briefly established a triumvirate comprising Neofit and two of Mari»õica's uncles: Teodor VƒÉcƒÉrescu and Emanoil BƒÉleanu. All three were captured and expelled over the border with Austria.Maria Totu, Garda civicƒÉ din Rom√¢nia 1848‚Äî1884, pp. 54‚Äì55. Bucharest: Editura MilitarƒÉ, 1976. Eventually, the revolution was dealt with by a two-stage invasion of Wallachia, seeing cooperation between the Ottoman Army and Russian forces, led by Mehmed Fuad Pasha, Abd√ºlkerim Nadir Pasha, and Alexander von L√ºders; the only battle was fought over Dealul Spirii in Bucharest.Iorga (1938), pp. 175‚Äì181; LƒÉcusteanu & Crutzescu, pp. 177‚Äì196, 274‚Äì281 By June 1849, Gheorghe's brother »òtirbei had been appointed Prince by both the Ottoman Empire and Russia, returning Wallachia to conservatism. In August 1849, the Bibescus left Austria and set course for a new home in Istanbul. On their passage through BrƒÉila, they were offered a royal reception and gun salute by LƒÉcusteanu, who commanded the local garrison; other members of the LƒÉcusteanu clan joined the former princely couple for the remainder of their trip.LƒÉcusteanu & Crutzescu, p. 207 Gheorghe established friendly contacts with the exiled revolutionaries; resentful of his brother, he returned to Wallachia as a pretender. He lived in the small town of MƒÉgurele, but repeatedly demanded to be restored ownership of the princely palace, which he viewed as his personal property.Iorga (1910), pp. 50‚Äì54, 136‚Äì137 Eventually, Abdulmejid ordered him into exile.Iorga (1910), pp. 67, 137 In the 1850s, the Bibescus moved to the French Empire. For a while, they were joined there by General Ion Emanuel Florescu, who had married Zoe's daughter Catinca Bibescu.LƒÉcusteanu & Crutzescu, p. 241 The former Prince eventually returned to Wallachia after the Crimean War, which curbed Russian influence and placed the Principalities under an international tutelage. He and his brother fought each other to emerge as conservative candidates for the Wallachian throne; »òtirbei was initially the favorite.Harold Temperley, \\"The Union of Roumania in the Private Letters of Palmerston, Clarendon and Cowley, 1855‚Äì7\\"; \\"Four Documents on the Future of Roumania‚Äîby Henry Stanley, D.

Constan»õa and Pulcheria were then married into the Rasponi-Murat family, the former to Gioacchino, a direct descendant of Joachim Murat and Caroline Bonaparte. Initially based in the Papal States, at Ravenna, he was also a noted participant in the movement for Italian unification, and served for a while as Prefect of Palermo.

Aricescu, taken up in the newspaper Curierul Rom√¢nesc or recited in public at a C√¢mpulung gathering. The princely couple responded by shunning Aricescu, who then had trouble finding employment.Tomescu & Velicu, pp. 103‚Äì104 Later in life, Aricescu also published more corrosive poems by a Petrache Eliat, which, he claimed, had also circulated during Bibescu's reign. Some were sexualized in content, and had to be published with ellipses marking censored fragments. One such piece suggests that Mari»õica was having intercourse with her coach driver, or with her brother-in-law »òtirbei. Another Eliat rhyme coined the expression Azi aici, m√¢ine-n Foc»ôani (\\"Here today, tomorrow in Foc»ôani\\"), which refers to Bibescu's erotic haste. Aricescu's perspective was contrasted by portrayals in the Bibescu regime's propaganda, which enlisted poets Ion Heliade RƒÉdulescu and Grigore Alexandrescu. Both wrote her epithalamia in 1845, though Alexandrescu struck his version out of his complete works editions.Bogdan-DuicƒÉ (1923), pp. 181, 274 According to the 1848 revolutionary Ion Ghica, Alexandrescu was a guest at princely dinner parties, but felt humiliated by Mari»õica's offer that he become her court poet.Ghica & Roman, pp. 93, 440‚Äì441 The series of homages to the Princess was completed in 1847, when Heliade's disciple Costache Aristia published Doamna Maria.CƒÉlinescu, p. 150 Later in the 19th century, national poet Mihai Eminescu revisited Gheorghe and Mari»õica Bibescu's plight with more sympathy, producing a rhyme based on Romanian folklore: 1840s propaganda also includes several paintings, often showing the Princess dressed in traditional peasant clothing. According to art historian Ruxandra Beldiman, she may have been the first lady to adhere to this fashion, which also stated her support for the cultural ideals of Romanian nationalism.Beldiman, p. 143 The earliest such canvass, an official portrait, was done by Carol Szathmari, probably in 1845; it combines elements of peasant clothing from Arge»ô County, including a necklace made from coins, with echoes of the Byzantine dress. Szathmari also created a miniature portrait on ivory, showing Mari»õica in an eclectic peasant costume, and following the blue-yellow-red scheme of Wallachian army flags and the modern Romanian tricolor.Beldiman, p. 144‚Äì145 The nationalist imagery is also found in a portrait done by Constantin Lecca and dated to ca. 1849, when the Bibescus were living abroad. Here, Mari»õica is shown in Transylvanian Romanian attire, and operating a loom. The canvass is described by art historian Vasile Florea as one of the works in which Lecca \\"outdid himself\\", and overall as an \\"important genre painting\\".Florea, p. 132 Of these various pieces, the Szathmari canvass was rediscovered by Nicolae Iorga and published in his Histoire des Roumains (1944), but then largely forgotten until 2012, when it was reproduced in color for the first time in its history. Iorga himself attributed the discovery of another such portrait to Constantin Gane, who first published it in 1940.Nicolae Iorga, \\"DƒÉri de seamƒÉ. C. Gane, Trecute vie»õi de Domni »ôi Domni»õe\\", in Revista IstoricƒÉ, Vol. XXVII, Issues 1‚Äì12, January‚ÄìDecember 1941, pp. 165‚Äì166 The Prince and Princess are also commemorated in frescoes at their P√®re Lachaise crypt, done by Auguste LeloirBadea-PƒÉun, pp. 45‚Äì47 and later by Jules Jean Fran√ßois P√©rot. These show her as a penitent and as Mary Magdalene, in probable allusion to her adultery and divorce.Badea-PƒÉun, pp. 45‚Äì46 Additionally, her likeness is preserved in the relief decorating her sarcophagus, which is probably the work of Eug√®ne Andr√© Oudin√©. Several objets d'art belonging to the Princess are preserved at the Museum of the Union in Ia»ôi, and are stamped with her personal coat of arms. The field is a combination of her two family arms, party per fess: the Wallachian bird, displayed as in the Bibescu arms, appears in chief; and the VƒÉcƒÉrescu arms, depicting a knight guarding FƒÉgƒÉra»ô Citadel, in the bottom half.Iftimi, pp. 22, 76‚Äì78 A quartered variant of the combined arms, including the Romanian tricolor, came to represent the Bibescu‚ÄìVƒÉcƒÉrescu descendants. It appears as a relief at P√®re Lachaise, and was also used by the Baroness Courval; Gr√©goire Brancovan also adopted the arms, but with different tinctures. Mari»õica's ascent to the throne was an influence on other members of her original family. Ana-Maria VƒÉcƒÉrescu, married Callimachi, upgraded her version of the VƒÉcƒÉrescu arms to feature a princely crown, rather than the comital crown of earlier depictions.Iftimi, p. 191 NotesReferences 1815 births 1859 deaths Royal consorts of Wallachia Mistresses of Romanian royalty Romanian patrons of the arts 19th-century Romanian women writers Romanian women poets Maritica Maritica Maritica Nobility from Bucharest Eastern Orthodox Christians from Romania Romanian people of Greek descent Romanian nationalists People of the Revolutions of 1848 Wallachian refugees in the Austrian Empire Romanian exiles Romanian expatriates in Turkey Christians of the Ottoman Empire Romanian expatriates in France Deaths from cancer in France Burials at P√®re Lachaise Cemetery ","title":"Mari»õica Bibescu"},{"id":"56421289","text":"Stella Weiner Kriegshaber, Kajiwara Photo Stella Weiner Kriegshaber (January 31, 1879 ‚Äì April 3, 1966)U.S., Social Security Death Index, 1935-2014 was a noted American pianist. Biography Stella Weiner was born in Tipton, Missouri, the daughter of Joseph Weiner, a druggist who owned the pharmacy on 28th and Washington Avenue, St Louis, for many years. When she was 7 years old, her family moved to St. Louis, where she began her music lessons with Mr. Eliling, under whose tuition she remained for seven years. Going through the grammar and high schools, she also took lessons on the organ during that time from him. At the age of eighteen this she studied for a year under A. Epstein, and a course of harmony for five seasons with Ernest Kroeger. She never went abroad to study, never gone away from St. Louis for any instruction in her musical education, believing that she could be guided in this development just as well by resident instructors as by those living abroad. Stella Weiner made her first appearance in public at the age of nine years in St. Louis, at the piano store of P. G. Anton, the father of the violoncellist, P. G. Anton, Jr. On Monday and Wednesday evenings of each week the music store of Anton, then located at 308-10 North Broadway, St. Louis, and later at 11th and Olive Streets, was the gathering place for the men and women who were largely instrumental in putting St. Louis on the musical footing and giving it the prestige which later held in the musical world. Weiner accompanied by her mother and attended these Monday-night musicales, where she was recognized and encouraged for her unusual ability. At these Monday musicales at the Anton Store all were welcome who wished to take part and enjoyed music. Those who wanted to play were cordially received. There was much string music with piano accompaniment, trios, quartettes, quintettes, etc. Among those taking part prominently were Louis Hammerstein, G. Herrich, Ernst Spiering, Egmont Froelich, John Boehmen, Anna Graser Strothotte and her son, Maurice Arnold Strothotte; Robert Bernays, who later married a sister of the bandmaster, Sousa, and resided in Washington until his death; Frank Geeks, Sr. and Jr.; Mr. Ehling, Lena Anton, and others. In 1901 she married David Kriegshaber, a native of Kentucky. He was engaged in the wholesale liquor business. They had two daughters: Edith K. Felsenthanl and Amy K. Lears. Since its organization Kriegshaber was a member of the Tuesday Musical Club, which was the first piano club of any importance existing in St. Louis. Later the St. Louis Musical Club was organized. These two progressed for some time when they united under the name of the Union Musical, and under that flourished for several years, until it was changed again to the St. Louis Musical Club, of which Kriegshaber was the president. One of the objects of the organization was to encourage and aid amateur musicians, and assist them in developing talent that might lead them to a successful career. Once or twice each year they brought artists to give concerts and for many years the incomparable Kneisel Quartette performed in St. Louis under their auspices. Once a month the club held its meeting in the Musical Arts Building. Mrs. Paul Tupper and Mrs. George Frankel each held the office of the presidency. Kriegshaber rendered selections for the popular concerts given by the Symphony Society, and for the Morning Choral. In 1912, she played with the Morning Choral orchestra, but before that her programme consisted only of solos. She also gave numbers for the Union Club, and for Ernest Kroeger's recitals; in 1912 the lectures were on Tristan and Isolde. In 1913 an explanation of Wagner's opera, Die Walkiire, which was played as duos on two pianos to illustrate the various motifs. This opera musicale was given for the benefit of the Smith College Club Fund, which was to be used in endowing chairs in the departments of the college work at the institution. Kriegshaber was the organist for the King's Highway Presbyterian Church. One summer she acted as substitute at St. John's Church. She also gave private lessons at her home. In the Ladies' Friday Musical Club she took a very active part. The meetings took place, as the name indicates, on Friday of each week at the home of some one of the members. The membership was composed almost entirely of Jewish women. The club was organized in 1884 and was always successfully conducted, numbering among its members many of the best musicians of St. Louis. The charter members of the Friday club were Mrs. Louis Hirsch, Mrs. J. P. Weil, Mrs. Adolph Drey and Mrs. Joseph Glaser. The club numbered about twenty-five members, and their work showed the skill of professionals. In 1938 Kriegshaber was included in Who's Who in American Jewry. In 1962, at 83 years old, Kriegshaber participated to the Friday Musical Club 80 years celebrations. In 1916, she performed as soloist with the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra at the University Auditorium, conductor Max Zach. She died on April 3, 1966.

Basu resides inside the campus of National Brain Research Center, Manesar.  Professional profile  The geographic distribution of Japanese encephalitis (in yellow) Basu's research focus is on central nervous system diseases (CNS diseases) and he has studied the central nervous system with regard to how microglia and neural stem/progenitor cells affect the system. The team led by him are involved in research on the pathogenesis of viruses such as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), West Nile Virus (WNV) and Chandipura virus (CHPV) and how they cause neuronal damage in hosts. In 2011, his group identified minocycline, a broad- spectrum tetracycline antibiotic generally used for treating skin infections, as having properties in fighting the disease of Japanese encephalitis, which they discovered through their experiments on mice. The findings were put on clinical trial at the King George's Medical University where it was found to have beneficial effect on Japanese encephalitis and Acute encephalitis syndrome patients who survive the initial attack of the diseases and this has led to a wider study on the subject. He was the guest editor for Clinical and Developmental Immunology journal when they released a special issue on Microglia in Development and Disease in 2013 and has mentored several research scholars in the post-graduate, doctoral and post-doctoral studies.

It was opened as Blairlinn Industrial Estate by the Secretary of State for Scotland on Friday, 22 September 1961. In 1962 Telehoist was one of the first companies to set up there. Some of the early factories were about 22,000 square feet with room for enlargement. Large companies using the estate include Farmfoods, Dreams, and Mackintosh. There are over 20 other companies in the complex. North of the estate is a steep glen through Luggiebank Wood which is now a nature reserve managed by the Scottish Wildlife Trust. History West Blairlinn Farm (ruin) Before the building of the new town, there were three farmsteads known as Wester, Mid and Easter Blairlinn. All three were south of the Luggie Water with Wester Blairlinn near the east bank of the Shank Burn and Easter Blairlinn near the west bank of the Cameron Burn. Mid Blairlinn and Easter Blairlinn are reported to have had some coal within 900 feet of the surface. There seems to have been an old flax mill at Pettycastle, West Blairlinn.

In 1892 there was a season of opera in Chicago, and she decided to have an interview with a newspaper editor and suggest sending her to Chicago to write a series of articles and criticisms in advance of the St. Louis season. She received the appointment and attended the rehearsals to tell the readers what they might see that evening. She attended eight performances a week, and wrote a column each day. She was assisted in this by Pol Plancon, the De Rezkes, Emma Eames and other singers in the company. During her residence in London writing dramatic and musical criticisms, she began contributing to magazines, both American and English, while sending letters to the daily papers in St. Louis, as a special correspondent, on any subject that came before the public which she thought might be of general interest. In 1896, returning to St. Louis, she remained only six weeks, then went abroad again and stayed until 1899 writing for both American and English papers. St. Louis mayor Rolla Wells, Frank D. Hershberg, Florence Hayward, Fair president David R. Francis, Archbishop John J. Glennon, and Vatican commissioner Signor Coquitti (l to r) at the opening of the Vatican Exhibit at the 1904 World's Fair. Photograph by Jessie Tarbox Beals. Hayward became involved with the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St Louis after she was asked by an agent to misrepresent a play named America. She was told that the play should be recommended because it was linked to the Chicago's World's Fair. This proved not to be the case and she shared this information with the organisers in St Louis. As a result, she was given an appointment by the fair's board. She was given a large salary to go abroad and select material to exhibit at the Exposition. Hayward and the board annoyed the \\"Board of Lady Managers\\" as they understood that they world represent women's affairs. Hayward took little notice of their status, and she was the only woman member of the main board. Hayward set off and in London she found they had just recovered from the Boer War. Instead of beginning with the manufacturers she went to the King to request the Queen's Jubilee presents should be exhibited. At the next meeting of President D. R. Francis and the commissioners in London, it was her pleasure to inform them of her success in reserving valuable exhibits. Her next move was to go to Italy and get the Pope to give his consent to making a Vatican exhibit, which had never been done before. Through Cardinal Satolli arrangements were consummated. Francis put her in charge of historical exhibits in the anthropology division, which had originally been assigned to Pierre Chouteau III who had made little progress. Despite being the only woman on the Board of Commissioners she created successful anthropological exhibits, publicizing the fair, and acquiring significant exhibit items. When Francis published a history of the fair in 1913, he did not mention Hayward's contributions and she never forgave the slight. Hayward was included in photographs of the St Louis fair organisers and she was given authority to negotiate exhibits, but in the end she received no more credit that the Board of Lady Managers, who were also sidelined. Although it was noted that the directors of the World's Fair presented her with the same kind of medal that was sent to the Kings, the Pope, and other heads of nations. Hayward's success grew out of an acquaintance with international politics, and her taking advantage of the Venezuelan situation as between Great Britain and the United States. She suggested to the King, through the Ambassador, that he show his friendly feeling to the United States by making this loan. The presents were sent to the United States wholly through her diplomatic efforts, and she made her own selections from both palaces and museums. Six guards accompanied the shipment. Journalist Marguerite Martyn made this composite for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in 1914 from a photo by the Gerhard Sisters, with Martyn's drawings representing notable people whom Hayward had met. Her Travel Letters to the different newspapers in St. Louis from abroad and they would include a wide variety of subjects. For many years she was a contributor to The Century and Harper's Bazaar magazines in America, and Country Life, Pall Mall Gazette, Jerome's Idler and the Daily Mail in London. For a long time she was the only woman writer for English Country Life. The Artists' Guild As the founder of the Artists' Guild, her idea was to establish a permanent guild; previous \\"Painters,\\" \\"Brush and Pencil\\" Clubs, and others, had not lasted. She thought to bring together the painters, sculptors, architects, musicians and literary people, and time proved her to have been right. The first meetings were held at the home of Hayward for nearly two years; later when the number grew larger ‚Äî in other places; first in the old art museum, and after that in club rooms of their own in different localities, until the erection of their building on Union Avenue, of which Louis C. Spiering was the architect. The membership was limited to about two hundred. The work of the members was on exhibition to the public, and was open at all times. Hayward became the secretary of the guild and held that office several times. She was also the treasurer, as well as chairman of the examination committee ‚Äî a title corresponding to that of president. Honours and legacy Hayward was presented at the Royal Court, as well as the Vatican, where a private audience with the Pope was granted. In 1904 she was made Officer d'Instruction Publique by the French Government. The Royal Society of Arts of Great Britain appointed her a member, and also a Fellow of the Royal Meteorological Society. She died on July 4, 1925, at the home of her brother at 5843 Waterman Avenue, St. Louis, where she lived, and is buried at Bellefontaine Cemetery.

Sebou River, which flows to the Atlantic ocean, was an easily navigable river and it flows through the Atlas Mountains and reaches the inland area such as the city of Fez. During the middle age, holding this area was a key for establishing the logistical, military and commercial advantage. As such, the kasbah was heavily contested by many states throughout the history.ŸÇÿµÿ®ÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖŸáÿØŸäÿ©. Museum with no Frontiers. Retrieved January 27, 2018. The foundation dates back to the assembly building which was likely built as a part of the harbor in the 10th century. In the 12th century, the Almohad Sultan Abd al-Mu'min established a dock and attached fort in the place, using the high quality woods from the neighboring forest. The rest of the city of Mehdya remained small but used as a resource center within the trade between Europe until the 16th century. In 1515, the Portuguese captured the area and the fort, but the occupation only lasted for 47 years. In the 17th century, after the place was briefly used as a center for piracy, the local authority had attempted to gain independence, only to be occupied by the Spain. The Spanish constructed a fort on top of the stone which overlooks the mouth of the river. The citadel wall built as a part of the castle had become the basis of the current structure. The area was recovered by the Alaouite Sultan Ismail Ibn Sharif in 1681, who gave the castle its current name. Sultan Ismail carried out a full scale construction of the kasbah in the ruins of the Spanish fort. He built an establishment for administration (Dar el-Makhzen), mosque, barracks, madrasa, funduq (traditional inn) and stables. The Sultan also restored the broken citadel walls, and demolished the southern part of the wall for the construction of defense towers and moats. He maintained the three towers on the northern side. He also constructed the monumental entrance gate on the shore, which was named as Bab al-Jadid. His detailed construction also extended to the interior, where exist four halls surrounding the sahn adorned by zellige. There exist a garden and hamam as well.

Antal was known for her strong faith and her love for the Mother of God; she had long desired to enter the religious life as a nun but settled on the Secular Franciscans after the communist regime suppressed convents and monasteries in Romania. Since her death she has been known as both \\"Saint Veronica\\" and has also been titled as the \\"Maria Goretti of Romania\\" due to the manner of her death similar to that of Goretti. Her beatification cause opened in 2003 and she became titled as a Servant of God; Pope Francis confirmed that she died to preserve herself as a virgin against vice in 2018 which confirmed her beatification (as opposed to needing a miracle). The beatification was celebrated in Romania on 22 September 2018. Life Veronica Antal was born on 7 December 1935 in Bote»ôti as the first of four children to George and Eva; she received baptism on 8 December in her local parish from Father Felix Rafaelli. Her parents named her in honor of her paternal aunt who died at a tender age. Her parents spent so much time at work in the fields that her grandmother Zarafina raised her and instructed her in the faith; it was in her childhood her devotion to the Blessed Virgin manifested. Her schooling was spent in her hometown from age seven where she earned good grades before leaving to join her parents to work in the fields. But it was when she was sixteen that she began manifesting a desire to enter the convent as a Franciscan nun. Antal wanted also to help children. This never materialized because the communist regime had suppressed all convents and monasteries in Romania. Antal instead joined the Secular Franciscan Order (which her spiritual director Alois Donea directed her to) and then made a private vow to remain chaste. Antal walked five miles to the nearest church just so that she could receive the Eucharist. Antal also joined a choir aged sixteen and also joined the Militia Immaculatae that Maximilian Kolbe founded. Not long before her death she began reading about Maria Goretti and confided later to two friends that she wished to act much like Goretti. On the evening of 24 August 1958 she returned from her local parish after having just received Confirmation from Petru Ple»ôca when Pavel Mocanu began to harass her en route home. He made indecent proposals to her and then attacked her in a vain effort to rape her. But Antal fended him off to the point he stabbed her to death with a knife 42 times. Her parents grew alarmed that she had not returned home so searched for her. Labourers en route to work discovered her corpse in the middle of a field on 26 August and discovered one of her rosaries clasped in her hands. Her face was downwards covered in blood with a cross of corn pods on her back. Her funeral was celebrated on 27 August. One friend present with Antal during the Confirmation said that \\"Veronica seemed pale and downcast\\" and later had a meal with one friend before the friends left and Antal travelled home. Beatification The beatification process opened under Pope John Paul II on 10 July 2003 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" (nothing against) edict and titled Antal as a Servant of God; the diocesan process was held in Ia»ôi from 25 November 2003 until 12 November 2006. Documents collected during this time (including the 200 written testimonies that Fr. Eugen Blajut collected in 1994) were sealed in boxes and sent to Rome to the C.C.S. that December where the C.C.S. later validated the process on 24 May 2008. Pope Francis confirmed her beatification on 26 January 2018 after determining that Antal died in order to protect her chaste state from the sin of rape; the official term was \\"in defensum castitatis\\". Her beatification was celebrated in Romania on 22 September 2018 with Cardinal Giovanni Angelo Becciu presiding on the pope's behalf. The current postulator for this cause is the Conventual Franciscan friar Damian-Gheorghe PƒÉtra»ôcu.

The protests were inspired by Vida Movahed (), an Iranian woman known as the Girl of Enghelab Street (), who stood in the crowd on a utility box in the Enghelab Street (Revolution Street) of Tehran on 27 December 2017, tied her hijab, a white headscarf, to a stick, and waved it to the crowd as a flag. She was arrested on that day and was released temporary on bail a month later, on 28 January 2018. Some people believe that Movahed's action was based on Masih Alinejad's call for White Wednesdays, a protest movement that the presenter at VOA Persian Television started in early 2017. Other women later re-enacted her protest and posted photos of their actions on social media. These women are described as the \\"Girls of Enghelab Street\\" and \\"The Girls Of Revolution Street\\" in English sources. Some of the protesters claim that they didn't follow Masih Alinejad's call.  Islamic Republic's Penal Code  In the Islamic law of Iran imposed shortly after the 1979 Islamic revolution, article 638 of 5th book of Islamic Penal Code (called Sanctions and deterrent penalties) women who do not wear a hijab may be imprisoned from ten days to two months, and/or required to pay fines from 50,000 up to 500,000 rials. Fines are recalculated in the courts to index for inflation. Article 639 of the same book says, two types of people shall be sentenced one year to ten years' imprisonment; first a person who establishes or directs a place of immorality or prostitution, second, a person who facilitates or encourages people to commit immorality or prostitution. These are some of the laws under which some protesters were charged.  Background  Before the Iranian Islamic Revolution of 1979 (during the reign of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran), the hijab was not compulsory, though some Iranian women during this period wore headscarfs or chador. After the 1979 Islamic revolution, the hijab gradually became compulsory. In 1979, Ruhollah Khomeini announced that women should observe Islamic dress code; His statement sparked demonstrations, which were met by government assurances that the statement was only a recommendation. Hijab was subsequently made mandatory in government and public offices in 1980, and in 1983 it became mandatory for all women. In 2018, a government run survey dating back to 2014, was released by President Hassan Rouhani, showing that 49.8% of Iranians were against compulsory or mandatory hijab. The report was released by the Center for Strategic Studies, the research arm of the Iranian President's office, and was titled \\"Report of the first hijab special meeting\\" on July 2014 in a PDF format. On 2 February 2018, a poll conducted by the Center for International and Security Studies at Maryland (CISSM) showed that a few Iranians agreed with \\"changing Iran's political system or relaxing strict Islamic law\\". Iran is the only country in the world that requires non-Muslim women to wear a headscarf. For example, in January 2018, a Chinese female musician was forcibly veiled in the middle of her concert performance.  Timeline = December 2017 = 27 December  On 27 December 2017, pictures and videos of Movahed waving her scarf went viral through the hashtag \\"Where_is_she?\\" (, \\"Where is the girl of Enghelab Street\\" in Persian) on social media. While at first she was unknown, days later, Nasrin Sotoudeh (), the human rights activist and lawyer who has also been arrested, found out that the woman is 31 years old and was arrested on the spot with her 19-month-old baby. = January 2018 = 28 January  On 28 January 2018, according to Nasrin Sotoudeh, the lawyer investigating the case, Vida Movahed was released; temporary on bail.  29 January  On 29 January 2018, a woman was arrested in Tehran after reenacting Movahed's protest by standing on the same utility box in Enqelab Street, taking off her white Hijab, and holding it up on a stick. Photos has been posted on social media show that at least three other women reenacted Movahed's protest in Tehran on 29 January, including one near Ferdowsi Square.  30 January  According to Nasrin Sotoudeh on 30 January 2018, the second woman who was arrested on 29 January 2018 was Narges Hosseini (); her age is 32. On 30 January 2018, several more women, but also men, protested against the compulsory hijab law by reenacting Movahed's protest.

She was sentenced to two years in prison in addition to an 18-year suspended prison term. In addition, she stated that she left Iran.  22 February  Another woman named Maryam Shariatmadari () was protesting compulsory hijab in the afternoon on a utility box; the police asked her to come down and the woman refused and questioned the police what's her crime, \\"disturbing the peace\\" the police replied.

It resembles Euphorbia regis-jubae, with which it has been confused. Both have been called Euphorbia obtusifolia. Description Euphorbia lamarckii resembles Euphorbia regis-jubae; their distributions do not overlap. It is a shrub up to tall, with light brown stems, undivided leaves and small yellowish-green floral bracts. The inflorescence is usually a compound umbel. The elaiosome (caruncle) attached to a seed is sessile or has only a very short stalk. It differs from other Canary Island species of Euphorbia in the shape of the compound, umbel-like inflorescences, that are yellow-greenish in colour, and by the floral bracts falling off before the fruit ripens. File:Euphorbia lamarckii (El Paso) 02.jpgIn fruit; floral bracts have fallen off Taxonomy Euphorbia lamarckii was first described by Robert Sweet in 1818. It is considered to be synonymous with E. obtusifolia Poir. and E. broussonetii, but not with E. obtusifolia Lam. There has been considerable confusion over the scientific name to be used for one of the more common species of \\"tabaiba\\" found in the Canary Islands. Much of the literature used the name E. obtusifolia Poir., based its publication by Jean Poiret in 1812. However, the name had already been used in a different context by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck in 1788, so Poiret's name is illegitimate. A proposal to conserve the name Euphorbia obtusifolia , in view of its widespread use, was rejected in 2000. Although the name Euphorbia broussonetii has been used (and defended) by some sources, the earliest, and hence correct, name is considered to be Euphorbia lamarckii. An additional complication is that the name Euphorbia obtusifolia has been used \\"indiscriminately\\" for two species found in the Canary Islands: the western species, now called E. lamarckii, and the eastern species Euphorbia regis- jubae. In 2003, David Bramwell listed seven publications from 1847 to 1993 that gave the wrong names or the wrong distributions for these species. =Varieties= Juli√°n Molero and Ann Maria Rovira recognize two varieties: *Euphorbia lamarckii var. lamarckii (syns E. virgata, E. obtusifolia Poir.) ‚Äì only found in southern Tenerife *Euphorbia lamarckii var. broussonetii (Willd. ex Link) Molero & Rovira (syns E. broussonetii, E. dendroides var. broussonetii, E. obtusifolia Poir. var. wildpretii) ‚Äì found everywhere else, including north Tenerife The varieties differ in that var. broussonettii has broader leaves with a more rounded tip, and the outermost bracts have a less pointed apex with a shorter point (mucro). Distribution Euphorbia lamarckii is native to the western Canary Islands: Tenerife, north-west La Gomera, La Palma and El Hierro. Its distribution does not overlap with Euphorbia regis-jubae, which is found in the eastern islands: Gran Canaria, Lanzarote and Fuerteventura.

The scheme was primarily overseen by Anatoly Chubais. The scheme benefited Yeltsin in acquiring funds to assist his bid for reelection. To make the companies profitable, the new investors sought to restructure them and install a western-style management approach. However, that required them to push out entrenched managers with communist allegiances. This had already become an immensely more cumbersome task once the communists took control of Russia's legislature in the 1995 elections and would be made excruciatingly challenging if the communists were to take control of Russia's executive government.https://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/polisci/faculty/treisman/PAPERS_NEW/Loans%20for%20shares%20Post- Soviet%20Affairs%20for%20website.pdf Consequentially, in order for the companies turn a profit, investors felt that the Communists would need to lose the election. The auctions were rigged and lacked competition, being largely controlled by favored insiders with political connections or used for the benefit of the commercial banks themselves.Privatization in Transition Economies: The Ongoing Story - ed. Ira W. Lieberman, Daniel J. Kopf, p.112 The scheme was structured in a manner that made Yeltsin's victory a strong interest of the investors involved. The two-stage program was structured so that the loans would be made before the election, but the auction of the shares could only take place after the election, making it of financial concern for them that Yeltsin would win the election. On August 31, 1995, Yeltsin held an initial meeting attended by ten Russian business moguls about banking issues. In his remarks, Yeltsin made comments about his belief that the banks should have a political role. \\"Russian bankers take part in the country‚Äôs political life. ‚Ä¶ The banks, like all of Russia, are learning democracy.\\" The loans-for-shares auctions in November‚ÄìDecember 1995 allowed the more conspicuous of \\"the oligarchs\\", as they were now known, to reposition as captains of industry. Initially dreamt up by Vladimir Potanin of Oneximbank, this privatization scheme was backed by Chubais but also by Kremlin conservatives like Soskovets, who was the one to get Yeltsin's signature on it. At bargain-basement prices, Potanin picked up Norilsk Nickel, the world's number one smelter of palladium and nickel, and he, Mikhail Khodorkovskii of Menatep, and Boris Berezovskii acquired the oil giants Sidanco, Yukos, and Sibneft. In 1995, facing severe fiscal deficit and in desperate need of funds for the 1996 presidential elections, the government of Boris Yeltsin adopted a \\"loans-for-share\\" scheme proposed by banker Vladimir Potanin and endorsed by Chubais, then a deputy prime minister, whereby some of the largest state industrial assets (including state-owned shares in Norilsk Nickel, Yukos, Lukoil, Sibneft, Surgutneftegas, Novolipetsk Steel, and Mechel) were leased through auctions for money lent by commercial banks to the government. The auctions were rigged and lacked competition, being largely controlled by favored insiders with political connections or used for the benefit of the commercial banks themselves. As neither the loans nor the leased enterprises were returned in time, this effectively became a form of selling, or privatizing, state assets at very low prices. A \\"less cynical\\" interpretation was proposed by Professor of political science and international studies, Russell Bova, who offered as an alternative, that Chubais may have been motivated by concerns that privatization would fail, that in the face of mid-1990s economic difficulty, the country might revert towards a Communist resurgence if progress was not maintained, and that in light of these concerns, the long term political goals of democratization and asset distribution from state hands to private ownership might have been deemed more important than possible short term gains from the asset sales: \\"[I]f that meant undervaluing State assets then so be it\\".State-Building in Russia: The Yeltsin Legacy and the Challenge of the Future p.35, ed. Gordon B. Smith, quote by Russel Bova The scheme has been perceived by many as unfair, and it is the loans-for-shares scheme that gave rise to the class of Russian business oligarchs, who have concentrated enormous assets, further increasing the wealth gap in Russia and contributing to the political instability. Furthermore, in the medium-term, this scheme significantly hurt Russian growth since the oligarchs realized that their purchases could be seen as fraudulent by future governments and thus they attempted to strip assets from the government enterprises rather than build them up.

Studio Tamani is based in the Maison de la Presse (Press Centre) in Bamako. It is a joint initiative of Mali‚Äôs main community radio network URTEL, ‚Äúpeace media‚Äù specialist Fondation Hirondelle, Sweden, Switzerland and the European Union. The programs are produced by a team of 60 Malian journalists, with an editorial staff in Bamako and 35 correspondents across the country. Studio Tamani has emerged as a \\"voice of reason\\" and trusted source for local, national, regional West-African and International news outlets for daily news, updates on terrorist attacks as well as stability and progress on the Algiers Peace Accord in Mali. Broadcasting from this war-torn country‚Äôs capital, Studio Tamani has received respect in foreign policy circles for bringing implacable enemies together for dialogue, and has been cited by international organizations such as UNESCO as an example of the importance of reaching people in their local languages to be a viable platform for dialogue among disparate groups. Studio Tamani, was founded during the Malian civil war with the goal of producing high-quality news and debate programs, and has been said to have transformed Mali‚Äôs media landscape. In a vast country with isolated populations where only one third of the adults are literate, many local languages are spoken, and internet access is still sparse in rural areas, radio is the most available source of news and information for all. Everybody listens to at least one of the country‚Äôs plethora of radio stations. Tamani stands out it's fact-based reporting, interviews of locals who have witnessed first-hand terrorist attacks and intimidation from armed groups, as well as for hosting high-level political figures, broken major stories, aired unprecedented debates on controversial topics like female genital mutilation, and become one of the most widely listened-to and respected radio stations. The name \\"Tamani\\" is the name of a small djembe drum popular in Malian musical heritage, and serves as a positive image for this project focused on facilitating and promoting dialogue between all Malians. One of Studio Tamani stated objectives is to produce news bulletins and other radio programs designed to help strengthen peace and reconciliation in Mali. Studio Tamani‚Äôs programming is broadcast by 24 partner radio stations throughout the country. A network of community radio stations also partners with Studio Tamani, broadcasting programs for two hours a day throughout Mali in French, Bambara, Sonrha√Ø, Tamashek and Peulh. Many of Studio Tamani's journalists have been trained abroad and have been featured in international forums to improve the knowledge and understanding of the complexity of the security and political situations in Mali and have assisted the international community in further understanding the complexity of Mali and why the stability of the country is under constant threat. Studio Tamani has been featured as a voice of reason for daily news, humanitarian issues and peace building by the Malian and international press. While events in war torn country indicate that the threat of war is ever present in Mali, Studio Tamani's team of journalists have been known to push for dialogue between all groups in the conflict.

It is located just to the east of Missoula, and is approximately fifty miles long. The entrance to the canyon is known as Hell's Gate. Name Hellgate Canyon's name is a reference to an ambush that occurred there, in which the Flathead Indians were defeated by the Blackfeet. The evidence of these ambushes was known as the \\"gates of hell\\", which led to the canyon acquiring its current name. Historical significance Hellgate Canyon contains some ancient pictographs estimated to be about 5,000 years old. Lewis and Clark passed through Hellgate Canyon during their expedition through the Western United States. Later in the 19th century, Carrie Strahorn, also an explorer, wrote about a stagecoach ride she took in the area in 1878. She described, among other things, a \\"veritable Lover‚Äôs Lane\\" formed above the canyon by an arch of wild roses. During the mid-19th century, as Montana was further colonized, the canyon became a major strategic corridor in the region, and the Mullan Road was routed through it. The Northern Pacific Railroad and Milwaukee Railroad were later routed along a similar path. French-Canadian settlers in Montana thought that the local Native Americans, especially those of the Flathead Nation, traveled through Hellgate Canyon to hunt for bison.

Life  The son of a rural pastor, Balthasar Cellarius was born in Rottleben, a village in the hills west of Leipzig and north of Erfurt. He grew up in modest circumstances, obtaining his schooling atfrom the Gymnasium in Gera. In 1632 he moved on to Jena where he studied Theology, emerging in 1638 with a Magister (\\"Masters\\") degree. Between 1637 and 1641 he supported himself as a teacher and author. He spent around a year working in Wittenberg during 1641/42 and then went to Rudolstadt near Jena, where he was employed as a \\"mentor\\" by Friedrich Hofer von Uhrfahren, a leading citizen of the town. In 1642 he joined the University of Helmstedt, where he became a lecturer. Here he met Georg Calixtus, later described as his tutor, and Konrad Hornejus. The three began to exchange ideas. After two years, on 5 July 1644, apparently at the instigation of Georg Calixtus, Cellarius was summoned to move to Braunschweig to become a preacher at the St.-Ulrici church. Two years later he was called back to Helmstedt to take up the office of General Superintendent, and the associated Theology professorship. A senior colleague, Justus Gesenius, objected to the appointment, believing that Cellarius had yet to pass all the necessary examinations. In the event the appointment was deferred for two years, but went ahead in 1648. An intriguing further detail is that around this time Balthasar Cellarius married Elisabeth, one of the daughters of Justus Gesenius. Justus Cellarius, the couple's son, was born towards the end of 1649.Joachim Schmid: Cellarius, Justus. In: Horst-R√ºdiger Jarck, Dieter Lent u. a.

Cellarius now took on a second professorship at Helmstedt, and gave lectures on the New Testament, focusing on the Pericopes. He also joined in the polemics against the Roman Church. In 1650 the University of Helmstedt received a visitation in the course of which doctorates were conferred on Balthasar Cellarius, along with Gerhard Titius. At the same time he was appointed Abbot of the monastery at Marienthal. He managed largely to steer clear of the Syncretistic controversy with the so-called Orthodox Luterhans. On 10 April 1656 Cellarius delivered the funeral oration for his old teacher, the controversialist Georg Calixtus. Cellarius himself died on 15 September 1689.
