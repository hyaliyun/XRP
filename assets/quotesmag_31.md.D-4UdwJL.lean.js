The game pitted the Nevada Wolf Pack and the Villanova Wildcats. This was the 3rd and final edition of the Harbor Bowl. Background As an NCAA University Division independent, the Wildcats won 7 of their 10 games while being invited to their second bowl game in two years. The Wildcats had beaten Texas A&M;, Miami and North Carolina State while tying Kentucky. The Wolf Pack (also an independent) finished with nine victories, the most in one regular season for the Wolf Pack, who were making their second straight bowl game appearance. The Wolf Pack had beaten Tulsa, Wichita, Fresno State, and San Jose.

While traditional SMC utilizes chopped glass fibers in a polymer resin, CFSMC utilizes chopped carbon fibers. The length and distribution of the carbon fibers is more regular, homogeneous, and constant than the standard glass SMC. CFSMC offers much higher stiffness and usually higher strength than standard SMC, but at a higher cost.  Manufacturing  Scheme of the tow-based microsructure of CF-SMC. CF-SMC are made up of carbon tow chunks, spread between two layers of uncured thermosetting resin. The carbon fibre tows are cut from prepreg UD tape. The originating tape can be made up of a certain number of fibres (filaments), thus affecting the properties of the final composite: values can vary from 3 to 50 thousand filaments, while typical tow lengths are within 10 to 50 mm. As for the resin, thermosetting resins are used: possible choices are polyester, vinyl ester or epoxy, with the former being the cheapest and the latter being the most performant. Despite not being as strong nor stiff as epoxy, vinyl ester is often used for its properties like corrosion and higher temperature resistance. The constituents are combined in sheets of prepreg material. The tows usually fall from the cutter onto one of the two layers of resin, and are then covered by the second layer. The prepreg sheets of SMC are made after the viscous assembly is compacted via rollers. In this phase, any control over the orientation of the fibres is generally impossible, and the fibres can be considered to have an equiprobable orientation in all directions. Once the prepreg sheets are made, the material can be compression moulded into the final desired shape. Compression moulding is a manufacturing technique that requires a two part mould: the first one hosts the moulding material (charge), while the second one is mounted on a press to close the cavity while applying high pressure. Due to complex geometry, it may be necessary to cut the sheets to place them more easily in the lower mould. Then, while the upper mould cavity is closing, the material is pushed throughout the mould until closed. Pressure is maintained, together with elevated temperature, to allow the curing of the resin and low porosity. This stage has a heavy influence on the mechanical performances of the final product, as the viscous flow into the mold cavity tends to orient the fibers along the direction of the flow. By controlling the amount and direction of the flow, it is thus possible to influence the fibre orientation, having a quasi-isotropic material (low-flow moulding) or higher performances in a desired direction (high-flow moulding). During the manufacturing phase, it is also important to avoid, when possible, defects like weld- lines. Weld lines occur when two flow fronts of material meet during the filling of a mold cavity. This can sometimes result in air entrapment, inhibited crosslinking in the polymer matrix, or the clumping or absence of fibers. For these reasons weld-lines can be as weak or weaker than the neat polymer resin.  Material Properties  Different behaviour, in terms of stress strain curve, of CF-SMC according to the orientation of the tows. In the picture are shown the two (irrealistic) extreme cases of the tows perfectly aligned parallel or perpendicular to load direction. Due to their heterogeneous and anisotropic microstructure, mechanical properties of CF-SMC can vary significantly within broad ranges. Parameters having profound impact on these materials performances are mainly related to the fibres and matrix neat mechanical and geometrical properties (especially those of the fibres) and the orientation and content of the reinforcement. Modulus can vary from less than 20 GPa to 60 GPa, while strength values are within 60-500 MPa. CF- SMC can also be engineered, to some extent, to have better performances in a specific direction, in a similar fashion as continuous fibres composites. This can be achieved by carefully controlling the compression moulding stage to influence fibre orientation. When the fibres are mainly aligned with the loading direction, the material behaviour is mainly dominated by that of the fibres, thus resulting in stronger and stiffer, but also more brittle response. In the opposite case, if fibres tend to dispose perpendicular to the loading direction, the resin contributes more to the load bearing, and the overall composite will be less stiff, less strong and more ductile. Being based on hydrodynamic transport phenomena, however, the control over fibre orientation in CF-SMC is much more limited than in the continuous composites case, where orientation is often directly determined accurately by the manufacturer. In addition, while continuous fibres composites have a specific orientation, short fibre reinforced plastics can have a preferential orientation, meaning that, considering a generic system of axis, the majority of fibres can have a higher component along a direction and a lower component along the other two axis. Comparison of the accurate fibre orientation in a laminate of UD plies (a) and the preferential orientation achievable with CF- SMC (b). The discontinuous tow-based microstructure of these materials makes is even more heterogeneous than standard composites: fibre ends themselves acts as stress concentration areas for both the resin and the neighbouring tows; moreover, especially for complex shaped parts, it is impossible to prevent some local spots with badly aligned tows (e.g. perpendicular to the direction of axial stress) or with low fibre volume content, like resin pockets. Although making the material weaker and the structural design more complex, this feature makes these materials quite notch-insensitive. When moulded, CFSMC has a very different appearance than traditional carbon fibre fabric composites, which traditionally appear with a woven checkerboard pattern. CFSMC has the appearance of black and grey marble or burl.  Industrial use  CF SMC combines the lightweight properties of carbon composites with a manufacturing process, as compression moulding, that allows fast manufacturing and thus is suitable for high volume industrial applications. For these reasons, the automotive industry is one of the best candidate for this technology. Car manufacturers have used standard glass SMC for over 30 years as a material for body panels in select sport cars such as the Chevrolet Corvette. Substituting glass fibres with carbon is a recent development, having been used for significant structural components of the 2003 Dodge Viper, the multifunctional spare wheel pan of Mercedes-AMG E-Class, the Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren, the 2009 Lexus LFA, 2015 Lamborghini Hurac√°n, the 2017 BMW 7 series and 2017 McLaren chassis. Lamborghini (together with Callaway Golf Company) patented an advanced version of CF-SMC called Forged Composite. They first introduced it in the Sesto Elemento concept car, and since then, Forged Composite has been a distinctive mark for Lamborghini cars, used both in structural and aesthetical purposes. CF-SMC use is recently spreading also to the much broader non-high performance automotive sector as for the 2017 Toyota Prius PHV. CF-SMC has also been used in the aeronautic industry by Boeing, for the 787 Dreamliner window frames, while producers suggest that the use of these materials will grow in this sector as well.

Located in Antigua it was opened as an informal women's training school in 1840, by Bishop George Westerby of the Moravian Church. The private school's goal was to train Caribbean women to teach other Caribbean women. It operated for 118 years, until 1958, and was the longest-lived training institution founded by missionaries in the region. History The Female Teachers' Training School opened in Lebanon, Antigua, in 1840 at the home of Moravian Bishop George Westerby as an exclusively female training academy providing an education for five girls who wanted to become teachers. The missionary goal to prepare women to be good wives and mothers for the male teachers expanded to train women to be teachers themselves. Westerby and his wife's success with their initial trainees, led them to seek \\"black and coloured\\" girls between the ages of ten and fifteen to be trained to teach others about cleanliness, industry and order. Students were boarded and provided with clothing and lodging, as well as training. The school was one of the earliest educational organizations in the region and was moved to Spring Gardens, when it was officially organized in 1854. It offered classroom instruction along with industrial education and manual work and was geared to training teachers who would be able to instruct others to learn a trade. The school was a Moravian institution and received very little financial support from the government. The intent of the organization was to train women, who were indigenous to the region, to teach students throughout the Caribbean. The class of 1855 included ten pupils, which increased to sixteen students by 1858. Westerby retired in 1873 and was replaced by Reverend Romig. In 1887, the school had the largest enrollment of any school in the region, though attendance was often half of enrollment, in the Leeward Islands. In the period between 1840 and 1891, 161 students had graduated. For the first thirty-eight years of the school's existence, the majority of its funding came from the Mission Board in Germany, but in 1892, the Government of the Leeward Islands agreed to pay for the education of eight girls for a cost of ¬£25 annually. The contract effectively meant that the school had to meet government standards with regard to curricula, staffing, and student make-up, expanding the citizenship and religious affiliation of the students. Around the same time, the Government of Barbados extended scholarships as well. Until 1894, the director of the school was always an ordained minister who reported to the German Mission Board. Other staff consisted of a principal and a female full- time tutor, who also served as house matron. Staff was traditionally secured in England until 1892, when for the first time teachers trained locally were secured as instructors. Because Antigua is located in the center of the Leeward Islands it is easily accessible to all of the islands of the Lesser Antilles and Spring Gardens was well-known throughout the region. Students typically came from pupil-teacher programs widely in use in the region. As a general rule, its students had low academic preparation causing the under- funded normal school to teach general knowledge in addition to providing professional training. In 1900, the name was changed to Spring Gardens Teacher Training College in an effort to refocus on professional training. Always a financial struggle to stay afloat, the depression caused by falling sugar prices in 1906, and the government's decision to cut education grants in 1913, caused further hardship. In 1914, the Barbadian government withdrew its grants and students, as well, making plans to build its own facilities. Then during World War I, the Moravian Church lost all of its German investments and discussion turned to whether the school should be closed. In 1918, the Leeward Island Government decided that it was less expensive to utilize the facilities at Spring Gardens than to build their own schools, giving new life to the school. In the years following the war, the school operated as a hybrid institution, partially a secondary education facility and partially a teacher training college. The Marriot-Mayhew Commission, which investigated the school systems in the Leeward and Windward Islands during 1931, wrote a scathing report on education in the area in general, calling the education provided backward, except in Barbados and Trinidad, and the conditions of facilities deplorable. Arthur Mayhew, the chief adviser on education in the colonies to Britain, and F. C. Marriott, director of Trinidad‚Äôs education programs, wrote in their report that Spring Gardens had a low standard both academically and professionally. They went on to report that staff was inadequately trained in the techniques of teaching and had no understanding of the relationship between schooling and community needs. But their assessment was similar for all of the schools not located in Barbados or Trinidad. They made no recommendations to improve the conditions at the school and their attempts to redirect students to distant Trinidad were ineffective. Then in the late 1930s through the mid-1940s, the Moyne Commission investigated education conditions in the British West Indies again. Recommendations from that report caused the Leeward Island Government to pressure the Moravians to expand the school and improve conditions, or face government withdrawal of support. Though the school adopted numerous survival strategies, including accepting paying students, it limped through the next few decades. Lack of will on the part of government authorities to invest in teacher training, or address organizational issues put forth by the Antigua Teachers Association, kept the institution in a state of limbo. The school lowered entrance requirements in an attempt to gain more paying students, but that simply eroded the already declining standards. In the 1950s, the school offered training in handicrafts for the first time. Though for many years the government had given grants and scholarships to the school, they had no part in the administration of the school until 1954. At that time, the school board was revised with only two members representing the Moravian Church and the other four members as representatives of the government. In 1955, Spring Gardens opened its courses to male students for the first time. When Spring Gardens closed in 1958, it had the distinction of having been the longest operating training institution founded by missionaries in the region. The government announced that at the end of the term, it would no longer support the school financially, choosing instead to found a new training college. In 1960, students from Spring Garden were moved to the Leeward Islands Teachers' Training College (LITTC) which opened in Golden Grove, in St. John's Parish. LITTC operated until 1977, when it was absorbed into Antigua State College.

Harris in 2008 Grace Harris Signature Grace E. Harris. (July 1, 1933 - February 12, 2018), was a retired administrator from Virginia Commonwealth University. Harris was one of the first African American faculty members hired by Virginia Commonwealth University in 1967, which initially rejected her admission on the basis of race, when it was known as Richmond Professional Institute (RPI), when she was a graduate student in 1954. She would later rise through the ranks at the university to become Dean, Provost, and Acting President on two occasions, becoming the highest-ranking African American and highest-ranking woman in VCU's history. Harris had formerly been employed as a social worker, supervisor, and executive director in public and nonprofit social service agencies in Hampton and Richmond, VA. Active in community organizations in the Richmond area, Harris has served on numerous boards, task forces, and commissions. She served on the advisory board of the Virginia Health Care Foundation and the Virginia Commission on Higher Education Appointments, of which she has been a member since its establishment by former Gov. Mark Warner in 2002. She also was vice chair of Warner's transition team ‚Äî Put Virginia First. Early life and education Born Grace Victoria Edmondson, Grace was named after her maternal aunt, Grace Ewell Harris, who had also eventually married a Harris. Growing up, Harris' parents and grandparents were teachers and preachers. Grace's father, Elisha Edmondson, was a science teacher at the high school in Halifax, which was, until 1969, a segregated school. The name Edmondson is allegedly derived from Edmonds, the name of a white family in the Halifax area who were once slave owners of Harris' ancestors. Grace's father held graduate degrees, as well, in science. Her mother, Elizabeth (Ewell) Edmondson, was an elementary school teacher. Her maternal grandmother was an elementary school teacher, and her grandfather was a minister. Her great-grandfather was the founder of The Piney Grove Baptist Church in Halifax County, Virginia. Grace was the third child amongst six siblings. She has five sisters, the late Sue E. Wilder, a data analyst at NASA for 35 years and one of the agency's Hidden Figures, Marian Brazziel, Elizabeth Soares, Mamye BaCote, a former member of the Virginia House of Delegates, and Lola Sadler, as well as one brother, William Edmondson. Grace graduated high school from Halifax Training School in 1950, where she was class valedictorian. Halifax Training School, located in South Boston, a town in Halifax County, Virginia, was once a school created solely for African American students when schools were segregated in the county. Harris spent a semester at Grinnell College in 1952 as an exchange student from Hampton Institute, a historically black college in Virginia. She was involved in a program designed to promote interracial understanding at both schools. She was one of five African Americans at the school at that time. Harris received her Bachelor of Science degree in sociology from Hampton Institute, now Hampton University, graduating with highest honors. Harris was originally denied admission to Richmond Professional Institute in 1954 on the basis of race. Due to race relations in the state at this time, African American graduate students were offered assistance to attend public institutions out of state as part of an arrangement made by the state of Virginia. Harris went on to attend Boston University from 1954 to 1955, where Martin Luther King, Jr. was among her classmates. She would later attend Richmond Professional Institute, now known as Virginia Commonwealth University, to complete her Master of Social Work degree in 1960. She received Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degrees in sociology from the University of Virginia in 1974 and 1975, respectively.  Career  = Academic Appointments and other Significant Work Experiences = Beginning her career in 1955, Harris worked as a caseworker in Hampton, Virginia in the Department of Public Welfare until 1957, and eventually a caseworker and Supervisor in the Department of Welfare and Institutions in Richmond, Virginia, until 1963. In 1963, Harris went on to become Executive Director of the Friends' Association for Children, Richmond, Virginia, a position she held for three years. In the year following, she was Director of the Richmond Community Action Program. From 1967 to 1976, Harris served as assistant professor in the School of Social Work at Virginia Commonwealth University, the university that initially rejected her admission in 1954. During her last year as assistant professor, Harris was Director of Student Affairs in the School of Social Work. In 1976, Harris became associate professor in the School of Social Work. Two years later, while associate professor, Grace was named Associate Dean of the School of Social Work at Virginia Commonwealth University, a role she maintained for two years, until 1980. In the year following, she was named Fellow in Academic Administration for the American Council on Education, which was an Internship with President and Vice President for Academic Affairs at Virginia Commonwealth University. In 1981, Harris became Professor and Associate Dean in the School of Social Work, a position she held for a year, until 1982. For eight years following, she was Dean and Professor in the School of Social Work at Virginia Commonwealth University. In 1990, she was named Vice Provost for Continuing Studies & Public Service. In 1993, she moved on to become Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs. During the summer of 1995, she was named acting President of Virginia Commonwealth University, and then once again in 1998. Following her retirement from her position as Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs in 1999, Dr. Grace E. Harris was named Director of the Grace E.

He became known in France and internationally following his arrests for helping more than 250 migrants cross into France from Italy. Herrou's efforts have been described in the media as the \\"French Underground railroad\\". After numerous convictions for assisting migrants to cross the border, Herrou's actions were found to be legal by the French Constitutional Council, which found Herrou's actions to be covered under the constitutional exercise of fraternity to others. Life Herrou was born in 1979 in Nice, France and is an olive farmer in the area of Breil-sur-Roya. In 2015, Herrou began regularly crossing the French-Italian border near his farm to offer assistance to refugees wishing to enter France. He has been arrested several times for doing this. Arrests and prosecution In August 2016, Herrou was arrested while transporting eight migrants in his van across the Italian-French border. After concluding that Herrou's intent was humanitarian, the French prosecutor in Nice declined to press charges. On October 20, 2016, Herrou was arrested after he and three other activists occupied the former SNCF railway station Saint- Dalmas-de-Tende, near Tende, France. Herrou was assisting fifty migrants, principally from Eritrea and the Sudan, to cross into France from the Italian city of Ventimiglia and housing them at the disused railway station. The prosecutor, who called Herrou's actions \\"noble\\", requested an eight-month suspended sentence. The actual sentence is expected to be handed down by the court on February 10, 2017. On January 18, 2017 Herrou was taken into custody by local police, with his brother and one other person, for assisting three Eritrean migrants in crossing the border into France. They were released on January 20 without charges being filed. On 10 February 2017, a trial court in Nice convicted Herrou for aiding illegal arrivals and of fined him ‚Ç¨3,000. On July 6, 2018, the French Constitutional Council ruled that Herrou's actions to help migrants were legal, since the principle of fraternity in the French constitution specifically \\"confers the freedom to help others, for humanitarian purposes, regardless of the legality of their presence on national territory.\\" On May 13, 2020, the Appeals Court of Lyon voided all charges against Herrou. Public reaction Herrou's actions raised the interest of the French public. Arriving for his trial in January 2017 in Nice, he was met by the applause of hundreds of members of the public who supported his actions as well as some who did not. That same month, an editorial addressing Herrou as well as the issues raised by his actions was published by the editorial board of The New York Times.

Corn-Cob was an informal term, promoted by the editors of NZ Railfan magazine, describing a New Zealand railway locomotive livery (resulting from the combination of green and yellow in the colour scheme) found in common usage amongst the railfan community. The livery was introduced on 5 May 2004 when Toll Rail took over the rail system from Tranz Rail and replaced the Bumble-Bee livery. The livery was replaced by the KiwiRail Phase One livery in July 2008. DX 5379 was the first locomotive to wear the livery. The livery represents the colours of Toll Rail and the colours of Australia. When KiwiRail took over the rail system from Toll Rail, the Toll brandings on the locomotives was covered by patched which had the KiwiRail logo on them. As of , one DHs, two DSCs, two DSJs and one TR still operate in this livery. Variations Since the introduction of the livery in May 2004, there has only been one variation: *DXB 5143 received the livery in June 2008, had been repainted with a deeper yellow on the front of the cab, running boards and at each end of the loco, however the cab-sides were repainted in lighter shade of yellow. It also lacked the green stripes and Toll Rail insignia on the nose. This was only short-lived and the loco never operated in the livery. *Although not an official variation, DBR 1295 wore the livery without the Toll Rail branding on the short-hood.

She was also a teacher and populariser of the game, and developed the English Bridge Union's \\"Bridge for All\\" teaching programme. Biography Sandra Ogilvie was born in the London suburb of Shirley, near Croydon. The family moved to Brighton during World War Two to escape the German bombing. Her parents played bridge, and she taught herself to play the game as a child. Her mother died when she was seventeen, and she became her father's bridge partner. She was educated at Hove County Grammar School for Girls, and then went on to study mathematics at St. Anne's College, Oxford, where she was the first woman to play in the Varsity Match (bridge) against Cambridge University. She next took a postgraduate diploma in numerical analysis and automatic computing at New Hall, Cambridge, where she met the mathematician Peter Swinnerton-Dyer (an international bridge player in the 1950s). While at Cambridge, she won a second half blue: this time for playing bridge in the Varsity Match against Oxford. In 1967 she married Peter Landy, who died in 2005. They had a son and a daughter. She taught computer science at Brighton University. She took early retirement to devote all her time to bridge administration and teaching, and to playing the game. At the university, she headed the Information Systems Division. She was one of six coauthors of a retrospective article entitled Fifty Not Out, marking fifty years since the first British students started studying for degrees in computer science, which appeared in the Summer 2015 issue of the computer science journal ITNOW. She was a member of the English Bridge Union's (EBU's) Board of Directors from 1989 to 1996, and served on the Selection Committee for many years. She was responsible for developing the EBU's \\"Bridge for All\\" teaching programme. As part of this, she developed an Acol-based bidding system called \\"Standard English\\", intended to be easy for beginners to learn, and wrote a number of books in the \\"Really Easy Bridge\\" series (see Bibliography). She was the non-playing captain of the Great Britain Open Team which won the 1991 European Championship. She received the EBU's Diamond Award in 2016. In her opinion, the difference in aggressiveness between men's and women's bridge (the latter being more passive) might be related to testosterone levels. In England at least, she was known for the \\"Landy Game Try\\" - not a convention, but an axiom - \\"First you bid game - then, you try to make it.\\" On retiring from her work with the EBU, she moved back to the Hove area, where she became a parish councillor in her local village and edited the village newsletter. In 2004 the newsletter won the National Association of Local Councils (NALC) Council Newsletter of the Year award, which she said was as exciting as winning a world championship. In 2014, she was one of eight people who were recognised for their contribution to communities in Brighton and Hove in the second Older People's Day Awards. She was recognised for her work in her past professional life and remained widely admired for her pioneering work. When presenting her award, the Mayor of Brighton and Hove said: ‚ÄúSandra Landy has shown great courage in her fight with dementia. Most courageous is her ability to speak about her condition to others. She is admired due to her immense knowledge as a pioneer of computers at Brighton University and her determination to keep active memory loss. She is inspiring to all those around her.\\" She had been working with the Trust for Developing Communities to design a dementia toolkit to improve the lives of those suffering from the condition, and gave regular talks to medical students and professionals on her experiences. She joked: ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt a clue what I‚Äôve done to get this award but I clearly deserve it.‚Äù Death Sandra Landy died on 4 January 2017, aged 78. The cause of her death was meningitis. According to her Telegraph obituarist: \\"A woman of great charm, Sandra Landy was a quiet ambassador for the game of bridge\\", who was \\"congenial and convivial\\".

She was the world's highest ranked female player from 1992 to 1996 and from 1999 to 2000. Her most famous partnership in international events was with Sally Brock. She represented England 11 times in the Lady Milne Trophy, and twice in the Camrose Trophy, and won most of the EBU's domestic competitions. This included the Gold Cup in 1984.

The viaduct is along the Prinses Beatrixlaan. An important part of light rail is the coupling of the Hague tram to the Zoetermeer City Line (formerly part of the NS). To make this possible, it was decided to build a branch of the Hague tram elevated between Ternoot to the railway station Laan van NOI, where it connects to the existing line. In the business area Beatrixkwartier to improve access, a station was built halfway along the viaduct. Before construction could begin the first station Ternoot was moved a few hundred meters, otherwise, there would be no room for the curve CS Beatrixlaan. Both the viaduct and the integrated station were designed by Zwarts & Jansma Architects. The overpass is built up of an open tubular structure, which is reminiscent of a fishnet stocking. Due to this strong construction are relatively large spans possible and the number of columns can remain limited. The viaduct segments are assembled on site, prefabricated steel rings and tubes. To do this, a temporary assembly was built on the route. In a special conserving hall (composed of shipping containers) the viaduct parts were provided with a protective coating. The viaduct is ridden by light rail 3 and 4. A similar fishnet structure applied in 2014 at the Railway bridge over the Dieze and The Royal Welsh Bridge in 's-Hertogenbosch, and is applied to the complete 2016 terminal of the Rotterdam metro line E between Slinge and The Hague Central.

W. Forsyth Princes Street, Edinburgh & Renfield Street, Glasgow. 1953. The present Glasgow Warriors versus Edinburgh Rugby matches are a continuation of that first Inter-City match in 1872. They now play for the 1872 Cup each season. Rugby Unions The Scottish Rugby Union was set up in 1873 as the Scottish Football Union. Scottish rugby clubs could apply for membership. District 'football' unions were also set up to develop the game at a more local level. Newly founded clubs usually applied to their District 'football' union for membership first, to become established, before being accepted into the national Scottish Football Union. The North of Scotland Rugby Union, initially formed as Scottish Northern Counties Football Union, was set up in 1887.Midlands First and Last. John Methven. H.B Rutherford publishers. 1989 The Midlands District Rugby Union, initially formed as Scottish Midland Counties Football Union, was set up in 1889. By 1890, the South is noted as playing Edinburgh District in December of that year. The Anglo-Scots were playing South by December 1898. In 1924, the Scottish Football Union became the Scottish Rugby Union. The SRU also standardised the 5 native districts by formally changing their set-ups to Glasgow District, North of Scotland, Midlands, South of Scotland and Edinburgh District Rugby Unions. Combined sides =West v East= Although West of Scotland District and East of Scotland District occasionally played other districts, the biggest district trial match usually was the West of Scotland District versus the East of Scotland District. Players from the various districts were split along geographical lines for the West ‚Äì East match, which was used as a selection trial match for the Scotland national rugby union team. It began in the spring of 1876 and its purpose was to broaden the opportunities for selection for all players throughout Scotland, not just the Glasgow District and Edinburgh District players who already were showcased in the Inter-City match. Thus, after the West - East fixture was introduced, the Inter-City match became an annual event from 1876‚Äì77 season onwards. However, the Scottish Rugby Union later standardised the trial matches outwith geographical districts from 1934‚Äì35 season onwards. There was usually a Blues Trial versus Whites Trial match where the possible candidates for international selection were represented; then a second final trial match where a typical Scotland Probables line-up would play the Scotland Possibles in a 'probables versus possibles' or 'Scotland versus Rest of Scotland' match. Gradually the West versus East trial match lost importance. By the onset of the Second World War it was used as a proving match for young talent. The West ‚Äì East match continued up to the 1973‚Äì74 season as a junior match; but after that, the Districts took control of their own junior sides by fielding Under 23 sides.Forsyth's Rugby Record. pub.

They would then play the 'Rest of Scotland' or a combined North-South team, usually known as the Provinces District side. This practice although rare was usually kept for international touring sides.

Glasgow District, Edinburgh District, South and North were initially picked, with the Midlands District players entered into the North side. Midlands District complained to the SRU and a combined team, North and Midlands, was entered in subsequent seasons. These 4 teams became the standard District sides. Other District matches were still played out with the Championship. Midlands still played North; and Glasgow still played Rest of the West. Gradually, however, the season's District matches settled on the 4 standard sides, although the Anglo-Scots were an increasing addition to the non-championship Inter-District matches and touring International teams were invariably entertained. The Anglo-Scots entered the championship in 1981.Forsyth's Rugby Record. pub. R. W. Forsyth Princes Street, Edinburgh & Renfield Street, Glasgow. 1981. Professionalism When the Scottish Rugby Union adopted professionalism in 1996, it decided to professionalise the 4 standard district teams. Glasgow District became the Glasgow Warriors; Edinburgh District became Edinburgh Rugby; North and Midlands became Caledonia Reds; and South became the Border Reivers. The Scottish Exiles were not included in this revamp as the Scottish Inter-District Championship became a European Qualifying Tournament for the Heineken Cup. Presently, with only Glasgow Warriors and Edinburgh Rugby remaining, Glasgow has nominally taken over the Caledonia Reds district and Edinburgh has taken over the Border Reivers district. The 4 standard districts still survive at age grade level and the SRU still has a long-term goal of having 4 professional district sides once again in Scotland.

Johnson is a former Superintendent of the Chicago Police Department Career =Patrolman= Johnson began his career in the Chicago Police Department in 1988 as a patrol officer. He was appointed Commander of the 6th CPD District in 2008, and CPD Chief of Patrol in 2012. =Interim Superintendent= Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel endured controversy when appointing Johnson as his interim superintendent in 2016 considering Johnson was not one of the three finalists selected by the Chicago Police Board. Johnson did not apply for the job out of respect for Deputy Interim Superintendent John Escalante. Emanuel named Johnson as the Interim Police Chief on March 28, 2016. =Superintendent= On April 13, 2016, a day after the Chicago City Council Public Safety Committee bypassed the Chicago Police Board with a fast-track vote, Johnson was officially sworn in as Chicago Police Superintendent after his nomination was approved unanimously by the Chicago City Council in a 50-0 vote. =Dismissal= On December 2, 2019, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot terminated Johnson's employment with the City of Chicago for what she termed a \\"series of ethical lapses.\\" Impact Johnson led a department of over 13,400 officers, the second-largest police department in the United States, who defended use of force training, more community policing and a court monitor to oversee department-wide reforms which included the DOJ and the Chicago Police Accountability Task Force (CPATF). The CPATF was initiated by Mayor Rahm Emanuel to investigate the shooting of Laquan McDonald and was once headed by the present Mayor of Chicago Lori Lightfoot. Johnson was appointed superintendent in 2016 by Mayor Rahm Emanuel to restore the public's trust after Emanuel delayed releasing the video of Jason Van Dyke's fatal shooting of Laquan McDonald for over a year. Johnson said that the Laquan McDonald incident changed Chicago's trust in the police department and that officer morale fell as a result of the lack of trust. Chicago‚Äôs homicide rate stood at a 20-year high of 792 in 2016 when Johnson was appointed superintendent, and fell to 561 by the end of 2018. Johnson credited the use of data analytics to decrease homicides and shootings, and approved of the DOJ's investigation into CPD shootings that found widespread excessive use of force and racial discrimination by the CPD. It led to a consent decree, a federally-enforced agreement that oversees CPD reforms. As a result of the consent decree, Johnson validated the CPD's community policing efforts, making substantial improvements in officer training, which eventually led to a decrease in officer-related shootings. Controversy Johnson's early support and ultimate reversal in the firing of Officer Robert Rialmo over the 2015 Christmas shooting of Quintonio LeGrier and accidental death of Bettie Jones continued to shadow his term in office as superintendent. Another controversy linked to Johnson was the high-profile case against actor Jussie Smollett, who was accused of staging a fake hate crime on Chicago's North Side. Smollett was charged with a crime for the plan and execution of a hoax and abusing CPD's resources and manpower. However, the charges were subsequently dropped by State's Attorney Kim Foxx, enraging Johnson as well as Mayor Emanuel. Johnson defied collaborating with the U.S. Federal government‚Äôs efforts to round-up illegal immigrants as a sanctuary city, embroiling Johnson with newly-elected President Donald Trump. Trump in turn traded words with Johnson, who criticised Chicago officials over their mishandling of the city's high crime rate. In October 2019, Johnson refused to attend a speech by Trump at the International Association of Chiefs of Police that took place in Chicago, a move supported by Mayor Lori Lightfoot. Trump called Johnson's absence a \\"disgrace.\\" Johnson called Trump's words frivolous and stated that he \\"would not attend the conference while racial insults and hatred are cast from the Oval Office.\\" Mayor Lori Lightfoot said, \\"Superintendent Johnson showed President Trump what true leadership and character look like.\\" On November 7, 2019, Johnson announced his intention to retire from the Chicago Police Department (CPD). Johnson's retirement announcement, effective at the end of 2019, followed an incident where police officers had found Johnson asleep in his city-owned vehicle on October 17, 2019. Johnson later told Mayor Lightfoot that he had consumed alcohol earlier that evening, requesting an internal investigation into the incident, to which Johnson expressed that he was ‚Äúnot concerned\\" about the outcome. On November 8, 2019, Mayor Lightfoot appointed retired Los Angeles police chief Charlie Beck as the city's interim superintendent. On December 2, 2019, Mayor Lightfoot terminated Johnson's superintendent contract for cause, effective immediately, indicating that he had misrepresented the reason why he was sleeping in his vehicle; however, Johnson remained an employee of the CPD, as the Mayor's action was technically a demotion. On December 4, 2019, he chose to accept retirement under his career service position as lieutenant, which completely severed his relationship with the CPD. On October 15th, 2020, CPD officer Cynthia Donald sued Johnson for sexual assault and harassment. Personal life Johnson was born on the Near North Side of Chicago, Illinois in the Cabrini‚ÄìGreen Housing Projects and, at age 10, moved to the Washington Heights neighborhood. Johnson currently resides in the near South Side neighborhood of Bridgeport. Johnson recalls his mother telling his father about the new neighborhood as a \\"Quiet place, compared to the old neighborhood\\" and that Johnson recalled, \\"Gunshots all night long\\" while living in Cabrini‚ÄìGreen.

Mindegade runs from north to south from Fiskergade to Dynkarken and the square Europaplads. Mindegade gradually evolved from around 1606 as the city slowly extended southwards as the harbor was expanded and the river was covered up. The name is from some time before 1796 and refers to the nearby outlet of the river; the word \\"minde\\" is an old Danish world for river mouth and \\"gade\\" means street. Mindegade is fairly narrow and is a one-way street going from north to south. *The street contains two listed buildings; Trods Katholm and Hans Broge's House.  History  The city gate Mindeport was originally situated at the end of Mindegade and is first mentioned in the 1500s. Mindeport was the gate travelers coming from the south had to come through. After coming through the gate one had to move over the bridge Mindebroen to cross the Aarhus river and move on into Skolegade and the city proper. In 1690 the city gate was moved further south to Dynkarken by Ridderstr√¶de but as the area became more heavily populated it was eventually moved to S√∏nder All√©. In 1857 the octroi taxes were abolished and Mindeport along with the rest of the gates in the city were torn down. In 1606 the large mansion ¬ªTrods Katholm¬´ was erected at the southern edge of the city by Fiskergade. The area was not especially attractive and new developments tended to mostly happen to the north and west. In 1634 the bridge Mindebroen was built across the Aarhus river south of Trods Katholm and it became possible to develop a new neighborhood by the river mouth. The new neighborhood was initially called \\"over broen\\" (Lit. Over the bridge) and later \\"Mindegade\\" and \\"Dynkarken\\". The harbor saw a series of expansions in the 18th century and the piers were gradually extended into the bay which made Mindegade increasingly attractive and a main thoroughfare to the city center. The proximity to the harbor and the road leading south made it an attractive area for merchants who built many of the buildings in the street, including Hans Broge's House. In the 1930s the river by the coast was paved over and Mindegade lost its significance as a thoroughfare.

Classification PC strand is classified according to the number of steel wires in a strand: 2 wire strand, 3 wire strand, 7 wire steel strand and 19 wire steel strand. It can be classified according to the surface morphology and can be divided into: smooth steel strand, scoring strand, mold pulling strand (compact), coated epoxy resin steel strand. They can also be classified by diameter, or intensity level, or standard. Specifications In the description and list of the table we often see, there are 15-7Œ¶5, 12-7Œ¶5, 9-7Œ¶5 and other specifications of the prestressed steel strand. To 15-7Œ¶5, for example, 5 said a single diameter 5.0mm of steel, 7Œ¶5 said seven of the steel wire to form a strand, and 15 that the diameter of each strand of 15mm, the total meaning is \\"one The beam consists of 7 strands of diameter 15 mm (each having a total diameter of about 15.24 mm, a dimensional deviation +0.40 -0.20; a diameter of about 5.0 mm per filament).

The theoretical breaking value is 140 * 1860 = 260.4 kN, which can withstand the tension of 156.24-169.26 kN according to the prestressing standard of 60% -65%. Materials Using high-carbon steel wire rod, after surface treatment it is cold drawn into steel wire, and then the strand structure will be a number of steel wires stranded into shares. Next the elimination of stress by way of a stabilization process. In order to extend durability, the wire can have metal or non-metallic coatings, such as galvanized, or epoxy resin coating. In order to increase the bond strength with the concrete, the surface can have nicks and so on. The prestressed strands of the mold are twisted to form a mold compression process, the structure is more compact, and the surface layer is more suitable for anchoring. Production of unbonded prestressed steel strand (unbonded steel strand) using ordinary prestressed steel wire, coated with oil or paraffin after the packaging into high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bags. Features The main characteristic of the prestressed steel strand is high strength and relaxation performance is good, the other when the more straight. Common tensile strength levels of 1860 MPa, as well as 1720, 1770, 1960, 2000, 2100 MPa and the like intensity levels. The yield strength of this steel is also higher. Application In most of the post-tensioned and pre-tensioned prestressed project, smooth steel strand is the most widely used prestressed steel. Stranded strand is mainly used to enhance the project, but also for nuclear power and the like works. Galvanized steel strand commonly used in the bridge of the tie rod, cable and external prestressing works. Epoxy coated steel stranded wire is similar to galvanized prestressed steel wire.

The group was made up of Konjo and Amba fighters and was led by Isaya Mukirania. It disbanded in 1982 following successful peace negotiations with the Ugandan government.Prunier, 82. See Kirsten Alnaes, \\"Songs of the Rwenzururu Rebellion,\\" in P.H. Gulliver, ed., Tradition and Transition in East Africa (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1969), 243-272.  History  After decades of being subjects of the Tooro Kingdom, the Konjo and Amba peoples asked the British colonial government in Uganda to provide them their own district in the 1950s, separate from the Toro District. The colonial authorities denied their request, and the Bakonjo and Baamba subsequently launched a low-intensity guerrilla war against the government in response. In the 1960s, the movement began to shift its objective from creating a separate district to creating a fully independent kingdom, and on 30 June 1962, the movement declared an independent Kingdom of Rwenzururu with Isaya Mukirania as king, three months before the independence of Uganda. The violence reached its height in 1963 and 1964, when Tooro soldiers massacred Bakonjo and Baamba as they sought control over the lower valleys. The Ugandan army intervened against the Rwenzururu, doing such significant damage that the movement was suppressed for some time. One of the units that took part in the suppression of the Rwenzururu movement was the Ugandan 1st Battalion. After the Uganda‚ÄìTanzania War and the collapse of the regime of Idi Amin in 1979, Rwenzururian fighters looted abandoned weapons and supplies left by the retreating Ugandan army, reestablishing themselves as a serious threat in the region. However in 1982, the administration of President Milton Obote negotiated a settlement with the leaders of the movement, in which they agreed to abandon the goal of secession in exchange for \\"a degree of local autonomy\\", the appointment of Bakonjo and Baamba to government administrative posts, and economic benefits such as vehicles and educational scholarships distributed by local elders. During the negotiations, the government preferred direct talks, as they believed third-party mediation would give legitimacy to the Rwenzururu claim. Amon Bazira, who was a key supporter of the movement to overthrow Idi Amin, had been a key person in the negotiations between the Rwenzururu movement and the Obote government. His belief was that the movement was a largely middle class organisation that could be appeased with commercial prizes. Bazira later approached President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire and President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya, both of whom had grounds for disliking the new Ugandan government led by Yoweri Museveni, and asked for support for a new Bakonjo-led rebellion under an organisation called the National Army for the Liberation of Uganda (NALU). In 1993, Bazira was assassinated at the State House of Kenya in Nakuru, a probable target of Ugandan agents.Prunier, 83 In 1995, Sudanese agents engineered the merging of the remnants of NALU with the Uganda Muslim Liberation Army and the Buganda monarchist Allied Democratic Movement in order to give these latter organisations a local constituency, creating the Allied Democratic Forces.Prunier, 87  See also  * Rwenzori Mountains  References  Rebel groups in Uganda Kingdom of Rwenzururu ","title":"Rwenzururu movement"},{"id":"52787440","text":"Pumping station under construction, the source of the diverted water, May 2018 Haikou Nandu River Water Diversion Project () is a project to divert water from the Nandu River to parts of Haikou Prefecture, in particular, an agricultural area west of Haikou City where lychee are grown.http://www.haikou.gov.cn/xxgk/szfbjxxgk/cztz/zfcg/cggg/201510/t20151009_891539.htmlhttp://www.hq.xinhuanet.com/news/2013-11/26/c_118295366.htm Tunnel construction One of the many access pit showing tunnel The project is ongoing in 2017 and includes a pumping station on the east bank of the Nandu River just south of the Longtang Dam.

In 1930, Shemitz worked briefly for the Soviet-controlled Amtorg Trading Corporation, AMTORG, a job found for her by Hutchin's partner Anna Rochester. In May 1930, Shemitz joined scores of artists, writers, and educators, all members of the John Reed Club, (at 102 West Fourteenth Street, New York) in signing a protest against \\"Red-baiting\\" protest. They included: Sherwood Anderson, Franz Boas, Walt Carmon, Malcolm Cowley, Floyd Dell, Carl Van Doren, John Dos Passos, Max Eastman, Fred Ellis, Kenneth Fearing, Waldo Frank, Harry Freeman, Hugo Gellert, Michael Gold, William Gropper, Jack Hardy, Josephine Herbst, Eitaro Ishigaki, Alfred Kreymborg, Joshua Kunitz, Louis Lozowick, A.B. Magil, H.L. Mencken, Scott Nearing, Joseph North, Isidore Schneider, Edwin Seaver, Edith Segal, Upton Sinclair, John Sloan, Raphael Soyer, Genevieve Taggard, Carlo Tresca, Louis Untermeyer, Edmund Wilson, and Art Young. At least one co-signer was a classmate (Jacob Burck), another a roommate (Grace Lumpkin), two were sponsors (Grace Hutchins and Anna Rochester), and two were teachers (Jan Matulka and Boardman Robinson). In April 1931, Shemitz married Whittaker Chambers. In May 1931, she contributed a cartoon to the New Masses magazine. In 1932, when her husband's name appeared as an editor, the names of Esther Shemitz and Jacob Burck appeared as (art) contributors for the New Masses alongside longer-term contributors like Louis Lozowick, Hugo Gellert, William Gropper, William Siegel, and Joseph Vogel. =Soviet underground= Shemitz cut short her own art career when her husband entered the Soviet underground in mid-1932. Thus, unlike most of her circle, who contributed to publications such as the Daily Worker newspaper and New Masses magazine, she did not become one of the New Deal's Federal Art Project artists during the latter part of the Great Depression and into World War II. Reuben Shemitz (Dec 1948), Shemitz's older brother In 1938, when Chambers defected from the underground, Grace Hutchins delivered a death threat against him, through her brother, attorney Reuben Shemitz. Later, following a grand jury investigation in December 1948, Reuben Shemitz told the press: > (Hutchins) said she wanted to see him on a 'matter of life and death' ... > She assured me that no harm would come to my sister or her children if Whit > would get in touch with someone known to Whit as Steve (J. Peters). In his 1952 memoir, Chambers detailed: She managed the family's Pipe Creek Farm from the late 1930s until the mid-1950s. =Hiss Case= Foley Square in 2014 in New York City, site of grand jury and trials in the Hiss Case. During deposition for the slander suit of Alger Hiss against Chambers in 1948, the Hiss legal team's rough treatment of Shemitz was the final factor in leading Chambers to disclose the existence of his \\"life preserver,\\" which contained the \\"Baltimore Documents\\" and the \\"Pumpkin Papers.\\" During the Hiss Case and trials, Shemitz corroborated and often augmented much of her husband's testimony. (She further explained, \\"I am now trying to remember things I had shut out of my mind, I thought completely.\\" ) In December 1948, with indictments in the Hiss Case pending, Shemitz struck an elderly female pedestrian with her car; the woman soon died. The accident made front pages: Soon after, the case was dropped, as the victim had repeatedly attempted suicide by jumping in front of oncoming cars. =Aftermath= Shemitz was subject to rumors from Hiss supporters, particularly one claiming that not only were she and Lumpkin lesbian lovers but they were also involved in a four-way menage with their allegedly gay husbands ‚Äì most recently put forward in biography of lesbians Anna Rochester and Grace Hutchins. In fact, Hutchins was the source of many such rumors: another she spread to the Hiss defense team was that Shemitz had told Hutchins that Chambers had spent time in the Westchester Division of the Bloomingdale Insane Asylum, a claim she later withdrew. (Robert Cantwell, a close friend of Chambers, had received treatment there in the 1940s; \\"Robert Cantwell\\" was an alias Chambers had used in the Soviet underground. ) A.B. Magil (a long-time Daily Worker writer and editor and CPUSA member) told Elinor Ferry (a Hiss supporter) that Chambers' wife and her roommate Grace Lumpkin appeared to be lesbians. \\"Esther was masculine in appearance and in her voice. Grace was the softer, more feminine type.\\" The overall experience of the Hiss Case led Shemitz to avoid all press and never speak to researchers, including Allen Weinstein. Personal life and death Whittaker Chambers (c. 1948), Shemitz's husband Shemitz's older brother was attorney Reuben Shemitz. A nephew was Nathan Levine; another was Sylvan Shemitz. In 1926, Whittaker Chambers first saw Shemitz at the Passaic Textile Strike, which he described at length in his 1952 memoir. In 1930, Chambers and friend Mike Intrator began to court Shemitz and Lumpkin; both couples married in 1931. Shemitz's marriage was witnessed by Grace Hutchins and her life partner Anna Rochester. Shemitz and Chambers had a daughter in 1933 and a son in 1936. Once Chambers defected, husband and wife lived at the Pipe Creek Farm, near Westminster, Maryland, for the rest of their lives. The couple had two children, Ellen and John, during the 1930s, despite the Communist leadership expecting couples to remain childless, but many refused, a choice Chambers cited as part of his gradual disillusionment with communism.. Daughter Ellen died in 2017; her children are Stephen, Pamela, and John. Shemitz made her first and only trip abroad, to Europe, with Chambers in the summer of 1959, during which they met Arthur Koestler and Margarete Buber- Neumann among others. When Chambers died of his seventh heart attack on July 9, 1961, Shemitz collapsed and was rushed to the nearest hospital in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. On August 16, 1986, she died age 86 at her home.

The buildings are typical of those constructed by immigrant families from Luxembourg that settled in Dubuque and nearby Jackson counties. The front part of the house is the oldest structure here and was built when Martin Burkhart owned the property. He sold the farmstead to Casper Burkhart the following year, who then sold it to John and Marie Schrup in 1856. The Schrups were responsible for adding onto the back of the house about the time they bought it and the other two buildings. The dairy farm of remained in the family until 1973. Because it was always a modest enterprise, the stone buildings were not torn down and replaced with modern structures as happened on many of the Luxembourgian farms built in the mid-19th century. A wooden shed was built in the early 20th century, and is the non-contributing building. A pole barn was also added to the farmstead and it fell down c. 1995.

Founded on the early stages of the Indonesian Revolutionary War and located in the city of Magelang in Central Java, its alumni forms a professional officer cadre for the army, with all Indonesian Army Chiefs of Staff since 1988 having graduated from Akmil. History In October 1945, several months after the Indonesian declaration of independence, then-Chief of Staff of the Indonesian Armed Forces Oerip Soemohardjo ordered the establishment of a military academy, which was called the Militaire Academie and was based in Yogyakarta. On the aftermath of a ceasefire with the Dutch armed forces in 1949, interest in the school dropped with only 9 cadets in Class 3 (1949 intake) compared to 200 in Class 2 (1946 intake), and the academy was closed in 1950 with remaining students sent to the Dutch Koninklijke Militaire Academie. In the following years, several army officer schools would pop out in Indonesia. Partly in effort to transform a regional, guerilla force into a professional, national military, the then Chief of Staff of the Army Abdul Haris Nasution established the National Military Academy (Akademi Militer Nasional), which was officially opened on 11 November 1957 and included Mount Tidar in its premises within Magelang giving the academy its nickname of Lembah Tidar (Tidar Valley), modeled on the United States Military Academy. The first cadets to graduate from this new institution in 1960 was recognized as Class 4 and numbered 59 graduating officers. Soon in 1961, the Indonesian Army Military Technical Academy (ATEKAD) based in Bandung was merged with the school and the cadets transferred to Magelang. Later, it was integrated with the Indonesian Naval Academy (Akademi Angkatan Laut), Air Force Academy (Akademi Angkatan Udara) and the Police Academy (Akademi Angkatan Kepolisian) to form the Indonesia National Armed Forces Academy System (AKABRI) in 1965. In 1984, reorganization of the armed forces resulted in the academy renamed to its current form, the Military Academy Magelang (Akademi Militer). The Taruna Nusantara high school, established in 1990 by Akmil alumni Try Sutrisno and located just outside the military academy, was created in order to attract young talent to the academy. After the reformation and the removal of dwifungsi, the Police Academy was separated from AKABRI leaving Akmil, AAU, and AAL within the structure. =Recent developments= Front view of the academy in Magelang Starting in 2011, graduates of the academy were awarded a bachelor's degree (in applied defence sciences, Indonesian: Sarjana Sains Terapan Pertahanan) along with other academies in AKABRI. In 2017, the academy had its first female graduates, among a graduating class of 225 cadets. Academics Indonesian Military cadets in parade uniform during the Indonesian independence day ceremony in the Merdeka Palace in Jakarta Just like so many military academies in the world, the Indonesian Military Academy Magelang is a medium-sized, highly residential baccalaureate college, with a full-time, four-year undergraduate program that emphasizes instruction in the arts, sciences, and professions with a graduate program, preparing men and women to take on the challenge of being officers of the Indonesian Army. The academy is accredited by the Ministry of Education. Cadets who passed the initial selection process will first attend a 1-year basic program in the premises of the Academy with students from the Air Force, Naval and Police academies, and remain there for the remainder of their studies. = Undergraduate program - academic = The academic program consists of a structured core of subjects depending on the cadet's chosen specialty as a future Army officer, balanced between the arts and sciences. Regardless of major, all cadets graduate with a Bachelor of Applied Defense Science degree. = Undergraduate program - military = As all cadets are commissioned as second lieutenants upon graduation, military and leadership education is nested with academic instruction. Military training and discipline fall under the purview of the Office of the Vice Governor and Commandant of Cadets. Entering freshmen, or 4th class cadets, which come from high school graduates of private and public educational institutions, are referred to as New Cadets, and enter the academy on Reception Day (in September) to start off their military service training as future officers and are recognized as full cadets in a ceremony in January the following year alongside cadets from the other service branches and the National Police, where they receive ceremonial daggers and the senior ranked cadets receive their Cadet Corporal sleeve insignia. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th years of study, aside from the usual academic work, also involve specialty training in the combat arms of the Army in their respective combat training schools stationed nationwide. Selected cadets are also selected for foreign exchange studies in the military academies of Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, the United States, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam, among others. The Academy also has links with military academies in the Asia-Pacific, the United States Military Academy and the Royal Military College of Canada and thus also has a sizable number of foreign exchange cadets who graduate as Second Lieutenants and with a bachelor's degree and thus return to their countries of origin to serve in their ground forces. Given its Dutch traditions as a former colonial territory the academy is also linked with the Koninklijke Militaire Academie in Breda, The Netherlands. At the end of their final year, the cadets, after finishing their final exams, march out of the Academy fields in July in their graduation parade, and graduate within days in a national ceremony in Jakarta's Independence Palace, wherein the cadet valedictorian receives his/her Second Lieutenant shoulder board from the President of Indonesia, while the salutatorian recites with his/her fellow graduates the commissioned officers' oath of office.  Cadet life  Cadets are not referred to as freshmen, sophomores, juniors, or seniors. Instead they are officially called fourth class, third class, second class, and first class cadets, or generally as Taruna-Taruni Akmil (Cadets of the Academy) as a whole. As the national military college its cadets, male and female, come from all over Indonesia as well as foreign exchange cadets from many countries of the world who study in its halls. = Corps of Drums Canka Lokananta and Regimental Band of the Military Academy = The Corps of Drums \\"Canka Lokananta\\" (Drum Band Genderang Seruling \\"Canka Lokananta\\") and the Regimental Band of the Military Academy Magelang (Satuan Musik Upacara Akademi Militer) are the official military band and corps of drums, respectively, of the Indonesian Military Academy, having started in 1959 after the reopening of the Military Academy in its current Magelang campus, thus they are the senior premier musical representatives of the Indonesian Army, modeled on similar formations mounted by the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army Military School in Bandung, Gombong and Purworejo. While the Band (composed of 36 musicians) is manned by active duty military personnel assigned to the academy, the Corps of Drums of around 182 drummers, fifers and trumpeters is manned by the officer cadets that are part of the Corps of Cadets.https://magelangimages.wordpress.com/2014/04/11/canka- lokananta-the-melodious-sound-from-tidar-valley/ Both organizations fulfill all of the official musical requirements of the Academy, including military and patriotic ceremonies, public concerts, sporting events and radio and television broadcasts, as well as social activities for the Corps of Cadets, alumni of the academy and the entire community of Magelang, while appearing in all national events involving the Indonesian National Armed Forces as the seniormost field units of its military academies. While the Band is led by a Director of Music and a Bandmaster together with the Band Sergeant Major, the Corps of Drums is led by a Senior Drum Major and 4 Assistant Drum Majors (Penatarama), which lead the Corps on parades and ceremonies with their long maces to direct the drummers, fifes and trumpeters. Former President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, himself a former graduate of the Military Academy, was part of the drumline battery of the Corps of Drums, which changes every year from the incoming and outgoing musicians selected from amongst the ranks of the Corps.https://news.detik.com/berita/d-2618995/ini-gaya-sby-tampil-bersama- taruna-drum-band-akmil-magelang He was a tenor drummer during his stinct as part of this formation, and during a June 2014 visit, he was joined by fellow alumni musicians of the Corps of Drums of the 1973 graduating class.

Of the novel, Stephen King stated, \\"Owen brought me this dynamite idea and I've collaborated a couple of times with Joe. I'm not going to say what the idea is because it's too good.\\" The novel was officially announced in June 2016 and is said to take place in a women's prison in West Virginia during a strange mystical occurrence that causes all the women in the world to fall asleep. An excerpt was published on September 1, 2017 by Entertainment Weekly in their special The Ultimate Guide to Stephen King issue.\\"Sleeping Beauties: Exclusive Excerpt.\\" Entertainment Weekly, 1 Sep., 2017, pp. 18-25.  Plot  In the impoverished town of Dooling, part of the fictional Tri-Counties region of Appalachia, a bizarre murder occurs when two men running a meth lab out of their mobile home are beaten to death by a mysterious woman, who then sets fire to the lab before allowing herself to be arrested by the local sheriff, Lila Norcross. At the same time, reports start coming in of a mysterious sickness spreading across the world, which causes women to fall into a deep sleep, cocooned in a strange material. Dubbed \\"Aurora\\", the disease also causes the sleeping women to enter into a homicidal rage, attacking and brutally murdering anyone who tries to open the cocoons. Lila's husband Clint, the chief psychiatrist at the Dooling Correctional Institute for Women, begins noticing Aurora occurring among his patients at the same time that the woman, who is given the name \\"Eve Black\\", is incarcerated in the prison. As the disease continues to spread throughout the town, the local women become desperate to keep themselves awake, leading to looting and riots. Lila herself falls victim to the illness, and is replaced by her alcoholic chief deputy, Terry Coombs, who in turn appoints Frank Geary, a former animal control officer with a short temper, as his second-in-command. Clint's superior, Warden Janice Coates, fires one of her guards, Don Peters, for sexual harassment; he drugs her with Xanax, leaving Clint to protect the dwindling number of still-awake female inmates. Clint interviews Eve, learning that she is an \\"emissary\\" sent by an otherworldly being who believes that women are capable of building a society free of war, abuse, and other evils she says are caused primarily by men. Clint, according to her words, is \\"the Man\\" whose purpose is to protect Eve for \\"a week or so\\", when she promises to cure the women of Aurora. Meanwhile, Frank and Terry deputize several new recruits, including Peters and a juvenile delinquent named Eric Blass, and gradually restore order to Dooling. Rumors of Eve's ability to sleep and wake without trouble spread throughout the town, leading Frank in a quest to start manipulating Terry to take her from the prison to somehow save the sleeping women. Clint's son Jared and his friend Mary manage to hide Lila and three other women in an empty house, worrying that Frank will use their bodies as hostages. Meanwhile, in an alternate dimension, the women find themselves in a post-apocalyptic Dooling, which they refer to as \\"Our Place\\". Lila and Janice assume leadership, and the women begin to re-establish themselves, even as many mysteriously vanish (due to their bodies having been destroyed by men in the real world). A group sent to look for other survivors instead come across a magnificent Tree, which turns out to be the portal between Our Place and Dooling. Elaine Nutting, Frank's wife, tries to burn the Tree down because she doesn't want to return to the real world, but Eve sends an inmate, Jeanette Sorley, to stop her; Jeanette has a young son whom she desperately wants to see again so she agrees to stop Elaine. Jeanette finds Elaine in the process of setting fire to the Tree portal and wrestles the lighter and a gun away from her. Jeanette then throws the lighter away and picks up the gun to put it in her belt. Before she can do that leaves rustle behind her. Jeanette turns with the gun in her hand and Lila then shoots and kills Jeanette by mistake. Clint and his allies steal weapons from the police station, prompting Frank and Terry to assemble a posse to assault the prison and capture Eve. During the attack, two criminals whom Lila had arrested based on an inmate's testimony use a stolen bazooka to blow up the station and part of the prison, killing fifteen women before Vanessa Lampley, a former guard, shoots them dead. Terry commits suicide out of grief and cowardice, Peters and Blass are killed, and most of Frank's men desert him, but he manages to reach Eve's cell. Clint, Jared, Janice's daughter Michaela, an inmate named Angel Fitzroy, and an elderly volunteer, Willy Burke, try to persuade him to spare her life, even as Eve herself promises Frank that killing her is the only way to save his family. Realizing that Eve is trying to prove that men are inherently violent and should be allowed to die out, Clint uses guilt to force Eve to use her power to save Willy when his heart suddenly stops. Seeing this, Frank and the others allow Eve to return to Our Place, where she gives the women the chance to decide whether to return to Dooling or stay put. Ultimately, all of the women vote to return. As sleeping women around the world awake from their slumber, life slowly begins to return to normal. However, Lila and Clint's marriage, already on shaky ground, falls apart, and they decide to separate, with Clint resuming his old job at a prison in a neighboring town and Lila resigning as sheriff. Haunted by Jeanette's death and seeking forgiveness, Lila drives out to where the Tree used to stand and asks Eve for a sign of her presence. A single brown moth (one of Eve's forms) then lands on her hand. Characters =Main= * Lila Norcross: Clint Norcross's wife, who works as the local sheriff. She doesn't take anyone's crap and has a very dry undertone in her dialogue, heightened because of her lack of sleep; at the start of the story, she is working the night shift and had been up for over 12 hours straight. She continues to try to stay awake to help the town, but eventually succumbs to Aurora, at which point she takes leadership of the women in Our Place. * Clint Norcross: A psychiatrist for the Dooling Correctional Institute for Women. He originally planned to be a private therapist, but quit to work for the prison on the first day after a patient named Paul Montpellier spent his entire session complaining about how he got kicked out of his house after having been caught having an affair. The women at the facility seem to favor him over other therapists because he treats them like people, not problems to be solved with exercises that don't work. He really believes that his patients can get better, and thinks often that \\"in a perfect world, x patient would never have been arrested.\\" He believes most of the women to be good people, just luckless. Because of this, Eve chooses him to watch over her and prove that a man's world is worth saving. * Frank Geary: The only animal control officer in town. He has an extremely short temper, yet somehow always manages to rationalize it. For example, when he punches a hole in his wall, he thinks, \\"sometimes you punch a wall to avoid punching the person in front of you.\\" When he yells at his daughter, he thinks, \\"sometimes you've got to yell to be heard.\\" Frank believes himself to be a good person despite his many flaws, excusing his lack of self-control as \\"Bad Frank\\" and labeling himself as \\"Good Frank\\". Eve considers him to be representative of what she considers to be the worst tendencies of men. * Jeanette Sorley: An inmate imprisoned for manslaughter after she stabbed her violent husband in the crotch with a screwdriver while they were both high, and then sitting and watching while he bled to death. Clint thinks that Jeanette had acted out of self-defense, claiming that because of her husband's abuse, she would've either died or been emotionally traumatized for the rest of her life unless she killed him first. Jeanette has been on good report for a long time at the start of the story, and is currently working to get paroled so she can see her son. She is remorseful for her actions despite everything and wishes she hadn't turned out a murderer. * Eve Black: A mysterious woman who is seemingly responsible for the spread of Aurora. She demonstrates several powers, including shapeshifting and communicating telepathically with animals such as rats. She justifies her actions by claiming a mission to determine whether men can survive in a world without women. =Minor= * Jared Norcross: Lila and Clint's only son. He's a lot like his father, both in looks and personality. He is somewhat insecure and has a good heart. * Elaine Nutting: Frank's ex-wife. She's a very religious woman-in fact, they met at her church. She is currently separated from Frank on account of her inability to tolerate his short temper. * Nana Geary: Frank's daughter. She has a talent for drawing and probably a bit of trauma from her father constantly yelling at her, yet she still loves him. * Terry and Roger: Lila's deputies. They're described as being somewhat dumb and lacking initiative, with Terry in particular struggling with an alcohol problem. Lila says that Terry is the smarter of the two, but lacks the temperament to be a leader. Both men remain on duty when Frank takes over the sheriff's department and quickly fall under his sway * Janice Coates: The warden of Dooling Correctional Institute for Women. She has a no-nonsense attitude and little patience, and has a good working relationship with Clint. She has a daughter named Michaela, who works for the news and was the first to tell her mom about the Aurora virus, which allows the facility to make vital preparations. Coates falls victim to the virus and helps Lila in Our Place, which inspires her to retire and reconnect with Michaela after the virus is reversed. * Don Peters: A senior guard at the Institute who sexually abuses the inmates, and uses his position to block any complaints. When the Warden fires him, he drugs her with sleeping pills and walks off the job. He is then hired as one of Frank's deputies and dies while helping him assault the prison. * Eric Blass: A classmate of Jared's who displays sociopathic tendencies, as shown in an early scene where he and Don Peters murder a homeless woman by setting her on fire. Eric gets deputized by Frank, only to be killed during the prison raid.

Born in Cadoxton-juxta-Neath in South Wales, Jones was educated until he was sixteen, then served as a pupil-teacher for a year. Although he hoped to become a teacher, his father disapproved of this, and Jones instead completed an apprenticeship as a patternmaker with the Neath Abbey Ironworks Company. He continued to study science, maths and art at evening classes. By this time, the economy was in recession, and he struggled to find work, eventually finding a job manufacturing tin plate. When the economy picked up, he returned to the Neath Abbey Ironworks, becoming a supervisor, and also spending time as a boilermaker. In 1879, he joined the Amalgamated Society of Engineers (ASE). When the next trade depression hit, he was again out of work, and moved to Monmouthshire to find a new role. In 1881, Jones settled in Cardiff, where he continued in his trade. He became increasingly prominent in the ASE, winning election to its general council in 1891. In 1892, this was replaced by an executive council, and Jones narrowly won election as a district delegate. He was also active on the Cardiff Trades Council, and represented his union at the Trades Union Congress. Jones ran for the general secretaryship of the union in 1909, and narrowly defeated David S.

E. J. Cowdrey or John Cowdrey, was an English historian of the Middle Ages and an Anglican priest. He was elected priest of St Edmund Hall, University of Oxford, in 1956. He resigned the chaplaincy in 1976, but continued to teach medieval history there until 1994, when he retired and was elected emeritus fellow. He was also a Fellow of the British Academy. A leading expert on the Gregorian reforms, his most important work is the monograph Pope Gregory VII, 1073‚Äì1085, considered a masterpiece \\"unlikely to be surpassed\\". Life and career Born in Basingstoke on 29 November 1926, Cowdrey attended Queen Mary's School for Boys there from 1937 until 1943, when he won a scholarship to Trinity College, Oxford. At that time, he considered himself an atheist. Drafted into the service because of World War II, he chose to join the Royal Navy in 1944. He served aboard HMS Mauritius in the eastern Mediterranean from 1945 to 1947. He arrived before the war was over, but saw no action. On 22 October 1946, he was in one of the magazines during the second Corfu Channel incident, when Mauritius and her flotilla passed through an unexpected minefield off Albania. After his stint in the navy, Cowdrey visited Palestine during the last year of the British mandate. Marston. He frequently preached on Sunday mornings. After returning to Oxford in 1947, Cowdrey studied modern (post-1760) history and theology (under Austin Farrer). He first began research into the medieval papacy and Pope Gregory VII during his theological studies. He also learned biblical Hebrew and ancient Greek, in addition to the modern languages he already knew (English, French, German and Italian). In 1953, he took holy orders at St Stephen's House, Oxford, a high church seminary, where he also taught Old Testament and theology until 1956, when he took up the chaplaincy at St Edmund Hall. In 1957, St Edmund Hall received new statutes, becoming a full college, and Cowdrey was thus one of the founding fellows. In 1963, Cowdrey studied the dissemination and reception of Augustine of Hippo's theology. In 1966‚Äì1968, he published three articles on Milan in order to illuminate the background to the Patarene movement and the Gregorian reform. In 1970, he published his first book‚ÄîThe Cluniacs and the Gregorian Reform‚Äîand an article on the Peace and Truce of God, which remains \\"the most reliable and most persuasive discussion of the Peace and Truce in English\\". He argued that there was a connection between the earlier Peace and Truce movements and the later Crusades. He also published a paper that year arguing that from the start the purpose of the First Crusade was the liberation of Jerusalem. This was a refutation of the thesis of Carl Erdmann that the goal of the crusade at the start was the defence of the Byzantine Empire and the eastern church. The latter paper made Cowdrey an important crusades scholar. In the summer of 1977, he lectured in Israeli universities and visited crusader sites. Much of his later work on the Crusades was collected in The Crusades and Latin Monasticism in the Eleventh and Twelfth Centuries (1999). In 1972, he published his second book, The Epistolae Vagantes of Pope Gregory VII, an edited and translated collection of the unregistered letters of Gregory VII that Erdmann had been intending to do before his death. In 2002, he published The Register of Pope Gregory VII, 1073‚Äì1085, an English translation of Gregory's registered letters, the first since Ephraim Emerton's appeared in 1932. In 1983, The Age of Abbot Desiderius: Montecassino, the Papacy, and the Normans in the Eleventh and Early Twelfth Centuries, a preliminary to Cowdrey's projected book on Gregory VII, appeared. The projected book, Pope Gregory VII, 1073‚Äì1085, appeared in 1998 and was considered an instant masterpiece. His last book, Lanfranc: Scholar, Monk, and Archbishop, was published in 2003. It is a study of Lanfranc of Canterbury, an Italian monk from Normandy, that seeks to show that he understood England and the needs of the English church. Cowdrey married Judith Watson Davis, a musician, in 1959. They had two daughters and a son. Judith died in 2004. Late in life, Cowdrey was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.

Lingual lures are very well developed in young alligator snapping turtles which wait underwater with their mouths open. The tongue is wriggled like a worm and fishes attracted to it are captured by a rapid snapping of the mouth. Lingual luring has also been noted in some species of snakes including the garter snake Thamnophis atratus and species of Nerodia (including N. sipedon, N. clarkii and N. rhombifer) - here the luring is initiated by flicking the surface of water with their tongue to attract fish. Similar behaviour has been reported in the snowy egret (Egretta thula) which uses tongue flicking when foraging.

A revised and expanded version was published in 2009 as The Dedalus Book of the 1960s: Turn Off Your Mind. Reception According to Paul Krassner in Los Angeles Times, \\"Turn Off Your Mind offers an alternative chronicle of what went on in the '60s when, somewhere along the spectrum of expanding consciousness, many hippies collided with a fascination with black magic. But Lachman's book reads more like a list of references that could conceivably serve as an aid in preparing for a stint on 'Occult Jeopardy!'\\" Krassner found the book to focus too much on the negative sides of the 1960s counterculture. He further wrote that Lachman \\"resorts to ... mendacious generalizations\\", \\"fails to report interesting details\\", that his \\"selection of anecdotes isn't without errors\\" and that there is \\"a fixation on fascism in the book that taints Lachman's perceptions\\". Krassner wrote: \\"I suspect that, unless you are a hard-core enthusiast of occult esoterica, you will find reading this book a chore rather than a pleasure.\\" The Independent's Christopher Hirst wrote that there is \\"much in Lachman's book to entertain and inform those who wished they had lived through the Sixties and those who did but can't remember it.

He spent 28 years as the department chair and Hamilton Kuhn Professor of Biological Chemistry at Harvard University. After retiring from Harvard, Hastings moved to the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation (now the Scripps Research Institute), where he became the director of the division of biochemistry and helped to establish the institution's emerging program in basic research. In 1966, he became one of the first faculty members at the University of California, San Diego's new medical school. His research focused on the biochemical underpinnings of physiology and included characterizing acid-base homeostasis in blood and pioneering the use of radioactive tracers for studying metabolism. Hastings received a number of honors and awards for his work, including election to the National Academy of Sciences in 1937 and the President's Medal for Merit in 1948 following his wartime service on the Committee for Medical Research. Hastings died of heart failure in 1987 at age 91. Early life and education Hastings was born in Dayton, Kentucky on November 20, 1985 and raised in Indianapolis, Indiana. After his father died young of tuberculosis, Hastings intended to drop out of high school to find work, but a high school teacher arranged a biology assistantship for him that enabled him to finish his studies. After graduation, Hastings began his undergraduate work at the University of Michigan, originally intending to study chemical engineering but switching to chemistry after being recruited as a laboratory assistant by physical chemist Floyd Bartell. Hastings graduated from Michigan in 1917 but had arranged to begin his Ph.D. studies a semester in advance. The entry of the United States into World War I in 1917 disrupted his plans, but Hastings was not accepted for military service and instead began work with the Public Health Service as a \\"sanitary chemist\\" studying the physiological mechanisms of fatigue. Originally the work involved studying fatigue in human workers, but Hastings requested an opportunity to work under more controlled conditions in animal models and thus was sent to Columbia University for further study. After the end of the war, Columbia physiologist Frederic Schiller Lee asked Hastings to remain at Columbia for a Ph.D. Supervised by Ernest L. Scott, Hastings was awarded the degree in 1921. He later described the Public Health Service job as a key turning point in his developing career. After graduation, Hastings became a research assistant to Donald Van Slyke at the Rockefeller Institute (now Rockefeller University), a position described as \\"probably the best job in the country in 1921 for a fresh Ph.D.\\" His work there, in collaboration with clinical researchers, helped to establish the foundation of modern understanding of clinical chemistry. Academic career Hastings began his independent research career in 1926, when he accepted a faculty position at the University of Chicago. He continued to study electrolyte imbalances and the physiological mechanisms of acid-base homeostasis. In 1930, he served as a visiting professor at the Peking Union Medical College in China, where he worked with Otto Folin's former student Hsien Wu. Folin, at the time the Hamilton Kuhn Professor and chair of the biological chemistry department at Harvard Medical School, died in 1934, prompting Harvard president James B. Conant to offer the position to Hastings. Hastings assumed the chairmanship of the biological chemistry department at Harvard in 1935 and would remain there for the next 28 years. During his tenure, Hastings was recognized as an enthusiastic teacher of medical students and mentor to the scientists in his research group, noted later for producing an unusual number of future professors of clinical medicine. He was also an advocate for the admission of women to Harvard Medical School. In his own laboratory, he developed techniques for using radioactive tracers, specifically the short-lived isotope carbon-11, to study mammalian metabolism. From 1941 to 1946, Hastings served as a member of the Committee on Medical Research, a World War II effort to fund medical research on a large scale that later laid the groundwork for basic research funding by the National Institutes of Health. Subsequently, Hastings served on a variety of councils and advisory bodies directing federal funding of biomedical research, and was recognized at the end of his life for his key role in establishing modern government research funding mechanisms in the United States. In connection with this role, Hastings traveled to Moscow to meet with Soviet scientists and share samples of penicillin, then being actively studied by CMR-funded projects. Hastings also held a number of roles in scientific societies, serving as the president of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from 1945-6, the president of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine in 1945-7, and the vice president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1965. At age 63, Hastings arranged an early retirement from his Harvard position in order to return to research from his administration-heavy duties and moved to the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation (now Scripps Research Institute) in La Jolla, California. His role there was to expand the institution's basic research program, which at the time was limited in scope; when he arrived he received a large grant from the National Institutes of Health which helped to initiate this effort. At Scripps he continued tracer studies to explore the role of carbon dioxide in metabolism. Wanting to continue to focus on research rather than administration, he recruited Frank Huennekens to Scripps to build and develop the biochemistry department there, much as Hastings had previously done at Harvard. In 1966 Hastings became one of the first faculty members of the newly established University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, where he joined the neurosciences department and worked on curriculum development. Hastings also maintained an office and presence at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, serving as a mentor for younger biomedical scientists there. Awards and honors Hastings received a number of awards and honors throughout his career. * Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 1936 * Member of the National Academy of Sciences, 1937 * Member of the American Philosophical Society, 1941 * Medal for Merit, 1948 * American College of Physicians award, 1965 * United States Public Health Service citation, 1965 Personal life Hastings married his wife Margaret in 1918, and they had a son Alan Baird Hastings the following year.

This was the last film by composer Basil Poledouris.  Plot  Butch Cassidy receives a pardon after being incarcerated for a year under the condition that he does not commit any more crimes in Wyoming. He later joins forces with the Sundance Kid and his relative Mike Cassidy's gang as adversaries of the Pinkerton Agency. The gang becomes known as the Wild Bunch after Mike Cassidy dies. A love triangle develops between Butch, Sundance, and photographer Etta Place.  Production  Originally, The Legend of Butch & Sundance was intended as a television pilot for a series with NBC produced by Stanley Brooks and Greg Gugliotta and written by John Fasano. In an interview with True West Magazines Tim Lasuita, Fasano said \\"The initial idea for the Butch and Sundance project came from some reading that I had done a couple of years ago[...] I had read two books about Butch, one by his sister who claimed that he and Sundance had faked their deaths in Bolivia and had lived out their lives in the Pacific Northwest until the 1930s, and another that claimed that they had died in Bolivia after the shoot-out [in 1908]. I took that contradiction and thought, 'What a great film that would make.'\\" Fasano later said that the production team strove for historical accuracy. Actor David Clayton Rogers said he practiced gun handling and horseback riding for the role of Butch Cassidy.

He grew up in St. George, Utah, and gained an interest in botany and theater. While operating a drug store in Salt Lake City, he started dabbling in photography and opened a photo studio. He photographed actors and actresses at the Salt Lake Theater, including some artistic nudes. He took photos of Utah attractions, and in 1903 traveled through the Ottoman Empire to take photos for the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. In 1917 Johnson moved to San Jose, California where he continued operating a photo studio. Biography =Early life= Charles Ellis Johnson's father Joseph Ellis Johnson started practicing polygamy in the 1850s and married his third wife, Eliza Saunders, in 1856. Eliza gave birth to Charles on March 21, 1857, in St. Louis, Missouri, after which they lived in small Mormon settlements in Nebraska. Charles and his family were members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints (LDS Church). In 1860 Charles, his mother, and four of his orphaned cousins traveled across the plains to Salt Lake City. The next year Joseph and his two other wives joined them. Joseph said that he \\"did not wish for the city life\\" and purchased land near Payson and Santaquin in Utah Valley and moved there. In 1865 the Johnson family moved to St. George. Charles learned how to write and operate printing presses. He worked with botanist C. C. Parry to botanize plants in southern Utah. He also worked for botanist and archaeologist Edward Palmer by helping excavate Indian burial mounds and collecting various specimens. Charles learned how to speak some Native American languages to talk to local tribe members. He also gained an interest in theater during this time. Charles did not have a formal education. Brigham Young had a winter home in St. George, which was adjacent to the Johnson home. Growing up, Charles became acquainted with the Young family. One of Brigham's daughters, Susa Amelia Young, was a member of Charles's theatrical troupe. Susa arranged for Charles to date her half-sister, Ruth Young. Charles and Ruth were married in the St. George Temple on January 28, 1878. They would have three children, two boys and one girl. In 1882 Charles Johnson, his wife, and their child moved to a small house in central Salt Lake City. Ruth eventually left Charles, who then filed for divorce in 1887. =Career= In Salt Lake City, Johnson worked as a druggist for the ZCMI. In 1889 he partnered with Parley P. Pratt to operate the Johnson-Pratt Drug Company. Johnson made and sold various family patent medicines, including his \\"Valley Tan Remedies.\\" During the 1890s, he became involved in the American Star Bicycle craze by selling them and becoming vice president of Salt Lake's Social Wheel bicycle club. stereoviews, depicting writer Ella Wheeler Wilcox, After dabbling in photography, Johnson joined Hyrum Sainsbury to open a photographic studio. Johnson soon became the undesignated \\"official photographer\\" of the Salt Lake City Theater. He was the official Utah correspondent for the New York Dramatic Mirror. He started taking risqu√© photographs, likely because of his work with burlesque theater, and often incorporated elements of orientalism. He took glamour photographs of actresses, artistic nudes, and risqu√© stereoviews. He was the only Mormon photographer during his time who sold risqu√© photographs. In the 1890s, Johnson became the unofficial photographer for the LDS Church. He photographed the dedication of the Salt Lake Temple and LDS Church leaders. He traveled with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir to the Chicago World's Fair in 1893, and visited San Francisco in 1896. Johnson advertised his studio as an \\"Information Bureau [for] everything about Utah and the Mormons.\\" He became a \\"social Mormon\\" by maintaining the appearance of being a Mormon while eventually dissociating himself from the LDS Church. While Johnson spent most of his time in Utah, he also traveled extensively, taking photographs in New York, Paris, and London. His trademark phrase was \\"You see Johnson all over the World.\\" Lydia Mountford (center) stands in the streets of Palestine during Johnson's 1903 tour. In 1897 Johnson photographed and befriended the actress Lydia Mary Olive Von Finkelstein Mamreov Mountford at the Salt Lake Theater. Mountford returned to Utah in 1903 and hired Johnson as a photographer for her Jerusalem exhibit at the St. Louis World's Fair. They traveled through Palestine and Jerusalem in the Ottoman Empire taking pictures of the scenery. At the World Fair in 1904, Johnson and Mountford found that the exhibit's management had repudiated Mountford's contract. Johnson tried with little success to market his photos in St. Louis. After returning from his tour, Johnson formed an \\"unconventional relationship\\" with businesswoman Minnie B. Ridley and hired her to help him with his businesses in Salt Lake City. In 1917 he liquidated his assets and moved to San Jose, California to live with the Ridley family, where he operated another photographic studio.

History  Decisions of the construction of new medium wave transmitting facilities for the GDR were taken in 1950. One of them was originally planned at Nauen, but objections of the Soviet Military Administration in Germany led to the construction of Funkstelle K√∂penick. The first 250 kW transmitter produced by Funkwerk K√∂penick was installed here, and the site served as the prototype for the following medium wave transmitter installations in the GDR. Construction started on 21 May 1951, transmissions on 6 July 1952. The building for the diesel generators was only completed in October 1953.Jochinke 2002, pp. 4‚Äì8 In 1954 the site was renamed into Funkamt Berlin-K√∂penick and put under the control of the Ministry for Post and Telecommunications. The second 250 kW transmitter went into service in 1956. The first one which can be considered a prototype was replaced in 1959 by an improved version. Two smaller medium wave transmitters were also installed.Jochinke 2002, p. 12‚Äì13 In 1956, a 1 kW television transmitter was installed which was replaced in 1958 by a 10 kW transmitter. TV transmissions from K√∂penick had ceased, however, when the Berlin TV tower went into service.Jochinke 2002, pp. 11, 14‚Äì15 After 1989, the old medium wave transmitters were dismantled and three modern Telefunken transmitters installed in the antenna tuner building.Jochinke 2002, p. 15 The 1959 transmitter, shut down and replaced in 1993, was rebuilt in K√∂nigs Wusterhausen radio museum on the site of the former longwave transmission station. One of the smaller medium wave transmitters is now at Museum f√ºr Kommunikation Berlin. Other equipment has been lost.Jochinke 2002, p. 16  Aerials  The aerial for medium wave transmissions consisted of one guyed steel tube mast, which was insulated against ground, and a reflector mast of equal height 95 m east of the former.Jochinke 2002, p. 11 The latter was made unnecessary when the Geneva Frequency Plan of 1975 came into effect, was dismantled in 1984 and re-erected at Wachenbrunn transmitter site, where it remained until 19 September 2013. Hydraulic jacks could lift the masts from their base insulators to avoid damage of the latter e.g. when sonic booms from military aircraft were expected. The reflector mast also carried aerials for FM broadcasting and television.Jochinke 2002, p. 14 Two wire triangle aerials, each mounted on three guyed steel lattice masts of 50 m height, were used as reserves. The first, east of the transmitter house, was built in 1951, the second, western one only in 1963. They were dismantled in the late 1990s. A free-standing steel lattice mast supported directional antennas for the reception of signals from the Adlershof studio. Alterations of the aerials on Berlin TV tower in 1997, which took over the FM and TV transmissions, and the construction of a new transmission mast of 120 m height at Zehlendorf near Oranienburg for medium wave broadcast made the facilities in K√∂penick redundant. They were shut down in 2002, and the run-down transmission mast was demolished on 16 December 2002.  Programmes  The 250 kW transmitters were used to broadcast the programmes of Berliner Welle, Berliner Rundfunk, and Radio Berlin International. The smaller transmitters were used for Berliner Rundfunk and occasionally to jam the reception of RIAS, and for the programme of Stimme der DDR. In 1962 the programme of Berliner Welle was transmitted on 1361 kHz, and that of Berliner Rundfunk on 611 kHz. In 1976, the programme of Berliner Rundfunk was transmitted on 728 kHz with 250 kW. Later, the programme of Berliner Rundfunk was transmitted on 693 kHz, and that of Radio DDR 1 on 1359 kHz, each with 250 kW. The programme of Berliner Rundfunk was transmitted from K√∂penick in FM. From 1983, the transmitter was used for Jugendradio DT 64, first on 95.1 MHz, from 1985 on 93.1 MHz. After 1989, the programme of Jazz Radio Berlin was transmitted on 603 kHz, that of RTL Radio on 891 kHz, and until 1994 Radioropa Info on 693 kHz. The latter frequency was used for the Voice of Russia from 1996 to 2000. The FM broadcast programme of Antenne Brandenburg was transmitted on 99.7 MHz, and Fritz! on 102.6 MHz, both using a Yagi antenna on top of the tube mast, until the modernisation of the Berlin TV tower.

It is a rare ground orchid with a single hairy leaf and a single yellow flower with red striations. Description Caladenia cremna is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber. It has a single, dull green, hairy leaf, long and wide with purple blotches at the base. A single yellow flower in diameter and with fine red striations is borne on a spike tall. The petals and sepals are long. The dorsal sepal is erect, wide at the base and tapers to a thread-like end with a dark, purple-red glandular tip long. The lateral sepals are wide at the base and taper to a thread-like end with a tip like that on the dorsal sepal, although shorter. The petals are wide, slightly shorter than the sepals and lack the glandular tip. The petals and sepals spread widely apart and have drooping tips. The labellum is lance-shaped to egg-shaped, long and wide when flattened and curves downward at the tip. It is mostly yellowish with a dark reddish tip. Red teeth on the margins are about long but decreasing in size towards the front. There are four to six rows of well-spaced, foot-shaped calli along the centre of the labellum, decreasing in size towards the front. Flowering occurs in October. Taxonomy and naming This species was first formally described by David L. Jones in 2006 and given the name Arachnorchis cremna. The description was published in Australian Orchid Research, based on a specimen found near Whitfield. In 2007, Gary Backhouse changed the name to Caladenia cremna, publishing the name change in The Victorian Naturalist. Jones derived the specific epithet (cremna) from \\"the Greek cremnos, steep, in reference to the steep slope where this species occurs\\". Distribution and habitat Don‚Äôs spider orchid grows in eucalypt forest, with an understorey of heath and Rytidosperma pallidum on steep slaty hillsides. It is only known from the area where the type specimen was found. Conservation Between 18 and 35 plants have been counted in the area of occupation. The species is listed as \\"Endangered\\" under the Victorian Government Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988 and as \\"Critically Endangered\\" under the Commonwealth Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC) Act. The main threats to the species are activities associated with road use and maintenance and weed invasion.

On 5 January 1937, 10-year-old Mona Lilian Tinsley disappeared after leaving her Newark-on-Trent school. A former lodger of Mona's parents, Frederick Nodder, became the prime suspect in her abduction. However, despite the fact both strong physical and circumstantial evidence existed attesting to his guilt, because no body could be found, Nodder could not be tried for her murder, but was instead convicted of Mona's abduction and sentenced to seven years in gaol. On 6 June, Mona's strangled body was recovered from the River Idle, and Nodder was subsequently charged with her murder. He was found guilty of Mona's murder and hanged at Lincoln Prison on 30 December 1937. The murder of Mona Tinsley was a prime case study cited in English law as leading to the abolition of the no body, no murder principle. This principle was abolished in 1954. As such, a murder conviction can now be obtained based on circumstantial evidence, should this evidence be sufficiently compelling and convincing. Disappearance and investigation On the afternoon of Tuesday 5 January 1937,Murder in the 1930s p. 255 10-year-old Mona Tinsley disappeared after leaving the Guildhall Street Methodist School in Newark-on-Trent. This school was approximately 20 minutes walk from Mona's Thoresby Road home, and she would typically arrive home at approximately 3.50 p.m. When Mona had not arrived home by 5 p.m., her father began visiting her friends' houses in the hope his daughter may be at one of these premises. That evening, Wilfred and Lilian Tinsley reported their daughter missing to the police, who promised to launch an intense manhunt for the child at daybreak. The following day, an intense search was mounted. This search involved canals and rivers being dragged, extensive door-to-door enquiries, and empty properties being searched. The police search was assisted by hundreds of local volunteers. In response to extensive police and media appeals, two eyewitnesses came forward on 6 January to say they had seen the girl at a bus station in the company of a middle-aged man. One of these individuals was able to identify this man as a former lodger of the Tinsleys; the other eyewitness‚Äîa neighbour of Mona's‚Äîstated the man had been notably wary in demeanour.The Murder Guide: 100 Extraordinary, Bizarre and Gruesome Murders p. 171 A neighbour of the Tinsley family also informed the police that she had seen this former lodger of the theirs standing alone, loitering on a street corner close to Mona's school, staring in the direction of the entrance to the premises on the afternoon of her abduction.Ghosts & Gallows: True Stories of Crime and the Paranormal p. 86 Later that day, a bus conductor named Charles Reville confirmed to police that the previous day, a young girl matching Mona's description had indeed boarded his 4.45 p.m. bus from Newark to Retford in the company of a middle-aged man, and the pair had alighted his bus at Grove Street, Retford.Ghosts & Gallows: True Stories of Crime and the Paranormal p. 83 Reville ominously added that this man had purchased a return ticket for himself, but only a single half- fare ticket for the girl.Twentieth Century Murder: A Year by Year Account of the World's Most Pitiless Crimes p. 47 Reville's claims were independently substantiated by a passenger on the bus named Stanley Betts, who also claimed to have seen a middle-aged man travelling between Newark and Retford with a girl matching Mona's description.True Detective: The Monster with Staring Eyes, p. 10. Mona's parents were questioned by the police in relation to these eyewitness statements. They gave this former lodger's name as Frederick Hudson, adding that they had been introduced to Hudson by Lilian's sister, Edith Grimes, with whom Hudson had previously lodged in Sheffield.Murder in the 1930s p. 257 The Tinsleys explained that after Hudson left the Grimes household in October 1935, he had briefly lodged with them, but that they had evicted him from their home after just three weeks for non-payment of rent. Nonetheless, Wilfred and Lilian Tinsley emphasised that his departure from their household had been upon amicable terms, and also confirmed that in the short space of time Hudson had lodged in their household, he had been popular with their seven children, who had all come to know him as \\"Uncle Fred\\". Circular compiled and distributed by Newark police in their efforts to locate Mona Tinsley Police interviewed Edith Grimes, who stated the man her sister knew as Frederick Hudson was actually a 49-year-old named Frederick Nodder, who had adopted the surname Hudson as an alias, since becoming the subject of an affiliation order.Twentieth Century Murder: A Year by Year Account of the World's Most Pitiless Crimes p. 47 Grimes described Nodder as being a brutish and squalid drunkard with poor personal hygiene and few friends, who worked primarily as a motor mechanic and lorry driver in Retford. Nodder had, Grimes stated, deserted his wife many years before he had lodged with them. However, she claimed to be unaware of his current address, and to have not seen him for several months (this claim was contradicted by a neighbour of the Grimes family, who recalled seeing a lorry driver fitting Nodder's description at their home shortly after Christmas 1936).Ghosts & Gallows: True Stories of Crime and the Paranormal p. 84 Enquiries in public houses and garages in Retford quickly led officers to the Retford haulage firm with which Nodder was employed; this firm was able to provide police with Nodder's current address on Smeath Road in the Nottinghamshire village of Hayton.Ghosts & Gallows: True Stories of Crime and the Paranormal pp. 87-88 Formal questioning In the late evening of 6 January, police questioned Frederick Nodder at his rented home. Producing a photograph of Mona and asking if he knew the child, Nodder confirmed he did indeed \\"used to\\" know her, but claimed not to have seen Mona for approximately 15 months, following his eviction from the Tinsley household. Questioned as to his movements the previous day, Nodder confirmed he had indeed been in Newark on 5 January, but claimed that he had simply been looking for work. He further claimed to have returned to Retford alone on the 3.45 p.m. bus (approximately 10 minutes before Mona is believed to have been abducted). As police questioned Nodder, other officers began interviewing his neighbours. One of these neighbours claimed to police she had seen a young girl matching Mona's description at Nodder's premises earlier that day; another neighbour was able to confirm to police that at midday on 6 January, a young brunette girl wearing a blue dress had been standing in the back doorway of his house, watching Nodder digging in his garden.Murder in the 1930s p. 258Bernard Spilsbury: His Life and Cases p. 314 This combination of eyewitness testimony was enough to detain Nodder, and at 11 p.m. that evening, he was arrested on a bastardy warrant (police having learned from Edith Grimes that Nodder had been the subject of an affiliation order),Ghosts & Gallows: True Stories of Crime and the Paranormal p. 88 and both his home (known as \\"Peacehaven\\") and garden extensively searched. Every house, drain, ditch and cesspit within a three mile radius of Nodder's property was also searched,True Detective: The Monster with Staring Eyes, p. 11. and a five-mile stretch of the Chesterfield Canal was also drained.The Murder Guide: 100 Extraordinary, Bizarre and Gruesome Murders p. 172 Although the search outside the grounds of Peacehaven proved fruitless insofar as discovering Mona either alive or dead, the search of Nodder's property revealed a handkerchief later determined as having belonged to Mona near a water tank at the rear of the premises. Also discovered inside the house were scraps of paper depicting a child's drawings and writings,Murder in the 1930s p. 256 and fingerprints upon crockery in the kitchen were quickly matched to those taken from materials Mona was known to have handled at her home. Ominously, an opened packet of sweets, two soiled handkerchiefs, and a tin of Vaseline were discovered beneath a pillow in the front bedroom of these premises, indicating a likely sexual motive for the child's abduction.Ghosts & Gallows: True Stories of Crime and the Paranormal p. 91 The following morning, Nodder was placed in an identity parade, and each of the witnesses who had seen Mona on 5 and 6 January did not hesitate to pick him out as the man they had seen in her company. Confronted with both these positive identifications and the successive pieces of evidence being discovered at his home, Nodder changed his story as to his actions on 5 January. In his initial statement, given on the evening of 8 January, Nodder claimed he had encountered Mona by chance outside her school, and that upon her recognising him, Mona had cheerfully exclaimed, \\"Hullo, Uncle Fred!\\"Instruments of Murder p. 189 before asking him to take her to visit her aunt (Edith Grimes) in Sheffield in order that she could see her newborn cousin, whom she had not yet seen. Reluctantly, he had agreed to Mona's request, as he had expected to see Mrs. Grimes the following day (the pair having an agreement to meet once a week in their affair).Ghosts & Gallows: True Stories of Crime and the Paranormal pp. 85-86 He had therefore persuaded Mona to spend the evening at his home, before giving the child two shillings and placing her on a bus to Sheffield the following evening, with instructions‚Äîboth verbal and written‚Äîas to how to reach her aunt's home, and a note of explanation for her visit to Mrs. Grimes.The Murder Guide: 100 Extraordinary, Bizarre and Gruesome Murders p. 172 This arrangement would therefore ensure Nodder's home was empty when Mrs. Grimes visited him at their pre-scheduled meeting time. Nodder further stated Edith Grimes could assist police with their investigation; adding she had known his address but alleging she had withheld this information from the police. Although the extensive searches conducted in and around Newark, Sheffield and Hayton had failed to find any trace of Mona, on 10 January 1937,Instruments of Murder p. 188 Nodder was charged with Mona's abduction (the lack of a body precluding a formal charge of murder).On Trial for Murder p. 20 In response, Nodder proclaimed, \\"I didn't take her away by force!\\" Assistance of Scotland Yard Although Nodder refused to divulge the whereabouts of Mona's body, police were certain the child was dead. Following the completion of the search of Peacehaven and the vicinity of the premises, police‚Äîagain assisted by hundreds of volunteers and several search dogs‚Äîexpanded the search radius for Mona's body to the surrounding countryside. Both local and national media devoted extensive coverage pertaining to the investigation, publishing a photograph and physical description of the child and appealing for assistance from the public. After three weeks, the Chief Constable of Newark, Harry Barnes, decided to seek the assistance of Scotland Yard. On 25 January, Chief Inspector Leonard Burt and a Detective Sergeant Skardon arrived in Hayton, and the two immediately organised an extensive search of every house, drain, ditch and pond within three miles of Peacehaven. This search was at the time one of the most extensive in British police history, although it would ultimately prove fruitless. Before Chief Inspector Burt and his colleague left Hayton, they informed their counterparts of their conviction Mona's body had been thrown into the River Idle, and of their fears the child's body may have been swept into the North Sea. =Medium assistance= Just days after the disappearance of Mona Tinsley, a renowned spiritualist medium named Estelle Roberts contacted the Chief Constable of Newark, offering her assistance in locating the child upon the condition her involvement remained confidential and adding that if the chief constable accepted her services and conditions, to mail her some clothing the child had worn. With the agreement of Mona's parents, police sought Roberts' assistance. Upon handling a pink silk dress the child had worn shortly before her disappearance, Roberts immediately knew the child was dead. She later informed police Mona had been murdered, adding that she had taken to a house with a water-filled ditch on one side, and that she had spent much of her time within this household copying \\"something out of a book\\" (police had not informed Roberts of the scraps of children's drawings or writings discovered at Peacehaven). Roberts stated the child had been strangled to death in an upstairs bedroom of these premises, before her murderer had placed her body in a sack and transported her remains to a river beyond the field which existed behind this house. Roberts then informed the police, \\"You will find the child's body there\\". First trial On 9 and 10 March 1937, Nodder appeared at Birmingham Assizes. He was tried before Mr. Justice Swift, charged with Mona's abduction; the taking of the girl by fraud with the intent of depriving her father of possession of her; of detaining her by fraud; of decoying and enticing her into his possession; and of unlawfully stealing and carrying away the child and secreting her against the wishes of her father. The prosecution was conducted by Norman Birkett KC, who could only argue that Nodder had abducted the child. Nodder chose not to testify at this hearing, leaving his defence counsel, led by Maurice Healy, to reiterate Nodder's claims that Mona had spent one night at his Peacehaven home before he had given the child two shillings and both verbal and written instructions as to how to travel to her aunt's Sheffield home, and that he had not seen her since. Healy further argued that Mona may still be found alive and well, and that no-one should speculate as to her actual fate.The Murder Guide: 100 Extraordinary, Bizarre and Gruesome Murders pp. 171-172 The jury took just 16 minutes to convict Nodder of Tinsley's abduction. In his summary to the court, Justice Swift paid reference to Nodder's refusal to testify at this trial, stating: \\"Nobody knows what has become of that little girl... Whatever happened to her, how she fared, who looked after her, where she slept. There is one person in this court who knows, and he is silent... he is silent! He says nothing to you at all... He sits there and never tells you a word.\\" In passing sentence, Justice Swift added: \\"What you did with that little girl, what became of her, only you know. It may be that time will reveal the dreadful secret you carry in your breast. I cannot tell, but, I am determined that, as far as I have part or lot in that dreadful tragedy of 5 January and 6 January, I will keep you in custody.\\"Famous Trials: Sixth Series p. 86 He was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment, to be served at Lincoln Prison.Death on the Waterways p. 56The Murder Guide: 100 Extraordinary, Bizarre and Gruesome Murders p. 172 The River Idle. Mona Tinsley's body was discovered in this river on 6 June 1937 =Body discovery= On 6 June 1937, a family boating on the River Idle in Bawtry spotted an object in the water, close to the bank. Upon closer inspection, this family discovered that the object was the partially decomposed body of a child, with the head and upper torso embedded in silt and trapped in a drain below water level.Ghosts & Gallows: True Stories of Crime and the Paranormal p. 91 Her body had been weighted down with wood and metal, with only the lower trunk floating above the surface of the water. On the banks of the river was a torn and rotting sack which had evidently been used to transport the child's body.Murder in the 1930s p. 257 The following day, an underwater search unit would discover a child's coat and wellington boot.Bernard Spilsbury: His Life and Cases p. 316 The location of these discoveries was approximately eight miles from where Nodder had lived. The child's body was initially moved to a nearby inn, where the clothing present with the body was identified by Wilfred Tinsley as belonging to his daughter. A subsequent autopsy at the Retford Mortuary confirmed Mona had been strangled‚Äîmost likely with a ligature‚Äîand that she had been dead before entering the water. Due to the extensive period of time the body had been in the river, the extensive adipocere formationGhosts & Gallows: True Stories of Crime and the Paranormal p. 89 upon the corpse prevented the pathologist from being able to determine whether Mona had been sexually assaulted before her murder,Murder in the 1930s p. 257 although bite marks resultant from her strangulation were still evident upon her tongue.Bernard Spilsbury: His Life and Cases p. 317 The funeral of Mona Tinsley took place on 10 June 1937 at her local Methodist Church, where Mona had attended Sunday School. Several hundred people lined the streets as her coffin was led from the Methodist Church to Newark Cemetery, where her body was interred. On 28 June, Frederick Nodder was formally charged by a Superintendent Burkitt of having committed the murder with malice aforethought of Mona Lilian Tinsley.Ghosts & Gallows: True Stories of Crime and the Paranormal p. 92Famous Trials: Sixth Series p. 88 Second trial Five months after Nodder had been formally charged with the murder of Mona Tinsley, he appeared at Nottingham Assizes to be tried for her murder.Chronicle of 20th Century Murder p. 148 This second trial began on 22 November 1937, and again saw Norman Birkett appear on behalf of the prosecution, and Maurice Healy on behalf of the defence. Healy again argued his client had no actual motive to commit the murder and advanced the theory that Mona had been abducted by another unknown individual while travelling alone to Sheffield and that this individual had committed the murder.Famous Trials: Sixth Series p. 93 Nodder himself testified at this second trial. He reiterated his previous claims that he had not seen Mona after he had placed her on a bus at Worksop with view to her visiting her aunt in Sheffield.Bernard Spilsbury: His Life and Cases p. 315 In response to questioning from both the prosecution and defence, Nodder denied killing the child; adhering to his defence counsel's allegation that she had been murdered by an unknown individual after he had last seen her on 6 January. Among the many prosecution witnesses to testify was the bus conductor, Charles Reville, who testified that a young girl matching Mona's description had boarded his bus in the company of a man whom he positively identified as Frederick Nodder, and that Nodder had purchased a return ticket for himself, but only a single ticket for the girl. Also to testify at this second trial was Sir Bernard Spilsbury, who testified that Mona had been strangled from behind with a ligature such as a bootlace or a cord of similar diameter to a bootlaceFamous Trials: Sixth Series p. 87 which had been drawn behind her head, then tightened. Spilsbury further testified that the deep bite marks still evident upon Mona's tongue at the time of the discovery of her body indicated the child had bitten her tongue for an extended period of time as this act of strangulation had occurred.Bernard Spilsbury: His Life and Cases p. 318 This second trial lasted just two days, although the jury took just 75 minutes to find Nodder guilty. When given the opportunity to speak after hearing the jury's verdict, Nodder stood before the judge, before declaring in a low but firm tone: \\"I shall go out of this court with a clear conscience.\\" In passing the death sentence, the presiding judge, Mr. Justice Macnaghten, informed Nodder: \\"Justice has slowly, but surely, overtaken you, and it only remains for me to pronounce the sentence which the law and justice require.\\"The Murder Guide: 100 Extraordinary, Bizarre and Gruesome Murders p. 172Famous Trials: Sixth Series p. 94 Nodder smiled as he heard Mr. Justice Macnaghten pass this death sentence. =Execution= Frederick Nodder did launch an appeal against his sentence, contending that the evidence presented against him at his trial was purely circumstantial. His appeal was heard on 13 December before three judges in the Court of Appeal, but was dismissed on the same day.The Murder Guide: 100 Extraordinary, Bizarre and Gruesome Murders p. 172 He was hanged at Lincoln Prison at 8 a.m. on the morning of 30 December 1937.

It is formed by cinder cones and lava domes that lie east of Puerto Vallarta. Several other volcanic fields lie in the neighbourhood. Volcanism in the Mascota volcanic field occurs within a complicated tectonic context. The Jalisco block is bordered by two rift zones and one subduction zone. The Mascota volcanic field is the youngest occurrence of minettes identified on Earth, with the most recent dates being about 70,000 ¬± 80,000 years ago. The youngest eruption of the field may have occurred less than 5,600 years ago.  Geography and geomorphology  The Mascota volcanic field lies close to the town of Mascota, east of Puerto Vallarta. The landscape is dominated by mountains and by flat valleys that support agriculture. Dirt roads from Puerto Vallarta and a highway constructed in 1993 from Guadalajara lead into the area. The Mascota volcanic field is formed by a number of cinder cones and lava domes. The cones are vegetated, which contrast with the relatively scarce vegetation of the Cretaceous surrounding terrain. The total surface covered by lavas is about . The Rio Mascota and Rio Talpa cross the field. Aside from the town of Mascota, Talpa de Allende is another settlement in the southwestern part of the field. The field covers a total area of about . East of the Mascota volcanic field lies the wider Atenguillo graben, which has a number of volcanic fields associated with. North of Mascota the San Sebastian volcanic field is older than Mascota and may be associated with the Tepic rift.  Geology  The field lies within the Jalisco tectonic block. Two grabens cut tuffs of Cretaceous age in the area and the Mascota field has developed in these grabens, with the exception of a group of cones farther north which probably formed on a fault. This part of Mexico is in a complex tectonic regimen. Starting 14 million years ago, extension across the present-day Gulf of California commenced. Extension further occurred during the Pleistocene in the adjacent Mexican mainland in the Tepic-Zacoalco rift, which separates the Jalisco block from the Sierra Madre Occidental, and the Colima rift zone with its probable submarine extension, the Manzanillo canyon. Volcanism and earthquake activity is still ongoing in these rift zones today, forming for example Ceboruco and Volcan Colima which is Mexico's most active volcano. These two rift zones together with the Middle America Trench delimit the Jalisco block. At the same time, the Rivera Plate subducts beneath the Jalisco block, causing earthquakes such as the 1932 Mexico earthquake. Farther south, the Rivera Plate is bordered by the Cocos Plate which is also subducting beneath Mexico. The relatively oblique subduction of the Cocos Plate may be responsible for the Colima graben, while another theory postulates that the Colima graben is an extension of the East Pacific Rise. The Riviera Plate is a remnant of the Farallon Plate. = Composition = The field is known for having erupted many disparate types of rocks. Volcanic rocks which have been observed include absarokite, andesite, basaltic andesite, hornblende- lamprophyre, minette and spessartite. Basaltic andesite and minette form about 50% of all exposed rocks. Part of this diversity may reflect different classifications of the rocks rather than actual chemical differences, however. Such a variety of volcanic rocks has been found at the adjacent volcanic fields of Ayutla, Los Volcanes and Tapalpa. As a plate subducts and sinks into the mantle, it loses water to the abovelying mantle wedge. This water also transports material from the subducting slab into the mantle wedge, modifying its chemistry. The melting of this modified mantle wedge appears to be the source of Mascota magmas, albeit with some magmas being modified by interactions with the crust. Minettes of the Mascota volcanic field are the world's youngest. Potassium-argon dating has yielded ages of 70,000 ¬± 80,000 years ago for these.  Eruptive history  Little is known about the eruption ages of the Mascota field. The minettes have been dated by potassium-argon dating, with ages obtained between 1,93 million years ago and 68,000 years ago. A very low magma output of has been determined. The youngest eruption occurred at Malpais volcano. A basaltic andesite lava flow with little plant and no soil cover was formed there. The eruption may have occurred only a few thousand years ago, less than 5,600 years ago of scoria in neighbouring lakes comes from this eruption.

A street in his birthplace as well as the town's Realschule and Hauptschule are all named after him. Life =Early life= The youngest of six children, he came from a family of builders but as a gifted pupil he was allowed to visit the Gymnasium in Rastatt. From 1843 onwards he studied theology in Freiburg and Munich and on 17 August 1847 Freiburg's archbishop Hermann von Vicari ordained him to the priesthood. He became a vicar in Donaueschingen, Bonndorf and Freiburg before in December 1848 becoming a 'repetitor' in Freiburg's theological college. In 1854 he joined an episcopal ordinariate overseeing educational issues, which had become one of the Church's points of conflict with the government of the Grand Duchy of Baden in Karlsruhe. When the Grand-ducal Theological College was converted into an archepiscopal 'Konvikt', he became its director. =Apostolic administrator= Statue of K√ºbel by Joseph Franz Baumeister in Freiburg Minster. K√ºbel became Freiburg's cathedral dean and vicar general on 20 Novembner 1867 and on 22 March the following year he was consecrated an auxiliary bishop and titular bishop of Leuce by Wilhelm Emmanuel von Ketteler, bishop of Mainz. After von Vicari's death on 14 April 1868 the cathedral chapter elected K√ºbel the archdiocesan administrator. However, the church and the secular government of the Grand Duchy could not agree on a new bishop, so K√ºbel remained in post until his death, essentially continuing the church- state policies of von Vicari. =Kulturkampf= The Grand Duchy's support for the idea of a sovereign state church and the separation of church and state led to a continuing conflict with von Vicari and K√ºbel, particularly marked during Julius Jolly's time as Interior Minister from 1866 to 1876. This meant that Baden's 'Kulturkampf' was a forerunner of that in Prussia. Some key issues involved were removing elementary schools from church control, introducing compulsory state exams for theology students, registering births, marriages and deaths in church-run registry offices, making state law superior to church law (a measure completed on 1 February 1870), closing church-run societies, charities and hospitals and only allowing religious charities which were exclusively religious in their purpose.

Its ZUB balises were deployed in the ZUB 121 train protection system in the Swiss railway network, in the ZUB 122 tilting control system in the German railway network, and in the ZUB 123 train protection system in the Danish railway network. Some of these were adapted for other railway lines before the next generation ZUB 2xx family was introduced which is based on Eurobalises - the earlier ZUB balises are not compatible with those.  History  The German LZB was created in 1965 and it was deployed on high-speed lines throughout the 1970s. However, with its signal wire along the complete length of a track it was considered too expensive in order to replace the traditional PZB inductive train stops that have been put along with line-side signals. In the 1980s the manufacturers of railway signaling systems developed electronic versions that could be deployed in the same pattern as the traditional train stops. For Germany that would be the Indusi inductors on the outer side of the rail. For comparison the balises in France were already put in the middle of the track and their electronic variants (later named KER balises) were installed similarly. The Swiss SBB railways had been evaluating ZUB balises throughout the 1980s but it took to the accident at Z√ºrich Oerlikon railway station in 1992 that a final decision was made for their introduction. Siemens adapted the system to work in conjunction with the traditional Integra-Signum magnets resulting in the ZUB 121 train protection system. In Germany the ZUB balises were taken as the basis for the GNT tilting control introduced in 1992. Siemens adapted the system to work in conjunction with the traditional PZB inductors resulting in the ZUB 122 train protection system. The Danish State Railways had been evaluating a modern train protection system since 1978. It took to 1988 that they tasked Siemens to create a system for the Danish railway network. It was activated in 1992 and by 1996 the complete network had been converted to the ZUB 123 train protection system. During 1995/1996 the Eurobalise specification was completed and in 2000 the European Train Control System (ETCS) specification reached a state where it was ready for deployment. While the Eurobalises are compatible with the earlier KER balises (named after their usage in the KVB, Ebicab and RSDD train protection systems) the ZUB balises are not. With the introduction of ETCS to be in sight the further development of the ZUB 1xx family was stopped. Siemens created a new family ZUB 2xx which uses Eurobalises along with the other ZUB components (the trademark ZUB is derived from German / train influencing). By 2006 the old ZUB 1xx systems were discontinued by the manufacturer - by that time the EuroZUB system had been successfully deployed on the Swiss railway network showing a possible path to the replacement of the ZUB 1xx train protection systems. The ZUB 1xx systems are still in operation - however with the current plans for the ETCS deployment in Europe the earlier ZUB balises will be scrapped during the 2020s.  Technology  The train transmits a 100 kHz AC signal to power up the ZUB balises. The activated ZUB balises will then start to transmit a signal at 50 kHz with a digital signal modulated at a frequency of 850 kHz. The transmitted telegram structure is compatible with the LZB telegrams specification. With \\"balise\\" being a French term the German specifications have used the word \\"Gleiskoppelspule\\", literally \\"rail coupling coil\\" for their digital beacons.

Fewer than 10,000 men set off from Egypt, but, with some local assistance, they were able to penetrate 1,500 km up the Nile River to the frontiers of Ethiopia, giving Egypt an empire as large as Western Europe. The Egyptian conquest was the first time that an invasion of Sudan from the north had penetrated so far; it involved two risky and unprecedented desert crossings; it necessitated the use of explosives to clear a way up the Nile; and it was an early instance of a small force with modern training, firearms and artillery defeating numerically much larger forces in Africa. Together with the campaigns and expeditions which followed it, the conquest roughly established the post- independence borders of Sudan. The invading forces also made their headquarters at Khartoum in May 1821, from which time it soon developed into Sudan's capital city. Reasons for the conquest an 1841 portrait of Muhammad Ali Muhammad Ali, the Khedive of Egypt, wanted a large and steady supply of slaves to train into a modern army so he could deploy it in other parts of his empire to further his grand territorial ambitions. An army of Sudanese slaves would enable him to dispense with the mutinous Albanian and Turkish troops on whom he had been obliged to rely until then. After the conquest, Muhammad Ali constantly urged his commanders in Sudan to collect and send as many slaves as they could to the training camps at Aswan. Those who proved unfit for military service would be put to work in his many agricultural and industrial projects. In addition, when Muhammad Ali had exterminated the Mamluks in Egypt in 1811, a remnant of them had fled south into Sudan and established themselves at Dongola. Although they posed no immediate threat, it was not uncommon for a defeated faction in Egyptian power struggles to flee upstream, waiting for the opportunity to descend once more on Cairo when circumstances changed in their favour. In 1812 Muhammad Ali had sent an embassy to the Funj Sultanate of Sennar asking them to clear the Mamluks out of Dongola, however neither the Funj rulers nor the Hamaj Regency had the military resources to do so. Muhammad Ali also believed that Sudan contained rich seams of gold, though he never found any that were commercially viable. Invasion of Nubia The second cataract of the Nile, illustrated in 1886, after Ismail's forces made it navigable The invasion force of about 4,000 left Cairo in July 1820. It was composed of Turks, Albanians and other Turkish-speaking troops, as well as Maghrebis and bedouin tribal forces. The conscription of the Egyptian peasantry had not yet begun, so regular Egyptian forces played no part in it. Commanding the troops was Muhammad Ali's third son, the 25-year-old Ismail Kamil Pasha, who joined his army at Aswan on 20 July. Second in command was a trusted Albanian officer, Abidin Bey. Camel support was provided by Ababda tribesmen who knew the frontier regions well. The Ababda had traditionally levied a toll on all caravans of gold and slaves approaching Egypt from Sudan and in return for their support during the invasion, the Egyptian government confirmed their control of the route, allowing them to charge a 10% toll on all goods passing through their land in future. The timing of the invasion was dictated by the flooding of the Nile, as the Egyptians planned to sail supply ships up over the cataracts of the Nile, and the season where the river was high enough to allow this was limited. Ismail's forces used explosives to blow open a navigable waterway through the second cataract so his ships could pass through to the south. As the army advanced, they received the submission of the kashif of Lower Nubia, which was only nominally subject to Ottoman rule, and when they passed the second cataract, the ruler of Say likewise submitted, although he later rebelled and was killed in fighting. The people of Say were descendants of Bosniak soldiery long ago posted there, and were described as 'white as the Arabs of lower Egypt'. At Dongola some of the Mamluks submitted, and others fled upstream to take refuge with Mek Nimr of Shendi. Defeat of the Shayqiyya The main military opposition to the Egyptians came from the powerful Shayqiyya confederation, which was defeated on 4 November at the battle of Korti. At the van of the Shayqiyya forces was a young girl on a richly decorated camel, who gave the signal to attack. This may have been a tradition deriving from the legendary exploits of the seventeenth-century woman warrior Azila, famous for her martial skills and for being in the thick of every fight. The Shayqiyya fought with swords and lances, disdaining the use of firearms. The bold assault by Shayqiyya cavalry was broken up by Egyptian firearms; they retreated with the loss of some fifty Shayqiyya and 600‚Äì800 Nubian auxiliaries dead. The Egyptians could not use their artillery as it was still being transported upriver by boat. After the battle, Ismail promised his soldiers a reward of 50 piastres for each pair of enemy ears they brought him. This led to much savagery and mutilation of civilians as the Egyptian troops, after they had mutilated the Shayqiyya dead, spread out into local villages and began cutting the ears off anyone they found. Unable to control his troops, Ismail did however manage to save 600 earless women from further outrages by moving them to safety on an island in the Nile. After this defeat, the Shayqiyya withdrew to Jebel Daiqa across the Nile, which Ismail crossed by boat in pursuit. As the Shayqiyya had lost much of their cavalry, they now conscripted peasant infantry who were blessed by holy men who covered them in dust, telling them it would protect them against bullets. On 2 December the Shayqiyya again charged the Egyptian line. However, Ismail had been able to bring up his artillery, which wiped out the Shayqiyya forces. Once again, massacres followed the Egyptian victory. After this victory, Ismail Pasha pressed on southwards, sending a squadron of riverboats upstream with a protecting escort accompanied along the riverbank. They reached Berber on 5 March, which submitted without fighting. Ismail himself took the bulk of his forces on a march across the Bayuda Desert on 21 February 1821, and reached the Nile at al-Buqayr, south of Ad-Damir seven days later. After some negotiations all but a few of the remaining Mamluks submitted and were allowed to return peaceably to Egypt - the few who refused fled deeper into the country but no more is known of them. The various local rulers who had been holding out against the Egyptians all now made terms with them - the remaining Shayqiyyah, whose cavalry Ismail enlisted into his own forces, and the Ja'alin under Mek Nimr of Shendi. Submission of Sennar Provincial king of FazogliIsmail's army now crossed the White Nile into the Jezirah. Only nine small Egyptian boats had been able to pass the Third Cataract ‚Äì the remainder were trapped upstream as the annual flooding ended and the water level dropped ‚Äì so transporting men and supplies across the river took time ‚Äì from 20 May until 1 June. Horses and camels were swum across, or floated with inflated waterskins. There was no opposition from the forces of the Sultanate of Sennar, which was in a state of internal turmoil. The last Funj sultan, Badi VII, surrendered to Ismail on 12 June and the Egyptians occupied Sennar without a fight the next day. Using Sennar as a base, the Egyptians moved upstream along the Blue Nile searching for what they believed to be rich sources of gold - although they were disappointed - and captured Fazogli, marking the furthest extent of their conquests in this region, before they turned back. Late in 1821 Ismail was joined by his older brother Ibrahim Pasha at Sennar. Ibrahim had been sent by their father to speed up the conquest of Sudan and deliver larger numbers of slaves. On his way south, Ibrahim established an organised relay of ships on the Nile to transport slaves north in a more systematic fashion. Ibrahim joined Ismail on slaving expeditions before falling ill and returning to Cairo. Apparently the rumour that he had been killed in the Fazogli mountains helped trigger the rebellion which broke out in 1822. Kordofan Campaign Once the Shayqiyya had surrendered, Muhammad Ali assembled a second army of some 3‚Äì4,000 men and an artillery battery under his son in law Muhammad Bey Khusraw, the Defterdar (Finance Minister), to conquer the Sultanate of Darfur. The forces assembled at Al Dabbah where they were joined by supporting units of the Kababish tribe who escorted them southwest across the Bayuda Desert into northern Kordofan. The forces of Darfur made the mistake of not attacking them as soon as they emerged from the desert, and waited instead at Barah. There, an enormous force of more than 9,000 Darfuris was defeated by the superior firepower of the Turks, who inflicted a loss of some 1,500 men on the Darfur army. Then, as Ismail had done with the Shayqiyyah, the Defterdar Bey offered a bounty for enemy ears, sacks of which were then sent back to Cairo. Soon after, the Egyptians took and sacked the Kordofani capital Al-Ubayyid. The Sultan of Darfur sent fresh forces from the west, but they too were defeated. Egyptian rule in North Kordofan was now secure, but the Defterday Bey lacked the forces to make a direct assault either on the Nuba mountains or on Darfur itself. Muhammad Ali later sought to gain control in Darfur by backing one claimant against another in a civil war, but this initiative did not succeed either. Revolt in Shendi and Sennar By the beginning of 1822 all of riverine Sudan and Kordofan was under Egyptian control. A rudimentary military administration was established, under four governors (ma'm≈´r) - Ali-din Agha At Dongola, whose role was to protect the supply lines to Egypt and who was wise enough to impose taxes at a level low enough to avoid revolt; Mahu Bey Urfali (of Kurdish origin) at Berber, who followed his example and maintained a watch on Shendi and the other towns north of the Jazirah; Ismail himself at Sennar, and the Defterdar Bey in Kordofan. Muhammad Ali constantly admonished his son to use milder methods, to act justly, and to win the people over; at the same time however, he constantly demanded more slaves, which could not be secured without further exactions. Little time was lost in assessing the new territories for taxes, beginning with a census of slaves and flocks. Ismail's secretary Muhammad Said, assisted by Coptic official, Hannah Tawƒ´l, and the former Sennar minister the Arbab Dafa'Allah, devised a system whereby taxes were to be paid at a rate of fifteen dollars per slave, ten per cow and five per sheep or donkey. This rate of taxation was exacting in the extreme, all but amounting to confiscation. Since there was little gold coin in Sudan, the only way most people could pay these taxes was in slaves. This scheme would have centralised all slaving activities in the areas under Egyptian rule, effectively destroying the means of survival of the traders and petty rulers who were economically dependent on the established means of capturing and exchanging slaves. As a result, unrest broke out and there were sporadic attacks on Egyptian troops. To deal with the situation, Ismail was obliged to remove from Sennar and go back downstream first to Wad Madani and then, in October or November 1822, to Shendi. Ismail landed at Shendi and demanded that Mek Nimr of the Ja'alin provide him with 15,000 dollars and 6,000 slaves within three days. When Nimr protested that this was impossible, Ismail struck him across the face with his riding switch (or, according to some accounts, his long Ottoman pipe). Other Ja'ali leaders intervened to defuse the confrontation, but, unwisely, Ismail then spent the night in a house on the opposite side of the Nile to his forces. The Ja'alin pinned his forces down in a night attack on one side of the river, while the house Ismail was sleeping in was set on fire on the other. As the building burned, Ismail and his entourage were cut to pieces. As news of the revolt in Shendi spread, Egyptian garrisons in Karari, Halfaya, Khartoum, Al-Aylafun and Al-Kamlin had to be evacuated and retreated to general quarters at Wad Madani. Much of the newly conquered territories remained loyal to Egypt however - Dongola and Nubia were secure, as was Berber, held by Mahu Bey, while the Shayqiyya also remained loyal. The revolt was confined primarily to the Ja'alin under Mek Nimr and to some elements in Sennar under the Arbab Dafa'Allah and the Hamaj regent Hasan wad Rajab. Muhammad Said led a force of Shayqiyya south of Sennar and defeated Hasan and Dafa'Allah at Abu Shawka. Suppression of the Revolt Hearing of Ismail's death, the Defterdar Bey gathered his troops and marched east from Kordofan to Sennar. He learned that while Mek Nimr was blockading Mahu Bey in Berber, his sons and other rebels were gathered at Metemma. They negotiated an amnesty with him, but when a tribesman then tried to murder him, he was roused to a great fury and took bloody vengeance. He then marched north to relieve Berber, and when the Ja'alin advanced to meet him, defeated them, lifting the siege of Berber and allowing Mahu Bey to march out and meet him at Ad-Damir. The Defterdar Bey proceed to lay waste to town after town in the Jazirah, sparing nobody. He marched back and forth from one place to another for months, quelling dissent, killing rebels, and establishing a reputation for brutality which was long remembered. In all some 30,000 people were killed as he restored order. Mek Nimr, however, managed to escape. These punitive campaigns in the Jezirah marked the final establishment of Egyptian rule in central Sudan. In 1824, his work done, the Defterdar Bey was replaced by Osman Bey Jarkas al-Birinji as supreme commander in Sudan, and he returned to Cairo. Osman Bey brought with him the first contingent of soldiers captured in Sudan and trained in modern military discipline in Egypt, known as the jihadiyya, with whom he maintained strict order in the country. Osman Bey himself died in 1825. Sudanese slaves in Egypt Muhammad Ali of Egypt with his son Ibrahim Pasha and Colonel S√®ve To prepare for the training of his Sudanese slave army, Muhammad Ali sent a corps of Mamluks to Aswan where, in 1820, he had new barracks built to house them. Head of the military academy at Aswan was a French officer who had served under Napoleon, Colonel Octave-Joseph Anthelme S√®ve, who became a Muslim and is known in Egyptian history as Sulayman Pasha al-Faransawi. When they arrived in Aswan, each of the Sudanese was vaccinated and given a calico vest, then instructed in Islam. The exact numbers of Sudanese brought to Aswan and Muhammad Ali's other military training centre at Manfalut is not known, but it is certain that a great number died en route. Of those who arrived, many died of fevers, chills and the dryness of the climate. Of an estimated 30,000 Sudanese brought to Aswan in 1822 and 1823, only 3,000 survived. After 1823, Muhammad Ali's priority was to reduce the cost of garrisoning Sudan, where 10,000 Egyptian infantry and 9,000 cavalry were committed. The Egyptians made increasing use of enslaved Sudanese soldiers to maintain their rule, and relied very heavily on them. A more or less official ratio was established, requiring that Sudan provide 3,000 slaves for every 1,000 soldiers sent to subjugate it. This ratio could not be achieved however because the death rate of slaves delivered to Aswan was so high. Muhammad Ali's Turkish and Albanian troops that partook in the Sudan campaign were not used to weather conditions of the area and attained fevers and dysentery while there with tensions emerging and demands to return to Egypt. In addition the difficulties of capturing and raising an army from Sudanese male slaves during the campaign were reasons that led Muhammad Ali toward eventually recruiting local Egyptians for his armed forces. Despite the overall failure to create slave armies in Egypt at any great scale, the use of Sudanese in agriculture did become fairly common under Muhammad Ali and his successors. Agricultural slavery was virtually unknown in Egypt at this time, but the rapid expansion of extensive farming under Muhammad Ali and later, the world surge in the price of cotton caused by the American Civil War, were factors creating conditions favourable to the deployment of unfree labour. The slaves worked primarily on estates owned by Muhammad Ali and members of his family, and it was estimated in 1869, that Khedive Isma'il and his family had 2,000 to 3,000 slaves on their main estates as well as hundreds more in their sugar plantations in Upper Egypt. Consolidation A number of territories in modern Sudan and South Sudan were not conquered in the conquest of 1822‚Äì24, but were added following campaigns in later years. These included the Kassala region in 1840, the Upper White Nile region around Fashoda in 1855, Suakin and the Red Sea coast in 1865, Equatoria in 1870, and Darfur in 1874.

Having started in 2011 under the title Little League, the webcomic presents the members of the Justice League as 8-year-old children. Stewart has used JL8 to raise funds for charities, and the webcomic has been positively received by critics. Overview The webcomic JL8 features the various major characters of DC Comics' Justice League, reimagined as 8-year- old children. The art style has been compared to that of a 1980s Saturday- morning cartoon and the designs of Art Adams' X-Babies. The characters do not act much like their counterparts from The New 52, and the webcomic has been characterized as \\"fanfiction\\". Michael May of Comic Book Resources stated that the webcomic is akin to Tiny Titans, but while Titans emulates the gag-focused format of Archie and Harvey Comics, JL8 has more in common with newspaper strips: each comic has a joke, but also contributes to a story arc. The story arcs in JL8 revolve around Bruce Wayne (Batman), Clark Kent (Superman), Princess Diana (Wonder Woman), Barry Allen (The Flash), Karen Starr (Power Girl), J'onn J'onzz (Martian Manhunter), and Hal Jordan (The Green Lantern), all in elementary school. The characters are presented as a group of friends, and the webcomic is \\"for all ages.\\" Development Yale Stewart started the webcomic Little League in November 2011. In the second half of 2012, Stewart renamed Little League to its current title, JL8, and moved the webcomic to a different URL. During this period, Stewart also included a cameo of author Neil Gaiman in his webcomic. After Typhoon Haiyan made land in the Philippines in 2013, Stewart was among a few webcomic creators to fund money for those displaced by the disaster, as a large portion of his fanbase lives in the country. Stewart sells original artwork and prints of his webcomic despite a possible violation of DC Comics' copyright and trademarks, as the company has turned a blind eye to him for a long time. Capstone Publishers even hired Stewart to create official Superman children's books. Reception IGN named JL8 its best webcomic of 2012, Paste Magazine listed it among its top webcomics of 2014, and PC Magazine listed it among its top webcomics of 2015.

It blooms between September and December producing pink-purple to white-cream flowers. A widespread and variable species, it is difficult to distinguish from K. praestans and from K. micromera where their range overlap. Description Kunzea micrantha is an erect shrub which typically grows to a height of , usually with many mains stems with a moderate number of thin, wiry side branches. The leaves are linear to lance-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, about long and wide with a petiole less than long. The flowers are arranged in heads of mostly twenty to forty on the ends of long stems. The flowers are surrounded by bracts which are long and about wide, mostly glabrous except for a few hairs around the edges and by pairs of smaller bracteoles. The floral cup is long and the five sepals are lance-shaped to triangular, glabrous and about long. The five petals are pink-purple to white-cream, lance-shaped to spatula- shaped with the narrower end towards the base and long and wide. There are 12 to 40 stamens long in several rows in each flower. Flowering occurs mainly between September and December and is followed by fruit which are urn-shaped capsules with the sepals remaining. This kunzea is similar to K. affinis but is distinguished mainly by the mostly glabrous leaves and bracts. It is similar to Kunzea micromera and K. praestans, sometimes forming hybrids with those species and is difficult to distinguish from them where the ranges overlap. Taxonomy and naming Kunzea micrantha was first formally described in 1844 by the botanist Johannes Conrad Schauer in Johann Georg Christian Lehmann's work Plantae Preissianae. There are four subspecies of this kunzea: * Kunzea micrantha subsp. micrantha which grows in a few swamps on the Swan Coastal Plain from near Perth to near Busselton with scattered populations near Augusta; * Kunzea micrantha subsp. petiolata which grows in temporary swamps on the coastal plain from near the Swan River to near Jurien Bay; * Kunzea micrantha subsp. oligandra which is mostly found inland from near Manjimup to Porongorup and also near Bremer Bay, growing in temporary marshes; * Kunzea micrantha subsp. hirtiflora which is only known from two locations near Lake Muir where it grows in temporary marshes. The specific epithet (micrantha) is derived from the Ancient Greek words mikros meaning \\"small\\" and anthos meaning \\"flower\\". Distribution and habitat Often found in wet depressions and marshes in coastal areas in the Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest, Mallee, Swan Coastal Plain and Warren biogeographic regions, Kunzea micrantha grows in sandy, clay and loamy soils. Conservation Kunzea micrantha is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife but subspecies hirtiflora is listed as \\"Priority Three\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat.

The club was set up in 2002 for members of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, with the intent to allow serving police officers to play Gaelic games following the abolition of Rule 21, which had prohibited them from doing so. They are based at Newforge Lane in Belfast alongside other teams affiliated with the RUC Athletic Association. They are affiliated with Antrim GAA and play in their Inter-Firms League. On 18 October 2019 they capped off their most successful year with a win of the Tom langan trophy for the first time in their history.  History  Prior to 2001, the Gaelic Athletic Association had rule 21 in its statutes, stating that members of the British security services or police forces were not permitted to be members of the GAA. This precluded police officers from the Royal Ulster Constabulary from being able to play Gaelic games. In 2001, the ban was lifted, despite five of the county boards of the six counties of Northern Ireland voting against lifting it; Down GAA voted in favour. The Royal Ulster Constabulary reconstituted itself as the PSNI and in 2002, set up its own GAA team which they were able to do following the abolition of rule 21. On 30 October 2002, PSNI played their first Gaelic football match against Garda GAA in Dublin, Republic of Ireland. The match was played in secret with the players' names not being revealed despite the Chief Constable of Northern Ireland attending. This would become a regular fixture with the two police forces playing for the McCarthy Cup, named after Thomas St George McCarthy who was a Royal Irish Constabulary policeman and founder of the GAA. In 2006, PSNI GAA set up a hurling team. In 2007, the PSNI joined the Antrim Inter-Firms League despite warnings that PSNI players at other clubs wanted to remain discreet about their careers after playing for PSNI in challenge games. For security purposes, PSNI players' names are not disclosed when they play. In 2011, the PSNI played Garda at the headquarters of the GAA, Croke Park. PSNI have also played in the Police Gaelic Football Tournament against teams from the New York Police Department and the Metropolitan Police.

She first appeared in John Lafia's Child's Play 2 (1990) and has a cameo appearance in Don Mancini's Cult of Chucky (2017). Kyle is a main character in the Child's Play novels and comic book adaptions. Appearances =In film= Kyle first appears in Child's Play 2 (1990). She is first seen smoking a cigarette in her bedroom when Andy Barclay is looking around his new house. Her foster mother, Joanne Simpson, enters her room telling her to put it out, to put her luggage away, and also tells her that she needs to have dinner with the family instead of going to work. Kyle tells her that she will be on her own next year and that she needs the money. In the morning, one of Joanne's antiques is found shattered, and both her and Andy are sent to do the laundry. Kyle is told that she is grounded and cannot go out on a date that night. Kyle sneaks out that night and when she returns home by climbing through Andy's bedroom window, she finds him tied to the bed with a Good Guy doll next to him. When she goes to untie him, Joanne and Phil enter the room and believe that she is in the process of tying him up. Phil is later murdered by Chucky, and Andy is sent back to the orphanage. Kyle throws Chucky in the garbage and goes outside on the swing set to smoke. While swinging, she feels something under the dirt and digs it up. She discovers a damaged Good Guy doll, named Tommy. She then goes to look in the garbage can and realizes that Chucky is gone. Now knowing that Chucky is alive, she goes to warn Joanne but finds her corpse tied to a chair. Chucky then attacks Kyle and forces her to drive him to the orphanage. At the orphanage, Chucky escapes with Andy. Kyle follows them to the Play Pals factory. She subdues Chucky, and flees with Andy. After successfully evading Chucky, Andy and Kyle come face to face with him and force an air tube into his mouth, causing him to explode. The two then leave the factory. Kyle makes a returning cameo appearance in the 2017 film Cult of Chucky, with Christine Elise reprising her role. In the post-credits scene, Kyle arrives at Andy's house to torture his decapitated Chucky head. Chucky instantly recognizes and is shocked at Kyle‚Äôs arrival, at which point she tells Chucky, pliers in hand, \\"Andy sent me. We're gonna have some fun.\\" =In literature= Kyle appears in the novelization of Child's Play 2. In 1992, Kyle appeared in the three-issue comic book adaptation of Child's Play 2 released by Innovation Publishing. Development Christine Elise's performance as Kyle received positive reviews. =Conception= In Cinefantastique, Frederick S. Clarke described Kyle as a \\"street-smart teenager\\". In The Film Journal, Kyle is referred to as a \\"rebellious teenager\\". Christine Elise was cast in the role and in a retrospective interview she described her experience on set saying: :\\"It was my first big job & I was insanely excited. I would hang around on set on my days off & after I was wrapped. I just loved every second of it. The hard part was that Alex was a minor and child labour laws applied to him so they had to shoot him first in every scene to get him out in time. Chucky took 7 or 9 puppeteers to work & they all were union guys so ‚Äì Chucky was expensive to have on set ‚Äì so they would shoot him after Alex & send those guys home. The result was ‚Äì if you don't see those guys actually in frame with me ‚Äì it means they probably were not there. I did a lot of acting looking at coloured pieces of tape in the spots where Alex or Chucky were supposed to be. It was challenging and, of course, I felt ridiculous doing it but I still loved every second.\\" Reception In Hearths of Darkness: The Family in the American Horror Film, Updated Edition, Tony Williams stated, \\"She teaches Andy about the hostile world, warning him of future peer group school treatment as the 'new kid on the block'. Lacking the family that abandoned her at the age of three, Kyle resourcefully decides to survive within successive foster families until she can gain independence. She tells Andy what to expect.\\" Michele Eggen praised the character saying: :\\"She is fond of wearing cool leather hats and sneaking out of the house at night, so we know that she's a bit of a rebel‚Äìor at least wants others to think she is. But Kyle's personality contradicts the image she projects. As a girl who grew up in foster care, one would expect her to have a lot of attitude and anger about her situation but she doesn't. She's not antagonistic toward her foster parents‚Äìshe smartly recognizes that they are good people. She also becomes a sort of mentor to Andy, a child new to the foster system, by comforting him and giving him advice. Kyle is helpful around the house, she plays with her foster brother, and is a responsible almost- adult who knows how to take care of herself. Basically, she's a good person.\\" In a review, Tim Brayton described the character as a \\"textbook Final Girl\\" and said that she contributed to making the film transition into \\"slasher territory\\" saying: \\"Child's Play 2 solidifies its transition into slasher territory by anointing Kyle as a textbook Final Girl (too textbook, even: the Final Girl tradition of androgynous names does not usually require giving the girl an name that would only ever in any situation be given to a boy), of the sub-breed that must also protect a child in addition to herself.\\" David Nusair praised Elise's performance. Dustin Putman praised Elise's and Alex Vincent's performances stating that they are \\"possibly the best thing about the film\\".

It was the IRA's second major attack in London in February 1991 after the Downing Street mortar attack eleven days earlier which was an attempt to assassinate the British War cabinet and the British prime minister John Major. It was also the first IRA attack against a civilian target in England since the 1983 Harrods bombing, marking a strategic change in their bombing campaign in England.https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/19/world/2-rail- terminals-in-central-london-hit-by-ira-bombs.html Background The IRA had stepped up their campaign against British military, economic and transport targets outside of Northern Ireland in the late 1980s. In May 1988 they killed three members of the RAF in attacks in the Netherlands. On 13 July 1988, nine British soldiers were injured when the IRA detonated two bombs at a British military barracks in Duisburg, West Germany. On 1 August 1988 the first IRA bomb in England in four years was set off by a timer device at the British Army base at the Inglis Barracks in Mill Hill, North London. The two-storey building containing the single men's quarters was completely destroyed. One soldier, Lance Corporal Michael Robbins, was killed, and nine others were injured. In September 1989 eleven Royal Marines were killed and 22 others injured when the IRA bombed their barracks in Deal, Kent, England. On 18 November 1989 two British soldiers were wounded when an IRA car bomb exploded at a British Army barracks in Colchester, England. On 20 February 1990 the IRA bombed a British military recruitment office in Leicester, England, where two people were injured in the attack. Five days later on 25 February 1990, another recruitment office was bombed, this time in Halifax, West Yorkshire. Less than three weeks before the Lichfield attack on 16 May 1990 the IRA detonated another bomb under a military minibus in London, killing Sergeant Charles Chapman, and injuring four other soldiers. After this attack the IRA released a statement which read \\"While the British government persists in its continued occupation of the north of Ireland the IRA will persist in attacking the British government and its forces in England.\\" On 30 July 1990 the IRA detonated a large bomb at the London Stock Exchange causing massive damage but no injuries. Ten days later they killed Conservative MP Ian Gow. =Previous republican bombings= On 26 February 1884, at Victoria station, an explosion occurred in the cloakroom of the Brighton side injuring seven staff members, as part of the Fenian dynamite campaign. On 8 September 1973, an IRA bomb exploded at the ticket office in Victoria station, injuring five people. The bombings The Paddington bomb went off at 4:20am, it was much smaller than the second bomb at Victoria and was designed to make sure the security services would take the Victoria bomb seriously and not as a hoax. There were no deaths or injuries at Paddington but the roof was badly damaged. Some time before 7:00 am, a caller with an Irish accent said: \\"We are the Irish Republican Army. Bombs to go off in all mainline stations in 45 minutes.\\"https://www.upi.com/Archives/1991/02/18/One-killed-40-wounded-in- suspected-IRA-attack/9583666853200/ The Victoria station bomb, which was hidden in a rubbish bin inside the station, went off at 7:40 am. Despite a 45-minute warning and the Paddington bomb three hours before, the security services were slow to act. The bomb killed one person instantly and injured 38 others from flying glass and other debris. This was the worst attack suffered by civilians in England by the IRA since the 1983 Harrods bombing which killed three policemen, three civilians and injured 50 people. All London's rail terminals were closed, disrupting the journeys of almost half a million commuters and bringing chaos to London, which was the IRA's intended goal. There was also a hoax call made to Heathrow, causing the airport's closure.https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1991/feb/19/northernireland.duncancampbell That night the IRA claimed responsibility for the bombings but blamed the British police for the casualties. A statement from the IRA GHQ said: \\"The cynical decision of senior security personnel not to evacuate railway stations named in secondary warnings, even three hours after the warning device had exploded at Paddington in the early hours of this morning was directly responsible for the casualties at Victoria.\\" The statement went on, \\"All future warnings should be acted upon.\\"http://journaltimes.com/news/national/ira-bombs-kill-one-disrupt- london/article_220286f8-0220-5cfe-bd90-8ea74884fbf1.html The main purpose of the bombings in the overall IRA strategy was to keep pressure up on John Major, his Government and to make sure he acted on the Irish Troubles. Police defended the decision not to close all stations after receiving warning that bombs had been planted. Commander George Churchill-Coleman, head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist squad, said that dozens of hoax calls were received every day. \\"It is very easy with hindsight to be critical.\\" Churchill-Coleman also said that the bomb was \\"quite deliberately intended to maim and kill.\\"https://www.deseretnews.com/article/147693/BLAST-AT-LONDONS-VICTORIA- STATION-KILLS-1-INJURES-37.html A year later, a French TV crew interviewed an IRA Commander who said he spoke on behalf of the IRA's GHQ Staff, several other IRA volunteers were interviewed as part of an Active Service Unit (ASU) (armed with AR-15's, heavy machine guns, a revolver and an RPG-7). The commander of the unit said about the Victoria station bombing that warnings were given by telephone naming nine railway stations in London and that a 50-minute warning was given. He went on to say that the attack was not aimed at hurting anybody but to disrupt the British transport system. Aftermath The Home Secretary, Kenneth Baker, visited Victoria station after the bomb and said \\"The concourse of Victoria is covered in blood. This is the act of murderous criminals.\\" The Queen, and other officials, also sent their condolences to the victims. This bombing would mark the IRA's shift to targeting civilian areas following the July 1990 London Stock Exchange bombing - something they had not done since the 1983 Harrods bombing. It was also the first IRA attack on the London transport system since 1976. The IRA kept bombing targets in England for the remainder of the year - dozens of bombs went off in the run up to Christmas 1991. A number of incendiary devices ignited at The Discount Furniture Store, Habitat, The World of Leather, The Reject Shop and Tottenham Court Road causing damage to property but no injuries on 1 December 1991. An incendiary device ignited at Littlewoods, Oxford Street, London W1 on 2 December. There were further attacks throughout the month but no injuries. Almost a year later, in February 1992 a bomb exploded at London Bridge station, injuring 30 people. In April 1992 a large bomb went off at the bombing of the Baltic Exchange, killing three people and causing ¬£800 million worth of damage, ¬£200 million more than the total damaged caused by the 10,000 explosions that had occurred during the Troubles in Northern Ireland up to that point. A bomb went off in Manchester city centre in December 1992, injuring over 60 people.

It was introduced to the Russian Emperor, Alexander II, in January 1881. Even though the reform contained the word \\"constitution\\", the project suggested only timid steps towards a constitutional monarchy. The main idea was to make people cooperate with the government. For this, Loris-Melikov suggested that they allow a few representatives of the commons to be presented in the legislative institutions with the granted advisory rights. The right of legislative initiative was supposed to be retained by the monarch. Despite the fact that the project was later known as a \\"constitutional reform\\", in reality, it contained nothing that could justify this label. When it was presented to the emperor, the author emphasized that his proposal had nothing in common with the \\"western constitutional formats\\". The project was presented to Alexander II on 28 January 1881, and was unanimously approved on the 16th of February by the Exclusive consultation (Alexander II also participated). On 1 March 1881, the emperor told Loris-Melikov that the project would be discussed in 4 days by the Council of Ministers. Two hours later, Alexander II was assassinated. The new emperor, Alexander III, by the advice of Konstantin Pobedonostsev, immediately dismissed Loris-Melikov and his project and started the implementation of conservative counter-reforms. On the top of the project (preserved in the State Archive of the Russian Federation) he put down: In 1904, the project of the constitution, including the private Loris-Melikov's correspondence, was published in Berlin by Maksim Kovalevsky. It was Kovalevsky's opinion that the project was just a humble attempt to reconcile the cultural classes with bureaucracy and absolutism. Kovlevsky felt that the failure of the reforms made the future of the peaceful development of the Russian people and the finalization of the Great reforms impossible. In May 1882, the new minister of the internal affairs, Nikolay Pavlovich Ignatyev, raised the agenda about a representative assembly again, this time in the form of a reanimated Zemsky Sobor. The project was prepared by Pavel Golohvastov with the help of Ivan Aksakov, and it was clearly influenced by Slavophilia ideas. However, the story was repeated and the project was not approved by Pobedonostsev. The author lost his office. Two years later, Pobedonostsev wrote to the emperor: References 1881 in the Russian Empire ","title":"Loris-Melikov's constitutional reform"},{"id":"52790706","text":"Ottogerd Ludwig Wilhelm M√ºhlmann (12 February 1908, Schmargendorf - 26 May 1987, Nuremberg) was a German academic, art historian, notable for his work in historical preservation.

He worked as a metallurgist before entering politics. Early life Lambert was born in Malmsbury, Victoria, to Sarah Ann (n√©e Smith) and William Richard Lambert. He trained in metallurgy at the school of mines in Kyneton, and in 1896 moved to Western Australia, where he set up as a metallurgical assayer in Boulder.George James Lambert ‚Äì Biographical Register of Members of the Parliament of Western Australia.

He served for periods on the Boulder and Kalgoorlie Municipal Councils, and was also a president of the Goldfields Football League.\\"THE NEW MEMBER\\", Kalgoorlie Miner, 15 August 1916. Politics and later life Lambert entered parliament at the 1916 Coolgardie by-election, caused by the death of Charles McDowall. He retained Coolgardie with comfortable majorities until it was abolished in a redistribution prior to the 1930 state election. Most of the seat was incorporated into the new seat of Yilgarn-Coolgardie, along with the majority of the seat of Yilgarn. Because both Coolgardie and Yilgarn were Labor safe seats, the party decided to forgo a preselection contest for the new seat and instead endorse multiple candidates. At the election, Edwin Corboy, the member for Yilgarn, outpolled Lambert by just four votes. Lambert subsequently lodged a petition alleging voting irregularities,\\"Yilgarn-Coolgardie Election\\", Westralian Worker, 16 May 1930. but the Court of Disputed Returns ruled in Corboy's favour.\\"MR. CORBOY ELECTED\\", The Daily News, 10 July 1930. After leaving parliament, Lambert worked for three years as the personal secretary of Philip Collier, the premier. He recontested Labor preselection in Yilgarn-Coolgardie prior to the 1933 state election, and defeated Corboy with a large majority.\\"YILGARN- COOLGARDIE SELECTION BALLOT\\", Westralian Worker, 29 July 1932. Lambert recorded an easy victory at the general election. However, his majority was narrowed to 178 votes at the 1936 election, and at the 1939 election he had to rely on preferences for the first time in his career. Lambert died in Perth in July 1941, aged 62, after a brief illness. He had married Elizabeth Everett Fleming in 1920, with whom he had two children.

In addition to Fuqua, Bruckheimer, Beall, and Jonathan Littman will serve as executive producers for the series, which is set 15 years after the original film. On February 19, 2016, it was announced that Danny Cannon would direct the pilot instead of Fuqua. = Casting = On February 26, 2016, it was announced that Bill Paxton had joined the production as Frank Rourke, an older, veteran police officer similar to Denzel Washington's character Alonzo Harris in the original movie. Several additional cast members were announced in March 2016. Katrina Law plays Detective Rebecca Lee, an officer with the LAPD's Special Investigation Section (S.I.S.), a unit that goes after the worst of the worst. Drew Van Acker is Tommy Campbell, another S.I.S. officer who is a former pro surfer. Lex Scott Davis is Alyse Arrendondo, a history teacher who is Kyle Craig's wife.

Reception  =Critical response= Training Day received generally negative reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the season has a rating of 24% based on 33 reviews, with an average rating of 4.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Training Day falls short of recapturing the excellence of the film in its television incarnation -- and fails to distinguish itself from the current squad of tired police procedurals.\\" On Metacritic, the season has a score of 38 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". =Ratings=  References   External links  CBS original programming 2010s American crime drama television series 2010s American police procedural television series 2017 American television series debuts 2017 American television series endings American action television series English-language television shows Fictional portrayals of the Los Angeles Police Department Live action television shows based on films Television series by Warner Bros.

History  In 1558 the University of Jena was founded, soon to become one of the most famous places of study in Germany. Students from across Europe came to Jena to attend the university. Upon graduation, alumni were aware of seven curiosities specific to the city of Jena and its immediate vicinity. This list of curiosities was secret and meant to be taken as evidence of a person's actual presence in Jena. A contemporary author writing in Latin verse lists the seven wonders as: \\"Ara, caput, draco, mons, pons, vulpecula turris, Weigeliana domus, septem miracula Jenae.\\" Ludwig Bechstein: Deutsches Sagenbuch, 1853, pp. 505. The uninitiated could not guess the meaning of this saying. By this unusual means, the university sought to protect itself against imposters and fraudsters who might damage the reputation of the university. Five of the \\"seven wonders\\" described below still exist today.  Ara - the passage under the altar of the city church  The passageway under the chancel of the city church of St. Michael. One of the seven wonders is Ara, a vaulted passage under the altar of the parish church, which offered the only access to the Cistercian monastery located behind this church at the time of its founding in 1301. The passage has a height of 3.5 meters and a width of 3 meters. This architectural curiosity in church building is very rare.  Caput - the Schnapphans figure at the town hall  \\"Schnapphans\\" figure on the city hall tower Schnapphans is a figure of a head on the tower of town hall, which \\"snaps\\" on the hour after a golden ball on a bar that a pilgrim keeps standing on a pedestal to the left of the clock. The ball represents a kl√∂√üe (a type of dumpling characteristic of Thuringia). Legend has it that Jena will fall when Hans is able to grab it. To the right of the clock is an angel holding a bell in his hands in front of his body. This figure moves to a quarter-hour strike. The original Schnapphans can be seen today in the Stadtmuseum; the town hall clock now features a copy. From Schnapphans am Rathaus is to see only the very lean (hungry) head. Caput is the Latin word for the head.  Draco - the seven-headed dragon  Draco, the seven-headed dragon A sculpture of a dragon (German Drache, Latin Draco) with seven heads, four legs, two arms and four tails was likely made for fun by students in Jena during the early 17th century. It is made from animal bones, wire and paper mache. Draco can presently be seen in the city museum in Jena.  Mons - the Jenzig mountain  The mountain (German Berg, Latin Mons) refers to the most impressive mountain in the vicinity of Jena, the Jenzig, a limestone mountain with a prominent bald spot, the so-called Jenzignase (\\"Jenzig nose\\").  Pons - the old Camsdorf Bridge  The old Camsdorf Bridge (lat. Pons) was a stone arch bridge with 9 arches built around 1480 and rebuilt in 1912. At the time of its construction, the rebuilt bridge was one of the largest bridges in Germany and even featured a chapel. The newly rebuilt bridge was blown up by German soldiers in 1945, an act which was pointless as the Americans had already crossed the Saale in another place. In 1946, during the time of the Soviet occupation zone, the bridge was rebuilt with the help of the Soviet occupiers and therefore bore the name \\"Bridge of German-Soviet Friendship\\". It was the first structure in Jena which to be rebuilt after the war. The new Camsdorf bridge had to be renovated in 2005. Some Jena citizens have drafted plans to erect a small chapel on the bridge, featuring an angel designed by a Munich artist based on the coat of arms of Jena. However, there is only one photo of this striking work of art.  Vulpecula Turris - The Fox Tower  The Fox Tower (German Fuchsturm, Latin Vulpecula Turris) is an old castle keep on the mountain, which formerly belonged to the castle Kirchberg.  Weigeliana Domus - the Weigel House  The Weigel House in a schematic diagram by Benedictus Georgi (1669) The final wonder of Jena was the Weigel House (German Weigelsche Haus, Latin Weigeliana Domus), demolished in 1898 in order to widen a road. The house stood beside the city church and owed its fame to its owner, the mathematics professor Erhard Weigel, in the 17th century. Weigel had installed many technical innovations throughout the house, including a wine pipe from the cellar, a lift based on the principle of the pulley, and long tubes through the house, protruding through the roof and permitting stargazing even during the day. At the time, the Weigel House was a well-known sight far beyond the city limits.

She was awarded the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize 2017 of the German Research Foundation.  Biography  Beatrice Gr√ºndler studied Arabic language and literature, Semitic Studies, and Assyriology at University of Strasbourg, France, University of T√ºbingen, Germany, und Harvard University, U.S.A, where she completed her doctorate in 1995 in Near Eastern Languages and Civilisations. After a visiting professorship at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, she taught from 1996 at Yale University, first as assistant professor and, since 2002, as full professor for Arabic literature. In the academic year 2010-2011 Gr√ºndler was Fellow at the Berlin Institute for Advanced Study with the project The Islamic Age of Communication In 2014 she returned to Germany permanently, where she teaches and conducts research at Free University of Berlin. Gr√ºndler is Principal Investigator of the Friedrich Schlegel Graduate School of Literary Studies and the Berlin Graduate School Muslim Cultures and Societies. There she leads together with Dimitri Gutas, Professor of Graeco-Arabic Studies at Yale University and Einstein Visiting Fellow, the project Aristotle's Poetics in the West (of India) from Antiquity to the Renaissance. A Multilingual Edition with Studies of the Cultural Contexts of the Syriac, Arabic, Hebrew, and Latin Translations funded by the Einstein Foundation. Gr√ºndler is member of the Board of Directors of the Dahlem Humanities Center at Freie Universit√§t Berlin. Since 2016 she is President of the American Oriental Society.  Research  Gr√ºndler‚Äôs areas of research include classical Arabic literature and its social context, the integration of literary theory into the study of Near Eastern literatures, the history of the Arabic languages, Arabic paleography, the history of the Arabic book, and the connection between Arabic and other premodern literatures. Gr√ºndler understands Arabic as a cosmopolitan language: > In premodern times (i.e. from the seventh to the nineteenth century) Arabic > was a learned language, and it served as a medium for many writers of other > mother tongues, such as Iranians, Jews, Byzantine Greeks, Visigoths, and > others. Arabic assembled the voices of individuals of various ethnic and > religious backgrounds. All of these formed part of the Arabic-Islamic > commonwealth. The German Research Foundation motivated the awarding of the Leibniz-Prize 2017 (the most important prize supporting research in Germany) to Gr√ºndler as follows: > Beatrice Gr√ºndler receives the Leibniz-Prize for her studies of the > polyphonic nature of Arabic poetry and culture. Early in her career she > devoted herself to the medium of script, recognizing its fundamental > importance for the Arabic tradition, notably with her book The Development > of the Arabic Script (1993). Based on her research, she finally developed a > complex history of the media of the Arab world, beginning with the > introduction of paper and extending to book printing and beyond. Gr√ºndler > speaks in this context of an \\"Arabic book revolution.\\" With her pilot > project of a critical digital and commented edition of Kalila wa-Dimna, > begun in 2015, Gr√ºndler is making accessible the genesis, textual history, > and reception of one of the earliest Arabic prose texts and a central work > of Arabic wisdom literature. In her work, Gr√ºndler practices herself in a > model way the encounter of the Arabic and European traditions of knowledge > which she investigates, and this makes her research all the more > significant.

Kathir and editing done by Anthony The film began production in 2016 and has been shot in seven countries, but it got delayed due to the post-production and technical issues.

Krishnan * Abhirami Venkatachalam * Dhivyadharshini * Preethi Nedumaran * Shravanthi Sainath Production =Development= Following the successes of Kaakha Kaakha (2003) and Vaaranam Aayiram (2008), director Gautham Menon and Suriya began discussions on another project featuring the duo. After rejecting two scripts including a film titled Ennai Nokki Paayum Thotta, Suriya was impressed and accepted to work on the spy-thriller film Dhruva Natchathiram, which Menon hoped to turn into a franchise. Revealed to be produced by Menon too, the team released a series of posters in April 2013 indicating that the film would feature 12 pivotal characters. The film was officially launched at the director's office in May 2013, with a few test shots also taken during the month. A. R. Rahman was confirmed as the film's music composer, while Rajeevan and Anthony were announced as the art director and editor respectively. Menon confirmed later in the month that Parthiepan and Simran had been added to the cast to play supporting roles. Actors Arun Vijay and Sudhanshu Pandey, were also signed on to play characters with negative shades. Trisha was signed on to play the lead female role in the film, after reports that Asin, Sameera Reddy, Amala Paul and Priya Anand had been considered. However, the film's first schedule was repeatedly postponed and ultimately by October 2013, Menon and Suriya parted ways citing creative differences. Suriya released a press note revealing that Menon had been tinkering the script for six months without any such progress and that he could wait no longer as he had committed to other films. He also recalled that the pair had a similar unfruitful experience when making a film titled Chennaiyil Oru Mazhaikaalam in early 2004. Following the release of Yennai Arindhaal (2015), Menon revived Dhruva Natchathiram and revealed he was working on the script by March 2015. Vikram was subsequently signed for the lead role, while Nayanthara was also selected to play the leading female role. The project failed to find financiers, before he picked up pre-production work on the film again during November 2015, hoping to start the film with Jayam Ravi. Despite progress, the film did not take off as a result of Ravi's busy schedule. Menon then narrated the script to producer S. Thanu, who set up a meeting for Menon to discuss the script with Rajinikanth. The actor liked the idea of the film, but later turned down the offer and chose to work with Thanu on Kabali (2016). In November 2016, Menon revived the project with Vikram and began working on the script again. Production began in early January 2017 in New York City, with a series of promotional posters released by the team. Harris Jayaraj who has worked on most of Gautham Menon's films, was confirmed as the composer. Actress Anu Emmanuel was added to the cast and also took part in an initial photoshoot. A two minute teaser was released in the same month; it was shot in fourteen hours around Manhattan, New York City with a Canon 5D SLR camera by cinematographer Jomon T. John. =Casting= The film began production with only Vikram and Anu Emmanuel as confirmed members of the cast in January 2017. In early February 2017, Anu Emmanuel opted out of the film citing scheduling issues following Vikram's decision to alter his schedule, so that he could simultaneously shoot for Sketch (2018) directed by Vijay Chander. Gautham Menon signed on actress Ritu Varma to replace her, after being impressed by Varma's performance in the Telugu film Pelli Choopulu (2016). Aishwarya Rajesh was also then signed to portray another leading female character in the film. The team also re-signed Parthiepan to act in the film, with his character tweaked from his role in the original script. Jomon later opted out of the film during March 2017 citing scheduling issues and was replaced as the film's cinematographer by Santhana Krishnan, the son of Ravi K. Chandran. Santhana Krishnan also opted out of the film in June 2017 and was replaced by Manoj Paramahamsa, who collaborated with Menon again after Nadunissi Naaygal (2011). During the same month, a bevy of supporting actors were signed to portray roles in the film including veteran actresses Raadhika and Simran, while rookie actresses Dhivyadharshini, Shravanthi Sainath and Maya Sundarakrishnan were also added to the cast. Three of Menon's former proteges Vamsi Krishna, Salim Baig and Sathish Krishnan also were selected to portray roles, as was Munna Simon. = Filming = Following the shoot of the teaser in New York City, the team moved to Coonoor to begin the first schedule in late January 2017. Following a brief shoot in the town, the team moved to Chennai for a further short schedule. After a schedule break, the shoot continued intermittently throughout Chennai in early 2017 as Vikram simultaneously worked around his commitments for his other film Sketch. During the initial schedules, scenes involving Vikram, Aishwarya Rajesh and Ritu Varma were primarily shot. Despite initially wanting to film sequences in the USA, the team later chose to use Eastern Europe as the main foreign backdrop for the ease of acquiring permission to shoot and sort out visas. The shoot began in Slovenia during mid-June 2017 with Vikram and the ensemble supporting cast, before moving to Bulgaria by the end of the month. After the completion of their work in Bulgaria, the team moved to Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates to film scenes in the desert and worked in extremely warm temperatures. Following the end of the schedule in mid-July 2017, Menon revealed that approximately thirty more days of shoot were required. In late August 2017, the team travelled to Tbilisi, Georgia to continue the shoot, with the ensemble cast joining the schedule. After several days of shoot in Georgia, the team were briefly left stranded after being denied permission to enter Turkey as a result of a document oversight. After two days of no shoot, they were granted permission to travel to Istanbul and continued filming. Following the schedule in Turkey, they returned to Georgia to continue the shoot for ten days. The film subsequently experienced a long delay in its production owing to Menon's financial constraints, with several other films associated with the director such as Enai Noki Paayum Thota, Naragasooran, Nenjam Marappathillai and the eventually shelved Pon Ondru Kandein also put on hold.https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/both-enpt-and-dhruva-natchathiram- will-release-year-gautham-menon-83237 During the period of delay, a second teaser trailer was released on YouTube during June 2018, and garnered positive reviews from critics. Despite claims from Menon that the shoot would be completed and the film would be released on 15 November 2019, the film continued to be delayed throughout 2019. On 2 November 2019, Menon said the film was in post-production and would be so for the next sixty days, though by June 2020 Vikram had not yet dubbed his lines, one of the few things needed to finish post-production.  Music  The film's music and background score was composed by Harris Jayaraj in his sixth collaboration with Gautham Menon. On 7 October 2020, Sony Music India released the music video of the first single \\"Oru Manam\\", which had lyrics written by Thamarai and sung by Karthik and Shashaa Tirupati.  Release  The film was originally scheduled to be release on August 2017, but postponed to April 2018 and again pushed to September 2019 due to some technical issues, along with censor works and shooting problems.

He studied music in Sopronm, where his patron was Count Henckl von Donnersmarck. After his death (1760), Kamie≈Ñski moved to Vienna to continue his education. There in 1762, he heard young Mozart play. He visited Warsaw for the first time in 1773: this year the publishing house of J. Engel issued some harpsichord works by Kamie≈Ñski (today lost). He gave piano and singing lessons, held an inn in Warsaw (on ≈öwiƒôtojerska street) and organized public concerts at Dulfowski manor house.  Compositions  Kamie≈Ñski's output includes 8 operas (2 German, 6 Polish), which the composer himself called operettas. Nƒôdza uszczƒô≈õliwiona (1778) was long considered the first Polish opera to be performed in public theatre. It opened a new era for Polish musical theatre. Kamie≈Ñski's musical language shows a mixture of styles, from baroque and galant to classical. There are also some characteristics of opera buffa. They all are present in Nƒôdza uszczƒô≈õliwiona. After his successes, Kamie≈Ñski turned more and more towards folklore, using structures from authentic Polish folk music. It can be clearly seen in Zo≈õka, czyli Wiejskie zaloty (1780), which had 76 performances in Warsaw up to 1820. Coloratura and espressivo arias combine with typical village songs and Polish dances, of which polonaise is the most popular. Kamie≈Ñski also composed Kr√≥tki rys o egzystencji najpierwszej oryginalnej opery polskiej (A Short Outline of the Original Polish Opera), published in Biblioteka Warszawska, iv (Warsaw, 1878).

It includes five commercial buildings and the town's 1883 union depot, and is reflective of the town's importance as a major railroad junction in northern New England. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. It was subsumed by the larger St. Johnsbury Historic District in 1980. with Description and history Former St. Johnsbury Union Station The town of St. Johnsbury was transformed in the mid-19th century into a bustling railroad service center by the arrival of both north-south and east-west railroad lines. The town's Union Station, a substantial brick French Chateau-style building, was built to accommodate the traffic of both the Connecticut and Passumpsic Railroad (which carried main- line passenger traffic between Boston and Montreal) and the St. Johnsbury and Lake Champlain Railroad, which served north Vermont to the west. Fires in 1892 and 1896 cleared commercial buildings northwest of the depot, at what is now the corner of Railroad Street and Eastern Avenue. New brick commercial buildings were built to replace those lost in the fires. with The historic district includes, in addition to the 1883 depot, four buildings on the east side of Railroad Street, and one on the west side, all extending north from the junction with Eastern Avenue. It also includes Depot Square, a small grassy area between the depot and Railroad Street. The most architecturally prominent of the commercial buildings are the Citizens and Merchants Bank Blocks, a pair of similarly-styled Romanesque four-story blocks at the southern end of the row, which share an elaborate cornice and rows of arched windows. Both were designed by Lambert Packard, a prominent local architect who borrowed extensively from the Richardsonian Romanesque in the design of these buildings. On the west side of Railroad Street is the former New Avenue Hotel, also four stories in height, with a large round entry section at the corner of Railroad and Eastern.

Childhood and education Gordon Sprigg Darnell was born on 7 October 1905 in Little Rock, Arkansas, the second of six children born to Roscoe \\"Ross\\" Wesley Darnell of Maywood, Indiana (now a suburb of Indianapolis) and Clara May Sprigg of Searcy, Arkansas. His siblings were Roscoe Eugene (1904‚Äì1906), Kathryn (1907‚Äì1997), Cecil (1911‚Äì2001), Willis Mack (1913‚Äì1935), and Glenn (1921‚Äì2009). Darnell spent his childhood in Little Rock, Arkansas. Most of his early days were spent along with the other local kids hanging out at Edgar E Elliott's Garage repair shop near his home. He was one of the more talented kids, according to Elliott, for whom he began working. Little did either of them know this was the beginning of a path that would lead to his career in aviation. One of the other notable children that hung around the garage was Dick Powell. Darnell also spent some time driving a traveling salesman around the area. He received training in the vocational department of Little Rock High School, graduating in 1922 as a certified automobile mechanic. He received his high school diploma from Morris Preparatory School, Little Rock College in July 1926. Darnell was almost 21 at the time, which aroused questions when he began his flying career. Military With his new status as a certified automobile mechanic, and permission from his parents due to being a juvenile, in 1922 Darnell went to work for the Arkansas National Guard as a driver and mechanic. He worked on the Guard unit's staff car, which was a hand-me-down Cadillac left over from World War I. Darnell also participated in weekly drills and summer camp with the Guard. On 24 October 1925, Darnell was promoted to the rank of Technical Sergeant (Tech Sgt.), the same day the 154th Aero Squadron was reformed as the 154th Observation. In November 1925 Tech Sgt Darnell was taken for his first airplane ride by one of the pilots. He later qualified as an aircraft mechanic. Darnell went through the Air Corps Primary Flying School from 1 March 1927 to 5 August 1927, Brooks Field, San Antonio, Texas. He then attended Air Corps Advanced Flying School from September 1927 to 4 February 1928 (Pursuit), Kelly Field, San Antonio, Texas. On 9 February 1928 Major Curtis R Barham, QMC, wrote a letter which recommended Lieutenant Darnell of the Air Corps Reserve, a commission in the 154th Observation Squadron. =Upside down AT-4= While flying with the 43rd School Squadron Darnell was lucky to escape serious injury on 1 February 1928 when his Curtiss AT-4 trainer on landing came to rest with its undercarriage pointing skyward and one broken wheel. He might have been shaken but Darnell was not held at fault and graduated from Primary Flying School just three days later. =Making contacts= On 21 August 1928 the Little Rock Chamber of Commerce appointed Lt. Darnell as a member of the Fields Directions, Information and Itinerary Committee for the Arkansas Air Tour to promote aviation across the state. He also did his first work for Paul R Braniff, Inc, and Braniff took notice of the young pilot. In September 1928 Darnell spent two weeks working for his new friend, Braniff, flying between Oklahoma City and Tulsa. =Another close call= On 21 April 1929 Lt. Darnell, flying in a 154th Observation Squadron Army plane out of Little Rock, was landing at the Municipal Airport in Fort Worth when his plane was struck by another aircraft. Henry Woods was piloting the other aircraft and preparing for takeoff when the two planes collided. Both planes were damaged but no one was hurt. Career in aviation =Cromwell Airlines= In May 1929 Texas oil driller Carl G. Cromwell hired Darnell as his personal pilot, flying a Lockheed Vega. Later, when Cromwell started his own airline in San Angelo, Texas, Darnell became his chief pilot and later the operator and manager. To man the new airline Darnell hired Jimmie Mattern and James Walker as pilots. Darnell bought two Stinson SM-6B Detroiters as the new fleet aircraft and used the existing Vega as a backup aircraft. The inaugural flight took off at 8am on 1 November. On 10 November while flying one of the new Stinson planes from Detroit Michigan, Darnell stopped at the Curtiss-Wright headquarters at Stout Field while on his way to San Angelo. A setback Cromwell had a setback on 7 December 1929 when Hangar No. 1 at Dallas Love Field burned down. The hangar belonged to Good and Foster Aero Service Company, who leased space to both private operators and transport companies. Most of the hangar and 12 aircraft were destroyed, including one of the SM-B6 Detroiters (NC-484H) belonging to Cromwell. By July 1930 Cromwell Airlines had folded. =Lea-Mex Development Co= Darnell flew the remaining Detroiter (NC-407M) aircraft to Oklahoma City in order to sell it to Oklahoma businessman John J Harden and his Lea-Mex Development Company working in New Hobbs, New Mexico. The development company of Lea County, New Mexico was involved in the newly incorporated Hobbs. Harden ended up hiring the newly unemployed Darnell as their pilot. Darnell worked for them for about a year. =United States Airways= After the death of his good friend and former employer, Cromwell, in 1931 Darnell moved his family to Denver, Colorado. He began working for United States Airways, Inc. (USA Inc.), making regular flights between Denver and Kansas City, Missouri. Emergency landing Darnell was on a routine flight from Kansas City to Denver on 28 June 1933 when there was a flight incident, forcing him to land the aircraft in a field of young corn near Goodland, Kansas. Darnell was able to get the four passengers out uninjured and the mail undamaged. The passengers aboard the plane were R. I. Olsen of Salina, Kansas, Miss Helen Fling of Kansas City, Mrs. L. V. Sams of Denver, and Robert Barr of Chicago, who continued into Denver by motor car. The flight had just left a stop in Salina where passenger Henry A Wallace, the Secretary of Agriculture from Kansas City, had disembarked. Not long after the incident, Darnell left USA Inc. =Braniff= In the wake of the Air Mail scandal and the cancellation of all government airmail contracts, Paul Braniff went to Washington, DC to petition for an airmail route. Braniff was not one of the companies banned from bidding on the new contracts, and in April it was granted one of the airmail contracts. In May 1934 Darnell made the long-term career choice to work for Braniff, after having left the company on four different occasions. He became one of Braniff's first pilots. In October 1935 Darnell was called to the White House, along with six other aviators, and was presented a medal by President Roosevelt. In August 1937 Darnell made news again. He, as pilot, and his brother Cecil Darnell as co-pilot, made up the crew on the route between Chicago and Dallas. Both had been working for Braniff for about two years. The \\"flying Darnells\\" gained more notoriety when 17-year-old movie star Linda Darnell (no relation) was traveling with her mother to Mexico City when they stopped in Brownsville to change planes. She commented on \\"the flying Darnells\\". Captain Gordon Darnell was the pilot for her flight from Kansas City to Dallas, and Captain Cecil Darnell was the pilot for her flight from Dallas to Brownsville. In 1959 Darnell celebrated his 25th year with Braniff. He retired as the company's number one pilot in October 1965. He had logged more than 34,000 hours and 8.5 million miles in his career by then. During his career Darnell piloted everything from a Stinson bi-plane to Boeing Jets. Flying Darnells The flying Darnells were well known in aviation circles as family members Gordon (pilot for Braniff), his daughter Donna (hostess for Continental), his son Gordon James (co-pilot for Trans-Texas), his brother Glen (co-pilot for Delta), and his brother Cecil (pilot for Braniff). Another brother, Willis Mack, was a pilot cadet who was killed 25 June 1935 in a crash at Selfridge Field, Michigan after graduating from Army Flying School on 20 February 1935 at Kelly Field, Texas. Flight incident =Pilot statement= \\"My name is Gordon Darnell. I am a resident of Kansas City, Missouri, and holder of Transport Pilot's License Number 1875. The total number of hours flown approximately 4265. I am employed as a pilot for the United States Airways, operating on regular schedule run between Kansas City, Missouri and Denver, Colorado. On June 28, 1933 I departed from the Municipal Airport, Kansas City, Missouri, flying Flamingo NC 9489. Ship was functioning properly throughout the entire trip until I reached the vicinity of Goodland, Kansas. While flying at an altitude of approximately two thousand feet I suddenly discovered fire which seemed to originate around the rear portion of the motor section and which permitted flames and fumes to enter through the floor boards into the pilot's cockpit. I immediately cut the throttle and switch and turned off the right hand gas tank. It was impossible to close the left hand gas tank connection due to the flames around that portion. I attempted to smother the flames in the cockpit by the use of a fire extinguisher. I lowered both windows in the pilot's cockpit and placed the ship in a nose high side slip which partly cleared the fumes and kept most of the flames out of the cockpit. A normal three point landing was made in a corn field approximately three miles east of the Municipal Airport at Goodland, Kansas. I left the ship by the front exit and after having removed the passengers, I then removed the mail and luggage with the exception of a small amount of personal effects contained in the pilot's cockpit. Contained in the luggage compartment there was approximately 124 pounds of express which was removed. After recounting the accident I firmly believe the fire originated around the motor section caused by gas leak. Shortly following removal of passengers and luggage the right gas tank exploded, throwing gasoline and flames high into the air. I have read the foregoing statements and certify that they are true and correct to the best of my knowledge. Gordon S. Darnell\\" Medal from the president On 29 October 1935 at a ceremony in the White House, Darnell was one of seven aviators awarded the Airmail Flyers' Medal of Honor by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt for extraordinary achievement. All seven of the pilots had saved the mail in hazardous landings. Present at the ceremony were President Franklin Delano Roosevelt; Postmaster General James A Farley; Lewis S. Turner of Fort Worth, Texas; James H. Carmichael, Jr. of Detroit, Michigan; Edward A. Bellande of Los Angeles, California; Gordon S. Darnell of Kansas City, Missouri; Willington P. McFail of Murfreesboro, Tennessee; Roy H. Warner of Portland, Oregon; and Grover Tyler of Seattle, Washington. Darnell's deed was chronicled on the well known Wheaties cereal box cover as part of a series of 8 box covers regarding the feats of pilots awarded the Air Mail Flyers Medal of Honor. President Roosevelt awards the Airmail Flyers Medal of Honor to seven pilots, with Darnell being the third in line to receive the medal. =Medal citation= Later life In the 1970s Darnell helped organize the Volunteer Fire Department of Flower Mound, Texas, as well as becoming a member. He was also an organizing member of the Flower Mound Summit Club, a men's charitable club. His wife Marie helped organize The Women of Flower Mound, the women's charitable club. Both clubs are still in operations as of January 2017.

His father owned a confectionery factory. He was educated at Dean Close School, Cheltenham. He joined the Coldstream Guards on leaving school in 1944, and served in Germany during World War II. After the war, he remained in Germany where he was involved in courts-martial. He left the army in 1947, having attained the rank of captain. He then received a bachelor's degree in law from Brasenose College, Oxford. Legal career Leonard was called to the bar in 1951. He entered the chambers of John Buzzard and specialised in criminal cases. He generally though not invariably appeared for the prosecution. In 1964, he became the central criminal court's second junior prosecuting counsel, and took silk in 1969. His Telegraph obituary describes him as a \\"shrewd prosecutor and deadly cross-examiner\\", adding that his style was \\"fair and understated, precise rather than flamboyant.\\" As a barrister, he was involved in the prosecutions of Emil Savundra for fraud, of the Kray brothers for the murders of Frank Mitchell and Jack McVitie, of Graham Young for poisoning several colleagues with thallium in their tea, and of George Ince and others for the so-called \\"Barn Murder\\" of Muriel Patience. He also repeatedly defended Patrick Armstrong, one of the Guildford Four, whose conviction for the Woolwich and Guildford pub bombings was eventually overturned. He was appointed successively deputy chair of the Surrey quarter sessions (1969‚Äì71), recorder (1972‚Äì78), circuit judge (1978) and common sergeant of the Old Bailey (1979). In 1981, he became a High Court judge of the Queen's Bench Division, an unusual step for a criminal law specialist. He frequently presided over criminal cases at the Court of Appeal. His Telegraph obituary states that he showed \\"all the hallmarks of a good judge: humanity, understanding, patience, tolerance ‚Äì and firmness when needed. A master of language, his judgments were elegantly phrased and word-perfect, even though they tended to be delivered ex tempore.\\" He is best known for presiding at the trial of the Ealing vicarage case in 1987, a burglary in which two of the criminals raped Jill Saward at knifepoint; her father and another man were also seriously assaulted. Leonard gave Saward's rapists what were perceived to be lenient sentences for rape ‚Äì especially in comparison with the sentence for aggravated burglary received by the group's ringleader, who had not participated in the rape. His actions were condemned by women's groups and others, with his comment that \\"the trauma suffered by the victim was not so great\\" being particularly castigated. The criminologist Anthony Bottoms suggests that Leonard made an \\"inferential error\\" based on Saward's \\"dignified demeanour in court\\";Bottoms, p. 29 he also draws attention to the fact that much of the evidence later available about her long-term medical and psychological problems was not presented in court.Bottoms, pp. 33‚Äì34 James Morton, writing in The Guardian, considered that the \\"repeated and humiliating criticism ... hurt [Leonard] deeply.\\" In Leonard's speech on his retirement, he apologised to Saward and referred to his conduct in the case as a \\"blemish ‚Äì I make no bones about it\\". As a High Court judge, Leonard also presided over the initial trial of Kiranjit Ahluwalia for the murder of her husband, a conviction later overturned. He was also one of the Court of Appeal judges in the unsuccessful appeal by the M25 Three; their convictions were later overturned. Outside court, he chaired the criminal bar association, advised the Home Secretary on restricted patients (1973‚Äì79), and served on the Judicial Studies Board, as well as on a committee that reviewed the obscenity and censorship laws. Personal life He met his wife Doreen (Dinkie) Parker in Germany during the war; she was in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. They married in 1948, and the couple had a son and a daughter. They lived at Merstham in Surrey. He retired in November 1993, after experiencing problems with his eyesight. His wife died in 1996, after an accident in Cyprus. Leonard died in 2002.

Description and history The Lakeview Inn is located in the southern part of the village of Greensboro, on the east side of Breezy Avenue overlooking the southern end of Caspian Lake. It is a rambling wood-frame structure, with a 2-1/2 story main block extended to the side and rear by 1-1/2 story sections, giving it an overall L shape. Its oldest section is near the northern end; it also presents a gable to the street, and has a single-story polygonal bay window in the first floor and pilastered corners. Shed-roof porches extend to either side of this section, covering the full width of the building. The interior reflects fifty years of evolutionary history, including some finish elements from virtually every major period of alteration. with The Lakeview Inn began in 1872 as a modest 1-1/2 story Italianate boarding house, catering to summer visitors enjoying the local scenery. In 1880 a summer colony of academics and artists was established at Lake Caspian, and the inn served as one of its major meeting points. It underwent several phases of enlargement, with the last significant actions being the unification of the facade in 1921 by the construction of the Colonial Revival porch across the front. It closed as a tourist venue in 1977, but was later reopened as a bed and breakfast accommodation.

According to Theophanes, \\"it is said that only three ships escaped\\". Aftermath This crushing defeat was a signal event: in its aftermath, the Egyptian fleets are not mentioned until the second half of the 9th century, following the Sack of Damietta. Beginning with E. W. Brooks, several scholars assumed that during this entire period, there was no Egyptian navy to speak of. This is incorrect, as Arabic and Coptic sources clearly mention the presence of an arsenal at Fustat and naval activity in Egypt throughout the period, but Egypt ceased to be a major base for naval expeditions against Byzantium during the century after Keramaia.

The line is built to the popular gauge of and runs every weekend throughout the year and all school holidays. History In 1949 Southern Miniature Railways Ltd started this gauge railway. They also operated miniature railways in Stokes Bay, Bognor Regis and Southsea. The only one to survive to present times is Poole Park. A freelance 4-4-2 tender loco ‚ÄúVanguard‚Äù was used every day until 1965 and occasionally until 1970. After 1970 two diesel outline locos were used first powered by Ford Sidevalve engines then diesel. Steam did briefly return in the 1990s with an engine called Arthur used mainly on Saturdays, which was sold in 1997. The line was taken over by Chris Bullen on 2 June 2005, becoming the third operator since 1949. Poole Borough Council ended their tenancy agreement with Chris Bullen in 2017, ordering that the historic track be removed before tenders for a new operator would begin on 1 March 2017. The council after a public and media backlash then said that the track may remain in place until after the tendering process. A petition was started to save the historic track from destruction on 38 Degrees website. The Railway was awarded to the Friends of Poole Park (a charity) in July 2017, with a concession to operate the Railway for 30 years. On 25 April 2018 two of the three railway CIC directors resigned as a result of an unworkable business relationship with the third director. The forty or more volunteers who had operated the railway and maintained the track all 'walked' out in sympathy. Subsequently, the Borough of Poole were unconvinced that the railway CIC could operate the railway safely, following a derailment in May 2018 and the walk out of Friends of Poole Park, the concession was withdrawn and the CIC issued with a 'Notice to Quit' in July 2018.

Clark Chair of Pharmacology at University College London. Her work is aimed at understanding the functioning of receptors that mediate fast synaptic transmission, and focuses on two classes of ion channels in the nicotinic superfamily, nicotinic and glycine receptors. Early life and education Professor Sivilotti graduated in Pharmaceutical Chemistry from the University of Ferrara in Italy . After graduate work in Ferrara and Milan on the modulation of transmitter release in the CNS, she was awarded travelling fellowships by the Royal Society and the Italian Ministry of Education to work at St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College in London. This project led to the description of what is now called the GABAC receptor and the award of a PhD in 1988. After a career break for family reasons, she undertook postdoctoral work at UCL, first with Clifford J. Woolf in the Anatomy Department, then with David Colquhoun in Pharmacology. In 1997 she joined The School of Pharmacy as a lecturer in Pharmacology, before moving back to UCL in 2003. She became a Professor of Pharmacology in 2008. [1] Scientific work Sivilotti uses electrophysiological methods to assess receptor function, combined with molecular biology methods to alter receptor structure. In addition she collaborates with crystallographers and molecular dynamicists to complement the functional work. [1] Her lab specialises in recording single ion channel activity and analysing it by the fitting of activation mechanisms. Mechanisms specify the number of conformations in which the channel-receptor protein can exist, the number of ligand molecules bound, and the connections between the states. Fitting them to the data allows the estimation of rate and equilibrium constants for transition between states. In 2004, Sivilotti et al. produced evidence that the glycine receptor had a short-lived shut conformation (dubbed the \\"flipped\\" conformation) that had a higher affinity for glycine than the resting conformation, and was a necessary precursor to the opening of the channel,. In 2008, her group showed that partial agonists were partial because of their limited ability to generate this flipped conformation,. The channel opening and shutting rates were similar for all agonists, contrary to what had been thought for 50 years A list of Sivilotti's scientific publications can be found on the UCL site, in Google Scholar, and on her web site, OneMol.org.uk Recognition =Editorial positions= 2014\\\\.

Phylodynamic analysis includes analyzing genetic diversity, natural selection, and population dynamics of infectious disease pathogen phylogenies during pandemics and studying intra-host evolution of viruses. Phylodynamics combines the study of phylogenetic analysis, ecological, and evolutionary processes to better understand of the mechanisms that drive spatiotemportal incidence and phylogenetic patterns of bacterial pathogens. Bacterial phylodynamics uses genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in order to better understand the evolutionary mechanism of bacterial pathogens. Many phylodynamic studies have been performed on viruses, specifically RNA viruses (see Viral phylodynamics) which have high mutation rates. The field of bacterial phylodynamics has increased substantially due to the advancement of next-generation sequencing and the amount of data available.  Methods  = Novel hypothesis (study design) = Studies can be designed to observe intra-host or inter-host interactions. Bacterial phylodynamic studies usually focus on inter-host interactions with samples from many different hosts in a specific geographical location or several different geographical locations. The most important part of a study design is how to organize the sampling strategy. For example, the number of sampled time points, the sampling interval, and the number of sequences per time point are crucial to phylodynamic analysis. Sampling bias causes problems when looking at a diverse taxological samples. For example, sampling from a limited geographical location may impact effective population size. = Generating data =  Experimental settings  Sequencing of the genome or genomic regions and what sequencing technique to use is an important experimental setting to phylodynamic analysis. Whole genome sequencing is often performed on bacterial genomes, although depending on the design of the study, many different methods can be utilized for phylodynamic analysis. Bacterial genomes are much larger and have a slower evolutionary rate then RNA viruses, limiting studies on the bacterial phylodynamics. The advancement of sequencing technology has made bacterial phylodynamics possible but proper preparation of the whole bacterial genomes is mandatory. = Alignment = When a new dataset with samples for phylodynamic analysis are obtained, the sequences in the new data set are aligned. A BLAST search is frequently executed to find similar strains of the pathogen of interest. Sequences collected from BLAST for an alignment will need the proper information to be added to a data set, such as sample collection date and geographical location of the sample. Multiple sequence alignment algorithms (e.g., MUSCLE, MAFFT, and CLUSAL W) will align the data set with all selected sequences. After the running a multiple sequence alignment algorithm, manual editing the alignment is highly recommended. Multiple sequence alignment algorithms can leave a large amount of indels in the sequence alignment when the indels do not exist. Manually editing the indels in the data set will allow a more accurate phylogenetic tree. = Quality control = In order to have an accurate phylodynamic analysis, quality control methods must be performed. This includes checking the samples in the data set for possible contamination, measuring phylogenetic signal of the sequences, and checking the sequences for possible signs of recombinant strains. Contamination of samples in the data set can be excluded with by various laboratory methods and by proper DNA/RNA extraction methods. There are several way to check for phylogenetic signal in an alignment, such as likelihood mapping, transition/transversions versus divergence plots, and the Xia test for saturation. If phylogenetic signal of an alignment is too low then a longer alignment or an alignment of another gene in the organism may be necessary to perform phylogenetic analysis. Typically substitution saturation is only in issue in data sets with viral sequences. Most algorithms used for phylogenetic analysis do not take into recombination into account, which can alter the molecular clock and coalescent estimates of a multiple sequence alignment. Strains that show signs of recombination should either be excluded from the data set or analyzed on their own. = Data analysis =  Evolutionary model  The best fitting nucleotide or amino acid substitution model for a multiple sequence alignment is the first step in phylodynamic analysis. This can be accomplished with several different algorithms (e.g., IQTREE, MEGA).  Phylogeny inference  There are several different methods to infer phylogenies. These include methods include tree building algorithms such as UPGMA, neighbor joining, maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian analysis. = Hypothesis testing =  Assessing phylogenetic support  Testing the reliability of the tree after inferring its phylogeny, is a crucial step in the phylodynamic pipeline. Methods to test the reliability of a tree include bootstrapping, maximum likelihood estimation, and posterior probabilities in Bayesian analysis.  Phylodynamics inference  Several methods are used to assess phylodynamic reliability of a data set. These methods include estimating the data set's molecular clock, demographic history, population structure, gene flow, and selection analysis. Phylodynamic results of a data set can also influence better study designs in future experiments.  Examples  = Phylodynamics of cholera = Cholera is a diarrheal disease that is caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. V. cholerae has been a popular bacterium for phylodynamic analysis after the 2010 cholera outbreak in Haiti. The cholera outbreak happened right after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, which caused critical infrastructure damage, leading to the conclusion that the outbreak was most likely due to the V. cholerae bacterium being introduced naturally to the waters in Haiti from the earthquake. Soon after the earthquake, the UN sent MINUSTAH troops from Nepal to Haiti. Rumors started circulating about terrible conditions of the MINUSTAH camp, as well as people claiming that the MINUSTAH troops were deposing of their waste in the Artibonite River, which is the major water source in the surrounding area. Soon after the MINUSTAH troops arrival, the first cholera case was reported near the location of the MINUSTAH camp. Phylodynamic analysis was used to look into the source of the Haiti cholera outbreak. Whole genome sequencing of V. cholerae revealed that there was one single point source of the cholera outbreak in Haiti and it was similar to O1 strains circulating in South Asia. Before the MINUSTAH troops from Nepal were sent to Haiti, a cholera outbreak had just occurred in Nepal. In the original research to trace the origin of the outbreak, the Nepal strains were not available. Phylodynamic analyses were performed on the Haitian strain and the Nepalese strain when it became available and affirmed that the Haitian cholera strain was the most similar to the Nepalese cholera strain. This outbreak strain of cholera in Haiti showed signs of an altered or hybrid strain of V. cholerae associated with high virulence. Typically high quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms (hqSNP) from whole genome V. cholerae sequences are used for phylodynamic analysis. Using phylodynamic analysis to study cholera helps prediction and understanding of V. cholerae evolution during bacterial epidemics.

It was founded in 1859 as a daughter association of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde (Society of Music Lovers). At that time the term amateurs (or dilettanti as they were also called) was not a pejorative one. It simply defined the real music lover as opposed to the professional musician. Many of these amateurs were fairly well trained, and their ensembles, often supported by professionals, gave public performances.  History  For several decades the Orchestral Association was an integral part of Vienna's music culture. The 20th century brought about far-reaching changes. It was not only the two wars that made it more and more difficult for the association to attract new members. It was above all the technological development in recording music. Tapes, compact discs etc. made music in high quality sound, performed by excellent orchestras, available for everyone. The techniques of playing improved considerably. Learning to play an instrument, making music, especially classical music, at home, in the family, became less interesting for more and more people. A few examples may show how well-reputed the Orchestral Association was in the past. Johannes Brahms conducted the ensemble and played the piano, Lovro von Matacic also worked as a conductor, whereas the violinist Arnold Ros√©, the pianists J√∂rg Demus and Paul Badura-Skoda werde accompanied by the Orchestral Association. In addition to this it has always been a main concern of the Orchestral Association to offer young artists at the beginning of their careers an opportunity of public performance, e.g. the violinist Henryk Szeryng, the pianists Alfred Brendel, Mitsuko Uchida and Ingolf Wunder. In 1993 the Orchestral Association had only 14 members und was on the brink of disbanding. Only merging with another amateur ensemble maintained its further existence. Given the opportunity to play in the Great Hall of the Society of Musik Lovers the Orchestral Association has regained good quality and high reputation since then. Since 2004 the Orchesterverein has been cooperating with the Akademische Bl√§serphilharmonie (Academic Wind Philharmonics), which makes more demanding programmes feasible. In order to keep up its high standard of performing, the Orchestral Association has decided not to present more than three concert programmes a year.

Career =Early life and amateur career= Sosa was born into a farming family in Pasca, Cundinamarca, a town located at high altitude in the Colombian Andes, near the capital Bogot√°. His father, who is a cycling fan, chose the name Iv√°n for his son after Iv√°n Parra, a Colombian cyclist whom he admired. He is the cousin of professional cyclist Jhojan Garc√≠a, and a close friend of fellow Colombian cyclist Egan Bernal. He left Colombia for Europe in early 2016 to race for the amateur team Maltinti Lampadari-Banca di Cambiano, and settled in Empoli, Italy. His first win for the team came in June, in the 79th edition of the Schio-Ossario del Pasubio race. =2017 season= In 2016, Sosa signed a two-year contract with Italian Professional Continental team beginning with the 2017 season. =2018 season= In January, he took his first victory as a professional by winning the 4th stage of the Vuelta al T√°chira. His real breakthrough came the following month though, when he finished an impressing 6th overall in the inaugural edition of the Colombian stage race Colombia Oro y Paz. In April, he was part of the team's line-up for the Tour of the Alps and wore the overall leader's jersey after finishing 3rd on the first two mountain stages, ahead of riders such as Chris Froome, Thibaut Pinot and Fabio Aru, but lost his leader's jersey after a crash during a descent on the third stage involving a race motorcycle. Sosa was not a part of the team's planned line-up for the Giro d'Italia, and team manager Gianni Savio stated that Sosa's impressing performance at the Tour of the Alps had not made him reconsidering his decision, despite Sosa \\"perhaps wanting to take part in the Giro\\". He explained his decision by saying his philosophy is to discover talents and let them develop little by little, continuing \\"It's one thing to ride a race such as the Tour of the Alps with great champions like Froome and Aru, but it has just five racing days and the stages are only short. It's another thing to throw a young 20-year-old rider with no international experience into a three week race such as the Giro d'Italia with stages of over 200 km\\". Instead he was part of the team's squad at the Tour of Bihor, a Romanian stage race, in early June, where he won the overall classification as well as one stage. Later the same month, he won the overall classification at the inaugural Adriatica Ionica Race, an Italian stage race, as well as one stage. World Tour contract dispute Sosa initially signed a two-year contract with , beginning in 2019, with Trek paying Sosa's release clause of ‚Ç¨120,000. However after an initial press release from the team, as well as a video published from Sosa, a dispute between Alberati Fondriest Cycling Academy (Sosa's initial representation) and well-connected rider agent Giuseppe Acquadro occurred. Acquadro took over representation of Sosa, informing Trek that he would not be riding for the team. Androni reimbursed Trek for the release clause and in late November 2018, Cyclingnews.com announced that Sosa would sign for on a three-year deal. =2019 and 2020 season= In May 2019, he was named in the startlist for the 2019 Giro d'Italia.

Directed by Roland Suso Richter, it was first shown on public broadcasting channel Das Erste on 30 November 2008. Synopsis On 13 October 1977, Lufthansa Flight 181, a Boeing 737-230 Adv named Landshut, is on its way from the vacation island of Mallorca to Frankfurt when it is hijacked by a team of four terrorists representing the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. They demand the release of several leaders of the Red Army Faction imprisoned in Germany. German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt refuses to negotiate with terrorists, aware that he is endangering not only the lives aboard the Landshut, but also that of German business leader Hanns Martin Schleyer, who is being held hostage by the RAF. The plane makes its way through several stops to Aden, Yemen, where the captain, J√ºrgen Schumann, is murdered by the hijackers. The plane continues on its way, eventually landing in Mogadishu, Somalia. As flight attendant Gabriele Dillmann and the surviving crew try their best to keep their passengers safe and calm, Colonel Ulrich Wegener leads the German federal police's newly formed counter-terrorism unit, GSG 9, in preparations to storm the Landshut. In the night between 17 and 18 October, Chancellor Schmidt gives Wegener the order to storm the plane and free the hostages.

It is within the Rhinebeck Village Historic District, a historic district added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 as a cohesive area of preserved historic buildings. The inn claims to be America's oldest continuously operated hotel. History In the early 1700s, William Traphagen, an early settler of Rhinebeck (then a village known as Ryn Beck), established a traveler‚Äôs inn called the Traphagen Tavern in the village. In 1766, Arent Traphagen, the grandsonson of William Traphagen, relocated the tavern to its present location, where the King‚Äôs Highway intersected the Sepasco Trail. When winter closed the river, the road was the only avenue of travel. It served as a stage-house for stage coaches. Stables were erected to accommodate the change of horses.Morse, Howard Holdridge. Historical Old Rhinebeck, Echoes of Two Centuries, Rhinebeck. 1908 It has remained in operation as a hotel ever since. Around 1765, a spring near the roadside supplied a well that became the \\"town pump\\". During the last third of the 18th century, the inn, was then known as the Bogardus Tavern. Arent Traphagen died in 1769 and the tavern was purchased by Everardus Bogardus, great-grandson of the New Netherlands dominie. It was host to many leaders of the American Revolution, including George Washington, Philip Schuyler, Benedict Arnold and Alexander Hamilton. In 1775, the 4th Regiment of the Continental Army drilled on the Bogardus lot near the tavern. By 1785, the King‚Äôs Highway was now the country's Post Road, and in 1788, after independence, the village continued to grow. The Town of Rhinebeck, which contains the village, was organized.Town and Village of Rhinebeck, , June 13, 2008; retrieved June 3, 2009.

Retrieved February 20, 2010. Everardus Bogardus died in 1799, and the tavern passed to his son Benjamin. In 1802, Asa Potter bought the inn from Benjamin Bogardus. In 1804, during the race for Governor of New York State, both candidates had headquarters in Rhinebeck. Gen. Morgan Lewis had his at the inn, then known as Potter‚Äôs Tavern, and Vice President Aaron Burr had his down the street at the Kip Tavern. Potts died in 1805. The tavern then came into possession of Captain Jacques, a former river sloop captain. It remained a rendezvous for politicians. Martin Van Buren was a frequent guest at Jacques' Tavern. In 1918, under the ownership of Tracy Dows, the inn was extensively renovated, with a ballroom being added. Dows's son Olin Dows, a United States Army artist who would serve in the European Theater of Operations during World War II, was commissioned to paint a mural in the Rhinebeck post office depicting the town‚Äôs beginnings. Note: This includes and Accompanying eight photographs Olin's Harvard classmate and close friend Thomas Wolfe visited the inn frequently, and his five years of prolonged stays at the inn have been said to have been the basis for what became his 1935 novel Of Time and the River. In 1957, the inn was host to New York Governor W. Averell Harriman upon the dedication of the Kingston‚ÄìRhinecliff Bridge. In the 1980s, a greenhouse room was added to the front of the ballroom. In 1987, the inn was owned by Charles LaForge Jr. Notable events The inn has been host to numerous local and national historic events, including: *Horace Greeley, a U.S. Representative and founder and editor of the New-York Tribune, was a frequent guest. *William Jennings Bryan, a Democratic nominee for President of the United States in 1896, 1900, and 1908, spoke from a second-story window to an enthusiastic gathering on the front lawn. *Benjamin Harrison and his running mate, Levi P.

The Kriegsmarine shore establishment was divided into four senior regional commands, who were in turn subordinated to the operational Navy Group commanders who commanded all sea and shore naval forces within a particular geographical region.Lohmann W. & Hildebrand H., Die Deutsche Kriegsmarine, Verlag Hans-Henning Podzun, Bad Nauheim (1956) Within each naval region were several subordinate naval districts who were responsible for all navy shore activities within their area of responsibility, most significantly were the various German ports of occupied Europe. Naval regions The naval regions (Marineoberkommando) were the senior most shore command in a given geographical area and were subordinate to the Navy Group commanders. A total of four naval regions were eventually established in occupied Europe during the Second World War. A deputy commander, known as the \\"2. Admiral\\" commanded staff units and oversaw regional administrative matters. Specifically, the deputy region commander oversaw the Schiffs‚ÄìStamm-Abteilung (Ship's Administration Department) which was a liaison for port commands and also served as the ultimate authority for personnel in transit or stationed in shore naval garrisons. For those permanent assigned to the ship's department, a subordinate Schiffs‚ÄìStamm- Regiment existed as an intermediary command.Goerlitz, Walter. History of the German General Staff, 1657-1945. Boulder and London: Westview Press (1985) Other major subordinates to the regional command were the Befehlshaber der Sicherung (Commander of Security), Inspektion des Schiffsmaschinewesens (Naval engineering inspector), Artilleriearsenalinspektionen (Inspector of arsenals and artillery), and the Sanit√§tsamt der Marinestation (Medical department). A regional signals detachment (Marine‚ÄìNachrichten‚ÄìAbteilung) also existed to coordinate orders and messages between the various subordinate commands. All naval regions were permanently assigned at least one navy shore combat unit. In most cases this was known as the Marine‚ÄìSch√ºtzen‚ÄìBataillon; a larger formation known as a Marine‚ÄìBordflak‚ÄìBrigade also existed. Engineering and pioneer naval units were typically grouped into a Marine‚ÄìFestungspionier‚ÄìBataillon. Regional commands were also responsible for the operation of all naval prisons. Naval prisoner-of-war camps were under the jurisdiction of a senior officer known as the Kommandantur des Marine‚ÄìKriegsgefangenen‚Äì und Interniertenlagers. All naval regions further maintained a legal office as well as a war correspondence company (Marinekriegsberichterkompanie). All induction and recruiting centers operated through an office known as the Marine‚ÄìAbrechnungs‚Äì und Vorpr√ºfungsamt while the Dienststelle f√ºr Eignungspr√ºfung administrated certification examinations for the various naval rates. Each naval region also maintained a billeting and housing office, known as the Abwicklungsamt. =Naval Region North Sea= The North Sea naval region was the first to be established and was originally known as Der Kommandierende Admiral der Marinestation der Nordsee. The command was formed from a preexisting unit of the Reichsmarine, known as the Marinestation der Nordsee. In the spring of 1943, the title was renamed as the Marineoberkommando der Nordsee. Major subordinate districts were the Deutsches Marinekommando Italien (this command eventually became Naval Region South) and the Admiral in den Niederlanden which oversaw all German naval matters in the occupied Netherlands. The following officers held the title of regional commander during the years of Naval region North Sea's existence. * Admiral Otto Schultze: Jul 1935 - Oct 1937 * Admiral Hermann Boehm: Oct 1937 - Oct 1938 * Admiral Alfred Saalw√§chter: Oct 1938 - Aug 1939 * Admiral Otto Schultze: Aug - Nov 1939 * Vice admiral Hermann Densch: Nov 1939 - Mar 1943 * Admiral Erich F√∂rste: Mar 1943 - May 1945 Major port cities under the control of Naval Region North Sea were Wilhelmshaven, Hamburg, and Bremen. The regional command was also the authority for all naval observatories in the area. A central administrative office, known as the Heimatverwaltung West coordinated all shore activities while the Heimatverwaltung Ausland oversaw region personnel deployed to other areas of the Kriegsmarine. The Tro√üschiffverband Nord was the department responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of all troop ships on call for deployment into the North Sea. =Naval Region Baltic Sea= Germany had maintained a naval presence in the Baltic Sea since the 19th century, and in 1865 the earliest continuous command in the area, the Marinestation der Ostsee, was established in Kiel. By June 1935, the Reichsmarine had established a position known as Der Chef der Marinestation der Ostsee. In November 1938, the Kriegsmarine created the post of Der Kommandierende General der Marinestation der Ostsee, also headquartered at Kiel. The region was commanded by a full admiral (or general admiral) with a deputy known as the 2. Admiral der Ostseestation. Subordinated to the Baltic Sea regional commander were three \\"coastal commanders\\" (K√ºstenbefehlshaber) who oversaw various harbor and coastal defense units. The port superintendent of Kiel (Marineintendantur Kiel) also reported directly to the regional command as well as several inspection units for naval weapons, artillery, torpedoes, and well as an Inspector for Training and Education (Inspektion des Bildungswesens der Marine). The naval region also contained a signals unit, medical department, and personnel branch. The commander of U-boats was originally administratively subordinated to the Baltic regional commander, but became an independent separate command after 1938. In mid 1942, the name of the command was shortened to Kommando der Marinestation der Ostsee and in 1943 adopted its final name as Marineoberkommando Ostsee. The two primary subordinate naval districts were the Admiral D√§nemark (controlling all shore based German naval forces in Denmark) and the Admiral Ostland which controlled naval shore forces east of Kiel, including those stationed in Poland. The following Kriegsmarine officers held the position as Baltic Sea regional commander: * Admiral Conrad Albrecht: Jul 1935 - Nov 1938 * Admiral Rolf Carls: Nov 1938 - Jan 1940 * Admiral G√ºnther Guse: Jan 1940 - Mar 1943 * Admiral Hubert Schmundt: Mar 1943 - Mar 1944 * General admiral Oskar Kummetz: Mar 1944 - May 1945 =Naval Region South= Shore activities in the Mediterranean Sea were originally overseen by an office, known as the Chef des Deutschen Marineverbindungsstabes, headed by Rear Admiral Eberhard Weichold and established in June 1940. The following year, the office adopted the lengthy title Deutscher Admiral beim Admiralstab der k√∂niglich italienischen Marine. In November 1941, the office was re-designated as the Befehlshaber des Deutschen Marinekommandos Italien. In March 1943, the command was assumed by Rear Admiral Wilhelm Meendsen-Bohlken. Meedsen-Bohlken was briefly replaced by Vice Admiral Friedrich Ruge, in May 1943, before Meedsen-Bohlken returned to the same post that August. In July 1944, command was assumed by Vice Admiral Werner L√∂wisch. In January 1945 the Italian naval shore command was renamed as the Oberbefehlshaber Marineoberkommando S√ºd. =Naval Region Norway= The final Navy regional command established during the Second World War was the Marineoberkommando in Norwegen, established in late 1943 to deal specifically with German naval forces in Norway. Admiral Otto Ciliax served as regional commander until the last month of the war when he was replaced by Admiral Theodor Krancke. The headquarters of the Norwegian naval region was at Oslo where was maintained a headquarters staff, signals company, and war correspondence unit. A naval weapons office, known as the Torpedoarsenal Norwegen oversaw all logistics for naval arms, in particular submarine torpedoes, for Kriegsmarine units stationed in Norway. The region also operationally controlled a submarine netting group known as Netzsperrgruppe Nord. In addition to regular naval shore commands,the Norwegian Naval Region also hosted four naval construction brigades (Bauaufsicht der Kriegsmarine) which were stationed in Horten, Bergen, Trondheim, and Troms√∏ Naval districts Naval districts were the direct operational forces for all shore units of the Kriegsmarine and were assigned coastal areas of responsibility as well as operational command of any permanently assigned submarine or ship flotillas (although administratively, these units were under the various type commanders). Most naval regions also maintained a staff headquarters unit, signals unit, war correspondence company, as well as a regional medical clinic. Navy districts were operationally subordinated to Navy group commanders and were organized by either geographical region or country of occupation. The \\"Admiral Deutsche Bucht\\" was headquartered in Wilhelmshaven and commanded German ports along the North Sea. The \\"Admiral z.b.V. S√ºdost\\" was in command of inland waterways, river units, and was headquartered at Traunstein. =France and the Low Countries= After the occupation of France and the Low Countries, the Kriegsmarine established a single regional command for these areas which was known as \\"Admiral West\\". The command was first stood up in May 1940, while the Battle of France was still ongoing, with its first commander Admiral Karlgeorg Schuster. In June 1940, following the surrender of France, the command's name changed to Kommandierender Admiral Frankreich and was headquartered in Paris. In May 1941, command as \\"Admiral Frankreich\\" was passed to Otto Schultze. In August 1942, the final commander, Wilhelm Marschall was appointed and would hold the command until that November. At that time the naval region of France was broken up into smaller areas as a result of Case Anton when Germany occupied the entirety of France. The three late war naval districts of France were: * Admiral Atlantikk√ºste (Western France) * Admiral Kanalk√ºste (English Channel) * Admiral franz√∂sischen S√ºdk√ºste (Southern France) Friedrich Rieve commanded the English channel district during the Invasion of Normandy while Ernst Scheurlen commanded southern France during Operation Dragoon. In both these cases, the commands were disbanded shortly thereafter due to an overrun of the districts by Allied forces. The \\"Atlantic Coast\\" command, overseeing the majority of naval forces in western France, remained active until early 1945 under its final commander, Admiral Johannes Bachmann. A special naval area was also established for the city of Paris and was known as the H√∂heres Kommando der Marinedienststellen in Gro√ü-Paris (Supreme Command for Naval Services in the Greater Paris Area). The command contained a headquarters staff, several transport units, a signals and communications division, legal office, and medical staff. Werner Lindenau served as naval commander of Paris from June 1943 until the Germans evacuated the city the following year.Rosbottom, R. When Paris Went Dark: The City of Light Under German Occupation, 1940-1944, Back bay Books (2015) German port facilities in occupied Belgium were never formed into an independent command and were subordinated to other regions and naval districts. Naval shore authority in the Netherlands was originally a subordinate officer to Admiral West and was known as the Marinebefehlshaber in den Niederlanden. The original commander was Lothar von Arnauld de la Peri√®re who briefly held the post for a one month in May 1940 before command was assumed by Helmuth Kienast. In June 1943, the post was past to Vizeadmiral Kurt Caesar Hoffmann who was in turn relieved by Gustav Kleikamp in March 1943. the following month, the Netherlands district became an independent command known as the Kommandierender Admiral in den Niederlanden. The final command of the district was Vice Admiral Rudolf Stange, who held command in January 1945 until the Germans evacuated the country in the face of advancing Allied forces. =Denmark and Norway= When German occupied Denmark in April 1940, the Kriegsmarine established a naval command for the entire country known as the Marinebefehlshaber D√§nemark. The command was first held by Admiral Raul Mewis and maintained two subordinate naval districts known as the Abschnitt Nordj√ºtland and the Abschnitt S√ºdj√ºtland und d√§nische Inseln. In March 1943 the name of the command was changed to the Kommandierender Admiral D√§nemark, frequently shortened to simply \\"Admiral D√§nemark\\". The command was then assumed by Vice Admiral Hans-Heinrich Wurmbach, who held the post until the end of World War II. In April 1944, after Germany had placed all of Denmark under military occupation the previous fall, the command name was again changed to Kommandierender Admiral Skagerak.Lampe, D., Hitler's Savage Canary: A History of the Danish Resistance in World War II, PWxyz, LLC (2014) The German occupation of Norway, with its direct access to the North Sea, required the Kriegsmarine to form a major naval command to deal with the vastness of the Norwegian coastline, along with its many ports and harbors. The originally Norwegian naval command was known as the Kommandierender Admiral Norwegen and the post was held by Hermann B√∂hm between 1940 and 1943. By the end of 1940, the Norwegian naval area had been elevated to the status of a naval region (the region name would formally change in February 1943), with the following subordinate Norwegian naval regions established. * Admiral norwegische Nordk√ºste (Northern Norway) * Admiral norwegische Westk√ºste (Central Norway) * Admiral norwegische S√ºdk√ºste (Southern Norway) * Admiral norwegische Polark√ºste (Polar Norway) The Norwegian naval region and areas would continue in full operation until the end of World War II and consisted of the largest number of Kriegsmarine forces which remained intact upon Germany's surrender in May 1945. Vigness, Paul G., The German Occupation of Norway, Vantage Press (1970) =Baltic Sea Naval District= The Baltic Sea naval area was first formed in November 1941, headquartered at Danzig, and responsible for German port and harbors east of the main naval region out of Kiel. The geographical area of the command was relatively small and the posted commander never held a higher rank than Kapit√§n zur See. After Germany invaded the Soviet Union, and occupied the Baltic states, the command's responsibility increased and eventually held authority over several naval shore facilities, including medical units, arsenals, and communication commands in Libau, Reval, and Riga. Two of the more unique units assigned to the Baltic area were a Pathologische Abteilung, consisting of naval medical personnel conducting pathology research, as well as an island station at T√ºtters. The area command also oversaw several coastal monitoring stations (K√ºsten√ºberwachungsstellen) which were incorporated into the Kriegsmarine system of sea defense zones. In 1944, as the Baltic countries came under danger of liberation by Soviet forces, the Baltic Sea area was divided into two geographical regions (east and west) with Vice Admiral Werner Lange assuming command in the west (as Admiral Westliche Ostsee) while Theodor Burchardi assumed command as Admiral √∂stliche Ostsee in the east. Following liberation by Soviet forces, the naval commands in Riga were accused of war crimes for utilizing Slavic and Jewish slave labor for hard labor on German controlled docks.Kuenzl, A. & Shimron G., The Execution of the Hangman of Riga. Vallentine Mitchell (2004) =North and Black Seas= The Kriegsmarine maintained four smaller naval commands to deal with various shore facilities not covered under another major naval area. The largest was the \\"Admiral Nordmeer\\", formed in October 1941 as a direct subordinate to the Naval regional commander for the North Sea. Hubert Schmundt served as the North Sea area commander until 1942 when he was replaced by August Thiele. Otto Kl√ºber then held the post until command was assumed by a deputy in 1944. An independent naval region was the \\"Admiral Schwarzes Meer\\", responsible for shore operations in the Black Sea. The command had originally been established as a navy expeditionary group before being renamed as the Deutsche Marinemission Rum√§nien in 1942. The name of the command was changed the following year to \\"Admiral Schwarzes Meer\\" before adopting its final name as the Kommandierender Admiral Schwarzes Meer in 1944. Several officers held this posting until Germany finally withdrew from the area in the face of Red Army advance. Black Sea area commanders * Vizeadmiral Friedrich-Wilhelm Fleischer: Feb 1941 ‚Äì Apr 1942 * Vizeadmiral Hans-Heinrich Wurmbach: May 1942 ‚Äì Aug 1942 * Konteradmiral Hellmuth Heye (acting commander): Sep 1942 ‚Äì Oct 1942 * Vizeadmiral Robert Witthoeft-Emden: Nov 1942 ‚Äì Jan 1943 * Vizeadmiral Gustav Kieseritzky: Feb 1943 ‚Äì Oct 1943 * Vizeadmiral Helmuth Brinkmann: Nov 1943 ‚Äì Oct 1944 The Black Sea area command held the same authority as a naval region and possessed a headquarters staff at Konstanza with an attached signals unit and naval pioneer battalion. The area command also held operational control over the deployment of two assigned submarine chaser flotillas as well as a flotilla of auxiliary minesweepers and patrol-sentry boats. The 30th U-boat Flotilla was also deployed to the area, however operational control was held by the Befehlshaber der U-Boote. Later in the war, the Black sea area gained a submarine netting unit known as Netzsperrgruppe Schwarzes Meer. In addition to standard ports and harbors, the Black Sea area maintained a number of commands for smaller inlet naval stations, known as Seetransportstelle. Around the Black Sea area were also interspersed naval directorate stations (Marine- Intendanturdienststelle) which coordinated all activities across the geographical region. =Aegean and Adriatic Seas= Following the German conquest of Yugoslavia and the invasion of Greece, the Kriegsmarine set up two naval commands for regional operations in the Aegean and Adriatic Seas. The Aegean naval command was first established in February 1941, under Rear Admiral Hans-Hubertus von Stosch. Command was then assumed in the fall of that year by Erich F√∂rste, who held it until February 1943, when command was past to Werner Lange. The Aegean naval command consisted of a headquarters staff as well as an attached signals unit and pioneer battalion. A naval garrison (Wachkompanie) was stationed at Salamis while the shipyards in Athens also fell under the regional command. The region further maintained a transportation company, two war correspondence companies, and was the administrative senior authority for the third destroyer flotilla and the 23rd U-boat Flotilla. Later in the war, the region added a legal office, quartermaster command, as well as a submarine netting squadron (Netzsperrgruppe S√ºd). The region was also the reporting senior for two German hospital ships. The Adriatic naval region (\\"Admiral Adria\\") was established in September 1943 under Vizeadmiral Joachim Lietzmann. The command originally consisted of a headquarters staff in Trieste accompanied by a communications unit and pioneer command. By 1944, smaller offices of the region, dealing with logistics, operations, torpedo armament, and naval artillery placements, had been established in Pula, Dubrovnik (Ragusa), Spalato, and Durr√´s. In July 1944, command was assumed by Vice Admiral Werner L√∂wisch. Naval areas In larger Naval regions, an intermediary command between the regions and local forces was the \\"Navy Area\\" (Marine‚ÄìAbschnitt) of which the Kriegsmarine established seventeen such areas during the Second World War. In occupied territories, as well as some major German ports, these areas were known as Kriegsmarinedienststellen (Navy War Service Areas) with fourteen established between 1941 and 1945. Navy areas were typically commanded by a senior naval officer, most often a Kapit√§n zur See or Korvettenkapit√§n, who was known as Der Kommandant im Abschnitt. =Navy Area Headquarters= * Borkum * Brunsb√ºttel * Cuxhaven * Emden * Friedrichstadt * Gotenhafen * Helgoland * Memel * Norderney * Pillau * R√ºgen * Stralsund * Swinem√ºnde * Sylt * Wangerooge * Weserm√ºnde * Wilhelmshaven =Navy War Service Areas= * Aalborg * Bordeaux * Boulogne * Bremen * Danzig * D√ºnkirchen * Hamburg * K√∂nigsberg * Kopenhagen * Le Havre * Marseille * Oslo * Ostende * Stettin Sea defense zones Sea defense zones were tactical naval areas, along the coastline of occupied Europe, intended to provide an operational command chain in the event of an actual enemy attack. The zones were commanded by an officer normally ranked as either Kapit√§n zur See or Konteradmiral. The sea defense zone commander (Kommandant der Seeverteidigung) answered to the Navy regional commanders and would take tactical control over all shore forces in a given area should an enemy launch an actual attack against a segment of German coastline. In practice, the sea defense zones became well tested when the Allies invaded western Europe, in particular at the battle of Normandy. Sea Defense zone forces also fought fiercely to avoid losing Germany's submarine bases in France, in one case holding out for several months under Allied siege before surrendering.

The village was established in the 19th century as the halfway point in the Grand Trunk Railway, an international railroad connection Portland, Maine and Montreal. Island Pond was a major service center for the railroad, and became a commercial hub of northeastern Vermont. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Description and history The town of Brighton was an isolated farming community in northeastern Vermont prior to 1853, the year the two halves of the Grand Trunk Railway met at Island Pond (named for the nearby body of water, which has a small island in it). Over the next twenty years, the town's population rose from under 200 to more than 1,500, with many of the new residents somehow involved in the operations of the railroad. There was a large service yard in the area between Railroad and South Streets, where the former depot still stands, including service sheds and a turntable, and the station was a customs and immigration stop. The railroad was a driving economic force in the community, which suffered as the railroad declined in importance in the mid-20th century. Passenger service ended on the route in 1963, and much of the service infrastructure was demolished by the mid-1970s. with The historic district encompasses a large part of the northern section of the village of Island Pond. It is bounded on the south by Main Street and Railroad Street, which flank the railroad right-of-way to the north. It is bounded on the east by Elm and Mountain Streets, and the west by Maple Street, with its northern boundary at North Street. It covers , including the railroad-facing elements of the business district on the south side of Main and Railroad Streets, with the village's major residential area on the north side of the tracks. Most of the district's buildings were built in the half- century following the railroad's arrival in 1853, and are of vernacular wood- frame construction. There is only one brick buildings in the district (the railroad station), and three churches. Of the buildings in the district, only one, the Christ Church, is known to be architect-designed.

Hardin‚ÄìSimmons had 470 of those on the ground, while the Aztecs had a mere 66 on the ground.

Before 1990 she was a university teacher of Ethics in the Philosophy Department at the Humboldt University in (East) Berlin. She was persuaded to retire on health grounds in October 1990, but in the words of one headline writer slightly less than twenty years later, this has left her \\"winding down, but not muzzled\\" (\\"Abgewickelt, aber nicht mundtot\\"). Life =Family provenance and early years= Helga Erika Ivertowski was born, the younger of the two daughters of Paul and Maria Ivertowski, in Danzig. Her father worked on the docks as a crane operator. He was also an anti-government activist, and one of a group arrested in 1938 (or 1939) and detained on account of \\"antifascist activities\\" (in the phrase favoured by East German sources). The detainees faced trial at the special people's court in Berlin in 1940. Four group members were sentenced to death. Paul Ivertowski was sentenced to imprisonment for life and spent the war years at the concentration camps in Dachau and, later, Mauthausen, from where he was released by US troops in May 1945. Her mother was left to bring up their daughters in wartime Danzig where in 1942 she started school. Caught up in the ethnic cleansing of 1944/45 Maria Ivertowski and her daughters struggled to make their way towards the west, ending up in Nauen, a short distance to the west of Berlin and after May 1945 in the part of Germany administered as the Soviet occupation zone. It was here that the family were reunited with their father, although the marriage of Paul and Maria Ivertowski later ended in divorce. =Further education and marriage= She grew up and completed her schooling in Nauen. In October 1949 the Soviet occupation zone was relaunched as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany) Passing her school final exams (Abitur) opened the way to university-level education, and she progressed to Berlin's Humboldt University (HUB) where she studied Philosophy, Ethics and Psychology. In 1954, still aged only 19, she married fellow philosophy student . The marriage would produce three recorded children and seven grandchildren (February 2010). =Light bulbs and the return to university= After completing her first degree she became active as a trades union official (3rd secretary for agitation and propaganda) in youth work while working between 1957 and 1959, in the huge \\"Narva\\" (as the company would later be known) light bulb plant in East Berlin. Sources indicate that she would have preferred, as her husband had done, to continue with her academic career, but - despite her husband's support - as a newly married woman with young children this possibility was not immediately open to her even in East Germany where, for economic and demographic reasons, female participation in the overall workforce was far higher than in West Germany. The light bulb plant was only a few steps from the (at this stage still porous) border with West Berlin. As a union activist within the plant she campaigned powerfully, both against the endless bureaucratic restrictions on how workers might benefit from the potential economic opportunities this presented by the border, and against workplace gender discrimination. She then worked and 1959/60 as a teaching assistant at the \\"Bruno Leuschner\\" Economics Academy in Berlin-Karlshorst which gave her the opportunity to take an academic approach to analysing women's social position. During the early 1960s she was able, as a post-graduate student to resume her association with the Humboldt. She received her doctorate, for which she was supervised by , in 1965. Her dissertation was entitled \\"Some of the philosophical-ethical problems in determining the role of women in society and applying equal rights\\" (\\"Einige philosophisch-ethische Probleme bei der Bestimmung der gesellschaftlichen Rolle der Frau und der Durchsetzung ihrer Gleichberechtigung\\"). It was later published as a book, with the snappier title \\"Woman as a person\\" (\\"Die Frau als Pers√∂nlichkeit\\"). The book was officially tolerated, but largely ignored. Between 1965 and 1969 she served as honorary (i.e. unpaid) of the Women's Commission on Trades Union Research at the Humboldt. Her habilitation (higher qualification) followed in 1974, setting her on course for an academic career. The theme of her work this time was \\"Personality, Morality and Ethical Education\\" (\\"Pers√∂nlichkeit, Moral und sittliche Erziehung\\"). =As an establishment academic and ethicist= She was now appointed to a full professorship for Ethics at the Humboldt. She had already, in 1971, initiated the creation of the Department for Ethics as a division of the university's Section for Marxist‚ÄìLeninist Philosophy. She later took over from Anneliese Griese, serving as Head of the Philosophy section between March 1987 and January 1990. Her successor in this position was Heinz Kuchling.Helga E. H√∂rz: Zwischen Uni und UNO. Erfahrungen einer Ethikerin. trafo Verlagsgruppe Dr. Wolfgang Weist, Berlin 2009, pp. 310-333, . Additionally, during the early 1970s she was a member of the working group on \\"Problems of biological, psychological and social personality determination\\" with the East German Academy of Pedagogical Sciences. Between 1988 and 1990 she served as a member of the Philosophy Advisory Board and headed up the permanent \\"Ethics\\" working group at the East German Ministry for Higher and Vocational Education. As a member of the (East) German Academy of Sciences she served on various advisory bodies including the one on \\"Women in Socialist Society\\". On the international stage H√∂rz served as a deputy council member with the Women's International Democratic Federation (WIDF), participating in its congresses at Helsinki, Berlin, Prague and Moscow and numerous international consultations and seminars, also taking part in a National Women's Conference in Bangladesh. She was involved in setting up consultative meetings and expert advice in the context of collaboration between the WIDF and the United Nations, also for many years representing East Germany in the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women. Political developments during 1989 and the realisation after November of that year that the Soviet forces had no orders to the crush street protests violently, as they had in 1953 opened the way to German reunification which followed, formally, in October 1990. The East German style of Marxist philosophy was not a priority for the new Germany and Helga H√∂rz was persuaded to retire early, on health grounds at the prompting of East Germany's last Minister for Education, Hans Joachim Meyer. The world of East German philosophical did not so instantly cease to exist, however, and H√∂rz became the honorary (unpaid) leader for a series of events in the Berlin \\"Socio- cultural Contact Centre for Senior citizens\\" between 1992 and December 1994 and, from 1997, an advisory board member for the \\"Training Academy of the Berlin Regional Association for People's Solidarity\\". Between 1997 and 2011 she served for fifteen years as chair of the advisory board, responsible for organising academic presentations, reading sessions with authors and computer courses. She published her memoires in 2009. United Nations In 1975 Helga H√∂rz was elected to membership of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women by the UN Economic and Social Council. She was involved in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, and introduced in 1979 a declaration \\"on the stronger inclusion of women in the fight for peace\\" which was adopted by the General Assembly in 1982 and, it has been suggested, incorporated in UN Resolution 1325. H√∂rz participated in UN World Women's Conference (Copenhagen, Nairobi) and UN seminars (Groningen, Geneva, Vienna, Paris). She addressed gender problems in 1975 in London, at the 1977 UN seminar in Groningen and at the 1979 ECE \\"Time Management\\" seminar in Geneva. Within the UN she served as vice-chair for UN Commission day- sessions \\"On the status of women\\" in Vienna (1978) and New York (1979 and 1980). In March 1980, and again in 1990, she chaired a Vienna day session, and at the second UN World Women's Conference at Copenhagen in July 1980 she was first vice-chair \\"in charge of coordination\\". As soon as East Germany ceased to exist as a separate state, which happened early in October 1990, Helga H√∂rz's role as an East German delegate at the United Nations meetings on women's issues came to an end.

This resulted in the deaths of all seven crew members on board the aircraft and an additional twenty-three people on the ground. This accident is the deadliest aviation disaster to occur in Kansas. It is also the second-deadliest aircraft accident in the United States involving victims on the ground, after the Green Ramp disaster in 1994, which killed 24 people on the ground. Accident details Aftermath of the crash in a neighborhood outside of McConnell Air Force Base At 9:28 a.m. CST (3:28 p.m. UTC) on Saturday, 16 January 1965, a Boeing KC-135A-BN Stratotanker, serial number 57-1442, took off from the McConnell Air Force Base and gained very little altitude. During this time, the aircraft began to experience a large amount of yaw, and attempted to return to the airport. The crew then began to dump large quantities of fuel from the aircraft's refueling tanks. Shortly after this, the aircraft made a hard bank to the left, and began to enter a roll. Unable to recover, the aircraft crashed into a suburban neighborhood at the intersection of Piatt and 20th Street, just three minutes after take-off. The site is several blocks northwest of Wichita State University. The aerial refueling aircraft was loaded with of jet fuel, and the crash resulted in a large explosion and subsequent fire, which engulfed dozens of homes. The accident killed all seven crew members on the aircraft and an additional twenty-three people on the ground. In addition, at least twenty-seven people on the ground sustained injuries, three of which were serious. It was reported that the crew entry door was jettisoned and a B-52 Stratofortress bomber, which took off prior to the KC-135, may have blown a detached drag chute from an F-105 Thunderchief against the departing aircraft. These factors may have contributed to the crash. Recently un-redacted portions of the accident report indicate that the parachute ingested into the Number 1 engine was that of the crew member who attempted to bail out through the crew entry door. His body was found about 200 feet from the impact crater. The aircraft and crew were based at Clinton-Sherman Air Force Base in west central Oklahoma, less than to the southwest. Aftermath Ten months after the accident, the U.S. Air Force issued an official accident report that stated that the crash was caused by \\"a rudder control system malfunction,\\" which was impossible for the crew to overcome. In 1971, the Piatt Memorial Park was opened to serve as a local recreational facility and a reminder of the tragedy. The park features several amenities, including a playground, a drinking fountain, and a basketball court. On July 14, 2007, more than forty-two years after the accident, an airplane-shaped twelve by twenty-two foot Imperial Black Granite monument with the names of all thirty victims of the crash inscribed on it was unveiled at a ceremony.

Noonlight users can trigger an alarm by clicking a button. Users can connect other smart devices, to automatically trigger alarms for them. The app is available for both Android and iOS devices. It has protected over 1 million users since 2013 and handled over 50,000 emergencies across the U.S. Noonlight was developed by Zach Winkler, the company's CEO.  Background  The app was created in 2013 at the University of Missouri in response to the high number of crime reports and the slow identification of the location of people making calls by 911 services. Winkler notes that \\"what most of us don't realize is that 9-1-1 really doesn‚Äôt have your location when you call them. It takes them up to six minutes sometimes to get a 300-meter accuracy reading of where you are\\". Noonlight is able to obtain users' exact GPS location within 5 meters in seconds of triggering the alarm. In February 2017, SafeTrek was one among the top 25 promising Start Ups, according to CNBC.  Connected Safety  Noonlight originally started as a way to get students from one point to another safely, and now it allows users to connect other apps and smart devices through the Noonlight app. This creates a way for users to get help even when they are unable or unaware of the emergency by allowing the connected app or device to trigger the Noonlight alarm for them. This solution also sends first responders vital details to make them more aware of the situation and better prepared. Also, users who already have memberships through some of these connected devices now have access to the safety button or other safety features through Noonlight.  Downtown St. Louis Collaboration  In 2016 Downtown St. Louis partnered with SafeTrek and offered a six-month free subscription to 4,000 downtown residents, available on a first-come, first-served basis. In 2018 the St. Louis MetroLink contracted with Noonlight to offer their riders access to Noonlight's safety app. Similarly, Washington University in St. Louis offers a free subscription to all students, faculty, and staff.  Data collection and analysis  The data collected in the background is used to better assess the danger potential of specific areas throughout the U.S.and is sold to insurance agencies for individual user‚Äôs driving risk assessment For example, data released by the Noonlight app showed an intersection of Southern Methodist University's campus where users of Noonlight feel most unsafe. The Noonlight team has worked alongside local police departments to create a complementary police dashboard which marks and tracks locations of users, as well as passes along vital information to first responders collected through connected apps and devices. The intention is that policy makers, agency leaders, and individuals can make better and more informed decisions, improve resource utilization, and ultimately prevent emergencies from happening in the first place.

He was the state leader of the Country Party from 1922 to 1923, and a minister in the government of Sir James Mitchell from 1921 to 1924. Early life Maley was born in Greenough, Western Australia, to Elizabeth (n√©e Waldeck) and John Stephen Maley. He attended the High School in Perth on a scholarship, and after leaving began working as a clerk for the Midland Railway Company. After two years, he moved to Kalgoorlie and was employed by a mining syndicate. During the Boer War, Maley served with the West Australian Mounted Infantry. He took over his father's farm in Greenough after the war's end, and also owned land in Three Springs from 1907 to 1913 (in partnership with his brothers). Maley served as secretary of the Greenough Road Board, and was also secretary of the Geraldton branch of the Farmers' and Settlers' Association.Henry Kennedy Maley ‚Äì Biographical Register of Members of the Parliament of Western Australia. Retrieved 3 June 2016. Politics Maley first stood for parliament at the 1905 state election, running unsuccessfully as a Ministerialist in the seat of Greenough. He recontested Greenough for the Country Party at the 1917 election and was successful, defeating the sitting member, John Cunningham. After the 1921 election, Maley was appointed Minister for Agriculture in the Mitchell government, replacing Hal Colebatch. He was elected to the Country Party leadership in August 1922, following the resignation of Tom Harrison. There were three other candidates, William Pickering, Alec Thomson, and Charles Latham, with Latham subsequently being elected deputy leader.\\"COUNTRY PARTY LEADERSHIP QUESTION.\\", The West Australian, 23 September 1922. In 1923, the Country Party split into two factions due to a dispute over the status of the coalition with the Nationalists. Maley supported the coalition, but at the 1924 state election was opposed by William Patrick, a member of the opposing faction. Some of Patrick's supporters directed their preferences to the Labor candidate, Maurice Kennedy, which resulted in Maley losing his seat by a margin of just 25 votes on the two-party-preferred count. Maley recontested Greenough as a Nationalist at the 1927 election, but was unsuccessful. Charles Maley, Henry's older brother, was also a member of parliament, representing the seat of Irwin. He died in office in October 1929, and at the resulting by-election Henry was elected as his successor. However, the seat of Irwin was abolished prior to the 1930 state election, and merged into the new seat of Irwin-Moore. Maley did not contest Irwin-Moore, but instead ran again in Greenough, as an independent. He failed to make the final two-candidate-preferred count. Later life Maley retired to Subiaco, and from 1929 to 1943 served on the Subiaco Municipal Council. He had earlier served on the Rottnest Island board of control from 1923 to 1925. Maley died in Perth in February 1956, aged 77. He had married Mabel Louisa Bateman in 1911, with whom he had three sons.

Five people were killed while six others were injured in the shooting. About 36 people sustained injuries in the ensuing panic. Esteban Santiago-Ruiz, who committed the shooting, was taken into custody within 90 seconds after he started shooting, surrendering to responding sheriff's deputies. He was later diagnosed with schizophrenia and pleaded guilty. Attack The attack happened near the baggage claim in Terminal 2. The shooter opened fire with a Walther PPS 9mm semi-automatic pistol in the airport at about 12:53 p.m. EST, in the baggage claim area of Terminal 2, which is the host terminal for Delta Air Lines and Air Canada. Video showed travelers rushing out of the airport and hundreds of people waiting on the ramp as numerous law enforcement officers rushed to the scene. Part of the panic occurred following \\"unfounded reports of additional gunshots\\"; the false alarm touched off a brief panic in other terminals. Former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer tweeted from the airport, \\"Shots have been fired. Everyone is running.\\" The shooting lasted about 70 to 80 seconds. The suspect lay down on the floor after he stopped shooting, having run out of ammunition.Officers mishandled response to Fort Lauderdale airport shooting, report says, leading to chaos, Miami Herald, Chabeli Herrera & Amy Sherman, June 7, 2018l Retrieved May 10, 2018. Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel stated that law enforcement officers did not fire shots and that the gunman was arrested without further incident. Aftermath The Federal Aviation Administration issued a ground stop notice, closing the airport to all but emergency flights. Port Everglades, staffed by American Red Cross, assisted about 10,000 passengers who were bused there for food, shelter and to connect to transportation. The airport remained closed for the remainder of the day, but reopened to commercial flights early the following day. Following the shooting, more than 20,000 pieces of baggage were left at the airport amid the chaos. Passengers were contacted by the FBI as a result of the shooting. President Obama was briefed about the shooting by Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Lisa Monaco. President-elect Donald Trump tweeted that he was monitoring the situation and that he had spoken with Florida Governor Rick Scott regarding the shooting. President Obama later consoled the victims and stated that he had asked his staff to reach out to Mayor Jack Seiler in order to make sure efforts were coordinated between state and local officials. Scott ordered flags of the United States and of Florida to be flown at half-mast throughout the state on January 7 and 8 to honor the victims. People =Victims= Five people died in the attack, all of whom were passing through Fort Lauderdale to begin cruises with their spouses. The number of people injured due to the shooting was six, with three admitted to intensive care units. The sheriff said that in addition to the people injured by gunshots, about 30 to 40 others were \\"injured in the panic\\" during the event. =Perpetrator= Esteban Santiago-Ruiz (born March 16, 1990), a -year- old resident of Alaska, unemployed, and a former National Guard member was arrested immediately after the shooting. Santiago flew on a Delta Air Lines flight from Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport in Alaska, connecting through Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul International Airport. Investigators say that he declared a 9mm pistol with two magazines, locked in a secure container, his only checked baggage. He retrieved it in Fort Lauderdale and loaded the gun in the airport bathroom just before the attack. Santiago was reported to be carrying military identification at the time of the shooting. Santiago was born in New Jersey in 1990 and moved to Puerto Rico two years later. He lived most of his life in Pe√±uelas, Puerto Rico, and attended high school there.Lizetta Alvarez, Frances Robles & Richard P√©rez-Pe√±a, Fort Lauderdale Shooting Suspect‚Äôs Motive Remains Unclear, Officials Say, New York Times (January 7, 2017). He joined the Puerto Rico National Guard on December 14, 2007, and served in the Iraq War from April 23, 2010, to February 19, 2011, as a combat engineer. He later served in the Alaska Army National Guard from November 21, 2014, until receiving a general discharge in August 2016 for \\"unsatisfactory performance.\\" He was a private first class and received ten awards during his time in the military. According to his family members, he had become mentally ill after his tour in Iraq and was severely affected by seeing a bomb explode near two of his friends while in service. They also stated he had recently received psychological treatment, which was confirmed by federal officials. The Puerto Rico Police opened an investigation into his errant behavior and confiscated his firearms in March 2012. They were, however, returned to him in May 2014. He also obtained a Florida driver's license in August 2012 even though he never lived in Florida, per official records. He provided the license on his successful application for permission to carry a concealed gun in Puerto Rico. He later moved from Puerto Rico to Alaska, along with his brother, in the same year. While in Alaska, Santiago worked as a security guard for a private company, where he was described as being \\"quiet and solitary.\\" He became increasingly violent over the following year. In January 2016, Santiago was arrested and charged with assault in an incident involving his girlfriend in Anchorage, Alaska. Police alleged that Santiago yelled at her, broke down the door, and choked her. The case resulted in a deferred prosecution agreement, and a domestic violence temporary protection order had expired. Santiago was subsequently scheduled to appear by telephone for sentencing in the domestic violence case in mid-April 2017. Santiago visited the FBI field office in Anchorage in November 2016 and reported that the U.S. government was controlling his mind and making him watch online videos by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, and that he was being forced to join that group by the CIA. He stated that he was hearing voices in his head telling him to commit acts of violence, but he also said that he was in control and did not intend to hurt anyone. The FBI urged the man to seek mental health treatment and notified the local police who detained him and took him to a medical facility for a mental health evaluation. He was later investigated by the FBI, which discovered no links to terrorism or any violation of laws occurring during the Alaska incident. Alaska police took his handgun from him due to the incident, holding it for twenty nine days, but returned it in December because Santiago had not been convicted of a serious crime, involuntarily committed to a mental institution, or adjudicated as mentally defective. His weapon was not seized by the FBI, nor was he prevented from checking it for a flight, according to Karen Loeffler, the Alaska U.S. Attorney. She said federal law requires someone to be ‚Äúadjudicated‚Äù as mentally ill before they can be kept from flying with a firearm. ‚ÄúThis is not somebody that would have been prohibited, based on the information that they had,‚Äù she said of the Anchorage Police Department and the F.B.I. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a country of laws, and they operate within them.‚Äù He had also been dismissed as a security guard at Signal 88 Security on November 15, due to his mental health problems. Investigation Santiago was identified by multiple law agencies as the only suspect, having fired a semi-automatic 9mm handgun at people in the baggage claim in Terminal 2. Per court documents and a federal affidavit, Santiago admitted to planning the attack, buying a one-way ticket to the airport and checking a box with a Walther 9mm semiautomatic handgun and the two ammunition magazines he used in the shooting. He stated that he later loaded his handgun in a bathroom at the airport and \\"shot the first people he encountered\\" after coming out. The suspect made a flight reservation to New York City, New York, for December 31, 2016, which officials told ABC News might have been his preferred destination. However, he canceled the reservation, and investigators believe that the deployment of a large number of NYPD officers may have been the reason he did so. He booked a one-way ticket to Florida a few days later. Counterterrorism officials in New York meanwhile investigated his plan to visit the city and whether he planned to stay or transfer to another flight. The FBI stated that he appeared to have arrived in the city specifically to carry out the shooting. Investigators found no specific reason why he chose the airport, nor had they determined a motive. The Qupqugiaq Inn, a motel in midtown Anchorage, was evacuated and searched on the day of the shooting as part of the investigation into the suspect. He had recently been a resident of the Qupqugiaq Inn, which offers monthly rentals. The FBI used a flatbed tow truck to seize the motel's dumpster, which was searched at their Anchorage field office. They conducted interviews with 175 witnesses and people who knew Santiago. According to government officials, Santiago had not been flagged for significant foreign travel or possible terrorism ties. However, they did not rule out terrorism as a possible motive, with the police investigating whether or not he was a homegrown terrorist or mentally disturbed. TMZ released a leaked \\"surveillance video\\" of the shooting on January 8 which led to the launch of an investigation into the leak. A Broward Sheriff's Office deputy, identified as the individual who leaked the video, was put on paid suspension pending investigation. Investigators stated that during initial interviews, the suspect said that he had been under \\"government mind control\\" and \\"hearing voices\\" and that he had been \\"participating in jihadi chat rooms online\\" before the attack. Later in April 2017, the investigators stated that no link to terrorism was found. During interviews with police after the attack, Santiago also stated that the gun used in the shooting was the same weapon seized and later returned by the police in Anchorage in 2016. Prosecution The day after the shooting, federal officials filed criminal charges against him including performing an act of violence at an international airport, using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence and causing the death of a person through use of a firearm.Jon Kamp & Scott Calvert, Federal Charges Are Filed Against Accused Fort Lauderdale Airport Gunman, Wall Street Journal (January 7, 2017). A federal public defender was appointed for Santiago since he was unable to pay for a lawyer. He was ordered detained without bond, and was indicted on 22 federal charges on January 26. He pleaded not guilty to all the charges during a court hearing on January 30, 2017. After his arrest, Santiago was diagnosed with schizophrenia as well as schizoaffective disorder. He initially refused to take psychotropic medication, but later took medications, and his mental condition showed marked improvement.Curt Anderson, Alaska man pleads guilty in Florida airport shooting, Associated Press (May 27, 2018).

LEDA 1000714 is one of a very rare group of galaxies called Hoag-type galaxies, named after the prototype, Hoag's Object ‚Äì it is estimated that roughly 0.1% of all galaxies are this type. LEDA 1000714 is unusual because it is a Hoag-type galaxy with two nearly round rings, but with different characteristics. It has been nicknamed Bur√ßin's Galaxy, after Bur√ßin Mutlu-Pakdil, the leader of the photometric study of this galaxy. Structure The structure and photometry of LEDA 1000714 was studied with significant detail in 2017. The core of the galaxy appears to be similar to an elliptical galaxy, and is almost perfectly round, not flattened into a disk. Unlike some ring galaxies, the central core shows no signs of a bar structure connecting the outer ring to the center of the galaxy. This is similar to Hoag's Object, and a number of other galaxies have been found that have a perfectly round center. The outer galaxy is relatively bright and contains many luminous stars indicative of star formation. However, upon further inspection of the galaxy, it was found that inside the outer ring there is also a faint, diffuse, red inner ring closer to the core. The outer ring appears to be fairly young, at about 0.13 billion years old, while the core is much older, at 5.5 billion years old. The age of the inner ring is, as yet, undetermined. This makes the galaxy even more unusual, possibly making it one of a kind. The details of the formation of Hoag-type objects are still largely unknown. It has been suggested that the near-perfect core of Hoag's Object formed from a sort of \\"bar instability\\" where the central bar structure decays into a rounder core. It may also be due to another galaxy. In the case of LEDA 1000714, because its two rings have significantly different ages, the galaxy's morphology may have come from an anomalous collision with another galaxy, however more data is needed to draw conclusions.

He worked in both engraving and etching and many of his works are based on designs by Francesco Primaticcio, \\"rendered boldly and freely\\".Grivel Others use designs by Luca Penni and other artists. It is thought that there was a workshop at the Palace of Fontainebleau itself in the 1540s, where he was one of the leading printmakers. Their main purpose seems to have been to record the new style being forged at Fontainebleau, copying both the main subject paintings and the elaborate ornamental stuccos and other decorations. Nymph mutilating a Satyr With a couple of exceptions his prints are signed only with \\"L.D.\\", and his identity was long uncertain; he is known as the Master L.D. in older literature. Lists of his works have attributed between 98 (Henri Zerner) and 226 (F. Herbet) prints to him.Grivel; Boorsch, 469. These say Herbet's list included 221 and 226 prints respectively. Life Hunting Scene, perhaps Death of Acteon. Signed \\"Bologna\\", for Primaticcio. Very little is known about his life; his dated prints run between 1540 and 1556,Boorsch, 469 when he left a series incomplete, which may indicate his death.Grivel There is no evidence that he trained as a painter, and like many early engravers he may have been trained as a goldsmith, a trade where engraving was still important. His engravings, which are presumed to be his earliest works, show a considerable fluency in this difficult technique.Boorsch, 249; Reed, 31 According to Henri Zerner, he may have produced about 9 early prints before moving to Fontainebleau, and he may only have started etching, rather than engraving, in about 1540.Boorsch, 469 Others see him as only beginning to make engravings in 1540, when his first dated print appears, and etchings from about 1543‚Äì1544.Grivel; Boorsch, 83; Reed, 29 Once the switch had been made, he only made etchings.Boorsch, 249 He was perhaps taught etching by Antonio Fantuzzi, one of the Italians at Fontainebleau, and in turn seems to have passed some of his experience of techniques in engraving on to him.Reed, 29‚Äì31 Apart from Penni and Primaticcio, who he knew, he made prints after drawings brought from Italy, presumably by Primaticcio, by Giulio Romano and Parmigianino, but not Rosso Fiorentino, unlike Fantuzzi and \\"Master I‚ôÄV\\".Boorsch, 81‚Äì82 (see Table 1), 86 In about 1546 he seems to have left France, perhaps in the company of Luca Penni, as a number of prints dated 1546 or 1547 are based on designs by Penni, and printed on paper from Germany (as it then was). These also use black ink and \\"the printing has a hard, professional look\\".Boorsch, 88, 469 He produced some of the illustrations for Les Quatre Premiers Livres des navigations et p√©r√©grinations orientales by the geographer and valet de chambre Nicolas de Nicolay, published in Lyon in 1548. Henri Zerner only attributed 3 of the illustrations to him, while Herbet gives him 61.Grivel; Boorsch, 89 Diana at Rest, after 1547, etching after Primaticcio. In the 1550s Davent was in Paris, again using Penni's designs. As \\"Lion Davant\\" he signed a contract in 1555 to produce illustrations for a book called Livre de la diversit√©e des habits du Levant (\\"Book of the different costumes of the Levant\\"), again by de Nicolay. Davent's latest print for the book is dated 1556, but the published book only contains 61 plates, rather than the 80 in the contract.Grivel The publication of this contract by Catherine Grodecki in 1974 ended the discussion over the identity of \\"Master L.D.\\"; there had been a number of other suggestions, in particular L√©onard Thiry. He also worked closely with Antonio Fantuzzi,Benezit and did etch a number of designs by Thirly.Boorsch, 265 In the contract of November 1555 he was recorded as living on the Rue Saint-Jacques.Boorsch, 89; Reed, 29 The Fontainebleau workshop Although there is no certain proof, most scholars have agreed that there was a printmaking workshop at the Palace of Fontainebleau itself, reproducing the designs of the artists for their works in the palace, as well as other compositions they produced. The most productive printmakers were Davent, Fantuzzi, and Jean Mignon, followed by the \\"mysterious\\" artist known from his monogram as \\"Master I‚ôÄV\\" (‚ôÄ being the alchemical symbol for copper, from which the printing plates were made),Boorsch, 80‚Äì83 and the workshop seems to have been active between about 1542 and 1548 at the latest; Fran√ßois I of France died in March 1547, after which funding for the palace ended, and the school dispersed. These were the first etchings made in France, and not far behind the first Italian uses of the technique, which originated in Germany.Boorsch, 80‚Äì81; Landau, 308‚Äì309 The earliest impressions of all the Fontainebleau prints are in brown ink, and their intention seems to have been essentially reproductive.Boorsch, 80‚Äì81 The intention of the workshop was to disseminate the new style developing at the palace more widely, both to France and to the Italians' peers back in Italy. Whether the initiative to do this came from the king or another patron, or from the artists alone, is unclear. David Landau believes that Primaticcio was the driving force;Boorsch, 95; Landau, 309 he had stepped up to become the director of the work at Fontainebleau after the suicide of Rosso Fiorentino in 1540.Boorsch, 79 Cadmus fighting the Dragon, after Primaticcio The enterprise seems to have been \\"just slightly premature\\" in terms of catching a market. The etched prints were often marked by signs of the workshop's inexperience and sometimes incompetence with the technique of etching, and according to Sue Welsh Reed: \\"Few impressions survive from these plates, and it is questionable whether many were pulled. The plates were often poorly executed and not well printed; they were often scratched or not well polished and did not wipe clean. Some may have been made of metals soft as copper, such as pewter.\\"Reed, 27 A broadening market for prints preferred the \\"highly finished textures\\" of Nicolas Beatrizet, and later \\"proficient but ultimately uninspired\\" engravers such as Ren√© Boyvin and Pierre Milan.Landau, 309 Works, style and technique David Landau describes one of his etchings (Female Nude Standing, see gallery) as representing \\"the imaginative recording of new artistic expression\\" in an \\"experimental etching ... full of adventurous lighting devices and daring chiaroscuro, but also defaced by the spots of foul biting and incompetent printing\\".Landau, 309 Cadmus fighting the Dragon is a large (9 13/16 in. √ó 12 in. (25 √ó 30.5 cm) with small margins) and highly finished etching, to a design by Primaticcio, that is one of his most highly regarded prints. According to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, it \\"provides an excellent example of Davent's preference for an all-over gray tone, from which a few lighter areas stand out, giving subtle relief to the forms. This is achieved firstly by covering almost the entire surface of the plate, including the sky, with a close-knit web of lines. Davent also left most of the plate rough‚Äîor even, in the case of this print, deliberately roughened it‚Äîso that it would hold a film of ink. Only a few areas are polished smooth, hold little ink, and read as highlights\\".\\"Cadmus fighting the Dragon\\", Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History, Metropolitan Museum of Art \\"Alexander the Great and Campaspe sitting on a couch and posing for Apelles standing in the foreground in front of his easel\\", c.1541/45. After Primaticcio, height 375 mm, width 260 mm. The obscurity of the subject is very typical of the School of Fontainebleau, and at times Jason, Theseus and Hercules have all been proposed as the hero, but it fits much better with the story of Cadmus, the legendary founder of Thebes, as told by Ovid. It seems to form part of a cycle of five prints on the story of Cadmus, the others by Fantuzzi, Master I‚ôÄV, and two unidentified hands.Boorsch, 250‚Äì251; Reed, 31 Davent did three etchings in vertical oval format after the cycle of frescos in the bedroom of Francois I's mistress, the Duchess of √âtampes (1508‚Äì1580), from which a total of eleven compositions surviving today are known. The cycle showed the life of Alexander the Great, but with little emphasis on his military career. Some survive in situ, though heavily repainted and perhaps moved within the room, which was remodelled more than once, and is now part of the \\"King's Staircase\\". Others survive in prints and drawings; the subject with the story of Alexander, Apelles and Campaspe was also etched by Master I‚ôÄV, and is recorded in a preparatory drawing at Chatsworth House. The oval paintings were set in much larger stucco frames, with a standing female nude to either side and much else besides; several of these survive.Boorsch, 256‚Äì257, 268‚Äì269; version by Master I‚ôÄV, at the British Museum; Photo of one of the frames An etching of Michelangelo at the Age of Twenty-Three (see gallery) is \\"somewhat, but not altogether, surprising\\" as a subject in France some forty years after 1498, when Michelangelo was that age. It is identified by the inscription beneath, but is not signed by \\"L.D.\\", unlike most of Davent's prints. It is certainly not \\"an actual likeness, since the figure is not in the least individualized\\". Henri Zerner suggests \\"most tentatively\\" that 1498 was the date the sculptor signed the contract for his Piet√†, now in St. Peter's Basilica, Vatican City with the French ambassador in Rome, Cardinal Jean de Bilh√®res, who commissioned the work. A French audience might therefore regard this point in his life as especially significant.Boorsch, 264‚Äì265 ‚Äì this catalogue entry is by Henri Zerner File:Davent2 bm.jpgFemale Nude Standing, perhaps Venus.

He was one of the first investors at PayPal, and went on to work for PayPal founder Peter Thiel's hedge fund Clarium and his venture capital company Founders Fund. His first book, A Generation of Sociopaths: How the Baby Boomers Betrayed America, was published by Hachette in 2017.  Career  Gibney started investing when his Stanford University roommate Ken Howery co-founded PayPal, the electronic payments company, and offered Gibney the chance to buy \\"friends and family\\" shares. After investing in PayPal, Gibney worked as a litigator but was soon hired by Peter Thiel after Thiel sold PayPal to eBay in 2002. Gibney worked at Thiel's hedge fund, Clarium, until 2008, making occasional private investments including in Palantir Technologies in 2005 and later in DeepMind, which was acquired by Google for around $450 million in 2014. He then moved to Founders Fund, a venture capital fund started by Thiel. Thiel and Founders Fund were the earliest outside investors in Facebook, SpaceX, and Palantir, and made other investments including in AirBnB, Lyft, Spotify, and Stemcentrx, which AbbVie acquired for $10 billion a few years after Founders Fund's investment. Gibney wrote Founders Fund's controversial statement of ideology, What Happened to the Future?, in 2011, which called for more aggressive investments in breakthrough technologies and became a widely cited article in the technology community. He also wrote other articles about start-ups and technology and lectured on these subjects, as well as Silicon Valley‚Äôs \\"libertarian problem\\". Gibney left Founders Fund in December 2012. He continued to make personal investments, though he made few since 2015, stating in a January 2016 speech in Zurich that he believes start-ups are richly valued and expressing concern that too many start-ups are remaining private for too long, creating misalignment of incentives between executives and employees and investors.  A Generation of Sociopaths  Gibney's first book, A Generation of Sociopaths: How the Baby Boomers Betrayed America, linked American stagnation to the baby boomers, characterizing the generation as being unusually prone to anti-social personality disorder, which Gibney believes unraveled the pro-social, pro-growth policies of mid-20th-century America. In her review for The Guardian, Pulitzer Prize for Fiction‚Äìwinning novelist Jane Smiley praised Gibney's \\"wry, amusing style\\", noting that \\"he is at his best analysing the financial details of the various forms of national and environmental debt that our children and grandchildren will eventually have to pay.\\" She concluded that \\"Gibney does convince me that those of us born between 1940 and 1965 (his definition) are a drag on the future.\\" In her summer book list review for the Financial Times, Merryn Somerset Webb called A Generation of Sociopaths \\"convincing stuff. Look around you in the UK and you will see hints of the same thing: our own boomers aren't rushing to give up any of their goodies for the young. Anyone in any doubt need only ask a dinner party of them how they feel about capital gains tax on primary residences or worse, asking pensioners to help finance their own medical care by paying national insurance.\\" In his review in The Washington Post, Dana Milbank wrote that although Gibney overstated his case concerning the Boomers, \\"The core of Gibney's argument, that the boomers are guilty of 'generational plunder,' is spot-on.\\" Booklist described the book as \\"informative, provocative, and entertaining\\" in its review. Kirkus Reviews called the book an \\"endless, broadest-possible-brush harangue\\" that has \\"some points, all of which would have been better made without assigning damning agency to them: of course health care has to be restructured, and of course taxes have to be raised if the nation is to escape insolvency.

Central Station Square) is a public square in Aarhus, Denmark, situated in the Indre By neighborhood. Baneg√•rdsplads is where arrivals from the Aarhus Central Station enters the city and it functions as a central junction for the streets Baneg√•rdsgade, Ny Baneg√•rdsgade, M.P. Bruuns Gade, Park All√© and Ryesgade.  History  Baneg√•rdsplads has been reformed and renovated a number of times and the current setup is the 3rd version. The reason for the many changes is that the square has been altered every time a new central station has been built or expanded. The last major overhaul occurred in the 1920s when the area around it was developed following a unified urban planning design by city engineer Oscar J√∏rgensen and architect Axel H√∏eg-Hansen. The pair won an architectural competition in 1920 issued by the city council. The central station was finished in 1929 and at that time the construction of buildings in the surrounding areas had begun. Baneg√•rdsplads has long been a transportation hub in the city. The first four tram lines in the city started here and later it, along with Park All√©, became the central hub for buses. Today the square is the junction for several major streets and contains a parking area for taxis.  Architecture  Baneg√•rdsplads is lined with neoclassical structures in yellow brick The buildings surrounding the square were designed to complement the neoclassical central station constructed between 1926 and 1929. The square is delimited at the east and west ends by large buildings and corners projected forward while the square continues more freely northwards toward Park All√© which today functions as a portal to the City Hall constructed in 1938-41. The buildings around the square have the same heights and are constructed of the same building materials, sand colored yellow bricks with sandstone used for accentuation. Apart from the hip roof of the central station all buildings have mansard roofs with rounded dormers. The first buildings on the north side of S√∏nder All√© came to inform the entire construction project; the windows are framed in ashlar and the parapets are formed with brick patterns. The buildings on Park All√© has a strong vertical expression with massive loggia- inspired porches pushed forwards from the main buildings which function as a counterweight to the length of the block. The ground floor is accentuated with horizontal brick patterns, almost a reversed shadow joint, to underline to solid character of the buildings. On Baneg√•rdspladsen the vertical expression is different with brick columns around the main entrances which is also seen in the older Regina complex. The windows are framed in narrow lesenes and the cornices of sandstone are carried by corbels.

Cir. 2014), is a 2014 decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit rejecting a patent for a cloned sheep known as \\"Dolly the Sheep\\"‚Äî the first mammal ever cloned from an adult somatic cell.750 F.3d at 1334. Background Dolly \\"the world's most famous sheep\\" Dolly was cloned in 1996 by Ian Wilmut, Keith Campbell and colleagues at the Roslin Institute, part of the University of Edinburgh Scotland.Is Dolly old before her time?, (May 27, 1999); Sally Lehrman, No More Cloning Around, (Sept. 21, 2008). The cloning method Campbell and Wilmut used to create Dolly constituted a breakthrough in scientific discovery. Known as somatic cell nuclear transfer, this process involves removing the nucleus of a regular body cell and implanting that nucleus into an egg cell that has had its cell nucleus removed. A nucleus is the organelle that holds a cell's genetic material (its DNA). Campbell and Wilmut found that if the donor, somatic cell is arrested in the stage of the cell cycle where it is dormant and non-replicating (the quiescent phase) prior to nuclear transfer, the resulting fused cell will develop into an embryo. The resulting cloned animal is an exact genetic replica of the adult mammal from which the somatic cell nucleus was taken.750 F.3d at 1334. The patent application claims the cloned animal. Claim 155 is representative: : 155\\\\. A live-born clone of a pre-existing, non-embryonic, donor mammal, wherein the mammal is selected from cattle, sheep, pigs, and goats. The Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) rejected the claims as patent ineligible under 35 U.S.C. ¬ß 101 \\"because it constituted a natural phenomenon that did not possess 'markedly different characteristics than any found in nature.' \\" A patent on the method was allowed, but it is not involved in this case.750 F.3d at 1334-35. Ruling by Federal Circuit The Federal Circuit unanimously affirmed the PTO rejection of the claims in opinion by Judge Timothy Dyk joined by Judges Kimberly Ann Moore and Eli Wallach. It is \\"clear that naturally occurring organisms are not patentable.\\"750 F.3d at 1336 (citing , and . The patent in Chakrabarty claimed a genetically engineered bacterium that was capable of breaking down various components of crude oil. The patent applicant created this non-naturally occurring bacterium by adding four plasmids to a specific strain of bacteria. The Court held that the modified bacterium was patentable because it was \\"new\\" with \\"markedly different characteristics from any found in nature and one having the potential for significant utility.\\" Accordingly, discoveries that possess \\"markedly different characteristics from any found in nature\\" are eligible for patent protection, but any existing organism or newly discovered plant found in the wild is not patentable. Similarly in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc.,569 U.S._, 133 S. Ct. 2107 (2013). the Court held that claims on two naturally occurring, isolated genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2), which can be examined to determine whether a person is likely to develop breast cancer, were patent ineligible invalid under ¬ß 101, because the BRCA genes themselves were unpatentable products of nature.750 F.3d at 1336-37. It is not disputed that the donor sheep from which Dolly was cloned could not be patented, but Dolly is an exact copy of that unpatentable sheep. \\"Dolly's genetic identity to her donor parent renders her unpatentable.\\" An exact copy of a preexisting animal in not patent eligible. The court added that related Supreme Court rulings \\"reinforce this conclusion\\": > For example, Supreme Court decisions regarding the preemptive force of > federal patent law confirm that individuals are free to copy any > unpatentable article, such as a live farm animal, so long as they do not > infringe a patented method of copying. Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Stiffel Co. > clarified that a state may not \\"prohibit the copying of [an] article itself > or award damages for such copying\\" when that article is ineligible for > patent protection.See . In Sears, the question was whether the defendant, > Sears Roebuck & Co., could be held liable under state law for copying a lamp > design whose patent protection had expired. The Court explained that \\"when > the patent expires the monopoly created by it expires, too, and the right to > make the article‚Äîincluding the right to make it in precisely the shape it > carried when patented‚Äîpasses to the public.\\" The Court further clarified > that \\"[a]n unpatentable article, like an article on which the patent has > expired, is in the public domain and may be made and sold by whoever chooses > to do so.\\" Roslin's claimed clones are exact genetic copies of patent > ineligible subject matter. Accordingly, they are not eligible for patent > protection.750 F.3d at 1337. Roslin argued that \\"environmental factors\\" lead to differences in shape, size, color, and behavior, that result from aging and the interaction of the animal with its environment. But Roslin acknowledged that any differences came about or were produced \\"quite independently of any effort of the patentee.\\" As in the Funk case: \\"Their qualities are the work of nature. Those qualities are of course not patentable. For patents cannot issue for the discovery of the phenomena of nature.\\" Roslin also argued that its clones are distinguishable from their original donor mammals because of differences in mitochondrial DNA, which originates from the donor egg rather than the donor nucleus. But the claims do not describe clones that have markedly different characteristics from the donor animals of which they are copies. Finally, Roslin argued that its clones are patent eligible because \\"they are time-delayed versions of their donor mammals, and therefore different from their original mammals,\\" but that is always true of any copy of an original.750 F.3d at 1338. Commentary ‚óè Professor Dan Burk finds that \\"the Roslin opinion is hardly a model of coherent judicial reasoning, either on its own terms or with regard to the Supreme Court's subject matter jurisprudence to that point.\\" He insists that Dolly the cloned sheep was not something found in nature, because \\"genetically identical mammals are not what one finds in the wild.\\" Rather, \\"mammals such as sheep propagate via sexual recombination which typically renders them not genetically identical.\\" Furthermore, Dolly was born as an old sheep: > By virtue of inheriting a mature set of somatic cell chromosomes, rather > than the freshly recombined set of germ-line chromosomes that would > accompany natural conception, Dolly began life with shortened telomeres. > Thus, Dolly was in a genetic sense 'born old' and lived a shortened life as > a result. Burk argues that the proper test of patent eligibility for such a product as Dolly the sheep is whether the claim preempts field of the described subject matter, so that \\"fundamental concepts and materials, on which all inventors must draw, [are] caught up in patent claims.\\" He says that the Roslin patent would not \\"capture fundamental or basic science on which future invention will depend, or if it does so, there is no indication in the Roslin opinion that this informed the analysis of patentable subject matter.\\" According to Burk, the patent would not be preemptive because its covers only sheep or other mammals \\"produced by the cloning process, a limitation that constrains the patent to the specific and novel implementation disclosed by the applicant.\\"Dan Burk, Dolly and Alice, (Oct. 16, 2015). A later version is available at (Feb. 1, 2016). ‚óè Gene Quinn in IP Watchdog deplores the Roslin decision: > Another nail in the coffin of innovation and a functioning patent system all > because decision makers don't have enough guts to state the obvious. Being > able to create something that is identical to what nature creates is an > extraordinary achievement that should be celebrated, should be fostered and > incentivized, and should be awarded with a patent.Gene Quinn, Dolly the > Cloned Sheep Not Patentable in the U.S., (May 8, 2014). ‚óè Student author Miriam Swedlow argues that Roslin would not prevent the patenting of extinct animals, such as the dodo, passenger pigeon, or wooly mammoth, because the cloned animal would not be identical to a natural animal. Like the cDNA in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., large portions of the genome of an extinct animal would need to be guessed at and extrapolated from non-extinct animals, because the DNA recoverable from fossils is decayed. Therefore, the \\"re-created animal will not be an exact genetic copy of an animal that already exists and will have different structural characteristics than the original species.\\" They would therefore be comparable to artificial animals such as the Oncomouse, which was patented., issued Apr 12, 1988, to Harvard University. Moreover, the \\"fragile nature of extinct animal DNA allows for multiple avenues of differentiation\\" from the original, now-extinct animal, preempting none.Miriam R. Swedlow, The Woolly- Mammoth in the Room: The Patentability of Animals Brought Back from Extinction through Cloning and Genetic Engineering, 11 183 (2015).

She is the creator of a series of fitness ebooks titled Bikini Body Guides, and a meal-planning and workout app, Sweat with Kayla. In 2016, Sweat with Kayla generated more revenue than any other fitness app. In March 2016, Time named Itsines one of the 30 most influential people on the Internet, noting her success at leveraging social media to promote her brand. As of October 2016, Itsines had eight million followers on Facebook and 12.5 million on Instagram. In October 2016, Itsines and her partner, Tobi Pearce, were included in the BRW \\"Young Rich\\" list of the wealthiest Australians aged under 40 who had not inherited their money. Their fortune was reported at $46 million in 2016. Early life Itsines traces her interest in fitness to playing basketball and other sports.https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/life-kayla-itsines-most- influential-fitness-star-on-earth-million-instagram-following- blogger-a7964136.html She recalls being initially intimidated and overwhelmed by the gym, until a personal trainer encouraged her to \\"just start somewhere\\". Finding that she enjoyed how the workouts made her feel, she abandoned her original plans to become a beauty therapist graduating from the Australian Institute of Fitness at the age of 18 as a Master Trainer. Career Itsines found work at a women's gym in Adelaide. Itsines came to believe that most women seek three specific outcomes from training: smaller inner thighs, flatter abdomens, and more toned arms, while also being concerned about becoming too bulky. She also started training her sister's friends who wanted to improve their fitness so they could play Netball on their high school team, focusing on building core strength and powerful legs. She lectured them on nutrition, and asked them to take before-and-after photos of themselves to track their progress. Itsines' 12-year-old cousin suggested using Instagram as a way of organising the photos. Within a few months, Itsines gained thousands of followers and was receiving regular requests for advice and help. Her partner, Tobi Pearce, suggested that she compile her routines into ebooks that could be sold online. In March 2013, they founded the Bikini Body Training company with Itsines as director and Pearce as CEO. The following January, they published the first two Bikini Body Guides, with Itsines' workouts in one volume, and nutrition information from dieticians Julie Dundon and Anne Schneyder of Nutrition Professionals Australia in another. Itsines would later offer the guides via an affiliate program as well. By October, the guides had been downloaded over one million times. The BBG program is based on 28-minute high-intensity workouts to be completed three times per week. The workouts are built from a repertoire of 150 movements inspired by a variety of sports and other physical training. The meal plans originally provided as little as 1,200 calories per day, but were updated to provide 1,600 to 1,800. She describes the overall strategy as not being aimed at either weight loss or muscle gain, but rather, the creation of a particular look. The program is aimed primarily at women because Itsines feels she particularly understands women's health and fitness goals. In 2015, she embarked on a world tour, the \\"Kayla Itsines Bootcamp World Tour\\", leading free group fitness classes. The tour included Australia's capital cities, New York City, Los Angeles, and London. In February 2015, Itsines took legal action against another Adelaide-based personal trainer, Leanne Ratcliffe, and Ratcliffe's partner Harley Johnstone over comments they had posted on their YouTube channels. Ratcliffe, publishing under the pseudonym \\"Freelee the Banana Girl\\", had claimed that the BBG eating plan required users to starve themselves, and Johnstone, publishing as \\"Durianrider\\", claimed that Pearce used steroids. Itsines claimed the statements were defamatory. She obtained an injunction to prevent the further publication of the videos. When the complaint was heard in the Supreme Court of South Australia on 23 March, Judge Withers directed the case proceed to trial, but the matter was eventually settled out of court. In April 2015, Apple featured Itsines in an advertisement for the Apple Watch, demonstrating the heart-rate monitor feature of the product. In November 2016, Pan Macmillan published Itsines' first print book, The Bikini Body 28-Day Eating and Lifestyle Guide. In August 2017, she announced the upcoming publication of her second book, The Bikini Body Motivation & Habits Guide. Itsines credits her social media success to keeping the focus on her followers and their fitness journeys rather than on herself and her journey. Part of her social media strategy is to keep attention on the transformation of the body, and she therefore seldom posts photos of her face. She is also careful of how she is represented visually by other publications, turning down photo shoots that she finds inconsistent with her image. In a statement of her own values, she says she would never promote something in which she personally does not believe, pose provocatively or sexualise herself, or post advice that is relevant only to her own lifestyle. She is the only person who posts on her social media accounts. As of 2018, her wealth is observed as $63 million. Personal life Itsines is the daughter of Anna and Jim Itsines, both teachers. She has one younger sister, Leah, who is a personal trainer and food stylist. Itsines' family heritage is Greek, and she identifies herself as Greek. She credits many of her food choices to her Greek upbringing. Itsines met her fianc√©, Tobi Pearce, at a gym. They have lived together since 2012. In April 2018, they got engaged however announced their split on 21 August 2020. Itsines gave up drinking alcohol and hasn‚Äôt had a drink since at least 2012.

Through his marriage, he was a relative of the royal √Årp√°d dynasty. Family background Gregory III was born into the gens Monoszl√≥ around 1240 as the son of Gregory II, who functioned as isp√°n of Krass√≥ County in 1255. His mother was an unidentified noblewoman from the gens B≈ë, possibly the daughter of Ders. His grandfather was Thomas I, the Ban of Slavonia between 1228 and 1229. Gregory had two brothers, Egyed II, who served as Master of the treasury several times, and Peter, who functioned as Bishop of Transylvania from 1270 to 1307. Despite his direct royal kinship relations, Gregory's career was overshadowed by his elder brother, the more ambitious and capable Egyed. The three brothers supported each other in national politics and gradually distinguished themselves from the other branches of the Monoszl√≥ kindred. This intention also appeared in contemporary documents and charters, when their names were referred with the suffixes \\"de genere Thome bani\\" (\\"from Ban Thomas' kindred\\"), and later \\"de Filek\\", when the eldest one, Egyed was granted F√ºlek Castle (today Fiƒæakovo, Slovakia) by his lord, Duke Stephen. Gregory became a relative of the royal House of √Årp√°d, when he married an unidentified sister of Duke Stephen's consort, Elizabeth the Cuman. Elizabeth, and Gregory's wife most possibly were the daughters of Seyhan, a Cuman chieftain. The marriage of Gregory and the Cuman lady presumably occurred in the mid-1260s, as, according to a 1274 royal charter issued by Elizabeth's son, Ladislaus IV of Hungary, Elizabeth had previously donated the queenly estate of P√°ny (today Pa≈àovce, Slovakia) to her sister, which area then belonged to her husband, Stephen's realm, who, adopting the title of Junior King, forced his father, King B√©la IV of Hungary to cede all the lands of the Kingdom of Hungary to the east of the Danube to him. Later, in 1274, Ladislaus IV confiscated his aunt's estate in exchange for K√°r√°n, Somogy County, which laid near to the Monoszl√≥s' lands. Historian J√°nos Kar√°csonyi claimed, Elizabeth and her unidentified sister were the siblings of Bulgarian Despot Jacob Svetoslav, who rebelled against his father-in-law, Stephen's rule, and after the victorius Hungarian campaign in 1266, Egyed Monoszl√≥, who captured Tirnovo, took the Despot's sister to marry with his younger brother, Gregory as pledge of the peace. Career Belonging to his kinship, Gregory was unflinchingly loyal to Duke Stephen, who launched a civil war against his father, B√©la IV in 1264. However there is no source whether he actively participated battles or held any specific offices in Stephen's royal court. In 1269, Gregory was mentioned twice as Judge of the Cumans, becoming the first known person who held that dignity. Earlier archontological and historical works identified the office-holder with his father, Gregory II. However historian Attila Zsoldos argued the last mention of Gregory II is from 1256, and there is no record of him about his role in the 1260s civil war or any political relation with Duke Stephen. Contrary to him, as Zsoldos noted, Gregory III belonged to the court of his sister-in-law's husband, Duke Stephen, and had a Cuman wife. In the two documents, Gregory, as Judge of the Cumans ‚Äì after the conclusion of the war ‚Äì appeared before the elderly B√©la IV in the royal court to negotiate over Slavonian estate matters with his cousins, Thomas III and Stephen II, and a distant relative, Nicholas. After B√©la's death, Stephen V succeeded his father without difficulties and was crowned on or after 17 May 1270. Mojs, the newly-appointed Palatine of Hungary adopted the title Judge of the Cumans, merging the two dignities. In the same time, Gregory was made Master of the treasury for his sister-in-law, Queen Elizabeth (while his brother, Egyed held the same office in the royal court of Stephen V). Beside that, Gregory also became isp√°n of Vas County. In this capacity, Gregory had important role in the emerging armed conflict between Stephen V and Ottokar II of Bohemia. After Stephen's coronation, the closest advisors of the late B√©la, for instance Henry K≈ëszegi and Nicholas Geregye, following the new monarch's sister, Anna of Macs√≥, fled Hungary and handed over K≈ëszeg, Borosty√°nk≈ë (today Bernstein, Austria) and their other castles in Vas County, along the western borders to Ottokar II. Then Stephen V launched a plundering raid into Styria around December 1270. Gregory was one of the commanders of the royal army against the Bohemian king. In the next year, Nicholas Geregye returned Hungary and swore loyalty to Stephen after the Peace of Pressburg, which signed on 2 July 1271. Though Ottokar renounced its claims on territories conquered in Hungary, the K≈ëszegis, strengthening with Bohemian and Styrian defenders, refused to give back their castles along the western border. As a result, Gregory led a royal army to successfully besiege and capture Henry K≈ëszegi's four castles in August 1271. The Ban of Slavonia, Joachim Gutkeled, turned against Stephen V and kidnapped his ten-year old son and heir, Ladislaus in the summer of 1272. Stephen besieged Joachim's fortress in Koprivnica, but could not free his son. The king soon fell ill and died on 6 August 1272, thus the Monoszl√≥ brothers lost their patron. Joachim Gutkeled departed for Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r as soon as he was informed of Stephen V's death, because he wanted to arrange Ladislaus' coronation. Gregory's sister-in-law, Dowager Queen Elizabeth joined him, infuriating Stephen V's partisans who accused her of having conspired against her husband. Gregory's brother, Egyed immediately laid siege in late August to Elizabeth's estate in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r to \\"rescue\\" Ladislaus from the rival baronial group's influence. However the military action ended in failure. Egyed and Gregory \\"fear of the Queen's revenge\\", fled to Pressburg (today Bratislava, Slovakia). They captured the castle and its surrounding areas and handed over to Ottokar II who provided shelter to them. Their Hungarian lands were confiscated following that by Queen Elizabeth in the name of his son. The Monoszl√≥ brothers were granted the Austrian castles of Laa, Stockerau, Korneuburg and Kreuzenstein by Ottokar, who also commissioned them to administrate Pressburg and the adjacent forts. Following the Bohemian invasion of Hungary in April 1273, Egyed and Gregory fled Prague for Hungary and swore loyalty to Ladislaus IV, thus received forgiveness from Elizabeth and the Monoszl√≥s' confiscated lands were regained (Gregory was granted K√°r√°n then). He was re-appointed isp√°n of Vas County, and simultaneously also served as head of Po≈æega County until 1273. In this capacity, he fought against Ottokar's troops at Gy≈ër. However the rival baronial group, dominated by the K≈ëszegi and the Gutkeled clans, regained its influence and, among others, Gregory was dismissed from his office. Both Egyed and Gregory lost all political influence for uncertain reasons after 1275, as they had never hold any dignities after that, despite the fact that their allies, the Cs√°k group was able to return to govern the realm even at the end of the year. They jointly owned √Ålmosd in Bihar County in 1291. Gregory died childless by 1294.

The so-called Basic Strategy, which was subsequently refined through the use of computers and combinatorial analysis, loses the least money to the casino in the long term. History In 1953, Roger Baldwin, a private in the U.S. Army with a master's degree in mathematics from Columbia University, stationed in Aberdeen Proving Ground, the U.S. Army's oldest active proving ground,Aberdeen Proving Ground , Army Alliance website was playing dealer's choice poker in the barracks. After a player acting as dealer selected Blackjack, someone remarked that the dealer, as they do in the Las Vegas casinos, would have to stand on 17 and hit on 16. Baldwin was intrigued by this news enough to embark on a project during his off-work hours to discover the optimal playing strategy for the player on the basis of the player's and the dealer's cards, as well as the rules dictating the dealer's play. For this, Baldwin asked the help of Wilbert Cantey, a sergeant at the facility, who had left the seminary because of his hustling at pool and cards and pursued a master's degree in Mathematics. They enlisted the help of privates Herbert Maisel, who later became a professor at Georgetown University, and James McDermott, who had a master's from Columbia University.

The book did include, in a chapter titled \\"Using the Exposed Cards to Improve Your Chances\\", the first valid card-counting system ever published, but their method was not strong enough to offer a positive-expectation strategy for the player, although it did offer the least costly strategy in the game of casino Blackjack.\\"Blackjack History: Baldwin, Cantey, Maisel and McDermott and the First Accurate Blackjack Basic Strategy\\" by Arnold Snyder, Blackjack Forum, 1997 A gambling expert has claimed that any player who uses the Four Horsemen's basic strategy today \\"would not be giving up more than a few hundredths of a percent [of expected value] over perfect basic strategy.\\" Legacy The four originators of Blackjack's Basic Strategy went on with their lives away from casinos and gambling, dedicating themselves to scientific research, teaching and business.\\"Aberdeen Four Horsemen made movie 21 possible\\" by Bill Ordine, The Baltimore Sun, 7 April 2008 But their work caused an immediate sensation in gambling research as well as among professional gamblers. MIT Professor of Mathematics Edward O.

Blackbelt in Blackjack : Playing 21 as a Martial Art; Cardoza; revised edition: 1 February 2005; 978-1580421430 After players began complaining, most casinos went back to the previous rules and conditions. The tables were soon full of casual gamblers who believed that by they could now \\"beat the house,\\" even though most of them never strictly followed Thorp's \\"complicated,\\" two- parallel-counts system, or even the simpler systems that subsequently appeared, such as High-Low, and the casinos started winning more money than before Thorp's book had appeared. Thorp's work in turn inspired the research and the exploits of professional blackjack players such as Stanford Wong, Ken Uston, and the MIT Blackjack Teams of the 1990s, as well as many others.

During the Ball's festivities, Stanford Wong commented: \\"Thorp never would have got there without the work of these guys. If Thorp never got there, I don't know that any of us would be here.

The stories for both episodes were developed by Patrick McHale, Kent Osborne, and Pendleton Ward. It originally aired on Cartoon Network on November 12, 2012. The episodes guest star Ron Perlman as the Lich, Kumail Nanjiani as Prismo, Ming-Na as Farmworld Finn's mother, Cloris Leachman as Farmworld Marceline, James Kyson as Big Destiny & Trami, Eric Bauza as Tromo, and Jeff Bennett as Choose Bruce. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Finn and Jake chase The Lich through a dimensional portal where they meet Prismo, a wish granter, who tells them that the Lich wished for the extinction of all life. This leads Finn to wish that the Lich had never existed. Finn is then transported to an alternate timeline, where he is a normal human living with his family and his dog, Jake, on a farm. In the alternate reality, Finn discovers a magical ice crown, which he attempts to use to repay his family's debt. After placing it on his head, he is magically imbued with power over ice and snow. Prismo tells Jake that if he can change The Lich's original wish, everything will go back to normal. Jake‚Äîwith help from Prismo‚Äîeventually wishes that the Lich had actually desired for Finn and Jake to return home. Thus, the world is righted again. Both \\"Finn the Human\\" and \\"Jake the Dog\\" are a continuation of the fourth season finale \\"The Lich\\". Because \\"Finn the Human\\" and \\"Jake the Dog\\" were being worked on by four separate storyboardists, they coordinated their ideas so that the resultant two products would work together. The resulting episodes were collectively watched by 3.435 million viewers and received critical acclaim, with writers from The A.V. Club and IndieWire applauding the episodes for being both an excellent season premiere, as well as being refreshing and creative. Plot =\\"Finn the Human\\"= In the fourth season finale \\"The Lich\\", Finn and Jake are tricked by the Lich‚Äîdisguised as the hero Billy‚Äîinto opening a portal to the multiverse by using the Enchiridion. After the Lich passes through, Finn and Jake give chase. They eventually reach a time room at the center of the multiverse that is inhabited by Prismo, a wish- granter. They arrive just in time to see the Lich vanish after making his wish for the extinction of all life. After a short conversation with Prismo, Finn wishes that the Lich had never existed and is promptly transported into the reality created by his wish. The scene then shifts to the art style featured in the end of \\"The Lich\\", as part of the wish-created realityknown as \\"Farmworld\\"in which Finn is a normal human living with his family and his dog, Jake, on a farm. Picking up from the last scene from \\"The Lich\\", Finn is called by his mother and told to sell his beloved mule Bartram to pay off the family's debt to the Destiny Gang. While going to town to the sell the creature, Finn and Jake fall down an opening in the earth and discover the long-dead skeleton of Simon Petrikov. An aged and decrepit Marceline‚Äîwho never became a vampire‚Äîreveals herself and tells Finn that Simon gave his life stopping a mutagenic bomb from exploding by freezing it in ice. She tells them that she has been guarding Simon's body, and the ice crown, ever since his demise so that no one is ever harmed from the crown's power. Finn manages to steal the crown, hoping to sell it instead of Bartram. In town, however, the Destiny Gang steal the crown as well as Bartram. Finn, furious, riles up the town, who begin to riot, as they are sick of being abused by the Destiny Gang. Finn goes to the Destiny Gang's mansion to confront their leader, Big Destiny. Once there, Big Destiny returns the crown, noting that it is the last possession that he will ever own. Finn looks out the window and sees that the gang is burning the city. Finn races to his home, taking Marceline with him. When he arrives at his house, the gang has already set it on fire with his parents and infant sibling trapped upstairs. Finn asks Marceline if the crown is magic and she tells him it is very dangerous magic. He then puts the crown on his head, and the power begins to flow through him. =\\"Jake the Dog\\"= After putting on the crown, Finn becomes corrupted by its power, going mad. He attacks the Destiny Gang‚Äîwho his family owed a debt as established in the previous episode‚Äîand put out the fires that they started, but his uncontrolled power causes the mutagenic bomb that Simon stopped to explode, destroying the surrounding area. Jake, however, falls into a mutagenic puddle and is mutated into a creature similar to the Lich, which attacks Finn. In the Time Room, Prismo explains to Jake about Finn being transported to a separate, altered world based on his wish that The Lich never existed. Together, they watch the events in Finn's world on Prismo's television, and Prismo asks Jake what he would like to wish for. Jake wishes for a sandwich, but Prismo urges him to consider using his wish on something important, such as helping Finn. Jake tells Prismo he will use it when he knows Finn will be in real danger, and after a conversation, the two decide to hang out; Prismo mutes the TV and the two begin to ignore the events happening in Finn's timeline. Eventually, the Cosmic Owl joins Prismo and Jake, and the two chat in a hot tub. While reaching for chips, the Cosmic Owl unmutes the TV, and Jake realizes that Finn is in trouble. Prismo explains that Jake can still save Finn by using his wish, but reveals that his wish must be very specific, as Prismo's wishes have a tendency to have a monkey's paw‚Äîan ironic twist‚Äîconnected to them. After coaching by Prismo, Jake wishes that the Lich's original wish had been for Finn and Jake to return home. Prismo grants the wish, and Finn and Jake are indeed transported back to Ooo. Finn has no recollection of his time in the alternate reality, but Jake does. Production \\"Finn the Human\\" was written and storyboarded by Jesse Moynihan and Tom Herpich, whereas \\"Jake the Dog\\" was written and storyboarded by Rebecca Sugar and Cole Sanchez. The stories for both episodes were developed by Patrick McHale, Kent Osborne, Pendleton Ward. The two episodes were directed by Larry Leichliter, with Nick Jennings serving as the show's art director. Nate Cash served as the supervising director for \\"Finn the Human\\" and Adam Muto served as supervising director for \\"Jake the Dog\\". Despite \\"Finn the Human\\" being officially storyboarded by Moynihan & Herpich, and \\"Jake the Dog\\" being officially storyboarded Cole Sanchez & Rebecca Sugar, the four writers and storyboarders collaborated amongst themselves. For instance, the majority of the scenes with Prismo were created by Sanchez and Herpich, whereas \\"Finn going insane\\" was the product of Sugar. The two episodes guest star Ron Perlman as the Lich, Kumail Nanjiani as Prismo, Ming-Na Wen as Farmworld Finn's mother, Cloris Leachman as Farmworld Marceline, James Kyson as Big Destiny & Trami, Eric Bauza as Tromo, and Jeff Bennett as Choose Bruce. Kyson and Bauza's characters, the Destiny Gang, were designed to not \\"really fit in the Adventure Time world\\". Moynihan designed the characters, basing their look at least partially on characters from the Japanese manga series Fist of the North Star. On his website, he expressed his fear that their appearance would be \\"a little bit jarring\\", but he was not dissuaded from trying it. The music for these episodes was composed by Tim Kiefer. To create the song \\"Prismatic\\", Kiefer took the song \\"Lil' Booty Dance\\", first heard in the second season episode \\"Mortal Recoil\\" and remixed it so that it would fit with the theme of \\"inter-dimensional travel\\" present in the episode. Kiefer explained, \\"I threw my own music from the Season 2 finale 'Mortal Folly / Mortal Recoil' on my turntables and went wild ‚Äì pitching, reversing, rewinding, scratching and more ‚Äì transforming Jake‚Äôs 'Lil‚Äô Booty Dance' bongo song into a booming, merry-go-round dance celebration.\\" Reception \\"Finn the Human\\" and \\"Jake the Dog\\" first aired on Cartoon Network on November 12, 2012. The episodes were collectively watched by 3.435 million viewers, and scored a 0.7 percent in the 18‚Äì49 demographic Nielsen household rating. Nielsen ratings are audience measurement systems that determine the audience size and composition of television programming in the United States, which means that the episodes were seen by 0.7 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the airing. The episodes first saw physical release as part of the 2014 Finn the Human DVD, which included 16 episodes from the series' third, fourth, fifth, and sixth seasons. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club awarded the two episodes an \\"A‚àí\\". He noted that, together, both episodes come together to make \\"a dense premi√®re that evokes nearly all aspects of this series.\\" He was appreciative of the fact that \\"Finn the Human\\" was \\"an action-packed, mythology-heavy chapter\\" and a \\"nice change of pace\\". Likewise, he wrote that \\"Jake the Dog\\" focused \\"on humor and relationships\\", and had various \\"irreverent silly note[s]\\" that helped balance the episode's more serious story line. Eric Kohn of IndieWire praised the episodes for being \\"irreverent and narratively engaging\\". He called the collective episodes \\"the ideal testament to animation's glorious pliability in an commercial arena otherwise defined by restrictions.\\" Kohn felt that the show's exploration of \\"sad subtext\\"‚Äîsuch as the series' mysterious Mushroom War and the relationship between Marceline and the Ice King‚Äîand the characters' abilities to \\"deny the bad vibes their surrounding world invites\\" via \\"cheery songs and vibrant artwork\\" were some of the series strongest points. Finally, he praised the exploration of the multiverse and its impact on the show, noting that it was an \\"interesting creative challenge\\".

The CSB incorporates advances in biblical scholarship to improve upon translation decisions, word choice, and style. It also removes some of the novel features of the HCSB, such as consistently translating the tetragrammaton as \\"Lord\\" rather than \\"Yahweh\\" and using \\"brothers and sisters\\" for the plural term \\"brothers\\" in Greek.Strauss, M.L. A Review of the Christian Standard Bible. Theomelios 44:2. Retrieved 12/16/2019: https://themelios.thegospelcoalition.org/article/a-review-of-the-christian- standard-bible/ The HCSB was translated by an international team of 100 scholars from 17 denominations. The HCSB New Testament was released in 1999, and the entire translation was released in 2004. Work on the CSB revision was undertaken by the Translation and Review Team, a trans-denominational group of 21 conservative Evangelical Christian biblical scholars. Backgrounds represented include Southern Baptist, Lutheran, Presbyterian, conservative Anglican, and non-denominational Evangelical churches. Ongoing translation decisions are governed by the ten member CSB Translation Oversight Committee, co-chaired by Dr. Thomas R. Schreiner and Dr. David L. Allen. Translation philosophy The CSB (and original HCSB) translators used a methodology they termed \\"Optimal Equivalence.\\" Optimal Equivalence draws from both formal and dynamic translation philosophies, balancing contemporary English readability with linguistic precision to the original languages. Based upon criteria from a quantitative linguistic comparison of eight popular English Bible translations, the CSB was found to hold the most optimal balance of Readable vs. Literal scores. Textual basis The CSB Translation and Review Team used the latest available Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic texts. The Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia 5th Edition (BHS5) was used for the Old Testament and the Novum Testamentum Graece 28th Edition (NA28) and United Bible Societies 5th Edition (UBS5) was used for the New Testament (the HCSB used BHS4 and NA27/UBS4).

Sheehan studied art history and fine arts at U.C. Berkeley and completed his MFA at the Tyler School of Art in Philadelphia, and in Rome, Italy. He moved to New York City in 1994. When working in miniature, Sheehan is intentionally playing with scale, depicting world events and the mundane with equal magnitude. His paintings are often no more than stamp sized and \\"reconfigure public events (often public fictions or lies) in terms of their visual organization (which, scaled down, seen from odd and unintended angles, are revealed as well-organized fakes).\\" When exhibited, they are frequently set into the wall of the gallery space to create a keyhole effect and magnifying glasses are provided for viewing. Sheehan also produces large scale works, including collage and mixed-media. Sheehan has been the recipient of many grants, awards and residencies including the New York Foundation for the Arts, ARCUS Residency in Japan, Lower Manhattan Cultural Council Residency in the World Trade Center, the Pollock-Krasner, and Marie Walsh Sharpe Foundation Grant.

It is one of six native Japanese cattle breeds, and one of the four Japanese breeds known as wagy≈´, the others being the Japanese Black, the Japanese Brown and the Japanese Polled. All wagy≈´ cattle derive from cross- breeding in the early twentieth century of native Japanese cattle with imported stock, mostly from Europe. In the case of the Japanese Shorthorn, the principal foreign influence was from the Shorthorn, with some contribution from the Ayrshire and Devon breeds.  History  Cattle were brought to Japan from China at the same time as the cultivation of rice, in about the second century AD, in the Yayoi period. Until about the time of the Meiji Restoration in 1868, they were used only as draught animals, in agriculture, forestry, mining and for transport, and as a source of fertiliser. Milk consumption was unknown, and ‚Äì for cultural and religious reasons ‚Äì meat was not eaten. Cattle were highly prized and valuable, too expensive for a poor farmer to buy. Japan was effectively isolated from the rest of the world from 1635 until 1854; there was no possibility of intromission of foreign genes to the cattle population during this time. Between 1868, the year of the Meiji Restoration, and 1887, some 2600 foreign cattle were imported. At first there was little interest in cross-breeding these with native stock, but from about 1900 it became widespread. It ceased abruptly in 1910, when it was realised that, while the cross-breeds might be larger and have better dairy qualities, their working capacity and meat quality was lower. From 1919, the various heterogeneous regional populations that resulted from this brief period of cross-breeding were registered and selected as \\"Improved Japanese Cattle\\". Four separate strains were characterised, based mainly on which type of foreign cattle had most influenced the hybrids, and were recognised as breeds in 1944. These were the four wagy≈´ breeds, the Japanese Shorthorn, the Japanese Black, the Japanese Brown and the Japanese Polled. The Japanese Shorthorn developed in the northernmost part of Honshu, in the prefectures of Akita, Aomori and Iwate. In Aomori and Iwate, the only foreign influence was from British Shorthorn cattle, while in Akita Prefecture there was also some admixture of Ayrshire and Devon, also British breeds. The Japanese Shorthorn is distributed in northern Honshu, and also in Hokkaido. It was listed by the FAO as \\"not at risk\\" in 2007. In 2008 the total population was reported to be about 4500. The Japanese Shorthorn constitutes about 1.2% of the beef cattle herd of Japan.  Characteristics  The coat of the Japanese Shorthorn may be red, roan, or red-pied; both sexes are horned.  Use  The Japanese Shorthorn is raised only for beef. The meat has less marbling than that of the Japanese Black, and so commands a lower market price.

He played 48 first-class matches for New South Wales between seasons 1888/89 and 1906/07. In the Sydney grade competition he is most well known for having played for the Paddington and Waverley clubs. Early life Alexander Cecil Knox Mackenzie was the eldest child of Nicholas James and Mary Ann (n√©e Robinson) Mackenzie, and was born on 7 August 1870 at his parents residence located at 9 Queen Street in The Rocks, Sydney. He first attended Crown Street Public School and was later part of the first enrolment of students to Sydney Boys High School in 1883. Junior club cricket Alick's first season of competitive club cricket was the 1885/86 season in which he played for the Winchester club. Despite it being his first season of cricket, he won the award for the highest batting average in the team. The following season, 1886/87 he played for the Mansfield club. In his last season of junior cricket, 1887/88, he played for the Verona cricket club, during which he made a top score of 206 not out. Senior club cricket Alick Mackenzie joined the newly formed Sydney Cricket Club for the 1888/89 season. He would play with the club for five seasons before the introduction of the electorate club system in 1893. Sydney Grade Cricket When the Sydney Grade Cricket competition was formed in 1893 he played for the Paddington club due to the fact he resided in that suburb. During his time at Paddington he was a teammate of Australian Test stars Victor Trumper and Monty Noble. Two of Alick's younger brothers also played alongside him for Paddington in this period. Alick won two premierships with Paddington in seasons 1894/95 and 1897/98. left left After the 1899/00 season Alick moved to the Waverley club as he was now living within their residential boundaries. He would play for the Waverely club until his retirement at the conclusion of the 1909/10 season. Alick captained Waverley to a premiership in season 1902/03. During his grade cricket career Alick was twice the leading run scorer for the season. He achieved this feat first during the 1895/96 season while playing for Paddington when he scored 565 run at an average of 51.36. The second occasion was during his time with Waverley in the 1902/03 season when he scored 626 runs at 62.6. He also achieved the highest batting average that season. First-class cricket Alick was first selected to play for New South Wales as an 18 year old in December 1888 when he was selected to play for NSW against an Australian XI. He performed well on debut, his score of 34 being amongst the best of the NSW batsman and made against Australia's best bowlers of the day. Alick would play for NSW on a regular basis from that point until season 1902/03. He played only one more game for NSW after that season, which came in season 1906/07 when he appeared for NSW against Western Australia in Perth. The highlight of Alick‚Äôs first class career came during the 1897/98 season when he scored his only first class century (130) playing for New South Wales in a match against the touring England side. Alick retired at the conclusion of the 1909/10 season. As a reward for his services to the game he was named as manager of the Australian side that toured New Zealand from February to April 1910.  H.V. Hordern and the Googly  Portrait of Alick Mackenzie c.1905 Alick Mackenzie was a contemporary of H. V. Hordern who is well known as the first Australian cricketer to develop the ability to bowl the googly (wrong 'un) delivery. The googly is a delivery bowled by a leg spin bowler in a normal manner, but which turns in the opposite direction to a normal leg-break. The delivery was originally developed by English cricketer Bernard Bosanquet in the early 1900s while he was a student at Oxford University and he used it to great effect against Australia's batsman on England's tour of Australia in 1903/04. After witnessing Bosanquet bowl the googly, Hordern committed to teaching himself how to bowl it. Prior to the commencement of the 1905/06 season Hordern asked Alick to join him at the Sydney Cricket Ground so that he could practice bowling the new delivery. The first two deliveries that he bowled were full tosses and promptly hit to the boundary by Mackenzie. The third landed on the pitch, spun, beat the bat and clean bowled the batsman. It was after this occurrence that Hordern begun using the googly in first-class matches.  Personal life  On 19 May 1900 Alick married Jessie Maud Phelps. They had four children. After leaving school, Alick entered employment as a clerk with the New South Wales Department of Audit. He would remain with the department until his retirement in the 1930s.  Life after cricket  After his cricket career finished in 1910, Alick took up the sport of competitive lawn bowls.

More specifically reverse weathering refers to the formation of authigenic clay minerals from the reaction of 1) biogenic silica with aqueous cations or cation bearing oxides or 2) cation poor precursor clays with dissolved cations or cation bearing oxides. Formation of cation abundant authigenic silicate clays is thought to occur through the following simplified reaction: > Biogenic opal (SiO2) + metal hydroxides (Al(OH)4‚àí) + dissolved cations (K+, > Mg2+, Li+, etc.) + bicarbonate (HCO3) ‚Üí clay minerals + H2O + CO2 The formation of authigenic clay minerals by reverse weathering is not fully understood. Much of the research done has been conducted in localized areas, such as the Amazon delta, Mississippi delta, and in the Ethiopian Rift lakes, making a global understanding of the process difficult. Much of the driving force behind research into reverse weathering stems from constraining the chemical mass balance between rivers and oceans. Prior to the discovery of reverse weathering, the model of the chemical mass balance of the ocean predicted higher alkali metal and bicarbonate (HCO3‚àí) concentrations than was observed. The formation of authigenic clay minerals was initially thought to account for the entirety of this excess, but the discovery of hydrothermal vents challenged this, as removal of alkali-alkaline earth metals and HCO3‚àí from the ocean occurs in these locations as well.  Methods of analysis  The process and extent of reverse weathering has been inferred by several methods and proxies. In-situ measurements of biogenic silica and silicic acid (a product of weathering) have been used to analyze the rate and extent reverse weathering occurs within in an aquatic system. Uptake of biogenic silica as a result of reverse weathering would be observed as a relative low concentration of dissolved SiO2 compared to the overlying water. Laboratory observations of reverse weathering have been conducted using incubations and flow through reactors to measure opal dissolution rates The clay was studied using scanning electron microscopes, x-ray, and transmission electron microscopes. It was observed that the clay formed quickly, and using this amount of time and the known content of the sediment, concentration of potassium ions consumed by this process in rivers around the globe was estimated. Laboratory experiments can also include incubation experiments, in which sediment samples obtained from natural environments are enclosed in sealable containers with varied concentrations reverse weathering reactants (biogenic silica in the form of diatoms, cations, metals, etc.). 250x250px Using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) also provides concentration and isotopic information for cation and silica concentrations in pore water and digested sediment samples. Utilization of a multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS) is also used as a means of obtaining isotopic data of metals and silica in solution. Lithium isotope concentration within planktonic foraminifera has been used to infer past changes in silicate and reverse weathering rates over the last 68 million years. Removal of lithium from seawater is mainly dependent on its assimilation within marine sediments and variations are believed to be indicative of the relative rates of silicate weathering and reverse weathering, in addition to other factors. Foraminifera with low lithium content suggest that reverse weathering may have been more prominent during that time period.  Controls  = Thermodynamics = Formation of authigenic silicate clays through reverse weathering was shown to be thermodynamically favorable during studies of Amazon delta sediments. Primary controls on the formation of authigenic silicate clays are on the supply of reactants in solution. Areas of limited biogenic opal, metal hydroxides (e.g. aluminate (Al(OH)4‚àí)), or dissolved cations limit production of authigenic silicate clays. Metals, cations, and silica are largely supplied by the weathering of terrigenous materials, which influences the thermodynamic favorability of reverse weathering. = Kinetics = Kinetically, formation of clay minerals by reverse weathering can be relatively rapid (<1 year). Due to the short formation timescale, reverse weathering is seen as a reasonable contributor to various ocean biogeochemical cycles.  Influence on Global Cycles  Carbon Cycle = The Carbon Cycle = The process of creating authigenic clay minerals through reverse weathering releases carbon dioxide (CO2). However, release of bicarbonate by silicate weathering exceeds the quantities of CO2 produced by reverse weathering. Therefore, while reverse weathering does increase CO2 during production of authigenic clay minerals, it is overwhelmed by the concentration of HCO3‚àí in the system, and will not have a significant effect on local pH. Treguer et al., 1995 = The Silica Cycle = In recent years, the effect of reverse weathering on biogenic silica has been of great interest in quantifying the silica cycle. During weathering, dissolved silica is delivered to oceans through glacial runoff and riverine inputs. This dissolved silica is taken up by a multitude of marine organisms, such as diatoms, and is used to create protective shells. When these organisms die, they sink through the water column. Without active production of biogenic SiO2, the mineral begins diagenesis. Conversion of this dissolved silica into authigenic silicate clays through the process of reverse weathering constitutes a removal of 20-25% of silicon input. Reverse weathering is often found to occur in river deltas as these systems have high sediment accumulation rates and are observed to undergo rapid diagenesis. The formation of silicate clays removes reactive silica from the pore waters of sediment, increasing the concentration of silica found in the rocks that form in these locations. Silicate weathering also appears to be a dominant process in deeper methanogenic sediments, whereas reverse weathering is more common in surface sediments, but still occurs at a lower rate.  Locations of Study  250x250px = Deltas = In the Amazon river delta, about 90% of buried SiO2 is used up during reverse weathering, while the creation of potassium ions in this location is about 2.8 Œºmol g‚àí1 year‚àí1. Nearly 7-10% of the potassium input from the Amazon River is removed from the ocean by the formation of potassium-iron rich aluminosilicates. In the Mississippi river delta about 40% of SiO2 that is buried in the sediment is converted to authigenic aluminosilicates. The major difference in the two deltas is due to the sediments in the amazon delta being subject to a number of erosional and depositional processes, which creates an abundant amount of Fe oxides. Sediment typically resides in the region for 30 years on average, but the upper layer undergoes major physical reworking 1-2 times per year. Pore water data suggests that the formation of authigenic clays in the Amazon delta occur on the order of a few months to a few years. The limiting reactant of clay formation in this region is the quantity of available SiO2, since the river water generally has a high concentration of other reactants, such as iron, potassium, magnesium, and aluminum. Whereas in the Mississippi delta, the limiting nutrient for these reactions is Fe.Ethiopian Rift Valley Lakes = Ethiopian Rift Lakes = Reverse weathering in the Ethiopian Rift lakes is easily observable, and recent studies at this location have been used to make inference on the extent of the process in the ocean. One study suggests that there is a general alkalinity deficit in the lakes, and that a little over half of this deficit can be attributed to the formation of aluminosilicate minerals. The precipitation of salts is not profound, making the development of these clay minerals by reverse weathering more readily observable in comparison to the ocean. Using clay formation rates in the Ethiopian Rift lakes as a basis, the study suggests that clay formation in the ocean is too high to entirely attribute to the process of reverse weathering. It is believed that the deep-sea reverse weathering process never reaches completion, as pH is generally low. Hydrothermal activity is suggested to be a major contributor to clay formation in the deep ocean. = Hydrothermal Vents = Some hypothesize that hydrothermal vents may be a prominent source of reverse weathering. For some time, it was posited that terrestrial fluvial input was the only source of dissolved salts for the ocean. Later it was found that hydrothermal vents play a key role in the salinity of the oceans by releasing torrents of dissolved minerals that come from water/rock interactions. At these locations, some dissolved salts react with rock and are removed, thus changing the ion composition of the seawater in comparison to the hydrothermal fluid. 250x250px Some researchers hypothesize that reverse weathering could play a role in the silica cycle at hydrothermal vents. Low temperature hydrothermal vents release silicic acid (DSi) from the Earth's crust, and before it is able to exit the seabed, it cools and precipitates out as clay, such as a smectite. The extent to which reverse weathering at hydrothermal vents adds to the overall silica cycle is a hot topic.  History  In 1933, Victor Moritz Goldschmidt first proposed a reaction where igneous rock and volatiles would interact to generate sediments and seawater. Lars Gunnar Sill√©n would later propose that reactions involving the generation of silicates potentially played a role in controlling the composition and pH of seawater in 1959. At the time of Sill√©n's proposal, the thermodynamic constants of clay mineral reactions were not known and there were very few thermodynamic indicators that such a reaction existed. Frederick Mackenzie and Robert Garrels would then combine Goldschmidt's and Sill√©n's work with the concept of reconstitution reactions to derive the reverse weathering hypothesis in 1966. Since then, reverse weathering has been used as a possible explanation for various marine environment reactions and observations. Today, there is much debate over the significance of reverse weathering. The global extent of the process has not yet been measured, but inferences can be made by using specific local examples.

It was operated jointly with RCA's primary New York City station, WJZ (now WABC). After RCA took over operation of a third New York City station, WEAF (now WFAN), WJY was discontinued as being no longer needed. Station history The WJY studios and towers were located (along with WJZ) at Aeolian Hall in New York City (1923)\\"Aeolian Hall, New York\\", Radio Broadcast, April 1923, page 442. RCA was an early broadcasting pioneer, and would dominate the American radio and electronics industry for half a century. Its entry into the broadcasting field occurred on July 2, 1921, when a temporary longwave station located in Hoboken, New Jersey, also assigned the call letters WJY, was used for a ringside broadcast of the Dempsey-Carpentier heavyweight boxing match. In December 1921, RCA began regular operation of AM station WDY in Roselle Park, New Jersey,\\"New Stations: Commercial Land Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, October 1, 1921, page 2. Initial Limited Commercial license, serial #225, issued September 19, 1921 for three months. although WDY was shut down just two months later, when RCA began sharing half the cost of a Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing station, WJZ (now WABC), located in Newark, New Jersey.\\"WDY to Locate in New York\\", The Wireless Age, March 1922, pages 35-36. On May 15, 1923, RCA took over full responsibility for WJZ, and moved that station from Newark to New York City. This same day marked the debut of WJY, also located in New York City. WJY and WJZ shared facilities, known as \\"Radio Broadcast Central\\", which had been constructed on the sixth floor of Aeolian Hall at 29 West Forty-second Street.\\"WJY(ii)\\", The Airwaves of New York: Illustrated Histories of 156 AM Stations in the Metropolitan Area, 1921-1996 by Bill Jaker, Frank Sulek and Peter Kanze, 1998, page 102. RCA explained that it was operating two stations so that one could provide \\"high brow\\" entertainment (WJZ), and the other \\"popular\\" programming (WJY).\\"Radio Broadcast Central\\", The Wireless Age, July 1923, pages 40-41. Although introductory reviews emphasized that the studios and transmitting equipment provided to WJY and WJZ were equally advanced, it was soon clear that the senior WJZ was the dominant station. WJZ was assigned exclusive use of its 660 kHz frequency, while WJY had to share its frequency, 740 kHz, with two other stations: WOR, operated by the Bamberger Department Store in Newark, New Jersey, and WDT, operated by the Ship Owners Radio Service in New York City. (WDT was deleted by the end of the year). In addition, when RCA started development of a radio network, which eventually evolved into the NBC-Blue network (later the American Broadcasting Company), it normally featured programs originating from WJZ. WJY's program offerings appear to have been very limited. Two months after its debut, its schedule was listed as consisting of a single weekly transmission from 2:30 to 6:30 on Sunday afternoons.\\"The Wireless Oracle Speaks\\" by Hirsch M. Kaplan, Radio World, September 1, 1923, page 25. In the summer of 1926, RCA purchased the American Telephone & Telegraph Company's (AT&T;) radio operations, including its showcase New York City station, WEAF (now WFAN). WEAF's previous network operations were reorganized as the NBC-Red network, and its prominence was equal to WJZ, further overshadowing WJY. An article in the July 31, 1926 issue of Radio World noted that WOR, WJY's nominal timesharing partner, was now operating full-time because WJY was considered to have forfeited its hours. This report further referred to WJY as \\"R.C.A.'s weak sister station in New York City\\", and stated that it \\"hasn't been doing any broadcasting for a few moons\\".\\"Wave Confusion Increases\\", Radio World, July 31, 1926, page 18. A month later, an article in Radio Digest quoted WOR management as saying that although their timesharing agreement allocated hours to WJY on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays, that station had actually been silent since February 6, and despite assurances by WJY management that they would soon resume broadcasting, it had \\"remained totally silent\\".\\"WOR Takes Unused Time Held by WJY\\", Radio Digest, Second August Number 1926, page 13.

It broadcasts at 100.9 FM from a studio in the basement of Waterfall Arts (a former elementary school) on High Street. The range of the signal is 10‚Äì20 miles depending on geographic and weather conditions.  History  The license is held by the City of Belfast, but the station was created and is run by a group of volunteers, called Belfast Community Radio. This group was put together in a hurry during the fall of 2016, because the construction permit would expire if the station was not on the air by late January 2017. In eight weeks, a fundraising group led by Jennifer Hill and Erik Klausmeyer raised about $40,000 in business and individual donations, a foundation grant, and in-kind donations of equipment and furnishings. Community building events included a potluck with musical acts, an outdoor 'radio studio' for children during Halloween trick-or-treat, and a movie at the Colonial Theater. Other major players in this early phase were Karen Nelson, Patrick Walsh, Petra Hall and Wylie Fowler. The station was constructed in early December, 2016, by the technical committee‚ÄîPete Dalton, Erik Klausmeyer, Vic Tredwell, Zafra Whitcomb‚Äîand many other helpers. The basement room was soundproofed with donated acoustic tiles. Equipment was selected, purchased and installed. The antenna was strapped to the chimney of the building using a metal-banding machine from the transfer station. A dedicated internet connection was established. After a brief period of testing, the station launched on December 17, 2016 with a marathon show of live music and interviews from noon until 8pm. A dozen local music groups appeared in the show, as well as city councilors and other supporters of the station. After that the 'robot DJ' -- a computer program‚Äîtook over. It broadcasts music 24/7, except when human DJ's are training or the station is transmitting prerecorded shows by community members. The station's second major event was held on New Year's Eve. Concerts put on by the 20th Annual New Years By The Bay were recorded and hand carried to the station. These were broadcast with a one-hour delay, along with good wishes call-ins. Both of the marathon shows were produced by Vic Tredwell, with help from many volunteers.  Going forward  The programming committee, led by Karen Nelson and Judi Erickson, is recruiting and training programmers. Regular music and public service shows will be starting up over the course of January. The governance committee, led by Zafra Whitcomb and Lane Sturtevant, is working toward bylaws and incorporation. When these legal structures are in place, the City of Belfast will transfer the license to Belfast Community Radio.

The fight details were also telegraphed to station KDKA in East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and broadcast from there by a local announcer. These broadcasts were a cooperative effort, designed to raise money for the American Committee for Devastated France and the Navy Club. This also marked RCA's entrance into the radio broadcasting field, which the company would dominate in the U.S. for the next half century. History Although the general facts about WJY's Dempsey-Carpentier broadcast are well documented, significant discrepancies exist for certain details in the recollections of individual participants.The Listener's Voice: Early Radio and the American Public by Elena Razlogova, 2011, page 30. In particular, in addition to Julius Hopp, over time both J. Andrew White and David Sarnoff would claim credit for being the person who originated the idea of the broadcast. =Background= In 1920, radio broadcasting in the United States, which before World War I had been limited to a few scattered experimental efforts, was just starting to develop, although there were still very few homes with radio receivers, and most listening was done by amateur radio enthusiasts. Looking for interesting programming, station operators began adding sports events, including boxing matches. In January 1920, Lieutenant Herbert E. Metcalf, in conjunction with the Sacramento Radio Club, used U.S. Army Signal Corps equipment to announce from ringside a series of boxing matches taking place at Mather Field.\\"Wireless Phone Gives Union Fight Returns\\", Sacramento Union, January 17, 1920, page 8. The following September, the Detroit News employed its \\"Detroit News Radiophone\\" station, 8MK, to broadcast summaries telegraphed from nearby Benton Harbor, Michigan, as Jack Dempsey made short work of Billy Minske, knocking out his opponent in the third round.\\"Radio Spreads Fight News Broadcast in 30 Seconds\\", Detroit News, September 7, 1920, page 1. And on April 11, 1921, Westinghouse's broadcasting station KDKA in East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, carried ringside reports by Florent Gibson of a Johnny Ray vs. Johnny Dundee 10 round no-decision match.It Started Hear, KDKA promotional pamphlet, 1970, page 9. (worldradiohistory.com) Meanwhile, fight promoters were looking for ways to improve the image of their sport and increase its popularity. In January 1921, a bout between Benny Leonard and Richie Mitchell at the Madison Square Garden arena in New York City was conducted as a benefit for the American Committee for Devastated France, working with philanthropist Anne Morgan, who was chair of that charity's executive committee.\\"Leonard Retains Hold on Crown\\", (Portland) Morning Oregonian, January 15, 1921, page 1. (uoregon.edu) Julius Hopp, manager of Madison Square Garden concerts, who helped coordinate the charity match, was on the lookout for additional opportunities. In March 1921 he was reportedly introduced to radio broadcasting, after being \\"impressed with the skill of New York amateur radio men as disclosed at the Second District Convention\\",\\"Voice-Broadcasting the Stirring Progress of the 'Battle of the Century' \\", The Wireless Age, August 1921, pages 11-21. which was held at the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York City. One feature of this convention was that \\"music sent from the Bedloe Island Signal Corps Station [WVP]\\"WVP\\", The Airwaves of New York: Illustrated Histories of 156 AM Stations in the Metropolitan Area, 1921-1996 by Bill Jaker, Frank Sulek and Peter Kanze, 1998, page 186. via radiofone was heard almost continuously\\".\\"First Annual Amateur Radio Show and Convention\\", Radio News, April 1921, page 687. Hopp came up with the idea of combining radio broadcasting with charity work, and began to develop a plan to broadcast the upcoming \\"Battle of the Century\\" heavyweight championship fight between Jack Dempsey and Georges Carpentier. He approached Madison Square Garden owner and fight promoter G. L. \\"Tex\\" Rickard and Rickard's associate Frank E. Coultry, and received permission to work out the details. =Preparation= Hopp's overall plan was to raise funds for the American Committee for Devastated France, by recruiting listening locations at selected theaters and halls, which would charge an admission fee that would be donated to the charity. However, he needed extensive technical assistance in order to set up the transmission and reception sites. Canvasing for individuals with radio expertise, he contacted the head of the American Radio Relay League, Hiram Percy Maxim, who dismissed the idea as impractical. Hopp then approached the National Amateur Wireless Association (NAWA), an organization headquartered at 326 Broadway in New York City, that was originally formed under the auspices of the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America, and which became affiliated with the Radio Corporation of America when that company was created in 1919 to take over the American Marconi assets. The acting president of NAWA, J. Andrew White (Guglielmo Marconi was the nominal president) was immediately interested, and set out to use his extensive industry and amateur radio contacts to organize the transmission and recruit volunteers to staff receiving sites.\\"Report: Radiophone Broadcast of Dempsey-Carpentier Fight on July 2, 1921\\" by J. Andrew White, July 14, 1921, Box 1, David Sarnoff Papers, David Sarnoff Library. Next approached was RCA's then-General Manager David Sarnoff, who White knew had been keenly interested in the possibilities of radio broadcasting. Sarnoff financed the project by surreptitiously withdrawing $1,500 from an account holding funds accumulated from equipment rental. Arthur Batcheller, the government's Chief Radio Inspector for the second Radio Inspection district, arranged for a temporary radio station authorization, to be operated by RCA, and issued the random call letters of WJY. In order to provide the best possible coverage, the plan was to transmit on a longwave wavelength, 1600 meters (187 kHz), that was normally used by the U.S. government. Commander D. C. Patterson, District Communication Officer, approved this use of 1600 meters and helped insure that government stations would not interfere at the time of the scheduled broadcast. One of the prime participants would be J. O. Smith,Modern Radio Operation by J. O. Smith, 1922, pages 1-3. who had recently become director of the correspondence division of RCA's Radio Institute of America, and was well known in the amateur radio field through his Special Amateur station 2ZL,The \\"2\\" in 2ZL's call sign indicated that the station was located in the second Radio Inspection district, while the \\"Z\\" designated that it was operating under a Special Amateur license. located in Valley Stream, New York. Smith determined that a high-powered transmitter was being built in Schenectady, New York for the U.S. Navy by RCA's parent company, General Electric. He arranged for White to meet with the former assistant Secretary of the Navy (and future president) Franklin D. Roosevelt, to get permission to use this transmitter for the proposed broadcast. Roosevelt was the president of The Navy Club, and one of the conditions for approval was that his organization share, along with the American Committee for Devastated France, in the charitable receipts.\\"The First Big Radio Broadcast\\" by J. Andrew White, Reader's Digest, January 1956, pages 34-38. White arranged for a tug to deliver the transmitter from Schenectady. Advertisement promoting attendance at the Playhouse theater in Wilmington, Delaware\\"Dempsey-Carpentier Fight\\" (Playhouse advertisement), (Wilmington, Delaware) News Journal, June 30, 1921, page 8. On June 10, a circular soliciting volunteers from the ranks of amateur radio enthusiasts was mailed to 7,500 NAWA members. A formal application blank included with the circular was used by Smith to vet the responses and determine which individuals were qualified to assist. In addition to being acting president of NAWA, J. Andrew White was the editor of RCA's Wireless Age magazine, and the preparations, which included installing aerials and receivers capable of loudspeaker operation, were publicized in its pages. Julius Hopp, representing the American Committee for Devastated France and the Navy Club, reported that eleven halls, theaters and auditoriums had been secured within greater New York, in addition to forty-seven cities spanning from Massachusetts to Maryland, and westward to Pennsylvania, for a total of fifty-eight admission sites. The fight took place in Jersey City, New Jersey, where Rickard arranged for the construction of an outdoor arena accommodating 90,000 persons at Boyle's Thirty Acres. The initial proposal was to set up a radio transmitter and construct an antenna at ringside, but this proved to be impractical due to cost and logistical considerations. An alternate plan was developed after it was determined that there was an unused radio tower 2¬Ω miles (4 kilometers) from the arena, located at the Lackawanna train station in adjacent Hoboken, which was left over from earlier train communication tests. George W. Hayes was responsible for the general supervision of the installation at Hoboken, while W. J. Purcell, a General Electric employee detailed for the task, had primary responsibility for installing and testing the transmitter. The end of a hallway, in a railroad yard building primarily used by Pullman porters, was set aside as a transmitter location, and a large flat-top \\"T-type\\" antenna 250 feet (75 meters) high and spanning 450 feet (135 meters) was strung between the existing tower and the railroad station's clock tower. It had been announced that the transmitter used for broadcasting would be rated at 3¬Ω kilowatts, producing an antenna current of 20 to 25 amperes,\\"July 2nd Fight Described by Radiophone\\", The Wireless Age, July 1921, page 10. however, the actual transmitter ratings would be somewhat less. The set consisted of six 250-watt Radiotron tubes. All six tubes, totaling 1¬Ω kilowatts, were used for radiotelegraph (CW) work. For audio transmissions, three of the tubes were used to modulate the signal, which produced currents between 14 and 16 amperes. Test transmissions began on Friday evening, June 24, with successively greater powers used until preparations were completed on July 1. Hundreds of reception reports received from amateur radio operators monitoring WJY's performance provided reassurance that the signals were readily audible, and reaching the intended coverage area radius of 200 miles (325 kilometers). =July 2, 1921 broadcast= The original broadcast plan was to have J. Andrew White's ringside commentary carried directly over the air, via a telephone line that had been installed running from ringside to the Hoboken transmitter room. However, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T;) objected to having a telephone connection made to the radio transmitter.In July 1920, AT&T; made a cross-licensing agreement covering radio-related patents with General Electric, RCA's parent company. In the resulting distribution of rights under the agreement, AT&T; claimed it held a monopoly on telephone- radio transmitter connections. The solution was to have a \\"Mr. Sheehey of the Broad street office\\" type White's telephoned descriptions as they were received at the transmitter site, with the transcripts then given to J. O. Smith for reading over the air. To increase verisimilitude, a spare gong was placed near the transmitter, which was sounded in order to mimic the one at the ring that signalled the opening and closing of each round.\\"Meet J. Andrew White, the Most Famous Announcer in Radio\\" by Myra May, Radio Broadcast, October 1924, pages 447-453. The day of the broadcast was hot and humid, with morning showers. White, his assistant Harry Welker, and David Sarnoff were positioned at ringside next to the press box. White, who had been an amateur boxer, provided most if not all of the descriptions, although some accounts state that Sarnoff also participated in the announcing. The radio reports were timed so that each round was described during a three-minute period, with a one-minute interval between rounds. It was estimated that the bulletins were broadcast within a minute after they had been received at the Hoboken site. WJY was on the air for a total of about four hours. The programming opened with a series of preliminary bouts, which were conducted at half-hour intervals, and concluded with the Dempsey-Carpentier fight, which ended when the champion, Dempsey, knocked out Carpentier in the fourth round. Overall the broadcast was considered a major success, with the transmission achieving its goal of a high-quality signal that in some cases exceeded the anticipated 200 mile range. Estimates of the total audience size, perhaps generous, ranged from 200,000 to 500,000 listeners, enough to easily qualify as the largest radio audience to date. In addition to the listening sites established by the American Committee for Devastated France and the Navy Club, some additional locations had been independently set up by radio amateurs. J. Andrew White reported receiving hundreds of congratulatory letters at his Wireless Press office, which included \\"approximately $550\\" in contributions, in addition to an unknown total of admission fees collected by the charities at the participating theaters and auditoriums. (One of David Sarnoff's biographers reported that \\"Miss Morgan's charity reaped its greatest single windfall\\".The General: David Sarnoff and the Rise of the Communications Industry by Kenneth Bilby, 1986, page 57. However, RCA historian George H. Clark concluded that although the broadcast was a technical success, \\"financially it benefited the club organizations in name only\\".)\\"Pioneer Broadcasting\\" by George H. Clark, Broadcast News, May 1934, pages 10-16. (durenberger.com) Wireless Age mentioned in passing that there were \\"six theatres arranged for in the Pittsburgh district and assigned to the Westinghouse Company\\" These sites, which included Forbes Field,\\"Post Supplies News of Jersey Battle By Wireless 'Phone\\", Pittsburgh Post, July 3, 1921, Section Two, page 2. received reports broadcast by the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Co. station, KDKA, which had received telegraphed summaries sent by engineers who were monitoring WJY at the Westinghouse facility in Newark, New Jersey.\\"WJZ\\", The Wireless Age, June 1922, pages 36-37. =Aftermath= Seeing an opportunity for future growth, in his July 1921 report J. Andrew White suggested that \\"the Radio Corporation interests can dominate the amateur field\\". However, compared with the burgeoning home consumer sales that began within the year, the amateur radio market would be a niche of limited interest to RCA, and NAWA was disbanded a few years later. David Sarnoff foresaw a much greater potential. In a cover letter for the distribution of the White report, he noted that \\"It indicates the possibilities of radio devices for receiving broadcasted news and falls under the Music Box dream.\\" (Since at least 1916, Sarnoff had been promoting home entertainment by radio using an appliance he called the \\"radio music box\\".) And in fact RCA would go on to dominate radio broadcasting in the United States, selling millions of radio receivers, in addition to developing the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) radio networks. Following the success of the WJY fight broadcast, and with broadcasting stations beginning to be set up by a number of other companies, RCA soon began to establish a permanent presence. Initially there was talk about introducing a regular broadcast service over WJY at Hoboken. However RCA decided instead to construct a new station, WDY, at General Electric's Aldene plant in Roselle Park, New Jersey.Stations: Commercial Land Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, October 1, 1921, page 2. Limited Commercial license, serial #225, issued September 19, 1921 for three months. J. O. Smith and J. Andrew White were the principle operators of WDY, although the station was shut down after just a few months, when RCA decided to join forces with Westinghouse in operating Westinghouse's station in Newark, WJZ. (Some later reviews reported that the WJY transmitter was transferred to be used by WDY, but contemporary reports stated that WDY's transmitter, which was one-third the power of WJY's, had been separately constructed). On May 15, 1923, the WJY call letters were revived and assigned to a new RCA station located in New York City, which survived until mid-1927. With the rapid increase in broadcasting that began in the U.S. in 1922, J. Andrew White became famous as a sports announcer, specializing in boxing matches, and in a 1924 biographical review he was described as \\"the most famous announcer in radio\\". In 1927, he became one of the founders, and briefly served as the first president, of the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) radio network. White's later recounting of the WJY broadcast tended to expand his role at the expense of others, sometimes contradicting his own earlier statements. Beginning in 1924 he made no mention of Julius Hopp coming up with the plan for the Dempsey-Carpentier broadcast, instead saying the idea had originated with him. In 1955, he additionally claimed that it was his voice, not J. O. Smith's, that listeners heard, stating that a device had been rigged up to carry the sound of his voice from the telephone receiver in Hoboken to the transmitter microphone. David Sarnoff went on to a stellar career, becoming RCA's president in 1930. His later accounts would also develop significant differences from the contemporary reports. In a 1926 industry overview, Sarnoff also omitted any references to Julius Hopp, and credited J. Andrew White with coming up with the original plan.\\"Radio\\" by David Sarnoff as told to Mary Margaret McBride, Saturday Evening Post, August 14, 1926, page 94. However, when his authorized biography was published in 1966, it was now Sarnoff who was credited with originating the idea, and it is also implied that it was his idea to link the broadcast to the two charities.David Sarnoff (biography) by Eugene Lyons, 1966, pages 99-100. In view of his prominence, Sarnoff's version of events has often been the one used by historical reviews. Julius Hopp would become estranged from his former partners and embittered. In the fall of 1922, he filed a lawsuit against RCA, J. Andrew White, Tex Rickard and Frank Coultry, claiming he had been \\"defrauded out of the results of his work\\".\\"Radio Corporation Named in $100,000 Suit\\", New York Times, October 27, 1922.

Such maps are typically created collaboratively by people coming together over the Internet. The information can typically be sent to the map initiator or initiators by SMS or by filling out a form online and are then gathered on a map online automatically or by a dedicated group. In 2010, Ushahidi released \\"Crowdmap\\" ‚àí a free and open-source platform by which anyone can start crowdmapping projects.  Uses  Crowdmapping can be used to track fires, floods, pollution, crime, political violence, the spread of disease and bring a level of transparency to fast-moving events that are difficult for traditional media to adequately cover, or problem areas and longer-term trends and that may be difficult to identify through the reporting of individual events. During disasters the timeliness of relevant maps is critical as the needs and locations of victims may change rapidly. The use of crowdmapping by authorities can improve situational awareness during an incident and be used to support incident response. Crowdmaps are an efficient way to visually demonstrate the geographical spread of a phenomenon. = Examples = * HealthMap is a freely accessible, automated electronic information system in operation since 2006 that monitors, organizes, and visualizes reports of global disease outbreaks according to geography, time, and infectious disease agent that also crowdsources user data.Brownstein JS, Freifeld CC, Reis BY, Mandl KD (2008) Surveillance Sans Fronti√®res: Internet-Based Emerging Infectious Disease Intelligence and the HealthMap Project .

The website covers concerts and festivals, reports on entertainment news, reviews music, and publishes original content syndicated across on-demand audio platforms. History Dancing Astronaut was started in 2009 by Kevin Kaiser and Senthil Chidambaram as a platform for the emerging electronic dance music culture. As electronic dance music grew in popularity in the United States, Dancing Astronaut became known as the source of information that provided the youth audience with detailed insights into the expanding community. The company was incorporated in 2012 and has 6 founding members: Senthil Chidambaram, Kevin Kaiser, Zeyad Assaf, Tim Lim, Jacob Schulman, and David Giamanco. In 2012, Billboard Magazine referred to Dancing Astronaut as \\"The voice of the EDM generation.\\" Profiling the notable companies in the rapidly expanding industry of electronic dance music, Billboard's article titled The Takeover of EDM also praised Dancing Astronaut for its \\"style that resonates with EDM‚Äôs young fan base\\" and as a \\"content company with a strong, recognizable brand already in place.\\" Billboard positioned Dancing Astronaut as a valuable asset if it were to be acquired by Robert Sillerman's SFX Entertainment. In January 2014, Dancing Astronaut re-launched their website to \\"showcase interactive media in dynamic, innovative ways.\\" Expanding beyond the original blogroll format, Dancing Astronaut introduced a new user experience to change the way its audience engaged with content, creating conversation around news and music. Later that year, Dancing Astronaut was named in the \\"Top 20 Most Influential Music Blogs\\" by Digital Music News. In 2015 it had been rumored that Dancing Astronaut had been acquired by a major event promoter, with speculative parent companies Live Nation, SFX Entertainment, or AEG. The New York Times reported that Dancing Astronaut was \\"in talks to be acquired by Insomniac, a dance promoter whose majority owner is Live Nation.\\" Dancing Astronaut has been nominated for Best Music Media Resource at the International Dance Music Awards each year since 2014. Radio In January 2012, Dancing Astronaut launched their flagship podcast, Axis, hosting DJ mixes from guest artists on a weekly basis. Syndicated on iTunes and SoundCloud, each episode garners tens of thousands of listeners. Dancing Astronaut has produced over 180 episodes of Axis entering 2017, with guests including Martin Garrix, Afrojack, and others. Brand partnerships Dancing Astronaut has been the official media partner various music festivals across the globe including New York City's Electric Zoo, TomorrowWorld, Mysteryland (US) and Ultra Europe. P Diddy‚Äôs Revolt network partnered with Dancing Astronaut for their Summer Madness campaign in 2014 to further tap into the dance music audience. In 2014, Dancing Astronaut was a launch partner of Beats Music, one of the initial brands to serve as guest programmers to the streaming service, alongside outlets such as Rolling Stone and Pitchfork. Following Apple‚Äôs acquisition of Beats Music, Dancing Astronaut was again tapped as a featured curator of Apple Music upon its launch in 2015. In popular culture =The mainstream discussion= On June 24, 2012, former Editor-in-Chief Jacob Schulman published an editorial entitled \\"Dance Music Has Gone Mainstream, But It Doesn‚Äôt Have to Sell Out\\" which addressed the controversy surrounding EDM's rising popularity. The article went viral, becoming Dancing Astronaut's most read article to date, opening the subject for discussion and examination from music critics and cultural experts around the world. =will.i.am controversy= On April 16, 2013, Dancing Astronaut published a report accusing famed producer will.i.am of stealing from the production of \\"Rebound\\" by Arty and Mat Zo for his own single, \\"Let‚Äôs Go\\" featuring Chris Brown. The article provoked instant responses from Chris Brown, who tweeted his defense of participation on the song. Dancing Astronaut's findings were picked up by major US news outlets and became the center of controversy that questioned will.i.am's ethics, ultimately leading to the producer's admission later that month. =Breaking Daft Punk's return= On January 26, 2013, Dancing Astronaut broke the news in the United States that Daft Punk would be leaving their longtime record label EMI to sign with Sony's Columbia Records for the release of their fourth studio album.

Juno shake testing in November 2010 Jupiter's variable radiation belts are shown by these radio emissions from high-energy particles as detected by Cassini- Huygens when it coasted by Jupiter in 2000 on its way to Saturn Juno Radiation Vault is a compartment inside the Juno spacecraft that houses much of the probe's electronics and computers, and is intended to offer increased protection of radiation to the contents as the spacecraft endures the radiation environment at planet Jupiter. The Juno Radiation Vault is roughly a cube, with walls made of 1 cm thick (1/3 of an inch) titanium metal, and each side having an area of about a square meter (10 square feet). The vault weights about 200 kg (500 lbs). Inside the vault are the main command and data handling and power control boxes, along with 20 other electronic boxes. The vault should reduce the radiation exposure by about 800 times, as the spacecraft is exposed to an anticipated 20 million rads of radiation It does not stop all radiation, but significantly reduces it in order to limit damage to the spacecraft's electronics.  Summary  The vault has been compared being like \\"armor\\" or like a \\"tank\\", and the electronics within, like the spacecraft's \\"brain\\". The power systems have been described as a \\"heart\\". The vault is one of many features of the mission to help counter the high radiation levels near Jupiter, including an orbit that reduces time spent in the highest radiation regions, radiation-hardened electronics, and additional shielding on components. The wires that lead out from the vault also have increased protection, they have a sheath of braided copper and stainless steel. Some other components used tantalum metal for shielding in Juno, and while lead is known for its shielding effect it was found to be too soft in this application. One reason that titanium was chosen over lead in this application was because titanium was better at handling launch stresses. Another shield part of the spacecraft is the Stellar Reference Unit (SRU), which has six times the shielding to prevent static forming on images due to radiation. Juno is a space probe sent to Jupiter in 2011 and it entered orbit the night of July 4, 2016. Juno is part of the New Frontiers program of NASA and was also built with some contributions by the Italian Space Agency (ASI). After arriving at Jupiter in July 2016, the mission went into a 53-day orbit around the planet, and collected data using its suite of instrumentation in the late 2010s. Inside the vault There are at least 20 different electronics boxes inside the vault, which is intended to reduce the amount of radiation they receive. Examples of components inside the vault: *Command and data handling box *RAD750 microprocessor *Power and data distribution unit *Thermistor temperature sensors *UVS instrument electronics box *Waves instrument receivers and electronics box *Microwave Radiometer electronicsKey and Driving Requirements for the Juno Payload Suite of Instruments *JADE instrument Ebox (or E-Box) **Low-Voltage Power Supply Module ** Instrument Processing Board **Sensor Interface Board **High-Voltage Power Supplies (two) JEDI and JunoCam do not have electronic boxes inside the vault.  Technological relations  A Ganymede orbiter proposal also included a design for a Juno-like radiation vault. However, because the radiation is less at Jupiter's moon Ganymede and the orbiter's path, the vault would not have to be as thick, all else being similar. One reason the radiation is strong at Jupiter, but confined to certain belts, is because it is generated by ions and electrons trapped in areas as a result of Jupiter's magnetic field. Jupiter's magnetosphere is about 20,000 times as strong as Earth's and is one of the items of study by Juno. (see also Junos Magnetometer (MAG) instrument) Another spacecraft with radiation shields was Skylab, which needed a radiation shield over a borosilicate glass window to stop it darkening, and several film vaults. There were five vaults for photographic film aboard the Skylab space station, and the largest weighed 1088 kg (2398 lb). Juno is the first time a spacecraft has a titanium vault for its electronics however. Radiation hardening in general is an important part of spacecraft design when it is required, and the main processor of Juno, the RAD750, has been used on other spacecraft where there are elevated radiation levels, and it is a radiation- hardened microprocessor. For example, the RAD750 was also used on the Curiosity rover, launched November 26, 2011NASA Launches Most Capable and Robust Rover to Mars It was suggested by the publication Popular Science that the Europa Lander may use a radiation vault like the Juno Jupiter orbiter.

Students were a vital force in struggle and war of liberation‚Äî mainly they were the people who dreamed of building a free, equitable, secular society and they had sacrificed a lot for chanting the slogans for a free country and world in highly polarized world in that time. At the end of 1972 students made mobilizations against the attack of United States of America on Vietnam like it was being done by the students all over the world. 1 January was decided to be observed as Vietnam Solidarity day. History After a students‚Äô gathering at Bat-tala students were moving in rally to give a memorandum to the American Embassy on 1 January 1973. The police tried to disperse the protesters. The police fired on the rally. Two died on the spot and many students were seriously injured. Bangladesh Students Union activists Matiul Islam and Mirza Kaderul Islam died in the police firing. The incident instigated the students into starting another movement was made against this brutality. On pressure government sought apology and accepted demands of the students later in which recognizing Revolutionary Government of Vietnam was included as a point of demands. And for this movement and martyrdom Bangladesh became the first South Asian and second Asian country to recognize Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam on 11 February 1973.

Asbestos was widely used in the shipbuilding industry. Cases About 500 people have died due to asbestos exposure at the Newport News shipyard. =Exxon= In March 2011, a jury in Newport News awarded about $25 million to a former shipyard worker named Rubert Minton. Minton had worked on 17 different Exxon tankers over the course of his career. Decades later he began to suffer from mesothelioma. He filed suit against Exxon in 2009. Minton's lead attorney was Robert Hatten. Hatten said the award would be reduced to about $17.5 million because the $12.5 million in punitive damages awarded by the jury exceeded the $5 million that had been demanded by Minton. Suits against ship owners were a novel legal development. Most of the asbestos suits in Newport News had previously been brought against parts makers. Shipyards have immunity from asbestos suits under worker's compensation laws. Exxon said the shipyard was solely responsible for the safety of its workers and that there was no proof on its ships. Minton lawyers said Exxon new about health risks from asbestos in the 1930s and created rules to protect its own workers but did nothing to warn shipyard workers. =Dorthe Crisp Gibbs v. Newport News Shipbuilding & Drydock Co.= Gibbs was an active-duty member of the United States Navy when he was exposed to asbestos after being ordered to take part in pre-commission tests of a nuclear submarine. He later developed mesothelioma and died in 2009. Gibbs sued Newport News in 2008. His wife continued that suit and sued for wrongful death. The state circuit court dismissed her case. The court ruled that worker's compensation was her exclusive remedy. The Virginia state supreme court overturned the circuit court's decision in 2012. It found that because the Navy was not liable under worker's compensation Gibbs could file suit against Newport News. Criticism The American Tort Reform Association (ATRA) has named Newport News a \\"Judicial Hellhole\\" for allegedly applying the law in biased manner in favor of plaintiffs.

It is one of six native Japanese cattle breeds, and one of the four Japanese breeds known as wagy≈´, the others being the Japanese Black, the Japanese Brown and the Japanese Shorthorn. All wagy≈´ cattle derive from cross-breeding in the early twentieth century of native Japanese cattle with imported stock, mostly from Europe. In the case of the Japanese Polled, the principal foreign influence was from the Scottish Angus breed.  History  Cattle were brought to Japan from China at the same time as the cultivation of rice, in about the second century AD, in the Yayoi period. Until about the time of the Meiji Restoration in 1868, they were used only as draught animals, in agriculture, forestry, mining and for transport, and as a source of fertiliser. Milk consumption was unknown, and ‚Äì for cultural and religious reasons ‚Äì meat was not eaten. Cattle were highly prized and valuable, too expensive for a poor farmer to buy. Japan was effectively isolated from the rest of the world from 1635 until 1854; there was no possibility of intromission of foreign genes to the cattle population during this time. Between 1868, the year of the Meiji Restoration, and 1887, some 2600 foreign cattle were imported. At first there was little interest in cross-breeding these with native stock, but from about 1900 it became widespread. It ceased abruptly in 1910, when it was realised that, while the cross-breeds might be larger and have better dairy qualities, their working capacity and meat quality was lower. From 1919, the various heterogeneous regional populations that resulted from this brief period of cross-breeding were registered and selected as \\"Improved Japanese Cattle\\". Four separate strains were characterised, based mainly on which type of foreign cattle had most influenced the hybrids, and were recognised as breeds in 1944. These were the four wagy≈´ breeds, the Japanese Polled, the Japanese Black, the Japanese Brown and the Japanese Shorthorn. The Japanese Polled developed in south-western Honshu, in the prefecture of Yamaguchi. The principal foreign influence was from Scottish Angus cattle. The conservation status of the Japanese Polled was listed by the FAO as \\"critical\\" in 2007. In 1978 the total population was reported to be 2242; in 2008 it was 132. Although not at risk of immediate extinction, the breed is in need of emergency measures for its protection. The Japanese Polled Public Corporation has been set up by the administration of Yamaguchi Prefecture to protect and preserve the breed and its genetic resources.  Characteristics  The Japanese Polled is black; both sexes are polled, without horns.

It is 500 meters long and runs west to east from Harald Jensen's Plads to Skt. Anna Gade. The street is situated in the Frederiksbjerg neighborhood where it is functionally the main street but parts of it also acts as a public green space owing to width and central lawn. Ingerslevs Boulevard is home to St. Luke's Church and two schools, N.J. Fjordgade's School and Frederiksbjerg School. It is a mostly residential area but the street itself hosts a farmer's markets twice a week. Ingerslevs Boulevard was developed in the early 20th century as a main component of Frederiksbjerg when the neighborhood was created based on a unified urban planning design.  History  Ingerslevs Boulevard was named in 1899 and developed between 1899 and 1912. The boulevard is named for Hans Peter Ingerslev (1821-1896) who owned Marselisborg Manor until it was bought by Aarhus Municipality in 1896. The boulevard was a part of urban planning designs by city engineer Charles Ambt and architect Hack Kampmann who originally envisioned the boulevard extend all the way from St. Luke's Church square to Hans Broge's Street. The city council proved skeptical of the plans due to concerns over the amount of land needed. The eastern section of the boulevard was narrowed and instead became the present Odensegade. Ambt and Kampmann's original idea had been a wide boulevard flanked by prominent buildings on either side with a public, monumental building capping the street at the west end so Ingerslevs Boulevard would function as a point-de-vue. In 1912 Aarhus city council enacted changes to the original plans, extending Ingerslevs Boulevard to de Mezas Vej while the alignment of Horsensgade and Vejlegade along with the area by St. Luke's Church was determined.  Architecture  The buildings at the east end of the boulevard, on the north side, consists of the new Frederiksbjerg School and between Kroghsgade and Lundingsgades one block of 4¬Ω story picturesque buildings with bay windows and towers in the corners. On the south side are N.J. Fjordsgade School and Ingerslevs Boulevard School. Along the western end of the boulevard, on the south side, are 3 city blocks built between 1928 and 1930 which marked the end of revivalism in Aarhus. The north side is characterized by the Neoclassical St. Luke's Church and a Neo-baroque city block by Axel H√∏eg-Hansen. The boulevard is defined by two rows of elm trees (ulmus hollandica from 1913) planted along the wide midsection.

This village has high literacy rate than the surrounding villages. This village has five mosques. People here are very friendly. No major case like murder, theft etc. is ever filed in police station about any villager except some trivial cases. The village has the facilities like distilled water, electricity, landline phone, cable TV and domestic gas. The sanitary system is also satisfactory. The village is at ideal location situated in lush green fields on the Faisalabad-Chak Jhumra road, adjacent to M4 motorway and near Khurrianwala-Sargodha road by-pass. Railway line also passes through the village.  Problems  The major problem of the village is health facilities. There are few private clinics of some diploma holder \\"doctors\\" which can treat some basic diseases. People have to move to Faisalabad or Chak Jhumra to get their patient treated. Due to which some persons lost their lives on the way to hospital. The other problem is a soap factory which is situated in the village. This factory emits blackish, dense and bad smelling fumes which are causing the breath diseases among the villagers. The open big channel to dispose the sanitary water is also causing the diseases like malaria. It needs to be covered. Another problem is the absence of railway barrier at railway line whose absence has put the life of villagers in danger. The main ways to the village become unsafe at night. It becomes dangerous to travel to village at night due to which people doing jobs in remote cities face much trouble. Many incidents of looting the people on the way to village happened. So some police patrolling needed on these ways especially at night due this security risk. If government pays proper attention to the basics facilities of these villagers, it will be a relief for them and they will prove more useful citizens.

History The Anglican Diocese of the Rocky Mountains traces his origins to the Anglican Mission in the Americas, started as a missionary movement of the Province of the Anglican Church of Rwanda in the United States and Canada, in 2000.Our Story, Anglican Diocese of the Rocky Mountains Official Website The AMiA was a founding member of the Anglican Church in North America, in June 2009, it later would become an associate member and would eventually leave, in December 2011. Most of their parishes decided to create the PEARUSA, as the new missionary district of the Province of the Anglican Church of Rwanda, also a dual member of the ACNA, since June 2012. PEARUSA had three regional networks, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, West and Southeast. It was decided that all the three regional networks of PEARUSA would join the ACNA at the Synod of the Province of the Anglican Church of Rwanda, at 23 September 2015. The Provincial Council of ACNA, at 21 June 2016, decided that the two regional networks of Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, and West would become two new dioceses, the Anglican Diocese of Christ Our Hope and the Anglican Diocese of the Rocky Mountains, originated from the regional network of the West. The first bishop of the new diocese would be Ken Ross. The diocese is spread across the United States and one of his main purposes is church planting.

She is a professor in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. She was inducted as a Fellow of the Linguistic Society of America in 2016. In July 2020 she was awarded the title of Distinguished Professor.  Education  Before beginning her graduate studies in linguistics, Green received a B.S. in English education at Grambling State University and then an M.A. in English at the University of Kentucky. Dr. Green then went on to receive a PhD in linguistics from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst in 1993. Dr. Green's work has focused on linguistic variation between different dialects of English, with a primary focus on African American English. Her research focuses on morphosyntactic systems in African American English like tense and aspect marking and negation, as well as first language acquisition of AAE by child speakers.Green, Lisa, and Thomas Roeper. ‚ÄúThe Acquisition Path for Tense- Aspect: Remote Past and Habitual in Child African American English.‚Äù Language Acquisition, vol. 14, no. 3, 2007, pp. 269‚Äì313.

Now, she is a Professor in Department of Linguistics at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Here, she founded and directs the Center for the Study of African American Language, a resource for students and educators dedicated to dialect and language-related issues. An enduring goal of Dr. Green's is to dispel notions of AAE as a substandard linguistic variety by demonstrating its systematic nature.  Selected publications  = Books = * Green, Lisa. (2011).

The proposal for the school was initiated by local parents in partnership with the Russell Education Trust (RET), who operate four other free schools in the south and south-west of England. Turing House School is named in honour of Alan Turing the famous mathematician who lived for a while in nearby Hampton when he worked at the National Physical Laboratory. The school is governed by RET, with a range of governance responsibilities delegated to the school's local governing body. Ofsted In May 2018 the school was rated by Ofsted as \\"good\\" overall, with areas being \\"outstanding\\". Site Due to delays in securing a permanent site large enough for a secondary school, Turing House has been temporarily housed in a converted office block in Teddington, using local sports facilities at Bushy Park, and a second site in Hampton. It plans to move to a permanent site in Whitton, in 2021. The site is adjacent to Borough Cemetery, Heathfield Recreation Ground, and Sempervirens Nursery (which is also the head office of the nursery's owner, Kingston Landscape Group). The proposed site has resulted in controversy due to the Metropolitan Open Land designation. Admissions Admissions for Year 7, and in-year admissions for all year groups are handled by Richmond Council's schools admission team.
