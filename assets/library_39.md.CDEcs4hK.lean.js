Early life Born into a modest family from Venice, Lucatello lived with his parents Andrea and Teresa Brunello within a stone's throw of the local parish church, Basilica dei Frari, where, as a young child, he would spend his time leafing through the art books stored in the sacristy.Carlo Pirovano, \\"La pittura in Italia\\" (Painting in Italy), Electa 1993, second volume, p. 757. He attended the Carmini Art Institute, diligently combining formal academic study with his very own personal study of the city's rich artistic heritage: its wealth of church paintings, museums and art collections. He concluded his intense, if rather chaotic, studies in 1949 after following a course at the Scuola Libera del Nudo run by the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia. Here he was conferred the Institute's first prize for drawing,Carlo Pirovano, \\"La pittura in Italia\\" (Painting in Italy), Electa 1993, second volume, p. 757. which he received from maestro Virgilio Guidi, who was to remain a friend. The prize announced his artistic debut among the new generation of up and coming artists and assured him his own studio on the top floor of Palazzo Carminati, at San StaeCarlo Pirovano, \\"La pittura in Italia\\" (Painting in Italy), Electa 1993, second volume, p. 757. for eleven consecutive years, courtesy of the Opera Bevilacqua La Masa Foundation. The Venetian period In the period immediately following the Second World War, Venice was one of the most active cultural centres in Italy, spurred in part by the highly influential arts movement Fronte Nuovo delle Arti. When Lucatello came to exhibit his works, the movement had already begun to run out of steam, although the rift between neo-realism and abstractionism (Pizzinato, Vedova) continued to rage .Carlo Pirovano, \\"La pittura in Italia\\" (Painting in Italy), Electa 1993, second volume, p. 757. As for Lucatello, his view of the world was one seen through the prism of the poor and disadvantaged, hence his interest in the Communist Party and Marxist theory generally.Giselda Lucatello, 1986: catalogue biography for the Opera Bevilacqua La Masa exhibition.Carlo Pirovano, \\"La pittura in Italia\\" (Painting in Italy), Electa 1993, second volume, p. 757. Initially, Lucatello exhibited his charcoal drawings mainly at the annual competitions of the Opera Bevilacqua La Masa Foundation, which in 1952 awarded him first prize. These explicitly Neo-realist works included the series entitled Carbonai (Coalmen), Mondine (Paddy-field Workers), the Alluvionate del Polesine (Polesine Floods) and l‚ÄôOperaio dormiente (Sleeping Factory Worker). Inspired by the views from his studio, Lucatello produced a series of paintings (oil on hardboard) entitled Tetti di Venezia (Rooftops of Venice), three of which were selected by the jury of the Venice Biennale, which awarded him the Tursi Prize . In 1956 he began his collaboration with the Esther Robles Gallery of Los Angeles,Ester Robles Gallery, Los Angeles 1960: catalogue published by the gallery. which organized several solo and group exhibitions in California, and the same year exhibited in a show featuring European painters at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Houston, Texas . The contract with the Californian gallery was to end abruptly and inexplicably just a few years later, however, given the political climate in America at that time, the era of McCarthyism, the reason likely lay in the artist's political leanings.Giselda Lucatello, catalogue biography for the Opera Bevilacqua La Masa exhibition, 1986.Carlo Pirovano, \\"La Pittura in Italia\\" (Painting in Italy), Electa 1993, second volume, p. 757. Whilst living in the Polesine, an area around the Po river. Lucatello produced several series of paintings: Delta, Stagni (Ponds), Donne di Comacchio (The Women of Comacchio). Later he moved with his family to an island in the lagoon and it was here that he painted Orti a Portosecco (Portosecco Gardens) and the first of his Terre Grumose (Clumpy Earth) series.Giselda Lucatello, 1986: catalogue biography for the Opera Bevilacqua La Masa exhibition. Friulian period In 1953 Lucatello married Giselda Paulon, with whom he was to have five children. When, in 1961, he took up a teaching post at the Istituto d‚ÄôArte in Udine, he moved to Friuli definitively, settling with his family in the nearby town of Tarcento. Now that his work was inextricably linked to nature, this new environment opened up new possibilities, presenting new courses to follow and subjects to paint.Carlo Pirovano, \\"La pittura in Italia\\" (Painting in Italy), Electa 1993, second volume, p. 757. He found an affinity with the surrounding Friulian landscape and a sense of inner equilibrium painting the Tagliamento and its grassy banks. Other subjects and other series followed: Soli (Suns), Momenti di natura (Moments of Nature), Dialettica uomo-natura (Dialetic between Man and Nature) and then Ostacoli (Obstacles), which marked an important period in his oeuvre. In the wake of the earthquake of 1976, which demolished his studio, he was forced to take a break from painting and for a few months returned to working with charcoal, producing Terremotate a Grado (The Grado Earthquakes). On re-opening his studio, he resumed his painting with a series of works inspired by the Friulian landscape: Nature del Friuli and Soli (Friulian Nature and Suns). This was followed by a series of paintings entitled Musi depicting the mountain range around Tarcento; it was to be his last, being abruptly interrupted by his untimely death.Carlo Pirovano, \\"La pittura in Italia\\" (Painting in Italy), Electa 1993, second volume, p. 757. In 1986, two years after his death, the Venice City Council dedicated a large retrospective to Albino Lucatello at the Opera Bevilacqua La Masa Foundation. This was followed two years later by an extensive exhibition at the Galleria d‚ÄôArte Moderna organized by the Udine City Council. In 2004 the Regional Authority of Friuli Venezia Giulia and the Municipal Council of Tarcento paid homage to Lucatello with a large exhibition held at Villa Moretti in Tarcento, with an supplementary graphic exhibition at the town museum, Museo di Udine . His works are currently exhibited at the Museo d‚ÄôArte Moderna Ca‚Äô Pesaro di Venezia, the Contemporary Arts Museum in Houston, the Museum of Modern Art in Zagabria and at the Museo di Arte Moderna e Contemporanea in Udine. Philosophical Thought and Painting Style Despite initially nailing his colours with both passion and conviction to the mast of Neo-realism, Lucatello was very soon persuaded that simply denouncing the injustices of the world would never be sufficient to change it and that whatever awareness raising there was, it would always be too tardy and too little.Carlo Pirovano, \\"La pittura in Italia\\" (Painting in Italy), Electa 1993, second volume, p. 757. Nothing can ever change ‚Äì reasoned Lucatello ‚Äì until man truly reveals himself, before he begins not only to investigate his relationship with nature but also the meaning of his existence in the world. Observing, seeing, knowing ‚Äòhow‚Äô to ‚Äòlook‚Äô and listen to the ‚Äòsilent‚Äô thread of the past, can open up innumerable paths . As early as 1950, Virgilio Guidi was to intuit that ¬´Lucatello‚Äôs work has a naturalistic appearance, that tentative, indeterminate quality of the young when faced with the problem of [representing] nature, and yet, in reality, its structure is not naturalistic [...] he already has the ability to remove the elements of visible reality, to exclude the superfluous and to assemble that which he sees as necessary in a light that is necessarily by no means accidental. These factors, do not strictly belong to naturalism¬ª.Virgilio Guidi, Bevilacqua La Masa Gallery, Venice, November,1950. This ability to see beneath the surface, to reveal that which is not immediately visible or is otherwise obscured by a prescriptive 'by numbers' approach, is aided by Lucatello's ongoing study of light, colour, and materiality, in all their myriad combinations . His is a realism set free from the bounds of mere representation. Bruno Rosada: brief essay in the magazine Evento, 1959 (September‚ÄìOctober edition, pp. 34-36);Berto Morucchio, 1969: Albino Lucatello, (Galleria d‚ÄôArte Venezia), monograph published on the occasion of the solo show Lucatello, March 1969. Not all discern this quality in his artistic production; indeed, there has been a tendency to view his work as being a variant of Arte Informale.Carlo Pirovano, \\"La pittura in Italia\\" (Painting in Italy), Electa 1993, second volume, p. 757. It is a reading that is counterposed by works such as Teiere (Teapots), even as early as the late fifties. In this series of around twenty paintings depicting a river delta, Lucatello procatively introduces the somewhat improbable yet distinct form of a teapot, clearly visible in all its reassuring familiarity. By persisting in this direction, Lucatello gradually develops his own ideological vision and painting style, reaching artistic maturity in the late sixties and early seventies.Franco Solmi, 1989: ‚ÄòLettere per Franco Solmi‚Äô (book published in homage to Franco Solmi, including critical reviews), Certosa di Calci, Pisa. His research takes on ever more depth, he becomes more attentive towards particulars, focusing on the smallest and most specific of details, so as to maximize the freedom of form, liberating it from each of its apparent meanings. This is how Lucatello speaks of us, not the ‚Äòus‚Äô that is rooted in a specific historical moment, the modern man of progress, science, technology and 24 hour rolling news, but rather the ‚Äòus‚Äô that we have always been and always will be; in other words, Lucatello speaks of universal man; of the signs and footprints of which we are made, of universally lived experience, of our shared human heritage, rooted in the past but with us always, anticipating our every act, our every move.Alessandro Del Puppo, 2004: in \\"Luce, colore e materia. Lucatello pittore del ‚Äô900\\" (‚ÄúLucatello: a 20th Century painter‚Äù), in: \\"Light, Colour, and Material\\", exhibition catalogue, Villa Moretti, Tarcento, 2004. These signs our part of our universal history and we carry them within us, and yet we tend to ignore them, to the point of forgetting them altogether. They appear to be beyond our reach and yet are close at hand. They are to be sought and found precisely in that which makes us what we are, in our human condition: in our nature, biology, body, soul, intelligence, feelings, unconscious, fears, confrontation, love . Albino Lucatello, with his painting, pulls out these signs and, in revealing them to us, causes us to interact with the ‚Äòbefore‚Äô which informs our being and is an essential part of who we are, because ‚Äì he says ‚Äì there can be no relationships between individuals if we do not start first with the singular, with the individual himself. The achievement of a 'we' is by no means a foregone conclusion. First, there must be a call to account, a self-awareness; it is not a question of isolating oneself from the context in which one finds oneself, far from it. Such an undertaking requires concentration, listening, opening one's mind to joy, insight and understanding, but also to difficulty and pain. There is no predestination, only repeated and unavoidable questions which, in the work of Lucatello, acquire a different form in each of his artistic 'periods'. The many questions posed by Lucatello succeed in generating many more in the beholder. Moving from a rich, intense and complex reality, Lucatello gradually hones in on the essentials, paring back the layers to reveal a single idea, a single thought, a condensed reality rendered all the more potent and forceful by the impactful use of tone ‚Äì black on black, white on white ‚Äì a reality stripped bare of the banal, the superfluous . His is a reality that transports us to a dimension that is timeless and universal, one that not merely represents the inevitable passage of time but which is simultaneously the essence of what has been and what may be ‚Äì for there is always an alternative, a further possibility. And yet it is also true that the very path that promises to unite and connect us to the world is invariably impeded by existing social structures and superstructures which, instead of liberating us, trap us, imprisoning us in an existence without purpose or direction Renzo Viezzi. : text written on the occasion of the exhibition Lucatello at Galleria Falaschi, Passariano, Codroipo, Italy, January, 1979. ‚Äì as conveyed by the frequent use of black, by the series Obstacles, or by other symbolic features such as the faces of those who ask to rejoin the path, ready and willing to do what it takes to overcome all that stands between us and life . Through his art, Lucatello expressed what was very much a secular view of life, one tuned into the myriad forces that move us: ¬´There is something of the mystical here, a dormant and perhaps unconsciously religious sense, which is in constant search of a dialogue with the material. And it is this interchange that imbues his work with its poetic soul and distinct spiritual meaning¬ª Major Exhibitions *1956: 28th Venice International Art Biennale; winner of the Tursi Prize, catalogue published; *1957: Modern Italian Painters, World House Gallery, New York, catalogue published; *1958: The New Renaissance in Italy, Pasadena Art Museum Pasadena, catalogue published (Levitt Thomas); *1958: 50 years of Venetian painting, Warsaw, catalogue published; *1958: Group exhibition, Directional Galleries, Los Angeles, catalogue published; *1958: Solo exhibition, Esther Robles Gallery, Los Angeles, catalogue published; *1959: 8th Rome Quadrenniale, Rome, catalogue published; *1959: Group exhibition, Museo del Prado, Madrid, catalogue published (Silvio Brandi); *1960: Esther Robles Gallery, Los Angeles, catalogue published (Bruno Rosada); *1960: Group exhibition, New European Artists Contemporary Arts Museum, Houston, Texas, catalogue published; *1961: Italian Centennial Exhibition, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, catalogue published; *1961: Group exhibition at the premises of The Art Association, Palos Verdes, California, catalogue published; *1961: Peintures et sculptures italiennes contemporains (Italian Contemporary Painters and Sculptors), Galerie Alec Saab, Beirut, catalogue published (Dessy Nicola); *1962: 40 Venetian Painters, Contemporary Art Gallery, Zagreb, catalogue published; *1962: Peinture Venitienne d'Aujourd'hui (Venetian Painters of Today), Galerie Pierre Domec, Paris, catalogue published; *1969: Acht Venezianer Maler in Deutschland, touring exhibition held in the Istituti Italiani di Cultura (Italian Cultural Institutes) Germany, catalogue published (Silvio Brandi); *1971: Group exhibition, Kursaal Casino Lignano Sabbiadoro, Italy, catalogue published; *1976: Albino Lucatello, Palazzo delle Prigioni Vecchie, Circolo Artistico, Venice, catalogue published; *1978: Lucatello, Centro Friulano Arti Plastiche, Udine, catalogue published; *1979: Lucatello, Galleria Falaschi, Passariano, Codroipo, Italy, poster and catalogue published; *1983: Albino Lucatello, Galleria 'Il Traghetto', Venice; catalogue published; *1986: Lucatello: retrospettiva (Lucatello: Retrospective), Venice City Council exhibition held at the Fondazione Bevilacqua La Masa, Venice, catalogue published (written by Renzo Viezzi, with biography by Giselda Lucatello and critical essay by Bruno Rosada); *1988: Lucatello - 20 anni di pittura (1964 -1984) (Lucatello: 20 Years of Painting -1964-1984), Galleria d‚ÄôArte Moderna, Udine, organised in collaboration with the Centro Friulano Arti Plastiche, Udine Provincial Authority and Udine City Council, catalogue published (includes critical essay by Franco Solmi); *1988: Attraverso il disegno (Through Drawing) 1952 -1988, organised by the Centro Friulano Arti Plastiche and Galleria del Centro, catalogue published (with critical essay by Franco Solmi and biography by Giselda Lucatello); *1996: Lucatello.

Tirocchi Gowns (also known as Di Renaissance) was a business founded in 1911 in Providence, Rhode Island, by sisters Anna and Laura Tirocchi. They were dressmakers whose custom work was well known during the 1920s and '30s. They specialized in custom-designed, sumptuous gowns for the city's elite women, produced in their multi-story house on Broadway, which housed the custom business and their family. They operated their business until 1947, despite competition from retail manufactured clothing. The sisters and their business are notable because the quarters were preserved by the family in situ after it closed in 1947. The contents were donated in 1989 to Rhode Island School of Design which, with Brown University and the University of Rhode Island, worked for years to inventory and catalog the records and materials. In 2001 the business was the subject of an exhibition at the RISD Museum; it is believed to be the most complete collection of a 20th-century custom dressmaking business in existence. Community efforts have been made since 2011 to restore and find new uses for what is now known as Wedding Cake House, which their family occupied from 1915 to 1989. Early lives Anna (b.c. 1873) and Laura Tirocchi (b.c. 1888) were half-sisters born into a landowning family in the working-class town of Guarcino, Italy. They had different fathers. They received high-quality training in dressmaking and design in Rome, where they moved with their mother. (Family tradition said that they studied with a royal couturier.) Immigration to the United States In 1908, the sisters left Rome and immigrated to New York, when Anna was in her mid- thirties and Laura around twenty years old. They settled in Providence, Rhode Island by 1911. Several family members were already living in the city, and there was a considerable Italian immigrant population.  Tirocchi business in Providence  After six months of working under an established dressmaker, Rose Zarr, the Tirocchis set up their own business. They found space in the Butler Exchange Building and set up shop. They worked from room 438, and lived with a cousin on Pocasset Avenue. From their earliest years in the business, the sisters attracted enough demand to hire additional stitchers. The Butler Exchange was a center of custom retail activity at the time for upper-class women, who also patronized the milliners and shoemakers. They also studied with or brought their children to numerous music teachers who worked in the building. Despite competition, the quality of the Tirocchi sisters‚Äô work swiftly attracted clients and recognition. Anna Tirocchi (seated, in dark clothing) and her employees at the Butler Exchange shop, ca. 1912. This elite client base was what Anna preferred, and she was the leader of the business. After Laura received an inheritance from her father, who had been quite well off, they were able to move to a part of town that suited Anna's fashionable taste. Broadway Street, in what is now known as the historic armory district on the West Side, was a more elegant part of the city. They purchased an elegant, three-story house, constructed in 1867, and most of its furnishings from the widowed Mrs. George Prentice. Laura became engaged to a young physician, Dr. Louis J. Cella, and they married. The Tirocchis allowed Mrs. Prentice to live in the property until May 1915, when the Cella family and Anna Tirocchi moved in.  514 Broadway  514 Broadway was suited to their business. The three-story house was a mix of Second Empire and Italianate styles. The Broadway house resembled the mansions of the Tirocchis‚Äô clientele, and they felt comfortable in its lavish surroundings. For the first ten years of business, the Tirocchis operated their custom design business on the second floor, and clients were invited to use an elevator to reach it. Dr. Cella's medical practice was located on the first floor, along with the office of the family bookkeeper. In 1917 they built an addition to the side of the house, where he moved his office. He may have specialized in urology and venereal disease. He was elected as the district alderman and he was active in advocating for clean water in the city, at a time when infrastructure was under construction. By the 1930s, Dr. Cella had become a medical missionary in China and spent long periods of time away from Providence. Wedding Cake House - 514 Broadway, Providence, RI The house had been beautifully furnished. The second floor was used for the public parts of the dressmaking business. The Red Room and Blue Room ‚Äì so named because of the color of their wallpapers ‚Äì were used as glamorous fitting rooms. They were fitted with wall-to-wall mirrors and lace covered the armchairs. The neighboring billiards room was used as a showroom for fabrics. The sisters would drape some over the billiards table and folded other luxury fabrics for display in windowed cabinets. The atmosphere was opulent even into the cash-strapped forties. The house's third floor contained the sewing shop and the family's living quarters. Up to fourteen young women, called 'girls', would have been working in the shop (this number dwindled over the years). Five members of the Tirocchi-Cella family lived in the house at any given time. Whole rooms were devoted to the storage of fabrics and custom dress forms for clients. Parts of the public second floor were also put to use as storage for the many materials used by the business.  Class and culture  Anna cultivated a sense of affluence for her family, and especially toward her clients. As a seamstress ‚Äì even one who ran her own business ‚Äì she was firmly in the middle class of Providence. She worked to engender a sense of financial security for her family and gain respect. The Tirocchis had owned land in Italy, and Anna meant to achieve that status in Providence. During a period of good business, she bought a summer cottage at Narragansett Pier. She rented it out in the thirties and forties when custom business slowed. Even before this large purchase, though, she frequently invested in other properties in Providence. Her property on Broadway included lots on neighboring streets, which she rented to businesses for decades. In addition, she owned a gas station in Cranston and a restaurant on North Main. Anna managed most of the family's money with help from their bookkeeper. Dr. Cella submitted payments to them instead of keeping his practice financially separate. Laura Tirocchi at the time of her marriage to Dr. Louis J. Cella, 1915. Anna made yearly trips to Europe from 1924 until the thirties, primarily to Paris for business. While there, she attended shows by designers such as Lucien Lelong. She gained ideas and also returned with stories with which to regale her clients. With her Italian training, fancy home, and annual Parisian adventures, she was more worldly than most dressmakers. Because of this, Anna probably felt that she had some measure of an upper-class life, with her house and separate properties, but her clients certainly did not see her as a peer. Letters from clients reveal their double standards; they refer to her as ‚ÄòOur Anna‚Äô, rather than ‚ÄòMadame Tirocchi‚Äô, as she preferred. Anna Tirocchi held her business to the high standard she felt her work deserved, as her nephew Louis Cella Jr. and workers later attested. Most middle-class women would not have had the money to use a personal dressmaker in the first place, and Anna refused to serve the nouveau riche of Providence, believing that only those born to the upper class could truly appreciate her designs and work. She did make exceptions for notable members of her own community. She became a dressmaker for Mrs. Mariano Vervena, the wife of the Italian Consul in Providence, and for the daughter of her friend, Judge Antonio Capotasto.  Anna Tirocchi and her workers  Tirocchi consistently hired workers from the Italian immigrant community. The majority of her workers, referred to as ‚Äògirls‚Äô in the custom of the time, were daughters of Italian immigrants who lived in communities such as Silver Lake. Many had come from Anna's home town of Guarcino, and were introduced through community connections. In this way, the Tirocchi family took an active, if quiet, role in supporting immigrant working-class people like themselves. Anna strove to create a close-knit network of care around her workers. While they worked long days, nobody was required to take their work home, which was a common practice in sweatshops and mills. The shop effectively functioned under the apprentice system. Promotions and raises came regularly with acquisition of skills and experience. Several of her longer- term workers started dressmaking businesses of their own. Anna took in her niece for a period of years while she attended a school close by. She also worked with the other 'girls'. The shop workers formed a community, and called each other family. They sewed each other's wedding dresses, with the fabric donated to the bride by Anna, and some kept in contact for the rest of their lives. Each summer, Anna took the girls to her house in Narragansett for a week's vacation.  Dressmakers in Providence  Most dressmakers in Providence worked from home. The 1911 business directory has more than 800 listings for women dressmakers. Many were likely women who did repairs and alterations, not entrepreneurs who ran businesses. About a dozen women worked out of homes on Broadway, close to where Anna opened her own business. Some women established shops in downtown buildings such as Butler Exchange. Such locations included the Lederer Building at 139 Mathewson, the Arcade at 65 Weybosset, and the Conrad Building at 371-391 Westminster. The Tirocchis tried to promote their business: from the beginning they identified as ‚ÄúA. & L. Tirocchi Gowns‚Äù rather than 'Dressmakers‚Äô, as other businesses did. Their move to Broadway was a step to provide their elite customers with more privacy and personal attention than possible in the downtown offices. Anna depended on word-of-mouth to build her client list. She knew her audience and occasionally had items about her business in their bulletins, such as that of the Junior League of Rhode Island. There was a general silence in the public sphere about women businesses. For instance, directories showed many advertisements for male tailors but lacked ads for women dressmakers.  Ready-To-Wear competition and a decline in business  Textile and clothing manufacturing had lowered the price for purchases. Ready-to-wear clothes had been sold at department stores for decades. By the time the Tirocchis established their business, many women had begun to buy clothing from retail stores, rather than make it themselves or pay someone else. The market declined for custom, bespoke clothing . Tailoring services began to disappear; by 1915 the number of women dressmakers listed in the directory had decreased by forty percent to 480. By 1941, the city directory listed 134 women dressmakers. Half disappeared by 1946, the last full year that Anna worked. The Tirocchis worked hard to stay in business. Although they lost customers in the Depression, their elite clientele preferred their quiet, comfortable, highly personalized home environment to the popular new ‚Äòready-to-wear‚Äô stores. Anna's Roman training gave her status above the American-trained dressmakers in the city. She rebranded the shop as 'Di Renaissance' sometime before 1926, giving the business a classier air. Her investments in property yielded rental income when the dressmaking business declined. Anna kept her shop operating until her death in 1947, a testament to her skill as a dressmaker, her involvement with the community, and her business acumen. Laura had taken less of a role because of family obligations. She immediately closed it after Anna died, devoting herself to her family and personal life. Her family kept the house, as they continued to live in it.  The Collections  In 1989, Laura's son Louis Cella, Jr. offered the contents of the house to the Rhode Island School of Design Museum, the RISD Archive, and the University of Rhode Island. These collections contain thousands of business records and letters, a number of complete dresses, hundreds of yards in bolts of fabric and robes, and a variety of sewing paraphernalia. In 2001, the Museum exhibited the collections and research in From Paris to Providence: Fashion, Art, and the Tirocchi Dressmakers' Shop.  Sources   Further reading  *  External links  *A. & L.

The Empire of Japan entered World War II in September 27, 1940, by signing the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy, though, it wasn't until the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, that the US entered the conflict. Over the course of seven hours there were coordinated Japanese attacks on the U.S.-held Philippines, Guam and Wake Island and on the British Empire in Borneo, Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong. The strategic goals of the offensive were to cripple the U.S. Pacific fleet, capture oil fields in the Dutch East Indies, and maintain their sphere of influence of China, East Asia, and also Korea. It was also to expand the outer reaches of the Japanese Empire to create a formidable defensive perimeter around newly acquired territory. Preparations for war The decision by Japan to attack the United States remains controversial. Study groups in Japan had predicted ultimate disaster in a war between Japan and the U.S., and the Japanese economy was already straining to keep up with the demands of the war with China. However, the U.S. had placed an oil embargo on Japan and Japan felt that the United States' demands of unconditional withdrawal from China and non-aggression pacts with other Pacific powers were unacceptable. Facing an oil embargo by the United States as well as dwindling domestic reserves, the Japanese government decided to execute a plan developed by the military branch largely led by Osami Nagano and Isoroku Yamamoto to bomb the United States naval base in Hawaii, thereby bringing the United States to World War II on the side of the Allies. On September 4, 1941, the Japanese Cabinet met to consider the war plans prepared by Imperial General Headquarters, and decided: > Our Empire, for the purpose of self-defense and self-preservation, will > complete preparations for war ... [and is] ... resolved to go to war with > the United States, Great Britain, and the Netherlands if necessary. Our > Empire will concurrently take all possible diplomatic measures vis-a-vis the > United States and Great Britain, and thereby endeavor to obtain our > objectives ... In the event that there is no prospect of our demands being > met by the first ten days of October through the diplomatic negotiations > mentioned above, we will immediately decide to commence hostilities against > the United States, Britain and the Netherlands. The Vice Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, the chief architect of the attack on Pearl Harbor, had strong misgivings about war with the United States. Yamamoto had spent time in the United States during his youth when he studied as a language student at Harvard University (1919‚Äì1921) and later served as assistant naval attach√© in Washington, D.C. Understanding the inherent dangers of war with the United States, Yamamoto warned his fellow countrymen: \\"We can run wild for six months or maybe a year, but after that, I have utterly no confidence.\\" Japanese offensives (1941‚Äì42) Battle of Hong Kong, 8 December 1941, Downtown British Hong Kong under Japanese air raid A map of the Japanese advance from 1937 to 1942 The Imperial Japanese Navy made its surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, Oahu, Hawaii Territory, on Sunday morning, December 7, 1941. The Pacific Fleet of the United States Navy and its defending Army Air Forces and Marine air forces sustained significant losses. The primary objective of the attack was to incapacitate the United States long enough for Japan to establish its long-planned Southeast Asian empire and defensible buffer zones. However, as Admiral Yamamoto feared, the attack produced little lasting damage to the US Navy with priority targets like the Pacific Fleet's three aircraft carriers out at sea and vital shore facilities, whose destruction could have crippled the fleet on their own, were ignored. Of more serious consequences, the U.S. public saw the attack as a barbaric and treacherous act and rallied against the Empire of Japan. The United States entered the European Theatre and Pacific Theater in full force. Four days later, Adolf Hitler of Germany, and Benito Mussolini of Italy declared war on the United States, merging the separate conflicts. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese launched offensives against Allied forces in East and Southeast Asia, with simultaneous attacks on British Hong Kong, British Malaya and the Philippines. By the time World War II was in full swing, Japan had the most interest in using biological warfare. Japan's Air Force dropped massive amounts of ceramic bombs filled with bubonic plague-infested fleas in Ningbo, China. These attacks would eventually lead to thousands of deaths years after the war would end.Newman, T. (2018, February 28). Biological weapons and bioterrorism: Past, present, and future. Retrieved from https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/321030.php In Japan's relentless and indiscriminate research methods on biological warfare, they poisoned more than 1,000 Chinese village wells to study cholera and typhus outbreaks. These diseases are caused by bacteria that with today's technology could potentially be weaponized. A map of the Canterbury in New Zealand prepared by the Japanese Military following the attack on Pearl Harbour =South-East Asia= The South-East Asian campaign was preceded by years of propaganda and espionage activities carried out in the region by the Japanese Empire. The Japanese espoused their vision of a Greater Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, and an Asia for Asians to the people of Southeast Asia, who had lived under European rule for generations. As a result, many inhabitants in some of the colonies (particularly Indonesia) actually sided with the Japanese invaders for anti- colonial reasons. However, the ethnic Chinese, who had witnessed the effects of Japanese occupation in their homeland, did not side with the Japanese. Japanese troops march through the streets of Labuan, Borneo on January 14, 1942. Hong Kong surrendered to the Japanese on December 25. In Malaya the Japanese overwhelmed an Allied army composed of British, Indian, Australian and Malay forces. The Japanese were quickly able to advance down the Malayan Peninsula, forcing the Allied forces to retreat towards Singapore. The Allies lacked air cover and tanks; the Japanese had air supremacy. The sinking of HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Repulse on December 10, 1941, led to the east coast of Malaya being exposed to Japanese landings and the elimination of British naval power in the area. By the end of January 1942, the last Allied forces crossed the strait of Johore and into Singapore. In the Philippines, the Japanese pushed the combined Filipino-American force towards the Bataan Peninsula and later the island of Corregidor. By January 1942, General Douglas MacArthur and President Manuel L. Quezon were forced to flee in the face of Japanese advance. This marked one of the worst defeats suffered by the Americans, leaving over 70,000 American and Filipino prisoners of war in the custody of the Japanese. Battle of Singapore, February 1942. Victorious Japanese troops march through the city center. (Photo from Imperial War Museum) On February 15, 1942, Singapore, due to the overwhelming superiority of Japanese forces and encirclement tactics, fell to the Japanese, causing the largest surrender of British-led military personnel in history. An estimated 80,000 Indian, Australian and British troops were taken as prisoners of war, joining 50,000 taken in the Japanese invasion of Malaya (modern day Malaysia). Many were later used as forced labour constructing the Burma Railway, the site of the infamous Bridge on the River Kwai. Immediately following their invasion of British Malaya, the Japanese military carried out a purge of the Chinese population in Malaya and Singapore. The Japanese then seized the key oil production zones of Borneo, Central Java, Malang, Cepu, Sumatra, and Dutch New Guinea of the late Dutch East Indies, defeating the Dutch forces. However, Allied sabotage had made it difficult for the Japanese to restore oil production to its pre-war peak. The Japanese then consolidated their lines of supply through capturing key islands of the Pacific, including Guadalcanal. Tide turns (1942‚Äì45) Battle of Midway. The attack by dive bombers from and on the Japanese aircraft carriers Soryu, Akagi and Kaga in the morning of 4 June 1942. Japanese military strategists were keenly aware of the unfavorable discrepancy between the industrial potential of the Japanese Empire and that of the United States. Because of this they reasoned that Japanese success hinged on their ability to extend the strategic advantage gained at Pearl Harbor with additional rapid strategic victories. The Japanese Command reasoned that only decisive destruction of the United States' Pacific Fleet and conquest of its remote outposts would ensure that the Japanese Empire would not be overwhelmed by America's industrial might. In April 1942, Japan was bombed for the first time in the Doolittle Raid. In May 1942, failure to decisively defeat the Allies at the Battle of the Coral Sea, in spite of Japanese numerical superiority, equated to a strategic defeat for Imperial Japan. This setback was followed in June 1942 by the catastrophic loss of four fleet carriers at the Battle of Midway, the first decisive defeat for the Imperial Japanese Navy. It proved to be the turning point of the war as the Navy lost its offensive strategic capability and never managed to reconstruct the \\"'critical mass' of both large numbers of carriers and well-trained air groups\\". Australian land forces defeated Japanese Marines in New Guinea at the Battle of Milne Bay in September 1942, which was the first land defeat suffered by the Japanese in the Pacific. Further victories by the Allies at Guadalcanal in September 1942, and New Guinea in 1943 put the Empire of Japan on the defensive for the remainder of the war, with Guadalcanal in particular sapping their already-limited oil supplies. During 1943 and 1944, Allied forces, backed by the industrial might and vast raw material resources of the United States, advanced steadily towards Japan. The Sixth United States Army, led by General MacArthur, landed on Leyte on October 20, 1944. In the subsequent months, during the Philippines Campaign (1944‚Äì45), the combined United States forces, together with the native guerrilla units, liberated the Philippines. By 1944, the Allies had seized or bypassed and neutralized many of Japan's strategic bases through amphibious landings and bombardment. This, coupled with the losses inflicted by Allied submarines on Japanese shipping routes began to strangle Japan's economy and undermine its ability to supply its army. By early 1945, the U.S. Marines had wrested control of the Ogasawara Islands in several hard-fought battles such as the Battle of Iwo Jima, marking the beginning of the fall of the islands of Japan. =Air raids on Japan= The atomic bombing of Nagasaki on August 9, 1945 After securing airfields in Saipan and Guam in the summer of 1944, the United States Army Air Forces undertook an intense strategic bombing campaign, using incendiary bombs, burning Japanese cities in an effort to pulverize Japan's industry and shatter its morale. The Operation Meetinghouse raid on Tokyo on the night of March 9‚Äì10, 1945, led to the deaths of approximately 100,000 civilians. Approximately 350,000‚Äì500,000 civilians died in 66 other Japanese cities as a result of the incendiary bombing campaign on Japan. Concurrent to these attacks, Japan's vital coastal shipping operations were severely hampered with extensive aerial mining by the U.S.'s Operation Starvation. Regardless, these efforts did not succeed in persuading the Japanese military to surrender. In mid-August 1945, the United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. These atomic bombings were the first and only used against another nation in warfare. These two bombs killed approximately 120,000 to 140,000 people in a matter of minutes, and as many as a result of nuclear radiation in the following weeks, months and years. The bombs killed as many as 140,000 people in Hiroshima and 80,000 in Nagasaki by the end of 1945. =Re-entry of the Soviet Union= In spite of Soviet‚ÄìJapanese Neutrality Pact, at the Yalta agreement in February 1945, the US, the UK, and the USSR had agreed that the USSR would enter the war on Japan within three months of the defeat of Germany in Europe. This Soviet‚ÄìJapanese War led to the fall of Japan's Manchurian occupation, Soviet occupation of South Sakhalin island, and a real, imminent threat of Soviet invasion of the home islands of Japan. This was a significant factor for some internal parties in the Japanese decision to surrender to the USRacing the Enemy: Stalin, Truman, and the Surrender of Japan Tsuyoshi Hasegawa Belknap Press (Oct. 30 2006) and gain some protection, rather than face simultaneous Soviet invasion as well as defeat by the US. Likewise, the superior numbers of the armies of the Soviet Union in Europe was a factor in the US decision to demonstrate the use of atomic weapons to the USSR, just as the Allied victory in Europe was evolving into division of Germany and Berlin, the division of Europe with the Iron Curtain and the subsequent Cold War. Surrender and occupation of Japan Imperial Japanese Diet on 1 November 1945, the end of the Second World War. In the foreground there are several Allied soldiers watching the proceedings from the back of the balcony. Having ignored (mokusatsu) the Potsdam Declaration, the Empire of Japan surrendered and ended World War II, after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the declaration of war by the Soviet Union. In a national radio address on August 15, Emperor Hirohito announced the surrender to the Japanese people by Gyokuon-h≈çs≈ç. A period known as Occupied Japan followed after the war, largely spearheaded by United States General of the Army Douglas MacArthur to revise the Japanese constitution and de-militarize Japan. The Allied occupation, with economic and political assistance, continued well into the 1950s. Allied forces ordered Japan to abolish the Meiji Constitution and enforce the Constitution of Japan, then rename the Empire of Japan as Japan on May 3, 1947. Japan adopted a parliamentary-based political system, while the Emperor changed to symbolic status. American General of the Army Douglas MacArthur later commended the new Japanese government that he helped establish and the new Japanese period when he was about to send the American forces to the Korean War: > The Japanese people, since the war, have undergone the greatest reformation > recorded in modern history. With a commendable will, eagerness to learn, and > marked capacity to understand, they have, from the ashes left in war's wake, > erected in Japan an edifice dedicated to the supremacy of individual liberty > and personal dignity; and in the ensuing process there has been created a > truly representative government committed to the advance of political > morality, freedom of economic enterprise, and social justice. Politically, > economically, and socially Japan is now abreast of many free nations of the > earth and will not again fail the universal trust. ... I sent all four of > our occupation divisions to the Korean battlefront without the slightest > qualms as to the effect of the resulting power vacuum upon Japan. The > results fully justified my faith. I know of no nation more serene, orderly, > and industrious, nor in which higher hopes can be entertained for future > constructive service in the advance of the human race. For historian John W. Dower: > In retrospect, apart from the military officer corps, the purge of alleged > militarists and ultranationalists that was conducted under the Occupation > had relatively small impact on the long-term composition of men of influence > in the public and private sectors. The purge initially brought new blood > into the political parties, but this was offset by the return of huge > numbers of formerly purged conservative politicians to national as well as > local politics in the early 1950s.

In 1938, there were 309,000 Japanese in Taiwan. By the end of World War II, there were over 850,000 Japanese in Korea The Life Instability of Intermarried Japanese Women in Korea and more than 2 million in China,Killing of Chinese in Japan concerned, China Daily most of whom were farmers in Manchukuo (the Japanese had a plan to bring in 5 million Japanese settlers into Manchukuo). Prasenjit Duara: The New Imperialism and the Post-Colonial Developmental State: Manchukuo in comparative perspective In the census of December 1939, the total population of the South Seas Mandate was 129,104, of which 77,257 were Japanese. By December 1941, Saipan had a population of more than 30,000 people, including 25,000 Japanese. There were over 400,000 people living on Karafuto (southern Sakhalin) when the Soviet offensive began in early August 1945. Most were of Japanese or Korean extraction. When Japan lost the Kuril Islands, 17,000 Japanese were expelled, most from the southern islands. After World War II, most of these overseas Japanese repatriated to Japan. The Allied powers repatriated over 6 million Japanese nationals from colonies throughout Asia.When Empire Comes Home : Repatriation and Reintegration in Postwar Japan by Lori Watt, Harvard University Press On the other hand, some remained overseas involuntarily, as in the case of orphans in China or prisoners of war captured by the Red Army and forced to work in Siberia. War crimes Many political and military Japanese leaders were convicted for war crimes before the Tokyo tribunal and other Allied tribunals in Asia. However, all members of the imperial family implicated in the war, such as Emperor Sh≈çwa, were exonerated from criminal prosecutions by Douglas MacArthur. The Japanese military before and during World War II committed numerous atrocities against civilian and military personnel. Its surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, prior to a declaration of war and without warning killed 2,403 neutral military personnel and civilians and wounded 1,247 others. Large scale massacres, rapes, and looting against civilians were committed, most notably the Sook Ching and the Nanjing Massacre, and the use of around 200,000 \\"comfort women\\", who were said to be forced to serve as prostitutes for the Japanese military. The Imperial Japanese Army also engaged in the execution and harsh treatment of Allied military personnel and POWs. Biological experiments were conducted by Unit 731 on prisoners of war as well as civilians; this included the use of biological and chemical weapons authorized by Emperor Sh≈çwa himself.Yoshiaki Yoshimi and Seiya Matsuno, Dokugasusen Kankei Shiry≈ç II (Materials on poison gas Warfare II), Kaisetsu, H≈çkan 2, J≈´gonen sens√¥ gokuhi shiry≈çsh≈´, Funi Shuppankan, 1997, pp. 25‚Äì29 According to the 2002 International Symposium on the Crimes of Bacteriological Warfare, the number of people killed in Far East Asia by Japanese germ warfare and human experiments was estimated to be around 580,000.Daniel Barenblatt, A Plague upon Humanity, 2004, pp. xii, 173.

It was designed by Department of Public Works (Queensland) and built from 1901 to 1939. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 April 2017.  History  Located two kilometres northeast of the Brisbane CBD, New Farm State School was established in 1901 to meet the educational needs of the growing suburban community. It retains an urban brick school building (1901, extended 1909, 1939); an open-air annexe (1919); and a World War I Memorial (1923); set in landscaped grounds, with sporting facilities; early retaining walls (pre-1940) and mature trees. The school has a strong and ongoing association with the New Farm community. Originally the lands of the Turrbul and Jagera people, European settlement began at New Farm when a farm was established to supply the convict settlement founded on the present site of the Brisbane CBD in 1825. In October 1843, after the convict settlement closed, Government surveyor Henry Wade began surveying the land between Fortitude Valley and the Brisbane River into large allotments. Following their sale from 1844, residences were established. Subdivision into smaller allotments occurred in the 1880s when Brisbane's population more than doubled due to immigration.New Farm Library, BCC Library Service, A Short History of New Farm, p. 1'Proclamation', New South Wales Government Gazette (NSWGG), 30 Jan 1844, pp. 197-8;'Proclamation', NSWGG, 7 Nov 1848, Issue No 126, p. 1624'Proclamation', NSWGG, 30 Jan 1853, pp. 943Plan of the City and Environs of Brisbane, County of Stanley, Queensland, 1865John Laverty, The Making of a Metropolis: Brisbane 1823-1925, Boolarong Press and Brisbane History Group, 2009, pp. 18, 43.

The need for a state school at New Farm resulted from extensive urbanisation and population growth in the area in the final decades of the 19th century. Improved transportation with the opening of an electric tramline down Brunswick Street in 1897, and industrial development, such as the CSR Refinery) in 1893 and the first Teneriffe Wharf in 1907, made New Farm a popular residential area.New Farm Library, Brisbane City Council (BCC) Library Service, A Short History of New Farm, p. 3Laverty, The Making of a Metropolis, p. 45'Electric Tramways, New Farm Service', The Telegraph, 22 Sep 1897, p. 4. The establishment of schools was considered an essential step in the development of new communities and integral to their success. Locals often donated land and labour for a school's construction and the school community contributed to maintenance and development. Schools became a community focus, a symbol of progress, and a source of pride, with enduring connections formed with past pupils, parents, and teachers.Project Services, \\"Mount Morgan State High School\\" in Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report, for Education Queensland, 2008, pp.4-5Paul Burmester, Margaret Pullar and Michael Kennedy, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, a report for the Department of Education, 1996, pp.87-8. In 1899, the Department of Public Instruction approved a request for the establishment of a school at New Farm, for which residents agreed to contribute one sixth of the cost of the erection of the new state school. Acting on the Department's behalf, the chairman of the New Farm State School Building Committee, businessman Thomas Welsby, secured land for the school site from a number of owners, at a cost of ¬£1087.New Farm State School Parents and Citizens' Centenary Committee, New Farm State School 1901-2001, New Farm State School Parents and Citizens' Centenary Committee, Brisbane, 2001, p. 8 Plans were approved in 1900 and the contractor, Thomas Hirons, commenced work in May 1900.

In the first decades of the 20th century the Queensland Government implemented a campaign of construction of large public buildings. This included substantial brick or timber school buildings. Brick school buildings were far less frequently built than those of timber - being only used in prosperous urban or suburban areas with stable or rapidly increasing populations. Like Queensland's private schools, technical colleges and schools of arts, all brick school buildings were individually designed with variation in style, size, and form. They were given generous budgets, resulting in impressive edifices. Light and ventilation was still a primary concern for the architects but, compared to contemporary standard education buildings, they had a grander character and greater landmark attributes.Burmester, et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, pp.18, 99QSA, Item ID 13693, Deputy Govt Architect, \\"Preliminary Estimate of Modified Plan - New State School Ascot\\", 9 May 1919.

John McMaster; the Under Secretary for Public Instruction, John G Anderson; Chief Inspector, David Ewart; Chairman of the school committee, Thomas Welsby; all committee members; Head Teacher, Arthur Outridge; and a large number of local children and parents in attendance.New Farm State School Parents and Citizens' Centenary Committee, New Farm State School 1901-2001, p. 8'New Farm State School', The Brisbane Courier, 25 Jan 1901, p. 4'New Farm School', The Telegraph, 21 Jan 1901, p. 3. However, the school building was inadequate to accommodate the immediate school population, which reached 650 by 1903. Consequently, classes were held on the verandahs and under the school building. To address the need for larger play grounds, two adjoining 16-perch allotments were purchased in 1905. For some years this area was used as a rifle range by the school cadets. An additional classroom was added to the eastern end of both the northeastern and southwestern wings of the building in 1909, at a cost of ¬£1,189. These extensions were designed to match the existing structure, being red brick with stone and buff dressings. Each comprised a classroom with verandahs. A plan dated September 1912 detailed alterations to undercroft archway enclosures, including new sashes, six-light casements and part-glazed double doors, which were part of improvements, repairs and internal painting to \\"basement\\" classrooms.New Farm State School, 75 Years: New Farm State School, n.p.Project Services, \\"New Farm State School\\", p. 6Department of Public Works (DPW), aperture card, 56M-9-5, \\"New Farm State School Improvements etc.\\", 12 September 1912DPW, Annual Report of the DPW for the year ended 30 June 1913, p. 18. As enrolments climbed sharply to 918 pupils in 1917, the need arose for a dedicated infants school to overcome overcrowding. This was achieved with the building of an open-air annexe (now called Block B) in 1918-19, after two adjacent allotments with residences were purchased for ¬£1200 to provide sufficient grounds. The open- air annexe, constructed at a cost of ¬£1,813, was opened on 15 February 1919 by the Minister for Education, Herbert Hardacre. The building was positioned to the southeast of the urban brick school building. Set on brick piers, the highset timber building contained two large classrooms, a verandah to the northwest and an attached teachers room. It had a Dutch gable roof of asbestos slates. Its southeastern, southwestern and northeastern sides were open above balustrade level, and the posts and valances to those elevations were of decorative timber.'New Farm Infants Annexe Opened', The Daily Mail. 17 Feb 1919, p. 2Queensland State Archives (QSA), ID 15668, \\"New Farm SS 1913-43\\", Letter Under Secretary and Government Architect to the Under Secretary, Department of Public Instruction, 24 April 1918Project Services, \\"New Farm State School\\", p. 7ePlan, DPW drawing 13135012, Brisbane, New Farm State School: New Open Air Annexe, 1918. Open-air annexes were introduced as a standard design in 1913 by the Department of Public Works.Although experimentation with \\"open-air\\" buildings started as early as the 1890s. This design was developed in response to the contemporary medical belief that adequate ventilation and high levels of natural light were needed for health; coupled with the need to build cheap, portable schools. The open-air annexe type achieved maximum ventilation and natural light. It contained one large room with only one wall, the western verandah wall. The other sides were open, with only adjustable canvas blinds for enclosure. Ideally, they were high-set, thereby increasing the ventilation and providing further shelter underneath.Burmester, et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, pp.24-26. Many open-air annexes were constructed across Queensland, but they proved to be inadequate and were discontinued in 1923. The open sides provided limited weather protection and climate control, and the canvas blinds deteriorated quickly. All open-air annexes in Queensland were modified to provide better enclosure.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, p.41. Accordingly, the blinds of New Farm State School's open-air annexe were replaced by sliding sash windows in 1924.Project Services, New Farm State School, p. 8. Enclosure of the verandahs took place in 1924. A war memorial to commemorate the 24 former New Farm State School students who had died during World War I, was organised by the school community and unveiled by the Governor of Queensland, Sir Matthew Nathan, on 2 February 1923. Located in the southwest corner of the school grounds, the memorial comprised a red face brick pillar with a concrete cap, upon which a flag pole was fixed. On two sides of the pillar were marble tablets inscribed with the names of the students who died during World War I; with stone laurel wreaths on the other sides. Radiating out from the column were four face brick plinths, aligned with the cardinal points and set at a lower height to the pillar. Into each, a drinking fountain and basin was set. The memorial was erected by Lowther and Sons, Monumental Masons, of Brisbane.'WWI Memorial', Brisbane Courier, 3 Feb 1923, p. 8'WWI Memorial, The Week, 9 Feb 1923, p. 15Memorial Fountain, New Farm', The Week, 9 Feb 1923, p. 15QSA, Item ID 15668, correspondence, Lowther & Sons, Monumental Sculptors, Brisbane to S Johnson, Honorary Secretary, New Farm State School, 1922. An important component of Queensland state schools was their grounds. The early and continuing commitment to play-based education, particularly in primary school, resulted in the provision of outdoor play space and sporting facilities, such as ovals and tennis courts. Arbor Day celebrations began in Queensland in 1890 with trees and gardens planted to shade and beautify schools. Aesthetically designed gardens were encouraged by regional inspectors, and educators believed gardening and Arbor Days instilled in young minds the value of hard work and activity, improved classroom discipline, developed aesthetic tastes, and inspired people to stay on the land.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, pp. 4, 48-9. At New Farm State School, a tennis court was constructed in the southeast corner of the school grounds by September 1928. By 1931 a retaining wall at the eastern boundary had been erected and in 1935 retaining walls and fences were erected along the Hawthorne and Heal Streets' boundary. Other early retaining walls were erected in the school grounds before 1940, such as those adjacent to the tennis court. By 1936 trees were planted to the west of the tennis court and along the southwest boundary of the school grounds, facing James and Heal Streets.'The Post Office', The Week, 7 Sep 1928, p. 38'New Farm State School Committee', Daily Standard, 10 Feb 1930, p. 2Project Services, ePlan Drawing No 13134968 New Farm SS Excavation Relief WorkQSA, Item 583715, Architectural plans, Drawing New Farm State School retaining walls, 1935Department of Natural Resources and Mines (DNRM), aerial ADA6-5887, 20 April 1936. The Great Depression, commencing in 1929 and extending well into the 1930s, caused a dramatic reduction of building work in Queensland and brought private building work to a standstill. In response, the Queensland Government provided relief work for unemployed Queenslanders, and also embarked on an ambitious and important building programme to provide impetus to the economy.'Labor at the Helm', The Worker, 20 Jul 1932, p. 8'Queensland Parliament', The Northern Miner, 17 Aug 1932, p. 2'Public Buildings', Daily Mercury, 19 Oct 1933, p. 7DPW, Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1934, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1934, pp. 6-8DPW, Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1935, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1935, p. 2Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1936, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1936, p. 2'State will spend over ¬£460,000: big building plans', The Courier- Mail, 28 Dec 1933, p. 9Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1939, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1939, p. 2. Even before the October 1929 stock market crash, the Queensland Government had initiated an Unemployment Relief Scheme, through a work programme by the Department of Public Works. This included painting and repairs to school buildings. By mid-1930 men were undertaking grounds improvement works to schools under the scheme. Extensive funding was given for improvements to school grounds, including fencing and levelling ground for play areas, terracing and retaining walls. This work created many large school ovals, which prior to this period were mostly cleared of trees but not landscaped. These play areas became a standard inclusion within Queensland state schools and a characteristic element. At New Farm State School, relief workers dug rock from the Hawthorne Street side of the grounds to create a level play area for the children .'Relief of unemployment: big programme contemplated', The Telegraph, 24 July 1929, p. 5'Unemployment: the relief scheme', The Telegraph, 26 July 1929, p.5'Report of the Department of Public Works for the year ended 30 Jun 1930', p. 15Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, p. 58New Farm State School Parents and Citizens' Centenary Committee, New Farm State School 1901-2001, p. 11ePlan, DPW Drawing 13134968, New Farm SS Excavation Relief Work, 10 July 1931Project Services, \\"New Farm State School\\", p. 8. After the addition of the second storey, 1940 In 1939 further additions to the school were made to accommodate the growing student population. A second storey was added to the northwest and southwest wings of the urban brick school building, comprising five classrooms with adjacent hat and cloak rooms. A new teachers room on the first floor and head teachers room on the ground floor were also constructed. Lighting and ventilation was improved as windows, fanlights and doors were altered or replaced. A larger play space was created when the entire understory was cleared of walls and partitions, with the exception of the girls' lavatory. The total cost of this work was ¬£5430.ePlan, DPW Drawing 13134935, Additional Storey, 16 Nov 1938'Larger School at New Farm', The Courier Mail, 1939, p. 5Project Services, \\"New Farm State School\\", p. 7. Like many Queensland state schools, New Farm was affected by World War II (WWII). Due to the fear of a Japanese invasion, the Queensland Government closed all coastal state schools in January 1942, and although most schools reopened on 2 March 1942, student attendance was optional until the war ended. Major alterations, renovations and additions to most schools in Queensland halted and New Farm State School undertook only necessary maintenance until the war ended in 1945.New Farm State School, 75 Years - New Farm State School, p. 5. The post-WWII period was a time of enormous population growth Australia-wide and was accompanied by a shortage of building materials. The Department of Public Instruction was largely unprepared for the exponential demand for state education that began in the late 1940s and continued well into the 1960s. This was a nationwide occurrence resulting from immigration and the unprecedented population growth now termed the \\"baby boom\\". Queensland schools were overcrowded and, to cope, many new buildings were constructed and existing buildings were extended. At New Farm State School the two classrooms of the open-air annexe were divided into four and its windows were altered to include fixed panels and casements in 1949. A tuckshop and a library were also created within the existing urban brick school building in the 1950s. In 1958, folding partitions were installed in three classrooms in the southwest wing to provide a space for school assemblies.Project Services, Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report, for Education Queensland, January 2008, pp. 28-31Project Services, New Farm State School, p. 8New Farm State School Parents and Citizens' Centenary Committee, New Farm State School 1901-2001, pp. 9, 15. Fundraising by parents and friends of the school resulted in the building of a swimming pool, sited southeast of the open-air annexe, which opened on 29 October 1966. The urban brick school building was altered during the 1970s. The outer verandahs of all three wings were enclosed with flat sheeting, louvres and sliding windows: beginning with the southwest wing in 1971; followed by the northeast wing in 1977; and finally the northwest wing in 1979.Project Services, \\"New Farm State School\\", p. 8New Farm State School Parents and Citizens' Centenary Committee, New Farm State School 1901-2001, p. 9. Other alterations at the school included the renovation and re-roofing of the open-air annexe in 1972. The largest addition to the school was the construction of a pre-school, sited on the corner of Annie and Hawthorne Streets, in 1976.New Farm State School, 75 Years - New Farm State School, n.p.New Farm State School Parents and Citizens' Centenary Committee, New Farm State School 1901-2001, p. 10. Sometime after the World War I Memorial's unveiling, the drinking fountains were removed, but it retained a flag pole, the original carved wreaths and the memorial tablets. The lack of a sports oval at New Farm State School, an important feature of Queensland schools, was redressed in 1991. The Department of Education secured adjacent land to the northeast from the Department of Main Roads. This land had been resumed for construction of a proposed central freeway to a bridge linking New Farm with Norman Park. Removal of houses and the partial closure of Hawthorne Street occurred in 1989. In March 1991 the official handover of the new school oval occurred, and in June pupils planted 30 trees around the oval.New Farm State School Parents and Citizens' Centenary Committee, New Farm State School 1901-2001, p. 11. The 1990s were a period of low pupil numbers at the school, falling to 167 in 1997. This resulted from the decline of industrial and commercial enterprises in the area as they closed or relocated; and to the suburb's changing demographic as older houses were demolished to make way for blocks of units, which were not favoured by families. However, through initiatives such as the urban renewal and Building Better Schools programs, enrolments increased to 247 by 2001.New Farm State School Parents and Citizens' Centenary Committee, New Farm State School 1901-2001, p. 7. Since opening in 1901, New Farm State School has served the community and provided a venue for events, such as school fetes, dances and social committee meetings.'New Farm School Fete', The Brisbane Courier, 13 May 1930, p. 21'Dance at New Farm School', The Telegraph, 1 Oct 1938, p. 13 The publication of school histories recognised the New Farm State School's 75th and 100th anniversaries in 1976 and 2001. The school retains early furniture items in the former Head Teachers Room. These are: a silky oak memorial cupboard dedicated to FJB Marin (Head Teacher 1922-23), a silky oak medicine cabinet and an early safe. There are also honour boards (the earliest from 1901), and an early school bell on the southwestern verandah of the eastern wing. In 2017, the school continues to operate from its original site. It retains its urban brick school building and open-air annexe, set in landscaped grounds with sporting facilities, playing areas, retaining walls and mature shade trees. New Farm State School is important to its suburban district as a key social focus for the community, as generations of students have been taught there and many social events have been held in the school's grounds and buildings since its establishment.  Description  Site plan, 2016 New Farm State School occupies a site in a residential area of the suburb of New Farm, approximately northeast of the Brisbane CBD. The school occupies a levelled site on formerly steeply-sloping terrain, and is primarily accessed from Heal Street to the northwest. It is bounded on other sides by James Street to the southwest, Annie Street to the southeast, Kingsholme Street to the northeast, and is bordered by residential properties to the southeast and northeast. A cul-de-sac terminating Hawthorne Street to the southeast provides a secondary access point to the grounds. The school comprises a small complex of buildings, with the most prominent being an urban brick school building (Block A, 1901, extended 1908-09 and 1939) at the western corner of the site, fronting Heal Street. To the southeast of this is an Open Air Annexe (Block B, 1919, extended 1972). The school grounds are well established and contain mature trees and landscaping features, such as pre-1940 retaining walls, a playing field, a school bell and various early furniture items. = Urban brick school building (Block A) = The urban brick school building is a substantial timber and masonry structure, comprising three wings in a U-shape configuration around a central teachers room and small courtyard. The main northwest (central) wing fronts Heal Street, and is linked at its southern and eastern corners to the other two wings, which extend in a south-easterly direction. The central and southwest wings have two storeys of classrooms and the northeast wing has a single storey. All wings have an undercroft, which contains largely open play space. The building is constructed of load-bearing, red face brick walls laid in a Flemish bond; and features contrasting bands and voussoirs of a lighter, cream-coloured face brick. The Dutch-gable roofs of each wing are clad in corrugated metal sheeting and have ventilated gablets. Two sets of dormer windows are located in the north-facing roof plane of the northeast wing. The central wing features a prominent roof fleche in the centre of the roof, in the form of an octagonal ogee roof supported by miniature columns and topped by a finial. Most soffits are lined with v-jointed (VJ) timber boards. Each wing has verandahs on their inward and outward-facing sides. The connected inward-facing verandahs provide access to the classrooms and circulation between the wings. Vertical circulation is provided by several sets of stairs of various dates, which are generally connected to or located within the verandahs. Early stairs and stair configurations include external timber staircases at each end of the inward- facing verandah of the central wing (by 1938), and an internal concrete staircase at the eastern corner of the southwest wing (1938). Most inward- facing verandahs have square timber posts with timber post and rail balustrades, and timber and concrete floors. The first floor verandahs have flat, corrugated metal-lined ceilings, except for the northeast wing which has exposed decorative rafters and timber beaded board ceilings. The second floor verandahs have raked ceilings lined with timber beaded boards. All outward- facing verandahs have been enclosed with timber weatherboards, flat metal sheeting and louvre windows (s). Non-significant elements of the verandahs include modern floor linings and the 1970s verandah enclosures. The undercroft level is largely open play space and features semi-circular brick arches and columns, all with rounded corners to above head-height. The floors are concrete slabs. The central wing undercroft has been enclosed to form a classroom/teaching space and toilets, with some early timber infill partitions and windows surviving within arches along the northwest side and enclosing the toilets. Sections of the northeast and southwest wings have been enclosed to form a tuckshop and storage spaces, with some early timber partitions surviving. Recent partitions and roller doors in the undercroft are not of heritage significance. The first floor internal layout is symmetrical, and the second floor layout of the central and southwest wings essentially mirrors the first floor below. The central wing comprises two classrooms on each level, bookended by former hat and cloak rooms (the northeast rooms have been converted into a stairwell, the southwest rooms are used as office/teachers rooms). The first and second floor teachers rooms, which project into the central courtyard, remain intact, and an early sink is located on the verandah wall of the first floor teachers room. The two southwest wing levels comprise two classrooms at the northwest end, separated from a third classroom at the southeast end by a hallway (former hat and cloak room) linking the inward and outward-facing verandahs. Modifications to the second floor level of this wing include the removal of the southeast wall of the hallway (to create a larger classroom) and removal of sections of the southwest verandah wall. The northeast wing contains a large room (used as a library in 2017) at the northwest end, and a southwest classroom that incorporates the former hallway space (which has had its southeast wall removed). Most internal spaces have plastered walls with VJ timber-clad interior partitions and timber picture rails. The ceilings of the first floor classrooms are flat and lined with flat sheeting with painted timber battens. Bulkheads are exposed within the classrooms, and the northeast wing features decorative ceiling roses. The second floor ceilings are generally coved, with the exception of the teachers room which is flat, and are lined with beaded timber boards. Most early timber joinery survives, including: double-hung sashes with awning fanlights to verandahs; casements with awning fanlights to gable end walls; casements to stairwells; arched windows to the undercroft of the central wing; dormer windows to the northeast wing; panelled double doors with stop-chamfered detailing and awning fanlights above (many retaining early hardware); panelled, folding timber door partitions between some classrooms in the central and southwest wings; and half-glazed partitions within the southwest wing. Most windows have wide concrete sills and lintels. Timber-framed, corrugated metal-clad window hoods shelter windows on the southeast elevations of the northeast and southwest wings. Tall window openings on the southeast elevation of the northeast wing have had their sashes replaced. Early timber furniture and honour boards are retained within the building, including: a silky oak memorial cupboard dedicated to FJB Marin (Head Teacher 1922-23), a silky oak medicine cabinet and an early safe within the teachers room, various honour boards (with the earliest dating back to 1901), and an early metal school bell on the southwestern verandah of the eastern wing. A foundation stone plaque is set into the northwest end wall of the northeast wing. = Open-air annexe (Block B) = The open-air annexe is a highset, timber-framed building, located southeast of Block A and orientated perpendicular to James Street. It stands on tall brick piers and is clad in weatherboards. Both the Dutch-gable main roof and smaller gable roof over the teachers room (extended 1972), which projects from the centre of the northwest elevation, are clad in corrugated metal sheeting. The gablets feature louvered timber vents and the gable end of the teachers room has decorative batten infill attached to the bargeboards. The soffits are lined in flat sheeting. An enclosed verandah runs along the northwest side of the building, accessed via timber stairs on either side of the teachers room. Weatherboard cladding and banks of timber-framed louvre windows (1972) enclose former large openings in the northeast, southeast and southwest walls. The undercroft of the building is largely open play space, with some recent enclosures forming storage spaces and offices. It has a concrete slab floor and the floor framing of the storey above is exposed. The piers are constructed from variegated face brick, and those supporting the addition to the teachers room are of orange brick. All recent undercroft enclosures, including timber battened screens, are not of cultural heritage significance. The verandah has a raked, VJ timber board-lined ceiling (which flattens adjacent the teachers room); square timber posts; and timber floors. The verandah wall is single-skin with externally-exposed timber stud- framing and lined internally with tongue-and-groove (T&G;), VJ timber boards. Hinged ventilation boards survive at the base of verandah walls. At the ends of the verandah are former hat rooms which have been enclosed by partition walls to form a store room (northeast end) and an entry to a classroom (southwest end). Non-significant elements of the verandah include modern linoleum floor linings; added partitions, and bag racks and louvres enclosing the verandah. The teachers room is accessed from the verandah and contains a single room. The walls and flat ceiling are lined in VJ timber boards. The former location of the northwestern end wall (prior to the 1972 extension) is clearly identifiable through a break in the ceiling lining. The main interior is divided by recent partitions into four classrooms (formerly two). The classroom spaces feature coved ceilings lined in VJ timber boards, exposed metal tie rods, and timber floors. Most walls are lined in VJ timber boards, although the lower sections of the northeast, southeast and southwest walls are lined in flat sheeting (indicating the extent of former openings). Surviving timber joinery within the building includes: double-hung sash windows with centre-pivoting fanlights to the verandah wall; high-level and wide centre-pivoting windows to the verandah wall; and casement windows to the northwest and southwest elevations of the teachers room. Corrugated metal- clad, timber-framed window hoods with decorative cheeks shelter the windows to the teachers room, and a panelled timber door to the teachers room has been retained. Non-significant elements of the interior include the partitions (including folding doors) between classrooms, and modern louvre windows, doors, and carpet and wall linings. = World War I Memorial = War memorial, 1940 A concrete and brick World War I (WWI) Memorial stands in the western corner of the site on a circular concrete slab. The memorial comprises a square, red brick pillar with a white-painted concrete cap topped by a metal flagpole. The pillar cap has the words \\"IN LOVING MEMORY OF SCHOLARS WHO FELL IN THE GREAT WAR\\" marked in black lettering around the sides. Fixed to the pillar on the eastern and western sides are marble tablets, inscribed with the names of New Farm State School students who died during WWI. Stone laurel wreaths adorn the northern and southern sides. Extending from all four sides of the pillar are low brick plinths capped with concrete, which are aligned with the cardinal points. A small concrete and sandstone plaque in between the southern and western plinths is a recent addition. A surrounding open lawn area, edged by gardens and trees, forms an attractive setting for the memorial. = Landscape Elements = The school grounds are well established and include mature trees and early retaining walls (pre-1940). Due to its elevation, the James Street side of the site has impressive views toward Brisbane City. Several mature figs (Ficus sp.) and camphor laurels (Cinnamomum camphora) stand between the open-air annexe and James Street, and at the western end of the Heal Street boundary. Pre-1940 retaining walls which stand: to the southeast of the Open Air Annexe (1931); northeast of the urban brick school building, along the Heal Street boundary and the former Hawthorne Street boundary (1935); and along the James Street boundary adjacent to the former tennis court site, are concrete. Other retaining walls constructed from cut stone, stone blocks and concrete are located along the James Street and Heal Street boundaries. = Non-Significant Elements = A swimming pool southeast of the open-air annexe; playing field northeast of the urban brick school building; preschool southeast of the swimming pool; and all other buildings, structures and pathways within the heritage boundary are not of heritage significance.  Heritage listing  New Farm State School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 April 2017 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. New Farm State School (established in 1901) is important in demonstrating the evolution of state education and its associated architecture in Queensland. The place retains fine, representative examples of government designs, which were architectural responses to prevailing government educational philosophies, and a war memorial, set in landscaped grounds with sporting facilities, early retaining walls, and mature trees. The urban brick school building (1901, 1909) represents the culmination of years of experimentation with natural light, classroom size and ventilation by the Department of Public Works (DPW) and also demonstrates the growing preference in the early 20th century for constructing brick school buildings at metropolitan schools in developing suburbs. The second floor additions to two wings of the urban brick school building (1939) and playground levelling () are the result of the Queensland Government's building and relief work programmes during the 1930s, which stimulated the economy and provided work for men unemployed as a result of the Great Depression. The open-air annexe (1919) demonstrates the medical and educational theories of the period, which valued fresh air and sunlight; and is important in demonstrating the development pattern of incorporating open-air classrooms into existing school complexes. The enclosure of the annexe in the 1920s demonstrates adaptions to the open-air classroom type to improve its functionality. The World War I Memorial (1923) is important in demonstrating the school community's involvement in this major world event. War memorials are a tribute from the community to those who served and those who died. They are an important element of Queensland's towns and cities and are also important in demonstrating a common pattern of commemoration across Queensland and Australia. The large, suburban site with mature trees and sporting facilities demonstrates educational philosophies that promoted the importance of play and a beautiful environment in the education of children. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. New Farm State School is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of Queensland state schools with later modifications. These include: teaching buildings constructed to standard and individual designs; and generous, landscaped sites with mature trees, assembly and play areas, retaining walls and sporting facilities. The urban brick school building is an excellent, intact example of its type. The building demonstrates the principal characteristics of an urban brick school building through its highset form; linear layout, with classrooms and teachers rooms accessed by verandahs; undercrofts used as open play spaces and additional classrooms; loadbearing, masonry construction, with face brick piers to undercroft spaces; gable or Dutch-gable roofs with roof fleches; and decorative timbers to verandahs, window hoods and gablets. It demonstrates use of the stylistic features of its era, which determined roof form, decorative treatment and joinery. Typically, urban brick school buildings are configured to create central courtyards, and are located in suburban areas that were growing at the time of their construction. The open-air annexe is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of its type. It retains its highset, timber-framed structure on brick piers; classroom widths; western verandah (now enclosed); and semi-detached teachers room. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The urban brick school building at New Farm State School has aesthetic significance due to its beautiful attributes: symmetrical layout; high quality materials, face brick exterior, elegant composition, finely crafted timber work, and decorative treatments. Sited on high ground above James Street, the school has extensive views across surrounding suburbs and to the Brisbane CBD. Attractive views of the school buildings are attained from the east. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Schools have always played an important part in Queensland communities. They typically retain significant and enduring connections with former pupils, parents, and teachers; provide a venue for social interaction and volunteer work; and are a source of pride, symbolising local progress and aspirations. New Farm State School has a strong and ongoing association with the New Farm and district community. It was established in 1901 through the fundraising efforts of the local community and generations of children have been taught there. The place is important for its contribution to the educational development of New Farm and is a prominent focal point and gathering place for social and commemorative events with widespread community support.

Caruana's The Other Woman series, made in 2005, uses portraits she made of mistresses ‚Äî women who have had affairs with married men. Her Fairytale for Sale series (and the book ONO) is about women who sell their wedding dresses online. Using email, Caruana posed as a potential buyer and the women sent her photographs of them wearing their dress, in which they obscured their and their partner's face. They also provided a description of why they were selling the dress, which partially describes why they obscured the faces. Caruana used both the photographs and text in her work. Her Married Man series is about infidelity. Caruana posed on dating websites aimed at men seeking affairs. She went on 80 dates with 54 men in 2008 and 2009, deceptively making snapshot photographs and secretly recording audio. Publications=Publications by Caruana= *ONO. London: Here, 2012.

Synopsis  Pretty Maida Lovell, secretary to war department executive Steve Blake, stops by Christine Blake's house (his widowed sister-in-law) where he is living and has his home office. She is to pick up some notes for his radio speech later that evening. She is in love with him, and jealous that Blake has been spending time with Christine's elegant penthouse-lifestyle sister, Angela Favor. She encounters - and rebuffs - prissy Walsh Rantoul in the house, who is mixing drinks and coming on to her. She goes upstairs to retrieve the notes, and Blake stops in at the same time. After Blake departs for his meeting, Maida goes downstairs to find Blake gone and Rantoul dead in the kitchen. It looks like Blake has murdered him, since they had words earlier. A stranger who calls himself \\"Smith\\" enters. In order to protect Blake from discovery, he offers to dispose of Rantoul's body and the evidence, if Maida will find information about airplane movements for him. The information he asks for is to be public knowledge anyway, so she complies. Now she is trapped. Smith is obviously an enemy spy and he has a hold on Maida to find out more and more intelligence on wartime materiel and personnel movements.

An anime television series adaptation by Lerche aired in Japan from July to September 2018. Plot The series centers on Hanako, Olivia and Kasumi, second year students at an all-girls middle school and the only three members of the Pastimers Club, a not officially recognized club. The club has very ambiguous goals, usually consisting of whatever so-called \\"pastimes\\" the girls happen to think up. Characters ; : :Hanako is Olivia and Kasumi's classmate who is extremely energetic, dragging both of them into her pace by playing strange games at school. Despite her childish nature, she is shown to be highly intelligent in her academics and is a natural talent in sports, although she has no interest in them. Her family is shown to have some of wealthy or noble connection as she is able to obtain objects upon request. ; : :Olivia is Hanako and Kasumi's classmate who pretends to be an American transfer student despite having only been born and raised in Japan with foreign parents. Thus, she pretends to speak in broken Japanese to keep her image while gradually getting better to solidify her act. ; : :Kasumi is Olivia and Hanako's classmate who dislikes playing games due to her sister's constant teasing when she was younger. She is very bad at English. She enjoys writing BL fantasies, though ironically, she is extremely androphobic. ; : :Chisato is a female teacher who is blackmailed into becoming the advisor for the Pastimers Club. She often feels downhearted over not being able to find a husband. ; : :Maeda is Hanako's family butler. Due to being probed by aliens, he is capable of firing laser beams out of his butt. He can quickly build or procure any item that Hanako asks for, from an inflatable kiddie pool to a robot that speaks in pre-programmed English phrases. ; : :She is a quiet, bespectacled girl whose real name has not been revealed. Despite her timid demeanor, she managed to win her position anyway due to her vice president's speech that sounded threatening to the rest of the student body. She constantly throws up procedural barriers for the Pastimers Club, and wavers between trying to be friends with them or undermining their club. She also has a habit of seeming terrifying and condescending when she's actually trying to be compassionate. ; : :Nicknamed R≈´, Oka is the leader of the Occult Research Club who befriends the Pastimers Club, teaching them occult-themed games. ; : :Nicknamed Agrippa, Aguri is Oka's fellow member in the Occult Research Club. She was temporarily out of school for medical reasons. ; : :Tsugumi is a feminine-presenting classmate who the Pastimers suspect of actually being male, especially when Olivia overheard Tsugumi confess they were a boy when breaking up with their boyfriend, leading them to go to great lengths to uncover Tsugumi's true identity. Tsugumi keeps their identity ambiguous and enjoys teasing the club in return, especially Kasumi. ; : :Sainan is the school language teacher who often becomes the hapless victim of the girls' mischief. ; : :Takayanagi is the school guidance councilor who is rather manly in appearance. She has an equally manly younger sister in her third year who is president of the Swimming Club. ; : :Kentar≈ç is Hanako's younger brother. ; : :Olivia's older brother, he is an otaku who has two PhDs.

The regiment traces its origins back to the militia cavalry regiments raised in the colony of Victoria, such as the Royal Volunteer Cavalry Regiment, the Prince of Wales's Light Horse Hussars and the Sandhurst Cavalry Troop.  History  The 19th Light Horse (Victorian Mounted Rifles) was formed in 1911 with its headquarters located at Bendigo and elements drawn from Elmore, Rochester, Echuca, Kerang, Pyramid Hill, Mitiamo, Castlemaine and Kyneton. Following the Federal re-organisation of 1912 the unit was retitled the 17th Light Horse (Victorian Mounted Rifles) and a year later as the 17th (Campaspe) Light Horse. During the First World War militia units were precluded from serving oversees, as a result of the Defence Act 1903, however many members of the 17th volunteered for service with the Australian Imperial Force. Following the war the Australian Light Horse was again reorganised in 1921 and the 17th formed part of the 5th Cavalry Brigade of the 2nd Cavalry Division. This brigade also contained the 4th (Corangamite) Light Horse, 19th (Yarrowee) Light Horse as well as other supporting units. During the 1920s the Australian Light Horse converted from their pre-war mounted rifles role to that of cavalry modelled along British Army lines. In 1927 the 17th underwent another title change and was renamed as the 17th (Bendigo) Light Horse. As a result of the financial pressures in the late 1920s, a number of light horse units were required to amalgamate. The 17th linked with the 19th Light Horse in 1929. The 19th Light Horse was not maintained during the period in which they were linked, with the new unit remaining in the former 17th Light Horse locations. In 1930 the unit was retitled again as the 17th (Prince of Wales‚Äôs) Light Horse. In 1933 the units were de-linked only for them to re-link the following year. In October 1936, the units were unlinked and the 17th became the 17th Light Horse (Machine Gun) Regiment (The Prince of Wales‚Äôs Light Horse). Along with the 1st Armoured Car Regiment, they formed the divisional troops of the 2nd Cavalry Division. As a machine gun regiment they provided fire support with Vickers Medium Machine Guns which were transported via civilian trucks. When the Second World War broke out the CMF was mobilised for continuous training and home defence. During the early period of the war the unit conducted training with its parent division and many members volunteered to join the 2nd Australian Imperial Force. In March 1941 C Squadron of the regiment was provided to form the nucleus of the 4th Armoured Regiment. As part of the wider mechanisation of the Australian Light Horse, the unit was converted to the 17th Motor Regiment in March 1942. It would now provide a motorised infantry capability to the 1st Australian Armoured Division as part of its Support Group. Throughout late 1942 it participated in the divisional exercises in Narrabri. Over the course of November 1942 through February 1943 the unit was attached to the 2nd Australian Armoured Brigade and the 2nd Australian Motor Brigade. However, by early 1943 the strategic threat to Australia from Japan had lessened, which meant that the need for large armoured formations to defend Australia had vanished. As a result, the 17th Motor Regiment was ordered to disband on 13 February 1942. Elements of A Squadron and B Squadron were transferred to the 20th Motor Regiment and C Squadron sent to reinforce the 15th Motor Regiment. Other unit members were transferred to the Australian Army Ordnance Corps as well as various units within the 1st Australian Armoured Division and 3rd Australian Armoured Division. Following the Second World War, the Victorian light horse units of the 5th Cavalry Brigade were perpetuated through the 4th/19th Prince of Wales Light Horse Regiment, a unit of the Royal Australian Armoured Corps.Festberg 1972, p. 16.

Half-A-Room is a 1967 conceptual artwork by the Japanese artist Yoko Ono. Work The work is made from various objects that have been cut in half and painted white. It was made with the help of Ono's second husband, Anthony Cox, and some local art students. The piece was first displayed at Ono's \\"Half-a-Wind\\" exhibition (also called \\"Yoko Plus Me\\") at the Lisson Gallery in West London in 1967. At the Lisson Gallery show the objects were accompanied by a row of glass bottles on a shelf with each bottle containing the words \\"Half a X\\" for each cut up object to represent their respective missing halves. The names in bottles was suggested by John Lennon, with Ono recognizing his contribution semi-anonymously with the inclusion of the label \\"J.L.\\" underneath the bottles. The installation in Ono's 2014 exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao contained: *Half-a-Suitcase *Half-a-Radio *Half-a-Picture *Half-a-Heater *Half-a-Chair *Half-a-Bookshelf *Half-a-Garbage Can *Half-a-Sauce Pan *Half-a-Tea Pot *Half-a-Hat *Half-a-Tea- Kettle *Half-a-Measuring Cup *Half-a-Sack *Half-a-Basket of Flowers *Half-a- High Heeled Shoe *Half-a-Man's Shoe *Half-a-Strainer *Half-a-Plastic Cup *Half-a-Scrub Brush *Half-a-Utensil *Half-a-Compact *Half-a-Plastic Soap Holder *Half-a-Glasses Case *Half-a-Globe Holder *Half-a-Glass Jar *Half-a- Drinking Glass *Half-a-Dresser Half-a-Room was shown at Ono's exhibition from 10 November 2007 to 4 February 2008 at the Centro Cultural Banco do Brasil in S√£o Paulo . History The work was shown at Ono's 1967 Half-a-Wind exhibition at the Lisson Gallery in Paddington, London, from 11 October to 14 November 1967. The cost of the exhibition was underwritten by John Lennon. Ono had been to see Lennon's friend Pete Shotton, who was working for The Beatles company Apple Corps, and had asked to borrow a few thousand pounds to fund the exhibition. Shotton told Ono that he \\"really not authorised to hand out two thousand quid like that\\" but upon asking Lennon, Shotton said that he \\"merely grunted the affirmative without further comment\\". Lennon later described the exhibition as all \\"beautifully cut in half and painted white...That was our first public appearance, but I didn't even go and see the show, I was too uptight\\". Interpretation Half-A-Room has been described by Ono as a response to her feeling at the time that \\"there was a half empty space in my life\\" as a result of the increasing estrangement of her and her second husband, Anthony Cox. Ono awoke one day and noticed that Cox had not returned from a night out, and so the bed was half empty, and through this realised that there was \\"a half empty space in my life\\". The magazine Another Magazine wrote in 2015 that the piece \\"speaks to the pointlessness of material things without the human connection that gives them meaning; the result is a pure, painful representation of heartbreak that takes the breath away.\\" In an audio guide recorded for Ono's 2015 retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, Ono said that \\"You see a room with little ‚Äì a space between it. Instead of a room that's packed, you know, it has air between there. ...In those days, I still didn't have a life of just being alone. And then I thought, \\"This is a great one for a work of art to show to people that we're just half.\\" Anyway, everything that I see here, the other half is invisible. And that other half may be something that we might see one day, but now we don't see it\\".

History  The shipment of twenty locomotives made by the Baldwin Locomotive Works for the Southern Pacific Railway, was part of an order for fifty. Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company: A notable shipment of locomotives. In: The Locomotive, October 1922. Pages 111, 112 and 119. This was the most remarkable single train of locomotives ever hauled across the country until then. The train itself was nearly half a mile long without the pulling and pushing engines.< It departed on 22 May 1922 from Eddystone, bound for St. Louis on the Pennsylvania Railroad. It went then via the St. Louis Southwestern Railway to Corsicana. The train moved then via Southern Pacific to Los Angeles, where it arrived in June 1922.GP: Prosperity Special - 1922. These locomotives were subsequently used in heavy freight service on heavy grades in the Far West. They are carried on five pairs of driving wheels, with a two-wheeled truck at the front and rear. The large amount of weight on the driving wheels gives a great hauling capacity, while the trucks support the ends of the locomotive and guide it into curves and switches. Each locomotive was nearly in length, weighing . so that the entire train of twenty weighed in excess of 6,000 tons. The tenders had cylindrical water tanks and a smaller tank at the front end to carry the oil fuel which all Southern Pacific locomotives burn. The oil was sprayed into the furnace by a jet of steam and the fire is controlled by means of valves placed within easy reach of the fireman. Various modern devices were applied to increase the efficiency and capacity of the locomotives. Before entering the boiler, the feed water was heated; and the steam was also highly superheated before it entered the steam cylinders. An auxiliary engine known as a booster was attached to the rear truck for increasing the hauling power when starting heavy trains and climbing steep grades. The locomotive was reversed by a power operated device which relieved the engineer of considerable manual labor. It was only possible to haul twenty of these heavy locomotives in a single train, and it required several pulling and pushing locomotives on level stretches, while in passing over the Allegheny Mountains west of Altoona, additional helping power was needed. No less than six engines were necessary to move the train around the Horseshoe Curve. Throughout the entire journey, each locomotive was manned by an experienced engineer, who was personally in charge of the locomotive to which he was assigned. The departure of this complete train of locomotives, the most valuable ever moved in the United States as a single unit until then, was a most memorable event at the works where they were built. Many distinguished men from Washington, Pennsylvania, all parts of Pennsylvania and adjoining States, including officials from the Southern Pacific and other railways of the country witnessed the starting. By reason of the care which had to be exercised in the handling of this train, its movements were in the daytime only. No attempt at speed was made at any point, and this also permitted the train to be reviewed hy millions of people throughout its long journey. At many of the stopping places and in a large number of cities through which it passed, State and Municipal authorities, officers and members of Chambers of Commerce, Boards of Trade, commercial and industrial organizations, public school authorities and local trade and business associations made arrangements to review the train as it passed through their localities. At the night stopping places, opportunity was afforded for a close inspection of the locomotives.

It is modelled on an earlier statue of the king by John Michael Rysbrack in Queen Square, Bristol. Funding for the London statue was provided in the will of Samuel Travers, M.P., dated 1724, but nothing was done to progress the plan for a further seventy years. A design for the monument was drawn up in 1794 by Bacon's father, John Bacon Senior, but this was not executed and the commission passed to Bacon Jr., under whose direction the statue was finally erected in 1808. The statue is a Grade I listed structure.  History  William III, Prince of Orange, ascended the English throne in 1688 following the overthrow of James II in the Glorious Revolution. William ruled jointly with his wife, Mary, James's daughter, until her death in 1694, and then solely until his own death in 1702. In 1697 the first proposal had been made to erect a statue in the king's honour in St James's Square, home to many of his strongest supporters. Nothing was done, however, and two further attempts to revive the plan, in 1710 and 1721, also failed. In 1724, a member of Parliament and Crown official, Samuel Travers, left a bequest in his will to fund the construction \\"in St. James's Square or on Cheapside Conduit an equestrian statue in brass to the glorious memory of my master William the Third\\". Nevertheless, it was a further seventy years before the commission to design the statue was granted to John Bacon Sr., then England's most notable sculptor, in 1794. Bacon Sr. died before the commission could be executed, and the final design and construction was undertaken in 1808 by his son, John Bacon Jr.  Description  The sculpture is in bronze and depicts William in the style of a Roman general. It is heavily influenced by the earlier equestrian statue of William undertaken by Rysbrack and erected in Bristol in 1736. The king is depicted astride a \\"spirited\\" horse and, despite his Classical style of dress, William's hairstyle follows late 17th century fashion. Jo Darke, in her history of English and Welsh monuments, suggests that the base of the statue includes a depiction of the molehill, over which William's horse Sorrel stumbled at Hampton Court, leading to the king's death from complications of pneumonia. Panels on either side of the plinth carry inscriptions in bronze lettering, the first reading GVLIELMVS III and the second I. BACON, IVNR. SCVLPTR. 1807. The statue was designated a Grade I listed structure, the highest grading given to buildings and structures of \\"exceptional interest\\", in 1958.

Origin Cheung Po Tsai was a famous pirate during Jiaqing Emperor period in the Qing Dynasty and was active in the eastern part of Guangdong Province. Later, he was amnestied in 1810. According to legend, the natural cave located on the west bay of Cheung Chau is one of the secret places for Cheung Po Tsai to hide to avoid capture. This cave, later known as Cheung Po Tsai Cave, contained no trace of treasures. However, some people still believe that the cave is extremely narrow and can also be used to store treasures. Cheung Po Tsai Cave in the southwest of Cheung Chau, is about 10 feet deep. The total length of the cave is about 88 meters from the entrance to the exit. The cave is very dark and narrow. It is slippery and uneven, but in recent years, steel ladders have been added to facilitate visitors' access to the caves. As the cave is narrow, only one person can pass through, so visitors must enter from the side of the cave and then leave on the other side. To enter the cave, visitors must use the ladder and bring along a flashlight.

Mathews stated that the Barngarla, Nauo and Wirangu peoples were \\"practically the same people in language and customs\\". Country In Norman Tindale's estimation, the Wirangu were assigned an original tribal land extending over , embracing the coastal area between Head of Bight, Cape Blanche and Streaky Bay, with an inland extension running north to places like Ooldea, Kokatha, and Kondoolka. Mythology > In ancestral times a large mother snake travelled down from the west to > Juldi'kapi. From there it was followed by two men (the Wati Kutjara) who > wished to kill it.

A small clump-forming herbaceous perennial growing to tall by wide, it has dark green birch-like leaves. In late Spring, clusters of narrow pink buds open to white bell-shaped flowers. There is also a pink-flowered form. As it has a cascading habit and requires sharp drainage it is suitable for planting in an elevated position in a rockery or alpine garden.

The statue is a Grade I listed structure.  History  Charles II founded the Royal Hospital in 1682 to care for \\"those broken by age or war\\". The inspiration was the H√¥tel des Invalides in Paris, founded by Louis XIV of France. The commission was given to Christopher Wren and construction continued from 1682 to 1691.

The statue originally stood elsewhere and was moved to the Royal Hospital after Charles's death in 1685. Annually, on 29 May, Oak Apple Day, the traditional day for the celebration of the Restoration in 1660, the statue is wreathed with oak leaves.

Created in 1991, the conceptual artwork featured copies of the Bible, Quran, and a volume of the Talmud, each cut in two and attached to a sheet of glass, giving the illusion of all three volumes being encased within the glass. Latham explained the work as referencing the common origin of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. In 2005 the sculpture was to be featured as part of a retrospective of Latham's work at the Tate Britain gallery in London. After the 7 July 2005 London bombings by Islamic militants, staff members at the gallery expressed concerns that Muslims offended by the work might carry out acts of violence at the gallery. Tate Britain decided not to include the piece in the exhibition. Latham was angered by the gallery's decision, requesting that they return the work to his possession. The controversy generated media interest and in November Tate Britain held a panel debate regarding the issue. The Tate's decision not to display the work was widely criticised, including by Muslim groups and commentators, who accused the gallery of promoting the idea that Muslims were fanatical, intolerant, and volatile. Background God is Great (no. 2) was one of a series of artworks created by Latham which investigated relations between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. It features a copy of the Qur'an, the Christian Bible, and a volume from the Talmud, all appearing as if they are embedded within a sheet of glass. This effect had been achieved by cutting each of the books in two and having each side glued to the glass. Latham stated that \\"it shows that all religious teaching comes from the same source, whatever name you give to it\\". To The Independent he commented that the sculpture's \\"literal meaning\\" was \\"that all inspirational belief systems derive from a single source, represented by the glass, from which all utterances are drawn on a vast number of now numerate levels\\". The scholar of religion S. Brent Plate thought that there was an \\"interpretative ambiguity\\" to the work, in that the viewer is left to decide for themselves whether it is \\"critical or accepting\\" of the religious traditions featured. In the years after it had been made, the work was part of a series that had gone on display at Oxford's Museum of Modern Art, London's Lisson gallery and at the Venice Biennale. Tate Britain Debate Tate Britain's decision not to include the artwork in an exhibit was based on the 7 July 2005 London bombings (emergency crews pictured) The Tate Britain gallery in London held a retrospective of the artist's work, John Latham in Focus, between September 2005 and February 2006. In the wake of the 7 July 2005 bombings on the London transport system, carried out by Islamic militants, Tate Britain made the decision not to include God is Great (no. 2) in the exhibition, as they had originally planned. The gallery were aware that the act of cutting the sacred texts in two might cause offense to some members of these religious groups, although the gallery's director, Stephen Deuchar, stated that the decision was made not out of fear of offending anyone, but out of fear that someone who had been offended might respond violently. Following on from the June bombings, gallery staff had expressed concern that they might be attacked because of the artwork. Deuchar added that it was \\"a very difficult decision, but we made it due to the exceptional circumstances of this summer and in the light of opinions that we value regarding religious sensitivities.\\" The Tate had contacted Islamic scholars who had stated that the work could be seen as an abuse of the Quran, although the gallery had not consulted either the Metropolitan Police or the Muslim Council of Britain before making their decision. A notice was placed in the exhibit explaining that God is Great (no. 2) had been omitted. The incident followed on from several religious controversies that took place in Britain during the preceding year, including Christian demonstrations against Jerry Springer: The Opera and Sikh demonstrations against the play Behzti, which eventually resulted in the latter's cancellation by the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. =Response= British Muslim commentator Yasmin Alibhai-Brown criticised the Tate's decision to withdraw the work from display, arguing that it reflected the assumption that all Muslims were intolerant and volatile Latham was angered by the Tate's decision: \\"Tate Britain has shown cowardice over this . . . it isn't even a gesture as strong as censorship, just a loss of nerve.\\" In his view, the artwork was \\"not offensive to anybody\\" and not \\"anti-Muslim\\". He wrote to the gallery stating that if they were not going to display the artwork then they should relinquish possession and return it to him, although admitted that he thought it unlikely that they would do so. The Tate conceded that in its notice in the gallery, it would state that they had removed the piece \\"without the consent\\" of the artist. Latham died on 1 January 2006, before the retrospective exhibition had finished. The British media soon picked on the story and various newspaper columns were devoted to it. The civil rights advocacy group Liberty also criticised the gallery's decision; its director, Shami Chakrabarti, expressed concern at the \\"signal this sends at a time when we see free speech quite significantly under threat\\" in Britain. The Secretary of the Muslim Council of Britain, Iqbal Sacranie, stated that he was unaware of any Muslim group that had protested against the display of the artwork, but that he respected the Tate's decision if they felt it to be \\"deeply offensive to the believers of the three religions\\". The Council also stated that it had wished that the Tate had consulted them before making the decision, adding that \\"sometimes presumptions are incorrectly made about what is unacceptable to Muslims and this can be counter-productive.\\" Tate Britain organised a panel to debate the issue in November, titled \\"Sacred, Sacrosanct or Just Art?: The Politics and Place of Art in the Public Arena\\". One of those on the panel was the commentator Yasmin Alibhai-Brown. She noted that the debate was \\"more interesting and vital than that tired old match between absolutist libertarians and those who advocate censorship.\\" In her view, the Tate's decision was wrong, but understandable. She expressed frustration that the Tate's decision displayed an attitude that assumed Muslims to be fanatical and intolerant, and articulated the view that the millions of \\"liberal, secular, and open minded\\" Muslims around the world were \\"offended by the decision that assumed we are all volatile and unlikely to understand such works.\\" As a Muslim, she regarded the sculpture itself as \\"an extraordinary representation of devout belief in one God and universe\\". Another member of the panel was the commentator Anthony Julius. Regarding the artwork itself, he thought it \\"uninformed\\", believing that it did not reflect \\"any particularly intimate understanding of the traditions that it purports to represent.\\" Specifically, he thought it confused to have a whole copy of the Quran coupled with only part of the Talmud, which he thought reflected ignorance as to the nature of Jewish scripture and its relationship with Islamic text. He opposed the Tate's decision to remove the artwork from display, suggesting that the possibility of the sculpture being damaged was minimal, the threat to gallery visitors \\"exceptionally unlikely\\", and that if needed, additional security could have been employed. He further suggested that the Tate should have consulted Latham before making the decision, because the artist‚Äîalthough no longer the legal owner of the piece‚Äîshould remain in control of \\"the integrity of the work\\".

He then completed the General Course at the Swedish Armed Forces Staff College from 1983 to 1984 and the young captain's success was rewarded with pilot training at the United States Naval Test Pilot School at the Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland from 1984 to 1985, where he finished first in his class. During his career, Nilsson has tested 35 different aircraft types, Swedish and foreign, including, among others F-16 Fighting Falcon, F/A-18 Hornet and the Sukhoi Su-30. He left Link√∂ping in 1991 after nine years and then completed the Higher Course at the Swedish Armed Forces Staff College from 1991 to 1993. Nilsson then served in the Air Staff's Coordination Department in Stockholm from 1993 to 1995 and as chief of flight operations at Uppland Air Force Wing (F 16) near Uppsala from 1995 to 1997 as well as commanding officer of the wing from 1997 to 1999. In addition to his regular positions, he has also served as aide-de-camp to King Carl XVI Gustaf. In early 2000, Nilsson served as head of the Planning Department of the Joint Operations Command (Operationsledningen, OPL) in the Swedish Armed Forces Headquarters in Stockholm. Nilsson was appointed Inspector General of the Air Force on 30 June 2000 and head of the Air Force Tactical Command. As the air force chief, Nilsson in 2001 launched an open dispute with the Social Democrats regarding the disbandments of air force wings. He left the position of Inspector General of the Air Force on 1 December 2002 and took charge of the Joint Forces Directorate (Krigsf√∂rbandsledningen) in the Swedish Armed Forces Headquarters. He was at the same time promoted to lieutenant general. Nilsson later served as the Chief of Training & Development (Produktionschef) and as Director Joint Staff (Chef f√∂r ledningsstaben) where he was replaced by Sverker G√∂ranson on 1 November 2007. On 18 October 2007, Nilsson was appointed head of the Unit for Military Defense in the Ministry of Defence, the unit which prepares cases and questions on planning, managing and monitoring the military defense's tasks, ability, and operations. Nilsson was appointed First Marshal of the Court on 1 January 2012, in charge of planning the Swedish royal family's official program and representation. Personal life In 1987, Nilsson married Anna, a nurse, and together they have two children.

In extreme cases even a computer which is not connected to any network can be hacked.Air-gap jumpers on cyber.bgu.ac.il Cryptocurrency security technologies There are various types of cryptocurrency wallets available, with different layers of security, including devices, software for different operating systems or browsers, and offline wallets. Notable thefts In 2018, around US$1.7 billion in cryptocurrency was lost due to scams theft and fraud. In the first quarter 2019, the amount of such losses was US$1.2 billion. Original reports: , =Exchanges= Notable cryptrocurrency exchange hacks, resulting in the theft of cryptocurrencies include: *Bitstamp In 2015 cryptocurrencies worth $5 million were stolen *Mt. Gox Between 2011 and 2014, $350 million worth of bitcoin were stolen *Bitfinex In 2016, $72 million were stolen through exploiting the exchange wallet, users were refunded. *NiceHash In 2017 more than $60 million worth of cryptocurrency was stolen. *Coincheck NEM tokens worth $400 million were stolen in 2018 *Zaif $60 million in Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Monacoin stolen in September 2018 *Binance In 2019 cryptocurrencies worth $40 million were stolen. https://www.wired.com/story/hack-binance- cryptocurrency-exchange/ =Currencies= In 2016, known as the DAO event, an exploit in the original Ethereum smart contracts resulted in multiple transactions, creating additional $50 million. Subsequently, the currency was forked into Ethereum Classic, and Ethereum, with the latter continuing with the new blockchain without the exploited transactions. In 2017, Tether announced they were hacked, losing $31 million in USTD from their primary wallet. The company has 'tagged' the stolen currency, hoping to 'lock' them in the hacker's wallet (making them unspendable). Bitcoin There have been many cases of bitcoin theft. , around 980,000 bitcoins have been stolen from cryptocurrency exchanges. One type of theft involves a third party accessing the private key to a victim's bitcoin address, or of an online wallet. If the private key is stolen, all the bitcoins from the compromised address can be transferred. In that case, the network does not have any provisions to identify the thief, block further transactions of those stolen bitcoins, or return them to the legitimate owner. Theft also occurs at sites where bitcoins are used to purchase illicit goods. In late November 2013, an estimated $100 million in bitcoins were allegedly stolen from the online illicit goods marketplace Sheep Marketplace, which immediately closed. Users tracked the coins as they were processed and converted to cash, but no funds were recovered and no culprits identified. A different black market, Silk Road 2, stated that during a February 2014 hack, bitcoins valued at $2.7 million were taken from escrow accounts. Sites where users exchange bitcoins for cash or store them in \\"wallets\\" are also targets for theft. Inputs.io, an Australian wallet service, was hacked twice in October 2013 and lost more than $1 million in bitcoins. GBL, a Chinese bitcoin trading platform, suddenly shut down on 26 October 2013; subscribers, unable to log in, lost up to $5 million worth of bitcoin. In late February 2014 Mt. Gox, one of the largest virtual currency exchanges, filed for bankruptcy in Tokyo amid reports that bitcoins worth $350 million had been stolen. Flexcoin, a bitcoin storage specialist based in Alberta, Canada, shut down in March 2014 after saying it discovered a theft of about $650,000 in bitcoins. Poloniex, a digital currency exchange, reported in March 2014 that it lost bitcoins valued at around $50,000. In January 2015 UK- based bitstamp, the third busiest bitcoin exchange globally, was hacked and $5 million in bitcoins were stolen. February 2015 saw a Chinese exchange named BTER lose bitcoins worth nearly $2 million to hackers. A major bitcoin exchange, Bitfinex, was hacked and nearly 120,000 bitcoins (around $60M) was stolen in 2016. Bitfinex was forced to suspend its trading. The theft is the second largest bitcoin heist ever, dwarfed only by Mt. Gox theft in 2014. According to Forbes, \\"All of Bitfinex's customers,... will stand to lose money. The company has announced a cut of 36.067% across the board.\\" Following the hack the company refunded customers. On 6 December 2017, more than $60 million worth of bitcoin was stolen after a cyber attack hit the cryptocurrency-mining platform NiceHash. According to the CEO Marko Kobal and co-founder Sasa Coh, bitcoins worth US$64 million were stolen, although users have pointed to a bitcoin wallet which held 4,736.42 bitcoins, equivalent to $67 million. On May 7, 2019, hackers stole over 7000 Bitcoins from the Binance Cryptocurrency Exchange, at a value of over 40 million US dollars. Binance CEO Zhao Changpeng stated: \\"The hackers used a variety of techniques, including phishing, viruses and other attacks.... The hackers had the patience to wait, and execute well-orchestrated actions through multiple seemingly independent accounts at the most opportune time.\\" Thefts have raised safety concerns. Charles Hayter, founder of digital currency comparison website CryptoCompare said, \\"It's a reminder of the fragility of the infrastructure in such a nascent industry.\\" According to the hearing of U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Small Business on April 2, 2014, \\"these vendors lack regulatory oversight, minimum capital standards and don't provide consumer protection against loss or theft.\\" =Wallets= In 2017 a flaw in the Parity Wallet caused the loss of approximately $30 million.https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/11/with-deletion- of-one-wallet-280-m-in-ethereum-wallets-gets-frozen/ Fraud Josh Garza, who founded the cryptocurrency startups GAW Miners and ZenMiner in 2014, acknowledged in a plea agreement that the companies were part of a pyramid scheme, and pleaded guilty to wire fraud in 2015. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission separately brought a civil enforcement action against Garza, who was eventually ordered to pay a judgment of $9.1 million plus $700,000 in interest. The SEC's complaint stated that Garza, through his companies, had fraudulently sold \\"investment contracts representing shares in the profits they claimed would be generated\\" from mining.Cyris Farivar, GAW Miners founder owes nearly $10 million to SEC over Bitcoin fraud , Ars Technica (October 5, 2017). Following its shut-down, in 2018 a class action lawsuit for $771,000 was filed against the cryptocurrency platform known as BitConnect, including the platform promoting YouTube channels. Prior fraud warnings in regards to BitConnect, and cease-and-desist orders by the Texas State Securities Board cited the promise of massive monthly returns. OneCoin was a massive world-wide multi-level marketing Ponzi scheme promoted as (but not involving) a cryptocurrency, causing losses of $4 billion worldwide. Several people behind the scheme were arrested in 2018 and 2019. Malware=Malware stealing= Some malware can steal private keys for bitcoin wallets allowing the bitcoins themselves to be stolen. The most common type searches computers for cryptocurrency wallets to upload to a remote server where they can be cracked and their coins stolen. Many of these also log keystrokes to record passwords, often avoiding the need to crack the keys. A different approach detects when a bitcoin address is copied to a clipboard and quickly replaces it with a different address, tricking people into sending bitcoins to the wrong address. This method is effective because bitcoin transactions are irreversible. One virus, spread through the Pony botnet, was reported in February 2014 to have stolen up to $220,000 in cryptocurrencies including bitcoins from 85 wallets. Security company Trustwave, which tracked the malware, reports that its latest version was able to steal 30 types of digital currency. A type of Mac malware active in August 2013, Bitvanity posed as a vanity wallet address generator and stole addresses and private keys from other bitcoin client software. A different trojan for macOS, called CoinThief was reported in February 2014 to be responsible for multiple bitcoin thefts. The software was hidden in versions of some cryptocurrency apps on Download.com and MacUpdate. = Ransomware = Many types of ransomware demand payment in bitcoin. One program called CryptoLocker, typically spread through legitimate-looking email attachments, encrypts the hard drive of an infected computer, then displays a countdown timer and demands a ransom in bitcoin, to decrypt it. Massachusetts police said they paid a 2 bitcoin ransom in November 2013, worth more than $1,300 at the time, to decrypt one of their hard drives. Bitcoin was used as the ransom medium in the WannaCry ransomware. One ransomware variant disables internet access and demands credit card information to restore it, while secretly mining bitcoins. , most ransomware attackers preferred to use currencies other than bitcoin, with 44% of attacks in the first half of 2018 demanding Monero, which is highly private and difficult to trace, compared to 10% for bitcoin and 11% for Ethereum. = Unauthorized mining = In June 2011, Symantec warned about the possibility that botnets could mine covertly for bitcoins. Malware used the parallel processing capabilities of GPUs built into many modern video cards. Although the average PC with an integrated graphics processor is virtually useless for bitcoin mining, tens of thousands of PCs laden with mining malware could produce some results. In mid-August 2011, bitcoin mining botnets were detected, and less than three months later, bitcoin mining trojans had infected Mac OS X. In April 2013, electronic sports organization E-Sports Entertainment was accused of hijacking 14,000 computers to mine bitcoins; the company later settled the case with the State of New Jersey. German police arrested two people in December 2013 who customized existing botnet software to perform bitcoin mining, which police said had been used to mine at least $950,000 worth of bitcoins. For four days in December 2013 and January 2014, Yahoo! Europe hosted an ad containing bitcoin mining malware that infected an estimated two million computers. The software, called Sefnit, was first detected in mid-2013 and has been bundled with many software packages. Microsoft has been removing the malware through its Microsoft Security Essentials and other security software. Several reports of employees or students using university or research computers to mine bitcoins have been published. On February 20, 2014, a member of the Harvard community was stripped of his or her access to the University's research computing facilities after setting up a Dogecoin mining operation using a Harvard research network, according to an internal email circulated by Faculty of Arts and Sciences Research Computing officials.http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/2/20/harvard-odyssey- dogecoin/ Ars Technica reported in January 2018 that YouTube advertisements contained JavaScript code that mined the cryptocurrency Monero. Phishing A phishing website to generate private IOTA wallet seed passphrases, collected wallet keys, with estimates of up to $4 million worth of MIOTA tokens stolen. The malicious website operated for an unknown amount of time, and was discovered in January 2018.  Other incidents  In late 2018, Canada's largest crypto exchange QuadrigaCX lost $190 million in cryptocurrency when the owner allegedly died; he was the only one with knowledge of the password to a storage wallet. The exchange filed for bankruptcy in 2019. Michael Terpin, the founder and chief executive officer of Transform Group, a San Juan, Puerto Rico-based company that advises blockchain businesses on public relations and communications, sued Ellis Pinsky in New York on May 7, 2020, for leading a ‚Äúsophisticated cybercrime spree‚Äù that stole $24 million in cryptocurrency by hacking into Terpin's phone in 2018. Terpin also sued Nicholas Truglia and won a $75.8 million judgment against Truglia in 2019 in California state court. On July 15, 2020, Twitter accounts of prominent personalities and firms, including Joe Biden, Barack Obama, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Apple, Kanye West, Michael Bloomberg and Uber were hacked. Twitter confirmed that it was a coordinated social engineering attack on their own employees. Twitter released its statement six hours after the attack took place. Hackers posted the message to transfer the Bitcoin in a Bitcoin wallet, which would double the amount. The wallet‚Äôs balance was expected to increase to more than $100,000 as the message spread among the Twitter followers.

It was built from 1923 to 1936 by Queensland Department of Public Works. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 April 2017.  History  Milton State School opened in 1889, as Rosalie State School, on its current site approximately two kilometres west of the Brisbane CBD. The school is important in demonstrating the evolution of state education and its associated architecture. In 2017 Milton State School retains a Depression-era brick school building, retaining walls and stairs (1935‚Äì37); a re-purposed two-storey timber classroom building (1923); and mature trees. The school has been in continuous operation since its establishment. The land north of the Milton Reach of the Brisbane River and southwest of the North Brisbane Burial Ground (used 1843-75, later Lang Park), part of the traditional lands of the Turrbal people, was outside Brisbane's original town limits. Large suburban allotments were sold in the area in the 1850s. The suburb of Milton is named after Ambrose Eldridge's \\"Milton House\\", built near the river in the early 1850s when Eldridge was farming cotton. During the 1860s, the Paddington, Milton, and Auchenflower area consisted of large houses on acreage, but denser settlement later occurred due to the opening of the Main Line railway to Ipswich in 1875; and Milton developed a mix of worker's cottages, small businesses and industry. A distillery opened at Milton in 1871, followed by the Castlemaine brewery in 1878, and there was a population boom during the 1880s due to residential subdivision. The opening of a tram line from Petrie Terrace to Toowong Cemetery, via Milton Road, in July 1904, also promoted suburban development in Milton.'Meander through Milton - Brisbane Heritage Trails', online document (accessed 10 October 2016)Department of Natural Resources and Mines (DNRM) Survey Plan S15185, 1854'Milton House', QHR600253AT Miles, \\"Milton State School: a history\\", Rosalie, Queensland, the author, 1973'Rectifying distillery Milton', Brisbane Courier, 25 February 1871, p.5'Opening of the railway', Queensland Times, Ipswich Herald & General Advertiser, 17 June 1875, p.3'Toowong tramway. Informal opening', Brisbane Courier, 23 July 1904, p.6 A tram line also branched off Milton Road to run along Baroona Road, north of Milton State School.1914 Map, 8 chains to an inch, Brisbane and Suburbs, Sheet 8 A large number of residential estates were created in the 1880s, which soon led to pressure for a state school for Rosalie (today a locality in the suburb of Paddington, northwest of the suburb of Milton).Estates close to the Milton State School site included Castletown, Lewison, West Paddington, Glengallan, Rosalie, Oxford, Latrobe Park, Holmedale, Rose Hill, Blackall, Baroona, Douglas, Bayswater, Brewsterfield, Torwood and Milton (Miles, 'Milton State School: a history'1895 Maps, 6 Chains to an Inch, Brisbane and Suburbs, McKellar, Sheets 7, 8). The establishment of schools was considered an essential step in the development of early communities and integral to their success. Locals often donated land and labour for a school's construction and the school community contributed to maintenance and development. Schools became a community focus, a symbol of progress, and a source of pride, with enduring connections formed with past pupils, parents, and teachers.Project Services, \\"Mount Morgan State High School\\" in Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report, for Education Queensland, 2008, pp.4-5P Burmester, M Pullar and M Kennedy Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, a report for the Department of Education, 1996, pp.87-8. The effort to open a school at Rosalie/Milton accelerated when a committee was formed in February 1886 at a meeting of residents of the Rosalie, Oxford, Bayswater, Blackall, Lewison and Holmedale Estates. A small area of high ground on the west side of Red Jacket Swamp (later Gregory Park), part of an 1884 Water Reserve, was later chosen as the site of the school. Unlike alternative sites, this land was free.Miles, 'Milton State School: a history''Reserves', Brisbane Courier, 21 June 1884, p.5. The site of Red Jacket Swamp, which was drained by Western Creek, is today bounded by Baroona Road to the north, Bayswater Street to the west, and Haig Road to the southeast. In the 1880s the swamp was located in Toowong Shire, just south of the boundary with the Ithaca Division (1879‚Äì87, then the Ithaca Shire). Land to the west and northwest of the swamp was subdivided into residential allotments in 1879; to the north in 1886-7; and to the southeast in the early 20th century. However, in the 1880s Red Jacket Swamp remained undeveloped, and was a source of contention between the two local governments about who was responsible for draining and filling it. Waste-water runoff from the houses on the higher ground (in Ithaca) around the swamp had created an odorous health hazard.DNRM Survey Plan RP19654, 1879 (subdivision of land west/southwest of swamp, portions 228, 229)DNRM Certificate of Title 10171097, 1871 (allotments sold from 1886 onwards, north of swamp, portion 227)DNRM Survey Plan RP19643, 1887 (subdivision of land north of swamp, on portions 226, 227)DNRM Certificate of Title 10654061, 1887 (southeast of swamp, Suburban Allotment 43 mostly subdivided in the early 20th century)'Red Jacket Swamp', Brisbane Courier, 29 September 1888, p.9 (unsanitary school location)'Rosalie Arbour Day', Telegraph, 11 November 1889, p.4 (odour). Regardless, the site was deemed suitable for a school. A and Reserve for State School Purposes was surveyed off the Water Reserve in late 1886, and was gazetted in January 1887; with the remainder of Red Jacket Swamp ( , gazetted as a Reserve for Recreation in July 1887.DNRM Survey Plan N25284, 1886'State School for Rosalie', Telegraph, 26 July 1886, p.4Queensland Government Gazette, V.40 1887, p.194 (Reserve for State School Purposes)Queensland Government Gazette, V.41 1887, p.871 (Reserve for Recreation). In June 1888 the tender of James Loynes for a new state school at Rosalie, Milton, for ¬£999, was accepted, and the first timber school building - comprising a single classroom, head teachers office, and front and back verandahs - was completed by February 1889. The Rosalie State School opened with an enrolment of 261 students on 18 March 1889, and had an enrolment of 422 by the end of the year. A second classroom was added to the north, perpendicular to the first building, by September 1889. The school soon changed its name, and the \\"Milton State School Committee\\" operated by October 1889.'State School Buildings', Telegraph, 27 June 1888, p.5Miles, \\"Milton State School: a history\\". The first building addressed the street, with the head teacher's office on the western verandah. Brisbane Courier, 10 April 1889, p.4'Cost ¬£30,000: Milton's new school official opening', Sunday Mail, 9 May 1937, p.8Brisbane Courier, 10 October 1889, p.3. However, an 1890 article still refers to the \\"Rosalie State School Committee\\" ('Rosalie drain. Effect on school children', Telegraph, 6 November 1890, p.4). The school's enrolment continued to increase, with average attendance rising to 850 by 1898. Additions were made to the school in 1891 and 1899; and two playsheds were built by early 1896.'Milton State School: Improving Red Jacket Swamp', Telegraph, 12 November 1898, p.2Project Services, \\"Milton State School\\", in Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report, for Education Queensland, January 2008'Milton State School', Brisbane Courier, 4 February 1896, p.5. In 1919 one playshed was located immediately north of the original pool, and one was located at an angle behind of the northernmost wing of the school (1919 plan in Miles, 'Milton State School: a history'). An important component of Queensland state schools was their grounds. The early and continuing commitment to play-based education, particularly in primary school, resulted in the provision of outdoor play space and sporting facilities, such as ovals and tennis courts. Also, trees and gardens were planted to shade and beautify schools. In late 1889 Milton State School was one of the first Queensland schools to hold an Arbor Day, and 65 trees, supplied free by the Department of Agriculture and including Moreton Bay and other figs, Bauhinia, Poinciana, and Jacaranda trees, were planted by students. The aim was to beautify the school grounds, and reduce the smell of stagnant water, using shade trees.'School Arbour Days', Telegraph, 7 November 1889, p.2'Rosalie Arbour Day', Telegraph, 11 November 1889, p.4. The school grounds were gradually extended northwards along Bayswater Street. In 1901, were added north of the school buildings; and another , at the corner of Bayswater Street and Baroona Road, was added in 1920. This corner site had, from c.1892 until 1919, been the headquarters of the Milton Volunteer Fire Brigade (established 1888).1895 Map, 6 Chains to an Inch, Brisbane and Suburbs, McKellar, Sheet 7DNRM Survey Plan S133, 1901'Milton Volunteer fire brigade', Brisbane Courier, 6 July 1892, p.6. The Milton brigade moved to the Ithaca Fire Station, which opened in 1919 ('Ithaca Fire Station (former)' QHR 601199). In February 1914 a swimming pool was officially opened at Milton State School, making it the second Queensland state school to have a swimming pool, after JJunction Park State School in 1910. The Milton pool, funded by parents, was long, wide, and to deep. Located at the south end of the school grounds, it was built by James Price for ¬£250.'Swimming pool at Milton State School', Telegraph, 12 December 1913, p.5'School swimming bath, Milton's good example', Telegraph, 9 February 1914, p.4'Swimming.

The playshed located just north of the old swimming pool was removed at this time (Project Services, 'Milton State School'). Improvements to the school's accommodation also continued in the interwar period, as the population of Milton expanded. A new highset wing, with three classrooms, was added at the south end of, and perpendicular to, the first school building in 1919; and another wing was added in 1923, this time at the north end of the school. The latter building had six classrooms in two storeys, and cost ¬£2500. In 1923 the average daily attendance at the school was 900-1000 students.'Milton State School', Week, 10 October 1919, p.16'Milton State School', Brisbane Courier, 29 August 1923, p.13 A 1919 newspaper article was illustrated with a photo taken from the east (rear) of the school, with the new wing \\"on the left\\".

Improvements to school facilities in the 1930s included tennis courts, located in the northeast corner of Gregory Park. By this time the park had been filled in and served as the school's playground. The tennis courts were moved to their current position, east of the swimming pool, between 1951 and 1955.'Brisbane City Council Water Supply and Sewerage Department, District no.4 Detail Plan No.799, 24 November 1933' (shows the tennis courts near the corner of Baroona and Haig Roads)'Splendid progress made, Milton State School, Committee's report', Telegraph, 8 March 1935, p.5 The tennis courts had been provided within the three years prior to February 1935. By 1909 Red Jacket Swamp had been renamed Gregory Park - after Sir Augustus Charles Gregory (1819-1905), former Commissioner for Crown Lands and Surveyor-General, Member of the Queensland Legislative Council, and a former Mayor of Toowong.'Gregory Park Reserve', Brisbane Courier, 31 May 1909, p.4). However, the main change to the school in the 1930s was the construction of a Depression-era brick school building (Block A in 2017) between 1935 and 1937. The Great Depression, commencing in 1929 and extending well into the 1930s, caused a dramatic reduction of public building work in Queensland and brought private building work to a standstill. In response, the Queensland Government provided relief work for unemployed Queenslanders, and also embarked on an ambitious and important building program to provide impetus to the economy. Even before the October 1929 stock market crash, the Queensland Government initiated an Unemployment Relief Scheme, through a work program administered by the Department of Public Works (DPW). This included painting and repairs to school buildings.'Relief of unemployment: big programme contemplated', The Telegraph, 24 July 1929, p.5'Unemployment: the relief scheme', The Telegraph, 26 July 1929, p.5. By mid-1930 men were undertaking grounds improvement works to schools under the scheme.Report of the Department of Public Works for the year ended 30 Jun 1930, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1930, p.15. In June 1932 the Forgan Smith Labor Government came to power from a campaign that advocated increased government spending to counter the effects of the Depression. The government embarked on a large public building program designed to promote the employment of local skilled workers, the purchase of local building materials and the production of commodious, low maintenance buildings which would be a long-term asset to the state.'Labor at the Helm', The Worker, 20 Jul 1932, p.8'Queensland Parliament', The Northern Miner, 17 Aug 1932, p.2'Public Buildings', Daily Mercury, 19 Oct 1933, p.7DPW, Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1934, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1934, pp.6-8DPW, Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1935, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1935, p.2Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1936, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1936, p.2'State will spend over ¬£460,000: big building plans', The Courier-Mail, 28 Dec 1933, p.9Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1939, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1939, p.2. The construction of substantial brick school buildings in prosperous or growing suburban areas and regional centres during the 1930s provided tangible proof of the government's commitment to remedy the unemployment situation.Type E/B1 (Burmester et al, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, p.59). Depression-era brick school buildings form a recognisable and important type, exhibiting many common characteristics. Most were designed in a classical idiom to project the sense of stability and optimism which the government sought to convey through the architecture of its public buildings. Frequently, they were two storeys above an open undercroft and built to accommodate up to 1000 students. They adopted a symmetrical plan form and often exhibited a prominent central entry. The plan arrangement was similar to that of timber buildings, being only one classroom deep, accessed by a long straight verandah or corridor. Due to their long plan forms of multiple wings, they could be built in stages if necessary; resulting in some complete designs never being realised. Classrooms were commonly divided by folding timber partitions and the undercroft was used as covered play space, storage, ablutions and other functions.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, pp.59-60. Despite their similarities, each Depression-era brick school building was individually designed by a DPW architect, which resulted in a wide range of styles and ornamental features being utilised within the overall set. These styles, which were derived from contemporary tastes and fashions, included: Arts and Crafts, typified by half-timbered gable-ends; Spanish Mission, with round-arched openings and decorative parapets; and Neo-classical, with pilasters, columns and large triangular pediments. Over time, variations occurred in building size, decorative treatment, and climatic-responsive features.EHP analysis of Depression-era Brick Schools, based on contemporary photographs, QHR listed schools, Project Services Heritage Reports (2006) and original DPW building plans. Plans of the new brick school, dated February 1935, show a long, symmetrical building of three parallel wings, comprising an undercroft with toilets and open play space, and two levels of classrooms, with teachers rooms housed in a projecting entrance bay in the centre of the main fa√ßade. The aesthetic treatment of the building incorporated Spanish Mission-style features, such as decorative parapets and semi-circular arches to the upper floor windows. The hipped roof and window hoods to the northeast facing windows were to be clad in terracotta tiles. Typical of these schools, classrooms were linearly arranged along one side of the building, linked by long corridors, and some classrooms were separated by folding timber partitions.DPW Plan 202-18-1/6 , \\"Milton Brisbane, New State School, Basement Plan\\", February 1935DPW Plan 202-18-1/7, \\"Milton Brisbane, New State School, Ground Floor Plan\\", February 1935DPW Plan 202-1-18/8, \\"Milton Brisbane, New State School, First Floor Plan\\", February 1935DPW Plan 202-18-1/10, \\"Milton Brisbane, New State School\\", (elevations) February 1935DPW Plan 202-18-1/11, \\"Milton Brisbane, New State School\\", (elevation and sections) February 1935. Construction progressed from early 1935. A description of the building by the Department of Public Works that year gave an estimated cost of ¬£19,500, and stated:'Report of the Department of Public Works for the Year ended 30th June 1935', p.8. > \\"This building will replace the old school buildings on the existing site... > The walls above the first floor will be of face brickwork, the base being > formed in cement plaster...

Only one of the old main buildings of the school survived the construction of the Depression-era brick school building. By January 1935 the two-storey 1923 timber building (Block B in 2017) at the north end of the school was ready to be shifted further north to make way for construction of the new brick school, which was being built on the footprint of the previous school buildings. Rather than demolish Block B, as it was only 13 years old, in 1936 it was remodelled to provide vocational training (domestic science and manual training) at the school, which had been requested by the school committee.'Milton school alterations', Telegraph, 25 January 1935, p.6DPW Plan 202-18-1/1, \\"Milton State School Brisbane Site Plan\\" July 1935 (plan shows the location of previous school buildings under the new brick school's footprint) Approval for remodelling Block B for vocational training, at a cost of ¬£913, was given in August 1936.'¬£9152 approved for hospital at Cracow', Telegraph, 20 August 1936, p.2 Students from Sherwood State School were travelling to Milton for vocational training once a week, prior to 1951. Vocational education was a Queensland Government priority to support the development of primary industries; this evolved after World War I into a variety of subjects. Vocational training within primary education began in 1895 with drawing classes and expanded to include domestic sciences, agriculture, and sheet metal and wood working classes. The subjects required a variety of purpose- built facilities and were initially gender segregated. In 1936 the Minister for Education permitted students to take vocational subjects in lieu of geography or history in the Junior Examination, increasing the subjects' popularity.G Logan and E Clarke, State Education in Queensland: a brief history, a report for the Department of Education, Queensland, 1984, pp.3-5Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, p.58. The remodelling of Block B included altering the internal partitions and partially enclosing the verandahs to create woodwork and sheet metalwork rooms and a teachers room on the ground floor, and cookery, dining and dressmaking rooms, a lecture room and a laundry on the first floor. The ground floor of Block B sat lower than the undercroft level of the new brick building, and the only access to the first floor was via an L-shaped staircase on the southwest side.DPW Plan 180-22-8, \\"Milton State School - remodelling 2 storey building for domestic science & manual training\\", July 1936. The new school, with a total cost of ¬£30,000, was in use from March 1937, and was officially opened in May by the Minister for Public Instruction, Frank Cooper. By this time 833 students were enrolled. Minister Cooper said that the new school \\"would stand for the next century or more\\".Miles, \\"Milton State School: a history\\". Fire fighting display outside Milton State School, circa 1942 Air raid shelters were constructed in Gregory Park, for students of Milton State School, during World War II (WWII). Due to fear of a Japanese invasion, the Queensland Government closed all coastal state schools in January 1942, and although most schools reopened on 2 March 1942, student attendance was optional until the war ended.R Wood, \\"Civil Defence In Queensland During World War II\\", in Journal of the Royal Historical Society of Queensland, Volume 15 Issue 2, Brisbane, Royal Historical Society of Queensland, 1993, p.79'Schools reopensome await shelter survey', The Courier Mail, 2 March 1942, p.3. Slit trenches, for protecting the students from Japanese air raids, were also dug at Queensland state schools. The swampy origins of Gregory Park meant that, instead of digging slit trenches, heaped sandbags were used to form six above- ground trenches, each long. Students, parents and staff were all involved, with women sewing the sandbags shut. However, the school had to threaten that, as they could only teach as many children as there was shelter space for, those children whose parents had assisted with the shelters would have priority to recommence attending school.Photograph, Courier Mail, 2 March 1942, p.3'Many help to build Milton shelters', Courier Mail, 14 March 1942, p.3'Women help build shelters', Telegraph, 28 March 1942, p.1'Milton State School has a \\"little list\\"', Telegraph, 16 March 1942, p.5. There were 800 children enrolled at this time. Physical education, 1951 Changes continued to be made after WWII. Although enrolments declined, from 976 in 1951, to 563 in 1973, smaller classroom sizes meant new additions were still required. In 1951, of land was removed from Gregory Park and added to the south end of the school (the site of the tennis courts in 2017). By 1951, palm trees existed along the school's rear boundary with Gregory Park, and there were also mature trees along the northern end of the Bayswater Street frontage, and one at the south end of the school near the Haig Road pedestrian crossing. By 1960, a tree existed in front of Block A, north of the front entrance; with another just southeast of the same building. A three-classroom timber building (Block C in 2017) was added at the north end of the school by . Part of the open play space in the undercroft of Block A was also enclosed as temporary classrooms in 1957.DNRM Survey Plan SL2186, 1951DNRM aerial photograph BCC5-38333, 1 August 1951DNRM aerial photograph QAP1070-32, 30 September 1960DPW Plan 20551-S782, \\"Milton State School enclosing & paving under school\\", 1952 (use of day labour authorised 1954)DPW Plan barcode 13116290, \\"Milton State School new classroom wing amendments for tiled roof\\", October 1955.

Asphalt was laid behind and in front of Block A .DPW Plan 551-900-1, \\"Milton State School proposed asphalted areas\\", April 1962. In the mid-1960s Block B was altered to become a Technical College. Partitions were removed on the upper floor to create one large room with smaller rooms on the now fully enclosed verandah, while the ground floor was altered for use as an optical mechanics room and watchmakers room, with additional storage created within the verandah.DPW Plan 551-1061/1, \\"Milton SS - technical section.

Both Block B and Block C (an infant's school) apparently became surplus to requirements after Grade 8 was moved to high school (1964), and both blocks were used as technical colleges until 1973.Miles, 'Milton State School: a history') They were later used by the Guidance Training Section for Primary and Secondary School Guidance Officers, to the end of 1988, and in 1989 were being used for aerobics classes, and by the Parents and Citizens Association, and the Arts Council.'Milton State School Centenary Book', Milton, Queensland, Milton State School, 1989, p.9 In 1991 toilets were constructed in the ground floor verandah.DPW Plan 20551-0042B-2, 'Milton State School, remodelling of Block \\"B\\" to accommodate toilets', April 1991 Around this time the dressing sheds at either end of the swimming pool were removed, and a new amenities block was built to the east of the north end of the pool.DPW Plan 20551-4477-1, \\"Milton State School, replacement amenities block swimming pool site plan\\", June 1991 Some minor changes were made to Block A from the late 1970s. The former cloakrooms on the first floor - by now a health room (north) and staff room (south) - were extended eastwards into the corridors of the north and south wings , and the undercroft area of the entrance bay was also converted to three storerooms. By 1978 a tuckshop and a projection room had also been added to the southern end of the former open play area of the undercroft.DPW Plan 551-1372/3, \\"Milton, Brisbane, extension to staff and health room\\", May 1978DPW Plan 561-1372/4, \\"Milton, Brisbane, new storage accommodation\\", May 1978. Around 2000, the classroom configurations of Block A were changed. On the first floor, one classroom wall of the southern wing was removed to form one large and one smaller classroom; while the walls between the three classrooms of the northern wing were removed to create two classrooms divided by a folding partition. The four classrooms of the central wing were converted into two classrooms divided by small rooms containing wet areas and storage. On the second floor, the three classrooms of the southern wing were converted to two classrooms divided by a folding partition.DPW Plan 03-0551-01, \\"Milton State School, Block A - layout\\", May 2000DPW Plan 03-0551-02, \\"Milton State School, Block A - layout\\", May 2000. Later, a covered concrete extension was added behind Block A's central wing (), extending east from the 1930s retaining wall.Google Earth images 2007-09. For the school's centenary celebrations in 1989, a 1:15th scale model of first school building was built (extant 2017); a Centenary quilt was produced, and a Centenary Courtyard was created, south of the main entrance. There were 686 students enrolled in mid-2016.'Milton State School Centenary Book', p.49 (Centenary celebrations) In 2017, Milton State School continues to operate from its original site, and its Depression-era brick school building is a local landmark. The school is important to the area as a focus for the community, and generations of students have been taught there.  Description  Milton State School occupies a narrow site along Bayswater Street in the suburb of Milton, two kilometres west of the Brisbane CBD. A fence line separates the school grounds from adjacent Gregory Park to the east, which is used by the school as their playing field. The school and park occupy the full extent of a triangular block bounded by Bayswater Street to the west, Baroona Road to the north and Haig Road to the southeast. The school buildings are located along the Bayswater Street boundary at the highest point of the school grounds, which fall away to the east and southeast. The most prominent building on the site is a Depression-era brick school building (Block A, 1935‚Äì37) which fronts Bayswater Street. North of Block A is a timber building formerly used as a vocational training building (Block B, 1923, adapted 1936). The school grounds contain a number of significant mature trees, and landscaping features including retaining walls and stairs (1935‚Äì37), assembly and play areas and sporting facilities. = Depression-era brick school building (Block A) = Rear of Block A from Gregory Park The Depression-era brick school building is a long, two-storey building with a full undercroft. The building faces southwest and, as the undercroft is below the level of Bayswater Street, it is accessed via a wide walkway and steps to the main entrance in the centre of the first floor facade. Symmetrical in plan, the building comprises a long central wing with projecting entrance bay, flanked by shorter wings to the northwest and southeast, which are parallel but set back from the central wing. Secondary entrances are located at the corners of the intersecting wings, with stairs leading to first floor porticos at the front of the building, and ground floor porticos leading to the undercroft at the rear. A two-storey extension (1959‚Äì60) which adjoins the southern end of the block is not of heritage significance. Ornamented with a Spanish Mission- style decorative treatment, the building is constructed from red face brick walls with rough-cast concrete render to the entrance bay walls and smooth render to undercroft walls, window sills and lintels, and panels below the first and second floor windows. The second floor has arched windows to the entrance bay, main fa√ßade of the central wing, and to the stairwells and corridors on the east elevation, constructed from semi-circular brick arches with brick or concrete keystones. The entrance bay features a cantilevered balcony over the main entrance door, accessed by French doors, and a decorative parapet with small louvred ventilation panel. An un-rendered version of this parapet also ornaments the northeast side of the central wing. Early iron balustrades survive on the balcony; along the entrance walkway; and to the secondary entrance stairs. The hipped roof is clad in terracotta tiles, and the raked eaves are lined with timber V-jointed (VJ) tongue and groove (T&G;) boards. First and second floor windows along the northeast elevation are protected by hipped window hoods clad in terracotta tiles and featuring decorative timber brackets. The northwest and southwest end walls of the wings are largely blank. An early school bell is fixed to the underside of the first floor window hood in the centre of the northeast elevation. Windows openings are regularly spaced and generally comprise three tall casement windows with square fanlights above. Arched windows have a fixed, semi-circular fanlight. Walls to the toilets in the undercroft have high rectangular openings which formerly contained fixed louvres in timber frames, however the glass has been removed and modern screens fixed to the outside. The main entrance double door, set back from the front fa√ßade, is a panelled, low-waisted door glazed with six-lights and retains early door hardware. The secondary entrance doors to the first floor have been replaced, but retain their original two-light fanlights with patterned glass. Non-significant features of the exterior include: a lift attached to the northwest wall of the central wing; air- conditioning units, cables and ducting; modern downpipes and rainwater tanks; and modern doors, gates and screens to doors and windows of the undercroft. Internally, rooms are arranged along the northeast side of the wings, linked by wide corridors along the southwest side. Vertical circulation is provided by stairwells at each end of the central wing. Next to the stairwells are rectangular rooms formerly used for play space on the undercroft level and hat and cloak rooms on the upper levels. The entrance bay contains rooms of varying size used for staff and office purposes. Block A undercroft, play space and tuck shop The undercroft contains toilets in the northwest and southwest wings and was originally open play space in the central wing; however, in 2017 the southern portion of the space is enclosed for a tuck shop and music room. This level has a concrete floor with coved edges, rendered masonry walls with rounded corners, and flat rendered ceilings. The toilets largely retain their original layout; partition walls (some with high openings with wire grille infill panels); and flat-sheeted ceilings with batten cover strips. However, doors and cubicles have been replaced, new partitions inserted in places, and some areas have been converted into storage space. Spaces beneath the entrance bay and walkway from Bayswater Street have been enclosed for storage space. Early timber benches survive along some walls in the corridors and play space. Non-significant elements of the undercroft include modern partitions, windows, doors and gates. The first and second floors originally contained ten classrooms each, but all have been enlarged by removing partitions and folding doors to merge adjacent classrooms, so that each floor has six classrooms in 2017. The former hat and cloak rooms have been merged with part of the adjacent corridor to form storage and staff rooms. The corridors have concrete floors with coved edges, plastered walls with an inscribed moulding line at shoulder height, and flat ceilings - plastered on the first floor; lined with flat sheeting and batten cover strips on the second floor. The stairwells have concrete stairs and iron balustrades with timber top rails and square, Art Deco-style posts. A timber Roll of Honour board is fixed to the southeast wall of the first floor, central wing corridor. The board is dedicated to those who served in World War I and lists 199 names of former Milton State School students who served. An early built-in timber cupboard survives in the teachers room on the south side of the first floor main entrance. In the classrooms, walls are generally plaster-lined with timber picture rails and lambs tongue-profile skirtings. Ceilings are lined with flat sheeting and ornamented by timber battens cover strips forming a grid pattern. Two square ceiling ventilation panels survive, one each on the second floor of the northwest and southeast wings. One set of original timber folding doors survives in the centre of the second floor central wing. The location of removed folding partitions is indicated by surviving bulkheads in other classrooms. Original timber double-hung windows with rectangular fanlights remain in the internal corridor walls. Most doors retain their rectangular fanlights. All doors on the first floor are modern replacements, apart from one set of double, part-glazed doors which have been relocated to the southeast wing (accessing the former hat room, now a cooking/staff room). Two identical doors are located on the second floor, accessing the former hat rooms. The second floor retains panelled, double doors with original hardware to most classrooms, and two early doors to the teachers rooms. Non-significant elements of the interior include: air-conditioning units, ceiling fans, lights and other services; modern floor linings of carpet and linoleum; and modern doors, glazing, partitions and cabinetry. = Timber classroom building (Block B) = Block B from southwest Block B is a rectangular, two storey timber building located near the northwest end of Block A. The building stands on low concrete stumps and is clad in timber weatherboards. The Dutch gable roof is clad in corrugated metal sheeting, with louvred vents to the gablets. The raked eaves have exposed rafters and are lined with timber VJ, T&G; boards. A verandah, now enclosed, runs along the southwest and northwest sides of the first floor, and an enclosed verandah runs along the northwest side of the ground floor. Access to the ground floor is via a two single doors - a main entrance in the centre of the northwest wall, and a secondary entrance at the eastern end of the southeast wall. Access to the first floor is via a main timber staircase to the southwest wall, and a secondary staircase at the northern corner. Windows are generally timber-framed, two or three-light casements, with fanlights above windows in the southeast wall. Windows in the northeast walls are fanlights alone, protected by skillion-roofed hoods with decorative brackets and clad in corrugated metal sheeting. A lean-to shed clad in weatherboards runs along the southwest side of the ground floor. The ground floor contains two rooms divided by modern folding doors. The walls and ceiling are lined with modern flat sheeting. Toilets occupy the enclosed verandah and have recently been renovated. The first floor contains two classrooms divided by a modern concertina door, with bulkheads and lines in the ceiling lining indicating the location of former partitions. The former southwest verandah forms part of the open classroom space, and retains its raked ceiling lined with timber VJ, T&G; boards. Walls are lined with flat sheeting. Two sets of early double timber doors survive, as well as the classroom ceilings of flat sheeting with timber batten cover strips, arranged in a grid pattern. The northwest verandah contains a series of small rooms and store rooms, divided by partitions from different periods. It retains it raked ceiling lined with timber VJ, T&G; boards. Non-significant elements of Block B include air-conditioning units, ceiling fans, lights and other services; modern floor linings of carpet and linoleum; the toilets fitout; and modern doors, glazing, partitions and cabinetry. = Grounds = Around Block A are a series of concrete retaining walls and stairs (1935‚Äì37) constructed to level the ground and create assembly and play spaces. A high retaining wall along Bayswater Street is topped by a concrete fence with three gateways, including a decorative wrought iron set of gates at the main entrance in front of Block A. Sections of the metal balustrades between the concrete posts have been replaced. At the northern end, this wall and fence continues perpendicular to Bayswater Street in line with the end of Block A, and incorporates a set of steps leading down towards Block B. At the southern end, the wall turns at an angle and slopes down adjacent to a concrete ramp, leading to the swimming pool level. Between the northwest and southeast wings on the eastern side of Block A is a large rectangular concrete platform, edged by a low retaining wall and set of concrete steps on the eastern side. These steps and part of the wall are now concealed beneath a recently constructed covered play area. Modern seating and shade structures on the platform are not of heritage significance. The school grounds contain numerous significant mature trees, including: a row of six camphor laurels (cinnamomum camphora) and a fig (likely a weeping fig, ficus benjamina) along Bayswater Street, from the Baroona Road corner; a large fig of the same species in the courtyard north of Block A's main entrance; another large fig south of Block A; a camphor laurel along the Haig Street boundary, near the corner of Bayswater Street; and rows of mature palms along the eastern school fence line, on the Gregory Park side. Views of the park and surrounding neighbourhood can be obtained from Block A and the school grounds. Standing in an open setting, backing onto a park and framed by mature trees, Block A is an attractive and prominent feature of the area.  Heritage listing  Milton State School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 April 2017 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Milton State School (established in 1889 as Rosalie State School) is important in demonstrating the evolution of state education and its associated architecture in Queensland. The place retains an excellent, representative example of a standard government-designed school building that was an architectural response to prevailing government educational philosophies. The Depression-era brick school building, retaining walls and stairs (1935‚Äì37) are a result of the Queensland Government's building and relief work programs during the 1930s that stimulated the economy and provided work for men unemployed as a result of the Great Depression. The 1923 timber building, adapted in 1936 for vocational training, demonstrates the pattern of relocating and re-purposing buildings at Queensland schools. It is the only surviving remnant of the earlier timber school complex at Milton State School. The World War I Honour Board (1916) is important in demonstrating the school community's involvement in a major world event. War memorials, including honour boards, are a tribute from the community to those who served, and those who died. They are an important element of Queensland's towns and cities and are also important in demonstrating a common pattern of commemoration across Queensland and Australia. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Milton State School is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a Queensland state school built during the Depression-era. These include: a large brick school building, set within a landscaped site with retaining walls, mature shade trees, assembly and play areas, and sporting facilities. The substantial Depression-era brick school building is an excellent, highly intact example of its type and retains a high degree of integrity. It demonstrates the principal characteristics of Depression-era Brick Schools, including: its symmetrically arranged two-storey form with an undercroft; high-quality design with ornamental features from one of a variety of styles; face brick exterior; terracotta-tiled roof; and projecting central entrance bay. The building has a linear layout, with rooms accessed by corridors, and an undercroft accommodating open play space and toilets. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Through its elegant composition of formal and decorative elements, substantial size and face brick exterior, the Depression-era brick school building at Milton State School has aesthetic significance due to its expressive attributes, by which the Department of Public Works sought to convey the concepts of progress and permanence. The building is also significant for its streetscape contribution. Standing in an open setting adjacent to a park and framed by mature trees, it is an attractive and prominent feature of the area. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Schools have always played an important part in Queensland communities. They typically retain significant and enduring connections with former pupils, parents, and teachers; provide a venue for social interaction and volunteer work; and are a source of pride, symbolising local progress and aspirations. Milton State School has a strong and ongoing association with the Milton community. It was established in 1889 through the fundraising efforts of the local community and generations of Milton children have been taught there. The place is important for its contribution to the educational development of Milton and is a prominent community focal point.

The land the plaza is built on was formerly part of the San Fernando convent from 1270-1840. The land was later acquired by the local government and converted into a public square. The plaza was completed in 1856. Name The plaza has undergone a series of name changes since the beginning of its construction in 1852: * 1852: Plaza Nueva * 1857: Infanta Isabel * 1868: Plaza de la Libertad * 1873: Plaza de la Rep√∫blica * 1875: Plaza de San Fernando * 1931: Plaza Nueva History Prior to the 11th century, the area that is now Plaza Nueva was part of the Guadalquivir river. In the 1981, while digging to construct the Seville Metro, remains of a 10th century ship and a two-meter-long 6th century Byzantine anchor were found under the plaza. By the 11th century the space was occupied by a cemetery and several orchards. From 1270-1840 the convent Convento Casa Grande de San Francisco occupied the area that is now Plaza Nueva. The convent and its gardens extended beyond the bounds of where the modern-day plaza is located, reaching as far as present day Calle Zaragoza. During the occupation of Seville by Napoleonic troops in the 19th century, the convent suffered great structural damage, including a fire in 1810. In 1840, the government decided to acquire the land and demolish what remained of the convent. The plaza was completed in 1856. Monument of Ferdinand III of Castile in Seville Top of the Monument of Fernando III depicting him on horseback In the center of the plaza is an equestrian statue of Fernando III who conquered Seville for the Christians in 1248, and later was declared a saint by the Catholic church in 1671. Since its construction, the designers of the plaza wanted to place a monument in the center of the plaza, thinking first of constructing a monument to Murillo and later thinking of erecting a statue of Isabella II. It was finally decided on to build a monument to Fernando III in 1920. The monument is the work of Spanish architect Juan Talavera y Heredia and was inaugurated in August 1924.

The episode was written and directed by James Wong. The tagline for this episode is \\"You see what I want you to see\\". Though not originally billed as a mythology episode, \\"Ghouli\\" helps to explore the series' overarching mythology and serves as the second of three mythology episodes of the season following the season premiere. The show centers on FBI special agents who work on unsolved paranormal cases called X-Files; focusing on the investigations of Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) after their reinstatement in the FBI. In this episode, A pair of teenage girls attack one another, each believing the other to be a monster, known as \\"Ghouli.\\" Mulder and Scully find that their investigation leads back to their long-lost son, William. Plot Two teenage girls, Sarah Turner (Madeleine Arthur) and Brianna Stapleton (Sarah Jeffery), enter a rusted out and abandoned ship, named Chimera. Each enters on their own, scoping out the docked vessel in the middle of the night. They hear each other‚Äôs steps, going around different levels of the ship. Both girls accuse each other of being \\"Ghouli.\\" Brianna grows impatient and runs across the rotten wood deck that collapses under her. She lands inside the bridge, where the terrified Sarah screams, wielding her knife at her. Each sees the other as the Ghouli. They end up stabbing each other. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) opens her eyes in the dark, sensing a presence behind her as she lies on a bed in a strange house. She explores the house and ends up in an endless pattern of the same room. It all turns out to be a dream. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) theorizes that the experience is a type of sleep paralysis. She tries to remember when she spots a picture on Mulder‚Äôs desk of the Chimera. She goes back to her memories of her sleep paralysis, where she grabs a snow globe with a model of the boat in it. At the crime scene, the agents meet with Detective Costa (Louis Ferreira). Aboard the ship, Scully notices a bloody handprint left by one of the girls on the bridge and questions who made the call. Costa informs them that it was an anonymous 9-1-1 call from a panicked male. Later, Scully‚Äôs attention is drawn to a man watching them from one of the portable walkways. Costa informs them that the victims asked if they found Ghouli. When Scully turns to check if the man is there, he‚Äôs gone. Mulder and Scully check the Internet and come across Ghouli.net. They question the two teenagers about the slashing. Both of them name their boyfriend, Jackson Van De Kamp, whose last name matches William's adoptive parents. The agents arrive at the Van De Kamp household, which Scully recognizes from her dream. Hearing two gunshots, the agents dash into the house and discover a man and a woman's bodies on the floor. A third shot is heard from the upstairs, where Scully finds the bleeding corpse of Jackson Van De Kamp. The agents search Jackson's room and find a book by Peter Wong, a pickup artist. Scully spots a snow globe. Scully enters the morgue to see Jackson‚Äôs body. She sits by his side and begins talking to him, not knowing if he could be her son. Mulder ushers her out of the room. As they leave the room, Jackson unzips his own body bag and escapes the morgue. Scully is lying on a couch and has another experience with sleep paralysis, with flashes to the bridge, the UFO hovering above, and the bloodied alien hand. She is awakened by Dr. Harris, who tells her that Jackson's body has disappeared. Scully runs into the man that she spotted at the docks, Peter Wong (Fran√ßois Chau). Wong questions Scully about her windmill and tells her to not give up on the bigger picture. Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) meets with Mulder at the Chimera, telling him to drop the investigation. Mulder refuses and tells him that Jackson's DNA matches Scully's. The agents assume that William is at the hospital where the two girls are being treated. There, Jackson explains to Brianna that he‚Äôs been hiding because there are people after him and that he \\"made up\\" the Ghouli. Mulder and Scully arrive at the hospital and meet up with Costa, who tells them that Jackson is alive. It turns out that Sarah sent Costa a text with a picture of Jackson and Brianna kissing. Jackson tries to leave but is chased by Defense Department operatives. Cornered inside a supply closet, he resorts to tricking one of the operatives into thinking that the other is a monster, killing him. Jackson hides under a desk, while Mulder and Scully find two other operatives on the ground. Jackson escapes by projecting himself as a scared nurse. The next day, Scully spots a rural gas station that has a windmill just outside, just like in the snow globe. Mulder goes to use the restroom and Scully meets with Peter Wong. Both of them engage in a conversation, with Wong mentioning that he wishes he could know her better. After Wong drives away, Mulder asks Scully whom she was talking to, prompting her to remember Wong, the author of the book found in Jackson's room. The agents go in the store and ask to see the surveillance tapes. In the recording, Scully is having a conversation with William. She smiles as Mulder holds her while they see their son, alive. Production=Filming= Filming for the season began in August 2017 in Vancouver, British Columbia, where the previous season was filmed, along with the show's original five seasons. =Writing= Wong was inspired to write this episode after having an experience with sleep paralysis in Mexico as he was shooting a movie. \\"I experienced this crazy thing in a hotel: I felt a presence in the room, I couldn‚Äôt move. I was being chased or chased after this entity and then was in bed again. That was the genesis. It really affected me. So that‚Äôs how I started with it. And it was the fifth episode, so we wanted to have a touchstone to the mythology of it all. [Executive producers] Chris [Carter], Glen [Morgan], Darin [Morgan] and I all talked about the idea of William. But I also loved the monster episodes. So it was how can we meld those two ideas that I love into something that is connected to William. And then you go, wait a second, William has special powers. So all of those ideas thread into each other and became this episode. I love hinting at one thing and the reality is different.\\" Reception \\"Ghouli\\" received very positive reviews from critics.

The episode was written by Gabe Rotter and directed by Carol Banker. It was aired on February 7, 2018, on Fox. The tagline for this episode is \\"A war is never over\\". The show centers on FBI special agents who work on unsolved paranormal cases called X-Files; focusing on the investigations of Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) after their reinstatement in the FBI. In this episode, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) disappears after he receives a disturbing message from his past. Mulder and Scully are charged with finding him but as they start to uncover his secrets, they begin to question whether they can trust him. Plot In 1969, during the Vietnam War, a platoon of U.S. Marines including Walter Skinner and John \\"Kitten\\" James are tasked with escorting a crate marked \\"MK-NAOMI\\" to a rendezvous point. They come under enemy fire as they reach the landing zone and are forced to take shelter with a group of civilians in a hut. As Skinner doubles back to help a wounded soldier, the crate is damaged by gunfire and Kitten is exposed to a green gas. When he returns to the hut, Skinner finds Kitten has murdered the civilians. In the present, Fox Mulder and Dana Scully are called before FBI Director Alvin Kersh, who informs them that Skinner has vanished without explanation. The agents search Skinner's apartment and find out he was mailed a severed human ear. Mulder identifies the parcel as coming from the town of Mud Lick, Kentucky. During their journey to the town, Scully finds that Skinner's service record and the records of his platoon are classified as top secret. Mulder and Scully arrive to find a body in the local morgue missing an ear; Mulder realizes that the victim was killed by a punji stake‚Äîa Viet Cong booby trap. Scully questions the sheriff about a mass hysteria gripping the town amid claims of a monster lurking in the nearby woods and people inexplicably losing their teeth. The body of Banjo, another Vietnam veteran, is found at the bottom of a punji pit. A nearby camera, supposedly used to monitor deer in the area, has recorded Banjo's death and shows Skinner approaching the pit shortly after Banjo fell in. Mulder and Scully lose the support of local authorities when they admit Skinner is their boss, and are unable to convince the sheriff that he is innocent. Mulder continues to watch the video and sees a hooded and cloaked figure lurking in the woods: the \\"monster\\" terrorizing the town, which Mulder immediately dismisses as a person in a costume. Skinner approaches Davey James, Kitten's son, in his hunting cabin. Davey accuses Skinner of failing to help Kitten, explaining that Kitten became increasingly violent after being exposed to MK-NAOMI and was court-martialed upon his return home. Kitten was committed to a mental health facility outside Mud Lick, partly due to Skinner's testimony. Skinner describes that his superiors prevented him from telling the truth regarding the gas which turned him into a killer. Davey reveals that all of the soldiers exposed to MK-NAOMI were sent to the same facility and continued to be experimented on, implying that Kitten's initial exposure was orchestrated by the government. Initially an attempt to turn soldiers into more efficient weapons of war by channeling their fear into aggression, the scope of MK-NAOMI was expanded to become a means of controlling peoples' minds. Skinner asks Davey to take him to Kitten; Davey leads him to a tree where Kitten hung himself after leaving the facility. As he approaches Kitten's body, Skinner falls into another punji pit and is impaled on a spike. Davey abandons him as Mulder and Scully arrive, having looked into Vietnam veterans in the area. Davey claims no knowledge of Skinner and starts ranting about a government conspiracy to control the population with MK-NAOMI, which he claims is a perfected version of MK-ULTRA. The agents ostensibly accept his explanation and leave, but Mulder suspects Davey after noticing photos of Kitten and Skinner in his cabin. He doubles back and investigates the cabin, finding the \\"monster\\" costume from the video. A search of the area leads him to Skinner in the punji pit. Davey attempts to ambush them, but is caught and killed by one of his own booby traps. Mulder and Scully ask Skinner about a claim made by Kersh that they were responsible for Skinner's lack of career advancement. Skinner admits that his prior experience with Kitten and MK-NAOMI in Vietnam shook his faith in the government, but their willingness to pursue the truth wherever it takes them restored his faith in people and holding shadowy government to account. He resolves to return to Washington and use his position to fight the government's abuse of power. As Skinner leaves, one of his teeth falls out, implying that he has been exposed to MK-NAOMI. In the epilogue, a crop duster is seen spraying a field with a green gas as Davey's warnings about government conspiracies are repeated in voiceover. Production After season 10, actor Mitch Pileggi said to series creator Chris Carter regarding the lack of use his character, \\"I was whining last season about not having enough screen time or not having enough to do on the show. And at one point when I was talking to Chris about it, I said, 'Is Skinner really hard to write for?' And he was like, 'No.' And I was like, 'Well, how come we haven't done it?',\\" he says, laughing. \\"It's funny, because Gabe Rotter was standing there, listening to this conversation, and he said that was when the light went off in his head.\\" Filming for the season began in August 2017 in Vancouver, British Columbia, where the previous season was filmed, along with the show's original five seasons. The episode features the return of James Pickens Jr. as Alvin Kersh, who last appeared in the original series finale episode which aired in May 2002. Also guest starring is Haley Joel Osment playing a father-son role of John \\"Kitten\\" James (in flashbacks) and Davey James (in the present), whose casting was announced in October 2017. The role of young Walter Skinner was played by Mitch Pileggi's nephew, Cory Rempel. The episode was written by producer Gabe Rotter, his first writing credit for the series. Rotter had previously served as a writers' assistant during season 9. It was directed by Carol Banker, who was a script supervisor on the original series and who also directed an episode of The Lone Gunmen. Reception \\"Kitten\\" received generally positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 75% with an average rating of 6.44 out of 10 based on 8 reviews.

Darden's case was notable because of the 14 years that he spent on death row between his death sentence and his execution, which, at the time, was longer than the time any other inmate in the United States had spent on death row prior to their execution. He was also notable for the number of protests and amount of controversy and attention that his case attracted worldwide, as well as the unusually large number of death warrants that he lived through prior to his execution. Early Life Willie Darden was born in Greene County, North Carolina on June 1, 1933. He was born during the Jim Crow era of racial discrimination and segregation, and his family lived in poverty as Darden grew up. His father was an auto-mechanic, and his great-grandfather had been a slave who was also born in Greene County. Darden's mother was 15 years old at the time of his birth, and two years after he was born, she died while giving birth to another child. Because of his family's poverty, Darden could not attend school regularly and instead worked in the farms, eventually dropping out of school after completing the eighth grade. When Darden was a teenager, he started breaking the law, starting after he was caught stealing from a mailbox. Upon his first violation of the law at the age of 16, Darden was sent to a juvenile detention facility. After being discharged, Darden had trouble finding work and was eventually rearrested for cashing a bad check. He received a 4-year sentence in prison for the bad check. Until the murder in 1973, Darden was repeatedly in and out of prison for a variety of crimes, including assault, forgery, theft, and attempted rape. At the time of the murder, Darden was on furlough from prison while serving 20 years in a Florida prison for attempting to rape a 70-year-old woman in 1968. Crime and trial On September 8, 1973, sometime that the police estimated to be between 6:00 and 6:30 PM, there was a robbery of a Carl's Furniture Store, located in Lakeland, Florida. During the robbery, James Carl Turman and his 16-year-old neighbor Phillip Arnold were shot. Arnold survived the shooting, but Turman died. The robber also attempted to rape Turman's wife prior to shooting and murdering Turman. Darden was arrested later that day for a traffic violation. While he was in jail for the traffic violation, investigators tied Darden to the murder of Turman as well as a string of similar robberies and assaults in the area. Subsequently, Darden was charged with murder and robbery. Darden, who was black, had an all-white jury at his trial, which took place in January 1974. The state had intentionally excluded black people from serving on the jury, a practice that was later declared unconstitutional in 1986, and a U.S. Supreme Court Justice, Harry Blackmun, would later declare that the jury selection in Darden's case was improper and violated his constitutional rights. Additionally, according to trial records, the prosecutor in Darden's trial, C. Ray McDaniel, made racially charged remarks, including repeatedly calling Darden an \\"animal\\" that needed to be \\"chained up\\" and expressing a desire to see Darden \\"sitting here with no face, blown away by a shotgun.\\" Three witnesses to Turman's murder ‚Äì Turman's wife, Phillip Arnold, and another neighbor ‚Äì identified Darden as the murderer. None of them were ever asked to identify Darden in a police lineup, but they identified him in court, although Turman's wife had difficulty identifying Darden and Phillip Arnold described the killer as being larger than Darden was. Darden's lawyers did not challenge the eyewitnesses at the trial. A woman named Christine Bass claimed that Darden had been at her house during the time that the murder was committed, from 4:00 PM to 5:30 PM, saying that Darden had needed to use her phone to call for help. Darden's defense attorneys never called her to testify. Additionally, years after the trial, the victim's minister gave an affidavit claiming that he was called to the crime scene and arrived at 5:55 PM, which meant that the crime would have happened prior to the time that the police said it had. Both the victim's minister and Bass gave affidavits that would have helped Darden with constructing his alibi. Nevertheless, on January 23, 1974, Willie Darden was convicted of the murder and robbery of James Carl Turman. The jury recommended the death penalty, and he was sentenced to death. He was received on death row at the Florida State Prison on January 29, 1974. Death row, appeals, and execution During Darden's time on death row, hundreds of people worldwide protested his death sentence, including Pope John Paul II, Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov, the human rights organization Amnesty International (who started a petition that gathered 10,000 signatures from people in the Netherlands who were opposed to Darden's execution), and the Reverend Jesse Jackson, who called Darden's death sentence \\"another example that injustice is still alive and well and that equal opportunity is still denied black Americans even in death.\\" Two months before his execution, Darden appeared on an episode of 20/20 on ABC and an episode of West 57th on CBS. In 1979, Florida governor Bob Graham signed Darden's first death warrant. Darden had his first execution date set for Wednesday, May 23, 1979, on the same day as fellow death row inmate John Spenkelink. The execution was planned to be a double execution, and he and Spenkelink would have been the first inmates in the United States since 1967 to have been put to death without forgoing all appeals and volunteering for execution. However, at the time that the warrant was signed, Darden still had multiple appeals pending. As a result, 14 hours before Darden was scheduled to be executed on May 23, he received a federal stay of execution. Spenkelink would go on to be executed two days later, on May 25, 1979. At the time of his execution, Darden had been on death row for 14 years, longer than any other condemned inmate in the United States at the time. He had also lived through six separate death warrants, including the one that scheduled his execution for May 23, 1979. Another death warrant scheduled Darden's execution for September 2, 1985, and even though the U.S. Supreme Court rejected his request for a stay of execution that evening, they later agreed to grant Darden a petition for writ of certiorari six hours before he was scheduled to be electrocuted. Overall, six times, Darden received stays of execution prior to the scheduled execution. However, newly elected Florida governor Bob Martinez signed Darden's seventh death warrant in early 1988. This warrant would eventually lead to Darden's execution. Willie Darden was executed in Florida's electric chair on March 15, 1988. He was pronounced dead at 7:12 AM.

CC-BY 3.0 Extrapulmonary tuberculosis is tuberculosis (TB) within a location in the body other than the lungs. This occurs in 15‚Äì20% of active cases, causing other kinds of TB. These are collectively denoted as \\"extrapulmonary tuberculosis\\". Extrapulmonary TB occurs more commonly in immunosuppressed persons and young children. In those with HIV, this occurs in more than 50% of cases. Notable extrapulmonary infection sites include the pleura (in tuberculous pleurisy), the central nervous system (in tuberculous meningitis), the lymphatic system (in scrofula of the neck), the genitourinary system (in urogenital tuberculosis), and the bones and joints (in Pott disease of the spine), among others. Spread to lymph nodes is the most common. An ulcer originating from nearby infected lymph nodes may occur and is painless, slowly enlarging and has an appearance of \\"wash leather\\". When it spreads to the bones, it is known as \\"osseous tuberculosis\\", a form of osteomyelitis. Tuberculosis has been present in humans since ancient times. A potentially more serious, widespread form of TB is called \\"disseminated tuberculosis\\", also known as miliary tuberculosis. Miliary TB currently makes up about 10% of extrapulmonary cases. Tuberculous peritonitis There are three forms of tuberculous peritonitis: *Wet type presents with abundant and relatively increased density ascites (20-45 HU), smooth peritoneal thickening and omental smudge. Thickened strands with crowded vascular bundles in the mesentery are characteristic. CC-BY 4.0 *Fixed fibrotic form- With imaging appears as omental mass, matted bowel loops and nodular / irregular thickening of bowel and mesentery, and sometimes with loculated ascites. This form is considered as great mimic of peritoneal carcinomatosis. *The dry or plastic form causes a fibrous reaction in the peritoneum results in adhesion of bowel loops and caseous lymph nodes. Other findings in the abdomen such as miliary microabscesses in the liver or spleen, splenomegaly, splenic or lymph node calcification, inflammatory thickening of the terminal ileum and caecum, patulous I-C junction and low attenuation lymphadenopathy may help suggest tuberculosis as the etiology of diffuse peritoneal disease.

The plant is poorly understood and was previously confused with its relative Vigna minima. Description Vigna dalzelliana is a twining herb. Its stems are slender and covered with minute hairs, or trichomes. Its leaf petioles are covered with the same white trichomes, and are long. Its leaflets are oval-shaped and pointy, or acuminate, towards their apex. The leaflets range from in length. The herb's inflorescence is axillary, meaning it rises from the same node as a leaf rather than from the end of a stem. The peduncle of the plant is covered with the same white trichomes as the stem. Its flower petals are a pale yellow. Habitat and ecology The plant is common to Thailand, Cambodia, India and Sri Lanka, and grows between in altitude. It is a common component of the ground flora in monsoon forests, and particularly Sal forests. It grows in shady wet highland slopes where the plant can root from stem nodes. Uses Livestock often graze on the plant, and it is a good soil binder and can be used for soil conservation. Conservation The monsoon forest habitat of the plant is threatened by the general expansion of human populations, especially by expansion of farmland. The species is listed as present in Sanjay Gandhi National Park in India and various national parks in Thailand. It is also present in the national gene bank in New Delhi.

It has linear leaves and stipules. The bilaterally symmetrical purple flowers have five petals and a spur. It grows in fynbos and is an endemic species of the southern Western Cape province of South Africa, where it is called wild violet, a name used for other species elsewhere in the world.  Description  Viola decumbens is a small shrub with very fine granules on its green parts, and a woody base. The erect branching stems are up to high. It carries alternately set, slightly succulent, linear, green leaves long and ¬Ω‚Äî2 mm (0.02‚Äî0.08 in) wide with a pointed tip and an entire margin. The bracts (or stipules) to the right and left of the foot of the leaf proper are also linear, clinging to the leaf blade (or adnate), and with a small tooth on each side at the base. cited on The somewhat scented, nodding flowers grow individually from the leaf axils on long flower stalks (or pedicels) so the flowers are above the leaves, with two small bracts almost opposite each other in the upper part of the stalk. The five sepals are narrowly oval in shape with a pointed tip and are long. The five petals are purple or violet, veined, with the four upper ones oblong and long, the lower one shorter and connected to a long, tube-shaped, blunt spur. The orange anthers hang together (in jargon connivent), and two have extensions that reach into the spur and produce nectar. The ovary is globe-shaped, and later develops into an oval capsule long. The capsule contains oval yellow seeds long, with very fine granules. Viola decumbens flowers from July right through to December in the southern hemisphere.  Taxonomy  The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus the Younger in 1782. New research suggests it belongs to the section Xylinosium, together with two species from the Mediterranean: V. arborescens and V. saxifraga. The species name decumbens refers to the fact that the stems are creeping at their base.  Distribution and habitat  Viola decumbens occurs only in the extreme south of the Western Cape, for instance in the Kogelberg en Hottentots Holland area. It prefers moist sandy soils on low altitude slopes.

It is owned and operated by the state-owned company Bota≈ü. Background The construction of the Ceyhan‚ÄìKƒ±rƒ±kkale Oil Pipeline began in May 1983 and completed in February 1986. It was built by the Tekfen Construction and Installation. The -long pipeline crosses steep slopes of Taurus Mountains. The pipeline was commissioned in 1986 to make the 1986-built Kƒ±rƒ±kkale Refinery operational. Technical features The pipeline transports crude oil from Bota≈ü Ceyhan Oil Terminal to T√ºpra≈ü Kƒ±rƒ±kkale Oil Refinery for refining purpose. Bota≈ü Ceyhan Oil Terminal is located in Ceyhan, Adana Province in southern Turkey on the northern coast of Gulf of Alexandretta at northeastern Mediterranean Sea. T√ºpra≈ü Kƒ±rƒ±kkale Oil Refinery is located in Kƒ±rƒ±kkale Province, central Anatolia. The Bota≈ü Ceyhan Oil terminal is the end point of the Kirkuk‚ÄìCeyhan Oil Pipeline carrying crude oil from Iraq to Turkey. The Ceyhan Terminal has twelve oil storage tanks with each capacity. At the arrival point of the pipeline, the refinery has one storage tank of capacity. The pipeline's discharge capacity is or annually for crude oil of 23‚Äì47 API gravity, equivalent to 7.2 million tonnes per year. In 2016, a total of 4.9 million tonnes (35,4 million barrels) were transported. The source of the transported oil either Iraq by the Kirkuk‚ÄìCeyhan Pipeline or local or imported oil by sea. Oil theft From time to time, the pipeline becomes subject to oil theft. In 2006, thieves were caught in √áakaldere, Ceyhan village, Adana after they tapped oil from the pipeline into a tank truck. Thieves were caught in the act the same year after having loaded oil to a tank truck from the pipeline in Y√ºreƒüir district of Adana. In Yƒ±lankale, Ceyhan village, thieves caused a fire at the pipeline in 2007 as they tried to bore a hole in the pipeline. Damage in the environment arose through oil spilled out. In Kƒ±lƒ±√ßlƒ±, Y√ºreƒüir village, thieves were arrested in 2009 while they were loading a 20-t tank truck by a hose from a hole in the pipeline.

Burr Burleigh) was an American minister, writer, public speaker, and women's rights activist. She was involved with the woman's club movement and held various positions in women's rights clubs.  Biography  Unitarian Church Brooklyn, Connecticut Burleigh was born at Cazenovia, New York, on September 18, 1826. She was the adopted child of Henry and Sara Tibbitts. She received her initial childhood schooling at a one-room school house a mile from her home. When she was sixteen she became a teacher at Cazenovia Seminary. Burleigh married Corydon Bryant Kellum of Albany, New York in 1844 when she was eighteen and they moved to Cincinnati, Ohio. The couple had two children who died young. In 1849 Burleigh became an editor of a journal called The Great West and worked at that for about a year. She divorced Kellum in 1850 and moved to New York City. Burleigh then developed a relationship with Charles Chauncey Burr and married him in 1851. She wrote for newspapers and magazines using the pen name \\"Celia Burr.\\" She also was a lyricist and published a few songs in collaboration with some musicians. The marriage to Burr ended in 1853. Starting in 1855 she served as a director for a boarding school. Later she became a teacher in Syracuse, New York. There she also wrote articles for the Christian Register and lectured on women's suffrage. In 1862 Burleigh accepted a position as personal secretary for the educator Emma Willard, who was then 75. In 1864, she had developed a relationship with social activist William Henry Burleigh, a New York City harbor master. She had initially met him in 1850 in Syracuse. They married on September 7, 1865. They were close to the Second Unitarian Society minister, John White Chadwick. Later the Burleighs separated, but both continued to live in Brooklyn, New York. He continued as a harbor master and she took up a career in journalism. Burleigh in 1868 was one of the founding members of Sorosis and became its main fund-raiser and lecturer. The society was formed in protest to one of her associates being excluded from an all men's press club dinner. The organization consisted of twelve women that wanted to promote deeper association between women writers and artists. She helped organize the Brooklyn Woman's Club in 1869, becoming its first president. She served as secretary for the American Equal Rights Association in early 1870. Burleigh stood on the platform at the Convention of the Northwestern Woman's Suffrage Association alongside Susan B. Anthony. She was a public speaker and activist for women's rights. Burleigh picked up an interest in ministry. She was invited to be the summer minister at the Unitarian church of Brooklyn, Connecticut in July 1871. She developed a strong following in a short time and was asked to stay on as their permanent minister. Burleigh became the first woman pastor ordained into the Unitarian ministry. She was ordained and given the parish in Brooklyn on October 5, 1871. Among those officiating at the ordination were Reverend John Chadwick and Julia Ward Howe. In 1873 she resigned from the ministry because of poor health due to breast cancer. Burleigh spent her last days in Syracuse and died there on July 27, 1875. She is buried at the city's South Cemetery.

Early life  Bailey was born on June 12, 1945 to Hicks Walker and Hettie Bryant. She was a descendant of Bilali Muhammad, an enslaved person and a Muslim from West Africa who worked on Thomas Spalding's plantation. Bailey grew up in the settlement of Belle Marsh on Sapelo Island, one of many communities that traced their heritage back to freed slaves who purchased land on the isolated island.  Career  Bailey left Sapelo Island briefly to live with family on St. Simons Island, then settled in Hog Hammock on her return to the island in 1966. Bailey ran a guest house there, The Wallow Lodge, with her husband Julius Bailey and their seven children. She took pride in her heritage, which she described specifically as Saltwater Geechee. She worked to preserve and document Geechee-Gullah stories and ways of life in the face of a dwindling population and increasing real estate development ‚Äì a trend bringing wealthy white people to build large vacation homes on the historically black island. She taught crafts she herself had learned from her father: basket weaving, cast net knitting, herb collecting, and midwifery. She was known locally as a griot, a storyteller and unofficial historian of Sapelo Island. Bailey traveled to Sierra Leone in 1989, where she investigated the links between Sapelo Island and West African traditions. She noted similar forms of vernacular architecture, as well as similar agricultural techniques and cooking styles. Bailey served as vice president of the Sapelo Island Cultural and Revitalization Society, which she co-founded in 1993 with Inez Grovner. They began organizing Sapelo Island Cultural Days, held annually in October, which aimed to bring in tourists and generate income to help preserve the community. = Writing = Her first book, the memoir \\"God, Dr. Buzzard, and the Bolito Man: A Saltwater Geechee Talks About Life on Sapelo Island, Georgia,\\" was written with Christena Bledsoe and published in 2000. The book collects stories about her own childhood, as well as tales about her ancestors and the history of Sapelo Island. Bailey was one of the authors, with Ray Crook, Norma Harris, and Karen Smith, of \\"Sapelo Voices: Historical Anthropology and the Oral Traditions of Gullah-Geechee Communities on Sapelo Island, Georgia\\", published in 2003 by The State University of West Georgia. In the book, which collects oral history interviews that were conducted in 1992, she asks questions of the island's elders and joins them in reminiscences of the ways of the past. = Agricultural revival = Bailey worked with cuisine revivalists to bring Purple Ribbon sugarcane, a strain close to extinction, to Sapelo Island. They planted it on her farm in Hog Hammock as well as at Dr. Bill Thomas and Jerome Dixon's Georgia Coastal Gourmet Farms in nearby Shellman Bluff. Its first yield ‚Äì 50 gallons of Sapelo Purple Ribbon Sugarcane Syrup ‚Äì was harvested just after her death in late 2017. Bailey and her family worked with Georgia Coastal Gourmet Farms to cultivate Sapelo Red Peas, Sapelo's first commercial crop, and brought their first harvest to market in 2014. She had a wide network of academics, scientists, and chefs who supported her work with farming and food, including food historian David Shields, geneticist Stephen Kresovich, chef Linton Hopkins, and chef Sean Brock. = Legacy and honors = In 2004, she received a Governor's Award in the Humanities for her cultural preservation work. Bailey died on October 15, 2017 in Brunswick, Georgia at the age of 72.

Biography Bessie Morse grew up in a farm in Jefferson County, Missouri, and later moved to De Soto, Missouri. She attended a country school until thirteen years old, then the De Soto High School, the Kirksville Normal School, Soper School of Oratory in Chicago, and schools of that kind in Boston and New York. In New York she assisted the principal of the American Academy of Dramatic Art, and since then she visited every year in Boston and Chicago for the purpose of getting new ideas. She moved from DeSoto to St. Louis in 1900. She conducted private classes in her studio for five years. Before that she traveled under the management of a lyceum bureau as a reader, touring the North, South and West under their auspices, also giving private recitals during that time. For ten years Morse gave lecture recitals. The Morse School of Expression was founded by Bessie Morse in 1907 and was hosted in the Musical Arts Building, at 457 Boyle Avenue, St. Louis. Morse was also principal of the school. Moreover, she acted as judge in declamatory contests. According to the St. Louis Star \\"her success is due to her thorough understanding of her chosen art, to her admirable personality, also her zeal and devotion to her profession. The Morse School of Expression was among the best equipped dramatic schools in the Middle West. The Morse School of Expression taught elocution, oratory, literature, dramatic art, physical culture, and aesthetic dancing. The method adopted by Morse, who was also a well-known platform lecturer, was that of natural expression. The central idea was the training of the mind, body and voice at the same time. When the voice was thoroughly trained it responded perfectly to every thought, and the body likewise, so that there was perfect harmony. Among the graduates Morse sent out from her school who were distinguishing themselves were: Maud W. Barnes, director of the Department of Expression in Ouachita College, Arkadelphia, Arkansas, one of the largest seminaries in that State; Valerine Dunn, who went first with the Suburban Stock Company, and then was director of the Department of expression in the Visitation Convent of Mobile, Alabama; Mina Pearl Finger of Marissa, Illinois, who occupied the same position for the Lindenwood College, St. Charles, Missouri; Eunice Green, connected with the Sacred Heart Convent in St. Charles, where she was the director of physical culture; Naomi Weston Childers, gained success as the ingenue in the \\"Madame X\\" Company of Henry W. Savage; Geraldine Albert, teacher of Expression in the Academy of the Visitation, St. Louis; Madeline McNabb, studied in Boston and made a reputation in that city; Caroline Delano Johnson, of St. Louis, Cathryn Cravens, commentator on radio, Kathrine Snodgrass, also known as Jane Porter, who conducted the Magic Kitchen program on radio, Therese Wittler, winner of the Samuel French award and Marjorie Moffett, actress and impersonator. Morse's school was the only one of its kind conducted by a woman in St. Louis. In 1917 Morse wrote Principles of Expression, which she used as a text book in her school. She later wrote The Art of Speech. In 1923 she spent a summer in Honolulu giving recitals in private homes, and the next winter did the same in New York City. She was a charter member of the Society of St. Louis Authors and a member of the Cornelia Green Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. She died January 10, 1948, and is buried in the Old Cemetery at DeSoto, Missouri.

Money-lender and Landlord James Maynard was the son of Levi and Sarah Maynard, staunch Wesleyan settlers from Huntingdonshire, who arrived in the Cape in 1820. He inherited substantial wealth and settled in the suburb of Wynberg, Cape Town, as an influential money lender. He invested his profits mainly in land, and became one of Cape Town's most powerful landlords. Politician His growing economic and political influence in the region then known as the Cape Division (southern Cape Peninsula) helped him to get elected to represent it in the first Cape Parliament in 1854. However he was not a successful or popular representative.R. Kilpin: The Old Cape House. Cape Town: Maskew Miller.J.L. McCracken: The Cape Parliament, 1854-1910. Clarendon Press: Oxford. 1967 Maynardville estate Maynardville, the well-known public park and open-air theatre in Cape Town, was originally one of Maynard's properties. He had taken it over from one of his insolvent debtors, a widow named Ellert, in 1838. He then bought the other portion of this \\"Rozendal\\" property from the same woman, and combined them to establish the estate which he named \\"Maynard's Villa.\\" Maynard had a deep interest in the Emperor Napoleon, and went to great lengths to acquire artifacts from Napoleon's St Helena tomb. He purchased the tomb gates, to install for his estate's driveway. He also acquired cuttings of the trees that grew around Napoleon's tomb, to cultivate as groves around his estate. After his death, this \\"Maynardville\\" estate was taken over by his nephew, William Mortimer Maynard Farmer, who became a wealthy businessman just like his uncle. The house was enlarged for elaborate functions and entertaining guests, and Farmer likewise secured political office at one point, winning the Wynberg seat in the Cape Parliament (1879-1883). The Maynardville property remained in Farmer's family until his grandson Gerald sold it to the Cape Town City Council in 1949. The dilapidated house remained empty, but the grounds of the estate were declared a public open space. In 1950, an open-air theatre was established on the property, by a small committee of women from the Cape Flats suburb of Athlone. It first put on dance productions to raise money for underprivileged schools. From 1956 the theatre also began productions of Shakespearean plays, and the Maynardville Open-Air Theatre has grown into a major institution of Cape Town.History of Maynardvillehttp://esat.sun.ac.za/index.php/Maynardville_Open-air_Theatre Personal life Maynard only married relatively late in life, to Sarah Ann (Anna Sarah) Lewin, and the couple had no children.

Both the Oracle and PostgreSQL database management systems are supported for its data storage.  tranSMART 17.1 = Development project = Researchers reported missing functionalities in the earlier versions of tranSMART (version 16.2 and before), which restricted the capabilities of the tool and opportunities for research. In response, tranSMART Foundation brought together four leading pharmaceutical companies ‚Äì Pfizer, Sanofi, Abbvie and Roche ‚Äì together in October 2016 to help sponsor a joint project to develop the new functionality in a coherent way and improve tranSMART. The Hyve BV was the IT company responsible for the execution of the tranSMART 17.1 development project. = Improvements of tranSMART version 17.1 = The focus of the sponsors was to add three main functionalities: # Cross-study and ontology term support. # Support for modeling time series and sample data, to allow the storage of longitudinal and EHR data. # Creating the connection between tranSMART and Arvados, to support large data storage and analysis. In addition, another goal of the project was to improve the quality of the tranSMART back-end to make it ready for the future. The back-end improvements implemented in the development project, delivered early in 2017, had a large impact on the capabilities of tranSMART, as well as its quality nowadays. Functional improvements of the 17.1 version include the support for time series, samples, and cross-study concepts. This is accomplished by re-alignment with the i2b2 data model, on top of which tranSMART was built, extended with the features which make tranSMART unique: the organization in studies, the support for modelling clinical trial event grouping and high dimensional data support. Technical improvements include automated-test coverage for all Core API and REST API calls and documentation of those calls and the full database schema. = The interface = The new functionalities developed in the tranSMART 17.1 project, however, were not supported by the existing tranSMART user interface. Therefore, The Hyve BV started the development of a new, modern user interface for tranSMART 17.1 that would accommodate the added functionalities. In October 2018, Glowing Bear, the user interface built on tranSMART version 17.1 for cohort selection and exploratory analyses, was released. This user interface has been adopted by leading medical and research institutions such as the Princess M√°xima Center for Pediatric Oncology, the Netherlands Twin Registry (NTR), and Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC). = Challenges = The 17.1 project failed to meet its objectives for compatibility with the i2b2 data model, and still lacks the functionality of the full tranSMART interface. The 17.1 code is only server-side code and was only released by the Foundation as a 'developer release' and never met the requirements for a full release. A new release of tranSMART (v19) is now in beta test, and not only meets the compatibility requirements with i2b2, but has an enhanced user interface with additional analytical workflows. This release will be supported by the Foundation, and will be the sole branch of the codebase to continue with support from the i2b2 tranSMART Foundation.

Life Han Empire in 195, the year after Chen Xi's rebellion was quelled. The vassal or princely states of Dai, Zhao, and Yan lie to the north and northeast. Chen Xi came from Yuanqu, a former city in what is now Longwangmiao Village in the Mudan District of Heze, Shandong. His early life and circumstances are not recorded,. but Liu Bang came to place great trust in him and his abilities. The Chu general Xiang Yu defeated Zhang Han at Julu (within present-day Pingxiang County, Xingtai, Hebei) in 207, effectively ending the Qin Empire. Chen joined Liu with 500 conscripts the next year, pledging his loyalty at the beginning of the internecine wars that became known as the Chu‚ÄìHan Contention. Chen held Bashang ( B√†sh√†ng) near present-day Xi'an and was named Liu's \\"Guerrilla General\\" (t s Y√≥uj√≠ JiƒÅngj≈´n). The 202 Battle of Gaixia (near Suzhou in Anhui) ended the conflict in Liu Bang's favor, and he declared the beginning of the Han Dynasty. Some of the other kings of the Chinese states chaffed at the restoration of imperial rule. Zang Tu had been named king of Yan by Xiang Yu, secured his title by removing its previous occupant Han Guang by force, and been confirmed in Yan and Liaodong by Liu Bang. Before the end of 202, however, he rebelled against the new empire and invaded its central northern commanderies, collectively known as \\"Dai\\" from a former kingdom of that name, which lay to his west in what is now northern Hebei and Shanxi.. Chen Xi resisted Zang in Dai and helped the emperor's push into Yan, where Zang Tu was captured, executed, and replaced with the emperor's long-time comrade Lu Wan. The next year in 201, the Xiongnu nomads‚Äîwho may have been allied with Zang, although this isn't recorded‚Äîinvaded Dai and forced the surrender of Han Xin, a former king of Han who had been moved into the north by the emperor and opted to make his capital at the exposed frontier town of Mayi (present-day Shuozhou in northern Shanxi) instead of at Jinying (present- day Taiyuan). Despite his long support of Liu Bang, Han came under suspicion of revolt and concluded an alliance with the Xiongnu chanyu Modu to protect himself. Learning of this arrangement, the emperor marched north in 200 and defeated Han Xin in battle; Han was able, however, to escape into exile among the nomads; and the Xiongnu were able to defeat Liu Bang's invasion of their lands at Baideng near present-day Datong. Chen again served with distinction during this campaign, though the details are not noted in his biographies. For his service in either the Yan or Dai campaigns (the attribution varies in different chapters of the Records of the Grand Historian), Chen Xi was enfeoffed as Marquis of Yangxia (t s Y√°ngxi√† H√≥u) and named a \\"ranking\\" marquis ( li√®h√≥u) rather than the usual grade. In 198, King Ao of Zhao was discovered to be plotting against the emperor. As he was married to the emperor's eldest daughter Princess Yuan, he was not executed but demoted to marquis status. The emperor's son Prince Ruyi was named to succeed him as king of Zhao, and in 197 Chen Xi was sent from Chang'an to act as chancellor for the young boy's realm. He was given control of most of the Han army defending what is now Shanxi and Hebei against the Xiongnu nomads to their north. Imperial envoys sent to monitor the new chancellor apparently implicated him and his officials in a range of illegal activities, which Chen discovered.. From his exile among the Xiongnu, Han Xin dispatched Wang Huang (t s W√°ng Hu√°ng) and Manqiu Chen ( M√†nqi≈´ Ch√©n) to convince Chen that he now had no choice but to rebel or be executed. In May 197, the death of the emperor's father brought Chen a summons to return to Chang'an to pay his respects, which he did not honor. At some time before the end of the year, Chen himself joined Wang Huang and other rebels against the Han, declaring himself the independent \\"king of Dai\\" at Julu (within present-day Pingxiang County, Xingtai, Hebei). Chen Xi's descent into treason prompted Sima Qian to exclaim in an aside from his historical narrative, \\"Alas, how tragic!\\" The next month, the emperor personally led an army against Chen from the southwest, while Lu Wan, the king of Yan and the emperor's childhood friend, led his army against Chen from the northeast.. Liu Bang was satisfied when he reached Zhao's natural and traditional stronghold at Handan, which was well protected against armies from the south by the course of the Zhang River; as Chen's forces had not rushed to secure and fortify it ahead of the invasion, neither he nor his advisors could be expected to do well in the coming campaign. Chen's men had occupied four- fifths of the 25 cities of Changshan, but the emperor declined Zhou Chang's suggestion that he punish the towns' governors for failure to withstand the northern army under Chen's command; instead, he accepted that their garrisons had been insufficient to offer meaningful resistance. When the emperor discovered that some of Chen's supporters were former merchants, he encamped at Handan and was able to persuade many to surrender or change sides by offering large bribes.. Chen sent Wang Huang to Modu, the chanyu of the Xiongnu to his north, to seek help from the nomads. For his part, the king of Yan sent Zhang Sheng (t s ZhƒÅng Sh√®ng) to convince the Xiongnu that Chen's rebellion stood no chance of success and that they should refrain from involving themselves. En route, however, Zhang met Zang Yan ( ZƒÅng Y«én) whose father Zang Tu had been the previous king of Yan before his execution by the Han emperor. Zang was able to convince him that the emperor would only permit independent states like Yan for as long as they were useful for suppressing others' rebellions; once the country was at peace, the imperial clan would begin dismantling them and executing their royal houses for treason, whether deserved or not. Zhang took this to heart and negotiated with the Xiongnu to assist Chen. Upon hearing this, Lu Wan initially planned to execute Zhang and his entire family for treason; Zhang, however, was able to return and explain himself, convincing his king that supporting Chen was in his family's own interest. Lu then returned Zhang as his ambassador to the Xiongnu court and sent Fan Qi (t s F√†n Q√≠) as an ambassador to Chen's court, pledging Yan's support for his cause. When he discovered how few soldiers he was receiving from Yan and his other vassals, the emperor angrily took four men at random from those milling around Handan and barked, \\"You fools, do you think you can lead an army for me?\\" When they knelt awkwardly and silently, he named them generals and provided each one with the tax revenue from a thousand households. When his other commanders protested at the unfairness of this action to men who had served him loyally for years without any such reward, he complained again of the fickleness of his vassals‚Äîall of whom had been his comrades in the wars against Qin or Chu‚Äîand admonished them that he would need to depend on the local people of the north to defeat Chen's insurrection. In January 196, a commoner came before Empress L√º at the Han capital Chang'an to plead for the life of his brother, a servant of Han Xin, a general and former king of Qi and Chu who had remained behind during the call to arms because of a grave illness. The servant had offended his master in some way that caused Han to imprison him and threaten him with execution. The brother then told the empress that Han Xin's illness was entirely feigned and that he was secretly in league with Chen Xi's rebellion, having plotted with him the year before while they were both in the capital together. Han was waiting for some message from Chen, whereupon he would forge an imperial pardon for everyone held in the prisons of Chang'an; in the ensuing chaos, he supposedly planned to attack the empress and the crown prince, seizing control of the city. The empress consulted the imperial chancellor Xiao He, who feigned a message of his own that the emperor had defeated and killed Chen Xi, ending the rebellion. Such good news required that nobles in the capital, no matter how ill, should visit the palace to offer congratulations; when Xiao He persuaded Han Xin to do so, he was arrested and executed, along with his family. In the field, the year began with Chen Xi's general Wang Huang and his thousand cavalry at Quni (present-day Shunping County, Hebei);. Hou Chang ( H√≥u Ch«éng) raiding the countryside with a force of around ten thousand men; and Zhang Chun (t s ZhƒÅng Ch≈´n) crossing the Yellow River with a similar force in order to attack Liaocheng.. From Handan, the emperor dispatched forces under his general Guo Meng ( Gu≈ç M√©ng) and the army of the princely state of Qi under its chancellor Cao Shen. Together, they defeated and executed Zhang at Liaocheng and Wang below Quni; Guan Ying was responsible for capturing and executing Hou in the same engagement. The emperor's cousin Liu Ze (t s Li√∫ Z√©) also participated in these battles, for which he was created Marquis of Yingling. The emperor led a siege of Dingyuan (now Zhengding, Hebei). Its governor Zhao Li held out more than a month, with some of his defenders lampooning the emperor from the battlements; upon the town's surrender, Liu Bang‚Äîstill incensed‚Äîoffered amnesty for all the rebels provided that they bring him the comics in their midst for execution. Following this victory, he named his son Liu Heng (later posthumously known as the \\"Wen\\" or \\"Literary Emperor\\") as the legitimate King or Prince of Dai. His eastern forces fully defeated, Chen Xi seems to have fled west into what is now northern Shanxi, where he was joined by Zhao Li and by Han Xin, the former king of Han. The emperor was said to have defeated their combined forces at Loufan near present-day Ningwu. Zhou Bo then led a separate force past Taiyuan to Mayi (present-day Shuozhou) at the edge of the steppe. When it did not submit to his authority as an agent of the Han Empire, he assaulted and sacked the town. At one of these battles or sometime before the end of the year, Han Xin was finally killed. In 195, the emperor led his army against Ying Bu while sending Fan Kuai to attack Chen Xi. One captive taken by Fan Kuai told him of Fan Qi's presence at Chen's court; other Xiongnu captives reported Zhang's continued residence with Modu. The emperor then directed Fan Kuai to lead his army against Yan, and Lu fled in exile to the Xiongnu, dying in 194. NotesReferences=CitationsBibliography= * . * . * . * . * . * .

The Governor had planned to destroy the market. When the vendors learned about his plan, they appealed for an injunction. He counteracted their action with some political influence. The market by that point was guarded day and night by armed men in what looked like a siege of war. At night, the men laid down their arms a few hours only before Governor Shepherd arrived with two or 300 men at midnight with torches. By morning, the market was completely torn down.

Built on a site previously called \\"Savage Square\\". The land was purchased at the time for the enormous price of $100,000 and the building was built at a cost of $150,000. It was designed by architect James H. McGill.Old Convention Hall Once Housed Big Events - March 3, 1946 The Washington Post - page M6 The building was long, wide, high on the side and high in the middle. Due to the marshy land, the foundations were made of stone sunken to a depth of . The walls were made of red bricks and the entire roof made of wrought iron weighing 209 tons. Many of the vendors from old Northern Liberty Market moved to the new market which opened in January 1875Merchants Plan To Open After $800,000 Fire - March 2, 1946 - The Washington Post - page 1 and managed by the Northern Liberty Company organized by George W. King. In 1885, a case involving the Northern Liberty Company made it to the Supreme Court of the United States as Northern Liberty Market Co. v. Kelly. The case involved a conflict between the company managing the market and a vendor who had leased a stall for a period of 99 years, renewable forever while the company's existence was limited to only twenty years. =Convention Hall= Washington Auto Show, Convention Hall, 1924 Convention Hall's lobby above the Northern Liberty Market Convention Hall: bowling alleys above the Northern Liberty Market As early as 1887, discussions were taking place of building a large hall above the market.Mr. Holmes's Proposition - October 19, 1887 - The Washington Post - page 2. The Hall was started in 1891. On May 22, 1893, the Convention Hall, also known as the Northern Liberty Auditorium was officially dedicated under the auspices of the Washington Lodge, No. 15, BPO Elks. An audience of 5,000 people watched The War in song by Silas Gamaliel Pratt, a military and musical allegory of the Civil War sung by a chorus of 500 voices.Dedicated by the Elks: Convention Hall Formally Opened with Eloquence - May 23, 1893 - The Washington Post - page 4 The Convention Hall was used extensively for various activities including a movie theater for silent movies, religious conventions, a roller skate rink, food shows, the Washington Auto Show and dog shows organized by the Washington Kennel Club.

The event was a major celebration in the city and gathered some of the most prominent individuals in the city. The building was one of the biggest venues at the time, allowing for large gatherings. Columbus Statue Unveiling, Program of Events - The Evening Star - June 7, 1912 At some point in the 1920s or 1930s, the Hall became a bowling alley before its destruction in 1946.A piece of city's convention center history: The old convention hall by Martha M. Hamilton - August 4, 1977 - The Washington Post - page DC1 In 1931, the market was renamed Center Market after the original Center Market building between Constitution Avenue and Pennsylvania Avenue was torn down to make way for the National Archives Building. The two markets were direct competitors though Northern Liberty Market was less than half the size of the old Center Market. Many of the vendors from Constitution Avenue also moved to this smaller market. =The Fire= On March 1, 1946, a fire destroyed the top floor of the structure where Convention Hall was located. According to reports at the time, five alarms were triggered. The first one was started by the police offices at the Second Precinct at 1:51 am and followed by four others. Large flames engulfed the metal structure and at 2:09 am, the roof made of 209 tons of wrought iron collapsed. It was fought with over 60 pieces of apparatus. It was finally subdued at 3:30 am thanks to large amounts of water which continued until dawn. According to the Fire Marshall, Ray Roberts, the high vaulted roof and the finishes used in the bowling alley lead to a rapid spread of the fire. While the fire did not spread to the market underneath thanks to the reinforced cement ceiling, there was severe damage to products due to the water used. A total of 70 butcher, grocery and flower stalls were damaged. The one owned by Charles Carrington (a smoked meat dealer) was completely crushed by an iron girder which fell in an opening in the concrete ceiling. The next morning, K. F. Knudsen, general manager and superintendent of the Washington Convention Hall Company announced that they hoped to convert the building to a one-story building. He estimated the damages to $800,000 ($500,000 for the building and $300,000 for other damages). For the safety of the public, a 20-foot section of the wall on 5th Street NW was pulled down on March 2 by order of the Chief Building Inspector, J. J. Kimball. Merchants hoped to re- open the market within two weeks of the fire. Prior to re-opening, the Health Department inspectors were to inspect the meats to determine if they were fit for consumption. The power had been cut with the fire and so the refrigeration system was not functioning for several days. =Reopening= The market was reopened, but with a flat roof. Leo and Norman Bernstein bought the property after the fire from the Washington Hall Company for $500,000. It reopened as only a market. It finally closed in 1963 due to the pressure of supermarkets with only 110 stalls occupied by that time. A new Convention Center was planned in the area and the property attracted investors. In 1964, the National Historical Wax Museum moved to the site leaving its former home of Foggy Bottom because of the Kennedy Center. It did not last long, with the Museum moving to Southwest Washington in 1975. The empty building was finally demolished in 1985. Present day The CityVista condominiums are now on the site with a Safeway supermarket and several other businesses on the ground floor. It is included in the D.C. Inventory of Historic Sites.

Phoebe Blyth (5 April 1816 to 12 February 1898) was a Scottish philanthropist, educationist and a leading campaigner for opening up opportunities for women in professional employment.  Early life and education  Phoebe Blyth was born in the Newington area of Edinburgh in 1816. Her father was Robert Brittain Blyth, a metal merchant, and her mother was Barbara Cooper. The family were active members of the Church of Scotland and Blyth's youngest brother was the Reverend Robert Blyth; a committed advocate for Scottish Sabbath schools. Another brother was the civil engineer Benjamin Blyth. Blyth was educated at Mr Andrews's school, thought to be one of the best private schools for girls in Edinburgh at the time. There she learned geography, elocution, French, drawing, music, and dancing while her grandmother also taught her the art of housekeeping and nursing.  Campaign for the employment of women  In 1859, the Society for Promoting the Employment of Women was founded in London by Jessie Boucherett, Barbara Bodichon and Adelaide Anne Proctor to promote the training and employment of women. Blyth looked to create a counterpart organisation in Scotland and was one of the founding members of the Edinburgh Society for Promoting the Employment of Women in 1860. This society created a register where potential employers and employees were paid a fee. This laid the groundwork for providing women with remunerative employment. From 1860 to 1863, the registry list included: * teachers in every department of schools, families, or private instruction * companions * female missionaries * Bible women * sick nurses * seamstresses * shop assistants * domestic servants. Both Blyth and her brother, Robert, were also members of the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science which had been newly formed in 1857. It pursued issues in public health, industrial relations, penal reform, and female education. When the association held its conference in Edinburgh in 1863, Blyth presented a paper strongly advocating that girls should be educated for employment and receive practical training in household management.  The Ladies' Edinburgh Magazine  Blyth also wrote for The Ladies' Edinburgh Magazine, previously known as 'The Attempt', and published by the same group of women who had formed the Ladies' Edinburgh Debating Society in 1865. Blyth wrote the first of a series of eight articles published in the magazine in 1875 on 'the industries and employments open to educated women': > \\"In former generations, when the proper sphere of woman was discussed, the > question was generally decided by the consideration of any course of action > being 'womanly' or 'unwomanly'. There was and is no fixed standard by which > this term can be applied, but this did not render it the less decisive; and > under the shelter of it, strange inconsistencies were tolerated. It was > 'womanly' to dance or sing before assembled thousands, but it was > 'unwomanly' to speak to a small number, even if in behalf of the oppressed > or wronged; it was 'womanly' to write weak of sentimental novels, but > 'unwomanly' to approach grave and important subjects; it was 'womanly' to > appear in the hunting-field and to be present at the death of a fox, but > 'unwomanly' to come to the help of the sick and wounded; it was 'womanly' to > use the needle, but not the graver's style; it was 'womanly' to starve for > want of food, but 'unwomanly' or at least unlady-like, to work for self- > support.\\" - Woman's Work, an Introduction in the Ladies' Edinburgh Magazine > (1875).  The first Scottish women elected to public office  By 1872, Blyth and her fellow social reformer Flora Stevenson had forged a prominent role in Edinburgh public life. Both were instrumental in the local administration and implementation of the Education (Scotland) Act when it passed in 1872. Under this act, approximately thousand regional school boards were created at a stroke; the first public bodies in Scotland to be opened to women. As a result, the first Scottish women to be elected to public office were Jane Arthur, elected in Glasgow in 1872, and then Phoebe Blyth and Flora Stevenson in Edinburgh in 1873. Blyth and Stevenson were also active in the movement for the opening of the medical profession and university education to women. Blyth was not, however, a campaigner in the movement for women's suffrage though she did support it. Blyth served on the school board for eight years, retiring in 1881. During her time on the board, she promoted the educational value of teaching of cookery and household management for schoolgirls. Blyth was also convenor of the committee of domestic economy and convenor of the ladies' African committee of the Church of Scotland. Throughout her life, Blyth was also a committed philanthropist and regularly engaged in missionary activities.  Death  Blyth passed away at her home, 27 Mansion House Road, in Edinburgh on 12 February 1898. She was buried at Grange Cemetery three days later. Her will left a trust of three hundred pounds a year to the support of ‚Äúsuch indigent and infirm gentlewomen‚Äù, the recipients to be decided upon by female members of her extensive family. A portion of her estate was to be donated to hospitals, missions, asylums and sick societies in Edinburgh.

Prior to 2017, it was part of Google X, before being spun out into an independent company. Dandelion targets providing geothermal heating and cooling (HVAC) on a competitive basis against, to start, existing oil furnaces. While geothermal HVAC has many advantages, penetration has been constrained over the years due to high-upfront capital costs. Dandelion targets eliminating that investment challenge both by lowering system costs and by leveraging leasing finance models that helped rooftop solar deal with the same challenge. There are three core components to Dandelion's approach: * As to lowering costs, the Google X (and then Dandelion) team developed a new drilling approach that no longer required significant industrial equipment to install the piping. * Dandelion has secured the financing so that it can offer potential buyers a \\"zero dollars upfront\\" option and a flat cost structure into the future at lower cost than their existing heating bills. * Dandelion is targeting a specific market of very high-cost heating with straightforward retrofit: oil furnaces with forced air systems. The combination of these three enable homeowners to secure geothermal's benefits (lower pollution; quieter; safer; lower maintenance costs) without having to deal with a large upfront capital cost. The system consists of a heat pump which pipes energy either to or from a house. Dandelion made headlines in February 2019 when it raised 16 million in its series A fundraising round. As a form of renewable technology with enormous potential, Dandelion has been called \\"the next solar\\". As New York state and the U.S. transition toward a zero emissions future, technologies like Dandelion's have a critical role to play. Dandelion replaces traditional heating systems, and in doing so eliminates the biggest source of carbon emissions in cold climates‚Äîthe emissions burned for heating. According to the EPA, natural gas and petroleum used for cooking and heating make up 89% of the emissions in the residential and commercial sectors. In New York state, buildings account for a lion's share of overall emissions, at 59% of the total emissions in the state. Dandelion offers a reduction in emissions equivalent to taking two cars off the road each year it operates. Dandelion's CEO, Kathy Hannun was named one of Fast Company's most creative people in 2018. A leader in the Green Tech industry, Hannun made headlines when she finished Dandelion's first round of fundraising the day before giving birth to her first child. In June 2018, Dandelion began installation of the first sub-$20,000 geothermal heat pump, Dandelion Air. The product was designed in- house by the company, which is installed in the backyard of a residential property and is currently financed over a 20-year term. In September of 2020 Dandelion announced its expansion to Connecticut.

The Antonov An-12B was flying between Novosibirsk and Krasnoyarsk in Russia with a crew of six when it crashed. It was carrying industrial parts from Moscow to Khabarovsk with several intermediate stops in between, however it caught fire shortly after takeoff, resulting in a fatal accident. At the time Flight 5003 was being operated by Polar Aviation Management under Aeroflot. Aircraft and crew CCCP-04343, an Antonov An-12B, entered operational service with Aeroflot in 1959. It was flying under Aeroflot's Directorate of Polar Aviation with a six-member crew.Aeroflot, The Soviet Airline - At Home and Abroad by Harriett E.Porch http://scholar.smu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2443&context;=jalc The pilots were Robert Fritsevich Bernovsky and Viktor Andrekov, with Vladimir Izmailov Prokopevich serving as the flight's radio operator. CCCP-04343 had nearly 4400 hours on its airframe and was fitted with four Ivchenko AI-20 turboprop engines. Synopsis Flight 5003 took off from Moscow-Sheremetyevo International Airport on 13 January 1967 and proceeded eastwards with the final destination of Khabarovsk. It made its first stop in Sverdlovsk (SVX) and then flew on to Novosibirsk (OVB). With a cargo of prefabricated industrial material (bearings, parts, belts, tools, plastics, enamels, etc.), Flight 5003 took off from Novosibirsk runway 07 at 06:33 KRAT on 14 January 1967, and began to make its way to Irkutsk (IKT) for the third stop of the journey. Weather conditions at the time were poor with just four kilometers of visibility accompanied by snow, haze, and low cloud cover. Air traffic controllers promptly lost communications with Flight 5003. The aircraft had reached an altitude of just two hundred meters and was in the air for less than two minutes when an in-flight fire forced the pilots to attempt an emergency landing on a snow-covered field. Witnesses on the ground recalled seeing the aircraft in flames and trailing smoke. In a left bank, the aircraft's left wing struck the ground first, resulting in an explosion that completely destroyed the plane and killed all six members of the crew. The wreckage was found seven kilometers away from the airfield.  Cause  Investigators determined the cause of the crash to be the in-flight fire coupled with the harsh conditions which made an emergency landing difficult. The bodies of Flight 5003's crew were severely burned and the wreckage was so heavily damaged that determining the exact cause of the fire was not possible, though investigators believe it was the result of flammable cargo material, not the aircraft's fuel system. In addition, investigators found the pilots failed to switch on the aircraft's firefighting system.

The Federation was founded in New York City in 1990 by a small group of Latino leaders, establishing initiatives to advocate for the interests of the Hispanic community and has expanded to establish programs, and policies in 16 states. The organization's objective is to empower and advance the Hispanic community primarily through service pillars, membership services, advocacy, and community programs. The Federation has formed relationships with a network of 100 Latino grassroots nonprofits, as well as collaborating with organizations, government officials, and private sector partners to enact systemic change related to a variety of socioeconomic issues for Hispanic communities. The Federation has gained national recognition for its work in areas of education, health, immigration, economic empowerment, civic engagement, environment, and organizational development to strengthening Latino institutions to ultimately increase the quality of life within Hispanic communities. History In 1990, a small group of Latinos in New York City founded Hispanic Federation to support Hispanic communities and strengthen Latino institutions throughout the United States of America. Since its foundation, Hispanic Federation has collaborated with many organizations focusing on a variety of socioeconomic issues. The organization began by establishing a base with a weekly public affairs show on Spanish-language radio stations and implementing a public education campaign. In 1993, as a response to a lack of resources and/or support for administrative needs of Latino non-profit organizations, Hispanic Federation established the Latino CORE (Community Organization Resource Expansion) initiative, providing grants to organizations in support of infrastructural development, and has awarded over 1,000 grants and in partnership with grant-making initiatives has granted over $40 million to Hispanic Federation member agencies. Hispanic Federation carried out the first Latino Civic Participation Campaign in 1996 to increase political involvement, and has since registered more than 350,000 new voters. By 1999, Hispanic Federation created and launched several long-term programs that continue to be implemented through their major initiatives. Hispanic Federation created the Hispanic Leadership Institute, a unique college- affiliated management program designed for Latino nonprofit organization managers, currently with over 200 Latino graduates. A health insurance program has helped over 60,000 Latino families to obtain health care by providing access to free or low-cost health insurance. In the mid-2000s, Hispanic Federation began an expansion to continue to advance the interests and aspirations of Latinos on a national level; opening an office in Washington D.C. in 2005, and opening the Las Americas Conference Center in 2006, the first Latino nonprofit conference facility in the Northeast region. The expansion of Hispanic Federation allowed for the organization to implement programs pertaining to other issues Hispanic communities face. In 2008, a foreclosure prevention program was implemented to help Latinos affected by the nation's mortgage crisis, as well as launching an agency-wide effort to raise awareness of environmental justice issues. In 2013, a satellite office opened in Connecticut further expanding is geographical presence to strengthen its services to Latino communities across the state. Partnering with League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), Hispanic Federation implemented their first national immigration service initiative in 2014, working in ten states to assist with immigrant integration. A Central Florida office opened in 2015 to effectively support Hispanic communities in the Southeast USA. Hispanic Federation now works with network of 100 Latino grassroots nonprofits and collaborates with organizations, government officials, and private sector partners, and to establish and implement programs in 16 states. Structure Hispanic Federation has offices in New York, Washington, D.C., Connecticut and Florida, and uses a nonprofit network with approximately grassroots agencies. Hispanic Federation is managed by a board of directors, consisting of 18 members. Although Hispanic Federation operates through a network of organizations, the board of directors possesses a degree of independence from its members, allowing the organization to establish priorities. Frankie Miranda is the president of Hispanic Federation, and his role is to be the principal spokesperson, manage overall operations of the organization, as well as advocate for Hispanic grassroots organizations and pro-Latino legislation through the media, public officials, the private sector and the community. Hispanic Federation created the Policy Leadership Council, a group of community leaders and advocates form their grassroots nonprofit network, to establish policy priorities by identifying the crucial issues for Latino communities in the United States of America. The Policy Leadership Council partners with the overall grassroots nonprofit network, and uses agencies such as ASPIRA, El Puente, and LatinoJustice PRLDEF, to form coalitions to advance the priorities of the Council. Funding Hispanic Federation receives funding from corporations, foundations, and governments, as well as private donors. Hispanic Federation's total grants and contributions from government sources are within 25% to 49%, therefore the majority of funding relies on non- governmental sources. Approximately 90% of funds go directly to community services, receiving high ratings for transparency, accuracy, and responsibility for charitable giving by Better Business Bureau Accredited Charity, and GuideStar Exchange. Charity Navigator gave Hispanic Federation an overall score of 94.69 out of 100 for its financial responsibility and accountability & transparency in a report released in February of this year. Strategy Hispanic Federation supports Hispanic communities at the local, state, and national level primarily through three essential service pillars: membership services, advocacy and community programs. Hispanic Federation uses membership services to strengthen grassroots nonprofits to support core operational needs, through management classes, leadership training, recruitment, and workshops and seminars to provide Latinos with opportunities to develop essential skills. Advocacy services advance the interests and aspirations of Latinos through policy research, public education, advocacy, and voter mobilization. Advocacy services use reports and testimonials to highlight to a variety of inequalities and challenges for Latinos across the United States of America. Community assistance programs are designed to provide social services in a variety of socioeconomic areas to support individuals, families, and communities. Programs= Education = One of the main focuses of Hispanic Federation since its creation is investments in education for Hispanic communities. Hispanic Federation hosts an annual Hispanic Education Summit, the Northeastern region's largest community-wide gathering on Latino education, to advocate for policymakers to advance policies for improving Latino educational achievement, as well as creating strategies and recommendations for educational policymaking at the local, state and federal levels. Hispanic Federation supports all levels of education by conducting research and advocating for policies related to providing underserved students resources and opportunities for academic success. Through a variety of programs, Hispanic Federation launches campaigns for specific areas concerning education of Hispanics. Pathways to Academic Excellence is an initiative to enable parents to support their children's education, divided into two main components: Pathways Early Childhood and Pathways College Prep. Pathways Early Childhood focuses on teaching parents and/or guardians techniques and skills to facilitate academic success for their children in areas such as literacy skills through language-building activities, providing resources, behavioural tracking, and collaborating with the school system to overcome social and academic challenge. Pathways College Prep is an initiative enabling parents and/or guardians to prepare their children for postsecondary education, supporting them through the application process, teaching them the advantages of education, importance of advanced placement classes, extracurricular activities, junior year, and college entrance exams, as well as developing relations with school counselors and providing resources for financial aid and scholarships. In 2016, Hispanic Federation received a grant of $350 000 from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation towards their college readiness programs College Readiness Achievement and Retention (CREAR) Futuros is another program pertaining to post-secondary, focusing on systemic barriers for Hispanic students that have resulted in Hispanics having the lowest college graduation levels of any major racial group in the United States of America. CREAR Futuros addresses this issue by developing relations with public sector partners, such as The City University of New York (CUNY), private foundations, and corporations to implement student retention and achievement models, increasing Hispanic postsecondary graduation rates. In partnership with CUNY, CREAR Futuros focuses on providing Hispanic students with trained peer-mentors, academic tutoring, leadership training, and internships. Hispanic Federation plans on expanding this education program creating the CREAR 2.0 program to provide technology to facilitate learning, and National CREAR Futuros Initiative (NCFI) to expand the program to Connecticut, New Jersey and Florida. Hispanic Federation's Latino CREAR Coalition is a program specific to New York City that advocates for improvements for postsecondary preparedness in public schools, working with community leaders, college leaders at New York State Hispanic Serving Institutions, New York City Department of Education (DOE), New York State Education Department (SED) leaders, elected officials, and other actors. These programs are threatened as New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo proposed a $500 million cut to the CUNY system. Because the CUNY system serves three quarters of all Latino undergraduates in New York City, Hispanic Federation is advocating for a restoration of funding to ensure Latino students have access to an affordable and high quality postsecondary education. = Health = Hispanic Federation is concerned with the management of health disparities through access to affordable healthcare, diminishing socio-economic obstacles that prevent Latinos to access healthcare. The promotion of healthcare for Latinos is accomplished through three central goals: increasing access to healthcare, supporting healthy lifestyles, and advocating for sexual reproductive health rights. Healthcare Enrolment is a program to increase access to healthcare, focusing on the issue access to quality, affordable medical care. This program was established to assist families in registering in Medicaid and Child Health Plus, expanded under the Affordable Care Act, and currently assists New York families and small businesses with the enrolment process of the Official Health Plan Marketplace. Hispanic Federation has implemented a health program specific to the issue of HIV/AIDS in Latinos. In 1996, the Latinos Unidos Contra El SIDA (LUCES) HIV/AIDS Coalition was created in response to the AIDS epidemic in the United States of America disproportionately affecting Latinos. LUCES established initiatives, such as the Latino HIV Testing Month to provide a culturally-competent HIV/AIDS education and advocacy. The organization partnered with the Latino Commission on AIDS to create the National Latino AIDS Awareness Day and is currently recognized in over 300 cities across the U.S.A. Hispanic Federation has implemented a variety of programs related to supporting healthy lifestyles. Get Up! Get Moving! (GUGM) Health Fair is hosted in New York and Florida to promote and encourage diverse physical activities, and provides health screenings for participants. Zumbando en el Barrio is another physical fitness program, promoting Zumba, with fitness, entertainment, and culture at the core of the initiative. SER Saludable is a program that partners with other nonprofit organizations implement an intergenerational initiative combining physical education clinics and nutrition education to promote healthy lifestyles, and started the SER Saludable Fitness Challenge to reinforce healthy habits. The Latino Health Awareness Initiative addresses the issue of Latinos being disproportionately affected by a variety of health issues, focusing on education for diseases such as diabetes. Hispanic Federation worked with partners to launch Latino Diabetes Awareness Day and observe diabetes in the Latino community from a systematic perspective. Hispanic Federation implemented an Anti-Asthma/Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Initiative, launching a Hispanic Lung Health Education Campaign to raise awareness, and partner with 12 member agencies to provide asthma resource centers for Hispanics. Hispanic Federation addresses the lack of access to reproductive healthcare and knowledge sexual and reproductive rights that can result in reproductive cancers, unplanned pregnancies, sexual violence and sexually transmitted diseases. Hispanic Federation partners with I Am/Yo Soy campaign to raise awareness of sexual health expanding on key principles: rights to decisions about birth control, abortion and parenting, increasing access to health care, highlight attempts to restrict sexuality education or reproductive health options, and developing communication skill for informing youth about sexual education. = Immigration = Hispanic Federation advocates for the protection and advancements of the rights of immigrants. Originally, the organization focused on advocacy at the local level, collaborating with member agencies to develop citizen campaigns and English as a Second Language (ESL). Immigration initiatives have expanded to provide immigrant integration services and advocate for immigration reforms at the national level. Hispanic Federation focuses supporting Hispanic immigrants with the challenges of immigrating into the United States of America through programs related to direct immigration services and Immigration advocacy. A challenge for many Hispanic immigrants is learning English, therefore many of the organization's programs focus on providing these immigrants with educational opportunities. The Adult Basic Literacy and Education is an initiative specific to adult education in response to limited opportunities for immigrants to receive adult education, launching various programs such as Adult Basic Education (ABE), English of Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) and GED programs. Hispanic Federation partners with League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) to implement the Hispanic Immigrant Integration Project (HIIP), provided in California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas. This program facilitates integration of Latino immigrants into their community through ESL classes, assistance with citizenship applications, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, and assistance with family-based petitions Hispanic Federation, along with Northern Manhattan Coalition for Immigrant Rights, Dominican Women's Development Center, and Community Association of Progressive Dominicans, opened Neighborhood Based Opportunity Center in New York in commitment to the Office for New Americans (ONA) initiative, providing participants with citizenship assistance and consultations, ESL classes, business seminars, and access to job opportunities. Hispanic Federation provides scholarships for immigrants who qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, covering the $500 cost of the program's application. For Immigration Advocacy, Hispanic Federation divided its efforts into National immigration reforms and state and local immigration reforms. Advocating for national reforms, Hispanic Federation collaborates with many organizations, such as LULAC, Labor Council for Latin American Advancement (LCLAA), and National Hispanic Leadership Agenda (NHLA) to advocate for immigration reforms through meeting with Congressional members and Administration officials, producing policy position letters, and present recommendations on immigrant executive action to the Federal government. Hispanic Federation advocates for state and local immigration reforms for issues specific to the region. In Florida, Hispanic Federation collaborates with We Are Florida coalition to eliminate with waiting period for immigrants to receive state health insurance. In New York City, Hispanic Federation collaborates with Bill De Blasio's administration to provide undocumented immigrants with municipal identification cards. Hispanic Federation is one of over 150 member organizations of the New York Immigration Coalition (NYIC), creating a network of immigrant-serving organizations focusing on immigration issues related human and civil rights in New York City. The primary role of Hispanic Federation within the coalition is to function as a specialized and professionalized umbrella organization in areas of policy analysis and advocacy on immigration-related issues, civic participation, voter education, community education, and leadership development. = Economic Empowerment = Hispanic Federation commits to economic empowerment of Latinos through personal finances and hunger relief campaigns. Hispanic Federation provides a Personal Finance Workshop series, offering interactive financial literacy workshops focused on budgeting, saving, and investing. This program supports Latino economic prosperity by teaching participants skills to proper financial decisions and money management. Hispanic Federation launched Lucha Contra El Hambre as part of their hunger relief campaign, a program focused on food support families in need throughout New York and Central Florida, as well as communities in Georgia, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. Ford Motor Company partners with Hispanic Federation to support the Lucha Contra El Hambre campaign in New York City by providing an extensive food drive throughout underserved neighborhoods during the holiday season.Ford and Hispanic Federation Link for 5th Year of the New York Hunger Relief Campaign.

The NYIC invites Hispanic Federation fieldworkers to organizational events to register new voters as to increase immigrants‚Äô access to political and civic institutions. = Environment = Hispanic Federation implements environmental equity initiatives as a social justice issue for Latino communities. Hispanic Federation defends Land and Water Conservation Fund and other legislations that protects the environment by educating lawmakers on the impact of environmental policies on Latino communities. Through the Latino Conservation Alliance and Healthy Parks, Hispanic Federation addresses clean water, clean air, access to green spaces, and other environmental issues. In 2014, the Latino Conservation Alliance (LCA) was formed to create the first Latino environmental coalition, consisting of Hispanic Federation, Green Latinos, Hispanic Access Foundation, Hispanics Enjoying Camping, Hunting, and the Outdoors (HECHO), La Madre Tierra, and Latino Outdoors. LCA promotes conservation priorities, including sustainable energy practices and the protection of public lands and national monuments, to protect natural resources of the United States of America. The Healthy Latinos Environmental Policy Report focuses on the impact of diabetes and obesity in Latino communities. Hispanic Federation addresses the lack of access to local parks and recreational areas for Latino communities, resulting in a health disparities across the country. The report advocates for funding towards the Land and Water Conservation Fund and preserving the Antiquities Act. = Organizational Development = Hispanic Federation collaborates with a network of New York City Latino nonprofit organizations, strengthening relations to increase depth and geographic reach of their programs. Hispanic Federation focuses on capacity building through a variety of initiatives and programs. The organization implements institution building initiatives, investing community organizations by providing grants, advocacy, and organizational development assistance. The Latino CORE initiative, Hispanic Federation's main grant-making program, provides financial support for Latino non-profit organizations towards underfunded or unfunded projects. Hispanic Federation receives funding from the Communities of Color Nonprofit Stabilization Fund, to provide funding to minority communities traditionally excluded from grant- making policies. In 2015, Hispanic Federation established the Entre Familia Nonprofit Learning Series, an initiative to support member agencies with capacity-building trainings and professional development opportunities. Hispanic Leadership Institute (HLI), in partnership with School of Public Affairs at Baruch College and the University of Connecticut, teaches Latinos leadership through management skills. In 2016, Hispanic Federation created the Latina Leadership Circle (LLC), an initiative providing leadership capacities for Latina member agency nonprofit executives. Criticisms Hispanic Federation is criticized for their relations with corporate leaders influencing their organization's activities. In 2013, the lawsuit against the New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's policy to restrict sales of sugar- sweetened beverages was supported by multiple minority organizations. Hispanic Federation was criticized for lobbying for the interests of their investors by supporting the lawsuit against the restriction of sugar-sweetened beverages because of the organization's financial relations with Coca-Cola. Many organizations were criticized for promoting healthy lifestyles while supporting an industry contributing to obesity, however they defend their position from an economic position, claiming that an exemption to large chain stores would disadvantage minority-owned small business owners. Following the lawsuit, Coca-Cola became the co-chair of the Hispanic Federation Gala and awarded their Corporate Leadership Award. Hispanic Federation's President at the time, Lillian Lopez-Rodriguez, accepted the position as Coke's Hispanic Affairs Director shorty after the lawsuit. In July 2014, Hispanic Federation was criticized after receiving $1.3 million from New York City, a significant increase from the previous year, having only received $307,000 in 2013. Criticisms claim City Council members have favoured certain nonprofit organizations in grant-making, and Hispanic Federation's discretionary funding is a pressing issue for the municipal government. The issue was not the amount received, but Hispanic Federation's relations with politically-connected lobbying firm and their influence on the City Council. The discretionary grant was seen as a conflict of interest because of the ties with lobbyist Luis Miranda Jr.'s MirRam Group. City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito is a MirRam client, allowing for her decision in grant-making to be influenced by lobbyists. Hispanic Federation has connections with the MirRam and is seen as a corrupt relationship. Hispanic Federation's Board of Directors is largely made up of from company managers with at least two being MirRam clients, and the corporate-dominated board allows for the advancement of interests of the lobbyist group to precede those of Latino communities.

It follows the national and international success of their debut album Zebra Crossing (1994), and was produced by Grahame Beggs. As with their previous album, Renaissance blends classical music with African pop and folk music, while also exploring new textures, with styles on the album including marabi, kwela and worldbeat. Quartet member Reuben Khemse described the album's themes as reawakening, revival and the dawn of new eras. The album received commercial success, reaching number 8 in New Zealand. Put together, Zebra Crossing and Renaissance have sold a total of some 400,000 copies. The band toured internationally in promotion of the album in 1997, during which it was released by RCA Victor in the United States. Critical acclaim generally greeted the album with critics complimenting the quartet's unusual sound. At the 1997 South African Music Awards, Renaissance won the award for \\"Best Instrumental Performance,\\" while Graeme Beggs won the award for \\"Best Producer.\\" Background The members of the Soweto String Quartet, consisting of the three Khamese brothers, alongside their friend, Makhosini Mguni, formed in the early 1980s. Finding escape from their apartheid-imposed poverty, brothers Reuben and Sandile Khemese studied classical music in their native Soweto and later in England, and returning to their township, they formed the Soweto String Quartet with their brother Thami and friend Makhosini Mguni in the early 1980s. It was not until 1992 that the band became a full-time professional ensemble, and their 'big break' came when producer Grahame Beggs, who worked for BMG Records, saw the quartet perform on TV and during their nine-month residency at the Sun City resort, Beggs signed them to the BMG Africa label, who released their debut album Zebra Crossing in 1994. In their native South Africa, Zebra Crossing sold some 50,000 copies and went Platinum. The success of Zebra Crossing ensured international demand for the quartet's live performances, and also saw the band win \\"Best New Artist,\\" \\"Best Instrumental Performance\\" and \\"Best Pop Album,\\" a combination one critic called \\"truly rare,\\" at the FNB South African Music Awards. The album's release in the United Kingdom by BMG in April 1996 and later on that year in the United States by RCA Victor secured the band an international audience. In 1996, the quartet recorded the album's follow-up, Renaissance, again fusing European classical chamber music with bittersweet lyricism and \\"lithe rhythms of South Africa‚Äôs Township Jive.\\" Beggs returned as producer. Composition The album includes a cover of \\"Pata Pata\\" by Miriam Makeba. Renaissance mixes classical arrangements with African pop music. In the album's weaving elements of pop music into classical music, the quartet dabble in styles such as marabi, kwela, African folk music, as well as an array of indigenous African songs. The Beat felt the album provides an \\"original interpretation of South African song,\\" an opinion echoed by Jazz Times who felt the numerous South African folk songs on Renaissance are arranged as worldbeat fusions. Classic CD magazine felt that the album shows the quartet developing further in the direction of \\"crossover international pop.\\" While the classical and pop- crossover elements are a continuation of their approach from Zebra Crossing, producer Grahame Beggs helps the band introduce new textures to the album. Quartet member Reuben Khemse described the themes of the album as reawakening and the dawn of a new era. He said: While the album includes South African standards such as \\"Imbube\\" and Miriam Makeba's \\"Pata Pata,\\" it also includes an original composition, \\"Writing on the Wall\\". \\"Imbube\\" features interlocking violins which explore the track's \\"various nuances,\\" while \\"Songs My Mother Taught Me\\" is an atmospheric work written in 1880 by Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k. The quartet's rendition of Makeba's popular \\"Pata Pata\\" reflects what the quartet's violinist Makhosini described as their owing a \\"debt of gratitude to the pioneers of South African popular music.\\" They spoke of their appreciation towards Miriam Makeba, Letta Mbulu, Hugh Masekela, Caiphus Semenya and \\"others whose music had to be smuggled into South Africa while they lived in exile during the apartheid era.\\" South African musician Vusi Mahlasela performs guest vocals on \\"Weeping,\\" a protest song written by Dan Heymann, a young white soldier in the South African Army who was horrified with the apartheid system. The lyrics include the lines \\"I knew a man who lived in fear. It was huge, it was angry, it was drawing near. Behind his house, a secret place was the shadow of a demon he could never face.\\" The inclusion of a guest vocalist marks another departure for the quartet. The song was originally recorded by Heymann with the group Bright Blue in 1987, and was named the \\"All-time favorite South African Song\\" by the readers of the South African Rock Encyclopedia in 1999.THE \\"SA ROCK DIGEST/AMUZINE\\" END OF THE CENTURY BIG VOTE Release Renaissance was first released in October 1996 by BMG Africa. BMG also issued the album in the UK, whereas in the US it was released by RCA Victor in 1997. Building upon the far-reaching success of their previous album, Renaissance brought larger international audiences to the quartet. Following the release of the album, the quartet were invited to perform in Spain in April 1997, followed by a tour of France, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Australia and New Zealand. Reuben noted in 1997: \\"We'd like to do a national tour of South Africa late this year after fulfilling our commitments abroad.\\" To represent South Africa, the Soweto String Quartet played a \\"Commonwealth In Concert\\" show in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1997, and then followed it with a show in London to showcase material from Renaissance. Reception Renaissance was a relative commercial success. It reached number 8 on the Official New Zealand Music Chart, and put together, Zebra Crossing and Renaissance have sold a total of some 400,000 copies. Renaissance also received generally favourable reviews from critics. African magazine Drum noted how the album was \\"causing a stir\\" in the region's music scene. Among international reviews, AllMusic named Renaissance an \\"Album Pick\\" and rated it four stars out of five. Arthur Goldstuck of Billboard said that Renaissance enhances upon the successful \\"classical and pop-crossover elements\\" of Zebra Crossing, complimenting the addition of \\"new textures\\" achieved with help from Grahame Beggs. Pace magazine was favourable, noting how the quartet weave \\"elements of pop into staid classical music\\" and felt that the quartet have \\"internationalised local roots music and made it accessible to lovers of classical music.\\" The Beat wrote that Renaissance provides \\"a totally original interpretation of South African song.\\" He felt the mix of \\"classical arrangements with pop fusions\\" could sometimes be disconcerting, but nonetheless said \\"there is no doubt that SSQ achieves moments of clear beauty in its effort clear beauty in its effort to transcend the classical quartet structure.\\" John Murph of Jazz Times was generally unfavourable, finding the album to amount to \\"pre-fab piffle\\" suited for \\"jazzy\\" radio stations and \\"weather channel background music,\\" and criticised how the \\"[t]he collections of various South African folk songs are filtered through gooey global-beat fusion.\\" He did however praise \\"Weeping\\" for its vocals, which he felt were reminiscent of Peter Gabriel's worldbeat albums.

Early life and education Querubin was born in Dagupan, Pangasinan. He grew up in La Union and studied in Manila. He was a member of the leftist student group Samahang Demokratiko ng Kabataan (\\"Democratic Association of Youth\\") until he attended the Philippine Military Academy, graduating in 1979. He then opted to become an officer in the Philippine Marine Corps. Military career Querubin has been an active participant in various military operations during the ongoing CPP-NPA-NDF rebellion and the Moro conflict. He is credited with the neutralization of various rebel leaders of both the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People's Army and the Moro National Liberation Front, including CPP-NPA provincial chairman Jessie Rafael in 1981, four MNLF commanders in 1983, the NPA commander known as \\"Ka Ninong\\" and MNLF commander Racquel Carreon, both in 1988. He is also said to have been involved in the rescue of Hans Kunzli, a Swiss national kidnapped by a group led by a former member of the Moro National Liberation Front. =Participation in the 1987 coup attempt= On 28 August 1987, Reform the Armed Forces Movement rebels led by Gregorio Honasan attempted a coup against President Corazon Aquino. They attacked Malaca√±ang Palace, Camp Aguinaldo and Villamor Air Base. Querubin, along with Red Kapunan and Juancho Sabban, attempted to bring Philippine Military Academy cadets from Baguio to Manila to provide support for Honasan. =Participation in the 1989 coup attempt= In 1989, then- Captain Querubin was a co-founder of the Young Officers' Union (YOU). The YOU, along with another group known as the \\"Soldiers of the Filipino People\\" (SFP) and the Reform the Armed Forces Movement (RAM) participated in the most serious coup against Corazon Aquino's government. He almost died in clashes with troops loyal to the government. Some reports indicate that he suffered from a gunshot wound; Querubin himself stated that he was wounded by a rocket blast during clashes in Camp Aguinaldo. The mutiny eventually failed and Querubin and his comrades were detained. They were granted amnesty during the administration of Fidel Ramos, who succeeded Corazon Aquino as President. =Re-entry into military service= Querubin re-entered military service after being granted amnesty. In 1994, he was credited with the neutralization of Barahama Sali, which led to the eventual release from captivity of Catholic priest Fr. Cirilo Nacorda who had been kidnapped by the Abu Sayyaf in Basilan.

Fourteen junior military officers had been arrested two days before. In the wake of the proclamation, on 26 February 2006, Major General Renato Miranda, the Philippine Marine Corps Commandant, was relieved from his post. Colonel Querubin protested his removal and some Marines started a vigil at Fort Bonifacio. Querubin stated that they would wait there for the people to protect them. Meanwhile, other government security forces loyal to Arroyo locked down Fort Bonifacio, sealing in the protesting Marines. The standoff was resolved that evening. Querubin was detained at Camp Aguinaldo and recommended to undergo pretrial investigation and facing a mutiny charge. In 2010, President Benigno Aquino III issued Proclamation No. 50, granting amnesty to military personnel linked to the 2003 Oakwood mutiny, the 2006 Fort Bonifacio standoff and the 2007 Manila Peninsula siege. Post-military service Querubin worked as an internal security consultant for San Miguel Corporation after being granted amnesty. He resigned his commission from the Armed Forces of the Philippines when he ran for a Senate seat as a member of the Nacionalista Party during the 2010 elections. His candidacy was not successful, only garnering 6.5 million votes and landing him in 19th place in the senatorial race. He supported Grace Poe's candidacy during the 2016 Presidential election. Personal life Querubin has seven children. His first wife, Dr. Loreta Cercenia-Querubin, bore him two - Alfred Benjamin and Francesca Eufrosina. She died in 1994 at the age of 31, allegedly over stress stemming from a business deal with Janet Lim-Napoles, the alleged mastermind of the Priority Development Assistance Fund scam.

The vaccines themselves contain none of the original cells and - if any - very slight traces of human DNA fragments. Most vaccines currently available were developed using cell strains cultured from two fetuses aborted for other purposes in the 1960s. This has led some to oppose vaccination on religious or moral grounds. However, vaccine experts and manufacturers state that vaccines do not contain any of the original fetal tissue or cells, that the abortions occurred decades ago and replenishment with new tissue has not occurred. Also, producing a safe vaccine for many diseases requires the use of these cell strains. The Catholic Church, which opposes abortion, has stated that vaccination should not be refused on moral grounds in cases where the public health benefits of vaccination may outweigh the use of aborted fetal tissue to develop some vaccines, when an alternative vaccine created from cell lines that are not morally problematic are not available. Background Immortalised cell lines are an important research tool offering a stable medium for experiments. These are derived either from tumors, which have developed resistance to senescence, or, in a few cases, from stem cells taken from aborted fetuses. Fetal cell lines have been used in the manufacture of viruses since 1930s. One of the first medical applications of fetal tissues was their use in the production of the first polio vaccines. For example, in the 1950s, scientists at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden propagated a polio virus in fetal cells to make into a polio vaccine. The resulting vaccine was given to about 2,000 children. Many other vaccines, including those for chicken pox and rubella, are made using fetal tissue from two pregnancies terminated in the 1960s, for reasons unrelated to vaccine development. Descendants of the fibroblast cells from these fetuses have been growing in labs ever since, as the WI-38 and MRC-5 cell lines. They are still used to grow vaccine viruses today. As of March 2017, at least 300 million vaccines have been given that were made using the WI-38 line alone. Applications Vaccines that have been or are made using fetal tissue for the propagation of viruses include: * Adenovirus * Chicken pox * Ebola * Polio * Rabies * Rubella * Shingles Of these, the vaccines approved for use in the United States include some of those against rabies (Imovax), rubella, chicken pox, shingles, and adenovirus (as of January 2017). =Rubella example= One historical cell line used in rubella vaccines was obtained from a fetus aborted due to infection with rubella. Rubella during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage (spontaneous abortion), and if it does not, there is a risk of severe disability due to congenital rubella syndrome. By one estimate, rubella vaccination may prevent up to 5,000 miscarriages per year in the United States.  Alternatives  COS-1 cells are of monkey origin and there are xenogeneic differences between monkey and human proteins. Position of the Catholic Church The Catholic Church is opposed to abortion. Nevertheless, the Pontifical Academy for Life, concluded in 2005 that parents are free to allow their children to receive vaccines made from fetal tissue. This Academy also called for the development of new vaccines that can be made by other means. The National Catholic Bioethics Center states that \\"...one is morally free to use the vaccine regardless of its historical association with abortion. The reason is that the risk to public health, if one chooses not to vaccinate, outweighs the legitimate concern about the origins of the vaccine...\\".

Only one was built and was used by the Pozna≈Ñ flying club for five years. Design and development In 1929 Jozef Morisson (sometimes written Moryson) designed a significantly revised version of the Ostrovia I which he named the Ostrovia II. It was built with funding from LOPP and first flew on 24 September 1930. Like the Ostrovia I, the new design had a low cantilever wing built around two spars, but it employed a blend of four different airfoil sections and was tapered in plan. It was built in three parts, a centre-section which contained the two fuel tanks and two outer panels. Plywood covered the underside and leading edge, with fabric covering elsewhere. Compared with the Ostrovia I, the wing area was increased by 12%%. The outer panels could be folded back on rear-spar hinges along the fuselage for road transport; when folded the width was . The Ostrovia II was initially powered by a Armstrong-Siddeley Genet five-cylinder radial engine which was mounted on the nose uncowled. Sometime after September 1931 this was replaced by a Cirrus III four-cylinder upright inline with its enclosed air-cooled cylinders projecting well above the nose. Like the Ostrovia I, the Ostrovia II had a rectangular section fuselage based on four longerons and was ply covered. Its two open cockpits were in tandem and fitted with dual control. Originally the empennage was square tipped, with ply covered fin and rudder but with fabric-covered horizontal surfaces. Later these angular surfaces were revised to have rounded tips. The tailplane could be adjusted in flight. The fixed landing gear of the Ostrovia II was more aerodynamically refined than that of its predecessor. It was of the divided type, with mainwheels on two cranked axles hinged from the centerline of the fuselage underside with their ends attached via rubber chord shock absorbers to steel-tube V-struts from the lower longerons. Operational history After successful flight trials the Ostrovia II was used by the Pozna≈Ñ flying club for five years. It competed under Genet power in the Fourth National Lightplane Contest in September 1931, coming eleventh out of twenty-two. After the installation of the Cirrus engine it took part in several national meetings, though without distinction. Variants *Ostrovia II; Also known as the Moryson II, as described. *Moryson III; Powered by a Walter Vega it was completed in 1935 but was refused a permit to fly because of constructional and other problems. *Moryson IV; An unbuilt cabin version with a more powerful engine.

The Independent Party of Lanzarote (PIL) is a Spanish political party whose scope is the Canary Island of Lanzarote. It is a party of Canarian island and nationalist type that defends the right to self-determination of the islands. It currently has agreements to stand for election with the Canary Islands Nationalist Federation, the Canary Islands Nationalist Party and the Canary Islands Coalition. Created from the Agrupaci√≥n Independientes de Lanzarote (AIL), within the Agrupaciones Independientes de Canarias, in 1989 it was constituted as the Partido de Independientes de Lanzarote, later participating in the formation of the Coalici√≥n Canaria. After a series of discontents with the political line of the Canary Islands Coalition, the PIL dissociates itself from it. In the elections to the Parliament of the Canary Islands in 2003, it presented itself in coalition with other parties such as the Partido Nacionalista Canario within the Federaci√≥n Nacionalista Canaria. In recent years, several cases of corruption involving members of the PIL have been reported. The former president of the nationalist party, Dimas Mart√≠n, a former senator and president of the Cabildo of Lanzarote, has been convicted six times and imprisoned four times for various crimes of corruption between 1998 and 2004, including forgery, bribery and embezzlement. The PIL has acceded, among others, to the mayor's office in the municipalities of Teguise (Dimas Mart√≠n, and Jos√© Dimas, son of the previous one) and Arrecife (C√°ndido Armas, after buying the vote of a councillor for 26 million pesetas), or the vice-presidency of the Cabildo of Lanzarote (Fabi√°n Mart√≠n, son of the president of the PIL). In the municipal and regional elections of June 2007, he ran with the CCN, but was not represented in the Canarian Parliament, although he achieved a good representation in the Cabildo of Lanzarote, where he was the second political force after the PSOE. It is precisely with this party that he has maintained government pacts in the Cabildo, as well as in some main town halls of Lanzarote, including Arrecife. In the 2008 general elections, it ran with the Canary Islands Coalition, without achieving this electoral pact representation either in the Spanish Senate for the island of Lanzarote or in the Congress of Deputies, by district of the province of Las Palmas.

Her mother and two sisters were also lawyers, at a time when there were only eight female lawyers in Wisconsin. Biography Harriet Hamilton Pier was born on April 26, 1872, in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, on April 26, 1872. She was the third daughter of Kate Pier. Pier was educated in the public schools of Fond du Lac, Madison and Milwaukee, and was graduated from the Milwaukee High School in 1889. With the inheritance from her father, Kate Pier went to law school and became a lawyer. Her three daughters, Kate Hamilton Pier, Caroline Hamilton Pier and Harriet Hamilton Pier, would also attend law school. Mother and daughters constituted a law firm practicing first in Fond du Lac and then, in 1888, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The firm was instrumental in the passage of two laws in the Wisconsin Legislature, one enabling women to act as assignees, and another enabling women, who were attorneys-at-law, to be court commissioners. The firm did not take criminal business, but outside of that their practice is a general practice, running mostly to corporation, real estate and probate law. Harriet Hamilton Pier entered the law department of the Wisconsin University, and, at the end of two years, she took her degree of LL.B. In 1891 Caroline and Harriet were admitted to the bar, and in this way mother and daughters were four of the eight female lawyers in Wisconsin. Harriet Hamilton Pier studied the Polish language, all sisters having practical knowledge of the German. Harriet Hamilton Pier specialized in real estate law. She had much experience in and about the pine forests of northern Wisconsin and had actual personal charge and management of large tracts of timber land. She married Charles Gilchrist Simonds (1873-1943), an electrical engineer with the General Electric Company of Schnectady.

He graduated from Harvard University in 1919. On June 27, 1922 he married Marjorie Katherine Kennard in Cazenovia, New York. The ceremony was performed by Charles Brent, Bishop of the Episcopal Church's Diocese of Western New York. The Hatches resided in Wayland, Massachusetts and had a summer home in Castine, Maine. They had one child, Francis W. Hatch Jr. Business In 1921, Hatch went to work for the firm of Barton, Durstine & Osborne (later Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborne). He eventually became the firm's vice president and manager of its Boston office. He retired from the firm in 1956. In 1960, the Advertising Club of Boston created the Francis W. Hatch Awards for creative excellence in advertising. Outside of advertising, Hatch was a director of the Putnam Fund, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and Shreve, Crump & Low. Philanthropy Hatch served as the New England Chairman and was a member of the national board of directors for the Boy Scouts of America. He also served as chairman of the Committee on Boys' Life. In 1945, he received the Silver Buffalo Award, the organization's highest honor. During World War II, Hatch was active in the United States Red Cross, Community Fund, and War Bond campaigns. He also was a member of the Naval Manpower Survey Board of the First Naval District, the Naval Officer Recruitment Board, and the Massachusetts Committee on Public Safety. Hatch led the Greater Boston Red Cross Fund campaign for 1946. In 1947 he was elected to the Massachusetts General Hospital board of trustees. In 1953 he was named publicity chairman of the Mental Health Fund of Massachusetts. He served as chairman of the 1956 Red Feather drive.

It provides a distinction from charter management organization which is a non-profit manager of charter schools. The terms are often used interchangeably, with resulting confusion. Other and older usages of the term describe an organization that develops and distributes school curricula. These organizations in the United States provide the curricula for public schools, charter schools, virtual schools, and homeschooling parents. History In 1991, Minnesota enacted legislation that enabled charter schools. Other states followed. The state or its delegate issues a charter to a school. In most states, the charter-holder has the privileges and responsibilities of a school board, but not the taxing authority. Many states have adopted laws that require that the holder of the school charter be a non-profit organization. As a result, the most common form of a charter management organization is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. The charter holder may contract all aspects of school operation to an education management organization. The EMO accepts the full amount of state subsidy per student. If it can operate at a lower cost, the difference is profit for the EMO. The school may advertise that it is a non-profit, which it is, even if there is a for-profit entity operating in the background. For- profit EMOs Wisconsin, California, Michigan, Massachusetts, and Arizona allow for-profit corporations to manage charter schools. Examples include: *K12 *Academica *Pansophic Learning *Connections Academy Vendor operated school In some cases a school's charter is held by a non-profit that chooses to contract all of the school's operations to a third party, often a for- profit CMO. This arrangement is defined as a vendor-operated school, (VOS). Distinction from charter management organization One authority on schools, Stanford University's Center for Research on Education Outcomes makes no distinction between terms. In its recent reports it describes CMO -- non- profit and CMO -- for-profit. The National Alliance for Public Charter Schools makes a clear distinction. CMOs are non-profit; EMOs are for-profit.

Mataichi was inaugurated into his 2-year term at the conclusion of the party conference on 25 February 2018.  Summary  Contrary to initial prediction, incumbent Tadatomo Yoshida declined to run for another term as SDP leader, citing the need for the next leader to be an elected SDP lawmaker. As no one filed their candidacy before the original 12 January deadline, the submission deadline was extended to 26 January. In the ensuing weeks, party members pushed for one of its lawmakers to step in. It was anticipated that either Secretary-General Seiji Mataichi or the party's most junior lawmaker Hajime Yoshikawa would run for the leadership. Incumbent SDP lawmakers and Yoshida's supporters in the prefectural government in his native ≈åita also urged Yoshida to rethink his decision and run for re- election, but he declined. Following further consultations among SDP leaders, the party decided to support Seiji Mataichi to run as the next party leader.

Dots indicate positions (place fields) where action potentials were recorded as the rat moved back and forth along a track, with color indicating which neuron emitted that action potential. Phase precession is a neurophysiological process in which the firing of action potentials by individual neurons is timed in relation to the phase of neural oscillations in the surrounding cells. In place cells, a type of neuron found in the hippocampal region of the brain, phase precession is believed to play a major role in the neural coding of information. John O'Keefe, who later shared the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery that place cells help form a \\"map\\" of the body's position in space, co-discovered phase precession with Michael Recce in 1993. Place cells Pyramidal cells in the hippocampus called place cells play a significant role in self-location during movement over short distances. As a rat moves along a path, individual place cells fire action potentials at an increased rate at particular positions along the path, termed \\"place fields\\". Each place cell's maximum firing ratewith action potentials occurring in rapid burstsoccurs at the position encoded by that cell; and that cell fires only occasionally when the animal is at other locations. Within a relatively small path, the same cells are repeatedly activated as the animal returns to the same position. burst of activity Although simple rate coding (the coding of information based on whether neurons fire more rapidly or more slowly) resulting from these changes in firing rates may account for some of the neural coding of position, there is also a prominent role for the timing of the action potentials of a single place cell, relative to the firing of nearby cells in the local population. As the larger population of cells fire occasionally when the rat is outside of the cells' individual place fields, the firing patterns are organized to occur synchronously, forming wavelike voltage oscillations. These oscillations are measurable in local field potentials and electroencephalography (EEG). In the CA1 region of the hippocampus, where the place cells are located, these firing patterns give rise to theta waves. Theta oscillations have classically been described in rats, but evidence is emerging that they also occur in humans. EEG theta wave In 1993, O'Keefe and Recce discovered a relationship between the theta wave and the firing patterns of individual place cells. Although the occasional action potentials of cells when rats were outside of the place fields occurred in phase with (at the peaks of) the theta waves, the bursts of more rapid spikes elicited when the rats reached the place fields were out of synchrony with the oscillation. As a rat approached the place field, the corresponding place cell would fire slightly in advance of the theta wave peak. As the rat moved closer and closer, each successive action potential occurred earlier and earlier within the wave cycle. At the center of the place field, when the cell would fire at its maximal rate, the firing had been advanced sufficiently to be anti-phase to the theta potential (at the bottom, rather than at the peak, of the theta waveform). Then, as the rat continued to move on past the place field and the cell firing slowed, the action potentials continued to occur progressively earlier relative to the theta wave, until they again became synchronous with the wave, aligned now with one wave peak earlier than before. O'Keefe and Recce termed this advancement relative to the wave phase \\"phase precession\\". Subsequent studies showed that each time a rat entered a completely different area and the place fields would be remapped, place cells would again become phase-locked to the theta rhythm. It is now widely accepted that the anti-phase cell firing that results from phase precession is an important component of information coding about place. Other systems There have been conflicting theories of how neurons in and around the hippocampus give rise to theta waves and consequently give rise to phase precession. As these mechanisms became better understood, the existence of phase precession was increasingly accepted by researchers. This, in turn, gave rise to the question of whether phase precession could be observed in any other regions of the brain, with other kinds of cell circuits, or whether phase precession was a peculiar property of hippocampal tissue. The finding that theta wave phase precession is also a property of grid cells in the entorhinal cortex demonstrated that the phenomenon exists in other parts of the brain that also mediate information about movement. Theta wave phase precession in the hippocampus also plays a role in some brain functions that are unrelated to spatial location. When rats were trained to jump up to the rim of a box, place cells displayed phase precession much as they do during movement along a path, but a subset of the place cells showed phase precession that was related to initiating the jump, independently of spatial location, and not related to the position during the jump. Phase precession in the entorhinal cortex has been hypothesized to arise from an attractor network process, so that two sequential neural representations within a single cycle of the theta oscillation can be temporally linked to each other downstream in the hippocampus, as episodic memories.

Locust Star acts as a sort of bridge between the two, featuring songs from both. =The song= \\"Locust Star\\" is a track originally from Through Silver in Blood. This split includes a shortened edit of the song that was distributed to radio stations as a promotional. Musically, \\"Locust Star\\" is an aggressive post-metal song that has since been recognized as one of Neurosis's signature tracks. A music video for \\"Locust Star\\" directed by Neurosis and Andrei Rozen was released in 1996. The video depicts a weary man wandering through a wasteland, assaulted by visions. =The EP= Locust Star is composed of four tracks from Through Silver in Blood, three of which are new shortened edits, and three tracks by Tribes of Neurot, one of which appeared on their 1995 album Silver Blood Transmission. The closing songs, \\"Sustenance\\" and \\"Crawl Inside\\", are unique to this release.

It was founded in December 2017 by Brj√°nn Sigurgeirsson and Klaus Lyngeled, in conjunction with Bergsala Holding, as the parent company for their Gothenburg-based game development studios, Image & Form and Zoink. Thunderful was expanded into the Thunderful Group in December 2019, taking over Bergsala Holding's distribution subsidiaries. The group is made up of operational units for development, publishing, and distribution.  History  Image & Form and Zoink, two independent video game developers based in Gothenburg, developed a close relationship when their founders and chief executive officers (CEOs), Brj√°nn Sigurgeirsson and Klaus Lyngeled, respectively, became best friends. Although the two studios were separated by the G√∂ta river, Sigurgeirsson and Lyngeled met frequently due to the small size of Gothenburg's indie scene. Among other things, Image & Form and Zoink shared testing activities and marketing capabilities. Image & Form had previously been 50%-acquired by Bergsala Holding (the holding company of Bergsala, Nintendo's exclusive distribution partner in Sweden) and when Sigurgeirsson eventually introduced Lyngeled to the company, they agreed Bergsala Holding to also acquire half of Zoink. Sigurgeirsson, Lyngeled and Bergsala Holding decided to merge the two studios and created Thunderful as the parent company for them in December 2017. The company is jointly owned by the founding parties, of which Bergsala Holding holds a 50% stake and Sigurgeirsson and Lyngeled each 25%. Sigurgeirsson and Lyngeled became the CEO and chief creative officer (CCO), respectively, of Thunderful, while both remained CEOs of their individual studios. The move was announced in January 2018, at which point Thunderful had 46 employees. Alongside the merger, a publishing arm, called Thunderful Publishing, was also set up to handle third- party game publishing. Ed Valiente, the former business development manager for Nintendo of Europe, joined Thunderful as head of publishing in April 2018 and became the managing director for Thunderful Publishing. In July 2018, Thunderful additionally acquired Rising Star Games, Bergsala Holding's previous publishing arm. With the deal, Valiente, in addition to his role at Thunderful Publishing, also became the managing director for Rising Star Games, replacing Martin Defries, who left the company. In December 2019, Bergsala Holding combined its distribution businesses‚ÄîBergsala, Amo Toys Nordic, and Nordic Game Supply‚Äîwith Thunderful, creating the Thunderful Group. The new Group was reorganized into three operational groups: Thunderful Development, containing Image & Form and Zoink; Thunderful Publishing, containing Thunderful Publishing AB and Rising Star Games; and Thunderful Distribution, containing Bergsala, Amo Toys Nordic and Nordic Game Supply. Thunderful Group remained under the shared ownership of Bergsala Holding, Sigurgeirsson Lyngeled, and kept its headquarters in Gothenburg. In February 2020, Thunderful Group announced its acquisition of Guru Games, a developer based in Sk√∂vde. By this time, Thunderful Group had 170 employees.  Operational groups = Thunderful Development = Image & Form  Image & Form International AB was founded by Brj√°nn Sigurgeirsson, who acts as its CEO, and an unnamed co-founder in 1997. Sigurgeirsson had collected experience in web design after working from Tokyo and San Francisco, and when he applied for several jobs of the same type in Gothenburg and would have gotten all of them, he established Image & Form as a two-man multimedia and web operation to capitalise on this industry. While Sigurgeirsson intended to call the company Imagenation, his co-founder wished for it to be called Monkey Business; a vote between their friends was to resolve this dispute, though a third suggestion, \\"Image & Form\\", received the best reception. The business soon expanded with web-based game production, and in 2002 it was contracted to complete an edutainment game project for a Norwegian publisher. After that project was finished, the two companies continued co-operating for games made entirely by Image & Form. This continued as a side-business for Image & Form until 2007, when the publisher asked for speed up production to produce eight games per year, up from previously one game in 18 months. The series was sold to a Danish publisher that eventually closed in 2009. Through this development, Image & Form created 30 edutainment games in the same series between 2007 and early 2010. Image & Form's portfolio diversified when it released its first iOS game, Gyro the Sheepdog, in late 2009. Following onto this, Image & Form also released Mariachi Hero, Hugo Troll Race, and, in October 2011, Anthill. Its most successful series of games, SteamWorld, started with the release of SteamWorld Tower Defense on Nintendo DSi in 2010. In late 2011, Bergsala Holding acquired 50% of the company, and Image & Form became Bergsala Holding's primary development arm. As of April 2019, Image & Form has 25 employees.  Zoink  Zoink AB was founded in 2001 by Klaus Lyngeled, who acts as its CEO. Lyngeled had initially started developing games when he and some friends produced a pinball game for the Amiga. They later got together with a similar team based in Norrk√∂ping and, together, founded Unique Development Studios. When Lyngeled got tired of working for Unique Development Studios, he moved to the United States to work for Shiny Entertainment. He worked on Messiah and Sacrifice but when he began working on Enter the Matrix, he faced, among other things, issues with his visa, wherefore he returned to Sweden, where he founded Zoink. By 2003, Zoink was working on animated films, later advertisement films, and finally advertisement games; clients for the latter included Sony, The Coca-Cola Company, Cartoon Network, and Google. Zoink's first full game was The Kore Gang, revived after its original Xbox version had been cancelled for six years. Zoink's breakout title was Stick It to the Man!, later spawning a spiritual successor, Flipping Death. As of May 2018, Zoink has 25 employees. In 2018 Zoink released a new game, Fe. Its next title, Lost in Random, is scheduled for a release in 2021 for the Nintendo Switch.  Guru Games  Guiding Rules Games AB (Guru Games) is based in Sk√∂vde, Sweden. = Thunderful Publishing = Thunderful Publishing AB  Thunderful Publishing AB was created alongside Thunderful and is in charge of the group's third-party publishing operations. Ed Valiente acts as its managing director since April 2018.  Rising Star Games  Rising Star Games Limited was founded on 10 July 2004 and is based in Hertfordshire. It was set up by Martin Defries as a joint venture between Bergsala Holding and Japanese publisher Marvelous Entertainment. Marvelous Entertainment sold its 50% share in Rising Star Games to Intergrow, another Japanese publisher, in January 2010. Rising Star Games opened a United States office based in California in January 2012. Thunderful acquired Rising Star Games from Bergsala Holding in July 2018, at which point Ed Valiente became its managing director and Defries left the company. = Thunderful Distribution = * Bergsala * Amo Toys Nordic * Nordic Game Supply  References  External links  * Companies based in Gothenburg Holding companies of Sweden Joint ventures Video game companies established in 2017 Video game companies of Sweden Video game publishers Swedish companies established in 2017 Holding companies established in 2017 ","title":"Thunderful Group"},{"id":"56414573","text":"Sten S√∂derberg was a Swedish footballer and bandy player.

She disappeared on November 11, 1969, and was found dead two days later at the Soldier Park training area of Fort Meade. Malecki's murder remains unsolved; the Netflix documentary series The Keepers, released in May 2017, alleged a possible connection to the murder of Catherine Cesnik. Biography Joyce Malecki was born on June 12, 1949 in Baltimore County, Maryland, to Casimir Malecki Sr. (1919‚Äì1980) and Doris Marion Johnson (1924‚Äì2012). She had three brothers, Donald Joseph (1944‚Äì2016), Darryl, and Pat. Malecki was living in Lansdowne, on the 200 block of Laverne Avenue, and worked at a liquor distributor.  Disappearance and death  On November 11, 1969, Malecki went Christmas shopping at Harundale Mall in Glen Burnie. She was wearing a brown turtleneck sweater and plaid slacks, and was scheduled to meet a boyfriend stationed at Fort Meade for a date, but never appeared. Malecki's disappearance occurred four days after the disappearance of Cathy Cesnik, a Catholic religious sister who taught at Archbishop Keough High School. Two days after her disappearance, Malecki's body was discovered partially submerged on the bank of the Little Patuxent River, at Fort Meade's Soldier Park training area, by two hunters constructing a deer blind. She was found with her hands tied behind her back and with scratches and bruises on her body, indicating she had struggled with her assailant. An autopsy performed by Dr. Isidore Mihalakis indicated the cause of death was either by choking or drowning. A single deep knife wound found in Malecki's throat was insufficient to cause death. She had approximately \\"15 superficial cuts on the neck and abrasions on her forehead, nose and chin\\". Malecki's body was found on federal property, and the case was therefore under FBI jurisdiction. At the time, FBI agents believed there was a possible link with Cesnik's disappearance: both women had been shopping in close proximity, had similar builds, and disappeared within days of each other. However, the Bureau was unable to conclusively link the two cases. Edwin R. Tully, special FBI agent in charge of the Baltimore field office, claimed to have a number of suspects. The Bureau remains the lead agency for this case, and despite information circulating online, the investigation has not been handed over to the Anne Arundel County Police Department.\\"Local Police Remind Public FBI Investigating Joyce Malecki Murder\\" CBS Baltimore, May 25, 2017 Renewed interest In 1994, Jean Hargadon Wehner and Teresa Lancaster, two former Keough students who suffered alleged sexual abuse at the hands of Father Joseph Maskell, brought a lawsuit against the Archdiocese of Baltimore. Wehner claimed to the Baltimore County Police Department (BCPD) that Maskell had driven her to a wooded area and shown her Cesnik's body. Consequently, the BCPD reopened Cesnik's case and reviewed a possible connection with Malecki's. Police received numerous telephone calls providing information regarding Cesnik's murder after local news reports about the allegations against Maskell renewed public interest. It was discovered that Malecki had spent time around Maskell. A second wave of interest was sparked after the release of the Netflix documentary series The Keepers in May 2017. Cesnik and Malecki's murders have been linked to two additional killings in the area. On October 16, 1970, 16-year-old Pamela Lynn Conyers disappeared from Harundale Mall. Her body was discovered less than a week later in Anne Arundel County, placed between the eastbound and westbound lanes of what was then Maryland Route 177 (now Maryland Route 100). On September 27, 1971, 16-year-old Grace Elizabeth \\"Gay\\" Montanye of Franklin High School disappeared from a shopping center in Reisterstown. Her body was found two days later by Mount Auburn Cemetery in South Baltimore. Maskell's body was exhumed on February 28, 2017, for DNA testing involving the murder of Cesnik. Maskell's DNA did not match the forensic profile from 1970, but this is not enough to definitively discount him as a suspect.

Crystals are commonly grown as fibers, solid cylinders, hollow cylinders (or tubes), and sheets (or plates). More complex shapes such as tubes with a complex cross section, and domes have also been produced.Dobrovinskaya, Elena R., Leonid A. Lytvynov, and Valerian Pishchik. Sapphire: material, manufacturing, applications. Springer Science & Business Media, 2009. Using a shaping process can produce a near net shape crystal and reduce the manufacturing cost for crystals which are composed of very expensive or difficult to machine materials.  List of shaping processes  * Edge-defined film-fed growth (EFG) * Horizontal ribbon growth (HRG) * Micro-pulling-down (¬µ-PD) * Stepanov technique * String ribbon  Edge-defined film-fed growth  Edge-defined film-fed growth or EFG was developed for sapphire growth in the late 1960s by Harold LaBelle and A. Mlavsky at Tyco Industries. A shaper (also referred to as a die) having dimensions approximately equal to the crystal to be grown rests above the surface of the melt which is contained in a crucible. Capillary action feeds liquid material to a slit at the center of the shaper. When a seed crystal is touched to the liquid film and raised upwards, a single crystal forms at the interface between the solid seed and the liquid film. By continuing to pull the seed upwards, the crystal expands as a liquid film forms between the crystal and the top surface of the shaper. When the film reaches the edges of the shaper, the final crystal shape matches that of the shaper. The exact dimensions of the crystal will deviate from the dimensions of the shaper because every material has a characteristic growth angle, the angle formed at the triple interface between the solid crystal, liquid film, and the atmosphere. Because of the growth angle, varying the height of the meniscus (i.e. the thickness of the liquid film) will change the dimensions of the crystal. The meniscus height is affected by pulling speed and crystallization rate. The crystallization rate depends on the temperature gradient above the shaper, which is determined by the configuration of the hot-zone of the crystal growth furnace, and the power applied to the heating elements during growth. The difference in thermal expansion coefficients between the shaper material and the crystal material can also cause appreciable size differences between the shaper and the crystal at room temperature for crystals grown at high temperatures. The shaper material should be non-reactive with both the melt and growth atmosphere, and should be wet by the melt. It is possible to grow multiple crystals from a single crucible using the EFG technique, for example by growing many parallel sheets. = Applications = Sapphire: EFG is used to grow large plates of sapphire, primarily for use as robust infrared windows for defense and other applications. Windows about 7 mm thick x 300 mm wide x 500 mm long are produced. The shaper is typically made from molybdenum. Silicon: EFG was used in the 2000s by Schott Solar to produce silicon sheets for solar photovoltaic panels, by pulling a thin-walled (~250-300 Œºm) octagon with faces 12.5 cm on a side and diameter about 38 cm, about 5‚Äì6 m long. The shaper is typically made from graphite. Other oxides: Many high melting-point oxides have been grown by EFG, among them Ga2O3, LiNbO3, and Nd3+:(LuxGd1‚àíx)3Ga5O12 (Nd:LGGG). Often an iridium shaper is used.  Horizontal ribbon growth  Horizontal ribbon growth or HRG is a method developed for silicon by which a thin crystalline sheet is pulled horizontally from the top of a crucible. The melt level must be constantly replenished in order to keep the surface of the melt at the same height as the edge of the crucible from which the sheet is being pulled. By blowing a cooling gas at the surface of the growing sheet, very high growth rates (>400 mm/min) can be achieved. The method relies on the solid crystal floating on the surface of the melt, which works because solid silicon is less dense than liquid silicon.  Micro-pulling-down  : The micro-pulling-down or ¬µ-PD technique uses a small round opening in the bottom of the crucible to pull a crystalline fiber downward. Hundreds of different crystalline materials have been grown by this technique. A variation called pendant drop growth or PDG uses a slot in the bottom of the crucible to produce crystalline sheets in a similar manner.  Stepanov technique  The Stepanov technique was developed by A.V. Stepanov in the Soviet Union after 1950. The method involves pulling a crystal vertically through a shaper located at the surface of the melt. The shaper is not necessarily fed by a capillary channel as in EFG. The shaper material may be wetted or non-wetted by the melt, as opposed to EFG where the shaper material is wetted. The technique has been used to grow metal, semiconductor, and oxide crystals. Czochralski growth using a floating shaper known as a \\"coracle\\" was done for some III-V semiconductors prior to the development of advanced control-systems for diameter control.  String ribbon  : The string ribbon method, also known as dendritic web or edge- supported pulling, has been used to grow semiconductor sheets including indium antimonide, gallium arsenide, germanium, and silicon. A seed crystal with the width and thickness matching the sheet to be grown is dipped into the top surface of the melt. Strings of a suitable material are fixed to the vertical edges of the seed and extend down through holes in the bottom of the crucible to a spool. As the seed is raised, string is continuously fed through the melt and a liquid film forms between the seed, the strings, and the melt. The film crystallizes to the seed, forming a sheet or ribbon.

She was inducted into San Francisco Prep Hall of Fame in 1988 and the US Tennis Association's Northern California Hall of Fame in 1996. Career Helen Wong grew up with her siblings near Chinese Playground, and received her first tennis racket as a donation from the local playground director. One of her siblings, Willie \\"Woo Woo\\" Wong would go on to earn fame as a basketball player in the 1940s. Like her brother, Wong attended St. Mary's Chinese Catholic School and played basketball for the Chinese Saints; her teams won the Catholic youth league championships in 1947 and 1949. In an exhibition game in 1947, the Saints lost to a team from Letterman Hospital, but Wong scored 19 of the team's 34 points. Wong was also an avid tennis player, winning a local junior tournament in 1949. She pursued her passion for tennis with the help of Charles Harney, who paid for her lessons for approximately a year, and Father Donal Forrester, who drove her to tournaments. In 1965, Wong was billed as the national Chinese tennis champion and won a tournament in Santa Cruz. She stopped playing tennis in her 40s after being diagnosed with lupus, but resumed playing a decade later once the disease was managed; she would go on to be ranked first nationally in the 50s, 55s, and 60s women's divisions, and won seven national senior tennis titles, including the Women's 55 Singles title in 1988. Wong went on to earn a master's degree in counseling from the University of San Francisco and worked as an advisor and counselor at City College of San Francisco and as a physical education instructor at Galileo High School. Wong was inducted into the San Francisco Prep Hall of Fame (for basketball, tennis, and volleyball) in 1988, and the Northern California United States Tennis Association Hall of Fame in 1996. Dr. Kathleen Yep compared her feats to those of Babe Didriksen.

It was built in 1856 in what was then the separate community of Valley Creek. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 for its local significance in the themes of architecture and exploration/settlement. As one of the original houses in Valley Creek, it was nominated for helping to depict one of the many small Washington County settlements that formed around a commercial venture‚Äîthough one that never progressed to formal platting‚Äîand the community's two-decade preference for Greek Revival architecture. Valley Creek was later formally incorporated into Afton. Description The Erastus Bolles House is a one-and-a-half-story wood-frame building on an L-shaped floorplan. Its design is extremely simple. The low-pitch gables lack the pediment returns of high Greek Revival, but the style is manifest in the overall massing, the six-pane double-sash windows with straight sills and lintels, and the narrow clapboard siding. The main entrance is offset to the right edge of the front fa√ßade. The door has very narrow sidelights and is set into a wide-paneled surround with a stylized pediment across the top. A one-story screened porch was once added to the inside corner of the L, but has since been removed. History Erastus Bolles was born in Madison County, New York, in 1821. In 1855 he traveled to Minnesota to visit his uncle Lemuel Bolles, who had settled in Washington County in 1842 and built the first private gristmill north of Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin. The younger Bolles liked what he saw and returned the following year with his wife Sophronia and their children to settle permanently. They picked a location a little farther up Valley Creek from Lemuel's mill, adjacent to the Point Douglas to Superior Military Road, where they constructed this house and a blacksmith shop. Once a year in the fall the Bolles family would travel to Saint Paul to purchase winter supplies, a journey that involved setting out with a team of oxen at 3:00 in the morning. Erastus Bolles, who had trained as a blacksmith and toolmaker with his father, harnessed water from Valley Creek in 1858 to power a trip hammer and other equipment, allowing him to expand into manufacturing farm implements. A community taking its name from the waterway grew around Bolles's business. In 1863 the Valley Creek School was first organized, meeting initially in the Bolles home until a schoolhouse could be moved onto land Erastus sold for the nominal fee of a dollar. In the early 1870s he opened a retail store, becoming postmaster of Valley Creek. Upon their daughter Emma's wedding to Silas Geer in 1873, Erastus and Sophronia gave them land across the road as a wedding present, upon which they built their own house. In 1875 Erastus transferred the smithy business to their son Charles, who soon relocated it a short distance downstream and added corn and feed grinding facilities. The Bolles store burned down in 1880 but Erastus had it rebuilt and turned it over to Charles and his other son Fred. Erastus Bolles died the following year. The Bolles House was nominated to the National Register of Historic Places as one of three early Valley Creek houses in a 1981 thematic resource study. The Newington Gilbert House was also listed but the third residence, built for the Bolleses' daughter and son-in-law, was not.

The film is based on Lee's 2012 autobiography Dare to Be a Champion (which has been translated into English by Patty Tai Peck Sing). The film stars in the titular role 2 newcomers: 13-year-old Jake Eng and 22-year- old Tosh Chan, who were picked from more than 2,000 auditioned hopefuls. Plot The movie begins with a young boy asking Lee how to be as good of a shuttler as him after a badminton match. A flashback then brings Lee back to his tough upbringing and the story of how he overcame setbacks along the way. The film features a mix of real-life accounts and dramatic fiction, culminating in the 2006 Malaysia Open final where Lee miraculously saved 8 match points against great rival Lin Dan to win the title, one of the few and first occasions where Lee defeated Lin in their numerous encounters over the span of their decade-long rivalry.

The Heliogyro spacecraft's attitude (orientation), and therefore thrust direction, would be controlled by changing the cyclic and collective blade pitch similar to a helicopter. Although the Heliogyro design has no mass advantage over a square sail, it remains attractive because the method of deploying large sail blades is simpler than a strut-based design. Blade stiffness is achieved by spinning the spacecraft (centrifugal force) with its rotational axis generally pointing at the Sun. CubeSail spacecraft=Overview= The University of Illinois together with CU Aerospace designed this mission to demonstrate deployment and to measure the thrust on a 7.7 cm √ó 250 m membrane (about 20 m2) made of aluminized mylar. The membrane is deployed between two 1.5U CubeSats that separate from each other in low Earth orbit. It is intended as a first step towards the development of the larger solar sail concept called UltraSail. Re-orientation of the CubeSats will cause the sail to undergo aerodynamic drag in the upper atmosphere for its disposal. =Selection= The spacecraft was selected in 2012 by NASA to be launched as part of the ELaNa program.Anna Heiney, ELaNa 19: CubeSail, NASA, Dec. 10, 2018.

The spacecraft spins around the central hub to flatten the blades by centrifugal force, supported by tip-CubeSats. For the kilometre long blades' stability, this requires a rotational period of 1 ‚Äì 2 hours so they overcome the solar pressure force by 3 to 5 times. Each blade is a thin polyimide film coated with ripstop. For UltraSail, blade control (and hence the spacecraft's attitude control) is initiated by small controllable mini-satellites (tipsat) at the tip of each blade.Design Concept for a Solar Sail with Individually Controllable Elements. (PDF) Tong Luo, Ming Xu, and Qingyu Qu. Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets. 2017. The tipsat mass provides a stabilizing centrifugal force on the blade while in rotation. Each tipsat would be a 5-meter long carbon-fiber structure with a total mass of 50 kg, including avionics and 20 kg propellant (catalyzed nitrous oxide () and cold gas). Alternatively, the tipsats could be propelled with electric microthrusters to control blade pitch.UltraSail. (PDF) R. Burton, and G. Benavides. 2003.

Gooding (1877 - January 26, 1938) was a publicity agent who organized the St. Louis, Missouri, Women's City Club, forerunner to the Town Club and wrote advertising for the Lesan Advertising Company, later Gardner Advertising Company. Biography Hattie B. Gooding was born in 1877 in St. Paul, Minnesota, her grandfather being one of the early settlers. Her mother was of Scotch descent. She moved to St. Louis, Missouri, in 1898. In 1907 she studied bookkeeping and stenography without the aid of teachers, and took a position for the Lesan Advertising Company, which shortly after changed its name to the Gardner Advertising Company, in the capacity of stenographer. After three weeks she took up work in the advertising department, covering everything from face creams to cook stoves. Writing the special advertisements for Scruggs, Vandervoort & Barney Company for six months, was also one of her experiences, and the publicity work for the Charity Carnival in 1908 was her first big undertaking. Starting from 1910, she was in the advertising business for herself, since when the musical bureau she established forced her out of this business. Hattie B. Gooding was the responsible for a series of worthy musical attractions presented to the St. Louis public during the season of 1913-14. Gooding went to New York to arrange with the musical managers for the attractions offered. Out of a long list she selected those who represent the highest in their own special field, and which she felt sure St. Louisans would enjoy. The list began with Madame Louise Homer prima donna contralto of the Metropolitan Grand Opera Co., followed by Josef Hoffman, pianist, and Anna Pavlova and the Russian ballet. For the last the expenses were $5,500.00 ($ in dollars) for two nights, and the receipts $7,500.00 ($ in dollars), netting a clear gain of $2,000.00 ($ in dollars); her other evenings were proportionately successful financially. The advance sales were greater than any other city in the United States. At the Pavlowa concert, when Gooding engaged, at the last hour, the Russian dancer for two nights, the New York managers became dubious and anxiously rushed four special advance agents to assist her. On seeing the bookings for both nights they quietly slipped back to New York fully convinced of her ability to attract audiences in St. Louis, which had always, heretofore, been called \\"the worst show town\\" in the country. On the list for 1914 and 1915 there were also Mischa Elman, violinist, with Maggie Teyte, soprano, in joint recital; David Mannes, and his wife Clara Mannes (sister of Walter Damrosch), for many years concertmaster of the New York Symphony Orchestra; Helen Keller and Anne Sullivan Macy, lecturing on The Heart and Hand, and the Kneisel Quartette, Fritz Kreisler, violinist, and Elizabeth Van Endert of the Royal Opera Company of Berlin, Sir Douglas Mawson, lecturer. Despite being a working woman, Gooding was of the position that women did not need suffrage. Despite her opinion, or maybe due to it, she was on the board of judges, with Charlotte Rumbold and Thekla M. Bernays, in the Votes-for- Women contest held by The St. Louis Post-Dispatch. She was an active member of the Carondelet's, and organized the Women's City Club which gave luncheons every month for the purpose of having the business women of the city, and others interested in municipal affairs, to come together. This was the forerunner of what became the Town Club. She was the editor of The St. Louis Post-Dispatch's food page. Her sister, Grace F. Gooding was the secretary of the St. Louis Artists' Guild. She was member of the press committee of the St. Louis Society for the Relief and Prevention of Tuberculosis and press committee of the St. Louis District of Women's Clubs, and a member of the board of directors of the Consumer's League; she was secretary of the Women's City Club and the only woman among ten men of the board of the Civic League Committee of Public Safety and Law Enforcement. She lived at 6604 Virginia Avenue and 605 Clara Avenue, St. Louis, and died on January 26, 1938, and is buried at Park Lawn Cemetery.

The Devoted Actor ¬Æ Model  ARTIS fellows have long looked at the behavioral dimensions of conflict, focusing on sacred values and identity fusion. ARTIS has trademarked The Devoted Actor Model as a way to model human behavior which fundamentally diverges from rational, utilitarian behavior and can lead people to pursue violence. Most notably, the company published an article in the journal Nature Human Behavior in August 2017 titled 'The Devoted Actor's Will to Fight and the Spiritual Dimension of Human Conflict'. This seminal work has resulted in features in multiple major news outlets including in CNN on Motivations driving fighters in The Levant, in The Guardian Why people die for a cause, and The Telegraph Where the mind is without fear.

As a juvenile she showed promise by winning one race and finishing third in the Molecomb Stakes. In the following year she finished fourth in the 1000 Guineas and won the Haverhill Stakes before beating a strong field to take the Epsom Oaks in a race record time which stood for more than half a century. She was retired from racing at the end of the season. Beam made no impact as a dam of winners and died in 1941 at the age of seventeen. Background Beam was a bay mare bred in the United Kingdom by her owner John Lambton, 3rd Earl of Durham. She was sent into training with Frank Butters at his Fitzroy House stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. She was ridden in most of her races by Tommy Weston. She was one of the best horses sired by Galloper Light, an English- bred stallion who won the Grand Prix de Paris in 1919. Beam was a daughter of Mistrella (foaled 1907), a British broodmare whose other descendants included Light Brocade, Lady Capulet and the Ascot Gold Cup winners Foxhunter and Trimdon. Racing career=1926: two-year-old season= As a two-year-old in 1926, Beam ran four times and recorded her only success on her final appearance when she won the Houghton Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse winning by a short head from Cartona. She had earlier finished third to the colt Shian Mor in the Molecomb Stakes at Goodwood. =1927: three-year-old season= In the spring of 1927 of Beam ran in the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket and finished fourth of the twenty-eight runners behind Cresta Run, Book Law and Endowment. At the same track in May she won the nine-furlong Haverhill Stakes, coming home eight lengths clear of her eight opponents. On 3 of June Beam was one of sixteen three-year-old fillies to contest the 149th running of the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse. Book Law started the 5/2 favourite ahead of Cresta Run with Beam next in the betting on 4/1. Beam took the lead from the start but after becoming unbalanced on the downhill section of the course she stumbled and was overtaken by Book Law. She rallied in the closing stages to regain the advantage and won a \\"terrific race\\" by a head from Book Law with a gap of six lengths back to Grande Vitesse in third place. Her winning time of 2:34.6 was a record for the race which stood until 1982. Tommy Weston reported that the filly had been unsuited by the course and would have won by at least two lengths on a straight track. Later in June Beam was beaten by Adieu in the Queen's Vase at Royal Ascot. She won one other minor race in 1927 before being retired from racing at the end of the season. Assessment and honours In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Beam an \\"inferior\\" winner of the Oaks. Breeding record Beam was retired from racing to become a broodmare for Lord Durham's stud. She produced two minor winners from nine foals and died in 1941.

It is found in the deep sea in the tropical and subtropical western Atlantic Ocean, being quite common at a depth of around on the Mesoamerican Reef off Roat√°n, Honduras. Description This starfish has ten to fourteen long tapering arms with distinctive large eyespots on the tips. These are each composed of about a hundred complex ocelli; on close examination these structures were found to be virtually devoid of sensory structures and may be non-functional. The disc and arms of this starfish are clad in spines, themselves armed with pedicellariae (small claw or wrench- shaped organs). Ecology Novodinia antillensis perches on the branches of arboreal deep water corals, extending its arms into the water column to catch small crustaceans drifting past. The arms form a feeding fan, the pedicellariae grasp and secure the prey, and the arms form loops that surround the food item and take it to the mouth. On the Cape Fear coral mound off North Carolina at a depth of around , the dominant macrobenthos included N. antillensis as well as the American conger (Conger oceanicus), the alfonsino (Beryx decadactylus), sea urchins and squat lobsters (Eumunida picta). Each species, especially the fish, had its own favoured niche habitat, often on the southern and southwestern slopes of the mound. More transient visitors to the seamount included the shortbeard codling (Laemonema barbatulum) and the blackbelly rosefish (Helicolenus dactylopterus) which were mostly found on the lower slopes and base of the mound.

The group was created after all seventeen members of the council's UKIP group left the party, saying they \\"had enough of the aggressive and bitter reality of party politics\\". In 2018, the former party leadership defected to the Conservative party; and were followed soon after by two incumbent councillors who joined the Conservative Group in November 2018. Following losses in the 2018 local election, this left the party with just ten councillors. Although Tim Aker joined his council colleagues in the new group, he subsequently stated that he would continue to represent UKIP in the European Parliament for the purposes of Brexit: \\"UKIP has a job to do in the European Parliament in seeing we get the Brexit we voted for.

It stars Ansel Elgort and Rachel Zegler as the film's leads, alongside Ariana DeBose, David Alvarez, Mike Faist, Corey Stoll and Brian d‚ÄôArcy James, as well as Rita Moreno, a star of the original 1961 film, appearing in a supporting role.

This prompted 20th Century Fox to acquire the rights to the project. Tony Kushner, who previously worked with Spielberg on 2005's Munich and 2012's Lincoln, revealed in a July 2017 interview that he was writing the screenplay for the film, stating he would be leaving the musical numbers intact, and that the story would be more similar to the original musical than to the 1961 film. In a 2020 interview, Spielberg told Vanity Fair: \\"West Side Story was actually the first piece of popular music our family ever allowed into the home. I... fell completely in love with it as a kid.\\" = Pre- production = In January 2018, it was announced that Spielberg would likely direct the film following completion of filming for a fifth installment of the Indiana Jones franchise. This was followed a few days later with an open casting call issued for the characters Maria, Tony, Anita and Bernardo. Additional open casting calls were hosted in New York City in April, and in Orlando, Florida in May. In July, the fifth Indiana Jones film was pushed back, allowing Spielberg to begin pre-production on West Side Story. Justin Peck was hired to choreograph the film in September 2018, with Ansel Elgort cast in the film as Tony. In November, Eiza Gonz√°lez emerged as a contender for the role of Anita. Rita Moreno, who played Anita in the 1961 film, was cast as Valentina, a reworked version of the character Doc. In January 2019, newcomer Rachel Zegler was cast in the lead role of Maria, with Ariana DeBose, David Alvarez, and Josh Andr√©s Rivera also cast as Anita, Bernardo, and Chino, respectively. In March 2019, Corey Stoll and Brian d'Arcy James joined the cast. A month later, the rest of the ensemble comprising the Jets and Sharks factions was announced. = Filming = Filming took place in Harlem and other Manhattan locations and in Flatlands, Brooklyn, in New York City in July 2019.Yakas, Ben. \\"Video: West Side Story Fever Hits NYC as Steven Spielberg Films Around Town\\", Gothamist, July 30, 2019 There were ten days of shooting in Paterson, New Jersey,Beckerman, Jim. \\"West Side Story movie set going up in Paterson ahead of filming\\", North Jersey Record, July 3, 2019 where an outdoor set was built, in August 2019.

One of the terms in the agreement was to hold Political Consultative Conference (PCC) as soon as possible, which were series of multi-party talks to discuss political reforms in postwar China. The CPC organized many support meetings for these conference across the country, which were routinely disrupted by the secret police of the Nationalist government attempting to encourage anti-CPC sentiments.  The incident  On 10 February, elements of different associations affiliated with the CPC held a meeting in Chongqing to celebrate the success of PCC. The Nationalist government agents soon entered the meeting place and began attacking other participants that were present before leaving the scene. After the incident, Zhou Enlai protested to Chiang Kai-shek in person, only to have his complaint dismissed in return.  Aftermath  After the incident, the CPC were convinced that peaceful settlements with the Nationalist government was no longer an option.

While Ross and Parler are not themselves from a Gullah community, all the band members grew up in South Carolina. Prior to forming Ranky Tanky, Ross was active in the band Matuto, a world music group which combined Brazilian Forr√≥ music with modern jazz elements. The other band members' careers have been similarly varied: Parler was a contestant on season two of American Idol,Eyre, Banning. \\"Ranky Tanky's Self-Titled Debut Makes Traditional Gullah Songs New.\\" NPR.

The overall goal of the group was to create a contemporary interpretation of the Gullah musical vocabulary to share with the world, while remaining true to the pared-down, working-class attitude of the songs. = Ranky Tanky (2017) = Ranky Tanky's debut studio album featured 13 tracks, all of which are arrangements of Gullah folk songs. Writing for NPR, Banning Eyre declared that \\"on the self-titled debut by the quintet Ranky Tanky, Gullah songs are lively, soulful honey to the ears...in a pop music milieu ever hungry for newness, this group proves that the right musicians can make the past new all over again.\\"  Musical style and reception  The Gullah lyrics and melodies that Ranky Tanky uses range from traditional spirituals, to children's rhymes and dance music. Due to its relative geographic isolation, the Sea Islands region preserved more of the West African rhythms, dialects, and musical traditions than the mainland US, which once combined with British colonial influence emerged as the distinct Gullah culture. Ranky Tanky's use of instruments like the electric guitar and trumpet are novel additions to Gullah music, which was historically performed using only a cappella voices and body percussion. Ross credits the 20th century African American folk singer Bessie Jones as laying much of the groundwork for the band, due to her extensive recording and documentation of the songs and rhymes later used in Ranky Tanky. Akornefa Akyea's review of their song That's Alright on Afropop Worldwide stated that: \\"you hear the common theme in most spirituals of looking to life after death as a welcome reprieve from the inhumane conditions experienced by enslaved black people in America...it‚Äôs this incredible duality of profound sadness positioned in front of a forward- moving rhythm section that quite frankly makes you want to dance and sing along with hope.\\"Akyea, Akornefa. \\"Ranky Tanky.\\" Afropop Worldwide.

Rathbun, Kajiwara Photo Helen Rhind Rathbun Bissell (July 1, 1870 - November 9, 1944) was a noted St. Louis artist, one of the strongest landscape painters. Her work, considered almost masculine in its strength, possessed much of that swing and vigor which put the work of Cecilia Beaux and Mary Cassatt in the first rank of American painters. Biography Helen Rhind Rathbun was born in Petaluma, California on July 1, 1870, the daughter of Edwin Rathbun and Katherine Donaldson. While in the Normal School, from which she was graduated, Helen R. Rathbun showed such decided talent that Frederick O. Sylvester, her instructor, urged her to devote her undivided time to this branch of art. A short course in the St. Louis Art School was of much value, but she then mainly trained under Edgar J. Bissell (1861-1928), and later married him. Helen R. Rathbun worked in water colors and oil and children were her favorite subjects, although interior scenes were also handled with superior skill, and outdoor studies, landscapes and street scenes showed an effort to realize the light and air which nature surrounded and spred over all of her works, a constant cry for light and always more light. The Distant Hills was a scientific study of color and a feeling for the dramatic, common in all of her work ‚Äî swiftly moving clouds, flowing water, the glitter of sunshine, the action and movement that nature gives to her mise en scene. Another quality she got in her later work was that the picture seemed larger than the canvas ‚Äî larger than it really was. The clouds seemed to continue higher, the landscape to spread out broader, and this was unconscious on the artist's part, she just felt and got it. In speaking of Rathbun's pictures, Edgar Bissell, a portrait painter, said, \\"Miss Rathbun just seems to paint from knowledge ‚Äî just sits down anywhere and paints a picture without looking around for 'compositions.\\" Describing one called And the Flood, it was just the brimming river spreading over everything ‚Äî water everywhere ‚Äî in the masses of clouds hanging heavily above ‚Äî technically ‚Äî just values and color and handling and the elimination of unnecessary things from the composition. One large painting, The Broken Toy, was a bit of child nature ‚Äî the little man who seeks the source of sympathy, the eternal feminine where all troubles are brought and from the artistic side it is a very successful effort to show the spread of the sunshine thrown over the scene ‚Äî children, lawn, trees. Helen R. Rathbun, In the Garden Mother Love was another good picture, a good rendering of color and textures, the way forms disappear and the mysteries of the shadows. Boy Fisliing was another attractive picture. A boy with a short stick with a bent pin tied to a string angling for a fish that never bites, and that is somewhat like the artistic profession ‚Äî a paint box and some brushes and a hard-hearted public. In her old-fashioned home, brought up by her aunties since she was nine years old, Rathbun spent her life; the antique furnishings and quaint surroundings developed in her such a love of this atmosphere that many of her pictures show the influence ‚Äî the peace, placidity and harmony in her interior subjects rests one to look at them. One particular picture made from a corner of the living room shows a little maid sitting contentedly in an old-fashioned armchair near a table of polished mahogany of an early period, a sconce on the wall and an open door showing the furnishings of the next room in perfect harmony. This was a treasure ‚Äî there was such an air of cheerful comfort that one longs to creep into the picture and be a part of it. In 1908 she exhibited with Martha Hoke and Cornelia Maury at the St. Louis gallery at 10 South Broadway. In 1911 she exhibited at the Dietrich Gallery. In 1915 she exhibited two paintings in the Panama Pacific International Exposition. Many of her pictures gained honors as well as prizes. In 1909 she was awarded the first prize at the woman's exhibit of the Artists' Guild. This was An Autumn Landscape. The next year she captured a prize in the same exhibition. She has also exhibited in the Eastern art galleries. In 1928 she made the news when she was swindled out of a diamond ring value $1,000 ($ in dollars). She married Edgar J. Bissell in 1914, and had one son, William Edgar John Bissell (1916‚Äì1945), who committed suicide. She lived at 3016 Bartold Avenue, St. Louis, and died on November 9, 1944, in Maplewood, Missouri. She is buried at Bellefontaine Cemetery, St. Louis.

The parish boundary extends to Broomhouse, Parkhead, Saughton, Sighthill, Gorgie and further. History=Establishment= After the restoration of the Scottish Catholic hierarchy in March 1878, there were only five parishes serving the City of Edinburgh; St Mary's Cathedral, St Patrick's Cowgate, Sacred Heart Lauriston, St John the Evangelist in Portobello and St Mary Star of the Sea in Leith. By the end of the 19th century, Edinburgh had begun to expand, and St Cuthbert's, Slateford was opened for worship in 1889.St Cuthbert's Church History For the first quarter of the 20th century, it served the West side of the city. However, Edinburgh continued to expand, and Catholics began to complain about the distance they had to walk to get to Mass (in the days before regular public transport or mass car ownership). As such, it was agreed that a new church would be built even further west than St Cuthberts, beyond Longstone. Wartime temporarily halted plans for the construction of a new church, in the meantime, Mass was celebrated at Murrayburn Primary School. Four curates from St Cuthbert's celebrated on a rota basis from 1942-1950.St Joseph's Parish History Originally it was planned to built the new church on the corner of Parkhead and Calder Road, but this plan was rescinded. After much debate, construction of a new church began at the present site in Broomhouse. The parish was dedicated to St Joseph and officially opened for worship on Easter Sunday 1950. The church building and the priory were completed in 1953.St Joseph's Parish History The first Parish Priest, Fr Peter Higgins was appointed in 1953, coming from St Ninian's, where he had been a curate. The current church was meant to be a \\"temporary construction\\" (originally envisioned as the church hall), and post wartime a purpose-built church would be designed once resources were more plentiful. These plans never came to fruition, although building work did take place around the church in the form of a wall and an extension to the Priory to allow for visitors. St John Ogilvie's Parish was opened in 1970 to serve Wester Hailes, and thus the parish boundary for St Joseph's changed in 1977. The Calders became part of the newly established St John Ogilvie's, while St Joseph's took on Stenhouse, switching from St Cuthbert's. =Augustinian era= Fr Andrew Forrest, the final Diocesan Parish Priest, relocated to Bo'ness in 1995. In 1994, the Order of Saint Augustine had withdrawn from their two parishes in Currie (Our Lady, Mother of the Church) and Balerno (St Joseph's), and instead decided to take on the administration of St Joseph's in Broomhouse. The first Augustinians arrived in Broomhouse in January 1995, and Fr Kevin Lowry OSA was appointed Parish Priest. By October 1995 changes were made and a new Augustinian community arrived in Broomhouse. Father John Reid OSA was appointed parish priest, and remained until September 2009. His tenure of 14 years at the helm makes him the longest serving Augustinian parish priest and second longest overall, behind Fr Joseph McCabe. In 2000, the parish celebrated its Golden Jubilee, with the construction of a commemorative stained glass window at the back of the church. This was donated by St David's Church, Broomhouse, in celebration of continued ecumenism and co-operation between the two neighbouring churches, despite theological differences. Further celebration took place in 2001, when for the first time in many years, and only the second time in the Parish's history, an ordination to the priesthood took place in the church. Br Stefan Park OSA completed his studies under the mentorship of Fr John, and chose St Joseph's as the location for his ordination. A new hall was constructed in 2005, as compensation for some of the church land being used for a new housing development. This resulted in a complete renovation of the outside of the church, and a new entrance door and front porch being added. In 2016, the parish hosted the University of Notre Dame Folk Choir for one week during their tour of Scotland and Ireland. The visit was co-ordinated by St Joseph's, and culminated in a concert by the choir in St Joseph's Church. After Fr John moved to Birmingham in 2009, a new Augustinian community arrived in Broomhouse, causing a short period of instability within the parish. 5 different Parish Priests were appointed, each for short terms, over a period of 9 years. The Augustinian community in Broomhouse was finally restored to full quota in 2017. Fr Paul Graham OSA was appointed Parish Priest. He is supported by Fr Ian Wilson OSA as Prior of the Community, and Fr Sean Quinlan OSA as Assistant Priest. Sister Parishes There are a further 4 Augustinian parishes in the UK; St Mary's, Harborne, Birmingham, Our Lady, Mother of Good Counsel, Clare Priory, Suffolk, St Augustine's, Hammersmith, London and St Monica's, Hoxton, London. However, St Joseph's is the only remaining Augustinian parish in Scotland.The Augustinian Friars in the UK Archdiocesan Restructuring In 2017, the parishes of the Archdiocese of St Andrews and Edinburgh were placed into \\"clusters\\" to better share and pool their resources. St Joseph's is one of 4 parishes in Cluster 7 of the St Giles' Deanery, along with St Cuthberts, St John Ogilvie's and Our Lady Mother of the Church, Currie. It is planned that in the near future, the parishes of St Joseph's, Broomhouse and St John Ogilvie's, Wester Hailes, will be merged to form one parish, although the 2 church buildings will remain open for worship.

The Maritime Museum in Stockholm is responsible for the listing of historic ships in Sweden (). The purpose of the listing is to encourage and support owners of historic ships and boats to preserve and take care of their vessels. The listing does not confer any legal protection on the vessels or obligations on their owners but entitles them to some privileges. Ships and pleasure boats Historic ships and boats can be listed in either of two categories: Listed historical ships or Listed historical pleasure boats. The purpose of listing vessels is similar in both cases; it is done in order to \\"make them better recognized, preserved and used\\". In addition, the listing aims to encourage conscious private cultural heritage ownership and management. Owners of listed ships are entitled to display a plaque that confirms the ship's listed status on board, and pleasure boats are equipped with a similar enamel sign. While the listing does not confer any legal protection on the ships ‚Äì in contrast to listed buildings ‚Äì the Maritime Museum notes that listed ships and boats under some circumstances enjoy reduced harbour fees and listed pleasure boats sometimes enjoy various benefits by harbours, canals, dockyards and boat clubs. For example, a news item from 2013 notes that at on Djurg√•rden in central Stockholm, listed boats and ships may berth for a short period of time free of charge if they agree to let visitors come aboard. Listed pleasure boats are also e.g. exempted from a national ban on letting out toilet waste into the surrounding water. The museum is also responsible for providing financial aid to the restoration of culturally significant private ships and boats, and while there is no direct connection between owning a listed vessel and receiving aid, the Maritime Museum has concluded that many owners of listed ships have voiced the opinion that an important way to facilitate the management of listed ships is to increase this financial support. Some owners of listed pleasure boats have voiced that the listing has attracted attention to them and their boats from other boat owners, boat clubs, and in maritime festivals and competitions, as well as from local papers and radio channels. Commercial and utility ships have been listed since 2001, and pleasure boats since 2009. Sweden was the first country in Europe to list pleasure boats. The museum made an evaluation of its listing of ships in 2014, and of the listing of pleasure boats in 2017. =Listing of ships= For a ship to be eligible for inclusion on the historic ship list, it must meet the following criteria: * It has to be at least long and wide. * It has to be at least 50 years old or of such an age and character that it can be deemed significant from a cultural perspective. * It was built or constructed in Sweden, or was registered in Sweden for a prolonged period or else deemed to be of very high value for the promotion of knowledge about the maritime history of Sweden. * Commercial and utility vessels smaller than 12 by 4 metres can be eligible if there are special reasons. The owner of the ship submits an application to the museum containing, among other things, an account of the ship's history and its present state of preservation. The museum then makes an assessment based on seven criteria, taken from the handbook of assessing listed buildings issued by the Swedish National Heritage Board and adopted to maritime conditions. Listed ships are graded by the museum between I and III, where I represents the highest grade of cultural value. =Listing of pleasure boats= The following criteria must to be fulfilled for a boat to be eligible for listing by the museum: * The boat was originally built as a pleasure craft. * The boat was built in Sweden; or designed by a Swedish boat constructor; or is of a model which has been popular in Sweden; or in some other way considered important to preserve from a cultural perspective. * It was built before 1965; boats constructed later may be considered for listing if they are large and have extraordinary cultural significance. * The boat's history must be well- documented. * It must be in a good and seaworthy condition. Repairs and alterations must have been made in a considerate way. * The boat must not be a copy or reproduction of another vessel. * Only individual boats are considered eligible, not entire series or models of boats. The owner of the boat may apply twice a year to have the boat listed. If a boat is listed and at a later point sold, the museum asks the owner to provide contact details to the new owner of the pleasure craft in order to be able to maintain knowledge about the fate of these boats. Traditional-ship classification The Maritime Museum also conducts Traditional-ship classification (T-classing) of ships of historic value. The classification is aimed at guaranteeing the seaworthiness of the ship while maintaining its historic value and allows older ships to obtain certificates needed in order to sail in international waters.

All 23 people aboard were killed. The aircraft was flying from Pyongyang with construction cargo and numerous workers ahead of the 1984 Organization of African Unity summit due to take place the following year. It remains the deadliest aviation crash in Guinean history, and was the tenth operational loss of an Il-62 since its introduction. Aircraft and flight P-889 was a Soviet-made Ilyushin Il-62M manufactured by the Kazan Aviation Plant in early 1981. It was sold to North Korea's national airline, Chosonminhang (now called Air Koryo), the same year. With the exception of an aborted takeoff in 1982 due to an inadvertently opened cargo hatch, the aircraft had no incident history. On 1 July 1983, P-889 was carrying construction material, as well as several construction workers and technicians, from Pyongyang, North Korea to complete work on a hall ahead of the twentieth Organization of African Unity summit scheduled to take place in Conakry, Guinea, in May 1984. P-889 made two intermediate stops on the way to Guinea, stopping in Kabul and Cairo to refuel. Accident and aftermath On 1 July 1983, P-889 crashed in the Guinean highland region of Fouta Djallon, near the town of Lab√©, 160 miles northwest of Conakry International Airport. All 23 aboard were killed. It was the airline's first fatal accident. News of the crash was slow to spread due to difficulties in reaching the remote crash site. Although the cause of the crash was never publicly released, pilot error compounded by fatigue is suspected. A high-level delegation of Guinean government officials traveled to North Korea shortly after the crash to deliver official condolences to Kim Il Sung.

History Professional baseball was first played in Greeneville, Tennessee, by the Greeneville Burley Cubs in the Appalachian League in 1921. They remained in the league through 1925 and returned for a second stretch from 1938 to 1942. The Burley Cubs were followed in the same league by the Greeneville Astros, who played in the city from 2004 to 2017. The Houston Astros, parent club of Greeneville, withdrew their affiliate from the Appalachian League after the 2017 season. The circuit's vacancy was filled by the Cincinnati Reds, who placed a Rookie-level affiliate in Greeneville known as the Greeneville Reds. The Reds played their inaugural game on June 19, 2018, against the Bristol Pirates at Pioneer Park. The 10‚Äì2 loss was attended by 2,388 fans. Their first win came two nights later when they defeated the Pirates, 13‚Äì12, before 813 in attendance.

Yuanqu or Wanqu was also the name of its eponymous county seat. The town was destroyed by a flood of the Yellow River in 1168, and its territory merged with Jiyin County. The ruins of the county seat were rediscovered at Longwangmiao Village in southwestern Mudan District in June 2007 by a team of archaeologists from the district government. Name YuƒÅnq√∫ is the pinyin romanization of the present Mandarin pronunciation of the Chinese placename . Because the character is now usually pronounced j√π in its sense of \\"phrase\\" or \\"sentence\\", the town and county's name is frequently. misread as YuƒÅnj√π in English sources. Although now has the variant readings q√∫, j√π, g≈çu, and g√≤u in different contexts, the Old Chinese pronunciation of all of these has been reconstructed as /*[k]À§(r)o.../ or as /*ko.../, with slightly different terminal consonants later developing into the modern pronunciations. Similarly, both and were originally pronounced /*qon/, leading to their interchangeable use in ancient records about the county. Both characters in the name‚Äîmeaning \\"curvy\\" or \\"bent\\"‚Äîrefer to the meandering course of the Ji River, a major river which once flowed through the area but whose bed was assumed by the Yellow River during its massive 1852 flood.. Lin Chuanjia further claims that \\"Yuan\\" () was an occasional ancient name for the Ji. Under Wang Mang's Xin Dynasty, Yuanqu was known as . Under the Song, the name was changed to , from t√≠ng‚Äôs sense of \\"straight\\" or \\"erect\\". Location Yuanqu County covered most of present-day Dongming County and the southwestern part of what is now Mudan District, Heze Prefecture, Shandong. The remains of Yuanqu, its chief city and seat of government, are now located near Longwangmiao Village (t s L√≥ngw√°ngmi√†o C≈´n) in Malinggang (t s M«él«êngg«éng Zh√®n), southwest of the central core of Mudan and northwest of present-day Caoxian.. History Wang Xianzhi and Huang Chao's rebellions against the Tang, with \\"Yuanju\\" marked. The territory of Yuanqu County had been a center of Chinese civilization since at least the Shang, who had their capital Bo in nearby Cao County. Sima Qian records that, under the Han, there was even a legend that the Yellow Emperor had obtained a valuable sacrificial tripod at Yuanqu.. The area was part of the state of Liang during the Zhou Dynasty. The historical county was probably established under the Qin, although some sources place its creation under the Han. Under the Qin, it is said to have formed part of the Eastern Commandery (t s D≈çng J√πn) of the Henan Area (t s H√©n√°n D√¨q≈´). Under the Han, it formed part of Jiyin Commandery (t s J√¨yƒ´n J√πn) and was also sometimes considered part of the princely realm of Liang. Under Wang Mang's short-lived Xin Dynasty, its name was changed to Jiping and it was given the status of a commune, rather than a county seat. In Kaihuang3 (583), the Sui emperor Yang Jian (posthumously known as the \\"Wen\\" or \\"Literary Emperor\\") abolished Jiyin and organized Yuanqu as part of Cao Prefecture. In the 860s and early 870s, the area suffered droughts but its people met with indifference or malice from Tang officials. Huang Chao, the son of a wealthy local salt merchant, tried to become one of these mandarins but failed the imperial exams and took up salt smuggling instead.. When the salt smuggler Wang Xianzhi rose against the empire in nearby Changyuan County in 874,. he was able to overrun several towns and even defeated the local forces under Xue Chong ( Xuƒì Ch√≥ng), the governor of the area's Tianping Circuit ( TiƒÅnp√≠ng D√†o). The next year, Huang Chao raised several thousand men of his own from Yuanqu and joined Wang, eventually overrunning much of the country and proclaiming the Qi Dynasty before being defeated and driven to suicide in 884... (Yuanqu was the place where the Shato Turk leader Li Keyong ceased pursuing the fleeing Chao, although the would-be emperor met his end soon afterwards beside Mount Tai.) In Yuanyou1 (1086), the Song emperor Zhao Xu (posthumously known as \\"Emperor Zhezong\\" or the \\"Wise Ancestor\\") changed the name of the county to Wanting. Under the Jin, the county seat at Yuanqu was destroyed by the flood of the Yellow River in Dading8 (1168). The county was subsequently abolished, with its territory added to Jiyin. Chinese archeologists from Mudan District excavated the ruins at Longwangmiao Village in June 2007 under the direction of Pan Jianrong (t s PƒÅn Ji√†nr√≥ng). They established their identity as Yuanqu and examined the eastern city wall, which runs for . The walls originally stood about high, although presently about two-thirds of the structure is underground, the soil of surrounding countryside having built up over the years.

The title is derived from Navajo culture, which speaks of a cougar, N√°shd√≥√≠tsoh, who protects the Navajo people. After her father's 2008 death, Anne continued the series. The Navajo Nation on which the story takes place, is a geographical area that spans 27,000 square miles over the connecting borders of the US states of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. According to the NN itself, it encompasses 500 Indian tribes on 318 reservations. Plot When off-duty Navajo Police Officer Bernadette Manuelito attends a basketball game at Shiprock High School, the game is disrupted by a car bomb in the parking lot. A young man named Richard Horseman was standing near the car and is injured in the blast, subsequently dying of his injuries. Witness Gloria Chino is able to provide a description and Horseman's first name. The car was a BMW owned by center for the Chieftan basketball team Aza Palmer. He is also an attorney hired to mediate over a Tuba City, Arizona conference to discuss plans to build a resort near the Grand Canyon. Manuelito's husband Jim Chee is directed by his superior officer Captain Howard Largo to accompany Palmer as his bodyguard. FBI agent Jerry Cordova is assigned to investigate the bombing, while Manuelito files a report with Captain Largo. As Manuelito leaves the police station, office manager Sandra gives her a small object found on Tsoodzi≈Ç, a sacred mountain to the Navajos. Manuelito recognizes the object as the image of N√°shd√≥√≠tsoh, a mountain lion believed to protect the Navajo people, and she recalls a traditional praise song to the lion. Manuelito and Cordova interview Mrs. Nez, the victim's grandmother, and come away thinking Horseman was not involved in the crime except being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Manuelito believes the grandmother was lying about Horseman's past. On her route to Tuba City to join her husband, she stops by to consult with Joe Leaphorn, and asks him to research Horseman. Now retired and disabled, Leaphorn verbally communicates in Navajo but seems to have lost his ability to speak English. With help from his live-in friend Louisa Bourebonette, he still has computer access to do the research for Manuelito. He later remembers Horseman as a young child he tried to help. Leaphorn's research reveals that the car bomb was detonated with a cell phone, so he deduces that Horseman was not a likely suspect. Chee arrives at Tuba City and gets the lay of the conference from fellow police officer Cowboy Albert Dashee. He takes notice when he sees delegate Tom Blankenship bad-mouthing law enforcement, but is told Blankenship is a hot-head but harmless. After she arrives at the conference, Manuelito gets a phone call from Lona Palmer, former wife of Aza, telling her that Richard Horseman was her sister's son. When Manuelito tells Aza Palmer who the victim was, he's devastated. At the conference, she runs into medic Byrum Lee and remembers him as one of the first on the scene at the car bombing. Manuelito and Palmer go for a drive, and are followed by \\"Rocket\\" Robert Palmer, son of Aza and Lona. They pull into a restaurant where father and son have an argument about the divorce. Robert also warns them of groups intent on disrupting the mediations. After the son leaves, Palmer tells Manuelito that he remembers seeing Robert's car in the parking lot when the Shiprock explosion happened. Shortly after leaving the restaurant, Robert is hospitalized after a roll-over accident with the car he was driving. Lona calls Manuelito to tell her of Robert's car accident. She mentions that part of Robert's anger is due to her past tumultuous relationship with Byrum Lee. The San Juan Southern Paiute Tribe of Arizona was excluded from the conference mediations, because the tribe was deemed too small to be considered. An old Paiute named Denny Duke takes Palmer to talk to his mother, who explains to him why the land is sacred to the Paiute religion and should not be developed over. The entire convention group makes a trip to the potential canyon development site, where Palmer is kidnapped. Manuelito searches for him, and finds herself a target. Running for her life through the rocks, she encounters N√°shd√≥√≠tsoh and begins to sing the Navajo song praising the lion.

Construction of the building began in 1595, and it originally housed a Jesuit college known as the Collegium Melitense Societatis Jesu. The building had to be repaired after being damaged in an explosion in 1634 and an earthquake in 1693. The University of Malta was established in 1769 after the Jesuits were expelled, and it continued to use the same building. Although the University moved to a much larger campus at Tal-Qroqq in Msida in the 1960s, the Old University Building still houses a number of University departments and it is used for some lectures and conferences. History Palazzino Sapienti (house built by the last English knight) - originally part of the Old University campus which housed the office of the top officials =Background and construction= The precursor to the University of Malta was the Collegium Melitense Societatis Jesu, a Jesuit college which was set up on 12 November 1592. This was originally located in an old house in Valletta, but a new complex to house the college and a Jesuit church had already been commissioned by Bishop Tommaso Gargallo. The building was designed by Giuseppe Valeriano (later alterations were carried out by other architects, possibly including Vincenzo Casanova). Construction of the present building began on 4 September 1595 when the foundation stone was laid down by Grand Master Martin Garzez. Construction proceeded quickly, and the college moved into the building in 1597, while construction was completed in 1602. The church was completed in 1609. =Use and events= On 12 September 1634, both the college and the adjacent church were severely damaged when a gunpowder factory exploded. The buildings were repaired, and the church had its fa√ßade completely rebuilt. The new design was entrusted to Francesco Buonamici. Further damage occurred during the 1693 Sicily earthquake. In 1695, a sundial with a Latin inscription was installed on the rear of the building. In the early 18th century, part of the building was converted into a permanent exhibition by housing artifacts from Ciantar‚Äôs antiquities collection which came from his former residence in Marsa. This brought the attention of several historians at the time, raising the interest of antiquity in Malta at the time. However, soon after the expulsion of the Jesuits, the collection went sparse among those interested to acquire them with minimal concern over the preservation of the artifacts. Portal of the Old University Building The Jesuits were expelled from Malta in 1768, and the building became property of the Treasury of the Order of St. John. However, studies continued and the professors retained their posts. The Pope confirmed the founding of the university of Malta on 20 October 1769. The University of Malta officially came to existence on 22 November 1769, when Grand Master Manuel Pinto da Fonseca signed a decree constituting a Pubblica Universit√† di Studi Generali. The University was briefly suspended during the magistracy of Francisco Ximenes de Texada in the 1770s, but it was reconstituted by his successor Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc in 1779. The University was replaced by the √âcole Centrale during the French occupation of Malta from 1798 to 1800, but was once again reopened by Sir Alexander Ball during the British Protectorate of Malta. Parts of the building were rented out as commercial rooms in the early 19th century, amongst which was the first bank of Malta (the Anglo- Maltese Bank) found on 20 June 1809. The commercial rooms were reconstructed in 1810. In May 1824, a secondary entrance decorated with the British coat of arms was opened in the rear of the building. During World War II, the building housed an Air Raid Precautions Centre. At times, it also housed the Anglo- Maltese Library and the Lyceum. Over time, the campus became too small to house the entire university. Evans Laboratories (now known as Evans Building), a building near the Sacra Infermeria in Valletta, was inaugurated in 1959 in order to house the Faculty of Science. In 1968, the Medical School moved to a building near St. Luke's Hospital in Gwardamanƒ°a. The University opened a much larger campus at Tal-Qroqq in Msida in the late 1960s, and most Faculties moved there. The University only retained the first floor of the Valletta building, and moved out of the second floor in 1978. However, the University refurbished and reopened the second floor once again in 2011. Lectures at the Valletta Campus The Old University Building is now one of the three campuses of the University of Malta, the others being the Msida campus and the Gozo Campus in Xewkija. At one point, the head offices of Heritage Malta were located within the building. Today, the Valletta Campus houses the International Collaborative Programmes, the Research Innovation & Development Trust and the Conferences and Events Unit. It is also used for international conferences and seminars, along with a number of short courses and summer schools. =Heritage and restoration= The Old University Building is listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands. The fa√ßades of the Old University Building and the adjacent church were restored between 2016 and 2019. Architecture The rear entrance with the British coat of arms The Old University Building is located within a city block bordered by Merchants, St. Christopher, St. Paul and Archbishop Streets, and it is located adjacent to the Jesuit church, which was constructed at the same time as the college. The building is three stories high. Its plan is typical of Renaissance-era public buildings, consisting of rooms built around a central courtyard. These include lecture halls, classrooms and cells for the Jesuit priests, all connected to corridors. Today, some of the cells are used as offices. The building also contains a number of boardrooms, lecture rooms, meeting rooms, an auditorium and an Aula Magna. The rear entrance which was opened in 1824 is an example of neoclassical architecture, and it consists of an archway with two Doric columns supporting a lintel, above which is a representation of the Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom. The lintel bears a Greek inscription meaning \\"learning is the gateway to distinction\\". This gate is commonly attributed to Giorgio Pullicino, who was the professor of architecture at the University at the time. It has also been attributed to Colonel George Whitmore of the Royal Engineers, but this is unlikely. The design seems to have been inspired from the by Claude Nicolas Ledoux, which was built in Paris in 1766‚Äì70.

He was Bonapartist deputy for Charente-Inf√©rieure from 1876 to 1893. Early years Eug√®ne Jolibois was born on 4 June 1819 in Amiens, Somme. His parents were Pierre-Fran√ßois Jolibois and Marie-Anne-Rose Dubois. He obtained a law degree and was a member of the Paris Bar from 1840 to 1849. He became a magistrate, and under the Second French Empire was Advocate General first in Amiens and then in Rouen. In May 1861 he was appointed Attorney General in Chamb√©ry. In April 1863 he became Prefect of Savoie, and in December 1866 was appointed to the Conseil d'√âtat. At the end of 1867 he was considered by the emperor as a candidate for Minister of the Interior. Third Republic After the revolution of 4 September 1870 Jolibois returned to private life and again registered at the Paris bar. He was known for his incisive speech during the trials of Bonapartists. In the legislative elections of 20 February 1876 he was sponsored by Baron Eug√®ne Eschass√©riaux as Bonapartist candidate for the second constituency of Saintes, Charente- Inf√©rieure. In his statement of belief he said he remained loyal to the empire and a firm believer in the Appel au peuple (plebiscite). He would devote his efforts to extending trade treaties and developing free trade. He was narrowly elected by 6,933 votes to 6,536 for Count Anatole Lemercier(fr). He sat with the Appel au peuple parliamentary group and became one of the leading speakers of the minority. He often made speeches in which he attacked the government, and always voted with the conservative minority. In the 16 May 1877 crisis he supported the government and became a member of the Bonapartist executive committee chaired by Eug√®ne Rouher. Jolibois was named by Oscar Bardi de Fourtou as official candidate for the second constituency of Saintes in the legislative elections of 14 October 1877, and was reelected by 8,994 votes against 5,758 for the republican Count Lemercier. On 4 November 1877 he also became a member of the General Council of Charente-Inf√©rieure. There was a delay in validation of his election to the Chamber, but on 3 December 1877 it was confirmed. He remained an opponent of the republic and republicans, and spoke repeatedly against the government. He was reelected on 21 August 1881. He was strongly opposed to the domestic and foreign policies of the ministries of L√©on Gambetta and Jules Ferry. He often spoke for the minority, and in January 1882 questioned the government on the arrest of Victor, Prince Napol√©on. Jolibois was reelected on 4 October 1885. He spoke in favour of Henri Michelin's proposal for an inquiry into the origins of the Tonkin Campaign. He fought the proposed expulsion of the princes as a member of the committee on this subject. He made a proposal to revise the constitutional laws to restore the plebiscite, and supported General Boulanger's revisionist manifesto. He voted on 11 February 1889 against the reinstatement of the district poll. He voted for the indefinite postponement of the revision of the Constitution proposed by the ministry of Floquet, against the prosecution of three members of the Ligue des Patriotes, against the draft Lisbonne law restricting the freedom of the press and against the prosecution of General Boulanger. While serving as a deputy Jolibois remained a member of the bar. In the 1889 elections Jolibois ran as a conservative rather than a Bonapartist, although he did not change his position, and was reelected in the first round. He remained a vocal member of the opposition, spoke on a variety of subjects, and was a member of various committees. For several years he was in the budget committee. He was a member of the 1892 committee on the Panama Affair. He did not run for reelection in 1893. His mandate ended on 14 October 1893.

His son Paul Bergs√∏e's memoirs Tre sm√• vinduer (Three Small Windows) describe his childhood home in Nyhavn. In the 1880s and 1890s, royal actor Poul Reumert grew up in the building as the son of actor Elith Reumert and dancer Athalia Reumert. In 1910, the trading company √òrum ¬§ Wulf was based in the building. The company was founded on 13 September 1795 by N. N. √òrumin in partnership with a young merchant, Jens Andreas, but it is unclear when it moved to Nyhavn. The company would close in 1912. In the late 1930s, the \\"ingeneer\\" (engineer) J√∏rgen Koch lived in the building. In 1950, Henriques & Z√∏ylner's Eftf, another trading company, was based in the building. It had been founded by Gustav Aron Henriques (1859-1939) and C. Z√∏ylner (1875-1937) on 1 September 1900, but it is also not known when that company moved to Nyhavn 63. From 1950 to 1988, The Maritime Library (S√∏fartens Bibliotek) was based in the building. It had been founded by the shipping company J. Lauritzen in 1939. The company is now located in R√∏dovre. As of 2018, a hostel is located in the rear wing and the side wing houses a restaurant. Architecture The building consists of three stories over a high cellar The dormers in the roof were not added until 1942. The facade stands in undressed brick and features three stone reliefs between the first and second floor that commemorates the trade of the property's first owner. The one in the middle features a barge with timber. It is flanked by Neptune with his trifork and Mercury with his winged hat, the gods of the sea and trade. A gateway in the left side of the building opens to a courtyard surrounded by buildings. To the right is a five bay side wing in three storeys. It was built in two storeys between 1748 and 1756 and heightened with one story before 1801. The three floor high and four bays wide rear wing was also built between 1748 and 1756. There is also a three-story, half-timbered warehouse from before 1756. The entire complex was listed on the Fanish Registry of Protected Buildings and Places in 1918.

The 4th Canadian (Armoured) Division attacked the German-held town of Friesoythe, and one of its battalions, The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada, captured it. During the fighting, the battalion's commander was killed by a German soldier, but it was incorrectly rumoured that he had been killed by a civilian. Under this mistaken belief, the division's commander, Major-General Christopher Vokes, ordered that the town be razed in retaliation and it was substantially destroyed. Twenty German civilians died in Friesoythe and the surrounding area during the two days of fighting and its aftermath. Similar, if usually less extreme, events occurred elsewhere in Germany as the Allies advanced in the closing weeks of the war. The rubble of the town was used to fill craters in local roads to make them passable for the division's tanks and heavy vehicles. A few days earlier, the division had destroyed the centre of S√∂gel in another reprisal and also used the rubble to make the roads passable. Little official notice was taken of the incident and the Canadian Army official history glosses over it. It is covered in the regimental histories of the units involved and several accounts of the campaign. Forty years later, Vokes wrote in his autobiography that he had \\"no great remorse over the elimination of Friesoythe\\". Context=Allied tactics= By September 1944, the Western Allies had reached Germany's western border, and by the end of October had captured Aachen, the first major German city to fall to them. Over the following six months they overran much of western Germany. In November the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) publicly stated that the forces of the Western Allies would strictly adhere to international law in respect of their treatment of civilians. However, SHAEF's manual Combating the Guerrilla stated that there were circumstances where commanders could take \\"stern measures\\" against civilians as a rapid response to guerrilla attacks, although this was in breach of the Hague Conventions. The frequency and nature of retaliatory actions differed between national contingents within the Western Allied forces. Following SHAEF's policy, United States Army forces destroyed German buildings on several occasions, sometimes entire villages, and took other measures against German civilians. French troops took a similar, if more rigorous, approach to that of the Americans. The British commanders disapproved of retaliations against civilians, and British troops carried out few reprisals. The First Canadian Army served in the predominately British 21st Army Group, and more frequently retaliated against German civilians than the British. The commander of 4th Canadian (Armoured) Division, Major-General Christopher Vokes, believed that destroying property was the most appropriate way of responding to resistance by German civilians. The division carried out actions against German property more often than any other Canadian formation. Soviet forces conducted retaliatory actions than more frequently than their Western Allies. The Soviet Union's leadership was concerned about the threat of a German resistance movement (called Werwolf), and Soviet forces killed, raped and imprisoned large numbers of local civilians and destroyed property following guerrilla attacks. =Allied attitudes= There was frustration throughout the Allied ranks at the Germans' continued resistance in a clearly hopeless cause, anger at the casualties they inflicted when the war was widely, and correctly, perceived to be almost over, and a general feeling that severe, even ruthless, treatment of German soldiers and civilians was justified. On 15 April the British reached Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where the inmates had been reduced to cannibalism. The historian Rick Atkinson wrote that \\"the revelations of April ... sparked enduring outrage\\". An American officer wrote \\"The attitude of higher command seemed to be that these people ... should be made to feel the full significance of war and what their troops had done to other people.\\" US general George Patton wrote in his diary \\"In hundreds of villages ... most of the houses are heaps of stone ... I did most of it.\\" When a sniper fired at one of Patton's officers, he ordered several German houses to be burnt. When the commander of the US 3rd Armored Division, Maurice Rose was killed in action inside Germany on 30 March, several villages were razed by his irate troops, captured wounded Germans were shot on the spot and at least 45 Germans were executed after surrendering. An American artillery officer wrote home in April that \\"we should fire about a thousand rounds into every [German] town. Do them good\\". At least one British battalion refused to take Waffen-SS prisoners, shooting those who surrendered; an officer of the battalion blamed this on SS \\"truculence\\" and a British battalion commander summed up the risk-averse attitude within his unit: \\"At this stage of the war, no one was very keen to earn medals.\\" A British pilot wrote: \\"It seemed a stupid time to die.\\" One British corporal spoke for many when he wrote \\"Why don't the silly bastards give up?\\" Some divisions had suffered their last fatality by mid-April. The historian Max Hastings wrote \\"The final Anglo-American drive across Germany offered ... many foolish little battles which wasted men's lives\\". =Battle for S√∂gel= In mid-March 1945 the Western Allies prepared to cross the River Rhine in Operation Plunder. The Canadian official history describes the circumstances as buoyant as it was recognized that the end of World War II in Europe was close. In early April the 4th Canadian (Armoured) Division, as part of II Canadian Corps, moved out of the eastern Netherlands in the wake of Operation Plunder's success. On 4 April, The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada, part of the 10th Canadian Infantry Brigade, one of two brigades in the division, made an assault crossing of the Ems River and captured the town of Meppen, suffering only one casualty. German prisoners included several 17-year-old youths with less than eight weeks of military experience. The division advanced a further to S√∂gel, which the 1st Battalion of The Lake Superior Regiment (Motor) captured on 9 April. The following day it repulsed several German counter- attacks before the town was declared cleared. Some German civilians joined the fighting and were believed to have killed several Canadian soldiers. Vokes, believing the civilians needed to be taught a lesson, ordered the destruction of the centre of the town. This was accomplished with several truckloads of dynamite. Vokes was aware that these actions violated the Hague Conventions and took care not to issue written instructions. Soldiers of the division started referring to Vokes as \\"The Sod of S√∂gel\\". The Canadian Army official history states: Battle for Friesoythe The Canadian advance continued across the Westphalian Lowland, reaching the outskirts of Friesoythe, a strategic crossroads, on 13 April. As it was early spring, the ground was sodden and heavy vehicles could not operate off the main roads. This made Friesoythe, west of Oldenburg, on the River Soeste, a potential bottleneck. If the Germans were to hold it, the bulk of the Canadians would be unable to continue their advance. Most of the population of 4,000 had evacuated to the countryside on 11‚Äì12 April. Several hundred paratroopers from Battalion Raabe of the German 7th Parachute Division and anti-tank guns defended the town. The paratroopers repelled an attack by the Lake Superior Regiment, which suffered several killed and wounded; German casualties are unknown. Vokes ordered the resumption of the attack by the 1st Battalion, The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's), commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Frederick Wigle. The Argylls conducted a flanking night march and launched a dawn assault on 14 April. The attack met only scattered resistance from a disorganized garrison, and the Argylls secured the town by 10:30. During the confused fighting, approximately 50 German soldiers caught Wigle's tactical headquarters by surprise at around 08:30. A firefight broke out, resulting in the death of Wigle and several other soldiers. A rumour circulated that a local civilian had shot Wigle. =Destruction of Friesoythe= Vokes was furious when he heard of Wigle's death. He wrote in his autobiography that \\"a first-rate officer of mine, for whom I had a special regard and affection, and in whom I had a particular professional interest because of his talent for command, was killed. Not merely killed, it was reported to me, but sniped in the back\\". Vokes wrote, \\"I summoned my ... 'Mac,' I roared at him, 'I'm going to raze that goddam town. Tell 'em we're going to level the fucking place. Get the people the hell out of their houses first. Vokes's GSO1 (head of the operations staff), Lieutenant-Colonel Mackenzie Robinson, obeyed but convinced him to not put this order in writing or issue a proclamation to the local civilians. Hastings writes that the earlier incident at S√∂gel contributed to Vokes's fury. The Argylls had spontaneously begun to burn Friesoythe in reprisal for the death of their commander. After Vokes had issued his order, the town was systematically set on fire with flamethrowers mounted on Wasp Carriers. In the side streets, soldiers threw petrol containers into buildings and ignited them with phosphorus grenades. The attack continued for over eight hours and Friesoythe was almost totally destroyed. As the commanding officer of the 1st Battalion, The Algonquin Regiment later wrote, \\"the raging Highlanders cleared the remainder of that town as no town has been cleared for centuries, we venture to say\\". The war diary of the 4th Canadian Armoured Brigade records, \\"when darkness fell Friesoythe was a reasonable facsimile of Dante's Inferno\\". The Canadian official history states that Friesoythe \\"was set on fire in a mistaken reprisal\\". The rubble was used to reinforce the local roads for the division's tanks and heavy transport, which had been unable to move up due to the main roads near the town being badly cratered, and the smaller roads being inadequate to stand their weight. =Civilian casualties and damage= During the fighting around Friesoythe and its aftermath, ten civilians from the town and another ten from the surrounding villages were killed. There were reports of civilians lying dead in the streets. According to one German assessment, 85‚Äì90 per cent of the town was destroyed during the reprisal. The estimates the destruction to have been as high as 90 per cent. The town's website records that of 381houses in the town proper, 231were destroyed and another 30 badly damaged. A few days later, a Canadian nurse wrote home that the convent on the edge of town was the only building left standing. In the suburb of Altenoythe, 120houses and 110other buildings were destroyed. In 2010, the author Mark Zuehlke suggested that, \\"Not all of Friesoythe was burnt, but its centre was destroyed\\". Aftermath The Argyll's war diary made no mention of their afternoon's activity, noting in passing that \\"many fires were raging\\". There is no record of the deliberate destruction at division, corps or army level. The war diary of the division's 8th Anti-Aircraft Regiment records \\"the Argylls were attacked in that town yesterday by German forces assisted by civilians and today the whole town is being systematically razed. A stern atonement ...\\" The 1st Battalion, The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's) were awarded the battle honour \\"Friesoythe\\", as were the 1st Battalion, The Lake Superior Regiment (Motor) and the 1st Battalion, The Lincoln and Welland Regiment. On 16 April The Lincoln and Welland Regiment attacked Garrel, south-west of Friesoythe. After a German act of perfidythe mayor surrendered the town but the first tank to enter was destroyed by a Panzerfaustthe battalion commander, Wigle's brother-in-law, ordered that \\"every building which did not show a white flag be fired\\". Before it could be carried out, the order was countermanded and the village was spared. A Canadian force was also authorized to burn down the village of Mittelsten following what the historian Perry Briddiscombe calls \\"an unnamed transgression\\". They were talked out of this by a Canadian engineer unit as Mittelsten's civilians were running an army sawmill. =Post- war= In early 1946 Vokes heard an appeal against the death sentence of Kurt Meyer, a convicted German war criminal. Referring to his discussions about this Vokes said to the Canadian High Commissioner in London, \\"I told them of S√∂gel and Friesoythe and of the prisoners and civilians that my troops had killed in Italy and Northwest Europe\\". Vokes commuted the sentence to life imprisonment saying, \\"There isn't a general or colonel on the Allied side that I know of who hasn't said, 'Well, this time we don't want any prisoners\\". The Canadian Army official historian, Colonel Charles Stacey, visited Friesoythe on 15 April. He wrote in the Canadian Army official history, which was published in 1960, that \\"there is no record of how this [destruction] came about\\". Responding to this, the historian Mark Zuehlke wrote that there were records of the events in the war diaries of several units, but that he did not believe Stacey's vagueness was an attempt at a cover-up. In his 1982 memoirs Stacey expanded upon the official history to comment that the only time he saw what could be considered a war crime committed by Canadian soldiers was when Vokes commented in his autobiography, written forty years after the event, that he had \\"[a] feeling of no great remorse over the elimination of Friesoythe. Be that as it may.\\" This position may have been motivated by a continued belief that the retaliatory actions were justified.

Early life and training She was born in Macclesfield, Cheshire, and studied Media Production at the Macclesfield College. Fitzpatrick has congenital retinal folds, meaning that she has had no vision in her left eye and limited sight in her right eye since birth. Despite this, she learned to ski whilst on family holidays from the age of five with her father acting as her guide. She was discovered by a coach whilst skiing at the Chill Factore indoor slope in Manchester in 2010, and subsequently started training with the British Para Snowsport team. She made her international debut for Great Britain in 2012. Skiing career In 2016 Fitzpatrick and Kehoe were the first British winners of the overall World Cup Visually Impaired title at the International Paralympic Committee's World Cup in Aspen. It was Fitzpatrick's first season competing at World Cup level: she and Kehoe also won the discipline title for giant slalom that season, as well as placing second in the super-G classification and third in the downhill and slalom standings. In 2016 she was awarded the Ski Club of Great Britain's annual Evie Pinching award \\"which celebrates the next generation of young, up-and-coming snow sports athletes\\".

Early life, education, and marriage She was born Joan Dorothy Rothwell in the Wavertree district of Liverpool in 1920. She studied dance for three years in Liverpool at the Studio School of Dance and Drama and then studied with Lydia Sokolova. She won the ballet prize of the All England Dance Competition in 1937 and the Parker Trophy for Dance in 1938. She then worked as a dancer and choreographer in commercial theatre where, in 1947, she met the accountant, artist and musician, Rudolf Benesh, who noticed that she was having trouble: \\"During a break while I was painting Joan's portrait, I mused at her struggle to get down on paper her choreographic ideas for a ballet\\". He devised a notation to help her record her dances and they developed the system together. The couple married on 12 March 1949 and she then joined the Sadler's Wells Ballet Company. Benesh Movement Notation The notation uses a five bar stave to record the position of the limbs and body. Above the stave, additional signs record the facial expression and the position of the eyes and fingers. These details arose from Joan's special interest in Bharatanatyam ‚Äì the classical dance of South India. Their notation system was presented to the Royal Ballet, fully published in 1956 and exhibited at Expo 58 in Brussels. In 1960, the Royal Ballet recruited a notator who had been trained in the Benesh system. The Benesh Institute of Choreology was then created in 1962 with Joan as principal, Rudolf as director and Frederick Ashton as president. The Institute established a library of dance scores in London and a residential training college in Sussex. Later life Rudolf died of cancer in 1975 and Joan then retired as principal. She published a history, Reading Dance: The Birth of Choreology, in 1977 and was recognised with the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Award of the Royal Academy of Dance in 1986. She retired to Wimbledon where her hobbies included gardening, sewing and philosophy. She subsequently moved to Skelmersdale to be near her only son Anthony. She died in a nursing home there of pneumonia in 2014, aged 94.

The first part is the sixth episode of the season and the 135th overall and was directed by Brian Loschiavo and written by Steven Davis. The second part is the season's seventh episode and the 136th overall and was directed by Chris Song and written by Kelvin Yu. Guest voices are Gary Cole as Sergeant Bosco, Pamela Adlon as Olsen Benner, Adam Driver as Art the artist, Sam Seder as Harold, Jay Johnston as Jimmy Pesto, David Herman as both Marshmallow and Trev, Jack McBrayer as Marbles, John Early as Dalton Crespin, Todrick Hall as Miss Triple X-Mas, Andy Kindler as Mort, and Matt Berninger as a singer. It first aired on Fox on December 10, 2017. In this episode, the Belcher family tries to find the thief of the top of their Christmas tree.  Plot  Linda Belcher (John Roberts) has a dream about a Christmas party and decides to throw one in the family restaurant together with her husband Bob (H. Jon Benjamin). When she hears that the town's gay nightclub has been closed for legal reasons, she cuts off the top of the family's Christmas tree, puts the ornaments her children have made on it, and places it as a little tree in the restaurant for the party. During the party, Teddy (Larry Murphy) tells the kids about a creature named the Bleaken who is said to steal the Christmas presents from bad children and take them to his lair. After Linda notices that her tree top was stolen, she calls the police. When Sergeant Bosco tells them that a lot of Christmas decorations have been stolen and he has no lead, Linda and Bob interrogate all the guests but cannot figure out who did it. Their daughter Louise (Kristen Schaal) believes that the Bleaken is the thief, so she and her siblings Tina (Dan Mintz) and Gene (Eugene Mirman) try to track it down. At the police station, they find a map of the town with the crime scenes of the thief marked on it. Louise takes a photo of the map with Tina's emergency cell phone. She later finds a pattern on the photo and triangulates the place she thinks is the Bleaken's lair. After Christmas Eve dinner, the kids sneak out of the apartment to go to the Bleaken's lair, which turns out to be an abandoned warehouse in a sketchy part of town. Tina, regretting sneaking out and scared by the warehouse's creepy atmosphere, calls their parents, pretending it was an accidental butt-dial, and gives them the kids' location. Outside of the warehouse, they find an ornament Gene made and some black feathers in the snow, as well as large footprints. They find a hidden door and go downstairs, where they reach a dead end. Bob and Linda arrive and the family decides to look for the thief together. Louise and Bob lift up the staircase to investigate strange noises they hear coming from behind it and find another staircase hidden underneath. Despite Bob's reluctance, the family decides to go downstairs and for a brief moment they see a creature which looks like the Bleaken. Behind a door, they discover a Christmas rave and all the stolen decorations, including the tree top. Linda confronts the ravers, bashing them for stealing other people's Christmas decorations and her Christmas spirit. The ravers, after a performance by Miss Triple X-Mas, tell her that it is the replacement location for the closed nightclub and they do not have a permission for it, which is the reason for the hidden door and staircase. Linda tells the guests that she called the police and that she now regrets it, and Art the artist confesses that he stole all the decorations for the rave. When the police arrive, Bob borrows a Bleaken costume from the man the kids had thought to be the monster earlier and lures the officers away so that the rave is not shut down. He then hides with Teddy in an inflatable Santa Claus where Teddy has been waiting all night to try and apprehend the thief. The next morning, the tree top is reattached to the family's Christmas tree and Linda's Christmas spirit returns full force.  Reception  Brianna Wellen of the A.V. Club gave the episode an \\"A\\" and wrote that it \\"highlights a lot of the similarities between Linda and Louise. Both are hard-headed and somewhat selfish, stopping at nothing to get what they‚Äôre looking for. In this case, the goal is the same even if the journey is different. Linda goes about finding her stoken tree and ornaments like a standard detective, searching for clues and interviewing suspects, all while keeping clever quips going. Louise embarks on a dark adventure, in total search and destroy mode.\\" She also wrote that \\"the Belchers find themselves in a seriously dangerous and frightening situation. There is no reason that Bob and Linda should let the kids continue on in a dark warehouse potentially inhabited by a mystical anti-Santa. In fact, once they realize that the warehouse is actually just a location for a secret Christmas rave, there‚Äôs potentially even less reason for three middle- schoolers to stick around. But it‚Äôs having the cheesy Christmas special family moments in those settings that takes the sap out of the moment and makes the Belcher feel even more like a real family, flaws and all.\\"  References  External links  * 2017 American television episodes Bob's Burgers episodes Christmas television episodes ","title":"The Bleakening"},{"id":"56416840","text":"Muriel Natalie Thomson (born 12 December 1954) is a retired Scottish professional golfer.

Between ten and twenty five dark purplish-red and green flowers are well spaced along a flowering stem tall but lower than the leaf. The flowers are long, about wide and are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is egg-shaped, about long and wide with darker edges and three lines along its centre. The edges of the dorsal sepal have short, dark hairs. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, dark purplish red, about long, wide and spread widely apart from each other. The petals are a broad egg-shape, dark purplish red with marking similar to those on the dorsal sepal and are about long and wide densely hairy edges. The labellum is elliptic to egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, about long, wide, with short, coarse hairs on the sides. There is an oblong callus in the centre of the labellum and covering about half of its surface. Flowering occurs between December and February. Taxonomy and naming Genoplesium alticola was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones from a specimen collected near Danbulla and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The specific epithet (alticola) is derived from the Latin words altus meaning \\"high\\" and cola meaning \\"dweller\\", referring to the plant's relatively high altitude habitat. Distribution and habitat Genoplesium alticola grows in sparse forest, often in grass tussocks on ridges on higher places. It is only known from the Atherton Tableland near Heberton and on Walshs Pyramid.

As its first Officer in Charge, he led the development of the Brown Trout Research Laboratory in Pitlochry into its establishment as the Freshwater Fisheries Laboratory with a national and international reputation for research.  Early life  Pyefinch was born in Kingston upon Hull on 10 January 1911, the elder child of Arthur Edward Hare Pyefinch (1877‚Äì1947). and Ellen Susannah (n√©e Roberts). Pyefinch was educated at Hull Grammar School 1919 to 1924 then Pocklington School in Yorkshire 1924 to 1930.  Education  Pyefinch won a place studying Natural Sciences at St Johns College, University of Cambridge and graduated in 1934, being awarded the degree of MA in 1936.  Career  From 1934 to 1942, Pyefinch lectured in Zoology at the University of Nottingham, being appointed Acting Head of the Zoology Department at the outbreak of the Second World War. Over this period his interests were in the morphology of parasitic crustacea, particularly the Cirripedia and Ascothororacica. He spent some time studying marine ecology on Bardsey Island in North Wales; he identified two new species of Ascothororacica: Baccalaureus Maldivensis Pyefinch (1934) and Baccalaureus Nexapus Pyefinch (1936) Initially part-time in 1942 and then full-time in 1943, he joined a team undertaking research for the Iron and Steel Institute (subsequently the British Iron and Steel Research Association) into the biology of marine organisms, the mechanisms of their attachment and methods used to assess the effectiveness of anti fouling paints ‚Äì work of particular importance for naval vessels at that time.http://rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/roybiogmem/15/99.full.pdf p8 He became head of the anti fouling section of BISRA in 1946 In 1948, pursuing his interest in aquatic biology, he applied for and was appointed as Officer in Charge of the Brown Trout Research Scheme at Faskally in Pitlochry, a new joint venture between the Scottish Home Department and the North of Scotland Hydro Electric Board. This soon became the Brown Trout Research Laboratory and, in 1957, to reflect the changing nature of its work, the Freshwater Fisheries Laboratory. By 1958 the laboratory was sufficiently well established to come under the direct responsibility of the Scottish Home Department (subsequently Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland).Foreword (pp iii‚Äìvi) by C. M. Yonge to Pyefinch, K. A., Trout in Scotland, a story of brown trout research at Pitlochry, HMSO. 1960 During these 10 years, under his leadership, the laboratory had grown from 6 members of staff in temporary quarters in the gunroom at Faskally House to a workforce of 20 in purpose built and other accommodation. By the time he retired in 1973 staff numbered almost 60 and the importance of its work was widely recognised. As head of the only freshwater laboratory in Scotland, he provided scientific background to the work of the Committee set up in 1962 chaired by Lord Hunter, to examine the state of Scottish salmon and trout fisheries. From 1957 he was involved in the work of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) representing Scotland on the Salmon and Trout Committee, chairing this committee (renamed the Andromous and Catadromous Fish Committee) 1970‚Äì1972 and serving from 1966 on the ICES/ICNAF Working Group (International Commission for the North West Atlantic Fisheries) investigating the effects of Greenland salmon fishing on home waters stocks. Pyefinch also represented the interests of Scottish fisheries research on a number of bodies: as a member of the Fisheries Advisory Committee of the Development Commission (until it came to an end in 1964) as a member of the Freshwater Sub Committee of the Natural Environment Research Council from 1967 to 1970, as a member of the Council of the Freshwater Biological Association from 1951 to 1973.Freshwater Biological Association Annual report recording years of membership https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hQxNAAAAYAAJ Some of his publications are listed below. Particularly notable is Trout in Scotland, an account of the work of the first ten years of the work of the laboratory in Pitlochry (reviewed in the New Scientist June 1960 https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RRVRuUO5vFIC New Scientist review). A Review of the Literature on the Biology of the Atlantic Salmon demonstrates his detailed knowledge of the general bibliography of Atlantic salmon; his enthusiastic acquisition of books and reprints contributed greatly to the development of the library at Faskally. After he retired in 1974, he was appointed to the Buckland Professorship, taking as his subject the exploitation of salmon stocks Outside work, he took a keen interest in meteorology, railways and cricket.

Described as fashion forward by New York (magazine), her hammered pieces have been seen on Hollywood celebrities and in feature films.  Early life and education  Originally a writer from Serbia, Behrend transitioned to jewelry making when she emigrated to the United States in 1988. Unable to pursue a career in writing, she turned to the visual arts to express herself. Having acquired some technical skills when she was younger, Behrend was able to train with a master jeweler in Los Angeles before returning to New York City to open her first studio on Catharine Street. She began by making wholesale jewellery for large department stores and then decided to focus on more personal pieces in 1996. Prior to owning her current namesake studio, she co-owned the Oxyg√®ne Collectif atelier with former Wilhelmina model Maria Luisa Mosquera.  Career  Her hand- forged, hand-hammered, and hand-carved jewelry is of Hollywood¬¥s most memorable characters. Behrend is known in fashion circles for her handmade gender blurring jewelry, featured in many magazine layouts and also seen in the film The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. Her pieces have been worn by Madonna, Lenny Kravitz and Gwyneth Paltrow, and are sold in high end boutiques or are custom made. Relying on recycled metals, all of Behrend's work is hand forged using old tools. Her signature pieces are hammered chains that eschew mass-production and were inspired by the jewelry worn by European gypsies. In 2008 Behrend produced a storefront installation with the artist Lisa Kirk, designed for a special edition of the fragrance Revolution. Live FAST Magazine describes Behrend's pieces as being raw and edgy, stating that she \\"..holds true to the purest idea of an artisan\\". Her technique also reveals a soulful approach to jewelry making. According to Behrend,\\"My biggest fear is that it is finished. You have to know when to stop. It has to still be alive.\\" In 2011, the Fitzroy Gallery located in Soho, Manhattan paid tribute to Behrend's methodology by exhibiting various videos, assemblages, and photographs regarding her work.

Many places were named after him like the municipality of Carlos Arvelo since 1936, and the military hospital of Carlos Arvelo located in Caracas.  Early life and education  He was born in the town of G√ºig√ºe on June 1, 1784 to Don Idelfonso Fernando de Arvelo and Do√±a Eugenia de Guevara. Despite having no financial resources, he was able to study in la Real y Pontificia Universidad de Caracas (now Central University of Venezuela), thanks to a special scholarship granted by the Board of Inspection of the University, due to his financial status and being outstanding in his studies, where he demonstrated a particular and astonishing interest for social application of scientific and clinical knowledge. At the beginning of his medical studies he began an internship at \\"el Hospital General de Caridad\\" (The General Hospital of Charity), being appointed by one of his professors, Dr. Alejandro Echezur√≠a, and with the authorization of the Rector of the University. When he wasn't studying, he accompanied Dr. Felipe Tamaris, his Professor who distinguished him among all his disciples, by letting Arvelo assist him in arduous cases of his practices. Plus, Tamaris awarded him the medal for talent and contraction. In 1809 he received the bachelor's degree of Medicine. In 1810 he replaced Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Hern√°ndez, one of his professors, who was sent to the Valleys of Aragua in the campaign against a fever epidemic that broke out there, without having yet the Doctorate in Medicine which he received later that year. He recommended burning all the piles of seeds and cotton that existed in the Valleys. That intervention, one of the most outstanding of his profession, made him worthy of numerous recognitions, especially among the inhabitants of Aragua who entitled him \\"el bienhechor\\" (the benefactor).  Involvement in the Independence War  In 1810 he joined the patriotic army, forming part of the Farmers' Squadron where he was named Captain-Surgeon, and later became director of the Military Hospital of Caracas in 1811. He participated in the Battle of Vigirima (1813) and a year later in the battle of \\"San Mateo\\" and La Victoria where he received a serious bullet wound in the thorax which made him retire from military service and practice his profession as surgeon in Caracas until the independence of Venezuela in 1821. His involvement in the war earned him the appointment as Surgeon in Chief of the Venezuelan Army, granted by Simon Bolivar. Bolivar labeled the attention Arvelo offered to the wounded soldiers as \\"impeccably human\\".  Later life In 1822 he was part of a Commission in charge of studying an improvement plan for the Central University of Venezuela, along with Jos√© Vargas and other illustrious doctors. He then became leader of the reform that opened the way to the creation of the Medical Faculty of Caracas, which was achieved in 1827 by a Decree from Bolivar dated June 25 of that year, replacing the old Protomedicato founded in 1777 by Lorenzo Campins and Ballester. In 1827 Arvelo Guevara was appointed director of the chair of Internal Pathology and Therapeutics of the Central University of Venezuela (UCV). A year later, after being ranked first in the contest, he obtained the chair of Practical and Internal Medicine, in which he remained for twenty years. In addition, he was Vice Chancellor of the University in 1834 and principal director of the Faculty of Medicine the following year. In 1846 he occupied the position of Rector of the UCV. Commissioned by the National Government, in 1852 Arvelo Guevara supervised the experimental researches for treatments of Measles during a measles epidemic that broke out in Venezuela. His rigorous inspection facilitated the control of the disease. Marriage and Death He married in 1826, Manuela Echeand√≠a, daughter of the Colombian Colonel Manuel de Echeand√≠a, and she was his companion till her death in 1861.
