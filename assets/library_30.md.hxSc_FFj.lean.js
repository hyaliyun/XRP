The bill passed the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress, but it died in committee in the Senate. Background The TSA collected over $531,000 at airport checkpoints in 2012, an increase from $487,000 in 2011. John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York was the airport to keep the most loose change in 2010, collecting $46,918.06. The money is currently retained by the TSA for civil aviation security. The act would have directed the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security (Transportation Security Administration) to transfer annually, without further appropriation, unclaimed money recovered at airport security checkpoints to nonprofit organizations that operate multiple airport centers throughout the United States to provide a place of rest and recuperation for Armed Forces members and their families. No specific charity was identified by name, but only the United Service Organizations met the requirements. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Homeland Security on October 29, 2013. This is a public domain source. Under current law, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has authority to retain and spend, without annual appropriation, unclaimed money left at security checkpoints by air passengers for activities related to aviation security. According to TSA, airline passengers have left behind about $500,000 at airport security checkpoints in each of the past two fiscal years. Based on historical spending patterns, CBO expects that TSA will spend unclaimed checkpoint money gradually over the next several years. H.R. 1095 would have amended current law to require TSA to transfer unclaimed funds to nonprofit organizations that provide certain travel-related assistance to military personnel and their families. Requiring the agency to transfer such amounts to a nonfederal entity would accelerate the pace of spending relative to current law. However, because of the modest amount of money involved, CBO did not expect this change to have a significant net impact on the budget in any given year. For purposes of its estimates, CBO assumed that the requirement to transfer funds would apply only to amounts collected after the bill's enactment and that existing balances would remain available to TSA for aviation security. H.R. 1095 contained no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. Procedural history The TSA Loose Change Act was introduced on March 12, 2013 by Rep. Jeff Miller (R, FL-1). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Homeland Security and the United States House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Transportation Security. It was reported alongside House Report 113-274. On November 27, 2013, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced the H.R. 1095 would be considered on the House floor on December 3, 2013. The House voted on December 3, 2013 to pass the bill by a voice vote. Upon reaching the Senate on the same day, it was referred to the Commerce Committee, but no action was ever taken on it. Debate and discussion In the debate prior to passage in the House, the bill received the support of both Republicans and Democrats. Jeff Miller, the bill's sponsor, said that \\"the TSA has been keeping the pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters from your change purse to pay for their bloated bureaucracy\\" and raised the question of \\"If TSA representatives get to play 'finders keepers' with your hard-earned cash, what's the incentive to try to get the loose change to its rightful owners?\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *Transportation Security Administration *United Service Organizations References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 1095 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 1095 *GovTrack.us H.R. 1095 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 1095 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 1095 *House Republican Conference's legislative digest on H.R. 1095 *House Report 113-274 on H.R. 1095 Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress Transportation Security Administration ","title":"TSA Loose Change Act"},{"id":"41260406","text":"Jar (, also Romanized as Jār; also known as Jiyār and Jor) is a village in Keraj Rural District, in the Central District of Isfahan County, Isfahan Province, Iran.

Life and career Harriet Randolf Hyatt was born in Salem, Massachusetts in 1868, the daughter of Audella Beebe Hyatt and Alpheus Hyatt II, the noted paleontologist. After traveling abroad with her family at an early age she began to show artistic tendencies. She studied art and sculpture in Boston, Massachusetts under Henry H. Kitson and Dennis Bunker. She encouraged her sister, Anna Hyatt Huntington, to join her in sculpting; Anna would go on to become one of the leading sculptors of her generation. The 1893 World's Columbian Exposition featured a wide assortment of American sculptors, and Hyatt had one work, Head of Laughing Girl exhibited there.‘’Revisiting the White City: American Art at the 1893 World’s Fair’’, National Museum of American Art and National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution, Washington D.C., 1993, P. 367 She was awarded a silver medal at the 1895 Cotton States and International Exposition. She also exhibited her work in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, and Salon, Paris, 1908. Harriet was married in 1900 to the natural scientist Alfred Goldsborough Mayor, son of physicist Alfred M. Mayor. The couple had four children, A. Hyatt, Katharine, Brantz, and Barbara. In 1912, Mayor was suffering from a mild case of tuberculosis, and went abroad with her children. She barely escaped Germany before World War I began. After her husband's death in 1922, Mayor spent time traveling in Europe, and became active in the Daughters of the American Revolution, serving as regent of the Princeton, New Jersey chapter. The association contributed to her interest in genealogy, and she made studies of the Hyatt and Mayor family trees. She lived most of her later years in Princeton, only leaving to live with her sister Anna during her last year. She died at the Huntington estate in Bethel, Connecticut, on January 1, 1960 at the age of 92.

It was released on October 8, 2010, by Funk Volume, as the first single from Hopsin's second studio album, Raw. The song was produced by Hopsin himself and is considered Hopsin's breakout single, propelling him to stardom. Hopsin raps about subjects ranging from dissing mainstream rap artists including Drake, Lil Wayne, Soulja Boy, Lupe Fiasco, and Rick Ross, to discussing his anger towards his situation in the rap game, and dissing his former record label Ruthless Records and owner Tomica Wright. Background This song was conceived after the bitter falling out Hopsin had with his former record label Ruthless Records when in its prime was a multi-platinum record label but after the death of Eazy-E the label was in a steady decline. Hopsin and fellow rapper Stevie Stone were a part of the revival of Ruthless however due to the poor promotion of his debut album Gazing at the Moonlight and the lack of financial compensation for the album. This created bitter tension forcing Hopsin to fully invest in his independent label Funk Volume that he had originally conceived when he was 19 years old. Hopsin created a large buzz for Hopsin's second studio album and Funk Volume's debut release at the release of \\"Sag My Pants\\" going viral after its release and eventually receiving Gold Certification by the Recording Industry Association of America.

Caldwell, The Courthouse and the Depot: The Architecture of Hope in an Age of Despair, Mercer University Press, 2001, pp. 304-307. Early County's first courthouse was a log building, first used in 1827. That building was sold for $13 and moved, making way for the second courthouse. That two-story wooden structure was built in 1834. The county's third courthouse, a western-facing building, was built in 1857-58 by Thomas Williams for $4,650; it was sold for $155 to make way for the fourth and present courthouse, built in 1904-1905. The third courthouse was described by the Early County News as dangerously unsafe and dilapidated. The proposal to build a new court building \\"was tinted with a light wash of New South fervor and an outpouring of self-promotion.\\" The grand jury recommended a new courthouse, and a January 1905 piece by the Early County News praised an architectural rendering of the proposed design by the architects Thomas Henry Morgan and John Robert Dillon, as \\"the handsomest structure of its kind in Southern Georgia\\", which would \\"be in keeping with the wealth and prosperity of Early County--the Garden spot of Georgia.\\" Design The courthouse is two and half stories and is made of brick on the exterior, with marble floors in the main public spaces.Victoria Logue & Frank Logue, Touring the Backroads of North and South Georgia, p. 320. It is in the Neoclassical (Classical Revival) style and is surrounded by smaller buildings, grass, and trees, providing a recreational space and a center for community activities. The courthouse in designed a cross plan; each of the building's four facades is fronted with four rusticated Georgia columns of solid granite, which support the porticoes facing Courthouse Square.The New Georgia Guide, University of Georgia Press, p. 557 The courthouse has a low dome, of the Beaux-Arts style. On the courthouse square stands an original wooden Confederate flagpole, erected in 1861, which flies the Stars and Stripes; it was hewn from a long leaf pine harvested about a mile from the county seat. The flagpole is 100 feet tall and is believed to be the only original Confederate flagpole still standing. The courthouse square also contains a monument to the peanut, carved in stone atop a pedestal, commemorating the enduring importance of this cash crop to the region.

Entry into tertiary education   Undergraduate study  The traditional means of entry to tertiary education involves completing secondary school and obtaining the standard school leaving educational qualification offered in a particular region prior to progressing to university or other higher education study. In the United States, this qualification is the High School Diploma, or the General Education Development (GED) if high school was not completed. In the United Kingdom, this qualification would typically be the A-levels. These qualifications typically have an academic orientation. Alternative pathways, however, may feature non-standard academic or other qualifications. Certain qualifications may be jointly applicable to entry into vocational and academic post-secondary studies. The Edexcel Business and Technology Education Council (BTEC) suite of vocational qualifications are such an example, as these qualifications taken at the pre-university level (typically QCF Level 3) in appropriate subjects may also be used for entry into many universities in the United Kingdom, and are awarded points on the UCAS tariff system for application to university. BTEC qualifications included on the UCAS Tariff Tables include Certificates and Extended Certificates, Diplomas, Specialist qualifications, and Nationals. Purely vocational qualifications as well as skills development qualifications of sufficient difficulty and rigour may also be accepted or considered, instead of or in addition to standard academic qualifications, for entry into university. For admission into universities in the United Kingdom, the UCAS Tariff Tables awards points towards a number of vocational and skills development qualifications, including select qualifications from the Association of Accounting Technicians (AAT), Award Scheme Development and Accreditation Network (ASDAN), the British Horse Society, Council for Awards in Care, Health and Education (CACHE), Chartered Institute for Securities & Investment (CISI), City and Guilds, ifs School of Finance, Edexcel, Oxford, Cambridge and RSA Examinations (OCR), and certain educational institutions and examination boards of the performing arts. Those lacking traditional qualifications required for entry into university, or who were schooled in foreign systems of education whose academic qualifications do not align with or are not held to the same standard as the traditional qualifications of another region, may opt for alternative qualifications that give entry into the university system or even higher levels of study. The Access course, also known as the Access to Higher Education (HE) Diploma, is one such qualification. A Foundation programme, which typically runs for one year, is another such example. Certain academic programmes, particularly those that allow degree completion or recognize prior learning, do not permit students to directly enter tertiary study through their programmes without some prior recognised learning experiences, and these experiences serve as alternative entry requirements for admission. The undergraduate degree programmes of Western Governors University are one such example, requiring either prior study to associate degree level in the subject, over three years of work experiences in the field, and/or recently acquired or updated transferable IT certifications from which partial or full course module credit may be obtained.  Postgraduate study  Select universities additionally offer opportunities for alternative entry into postgraduate study, through completion of professional or alternative academic qualifications designed for prospective applicants lacking completed undergraduate study who might have otherwise qualified for their postgraduate academic programmes. The University of Leicester offers such opportunities, such as entry into the MSc in Management programme with a Professional Diploma in Management Alternative entry into postgraduate programmes may also be granted by partial completion of courses taken as part of the full postgraduate academic qualification. The IT Masters programme of Charles Sturt University offers such an option to working professionals with some years of experience in the fields of IT and management, allowing prospective students to first complete a Graduate Certificate in the chosen subject, which includes the first third of the course modules normally taken as part of the full master's degree, then proceed with full credit to the master's degree upon successful completion.  Open learning  Academic institutions of further or higher education may also have an open enrollment or open-door academic policy, whereby all students meeting minimum criteria for entry for a particular academic programme may directly enroll in that programme, subject to availability. Such open learning programmes of study may be offered at open universities, at community colleges, or at conventional institutions of higher learning at which such programmes have been developed.  Modular study  In a number of universities worldwide, academic degrees may be obtained in a modular format. The completion of different years or levels of education, or blocks of course modules studied together, may award a qualification in its own right, which may also count towards completion of another qualification. The Associate's degree or Foundation degree, as an example, is an academic qualification awarded on completion of approximately two years of full-time study or its equivalent, which also forms part of the study undertaken as part of a Bachelor's degree. In the United Kingdom, additionally, the different years or stage of study prior to the final year or stage of Bachelor's and Master's degrees may each culminate in the award of a separate academic qualification: Ordinary and Higher National Certificates after the first undergraduate year, Ordinary and Higher National Diplomas after the second undergraduate year, postgraduate certificates after the first stage of a master's degree, and postgraduate diplomas after the second stage of a master's degree. These intermediate qualifications, en route to a complete higher education qualification such as the Bachelor's, Master's, or PhD degree, may be earned through traditional means of study or by alternative pathways in education. Upon successful completion of the requirements for a lower level qualification, a higher level qualification may be completed; a full degree may be obtained through a \\"top-up\\" or transfer of credit programme, typically covering the final year or final two years of study for the degree. A higher level qualification may be obtained immediately after a lower qualification is earned, or even years afterward. A modular programme of study may be implemented in the form of awarding stackable credentials or qualifications in which lower qualifications, which are legitimate qualifications in their own right with vocational applicability, are awarded on completion of modules that are also part of the programme of study for higher qualifications. Harper College offers such a programme, offering students the opportunity to complete industry-endorsed certificate programmes in manufacturing technology, which may be used to directly work in the industry, to enter into more specialised programmes of study in the field, or as part of completing a full Associate of Science degree in the subject; the programme has additionally secured agreements with a number of companies to hire certificate programme graduates as paid interns, as they begin their careers or work towards a higher academic qualification. Each individual university reserves the right to decide whether its programs are modular in nature, or compatible with other modular programs or program components.  Distance learning  Distance learning allows a student to study for a degree away from the main campus. This study may take place at a satellite campus, at an external academic institution or training centre, in a work-based setting (as in work-based learning), through correspondence courses, online, or in a combination of these ways. Many traditional brick-and-mortar universities worldwide have distance learning and online options for study, and there are also institutions of further and higher education whose programmes are offered exclusively through online study, correspondence courses, or other forms of distance learning. Degrees offered by an academic institution may also be externally validated by another government-recognised, accredited, validated academic institution of further or higher education, and in that way a student may study for a qualification in another region or even in another part of the world. Bhaktivedanta College offers such degrees, externally validated by the University of Chester.  Credit by examination  Primary and secondary schools may offer the option for credit by examination, by which a student gains credit for select classes or exemption from certain requirements for graduation or progression onto more advanced grade levels through successful completion of an examination with a sufficiently high score to validate the student's knowledge of the subjects covered and readiness to progress forward onto the next level of study. In the US, Texas Tech University Independent School District (TTUISD) offers such a programme for elementary, middle, and high school students. Higher education institutions may also award academic credit or higher placement for acceptable scores or successful completion of certain relevant exams. Through this awarding of academic credit by examination, significant portions of a degree or even an entire degree can be completed by examination. In the US, depending on the college or university, credit may be given for such examinations as the Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), College Level Examination Program (CLEP), Advanced International Certificate of Education or A-levels, DANTES or DSST, UExcel exams of Excelsior College, Excelsior College Examination (ECE) Program, Charter Oak State College (COSC) Examination, Thomas Edison College Examination Program (TECEP), Ohio University End-of-Course (EOC) Examinations, New York University (NYU) Language Exams, Graduate Record Examination (GRE) Subject Tests, or various other comprehensive or proficiency exams as deemed appropriate by the college or university. Examination that results in the awarding of certain vocational or skill building qualifications for which academic credit may be obtained is another method through which credit by examination may be obtained. See also Microdegree.  Credit for vocational qualifications  Academic credit may be awarded by institutions of further and higher education for appropriate vocational qualifications of sufficient levels of difficulty and rigour comparable to the academic study that would have been completed in the relevant course modules of a traditional degree programme. Such vocational qualification may have been received as part of an apprenticeship, earned in a formal educational programme, or studied for independently. Oxford Brookes University in the United Kingdom, as an example, has a unique partnership with the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA), by which those who have successfully completed the Fundamental Skills papers F1 to F9 of the ACCA qualification as well as the Professional Ethics module may directly enter into the final research and analysis module of the BSc (Hons) Applied Accounting degree programme; upon successful submission of a Research and Analysis Project, students are then awarded the degree. Alternatively, students who complete papers F1 to F4 may directly enter into the second year, and students who complete papers F1 to F9 may directly enter into the third and final year, of the BSc (Hons) Accounting and Finance programme. ACCA members also have access to an accelerated route to completion of the Global MBA programme. Conversely, credit towards ACCA papers may be obtained for completion of modules as part of relevant Oxford Brookes Business School accounting and finance degree programmes. A number of universities in the United Kingdom offer top-up degree programmes that allow direct entry into the final stage of a Master of Business Administration (MBA) or Master of Management (MMgt) degree to students, upon completion of certain vocational and professional qualifications at the appropriate level of study (typically QCF Level 7) and in appropriate subjects, such as those by Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA), Society of Business Practitioners (SBP), Institute of Leadership and Management (ILM),University of South Wales MSc Leadership & Management Chartered Management Institute (CMI), Chartered Institute of Management Accountants, and Edexcel. The top-up degree is also available to those who have completed an appropriate level of postgraduate study, such as a postgraduate diploma in a relevant subject.  Credit for professional certifications  Academic credit may be awarded by institutions of further and higher education for appropriate industry and professional certifications of sufficient levels of difficulty and rigour comparable to the academic study that would have been completed in the relevant course modules of a traditional degree programme. The IT Masters programme of Charles Sturt University in Australia, as an example, offers academic credit and exemption from select otherwise compulsory industry elective courses, as part of its master's degree and graduate certificate programmes, for a number of professional certifications in the fields of information technology and project management. Additionally, students of undergraduate and select graduate degree programmes in information technology at Western Governors University may be awarded credit towards select course modules and competency requirements for a number of industry certifications in the field, including certain of those from Cisco, CIW, CompTIA, ISC2, Microsoft, Project Management Institute, Oracle, GIAC, and IBM.  Existing published and creative works  A typical research degree, such as the traditional PhD, requires possible coursework or examinations, followed by several years of research and study, culminating in the presentation of a final report, typically in the form of a dissertation or thesis, that is defended by a viva voce exam. A research degree may also be awarded by publication or existing published works, in recognition of already published research that is conducted on the level of research engaged in at the doctoral level of study. For such degree programmes, typically a portfolio of several works of research are submitted along with an overview of the publications or a supporting statement that ties the research together and demonstrates how the research makes an original and unique contribution to the academic literatures, in lieu of a traditional thesis or dissertation; it is this portfolio and overview or supporting statement that is evaluated with a viva voce exam. A degree in a creative field may likewise be awarded upon submission of a portfolio of relevant creative works. Such degrees are awarded by a number of universities in the United Kingdom. This route to earning the PhD was introduced in the UK in the mid-1960s. Some universities limit who may apply for such awards to those who have been connected to the university formally, such as graduates or alumni, faculty or staff, or those who have such connections with affiliated institutions of the university, while others permit anyone who is properly qualified, typically holding at least a good first degree, to apply.  Recognition of prior learning  Further and higher education institutions may also award credit by recognition of prior learning (RPL), also called prior learning assessment (PLA) or prior learning assessment and recognition (PLAR). For awarding of credit through this route, a portfolio reflecting transcripts or other evidence of relevant non-credit prior learning that is sufficiently difficult and rigorous to equate to degree level study is generally submitted for consideration. The American Council on Education (ACE) College Credit Recommendation Service (CREDIT), as an example, lists and accredits a number of forms of non-credit learning for equivalence in Continuing Education Units (CEUS) or academic credit at the university level; students who complete appropriate ACE CREDIT accredited activities, such as Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and other e-learning courses, professional development events, self-study programmes, industry and professional certifications and designations, and academic or professional examinations, may submit evidence of successful completion of these activities for inclusion on an ACE CREDIT transcript; this transcript can then be submitted to colleges and universities who accept ACE CREDIT for academic credit or placement.  Work based learning  Work based learning involves the awarding of academic credit for work experience, typically assessed by a portfolio of materials evidencing the learning accomplished at work as well as the success at work, along with possible live observation of the candidate at work. While work-based learning is used to earn many vocational qualifications, it may also be used to earn academic degree-level qualifications at some institutions. Degrees earned with work-based learning may be sponsored by companies. In the United Kingdom, a number of work-based learning programmes sponsored by businesses are available. KFC offers degree programmes in association with De Montfort University. KPMG and PwC also offer degree schemes for workers. John Lewis additionally offers vocational qualifications with academic qualification equivalency. McDonald's, one of the largest trainers in Great Britain, offers degree programmes in association with Manchester Metropolitan University and six other universities. In the US, McDonald's also offers courses through Hamburger University through which ACE CREDIT may be obtained.

As of 2011 the largest still-operating Chinatown in proximity to Metro Detroit is located in the Chinatown of Windsor, Ontario. History Ah Chee, the first known Chinese person in Detroit, arrived in 1872 and established a laundry business.Zia, p. 62. The first Chinese businesses were established in Metro Detroit in 1879, making the Chinese the Asian immigrant group with the longest history in the city. Many Chinese coming to Detroit after Ah Chee established laundry businesses. At one time Detroit had its own Chinatown. In 1892, several immigrants to Detroit were sentenced to hard labor for illegally entering the country but, in Wong Wing v. United States, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a jury trial was needed for such a punishment. During the period of Chinese Exclusion, many Chinese immigrants chose to enter the United States extra-legally. This was frequently done by taking the Canadian Pacific Railroad from Vancouver, British Columbia to Windsor, Ontario. From there immigrants could attempt to cross the Detroit river into the United States after contracting with smuggling organizations in the area. These crossings were often perilous, with numerous fatalities being reported during the time. In 1905 the first Chinese restaurant opened in Detroit. In the early 20th century Henry Ford recruited ethnic Chinese living in Hawaii to work at his automobile plants.Steele, Micki. \\"Asian-Americans settle in Metro Detroit enclaves.\\" The Detroit News.

Retrieved on December 3, 2013. \\"And Henry Ford recruited Chinese workers from Hawaii to work in his auto plants in the early 20th century, while others came later in the 1930s, and some started laundries.\\" In the 1920s Detroit had 300 Chinese laundry businesses and 12 Chinese restaurants. Helen Zia, author of Asian American Dreams: The Emergence of an American People, wrote that the Chinese business community in Detroit had its peak in the 1920s. More Chinese people moved to Detroit in the 1930s, but the Chinese business and the population of Detroit's Chinatown had begun to decline after the 1920s. Much of the Chinatown was demolished in the 1950s so the John C. Lodge Freeway could be built.Delicato and Demery, p. 28. As a result, Chinatown moved to an area in the southern Cass Corridor focused on the intersection of Cass Avenue and Peterboro Street.Delicato and Kahlil, p. 62. In 1951 about 2,000 Chinese lived in the Detroit city limits.Mayer, p. 11. \\"There are approximately 2,000 people of Chinese extraction living in the city of Detroit.\\" The more highly educated ethnic Chinese who moved to Detroit after the Immigration Act of 1965 moved to Detroit's suburbs, bypassing Detroit itself and its Chinatown. The previous generation of established laundry and restaurant owners had children who, instead of staying in the Chinatown area, tended to move outward to the suburbs of Metro Detroit, or to other cities for work and educational opportunities. Chinese American architect and engineer Marvin Chin opened the landmark tiki-themed restaurant nightclub Chin Tiki in 1967. The 1980 U.S. Census counted 1,213 ethnic Chinese in the City of Detroit. Zia wrote that the figure was \\"surely an undercount\\" but that the Chinese population in the City of Detroit \\"was unquestionably small.\\" The presence of family-owned businesses in the Detroit Chinatown area had declined by the 1980s. Zia wrote that by that decade, the \\"shrinking base\\" in the Detroit Chinatown \\"reflected the diminished role of the merchants.\\" In 1982, in Metro Detroit autoworkers killed Vincent Chin, a Chinese American mistaken for a Japanese American. An October 27, 2009 article by the Detroit Free Press stated that \\"It took the slaying of[...] Vincent Chin by a disgruntled autoworker in 1982 to awaken Detroit of the ugliness and danger of anti-Asian racism.\\"Darden and Thomas, page unstated (starts with \\"Dingell was not alone in the sentiment[...]\\") Cynthia Lee, a Chinese American from Hawaii who worked as a reporter for The Detroit News, interviewed Metro Detroit Chinese Americans who criticized the verdict given to the two men, who pleaded guilty and received probation and fines.

Davis is an American businessman. He served as the co-chief executive officer (CEO) and chairman for Energy Transfer Partners (ETP) and chairman of Energy Transfer Equity (ETE). He is co-owner and co-chairman of the Texas Rangers of Major League Baseball (MLB). Davis worked in the energy industry for forty years, until he retired as the CEO of ETP and ETE in 2007. He remained with the company as a director and operates Avatar Investments LP, a Dallas-based investment firm. In 2008, Davis made his first appearance on the Forbes 400 list, ranking 367th with a net worth of $1 billion. In 2012, he ranked 315th with a net worth of $1.5 billion, and he ranked 296th in 2013 with a net worth of $1.9 billion. When the Rangers were put up for sale in 2010, Davis joined a group headed by Chuck Greenberg and Nolan Ryan, which purchased the club. Davis and Bob R. Simpson provided the majority of the $593 million sale price. Davis and Simpson became co-chairmen of the Rangers, but remained mostly behind the scenes as senior consultants while allowing Greenberg and Ryan to operate the team as CEO and president, respectively. This arrangement continued after Greenberg left in 2011 and ceded his post as CEO to Ryan. Following Ryan's resignation from the Rangers in 2013, MLB approved the Rangers' request to have Davis replace Ryan as the team's control person, thus making him the primary person accountable to the commissioner's office for the team's operations. However, President of Baseball Operations and General Manager Jon Daniels serves as operating head of the franchise; Davis and Simpson have continued to stay in the background as senior consultants. Davis is a somewhat reclusive man who prefers to avoid the limelight. In 2010, he rebuffed an attempt by D Magazine to get a comment on his purchase of the Rangers, saying that he doesn't grant interviews.

Career Wardlaw was born in McComb in Pike County in southwestern Mississippi. He graduated with bachelor's and master's degrees from the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. He was briefly the municipal government reporter at the Meridian Star in Meridian in eastern Mississippi and a police reporter for the City News Bureau in Chicago. In March 1961, he joined the staff in New Orleans of the since defunct afternoon daily, The States-Item, for which he was over time a copy editor, assistant city editor, and political and judicial reporter. Wardlaw reported on the construction of the Louisiana Superdome and the sensational trial of Clay Shaw, a New Orleans businessman who was acquitted in what Orleans Parish District Attorney Jim Garrison had alleged to have been a conspiracy behind the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Wardlaw and fellow journalist Rosemary James, a native of South Carolina, co-authored Plot or Politics, a 1967 book which takes issue with the Garrison investigation. Wardlaw won an Associated Press award for his story on the death of David Ferrie, one of the mysterious figures of the Garrison investigation. Wardlaw was named States-Item capital bureau chief in 1979. In 1980, he assumed the same position for The Times-Picayune, a position which he held for the next twenty-two years. Wardlaw investigated all four terms of Governor Edwin W. Edwards. In the third nonconsecutive term in 1984 Edwards and his brother, Marion Edwards, were indicted on federal charges dealing with the licensure of hospitals and nursing homes. The Edwards brothers were acquitted in a second trial after a hung jury occurred in the first case. Though Edwards had often cited \\"that lyin' Jack Wardlaw\\" for Wardlaw's coverage and critical columns, upon Wardlaw's death, Edwards said, \\"He was a gentleman. As a journalist, he was very effective and very fair. He called things like he saw them.\\" Wardlaw also covered the 1973 Louisiana Constitutional Convention and the other governors of the era, Republicans David C. Treen, Buddy Roemer, and Murphy J. Foster, Jr. Wardlaw's colleagues included well-known state journalists Iris Kelso and Bill Lynch, who in 1988 was appointed by Governor Roemer as the first ever state inspector general.New Orleans Times-Picayune, February 16, 2004 Death and legacy Wardlaw died at his home in Baton Rouge at the age of seventy-four; survived by his second wife and four children. He had been retired for nearly a decade.

In our smoke-filled rooms, he had perfect journalistic vision. [Our] readers were the beneficiaries of his cogent analysis and clear writing. So were the many newspeople he mentored.\\" In 2002, Wardlaw received the Lifetime Achievement Award of the New Orleans Press Club. He was a former president of the Capital Correspondents Association, which stages the annual Gridiron Show in Baton Rouge, of which he was a cast member. Wardlaw was heavily involved in activities at the University Presbyterian Church in Baton Rouge, of which he was the \\"clerk of session.\\" In 2004, he was inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield, a year before Bill Lynch received the honor posthumously.

It was built as a complex of 12 bunkers between 1937 and 1938 as a Czechoslovak fort. However, the process of construction was stopped due to the Munich Agreement in 1938. Therefore, the fortress has never been finished.  Location  The Stachelberg fortress is located just northwest of Babí, between Trutnov and Žacléř. Moreover, there is Rýchorský prales (Virgin Forest) close to it. The place is frequently called the foot of the Krkonoše (Giant Mountains).  Purpose of its construction  The Stachelberg fortress was built as protection for Labavské sedlo (Saddleback), which is the land gate between the Krkonoše and Vraní hory. These places were usually a target of foreign armies and the Czech army led an attack on foreign armies from this place. However, the fortress has never been finished and nowadays it is used as an army museum.  Current situation  The museum in Stachelberg has been opened since 1993 and the owners expand the accessible parts of the fortress every year. The last extension was accomplished in 2010, which extended the sightseeing for more than an hour. The visitors can see the whole of its underground barracks. The first owner of this fortress was Fortis company, which is located in Trutnov. However, the owner changed in 2005 and presently it is owned by the Stachelberg Civic Association, a group of enthusiasts, who consider their job a hobby and do it voluntarily. It is worth mentioning that the fortress is financed only by the visitors’ entrance fee and occasionally by donors who are willing to help.  How to get there  There are a few options how to get there. Firstly, you can use a bus (from Trutnov to Žacléř). The final bus stop is called Babí-pevnost (Fortress) than you have to walk 300 m following the marked path. Secondly, you can use a car or a bike and use the road 300 from Trutnov to Žacléř. A car park can be found next to the bus stop (Babí-pevnost). The Stachelberg fortress is 10 km far from Trutnov and 5 km from Žacléř. Lastly, you can go on foot using tourist trails. There are many of them, but the most used is the one from Trutnov over Zámecký vrch or you can begin your journey from the other side, Pomezní boudy over Albeřice and Rýchory.

It occurs in the Eastern Atlantic from the British Isles (off the coast of Western Scotland and South-West England and Ireland) south to Madeira and the Canary Islands and into the western Mediterranean and the Black Sea. The specific name candolii honours the Swiss botanist Augustin Pyramus de Candolle (1778-1841) and has various spellings: candolii, candolei, candollei, and decandollii, but only the first one is correct. Some workers have found that L. candolii is not closely related to the other two species in the genus Lepadogaster and have proposed the placing of this species in the revived monotypic genus Mirbelia Canestrini, 1864, at least until more definitive taxonomic studies can be undertaken. L. candolii is considered a euryecious species, meaning that it has a broad variety of living conditions and habitats that it prefers. L. candolii most often inhabit small cavities in the underwater rock face, boulder fields, and seagrass meadows. L. candolii can reach up to 7.5 cm in length and shares many similarities with L. lepadogaster. Like the Lepadogaster other species, L. candolii has a flattened body and bilateral symmetry. Unlike L. lepadogaster that has a triangular shaped head, L. candolii has a more rounded head and rounded fins.

He showed promise as a two-year-old in 1979 when he won the last of his three races. In the following year he won the Prix de Guiche and finished second in the Prix du Jockey Club before recording his biggest success when dead-heating for the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud. His career was ended by injury shortly afterwards and he was retired to stud where he made little impact as a sire of winners. Background Shakapour was a grey horse with a broad white blaze and four white socks bred in Ireland by his owner Aga Khan IV. He was sired by Kalamoun who won the Poule d'Essai des Poulains, Prix Lupin and the Prix Jacques Le Marois in 1973 before becoming a successful breeding stallion. The best of his other runners were probably Kalaglow (King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes) and Bikala (Prix du Jockey Club). Shakapour's dam Shamim, who won one minor race as a two-year- old, went on to produce Shademah, the dam of The Derby winner Shahrastani. Shakapour was trained by the veteran François Mathet at Chantilly. Mathet had trained many of the best French racehorses of the 20th century including Tantieme, Relko and Reliance. Racing career 1979: two-year-old season Shakapour ran three times as a two-year-old in 1979. He finished third in the Prix de l'Yser over 1400 metres on his debut and then ran second in the Prix Mieuxce over 1600m. On his final appearance of the season he contested a maiden race over 1400m at Saint-Cloud Racecourse and won by a length from Rolling Star. In their annual Racehorses of 1979, the independent Timeform organisation said the colt had made a \\"favourable impression\\" and would stay \\"at least 1¼ miles\\". 1980: three-year-old season Shakapour began his second season in the Group Three Prix de Guiche over 1950m at Longchamp Racecourse on 20 April. Ridden by Yves Saint-Martin he started at odds of 3.7/1 and won by two lengths and a neck from Corvaro and Policeman. On 11 May the colt was moved up in class and distance for the Group Two Prix Hocquart over 2400m at the same course and finished fourth behind Mot d'Or, Providential and Belgio, beaten just over two lengths by the winner. On 8 June, Shakapour started at odds of 6/1 for the Prix du Jockey Club over 2400m at Chantilly Racecourse. Ridden as usual by Saint-Martin he moved into second place in the straight but was unable to make further progress and was beaten one and a half lengths by the 54/1 outsider Policeman. The beaten horses included Providential, Mot d'Or, Belgio, Argument and Dragon. Shakapour was then matched against older horses in the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud over 2500m on 6 July and started the 3/1 second favourite behind the four-year-old colt Scorpio, the winner of the Hardwicke Stakes. Shakapour, racing alongside the 1979 Pix de Diane winner Dunette, moved past Policeman to dispute the lead inside the final 200m. In the closing stages the colt and the filly moved clear of the field and crossed the line together in a race described by Timeform as \\"a fine spectacle\\". The judge declared a dead heat with the supporters of both horses having grounds to consider themselves unlucky: Saint-Martin had dropped his whip 200m from the finish, while George Doleuze on Dunette appeared guilty of premature celebration, raising his arm in triumph a stride before the line. Lancastrian finished third ahead of Policeman and Noble Saint. Shakapour was then aimed at the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe but was retired from racing following an injury. Assessment In 1979, Shakapour was rated 105 by Timeform, placing him twenty-four pounds below their top-rated two-year-old Monteverdi. In the following year he was rated 125 by Timeform, twelve pounds behind their Horse of the Year Moorestyle. In the official International Classification he was rated the fifth-best three-year-old in Europe behind Moorestyle, Argument, Known Fact and Nureyev, and was the joint-tenth best racehorse of any age. Stud record Shakapour was retired to become a breeding stallion in Europe before being exported to Japan where his last reported foals were born in 1992. The best of his offspring was the filly Khariyda who won the E. P. Taylor Stakes, Premio Lydia Tesio and Prix Fille de l'Air for the Aga Khan in 1987.

History It was probably founded in the late 15th or early 16th century. After the Ottoman Empire's conquest of the area, the monastery was temporarily abandoned in 1578. Bosnian Beylerbey Telli Hasan Pasha had the Rmanj Monastery renewed as a seat of his brother, Orthodox monk Gavrilo Predojević. In the early 17th century, it became the see of the Serbian Orthodox Metropolitanate of Dabar-Bosnia, and it remained in this capacity for about 110 years. After the monastery was burned down by the Turks in 1663, it was later rebuilt and reoccupied in 1737. It was burned down again during the Austro-Turkish War of 1787–1791. Ottoman authorities allowed the renovation of the monastery in 1863, and it was rebuilt in two years. It was badly damaged during the anti-Ottoman uprising in Bosnia in 1875 and 1876. Next year, Arthur Evans visited Rmanj (spelled as \\"Ermanja\\" by him), and in one of his letters, he described the damage inflicted on the monastery's church by troops under a Bosnian Muslim feudal lord. Once more, the monastery was repaired in 1883. In World War II, a field hospital of the Yugoslav Partisans was organised at the monastery. For this reason, it was bombed by the Germans and completely destroyed on 23 April 1944. In 1974, authorities of the Socialist Yugoslavia allowed the renovation of the monastery. Its church was completed in the 1980s, and the foundation of the monks' dormitory was consecrated in 1993. In 1995, during the Croatian Army's Operation Storm, the monastery was shelled and badly damaged. Afterwards, Croatian soldiers mined the monastery's church, but the mines were removed by British soldiers of the SFOR. The dormitory was completed in 2006, and in the following year, the monastery was inhabited by three monks. In 2007, the Rmanj Monastery was proclaimed a National Monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Its administrative center was in the city of Saratov. History On December 25, 1769, the Saratov province was established as part of the Astrakhan Governorate. On January 11, 1780, Empress Catherine the Great issued a decree of the establishment of the Saratov governorship of the northern districts of the Astrakhan Governorate to begin on November 7 of that year, followed by a decree on who will lead the new governorship. For the grand opening of the Saratov governorship, on February 3, 1781, the Astrakhan governor, along with lieutenant-general Jacobi and Bishop Anthony arrived from Astrakhan. On August 23, 1781 the Empress issued a decree approving the emblems of the city of Saratov and several Saratov governorship county-level cities (Atkarsk, Balashov, Kamyshin, Khvalynsk, Kuznetsk, Petrovsk, Serdobsk, Tsaritsyn, and Volsk). In 1796, 41 of the governorships which were created by Catherine II had been abolished by her son Emperor Paul I of Russia including a decree on December 12, 1796 to abolish the Saratov governorship, and have its uyezds distributed between Penza and Astrakhan province. Because of the decree of March 5, 1797 Penza province was renamed Saratov province and Saratov was appointed a provincial city. On October 11, 1797 from the Saratov governorate the governorates of Tambov, Nizhny Novgorod and Simbirsk were established, from the rest of the Saratov province decree dated September 9, 1801 the Penza Governorate was established. In 1802 Novokhopyorsky Uyezd was ceded to the Voronezh Governorate, and Chernoyarsky Uyezd was ceded to the Astrakhan governorate. In 1835 three new uyezds were created - Nikolayevsk, Novouzensk and Tsarevsky. In 1851 Tsarevsky Uyezd was transferred to the Astrakhan governorate, and Nicholas and Novouzensk Uyezd - to the newly created Samara Governorate. Because of the decree of July 5, 1878, the coat of arms of Saratov province was approved with the depiction of an azure shield, in which three silver starlet are placed in a forked cross. The shield is crowned by the imperial crown and surrounded by golden oak leaves emblazoned with St. Andrew's cross. In 1918, part of the governorate was incorporated into the newly formed autonomous region of the Volga Germans. In 1919, part of Kamyshinsky (returned in 1920) and Tsaritsynsky uyezds were transferred to the newly formed Tsaritsyn governorate. The structure of the governorate came from the province of Samara, Nicholas Uyezd and Novouzensk Uyezd. In 1920, due to downsizing Novouzensk Uyezd formed Dergachyovsky and Pokrovsk Uyezds. In 1921, due to downsizing Atkarsky Uyezd formed Yelansky Uyezd. In 1922 Pokrovsk Uyezd was transferred to the Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. In 1923, the Khvalynsky Uyezd was abolished, its territory is divided between Volsky Uyezd and Kuznetsky Uyezd. Dergachyovsky District was formed through consolidation of Novouzensk Uyezd and Elansky Uyezd with Atkarskaya Uyezd. In a Resolution of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee on May 21, 1928 Saratov Governorate was abolished and its territory was included in the Lower Volga Oblast, which was later turned into Saratov Krai and Saratov Oblast.

His family honored his life and celebrated by hosting a memorial ride day on December 6, 2013 at Glen Helen Raceway in Devore, California. SCORE International have announced that they have taken steps to improve safety at future races. In December 2013, the Kurt Caselli Foundation was established.  The Kurt Caselli Foundation  The Kurt Caselli Foundation was established in December 2013, using donations from the memorial ride day, with the help of fans, family and friends. The foundation's focus is the safety of riders and racers in the off-road motorcycling industry. While they understand the inherent elements of danger, they aim to help minimize it to the best of their ability. The foundation has a three-part mission that encompasses safety precautions for riders before, during, and after a racing career. # Before racing, they are committed to encouraging, developing, and standardizing safety precautions that will help minimize risk outside of the rider's control. # During racing, they are committed to developing, establishing, and encouraging the use of safety equipment and policies to increase the safety of the riders. # After racing, they are committed to providing a safety net that allows and encourages former racers to further their education and reach career goals for themselves and their families. The foundation is working with the medical community piloting motorcycle concussion studies, improving race course safety precautions, developing improved GPS systems while racing, and offering scholarship opportunities for post-racing careers.

Following the imposition of Martial law in 1981 Kopówka became member of the Independent Students' Union branch of Solidarity, the first non–communist workers union in Warsaw Pact history. In 1985–88 he served as founder, editor-in-chief and production manager for the unofficial Grzegorz Przemyk Publishing named after the young Polish poet murdered by the Communist Milicja Obywatelska. Kopówka supported himself financially by working as history teacher at elementary schools in Siedlce and its vicinity, and after the fall of communism, as clerk at the Office for Financial Control in 1993–96.

The Salt Pans are two salt pans on the Isle of Portland, Dorset, England. Both pans sit next to one another, and are situated on the coastline of East Weares, the east side of Portland. The pans sit directly below the Young Offenders Institution HM Prison Portland, and are found close to various old historic relics such as the East Weare Rifle Range, Folly Pier, King's Pier and the remains of the Folly Pier Waterworks. The East Weares area, including the Salt Pans, has been labelled a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), largely due to the scrub and wildlife being of high nature conservation value. History The southernmost salt pan seen close up. Situated along the eastern coastline of East Weares,http://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MDO19643&resourceID;=1012 the two salt pans have existed for many centuries. The origins of the pans remain uncertain, however the limited evidence recorded suggest they are likely to be medieval. During Saxon and Norman times the pans were one of two places for the thriving salt production industry on Portland. The other was the tidal lagoon known as The Mere, which was situated at the north of the island. The two pans at East Weares were formed by the digging of Kimmeridge clay. The pans would flood at high Spring Tides and once they dried out through the evaporation of the seawater, the encrusted salt would be removed from the rocks. Although the pans have remained unused for centuries, both remain completely intact and undisturbed. Access The salt pans can be reached via an unofficial pathway veering off the official coastal path of the East Weares area. A similar pathway further north links to the remains of the Folly Pier Waterworks. Sitting on the coastline, the pans link directly to the sea and thus can be reached via the coastline edge as well. The pans can also be viewed from the clifftops of Grove Point. References Image:Salt Pans, East Weares, Portland, Dorset 9.JPGThe southernmost salt pan seen up close.

Born into the Abenberg- Frensdorf nobility, Conrad was raised for a clerical career at the court of Emperor Henry IV, where he was a member of the court chapel. He became a canon in Hildesheim. After escorting Emperor Henry V in July 1110, Conrad sided with the Pope in the Investiture Controversy, which eventually led to his exile for several years. He returned to Salzburg in 1121 and played an important role in the major political events of the day, including the election of Lothair of Supplinburg as King of Germany in 1125 and the papal schism of 1130 in which he played a role in the recognition of Pope Innocent II by the king. During the absence of Lothair of Supplinburg in Italy, Conrad was ordained as the archbishop of Salzburg on 4 June 1133. As a prince-bishop, he was influential in German politics and was an extremely energetic reformer who is often called \\"the second founder of the Church of Salzburg.\\" He presided over an assembly that supervised the affairs of the religious houses, maintained strong control over tithes, and was responsible for building Salzburg Cathedral and the cemetery in 1140. Conrad also supervised the construction of numerous other monasteries and the castles of Hohensalzburg, Werfen, and Friesach. Early life and work Conrad of Abenberg came from the family of the Counts of Abenberg-Frensdorf, and had many distinguished relatives in Germany. He was born around 1075, son of Count Wolfram I von Abenberg. His mother was probably the daughter of Heinrich I, viscount of Regensburg. Conrad had two older brothers, Otto and Wolfram. He was raised for a clerical career at the court of the Emperor Henry IV, where he was a member of the court chapel. He became a canon in Hildesheim. Archbishop of Salzburg Military and political endeavors Conrad seems to have been involved when Henry V revolted against his father in 1105. This would explain his election as Archbishop of Salzburg at the Diet of Mainz on 7 January 1106. At that time the anti-Archbishop Berthold von Moosburg was installed in Salzburg. Conrad came to Salzburg accompanied by his brothers, the counts Otto and Wolfram, with an escort of 1,000 soldiers. Some of these soldiers may well have been servitors, servile rather than free vassals. With this display of force, he was able to force Berthold to abdicate. Pope Paschal II consecrated him as bishop on 21 October 1106 and gave him the pallium. In July 1110, Conrad accompanied Emperor Henry V to Italy. Conrad brought a strong military escort on this visit. However, Conrad sided with the Pope in the Investiture Controversy. Due to further conflicts with imperial officials, Conrad had to flee in 1112 and was not able to return to Salzburg until 1121. While in exile, he lived in Tuscany, Admont in Styria, and Saxony. Conrad played an important role in the major political events of the day, including the election of Lothair of Supplinburg as King of Germany in 1125, whom he supported during the fight against the Hohenstaufen usurpation. During the papal schism of 1130 he played a role in the recognition of Pope Innocent II by the king. After this, tensions rose between Conrad and Lothair due to diverging views on church politics. Lothair visited Italy in 1132-33, and was crowned emperor by Innocent II on 4 June 1133. In his absence, Conrad was ordained an archbishop. This directly infringed on the emperor's right, recently confirmed by the Pope, to invest a bishop with his regalia before he was ordained. It earned a stern rebuke from Lothair. When Lothair died, Conrad initially resisted the election of the Hohenstaufen Conrad III and supported Henry X, Duke of Bavaria instead. Conrad later came round to support the king. Reform and administration On his return from exile in 1121 or 1122, Conrad found his diocese \\"very poor and greatly devastated.\\" Conrad worked with notables such as Hartmann von Brixen and Gerhoh von Reichersberg to reform the clergy in his archdiocese. In particular, he undertook a major reform of the cathedral clergy. Conrad presided over an assembly that supervised the affairs of the religious houses, including the cathedral, and used the canons to help administer his possessions. He maintained strong control over tithes, allocating them between the monasteries and parish priests to avoid disputes over their distribution. During his administration, clerics of servile origin steadily gained in status, now called ministerialis rather than servitor. Between 1125 and 1130, he began minting coins at Friesach, which helped fund his projects. This served to revolutionise finance. In turn, he inspired the King of Hungary, Andrew II, to begin his own minting centres.Dimnik 2008, pp. 19 Conrad rebuilt and expanded Salzburg Cathedral and built the cathedral chapter house, and in 1140 he created the cathedral cemetery. He built hospitals for the poor of the city, and commenced construction of St. Peter's monastery where his former residence stood, moving to a new archbishop's residence nearer the cathedral. Conrad founded several monasteries and reformed others, a total of 17 in which the rule of the Augustinian Canons Regular prevailed. These included St. Zeno, Gurk, Reichersberg, Berchtesgaden, Baumburg, Gars am Inn, Au am Inn, Ranshofen, Höglwörth, Herrenchiemsee, Seckau and Suben. The archbishop supported the Benedictines. During his exile, Duke Henry III of Eppenstein, brother of Ulrich I, patriarch of Aquileia (r. 1086–1121), had seized property belonging to the Salzburg diocese in Friuli and Carinthia. Conrad excommunicated him and sent a force of 1,000 soldiers to Carinthia, forcing the duke to return the properties. Later, Conrad reached an agreement of \\"peace and friendship\\" (pax et amicitia) with the Patriarch Pellegrino I of Aquileia (r. 1130–1161) whereby he agreed to pay tithes to Aquileia for those properties which the archdiocese held in the patriarchate. Conrad's example was followed by pledges to pay their tithes from the others present when the agreement was reached. Conrad completed construction of the castles of Hohensalzburg, Werfen, and Friesach, which Archbishop Gebhard had started to build in 1077. In Styria, he reformed the military organization and administration of church properties, and built strong fortresses. For defense against Hungary, he built strongholds at Leibnitz (Seggau) and Pettau (Ptuj), and Brestanica castle. He also expanded the Burg Deutschlandsberg castle at the center of the Salzburg possessions in western Styria. In 1131, he made peace with King Béla II of Hungary, which was followed by a long period of stability in the border region. Conrad died on 9 April 1147 in Lungau, Salzburg. An anonymous biography, known as the Vita Chuonradi archiepiscopi Salisburgensis, was composed in the 1170s. It portrays Conrad as a man of peace. His role in the royal elections of 1125 and 1138 place him among the leading German Prince-bishops in the High Middle Ages. He earned the title of \\"second founder of the Salzburg church.\\" References Notes Citations Sources    1070s births 1147 deaths People from Salzburg 11th-century German people 12th-century German people Medieval German nobility Roman Catholic archbishops of Salzburg ","title":"Conrad I of Salzburg"},{"id":"41261643","text":"Miia-Maarit Niemi (born 9 July 1983) is a Finnish former footballer who played in the Norwegian Toppserien for Amazon Grimstad and Klepp IL, as well as HJK in her home country.

It is found in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean and in the Mediterranean Sea. Description Lepadogaster purpurea has a rather tadpole-like shape with a small body and a large flattened head with large mouth shaped like the bill of a duck-and a tentacle is positioned to the rear of each nostril. The pelvic fins are fused and, together with their surrounding tissue. they form a suction disc or sucker. They are variable in colour, having the ability to alter their colouration to blending with the substrate they are clinging to, but normally they show a pale background with a patterning of bars and spots which can vary between dark purple to reddish brown and green. On the nape there are two bright blue ocelli, or eyespots, which are thought to be defensive and to confuse predators. They grow to in standard length. Distribution Lepadogaster purpurea occurs in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean from the Shetland Islands south to the Canary Islands and Dakar in Senegal. It is also found in the Mediterranean Sea as far west as Cape Roux. Habitat and biology Lepadogaster purpurea just below and just above the low water market as deep as where it hides under boulders on rocky shorelines. It spends long periods in shelters, normally with a favoured shelter in this habitat. When it detects potential prey near its shelter, L. purpurea waits for it to move closer and then it swims out to take the prey returning to the shelter straight away to eat the prey. Taxonomy Lepadogaster purpurea is one of three species of Lepadogaster. L. purpurea was once synonymous with Lepadogaster zebrina, but has since been classified as its own species as L. zebrina has been discovered to be more synonymous with L. lepadogaster. This species of Lepadogaster is found normally off the western coast of Portugal. L. purpurea differs from other Lepadogaster species in that it behaves in a much more passive manner. For example, studies have shown that L. purpurea was less active in its habitat and spent more time inside its shelter rather than interacting with other fish and swimming around. L. purpurea also has different swim patterns in comparison to the other Lepadogaster species. L. purpurea generally swims at a much slower pace and doesn't make quick movements like the shore clingfish.

It was first released in Japan on January 23, 2002 via Tokuma and re-released by Underground Symphony worldwide on June 5. Track listing Background and production Holy Knight was formed in 1998; their first demo recording, Gate Through the Past was released in December 1999 to positive reviews. Having signed a record deal with Underground Symphony in April 2000, the band entered the Zenith Recording studio in Lucca in early November; the recording was finished on December 20. Music A Gate Through the Past's sound has been described as bombastic, with many compositions strongly influenced by neoclassical music, despite the fact that none of the band members had formal classical training. Elements of folk and baroque music are evident as well, contributing to the overall medieval atmosphere, while prominent orchestration and choirs add to the symphonic feel. The album was inspired by the fellow power metal bands Royal Hunt, Stratovarius and Rhapsody. When addressing the criticism of being a clone of the latter, the guitarist Danny Merthon and the drummer Claus Jorgen responded that they consider such comparison a compliment due to that band's artistic achievements. Furthermore, Merthon, the band's principle lyricist, stated to had been inspired by Thomas Malorys compilation Le Morte d'Arthur and the interplay between legends and reality. The album's main lyrical theme is a knight's quest, his dream and nightmare and the challenge of discerning good from evil.

Career Walter Devereux assumed a position in the retinue of Henry IV following the death of his father on 25 July 1402 at the Battle of Pilleth. On 13 December 1402 Sir Edmund Mortimer declared his rebellion against Henry IV, but Devereux stayed loyal to the king. He was probably present at the Battle of Shrewsbury on 21 July 1403, and subsequently was knighted.When Walter Devereux's lands were taken into the kings hand upon his death in 1419 he was referred to as \\"esquire.\\" Sir Walter Devereux was placed on a Commission of array for Herefordshire on 8 September 1403 to raise troops for the defense against the king’s enemies who have lately invaded the realm.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Henry IV, Volume II, 1401-1405. (London, Mackie and CO, 1905). Page 288, 8 Sep 1403 It is probable that Devereux was present when Henry IV faced off with a combined Welsh and French force in South Wales during the summer of 1405, but no major battle occurred and the English force had dispersed by October of that year. Devereux remained an important supporter of the efforts to suppress the rebellion in Wales as Prince Henry assumed responsibility for the fight. Walter Devereux would be among 14 men below the rank of baron who would be retained for life by Prince Henry (the future Henry V).Gwilym Dodd (editor). Henry V: New Interpretations. (Great Britain: CPI Group LTD, 2013). Page 51 In 1406 Welsh raiders damaged Lyonshall Castle in the heart of Devereux territory. Walter Devereux shared a claim on the castle with the family of his distant cousin John Devereux, 1st Baron Devereux. These claims could only be inherited through the male line, and would result in the castle finally passing to his son in the 1430s. When the daughter of John Devereux, Joan 3rd Baroness Devereux and Baroness Fitzwalter, died on 11 May 1409 she still possessed Lyonshall. On 24 May 1409 an order was issued to the escheator and sheriff of Herefordshire to take the castle into the king’s hands, and arrest ‘certain of the king’s lieges’ who had entered and held it with a strong hand to the contempt of the king. This is probably a reference to Walter Devereux trying to assert his claim. As described in Shakespeare's plays, there is suggestion that when Henry V assumed the throne on 20 March 1413, the new king did not favor the companions of his youth who had supported him in his struggles with the partisans of his father, Henry IV. This loss of favor may have contributed to the shift of the Devereux family into the retinue of the newly reinstated Earl of March, and ultimately into the affinity of the House of York. On 12 November 1414 John and Agnes Cheverell granted for 200 marks to Agnes Crophul, mother of Walter Devereux, and her heirs 1 messuage, 20 acres of land, 5 acres of meadow, and 7 acres of pasture in Whitchurch maund; the manor and rent of Whitchurch maund; 7 messuages, 1 toft, 243 acres of land, 26 acres of meadow, and 28 acres of wood in Bodenham, which encompassed all the land concessions of Walter Devereux’s ancestor, William Devereux of Bodenham, to Baron John Devereux.

Biography Neckelmann was born in Hamburg, Germany. He studied from 1874 in Vienna with Theophil Hansen. During his most productive years, Neckelmann worked as an associate with the German architect August Hartel. Neckelmann and Hartel designed many buildings together in Strasbourg including: * 1888–1892: National Theatre (built to house the legislative assembly of the German Imperial territory of Alsace-Lorraine, of which Strasbourg was the capital from 1871 to 1918) * 1889–1893: Church of Saint Pierre-le-Jeune catholique * 1889–1895: National and University Library Neckelmann and Hartel also designed the , and the Haus der Wirtschaft Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart (1889-1896) which is now a museum. When Hartel died in Strasbourg in 1890, Neckelmann was obliged to see through alone all the projects which they had conceived together. He went on to design the Strasbourg Palais de Justice (1894 - 1898) alone, but it was his last major project. In 1901 he ceased all professional activity for health reasons. He died during 1903 in Neckargemünd. Neckelmann had spent many years in Stuttgart. For many years he ran an architect's cabinet in Stuttgart, where the architect (1871-1957) once worked. He also taught architecture in Stuttgart. One of his pupils was (1872-1950). He was the author of a number of books, mostly on architecture, but also a book on Danish philosophers of the Renaissance (Denkmäler der Renaissance in Dänemark).

It is found in the Atlantic Ocean around the coasts of north west Europe. The presence of L. celtica and L. phalangium (its counterpart in the Mediterranean) is considered to be a good indication of nearby shelf breaks, general bottom currents, and areas of high gross productivity as they are suspension-feeders, hence their proliferation in productive environments. Description Leptometra celtica has ten pinnate arms that are typically 7–10 cm in length with neatly held side branches. The arms may be banded in red and white or plain coloured in brown, white or red. In areas of moderate current, specimens have been observed to spread their arms out into a vertical fan across the current.Encyclopedia of Marine Life of Britain and Ireland. Retrieved 2013-12-03. The cirri of L. celtica are about 34–40 mm in length and vary in color from green to white. They are arranged in irregular columns dimorphically about the organism's stalk allowing for locomotion and attachment to deep sea structures. Examination of cirri can help distinguish L. celtica from the related L. phalangium as the cirri of L. celtica are shorter in proportion and are not evenly tapered distally. The distal segments of the cirri have their distal edge slightly swollen so that the organism's dorsal profile retains a slightly scalloped appearance in comparison to L. phalangium. L. celtica has short proximal oral pinnule segments protruding from its stalk to allow for feeding. Its oral pinnules are arranged in irregular columns are somewhat shorter in length in comparison to L. phalangium. The four lowest pinnules average between 12–17 mm. The opening of the centrodorsal cavity in L. celtica is only 0.35 of the centrodorsal diameter, making it similar to that of other species of antedonids. Distribution and habitat L. celtica can be found in the Atlantic Ocean ranging from the coasts of the United Kingdom and Faroe Islands to the Moroccan coast. The species has been found at depths between 20 and 1247 m in the western Mediterranean and has been studied in the Algarve region on the southwest coast of Portugal. L. celtica has also been studied along shelf breaks ranging from northwest Spain to the southwest coasts of Ireland. The species can be typically found in sandy to muddy sand types of sediment. Ecology L. celtica are suspension feeders that take in organic particles that fall from the photic zone. Shelf-break upwelling and water turbulence increases the transportation of organic matter up the water column, leading to high-concentrations of crinoids like L. celtica that feed on organic matter around these shelf breaks. The species plays an important role in marine environments by taking in large amounts of organic particles and regulating food chain production. For this reason, the presence of benthopelagic fish alongside crinoids like L. celtica can serve as indicators of highly productive regions of shelf-breaks.  Human impact  Several studies have focused on the impact of bottom trawling and dredging on crinoid communities along the coast. L. celtica has been found in crinoid beds with a high abundance of juvenile commercial fish and crustacea, and research has shown that heavily towed benthic environments have much lower numbers of crinoid taxa like L. celtica.

A supporter of the Liberal Party he represented Aberaeron as a county councillor for over thirty years and served on many other public bodies. Shortly after his election as a county councillor in 1889, Howell married Ann Evans at the Tabernacle Calvinistic Methodist Church, Aberaeron. Howell was a prominent figure at Tabernacle, became its precentor in 1874, and was also superintendent of the Sunday school from a young age. It was said that he was the mainstay of the musical festivals, or cymanfaoedd held in the district. Howell was a prominent businessman and operated a flourishing ironmongery business at Portland House, Aberaeron. He served as a director of the Lampeter and Aberayron Railway which opened in 1911. In many ways he represented the urban, commercial, middle class, who became a powerful new force within society in Cardiganshire during the 1880s. J.M. Howell was associated with the radical wing of the Liberal Party in Cardiganshire and a keen supporter of policies such as land reform and disestablishment. His submission to the 1894 Enquiry into the Land Question in Wales reflects his outlook. 'There is a spirit of vassalage among the tillers of the soil', according to his evidence, 'begotten by the tyranny of the past. The shadows of the oppression and evictions of 1868 have not lifted from among the people'. This was a reference to the general election of 1868 in Wales, which had been characterised by allegations of coercion by landowners at what proved to be the last election before the introduction of the ballot. However, recent historians have questioned the traditional version and claimed that there were also examples of coercion by nonconformist ministers. Elected to the Cardiganshire County Council at the first elections in 1889, Howell became chairman of the Council in 1895-6 and was made an alderman in 1898. Having served as a county councillor for thirty years the veteran Howell became embroiled in the infighting within the Liberal Association between supporters of Lloyd George and Asquith after the First World War. He presided at a meeting addressed by Asquith at Aberystwyth in 1919 and was invited to stand as an Asquithian Liberal candidate in 1921 when Lloyd George engineered a peerage for Vaughan Davies to allow his supporter Ernest Evans to contest the seat. Howell, however, refused, and announced that he supported Lloyd George. He regularly wrote articles for there Welsh language press on political and literary subjects and was also a keen amateur poet.

Luna Ring is a speculative engineering project which consists in a series of solar generators, disposed around the equator of the Moon, that could send the generated electric energy back to the Earth via microwaves from the near side of the Moon. The project was proposed by Japanese construction firm Shimizu Corporation, after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami destroyed the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, creating public opposition against nuclear electric energy. Until then, Japan had relied heavily on nuclear power.  Construction  The construction of a concrete ring on the Moon's equator to support the solar panels would be performed by robots, that would be teleguided back from Earth. Then, the solar panels would be placed on the concrete layer, and connected to microwave and laser transmitting stations. The energy sent to Earth that way could be captured by receiving stations all through the day. The fact that the ring would surround the entire moon would mean that at least half of it would always be lit by the sun, resulting in constant electric production. In 2013, Shimizu Corporation stated that the construction of the Luna Ring could start as early as 2035. However, the practical drawbacks of putting such a technically vast and complex project into place could hamper its construction, even if it could pave the way for simpler projects in clean energy production.

Life He was born in Carrollton, Georgia in 1906 the youngest child of Joseph and Margaret Harris. His father owned Harris Hardware on the square in Carrollton. He graduated from Georgia Tech in 1928 with a B.S. in architecture. In 1930, he enrolled at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. After the first year of study, he was granted by the Academy a full scholarship for the remaining three years. He graduated in 1934 and returned to Atlanta Georgia. He was licensed by the State of Georgia as an architect and worked briefly for architect Philip Schutze. That same year, he opened his sculpture studio and by the close of his first year was sculpting full-time. He worked as a sculptor based in Atlanta until his death in 1987. During World War II, Harris served as a Major in the United States Army during the India- Burma Theatre. At Georgia Tech, he did ten busts of famous engineers and scientists, the bronze gate of the Naval Armory, and the stained glass window in Brittain Dining Hall. He also taught architecture part-time in the College of Architecture for 34 years. He worked alongside the architectural firm of Tucker & Howell on various projects and sculpted a frieze at Georgia State Prison depicting figures embodying various trades and occupations. Other collaborations with architectural firms in Atlanta include the Morris Plan Bank (1936, razed), zoo buildings (1950s), the Department of Agriculture Building (1954), the Commerce Building (1959), and the DeKalb County Federal Savings and Loan Building (1963) in Conyers, Georgia. He was elected into the National Academy of Design in 1976 as an Associate member and became a full Academician in 1979.

It was granted on 1 September 1965. The red field on the shield is from the arms of the Municipal Borough of Willesden, the green field is from those of Municipal Borough of Wembley. They are divided by a wavy chevron, standing for the River Brent, which divided the two but now unites them and has given the borough its name. The orb and the crossed swords are from the arms of Willesden; the orb represents King Athelstan, who granted the Manors of Neasden-cum-Willesden to the Monastery of St. Arkenwold in the 10th Century, while the swords represent the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's, who were the owners of the Manor of Willesden at the time of Domesday. The crossed seaxes and Saxon crown in the lower field, corresponding to the old arms of Wembley, are derived from the arms of the Middlesex County Council. The crest was combined of those of the two merged Boroughs. The gold lion in the Saxon Crown is the lion of England, which also was present in the arms of Wembley, and it is charged with a red cinquefoil, from the arms of Willesden, ultimately from the arms of All Souls College, Oxford, which owns land in the area. The supporters are also taken one from each of the arms of the former Boroughs, the lion from Wembley and the dragon from Willesden. The gold lion comes from the arms of John Lyon, founder of a trust for the maintenance of Harrow and Edgware Roads, which partly lie within the Borough. The green flag held by the lion bears gold scales, which indicate that the Hundred Moot (court of law) of Gore was held at Wembley. The Willesden arms were supported by two blue dragons.

Max Brand worked on the screenplay and published a novelisation under his own name. Plot Young J. Quincy Pennant is a brilliant but absent-minded scientist who is experimenting with an explosive method which directs a shock wave past obstructions to impact a distant target. He is sent to a rapidly growing \\"powder town\\" being developed around an arsenal and munitions factory where population growth has attracted criminals, foreign spies and saboteurs. Pennant is placed in a boarding house where he is the only male sharing with five female entertainers who work at a local casino run by gangsters. The rambuctious and physically imposing Jeems O'Shea, head of the powder monkeys at the factory, and his sycophant Billy arrive at the house. O'Shea plays rough with the ladies, chasing them around the boarding house and playfully molesting them. Pennant gives O'Shea a casual punch, putting him off-balance and tumbling down the stairwell—knocking him out cold, to everyone's amazement. When Pennant reports to the factory, he formally meets O'Shea who at first is surprised that Pennant is not the giant he thought he was. He attempts to intimidate Pennant who is too absent-minded to understand the threats. O'Shea perceives this as nonchalant courage, a highly respected quality among munitions workers. As Pennant develops his shock-wave explosive concept, he is given his own pistol and assigned O'Shea as a bodyguard. Pennant falls in love with Sally Dean who also lives at the boarding house. Unknown to him, she has been paid by the gangster boss, Oliver Lindsay, to steal the explosive formula. Things come to a head when O'Shea takes the naive Pennant out for a night on the town. The muddleheaded scientist is oblivious to several assassination and abduction attempts by enemy agents. O'Shea takes this as a display of coolness. Pennant is introduced to his first alcoholic drink, after which he breaks the bank at the casino, winning $900 and the admiration of all the women. The gangsters start a brawl in order to attack Pennant and retrieve their money but O'Shea demolishes both them and the casino. Dr Wayne, who runs the munitions factory, threatens to fire Pennant when he finds out that Pennant has been gambling and involved with the \\"gay\\" women at the casino but Pennant insists he wants to at least continue to see Sally, to whom he has given the secret formula to for safe-keeping. During this time the enemy agents as well as Lindsay continue efforts to obtain Pennant's formula. The gangsters go looking for Pennant at the factory but find O'Shea in the way. They attempt to blow up the factory and set a 5-minute timer with explosives on a cart inside the dynamite room after they bind O'Shea and Pennant. They flee on the arrival of Dr Wayne, the guards and the girls. O'Shea and Pennant are released in time to push the explosives cart down the hill, where it collides with and destroys the getaway car. The two heroes then return to Dr Wayne and the girls who embrace their men, and the movie ends with them kissing. Dr Wayne is shown the coded formula written on a wall in the office of the factory.

Stuart Blackton and Albert E. Smith, the Anglo-American founders of Vitagraph Studios. The film is considered lost. Albert E. Smith claimed in his 1952 book Two reels and a crank: \\"I used my little daughter's set of wooden circus performers and animals, whose movable joints enabled us to place them in balanced positions. It was a tedious process inasmuch as the movement could be achieved only by photographing separately each change of position. I suggested we obtain a patent on the process; Blackton felt it wasn't important enough. However, others quickly borrowed the technique, improving on it greatly.\\" The Moving Picture World - Volume 3 reviewed the 885 feet short in 1908: \\"It opens with a crowd of children leaving school and marching through the streets to the \\"Humpty Dumpty Circus.\\" We see them crowd into the tent and at the end of each act they vociferously applaud the performers These are the little wooden toys that are familiar to all, and which are made to perform all the usual acrobatic stunts of the circus performer in a remarkably realistic manner. Some of the scenes are really comical and it is hard to believe that the elephants and donkeys are not alive.\\" Followed by an explanation of how the photographer worked for several months on the negative. Cinematographer F. Dobson was said to be \\"an adept at this kind of work\\".https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hb0sep&view;=1up&seq;=185 The used toy set was most likely the popular Humpty Dumpty Circus produced by Schoenhut Piano Company between 1903 and 1930.

Her book, The Shaman In Stilettos, chronicles her journey from celebrity interviewer, to apprentice to a Peruvian shaman in the High Andes, to becoming a London-based shaman in her own right.  Early life  Hunt was born into a small family in a village outside Southampton, England, and went to school at Cheltenham Ladies’ College. She read History at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, where she was awarded an MA.  Journalism  Hunt started her journalism career making television documentaries for the UK’s Channel 4, before moving into newspapers. She began as PA to the editor of The Daily Express and was promoted to launch editor of a weekend supplement that added one million readers to the paper’s circulation. Hunt left to establish herself as a celebrity interviewer, writing for The Daily Mail, The Mail On Sunday, The Independent On Sunday, The Sunday Express and the BBC’s Radio Times. By age 27, she was working full-time as features editor of The Mail On Sunday’s 'Night & Day' magazine, the highest-selling quality newspaper supplement in the UK.  Peru and Shamanism  Stress-induced health challenges that she says allopathic medicine couldn’t cure led Hunt to take a three-month sabbatical to Peru in 2003. There she met the shaman Maximo Morales, a former archeologist turned medicine man. Despite Hunt’s initial cynicism, Morales appeared to restore her health with a range of techniques that included the use of the entheogenic plants San Pedro and ayahuasca. The work was transformative for Hunt, and Morales invited her to study with him as his apprentice – an extraordinary invitation, as the ancient healing arts are traditionally passed down only from shaman to shaman, orally and in strict secrecy. Two years later, Hunt returned to Peru to accept the offer. She spent six months studying with Morales and interviewing over forty shamans, travelling from the high Andes to the depths of the Amazon rainforest. She then returned to London to practise independently. In 2012, Penguin published an account of her experiences, The Shaman In Stilettos, which the Daily Mail described as \\"the English Eat Pray Love\\".

Biography  Popović was born in Skopje, North Macedonia, on August 16, 2000. At the time she performed in the Junior Eurovision 2013 final, Popović was 13, but already an experienced artist, famous in her country. She was especially noted for her participation in the Macedonian children's music festival Super Zvezda (\\"Super Star\\"). She performed at the festival for the first time at the age of six, and continued yearly until she was ten. She had collaborated with many famous Macedonian artists, who composed for her, including Kaliopi, Jovan Jovanov, Darko Dimitrov, and Elena Risteska. Kaliopi was the one who wrote one of the songs she was most known for, \\"Bongiorno\\" (\\"Бонџорно\\"). Also, since the same age of six Popović had been studying piano in a music school, her piano teacher reportedly being \\"Macedonia’s most famous piano professor\\".  Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2013  Popović and her team at rehearsal for Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2013 In 2013, Macedonian Radio Television (MRT) decided to return to the Junior Eurovision after a two-year gap. Barbara Popović was chosen by the organizer, i.e. MRT, at an internal audition, there was no public selection process. The song she performed at the Junior Eurovision contest was called \\"Ohrid i Muzika\\" (\\"Ohrid and Music\\"). It was written by Popović herself, with composer Kire Kostov helping with music and arrangement and Ognem Nedelkovski helping with lyrics. The song was inspired by an excursion trip to the ancient Macedonian town of Ohrid. As Popović revealed, the lyrics were dedicated to a boy from the Netherlands, and the song narrated the story of the \\"awakening of first love in her teenage heart\\". The lyrics went like this: \\"I speak not a single word of Dutch, but your eyes are so warm... In my homeland everybody sings and dances. Don't be silly, join us. Give me your hand, you will love this music more than love!... With this song I'm crossing borders in an instant.\\" On stage, Popović was accompanied by their dancers from the dance studio Eureka. One of them (the blond girl) was Sara Kastratović, 13-year-old daughter of Zoran and Indira Kastratović, coaches of the women's handball team Vardar SCBT, who didn't even think to follow up her parents' profession and pursues her passion for hip hop. According to Rede Spasovski, the chief of the Macedonian delegation, the initial reaction to Popović's rehearsals was positive. Despite the positive expectations, in the final Macedonia placed last out of the 12 countries, with 19 points (12 of which are given to all participants at the start of the voting regardless of how well they did). Moldova, who took the penultimate place, received 41 points. The result was dubbed \\"catastrophic\\". It was reported that Macedonian Radio Television (MRT) was \\"seriously considering\\" to withdraw from the contest in the future. Macedonian artistic director of the Junior Eurovision Ljupcho Mirkovski defended the internal decision to send Popović without holding a national selection, saying that Popović was musically talented, and attributed her bad performance to stage fright. \\"Internal choice may not be the best solution, but this year we joined the dance a little bit too late, so there was no better solution that this. Barbara is a musical child and certainly could sing better, but stage fright has done its job. Not all children are immune to public performance,\\" said he in an interview. He also stated that he didn't find it strange that the countries of the former Soviet Union didn't help Popović to place higher because in a song contest songs matter more than relationship between countries. As for the states of the former Yugoslavia, Macedonia was the only former Yugoslav republic competing that year.  2018: Comeback  She returned to the stage at the 2018 Makfest festival, introducing a new song titled \\"Ne si ti kriv\\" (\\"It’s Not Your Fault\\").

Near Antarctica the star is circumpolar, while it is always below the horizon near the Arctic. Its magnitude of 5.9 places it at the limit of visibility to the naked eye, so observing this star with the naked eye is possible a clear sky and no moon. The best time to this star in the evening sky falls in the months between September and February, and from both hemispheres of the period of visibility remains approximately the same, thanks to the star's position not far from the celestial equator. The star is a red giant with an absolute magnitude of 2.14, and its radial velocity indicates that the star is moving away from the solar system. Planetary system In 2013 a double planetary system was detected orbiting around this star from radial velocity measurements at Okayama Astrophysical Observatory and Australian Astronomical Observatory. The planetary system has two giant planets with identical minimum masses of 2.4 times that of Jupiter with orbital periods of 360 days and 2732 days. The maximum mass of the planets cannot exceed 28 times that of Jupiter based on dynamical stability analysis for the system, if the planets are coplanar and prograde.

The site is clearly visible as earthworks on aerial photographs.  Associated Turrets  Turret 45A Each milecastle on Hadrian's Wall had two associated turret structures. These turrets were positioned approximately one-third and two-thirds of a Roman mile to the west of the Milecastle, and would probably have been manned by part of the milecastle's garrison. The turrets associated with Milecastle 45 are known as Turret 45A and Turret 45B. Turret 45A Turret 45A (Walltown) () is located east of the normal measured position, and measures by externally. It was excavated in 1883, 1912, and 1959.TURRET 45A, Pastscape, retrieved 3 December 2013 The 1959 excavations uncovered two centurial stones to the west of the turret. The turret walls were consolidated and stand to an average height of 1 metre. The turret was constructed without wing walls, with the curtain wall abutting the structure, rather than being bonded with it. Because of this, It is believed that the turret was originally a freestanding structure, predating the wall, and probably built as part of a system of watchtowers associated with the Stanegate.

Wolfer was a huge fan of horror and comics as a child, and after high school he attended The Kubert School for two years. He started his career in 1987 by forming his own publishing company, Ground Zero Comics, and self-published \\"Daikazu\\" (8 issues) and \\"Daikazu Vs. Gugoron\\" (3 issues). In 1992, Wolfer began publishing \\"Widow,\\" an erotic horror title which ran a total of 14 issues, through various mini- series: \\"Widow: Flesh And Blood,\\" \\"Widow: Kill Me Again,\\" \\"Widow: Metal Gypsies,\\" and \\"Widow: Bound By Blood.\\" Simultaneously, Wolfer began freelancing with other companies such as Dark Horse Comics (\\"Dark Horse Presents,\\" \\"Godzilla\\"), London Night Studios (\\"Razor\\"), Chaos! Comics (\\"Lady Death Swimsuit/Lingerie\\"), Revisionary Press, and others. As they formed their initial line-up of comics in 1996, new publisher Avatar Press incorporated \\"Widow\\" into their line-up and began reprinting the old Ground Zero Comics work as \\"Widow X,\\" while also publishing new Widow material. Wolfer soon began writing and illustrating many of Avatar's most popular titles, collaborating with many renowned writers including Warren Ellis, Garth Ennis and Alan Moore. He has worked on horror titles such as \\"Night of the Living Dead,\\" \\"Friday the 13th,\\" and \\"Escape of the Living Dead.\\" His work on supernatural tales continued with his writing credits on Warren Ellis' many \\"Gravel\\" comics, and Garth Ennis' \\"Stitched,\\" both of which he also illustrated. Wolfer assumed scripting \\"Stitched\\" in September 2012, writing issues #8-19, which were illustrated by Fernando Furukawa. In 2013, he illustrated the four-issue \\"Skin Trade,\\" the comic adaptation of the George R.R. Martin werewolf epic. He has also worked for Avatar's sister company, Boundless Comics, where he wrote both Brian Pulido's \\"Lady Death\\" and \\"War Goddess.\\" \\"Lady Death\\" was nominated for \\"Sexist Or Racist Or Homophobic Comic Of The Year\\" at the 2011 C2E2 Bleeding Cool Awards, but because of his conviction to honor both the character and her creator (Brian Pulido), Wolfer went on record, stating that he viewed the Awards nomination as a joke which only generated more recognition for the property, and that anyone who had actually READ the book would know that it was the polar opposite of \\"sexist.\\" right In May 2014, Wolfer launched a very successful Kickstarter campaign to fund the production of a new self-published graphic novel, \\"The Curse Of Ragdoll.\\" The 96-page story had originally seen print in Avatar Press' adults-only title \\"Raw Media Quarterly.\\" Wolfer wanted to bring the lush, Gothic horror story back to life and make it accessible to a wider audience, so he excised all of the x-rated material and replaced it with new panels, completely rewrote the story, and inserted 17 new pages of material. A Kickstarter campaign to fund the sequel, \\"Ragdoll: Orgy Of The Vampires,\\" is scheduled for early 2015. In July 2016, Wolfer began writing an authorized comic book sequel The Land That Time Forgot. The book was drawn by Giancarlo Caracuzzo and published by American Mythology Productions.(April 13, 2016), \\"Once More Into The Land That Time Forgot,\\" Bleeding Cool. Retrieved August 5, 2016 In the first issue, Wolfer says the publisher approached him to write it because they had heard he was a big fan of the novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs.The Land That Time Forgot #1 (July 2016).

The protests eventually came to focus on the Carolina Theater. In March 1962, the theater's manager rejected a proposal from the local NAACP chapter to negotiate its desegregation and later refused the city council's request that it reconsider the decision. In response, the protesters began \\"round-robin\\" demonstrations. After a court order ended those demonstrations, activists took their case to the courts.

Accessed December 1, 2013.  Movie Going and discrimination   Discrimination  At the beginning of the 1960s, some theaters in North Carolina only allowed white Americans, while others segregated white and black Americans by assigning them into different sections in the theater. In certain theaters, owners and managers differentiated tickets with stamps or hired ushers in order to guarantee that black Americans be seated only in top balconies, called “Buzzard’s Roosts”.Regester, Charlene, ed. Film History. Indiana University Press, 2005. s.v. \\"From the Buzzard's Roost: Black Movie- Going in Durham and Other North Caroline Cities during Early Period of American Cinema.\\" In other cases, black Americans were forced to enter from a separate entrance or be restricted to late showings called 'midnight rambles'.Richard Maltby, Melvyn Stokes, and Robert C. Allen,Going to the Movies: Hollywood and the Social Experience of Cinema, (Exeter: University of Exeter Press, 2007), chap. 1. To take advantage of a new prosperous section of the Black population, entrepreneur Frederick King Watkins opened a number of black-only theaters. These seldom screened the latest Hollywood films, and often alternated films with all-black casts with western films.\\"Carolina Theater Controversy Now Strictly a Legal Fight.\\" The Carolina Times, April 7, 1962.  Segregation on Public Lands  A court ruling in Greensboro, North Carolina, concerning a privately owned golf course operating on leased public property upheld that African Americans had a right to be on public lands despite ownership. The verdict was that segregation could not be maintained indirectly: the golf course remained public property despite the business being privately owned. The Carolina Theater, established in 1926, was in 1961 privately owned by Charles Abercrombie, but the building, the Durham Auditorium, was leased for $10,000 a year. The similarities between the two situations provided a legal base upon which protestation against the desegregation of the municipally-owned Carolina theaters rested.\\"Carolina Theater Controversy Now Strictly a Legal Fight.\\" The Carolina Times, April 7, 1962.\\"Golf Case May Bring Attack On JC in Durham Theater.\\" The Carolina Times, December 17, 1955.  Petitions and Mass Movements  On November 2, 1960 the Carolina Theater case was brought before the City Council. The NAACP petitioned for the integration of the Carolina Theater, among many other racial reforms. The City Council relegated the petition to the Mayor’s Human Resource Committee. In January 1961, the NAACP issued a letter voicing its complaint about the segregation in theaters to the committee on Human Relations, City manager George Aull, and manager of the Carolina Theater Milo Crawford. In the letter, protestors stated their discontent with the “illegal” and “morally unjustified” policies of the theater. The NAACP acquired the signatures of students from nine different high schools and colleges: Duke University, North Carolina College, Durham High School, Henderson of Hills High School, Merrick-Moore High School, Whitted Junior High School, Deshazor’s Beauty College, Bull City Barber College, and Durham Business College. On January 21, in front of the Center and Carolina Theaters, faculty and students from the all-black North Carolina College and Duke University joined together to stage a protest. They locked arms to block the entrance to the theater, forcing their way into the entrance, and staging sit-ins.\\"Demonstration Against Movie Houses Begin.\\" Campus Echo, January 27, 1961. The new manager of the Carolina Theater, Charles Abercrombie, was persistent in his refusal to discuss the segregation issue, stating that “the question of whether or not to desegregate had been accepted by the Commission as a foregone conclusion”.\\"Chapel Hill Movies Open to All; Durham Theatre Won't Negotiate.\\" The Carolina Times, March 17, 1962. In March 1962, the Carolina Theater was integrated for the first time when fourteen African Americans students snuck past the ticket ushers. For two days, long lines were formed by over a thousand African Americans in front of the ticket box, in which each black participant who was refused a ticket to the white section returned to the end of the line to try again, a tactic called \\"round-robin\\". As students were denied their entrance to the theater, they attempted elicit a reason from the salesman in order to gather evidence that African Americans were being denied entrance due to race. When the box office moved to the inside of the Theater, white advocates aided in the effort by purchasing tickets for black moviegoers, who would then sneak into the side doors of the theater.Durham County Library, \\"Carolina Theatre - 1961-63.\\" Last modified May 18, 2010. Accessed December 1, 2013.  Response to Protests  In response to the two-day mass demonstration, Judge Hamilton Hobgood issued a restraining order for the 34 students of the NAACP Youth Group who were in charge of the demonstration to stay away from the theater. Claiming to have suffered tremendous financial and reputational losses from the student-run protest, Abercrombie demanded a total of $30,000 in compensation: $25,000 for punitive damages and $5,000 for disruption of the natural procession of the theater. The restraining order also restricted interfering with the normal business functions of the theater, blocking the incoming and outgoing of consumers, and re-entering the line after being refused a ticket. A copy of the restraining order was posted outside the theater and handed out to each of the 34 students.\\" Durham Theater Uses Legal Device to Halt Mass Student Demonstrations by Local NAACP.” The Carolina Times, March 24, 1962.  Desegregation and Aftermath  In 1963, the Mayor’s Interim Committee of Race Relations proposed a solution that both the theater managers and the chapters of NAACP and CORE supported. On July 15 the NAACP and CORE chapters initiated a twenty-day trial period in which most of Durham’s theaters, including the Carolina Theater, integrated blacks into the theaters in a controlled and spaced manner. Mrs. Bessie McLaurin, one of the adult supervisors in CORE, served as the scheduling manager for numerous theaters during the twenty-day trial. Black movie-goers interested in a particular showing had to contact McLaurin in order to schedule a time and date for their attendance. The idea was to gradually increase the number of African Americans allowed into each showing by each of the twenty trial days in order to slowly integrate them into the audience. On August 5, 1963, new mayor Wense Grabarek informed Miss Joyce Ware, the NAACP-CORE council chairman, that all movie houses except the Uptown Theater would be open to the entire public. This marked the end of the 20-day trial period and the integration of the Carolina Theater.\\"Action Ends 20 Day Period of Quota Tests.\\" The Carolina Times, August 17, 1963.\\"Theaters Not Fully Opened.\\" The Carolina Times, July 27, 1963.

The northern half includes the high mountains of Snowdonia and the mixed farmland and hills of the Llŷn peninsula, which between them make up much of the former county of Caernarfonshire. The southern part of Gwynedd is the softer coastal and upland landscapes of the former county of Merionethshire. Gwynedd, the second-largest county in Wales, has a total of 497 scheduled monuments. That is too many to have on a single list article, so for convenience the list is divided into three. The 365 prehistoric sites are in two lists, covering 171 sites in former Merionethshire, and 194 sites in former Caernarvonshire. The 132 sites dating from Roman to modern times are included in a single list covering the whole of the county. Gwynedd is a unitary authority comprising most of the two historic counties. In 1974 it also merged with Anglesey, and the merged county was also called Gwynedd. Since 1996 Anglesey has been a separate county again. ;Prehistoric sites:Over the county as a whole, there are 365 prehistoric scheduled monuments. One of the oldest is a stone axe factory. Over the whole of Gwynedd, there are 139 scheduled burial sites, including chambered tombs, cairns, mounds and barrows, dating from the Neolithic, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. A further 167 sites are 'Domestic', mostly Iron Age hut circles and enclosures. As well as several field systems, there are 47 defensive sites such as hillforts and promontory forts, again from the Iron Age. ;Roman to modern sites: There are 16 Roman scheduled sites in the county, almost all of which relate either to Roman military activity, or local defensive measures. By contrast, the 14 early medieval (Dark Age) monuments are all individual stones, either with carved crosses or other inscriptions, or in one case a sundial. The 53 post-Norman medieval sites include the Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd World Heritage Site. In Total, 7 castles, 11 mottes and 7 enclosures are scheduled, as well as deserted settlements, 2 abbeys, 5 chapels and 2 holy wells. The 49 post-medieval sites include 10 bridges, various sites relating to quarries, mines, engine houses, and railways, and 5 World War II defences. The northern prehistoric sites are listed at List of Scheduled prehistoric Monuments in Gwynedd (former Caernarvonshire) The southern prehistoric sites are listed at List of Scheduled prehistoric Monuments in Gwynedd (former Merionethshire) The more recent sites are listed at List of Scheduled Roman to modern Monuments in Gwynedd Scheduled Ancient Monuments (SAMs) have statutory protection.

Cilella plays a graphic designer and father-to-be named Michael who, after receiving a troubling video of his former best friend Chris via email, travels to a remote cabin to save his drug-addicted friend, played by Curran. The 2017 film The Endless shares the same creative universe as Resolution, and may be interpreted as a partial sequel.  Plot  Michael Danube, a professional graphic designer who lives in the city with his pregnant wife, receives an email that contains a video of Chris Daniels, his former best friend. Chris, a drug addict, has retreated to a remote rural area and has become delusional and erratic. A map is included with the video. Despite the objections of his wife, Michael makes one last attempt to save Chris. He promises to return after one week and follows the map to a run-down house, where he hears Chris ranting and shooting a pistol. Chris reacts positively when Michael cautiously announces himself and invites him in, ranting about various subjects. When Chris refuses to go into rehab, Michael uses a stun gun to subdue him and handcuffs him to a pipe. Michael returns from a shopping trip and sees Chris trying to cut through his handcuff with a toothbrush. In the morning, Michael uses the stun gun to stave off an attempted attack by Chris. Later, Micah and Billy arrive and tell Michael that Chris is holding their drugs, which they want back. Chris warns Michael not to mess with them, as they have become more violent and unpredictable since Michael last knew them. Michael takes a walk and meets members of a UFO religion, then returns to the house and finds a set of strange photographs. Micah and Billy return, but they are scared off by Charles, a tribal security guard who tells Michael that Chris is squatting on reservation land. Michael gives Charles a bribe to allow them to stay for five days. After they discover creepy film footage, Chris claims that he never sent any emails or videos. Michael finds a book full of creepy campfire stories on their doorstep, and, when he returns the book to the library, finds film slides. Confused by the items that seem purposefully left for them to find, Michael suggests that it is a prank by Billy and Micah, which Chris dismisses. Michael continues to find conspicuous clues strewn about the area. When he bribes Charles for information, Charles warns him off and tells him that French students used the area for research. They encounter a con artist who offers to buy the house, but he leaves after Michael reveals that they are only \\"renting\\". When Michael rewatches the video he received in the e-mail, which has changed, it now shows an argument that Michael and Chris had moments before. When Billy and Micah return, they kill a dog that Chris had adopted, and Chris reveals that he is suicidal. Michael tracks down the dog's original owner, an archeologist named Byron who was a member of the original French research team. Byron believes the area is not haunted; instead, something there desires stories. Byron stresses the need for a beginning, middle, and end. Alarmed by Byron's eccentricity, Michael leaves and returns to the house. As more clues suddenly appear from nowhere, the film projector Michael has been using now reveals the gruesome death and funeral photos of himself and Chris. Michael's laptop suddenly plays a video that depicts their own violent deaths at the hands of Micah and Billy. Confused and scared, they flee the house, only to find a CD that has a recording of Charles murdering them and burning down the house. Chris insists that they leave the property immediately, but Michael does not want to bring the curse home with him; instead, he wants to attempt to appease the entity. When Chris and Michael return to the house, they witness Charles kill Micah and Billy before setting the house on fire. Chris and Michael panic; Chris breaks down and finally agrees to go to rehab. Their joy over achieving a happy ending to their story is abruptly cut short when the entity angrily confronts them. Chris apologizes profusely, and Michael asks the entity, \\"Can we try it another way?\\" The only reply he gets is an explosive roar from the creature.  Cast  * Peter Cilella as Michael Danube * Vinny Curran as Chris Daniels * Zahn McClarnon as Charles * Bill Oberst Jr. as Byron * Kurt David Anderson as Billy * Skyler Meacham as Micah * Justin Benson as Justin, UFO Cult Member * Aaron Scott Moorhead as Aaron, UFO Cult Member  Production  Although the film is often described as \\"genre-bending\\", this was not an intentional concept; it was always meant as a horror film about an unseen antagonist that manipulates reality to create interesting stories. The detox plotline was introduced to give the story more structure, as the directors needed a plot device to have the story unfold over seven days. The script was written in six months. The main parts of the film were shot in 17 days, but the side plots were shot over the course of several months on weekends. The directors were specifically interested in avoiding overt homage, and, instead, focused on parodying independent film tropes. The film was shot in East County, San Diego. The directors have no direct experience with detox; to perform research, they searched Google for information. Benson was acquainted with a crack addict, however, and he used some of the addict's ramblings as inspiration for Chris' dialog.  Release  Resolution had its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival April 20, 2012. Tribeca Film gave the film an initial limited theatrical release on January 25, 2013. Cinedigm and Tribeca Film released Resolution on DVD, Blu-ray, and video-on-demand October 8, 2013.  Reception  Reviews Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that Resolution received positive reviews from 85% of 13 critics surveyed. Metacritic scored it 80/100 based on 5 reviews, which indicates \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Mark Adams of Screen Daily called it \\"a clever, twisted and very impressive slow-burner of a chiller\\". Rod Lott of the Oklahoma Gazette called it suspenseful and singled out the last 20 minutes as \\"seriously unnerving.\\" Jason Jenkins of Dread Central rated the film 4.5/5 stars and wrote, \\"With its great cast, unique concept, and its sharply written script, Resolution is one of the very best films I’ve seen this year.\\" Peter Gutierrez of Twitch Film said that the film has a \\"quietly mythic power\\" and takes many big risks that pay off. Adam Tyner of DVD Talk rated the film 5/5 stars and wrote, \\"There's a sense of unease that pervades almost every frame in Resolution, and a key part of it is not knowing what's lurking around the next bend. This is what horror movies are supposed to do, but it hardly ever really works in practice. Resolution not only nails it, but it does so without leaning on any jump scares, stings in the score, or cheap gore as a crutch.\\" Michael Nazarewycz of DVD Verdict said that Resolution is \\"a very good film\\" that gives new life to old tropes. Dennis Harvey of Variety wrote, \\"There are long buildups, and then there's Resolution, a movie that's virtually all nothing-much-happening setup until a still-teasing titular event that occupies just a few final seconds.\\" Lonnie Nadler of Bloody Disgusting rated the film 4/5 stars and wrote that it \\"delivers a dashingly intelligent commentary on the horror genre, the nature of cinema, and the relationship viewers have to on-screen victims.\\" Serena Whitney of Dread Central rated the film 5/5 stars and called it \\"a remarkable achievement\\" and \\"an inventive, character-based story\\" that \\"provides be the breath of fresh air the genre sorely needs\\". Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times wrote that it offers \\"a strangely tense and humorous meta-narrative\\" that \\"manages to keep its eerier moments surprising and its emotional life arresting.\\" Many reviews compared it to The Cabin in the Woods. SFX rated it 3.5/5 stars and described it as \\"clever, creepy meta-horror\\" that is like a lo-fi version of The Cabin in the Woods. Kurt Halfyard of Twitch Film wrote, \\"Unlike the smug, offhand silliness of Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard's Cabin in the Woods, this one makes you give a damn; as much about the films building Lost-type puzzlebox, but moreso the two exceptionally well realized characters.\\" Scott Weinberg of Fearnet called the film \\"a smart and subversive take\\" that is less entertaining than Cabin in the Woods. Nick Schager of The Village Voice wrote that it puts Cabin in the Woods \\"to shame on a fraction of the budget\\". Ian Buckwalter of NPR wrote, \\"Resolution is really a less self-conscious cousin to last year's Cabin in the Woods; both are hugely satisfying exercises in examining the way in which stories are told.\\" Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club rated it B and called it \\"an indie analog to The Cabin In The Woods\\" that \\"gets further in its conceit than its execution\\".  Awards  At Macabro 2013, the directors were awarded Best Director. At the Toronto After Dark Film Festival, the film won four awards, including best screenplay and most innovative film. The directors won Best Director at the 2013 Fantastic Planet film festival.

Historically they populated Delray in Detroit but moved to the Downriver area in the 1960s. There were four historic waves of Hungarian immigration to Detroit.Tutag, p. 65. History In the late 1890s, Hungarians began to populate Detroit. They settled Delray in Southwest Detroit.Woodford, p. 186. In 1898 the Michigan Malleable Iron Company began operations in Delray. Hungarian immigrants moved to Delray from cities including Cleveland Ohio; South Bend, Indiana; and Toledo, Ohio in order to get better working conditions and better wages.Beynon, \\"Crime and Custom of the Hungarians of Detroit,\\" p. 755. On 14 December 1904 the American Hungarian Reformed Church in Allen Park, MI was organised.http://www.ahrchurch.org/history.html www.ahrchurch.org/history.html In 1905 a Hungarian Catholic church opened in Delray. The current Holy Cross Hungarian Catholic Church building opened by 1925. Hungarians became one of the largest groups to settle Detroit in the early 20th century. The Delray-Springwells area served as the \\"Little Hungary\\" of Detroit and Michigan's Hungarian culture was centered in that community. The first wave of Hungarian refugees came to the U.S. in order to escape the Austro-Hungarian Empire's political issues.Collum and Krueger, p. 177. After World War I a second wave of Hungarian refugees, who escaped due to religious and political reasons, arrived. These Hungarians became refugees because several territories had been separated from the Hungarian homeland. They selected Detroit because the automobile plants paid high wages. Many Hungarians in the second wave had intended to return to Hungary. However Detroit's Historic Places of Worship stated that \\"strong community ties and the relative betterment of daily life kept them in America.\\" Some of those who came in this wave had previously worked in coal mines in Pennsylvania. As the number of Hungarians in Delray increased, a new church of the Holy Cross Hungarian Catholic Church opened in 1925.\\"Church anniversary celebration planned.\\" The Detroit News.

Hungarians coming to Detroit had lived in other U.S. cities before coming to Detroit and Beynon wrote that they usually \\"have become acculturated, at least partially, to Hungarian-American life prior to their migration to Detroit.\\" Beynon wrote that the immigrants had lived in a \\"rather homogenous\\" society in small communities \\"which are least affected by modern industrial civilization\\" and that \\"their lives had been moulded and controlled by the traditional folk culture.\\" Another wave of Hungarians appeared after World War II ended. In 1951 there were about 55,000 ethnic Hungarians in Metro Detroit.Mayer, p. 25. \\"HUNGARIANS There are approximately 55,000 people of Hungarian extraction -within the Metropolitan Area of Detroit. The first members of this group arrived in Detroit before 1900, and the peak immigration to the city was in the period 1901 to[...]\\" Another wave of Hungarians, those against the Communist forces, escaped the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, causing more to arrive in Delray. The construction of Interstate 75 in the mid-1960s destroyed large parts of Delray and divided the community into two pieces. Middle and working class Hungarians moved to Detroit's downriver suburbs Allen Park, Lincoln Park, Melvindale, and Riverview. Some Hungarians also moved to Taylor.\\"Popular band plays soulful music, Hungarian style.\\" The Detroit News. August 21, 2002. Retrieved on December 3, 2013. ID: det12771002. \\"[...]opened in 1965, the ethnic group began moving to Allen Park and Taylor.\\" The Holy Cross parish school closed. These suburbanites then commuted to their jobs in Detroit along the new expressways. As of the 1990 U.S. Census there were 7,712 speakers of the Hungarian language at home in the State of Michigan. This declined to 4,851 in the 2000 U.S. Census. Miklós Kontra, the author of the \\"Hungarian\\" entry in The American Midwest: An Interpretive Encyclopedia, wrote that the decline in this number and similar numbers in the American Midwest illustrates \\"the rapid assimilation of Hungarian Americans.\\"Kontra, p. 333. Religion In Delray the First Hebrew Congregation of Delray or the Orthodox Hungarian Jewish Congregation was located on Burdeno, near Fort Wayne. It was operated by Hungarian Jews and it was Detroit's first Orthodox Judaism synagogue that was east of Woodward Avenue.Cohen, p. 64. There were several Hungarian Reformed Churches in Delray; only the American Hungarian Reformed Church located in Allen Park remains in existence.www.ahrchurch.org/history.html Institutions The Hungarian Cultural Center is located in Taylor.Lessenberry, Jack. \\"A '56er' in Detroit will never forget Hungarian Uprising.\\" Toledo Blade.

Retrieved from Google News (8 of 39) on December 3, 2013. \\"Last Sunday, as they do every year at this time, at the Hungarian Cultural Center in Taylor, south of Detroit.\\" The center and the American Hungarian Reformed Church in Allen Park host cultural and social events. Hungarian-born and Hungarian-descent residents living in suburbs travel to these events. As of 2006 veterans of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 have annual gatherings at the center. By 1935 various Hungarian social clubs including athletic, altar, dramatic, sick benefit and insurance, singing (Dalárdák), and social clubs were formed. Each club included a membership and a wider group of adherents or pártolók. Beynon wrote that \\"Practically every Hungarian of Detroit who has not broken away entirely from the people of his own nationality is connected in some way with one or more of these societies or clubs.\\"Beynon, \\"Crime and Custom of the Hungarians of Detroit,\\" p. 757. A former editor of the Detroiti Ujság, Dr. Charles Földy, stated that \\"These clubs make up the varied life of our colony. If a man isolates himself from all of them, he is not a member of the Hungarian colony any longer.\\" Beynon wrote that the clubs exercise the social control previously enforced by village groups back in Hungary.Beynon, \\"Crime and Custom of the Hungarians of Detroit,\\" p. 757-758. The Federation of Hungarian Churches and Societies () represented and taxed all of the social clubs. Some organizations, such as the Socialist Labor Party, established multiple clubs to appeal to multiple types of people.Beynon, \\"Crime and Custom of the Hungarians of Detroit,\\" p. 758. Historic institutions included the Hungarian Country Club, the Hungarian Athletic Club, and the Hungarian Women's Club. The country club organized rural-based activities such as hikes and picnics. The women's club, which held card parties, lectures, and musical programs, had offices on West Jefferson Avenue.Feinstein, p. 220. Culture and social life Steve Babson, author of Working Detroit, stated that in the 1920s, women from Hungarian and Finnish houses had \\"considerably more freedom\\" compared to those from Italian and Macedonian houses.Babson, p. 45-46 Women from Hungarian and Finnish houses opened social groups for both sexes such as political, benevolent, and sports groups; women from the ethnicities often had more encouragement to attend high school and further education compared to Italians and Macedonians. In the late 1920s Lois Rankin of the International Institute of Detroit stated that in Detroit \\"as in the home country, Magyar [Hungarian] women occupy a position of equality with men, and there is little subservience to be noted in their attitude.\\"Babson, p. 46 Historically Hungarians in Detroit celebrated \\"Day of Sorrow\\" on October 16, a tribute to the 1848 hangings of 13 generals.Mayer, p. 26. \\\\ See also * Demographics of Metro Detroit * History of the Italian Americans in Metro Detroit * History of the Polish Americans in Metro Detroit Notes References * Babson, Steve.

Early life Gorman was born in Goornong, Victoria, on 10 April 1891 to Patrick Gorman and his Irish wife, Mary Mulcair. He was educated in Sydney at St Joseph's College, Hunters Hill. After serving as an articled clerk in Bendigo, he was admitted to practise as a solicitor and barrister on 5 May 1914.Barry O. Jones, 'Gorman, Sir Eugene (1891–1973)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, accessed 4 December 2013. Military service During the First World War, Gorman enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) on 4 September 1915. After being commissioned in June 1916, Gorman served in Europe on the Western Front, arriving there in December 1916. He was posted to the 22nd Battalion, an infantry unit, and on 3 May 1917, during the Second Battle of Bullecourt, he led his company into battle, and despite being severely wounded, remained at his post until the company was relieved. For these actions, Gorman was awarded the Military Cross. The citation for the award read: Gorman later reached the rank of captain in early 1919 before being discharged from the AIF in October 1919 upon his repatriation to Australia. He subsequently published a book about his experiences, titled With the Twenty-Second. During the Second World War, Gorman served alongside the Australian forces in the Middle East as an honorary commissioner to the Australian Comforts Fund. He returned to Australia in 1942, and the following April was appointed to the Second Australian Imperial Force. Holding the substantive rank of colonel, he was appointed as a temporary brigadier and fulfilled the role of Chief Inspector of Army Administration, before being sent to the United Kingdom to command the AIF Reception Group, which was responsible for repatriating released prisoners of war back to Australia. After the war, he was transferred to the reserve list in November 1945. Legal career Following his service in the First World War, Gorman resumed his legal career, building up a large and highly regarded practice, and took silk as a Queen's Counsel in 1929. Gorman had some involvement in politics, unsuccessfully standing as a candidate for the Victorian Legislative Council in 1931, and serving as an influential advisor and intermediary for the Country Party Premier of Victoria, Albert Dunstan, from 1935. In 1940, Gorman retired from active practice from the Bar, although he retained rooms at Equity Chambers, and came out of retirement on several occasions including serving as counsel for former Premier Thomas Hollway at a Royal Commission on bribery charges in 1952, an inquiry into the Petrov Affair in 1954, and to defend the racehorse trainer Harry Bird in 1969. According to his secretary, Gorman ran \\"the biggest free advisory legal service in Melbourne\\", offering legal advice pro bono to young lawyers, politicians and businesspeople. From 1956 to 1968, Gorman was Chairman of the Commonwealth Dried Fruits Export Board. Honours In addition to the Military Cross, Gorman was awarded two honours of the Order of the British Empire, both for service to the dried fruits industry. He was made a Commander (CBE) in 1960,GORMAN, Eugene, It's an Honour, 31 December 1960. and elevated to Knight Commander (KBE) in 1966.GORMAN, Eugene, It's an Honour, 11 June 1966. Gorman served as Victoria's consul-general to Greece, and was awarded two Greek honours: the gold cross of the Greek Red Cross and Knight Commander of the Royal Order of the Phoenix. Gorman's rooms in the Equity Chambers building on Melbourne's Bourke Street were named the Gorman Chambers in his honour, and have been maintained and occupied since his death by a group of barristers.Two new chambers to open in Victoria , Lawyers Weekly, 26 July 2010. Personal life Gorman married French-born Marthe Vallée, whom he had met while serving in France during the First World War, at St Patrick's Cathedral on 6 September 1920. Their son, Pierre Gorman, was born completely deaf in 1924, and went on to become the first deaf person to graduate from the University of Cambridge, and a well-known educator and expert on disability issues.

It is a facultative parasite of horses, invading the nasal cavity, and sometimes numerous other areas, where it produces granulomatous masses. On rare occasion, it can infect humans as well, in whom it is invariably fatal. Based on studies performed on infected horses in Florida, the parasite is associated with swampland environments. These worms are dioecious, with female and male organs having been found in separate individuals. Eggs and immature larvae have been found in tissue samples, indicating an asexual reproductive cycle , and free-living males have been found in soil environments, indicating that sexual reproduction also occurs. The site of entry for the parasite is thought to be through breaks in the skin or through mucous membranes. This nematode is now distributed worldwide, as cases of equine infections have been found in Canada, Florida, the Nordic regions, and Arabian horses alike. Morphology The genital tract in the advanced fourth stage female of H. gingivalis is Uterus didelphys (twinned uteri) and amphidelphic (uteri opposed) and terminal ends of the uterine horns are reflected, the anterior one ventrally, the posterior one dorsally. Adults are 235–460 μm long. In the parthenogenic adult, the posterior branch forms a short ovary, whereas most of the anterior branch becomes a combined uterus–oviduct.The worm has a conical, asymmetrical tail that is shorter on the ventral side. Life cycle and habitation This is a facultative parasite whose stages remain unclear. It dwells actively in soil, around plants and other organically rich environments including manure and compost. Prevalence of infection According to a 1997 paper, neurohelminthiases in general are more prevalent where environmental factors and poor sanitation assist the spread of parasitism between man and animals, and have been facilitated by population shifts and improved transport. Neurohelminthiases are often not diagnosed because they are unfamiliar; diagnostic tests are not easily available.Nishimura, K & Hung, T. (1997). Current views on geographic distribution and modes of infection of neurohelminthic diseases. Journal of the Neurological Sciences, 145. Neurohelminthiases in general are not common in the United States. Effects on health H. gingivalis is an extremely uncommon infection in humans, but causes a universally lethal meningoencephalitis. This disease shows greatly increased concentration of eosinophils in the cerebrospinal fluid. In horses (where the parasite is most studied), infection of the brain is common, followed by the kidneys, oral and nasal cavities, lymph nodes, lungs, spinal cord, and adrenal gland, and also reports of infection of heart, liver, stomach and bone. An extremely rare triple fatality from Halicephalobus was reported in Wales after previously rejected, infected kidneys from a homeless, alcohol-abusing man who died of meningitis were transplanted into two recipients.The Guardian newspaper: Rare parasitic worm killed two kidney donor patients, inquest hears, 18 November 2014 As of 2015 six cases had been described in humans. Treatment All known cases of human infections were only found post mortem and had been fatal; they had not been treated with antihelminthic drugs (such as ivermectin and benzimidazole). In animals, these drugs are mostly ineffective, as they do not cross the blood–brain barrier. Further research When there is occurrence of a neurohelminthic disease, it is fatal, as there exist no tests that can be done to identify these species and apply effective treatment. These nematodes seem to exhibit neurotropism, but their life cycle, mode of infection and risk factors are not yet clearly understood. History This organism was described in 1954 by Stefanski.

Founded in 1898 by local black social leaders, its business increased from less than a thousand dollars in income in 1899 to a quarter of a million dollars in 1910.W. E. B. Du Bois, \\"The Upbuilding of Black Durham,\\" The World's Work, January, 1912, 335. (primary 1) The company specialized in \\"industrial insurance,\\" which was basically burial insurance. The company hired salesmen whose main job was to collect small payments (of about 10 cents) to cover the insured person for the next week. If the person died while insured, the company immediately paid benefits of about 100 dollars. This covered the cost of a suitable funeral, which was a high prestige item in the black community.Charles Richmond Henderson, \\"Industrial Insurance. VI. Private Insurance Companies,\\" American Journal of Sociology in JSTOR It began operations in the new tobacco manufacturing city of Durham, North Carolina, and moved north into Virginia and Maryland, then to major northern black urban centers, and then to the rest of the urban South.

In the late 1800s and throughout the 1900s, Durham was known as \\"The Black Wall Street of America.\\"Walter B. Weare, \\"Black Business in the New South: A Social History of the NC Mutual Life Insurance Company,\\" Durham: Duke University Press, 1993. for the progress that African Americans were making within the town. The company's founders, thought to be inspired by North Carolina business tycoon Washington Duke, included John Merrick and Aaron McDuffie Moore, two particularly influential men in Durham's history. North Carolina Mutual and its prosperity brought many good things to Durham's black community, and its founders and organizers were important contributors to social and economic progress in the city and particularly in its African American community. North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company Headquarters. In 1965 the N.C. Mutual Life Insurance building became the tallest office building owned by African Americans in the United States. In 2006 the N.C. Mutual Life Insurance Co. building sold to a developer for only $11.4 million. N.C. Mutual remains in the building as a tenant under a long-term lease agreement. Origins \\"Black Wall Street\\" historic marker in Durham, NC North Carolina Mutual was the brainchild of black entrepreneur John C. MerrickMargaret Peters, \\"The Ebony Book of Black Achievement\\", Johnson Publishing Company, Inc., 1974, 112.Bihm, Jennifer. (2014-02-06) “Business in Black History: North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance” Los Angeles Sentinel in the late 1800s. Merrick was born into slavery as the son of a white man and a former slave in 1859. He grew up in Raleigh and Chapel Hill, two cities near Durham, and he learned various skills such as bricklaying and barbering during his youth. He moved to Durham in 1880 and opened his own barber shop in 1882. His hair-cutting business grew to include several stores, three for whites and two for blacks; the barbers were all black. Merrick himself cut hair for many people. The biggest influence came after John Merrick, along with four other partners, bought the Royal Knights of King David. The society was \\"a semi- religious fraternal and beneficial society for health and life insurance.\\" In buying it, Merrick learned about insurance and how to relate the insurance business to African Americans.Jean Bradley Anderson, \\"Durham County: A History of Durham County, North Carolina\\", Durham: Duke University Press, 2011, 188. Merrick knew that blacks had short life expectancies and that they generally had poor health, largely due to their low income. These things made the idea of starting an insurance business for African Americans a very risky one, because many people would be expected to die before they could contribute to the success of the business. However they were also the reasons African Americans needed life insurance to begin with. Industrial insurance had the advantage of a premium collected every week that provided coverage for the following week. There was minimal need for tracking the changes of address of the customers. Merrick decided that the opportunity to help blacks outweighed the risk, and he joined with investors Aaron Moore, William Gaston Pearson, Watson, Shepard, Johnson, and Dawkins to found the North Carolina Mutual and Provident Society in 1898. In the first year, there was a terrible lack of business, and the company lost money overall. Because of this, many investors left North Carolina Mutual, and by the time the company was reorganized in 1900, only Merrick, Moore, and Moore's young nephew Charles Clinton Spaulding remained. Spaulding was appointed General Manager with Merrick serving as President and Moore as his only other principal. Under this leadership, the growth of the company began. Leadership John Merrick was the first president of N. C. Mutual, and he served as such from the company's founding until his death in 1919. After Merrick's death, Dr. Aaron McDuffie MooreNorth Carolina History Project “Aaron McDuffie Moore (1863-1923)” became president of the company. He was the first African American in Durham to practice medicine. After becoming president of N. C. Mutual, he devoted his full-time to the company until he died in 1923. When Moore died, Charles Clinton Spaulding took over as president. Spaulding served on the board of trustees at Howard University beginning in 1936. he was active in the National Negro Insurance Association and the National Negro Bankers Association in the early 1900s and was one of few African American members of the New York Chamber of Commerce beginning in 1942. He also served on boards of trustees at Shaw University and North Carolina College. He was awarded the Harmon Foundation Gold medal for distinguished achievement in business, and he received honorary Law doctorates from Shaw University, Tuskegee University, and Atlanta University.Documenting the American South “C. C. Spaulding (Charles Clinton), 1874-1952” University Library at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill One of the company's famous leaders, Chuck Watts is now a city attorney for Greensboro City used to be a senior vice president and general counsel. North Carolina Mutual and Durham N. C. Mutual has had long-lasting impacts on the Durham society and the way people view Durham. Durham, North Carolina was known in the 1800s to have been a highly segregated city, much like many others in the South at that time. However, by 1900, it had begun to emerge as a rather progressive area by the region's standards. Even though there was a clear, unspoken line between \\"White Durham\\" and \\"Black Durham\\" that kept the city segregated, African American progress in the city was evident, and N. C. Mutual was an important part of Durham's progress. The business that the company brought to its owners and workers was impressive and impactful. Because the business was \\"owned and operated by and for Negroes,\\" it offered the black people of Durham many new job opportunities as it grew. Primarily, it offered much-needed life insurance to the black community of Durham, and it gave them a business on which they could rely and place their trust. The people of Durham took just as much pride in the \\"multi-million dollar enterprise\\" that was N. C. Mutual as they did in the progressive nature of their city. As the company grew, it came to be a symbol of African American success and the success of Durham as a whole. Visits to Durham from Black leaders Durham became a national magnet for prominent black leaders, who celebrated the city as a model of racial pride. The city attracted the attention of famous visitors who gave positive reviews of the city that were based on the N. C. Mutual business. Booker T. Washington and W.E.B. Du Bois, two of the most important black leaders in the 1900s visited Durham County on separate occasions and made comments about the state of the city and its black community. Booker T. Washington was an advocate for avoiding confrontation with racist whites and instead emphasized long-term educational and economic advancement in the black community. He claimed after his visit that Durham \\"was the city of cities to look for prosperity of the Negroes and the greatest amount of friendly feeling between the two races of the South.\\"Booker T. Washington, \\"Durham, North Carolina, a City of Negro Enterprises,\\" The Independent, Mar 30, 1911, 71. Black entrepreneurs such as Merrick and Moore had not simply enjoyed the fruits of their efforts for themselves, but instead had spread it among all of Durham's people. Even the impoverished in Durham had living conditions surpassing those of the poor black communities in the larger southern cities at the time. Washington, who had expected to find the poorer blacks of Durham to be in shoddy state, notes in his writing that he \\"drove through their section of the city, observing closely their houses inside and out,\\" and goes on to explain that the neighborhood was in such good state that he \\"almost doubted [his] eyes.\\" This poorer class of blacks, which Washington describes as the class upon which \\"the real estimate of [African Americans] is generally formed,\\" was thriving in Durham and gave off a \\"general healthy appearance.\\" The reason for this was the care of prominent black leaders in the city and the relations between white and black people in the area, both of which were pillars in the formation and mission of North Carolina Mutual. W.E.B. Du Bois had a different approach, supporting agitation to demand full civil rights for blacks—yet he also celebrated Durham. Reflecting on his visit to Durham, he notes that the \\"social and economic development [of African American people in the city] is perhaps more striking than that of any similar group in the nation.\\" He goes on to mention the actions of C. C. Spaulding, then general manager of N. C. Mutual, who took children from a school to town \\"to show them what colored People were doing in Durham.\\" He saw Spaulding's action as an abnormal display of care within the African American community. Du Bois praised the success of North Carolina Mutual and commends the company for avoiding common pitfalls. He specifically attributed the success of Durham as a whole to the drive of Merrick, Moore, and Spaulding. Du Bois believed that their ingenuity in the formation of N. C. Mutual was the beginning and cornerstone of \\"the economic building of black Durham\\" for which the city came to be known. The Company as a symbol The N. C. Mutual Life Insurance business came to represent a major divergence from the militant strategy of W. E. B. Du Bois. It mirrored the tendency of the blacks in Durham to follow the gradualist plan of Booker T. Washington. N. C. Mutual was founded to bring about \\"racial self-help and uplift,\\" which are mentioned on the company's website as \\"traditions of the Company dating back to its founding.\\" Its goal was to help them overcome the differences of a segregated society through economic pursuits. The company generated massive revenue for black Durham without the involvement of whites. That revenue was then used to better the situation of blacks throughout the community. This process all but embodied Washington's ideals to win equality financially and economically before anything else. The company came to symbolize the ideals of African American self-help that it stood for from the beginning. One newspaper covering the company's 50th anniversary remarks that it \\"has fully justified the hopes, anticipations and desires of the founders.\\" It goes on to say that the firm has become a great \\"enterprise that is the property of the policyholders themselves.\\"(1949-04-02). \\"N. C. Mutual Marks 50th Anniversary,\\" Philadelphia Tribune The company was not built to spite white people in Durham or for fear of them. Instead, it was built alongside white businesses for the purpose of helping blacks in the community. Du Bois commented himself on the value of \\"the active friendship of the Duke family, General Julian Carr, and [other influential white people].\\" He went on to mention \\"the disposition of white citizens of Durham to say: 'Hands off – give them a chance – don't interfere.'\\" This disposition is what he believed to be one of the great contributors to Durham success. Recent history Today, North Carolina Mutual Life Company operates in Durham. It currently services as clients all across the world through partnerships and offices in many states. The company has total assets of $162 million, with net life insurance of $14.3 billion. North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance now provides many different life insurance products.

The castle is L-shaped and consists of a main building with wings, as well as several outbuildings including a coach house. The main building is characterized by two round towers at the front and a built-in, square tower at the rear. Over the centuries, the castle has been extensively altered and restored several times and has stylistic elements of the Neo-Renaissance and Rococo, among others. Couwelaar Castle is a historical monument.  History  The first mentions of a Couwelaar estate date to the beginning of the 15th century: in 1402 it is recorded as belonging to Pieter van Immerseel. It later passed to Pieter de Francques, a merchant from Antwerp, and then to his son Raphaël. In 1584, Couwelaar was sold in the Vrijdagmarkt. In any event, in 1606 it was owned by Gilles Du Mont, a cloth merchant who had also recently acquired the nearby castle of Bisschoppenhof. The Du Monts significantly improved the castle by adding six towers and laying out gardens and fish ponds. Couwelaar changed hands several times in the following years. Pedro de Man, a former schepen (alderman) of Antwerp, had the castle thoroughly restored in 1766, in classical style. Four of the towers were in poor repair and were demolished and a new moat, among other things, was added. In 1848, a pleasure garden in the style of the Italian Neo- Renaissance was commissioned by John della Faille de Leverghem and his wife, who had purchased the castle two years earlier. They also had the castle itself renovated in the style of the Flemish Neo-Renaissance. The real estate company Crédit Foncier d'Anvers acquired the castle in 1913 and had the moats filled in. In 1927, the castle ultimately became the property of the municipality, which until 1970 used it for administrative services and as a workshop and storage. Repairs were carried out in 1986-88, particularly to the towers and roofs. In the early 21st century the castle was sold to a group of new owners who pledged to restore it without impairing its historic character, and it has been divided into five cohousing apartments.\\"Artikel 1\\", Het Belang van Limburg, April 24, 2001 \\"Wonen in Antwerpen: Ontdek het in 7 stadswandelingen\\", Stad Antwerpen, n.d., p. 48 (pdf p. 25) References  Sources  * External links * Castles in Belgium ","title":"Couwelaar Castle"},{"id":"41263577","title":"3LAU"},{"id":"41263579","text":"West Meets East, Volume 2 is an album by American violinist Yehudi Menuhin and Indian sitar virtuoso Ravi Shankar, released in 1968.

The tools provided by quantum stochastic calculus are of great use for modeling the random evolution of systems undergoing measurement, as in quantum trajectories. Just as the Lindblad master equation provides a quantum generalization to the Fokker–Planck equation, quantum stochastic calculus allows for the derivation of quantum stochastic differential equations (QSDE) that are analogous to classical Langevin equations. For the remainder of this article stochastic calculus will be referred to as classical stochastic calculus, in order to clearly distinguish it from quantum stochastic calculus.  Heat baths  An important physical scenario in which a quantum stochastic calculus is needed is the case of a system interacting with a heat bath. It is appropriate in many circumstances to model the heat bath as an assembly of harmonic oscillators. One type of interaction between the system and the bath can be modeled (after making a canonical transformation) by the following Hamiltonian: :H=H_\\\\mathrm{sys}(\\\\mathbf{Z})+\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sum_n\\\\left((p_n-\\\\kappa_nX)^2+\\\\omega_n^2q_n^2\\\\right)\\\\,, where H_\\\\mathrm{sys} is the system Hamiltonian, \\\\mathbf{Z} is a vector containing the system variables corresponding to a finite number of degrees of freedom, n is an index for the different bath modes, \\\\omega_n is the frequency of a particular mode, p_n and q_n are bath operators for a particular mode, X is a system operator, and \\\\kappa_n quantifies the coupling between the system and a particular bath mode. In this scenario the equation of motion for an arbitrary system operator Y is called the quantum Langevin equation and may be written as: where [\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot] and \\\\\\\\{\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot\\\\\\\\} denote the commutator and anticommutator (respectively), the memory function f is defined as: :f(t)\\\\equiv\\\\sum_n\\\\kappa_n^2\\\\cos(\\\\omega_nt)\\\\,, and the time dependent noise operator \\\\xi is defined as: :\\\\xi(t)\\\\equiv i\\\\sum_n\\\\kappa_n\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\hbar\\\\omega_n}{2}}\\\\left(-a_n(t_0)e^{-i\\\\omega_n(t-t_0)}+a^\\\\dagger_n(t_0)e^{i\\\\omega_n(t-t_0)}\\\\right)\\\\,, where the bath annihilation operator a_n is defined as: :a_n\\\\equiv\\\\frac{\\\\omega_nq_n+ip_n}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\hbar\\\\omega_n}}\\\\,. Oftentimes this equation is more general than is needed, and further approximations are made to simplify the equation.  White noise formalism  For many purposes it is convenient to make approximations about the nature of the heat bath in order to achieve a white noise formalism. In such a case the interaction may be modeled by the Hamiltonian H=H_\\\\mathrm{sys}+H_B+H_\\\\mathrm{int} where: :H_B=\\\\hbar\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\omega\\\\,\\\\omega b^\\\\dagger(\\\\omega)b(\\\\omega)\\\\,, and :H_\\\\mathrm{int}=i\\\\hbar\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\omega\\\\,\\\\kappa(\\\\omega)\\\\left(b^\\\\dagger(\\\\omega)c-c^\\\\dagger b(\\\\omega)\\\\right)\\\\,, where b(\\\\omega) are annihilation operators for the bath with the commutation relation [b(\\\\omega),b^\\\\dagger(\\\\omega^\\\\prime)]=\\\\delta(\\\\omega-\\\\omega^\\\\prime), c is an operator on the system, \\\\kappa(\\\\omega) quantifies the strength of the coupling of the bath modes to the system, and H_\\\\mathrm{sys} describes the free system evolution. This model uses the rotating wave approximation and extends the lower limit of \\\\omega to -\\\\infty in order to admit a mathematically simple white noise formalism. The coupling strengths are also usually simplified to a constant in what is sometimes called the first Markov approximation: :\\\\kappa(\\\\omega)=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{2\\\\pi}}\\\\,. Systems coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators can be thought of as being driven by a noise input and radiating a noise output. The input noise operator at time t is defined by: :b_\\\\mathrm{in}(t)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}}\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\omega\\\\,e^{-i\\\\omega(t-t_0)}b_0(\\\\omega)\\\\,, where b_0(\\\\omega)=\\\\left.b(\\\\omega)\\\\right\\\\vert_{t=t_0}, since this operator is expressed in the Heisenberg picture. Satisfaction of the commutation relation [b_\\\\mathrm{in}(t),b_\\\\mathrm{in}^\\\\dagger(t^\\\\prime)]=\\\\delta(t-t^\\\\prime) allows the model to have a strict correspondence with a Markovian master equation. In the white noise setting described so far, the quantum Langevin equation for an arbitrary system operator a takes a simpler form: For the case most closely corresponding to classical white noise, the input to the system is described by a density operator giving the following expectation value: =N\\\\delta(t-t^\\\\prime)\\\\,.}}  Quantum Wiener process  In order to define quantum stochastic integration, it is important to define a quantum Wiener process: :B(t,t_0)=\\\\int_{t_0}^tb_\\\\mathrm{in}(t^\\\\prime)\\\\mathrm{d}t^\\\\prime\\\\,. This definition gives the quantum Wiener process the commutation relation [B(t,t_0),B^\\\\dagger(t,t_0)]=t-t_0. The property of the bath annihilation operators in () implies that the quantum Wiener process has an expectation value of: :\\\\langle B^\\\\dagger(t,t_0)B(t,t_0)\\\\rangle_{\\\\rho(t,t_0)}=N(t-t_0)\\\\,. The quantum Wiener processes are also specified such that their quasiprobability distributions are Gaussian by defining the density operator: :\\\\rho(t,t_0)=(1-e^{-\\\\kappa})\\\\exp\\\\left[-\\\\frac{\\\\kappa B^\\\\dagger(t,t_0)B(t,t_0)}{t-t_0}\\\\right]\\\\,, where N=1/(e^\\\\kappa-1).  Quantum stochastic integration  The stochastic evolution of system operators can also be defined in terms of the stochastic integration of given equations.  Quantum Itô integral  The quantum Itô integral of a system operator g(t) is given by: :(\\\\mathbf{I})\\\\int_{t_0}^tg(t^\\\\prime)\\\\mathrm{d}B(t^\\\\prime)=\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\sum_{i=1}^ng(t_i)\\\\left(B(t_{i+1},t_0)-B(t_i,t_0)\\\\right)\\\\,, where the bold (I) preceding the integral stands for Itô. One of the characteristics of defining the integral in this way is that the increments \\\\mathrm{d}B and \\\\mathrm{d}B^\\\\dagger commute with the system operator.  Itô quantum stochastic differential equation  In order to define the Itô , it is necessary to know something about the bath statistics. In the context of the white noise formalism described earlier, the Itô can be defined as: :(\\\\mathbf{I})\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}a=-\\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar}[a,H_\\\\mathrm{sys}]\\\\mathrm{d}t+\\\\gamma\\\\left((N+1)\\\\mathcal{D}[c^\\\\dagger]a+N\\\\mathcal{D}[c]a\\\\right)\\\\mathrm{d}t-\\\\sqrt{\\\\gamma}\\\\left([a,c^\\\\dagger]\\\\mathrm{d}B(t)-\\\\mathrm{d}B^\\\\dagger(t)[a,c]\\\\right)\\\\,, where the equation has been simplified using the Lindblad superoperator: :\\\\mathcal{D}[A]a\\\\equiv AaA^\\\\dagger-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(A^\\\\dagger Aa+aA^\\\\dagger A\\\\right)\\\\,. This differential equation is interpreted as defining the system operator a as the quantum Itô integral of the right hand side, and is equivalent to the Langevin equation ().  Quantum Stratonovich integral  The quantum Stratonovich integral of a system operator g(t) is given by: :(\\\\mathbf{S})\\\\int_{t_0}^tg(t^\\\\prime)\\\\mathrm{d}B(t^\\\\prime)=\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\frac{g(t_i)+g(t_{i+1})}{2}\\\\left(B(t_{i+1},t_0)-B(t_i,t_0)\\\\right)\\\\,, where the bold (S) preceding the integral stands for Stratonovich. Unlike the Itô formulation, the increments in the Stratonovich integral do not commute with the system operator, and it can be shown that: :(\\\\mathbf{S})\\\\int_{t_0}^tg(t^\\\\prime)\\\\mathrm{d}B(t^\\\\prime)-(\\\\mathbf{S})\\\\int_{t_0}^t\\\\mathrm{d}B(t^\\\\prime)g(t^\\\\prime)=\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{\\\\gamma}}{2}\\\\int_{t_0}^t\\\\mathrm{d}t^\\\\prime\\\\,[g(t^\\\\prime),c(t^\\\\prime)]\\\\,.  Stratonovich quantum stochastic differential equation  The Stratonovich can be defined as: :(\\\\mathbf{S})\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}a=-\\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar}[a,H_\\\\mathrm{sys}]\\\\mathrm{d}t-\\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{2}\\\\left([a,c^\\\\dagger]c-c^\\\\dagger[a,c]\\\\right)\\\\mathrm{d}t-\\\\sqrt{\\\\gamma}\\\\left([a,c^\\\\dagger]\\\\mathrm{d}B(t)-\\\\mathrm{d}B^\\\\dagger(t)[a,c]\\\\right)\\\\,. This differential equation is interpreted as defining the system operator a as the quantum Stratonovich integral of the right hand side, and is in the same form as the Langevin equation ().  Relation between Itô and Stratonovich integrals  The two definitions of quantum stochastic integrals relate to one another in the following way, assuming a bath with N defined as before: :(\\\\mathbf{S})\\\\int_{t_0}^tg(t^\\\\prime)\\\\mathrm{d}B(t^\\\\prime)=(\\\\mathbf{I})\\\\int_{t_0}^tg(t^\\\\prime)\\\\mathrm{d}B(t^\\\\prime)+\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sqrt{\\\\gamma}N\\\\int_{t_0}^t\\\\mathrm{d}t^\\\\prime\\\\,[g(t^\\\\prime),c(t^\\\\prime)]\\\\,.  Calculus rules  Just as with classical stochastic calculus, the appropriate product rule can be derived for Itô and Stratonovich integration, respectively: :(\\\\mathbf{I})\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}(ab)=a\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}b+b\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}a+\\\\mathrm{d}a\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}b\\\\,, :(\\\\mathbf{S})\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}(ab)=a\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}b+\\\\mathrm{d}a\\\\,b\\\\,. As is the case in classical stochastic calculus, the Stratonovich form is the one which preserves the ordinary calculus (which in this case is noncommuting). A peculiarity in the quantum generalization is the necessity to define both Itô and Stratonovitch integration in order to prove that the Stratonovitch form preserves the rules of noncommuting calculus.  Quantum trajectories  Quantum trajectories can generally be thought of as the path through Hilbert space that the state of a quantum system traverses over time. In a stochastic setting, these trajectories are often conditioned upon measurement results. The unconditioned Markovian evolution of a quantum system (averaged over all possible measurement outcomes) is given by a Lindblad equation. In order to describe the conditioned evolution in these cases, it is necessary to unravel the Lindblad equation by choosing a consistent . In the case where the conditioned system state is always pure, the unraveling could be in the form of a stochastic Schrödinger equation (SSE). If the state may become mixed, then it is necessary to use a stochastic master equation (SME).  Example unravelings  Plot of the evolution of the z-component of the Bloch vector of a two-level atom coupled to the electromagnetic field undergoing damped Rabi oscillations. The top plot shows the quantum trajectory for the atom for photon-counting measurements performed on the electromagnetic field, the middle plot shows the same for homodyne detection, and the bottom plot compares the previous two measurement choices (each averaged over 32 trajectories) with the unconditioned evolution given by the master equation. Consider the following Lindblad master equation for a system interacting with a vacuum bath: :\\\\dot{\\\\rho}=\\\\mathcal{D}[c]\\\\rho-i[H_\\\\mathrm{sys},\\\\rho]\\\\,. This describes the evolution of the system state averaged over the outcomes of any particular measurement that might be made on the bath. The following describes the evolution of the system conditioned on the results of a continuous photon- counting measurement performed on the bath: :\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\rho_I(t)=\\\\left(\\\\mathrm{d}N(t)\\\\mathcal{G}[c]-\\\\mathrm{d}t\\\\mathcal{H}[iH_\\\\mathrm{sys}+\\\\frac{1}{2}c^\\\\dagger c]\\\\right)\\\\rho_I(t)\\\\,, where :\\\\begin{array}{rcl} \\\\mathcal{G}[r]\\\\rho & \\\\equiv & \\\\frac{r\\\\rho r^\\\\dagger}{\\\\operatorname{Tr}[r\\\\rho r^\\\\dagger]}-\\\\rho \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathcal{H}[r]\\\\rho & \\\\equiv & r\\\\rho+\\\\rho r^\\\\dagger-\\\\operatorname{Tr}[r\\\\rho+\\\\rho r^\\\\dagger]\\\\rho \\\\end{array} are nonlinear superoperators and N(t) is the photocount, indicating how many photons have been detected at time t and giving the following jump probability: :\\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\mathrm{d}N(t)]=\\\\mathrm{d}t\\\\operatorname{Tr}[c^\\\\dagger c\\\\rho_I(t)]\\\\,, where \\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\cdot] denotes the expected value. Another type of measurement that could be made on the bath is homodyne detection, which results in quantum trajectories given by the following : :\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\rho_J(t)=-i[H_\\\\mathrm{sys},\\\\rho_J(t)]\\\\mathrm{d}t+\\\\mathrm{d}t\\\\mathcal{D}[c]\\\\rho_J(t)+\\\\mathrm{d}W(t)\\\\mathcal{H}[c]\\\\rho_J(t)\\\\,, where \\\\mathrm{d}W(t) is a Wiener increment satisfying: :\\\\begin{array}{rcl} \\\\mathrm{d}W(t)^2 & = & \\\\mathrm{d}t \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\mathrm{d}W(t)] & = & 0\\\\,. \\\\end{array} Although these two s look wildly different, calculating their expected evolution shows that they are both indeed unravelings of the same Lindlad master equation: :\\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\rho_I(t)]=\\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\rho_J(t)]=\\\\dot{\\\\rho}\\\\mathrm{d}t\\\\,.  Computational considerations  One important application of quantum trajectories is reducing the computational resources required to simulate a master equation. For a Hilbert space of dimension d, the amount of real numbers required to store the density matrix is of order d2, and the time required to compute the master equation evolution is of order d4. Storing the state vector for a , on the other hand, only requires an amount of real numbers of order d, and the time to compute trajectory evolution is only of order d2. The master equation evolution can then be approximated by averaging over many individual trajectories simulated using the , a technique sometimes referred to as the Monte Carlo wave-function approach. Although the number of calculated trajectories n must be very large in order to accurately approximate the master equation, good results can be obtained for trajectory counts much less than d2. Not only does this technique yield faster computation time, but it also allows for the simulation of master equations on machines that do not have enough memory to store the entire density matrix.

While exploring writing through essay contests and short stories, she also developed a love of music, and she became involved with musical theater, her local worship band, and a bell choir. Beck first explored songwriting in high school, in the form of remixing songs from her favorite artists by re-writing their lyrics and re- recording her own vocals using a karaoke machine. Beck graduated from UCLA with a degree in Film and Television, where she produced two short films, both of which she wrote the scores for.  Early career  While still in school at UCLA, Beck began teaching LSAT prep courses for Blueprint Prep, where she first received the nickname \\"Legally Blonde,\\" which would later turn into her writing persona \\"Lyrically Blonde.\\" After graduating, Beck began to pursue a career in screenwriting, and she took a position at Ten Thirteen Productions as assistant to Chris Carter (creator of \\"The X-Files\\").

History The influence traditional martial arts, Olympic wrestling and Brazilian jiu-jitsu have shaped MMA in Australia, along with the combat sports of Boxing and Kickboxing/Muay Thai. Between 1905-1914, Australian's witnessed a prizefighting novelty called \\"All-in\\" which started with \\"jiu jitsu\\" demonstrations and developed into a no-holds barred fighting phenomenon. One of the most notable participants was Sam McVea, an African- American heavyweight boxing champion who would participate in a highly publicised \\"all-in\\" fight in Lismore, Australia, against 'Prof.' Stevenson in 1913. However, the early hybrid didn't last and during most of the 20th century traditional martial arts schools and striking based gyms existed apart as with Amateur wrestling in Australia. Traditional martial arts in general are well attended and feature in the top ten organised sports for children, for both males and females, in Australia. In the 1990s the three grappling disciplines of BJJ, amateur wrestling and Shoot wrestling provided the base for the modern sport. Mixed Martial Arts, in its recognized and regulated form, came to Australia via the Ultimate Fighting Championship's emergence in 1993, but was predated by Vale tudo in Brasil and Catch wrestling in Japan. MMA gained an underground following through video and bootleg copies of UFC events in the mid 1990s. The explosion of BJJ globally, through Gracie BJJ schools, was assisted by the success of Royce Gracie at UFC 1-4, but BJJ was first introduced into Australia by John Will in 1989. Initially dedicated Australian practitioners travelled overseas to gain their belts and returned to start schools. Mixed Martial Arts training and gyms began to evolve. The long history of boxing and the more recent variant of kickboxing/Muay Thai in Australia provided a large injection of fighters with a striking base. The sport of MMA has been described as the fastest growing sport in the twenty first century. Sanctioning States and territories of Australia there are different sanctioning bodies and rules.

As a result of the school's refusal to participate in Shinto shrine worship, it was forced to shut down in 1937. Linton continued to seek the classification needed from the Japanese Government-General of Korea's Bureau of Education that would enable Korean students to continue their education without losing the opportunity to pursue higher education.Oh, S.

It was built in 1868-69 by the architect Philip Webb, on behalf of the artist George Price Boyce. It was extended in 1876 by Webb, and in 1901 by an unknown architect. Historic England have described West House as \\"one of the earliest examples of the Queen Anne Revival style\\". West House possesses one of the few triple-height ceilings in London. Residents The artist George Price Boyce lived at West House from 1870, and died there in 1897.The reason that there were three doors was because Trades people would enter one and models would enter another with the main door being for the family. After Boyce's death, Scottish artists James Guthrie (artist) and Edward Arthur Walton occupied West House. Guthrie, one of the Glasgow Boys, who were influenced by Impressionism and who used more realistic and contemporary themes than was usual in Victorian painting, both in his portraiture and landscapes, had his studios there. Walton was a painter of landscapes and portraits. The designer and academic Bernard Nevill bought the house in 1970 for about £80,000 (£ as of ). Nevil lived there until 2011. Nevill taught at Saint Martin's School of Art, and was Design Director for Liberty of London in the 1960s and 1970s. His paintings, furniture and furnishings, which appeared in the 1987 film Withnail and I were auctioned by Christie's in 2011, and were anticipated to total about £200,000. The sale total was actually £471,400. West House was bought by the French businessman François Pinault in 2011 for £20 million. In a subsequent planning application, Pinault proposed the \\"reinstatement of original features such as the main staircase\\", with the large studio to have new windows added. Additional proposals include the kitchen, bathrooms and bedrooms to be remodelled. In popular culture In the 1987 film Withnail and I (portrayed by Richard E. Grant and Paul McGann), the house is Withnail's flamboyantly gay Uncle Monty (Richard Griffiths)' London home.

Chorus For 'tis fish and tin and copper, boys, And Tre and Pol and Pen, And one and all we may rejoice That we are Cornishmen. Across the Tamar he had come, Though you might think it strange, And having left his Devon home Tried Cornwall for a change. Chorus Now when to Launceston he grew near, A-skipping o'er the sod, He spied a rustic cottage there With windows all abroad. Chorus And in the kitchen might be seen A dame with knife in hand, Who cut and slashed and chopped, I ween To make a pasty grand. Chorus \\"Good Mornin', Missus, what is that?\\" \\"Of all sorts, is a daub. 'Tis beef and mutton, pork and fat, Potatoes, leeks, and squab.\\" Chorus \\"A Cornish pasty, sure\\", says she, \\"And if thou doesn't mind, I soon shall start to cut up thee And put ye in, you'll find!\\" Chorus In fear he turned and straight did flee Across the Tamar green And since that day in Cornwall He has never more been seen! Chorus Fish and Tin and Copper is a traditional folk song/ballad associated with Cornwall, and dealing with the legend of the devil (\\"Old Nick\\") visiting Cornwall and being frightened away, fearing that he'd be made into a Cornish pasty filling.http://mudcat.org/thread.cfm?threadid=46418 It used to be said that the devil never came to Cornwall: he once reached Torpoint and immediately noticed that various kinds of pie were customary; he feared that devilly pie might be the next kind so returned to Devon.Croxford, Bob (1993) From Cornwall with Love. Mullion: Atmosphere; p. 8 (text quoted from Robert Hunt's Popular Romances of the West of England, 1865) The title comes from the three primary industries of Cornwall, Fish, Tin, and Copper. The reference to \\"Tre and Pol and Pen\\" comes from a famous reference to Tre Pol and Pen, \\"By Tre, Pol and Pen shall ye know all Cornishmen\\",Tre, Pol and Pen - The Cornish Family by Bernard Deacon a version of which was recorded by Richard Carew in his Survey of Cornwall, published in 1602.Richard Carew, The Survey of Cornwall (Page 48) Many Cornish surnames and place names still retain these words as prefixes.http://www.intocornwall.com/features/cornish_language.asp One famous version of the song was recorded by Brenda Wootton. Lowender Peran Dance In March 1998, the Cornish Traditional Dance Competition held a selection for a new dance to celebrate 20 years of Lowender Peran. The winning dance, choreographed by Jenny White for the Bolingey Troyl Band and Dancers, was set to the song Fish and Tin and Copper. The group had originally performed it as a demonstration dance at the opening ceremony of Lowender Peran in 1997. The chorus of the song inspired the use of traditional steps and patterns to represent these Cornish industries, including steps from the Newlyn Fisherman's Reel, followed by a chain (swimming fish), then the turning of wheels and cogs of the mines.http://www.an- daras.com/dance/d_danceindex_p_fishtincopper.htm References Cornish folk songs Cornish culture ","title":"Fish and Tin and Copper"},{"id":"41263993","text":"In computer security, general access control includes identification, authorization, authentication, access approval, and audit. A more narrow definition of access control would cover only access approval, whereby the system makes a decision to grant or reject an access request from an already authenticated subject, based on what the subject is authorized to access. Authentication and access control are often combined into a single operation, so that access is approved based on successful authentication, or based on an anonymous access token. Authentication methods and tokens include passwords, biometric scans, physical keys, electronic keys and devices, hidden paths, social barriers, and monitoring by humans and automated systems. Software entities In any access-control model, the entities that can perform actions on the system are called subjects, and the entities representing resources to which access may need to be controlled are called objects (see also Access Control Matrix). Subjects and objects should both be considered as software entities, rather than as human users: any human users can only have an effect on the system via the software entities that they control. Although some systems equate subjects with user IDs, so that all processes started by a user by default have the same authority, this level of control is not fine-grained enough to satisfy the principle of least privilege, and arguably is responsible for the prevalence of malware in such systems (see computer insecurity). In some models, for example the object-capability model, any software entity can potentially act as both subject and object. , access- control models tend to fall into one of two classes: those based on capabilities and those based on access control lists (ACLs). * In a capability-based model, holding an unforge-able reference or capability to an object provides access to the object (roughly analogous to how possession of one's house key grants one access to one's house); access is conveyed to another party by transmitting such a capability over a secure channel * In an ACL-based model, a subject's access to an object depends on whether its identity appears on a list associated with the object (roughly analogous to how a bouncer at a private party would check an ID to see if a name appears on the guest list); access is conveyed by editing the list. (Different ACL systems have a variety of different conventions regarding who or what is responsible for editing the list and how it is edited.) Both capability-based and ACL-based models have mechanisms to allow access rights to be granted to all members of a group of subjects (often the group is itself modeled as a subject). Services Access control systems provide the essential services of authorization, identification and authentication (I&A;), access approval, and accountability where: * authorization specifies what a subject can do * identification and authentication ensure that only legitimate subjects can log on to a system * access approval grants access during operations, by association of users with the resources that they are allowed to access, based on the authorization policy * accountability identifies what a subject (or all subjects associated with a user) did  Authorization  Authorization involves the act of defining access-rights for subjects. An authorization policy specifies the operations that subjects are allowed to execute within a system. Most modern operating systems implement authorization policies as formal sets of permissions that are variations or extensions of three basic types of access: * Read (R): The subject can ** Read file contents ** List directory contents * Write (W): The subject can change the contents of a file or directory with the following tasks: ** Add ** Update ** Delete ** Rename * Execute (X): If the file is a program, the subject can cause the program to be run. (In Unix-style systems, the \\"execute\\" permission doubles as a \\"traverse directory\\" permission when granted for a directory.) These rights and permissions are implemented differently in systems based on discretionary access control (DAC) and mandatory access control (MAC).  Identification and authentication  Identification and authentication (I&A;) is the process of verifying that an identity is bound to the entity that makes an assertion or claim of identity. The I&A; process assumes that there was an initial validation of the identity, commonly called identity proofing. Various methods of identity proofing are available, ranging from in-person validation using government issued identification, to anonymous methods that allow the claimant to remain anonymous, but known to the system if they return. The method used for identity proofing and validation should provide an assurance level commensurate with the intended use of the identity within the system. Subsequently, the entity asserts an identity together with an authenticator as a means for validation. The only requirements for the identifier is that it must be unique within its security domain. Authenticators are commonly based on at least one of the following four factors: * Something you know, such as a password or a personal identification number (PIN). This assumes that only the owner of the account knows the password or PIN needed to access the account. * Something you have, such as a smart card or security token. This assumes that only the owner of the account has the necessary smart card or token needed to unlock the account. * Something you are, such as fingerprint, voice, retina, or iris characteristics. * Where you are, for example inside or outside a company firewall, or proximity of login location to a personal GPS device.  Access approval  Access approval is the function that actually grants or rejects access during operations.Dieter Gollmann. Computer Security, 3rd ed. Wiley Publishing, 2011, p. 387, bottom During access approval, the system compares the formal representation of the authorization policy with the access request, to determine whether the request shall be granted or rejected. Moreover, the access evaluation can be done online/ongoing.Marcon, A.

The information recorded should be sufficient to map the subject to a controlling user. Audit trails and logs are important for * Detecting security violations * Re-creating security incidents If no one is regularly reviewing your logs and they are not maintained in a secure and consistent manner, they may not be admissible as evidence. Many systems can generate automated reports, based on certain predefined criteria or thresholds, known as clipping levels. For example, a clipping level may be set to generate a report for the following: * More than three failed logon attempts in a given period * Any attempt to use a disabled user account These reports help a system administrator or security administrator to more easily identify possible break-in attempts. Definition of clipping level: a disk's ability to maintain its magnetic properties and hold its content. A high-quality level range is 65–70%; low quality is below 55%.  Access controls  Access control models are sometimes categorized as either discretionary or non-discretionary. The three most widely recognized models are Discretionary Access Control (DAC), Mandatory Access Control (MAC), and Role Based Access Control (RBAC). MAC is non-discretionary.  Discretionary access control  Discretionary access control (DAC) is a policy determined by the owner of an object. The owner decides who is allowed to access the object, and what privileges they have. Two important concepts in DAC are * File and data ownership: Every object in the system has an owner. In most DAC systems, each object's initial owner is the subject that caused it to be created. The access policy for an object is determined by its owner. * Access rights and permissions: These are the controls that an owner can assign to other subjects for specific resources. Access controls may be discretionary in ACL-based or capability-based access control systems. (In capability-based systems, there is usually no explicit concept of 'owner', but the creator of an object has a similar degree of control over its access policy.)  Mandatory access control  Mandatory access control refers to allowing access to a resource if and only if rules exist that allow a given user to access the resource. It is difficult to manage, but its use is usually justified when used to protect highly sensitive information. Examples include certain government and military information. Management is often simplified (over what can be required) if the information can be protected using hierarchical access control, or by implementing sensitivity labels. What makes the method \\"mandatory\\" is the use of either rules or sensitivity labels. * Sensitivity labels: In such a system subjects and objects must have labels assigned to them. A subject's sensitivity label specifies its level of trust. An object's sensitivity label specifies the level of trust required for access. In order to access a given object, the subject must have a sensitivity level equal to or higher than the requested object. * Data import and export: Controlling the import of information from other systems and export to other systems (including printers) is a critical function of these systems, which must ensure that sensitivity labels are properly maintained and implemented so that sensitive information is appropriately protected at all times. Two methods are commonly used for applying mandatory access control: * Rule-based (or label-based) access control: This type of control further defines specific conditions for access to a requested object. A Mandatory Access Control system implements a simple form of rule-based access control to determine whether access should be granted or denied by matching: ** An object's sensitivity label ** A subject's sensitivity label * Lattice-based access control: These can be used for complex access control decisions involving multiple objects and/or subjects. A lattice model is a mathematical structure that defines greatest lower-bound and least upper-bound values for a pair of elements, such as a subject and an object. Few systems implement MAC; XTS-400 and SELinux are examples of systems that do.  Role-based access control  Role-based access control (RBAC) is an access policy determined by the system, not by the owner. RBAC is used in commercial applications and also in military systems, where multi-level security requirements may also exist. RBAC differs from DAC in that DAC allows users to control access to their resources, while in RBAC, access is controlled at the system level, outside of the user's control. Although RBAC is non-discretionary, it can be distinguished from MAC primarily in the way permissions are handled. MAC controls read and write permissions based on a user's clearance level and additional labels. RBAC controls collections of permissions that may include complex operations such as an e-commerce transaction, or may be as simple as read or write. A role in RBAC can be viewed as a set of permissions. Three primary rules are defined for RBAC: #Role assignment: A subject can execute a transaction only if the subject has selected or been assigned a suitable role. #Role authorization: A subject's active role must be authorized for the subject. With rule 1 above, this rule ensures that users can take on only roles for which they are authorized. #Transaction authorization: A subject can execute a transaction only if the transaction is authorized for the subject's active role. With rules 1 and 2, this rule ensures that users can execute only transactions for which they are authorized. Additional constraints may be applied as well, and roles can be combined in a hierarchy where higher-level roles subsume permissions owned by lower-level sub-roles. Most IT vendors offer RBAC in one or more products.  Attribute-based access control  In attribute-based access control (ABAC),Jin, Xin, Ram Krishnan, and Ravi Sandhu. \\"A unified attribute-based access control model covering dac, mac and rbac.\\" Data and Applications Security and Privacy XXVI. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2012. 41–55. access is granted not based on the rights of the subject associated with a user after authentication, but based on attributes of the user. The user has to prove so-called claims about his attributes to the access control engine. An attribute-based access control policy specifies which claims need to be satisfied in order to grant access to an object. For instance the claim could be \\"older than 18\\". Any user that can prove this claim is granted access. Users can be anonymous when authentication and identification are not strictly required. One does, however, require means for proving claims anonymously. This can for instance be achieved using anonymous credentials. XACML (extensible access control markup language) is a standard for attribute- based access control. XACML 3.0 was standardized in January 2013.eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) V3.0 approved as an OASIS Standard, eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) V3.0 approved as an OASIS Standard.  Break-Glass Access Control Models  Traditionally, access has the purpose of restricting access, thus most access control models follow the \\"default deny principle\\", i.e. if a specific access request is not explicitly allowed, it will be denied. This behavior might conflict with the regular operations of a system. In certain situations, humans are willing to take the risk that might be involved in violating an access control policy, if the potential benefit that can be achieved outweighs this risk. This need is especially visible in the health-care domain, where a denied access to patient records can cause the death of a patient. Break-Glass (also called break-the- glass) try to mitigate this by allowing users to override access control decision. Break-Glass can either be implemented in an access control specific manner (e.g. into RBAC), or generic (i.e., independent from the underlying access control model). Access control based on the responsibility In Aligning Access Rights to Governance Needs with the Responsibility MetaModel (ReMMo) in the Frame of Enterprise Architecture an expressive responsibility metamodel has been defined and allows representing the existing responsibilities at the business layer and, thereby, allows engineering the access rights required to perform these responsibilities, at the application layer. A method has been proposed to define the access rights more accurately, considering the alignment of the responsibility and RBAC.

The band established a unique \\"shaman punk\\" or \\"psychedelic hardcore” sound, and is regarded as one of the most important alternative bands of the 1980s from the Eastern European block. Permanent restrictions by Hungarian authorities made worldwide tours difficult for the band, but its ecstatic concerts garnered surprising success across Western Europe. Though relatively obscure and commercially limited outside of Eastern Europe, Maximumrocknroll described the band as \\"equal in spirit and grit to faves like Sonic Youth or Big Black but with an identity all its own”.Maximum Rock’N Roll (USA), July 1991, #98 VHK has been praised as a highly important band by Iggy Pop, Henry Rollins, Jello Biafra and Einstürzende Neubauten. The band played repetitive, wild, yet melodic music, combining tribal shamanic music with rock guitars and drumming to form a uniquely pulsating and obsessive sound. Songs regularly feature ritualistic improvisation, and live shows were often accompanied by ecstatic on-stage actions. The New York Times described their music as \\"basic and elemental and filled with obsessive, galvanizing passion.\\" The band's musical philosophy was shaped and influenced by its frontman, Attila Grandpierre. Beginning in 2005, Grandpierre continued VHK's concept with Vágtázó Csodaszarvas on solely acoustic instruments.  History  Galloping Coroners (VHK) was formed in Budapest in 1975 by Atilla Grandpierre (singer) and his friends independently from Western world's punk movement that started 1–2 years later. Initial lineup: Atilla Grandpierre (vocal), Sándor Czakó (guitar), László Ipacs (drums), Tamás Pócs (bass guitar), Molnár György (solo guitar). More of them were graduated professionals: The group's leader and main theoretician, Atilla Grandpierre is also astrophysicist, a candidate of physical sciences, employed by the Hungarian Mathematics Institute. Guitarist Sándor Czakó is nuclear physicist, later worked on safety system of Paks Nuclear Power Plant,Documentary film: Private Rock History / 47. - Vágtázó Halottkémek - VHK, ed. Gábor Gellért, 2009 László Ipacs is a physicists, Lajos Soós teacher.  Formation  In early 70's, Budapest youngsters were talking stories about a mysterious, eccentric teenage boy, Attila Grandpierre, who was doing scandalous actions with his friends e.g. creating home-made rockets etc. As a physicstudent Grandpierre gave private lessons to the 5 year younger high-school student, László Ipacs. Grandpierre and Ipacs's mates become friends, and formed a subcultural creative community mainly driven by Grandpierres unconvenient visions of life and music. When Ipacs and his friend Sándor Czakó the only educated musician, formed an amateur band, Grandpierre first just helped the band with musical ideas as an external consultant. Surprisingly they won army's countrywide amateur rock contest. By that time Grandpierre as a well- known personality of Budapest underground life was invited to be singer by several amateur bands. But he was only impressed enough by the Ipacs-Czakó formation, so he joined the band in 1975. The band started to use Vágtázó Halottkémek (abbr.: VHK, Eng.: Galloping Coroners) name suggested by Grandpierre. As Grandpierre remembers, he wanted a name that express their musical and life philosophy regarding that \\"people should find their way to the basic, elemental natural power of the Universe and being charged with this power should live a more perfect and active life.\\" He felt it must be a two word band name. First, 'Galloping' tag was to express the activity, energy. The second tag took longer to find out, finally they found that 'Coroners' express greatly their feeling that people on the Earth live on a very basic level, almost like 'living deads', and the band is like the Coroners who say the diagnosis of this state.  Underground years in late Hungarian communist era  In 1975 the band recorded their first songs. They aroused their first public acclaim among Budapest teenagers when bandmates walked along Váci Street playing VHK on cassette recorder demonstratively. VHK gave the first concert at a high-school event in 1976. The concert was stopped after 20 minutes by event supervisor singing-teacher finding the band and the audience too excited and scandalous. Fans had to wait 2 years for next concert. In 1978 the concert again was stopped because the organizers were afraid about the allegedly 'violent consequences'. Next 6 concerts were also interrupted by the authorities. In Soviet-block, Goulash-communist Hungary Galloping Coroners' extatic music was extremely scandalous sound vs. state controlled music scene. Though VHK didn't play political songs, authorities were afraid of a band that seemed to have 'subversive effect on youths'. VHK soon became the No.1 banned rock band and had been officially banished within Hungary for 11 years. Members were harassed by the police, observed by the secret agent net and not allowed to release an LP and make concerts legally. So in the seventies VHK had only few concerts, still the band continuously found ways to play underground concerts at various scenes. Vágtázó Halottkémek was helped to the stage by the fans of other bands, or there were concert-organizers taking the risk to be kicked out because of allowing them play. They used fake names, played as guest musicians of other bands without revelealing themselves as VHK at the concert. Due to this concerts and fan-made cassette recordings VHK's fame spread rapidly among youth communities in Budapest. By the end of 70's VHK gained countrywide reputation among youths regarded as „the wildest band in Hungary”. Experimental film director Gábor Bódy recognised VHK for his 1983 film “Dog’s Night Song” featuring the band and lead howler Attila Grandpierre as an actor. International success from 1980s VHK had no LP and forbidden to concert within Hungary, but by the 80's the band's fame reached Western Europe, first Germany through personal channels. In Gábor Bódy movie \\"Nachtlied des Hundes\\" (1983) the West-Berlin artist, author and philosopher Wolfgang Müller from the cult-band Die Tödliche Doris discover the band and invited them to West-Berlin, where they were totally unknown. The band played 1984 in Berlin-Kreuzberg Frontkino, which was already a famous underground space.Wolfgang Müller, Subkultur Westberlin 1979 - 1989.Freizeit, S. 84 - 87 Now they started to build a growing fan-base in Germany. In 1981 the first VHK song was published on a German Ata Tak's Fix Planet compilation LP. From 1984 VHK played regularly in Western-Europe, despite Hungarian authorities tried to obstruct administratively, not giving passport to VHK's members to get concerts in Western-Europe. In 1986 VHK was invited to Amsterdam, that was \\"Cultural Capital of Europe\\" in that year. Dutch Queen, Beatrix should have personally pressure Hungarian authorities to give passports and allow band's performance. In 1987 Austrian chancellor, Fred Sinowatz also had to make diplomatic steps toward the Hungarian Ministry of Culture to leave VHK play in Austria. In 1982 Kristen Dehlholm avantgarde theatre director and VHK-related artists founded 'VHK's Ritual Theatre' accompanying concerts with movement and sound theatre elements. Thanks to this 1988 VHK played in the Mythen, Monstren and Mutationen festival in Berlin. In 1988 Einstürzende Neubauten, Henry Rollins, Jello Biafra and Iggy Pop met VHK and all of them were impressed by VHK's obsessive performance. In the last years before the collapse of Hungarian communist soft regime, VHK played with Rollins Band in Hungary. Rollins Band invited VHK for a tour in England in 1989. In 1992 they released their 3'rd LP \\"Hammering on the Gates of Nothingness\\" both in Europe and the US. LP's title song reached 2nd position on the top-list of a Belgian music radio station, and VHK were played in numerous US college radios. First international manager of the band was Dietmar Lupfer. VHK released with him their first 3 records, Teach Death a Lesson (1988), Jump Out the World- Instinct (1990), Hammering on the Gates of Nothingness (1992) at Sonic Boom Records for Europe, while this LP's were released by Alternative Tentacles in the US. Despite Jello Biafra's offer to manage the band in the US, the band decided to leave Alternative Tentacles and produce next LP in USA themselves, but VHK's self-promotion has failed.  2001 and beyond  Between 2001-2009 VHK didn't give concerts. From 2005 band leader Atilla Grandpierre continued VHK's musical concept in neotraditional Vágtázó Csodaszarvas (\\"Galloping Wonder Stag\\"), changing electronic instruments into traditional Hungarian acoustic folk instruments, developed a clear, modern still ancient style. In 2009 Grandpierre renewed VHK, releasing Forgószél! (\\"Tornado!\\") LP, under \\"Galloping Life Power\\" band name. The \\"Coroners\\" tag was changed to \\"Life Power\\" to express more directly Grandpierre's fully positive life attitude, as he said. Later they started to use Galloping Coroners band name again and released Bite the Stars! LP in 2012. Atilla Grandpierre is still active nowadays, occasionally touring with Galloping Wonder Stag playing acoustic repertoire and with Galloping Coroners performing the rock-instrumental line.  Musical style  In 1975 Galloping Coroners started with basic rock instruments, 3 electronic guitars and drum, enriched with a kettle drum to enhance roaming tribal sound. By the 90's VHK kept their psychedelic-shaman- punk musical ideology while their music developed to a more complex instrumentation. On 1997 Requenquering The Eden I LP they used tablas, kettle drums, roto, earthen drum, acoustic guitar, reed pipe, whistle, percussion, bass, electric guitar, vocals with guests adding violin, flute, double bass, hurdy gurdy and vocals. This trend got its peak point with full acoustic performances of Galloping Wonder Stag, Grandpierre's later formation from 2005. Galloping Coroners, including their international career have sung exclusively Hungarian lyrics. Galloping Coroners' music may best describe as „shaman punk” or „psychedelic hardcore” - new categories created by western critics in the '80s to define the original sound of the band. Historically Galloping Coroners started 1–2 years before punk movement in 1975, from independent roots. Galloping Coroners' music was mainly determined by band founder Atilla Grandpierre vision of music and the Universe. He said, he was not interested in music like western punk bands, Iggy & The Stooges and others. He was impressed by psychedelic, progressive rock music. „I liked very much early Pink Floyd\\", especially the See Emily Play \\"and first Blue Cheer album, Vincebus Eruptum. The most important song for me was Out of Focus.\\" He was also influenced by German progressive rock, krautrock (early Amon Düül, Popol Vuh, Ash Ra Tempel). As Grandpierre remembers the first years \\"We had no idea that our music had any connection with shamanism. [...] We didn't know what had bursted out from us, our friends just said, 'it's total craziness'. [...] Our definite goal was to become the world's best band [...] we talked along many nights how to make a world revolution [...]. In the morning we started the day with bright eyes and feeling huge forces lit in us. [...] We felt, we are able to change course of the world, and there must be a music that can move deeper powers any social movement can.\\" Later, when punk movement developed Galloping Coroners recognized common points with punk and hardcore, as Grandpierre expressed in his manifesto Punk As a Rebirth of Shamanist Folk Music in 1984, and VHK built connections and toured with punk and hardcore bands like Rollins Band. Some critics regarding tribal shamanic music as an ancient form of folk music suggest to use ethno punk definition and regard VHK's shaman punk as a subgenre of folk punk. But while folk punk groups include national folk elements in their punk music, VHK's repetitive, extatic sound with distorted guitars and inarticulated howls in vocal is much closer to hardcore or even industrial rock. In contrast with aggressive, angry, anti-establishment, direct protest features of punk and hardcore, VHK's unrestrained dynamism is rather a positive, extatic, sublimed and transcendent often with harmonious tones in lead vocals over the repetitive base rhythm their mission to express \\"world instinct\\". \\"The VHK is definitively the best from the East. The Coroners are a musical excess, a 50 minutes trance. They are insane drums, overmodulated guitars, screaming Shamans.\\" - NMI Messitsch (Germany), 08/92 Vágtázó Halottkémek themselves describe their music as \\"an instinctive primeval music liberating the elementary powers of nature creating ourselves and revolting to its high completion in a free spontaneity and overwhelming energy.\\" VHK played pre-written songs as a basis, exposed with improvisations and instinctive physical performances on stage, with an open end to a total extatic state \\"liberating the deepest musical creative power\\". Grandpierre said \\"Improvisation is not the correct word to describe our music. At our best, we are in touch with life-completing, primordial powers and our attempt is to hand over the control of our musical activities to these powers.\\" VHK's music referred to by many as shamanistic ethno or psychedelic hardcore, Band leader Attila Grandpierre explains this as \\"an unrestricted outburst of life energy\\" that is not only a music but an attitude to grasp the essence of life with our deepest nature and let it grow by its own laws. The group says: \\"it is a magical folk-music, a cosmic vision about the role of earthly life on the destination of the Universe.” This approach is expressed in LP titles like Jump Out the World-Instinct (1990) or Hammering on the Gates of Nothingness (1992). \\"The songs of VHK are growing towards a dreamlike ecstasy coming from the heart, the usual song-structure and singing style are completely missing, the magic dance-rhythm captures and raptures the audience, which you can not find in the today’s stylised neon-coolness only at the natural tribes living in other era. Permanent rhythm-accelerations, abrupt speeding-up of the almost brutal-ancient drums, amorphous collage of the head- voices, animal voice playbacks and volcanically exploding guitar riffs - all these things are completed with an unconsciousness jungle of sounds in which you get lost and cannot come back easily, since the perception of time and space is changing into completely new forms.\\" - Zitty Berlin, fanzine, 1988, Nr. 14 „Each time I hear a new VHK record I relive this atavistic reverie - it's like reentering the womb. VHK are so improbable, so wonderful and yet so seemingly necessary (were they not to exist they would have to be invented), that they function for me like my favorite fairy tales used to when I was a kid. When I first discovered their 1988 LP \\"Teach Death a Lesson\\", I was bowled over by its combination of monastic psychedelia, rock 'n roll codpiece swagger and sheer alien abduction logical completeness, this wondering is with me yet. VHK sound like they 're from another world and another time.” - Bananafish, San Francisco fanzine, 1995, No. 10  Live Performance  Galloping Coroners concerts were well-known for extatic performances where trans involved also the audience. Concerts in first Hungarian underground period in the 70's usually ended up scandalously finally interrupted by authorities. In 80's VHK continued their impulsive, high-energy live performances in Western Europe: „As the singer spins around inside the band's mesmeric voodoo howl like whirling dervish the effect is almost hypnotizing. Incredible. Watching them play in Cologne, I was fascinated, not just by the band's performance (which was amazing) but by the frenzied reaction of the crowd. Seeing VHK, I realized just what a dangerous proposition rock'n roll can be.” - Melody Maker (U. K.), September 26, 1992 On concerts they regularly danced in ancient, tribal, shamanic costumes of leather and feathers, using backdrops like an Inuit design they copied from Siberian art. VHK's concerts often contained extatic physical performances, e.g. band members tumbled in honey and feather in extatic state playing frenzy feather-covered the whole concert. or hanging fishes on their bodies and jumping into a fishing net fastened on the stage. Frontman Grandpierre recalls a concert when he had been injured on stage in extatic state, he continued to perform bleeding, ended the concert with significant blood loss.  Legacy  Due to the band's East- European geopolitical situation, the banned, underground status of the first 9-10 years in Hungary, the late and obstructed getting out to the Western European music market, VHK haven't reached a worldwide, global international band status. As explained in Forced ExposureForced Exposure, # 16, 1990 \\"Had this [VHK] LP come in '73 in a tiny enough press run, it would be one of the most legendary 'lost' record of that decade.\\" Critics and fellow musicians celebrated Galloping Coroners as a highly important brand of the time. Maximum Rock’N Roll (USA) told the band „equal in spirit and grit to faves like Sonic Youth or Big Black but with an identity all its own”. VHK is admired as highly important band by Iggy Pop, Henry Rollins, Jello Biafra (Dead Kennedys) and Einstürzende Neubauten. Danish fanzine, Moshable summarized in 1995: \\"This band have been around for many years now and have played almost everywhere in Europe but still they remain one of Europe’s best kept secret.

When the bulk of the army was disbanded in May 1653, he was chosen, along with Colonel Sadleir, Major Morgan and Vincent Gookin as the Trustees to carry out the assigning confiscated lands to the army for arrears of pay. His own arrears were satisfied in the barony of Moyfenrath, but led to a legal dispute with Dr Henry Jones. After capturing Nenagh Castle in 1650, Abbot was appointed the military governor of it and appears to have made it his main dwelling from then until the Restoration. Abbot was the second member for the counties Tipperary and Waterford in Second Protectorate Parliament which sat from 17 September 1656 until 4 February 1658. On 16 November 1658, Abbot was knighted at Dublin Castle by Henry Cromwell; Lord Deputy of Ireland. Abbot was suspected of being opposed to the Restoration and in 1663 he took part in Blood's Plot to upset the Government. A reward of £100 was offered for his apprehension, but he managed to escape.

Romney had previously been served by Romney Academy, but by 1831 the school had outgrown its facilities. The Virginia General Assembly permitted the Romney Literary Society to raise funds for a new school through a lottery. On December 12, 1846, the assembly established the school and empowered the society with its operation. From 1846 to 1849, the institute was directed by Presbyterian Reverend William Henry Foote, who had been a teacher and principal at Romney Academy. In 1849, when the Romney Literary Society revamped the operating code and bylaws for the institute, Foote took offense; he established a rival school, Potomac Seminary, the next year. Professor E. J. Meany succeeded Foote, and was followed by eventual West Virginia governor John Jeremiah Jacob in 1851. Presbyterian Reverend Joseph Nelson replaced Jacob in 1853 and purchased the institute in 1861. The Romney Literary Society and the Romney Classical Institute went on hiatus during the American Civil War. Nelson revived the school and was succeeded in 1866 by William C. Clayton, who later served in the West Virginia Senate; the institute was disestablished shortly thereafter. In 1870, the reorganized Romney Literary Society transferred the institute's building and grounds to the state of West Virginia for the approved West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind. The schools opened on September 29, 1870, and are still in operation today. In addition to Jacob and Clayton, Robert White, Attorney General of West Virginia, was an alumnus of the institute. Background Prior to the establishment of the Romney Classical Institute in 1846, Romney and its environs had been served by a school as early as 1752 and by Romney Academy, which was incorporated by the Virginia General Assembly on January 11, 1814. By 1831, Romney Academy had outgrown its facilities in an old stone building just north of the Hampshire County Courthouse. Around this time, several academies in present-day West Virginia were aspiring to provide a college-level education, as there were few post-secondary institutions in the region prior to the American Civil War. To remedy this issue and improve educational opportunities for local children, the Romney Literary Society began an initiative to raise funds to construct a new school building. On January 6, 1832, the Virginia General Assembly authorized the society to raise $20,000 through a lottery. The society made arrangements with James Gregory of Jersey City and Daniel McIntyre of Philadelphia to finance the lottery, \\"for raising a sum of money not exceeding twenty thousand dollars, for the purpose of erecting a suitable building for their accommodation, the purchase of library and Philosophical apparatus.\\" The lottery was conducted over a ten- year period, and sums of $750, $1,000, and $1,500 were to be raised in semiannual installments. Construction and establishment The Romney Literary Society raised the necessary funds by 1845. On April 4, 1845, the society solicited for contractor bids, which were submitted by May 24. On that date, the land was deeded for the new school. Construction began that year, and the building and its grounds cost approximately $8,000 to complete. According to an 1845 bid advertisement, the institute was planned as a brick building, and in height from the foundation. Plans also called for a tin roof to \\"be surmounted by a cupola.\\" The bid advertisement also stated that the end of the building was to be the main façade, which was to be embellished with a \\"handsome portico the whole width of the house.\\" The committee for the school building's construction, which consisted of E. M. Armstrong, John B. Kercheval, and David Gibson signed this advertisement. On December 12, 1846, the Virginia General Assembly further empowered the Romney Literary Society: \\"To establish at or near the town of Romney a Seminary of Learning for the instruction of youth in various branches of science and literature; and the Society may appropriate to the same such portion of the property which it now has or may acquire, as it may deem expedient.\\" Following the passage of this act, the Romney Classical Institute was formally established. That same year, the new two-story brick educational building was completed and the society's library and classes were relocated there. The completed building measured , with an additional wing that served as principal's residence. The society used the second story of the building, which was divided into two rooms: a hall for society meetings and a hall for its library. Only society members, Romney clergy, and the institute's principal were given library privileges; each were provided with keys to visit the library at any time. Growth From its foundation, the Romney Classical Institute was a coeducational collegiate preparatory school. The institute operated first under the principalship of Presbyterian minister the Reverend William Henry Foote, who had been a teacher and principal at Romney Academy. He served as the school's principal until 1849. Theology was one of the courses taught at the institute under Foote's leadership. In 1849, the Romney Literary Society established a new operating code for the institute, and a new system of bylaws for the governance of the school, which empowered the society to appoint teachers, fix salaries, and provide conditions of payment. Foote took this new code as a criticism of his leadership, and he resigned. In 1850, Foote founded a rival institution known as the Potomac Seminary. Foote raised the necessary funds and a brick building for the seminary was constructed approximately north of the institute building. John Jeremiah Jacob served as the institute's principal from 1851 until 1853. He later served as the first Democratic Governor of West Virginia. The society selected Professor E. J. Meany to head the institute following Foote's departure. Meany's assistant principals were John Jeremiah Jacob, Mrs. Meany, and Miss Kern. Jacob had attended both the institute and its predecessor, Romney Academy, and later served as West Virginia's first Democratic governor. Meany remained principal of the institute until at least 1851. Following his graduation from Dickinson College in 1849, Jacob became the institute's assistant principal under Meany. He became the school's principal in 1851 and served in that position until 1853, during which time he taught classes and practiced law. Jacob was still serving as the school's principal in May 1853 when he placed an advertisement for the school's summer session in May 1853 in Romney's South Branch Intelligencer newspaper. While the school operated under the leadership of the Romney Literary Society, the institute established its own literary organization known as the Phrena Kosmian Society. On November 15, 1850, the Phrena Kosmian Society debated the question, \\"Would the Southern States be justified in seceding from the Confederacy under present circumstances?\\" There are no existing records of the debate's conclusion. Romney attorney Andrew Wodrow Kercheval delivered an address to the society on April 3, 1851, which was later printed at the office of the Virginia Argus and Hampshire Advertiser that year. In 1850, the Virginia House of Delegates amended the act of December 12, 1846, establishing the school, and empowered the governor of Virginia to appoint the institute's Board of Visitors. The following year on March 1, 1851, the Virginia House of Delegates rejected John Kern, Jr. and other Board of Visitors members' petition to amend the institute's charter. In 1853, the Romney Literary Society received an endowment of $20,000, and possessed a permanent fund of $12,000, which yielded $720 per year. Half of this yield was used to support the institute, including the purchase of textbooks. These figures remained the same in 1859. According to its May 1853 advertisement in the Virginia Argus and Hampshire Advertiser, the institute provided instruction to the following grades during its summer session: fifth grade for $5, fourth grade for $8, third grade for $10, second grade for $12, and first grade (its highest grade) for $15. Boarding, including laundry, meals, and lighting, was $45, and music lessons with use of the piano were $25. An additional fee of 25 cents was charged if a student was suspended. The institute's Primary Department taught the fifth grade, and lessons included spelling, reading and elementary arithmetic. The fourth grade was taught by the institute's Junior Department and included courses in writing and preparatory English grammar and geography. The English Department instructed the third grade and offered studies in geography and English; and the second grade was also taught by the English Department with courses in history and natural philosophy. First grade, the school's highest, was instructed by the Classical and Mathematical Department and offered studies in Greek, Latin, French, geometry, algebra, trigonometry, surveying, mensuration, navigation, astronomy, and bookkeeping. According to an advertisement for a female teacher in the Baltimore Sun on November 9, 1853, William C. Clayton was serving as the institute's principal by late 1853. Clayton stated in the advertisement that the institute was seeking an experienced female teacher to lead the school's Female Department. The candidate for the female teacher was to be qualified to teach French, English, and music. Later in 1853, Reverend Joseph Nelson became principal, and he continued to serve in this capacity, and preach in the school's chapel, until the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861. By spring 1857, the institute had a Male Department led by C. S. Hurt and a Female Department led by Mrs. M. R. Schenk, with Andrew Wodrow Kercheval serving as secretary pro tempore of its Board of Visitors. In December 1859, John Kern, Jr., was the secretary of the school's Board of Visitors, and the institute advertised the position of principal, and received applications until January 5, 1860. In the school's December 1859 advertisements in the Richmond Dispatch, the institute sought \\"a gentleman well qualified to teach the classics thoroughly, whose lady could teach French and music, would be preferred.\\" At this point, the institute had 50 students. Nelson's replacement was expected to take charge by February 1860. Though Nelson had purportedly accepted a position in Mississippi, there are no records to indicate that he left his post prior to the American Civil War. By February 1861, Nelson had purchased the institute and its buildings from the Romney Literary Society, thus becoming its sole manager and proprietor as president. At this time, courses were offered during sessions lasting five months and the following fees were charged per grades: $16 for the Highest Grade, $12 for the Intermediate Grade, $8 for the Lowest Grade, $5 for Ancient Languages, and $5 for Modern Languages. Hiatus and final years The institute and the society both continued to grow in importance until the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861. After the war began, the institute's professors and older students joined the Confederate States Army and other Confederate partisan groups, and the institute and the society experienced a hiatus. The Romney Literary Society's library suffered significant losses during the war, and by the war's end in 1865, only about 400 volumes of its once large 3,000-volume library could be located. Many of the society's members never returned from the war, and those who did were too weary and discouraged at first to revive the society or the Romney Classical Institute. Following the war in August 1865, Nelson attempted to resurrect the institute and submitted an advertisement to the Civilian & Telegraph newspaper in Cumberland, Maryland, in which he billed the institute as \\"A Male and Female Boarding and Day School.\\" The institute opened on the first Monday in September 1865 for its fall and winter session. According to Nelson's advertisement, \\"parents desiring for their children a sound English, Classical and Mathematical Education would do well to patronize this School.\\" Student education was divided into three levels: the Lowest Grade level for $10 for a five-month session, Intermediate level for $15, and the Highest level for $20. Latin and Greek each cost an additional $5 per quarter. Boarding at the school cost $3 per week; however, laundry, fuel, and lighting were not included in this fee. Music lessons were also taught \\"at Professor's charges.\\" In 1866, William C. Clayton became the institute's principal and presided over the school for a few more terms. Like his predecessor John Jeremiah Jacob, Clayton had been a student at both the Romney Academy and the institute. Clayton served in the West Virginia Senate following his tenure as principal. A Mr. Dinwiddie was also a teacher at the school after the war. Nelson relocated to Cumberland, where he was principal of Cumberland City Academy for five years. It is not known if he sold the institute. Disestablishment and legacy The institute's main building was later expanded and used as the administration building for the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind from 1870 until the present day. Despite the institute's effective disestablishment after 1866, a meeting was held on May 15, 1869, with nine original members of the Romney Literary Society: James L. Armstrong, David Entler, William Harper, John C. Heiskell, Andrew Wodrow Kercheval, Samuel R. Lupton, James Parsons, Alfred P. White, and Robert White. They set about expanding the society's membership rolls and reviving its library. Over the next few years, 20 younger members were added. By 1869, the state of West Virginia considered the establishment of a school for deaf and blind students. The newly reorganized Romney Literary Society sought to secure this school for Romney as part of its Reconstruction development efforts. On March 3, 1870, the West Virginia Legislature passed an act providing for the establishment of the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind. The society passed a resolution on April 12, 1870, by which it agreed to deed, free of cost, the institute's building and grounds to the state for the planned schools. On April 20, 1870, the society sent its members Robert White and Andrew Wodrow Kercheval to the then-state capital of Wheeling to offer \\"the grounds and buildings of the Romney Classical Institute... to the Board of Regents, free of debt, and in good repair\\" on the condition that the proposed institution be located at Romney. At the time of the society's offer, the institute's grounds consisted of . Offers for campus locations were also made by citizens of Clarksburg and Parkersburg. The central section (behind the portico) of the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind administration building is the original Romney Classical Institute building. The society's offer was the only one to include an extant building on its grounds. The Board of Regents accepted the society's offer, and a formal transfer of the Romney Classical Institute campus was made. During this process, the society discovered additional repairs were needed in order to satisfy the state's requirements. The society had to raise over $1,000 to adequately address these repairs, which was a difficult task during the economically-distressed Reconstruction Era. Following a resolution on July 11, 1870, to raise between $1,200 and $1,300, a subscription of $1,383.60 was raised after 118 individuals and firms donated the needed funds. Shortly thereafter, the property's formal transfer was completed. The institute's property was valued at about $20,000 at this time. The West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind opened on September 29, 1870, in the former Romney Classical Institute building, which provided space for administration offices, classrooms, and dormitories. Following the schools' subsequent expansions, the institute's former building became the center section of the administration building of the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind, which it remains as of 2018. Between 1871 and 1872, the schools added two wings to the old institute building, each measuring . Following the transfer of the institute's campus, the Romney Literary Society built a new building between 1869 and 1870, which became known as Literary Hall.  Alumni  The Romney Classical Institute educated several prominent educators, lawyers, military officers, politicians, and physicians. In West Virginia and Its People (1913), historians Thomas Condit Miller and Hu Maxwell averred that the Romney Classical Institute \\"exerted a great influence upon the educational work of the South Branch Valley.\\" As stated above, John Jeremiah Jacob was educated at the institute and served as its assistant principal and principal. He was later elected West Virginia's first Democratic governor. West Virginia state senator William C. Clayton also attended the school and served as its principal. Craig Woodrow McDonald, son of Angus William McDonald, attended the school in its early years of operation. Following his education there, he attended the Virginia Military Institute and the University of Virginia, then taught school in Culpeper County. During the American Civil War, McDonald served in the Confederate States Army as aide-de- camp to General Arnold Elzey and was killed in battle on May 29, 1862. Robert White attended the institute prior to serving as a law apprentice under his father John Baker White, Hampshire County Clerk of Court, and attending Lexington Law School. White later served as Attorney General of West Virginia. Prominent Western Maryland physician Dr. Bayard T. Keller received his primary education at Romney Classical Institute and afterward continued his studies at Allegany County Academy in Cumberland, the University of Maryland, and the Baltimore Infirmary and practiced medicine in nearby Grantsville and Oakland.

For example, a light could be a \\"producer\\" (server) and a switch a \\"consumer\\" (client). Each \\"producer\\" on the network has an XML file called introspection that is used to advertise the device's abilities and what it can be asked to do. It is possible to extend the AllJoyn framework's capabilities by bridging other protocols. Microsoft has added a technology called Device System Bridge that allows devices using home or building protocols such as Z-Wave and BACnet to appear on an AllJoyn network. Microsoft has integrated the AllJoyn runtime (standard client) and Router Node service in Windows 10. The system also has technology for audio streaming to multiple device sinks in a synchronized way. Source code of the AllJoyn framework is located in the AllJoyn Open Source Project's repositories AllJoyn Git. Details for all current projects are available at AllJoyn Wiki. Also there is a slack channel dedicated for developers discussion managed by both AllJoyn and third party developers. Services and APIs AllJoyn provides several services that can be integrated with its core. See detailed API Guide for further usage. * Onboarding Service: Provides a consistent way to bring (onboard) a new device onto Wi-Fi network. * Configuration Service: Allows one to configure certain attributes of a device, such as its friendly name, default language, passcode etc. * Notification Service: Allows text-based, audio and image (view URLs) notifications to be sent and received by other devices on the network. * Control Panel Service: Allows devices to advertise a virtual control panel to be controlled remotely. By using the Control Panel Service it is possible to manage AllJoyn devices with a single app. * Common Device Model (CDM) Service: Allows a common way of monitoring and managing internet of things devices, regardless of device manufacturers. CDM defines a model for each device. The former Home Appliances & Entertainment (HAE) service is merged in to the CDM Service as of AllJoyn 16.04 version.

Costley was born in Ireland to John and Anne Costley. Costley was known among the \\"old identities\\" of Auckland as a man of rather penurious and retiring habits, who had acquired property in the early days, which, with the growth of the city, had become of great value. Costley had arrived in Auckland around 1840, possibly coming on from Australia. He purchased property at a time when it was empty scrubland and as the town of Auckland grew he quietly expanded his landholdings. He never owned his own house preferring to board with friends, a married couple. On his deathbed he summoned his lawyer, and directed him to divide his wealth among the city charities, seven of these being named. The estate realised £93,000, which was divided between the Auckland Hospital, Old Men's Home, Sailors' Home, Auckland Institute, Costley Training Institute, Auckland Public Library, and the Parnell Orphan Home, each of which received £12,500. Smaller bequests were made to a range of other charities in Auckland including various organisations run by different religions. It is possibly significant that money was spread across a number of the various religious denominations including homes run by the Anglican and Catholic Churches and inner city Missions and shelters administered by the Methodists and others. One institution was created by the Costley Trust, apparently on the specific instruction of Edward Costley. A Training School for Boys was built on Richmond Road in Grey Lynn to educate working class boys in manual trades. This building is now known as Carlile House and is in a state of disrepair. Since Costley's death an unsigned draft will has come to light which showed that he had long contemplated the application of his wealth to charitable purposes. He died in Auckland on 18 April 1883, and was buried at Symonds Street Cemetery where the Costley Trust erected a monument to his memory. This monument stands to the south of the Anglican Memorial on the eastern side of the cemetery.

Once the financial center of the Yadavas region, it is the largest city amongst its neighbouring districts in Maharashtra and Karnataka border. History The first train in India traveled from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus in Mumbai to Thane on 16 April 1853 on a track laid by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. The GIPR line was extended to Kalyan in 1854 and then on the south- east side to Khopoli via Palasdari railway station at the foot of the Western Ghats in 1856. While construction work was in progress across the Bhor Ghat, GIPR opened to public the Khandala-Pune track in 1858. The Bhor Ghat incline connecting Palasdari to Khandala was completed in 1862, thereby connecting Mumbai and Pune. GIPR extended its line to Raichur in 1871 and met the line of Madras Railway thereby establishing direct Mumbai-Chennai link. The Pune- Raichur sector of the Mumbai-Chennai line was opened in stages: the portion from Diksal in Pune to Barshi Road was opened in 1859, from Barshi Road to Mohol in 1860 and from Mohol to Solapur also in 1860. Work on the line from Solapur southwards was begun in 1865. Solapur railway station platformboard The metre gauge Solapur-Hubli line was opened in stages.

From the viewpoint of mechanics, elastocapillarity phenomena essentially involve competition between the elastic strain energy in the bulk and the energy on the surfaces/interfaces. In the modeling of these phenomena, some challenging issues are, among others, the exact characterization of energies at the micro scale, the solution of strongly nonlinear problems of structures with large deformation and moving boundary conditions, and instability of either solid structures or droplets/films.The capillary forces are generally negligible in the analysis of macroscopic structures but often play a significant role in many phenomena at small scales.Liu, Jian-Lin, and Xi-Qiao Feng. \\"On elastocapillarity: A review.\\" Acta Mechanica Sinica 28.4 (2012): 928-940. Deformation of a thin PDMS sheet by water droplet  Bulk elasticity  When depositing a droplet on a solid surface with contact angle θ, horizontal force balance was described by Young's equation. However, there is a vertical force balance which often ignored can be written as: F_{vertical}=\\\\gamma \\\\times \\\\sin(\\\\theta) = E \\\\times \\\\delta Force balance between a droplet and a substrate in the vertical direction Where F_{vertical} is the force per unit length in the vertical direction \\\\gamma is the surface tension of a liquid E is the Young's modulus of a substrate \\\\delta is deformation of the substrate This gives length scale \\\\delta \\\\sim \\\\gamma / E \\\\sin(\\\\theta) δ~ γ/E sinθ for the deformation of bulk materials caused by the surface tension force. For example, if a water (\\\\gamma ~ 72 mN/m) droplet is deposited on the glass (E ~ 700 GPa), this gives \\\\delta ~10−12m which is typically negligible. However, if a water is deposited on the PDMS ( E ~ 300 kPa), this caused the deformation to be \\\\delta ~10−6m, which is in micron scale, this can have great impact on the micro/nanotechnology applications where length scale is comparable and \\"soft\\" photoresists were used.  Elastocapillary length  The elasto-capillary length of an elastic material is defined as: L_{EC} = (\\\\frac{B}{\\\\gamma})^\\\\frac{1}{2} where B is the bending modulus of an elastic material γ is the surface tension of a liquid This provides a comparison between bending stiffness (elasticity) and surface tension (capillarity). An elastic structure will be significantly deformed once its length is larger than the elasto-capillary length, which can be explained when gain of surface energy of a material is larger than stored elastic energy while bending.  Capillary rise between parallel plates  In the case of capillary rise between two parallel plates, height of capillary rise can be predicted as Jurin's height if plates are rigid. Longer the plates, more flexible they become, consequently plates coalesce as a result of deformation induced by capillary force. As observed, length of capillary rise Lwet between elastic plates increases linearly with total length of plates L, sets length of dry Ld=L-Lwet nearly a constant. By balancing gain of surface energy by capillary force and loss of elastic energy by banding a flexible sheet and minimizing with respect to Ld, dry length was found to be: L_d^4 = \\\\frac{9}{2}w^2 L_{EC}^2 Where L_{EC} = (\\\\frac{B}{\\\\gamma})^\\\\frac{1}{2} is the elastocapillary length of sheets w is the distance between two parallel sheets This Ld sets the minimum length for parallel sheets to collapse, sheets spontaneously coalesce if they are longer than Ld. Above result can be generalized to multiple parallel plates when N elastic plates were used. By assuming these N sheets is N times more rigid than single sheet, such system can be treated as two bundles of N/2 sheets with a distance Nw/2. Thus the dry length can be written as: L_d^4 = \\\\frac{9}{16} N^{3}w^{2}L_{EC}^2  Capillary origami  Capillary origami of a thin PDMS sheet using a water droplet Unlike normal origami, capillary origami is the phenomenon where folding of an elastic sheet is done by capillary force. This phenomenon can only be seen as characteristic length of an elastic sheet is longer than elasto-capillary length and can be used in the application of self-assembly in micro and nano applications. In some cases, high voltage was used to actuate a folded structure by using electrostatic energies.  Young-Laplace Equation  The capillary pressure developed within a liquid droplet/film can be calculated using the Young–Laplace equation (e.g.Adamson, Arthur W., and Alice Petry Gast. Physical chemistry of surfaces. Vol. 4. New York: Wiley, 1990.): A wetting capillary droplet between two surfaces :\\\\Delta p = -\\\\gamma abla \\\\cdot \\\\hat n =\\\\gamma (\\\\cfrac{1}{R_1} + \\\\cfrac{1}{R_2}) where: * \\\\Delta p is the difference between the pressure across the liquid interface (Pa), * \\\\gamma is the surface tension of the liquid (N/m), * \\\\hat n is the unit normal pointing out of surface, * R_1,R_2 are the principle radii of curvature at any point on the free surface of the liquid film or droplet (m). If the liquid wets the contacting surfaces then this pressure difference is negative i.e. the pressure inside liquid is less than the ambient pressure, and if the liquid doesn't wet the contacting surfaces then the pressure difference is positive and liquid pressure is higher than the ambient pressure.  Examples of elastocapillarity  The coalescence happens in a brush after removing it from water is an example of elastocapillarity. Elastocapillary wrapping driven by drop impact is another example. Most of the small scale devices such as microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), magnetic head-disk interface (HDI), and the tip of atomic force microscopy (AFM) for which liquids are present in confined regions during fabrication or during operation can experience elastocapillary phenomena. In these devices, where the spacing between solid structures is small, intermolecular interactions become significant. The liquid can exist in these small scale devices due to contamination, condensation or lubrication. The liquid present in these devices can increase the adhesive forces drastically and cause device failure.  Elastocapillarity in contact between rough surfaces  Every surface though appears smooth at macro scale has roughness in micro scales which can be measured by a profilometer. The wetting liquid between contacting rough surfaces develops a sub-ambient pressure inside itself, which forces the surfaces toward more intimate contact. Since the pressure drop across the liquid is proportional to the curvature at the free surface and this curvature, in turn, is approximately inversely proportional to the local spacing, the thinner the liquid bridge, the greater is the pull effect. The liquid droplet with known surface tension between two rough surfaces with known material properties :\\\\Delta p = -\\\\gamma (\\\\cos \\\\theta_A+ \\\\cos \\\\theta_B)/h_{fs} where: * \\\\theta_A,\\\\theta_B are the liquid-solid contact angles for the lower and upper surfaces, respectively, * h_{fs} is the gap between the two solids at the location of the free surface of the liquid. These tensile stresses put the two surfaces into more contact while the compressive stresses due to the elastic deformation of the surfaces tend to resist them. Two scenarios could happen in this case: 1. The tensile and compressive stresses come into balance which in this case the gap between the two surfaces is in the order of Surface roughnessroughness of the surfaces, or, 2. The tensile stresses overcome the compressive stresses and the two surfaces come into near complete contact in which gap between surfaces is a small fraction of the Surface roughnesssurface roughness. The latter case is the reason for failure of most microscale devices. An estimate of the tensile stresses exerted by the capillary film can be obtained by dividing the adhesion force, P_{liq}, between two surfaces to the area wetted by the liquid film, A_{wet}. Because for relative smooth surfaces, the magnitude of the capillary pressure is predicted to be large, it is anticipated that the capillary pressures will be of large magnitude. A lot of works have been done to ascertain whether there may be some practical limit to the development of such negative pressures (e.g.Caupin, Frédéric, and Eric Herbert. \\"Cavitation in water: a review.\\" Comptes Rendus Physique 7.9 (2006): 1000-1017. ).

He was a presenter for Canal+ for a decade, and now works for beIN Sport. His presenting style is lighthearted and flamboyant. Although well known in France as the face of English football, he is almost unknown in Britain. Early life Tulett was born in Shoreham-by-Sea, Sussex, and grew up in Lancing, attending Boundstone School. He took various jobs after leaving school, and then studied politics and social sciences at Manchester Polytechnic. On the spur of the moment, Tulett agreed to go to France with a friend, and there he taught English amongst various other jobs. He wanted to become a journalist, and was taken on by Bloomberg News in London as a sports reporter. Football presenting Tulett and his wife wanted to return to France, and Bloomberg agreed to his request to report on the 1998 World Cup. He then remained in France, and reported for Bloomberg on football, the Tour de France and the French Open. He was also a presenter on Europe 1 Sport, part of the Europe 1 radio network in France. Around 2002 he was signed up by Canal+ as a presenter on L'Équipe du Dimanche, a programme on football elsewhere in Europe. He also presented Fabulous Sport on Canal+. He reported in a lighthearted, colourful 1960s style, becoming known in France as \\"Darren d'Angleterre\\". (The Observer has called him \\"The French Alan Hansen\\", and The Daily Telegraph has called him \\"The Austin Powers of French Television\\".) Also on Canal+ he presented Match of ze day on English football (the name presumably derived from the BBC programme Match of the Day with a stereotypical French pronunciation of \\"the\\").

He was a younger son of the Bavarian count palatine Hartwig of the Aribonid family. The Gesta archiepiscoporum Salisburgensium calls him a \\"friend of divine praise\\" (divinae laudis amicus). On 23 December 970, Hartwig became a subdeacon in Salzburg Cathedral. On 19 September 973 he was promoted to deacon, and on 18 September 985 he was ordained a priest. On 12 August 991 he was consecrated as the successor to Archbishop Frederick. He took part in the Easter synod at Ingelheim that denied the validity of the election of Gerbert of Aurillac to the vacant archdiocese of Reims. In 996, Hartwig accompanied the young king, Otto III, to Rome for his imperial coronation in May. There he participated in the election and ordination of Pope Gregory V, who performed the coronation. For his role in the coronation, Otto granted Hartwig the right to hold a market at Salzburg and the right to mint coin. A record of the various gifts and transactions of Hartwig's episcopate has survived in the form of a \\"tradition book\\" (Traditionsbuch). After Otto's death, Henry supported the election of Henry II, whom he accompanied to Mainz for his coronation in 1002. Thereafter the king showered him with gifts and privileges. In 1007, Hartwig was present when Henry founded the diocese of Bamberg. In 1012, he was present at the consecration of the new cathedral. In 1014, he was present at the coronation of Henry as Holy Roman Emperor in Rome. In his later yearst, Hartwig extended the choir of the cathedral. He worked with Anastasius Aschericus, the archbishop of Esztergom, to establish the Hungarian mission field. In 1020 he received six Königshufen (literally \\"royal hooves\\", an old unit of land) at Bamberg.

ViPR abstracts storage from disparate arrays into a single pool of storage capacity that “makes it easier to manage and automate its own data-storage devices and those made by competitors.” ViPR became generally available September 27, 2013. Description and core components ViPR is deployed as software-only virtual appliances on ESX servers and does not require the installation of new hardware. ViPR separates the data plane from the control plane. The control plane is a software layer that manages storage; the data plane is the storage infrastructure, including networks, where storage devices perform reads and writes to disks and/or memory. ViPR enables management of multivendor platforms, including third- party storage. With the ViPR Controller, users abstract physical storage into virtual storage pools, create storage categories or classes (such as high- performance file or “gold/silver/bronze” block), and automate storage delivery to users to access through a self-service catalog. Enterprise Management Associates states “the underlying idea of EMC ViPR is to deliver enterprise storage similar to the way Amazon offers virtual machines, enabling corporate developers to provision storage in a self-service manner.” REST APIs provide a central access and control point to manage storage arrays or devices. REST APIs are used to integrate ViPR with third-party applications and management tools, as well as cloud stacks such as VMware, OpenStack and Microsoft Hyper-V. In addition to the ViPR Controller, ViPR includes ViPR Global Data Services, which enable combinations of data type (e.g. block, file, and object), protocols. EMC supports object files and Hadoop using a software overlay based on ViPR. The ViPR Object Data Service exposes REST APIs for Atmos (EMC's object storage appliance), Amazon S3 and Swift (the native OpenStack object store service), which means that pools potentially use both cloud services and local [EMC] VNX and Isilon arrays. ViPR’s prestidigitation enables data written as objects by cloud applications to be accessible as files by legacy apps. Similar to the way ViPR provides object support, it can provision pools as a Hadoop file system (HDFS). > This is significant because it means data stored in a traditional block > storage VMAX array can be exposed to big data Hadoop applications without > moving it to a separate file repository. Theoretically, this could allow the > same set of physical data to serve as a traditional transactional database > while simultaneously incorporating into a big data analytics system, in > place. (Network Computing.) Architecture ViPR is a distributed scale-out software platform. It uses cloud technologies such as Cassandra, an open-source distributed database management system, to handle large amounts of data, workflows and workloads from one management point. > ViPR is a software solution, not a hardware offering, running on a virtual > machine. When compared to other solutions, it stands out because those are > platforms that provide automation stacks whereas ViPR provides a storage > platform that plugs into all of these stacks. (SiliconAngle.) Integration In version 1.0, ViPR supports EMC arrays and storage devices and non-EMC arrays such as NetApp. ViPR users have the ability to virtualize, provision, monitor, and report on storage use from additional vendor arrays integrated through third-party developed adaptors written to the ViPR REST- based APIs.

Claypole's baronetcy passed into oblivion. * 6 October 1657, Thomas Chamberlayne — Chamberlayne had a baronet before the Interregnum, so when Cromwell's baronetcies passed into oblivion at the Restoration, he was entitled to use his previous baronetcy. * 5 March 1658, Thomas Beaumont, of Leicestershire — At the Restoration Beaumont's Cromwellian baronetcy passed into oblivion, but he was granted a new one by Charles II on 21 February 1661. * 10 April 1658, Colonel Henry Ingoldsby — At the Restoration Ingoldsby's Cromwellian baronetcy passed into oblivion, but he was granted a new one by Charles II on 30 August 1661. * 10 April 1658, John Twisleton. — At the Restoration Twisleton's Cromwellian baronetcy passed into oblivion. * 10 April 1658, Henry Wright — Son of Cromwell's personal physician, Dr. Laurence Wright. At the Restoration Wright's Cromwellian baronetcy passed into oblivion, but he was granted a new one by Charles II on 11 June 1660. * 28 May 1658, Griffith Williams, of Carnarvonshire. — At the Restoration Williams's Cromwellian baronetcy passed into oblivion, but he was granted a new one by Charles II on 17 June 1661. * 13 August 1658, Attorney General Edmund Prideaux. — Prideaux shortly after receiving the baronetcy the title was inherited by his son Edmund Prideaux and then less than a year later passed into oblivion at the Restoration. * 13 August 1658, Solicitor General William Ellis. — At the Restoration Ellis's Cromwellian baronetcy passed into oblivion, but he received a knighthood from King Charles II on 10 April 1671. * 28 August 1658, William Wyndham, county Somerset. — At the Restoration Wyndham's Cromwellian baronetcy passed into oblivion, but he received a knighthood from King Charles II (between April 1660 and April 1661) and was granted a baronetcy by Charles II on 9 December 1661. The Protectorate baronetcies, being rare, seem to have been much prized; and that of Henry Ingoldsby raised jealousies. cites: letter of Henry Cromwell in Thurloe, VII. 57. Peers Peerages conferred by Cromwell were not likely, any more than his Knighthoods and Baronetcies, to be paraded by their possessors after the Restoration. Permanent life members were created for Cromwell's Other House (similar in concept to the modern life peers who sit in the House of Lords) and were addressed as \\"Lord\\". However with the exception of Lord Eure none of those who already had peerages granted under the ancient regime took up their seats in the Other House. When Oliver Cromwell died, those in the funeral procession who had noble titles under the ancient regime were so called (for example Edward Earl of Manchester), those who had sat in Cromwell's Other House were called lord (for example Philip Lord Skipton), but those such as \\"George Monck, General in Scotland\\", who had not taken up their seats in the Other House, were not referred to as lord. Aside from the Other House members who were known as lords, two peers are known to have been granted by the Lord Protector and a third may have been: *Colonel Charles Howard, a scion of the Norfolk and Surrey and Arundel-landed Howards - \\"Viscount Howard of Morpeth and Baron Gilsland in Cumberland\\" -- \\"Cromwell's favourite\\". He was raised (elevated further) to Earl of Carlisle by Charles II *Edmund Dunch, of Little Wittenham, Berks - Baron Burnell, April 20, 1658 -- Cromwell's relative. Charles II granted him no title and he, his son and grandson (after which it became extinct) did not use the title after the Restoration. **Bulstrode Whitelocke -- possibly a viscount. Cromwell, just before his death wanted to grant him this honour, but no use or record other than this wish is known.

Hong was the longest serving disciple for the Chen-style t'ai chi ch'uan () master Chen Fake (陈发科, 1887–1957). Starting in 1930, Hong trained uninterrupted with Chen for fifteen years. In 1944, Hong moved to Jinan (), Shandong Province (). In 1956, he returned to Beijing to study again with his teacher, Chen Fake. In Jinan, Hong practiced and researched the meaning of Chen-style t'ai chi ch'uan and had many questions. This was a time for review and answering questions. Hong’s fundamental question was why the form and the applications did not match exactly. He further asked if he could modify his form to match the primary application Chen had taught him. Over the next six months, Chen and Hong worked daily to make sure there was not one useless move in the form. Hong, later, expressed his own understanding of the ch'uan through his teachings and his writings. His theories and training principles are now known as the Practical Method for Chen-style t'ai chi ch'uan (). Through the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution, Hong maintained his dedication to the enrichment of his art. In the Era of Restructuring, Hong had trained a new generation of Chen Stylists and wrote several articles to illuminate the mysteries of Chen-style t'ai chi ch'uan. As China opened up to the international community, Hong was rediscovered as an important linkage to this ancient Chinese martial arts tradition. T'ai chi enthusiasts from all over the world would come to train with this remarkable man. Fame and fortune did not change Hong. He remains steadfast to the ideals of the Tao. Near the end of his life, old and in ill health, he would still maintain his daily t'ai chi training schedule and looked forward to doing Push hands with his students. In 1996, aged 90 (according to the Chinese calendar), Hong died. Hong is survived by his family, his dedicated disciples and the lasting legacy of his Practical Method. Training with Chen Fake (1930 - 1956) Hong Junsheng () was born in 1907, Yuxian County (), Henan Province (). His grandfather was a government official in the Qing Court. At an early age, Hong's family moved to Beijing. Hong's family was affluent providing Hong with a leisurely life style and a classical Chinese education. When Hong was young, he was physically weak and often sick. By the time Hong was seventeen, Hong could no longer continue his education because of his illness. Still feeling weak and sick even after getting married at the age of 20, Hong decided to improve his health by becoming more physically active. He started by walking around the Beijing neighborhood. In 1930, Hong began to learn Wu-style t'ai chi ch'uan () from Liu Musan () to further improve his health. Liu, originally from Wuxi () in Jiangsu Province (), was the director of the Telegram Service Department at Beijing Telegram Bureau and a well regarded protégé of Wu Chien-ch'uan (吴鉴泉, 1870–1942). The t'ai chi ch'uan world was in flux, just as Hong started his training with Liu. Before 1930, the public recognized t'ai chi ch'uan being taught by the Yang family and the Wu family but the arrival of Chen Fake and his promotion of Chen-style t'ai chi ch'uan would radically change this public perception. Chen Fake had moved from Chen village to Beijing to openly teach his family style. In accordance with Chinese martial arts tradition, Chen accepted and won all challenges. Chen's feats and exploits were widely reported in the press. Liu decided to investigate the validity of those claims. Liu invited Chen for a demonstration of the form as well as some friendly push hand competition. Liu was impressed by Chen's ability and decided to lead his students including Hong to study Chen-style t'ai chi ch'uan. For the next fifteen years, Hong studied diligently under the careful guidance of Chen Fake. Initially, Chen lived with Hong because of Hong's affluence. This allowed Hong to closely observe the teachings of Chen. Over time, Hong's health improved and this provided added impetus for Hong to continue his t'ai chi ch'uan training. Even as his family responsibility increased with his six sons and as his fortune declined, Hong continued to train closely with Chen. Just as Hong's wealth wane, Chen's reputation was rising. Chen invited Hong's family to stay with him. These allowed Hong once again to receive detail instructions from Chen. Over a thirty-year period, Chen Fake taught several hundred students in Beijing. Of those hundreds, only a handful can considered themselves to be disciples (), Hong was one of the earliest of those disciples and studied with Chen the closest and longest. In 1944, Hong's fortune continued to decline and he had to move from Beijing to Jinan, Shandong Province (). He would stay there for the rest of his life researching and practicing Chen-style t'ai chi ch'uan according to the teachings of Chen Fake. He would meet his master just one more time. In 1956, Hong was able to visit Beijing to train again with Chen Fake. Hong spent an intensive four months checking with his master on his interpretation and understanding of Chen style. At the end, Chen Fake told Hong that Hong's skill had reach a sufficient level and that Hong can now teach t'ai chi ch'uan. (陈发科: “你的功夫已经达到了我所期望的水平，回去后，你可以教拳了。”) Hong heeded his teacher's advice. When Hong returned to Jinan, he started to teach earnestly Chen-style t'ai chi ch'uan. Just a year later, in 1957, Chen Fake died. Hong was then one of the last links to the traditional Chinese martial arts as practiced in the previous century. Preparing for the Tao under harsh conditions (1957 - 1975) Hong's fate was deeply affected by the social turmoil that surrounded him. No longer wealthy, unemployed and supporting a large family, Hong still persisted in his study of the Chuan. The tragedy of the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) added to the hardship of Hong, persecuted for his bourgeois past, Hong was often left hungry, malnourished and struggled to provide for his family. Despite those trying circumstances, Hong continued to teach his t'ai chi ch'uan. Slowly, he gathered a core group of dedicated students to experiment and test his understanding of Chen Style. In his spare time, he would write down his thoughts on this ancient art. His single minded devotion to the practice helped him to persevere under those trying circumstances. Recognition of the Practical Method (1976 - 1996) Hong's situation improved in the Era of reconstruction. The Chinese government and society no longer shunned its cultural heritage. The public showed a renewed interest in t'ai chi ch'uan. Past martial arts masters could openly teach their art. The Chinese government even sponsored demonstrations and exhibitions to reacquaint the public with the Chinese martial arts. Hong, in general, avoided the public spotlight. On the rare occasions that he made a public performance, the audience was treated to the Chen-style t'ai chi ch'uan inherited from Chen Fake. Though personally humble, Hong was proud of the achievements of his students. When the government once again sponsored push hand competitions, the team trained by his student Li Enjiu () surprised the country with their remarkable results. First in provincial tournaments, then on the national stage, competitors from Jinan captured many gold medals. Their success can all be attributed to the teachings of Hong. As the memories of the Cultural revolutions faded, China reestablished relations with other countries such as Japan. Japanese tourists were interested in the authentic martial arts heritage of China. Their exploration took them all over China including Chen Village and then to Jinan. Various Japanese martial arts associations discovered Hong training in his usual location near Black Tiger Spring(). They were impressed by his abilities through some impromptu test of skills. Those organizations started to organize regular tours to train with Hong and established t'ai chi clubs based on the teachings of Hong in Japan. His visitors gave him the nickname “The Super Star of Tai Chi Chuan” () and “Tai chi’s Magic Hand” () Eventually t'ai chi enthusiast from around the world came to train with Hong. The Chinese government improved the living situation for Hong due to his increased popularity and the demand from foreign visitors. In 1988, Hong finally compiled his twenty one years of written notes into one comprehensive book – Chen Tai Chi Practical Method (Chén shì tàijí quán shíyòng quánfǎ, 陈式太极拳实用拳法) In this book, Hong described every technique in the Chen-style t'ai chi ch'uan curriculum and tried to correct what he perceived as misinterpretations that are prevalent in t'ai chi ch'uan practice. Using his expertise in traditional Chinese Poetry, he captured the essence of Chen- style t'ai chi ch'uan in two poems that are known as the \\"Three-Character Canons (三字经)\\" and \\"The Quality of Tai Chi Chuan (太極拳品)\\". In 2006, portions of this book were translated into English by Hong's disciple, Chen Zhonghua. In 1990, Hong suffered a stroke which left him paralysed from the waist down. Through sheer will power, Hong was still able to practice his ch'uan even though he could no longer walk freely. This he attributed to his daily t'ai chi practice. He would continue to train with his students each day until his death in 1996. An enduring legacy for Chen-style t'ai chi ch'uan Hong's legacy is his research and understanding of Chen-style t'ai chi ch'uan as taught by Chen Fake. This legacy can be seen in his disciples who are all well regarded t'ai chi ch'uan practitioners teaching Hong's Practical Method. Amongst his multitude number of disciples include: *Li Zongqing (李宗慶; 1922 - 1993) originally trained in Ba ji quan (). He started his training with Hong in 1966. He became Hong's teaching assistant and represented Hong in many functions including events in Japan. *He Shugan (何淑淦; b.1933) is one of the earliest students of Hong. He started his training with Hong in the winter of 1950. His students started the Heze Hung Junshen Chen-style t'ai chi ch'uan Research Association () in 2011. *Han Baoli (韩保礼; b.1936) trained with Hong since 1960. Han was one of Hong's assistants near the end of Hong's life. *Li Chugong (李储功; b.1936) is one of the main instructors still actively teaching the Practical Method in Jinan, Shandong, China. He became a student of Hong Junsheng in 1966 and stayed closely with him for nearly 30 years. He has written several articles and has produced video instructional materials on the Practical Method. In 2007, he published a book on \\"实用太极拳对练\\" (The Practical Method Taijiquan Paired Training). *Ha Lezhi (哈乐之; b.1940) is an accomplished martial artists before dedicating his life in teaching and researching the Practical Method. He has taught t'ai chi ch'uan at many universities in Shandong Province. *Jiang Jiajun (蒋家骏; b.1942) is the honorary president of the Xuzhou Chen Style Taijiquan Research Association () and the chief referee for a China Central Television program (CCTV) martial arts competition program (\\"“WMA • 武林大会联盟”\\"). *Wang Jinxuan (王金轩; b.1942) is teaching the Practical Method in China. *Li Enjiu (李恩久; b.1950) recognized by Hong family as the Standard Bearer for Hong’s Practical Method. He currently teaches in his own \\"Shandong Taiji Shangwu Club\\" () in Jinan, China. * Zhang Lianen (张联恩; b.1952) is the head of \\"Jinan Chen Style Taijiquan Association.\\" * Peter Wu Shi-zeng (吴仕增; b.1952) is teaching in Australia. * Joseph Chen Zhonghua (陈中华; b.1961) recognized by Hong family as the International Standard Bearer for Hong's Practical Method. He is based in Canada and Daqingshan (in Shandong, China). Hong's understanding of Chen-style t'ai chi ch'uan can be summarized in the first verse of his poem \\"Three-Character Canons\\" (): which translates as: This revelation can be seen in the practice of the Practical Method of Chen Style Tai Chi Chuan according to the instructions of Hong Junsheng.  T'ai chi ch'uan lineage tree with Chen-style focus  Hong Junsheng can be seen as the 10 generation practitioner of Chen style t'ai chi ch'uan as shown on the Chen- style lineage tree. According to Hong, only direct descendants of the Chen family can considered themselves to be practitioners of Chen family t'ai chi ch'uan (). All other Chen t'ai chi ch'uan practitioners are Chen stylists () as long as the principles unique to Chen style are observed. Some t'ai chi ch'uan practitioners refer to Hong's method as Hong style t'ai chi ch'uan (), Hong himself never acknowledge such naming conventions. He always insisted that he was merely a student of Chen Fake and was teaching according to his teacher's instructions. Hong used the term \\"Practical Method\\" () to emphasize the martial aspects of his research and training.

Process chemistry is distinguished from medicinal chemistry, which is the arm of pharmaceutical chemistry tasked with designing and synthesizing molecules on small scale in the early drug discovery phase. Medicinal chemists are largely concerned with synthesizing a large number of compounds as quickly as possible from easily tunable chemical building blocks (usually for SAR studies). In general, the repertoire of reactions utilized in discovery chemistry is somewhat narrow (for example, the Buchwald-Hartwig amination, Suzuki coupling and reductive amination are commonplace reactions). In contrast, process chemists are tasked with identifying a chemical process that is safe, cost and labor efficient, “green,” and reproducible, among other considerations. Oftentimes, in searching for the shortest, most efficient synthetic route, process chemists must devise creative synthetic solutions that eliminate costly functional group manipulations and oxidation/reduction steps. This article focuses exclusively on the chemical and manufacturing processes associated with the production of small molecule drugs. Biological medical products (more commonly called “biologics”) represent a growing proportion of approved therapies, but the manufacturing processes of these products are beyond the scope of this article. Additionally, the many complex factors associated with chemical plant engineering (for example, heat transfer and reactor design) and drug formulation will be treated cursorily.  Process chemistry considerations  Cost efficiency is of paramount importance in process chemistry and, consequently, is a focus in the consideration of pilot plant synthetic routes. The drug substance that is manufactured, prior to formulation, is commonly referred to as the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and will be referred to as such herein. API production cost can be broken into two components: the “material cost” and the “conversion cost.” The ecological and environmental impact of a synthetic process should also be evaluated by an appropriate metric (e.g. the EcoScale). An ideal process chemical route will score well in each of these metrics, but inevitably tradeoffs are to be expected. Most large pharmaceutical process chemistry and manufacturing divisions have devised weighted quantitative schemes to measure the overall attractiveness of a given synthetic route over another. As cost is a major driver, material cost and volume-time output are typically weighted heavily.  Material cost  The material cost of a chemical process is the sum of the costs of all raw materials, intermediates, reagents, solvents and catalysts procured from external vendors. Material costs may influence the selection of one synthetic route over another or the decision to outsource production of an intermediate.  Conversion cost  The conversion cost of a chemical process is a factor of that procedure's overall efficiency, both in materials and time, and its reproducibility. The efficiency of a chemical process can be quantified by its atom economy, yield, volume-time output, and environmental factor (E-factor), and its reproducibility can be evaluated by the Quality Service Level (QSL) and Process Excellence Index (PEI) metrics. An illustrative example of atom economy using the Claisen rearrangement and Wittig reaction. = Atom economy = The atom economy of a reaction is defined as the number of atoms from the starting materials that are incorporated into the final product. Atom economy can be viewed as an indicator of the “efficiency” of a given synthetic route. : AE = \\\\frac{\\\\text{MW(product)}}{\\\\sum \\\\text{MW(raw materials)}}\\\\times 100\\\\% For example, the Claisen rearrangement and the Diels-Alder cycloaddition are examples of reaction that are 100 percent atom economical. On the other hand, a prototypical Wittig reaction has especially poor atom economy (merely 20 percent in the example shown). Process synthetic routes should be designed such that atom economy is maximized for the entire synthetic scheme. Consequently, “costly” reagents such as protecting groups and high molecular weight leaving groups should be avoided where possible. An atom economy value in the range of 70 to 90 percent for an API synthesis is ideal, but it may be impractical or impossible to access certain complex targets within this range. Nevertheless, atom economy is a good metric to compare two routes to the same molecule. = Yield = Yield is defined as the amount of product obtained in a chemical reaction the yield of practical significance in process chemistry is the isolated yield—the yield of the isolated product after all purification steps. In a final API synthesis, isolated yields of 80 percent or above for each synthetic step are expected. The definition of an acceptable yield depends entirely on the importance of the product and the ways in which available technologies come together to allow their efficient application; yields approaching 100% are termed quantitative, and yields above 90% are broadly understood as excellent.In an academic perspective, Furniss, et al., in Vogel's Textbook of Practical Organic Chemistry, describes yields around 100% as quantitative, yields above 90% as excellent, above 80% as very good, above 70% as good, above 50% as fair, and yields below this as poor. : \\\\begin{array}{rrr} \\\\hline & \\\\text{Illustrative Example} & \\\\text{Overall Yield}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\color{BrickRed}\\\\text{Linear Synthesis} & \\\\ce{A ->[85\\\\%] B ->[85\\\\%] C ->[85\\\\%] Product} & \\\\color{BrickRed}{61.4\\\\%}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\color{PineGreen}\\\\text{Convergent Synthesis} & \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix}\\\\ce{A ->[85\\\\%] B} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\ce{D ->[85\\\\%] E} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\quad \\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\ce{-> Product} & \\\\color{PineGreen}{72.3\\\\%}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\end{array} There are several strategies that are employed in the design of a process route to ensure adequate overall yield of the pharmaceutical product. The first is the concept of convergent synthesis. Assuming a very good to excellent yield in each synthetic step, the overall yield of a multistep reaction can be maximized by combining several key intermediates at a late stage that are prepared independently from each other. Another strategy to maximize isolated yield (as well as time efficiency) is the concept of telescoping synthesis (also called one-pot synthesis). This approach describes the process of eliminating workup and purification steps from a reaction sequence, typically by simply adding reagents sequentially to a reactor. In this way, unnecessary losses from these steps can be avoided. Finally, to minimize overall cost, synthetic steps involving expensive reagents, solvents or catalysts should be designed into the process route as late stage as possible, to minimize the amount of reagent used. In a pilot plant or manufacturing plant setting, yield can have a profound effect on the material cost of an API synthesis, so the careful planning of a robust route and the fine-tuning of reaction conditions are crucially important. After a synthetic route has been selected, process chemists will subject each step to exhaustive optimization in order to maximize overall yield. Low yields are typically indicative of unwanted side product formation, which can raise red flags in the regulatory process as well as pose challenges for reactor cleaning operations. = Volume-time output = The volume-time output (VTO) of a chemical process represents the cost of occupancy of a chemical reactor for a particular process or API synthesis. For example, a high VTO indicates that a particular synthetic step is costly in terms of “reactor hours” used for a given output. Mathematically, the VTO for a particular process is calculated by the total volume of all reactors (m3) that are occupied times the hours per batch divided by the output for that batch of API or intermediate (measured in kg). :\\\\text{VTO}=\\\\frac{\\\\text{nominal volume of all reactors} [\\\\ce{m}^3]*\\\\text{time per batch} [\\\\ce h]}{\\\\text{output per step} [\\\\ce{kg}]} The process chemistry group at Boehringer Ingelheim, for example, targets a VTO of less than 1 for any given synthetic step or chemical process. Additionally, the raw conversion cost of an API synthesis (in dollars per batch) can be calculated from the VTO, given the operating cost and usable capacity of a particular reactor. Oftentimes, for large-volume APIs, it is economical to build a dedicated production plant rather than to use space in general pilot plants or manufacturing plants. = Environmental factor (e-factor) and process mass intensity (PMI) = Both of these measures, which capture the environmental impact of a synthetic reaction, intend to capture the significant and rising cost of waste disposal in the manufacturing process. The E-factor for an entire API process is computed by the ratio of the total mass of waste generated in the synthetic scheme to the mass of product isolated. : E=\\\\frac{\\\\sum \\\\text{mass of waste}}{\\\\text{mass of isolated product}}=\\\\frac{\\\\sum \\\\text{mass of materials}-\\\\text{mass of isolated product}}{\\\\text{mass of isolated product}} A similar measure, the process mass intensity (PMI) calculates the ratio of the total mass of materials to the mass of the isolated product. : \\\\text{PMI}=\\\\frac{\\\\sum \\\\text{mass of materials}}{\\\\text{mass of isolated product}} = E +1 For both metrics, all materials used in all synthetic steps, including reaction and workup solvents, reagents and catalysts, are counted, even if solvents or catalysts are recycled in practice. Inconsistencies in E-factor or PMI computations may arise when choosing to consider the waste associated with the synthesis of outsourced intermediates or common reagents. Additionally, the environmental impact of the generated waste is ignored in this calculation; therefore, the environmental quotient (EQ) metric was devised, which multiplies the E-factor by an “unfriendliness quotient” associated with various waste streams. A reasonable target for the E-factor or PMI of a single synthetic step is any value between 10 and 40. = Quality service level (QSL) = The final two \\"conversion cost\\" considerations involve the reproducibility of a given reaction or API synthesis route. The quality service level (QSL) is a measure of the reproducibility of the quality of the isolated intermediate or final API. While the details of computing this value are slightly nuanced and unimportant for the purposes of this article, in essence, the calculation involves the ratio of satisfactory quality batches to the total number of batches. A reasonable QSL target is 98 to 100 percent. = Process excellence index (PEI) = Like the QSL, the process excellence index (PEI) is a measure of process reproducibility. Here, however, the robustness of the procedure is evaluated in terms of yield and cycle time of various operations. The PEI yield is defined as follows: : \\\\text{PEI yield}=\\\\frac{\\\\text{average yield}\\\\cdot 100\\\\%}{\\\\text{aspiration level yield}}=\\\\frac{\\\\text{average yield}\\\\cdot 100\\\\%}{\\\\frac{\\\\text{median yield}+\\\\text{best yield}}{2}} In practice, if a process is high-yielding and has a narrow distribution of yield outcomes, then the PEI should be very high. Processes that are not easily reproducible may have a higher aspiration level yield and a lower average yield, lowering the PEI yield. Similarly, a PEI cycle time may be defined as follows: : \\\\text{PEI cycle time}=\\\\frac{\\\\text{aspiration level cycle time}\\\\cdot 100\\\\%}{\\\\text{average cycle time}}=\\\\frac{\\\\frac{\\\\text{median cycle time}+\\\\text{best cycle time}}{2}}{\\\\text{average cycle time}} For this expression, the terms are inverted to reflect the desirability of shorter cycle times (as opposed to higher yields). The reproducibility of cycle times for critical processes such as reaction, centrifugation or drying may be critical if these operations are rate-limiting in the manufacturing plant setting. For example, if an isolation step is particularly difficult or slow, it could become the bottleneck for an API synthesis, in which case the reproducibility and optimization of that operation become critical. For an API manufacturing process, all PEI metrics (yield and cycle times) should be targeted at 98 to 100 percent.  EcoScale  In 2006, Van Aken, et al. developed a quantitative framework to evaluate the safety and ecological impact of a chemical process, as well as minor weighting of practical and economical considerations. Others have modified this EcoScale by adding, subtracting and adjusting the weighting of various metrics. Among other factors, the EcoScale takes into account the toxicity, flammability and explosive stability of reagents used, any nonstandard or potentially hazardous reaction conditions (for example, elevated pressure or inert atmosphere), and reaction temperature. Some EcoScale criteria are redundant with previously considered criteria (e.g. E-factor).  Synthetic case studies   Boehringer Ingelheim HCV protease inhibitor (BI 201302)  Macrocyclization is a recurrent challenge for process chemists, and large pharmaceutical companies have necessarily developed creative strategies to overcome these inherent limitations. An interesting case study in this area involves the development of novel NS3 protease inhibitors to treat Hepatitis C patients by scientists at Boehringer Ingelheim. The process chemistry team at BI was tasked with developing a cheaper and more efficient route to the active NS3 inhibitor BI 201302, a close analog of BILN 2061. Two significant shortcomings were immediately identified with the initial scale-up route to BILN 2061, depicted in the scheme below. The macrocyclization step posed four challenges inherent to the cross-metathesis reaction. # High dilution is typically necessary to prevent unwanted dimerization and oligomerization of the diene starting material. In a pilot plant setting, however, a high dilution factor translates into lower throughput, higher solvent costs and higher waste costs. # High catalyst loading was found to be necessary to drive the RCM reaction to completion. Because of high licensing costs of the ruthenium catalyst that was used (1st generation Hoveyda catalyst), a high catalyst loading was financially prohibitive. Recycling of the catalyst was explored, but proved impractical. # Long reaction times were necessary for reaction completion, due to slow kinetics of the reaction using the selected catalyst. It was hypothesized that this limitation could be overcome using a more active catalyst. However, while the second-generation Hoveyda and Grubbs catalysts were kinetically more active than the first-generation catalyst, reactions using these catalysts formed large amounts of dimeric and oligomeric products. # An epimerization risk under the cross-metathesis reaction conditions. The process chemistry group at Boehringer Ingelheim performed extensive mechanistic studies showing that epimerization most likely occurs through a ruthenacyclopentene intermediate. Furthermore, the Hoveyda catalyst employed in this scheme minimizes epimerization risk compared with the analogous Grubbs catalyst. Additionally, the final double SN2 sequence to install the quinoline heterocycle was identified as a secondary inefficiency in the synthetic route. center Analysis of the cross-methathesis reaction revealed that the conformation of the acyclic precursor had a profound impact on the formation of dimers and oligomers in the reaction mixture. By installing a Boc protecting group at the C-4 amide nitrogen, the Boehringer Ingelheim chemists were able to shift the site of initiation from the vinylcyclopropane moiety to the nonenoic acid moiety, improving the rate of the intramolecular reaction and decreasing the risk of epimerization. Additionally, the catalyst employed was switched from the expensive 1st generation Hoveyda catalyst to the more reactive, less expensive Grela catalyst. These modifications allowed the process chemists to run the reaction at a standard reaction dilution of 0.1-0.2 M, given that the rates of competing dimerization and oligomerization reactions was so dramatically reduced. Additionally, the process chemistry team envisioned a SNAr strategy to install the quinoline heterocycle, instead of the SN2 strategy that they had employed for the synthesis of BILN 2061. This modification prevented the need for inefficient double inversion by proceeding through retention of stereochemistry at the C-4 position of the hydroxyproline moiety. center It is interesting to examine this case study from a VTO perspective. For the unoptimized cross-metathesis reaction using the Grela catalyst at 0.01 M diene, the reaction yield was determined to be 82 percent after a reaction and workup time of 48 hours. A 6-cubic meter reactor filled to 80% capacity afforded 35 kg of desired product. For the unoptimized reaction: : \\\\text{VTO} = \\\\frac{6\\\\text{ m}^{3} \\\\times 48\\\\text{ h}}{35\\\\text{ kg}} = 8.2\\\\text{ m}^{3} \\\\cdot \\\\text{ h / kg} This VTO value was considered prohibitively high and a steep investment in a dedicated plant would have been necessary even before launching Phase III trials with this API, given its large projected annual demand. But after reaction development and optimization, the process team was able to improve the reaction yield to 93 percent after just 1 hour (plus 12 hours for workup and reactor cleaning time) at a diene concentration of 0.2 M. With these modifications, a 6-cubic meter reactor filled to 80% capacity afforded 799 kg of desired product. For this optimized reaction: : \\\\text{VTO} = \\\\frac{6\\\\text{ m}^{3}\\\\times 13\\\\text{ h}}{799\\\\text{ kg}} = 0.1\\\\text{ m}^{3} \\\\cdot \\\\text{ h / kg} Thus, after optimization, this synthetic step became less costly in terms of equipment and time and more practical to perform in a standard manufacturing facility, eliminating the need for a costly investment in a new dedicated plant.  Additional topics   Transition-metal catalysis and organocatalysis   Biocatalysis and enzymatic engineering  Recently, large pharmaceutical process chemists have relied heavily on the development of enzymatic reactions to produce important chiral building blocks for API synthesis. Many varied classes of naturally occurring enzymes have been co-opted and engineered for process pharmaceutical chemistry applications. The widest range of applications come from ketoreductases and transaminases, but there are isolated examples from hydrolases, aldolases, oxidative enzymes, esterases and dehalogenases, among others. One of the most prominent uses of biocatalysis in process chemistry today is in the synthesis of Januvia®, a DPP-4 inhibitor developed by Merck for the management of type II diabetes. The traditional process synthetic route involved a late-stage enamine formation followed by rhodium-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation to afford the API sitagliptin. This process suffered from a number of limitations, including the need to run the reaction under a high-pressure hydrogen environment, the high cost of a transition-metal catalyst, the difficult process of carbon treatment to remove trace amounts of catalyst and insufficient stereoselectivity, requiring a subsequent recrystallization step before final salt formation. Comparison of the chemosynthetic and biosynthetic routes toward sitagliptin. Merck's process chemistry department contracted Codexis, a medium-sized biocatalysis firm, to develop a large-scale biocatalytic reductive amination for the final step of its sitagliptin synthesis. Codexis engineered a transaminase enzyme from the bacteria Arthrobacter through 11 rounds of directed evolution. The engineered transaminase contained 27 individual point mutations and displayed activity four orders of magnitude greater than the parent enzyme. Additionally, the enzyme was engineered to handle high substrate concentrations (100 g/L) and to tolerate the organic solvents, reagents and byproducts of the transamination reaction. This biocatalytic route successfully avoided the limitations of the chemocatalyzed hydrogenation route: the requirements to run the reaction under high pressure, to remove excess catalyst by carbon treatment and to recrystallize the product due to insufficient enantioselectivity were obviated by the use of a biocatalyst. Merck and Codexis were awarded the Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award in 2010 for the development of this biocatalytic route toward Januvia®.  Continuous/flow manufacturing  In recent years, much progress has been made in the development and optimization of flow reactors for small-scale chemical synthesis (the Jamison Group at MIT and Ley Group at Cambridge University, among others, have pioneered efforts in this field). The pharmaceutical industry, however, has been slow to adopt this technology for large-scale synthetic operations. For certain reactions, however, continuous processing may possess distinct advantages over batch processing in terms of safety, quality and throughput. A case study of particular interest involves the development of a fully continuous process by the process chemistry group at Eli Lilly and Company for an asymmetric hydrogenation to access a key intermediate in the synthesis of LY500307, a potent ERβ agonist that is entering clinical trials for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia, in addition to a regimen of standard antipsychotic medications. In this key synthetic step, a chiral rhodium- catalyst is used for the enantioselective reduction of a tetrasubstituted olefin. After extensive optimization, it was found that in order to reduce the catalyst loading to a commercially practical level, the reaction required hydrogen pressure up to 70 atm. The pressure limit of a standard chemical reactor is about 10 atm, although high-pressure batch reactors may be acquired at significant capital cost for reactions up to 100 atm. Especially for an API in the early stages of chemical development, such an investment clearly bears a large risk. An additional concern was that the hydrogenation product has an unfavorable eutectic point, so it was impossible to isolate the crude intermediate in more than 94 percent ee by batch process. Because of this limitation, the process chemistry route toward LY500307 necessarily involved a kinetically controlled crystallization step after the hydrogenation to upgrade the enantiopurity of this penultimate intermediate to >99 percent ee. Comparison of the batch and continuous flow processes toward LY500307. The process chemistry team at Eli Lilly successfully developed a fully continuous process to this penultimate intermediate, including reaction, workup and kinetically controlled crystallization modules (the engineering considerations implicit in these efforts are beyond the scope of this article). An advantage of flow reactors is that high-pressure tubing can be utilized for hydrogenation and other hyperbaric reactions. Because the head space of a batch reactor is eliminated, however, many of the safety concerns associated with running high-pressure reactions are obviated by the use of a continuous process reactor. Additionally, a two-stage mixed suspension-mixed product removal (MSMPR) module was designed for the scalable, continuous, kinetically controlled crystallization of the product, so it was possible to isolate in >99 percent ee, eliminating the need for an additional batch crystallization step. This continuous process afforded 144 kg of the key intermediate in 86 percent yield, comparable with a 90 percent isolated yield using the batch process. This 73-liter pilot-scale flow reactor (occupying less than 0.5 m3 space) achieved the same weekly throughput as theoretical batch processing in a 400-liter reactor. Therefore, the continuous flow process demonstrates advantages in safety, efficiency (eliminates the need for batch crystallization) and throughput, compared with a theoretical batch process.

Governor Claiborne appointed Peter Van Dorn as clerk for Claiborne County in 1810, and in 1816 he became the clerk of the territory's new House of Representatives (which later became the state legislature). In 1821 the relatively new Mississippi legislature created an Orphan Court system (handling probate matters) and appointed Peter Van Dorn to the circuit including Claiborne County. That same year, the legislature decided to create a new state capital at Jackson, Mississippi and appointed Peter VanDorn among the commissioners who in April 1822 submitted a plan using a \\"checkerboard\\" pattern advocated by Thomas Jefferson, in which city blocks alternated with parks and other open spaces, giving the appearance of a checkerboard (although not always followed by later developers).

He won promotions during the Mexican American War and Seminole War and became the commanding officer at the border garrison at Mason, Texas by 1860, but resigned his U.S. Army Commission following President Lincoln's election. He rose to became a Confederate general in the American Civil War. His womanizing (with two legitimate children by his wife since 1843, as well as three illegitimate children and a reputation as \\"the terror of ugly husbands\\") may have led to his death on May 7, 1863 in Spring Hill, Tennessee, shot in the side of his head by a local doctor and legislator, who turned himself in to Union authorities and was not prosecuted, possibly since he had caught his wife embracing VanDorn on April 12 and his unmarried 15 year old daughter was pregnant.

J. Abrams. The novel is unusual in its format, presented as a story within a story. It is composed of the novel Ship of Theseus by a fictional author, and hand-written notes filling the book's margins as a dialogue between two college students hoping to uncover the author's mysterious identity and the novel's secret plus loose supplementary materials tucked in between pages. S. has been called \\"part work of art, literary experiment, and love letter to the physical expression of books\\". Description S. is presented in the form of a novel called Ship of Theseus written by an elusive author named V. M. Straka and published in 1949. Beyond the black slipcover with the S. title, no reference is made to Dorst or Abrams, and the only reference to the book's true publishing information appears in fine print inside the back cover. The publication information is printed under a mock-up of a high school library's check-out history of the book, spanning the years 1957 to 2000. Removed from the slipcover, S. is designed to appear entirely as a copy of the standalone novel Ship of Theseus written by Straka that was borrowed from and never returned to the Laguna Verde High School Library. The pages are worn and yellowed with library stamps in the front and back cover and stains on the pages. The book's spine is labeled with a library sticker marking the novel's location number in the Dewey Decimal Classification. The novel can be read alone in its entirety. Presented as Straka's nineteenth and final novel before his mysterious death, Ship of Theseus tells the story of an amnesiac on a strange journey to discover himself. Straka's enigmatic life and death are considered one of the literary world's greatest mysteries and enshrouded by conspiracy theories and claims of espionage and assassination. His identity is the subject of much scholarly debate as evidenced by a foreword and footnotes from F.X. Caldeira, described as Straka's chosen translator for many of his books, including Ship of Theseus, though even Caldeira never encountered Straka face-to-face. A second storyline takes place in the book's margins. Eric is a disgraced graduate student who has spent his life studying Straka and his literary works. Jen is a college senior contemplating the next step of her life. The two begin to trade a copy of Ship of Theseus back and forth without meeting, using the book's margins to carry out discussions about who Straka was using handwritten notes, arrows, and symbols. The pair hopes to solve the mystery of Straka's identity before Eric's graduate professor, who allegedly stole his research and had him expelled, publishes his research on Straka. The hand-written marginalia are not always chronological. Different pen colors and handwriting styles denote the dialogues between the two and how they change on subsequent re-readings on the novel. Concurrent with Jen and Eric's timeline of reading and annotating the novel, there are postcards, handwritten letters, maps, and photocopied articles and book excerpts physically folded and inserted between the book's bound pages as Jen and Eric provide evidence and clues to each other while exchanging the book. Development S. is a collaboration between film producer J. J. Abrams, who came up with the concept for the book, and writer Doug Dorst. Abrams stated that the idea came from finding a book on a bench that had an inscription: \\"to whomever finds this book please read it and take it somewhere and leave it for someone else to read.\\" Dorst has stated that his idea for the central concept of the story was inspired by two literary mysteries: the Shakespeare authorship question and the controversy over the identity of B. Traven, who wrote several acclaimed and successful novels in the early 20th century but so closely guarded his privacy that his true identity has never been conclusively established. He wrote Ship of Theseus first, intending it to be read on its own merits. The marginal notes and ephemera were added later. The authors intended the book as a physical object, and not just a story. Abrams noted that \\"to physically hold it is kind of the point.\\" One reviewer called S. an argument for paying extra for a physical book, \\"a possessor of wonders that cannot be translated into digital bits.\\" Abrams' film production company, Bad Robot Productions, released a trailer online entitled \\"Stranger\\", leading to rumors that it could to be Abrams' next film or TV project, perhaps even a spin-off to the TV series Lost. It was finally explained to be promoting S., after an official trailer for the book was released.

State Fund) was a Soviet Trophy Brigade otherwise known as the State Agency for Literature formed in late 1944 by Georgy Malenkov on Stalin's orders. It was one of a number of war committees formed by the Soviet Union during the Vistula–Oder Offensive and tasked with appropriating foreign factories, manufactured goods, raw materials, livestock, farm machinery, fertilizer, crops, laboratories, libraries, museums, scientific archives from all of Soviet occupied Eastern Europe, and forcible relocations of (mostly German) engineers and scientists. The literature confiscated by Gosfond was transported to Soviet state libraries and cultural institutions including the National Lenin Library of the USSR, the National Historical Library, the National Polytechnical Library, the National Library for Foreign Literature and the National Saltykov-Shchedrin Public Library.Kolasa, Ingo. 1996. “Where Have all the Volumes Gone?

Die Deutsche Bibliothek in Frankfurt, Germany: PDF file, direct download from Wayback Machine. Rebuilding Berlin Staatsbibliothek Library, books in storage, 1949 Most looted documents and books, sent to the Soviet Union by Gosfond, were stored haphazardly, seldom catalogued often destroyed by neglect and inattention. Items of scientific value were piled up in smaller public libraries and agricultural stations, where the books were never catalogued and could not be recalled for any useful activities. The origins of foreign acquisitions including the 1946 Gosfond delivery of 1,857 crates of books to libraries in Moscow were carefully concealed from librarians as well as the general public. This specific aim is usually referred to by historians as the work of the Trophy Commission which led the trophy brigades behind the frontline. The plunder of artwork was directed by Igor Grabar of the Bureau of Experts. The commission became instrumental in the removal of industrial installations, materials, and valuables from all Soviet-occupied territories during the Vistula–Oder Offensive of the Red Army including Hungary, Romania, Finland and Poland (within its prewar borders),Kolasa, Ingo. 1996. \\"Where Have all the Volumes Gone?

The commission's Arts Committee headed by Andrei Konstantinov was in charge of the registration and Soviet distribution of trophy artworks beginning June 1945. The transports included valuables stolen by Nazi Germany from as far as Latvia and Italy, appropriated by the Soviets.  Soviet Trophy Brigades  As early as 1942, the USSR formed special Red Army Trophy Brigades with the task of removing valuables from occupied territories (including Germany) and taking them back to the Soviet Union - usually by train convoys. The organization made responsible for receiving and cataloging these items, the \\"Commission on Reception and Registration of Trophy Valuables\\", was established just before the war's end in April 1945. The institution was soon disbanded as it had been overwhelmed by the sheer number of objects being sent back to Russia by the troops. The early part of 1946 saw some 12,500 crates of books and documents, along with other valuables from German libraries, which were allocated to the State Historical Museum in Moscow and to the Hermitage in Leningrad, and as far afield as Turkmenistan and Tajikistan. In April 1998 under Boris Yeltsin the Russian Duma nationalized these items; it also relieved any claims made on all Russian property still remaining in foreign lands.Harclerode, Peter and Brendan Pittaway, 2000, The Lost Masters: World War II and the Looting of Europe's Treasurehouses. Pages 201-203, 207-208, 224.

Technology Transfer out of Germany after > 1945. Page 83. Vladimir Shabinsky, a Russian officer who later defected to the West, gave his personal account of his own service as member of a Soviet Trophy Brigade. The library section of the Russian Trophy Brigades was known as the \\"State Agency for Literature\\", or, \\"Gosfond\\". The Soviet government had set up this agency to allocate the confiscated literature to Soviet libraries and cultural institutions. The plan involved Gosfond allocating the materials to enhance existing collection in Russia and acquiring meaningful additions. However, the Agency became overwhelmed with the numbers of books sent from Germany. Eventually, the exercise degenerated into a mechanical process of distribution, and the beneficiary libraries proved unable to absorb the works, or in some cases, even to store them. > In a meeting of March 14, 1946, a committee distributed 1,857 crates from > some thirty institutional and private libraries (including those of top > Nazis as von Ribbentrop and Goebbels) among five Soviet libraries: the > National Lenin Library of the USSR, the National Historical Library, the > National Polytechnical Library, the National Library for Foreign Literature > and the National Saltykov-Shchedrin Public Library. Lieutenant Colonel Margarita Rudomino, director of the Library for Foreign Literature in Moscow, and an associate on the staff of the Plenipotentiary State Special Defense Committee, and part of the Soviet Trophy Brigade, argued that the German Library (Deutsche Bibliothek-Deutsche Bücherei) in Leipzig was needed for re-building Germany and restoring German cultural identity. Thus over two million volumes were evacuated to Thuringia, but they were then returned to the Leipzig library. However, she also argued for the return of the books from the Sächsische Landesbibliothek (Saxon State Library) in Dresden, but they were sent to Russia by mistake, and they were returned, in part, in 1957.Genieva, Ekaterina. \\"German Book Collection in Russian Libraries.\\" IN: The Spoils of War: World War II and Its Aftermath: The Loss, Reappearance and Recovery of Cultural Property. Pages 221-222. Not all transfers of captured documents went well. Many of the books sent to the Soviet Union by the Gosfond and the various Trophy Brigades did not benefit either the Soviets or anyone else. With the overwhelming numbers of materials received, they were often parceled out to smaller libraries and institutes, who often received materials wholly inappropriate for their functions. As a result, many of the items were stored haphazardly, seldom cataloged or inventoried, and often were destroyed by neglect and inattention. Items which were needed at large research institutes were sent to smaller public libraries and agricultural stations, where the books were never cataloged and could not be recalled for inter-library loan or other useful activities.Kolasa, Ingo. 1996. \\"Where Have all the Volumes Gone?

They are currently controlled by Jovin Media, and have a team in the Balmain Touch Association competition. Founded in 2000 as Toongabbie, they entered into the Westmead Touch Association competition for the 2000/2001 season. They continued for two seasons under the name, before rebranding themselves as Western Reds. History Westmead Competition (2000–2007)  The Western Reds touch football team was established in September 2000, and joined the Westmead Touch Association for the 2000/2001 season. Originally playing under the name of Toongabbie for the first two seasons, they recorded losses of 12–0 and 14–0 consecutively in their first two matches. It would take the team nearly two seasons to win a game, which came late in their second season. The name Western Reds was voted on for season 2002/2003, to associate the team with their red shirts and western Sydney heritage. Playing under a new name, the Reds narrowly missed a finals berth. 2003/2004 saw a mass exodus of players, with only five of thirteen players re-signing from the previous season. The club recruited a number of key players and, with fresh talent and enthusiasm spearheading the way, played their first ever finals match. The following three seasons were relatively successful, with finals appearances in each. At the time, 2005/2006 was undoubtedly the club's most successful season, which included several big wins, and a Grand Final appearance. 2006/2007 saw a change in the club's jersey. Gone were the original plain red tee's, replaced by a more professional looking tri-colour shirt which included white with black stripes. The Reds also farewelled veterans Steven Dearth and Brendon Solomons after six seasons of service. Balmain Competition (2007–present) Making a move to the inner west, season 2007/2008 saw the team compete in the Balmain Association, a move welcomed by players and fans alike. The season provided mixed results, as the boys struggled to find their feet in the superior competition, which was highlighted by a record 23–2 loss. 2008/2009 signified a huge turn around for the Reds, with a number of solid results on the field including a 17–0 win. Luke Foord scored 23 tries, whilst the team returned to semi-finals football after finishing 3rd on the ladder. Season 2009/2010 marked the 10th season of the Western Reds. The team commemorated the achievement with a new playing strip, logo and website. The Reds also announced sponsorship deals with Paramount Lawyers and Jovin Media and took on a squad of 15 full-time players. Despite being bundled out of the semi's, the Reds had completed their most successful season in their 10-year history, with 9 wins (including 6 in a row), and 113 team tries. The Red's managed to complete season 2010/2011 on top of the table for the first time. But despite finishing 1st, history repeated itself when the Reds crashed out of the semi's for the third season in a row. A number of records were set during the season, including the Reds biggest ever win (22–4), whilst Pete Brouwer broke Luke Foord's try scoring record in the final game, with 25 tries for the season. Seasons 2011/2012 and 2012/2013 were stop-start affairs, with the Reds struggling to gain any momentum due to several wash outs and opposition forfeits. With an inconsistent playing roster, the Reds adopted an aggressive recruitment drive, as nine rookies were added to the team list over the two seasons. 2012/2013 saw 21 players take the field for the Reds, the largest playing roster in the team's history. New Sponsorship and Jersey (2016–present) 2016 saw a new multi-hundred dollar sponsorship deal with The Smoking Barrels Barbecue. Along with the deal came new jerseys replacing the old strip and also saw the end to the Reds partnership with Paramount Lawyers. Western Reds management we're also able to re-sign several key member including captain Gavin Smith, staving off retirement, along with locking in new talent, wingers Brett Thorley and Jacob Riley. The Smoking Barrels Barbecue sponsorship was terminated by The Western Reds in 2017, due to unprofessional dealings that the Reds wished to distance themselves from. The 2018/19 season sees captain Gavin Smith once again pull on the jersey for a record 19th season to steer the team around the park.

Its address is 15 Court Street, Washington, GA 30673. It was built by the McDonald Brothers Company of Louisville. with Historical Description The Old Jail, as it is commonly referred to by locals in Wilkes County, is on the corner of Court Street and Allison Street in Washington, GA 30673. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 5, 1974. It is a contributing member to the Washington, GA Historic Commercial District, which was included on the National Register of Historic places on March 6, 1986. The Old Jail was built in 1891 and was designed by the McDonald Brothers Jail Building Company of Louisville. Kentucky. The existing jail in Washington was considered unsafe and unsanitary. The 1891 jail was designed to meet the need for a better jail as evidenced by Grand Jury minutes from time to time starting in the 1870s. The Old Jail was built on a site owned by Wilkes County. Two earlier jails were located on the same site but in somewhat different locations. Construction of the first jail started in 1796 and was completed in 1798. It was a brick building with quarters downstairs for the jailer’s family. The prisoners were kept upstairs. A second jail was built on the site in 1817 or 1818, and it remained until the 1891 jail was built. On January 22, 1891, an $8,250 contract was awarded to the McDonald Brothers Jail Building Company to construct a new jail for the growing community. The McDonald Brothers Company was well known for its jail and public building designs throughout the South and Midwest. That Company designed and built many buildings during the last 20 years of the nineteenth century. Many of their works survive and are listed on the National Register. Three of the McDonald Brothers—Harry, Kenneth and Donald—formed the McDonald Brothers Company in 1883. The Company continued until at least 1891. The Louisville city directory listed them all as architects. Harry was president of the McDonald Brothers Building Company as well as president of the Louisville Bottle and Extract Manufacturing Company. Kenneth was the secretary of the jail company, and Donald was its general manager. Both Harry and Donald attended the engineering school of Washington College, and Donald graduated from Washington and Lee University in 1873. Many of their works survive and are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The May, 1892 Superior Court Minutes of the Grand Jury expressed great satisfaction with the new jail. The Grand Jury praised the jail’s cleanliness and comfort compared with the former jail. They recommended building a fence and installing blinds for the windows. The Old Jail used an innovative heating system design which closely approached that of an experiment. It was arguably an early version of the duct or forced-air method of heating. A fire was built outside, with the hot air drawn in through a system of moat-like tunnels formed by large limestone blocks; the warm air was then vented through a large chimney. The theory was that the warm air would be conducted through the ducts and transmitted to the cells through the porous limestone walls and floor. Unfortunately, the heating system failed to function as expected and the engineering gaffe was one reason the jail was used for only about 20 years. In presentments published in the June 4, 1895 Wilkes County Chronicle, the County announced it would accept bids on a contract for a new heating system for the jail. The heating system was refurbished with interior fireplaces on the first and second floors and other changes were made, but it is unclear if the changes were effective. The Old Jail continued to limp along because it had other fatal problems: The November 1908 Grand Jury described the jail as a “constant menace.” There were complaints of inadequate space and unsanitary conditions. The History of Wilkes County, Georgia says: “In the twenty years since its first occupancy, escapes had come with alarming frequency and the community would breathe a sigh of relief when the new, more secure, structure opened.” (p. 333) In fact, in March 1911, just as a new jail was being completed, two prisoners escaped from The Old Jail, one who had been incarcerated for murdering his wife and the other who had been jailed for burglary. A new jail was built behind the courthouse in 1911 and The Old Jail became vacant and deteriorated. The building changed hands several times during the 1930s and 1940s. The ground floor was for a time operated as the Royal Café, while the upper floor was used as an apartment. The Old Jail was acquired by new owners in 2019. Current plans are to rehabilitate the building as apartments and live-work space. Architectural Details The two-story building encompasses approximately 1350 square feet and sits on .22 acres. It was designed in the Romanesque Revival style popular during the late nineteenth century. The style is evidenced in the solidarity and strength exhibited in the square brick pillars, the shadow- box plaque and dentil designs, and the rough stone banding. The exterior design reflects the strength of the building. Constructed of red brick in common bond, it fairly square and has a square, hipped metal roof and a belt coursing of rough stone. The front façade follows the covered stairway, under which is a doorway. The original door was a post and lintel, stone-faced doorway. Brick designs include flat gauged apertures between each column, indented square brick patterns, and a brick, dentilled cornice along the stepped and gabled rooflines. A series of small round head arches form a pattern across the gabled portion of the roof. The current six-over-six windows have flat gauged brick work above each window. The windows have been altered to make the openings smaller. What the original windows looked like is unknown. The second-story entrance has the original jail door. The jail had a solitary confinement area just inside the front door and the original iron bars remain. The Old Jail was abandoned and sat vacant from about 1911 until the early 1930s. Thereafter, the building was altered to suit various functions including apartments, a café, and a special event venue. Wood flooring replaced the limestone on the second floor and in parts of the first floor. Many of the limestone blocks were removed and some are used as patios on the east and north sides of the building. Others are located on a separate lot to the north of The Old Jail. Many of the limestone blocks contain easily seen Paleozoic marine fossils, including stomatoporoids (a kind of extinct sea sponge). The building was renovated in the 1970s, including a two-story addition on the north side and a one-story brick addition at the northwest corner. The new structures were used as apartments and special event space until the late 1990s. At some point, probably in the 1990s, a fire significantly damaged both additions. The fire did not impact the original jail structure.

Founded in 1877, the school had students from Years 1 to 8 (ages 5 to 13). It closed at the end of 2014 when it was merged with Woolston School on the Woolston site. The school had an attached technology centre, which taught \\"manual training\\" technology subjects to 1,200 Year 7 and 8 students from Phillipstown and 30 other full primary schools in Christchurch. Unlike intermediate schools and Year 7–13 secondary schools, most full primary schools in Christchurch do not have the roll numbers, staff or facilities to fully provide technology subjects to Year 7 and 8 students, so the technology centre catered for these schools. Students attended the centre for 90 minutes per week and rotated every term through six different areas of study: wood, metal, plastic, textiles, food and electronics. Phillipstown came to national attention in 2013 when it sought a judicial review over a decision by the minister of education, Hekia Parata, to merge it with nearby Woolston School. The closure was delayed when the High Court subsequently ruled in favour of Phillipstown and overturned the minister's decision.  However, ultimately, the school was closed.

Course and features The anabranch flows approximately from its offtake on the Darling River south of , southward to the Murray River, west of . There are approximately twenty ephemeral deflation basin lakes, called the Anabranch Lakes, associated with the Darling Anabranch of which several are over in size. The Anabranch Lakes and associated marginal vegetation are listed in the Directory of Important Wetlands in Australia and collectively cover an area of . The Darling Anabranch contains archaeological cultural material and evidence of Aboriginal occupation. The Darling Anabranch is a naturally ephemeral system. After the completion of the Menindee Lakes scheme in the 1960s the system was managed as a permanent water supply for stock and domestic water use for adjacent landholders. A series of 17 weir pools were replenished with an annual replenishment flow, most of which evaporated. Over the 40 years of this flow management there was a decline in the health of the system, including poor water quality, decreased numbers of native fish and a decline in aquatic vegetation. In 2007 a pipeline was constructed along the length of the Darling Anabranch to supply water to adjacent landholders. The Darling Anabranch was returned to an ephemeral system, with the removal of most structures within the channel, and the first dry phase for over four decades. Initial results from a ten-year monitoring program have showed a marked ecological response to the restoration of the Darling Anabranch. Monitoring began in September 2010 at the breaking of the 'millennium drought', and detected a strong vegetation response including significant increases in riparian tree condition and in the condition of Lignum, a keystone species on the floodplains of the Murray-Darling Basin. The return of the Darling Anabranch to an ephemeral system also increased native fish diversity, and the system is thought to be crucial to maintaining the Murray-Darling Basin native fish community through provision of important habitat and food resources for juvenile life stages during times of flood.

A regular Saturday passenger service ran for many years, known as the \\"Wilton Express\\", using three ex-WMR clerestory carriages.The End of an Era: Gwyneth Jones page 23 A 'Waipa Collieries' advert, placed by the mine's first manager, showed passenger trains leaving Glen Massey at 8.30am and Ngāruawāhia at 4pm, with passengers also taken on coal trains leaving Glen Massey at 11.30am and 2.30pm and Ngāruawāhia at 10am and 1pm.The End of an Era: Gwyneth Jones page 22 Wilton Collieries Ltd 2014 view from Wilton Collieries Rd of the upper end of the railway and one of the connecting, rope worked, inclines at the Wilton Mine. By 1930 the original mine was worked out and the company went into liquidation. A new coal seam was found 3.5 km to the south; a new company, \\"Wilton Collieries Ltd\\", was formed to operate this line, which was known as the Waipa Railway and Collieries Limited private line, and from October 1944 as the Wilton Collieries Limited private line. Initially it had been planned to link the new mine to the railway by an aerial ropeway, but extending the railway was found to be more practicable. The railway line was sold to the new company for £10,000 in November 1930 and extended by about 2.2 km. The company purchased two ex-NZR tank locomotives, WD 356 and WD 316 in 1934 and 1933 to run the line, WD 356 being purchased primarily to replace the former Waipa Railway & Collieries NO 1 which had been lost in the Windy Creek runaway and derailment in 1933. Both of the WD class locomotives were noted as being beyond repair by 1935. Mines Department control and closure With no working locomotives, Wilton Collieries Ltd handed operations of the railway over to the New Zealand Railways, which began working the line from 12 August 1935 onwards. Initially operated using the WW class 4-6-4T tank locomotives, the line was operated from 26 February 1937 by the larger BB class 4-8-0 tender locomotives, which continued to run the line until final closure with some occasional assistance from WW class locomotives.The End of an Era: Gwyneth Jones page 27 In 1944, the Wilton Collieries Ltd mine at Glen Massey and associated railway between Glen Massey and Ngāruawāhia were nationalised in 1944 for £86,000. Mine output was 70,000 tons of coal annually, half of which was for the NZR. Three return trips a day carried 400 tons daily. In 1935, track deterioration resulted in speed limits, initially , but from 10 December 1935 to Glen Massey and then to the mine.The End of an Era: Gwyneth Jones page 25 The line was closed on 19 May 1958. A short section is now part of the Hakarimata Rail Trail. Locomotives To operate the new line, Waipa Railway & Collieries Ltd purchased a small 0-6-2T from Andrew Barclay, Works NO 1292/1913, which became WR&C; NO 1. This locomotive remained in service until 1933 when it ran away and derailed at Windy Creek during shunting operations; Wilton Collieries Ltd (who now owned the railway) decided not to retrieve the locomotive and its remains were left at Windy Creek where they remain to this day. To assist with the work, WR&C; purchased another locomotive from NZR in 1914, 2-6-2T WH 449 (Manning Wardle 923/1884). This locomotive had formerly been WMR NO 4, and was used in regular service up until 1933 when it was put aside at the colliery screens. It was noted as still being there, albeit derelict, in 1957 when enthusiast Peter Mellor visited, but was presumably scrapped following the closure of the mine and railway in 1958. Following the purchase of the mine and railway by Wilton Collieries Ltd in 1930, the new company purchased two further locomotives from the NZR, a pair of Baldwin Locomotive Works WD class 2-6-4T tank locomotives. WD 316 (Baldwin 18543/1901) and WD 356 (Baldwin 19260/1901) were purchased in 1934 and 1933 respectively, the former replacing Waipa Railway & Collieries NO 1 after its accident in 1933 and the latter replacing WH 449\\\\. Both were out of service and noted as being beyond repair in 1935, by which time the NZR had taken over. The eventual disposal of WD 316 is unknown; WD 356 survived in some capacity, possibly at another location under new owners, until the Second World War when its frames were cut into sections and dumped at Konini near Pahiatua to prevent erosion.

The church building itself was designed by the architect François Reybaud and the abbey Joseph- Guillaume Pougnet, and built from 1855 to 1886.André Segond, Marseille ville impériale, Editions Autres Temps, 2010, p. 81 It is neogothic, with ogival curbs in the ceiling. The architects took inspiration from the Reims Cathedral and the Amiens Cathedral. The two arrows are 70 metre high. The bronze gates were designed by Caras-Latour, the high altar was designed by Jules Cantini (1826-1916), and the stained windows were designed by Édouard Didron (1836-1902). Additionally, sculptor Louis Botinelly (1883-1962) designed the statues of Joan of Arc and of Jesus. As for the organ pipes, they were made by Joseph Merklin (1819–1905). In the 1980s, due to low attendance, it came under the threat of being demolished. However, in recent years, it has achieved record levels of mass attendance. At present The church building is open every day from 09.00 to 12.00 and from 13.00 to 16.30, except on Sundays. Mass is every weekday at 18.30. On Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday it is also celebrated at 12:10. On Sunday mass is said at 10:30.

It was the artistic work of Alexander Phimister Proctor, commissioned by Joseph Nathan Teal, a Portland attorney. A ceremony celebrated its unveiling on May 22, 1919. It included attendance from persons all across the state, the majority of enrolled students, and a special section of the crowd was reserved for the remaining pioneers. Pioneer T. G. Hendricks and his granddaughter removed the canvas cover, unveiling the statue.  Creation and design  The Pioneer at its dedication in 1919 The Pioneer was a long time in the making. Proctor had completed sculptures of pioneer groups, but he searched for a model that would \\"typify the real spirit of the West.\\" After a ten-year search, he found the image in J. C. Cravens, an \\"old trapper bewhiskered without a haircut heavy boots thick plants a buckskin coat carrying his rifle and leading a nag.\\" Once he had this model, Proctor took the idea to Portland lawyer and businessman Joseph Teal, who commissioned the sculpture. It was the first statue placed on the University of Oregon campus. The Pioneer is about ruggedness and movement. In form, the sculpture follows attributes of the model with him being portrayed in similar garb, a full beard, and a rifle slung over his shoulder. His body language is proud, as seen in the set of his shoulders and the level of his chin. Further, his open stance implies movement, with his eyes gazing forward and his weight seeming to be in the process of shifting from one foot to the next. The natural, hard organic sentiment flows all the way to his rock pedestal. The basalt was \\"one that had weathered many storms and had been tossed about by the river currents yet enduring ... [Proctor] thought it was in keeping with the ideals of the Pioneer who had weathered similar storms.\\" In his form, he is the intrinsic strength, prepared to move forward and meet what comes.  Location  The statue in 2014 Plaque in 2014 The statue's location was chosen with care, both in its general location and in its specific spot. While the bronze was cast from a plaster form in Rhode Island and its trip to Oregon took over a month by train, it made the journey for good reason. When Proctor gave his presentation address of the sculpture he said: > \\"It is sufficient to say that here the Willamette and McKenzie rivers join > their waters into one grand channel and create this beautiful valley, the > paradise to which the pioneer struggled over great mountains and across > desert plains to which he first came in numbers, and in which he made home. > No more fitting place than the campus of University of Oregon could be found > for the memorial.\\" A committee including Mr. and Mrs. Teal, Dean Ellis F. Lawrence, and Irene Hazard Gerlinger chose its exact physical location. He was placed within the Oregon fir trees facing the Administrative Building between the library (Fenton Hall) and Friendly Hall on the University of Oregon campus. Although he is to embody the western spirit, The Pioneer is situated facing south on this site. This orientation was intentional on the part of the artist to ensure that his front is bathed in the greatest light, which only comes from the southern exposure.  Naming  When this sculpture was created and placed its official name was The Pioneer, not The Pioneer Father. The name \\"Pioneer Father\\" only came about after the intentions of the creation of the Pioneer Mother was made public in the late 1920s; it was an edit that provided a means to distinguish between the two sculptures. However, with this change, the original intent was misconstrued or lost altogether. When The Pioneer was unveiled, Joseph Teal said: > \\"This statue is erected and dedicated to the memory of all Oregon pioneers. > It is in no sense personal or individual and it is my earnest wish and hope > that this fact may ever be kept in mind.\\" \\"The pioneer represents all that > noblest and best in our history. The men and women who saved the west for > this country were animated by the highest motives. They made untold > sacrifices and endured hardships of every kind in order that their children > might enjoy the fruits of their labor.\\" At the 1919 dedication, the President of the Oregon Historical Society extolled the virtues of the Anglo-Saxon race, stating, > \\"the Anglo-Saxon race is a branch of the Teutonic race. It was and is a > liberty-loving race. It believes in the protection of life and of liberty an > in the rights of property and the pursuit of happiness. This race has large > powers of assimilation, and its great ideas of liberty and of the rights of > mankind caused other races to become a part of it, so it became a people as > well as a race.\\" It was to be a memorial for all Oregon pioneers, men and women alike. Marc Carpenter, who researched the history of the statue in 2018, stated, \\"A monument is a celebration. Monuments innately celebrate that which they depict. So, to me, it feels very similar to the confederate monuments that speckled a large part of the rest of the country. It’s a monument to violence and white supremacy.\\" History In a 1928 newspaper article, the statue was described as standing \\"in the center of the campus\\", and depicting \\"the pioneer spirit of the West\\". By 1929, the statue was guarded against vandalism, along with other Eugene landmarks, prior to the homecoming football game rivalry with Oregon State University. An editorial in the Eugene Guard in 1931 mentioned, in the context of the in-state rivalry, \\"Orange paint of the hue so popular in the vicinity of Corvallis daubs the pavements at the University, the big 'O' on Skinner's Butte, even the famous Pioneer statue.\\" In 1963, describing \\"Goblin antics\\", the Eugene Guard reported, \\"Someone took the Halloween occasion Thursday night to decorate the Pioneer Father statue on the University of Oregon campus. Arrows 'protruded' from his body and a tomahawk was 'imbedded' in his head.\\" The statue was vandalized in April 2019. Then on May 20, 2019, the hundredth anniversary of the statue's installation, students from the Native American Students Union held a protest, calling for the Pioneer to be removed due to the experience of Native American peoples of Oregon. UO President Michael Schill created a committee with the charge, \\"to make recommendations to balance the representation of history on campus to include people of diverse backgrounds\\". On June 13, 2020, following a rally at Deady Hall, a group of unknown individuals pulled down and vandalized the statue and moved it to the front steps of Johnson Hall, also toppling and defacing The Pioneer Mother. On June 14, the university put both statues into storage.

It was built in the 1580s. It houses the relics of Saint Spyridon and it is located in the old town of Corfu. It is a single-nave basilica and its bell tower is the highest in the Ionian Islands. It is the most famous church in Corfu. History The iconostasis The painted ceiling by Panagiotis Doxaras According to traditional accounts, in 1489, after the fall of the Byzantine Empire, the relics of St. Spyridon and St. Theodora, were brought to Corfu from Constantinople by Greek monk Georgios Kalochairetis, who was also a person of wealth, and were kept as property of his family. Later, when his daughter Asimia married one of the scions of the Voulgari family in Corfu she was given the remains of the saint as part of her dowry. Subsequently, the relics of St. Spyridon were housed in a private church owned by the Voulgaris family. The Voulgaris church was located in the San Rocco suburb of Corfu city but had to be demolished when the outer city fortifications were built by the Venetians to protect the citadel after the first great siege of Corfu by the Ottomans in 1537. In the 1580s, after the demolition of the private church, the saint's remains were moved to their present location in a new church which was built within the city fortifications in the Campiello district of the old town. The bell tower of the church is similar in design to its contemporary Greek Orthodox church of San Giorgio dei Greci located in Venice. Interior Inside the church there is a crypt to the right of the iconostasis where the remains of the Saint are kept in a double sarcophagus. The larger of the two contains the smaller one in its interior and is wooden with silver leaf trim. The smaller sarcophagus is surfaced in red velvet and has a removable bottom to facilitate changing the slippers of the saint. The lack of any underground chamber to house the remains of the saint was part of a deliberate design plan to make them as accessible as possible. In the crypt there are 53 incense burners hanging from the ceiling, 18 of which are golden and the rest made of silver. The front of the marble iconostasis resembles the exterior of the entrance of a baroque-style church. The ceiling of the church is divided into segments depicting scenes from St. Spyridon's life and miracles. The original painter of the church ceiling was Panagiotis Doxaras who created the works in 1727. With the passage of time the Doxaras paintings rotted away and subsequently they were replaced by copies painted by Nikolaos Aspiotis, a member of the Aspiotis family of Corfu. The only remaining trace of Doxaras's work is the gilded border of the iconography. House of Romanov Above the western door of the narthex the imperial coat of arms of the House of Romanov stands as a reminder that the church was under the nominal protection of Russia from 1807-1917. Near the same area a painting depicts the saint touching the head of Constantius II curing the emperor from illness. Venetian tributes View of the belltower. The Venetian Senate offered a gilded silver lamp bearing the reliefs of the Saint and the lion of St. Mark in commemoration of the miracles of the Saint during the second great siege of Corfu in 1716. The lamp is hanging at the west corner of the nave near the women's quarters. The inscription on the lamp reads as follows: Which translates as: \\"For the Salvation of Corfu, to the Patron Saint Spyridon, the Senate of Venice, 1716 AD\\". The largest lamp in the church is found near the pulpit and was offered to the saint by the Venetian High Admiral Andrea Pisani and the rest of the Venetian leaders with the inscription: Which translates: \\"To the Patron Saint Spyridon for having protected the two fleets under the leadership of Andrea Pisani, Commander in Chief of both fleets, the nobles in votive offering, AD 1717\\".

Borrell purchased this castle for the diocese. Borrell (; died 24 February 1018) was the bishop of Vic from 1010 until 1017. He was elected to replace Arnulf, who had died in battle against the Córdobans, and his episcopate coincided with the renewed colonisation of the west of Catalonia. After succeeding to the episcopal throne in 1010, Borrell confirmed that the tithes from the fortified settlement (castrum) of Gurb belonged to the lord of the place, Berenguer, who had been granted them by Bishop Arnulf when he succeeded his father, Sendred. Berenguer was also a canon of the cathedral of Vic. In 1014 he was elected bishop of Elne. This resulted in a major dispute between Vic and Elne, as Borrell tried to collect the tithes of Gurb and seized Berenguer's family's property. Borrell created forged documents, assigned them to the episcopate of Froia, and presented them to an episcopal council in Narbonne in 1017. The council, fooled by the forgeries claiming that the tithes of Gurb belonged to the cathedral of Vic, confirmed the false documents and excommunicated Berenguer. In 1011 and in 1017, Borrell sat on a panel of judges in lawsuits brought against the monastery of Sant Cugat. In 1015, Borrell installed Guillem de Mediona, already castellan of the frontier castle of Clariana, in the site of Calaf, with the condition that he build a fortress there. Guillem is described in documents as a levita, a term implying a deacon and a special relationship with the church. Calaf had originally been granted to the viscount of Ausona, Ramon (1007×9–14), by Count Raymond Borrell of Barcelona, but Borrell had acquired it for the see. Four months after the granting of Calaf to Guillem, Borrell farmed out the construction of a castle at Riquer, but no later documents mention a castle there. During Borrell's tenure, four castles were added to the diocese's holdings: Vilagelans was willed to the diocese; L'Espelt was donated to her; and Santa Perpètua and Barberà were bought. Borrell died in 1018 while returning from a military expedition in al-Andalus. His successor, Oliba, convinced that the documents from the Gurb case were forged, reversed Borrell's decision on the tithes.

The book includes an appendix describing Conan, his life, friends and enemies. The book also features an introduction by L. Sprague de Camp. Reception In the August 1989 edition of Games International (Issue #8), Mike Jarvis admired the production quality of the book, calling the cover art \\"a nicely rendered painting showing everyone's favourite barabrian.\\" Jarvis pointed out that \\"GURPS fantasy campaigns tend to be a little lacking in interesting sword fodder\\", so he found the seven pages of new monsters \\"a rare treat indeed! [...] a joy for any fantasy referee. This section would almost warrant the book's purchase.\\" Although Jarvis found the chapter on religions \\"functional but uninspired\\", he enjoyed the gazetteer, saying, \\"It is here that the book really comes into its own. Each country is covered in a detail which I found surprising for such a book.\\" However, Jarvis thought the lack of a scenario to be a detriment. He concluded by giving the book an above-average rating of 4 stars out of 5, saying, \\"Overall this is a most accomplished work, suitable for anyone who wants a world for the GURPS fantasy campaign, whether they're Conan fans or not.

Agnew, former First Lady Mamie Eisenhower and former United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Bates was reared by a single mother in \\"a shotgun house with a dirt-floored kitchen.\\" He graduated from Northwestern State University in Natchitoches, Louisiana. In 1965, he joined the Secret Service and was posted at the White House. He provided security for the Johnson and Nixon daughters while they were college students. He was with Nixon in the 1972 trip to China. He ended his Secret Service career in 1976 as the agent in charge in the field office in Shreveport in northwestern Louisiana. Bates described the people he protected as \\"just people, like you and me\\" who obtain high political office and must provide for the security of the nation. After his eleven years in the Secret Service, Bates relocated to Forest Hill, where he operates Robert Bates Nursery, in the commercial nursery complex south of Alexandria. One of Bates' fellow nurserymen in Forest Hill was the late Louisiana Public Service Commissioner Clyde C. Holloway, a Republican who earlier held Louisiana's 8th congressional district seat from 1987 to 1993, since disbanded. On November 16, 1991, Bates was the Republican candidate for the District 29 seat in the Louisiana State Senate. He lost to the incumbent Democrat Joe McPherson, then of Pineville. McPherson received 23,428 votes (56.8 percent) to Bates' 17,819 (43.2 percent). Three other Democratic candidates, including state Representative Charles R. Herring of Alexandria and singer Jay Chevalier, had been eliminated in the primary election held earlier on October 19. In 2005, Bates was inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield. Holloway defeated Joe McPherson in a special election in 2009 for the Public Service Commission.

He commissioned Proctor to do the work in 1927, since Proctor had already created The Pioneer.

In University Digital Archives: Old Oregon (1919-1993), https://scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/xmlui/handle/1794/13158 (accessed October 28, 2013). In design, The Pioneer Mother conveys the subject in later life, after the trials of the journey westward had long been completed. When Barker made the news of his gift public, he described what set this sculpture apart: \\"[o]thers have perpetuated the struggles of the pioneer mother; I want to perpetuate the peace which followed her struggles.\\"\\"Vice-President Barker Gives Statue of Pioneer Mother,\\" Old Oregon, 12, no. 9, June 1930.

The sculpture, placed atop a six-foot-tall base of pink granite, portrays a woman sitting at rest on a straight-backed chair, with a Bible upon her lap. The clear lines and massing of the base further enhance the suggestion of repose. Her journey, as represented in the bronze bas-relief panels on the west and east sides of the base, is over, and she is firmly rooted in her new home. Her style, as seen in her hair arrangement and cut of her dress, is simple, she is a depiction of all pioneer mothers in the twilight of their years.  Location  The sculpture was intentionally placed in a busy location on the University of Oregon campus. Barker stated in his address at her unveiling that \\"[i]t has been placed on the campus of the University of Oregon ... with the hope that so placed in the midst of the students and their activities, it may tell its story as a work of art and become a strong factor in implanting the love of the beautiful in the lives of the students as they go in and out before it.\\" As to her exact location, an Old Oregon article describes her placement thus: > \\"[h]er site was not chosen until a cardboard facsimile of the statue was > placed at various positions on the campus. After the entire women's > quadrangle was changed, the Mother was placed in the center, close enough to > several paths so she can catch bits of University chatter.\\" She faces north, toward The Pioneer, a sculpture of a male pioneer, with Johnson Hall, the university's main administration building, between them.

Plant species found here include numerous grass, sedge, and forb species including the state-endangered purple milkweed (Asclepias purpurascens). Other plants include silky rye, bottlebrush grass, ear-leaved brome, leadplant, large-flowered yellow false foxglove, Canada milk-vetch, Illinois tick-trefoil, alum-root, shooting star, and spiderwort. Other rare plants present are the state-threatened giant yellow hyssop (Agastache nepetoides), and special concern upland boneset (Eupatorium sessilifolium). Over the ridgetop, the cooler north-facing slope is mostly oak woodland with red oak, basswood, hackberry, butternut, yellowbud hickory, and red maple. Spring ephemerals are abundant here, including bloodroot, Jacob's-ladder, large-flowered bellwort, yellow lady's-slipper orchid, large white trillium, and dutchman's breeches.
