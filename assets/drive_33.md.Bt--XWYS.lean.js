He was the founder and first president of the Baseball Writers' Association of America, holding the office from 1908 to 1919. Early years Jackson was born in Providence, Rhode Island in 1871. At the time of the 1900 United States Census, he was living in Providence and working as a reporter.Census entry for Joseph S. Jackson, born July 1871. Ancestry.com. 1900 United States Federal Census [database on-line]. Census Place: Providence Ward 10, Providence, Rhode Island; Roll: T623_1509; Page: 4A; Enumeration District: 91. He worked for six years for the Providence Telegram from 1895 to 1901 and became the newspaper's Sunday and sporting editor. Sportswriter In November 1901, Jackson was hired to replace Ray M. Ziegler as the sporting editor of the Detroit Free Press, a position he held until 1910. In addition to his editorial duties, Jackson published a regular column titled \\"Sporting Facts and Fancies\\", and feature stories on the major sports events in the city. He covered Michigan Wolverines football in the era of Fielding H. Yost's \\"Point-a-Minute\\" teams and the Detroit Tigers during the early years of Ty Cobb's career in Major League Baseball. Jackson is credited with having given Cobb the nickname, \\"The Georgia Peach\\". In 1910, he became the sports editor of The Washington Post. He published a regular column in The Washington Post called Sporting Facts and Fancies. After three years in Washington, D.C., Jackson returned to Detroit as a sports writer and editor for The Detroit News-Tribune. He subsequently returned to the Detroit Free Press. Baseball Writers' Association of America In 1908, Jackson and Jack Ryder of the Cincinnati Enquirer organized the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA). The BBWAA was established in response to ongoing disputes over working conditions in, and control over, press boxes. The press boxes at many fields were cramped, and team owners had begun to offer seating in the press boxes to actors, friends and others who were not members of the working press. Frequently, there was no room for reporters from the visiting team. The issue came to a head during the 1908 World Series between the Detroit Tigers and Chicago Cubs when visiting baseball writers in Chicago were seated in the back row of the grandstand and in Detroit \\"were compelled to climb a ladder to the roof of the first base pavilion and write in the rain and snow\\". The organization was established at a meeting held at the Pontchartrain Hotel in Detroit, Michigan on October 14, 1908, following the 1908 World Series. Jackson was selected as the organization's first president and held that position for 11 years from 1908 to 1919. When Jackson stepped down as president in October 1919, the Association presented him with \\"a handsome traveling bag\\". Later years and death In 1921, Jackson moved to California and worked for several years there. He died in San Francisco, California, in June 1936. Edgar Guest, known as the \\"People's Poet\\", began his writing career with the Detroit Free Press in the early 1900s. After learning of Jackson's death, Guest published a poem titled \\"Joe S. Jackson\\" which provided in part: > \\"Joe wrote of baseball in the years gone by > And all the sports which men and boys enjoyed. > His was the nimble brain, the watchful eye, > Mine was the poor assistance he employed > > Word comes that Joe is dead. The game goes on! > Before the march of time all champions fall. > Now those he lavished praise and help upon > Only the dusty record books recall.

Warrendale is an unincorporated community in Multnomah County, Oregon, United States. It is located about a mile east of Dodson and about west of Bonneville in the Columbia River Gorge on Interstate 84/U.S. Route 30. It is across the Columbia River from Beacon Rock. The community was the site of an important salmon cannery founded in the 1870s. History Warrendale was named for Frank M. Warren Sr., a prominent Portland citizen and a pioneer of the salmon canning industry in Oregon. Warren died in the sinking of the in April 1912. Warrendale post office ran from 1894 to 1942; today the community is within the Cascade Locks ZIP code. Warrendale station on the Oregon-Washington Railroad & Navigation Company line (today owned by Union Pacific) was established in 1916. In 1915, the community had two salmon canneries, a large pulp and paper mill, and a public school, none of which remained by 1990. Warrendale students later attended Bonneville Grade School in Dodson, which closed in 1996. A salmon cannery established here in 1870 was the most prominent along the mid-Columbia River at that time. Frank Warren's cannery used a fish wheel upstream at Hamilton Island on the Washington side of the river to harvest salmon, which were transported down the island using a tramway, the remnants of which are still located in Fort Cascades Historic Site. The fish were then transported across the river to Warrendale for processing. The tramway operated until 1930, and fish wheels were outlawed in Washington in 1934. Warren also owned a cannery in Cathlamet, Washington. In the 1930s, Warrendale was considered as a site for the Bonneville Dam, eventually built a few miles upstream at Bonneville. In February 1996, a series of massive debris flows, resulting from the same severe weather that caused flooding in the Willamette Valley, occurred between Dodson and Warrendale, destroying homes and blocking the railroad and I-84 for several days. Notable people Warrendale was the home of Frederick H. Kiser, an early Oregon photographer, who, with his brother Oscar H. Kiser, established Kiser Scenic Photo Studio there in 1903. The company moved to Portland in 1905; Oscar died in November of that year. The Kiser brothers' parents owned the Columbia Beach Hotel and Nursery in Warrendale. Fred H. Kiser was the official photographer for the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition, and was noted for his images of Crater Lake and his promotional work for the Great Northern Railway.

Life Beamont was born at Warrington, Lancashire, 16 January 1828, being the only son of William Beamont, solicitor and author of Annals of the Lords of Warrington, and other works. After attending the Warrington grammar school for five years he was, in 1842, removed to Eton College, where he remained till 1846, bearing off Prince Albert's prize for modern languages, and the Newcastle medal and other prizes. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1846, took high honours, gained the chancellor's medal, and was awarded a fellowship in 1852. He graduated B.A. in 1850, and M.A. in 1853. After his election as fellow of Trinity he commenced a tour in Egypt and Palestine, and on being ordained in 1854 he spent some time at Jerusalem, where he engaged earnestly in the education of intending missionaries to Abyssinia, in Sunday school work, and in preaching not only to the English residents but to the Arabs in their own tongue. He afterwards acted as chaplain in the camp hospitals of the British army before Sevastopol during the Crimean War. In 1855 Beamont returned home, and became curate of St. John's, Broad Street, Drury Lane, London, in which parish he worked with great zeal until 1858, when he accepted the vicarage of St. Michael's, Cambridge. He died at Cambridge, 6 Aug. 1868, at the age of forty, his death being hastened by a fever caught in the East. He was buried in Trinity College Chapel. Beamont's life was one of unremitting self-denying usefulness, and in addition to his successful parochial labours and his pioneer efforts for church extension in Barnwell and Chesterton, he was the main instrument of founding the Cambridge School of Art (1858) and the Church Defence Association (1859).

Birth Estwick was born about 1657, or earlier, if it be true that he was one of the first set of children of the Chapel Royal under Cooke, after the Restoration, and a chorister at St. Paul's Cathedral at the same early date. Education He proceeded B.A. at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1677, M.A. in 1680, and B.D. in 1692. Background His intimacy with Henry Aldrich, dean of Christ Church, gave rise to the line: ‘I prithee, Sam, fill,’ in Aldrich's famous Smoking Catch. Estwick was probably too sympathetic and constant a frequenter of the rehearsals of music held weekly in the Dean's lodgings, to fall under the extreme penalty dealt unto delinquents by the genial host, namely; the restriction for the one evening to small beer, and exclusion from the next meeting. Aldrich's management of the cathedral choir was excellent; Estwick is described by William Hayes, author of the Remarks on Mr Avison's Essay on Musical Expression (London, 1753), as a ‘remarkable instance of the effect of such a training. He was not only an excellent and zealous performer in the choral duty until extreme old age rendered him incapable of it, but a remarkable fine reader also.’ He became sixth Minor Prebend at St. Paul's Cathedral in 1692; senior cardinal, or Superintendent of the Choir, in November 1698, and Sacrist on the death of James Clifford in February 1698-9. Estwick was appointed vicar of St. Helen's, Bishopsgate, in 1701, and rector of St. Michael's, Queenhithe, in 1712, but he continued to perform his choral duty at the cathedral till near the time of his decease, ‘when little short of ninety years of age. . . . Bending beneath the weight of years,’ Hawkins goes on to say, ‘but preserving his faculties, and even his voice, which was a deep bass, till the last, he constantly attended his duty at St. Paul's, habited in a surplice, and with his bald head covered with a black satin coif, with grey hair round the edge of it, exhibited a figure the most awful that can well be conceived.’ Death He died on 16 February 1738-9. The ‘reverend and truly venerable Mr. Estwick’ was regretted by the author of the Remarks as a ‘good man and worthy clergyman,’ while the ‘London Evening Post’ of 20 February bears witness to his ‘exemplary piety and orthodox principles.’ Estwick was said by Hawkins to have been an unsuccessful candidate for Gresham Professor of Music. He attended all the early meetmgs (from the first held in January 1725-6) of the Academy of Vocal Musick, and his name heads the list of contributors. His sermon on ‘The Usefulness of Church Musick,’ preached at Christ Church, 27 November 1696, upon the occasion of the anniversary meeting of the lovers of music on St. Cecilia's day, was published in the same year by request of the stewards. In the dedicatory letter, Estwick deplores the tendency of the age to ‘a neglect, if not a disuse, of church musick.’ Another sermon delivered at St. Paul's, was published in 1698. His manuscript music is preserved at the Music School, and at Christ Church Library, Oxford; it includes a motet, songs, and odes to be performed at the Acts.

The source of the Kodina is in the swamps in the southern part of Primorsky District, about a dozen kilometers southeast of Lake Voyozero (which belongs to the Northern Dvina basin, not to the Onega Basin). The river flows in the southern direction, enters Onezhsky District and turns southwest. It is populated downstream from the selo of Kodino. The mouth of the Kodina is in the place where the Onega is separated into two streams (the Kodina empties into the eastern one), downstream from the village of Antsiferovsky Bor. The Kodina flows in the coniferous forests (taiga), and until the 1990s, the river was used for timber rafting. Downstream from Kodino, there are occasional open areas and floodplains, occupied by meadows.

In his early days, while he was minister at Llanuwchllyn, Merionethshire (where he was ordained 1769), he met with a good deal of persecution and was compelled to apply to the king's bench for a mandamus before he was allowed to conduct the services in peace. He removed in 1777 to Haverfordwest, and thence to Drewen in Cardiganshire, 24 June 1779, where he was much beloved, and remained till his death, 3 March 1821. His first duty here was to undo the work of his predecessor, who was in sympathy with the Arminian movement, then led by the Rev. David Lloyd of Llwynrhydowen. Evans showed great tact and gradually and successfully led back the congregation to the prevailing Calvinism of the day. The Baptist controversy which began about 1788 was originated by the great activity of a few Baptists in the neighbourhood, who distributed large numbers of tracts among members of the congregation. This compelled the minister to act on the defensive. The historian of nonconformity in Wales says that probably nothing abler was ever written on both sides of this question of baptism than the letters of Evans on the one side and those of Dr. William Richards of Lynn on the other.

It was located in what is now part of the city of Toyokawa, Aichi Prefecture, Japan. It was one of the largest armaments plant in the Empire of Japan, but was not bombed by Allied forces until after the bombing of Hiroshima in World War II. History A Type 99 aircraft cannon captured by Allied forces Plans to establish the Toyokawa Navy Arsenal were made in March 1937, along with the Suzuka Naval Arsenal in Mie Prefecture initially for the purpose of supplying 13 mm and 20 mm auto-cannons for the rapidly expanding Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service. The land was acquired in the towns of Toyokawa and Uchikubo and village of Yawata in eastern Aichi Prefecture by July 1938, and construction began on October 1, 1938. The formal opening ceremony for the new facility was held on December 15, 1939. The new plant initially covered 200 hectares, and had 1500 employees. However, as the Second Sino-Japanese War quickly evolved into World War II, the demand for arms and ammunition increased. The Toyokawa Naval Arsenal expanded its facilities to 330 hectares in 1940. The northern 60 percent was devoted to the production of gunpowder and ammunition, and the southern 40 percent of the area was devoted to machining and assembly work, especially for the Type 92 7.7 mm aircraft gun and the Type 99 20mm aircraft cannon. In addition to aircraft weapons, the Toyokawa Navy Arsenal also produced guntō Japanese swords, bayonets, the Nambu pistol and a variety of small caliber artillery weapons as well as optical equipment such as rangefinders and binoculars. By February 1945, the plant employed 56,400 workers, including over 6000 school children who had been conscripted into working at the plant by the Japanese military. The plant also included its own water and gas facilities and dormitories for workers. Despite its obvious military significance, the Toyokawa Navy Arsenal was not bombed until the very last stages of World War II.Carter.

Life Concerning the early life of Joachim before he became Patriarch of Constantinople, we know that he was Metropolitan of Drama and that he was young, not particularly learned but very able in ecclesiastic matters and striking for virtue. In autumn 1498 he was elected as Patriarch with the support of king Constantine II of Georgia, taking the place of Nephon II who in turn was supported by the rulers of Wallachia. Georgia was Christian country independent from the Ottoman Empire and semi-autonomous from a religious point of view, but which could sometimes apply impressive influence on the patriarchal elections. As Patriarch, Joachim was quite popular with his flock: while he was on the road to Georgia to raise funds, the Metropolitan of Selymbria offered the Sultan one thousand gold pieces to be appointed Patriarch in Joachim's place, but the faithful collected the same amount among themselves and paid it to the Sultan to avoid Joachim's deposition. In spring 1502, Joachim was however deposed by Sultan Bayezid II when the latter discovered that Joachim had ordered the building of a Christian church of stone without his permission. After Joachim's deposition, the new Patriarch-elect was again Nephon II, who however refused the office. Then the rulers of Wallachia moved their support to Pachomius I, who was elected in early 1503 and reigned for about one year, until early 1504 when the friends of Joachim collected 3500 gold pieces to restore him on the throne (500 pieces more than the usual fee paid to the Sultan for each patriarchal appointment). Joachim's second patriarchate lasted only a few months: shortly after being elected, Joachim traveled north trying to restore friendly relations with his political enemies, but both Radu IV the Great of Wallachia and Bogdan III the One-Eyed of Moldavia refused to reconcile with him. Joachim died in 1504 during his sojourn in Wallachia, in Târgoviște or in Drista, and he was succeeded again by Pachomius I.

He also established the Mandalay-based performance troupe, \\"Sein Maha Thabin\\" (), which remained family-run until 1993, when it was closed by his grandson Ye Sein. Innovations Po Sein was particularly successful at introducing a variety of stage innovations, by explaining the changes to audience and interacting with them throughout the performance. Also, he adapted the Buddhist Jataka tales, which had previously been exclusively performed by marionette puppets, for live actors, by creating dances and songs as part of the performance repertoire. Until the late 1800s, it was considered taboo for live actors to depict such sacred stories of the previous lives of the Buddha. His innovations led to a decline in the popularity of the marionette theater troupes, by breaking their monopoly on Jataka plays. Furthermore, he revolutionized Burmese stagecraft by incorporating a raised stage for dramatic performances, which had been previously confined to marionette theater, which uses a raised platform (hence the name amyint thabin or ). He modernized the classical dance drama form, zat pwe (), by adding variety acts, chorus lines, introducing admission. He was also the first male lead to have intimate onstage interactions with the lead actress, which has since become a norm in couple dances. =Costumes= Po Sein is credited with introducing stockings and slippers as part of dancers' costumes; they had previously danced barefoot.

Red colour is due to added Ponceau 4R. Brand Amflor. Amine fluorides are dental drugs. History Amine fluorides were developed in the 1950s by GABA in collaboration with the Institute of Dentistry of the University of Zurich (Switzerland). For the first time, in 1954, Wainwright showed in his study the high permeability of tooth enamel to organic molecules like urea. This aspect made him ask himself if it was not possible to enrich the contents of the enamel with fluoride by using organic molecules as carrier, which were chemically bonded to amino fluoride. In 1957, Mühlemann, Schmid and König published the results of their studies in vitro, in which they demonstrated that some compounds with amino fluoride were obviously superior to those with inorganic fluoride in reducing the solubility of the enamel. In the same year, Irwin, Leaver and Walsh published the results of their experiments in vitro, which demonstrated that monoamine-aliphatic compounds offered protection to the enamel against acid decalcification. In 1967, Muhleman demonstrated the superiority of organic fluoride comparing to inorganic fluoride in preventing dental decay. He observed that amine fluoride had a pronounced affinity regarding enamel, by raising the quantity of fluoride in the enamel and also having an antienzyme effect on the microbial activity of dental plaque. His conclusions were the following: * Amino fluorides produce the most powerful enrichment in fluoride of the enamel, even in low concentration. * The carious preventive action is due to fluoride on one side and to the anti-enzyme effect of the organic fraction on the other side and * Also by arresting the formation of dental plaque, as a result of the tensioactive properties. In this way amine fluorides were born in GABA S.A.-BASEL laboratory. The commercial products, which contain amine fluoride or compounds of this with tin-fluoride in their formula, are present under different forms:  gels,  fluids,  dentifrice,  mouth rinse. Structure The unique position of the amine fluoride is based on their special molecular structure: the fluoride ion is bound to an organic fatty acid amine fragment. This is not the case for the inorganics fluorides such as sodium fluoride and sodium monofluorophosphate. Amine fluorides have a hydrophobic molecular moiety, the non-polar tail, with a hydrophilic component, the polar amine head. For this reason, they act like surfactants, reducing the surface tension of saliva, and forming a homogeneous film on all oral surfaces. Due to their surface activity the amine fluorides are rapidly dispersed in the oral cavity and wet all surfaces. In contrast, in the case of inorganic fluorides the counter ion (e.g. sodium) has no transport function; the fluoride is statistically distributed in the oral cavity. Amine fluoride covers the tooth surfaces with a homogenous molecular layer. This continuous film prevents rapid rinsing off by the saliva. The amine fluorides are thus available as an active agent for a longer period. Amine fluorides have a slightly acidic pH. For this reason, fluoride ions can combine rapidly with the calcium in dental enamel to form calcium fluoride. This acts as a fluoride depot over a longer period: Under cariogenic conditions fluoride ions are made available stimulating the remineralisation of dental enamel and thus prevent acid attacks.

Infection causes arthritis and tenosynovitis in poultry. It can also cause respiratory disease. Avian orthoreovirus infection is more common in young birds, because resistance begins to develop from as young as two weeks of age. It is also reportedly more common in broilers. Distribution of avian orthoreovirus is worldwide and it is present in most poultry flocks. It can be transmitted horizontally via the faeces or rarely, vertically. It is not a zoonosis. The most common symptom is lameness. There may also be swelling or bleeding around the joints. Gastrointestinal, respiratory and neurological signs have also been reported. Presumptive diagnoses may be made based on the observation of clinical signs. They can be confirmed using virus isolation, complement fixation, ELISA, immunodiffusion or histopathology (following postmortem exam). Description Avian reovirus belongs to the genus Orthoreovirus, and Reoviridae family. They are non- enveloped viruses that undergo replication in the cytoplasm of infected cells. It has icosahedral symmetry and contains a double-shelled arrangement of surface protein. Virus particles can range between 70–80 nm. Morphologically, the virus is a double stranded RNA virus that is composed of ten segments. The genome and proteins that are encoded by the genome can be separated into three different sizes ranging from small, medium, or large. Of the eleven proteins that are encoded for by the genome, two are nonstructural, while the remaining nine are structural. Avian reoviruses can withstand a pH range of 3.0–9.0. Ambient temperatures are suitable for the survival of these viruses, which become inactive at 56 °C in less than an hour. Common areas where this virus can survive include galvanized metal, glass, rubber, feathers, and wood shavings. Avian reovirus can survive for up to ten days on these common areas in addition to up to ten weeks in water. Cultivation and observation of the effects of avian reovirus is most often performed in chicken embryos. If infected into the yolk sac, the embryo will succumb to death accompanied by hemorrhaging of the embryos and cause the foci on the liver to appear yellowish-green. There are several primary chicken cell cultures/areas that are susceptible to avian reoviruses, which include the lungs, liver, kidney, and fibroblasts of the chick embryo. Of the following susceptible areas, liver cells from the chick embryo have been found to be the most sensitive for primary isolation from clinical material. Typically, the CPE effect of avian reoviruses is the production of syncytia. CPE, or cytopathic effects are the visible changes in a host cell that takes place because of viral infection. Syncytia is a single cell or cytoplasmic mass containing several nuclei, formed by fusion of cells or by division of nuclei. Genome structure The complete genome sequence of avian reovirus is 23,494 bp long and is broken up into 10 segments. The full lengths of each segment are L1 (3,959 nt), L2 (3,830 nt), L3 (3,907 nt), M1 (2,283 nt), M2 (2,158 nt), M3 (1,996 nt), S1 (1,643 nt), S2 (1,324 nt), S3 (1,202 nt), and S4 (1,192 nt). There are 10 proteins that are also involved in the composition of this virus. The lengths of these structural and non-structural proteins are λa (1,293 amino acids), λB (1,259 aa), λC (1,285 aa), μA (732 aa), μB (676 aa), μNS (635 aa), σC (326 aa), σA (416 aa), σB (367 aa), and σNS (367 aa). Virus-host interactions Alpha and beta interferons belong to a family of multifunctional cytokines, which are expressed and activated/distributed by fibroblasts and leukocytes in response to infections. In an experiment where primary cultures of chicken embryo fibroblasts were treated with alpha/beta interferon, results indicated that this interaction induced an antiviral state that strongly inhibited vaccinia and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) replication, but didn't have an effect on avian reovirus, specifically the replication of the S1133 strain. Instead, extracts of cells that were infected with avian-reovirus were able to block the activation of dsRNA-dependent enzymes, enabling the virus to relieve the translation-inhibitory activity of dsRNA. Also, protein σA, which is a core protein of the S1133 strain, binds to dsRNA irreversibly. Removing this protein from this particular viral strain disables the posttranslational capacity of infected cells. Research has shown that this core protein may possibly disrupt the IFN-induced cellular response against avian reovirus through the blockage of enzyme pathways that are dependent on dsRNA. In addition to the possible disruption of IFN-induced cellular responses, chicken embryo fibroblasts that are infected with strain S1133 have displayed significant cytopathic effects. Strain S1133 led to the activation of the intracellular death in the early stages of infection. Although viral gene expression is not necessary, intracellular viral uncoating is the significant process that induces apoptosis. The ability of avian reovirus to induce apoptosis is not restricted to a distinct cell type of virus strain due to the fact that several different isolates of this pathogen could induce apoptosis in different mammalian and avian cell lines. Apoptosis can also be induced in cells that are infected with UV-irradiated reovirus virions and cells infected with ribavirin-treated avian reovirus, which suggests that viral mRNA synthesis and crucial steps that occur during viral replication are not necessary for induction of apoptosis in infected cells. Disregarding infectivity, the number of inoculated virus particles is the significant factor that leads to apoptosis from avian reovirus. Induced apoptosis is stopped when intracellular viral uncoating is blocked.  Diseases  There are several diseases that are caused by avian reovirus, which includes, avian arthritis/tenosynovitis, runting-stunting syndrome, and blue wing disease in chickens. Blue wing disease affects young broiler chickens and has an average mortality rate of 10%. It causes intramuscular and subcutaneous hemorrhages and atrophy of the spleen, bursa of Fabricius, and thymus. When young chickens are experimentally infected with avian reovirus, it is spread rapidly throughout all tissues. This virus is spread most frequently in the skin and muscles, which is also the most obvious site for lesions. Avian arthritis causes significant lameness in joints, specifically the hock joints. In the most severe cases, viral arthritis has caused the tendon to rupture. Chickens that have contracted runting-stunting syndrome cause a number of individuals in a flock to appear noticeably small due to its delayed growth. Diseased chicks are typically pale, dirty, wet, and may have a distending abdomen. Some individuals may display “helicopter-like” feathers in their wings and other feather abnormalities. The virus has also been shown to cause osteoporosis. = Mechanism = The most common route of infection occurs orally, and occasionally through the respiratory tract from the nucleus of congenitally infected hatch mates. Experimental infection of adult chickens through the esophagus, nasal passages, or trachea caused the virus to spread throughout all areas of the enteric, respiratory tract, reproductive tract, and the hock and tendon joints. In an experiment, avian reovirus was recovered from mononuclear, plasma, and erythrocyte cell fractions of blood within 30 hours of infection in young chicks. After 3–5 days, the infection spread throughout the whole body. The main site of viral replication was observed in the enteric tract. A different study of early pathogenesis in chicks infected with virus one day after birth displayed that the bursa of Fabricius and the epithelial cells of the small intestines are the main sites of infection and portal of entry of the virus which quickly disseminates to other organs within a 24- to 48-hour window post infection. The tibiotarsal-tarsometatarsal (hock joint) was the site where virus replication caused the most severe damage and in some extreme cases, tendon rupture. = Immune responses =  Humoral antibodies  The sera of birds infected with avian reovirus display circulating antibodies through the validation of ELISA, agar gel immunodiffusion, indirect immunofluorescence (IIF), and virus neutralization (VN). Virus neutralization identifies type-specific antibodies, which allows for differentiation between strains of viruses through their distinct antigens. The other four tests detect group antigens.  Maternal antibodies  Maternal antibodies have displayed protection against the development of microscopic lesions of tenosynovitis in chicks that have been infected one day after birth. Protection provided by maternal antibodies has served as a foundation of breeder vaccination.  Cell-mediated immunity  An experiment that used monoclonal antibodies that were specific for chick Ia (a chicken class II major histocompatibility complex antigen), and T and B-lymphocytes were observed to determine its effects on cellular infiltrates during the development of reovirus arthritis. Within the synovium collected, plasma cells and T-lymphocytes were the primary inflammatory cells present. During the acute-phase, CD8 cells were present in low numbers. The most activity was observed during the subacute phase with an increase in CD8 and CD4 lymphocytes. At this phase, clusters of IgM-positive, B-cells, T-cells, and plasma cells were also observed. During the chronic phase, a high amount of CD4 T- cells and a few IgM-positive B-cells were observed.  Immunosuppression  Infections of chickens with avian reovirus doesn't disrupt the functional capabilities of their T-cells, but induces suppressor macrophages that inhibit T-cell function. = Diagnosis = Although infection of avian reovirus is spread worldwide, it is rarely the sole cause of a disease. For chickens, the most common manifestation of the disease is joint/limb lameness. Confirming infection of avian reovirus can be detected through an ELISA test by using and observing the expression of σC and σB proteins. However, isolating and identifying reoviruses from tissue samples is very time consuming. Isolation is most successfully attained through inoculation of material into chick embryo cultures or fertile chicken eggs. Inoculation of embryonic eggs through the yolk sac has shown that the virus usually kills the embryos within 5 or 6 days post inoculation. Analyzing the samples, the embryos appeared hemorrhagic and necrotic lesions on the liver were present. (Jones, Onunkwo, 1978). There have also been approaches to identify avian reoviruses molecularly by observing infected tissues with dot- blot hybridization, PCR, and a combination of PCR and RFLP. This combination allows for the reovirus strain to be typed. = Prevention = Vaccines are available (ATCvet codes: for the inactivated vaccine, for the live vaccine, plus various combinations). Given that avian reovirus infections are widespread, the viruses are relatively resistant outside the host, and that vertical and horizontal transmission occurs, eradicating avian reovirus infection in commercial chicken flocks is very unlikely. In addition, absence of detectable seroconversion and failure to detect virus in cloacal swabs are unreliable indicators of resisting infection, or transmission via the egg. Thus, the most proactive and successful approach to controlling this disease is through vaccination. Since chicks are more prone to being detrimentally affected by the disease right after hatching, vaccine protocols that use live and killed vaccines are designed to provide protection during the very early stages of life. This approach has been accomplished through active immunity after early vaccination and a live vaccine or passive immunity from maternal antibodies followed with vaccination of the breeder hens. Currently, efforts toward administering inactivated or live vaccines to breeding stock to allow passive immunity to the offspring via the yolk are being taken. = Epidemiology = Avian reovirus can be transmitted both vertically and horizontally. Egg transmission has been observed after experimental infection, however the rate of transmission is very low. Congenitally infected chicks are assumed to act as a nucleus of infection for the rest of the hatch due to their high probability of becoming infected through the fecal-oral route or through the respiratory tract. Infection may also enter through the exposure of broken skin of the feet or legs of the chickens, where it then can become established in the hock joints. Once the infection has entered the body, avian reovirus can survive in the tissues of chickens for many weeks. Resistance to reovirus infections in chickens is directly related to age. Chicks that are infected one day after birth are more prone to experimentally synthesized tenosynovitis/arthritis than those that were infected at two weeks or older. Chicks that were infected a day after birth also displayed a development of more severe joint lesions and higher intestinal virus titers than those who were infected at two weeks of age. Infectious agents, which increase the pathogenicity of reovirus in the joints of chicken, include Mycoplasma synoviae, Staphylococcus aureus, infectious bursal disease virus, and chicken anemia virus. Avian reoviruses are also typically resistant to certain disinfectants.

The building served as the warehouse for the Guckenheimer Whiskey barrels, which were distilled in Freeport, Pennsylvania, until prohibition caused the company to shut down.  History  The first mention of the lot on which the current building sits was in 1786 when it was sold from John Penn, the brother of William Penn, to John Wilkins.Philadelphia Deed Book, 1786. The lot was sold again in 1821 and 1855 by Sheriff's sale. No buildings were noted to have been located on the lot when Asher Guckenheimer bought the property in September 1863, as the previous structure was burnt during the Great Fire of 1845. Guckenheimer built the current building circa 1882 as a warehouse for his whiskey company, A. Guckenheimer & Bros.“Impetus Given to Probing.” The Pittsburgh Press. October 26, 1905. The Guckenheimer Whiskey company was first established in 1857 by Asher Guckenheimer and his half-brother, Samuel Wertheimer. They originally bought their liquor from Thomas Bell, who had been making a highly regarded product since 1845 in Freeport.“The Story of Pittsburgh and Vicinity,” The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. 1908. Following Bell's death in 1865 they bought his distillery and enlarged it, but the demand outpaced production so they bought a new and much larger facility in 1866. Guckenheimer's Rye became one of the country's most famous brands, scoring a 99 out of 100 at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and winning top honors in 1893. The building that Guckenheimer built in Pittsburgh continuously served as a warehouse for the product until the company disbanded due to prohibition. After Asher Guckenheimer's death the company changed hands several times, and the new owners in 1925 attempted to continue to sell the whiskey despite the prohibition. In 1925 the corporation and 13 of its workers were indicted on charges relating to conspiring to obtain the release of a large quantity of whiskey from bond to sell and deliver it unlawfully.A. Guckenheimer & Bros. Co. et al. v United States. Circuit Court of Appeals, Third Circuit. 3 F.2d 786. February 3, 1925. The company was found guilty and the warehouse was sold to the Landau Brothers Contracting and Building Company. They owned the building until it was again sold to Paddington Associates in 1980 who leased the building to the Stonecipher Law Firm, who remain the current tenants of the building today.“New Mon bridge won’t touch down on Chancery Way.” Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. February 19, 2000. The building was nominated in January 1995 to become a City Historic Site by Preservation Pittsburgh.  Architecture  The building was designed in the Richardsonian Romanesque architectural style. It is one of the best surviving structures in the Market Street commercial district, and is an example of heavy timber construction in a commercial building. The high ceilings, massive wood beams, and exposed brick are all examples of the building's architectural style, and contribute to it being a rarity in Pittsburgh architecture.

He worked on galvanization, public building heating and sanitation, and railroad friction amongst other things. A book, Industrial Man: The Life and Works of Charles Sylvester by Ian Inkster, Ph.D., of Nottingham University, and Maureen S. Bryson, B.S., published in 1999 is a comprehensive work covering his life, his extended family and pedigree, and his published works; including Poems on Various Subjects, 1797; The Epitome of Galvanism, 1804; Appendix of the Elementary Treatise on Chemistry, 1809; Philosophy of Domestic Economy, 1819; On a Method of expressing Chemical Compounds by Algebraic Characters, 1821; On the Motions produced by the Difference in the Specific Gravity of Bodies, 1822; Report on Rail-roads and Locomotive Engines, 1825; and On the best method of Warming and Ventilating Houses and other Buildings, 1829.  Biography  Sylvester was christened 10 July 1774, in Sheffield, in the West Riding of Yorkshire. He was the son of Joseph Sylvester and Sarah Mills who had been married in nearby Rotherham on 5 March 1767. It was thought for a time that Charles Sylvester was part of the Sylvester family from Norton, Derbyshire. His links to the Sylvesters in Sheffield and Rotherham have been well documented. He married Sarah Dixon 13 August 1798, in Sheffield, three months before the birth of their son John. Sarah had two more boys and three girls, but John was the only boy to survive to adulthood. Additional information on these children can be found here. Toilet design Sylvester experimented with coating iron and steel with zinc. The method patented by Sylvester and two others involved building a battery (galvanic cell) from the items that one wanted to plate with zinc, and then leaving the construction in seawater. In 1807, Sylvester moved to Derby where he worked with William Strutt who was building Derby's Royal Infirmary. Sylvester was instrumental in documenting a novel heating system for the new hospital. He published his ideas in The Philosophy of Domestic Economy; as exemplified in the mode of Warming, Ventilating, Washing, Drying, & Cooking, . . . in the Derbyshire General Infirmary in 1819. The book is dedicated to Strutt, and Sylvester is careful to assign many of the inventions to Strutt, and to note that the heating designs installed in the new infirmary had already been tried on Strutt and his friends' houses. Sylvester documented the new ways of heating hospitals that were included in the design, and the healthier features such as self-cleaning and air-refreshing toilets. The toilets had a carefully designed door that would exchange the air for fresh as each user exited. The same door action also washed the basin. Warm air stove Sylvester described the infirmary's features including its fireproof construction, laundry and novel heating that allowed the patients to breathe fresh heated air whilst old air was channeled up to a glass and iron dome at the centre. Sylvester described the advances that Strutt had made and this was successful in three ways. Sylvester was able to take the new ideas for heating and apply them in numerous other building projects. The Derby Infirmary was seen as a leader in European architecture and architects and visiting royalty were brought to see its features. Strutt was proposed to become a member of the Royal Society by five distinguished proposers which included Marc Isambard Brunel and James Watt. Sylvester with Strutt was a member of Erasmus Darwin's Derby Philosophical Society. Sylvester was commissioned by the Chairman of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway to advise them on the subject of the railroad and he wrote a Report on rail-roads and locomotive engines. Sylvester included a comparison between canals and railways. He observed that greater power will deliver more speed on a railroad, but on the canal the power required to increase speed varies by the square of the velocity.

The chapter describes the legendary Yu the Great and the provinces of his time. Most modern scholars believe it was written in the fifth century BCE or later. Contents and significance Conjectural map of the Nine Provinces The chapter can be divided into two parts. The first describes the nine provinces of Ji (冀), Yan (兗), Qing (青), Xu (徐), Yang (揚), Jing (荊), Yu (豫), Liang (梁), and Yong (雍), with the improvement works conducted by Yu in each province. The second enumerates Yu's surveys of the rivers of the empire, followed by an idealized description of five concentric domains of five hundred li each, from the royal domain (甸服 Diānfú) around the capital to the remote wild domain (荒服 Huāngfú). Later, this would become important in the justification for the concept of Tianxia or \\"All Under Heaven\\" as a means to back up the territorial and other claims of successive Chinese dynasties. Origin and versions Although the Yu Gong is traditionally dated to the Xia Dynasty (c. 2070 – c. 1600 BCE), most modern scholars agree that the work is considerably more recent. Tradition dictates that Confucius (551–479 BCE) compiled the Book of Documents and included the Yu Gong, although it is more likely that this was done later. Wang Guowei suggested in his New Confirmation of Ancient History (古史新证) that the Yu Gong was written at the start of the Zhou Dynasty, but most scholars now agree with the view of Gu Jiegang that it is a product of the Warring States, Qin or Early Han periods. References to maritime history in the Analects of Confucius and the Yu Gong suggest their origin in a single culture while the appearance of the West River (西河) and South River (南河) in the latter indicate that the author came from the State of Wei. In the preface to his Commentary on the Yu Gong Map (禹贡图注), Ming Dynasty Scholar Ài Nányīng (艾南英) (1583－1646) considered the Yu Gong the \\"progenitor of all geographic texts both ancient and modern.\\"《禹贡》一书，古今地理志之祖者。 Commentaries Over the centuries numerous scholars have written interpretations of and commentaries on the Yu Gong.

The tale first appeared in Book 5 of the Liezi, a Daoist text of the 4th century BC, and was retold in the Garden of Stories by the Confucian scholar Liu Xiang in the 1st century BC. It was also used by Mao Zedong in a famous speech in 1945.  Story  The myth concerns a Foolish Old Man of 90 years who lived near a pair of mountains (given in some tellings as the Taihang and the Wangwu mountains, in Yu Province). He was annoyed by the obstruction caused by the mountains and sought to dig through them with hoes and baskets. When questioned as to the seemingly impossible nature of his task, the Foolish Old Man replied that while he may not finish this task in his lifetime, through the hard work of himself, his children, and their children, and so on through the many generations, some day the mountains would be removed if he persevered.

There are spatula-shaped lower leaves a few centimeters long and a few leaves higher on the plant. The inflorescence is a raceme of mustardlike flowers with white spoon-shaped petals just under a centimeter in length. The fruit is a silique. The plant often reproduces vegetatively by cloning. As of 2000 there was only one population of this plant. It is located adjacent to the Kneeland Airport on the Kneeland Prairie near Eureka in Humboldt County. In the area there are three colonies growing on separate serpentine outcrops on the prairie. Two of the colonies are separated by the Kneeland Airport. The plant is limited to the serpentine soils of the local landscape. This plant is threatened by development at the airport and other facilities nearby, including roads and a helitack base. In the past few decades the amount of available habitat has been decreased 50% or more, possibly as much as 70%. It has also led to habitat fragmentation as the population is bisected by the airport and the road.

This mechanism translocates proteins lacking an N-terminal signal peptide across the cell membrane in one step, as it does not require an intermediate periplasmic process to cleave the signal peptide. It is a common pathway amongst Gram-negative bacteria for secreting toxic and flagellar proteins. The pathway apparatus comprises three components: two within the inner membrane and one within the outer. An FHIPEP protein is located within the inner membrane, although it is unknown which component it constitutes. FHIPEP proteins have all about 700 amino acid residues. Within the sequence, the N terminus is highly conserved and hydrophobic, suggesting that this terminus is embedded within the membrane, with 6-8 transmembrane (TM) domains, while the C terminus is less conserved and appears to be devoid of TM regions. It is possible that members of the FHIPEP family serve as pores for the export of specific proteins.

Here it runs parallel with (but clearly separated from) the road - at other places it goes through forest and dune areas. Cycling in Denmark is both a common and popular recreational and utilitarian activity. Bicycling infrastructure is a dominant feature of both city and countryside infrastructure with segregated dedicated bicycle paths and lanes in many places and the network of 11 Danish National Cycle Routes (along with many regional routes) extends more than nationwide. Often bicycling and bicycle culture in Denmark is compared to the Netherlands as a bicycle-nation.  Infrastructure  = Cycle paths and lanes = intersection bicycle highway' in Copenhagen. There are an estimated of segregated dedicated bicycle paths and lanes in Denmark and the four biggest cities alone account for more than with in Aalborg, in Odense, in Aarhus and in Copenhagen. Cycle paths are often raised above the shoulder of the road and separated by a curb, but on older roads it is more common to have a cycle lane separated by a thick white line and sometimes the lane may be marked by coloured asphalt. Massive infrastructure investments are taking place to create more cycle ways and thus increase safety. At intersections, the continuation of the cycle way or lane is often highlighted by a broad blue band to increase its visibility and cyclists may find that they have their own set of traffic lights. In general both paths and lanes are designed for the more slow pace of utility cycling as opposed to more speedy designs in other countries. The Danish Roads Directorate acknowledges that the Danish cycle track system \\"functions best when cyclists travel at relatively low speeds\\". In Copenhagen a system of interconnected green cycle routes, \\"greenways\\", is under development, with the aim of facilitating fast, safe and pleasant cycle transport across the city. The network will cover more than and consist of 22 routes. As of 2011, there were of greenways in Copenhagen. =Danish National Cycle Routes= The 11 Danish National Cycle Routes form a network of cycling routes throughout the country. They are important routes enabling bicycle tourism and showing off Denmark's natural beauty as well as its regional towns and villages. = Integration with other means of transportation = Cycling is integrated into both the national, the regional and the local train services in Denmark. Cycles are permitted on trains to facilitate mixed-mode commuting. This is most visible in the urban and suburban rail network of Metropolitan Copenhagen, the S-trains, where cycles can be transported in specified carriages found at the front and rear of each train. As of 2011 there is no charge for taking cycles on any S-train. A number of Movia bus lines in Region Zealand allow the carriage of cycles for an extra charge (no charge on Copenhagen Harbour Buses) unless the bus driver deems the bus too crowded.https://www.moviatrafik.dk/presse/presse-og- nyheder?vis=509693921939682 = Cycle parking = Available parking facilities are often inadequate in the major cities. Nørreport Station in Copenhagen. Although there appear to be a large number of cycle parking facilities in Denmark, there is actually a severe lack of available cycle stands. Those that do exist are often poorly positioned, particularly in the bigger cities. In 2008, with a view to remedying the situation, the Danish Cyclists Federation published a Bicycle Parking Manual with a number of guidelines. They aim to be of immediate practical use to users but also offer advice for city planners wishing to improve facilities in the future.  Utility cycling  Postal bike used in a city by Post Danmark Danish police officer on a bicycle Most children start bicycling to school from age 8-10 and continue to do so until at least 18 (the minimum age for acquiring a drivers license in Denmark), but in the bigger cities some people will rely on the cycle as the primary transportation throughout life. Most Danish public schools also educate 10–12 years in traffic rules, behaviour and regulations as a part of their regular curriculum. Utility bicycles which require little maintenance and are suited to load carrying are very popular. However, all other types of cycles are accommodated on the bicycle paths/ways, from racing bicycles with tri-bars through streamlined velomobiles. Two- and three-wheeled cargo bicycles are also becoming increasingly popular, with the trend starting in Copenhagen and spreading out through the country. The common use of cycles and the growing support infrastructure for utility cycling, has encouraged Denmark to brand itself as a leading nation in everyday cycling. It has also led to the reinvention of the term Copenhagenization as a concept in urban planning and design relating to the implementation of better pedestrian facilities and cycling infrastructure for utility cycling in cities, and been an inspiration for an increasing number of cycle chic blogs spawning from Copenhagen Cycle Chic. Danish postal workers have been using cycles for transport in towns and cities to deliver mail for several generations. Likewise small shop delivery services used cycles until the mid-1960s. As a result of a move to supermarket shopping, delivery by bicycles declined, though the growth of messenger services sparked a new life for delivery by bike in the mid 80's. Since the mid-2000s cycle rickshaws (velotaxis) have operated in the bigger cities and offer short distance journeys (usually up to ) - primarily during summer. Around the same period small enterprises started selling coffee or soup from mobile tricycle stalls around city centres. Since March 1, 2009 the police in Copenhagen have been patrolling on cycles. Besides being a quick and efficient means of transportation, it has been found to increase visibility and to improve contact with citizens.  Danish cycle VIN-system  The Danish cycle VIN-system is a system introduced in 1942 by the Danish government, providing all cycles in Denmark with a unique code. The code is a combination of letters and digits embedded into the bicycle frame and made up of a manufacturer-code, a serial-number and construction year. By law it has been illegal since 1948 to sell cycle frames in Denmark without an embedded VIN and, as a result, insurance companies in Denmark do not pay indemnities for stolen cycles without a VIN.  Regular cycle events in Denmark  * Danmark Rundt, a national Danish stage race since 1985, usually held in late July or early August * A yearly 6 day track race, usually held in Ballerup in late January or early February since 1934 * Rundetårn Unicycle Race, every year in spring, a unicycle race is held in the tower's 7.5-turn helical corridor. The contestants have to go up and down the Rundetårn. The world record, set in 1988, is 1 minute and 48.7 seconds.  Tourists  Shared bicycle system in Frederikshavn It is quite common in Denmark to rent a cycle for riding around the countryside or the city. Most cities have a form of a bicycle sharing system. The method and pricing varies from location to location: the Copenhagen City Bikes in Copenhagen, for example, required a deposit of DKK 20 and restricted the use of the cycle to a defined area in the city centre, whereas other companies require documentation and a higher deposit. Bycykel in Aalborg is similar to the system that was in Copenhagen, for DKK 20 you can drive around in the city. Cycle rental shops are quite common and many different types of cycles are available. In Denmark, like the Netherlands, bicycle helmets are rarely worn by adults. A parliamentary proposal in 2009 to introduce a mandatory helmet law for children in Denmark was defeated.  Cars and cycles  In general cycles and cars coexist quite well in Denmark and, unlike the Netherlands, Denmark does not have strict liability for car- drivers, but instead has a system that partially resembles it. There are two forms of liability that comes into action: liability in regards to the Danish traffic law (Danish: Færdselsloven) and liability in damages in regards to the insurance companies. In an accident where a car going the right way in a one- way street and hits a cyclist going the wrong way, there will be a liability for both the car's owner (who will not necessarily be the driver) and the cyclist. This is due to a requirement for liability insurance (Danish: ansvarsforsikring) for vehicle owners; §105 the insurance companies will always apply this and thus make the vehicle's owner liable for damages. However the cyclist may be deemed liable by the Danish legal system for violating the one-way restriction while the driver may escape charges. In that case the car owner's insurance company may seek reimbursement (Danish: regres) from the cyclist. However, in the majority of the accidents the car driver is found liable in both regards; in 1999, in 90% of the accidents involving cars and cyclists the car-drivers were found fully liable.  Rules  , cyclists in Denmark can receive a fine for cycling without lights after a certain time of day; using a hand-held mobile phone while cycling; having defective brakes, reflectors, etc.; cycling against a red light; cycling against the direction of traffic; cycling on a pedestrian crossing; cycling on the left side of a bicycle path; not respecting traffic signs or arrows; breaking the unconditional right of way; not signaling; cycling with no hands on the handlebars; cycling on the sidewalk or footpath; holding onto another vehicle; cycling with two people on a bicycle that only has one seat (both persons will receive a fine); or positioning oneself in the wrong place before or while making a turn. Cyclists can also receive a warning if their bell does not work. Even though there is no fixed blood alcohol level above which it is illegal to ride a bicycle, cyclists can receive a fine for cycling under the influence if the police assess that doing so would be irresponsible. In intersections, cyclists wanting to turn left are not allowed to use the left- turn lanes that are meant for cars, but must cross the intersection first and turn left from there. If separate bike lanes are available, cyclists must use them. Bike lights must be lit after sunset until sunrise, or in case of bad visibility also during day time. Blinking lights are allowed with a minimum frequency of 120 flashes per minute (2 Hz). Blinking orange front-facing lights are not allowed (due to possible confusion with vehicle turn signals). All bikes sold since 1988 must have brakes on both front and back wheels.

The Camaldolese monks were invited to settle in Bieleany by Grand Court Marshal Mikołaj Wolski in 1603. The monastery was built between 1609–1630. The construction of the building was supervised by Walenty von Säbisch but after the collapse of part of the monastery the supervision over the works was subsequently taken over by Italian architect Andrea Spezza. By 1630, the monastery was completed according to his plans. The richly-decorated interior of the church is the result of works by another prominent Italian architect of the period Giovanni Battista Falconi. Inside the Royal Chapel there are paintings by Tommaso Dolabella the court painter of the Polish king Sigismund III Vasa. The central part of the presbytery features a painting by a Polish painter and graphic artist in the Romantic style Michał Stachowicz depicting the Assumption of Mary.

History =Applicant City phase= The Turkish Olympic Committee (TMOK) announced the selection of Istanbul as Turkey's candidate on July 7, 2011. Turkey's candidacy was announced officially by Prime Minister Erdogan on August 13, 2011. Hasan Arat, who heads Istanbul 2020 Bid committee, is optimistic about the city's fifth bid, stating that over the past several years the city has seen the development of new venues and infrastructure improvements. He stated that Turkey's fast growing economy can also greatly benefit the bid. In January 2012, Istanbul 2020 sent a delegation to the 2012 Winter Youth Olympics in Innsbruck to help promote the bid. In March 2012, Istanbul successfully hosted the 2012 IAAF World Indoor Championships, which is seen as a positive step forward for Istanbul's bid to host the 2020 Olympics. In March 2012, Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan stated that Turkey is also interested in bidding to host the 2020 UEFA European Football Championship. Turkey bid to host UEFA Euro 2016 but lost to France by one vote. In April 2012, Turkey submitted a bid to host the UEFA Euro 2020 Championship. Istanbul 2020 has stated that the Olympic bid still has the support of the government. On May 8, 2012 IOC President Jacques Rogge stated that if Istanbul is awarded the 2020 Olympics that they would have to withdraw as hosts of UEFA Euro 2020. IOC rules state that an Olympic host nation may not host another major sporting event in the country in the same year as the Olympics. While it initially looked like Turkey would be the sole bidder for UEFA Euro 2020, two other bids for the event have also been submitted. A joint bid among Ireland, Scotland and Wales was submitted. In addition, a bid from Azerbaijan and Georgia was also submitted. =Candidate City phase= On May 23, 2012, the IOC Selected Istanbul as a Candidate City for the 2020 Summer Olympics. Right after being shortlisted as a candidate city, it was announced that the Vice President of the Turkish Olympic Committee Hasan Arat will serve as the head of Istanbul's bid for the 2020 Olympics. In July 2012 the bid received the endorsement of American Olympic gold-medalist Mark Spitz who won a total of nine Olympic gold medals between 1968 and 1972. The Prime Minister of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan attended the London 2012 Olympics. At the end of May 2012 it was announced that a third bridge over the Bosphorus would be built. This bridge will help to ease traffic in the city should Istanbul be successful in being awarded the 2020 Olympics. The bridge is set to open by 2015, and was part of the original application. The Istanbul Metro has 58 stations in service, with 23 more under construction. It was announced in December 2012 that the UEFA Euro 2020 Championship would be held throughout Europe rather than being held among one or two host nations. This decision therefore eliminated the potential conflict Turkey would have had due to that fact they had bids to host the Olympics and the UEFA Championship in the same year.Euro 2020 to be held across EuropeEuro 2020 to take place across Europe - UEFA In December 2012, Istanbul hosted the 2012 FINA Short Course World Championships at the Sinan Erdem Dome.

Inose was quoted saying, “Well, compare the two countries where they have yet to build infrastructure, very sophisticated facilities. So from time to time, like Brazil, I think it’s good to have a venue for the first time. But Islamic countries, the only thing they share in common is Allah and they are fighting with each other and they have classes.” In Promoting His City for 2020 Games, Tokyo’s Bid Chairman Tweaks Others Criticizing rival bids are forbidden under IOC rules. Following Inose's statement, Tokyo 2020 made a statement saying that they \\"have the utmost respect for all candidate cities and have always taken pride in bidding in a spirit based on the Olympic values of excellence, respect and friendship.” Tokyo 2020 organizers say they ‘respect’ IOC bid rules after governor’s remarks on Istanbul Inose apologized for his comments a few days later and stated that he was \\"fully committed\\" to respecting IOC rules. Tokyo Governor Apologizes for Remarks In June 2013, Istanbul mayor Kadir Topbaş gave an interview expressing concern that the police's actions following an anti- government protest would jeopardize Istanbul's bid to host the 2020 Summer Olympics, saying \\"As Istanbul's mayor going through such an event, the fact that the whole world watched saddens me.

Evans, born on 25 July 1831, was educated under Professor Key at University College School. The death of his father compelled him to leave school at an early age, and in 1846 he began work in a solicitor's office. In 1852 Evans was appointed a clerk in the chancery pay office, a post he held until 1882, when his health enforced his retirement. He never married; his residence was at Hampstead, where he lived with his brother and sisters. Evans commenced the study of geology by attending lectures delivered in 1855 by Professor Owen and Dr. Melville. In 1858 he began to collect fossils from the tertiary formations of the south of England, and formed during the next twenty-five years very complete sets illustrating the strata of the London district. He also investigated the strata of the Isle of Wight, Lyme Regis, Weymouth, Swanage, and Portsmouth. In 1857 Evans took part in founding the Geologists' Association of London, of which he was for many years one of the most active members, and in 1867 he was elected a fellow of the Geological Society. He was fortunate in being able to take advantage of the operations in connection with the main drainage works in the south of London, which afforded opportunities for collecting fossils never likely to recur. He secured suites of specimens of fossil shells of great interest and rarity. Evans also did excellent work in studying the chalk. He made large collections of its fossils, and his paper ‘On some Sections of Chalk between Croydon and Oxted,’ read to the Geologists' Association in January 1870, marks the first English attempt to divide this immensely thick mass of pure white limestone into several zones, and to correlate these zones with those that continental geologists had already established. Altogether Evans was the author of eleven papers on geological subjects, eight of which appeared in the ‘Proceedings’ of the Geologists' Association, including the paper on the chalk mentioned above, along with \\"Geology of the neighbourhood of Portsmouth and Ryde\\". His other work included sketch of the geology of Faringdon in the ‘Geologist’ for August 1866, and ‘Mill Hill in former Ages,’ written for the Mill Hill Magazine. Many of Evans's papers were also published separately. Evans constructed several geological models or relief maps, his method being to paste layer upon layer of cartridge paper so as to secure the necessary elevations, and then to colour the whole according to the outcrop of the rocks. His models of the valley of the Thames near London, of a part of the same on a larger scale, and one of the whole of England, were passed to H. J. Lister of Eldon Road, Hampstead after Evans' death; a map or model of the country round Hastings is in the possession of the corporation of that town; he also constructed a model of the neighbourhood of Sidmouth. Evans's extensive collections of fossils were purchased by Mr. Ernest Westlake of Fordingbridge. Evans died on 16 September 1886.

In the 1980s, the company, which is exclusively owned by the Skalli family, was a pioneer in French varietal wines. Today, the company sells wine from the Languedoc region, the Rhone Valley region, Provence and Napa Valley all over the world.  The 1920s In the 1920s, Robert-Elie Skalli starts working in wine-making and chooses land in the Oran, Mascara and Aïn Témouchent regions of Algeria to plant Southern French variety vines such as Carignan, Cinsault, Grenache, Alicante, and so on. In the 1950s, his son, Francis Skalli, takes over the family business.  Mediterranean vineyards  In 1961, the Skalli family moves to France. Firstly, Francis Skalli decides to buy Terra Vecchia, uncultivated land on the Western coast of Corsica. At the same time, he creates \\"Les Établissements Skalli\\" in Languedoc, which is devoted entirely to Algerian-origin wines and will later become Les Chais du Sud. In 1974, Robert Skalli, the son of Francis Skalli, takes on the family business, furthering the pursuit of its aims through its development in varietal wines and its continued entrenchment in Languedoc.  The French revolution in varietal wines  In 1982, the family acquires the Dollarhide Ranch vineyard in the north-west Napa Valley in California, which is where the St. Supéry Winery comes into being. The Napa Valley’s climate is remarkably similar to the Mediterranean’s, with high levels of sunshine; mild, dry winters; a strong wind; and the influence of the nearby sea. But most importantly, that same year Robert Skalli decides to cross the length and breadth of Languedoc to convince wine-producers to commit themselves to making quality varietal wines by planting new grape varieties such as Chardonnay, Sauvignon blanc, Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. This marks the beginning of a revolution in Languedoc. Five years later, in 1987, on the initiative of a group of professionals trained by Robert Skalli and Jacques Gravegeal, the \\"Vin de Pays d'Oc\\" domination is finally created. Consequently, that year Robert Skalli launches the first Pays d’Oc -certified varietal wines under the brand name Fortant de France. Nowadays, Fortant is a real touchstone in French culture, even making an appearance on cinema screens in such films as Zabou Breitman’s Someone Je l’aimais and more recently, Little White Lies directed by Guillaume Canet.  Expansion into Mediterranean areas  To mark the new millennium, the Skalli family buys the Silène vineyard in the Grès de Montpellier area, and then in 2001, the Maison Bouachon (as well as the \\"Caves Saint-Pierre\\" cellars) in Châteauneuf-du-Pape; finally, in 2006, the family goes into partnership with Gilardi, thereby establishing the business in Provence. In 2009, Skalli wines win much recognition at the International Wine Challenge in London when the company wins the title of Red Winemaker of the Year.

Evans, a native of Marseille, was the offspring of a Welshman and a woman of Provence. A certain resemblance which he bore to Charles, Prince of Wales induced him to come to England in 1648, and pass himself off as the prince. Taking up his quarters at an inn at Sandwich, Kent, he gave out that he had fled from France because Queen Henrietta, his supposed mother, contemplated poisoning him. The Mayor of Sandwich paid homage to him, while one of the aldermen lodged him at his own house, and treated him in every respect as the heir-apparent. Evans received these attentions with condescension, and obtained a number of presents from the well-to-do people of the county. His pretense, however, had an undignified ending. A courtier, whom Queen Henrietta and the real Prince Charles sent over expressly, came to Sandwich and denounced Evans as an impostor. Evans, far from showing any discomfiture, coolly ordered the mayor to take the courtier into custody. Meanwhile, a party of royalists came to seize Evans, who fled by a back door. He was, however, soon captured, conducted to Canterbury, and thence to London, where he was committed to Newgate Prison.

Also the development and application of molecularly targeted therapies. Main branches Molecular oncology has identified genes that are involved in the development of cancer. The research combined diverse techniques ranging from genomics, computational biology, tumour imaging, in vitro and in vivo functional models to study biological and clinical phenotypes. The proteins produced by these genes may serve as targets for novel chemotherapy drugs and other cancer treatments, or imaging scans. Scientists use a range of techniques to validate the role of the novel candidate genes in the development of cancer. The ultimate aim is to translate these findings into improved treatment options for cancer patients.Molecular oncology, University of British Columbia = Gene Targets = There are many different genes being researched for possible cancer therapies. Among the most studied are the p53 gene and the PTEN gene. These genes are major regulators of the cell cycle and other pathways involved in cellular and genomic integrity. By halting the cell cycle, these genes ensure that genetically damaged cells are not passing on that damage to daughter cells. The cell cycle may be paused and if the damage is severe enough, the p53 and PTEN gene pathways may signal for the death of the damaged cells. Both the p53 and PTEN genes are classified as tumor suppressors because their pathways oversee the repair of cells that may replicate out of control with damaged genetic material, eventually leading to cancer growth if not kept in check. Mutations in these genes are seen in more than half of human cancers.  Molecular Oncolytic Therapies  = Immunotherapy = Immune gene therapy is a targeted approach to cancer therapy where actual immune cells of the patient and their genes are manipulated to produce an anti-tumor response. The body's own immune system is used to attack the tumor cells, therefore the immune system can naturally attack the specific cancer cells again to in the future if necessary. Many types of immunotherapies exist including bone marrow transplants, antibody therapies, and various manipulations of host immune cells to target and kill cancer cells. Cellular receptors, antigens, and cofactor molecules are some such cellular manipulations to target cancer cells.  Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cell  Chimeric antigen receptor T cell immunotherapy (CAR-T), possibly combined with cytokines and checkpoint inhibitors, are a regularly used form of immune gene therapy. CAR-T involves manipulation of a patient's natural T cells to express a chimeric antigen receptor. This receptor, now on millions of the patient's T cells, recognizes cancerous cells that express specific antigens. Usually, the T cell antigen receptor is inactive but when the receptor recognizes a certain cancerous antigen, the physical structure of the T cell changes to destroy the cancer cell. This is a method of cancer treatment that works on the cellular and molecular level.  Combining CAR-T with Checkpoint Inhibitors, Cytokines  Some regulatory proteins, specifically immune checkpoint inhibitors, have been found to reduce the ability of T cells to multiply within the body. In order to optimize the efficacy of CAR-T gene therapy, these checkpoint inhibitors can be blocked to stimulate a robust anti-tumor immune response, spearheaded by the CAR-T cells. There are various known inhibitory receptors on the CAR-T cell; through manipulation of these receptors and the molecules that bind them, expression of the CAR-T cell can be amplified. CAR-T cells can also be combined with cytokines to improve the efficacy of the immunotherapy method. Cytokines are messenger molecules that can act on themselves, nearby cells, or distant cells. The signal pathways of these cytokines can be used to enhance CAR-T anti-tumor characteristics. For example, Interleukin 2 (IL2) is a cytokine that acts as a growth factor for various immune system cells, including T cells. In regards to gene therapy, IL2 can be used to increase replication and dispersing of CAR-T cells throughout the body.  Issues with CAR-T Therapy  There is room for improvement with this gene therapy approach. Firstly, the antigens of interest expressed on the cancer cells may sometimes be expressed on regular body cells, too. This means the body's T cells will attack its own healthy cells instead of the cancer cells when the antigen is lacking specificity with just the cancer cell. A possible solution to this problem is to include two different antigen receptors on the CAR-T cells to make them even more specific. The second issue with the CAR-T immunotherapy approach is that it can cause cytokine release syndrome. This is when an excess of pro-inflammatory factors are released by the immune system and can cause unpleasant side effects for the patient like nausea and a high fever. = Gene Therapy = In the past few decades, gene therapy has emerged as a targeted way to treat cancer. Gene therapy introduces foreign genetic sequences to diseased cells in order to change the expression of these cancerous cells that are functioning with severely damaged genomes. Cancer cells do not behave like normal cells, so the methods for ridding the body of these cells are more complicated. Manipulation of the pathways controlled by certain genes and their regulators are a large branch of cancer research.

He is also known for leaving his library to his birthplace of Besançon and for his correspondence with Madeleine de Scudéry.Universal Biography, Ancient and Modern, Jean Baptiste Boisot, p. 585  Biography  Jean-Baptiste Boisot is the third son of Claude Boisot, governor of the imperial city of Besançon from 1652 to 1658 and merchant- banker, father of twelve children. Very quickly, at the end of the century, the family was Boisot Anomie, then protected by the minister of Louis XIV of France, François-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois.

During his appointment as abbot of Saint-Vincent, it's not a trip to Paris to meet with the king presented to him by Pellisson. =Exemplary church life= The life of Father Boisot is exemplary as it is linked to the piety and generosity. In times of plague, he will give up all his property and rescues the poor. Boisot filled his letters epistles, of odes, compliments and translations he sends his friend Pellisson example for his Treatise on the Eucharist, among other passages containing books Saint Jerome, of Lactantius and of Tertullian Corona. Sometimes he joined the Spanish and Italian letters are in the collection of Granvelle. =A historian of service to others= Throughout his life, Jean-Baptiste Boisot has applied to put his knowledge to help others, his many notes and papers rank of Cardinal Granvelle make him a historian applied.Historical Dictionary of Louis Moréri, page 327. [archive] The work on the papers of Cardinal Granvelle represents nearly 80 folio volumes that can currently still find library Besançon. He even had the idea of writing the life of Cardinal, as reported in a letter to his friend Pellisson: :\\"I picked up almost all of the great shipwreck debris. Two persons of quality (the Comte de Saint-love and Baron Thoraise) gave me what remained for them. I bought what was still scattered here and there; and counselor of my friends (Mr. Chifflet advisor Parliament Besançon), brother of the abbot I mentioned, seeing that he was no longer a conservoit fragment price that I avois already gathered, kindly suffer him to pass my hands. I added several original pieces from both ancient and modern, dug in various places, and to prevent a new disaster, I took care of them connect.\\"BMB, Ms 1244, Letter of Boisot to Pellisson on a draft biography of cardinal Granvelle. Jean Mabillon admired in addition to the library, antique cabinet and tables of Boisot. All these elements can be concluded that Jean-Baptiste Boisot was an important figure in the community Bisontine, figure sponsorship and provincial scholarship of the seventeenth century, his name is known beyond the French borders. He died 4 December 1694, at the age of fifty-six, in his abbey and bequeath to his hometown of Besançon its most valuable asset: its library. The magistrates of Besançon made him magnificent funeral orations, which they attended en masse. On 9 December, the city of Besançon decided to celebrate an office for the repose of his soul to the Cordeliers. Several exchanges are then carried out between the mayor and the Benedictines to establish an inventory of his collection, he begins a few days after his death, 5 January 1695. The will of the Father Boisot Extract the solemn testament made by Reverend Lord Sir Jean-Baptiste Boisot, Kirton, Abbot of Saint-Vincent de Besançon, Prior of Grandecour and Loye, passed by notary Jean Colin, royal notary audit Besançon 27 November 1694, published in Parliament Ladit city and to Sir Charles Bouvot, advisor to Commissioner MP 7 December of that year, in which he will set for his heir, Sir Claude Boisot, his brother, said Parliament Speaker. Entry of the Mazarine library :\\"Item, I give and bequeath to the Benedictine fathers Rds Besançon any and all my books, bound and unbound manuscripts that belong with my bronze and silver, ancient and modern, and Coin and cabinets in which they are enclosed in charge and if they will all in a room which is open twice a week for all those who wish to enter; which will be able to read and study as much time as they wish during the two days, yet without it they be allowed to divert any book; and so lesdit books and medals Aussy well as busts and paintings which will be spoken after cy, should keep forever for the benefit of learned men; I want to hear and that an inventory of all it stands before a notary and tesmoins in the presence of my heir cy named after that double that inventory be made, one of which will be placed in the hands of my said heir, and other gentlemen will be brought to the Magistrate of the city, so they are solicitous conservation desdit books and other things specified as above set estans the monuments that I dedicate to posterity.\\" :\\"Also I give and bequeath auxdit Rds Benedictine fathers the sum of 6000 francs to be used in purchasing annuities whose income will be taken: first, the costs of said inentaire for the ornament of which will be this dirty public library, and then used to purchase books as Superior and He who said library who will be entrusted deem expedient; provided however that they will buy books fathers, and other book Belles Lettres for the use of any kind of defendant expressly people use all kinds of people defendant expressly buying some sermonaires, Which books will adjoutés four in four years aforesaid inventory Easting my intention that the income of the said sum of 6000 francs to be used punctually increase of said library without power Estre Diverty for any other purpose as Aussy quue lesdit books and medals remain in perpetuity said sale for public use, without power Estre moved elsewhere are distracted for e whole or in part in any cause or reason whatsoever ...\\"Municipal Library of Besançon, Manuscrit 1270. So after this act was born the municipal library of Besançon, under the control of the Benedictines of St. Vincent. The question of the influence that the Mazarine library had in the legacy of Jean Baptiste Boisot is legitimate, since it has visited. Jean Baptiste Boisot is a passionate knowledge of the study, a bibliophile, as evidenced by his correspondence miss Scuderi and Paul Pellisson.Il would be possible to have more information about the legacy of Father Boisot, however the letters that could provide more information are those sent to the abbot of St. Vincent which remain lost. Three letters to Paul Pellison learn about his legacy, like that of 17 December 1690 where he states: :\\"I will send it back as soon as our fathers Abbey have had time to see and copy. It is necessary that you remain original and if you do want to point it would be better to give a public library as an individual like me and has no result.\\"Bibliothèque municipale de Besançon, Manuscrit 602 Letter of 12 January Pellison shows the evolution of his thinking: :\\"I praise with all my heart, sir, the plan that you have to leave a public library, this is one thing in the world I would have loved to do better if I had found myself in the situation that needs to it. I see with great pleasure your project when you please let me know, not to believe that I think add anything, but to enjoy myself.\\" The turning point comes with the transfer of the University of Dole to Besançon, and in the opinion of the Abbe de Saint-Vincent, who suggested he leave his library. As a letter from Paul Pelisson which dated 16 June 1691 in response to a letter from the Abbe Boisot, now lost watch: :\\"I praise with all my heart the purpose you move your library one day in the building being prepared for your university. That's all we can do better, not that the course of time often make all our precautions useless, but if there is something lasting and useful in general, are the institutions this nature, permitte denis cetera, we can not do anything there.\\" =Personal library= The first inventory of the library of the Abbot Boisot was established in 1607. It contains, in addition to books Granvelle, some of those who belonged to his father, the Chancellor of Nicolas Perrenot, and the Earl of Cantecroix. It consists of nearly 1,500 volumes in nearly 1500 volumes. This library is considered one of the largest library of the sixteenth century. Maurice Piquard wrote an article \\"The library of a statesman in the sixteenth century\\",Mixtures of history of the book and libraries offered to Mr. Frantz Calot, ... [Printed text] . - OF Argences, 1960. Library elzevirienne of the IRHT. Studies and Documents which encountered some difficulty with the poverty of the inventory of 1607 contained no dates or place of printing or author's name. It is for these reasons that the uncertainty still hangs on certain subjects. Maurice Piquard has several Greek works including 9 works of Plutarch, 6 Aristotle, Homer 5, 4 Polybius, Herodotus, Dion Cassius, 3 Thucydides, Xenophon, one of Aeschylus, Aristophanes. Absent the works of Sophocles and Euripides. With regard to Latin literature, the collection includes nine books Cicero, Virgil, Livy, Terence, 'of Ovid, and Lucretius, Plautus, Pliny the Elder, Caesar, Seneca, Horace, and Tacitus. Piquard also highlights the presence of many of the Italian renaissance writers such as Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio in rare and copies of authors Vitruvius . Machiavelli and Baldassare Castiglione are widely represented, with 5 copies of the Prince and 5 of the Courtier. Educated man, he has sixty law books, 172 history, 70 of Medicine (Ambroise Pare, Vesalius ...) as well as works of astrology, astronomy and many aspects of science and issues of the time, such as \\" De revolutionibus orbium Celestium \\"of Nicolas Copernicus, however it also lacks the works of Ptolemy, reputedly at the time. The absence of some authors of the church such as St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas and some novels such as Romance of the Rose is not trivial so we will not pay attention, and lack certain works of piety of the time is strange for a clergyman. The assumption of theft or loss is however not excluded. Its library includes manuscripts and enriched quality as the Chronicles of Froissart, from the collection of Granvelle and many bindings from quality relationships that the cardinal had linked with printers from all over Europe. The inventory that was used was that of 1607, a more comprehensive was made until 1695 under the auspices of witnesses advisors Tinseau, Monnier, Noironte Lord and Pierre-Ignace Gillebert to attend the notary Jean Colin; It lasted nearly ten months (5 January 1695 - October 1695). The inventory dénombrera 1847 numbers for books, equivalent to 2,247 volumes and 239 manuscripts. They will later be joined to form 80 large folio of State Cardinal Granvelle papers. It is then in 1732 the first catalog will be established by subject matter, so sometimes messy and imprecise.

Fic domain proteins typically use ATP as a co-factor, but in some cases GTP or UTP is used. Post-translational modification performed by Fic domains is usually NMPylation (AMPylation, GMPylation or UMPylation), however they also catalyze phosphorylation and phosphocholine transfer. This family contains a central conserved motif HPFX[D/E]GNGR in most members and it carries the invariant catalytic histidine. Fic domain was found in bacteria, eukaryotes and archaea and can be found organized in almost hundred different multi-domain assemblies.  Functions  First fic gene was discovered in the late 1980s in Escherichia coli. Mutation in this gene impaired cell division under stress conditions (cyclic AMP in growth medium at high temperature), which led to annotation as fic-1 for filamentation induced by cAMP. The product of fic-1 was later characterized as toxin from toxin-antitoxin system. Fic domain protein from the Vibrio parahaemolyticus VopS is a toxin secreted by type III secretion system. It catalyses AMPylation of Rho GTPases in eukaryotic cells and therefore induces the collapse of the actin cytoskeleton. Doc (death on curing) protein is also part of a toxin-antitoxin module Phd-Doc from prophage P1. Doc toxin uses inverted substrate and catalyses phosphorylation instead of transferring NMP moiety. Doc phosphorylates elongation factor EF-Tu and locks it in an unfavorable open conformation to bind tRNAs and therefore blocks protein translation. Doc provides stability for P1 lysogens of Escherichia coli. Bacteria carry the prophage as a stable low copy number plasmid. The frequency with which viable cells cured of prophage are produced is about 10(-5) per cell per generation. A significant part of this remarkable stability can be attributed to a plasmid-encoded toxin-antitoxin module phd- doc causes death of cells that have lost P1.

There were two gates named the Porte Saint-Antoine, both now demolished, of which the best known was that guarded by the Bastille, on the site now occupied by the start of Rue de la Bastille in the 4th arrondissement of Paris.  History  = The Faubourg = One of the oldest routes through Paris, dating to the Roman era, was that through the centre of the city heading for Meaux and Melun. This road began in Paris with what is now the Rue du Pourtour-Saint-Gervais as far as the Porte Baudoyer, the gate into the 5th-century enclosure level with the Rue des Barres and Place Baudoyer. Beyond the city walls, it was known as the Rue Saint-Antoine (including today's Rue François-Miron and Rue des Barres as far as Rue de Fourcy), since it served the Abbaye Saint-Antoine-des-Champs (on the site of today's Hôpital Saint-Antoine, in the 12th arrondissement), founded right at the start of the 13th century. When King Philip II built the Wall of Philip II Augustus, a new gate was built 450 metres beyond the former one, level with 101 Rue Saint-Antoine, just to the east of the crossroads of Rue Saint-Antoine with the Rue de Sévigné, in front of what is now the Church of Saint-Paul- Saint-Louis. This first gate was sometimes known as the \\"Porte Baudoyer\\" and was demolished in 1382. = 1356–1499 = J.-B. Lallemand. In 1356 Charles V of France ordered the building of a new wall to replace Philip II's on the right bank. This new wall had only six gates to allow access into Paris to be controlled – one of these six was the Porte Saint-Antoine, built quickly with two towers. Following Étienne Marcel's revolt (Marcel and 54 of his companions, meanwhile, were killed at the Porte Saint-Antoine while trying to get into Paris by night), the king had fled his residence at the palais de la Cité for his hôtels in the Marais. The king thus demanded the construction of a chastel to protect his residence and the Porte Saint-Antoine – completed in 1382, this chastel became the Bastille. During Charles VI of France's reign, the inhabitants of Paris got through the Porte Saint-Antoine three times to attack the hôtel Saint-Pol and during the Armagnac–Burgundian Civil War 1,500 Armagnacs got through it on 1 June 1418 before being repulsed by the Burgundians. =1500–1778= On 1 June 1540 Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor entered Paris through the Porte Saint-Antoine beside Francis I of France – the Bastille fired an 800-shot salute, the houses nearby were decorated with tapestries and banners and the court, clergy and middle class came out to welcome them. Henry II of France built a single-arch triumphal arch at Porte Saint-Antoine, with sculptures on it by Jean Goujon representing two rivers. He also took part in a tournament by the gate, near hôtel des Tournelles, on 30 June 1559 at which he was mortally wounded. In 1588 Henry I, Duke of Guise forced the disarmed Swiss Guards to leave via the Porte Saint-Antoine and it was also at that gate that the troops of the Catholic League put up their last resistance to Henry IV of France. View of the Porte Saint-Antoine in 1671 In 1610 Louis XIII of France made a ceremonial entry through the gate after his coronation in Reims. In 1648 one of the most important barricades in the popular revolt against Broussel's recall by Mazarin was sited at the Porte Saint-Antoine. Four years later, on 2 July 1652, thanks to cannon shots fired from the Bastille on the orders of the Grande Mademoiselle, it was through this gate that the Condé was able to escape the royal troops under Viscount Turenne, Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, who were pursuing him. In 1670 Nicolas- François Blondel added two arcades to the monument, which he dedicated to Louis XIV of France, in remembrance of Louis's entry through this gate on his marriage in 1660. For the ceremony, Gérard Van Opstal created three sculptures personifying France, Spain and Hymen, to be placed in niches executed by Michel Anguier. It was demolished in 1778, no longer any use as a fortification and as a blockage to road traffic.

The architect Steven Holl was first contacted about designing a centre for Knut Hamsun in 1994. He traveled to Hamarøy and made a watercolour of the centre's design that looks quite similar to the building today. Holl was inspired by the Hamarøy nature and scenery, by Norwegian building tradition with stave churches and sod roofs, and by Hamsun's literature—especially the early works Hunger (1890) and Mysteries (1892). Steven Holl has described the Knut Hamsun Centre as \\"concretizing a Hamsun character in architectonic terms\\", and he continues: \\"The concept for the museum, 'Building as a Body:Battleground of invisible Forces,' is realized from inside and out.\\"Holl, Steven. \\"Concept 1998\\" in Hamsun Holl Hamarøy, Lars Müller Publishers, 2009, p. 154.

Holl originally wanted the centre to be built close to Hamsun's childhood home in Hamsund, but local authorities moved it 5 km east, to Presteid, where Knut Hamsun spent a significant part of his childhood with his uncle.

According to MIU, the Golden Domes were the first structures built specifically for group meditation and the practice of the TM- Sidhi program. In 2001 and 2005 they received additional construction including landscaping, perimeter fencing and new entrances. Description Aerial photograph showing the Golden Domes. Each dome is 20,000–25,000 square feet (1,900–2,300 m2) in area, about 150–200 feet (46–61 m) in diameter, and about 35 feet (11 m) high and are said to dominate the MIU campus. The roofs of the domes are covered with spray polyurethane foam. The domes are mentioned in a number of travel guides and are considered \\"don't miss\\" landmarks for Fairfield tourists. The domes have been variously described by journalists as looking like: \\"a huge rotunda\\", \\"flying saucers\\", \\"extraterrestrial-looking\\", \\"gilded breasts\\", \\"Mallomar-cookie-shaped\\", \\"giant mushrooms\\", and \\"sprawling structures\\". History In the summer of 1979, during a \\"World Peace Assembly\\" in Amherst, Massachusetts, the Maharishi invited TM and TM-Sidhi practitioners to come together for group meditation in Fairfield and ordered the construction of two domes for this purpose. University president, Bevan Morris, oversaw the effort and according to MIU, the domes were the first structures built for the purpose of group practice of the Maharishi's TM-Sidhi program (capacity 3,000). Construction began in the fall of 1979 and the first dome was inaugurated in December by the Maharishi. Ravi Shankar (later known as \\"Sri Sri Ravi Shankar\\") and two other Indian pandits chanted Vedic hymns during the inaugural ceremony. The second Dome, completed in 1981, was reportedly built on the site of the campus baseball field. Each dome's usage was declared gender specific to avoid distraction by the presence of the opposite sex. According to the university's yearbook, the Maharishi named the domes, \\"The Maharishi Patanjali dome and the Bagambhrini Golden Dome of Pure Knowledge\\" in 1983. Rooftop cupola shaped like a kalasha. Each dome is topped with a kalasha. These rooftop sculptures are 7.5 ft (2.9 m) tall and 5 ft (1.5 m) wide and were cast in acrylic resin by a university professor in 1997. Surrounding areas and berms were also flattened and auspicious fencing was added around each dome in 1999. Later some aspects of the building were deemed inauspicious and western entrances were replaced with east facing entrances for one of the domes in 2001. An expanded vestibule on the east side includes a large room for coats and shoes and the performance of Yoga positions or asanas. The eastern end of one dome was squared-off, to align it with the philosophy of Maharishi Sthapatya Veda (MSV) architecture. The entry to the second dome was moved in 2005 and bathrooms were added, replacing a temporary trailer which had been used for the purpose. In accordance with the MSV architectural philosophy the domes were topped by cupolas called kalashes. In 2008 the roof of the Maharishi Patanjali dome was resurfaced and repainted.

He became a distinguished hydrographer during his career and served as Hydrographer of the Navy. Biography Evans, son of John Evans, a master in the Royal Navy, was born on 9 March 1815. He entered the navy as a second-class volunteer in 1828. After serving in and he was transferred in 1833 to , under Captain Richard Owen, and spent three years in surveying the coasts of Central America, the Demerara River, and the Bahama Banks. Evans subsequently served in the Mediterranean on board , the flagship of the Mediterranean Fleet, and then on , , , , and , passing through the different ranks of the 'master's' line, the officers then charged with the duties of navigation. In 1841 Evans was appointed master of , and for the next five years he was employed in surveying the Coral Sea, the Great Barrier Reef of Australia, and Torres Straits. Joseph Jukes, the geologist, was on board the Fly, and wrote an account of the expedition. After a short spell of duty in the Isle of Man, Evans returned, in 1847, in , under Admiral Stokes, to New Zealand, where he was engaged for four years in surveying the Middle and South Islands. During the Crimean War he served in the Baltic Sea, receiving the special thanks of Sir Charles Napier for his share in piloting the fleet through the Åland Islands. By this time Evans had become known for his scientific abilities, and in particular for his work on magnetism. He understood the need for studies of the effects of magnetic materials on ships' compasses at a period when the Navy was being revolutionised by the shift from wooden to iron construction. He had already done considerable work on this problem in the years between 1842 and 1851. In 1855 he was appointed superintendent of the compass department of the navy, and was able to devote himself entirely to the problems of the use of the magnetic compass in iron ships and armour-clads. Evans, in co-operation with Archibald Smith, accomplished the task satisfactorily. He contributed five papers, all dealing with the magnetism of ships, to the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, of which he was elected a fellow in 1862. Evans was commissioned a staff-commander in 1863, staff-captain in 1867, and full captain in 1872. In 1865 he was appointed Chief Assistant to the Hydrographer to the Admiralty, Captain George Henry Richards, while continuing to tbe head of the magnetic department. In 1874 he succeeded Richards as Hydrographer, a post he held until 1884. In this position he was responsible for the charts, pilot guides and other publications of the Admiralty. He was invested as a Companion of the Order of the Bath,Queen's Honours List, 1873 and promoted to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath.Queen'sHonours List, 1881 He was vice-president of the Royal Geographical Society from 1879 to 1881, and president of the geographical section of the British Association in 1876. After resigning the post of hydrographer, Evans was appointed one of the British delegates to the International Meridian Conference held at Washington, D.C. in 1885, to fix a prime meridian and universal day. He died at his residence, 21 Dawson Place, Pembridge Square, London, on 20 December 1885. He had married, on 12 November 1846, Elizabeth Mary, eldest daughter of Captain Charles Hall, R.N., of Plymouth. Published Work Evans' chart of the curves of equal magnetic variation, published 1859 Following the survey work in New Zealand in Acheron, and the subsequent work by Commander Byron Drury in , Richards and Evans published the 'New Zealand Pilot' in 1856. This went through a number of editions, the fourth appearing in 1875. In 1858 Evans prepared a 'Chart of Curves of Equal Magnetic Variation,’ which was published by the Admiralty. In 1860 he wrote a valuable 'Report on Compass Deviations in the Royal Navy'. This treated of the magnetic character of the various iron ships in the navy, and also of the , and was his first work to be published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. His most important work was the 'Admiralty Manual for Deviations of the Compass,’ of which Smith and himself were joint editors (1st ed. 1862, 2nd ed. 1863, 3rd ed. 1869). A simple account of the same subject was issued by Evans in 1870 as an 'Elementary Manual for Deviations of the Compass.' These have become standard textbooks, having been translated and adopted by all the great maritime nations. His published work in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society appeared between 1860–1872. Subsequently, Evans devoted much attention to terrestrial magnetism. He compiled the magnetical instructions for the observers on board in 1872, and delivered a lecture on the 'Magnetism of the Earth' to the Royal Geographical Society in 1878. In 1881 he contributed a paper to the British Association on 'Oceanic or Maritime Discovery from 1831 to 1881.'

The present building was constructed from 1627 to 1641 by the Jesuit architects Étienne Martellange and François Derand, on the orders of Louis XIII of France. It gives its name to Place Saint-Paul and its nearest Metro station, Saint-Paul. Next door to the church is the Lycée Charlemagne, also founded by the Jesuits.  History  A view of the church from the south The nave and dome over the crossing The central dome =First church= The first church on the site was dedicated around 1125 to Paul the Hermit, who had been buried in the Egyptian desert by Anthony the Great; it was in effect the cemetery chapel to the monastery of Saint-Éloi, founded by monks of saint Eloi of Noyon and Dagobert I. This monastery was on the site of what is now the parvise of the Palais de Justice. From there, bodies were carried in procession from the monastic community to the cemetery. Madame de Sévigné was baptised in this building in 1626, in the first chapel of Saint-Louis. The monastic cemetery was later forgotten, though the church retained a dedication to a saint Paul (albeit Paul of Tarsus not Paul of Thebes) up to the present day. =Construction= The first stone of the present building was laid by Louis XIII in 1627 for the Jesuits in the same street as the old chapel of St Paul. Its first name was 'église Saint-Louis de la maison professe des Jésuites', in reference to the Maison Professe des Jésuites attached to it. Its design included traditional French elements as well as others inspired by Italy. In effect, as André Chastel put it, \\"the Jesuit order, even while recommending certain aspects, was attentive to local traditions.\\" André Chastel, L'art français L'Ancien Régime 1620-1775, Paris, Flammarion, coll. « Tout l'art », 2000, p. 58. Also, it can easily be compared to the Gesu in Rome, though it is longer and wider than that church. Its plan is a compromise between the Gesu's single nave flanked by side chapels and the traditional French cruciform plan, as is to be seen in its long transepts. The tall windows in these prominent transepts and the short eastern apse allow in large amounts of light, and the dome under the crossing also recalls Italian architecture of a slightly earlier period, such as that of Carlo Maderno. In contrast, the high proportions (the dome is 55 metres high) are more comparable to French Gothic architecture. The façade is also Italian but with French Gothic verticality and Dutch high ornamentation. Its main inspiration was the 1618 façade of the église Saint-Gervais-Saint-Protais de Paris by Salomon de Brosse, which has the same design of three bays with two levels on the side bays and three levels for the central bay, highlighted by a projection and doubled columns. It uses Corinthian columns on the two lower levels and composite order columns on the rest. =17th century= The first mass was celebrated in the new building on 9 May 1641 (the feast of the Ascension) by cardinal Richelieu, with the oremuses pronounced by Bossuet. The famous Jesuit preacher Louis Bourdaloue preached some of his memorable sermons in the church, for Lent and Advent, between 1669 (the date of his first sermon) and 1693. He also preached his memorable funeral sermon for the Grand Condé in the church in 1687, whilst Bossuet and Fléchier also preached here. Jean-Jacques Olier (founder of the Prêtres de Saint-Sulpice) was baptised in the church on 20 September 1608 and Louis Bourdaloue is buried in the church's crypt. Between 1688 and 1698, Marc-Antoine Charpentier was employed by the Jesuits and was master of music in the church of Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis. Other masters of music there included André Campra and Louis Marchand. Jacques de Létin painted The Death of Saint Louis for the church, which can still be seen here. =1700 to present= When the Parlement de Paris suppressed the Jesuits in 1762, the building was reassigned to the canons of Sainte-Catherine-du-Val- des-Ecoliers. On 2 September 1792, 5 priests were killed in the church during the September Massacres, as is commemorated by a commemorative plaque. The church was also converted to the Cult of Reason and the Supreme Being during the French Revolution, before being restored to Catholicism in 1802 due to the Concordat of 1801. The white marble high altar was moved and rebuilt under Louis-Philippe I with fragments from Napoleon's tomb at Les Invalides. The church was later renamed the 'église Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis' in memory of the church of Saint-Paul, which had been demolished in 1796. On 15 February 1843, Léopoldine Hugo secretly married Charles Vacquerie in the church; her father Victor Hugo offered the church two clam-shell holy water holders to mark the occasion, still to be seen in the church. Église Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis on the 1734 plan de Turgot Delacroix painted Christ in agony on the Mount of Olives for the church, which can still be seen here to the left of the altar. The church is currently displaying a placeholder as the original is on loan to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. The church also houses La vierge del Douleur by Germain Pilon (1586). On one pillar on the right side of the nave is a nearly-erased inscription 'République française ou la mort' (French Republic or death), probably dating to the Paris Commune of 1871. The casing of the church's grand tribune organ was classified as a historic monument in 1867 and four years later (in 1871) its pipes were replaced by Martin. The whole organ was restored in 1972 by Danion-Gonzalez and now has 3 keyboards with 56 notes and a pedal board with 30 notes, along with electric transmissions and 40 pipes (of which 33 are reels). The choir organ is by Krischer and dates to the 19th century, with two keyboards of 56 notes, a pedal board of 30 notes, mechanical transmissions and 13 pipes.

At the age of eleven he was apprenticed on board one of the small trading vessels that visited his native town. His treatment was so bad that he determined to run away. He went to Aberdare, and worked in a coal-mine. From here he sent a letter to his mother, written in verse (his first attempt), apprising her of his whereabouts. When about fifteen he devoted his leisure hours to music, and attracted public attention as a singer. Shortly after this he competed successfully at a small eisteddfod, held at the chapel where he was a member, for the best poem on ‘Humility.’ This brought him into public notice, and henceforth his name was constantly in the local papers and in connection with eisteddfodau, where he won twenty prizes. All this time he worked as a common collier. His last six years were spent in constant battle first with dyspepsia, and then with consumption. He died 29 April 1865.

Situated in the Bourne Valley, Newton Tony is about north-east of its post town, Salisbury. It is the site of Wilbury House, a 17th-century mansion designed by William Benson. History The Port Way Roman road crossed the parish to the south-east. Newton Tony was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Newentone and the settlement was assessed as having an area of seven carucates (ploughlands) of land. It was held by Alfred of Marlborough. A church had been built by the 12th century. The village was the birthplace of the pioneering travel writer Celia Fiennes (1662–1741).\\"June 7th 1662. Birth of Celia Fiennes\\".

Governance Like most of Wiltshire, Newton Tony is governed locally by Wiltshire Council, a unitary authority. The parish forms part of the ward of Bulford, Allington and Figheldean. In the 2013 election, as in 2009, the ward elected one councillor: the Conservative John Smale. Newton Tony is represented in the House of Commons as part of the constituency of Salisbury. It elects one MP by the first past the post system of election. Since the 2010 general election, Salisbury has been represented in Parliament by the Conservative MP John Glen. The parish is also part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament.

A combined summer house and ice house in the grounds, from the same date, is designated Grade II*. The parish church of St Andrew was built in 1844 to a design by Thomas Henry Wyatt and David Brandon. It is a flint church, with a steeple, and has been designated a Grade II listed building. The former rectory was built for Reverend John Akins in 1778, in Flemish brick on a stone plinth. The former Wesleyan Chapel, now a private home, dates from 1877. Railways In 1857 the London and South Western Railway company opened a line from Andover to Milford station at Salisbury, which crosses the parish south-east of Newton Tony village, parallel to the Port Way. The railway remains in use as part of the West of England Main Line; the nearest station is Grateley, some east of Newton Tony village. The Amesbury and Military Camp Light Railway, opened in 1902, connected with the main line near Newton Tony. It carried largely military goods and passengers to Amesbury, extending later to Bulford, Larkhill and Rollestone. The line closed to passengers in 1952 and to goods in 1963, after which the track was dismantled. =Newton Tony railway station= The station was on the 1902 line, west of the village and to the south of the Allington road, and was the only intermediate station on the military line to .

In 1783 he was elected both for Killybegs and Tulsk in Roscommon, and preferred to sit for the latter borough; in 1784 and 1790 he was re-elected for Tulsk, and in 1798 he was chosen to represent Kildare Borough in the last Irish Parliament. His eloquence soon made him as great a reputation in the Irish parliament as at the Irish bar, and he was recognised as one of the leading orators in the days of Grattan and Flood. Though an eloquent speaker, Fitzgerald was not much of a statesman. He, however, supported all the motions of the radical parties, and in 1782 he made his most famous speech in proposing a certain measure of Catholic relief. In that year he married Catherine, younger daughter of the Rev. Henry Vesey, who was grandson of John Vesey, Archbishop of Tuam (ancestor of the Viscounts de Vesci), and cousin of Lord Glentworth. Promotions and last offices Fitzgerald never sought political office, but he eagerly accepted professional appointments, which helped him at the bar. He thus became in rapid succession Third Serjeant of Ireland in 1779, Second Serjeant in 1784, and Prime Serjeant in 1787. In all the debates which preceded the final abolition of the independent Irish parliament, Fitzgerald distinguished himself. He opposed the project of the Union with all his might, and he was certainly disadvantaged in his cause, for in 1799 he was dismissed from his post of Prime Serjeant to make way for St George Daly, who had been converted to the Unionist policy. The Irish bar insisted on showing their respect for him, and continued to give him the precedence in court over the Attorney- General and Solicitor-General which he had held as Prime Serjeant. When the Union Acts were carried, Fitzgerald accepted it, and he sat in Parliament for Ennis from 1802 to February 1808, when he resigned the seat to his son, William Vesey Fitzgerald. He, however, was re-elected in 1812, but again resigned in January 1813, when he finally retired from politics. James Fitzgerald died at Booterstown, near Dublin, on 20 January 1835, aged 93; the baroness had predeceased him on 3 January 1832. His youngest son, Henry Vesey- Fitzgerald, was Dean of Emly (1818–26), and Dean of Kilmore from 1826 till his death, on 30 March 1860. He succeeded his eldest brother as third Lord Fitzgerald and Vesey in 1843.

The Hôtel des Tournelles in the 14th century The hôtel des Tournelles () is a now-demolished collection of buildings in Paris built from the 14th century onwards north of place des Vosges. It was named after its many 'tournelles' or little towers.J-A Dulaure, Histoire de Paris, Gabriel Roux, Paris, 1853, p. 189Le Magasin Pittoresque, 1851, p.96 It was owned by the kings of France for a long period of time, though they did not often live there. Henry II of France died there in 1559 of wounds he received in a joust. After his death, his widow Catherine de Médici abandoned the building, by then quite derelict and old-fashioned. It was turned into a gunpowder magazine, then sold to finance the construction of the Tuileries, designed and developed to suit the queen's Italian style. Site and description The district around the Hôtel des Tournelles in 1550 At the beginning of the 15th century, the district around the hôtel formed a huge rectangle, marked out by the rue Saint-Antoine, rue des Tournelles, rue de Turenne and rue Saint-Gilles, a rectangle broken from within by the park of the royal estate. During the English occupation of Paris (1420-1436), John of Lancaster, Duke of Bedford, extended the district by purchasing eight and a half acres from the nuns of Sainte-Catherine for 200 livres 16 sous, thus extending the property to the fortified wall of Paris, which was then situated on what is now known as the boulevard Richard Lenoir. This extension was annulled in 1437 after the English left. The main entrance to the hôtel was at the bottom of a cul-de-sac currently known as . The hôtel was said to be able to accommodate 6,000 people. Tournelle gate to St. Nicolas des Champs Like the Hôtel Saint-Pol, the hôtel des Tournelles was a collection of buildings spread over an estate of more than , including twenty chapels, several pleasure grounds, ovens and twelve galleries including the Duke of Bedford's famous galerie des courges (so-called due to the painted green squash or courges on its walls. Under its tiled roof the Duke's arms, devices and heraldry were displayed). It also included a maze called 'Dedalus', two parks planted with trees, six kitchen gardens and a ploughed field. The council chamber was notable for the magnificence of its decoration. Three other rooms bore the names salle des Écossais (room of the Scots), salle de brique (brick room) and salle pavée (paved room). One part of the hôtel des Tournelles, named Logis du Roi, had an entrance decorated with the French coat of arms, painted by Jean de Boulogne, known as Jean de Paris. In 1464, Louis XI built a gallery there which connected this house to the Hôtel-Neuf of Madame d'Étampes, across the rue Saint-Antoine. He also built an observatory for his doctor, Jacques Coitier. Menageries based on those at the hôtel Saint-Paul were later added to house some of the animals previously held at the hôtel Saint-Paul. New specimens were imported from Africa, such as lions, giving the enclosures the name of hôtel des lions du Roi. No traces remain of the hôtel besides a copy of one of its gates, which forms the south gate of the église Saint-Nicolas- des-Champs, and some cellars buried below buildings in the district. History Charles VI At the beginning of the 14th century, the building that became the Hôtel des Tournelles was merely a house facing the hôtel Saint-Pol. Pierre d'Orgemont, seigneur de Chantilly and chancellor of France and the Dauphiné under Charles VI, or perhaps his eldest son Pierre, rebuilt it in 1388. It was bequeathed to the younger Pierre in 1387. This house may have formerly been the property of Jean d'Orgemont, the presumed father of the elder Pierre.Le journal des Sçavans, 1913, pp. 186–188 On 19 March 1387 Pierre d'Orgemont divided his lands among his ten children, leaving the maison des Tournelles to his eldest son Pierre, bishop of Paris, who was already living there. After his father's death in 1389, the bishop sold the house on 16 May 1402 for 140,000 gold écus, to the duc de Berry, brother of Charles V. In 1404 the duc de Berry gave it to his nephew Louis, the duc d’Orléans and the younger brother of Charles VI, in exchange for the hôtel de Gixé on rue de Jouy. The duc d’Orléans was assassinated on 23 November 1407 and the hôtel passed to his heirs, becoming the property of Charles VI, who lived there from 1417 onwards. The house took the name Maison royale des Tournelles. Louis XII Thanks to the Treaty of Troyes, the English entered Paris on 18 November 1420. After Charles VI's death on 22 October 1422 in Paris, the hôtel was seized and became the primary residence of John of Lancaster, the Duke of Bedford, younger brother of Henry V of England and regent for the kingdom of France until his nephew Henry VI came of age. In 1436, after the English left Paris, Charles VII gave the hôtel to his Orléans cousins. When John died in 1467, the property passed to his widow, Marguerite, Duchess of Rohan. In 1486 Marguerite left the buildings to her son Charles of Orléans, father of Francis I of France. It thus became a royal residence once again. In 1563 it was still called the \\"hôtel des Tournelles et d'Angoulème\\". It thus passed to John of Orléans, count of Angoulême, and was for a time called the hôtel d’Angoulême (not to be confused with the later Hôtel d'Angoulême Lamoignon). Different kings of this era stayed for short or long periods at the hôtel – Louis XI made a few brief stays there: Fleeing his coronation festivities, the new king took refuge there on Tuesday 1 September 1461 after dinnerPaul Murray Kendall, Louis XI, Arthème Fayard, 1974, p. 110 but left for Tours by 25 September. Nor did Louis' successors Charles VIII of France and Louis XII of France stay there much, though the latter did die there on 1 January 1515. Francis I of France did not live there, preferring the château de Fontainebleau, the Louvre and the castles on the River Loire. The Hôtel des Tournelles was used as a residence by his mother Louise of Savoy then by his mistress Anne de Pisseleu, a tradition repeated by Henry II of France when he made it the residence of Diane de Poitiers. In 1524 the magician Cornélius Agrippa lived there under the name Agrippa de Nettesheim, as doctor and astrologer to Louise de Savoie, to whom he made dead and living people appear. Henry II on his deathbed at the hôtel des Tournelles The hôtel saw several lavish and unusual festivals, such as the \\"danse macabre\\" on 23 August 1451 before Charles, Duke of Orléans. Henry II celebrated his coronation there in 1547 and then the signing of the Treaties of Cateau-Cambrésis in 1559. The last festival held there was also in 1559, to mark the double marriage of Élisabeth de France to Philip II of Spain and of the king's sister Marguerite de France to the duke of Savoy. On this occasion, a tournament was organised on 29 June on rue Saint-Antoine, the widest street in Paris at the time and thus known as the La Grant rue St Anthoine, with the same dimensions as in the present day. During a joust in front of the hôtel de Sully (level with what is now number 62), Henry II was seriously wounded by an accidental lance thrust by Gabriel de Lorges, count of Montgomery, captain of the king's Scottish guard. Moved to the hôtel des Tournelles, the king died there on 10 July 1559 in terrible agony, despite attempts to save him by both the famous surgeon Ambroise Paré and the surgeon to the king of Spain, Andreas Vesalius. Catherine de Médici, an Italian princess who had grown up in Roman palaces, disliked the Hôtel des Tournelles's medieval appearance and took Henry's death as a pretext to sell it off. Gaining total power as regent to her young sons, the heirs of Henry, she turned the property into an arsenal, then had it closed and demolished. On 28 January 1563, in the name of her son Charles IX of France, she issued letters patent ordering the demolition.Archives du royaume, section domaniale, série 9, N°1234 This took place in stages and financed her major works on the more modern royal residences in Paris, particularly on the Madrid and the Tuileries. Some of the materials from the old hôtel were reused in the construction of the palace. The stables were reused to create the important Marché aux chevaux, horse market, where two thousand horses were sold every Saturday. Certain parcels of land from the Hôtel's estate were sold off, though a large estate remained and was used in military training. In January 1589 the estate was used to exercise the mercenaries charged with defending Paris against Henry IV of France. It also became a traditional site for bloody duels – on 27 April 1578, at 5 am, three favourites of Henry III of France beat three favourites of the duke of Guise in a duel there, with all six men ending up killed or seriously wounded. Henry IV In August 1603, Henry IV tried to re-use part of the Hôtel's buildings to create a silk, gold and silver factory, bringing in 200 Italian artisans for this purpose, but the attempt failed. Finally, on 4 March 1604, he issued an edict instructing his minister Sully to measure out the site. He donated a parcel of 6,000 toises (yards) to his main noblemen, who built pavilions there, on the condition that they stuck to the layout, materials and main dimensions laid down by the architects Androuet du Cerceau and Claude Chastillon. On 29 March 1605 Henry wrote to Sully: Thus the place Royale, later known as the place des Vosges, was born.

Holmes is a right-handed batsman who bowls right-arm off break. He was born at Tenterden, Kent, and educated at Tonbridge School, where he was a music scholar. Holmes first came to the public eye in 2009. At this time he was playing for the Kent Second XI, but during the 2009 World Twenty20 he bowled to the New Zealand team during their practice sessions. His bowling impressed then New Zealand coach Andy Moles and then captain Daniel Vettori, who likened his bowling to that of Muttiah Muralitharan. On the back of this he was flown out to Sri Lanka for New Zealands 2009 tour to bowl at the New Zealand players, as well as working with New Zealands then spin consultant, Saqlain Mushtaq. However, it wouldn't be until 2011 while studying for his degree at Loughborough University, that he made his first-class debut for Loughborough MCCU, taking 3-46 on debut against Northamptonshire and making a further appearance against Leicestershire. Signed by Warwickshire for the 2011 season, he made his first- class debut for the county against Durham MCCU, in the process taking a wicket with his first ball. Holmes made a further first-class appearance for the county against Lancashire in the County Championship. His List A debut came against Leicestershire in the Clydesdale Bank 40 taking 2-47 from 8 overs in a narrow victory by 9 runs. Holmes made two further List A appearances for Warwickshire in 2011, against Scotland and Northamptonshire, both in the Clydesdale Bank 40. However, in June 2011 he was twice reported by umpires for a suspected illegal bowling action, with particular concern surrounding his doosra delivery. On 8 July, the England and Wales Cricket Board suspended Holmes from bowling following an independent analysis of his bowling action, deeming it to be illegal. He was released by Warwickshire at the end of the 2011 season. Following a period of remedial work on his bowling action, it was deemed that his standard delivery was legal, but his doosra was not. Following these findings, Holmes' suspension was lifted, but he was warned against bowling his doosra in competitive county cricket. He took a year out of his studies at Loughborough University in 2012 to concentrate on resurrecting his county career, travelling to the Global Cricket School in Pune, India, to work on his bowling action. Soon after, however, Holmes adjourned his time in cricket to pursue a career as a practising barrister. He was called to the Bar by Lincoln's Inn in 2015.

The Willamette River flows the entire length of the valley, and it is surrounded by mountains on three sides – the Cascade Range to the east, the Oregon Coast Range to the west, and the Calapooya Mountains to the south. The valley is synonymous with the cultural and political heart of Oregon, and is home to approximately 70 percent of its populationLoy, et al., p. 35 including the six largest cities in the state: Portland, Eugene, Salem, Gresham, Hillsboro and Beaverton. https://archive.vn/20200213183832/https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/PEP/2018/PEPANNRES/0400000US41.16200 The valley's numerous waterways, particularly the Willamette River, are vital to the economy of Oregon, as they continuously deposit highly fertile alluvial soils across its broad, flat plain. A massively productive agricultural area, the valley was widely publicized in the 1820s as a \\"promised land of flowing milk and honey\\". Throughout the 19th century it was the destination of choice for the oxen-drawn wagon trains of emigrants who made the perilous journey along the Oregon Trail. Today the valley is often considered synonymous with \\"Oregon Wine Country\\", as it contains more than of vineyards and 500+ wineries. Geology Much of the Willamette's fertility is derived from a series of massive ice-age floods that came from Lake Missoula in Montana and scoured across Eastern Washington, sweeping its topsoil down the Columbia River Gorge. When floodwaters met log- and ice-jams at Kalama in southwest Washington, the water caused a backup that filled the entire Willamette Valley to a depth of above current sea level.Cataclysms on the Columbia, by John Elliott Allen and Marjorie Burns with Sam C. Sargent, 1986. Pages 175–189. Some geologists suggest that the Willamette Valley flooded in this manner multiple times during the last ice age.Geology of Oregon, by Elizabeth L. Orr, William N. Orr and Ewart M. Baldwin, 1964. Pages 211–214. If floodwaters of that magnitude covered Portland (elevation ) in 2010, only the tops of the West Hills, Mount Tabor, Rocky Butte, Kelley Butte and Mount Scott would be visible, as would only some of the city's tallest skyscrapers. Elevations for other cities in the valley are Newberg, ; Oregon City, ; McMinnville, ; Salem, ; Corvallis, ; and Eugene, . The lake gradually drained away, leaving layered sedimentary soils on the valley floor to a height of about above current sea level throughout the Tualatin, Yamhill and Willamette valleys. Geologists have come to refer to the resulting lake as Lake Allison, named for Oregon State University geologist Ira S. Allison, who first described Willamette Silt soil in 1953 and noted its similarity to soils on the floor of former Lake Lewis in Eastern Washington. Allison is also known for his work in the 1930s documenting the hundreds of non-native boulders (called erratics) washed down by the floods, rafted on icebergs and deposited on the valley bottom and in a ring around the lower hills surrounding the Willamette Valley. One of the most prominent of these is the Bellevue Erratic, just off Oregon Route 18 west of McMinnville. It is also believed that the Willamette Meteorite was rafted by flood and ice to the location near West Linn where it was found in 1902. Geography The valley may be loosely defined as the broad plain of the Willamette, bounded on the west by the Oregon Coast Range and on the east by the Cascade Range. It is bounded on the south by the Calapooya Mountains, which separate the headwaters of the Willamette from the Umpqua River valley about south of Hidden Valley. Interstate 5 runs the length of the valley, linking its major communities. Because of differing cultural and political interests, the Portland metropolitan area and Tualatin River valley are often not included in the local use of the term. Additionally, the east slopes of the Coast Ranges and the west slopes of the Cascade Range from Oakridge to Detroit Lake can be considered part of the Willamette Valley in a cultural sense, despite being mountainous areas. Cities in the valley include, from south to north, Cottage Grove, Eugene, Corvallis, Albany, Dallas, Salem, Keizer, McMinnville, and Hillsboro. Parts of the following counties, from south to north, lie within the valley: Douglas, Lane, Linn, Benton, Polk, Marion, Yamhill, and Washington. Sometimes the area around Albany and Corvallis and surrounding Benton and Linn counties is referred to locally as the Mid-Valley. Marion, Polk, and other counties are sometimes included in the definition of the Mid-Valley. Climate Light fog in the southern valley The climate of the Willamette Valley is a mix of Mediterranean (Köppen Csb) and oceanic (Köppen Cfb) influences. The Köppen climate classification system considers it Mediterranean, but compared to a true Mediterranean climate it is cooler and moister, with a longer rainy season. The main climatic features are moderate temperatures and frequent cloudiness and rains, except in summer when the northward expansion of the North Pacific High creates generally sunny and warm weather. Winters are consistently wet and cloudy, and often foggy, but quite mild. Although night frosts are common, the temperature almost always rises above the freezing point in the daytime. Snow occurs on occasion, but accumulations are normally light, and in some winters no snow whatsoever falls. Very cold temperatures are atypical; the temperature very rarely falls below , and readings of or lower occur only about once every 25 years. Summers are characterized by warm, sunny afternoons with little or no humidity, and cool evenings. Sometimes, heat waves can occur, with temperatures rising above and occasionally even reaching , but the nights usually bring relief. Precipitation varies considerably across the valley and is closely correlated with elevation. Annual totals range from at the lowest elevations to more than in the foothills. Eugene, at the southern end of the valley, is above sea level and receives 46 inches per year. Conversely, at the northern end of the valley, Portland is above sea level and receives only 36 inches per year. Most rainfall occurs from October to May, and it tends to be heaviest between November and January, when disturbances coming from the Pacific Ocean are at their most intense. Growing seasons are long, averaging 150 to 180 days per year in the lowlands to about 110 to 130 days at elevations above . Severe storms of any kind are rare, although snow and ice storms can sometimes occur when surface low pressure systems move south along the coast, inducing offshore flow which advects cold air from the Columbia Basin westward through the Columbia River Gorge, filling the valley to the north of the surface low track. Weather systems sometimes bring high winds to the northern region of the valley. Average cloud cover can exceed 70 percent in winter but drops to less than 15 percent in summer. Tornadoes are rare, but do happen a few times a year with minimal damage. Agriculture A field of Dahlias near Canby The agricultural richness of the valley is partly due to the Missoula Floods that inundated the valley approximately 40 times between 15,000 and 13,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age. The floods were caused by the periodic rupturing of the ice dam of Glacial Lake Missoula, the waters of which swept down the Columbia River and flooded the Willamette Valley as far south as Eugene. The floodwaters carried rich volcanic and glacial soil from Eastern Washington, which was deposited across the valley floor when the waters subsided. The soil in the Willamette Valley is about deep in some areas. Fall grape vines in a Willamette Valley vineyard In the cool moist climate of the Willamette valley, over 170 different crop and livestock items are produced, including grass and legume seeds, tree fruits and nuts, wine grapes, berries, vegetables, nursery, Christmas trees, and field crops such as wheat, oats, mint and hops, hay, livestock and poultry and miscellaneous field crops. The valley also produces most of the cool-season forage and turf grass, Christmas trees, and hazelnuts sold in North America. It is also noted for its hops, which are widely used in craft beer and microbreweries throughout the U.S. In recent decades, the valley has also become a major wine producer, with multiple American Viticultural Areas of its own. With a cooler climate than California, the gently rolling hills surrounding the Willamette are home to some of the best (and most expensive) Pinot noir in the world, as well as a high-quality Pinot gris. Although this distinction is not officially recognized, many wine connoisseurs further divide the Willamette Valley into northern and southern regions, the dividing line being the approximate latitude of Salem (approximately 45° north latitude). Not all portions of the Willamette Valley are suitable for vineyards, however, and the largest concentration of wineries is found west of the Willamette River, on the leeward slopes of the Coast Range, or among the numerous river and stream valleys created by Willamette River tributaries. By far, the largest concentration of wineries is in Yamhill County. Harvesting hops near Independence, Oregon, Grass farmers have been burning fields, as part of their production, since the 1940s. The smoke is often irritating to residents; in 1988 it caused a 23-car pileup on I-5. Over the years, several pieces of legislation have limited the amount of burning permitted. With the passage of a bill championed by legislator Paul Holvey in the 2009 session, burning has been banned since the summer of 2010, with the exception of an area of about with steep terrain and certain species. (At its peak in the 1980s, about were burned each year.) The Marionberry, a cross between Chehalem and Olallie blackberries, was bred at Oregon State University as part of a berry- developing partnership with the U.S. Department of Agriculture that dates back to the early 1900s. It's named for Marion County in the Willamette Valley, where most of the field trials took place (not for former D.C. Mayor Marion Barry). When the berry was introduced in the 1950s, it was widely hailed as the most delicious blackberry commercial cultivar around. Even today, people rave over its tart-yet-sweet flavor — think of a cross between raspberries and blackberries. (Though there is some raspberry in its DNA, the red fruits are more like a genetic great-great grandparent to the marionberry.) Ecology The Willamette River in the northern section of the valley The Willamette Valley is prone to periodic floods. Notable floods include the Great Flood of 1862, events in 1899, the Christmas flood of 1964, the Willamette Valley Flood of 1996, and the Willamette Flood of 2019. Part of its floodplain is a National Natural Landmark called the Willamette Floodplain. Historically, the Willamette Valley forests were mostly an oak savanna—tall grasslands with scattered Garry oaks and groves of coast Douglas-fir. The river floodplains contained extensive wetlands, stands of willow, alder, and cottonwood, and gallery forests. This landscape was maintained by the Native American inhabitants of the valley who set frequent fires that encouraged the open grasslands and killed young trees. The American settlers of the region, since the 19th century, suppressed fires and converted much of the valley to agriculture, which has caused much of the former grassland and savanna to revert to closed-canopy forest. Less than one-tenth of one percent of the original savanna vegetation remains. The remaining enclaves include a section of Garry oak savanna preserved at Mount Pisgah Arboretum in Eugene. North Pacific Oak Woodland is a major forest alliance, extending through the Willamette Valley and southward to the Klamath Range of Northern California.C.Michael Hogan (2008) Quercus Kelloggii, Globaltwitcher.com, ed. N. Stromberg Many of the soils are well-drained mesic. Human history Human habitation in the Willamette Valley is estimated to have begun between 6,000 and 10,000 years ago. Until recently, the valley was largely inhabited by bands of the Kalapuya tribe of Native Americans. Molala and Chinook peoples also have inhabited portions of the Willamette Valley since time immemorial. Sixteen thousand Kalapuyans are estimated to have populated the valley as recently as the early 19th century. As many as 90% of the Kalapuya may have died as a result of an epidemic of \\"fever and ague\\" that hit the area between 1830 and 1833. Salmon, deer and camas bulbs have provided primary food sources for the valley's first residents who used fire to encourage persistence of oak savanna. Oak trees have supplied another staple in the form of acorns which are leached, cooked and eaten. Kalapuya, Chinook and Molala peoples of the Willamette Valley currently are included among the confederated tribes that make up the Grand Ronde and Siletz Nations. Pioneer cabin at Champoeg After reports of the Lewis and Clark Expedition were published in about 1807, a small and steadily increasing stream of isolated pioneer groups began settling the valley and improving routes from the east set up by fur traders and mountain men. From the 1841 Oregon Trail opening, when the effort of many years finally widened the fur traders' mule trails into an improved rough road just capable of carrying the width of a wagon, settlers charged into the region along the new trail, creating new settlements centered about Oregon City as the early capital, even before ownership of the region was settled. So many people came that the valley led the way to achieving statehood less than 16 years after it was claimed by the United States in 1846. A small part of the Willamette Valley ecoregion is in southwestern Washington around the city of Vancouver, which was once the site of an early colonial-era settlementFort Vancouver. The Willamette Valleyserved with its sawmills, lush productive farms, handy river transport network, and nearby timber and mineral resourcesdeveloped naturally as a cultural and major commercial hub, as the Oregon Country became the Oregon Territory. The Hudson's Bay Company controlled the fur trade in the valley and the rest of Oregon Country in the 1820s and 1830s from its Columbia District headquarters at Fort Vancouver. Joint U.S.–British occupancy, in effect since the Treaty of 1818, ended in 1846 with the Oregon Treaty. The Willamette Valley was connected to California's Central Valley by the Siskiyou Trail. The first European settlements in the valley were at Oregon City and Champoeg. The first institution of higher learning on the West Coast, today's Willamette University, was founded in the valley at Salem by Jason Lee, one of the many Oregon missionaries who settled in the valley.

San Martino Chapel (Italian: Cappella di san Martino) is a chapel in the Lower Basilica of San Francesco in Assisi, Umbria, central Italy. Commissioned and funded by Cardinal Gentile Portino da Montefiore, it features a cycle of frescoes by Simone Martini (1313–1318), portraying the life of Saint Martin of Tours in 4th-century France. The frescoes are neither dated nor signed, but art historians tend to agree in identifying Martini as their author, based on stylistic and historical reasons. History Gentile Portino da Montefiore was the Cardinal of the Basilica of Santi Silvestro e Martino ai Monti in Rome. A document dating to March 1312 testifies to the funding by the Cardinal of 600 golden florins for the construction and fresco decoration of a chapel in the Lower Basilica of San Francesco in Assisi. According to recent hypotheses, the unnamed sculptor-architect who built and decorated this chapel was also responsible for creating the monumental tomb of Gentile Portino's parents in Montefiore dell'Aso (Ascoli Piceno).Palozzi, L. (2013). Talenti provinciali: Il cardinale francescano Gentile Partino da Montefiore e un’aggiunta alla scultura umbra del Trecento, in Civiltà urbana e committenze artistiche al tempo del Maestro di Offida (secoli XIV–XV), ed. S. Maddalo et al. Rome: Istituto Storico Italiano per il Medioevo: 243–266. In the spring of the same year, the Cardinal is known to have been in Siena, while transferring the papal treasure to Avignon. Here he likely made an agreement with Simone Martini to paint the chapel. In the following October, the cardinal died at Lucca, without arriving in Avignon. Martini worked in the chapel in at least three phases. He started the works in 1312–1313, leaving his work on the unfinished Maestà of the Palazzo Pubblico of Siena. In this first period, he designed the stained glass and perhaps began the frescoes. He returned to Siena around 1314 to finish the Maestà. He was back to Assisi in June 1315, starting the second decoration phase. In 1317 he was called to Naples by King Robert I of Anjou, but returned to Umbria soon to complete (and, in some cases, rework) the saints under the entrance arch. The work was finished around 1318. Description The side chapels show ten frescoes on the life of St. Martin, bishop of Tours. The scenes include: *St. Martin Sharing the Mantle with a Beggar *Apparition of Christ and Angels in St. Martin's Dream *Investiture of St. Martin as Knight *Renounce of St. Martin to the Weapons *Visit to the Emperor with Burning Throne *Resurrection of a Youth *Miraculous Mass *The Dream of St. Ambrose *Death of St. Martin *Funerals of St. Martin Above the entrance arch is the dedication from Cardinal da Montefiore to St. Martin, while the windows are decorated with busts of Saint Knights (left), Saint Bishops or Popes (center), and Saint Hermits or Founders of Religious Orders (right). The eight saints under the entrance arch are St. Mary Magdalene and St. Catherine of Alexandria (lower right), St. Anthony of Padua and St. Francis (upper right), St. Clare and St. Elizabeth of Hungary (lower left), St. Louis of France and St. Louis of Toulouse (upper left). The three latter saints replaced, respectively, the previous St. Ursula, St. Nicholas of Bari and St. Antony of Padua, after Martini had returned from the Kingdom of Naples, as a homage to the family saints of the ruling Capetian House of Anjou.

The Llanelli riots of 1911 were a series of events precipitated by the National Railway Strike of 1911. Mass picketing action at Llanelli railway station was brutally suppressed by the police, resulting in the deaths of two men, shot dead by troops of the Worcestershire Regiment. Rioting followed and magistrates' homes were attacked and railway trucks were set on fire, resulting in an explosion which killed a further four people. The incident was highly politically sensitive, as the Great Western Railway through Carmarthenshire, southwestern Wales, was the main route between England and the troubles in Ireland. The Riots occurred during a period of great industrial unrest, and involved prominent figures on the international scene such as Lloyd George, Winston Churchill, King George V, and Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany. Strike and mass picket The two day industrial action took place on Friday 18 and Saturday 19 August 1911. It was part of the first national railway strike. A joint committee of trade unions was created to co-ordinate industrial action in the town, chaired by Richard Squance.Robert Griffiths, \\"1911 When the State fired on civilians\\", Socialist History Society It organised a mass picket in Llanelli due to the ease with which strikers could blockade the Great Western Railway at Llanelli railway station.The strike itself lasted only two days; it started on Thursday evening, and by Saturday evening a negotiated settlement had been reached. However, by this time a series of clashes with strikers had led to the deployment of a detachment from the Worcestershire Regiment. The involvement of the army was approved by the then Home Secretary, Winston Churchill. Shootings On 19 August, during the negotiations, a train containing strikebreaking workers was held up. The commanding officer of the troops, Major Brownlow Stuart, ordered his men to use bayonets to disperse the crowd. The train passed slowly, but was pursued by strikers who boarded it and put out the engine fire, immobilising it. Troops followed, but found themselves boxed in a cutting, as miners approached, some throwing stones. Stuart asked the local Justice of the Peace to read the strikers the Riot Act, which he apparently mumbled reluctantly. Stuart then ordered his men to fire shots towards the crowd. Two young men were shot dead. One was a 21-year-old tinplate worker named John 'Jac' John, who \\"had joined the picket line to support his less fortunate townsmen.\\" The other was a 19-year-old youth named Leonard Worsell, who was not involved in the conflict, but had just come out into his back garden when he heard the commotion. In his report Major Stuart claimed his soldiers were firing warning shots, and were unaware of the men when they did so, but other witnesses claim they were deliberately targeted. Riot The troops action sparked not only the strikers, but also other residents of Llanelli into a day of widespread disorder and rioting. One man was killed when he attempted to use dynamite to open an armoured freight carriage, unaware that the cargo was munitions, resulting in a massive explosion. On the following day three more people died from injuries sustained in the blast. Local historian John Edwards believes a conspiracy between Liberals and the chapels promoted shame though his aunt referred to the Worcesters as \\"the murderers\\". As such the riots were rarely spoken of in the town, such that most of its later residents were unaware of one of the more significant events in its history.

Originally placed at the high altar of the church of Santa Caterina in Pisa, it is now housed in the Museo Nazionale di San Matteo of the same city. The work is signed SYMON DE SENIS ME PINXIT in the central panel with the Madonna and Child. According to the original convent's annals, the polyptych was placed at the altar in 1320. It was thus completed by that year, having been likely begun in 1319. Description The polyptych is Martini's largest work, and includes numerous sub-panels. Aside from the seven main ones, there are 15 predella figures, an upper row with other 14 figures and seven cusps with other characters. There is a total of 44 figures. The central panel depicts the Madonna with Child; the remaining six main panels are, from left to right, St. Dominic, St. John the Evangelist, St. Mary Magdalene, St. Catherine of Alexandria, St. John the Baptist and St. Peter of Verona. All these figures are enclosed within three foiled cusped arches. Above the Madonna are the two archangels Gabriel and Michael and, above them, the Blessing Christ.

On board were two pilots, two air hostesses and twenty-two passengers. The aircraft climbed to an altitude of for the 189-minute flight. At 11:34 am the pilot advised that the aircraft was 30 nautical miles (56 km) short of its destination and passing altitude on descent to Port Hedland airport. No further radio transmission was received from the aircraft. Four seconds after completion of this transmission half of the right wing separated from the aircraft. Twenty-six seconds later the aircraft fuselage struck the ground.Accident Investigation Report, page 8 As the aircraft was falling two people are known to have observed it from distances of and but because of intervening high terrain neither saw it strike the ground. When the crew of the aircraft failed to respond to further radio calls a Cessna 337 aircraft was despatched from Port Hedland airport at 12:12 pm to investigate. Eleven minutes later the pilot of the Cessna reported sighting the burning wreckage. A ground party from Port Hedland arrived at the accident site an hour later and confirmed that none of the occupants had survived the impact.  Wreckage  The aircraft crashed on Indee Station on level rocky ground vegetated with spinifex grass and some stunted trees. Wreckage was spread over an area about long and wide. Accident investigators immediately observed that half of the right wing, its outer engine and propeller were close together about from the main wreckage. The half-wing had been driven into the rocky ground by the impact but it was clear that the wing's main spar had fractured in flight causing immediate separation of the half-wing from the rest of the aircraft.  Investigation  Detailed investigation of the two fracture surfaces showed that metal fatigue had caused cracks to grow across the lower boom (or lower flange) of the right wing's main spar until they affected approximately 85% of the cross-sectional area. With so much of the lower boom affected the wing could no longer support the weight of the aircraft, the lower boom suddenly broke in two and the outer half of the right wing separated from the inner half.Accident Investigation Report, page 11 The mandatory retirement life of the lower boom in the inner wing was 11,400 flights. A pair of new inner lower booms had been installed in VH-RMQ in 1964 and had been in service for only 8,090 flights. The investigation concentrated on determining why the inner lower boom had failed at 70% of its retirement life.Accident Investigation Report, page 26Accident Investigation Report, page 24 The fatal fatigue crack in the inner lower boom had initiated at a bolt hole at Station 143, the rearmost of five bolt holes for attachment of the inner engine nacelle to the lower boom. These holes were ⅞ inch (2.22 cm) diameter and were anodised to resist wear and corrosion. A cadmium-plated steel bush of length 1 ⅝ inch (4.13 cm), chamfered at one end, was pressed into each hole. Each bush was an interference fit in the hole to improve fatigue resistance and substantially increase the retirement life of the inner lower boom.Accident Investigation Report, page 19Accident Investigation Report, page 20 The investigation determined that some years before the accident, the bush at Station 143 had been pushed upwards so the chamfer and 0.055-inch (1.40 mm) of the parallel-sided portion protruded beyond the upper surface of the boom. The exposed end of the bush was then struck with a conical tool applied to the bore. This action slightly flared the exposed end and left the external diameter 0.0038 inch (0.097 mm) oversize.Accident Investigation Report, page 13 The bush was then pushed upwards out of the hole and re-inserted from the lower surface. As the bush was being re-inserted its flared end broached the anodised material and a small amount of aluminium from the wall of the hole. This broaching action scored the wall of the hole and left its diameter slightly oversize so the bush was not an interference fit anywhere except at its flared end. Scoring of the wall of the hole and the absence of an interference fit left the inner lower boom vulnerable to developing fatigue cracks at Station 143.Accident Investigation Report, page 25Accident Investigation Report, page 16 Despite exhaustive investigation it was not possible to determine when, why, or by whom, the bush at Station 143 had been flared with a conical tool, removed and then re-inserted in the bolt hole. Investigators could not imagine circumstances in which a responsible tradesman would take these actions.Accident Investigation Report, pages 24, 25 Approximately 5000 flights after new inner lower booms were installed in 1964, numerous fatigue cracks began to develop in both the forward and rear edges of the hole.Accident Investigation Report, page 27 These cracks eventually joined to form a single crack growing forwards from the forward edge of the hole, and a single crack growing rearwards from the rear edge of the hole. These two cracks grew to affect 85% of the cross-sectional area of the inner lower boom at Station 143.Accident Investigation Report, page 23 Seven weeks after the accident the Minister for Civil Aviation, Reg Swartz, announced that the accident had been caused by metal fatigue and he did not consider it necessary to appoint a court to inquire into the accident.\\"No inquiry into air crash\\" The Canberra Times – 22 February 1969, p.3 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 26 April 2014 This position was challenged by the opposition spokesman for aviation, Charlie Jones.\\"Inquiry sought on air crash\\" The Canberra Times – 19 March 1969, p.11 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 26 April 2014 British Aircraft Corporation carried out multiple tests in which a bush was slightly flared with a conical tool and pressed into a hole in a test piece of the same aluminium alloy as the inner lower boom. Each test piece was then subjected to alternating stresses. These tests showed that eliminating the interference fit by insertion of a flared bush identical to the one found in the wreckage of VH-RMQ substantially reduced the mean life to failure of the boom – possibly by as much as 50%.Accident Investigation Report, page 18Accident Investigation Report, Section 3.23 The investigation by the Australian Department of Civil Aviation was completed in September 1969 and concluded: > The cause of this accident was that the fatigue endurance of the starboard > inner main spar lower boom was substantially reduced by the insertion of a > flared bush at Station 143 when the margin of safety associated with the > retirement life specified for such booms did not ensure that this boom would > achieve its retirement life in the presence of such a defect.Accident > Investigation Report, Section 3.28 When the Minister tabled the report in the Parliament in September 1969, Jones again called for a public inquiry.\\"Crash was ‘clear case of negligence’\\" The Canberra Times – 27 September 1969, p.11 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 26 April 2014  Aircraft  The aircraft was a Vickers Viscount 720C manufactured in 1954 and assigned serial number 45. It was immediately acquired by Trans Australia Airlines and entered airline service in Australia as VH-TVB. In 1959 it appeared at that year's Farnborough Airshow. It was sold to Ansett-ANA in 1962 and re-registered as VH-RMQ. In September 1968 the aircraft was transferred to Western Australia and operated by MacRobertson Miller Airlines, by then a subsidiary of Ansett-ANA.Accident Investigation Report, page 4 In 1958 the operator, Trans Australia Airlines, replaced both inner lower booms. In 1964 the new owner, Ansett-ANA, again replaced both inner lower booms.Accident Investigation Report, page 14 In February 1968 the aircraft became the first Australian Viscount to reach 30,000 flying hours. It was last inspected by Ansett-ANA in May 1968 when it had made 7,169 flights since the 1964 lower boom replacement. It made another 922 flights before the accident.Accident Investigation Report, Section 3.22 By 31 December 1968 the aircraft had made 25,336 flights and had flown for 31,746 hours. Since its previous complete overhaul it had made 6,429 flights and had flown for 7,188 hours.  Recorders  The aircraft was equipped with a flight data recorder and a cockpit voice recorder. The flight data recorder functioned throughout the flight and continuously recorded the aircraft's pressure altitude, indicated airspeed, vertical acceleration and magnetic heading until the moment of impact with the ground. The cockpit voice recorder was slightly damaged in the impact and subsequent fire but there was no damage to the record of radio transmissions from the aircraft during the final 30 minutes of the flight. The record of ambient noise in the cockpit was also preserved and revealed the precise moment at which the frequency and volume of noise increased suddenly.Accident Investigation Report, Section 1.11Developments in Flight Recorder Equipment and Analysis – p.3 Retrieved 29 August 2011  Safe- life design  The wing of the Vickers Viscount used a single main spar made up of a centre-section in the fuselage, two inner sections and two outer sections. The main spar comprised an upper boom, a shear web and a lower boom. The aircraft was designed and type-certificated to the principle of a safe- life. Before a component reaches its safe-life it must be removed from the aircraft and retired. At the time of the accident the retirement life of the lower boom in the centre-section was 20,500 flights; the inner lower boom was 11,400 flights; and the outer lower boom was 19,000 flights. The retirement life of the spars in the horizontal tailplanes and the vertical fin was 30,000 flights. The retirement life of the wing spar of a transport category aeroplane type-certificated to the safe-life principle is based on a safety factor applied to data obtained from flight tests and information about properties of the spar material. The life of 11,400 flights for the Viscount inner lower boom was based on safety factors of 3.5 for the ground-air-ground cycle and 5.0 for fatigue damage due to atmospheric gusts. These safety factors were typical for this class of aeroplane. A 50% reduction of mean time to failure does not adequately explain why the inner lower boom in VH-RMQ should have failed before reaching its retirement life. In anticipation that the atmospheric gust spectrum in Australia may be more severe on the Viscount than the spectrum in some other climatic zones the gust spectrum was measured during 14,000 Viscount flights in Australia before 1961. The Department of Civil Aviation accepted the Viscount retirement lives as compatible with the atmospheric gust spectrum these aircraft would encounter during operations in Australia.Accident Investigation Report, page 21 The airworthiness design requirements applicable to the Vickers Viscount and other safe-life transport category aeroplanes did not require retirement lives to be determined taking account of an unpredictable gross defect of the kind inflicted on the wing spar of VH-RMQ by insertion of the flared bush. Similarly, the airworthiness maintenance requirements did not require periodic inspection for fatigue cracking of the wing spars. VH-RMQ was inspected by Ansett-ANA in May 1968, 922 flights prior to the accident, but it was not a requirement of this inspection that the wing structure be disassembled to allow access to the lower booms. Even if the wing had been disassembled it is unlikely the cracks radiating from the damaged bolt hole could have been detected. Early in the life of the Viscount aircraft type, renewal of the inner lower booms included installation of new mount fittings for attachment of the rear of the two inboard engine nacelles to the lower booms. New fittings were supplied without pre-drilled holes and the holes were drilled during installation to correctly align the engine nacelle with the wing. However, after considerable in-service experience of the boom-renewal process British Aircraft Corporation amended the procedure to allow re-use of the engine nacelle rear mount fittings. Re- use of the old fittings relied on the existing holes aligning closely with the bushes in the new inner lower booms. When new inner lower booms were installed in VH-RMQ in 1958, new engine nacelle rear mount fittings were also installed but when new booms were again installed in 1964 the fittings first installed in 1958 were re-used. In the wreckage of the right wing of VH-RMQ there was evidence of an initial problem while trying to align the five holes in the old fitting with the bushes in the new boom. The bores of three bushes had been scored with a drill, possibly while maintenance personnel were trying to align three of the holes sufficiently to be able to insert the attachment bolts. Running a drill through the bush at Station 143 may have disturbed the bush and initiated a sequence of actions leading to fatal damage to the wall of the hole.  Aftermath  Immediately after the accident the Department of Civil Aviation temporarily grounded all Australian-registered Viscount Type 700 aircraft.\\"Other disasters\\" The Canberra Times – 1 January 1969, p.1 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 20 December 2013 The temporary grounding of Australian-registered Viscounts was eventually made permanent, pending investigations into the cause of the accident.\\"Viscount 700 series to stay grounded\\" The Canberra Times – 26 September 1969, p.15 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 26 April 2014 Fatigue-failure of the wing of VH-RMQ immediately raised doubt about the validity of the retirement life of the inner lower boom in the Type 700 so British Aircraft Corporation and the UK Air Registration Board (ARB) took the precaution of reducing the life from 11,400 flights to 7,000. This soon resulted in British Aircraft Corporation obtaining a number of inner lower booms with time in service greater than 7,000 flights. Nineteen of these retired booms were examined in detail. Sixteen contained minor fatigue cracks in different critical locations. The longest crack was 0.054-inch (1.37 mm) in a boom that had been in service for 8,194 flights. This evidence convinced British Aircraft Corporation and the UK Air Registration Board that the inner lower boom did not possess the fatigue endurance originally intended so the precautionary life of 7,000 flights was made permanent. When this accident occurred the number of fatalities made it Australia's third worst civil aviation accident, a status it retains to this day. Two civil aviation accidents caused 29 fatalities each – the 1950 Australian National Airways Douglas DC-4 crash and the 1960 Trans Australia Airlines Flight 538.

He held the title of Earl of Desmond from 1536 until his death in 1558. Beginning his tenure in alliance with rebellious groups in Ireland, the 14th Earl of Desmond eventually gained favour with the Crown, ultimately being appointed Lord Treasurer of Ireland in 1547, an office which he maintained until his death. Early years Immediately on the death of his father in June 1536, James FitzGerald assumed the position and title of Earl of Desmond. In order to support his position, FitzGerald united with O'Brien of Thomond, the head of the discontented party in Ireland. The government, which had just suppressed the rebellion of Thomas FitzGerald, 10th Earl of Kildare, resolved to attack him, and on 25 July 1536, Lord Leonard Grey, Lord Deputy of Ireland marched against him. Breaching the border of Cashel, Grey sought to separate FitzGerald from O'Brien, \\"so as we might have entangled but with one of them at once.\\" Grey took possession of FitzGerald's castle in Lough Gur, the doors and windows of which had been carried away and the roof burned by the FitzGeralds. He gave the captured castle to Lord James Butler, 9th Earl of Ormond. =Claim to the earldom= FitzGerald \\"showed himself in gesture and communication very reasonable\\", and offered to deliver up his two sons as hostages, and to submit his claims to the earldom to the decision of Lord Grey. FitzGerald's claim was renewed in December of the same year. \\"And as far as ever I could perceive,\\" wrote Grey to Thomas Cromwell in February 1537, \\"the stay that keepeth him from inclining to the king's grace's pleasure is the fear and doubt which he and all the Geraldines\\"Geraldines\\" was the name for members of the FitzGerald dynasty. in Munster have in the Lord James Butler, both for the old malice that hath been betwixt their bloods, and principally for that he claimeth title by his wife to the earldom of Desmond.\\"State Papers, Hen. VIII, ii., p. 404. Grey argued in favour of FitzGerald's claims. In August 1538, Anthony St Leger, who was at the time serving on the commission \\"for the order and establishment to be taken and made touching the whole state of Ireland,\\" was advised by Cromwell \\"to handle the said James in a gentle sort.\\" Accordingly, on 15 September, FitzGerald was invited to submit his claims to the commissioners at Dublin. Suspecting their intention, he declined to place himself in their power, though signing articles of submission and promising to deliver up his eldest son as hostage for his good faith. The negotiations continued to be delayed. In March 1538, the commissioners wrote that FitzGerald \\"hath not only delivered his son, according to his first promise, to the hands of Mr. William Wyse of Waterford to be delivered unto us, but also hath affirmed by his secretary and writing all that he afore promised.\\"State Papers, Hen. VIII, ii., p. 550. =Fortune's chance= FitzGerald had good reason for his caution. The Ormonde faction in the council, violently opposed to Grey and St Leger, were assiduously striving to effect his ruin. In July 1539, John Allen related to Cromwell how the \\"pretended Earl of Desmond\\" had confederated with O'Donnell and O'Neill \\"to make insurrection against the king's majesty and his subjects, not only for the utter exile and destruction of them, but also for the bringing in, setting up, and restoring young Gerald (the sole surviving scion of the house of Kildare) to all the possessions and pre-eminences which his father had; and so finally among them to exclude the king from all his regalities within this land.\\"State Papers, Hen. VIII, iii., p. 136. In April 1540 the council informed Henry VIII of England that \\"your grace's servant James Fitzmaurice, who claimed to be Earl of Desmond, was cruelly slain the Friday before Palm Sunday, of unfortunate chance, by Maurice FitzJohn FitzGerald, brother to James FitzJohn FitzGerald, then usurper of the earldom of Desmond. After which murder done, the said James Fitzjohn immediately resorted to your town of Youghal, where he was well received and entertained, and ere he departed entered into all such piles and garrisons in the county of Cork as your majesty's deputy, with the assistance of your army and me, the Earl of Ormonde, obtained before Christmas last.\\"State Papers, Hen. VIII, iii., p. 195. Ormonde was sent to parley with FitzGerald, but he refused to trust him. On the arrival of St Leger as deputy, however, FitzGerald again renewed his offer of submission, and promised, upon pledges being given for his safety, to meet him at Cashel. This he did, and renounced the supremacy of the Pope. \\"And then,\\" wrote St Leger, \\"considering the great variance between the Earl of Ormonde and him, concerning the title of the earldom of Desmond ... I and my fellows thought it not good to leave that cancer remain, but so laboured the matter on both sides, that we have brought them to a final end of the said title.\\" =Investiture= St Leger assured King Henry \\"that sith my repair into this your land I have not heard better counsel of no man for the reformation of the same than of the said Earl of Desmond, who undoubted is a very wise and discreet gentleman,\\" for which reason, he said, he had sworn him of the council and given him \\"gown, jacket, doublet, hose, shirts, caps, and a riding coat of velvet, which he took very thankfully, and ware the same in Limerick and in all places where he went with me.\\"State Papers, Hen. VIII, iii., p. 285. By such conciliatory conduct St Leger, in the opinion of Justice Cusack, won over to obedience the whole province of Munster.Cal. Carew MSS. i. 245. In July 1541, James FitzGerald was appointed chief executor of the \\"ordinances for the reformation of Ireland\\" in Munster. In token of the renunciation of the privilege claimed by his ancestors of not being obliged to attend the great councils of the realm, he took his seat in a parliament held at Dublin. In June 1542 he visited England, where he was graciously received by King Henry, his title acknowledged, and the king wrote to the Irish council \\"that the Earl of Desmond hath here submitted himself in so honest, lowly, and humble a sort towards us, as we have conceived a very great hope that he will prove a man of great honour, truth, and good service\\". Nor did he, during the rest of his life, fail to justify this opinion. On 9 July 1543 he obtained a grant of the crown lease of St. Mary's Abbey, Dublin, \\"for his better supporting at his repair\\" to parliament. Henry's son, Edward VI, named him Lord Treasurer of Ireland on the death of the Earl of Ormonde (patent 29 March 1547), and on 15 October 1547, when thanking him for his services in repressing disorders in Munster, King Henry offered to make a companion of his son. During the government of Edward Bellingham he was accused of treason, and having refused a peremptory order to appear in Dublin, the deputy swooped down upon him unexpectedly in the dead of winter 1548, and carried him off prisoner. He was soon released and continued in office by Queen Mary. Marriages and progeny James FitzGerald married four times: first, Joan Roche, daughter of Maurice Roche, Lord Fermoy, his own grandniece, for which reason, the marriage was annulled and their son, Sir Tomás Ruadh FitzGerald of Conna, father of James (Séamus) Fitzgerald, \\"the Sugán Earl,\\" was disinherited. James FitzGerald then married Móre O'Carroll, daughter of Sir Maolrony McShane O'Carroll, Lord of Ely, by whom he had Géaroîd, his heir, as well as another son, Seán, and four daughters. Móre O'Carroll died in 1548. FitzGerald's third wife was Caitríona Butler, second daughter of Piers Butler, 8th Earl of Ormond, and widow of Richard, Baron le Poer. Caitríona died at Askeaton on 17 March 1553. His last marriage was to Evelyn Mór MacCarthy, daughter of Donal MacCormac, MacCarthy Môr, by whom he had a son, Sir Séamus- Sussex FitzGerald who died in 1580, and a daughter, Elinor. Ancestry Death In the summer of 1558 the 14th Earl of Desmond was afflicted with a serious illness, and died at Askeaton on Thursday, 27 October. He was buried in the abbey of the White Friars in Tralee. A half century after James FitzGerald's death, chroniclers of the Annals of Four Masters observed, \\"The loss of this good man was woful to his country; for there was no need to watch cattle or close doors from Dun-caoin, in Kerry, to the green-bordered meeting of the three waters, on the confines of the province of Eochaidh, the son of Lachta and Leinster.\\"Annála Rioghachta Éireann.

It is endemic to Texas in the United States, where it occurs in two counties near the Mexican border. It became rare due to the destruction and degradation of its habitat.Thymophylla tephroleuca. The Nature Conservancy.Thymophylla tephroleuca. Center for Plant Conservation. It is a federally listed endangered species of the United States.  Description  This plant, a shrub or subshrub, produces a clump of stems up to 30 centimeters tall. The herbage is ashy gray-green, gray, or whitish due to a layer of white woolly hairs. The leaves are linear to threadlike and are arranged alternately along the stems. They measure 1 to 1.5 centimeters long. The inflorescence is a flower head with a bell-shaped involucre of woolly-haired phyllaries. There are 12 or 13 yellow ray florets and about 30 disc florets at the center. The fruit is an achene with a pappus of scales.Thymophylla tephroleuca. Flora of North America. Blooming occurs mostly in March through May but it may bloom at other times depending on rainfall.

Most of the local territory has converted to brushland dominated by cenizo (Leucophyllum frutescens) blackbrush (Coleogyne ramosissima), and creosote bush (Larrea tridentata). Other dominant plant species include mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), goatbush (Castela texana), anacahuita (Cordia boissieri), and javelina brush (Microrhamnus ericoides). The introduced buffelgrass (Cenchrus ciliaris) is common.USFWS. Thymophylla tephroleuca Recovery Plan. July 29, 1988.  Conservation  By 1979 this plant was known from a in Zapata County, Texas. By the time the plant was placed on the Endangered Species List in 1984, there was a single population containing about 1300 plants bisected by a highway. More populations have been found in the years since, and currently there are six in Zapata and Webb Counties. Highway maintenance is an ongoing threat to the species, as the plant grows directly next to a highway. Dying plants have been observed at the highway's edge, a possible sign of herbicide application. The installation of a gas pipeline likely destroyed some plants and its maintenance is a threat to others in the area. Grazing is not a direct threat because cattle do not eat the foul-smelling plant, but their trampling may compact the soil. The introduction of buffelgrass for better grazing has led to drastic changes in the plant community, because it spreads and competes easily with other species.

The Artist's Resale Right was fully implemented in the UK on 1 January 2012, also entitling artist's heirs and beneficiaries to a resale royalty. DACS retains 15% of the royalties collected from UK sales. They do not retain anything for royalties collected from overseas sales. In 2014, DACS launched its newest service called Artimage, which complements the organisation's Copyright Licensing service by making artists' images available for licensing via a dedicated website. Governance DACS is governed by a board of directors. They include both artists and lawyers as well as other professionals who are responsible for the overall performance of the organisation. Mark Stephens (solicitor) CBE, of Howard Kennedy, has been Chair of the Board of Directors since 2011. DACS reintroduced Voting membership in 2014. All Voting members are eligible to attend DACS’ Annual General Meetings (AGMs) and vote on matters of the company, for example to appoint or remove a Board Director, to approve their financial documentation or other governance matters.

Named for its location on the northeastern corner of the intersection of Main and Third Streets, the cluster is historically significant for its general homogeneity despite being constructed over a long period of time.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 627. Three buildings compose the cluster: *The Anderson Building, which faces Main, was built in the Victorian style in 1893. *The former McMicken School of Design, located on the corner, is an Italianate structure completed in 1862. Four stories tall, it is constructed of sandstone.Federal Writers Project. Cincinnati: a Guide to the Queen City and Its Neighbors. Cincinnati: Wiesen- Hart, 1943, 159. *The Burkhardt Building, which faces Third, is a Neoclassical building; it was erected in 1910. Although the ages of the three buildings are nearly fifty years from oldest to newest, they nevertheless compose an architecturally important unit; architectural historians have ranked both the McMicken School and the Anderson Building as premier examples of their styles, due in part to their high-quality construction methods and artistry. Although the Burkhardt Building is of lesser significance, it remains a good example of Neoclassical architecture. Together, the three buildings are typical of late nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century architecture, which combined a range of styles in the same geographical area. Due to their location very close to the shoreline of the Ohio River and to the oldest parts of Cincinnati, the cluster occupies land that formerly held other important buildings. Chief among these is a previous occupant of the land under the McMicken School of Design: during the 1830s, the building on the site was used as offices for young lawyer Salmon P. Chase; a well-regarded book about Ohio law that he wrote while working at Third and Main helped propel him to prominence in Ohio politics and eventually to the position of Chief Justice of the United States. In 1983, the Main and Third Street Cluster was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its historic architecture and because of its place in local history. In late 2012, the cluster was expanded by the addition of buildings as far north as 318 Main Street; the addition was given the name of \\"Main Street Buildings\\".Weekly List of Actions Taken on Properties: 11/13/12 through 11/16/12, National Park Service, 2012-11-23.

Harish-Chandra's c-function Gindikin–Karpelevich formula The c-function has a generalization cw(λ) depending on an element w of the Weyl group. The unique element of greatest length s0, is the unique element that carries the Weyl chamber mathfrak{a}_+^* onto -mathfrak{a}_+^*. By Harish-Chandra's integral formula, cs0 is Harish-Chandra's c-function: : c(lambda)=c_{s_0}(lambda). The c-functions are in general defined by the equation : displaystyle A(s,lambda)xi_0 =c_s(lambda)xi_0, where ξ0 is the constant function 1 in L2(K/M). The cocycle property of the intertwining operators implies a similar multiplicative property for the c-functions: : c_{s_1s_2}(lambda) =c_{s_1}(s_2 lambda)c_{s_2}(lambda) provided :ell(s_1s_2)=ell(s_1)+ell(s_2). This reduces the computation of cs to the case when s = sα, the reflection in a (simple) root α, the so-called \\"rank-one reduction\\" of . In fact the integral involves only the closed connected subgroup Gα corresponding to the Lie subalgebra generated by mathfrak{g}_{pm alpha} where α lies in Σ0+. Then Gα is a real semisimple Lie group with real rank one, i.e. dim Aα = 1, and cs is just the Harish-Chandra c-function of Gα. In this case the c-function can be computed directly and is given by :c_{s_alpha}(lambda)=c_0{2^{-i(lambda,alpha_0)}Gamma(i(lambda,alpha_0))overGamma({1over 2} ({1over 2}m_alpha + 1+ i(lambda,alpha_0)) Gamma({1over 2} ({1over 2}m_alpha + m_{2alpha} + i(lambda,alpha_0))}, where :c_0=2^{m_alpha/2 + m_{2alpha}}Gammaleft({1over 2} (m_alpha+m_{2alpha} +1)right) and α0=α/〈α,α〉. The general Gindikin–Karpelevich formula for c(λ) is an immediate consequence of this formula and the multiplicative properties of cs(λ), as follows: :c(lambda)=c_0prod_{alphainSigma_0^+}{2^{-i(lambda,alpha_0)}Gamma(i(lambda,alpha_0))overGamma({1over 2} ({1over 2}m_alpha + 1+ i(lambda,alpha_0)) Gamma({1over 2} ({1over 2}m_alpha + m_{2alpha} + i(lambda,alpha_0))}, where the constant c0 is chosen so that c(–iρ)=1 .

Tomás RuadhFitzGerald was the son of James FitzGerald, 14th Earl of Desmond and Joan Roche, daughter of Maurice Roche, Lord Fermoy. As Joan Roche was his own grandniece, their relationship fell within the proscribed limits of consanguinity. For which reason, the marriage was annulled and their son, Sir Tomás Ruadh FitzGerald of Conna, father of James (Séamus) Fitzgerald, \\"the Sugán Earl,\\" was declared illegitimate and therefore disinherited. Tomás Ruadh and Ellice le Poer had at least two other children, John FitzThomas, and a daughter, who married Donald Pipi MacCarthy Reagh. Inclined to dispute the claim of his father's younger, legitimate brother Gerald FitzGerald, 15th Earl of Desmond, the current of politics proved too strong against James FitzThomas. Toward the end of his short life, the putative earl of Desmond eventually sank into obscurity. =Marriage and children= James Fitzthomas FitzGerald married Ellen, widow of Maurice FitzGibbon, elder brother of Edmund FitzGibbon FitzGerald, the White Knight, but had no issue. =Claims to the earldom= When of an age to understand his position as heir to a contested title, James Fitzthomas repaired to court to petition Elizabeth for a restoration of his rights. At first, his petition was regarded with favour. The crown offered slight encouragement and promised him a yearly allowance. Consequently, during the rebellion of his uncle Gerald, both he and his father remained staunch allies of the English crown. After the death of the 15th Earl and the suppression of the rebellion in 1583, James FitzThomas and his father looked for their restoration to the earldom. Their petitions however, no longer found favour at Elizabeth's court, for Munster was to be denuded of its native population, \\"planted\\" with Englishmen, and re-established as a settlement colony of England.Nicholas Canny, Making Ireland British 1580-1650, (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2003), pp. 128–129Colm Lennon, Sixteenth Century Ireland: The Incomplete Conquest, (London, UK: Gill & MacMillan, 2005)Pádraig Lenihan, Confederate Catholics at War, 1642 - 1649.

James FitzThomas assumed the title of Earl of Desmond, and before long found himself at the head of eight thousand clansmen. On 12 October 1598, realizing that he would obtain little if any justice, \\"to maintain his right, trusting in the Almighty to further the same,\\" James FitzThomas stated both his grievances and intentions in response to the expostulations of the Earl of Ormonde. The younger FitzGerald's struggle lasted three years. In 1598, he took Desmond Hall and Castle in Newcastle West, but lost it the following year. In October 1600, while withdrawing his forces from the open into the woods of Aharlow, he was surprised by Captain Richard Graeme and the garrison of Kilmallock. From that day the Geraldines never rallied again to any purpose. Dismissing his followers, the earl took to the woods for safety, where, in May 1601, Sir George Carew was informed that he was living \\"in the habit of a priest,\\" but determined \\"to die rather than to depart the province, retaining still his traitorly hopes to be relieved out of Ulster or out of Spain.\\"Cal. Carew MSS. iv. 55. Carew made several attempts to procure his capture or death, but without success, for \\"such is the superstitious folly of these people, as for no price he may be had, holding the same to be so heinous as no priest will give them absolution.\\"Cal. Carew MSS. iii. 471. Eventually, on 29 May 1601, he was captured by Edmund FitzGibbon FitzGerald, the White Knight, while hiding in \\"an obscure cave many fathoms underground\\" in the neighborhood of Mitchelstown. FitzGerald was placed in irons to prevent a rescue, \\"so exceedingly beloved of all sorts\\" was he, and conveyed to Shandon Castle, where he was immediately arraigned and adjudged guilty of treason. For a time Carew hoped to make use of James FitzThomas against a still greater rebel, Hugh O'Neill. However, on 13 August, finding FitzGerald to be after all but a \\"dull-spirited traitor,\\" Carew handed him over to Sir Anthony Cooke, who conveyed FitzGerald to England, where, on his arrival, he was placed in the Tower of London. Ancestry Later life and death Of his life in prison there remains only the following pathetic notice: \\"The demands of Sir John Peyton, Lieutenant of Her Majesty's Tower of London, for one quarter of a year, from St. Michael's day 1602 till the feast of our Lord God next. For James M'Thomas. Sayd tyme at 3l. per week, physicke, sourgeon, and watcher with him in his Lunacy.\\" Historians conjecture that FitzGerald died sometime in 1608, and was buried in the chapel of the Tower. After FitzGerald's capture, his brother John FitzThomas FitzGerald, who had shared with him in the vicissitudes of the rebellion, and who indeed seems to have been the prime instigator of it, escaped with his wife, the daughter of Richard Comerford of Dangenmore, Kilkenny, into Spain, where he was styled the Conde de Desmond, and where he died a few years afterwards in Barcelona.Webb, Alfred.

Waltham conducts scientific research into pet care and nutrition for dogs, cats, fish and horses. History The pet food subsidiary of Mars, Incorporated (Mars Petcare) began research into pet nutrition in the early 1960s, formally founding a Nutrition Research Unit in 1965. Originally the institute was housed at a nearby location but was moved to an old stud farm at Waltham-on-the-Wolds in 1973. Since 2001, a non-charitable organisation called the Waltham Foundation has funded a number of humane scientific research projects dedicated to furthering the health and nutrition of companion animals. Research *In July 2005, in collaboration with the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Pennsylvania, Waltham discovered that cats cannot taste sweet food because they have a faulty gene. Lions, tigers, leopards and pumas (family Felidae) have the same defective gene. * In April 2007, in collaboration with the National Human Genome Research Institute of Bethesda, Maryland, Waltham found that the genetic variation of dogs' size is due to mutations in the IGF-1 gene. This was discovered through research on the Portuguese Water Dog. This research was preparatory work for similar studies on the human genome.

Typically, it is shown on Virgin Media One (formerly known as \\"TV3\\") on Saturday evenings and Sunday afternoons during the All-Ireland championships in both hurling and football, showing live coverage of the day's match. History In 2007 it was announced that TV3 had signed a three-year deal with the Gaelic Athletic Association which would see the independent station broadcast thirty games between 2008 and 2010. While Setanta Sports and TG4 had shown National League and club championship games before, this was the first time since 1962 that senior inter-county championship games would not be screened exclusively on RTÉ. TV3 also announced that Championship Throw-In, a weekly magazine programme, would also be broadcast. All of the new GAA-themed programmes were launched at Croke Park on 15 May 2008. Following the completion of the initial three-year deal in 2010, the GAA were satisfied to give TV3 an expanded role in Gaelic games broadcasting. A second three-year deal saw the station get exclusive rights to broadcast eleven matches, albeit only one match more than the original deal, however, the deal now included All-Ireland football quarter-finals and both All-Ireland minor finals. =Series 1= For the first series the programme started an hour before throw-in and remained on air for an hour after the end of the game. Championship Live was broadcast for the first time on Sunday 1 June 2008. The programme was broadcast live from the Gaelic Grounds in Limerick and featured the Munster Hurling Championship quarter-final between Clare and Waterford. The other games broadcast during the first series were the Leinster Football Championship quarter-final between Dublin and Louth, both Leinster Football Championship semi-finals, the Leinster Hurling Championship final, the Connacht Football Championship final, the Ulster Football Championship final and one game each from the three rounds of the All-Ireland football qualifiers. =Series 2= The second series of Championship Live followed the same format as the first series. Once again TV3 had exclusive rights to ten championship games. The opening programme of the second series was broadcast on 7 June 2009 and featured coverage of the Munster Football Championship semi-final clash between Cork and Kerry. The other games covered live included one Munster Hurling Championship semi-final, one Leinster Senior Football Championship semi-final, the Munster Football Championship final, the Leinster Football Championship final, the Connacht Football Championship final and the Leinster Hurling Championship final. TV3 were also granted \\"first pick\\" rights to the last three rounds of the All-Ireland football qualifiers. qualifying rounds. =Series 3= The first programme in the third series of Championship Live aired on 14 June 2010.

The following week Championship Live broadcast their very first \\"double header\\" with a Leinster Hurling Championship semi-final and a Munster Hurling Championship semi-final. One week later the programme monopolised Gaelic games coverage once again with a \\"double header\\" featuring a Leinster Football Championship semi-final a Connacht Football Championship semi-final. TV3 also had the exclusive rights to the Munster Football Championship final, the Connacht Football Championship final and also had \\"first pick\\" rights in the decisive qualifying rounds of the All-Ireland football qualifiers. =Series 4= After the renewal of the broadcasting contract with the GAA, the first Championship Live of the fourth series aired on 5 June 2011.

It lived during the latest Triassic period (latest Norian to early Rhaetian stage, between 205–200 Ma). Its remains have been found in Lisowice, southern Poland. The type species is Smok wawelski (after the Wawel Dragon) and was named in 2012. It is larger than any other known predatory archosaur from the Late Triassic or Early Jurassic of central Europe. The relation of Smok to other archosaurs has not yet been thoroughly studied; it may be a rauisuchid, prestosuchid or ornithosuchid crurotarsan (part of the crocodile line of archosaurs) or a theropod dinosaur (part of the bird line of archosaurs). Description Skeletal restoration showing known remains. At an estimated in length, Smok was the largest carnivorous archosaur in central Europe at the time. It was larger than any other known theropod dinosaur or pseudosuchian living in central Europe during either the Late Triassic or Early Jurassic. The skull is long. Several features indicate that Smok is an archosaur, including serrated teeth, a contact between the jugal and quadratojugal bones at the back of the skull, a hole in front of the eye socket called the antorbital fenestra, maxillae bones in the upper jaw that connect along their palatal processes, and a rounded projection on the upper part of the femur bone. The braincase of Smok includes many derived (advanced) features. The most prominent of these is a funnel-shaped structure on the bottom of the braincase, formed by a very wide, rounded basisphenoid bone. A deep notch called the basisphenoid recess cuts into the back of this funnel. Above the funnel is a very thin area of the braincase that is formed by deep depressions on the basisphenoids. Cranial elements in several views Smok has several features that are shared with both dinosaurs and crocodile-line archosaurs, making classification difficult. Similarities with theropods include a groove, or antitrochanter, on the ilium bone of the hip that is part of the acetabulum (a depression where the head of the femur attaches to the hip). Smok and theropods also have an anterior trochanter on the femur. Some large theropods share with Smok the deep depressions of the basisphenoids in the braincase. Similarities with rauisuchians include a triangular antorbital fenestra and a connection between the ectopterygoid and jugal bones of the skull that is split into two projections. The hip of Smok has a ridge on the lateral surface of the ilium above the acetabulum. This ridge is a defining characteristic of rauisuchians, forming a buttress over the femur and giving these animals a pillar-erect stance. Other features of Smok seem to exclude it from these groups of archosaurs. The premaxilla and maxilla of the upper jaw attach closely to each other, making a continuous row of evenly spaced teeth. Early theropods and orthithosuchids have a toothless gap between the premaxilla and the maxilla, distinguishing them from Smok. The upper jaw bones of rauisuchians are not closely connected, leaving a small opening between the premaxilla and maxilla that is not seen in Smok. Unlike many pseudosuchids and theropods, Smok does not have pneumatic areas, or air pockets, in the braincase. It also has several features that link it with primitive archosauromorphs, including the presence of a postfrontal bone on the skull and a closed acetabulum in the hip. Discovery and naming Braincase Smok was found in a locality near Lisowice village that is latest Norian to early Rhaetian in age. This area was known to contain Triassic fossils since it was formally described in 2008. The first material of Smok, the jawbone and fragments of the skull, was discovered in 2007. It was first described in 2008 as a theropod dinosaur based on features in its braincase and frontal bone. The material was also thought to represent two individuals. Similarities were noted between the braincase of the animal and that of allosaurs. When the discovery was first announced, it was called \\"the Dragon of Lisowice\\" and was purported to be the first member of a line of dinosaurs that led to Tyrannosaurus rex. Bones from other parts of the body were found in 2009 and 2010. Five tracks made by a three-toed archosaur – presumably a theropod dinosaur – were found in rocks that were above the layer where Smok was found. The footprints may belong to Smok, but the lack of foot bones in the skeleton make this association uncertain. Isolated teeth. Smok is known from the holotype ZPAL V.33/15, a partially complete braincase which is associated with a partially preserved skeleton, including cranial and postcranial bones from the referred materials ZPAL V.33/16-56, 97-102, 295-314, 434 and 507. All specimens were found in the same location (Lipie Śląskie clay-pit Formation) and probably represent a single individual. It was first named by Grzegorz Niedźwiedzki, Tomasz Sulej and Jerzy Dzik in 2011, after the mythological Polish dragon of the same name that lived in a cave near the excavation site. The cave was on Wawel Hill, the namesake of the type species S. wawelski. Paleoecology Smok was the largest predator in its environment. Other large predatory archosaurs included the dinosaur Liliensternus and the rauisuchids Polonosuchus and Teratosaurus, but these animals were much smaller than Smok. It was one of the largest archosaurs in the world during the Late Triassic, and larger archosaurs did not appear until after the Early Jurassic. Smok lived alongside small carnivorous dinosauromorph and poposauroid archosaurs and large herbivorous dicynodonts. Paleobiology Comparison of two Smok reconstructions by Szymon Górnicki Examination of coprolites attributed to Smok by Martin Qvarnström et al., indicate that this archosaur was able to crush bone. Based on examination of the bone fragments within the coprolites, Smok's ability to retain food within its digestive system varied considerably based on prey availability and food type. The variable mixture of bones, some belonging to fish, others to dicynodonts, and to temnospondyls indicates Smok was a generalized predator. Teeth from this archosaur were also uncovered from these trace fossils, indicating it may have swallowed its own broken teeth during feeding. The heavy amounts of bone in the diet indicate that salt and marrow from the bones of herbivores and other prey items was an important component in the archosaur's diet; an important behavior often linked with modern mammalian predators but seldom studied in ancient archosaurian reptiles. The findings were published in the journal Scientific Reports in 2019.

It was released on December 1, 2008, on Oof! Records. Background Birds was a continuation of the work begun on the ensemble's first album, North Sea Radio Orchestra, consisting almost entirely of original compositions and containing settings of antique poetry from the Victorian and Edwardian eras and earlier. As with the previous album, Birds contained settings of poems by Thomas Hardy (\\"The Wound\\" and \\"Phantom\\") and Alfred, Lord Tennyson (\\"The Flower\\" and \\"Move Eastward Happy Earth\\", both of which had been in the repertoire of the ensemble since its earliest concerts in 2002). Birds expanded the band's choice of poetry for setting choice by including settings of Geoffrey Chaucer (\\"Now Welcom Somer\\") and William Blake (\\"The Angel\\", \\"A Poison Tree\\" and \\"Golden Cage\\"). Almost all of the music was written by group leader Craig Fortnam with the exception of \\"Personent Hodie\\" (a Fortnam arrangement of a traditional tune) and \\"Harbour Wall\\", which was a Fortnam arrangement of a composition by William D. Drake (the original of which had appeared as a solo piano performance on Drake's 2007 album Yews Paw). The band performed a concert at St Martin in the Fields on 18 November 2008 to promote the release of Birds. One album track, \\"The Flower\\", had previously been released as the first track on a 7-inch vinyl EP. Critical reception Reviews of the album were generally positive. Isle Of Man Today described Birds as \\"effortlessly beautiful to listen to… NSRO manage to take you back centuries to an ancient form of music while retaining an eerie ability to remain thoroughly modern… Birds has a distinctly non-conformist sound but nevertheless achieves its aim with quiet, reserved gusto. NSRO aren't about to go on a media rampage shouting about how good they are; the whole project is far too middle-class for that. But by putting out Birds they are giving their audience a knowing wink. They realise they've created a fine piece of work and you can feel the confidence growing from track to track.\\"Isle Of Man Today review of Birds, retrieved November 19, 2008 The Cambridgeshire Times called the album \\"an intriguing proposition [which] feels at times like it's just been unearthed from an archaeological dig alongside some ancient flagstones. Organ, violins, clarinet, bassoon and oboe feature heavily alongside acoustic guitar, drum, percussion and choral parts, conjuring up images of royal court musicians… [The album] straddles the less crowded end of 60s folk and revives traditional chamber music, managing to sound timeless and refreshing rather than hopelessly outdated. A calming record of quality musicianship and carefully woven melodies.\\" The review also praised Sharron Fortnam as being \\"a beguiling embodiment of a cut-glass English Rose singer, delicate, classical, strong and capable.\\"Cambridgeshire Times review of Birds, retrieved November 19, 2008 Reviewing Birds in issue 181, Mojo described the album as sounding like \\"Tortoise reworked by Howard Goodall\\" and suggested \\"there's charm and melody aplenty, but the churchier excursions suggest bourgeois smugness - Blake would not approve.\\"David Sheppard, Review of NSRO album Birds in Mojo #181, retrieved October 24, 2008 In the underground music press, the Name Someone That’s Not A Parasite music blog hailed the NSRO as \\"(the) band British Sea Power wish they could be!

Part classical, part folk, part something entirely new, if you fancy dipping your toe in something a bit different, then this is a great rock pool to do it in.\\"Subba Cultcha review of Birds, retrieved November 19, 2008 Organ lavishly praised the album, saying that \\"North Sea Radio Orchestra are blossoming in a rather fine way now with their inviting mix of delicate English prog and 20th century classical pastoral folk. Harmonically rich and fluid in a Henry Cow, Art Bears, Incredible String Band kind of way... A fine mix of delicate English folk and something that has evolved out of fine traditions of chamber music… Birds is an album pulling gently in two distinct ways. One direction; nice, simple, sitting in a sunny field, female-voiced acoustic folk, the other towards a rarer thing, this fusion of English medieval progressive classical, chamber orchestral music, via Vaughan Williams, Cardiacs, Vernon Elliott, Henry Cow. In the end, it all works as a melodic spirited integral classical whole. Always more than just decorating modern music with classical instrumentation, at its core a real orchestra, this is something that’s both timeless and enchantingly beautiful – a very fine, very enjoyable rather magical album.\\"Organ magazine review of Birds , retrieved November 19, 2008  Track listing  All music written by Craig Fortnam except where noted.

After an investigation into his death, it was determined by the International Security Assistance Force that an American soldier had accidentally killed Khpalwak while clearing a broadcast building of terrorists while Tarin Kowt was under attack. Khpalwak was the third journalist from Pajhwok to be killed in three years. He was the third BBC reporter to be killed in Afghanistan and the second BBC reporter to be killed in the War in Afghanistan. Biography =Career= Khpalwak began working for Pajhwok after completing his education in 2007, and he worked first as a freelancer and then later became staff. Khpalwak joined the staff of the BBC World Service as a journalist on 1 May 2008. He worked as a stringer for the BBC, based in Uruzgan Province, and was paid for each story which was published or broadcast by the BBC. He often reported for BBC Pashto on events in southern Afghanistan. Khpalwak simultaneously also worked for Pajhwok Afghan News agency. \\"His last two stories for Pajhwok Afghan News, before he died on 28 July in a major attack in Tarin Kowt, capital of Uruzgan province, were about an attack on police checkpoints in which both Taliban and police were killed, and an interview with a would-be suicide bomber. Few of his 24 years of life saw any kind of peace in Afghanistan,\\" a colleague wrote. =Personal= Khpalwak, who was twenty-four years old, was survived by his parents, his elder brother, three sisters, and his wife and three-month-old daughter. After Khpalwak's death, Khpalwak's father, Ghulam Nabi, did not accept offers by the United States to compensate the family Omaid's death and wanted the investigation to continue. The family members sought asylum in Australia for fear of retaliation. Abdul Mujeeb Khalvatgar, executive director of NAI SOMA, said the capital did not offer the Khpalwaks anonymity because it was small and he believed the Khpalwaks were in danger. Background Three suicide bombers and three accomplices bombed several government buildings as well as a broadcasting station in which a total of 21 civilians were killed and 38 more injured. The dead included 10 children, three police, and one Afghan reporter. Afghan and US-led NATO forces engaged responded and killed all insurgents. In the shooting, Pajhwok Journalist Ahmad Omaid Khpalwak was killed by a group of US soldiers while they were clearing the broadcasting station. The incident occurred over a 5-hour period. Death Khpalwak was killed by American ISAF troops 28 July 2011 in Tarin Kowt, Afghanistan, after Taliban insurgents attacked government facilities, as well as the state broadcasting station, in Uruzgan's provincial capital. The New York Times called the attack one of the \\"most audacious surprise attacks\\" ever undertaken by the Taliban. Reporters Without Borders and BBC News called for an investigation after Khpalwak was killed at the broadcasting station. The journalist's brother Ahmad Jawid Khpalwak believed he was reaching for his press card when he was shot. The Los Angeles Times wrote about text messages that Khpalwak sent his brother in the minutes before he was killed. \\"Death is approaching,\\" he messaged. \\"I am hiding;\\" and a short time later wrote, \\"If I die, pray for me.\\" A NATO investigation revealed 8 September that an American soldier had killed Khpalwak. Kphalwak's death happened while he was reporting for BBC Pashto about the Taliban attack. The ISAF arrived at an attacked building and was making sure that there were no Taliban still inside. An American soldier discovered Khpalwak hiding in a bathroom and saw Khpalwak reaching for something when it was mostly likely his press card. The soldier thought that Khpalwak could have been a suicide bomber and trying to reach for a device that would set off a bomb before he shot 20 rounds at Khpalwak with an M-4. The investigation also said Khpalwak held a press identification card in his hand. The investigation concluded, \\"... the ISAF member involved in this incident complied with the laws of armed conflict and rules of engagement and acted reasonably under the circumstances.\\" Context While the intended targets of the Taliban attack were Uruzgan's Governor and a militia leader named Matiullah Khan, the Taliban also stormed the offices of local radio and television stations, leading to Khpalwak being killed while hiding in a bathroom by American troops that came to sweep out the Taliban. Local reporters are the ones who are in the most danger, according to press activist Abdul Mujeeb Khalvatgar, executive director the NAI Supporting Open Media in Afghanistan. Impact Khpalwak is the third Pajhwok reporter and the third BBC reporter to be killed in Afghanistan. Working for the BBC, Mirwais Jalil died in Kabul in the civil war of the 1990s. During the War in Afghanistan, Abdul Samad Rohani was killed by an unknown gunman in Lashkargah, Helmand Province June 2008. Like Khpalwak, Rohani worked for both Pajhwok and the BBC Word News. Pajhwok reporter Janullah Hashimzada was killed in the remote Khyber area August 2009. Reactions The incident raised continuing concerns about the civilian casualties in the War in Afghanistan. The Los Angeles Times said, \\"The incident points up the daily dangers faced by Afghans who work for foreign organizations, as well as Afghan civilians in general, particularly those living in a broad swath of Afghanistan's restive south.\\" Peter Horrocks, director of BBC Global News, said: \\"Ahmed Omed's death further highlights the great dangers facing journalists who put their lives on the line to provide vital news from around the world. It is essential that journalists are given the best possible protection whilst reporting in dangerous situations so that the world can hear their stories.\\" Reporters Without Borders said, \\"This mishap has highlighted the constant danger for civilians and journalists, who are often at the center of the fighting.\\" The press freedom and safety organisation held NATO and the Taliban responsible for Khpalwak's death. Recognition A press club in the Afghan province Uruzgan was named in honour of Ahmad Omaid Khpalwak.

The commission served for 20 years, from 1999 until its dissolution by President Rodrigo Duterte in November 2019. The body's powers and functions were transferred to the Manila Bay Task Force and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources.  History  The commission was created on January 6, 1999 through Executive Order No. 54 to strengthen the government's program to rehabilitate the river for transportation, recreation and tourism purposes. Its powers and functions, according to the Executive Order, were to: * Draw up an updated and integrated Master Plan on the Rehabilitation of the Pasig River; * Ensure that the easements provided for in the Civil Code and other related laws are observed including all the esteros and waterways that drain into the Pasig River; * Integrate and coordinate all programs related to the rehabilitation of the Pasig River; * Abate the dumping of untreated industrial wastewater and sewerage into the river including all acts and omission in violation of the Pollution Control Law and other related laws; * Relocate settlers, squatters and other unauthorized or unlawful occupants along its banks; * Undertake civil works for the purpose, such as dredging, clearing of structures, cleaning of the River and all the esteros and waterways that drain into it; * Submit regular reports to the Office of the President on the status of the government’s efforts on the rehabilitation and development of the Pasig River; and to * Coordinate with all government agencies and offices, including local government units. Executive Order No. 54 also abolished the Pasig River Development Council, the Presidential Task Force on Pasig River Rehabilitation and the River Rehabilitation Secretariat whose functions were transferred to the commission. On January 19, 13 days after Executive Order No. 54 was signed, an amendment was inserted giving private companies a license to coordinate with the commission concerning the rehabilitation program. In March 2008, ABS-CBN Foundation Inc. and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources through the Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission signed a memorandum of agreement to co-manage the rehabilitation of Pasig River and its tributaries. In October 2019, President Rodrigo Duterte called on Congress to abolish the commission. This was after he transferred the chairmanship of the agency from the Department of Budget and Management to the Department of Environment and Natural Resources and fired its Executive Director allegedly due to graft and corruption. The commission, earlier in May, was cited by the Commission on Audit for having low accomplishment rates in 2018 despite using up 96% of its budget. On November 2019, through Executive Order No. 93, Duterte abolished the commission and transferred its powers and functions to the Manila Bay Task Force, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, the Department of Human Settlements and Urban Development, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority and the Department of Public Works and Highways.  Structure  The commission had its headquarters in Quezon City. It was headed by the Secretary of Budget and Management as its chairperson until 2019 when it was transferred to the Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources. The chairman of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority served as co-chairman. The commission was composed of the: * Executive Secretary * Secretary of Public Works and Highways * Secretary of Budget and Management (before 2019 it was the environment secretary) * Secretary of Tourism * Secretary of Transportation * Secretary of Finance * Secretary of Trade and Industry * Secretary of National Defense * Secretary of the Interior and Local Government * Secretary of Human Settlements and Urban Development (before 2019 it was the chairperson of the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council) * Three representatives from the private sector appointed by the President The day-to-day operations of the commission was handled by the Executive Director who in turn was assisted by two Deputy Executive Directors.

It was released on July 4, 2011, on the Household Mark label. Background I a Moon was the first NSRO album to be produced in full by the group leader Craig Fortnam, who composed the music for the album during the winter of 2010/2011. The album was recorded, edited and mixed at various locations in southern England on Fortnam's laptop computer, apparently following an unsuccessful attempt to record it in the \\"live\\" manner of the two previous albums.Ben Graham, \\"Interview: North Sea Radio Orchestra\\" , The Stool Pigeon, June 22, 2011 The album reflects several changes in approach for the NSRO, with Fortnam attempting to steer the project away from its cosy reputation. He has commented, \\"I got a bit tired of reading reviews of [the NSRO's music] 'tolling through the sunlit glades' and all that. People have accused us of being twee, and if you only like The Ramones then we probably do sound fairly twee, that’s fine. But I always think it has a certain darkness that saves it from that, personally.\\" Early press releases highlighted the album's \\"darker, less pastoral sound\\", announced new influences including Krautrock and the experimental indie band Deerhoof, and revealed that the band's music would now have more emphasis on synthesizer and percussion than previously. This was the first album by the band without its choral vocal section, the North Sea Chorus. The second change of approach was a move away from the Victorian and Edwardian poetry settings of the first two albums in favour of Fortnam writing his own lyrics. Fortnam has commented that \\"I think I was slightly aware that I was removing myself a little bit [previously]. Why cut down an avenue of self-expression? I was aware of that for the first time, really.\\" This also resulted in a darker musical and lyrical tone, which Fortnam revealed \\"touches on tragic things that I’ve experienced, and that brings on more profound feelings.\\" One of the major inspirations of the work was the plight of Fortnam's friend and mentor Tim Smith, who was incapacitated by a heart attack and series of strokes in 2008. I a Moon was the first album to be released independently on Craig and Sharron Fortnam's own new label, The Household Mark. Critical reception Initial critical responses to I a Moon was positive. The Rock Club compared the album to the work of Joanna Newsom, Julianna Barwick and The Leisure Society and commented on its \\"significant charm\\". BBC Review's Gary Mulholland hailed it as \\"the world’s first baroque-Krautrock-folk-rock-Michael Nyman-madrigal-Kate Bush-electro-pop album\\" and as being \\"genuinely very beautiful.\\"Gary Mulholland, BBC Review review of I a Moon, June 28, 2011 He also commented that \\"North Sea Radio Orchestra really should be smug, boring and irrelevant. So how do they make this stuff so exciting?... The words throughout the album feel like the thoughts of someone so outside of the real world that they can hover above themselves, watching their own futile attempts to connect, like a child watching ants and pondering whether to drown them. This alienated, superior feel is contrasted by the sheer beauty of Craig Fortnam’s melodies, which have that knack of suddenly shifting to the one chord available that can make spines tingle and toes curl with pleasure. Meanwhile, the arrangements wear their classical and ancient folk influences so lightly that a track like \\"Berliner Luft\\" can find itself sounding like Neu! without need of drums nor electric guitars.\\" Track listing All music written by Craig Fortnam except where noted.

Reverse breakup fee  A reverse breakup fee is a penalty to be paid to the target company if the acquirer backs out of the deal, usually because it can’t obtain financing.

Controlling the prices that landlords could make their tenants pay formed the main element of rent regulation, and was in place from 1915 until its abolition (excluding some council houses) by the Housing Act 1988. There have been significant changes in attitudes and legislation toward the right to housing in mainland Britain. Concepts, such as rent control, 'security of tenure', statutory tenancy, regulated tenancy, fair rent, rent officer, Rent Officer Service and assured tenancy were introduced in the twentieth century, and have developed in the years since. It concerns the intervention of public law rights in private relations between landlord and tenant, and was put in place to counteract the inequality of bargaining power between landlords and tenants. 1915 to 1939 Rent control and security of tenure were first introduced on 23 December 1915 with the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (War Restrictions) Act 1915 and were intended to be temporary measures (due to expire six months after the end of the First World War) to deal with excessive increases in rents caused by the wartime housing shortage due to the cessation of building. The Act attempted to remedy this evil by restricting the right of landlords to eject their tenants and prevented them from raising the rent except for limited purposes. At the same time, in fairness to the landlords, mortgagees of houses controlled by the Act were prevented from increasing the rate of interest and restricted in their rights to enforce the security. This was the first comprehensive European enactment controlling rent; since then many other Acts have been passed in Great Britain, and of course, in other European countries. Before the 1915 Act, the relationship between landlord and tenant had been purely contractual; at the expiration or termination of the contract, the landlord could recover possession. =Scope of control= The new form of control was relatively simple and inflexible. The Act applied to separate dwellings with rateable values or standard rents not exceeding £35 in London, £30 in Scotland and £26 elsewhere. Specifically excluded were: *dwellings let with land other than a garden or let with other premises; *lettings at a rent of less than two-thirds the rateable value; *lettings where the rent included payment for board, attendance or furniture. Standard rent The controlled rent was known as the standard rent. It was the rent of a letting on 3 August 1914; or, where there was no letting on that date, the rent the dwelling had last been let for before that date; or, in the case of a first letting after 3 August 1914, the rent at which it was first let. Security of tenure Under the provisions of the Act, a tenant who paid the rent and observed other conditions of the tenancy, could only be evicted if the landlord could satisfy the Courts on certain grounds specified in the Act. These were: * that the tenant had committed waste or caused nuisance or annoyance to neighbours; or, * that the premises were reasonably required by the landlord for his own occupation, or that of an employee. In addition, the Courts could grant possession on any other ground it considered satisfactory. Premiums After 25 November 1915, premiums were not allowed to be paid by a tenant on the grant, renewal or continuance of any tenancy. Any amount paid was recoverable unless it was made payable by an agreement entered into before 4 August 1914. (Leases for 21 years or more were later excluded by the Courts (Emergency Powers) Act 1917). Rates The Statement of Rates Act 1919 required any owner in England and Wales who received rent that included rates to show the amount in the rent book. The equivalent Scottish Act is the House Letting and Rating (Scotland) Act 1920. Further extensions and amendments to the 1915 Act were made by the Acts of 1917, 1918 and two in 1919. Control was exempted from houses built alter 2 April 1919 or in process of construction at that date. Rent control and security of tenure hardly proved to be such temporary measures as had been originally intended. =Full control 1920 - 1923= Following the report of the Salisbury Committee into the continuing deterioration in the housing supply, the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act 1920 was passed, which consolidated and amended the earlier legislation. Most of the provisions were intended to be for a period of three years but they were successively extended and amended. Any remaining provisions were repealed and consolidated by the Rent Act 1968 and in Scotland by the Rent (Scotland) Act 1971. The 1920 Act is still the foundation of the modern law; most concepts of the Rent Acts are derived from it. It is suggested as a first source of reference for any original concepts which are not included in this brief summary. Scope of control The standard rent and rateable value limits were increased to £105 in London, £90 in Scotland and £78 elsewhere, and so applied to the great majority of let houses in the country. The concept of \\"statutory tenant\\" was introduced in this Act. Premises used for business, trade or professional purposes, or for the public service were brought within the Act for one year (with slightly different percentage increases to those outlined below for dwellings). New dwellings continued to be excluded from control. The 1920 Act did not apply to houses erected, or in the course of erection, on 2 April 1919, nor to those that at that date or later were being reconstructed into two or more separate and self-contained flats or tenements. A measure of control was introduced for the first time to a furnished letting of a dwelling covered by the Act. This control related to abnormal or excessive profits. In the latter case, the landlord was liable to a fine of up to £100. Standard rent The Act allowed increases in rent of up to 40% and in mortgage interest of 1% (up to a maximum of six and one half per cent). The 40% was made up of two elements. An increase of 15% was allowed, to compensate the landlord for the fall in the value of money during the Great War. A further increase in rent of 25% was allowed to cover expenditure on repairs where the landlord did the repairs. This latter increase could not be levied on tenants of unfit dwellings or dwellings in disrepair. In fact, it could be levied but the tenant (or the sanitary authority) could go to court to have it suspended until the repairs had been carried out. Increases were also permitted, as a percentage of the relevant expenditure, following improvement or structural alteration. A tenant of a furnished dwelling was able to go to the county court (in Scotland the Sheriff Court) for an order to freeze the rent at a specified level and for repayment of any rent already paid in excess of that level. Premiums The Act now made it a penal offence, liable to a fine of £100, to require a premium, but reduced the length of excluded tenancies from 21 years or more to 14 years or more. Security of tenure Distress (in Scotland \\"diligence\\") could only be levied with consent of the court. Possession could be recovered if the court saw fit on a certain number of grounds, which were widened. The court lost its powers to grant possession on some unspecified but less satisfactory grounds. Succession There was a right of succession by the tenant's widow if she was residing with him at his death or a member of the tenant's family who had been residing with the tenant at the time of his death. A requirement for six months' residence except for a widow was introduced by the 1933 Act. =Gradual decontrol 1923 - 1933= Following the report of the Onslow Committee, the Rent and Mortgage Interest Restrictions Act 1923 became the first measure to reverse the machinery of control. Scope of decontrol Premises came out of protection when tenants died or moved away. Sitting tenants remained controlled. The Acts ceased to apply to premises for which a lease or tenancy of not less than two years' duration was granted to a sitting tenant. It extended the grounds for recovery of possession. Furnished tenancies As has been said earlier, the 1915 Act had disapplied the Act where board, attendance, or furniture was provided. The 1923 Act now quantified the amount of attendance or provided furniture so that only substantial provision in rental terms would take the letting out of control. In other words, the value of attendance (personal services provided to the tenant) or the value of the furniture had to form a substantial part of the rental value. Subsequent legislation made minor amendments to previous enactments, and the Expiring Laws Continuance Acts 1927-1932 ensured continuity of the Rent Acts until 1933. Gradual decontrol 1933 The recommendations of the Marley Committee in 1931 were implemented in the Rent and Mortgage Interest Restrictions (Amendment) Act 1933. They had reported that the gradual decontrol inaugurated by the 1923 Act had worked satisfactorily with regard to the medium-sized houses, but too slowly to the largest and too quickly to the smallest. So the 1933 Act divided the dwellings the Acts applied to into three categories. = Scope of decontrol = The larger houses became decontrolled where both the annual recoverable rent and the rateable value exceeded £45 in London and Scotland and £35 elsewhere. The middle group comprised all existing controlled houses where the rateable value exceeded £20 in London £25 and 5 shillings in Scotland and £13 elsewhere. These became subject to decontrol by the 1923 Act when the landlord obtained vacant possession or granted a new minimum period two-year lease or tenancy. The remaining controlled houses, the smallest houses, were those with rateable values not exceeding £20/£25.25/£13 as above. These could not become decontrolled piecemeal but were to remain controlled until the Rent Acts expired. If a house within these rateable value limits had become decontrolled under the 1923 Act it was not automatically brought back into control by the 1933 Act. It could remain decontrolled provided the landlord registered it as decontrolled within three months of the enactment of the 1933 Act. Rents could be increased by a percentage of the relevant expenditure to reflect the provision of additional or improved fixtures or fittings made after enactment of the 1933 Act. A tenant of a dwelling that had become decontrolled by this Act had to be served one month's notice that the possession would be required on the date specified in the notice unless a new tenancy had been negotiated before the notice ran out. Succession As has been mentioned above, the right of succession granted in the 1920 Act now required six months' residence except for a widow. A widower could also succeed to the tenancy as a member of his deceased wife's family provided that the six months' test was satisfied. Suitable alternative accommodation The Act also added new grounds for recovery of possession by a landlord (e.g. suitable alternative accommodation being available now became a sufficient ground for the recovery of possession). A second attempt (the first had been made in the 1919 Amendment Act) was made to prevent a tenant from charging an excessive rent on sub-letting part of the premises. Matters were certainly becoming more complicated. =More decontrol 1938= After yet another report, this one by Viscount Ridley's Committee, the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act 1938 was introduced. Scope of decontrol The 1938 Act automatically decontrolled all the more valuable houses in the middle value band (i.e., houses that exceeded £35 in London and Scotland and £20 elsewhere) and prevented any further creeping decontrol (introduced by the 1923 Act) of the lower range of houses in the middle-value band). The 1938 Act did not reintroduce control of a house in the middle-value band that the 1933 Act had decontrolled, but the landlord had to get it registered as decontrolled within three months. Failure on the part of the landlord to meet the three-month deadline meant that the houses were deemed to be still controlled, unless the courts excused his failure to do so within one year from the passing of the Act. For the first time, in defining the application of the Act, there was no reference to rent limits. Because rateable values were now the sole criterion for the continued applicability of the Acts, the result was decontrol of a large number of houses where the recoverable rent would have kept them in control. 1939 to 1945 =Full control again 1939 - 1945= Just when it must have seemed that the end of control was in sight, the threat of war revived fears of the excessive rent increases that led to the initial introduction of control in 1915, the Rent and Mortgage Interest Restrictions Act 1939 was introduced. =Scope of control= All dwellings not already subject to control, and with rateable values that did not exceed £100 in London, £90 in Scotland and £75 elsewhere were brought back into control. It also brought to an end the creeping decontrol under the 1933 Act (whereby the landlord had been able to obtain vacant possession or decontrol had come about by the grant of a two-year lease or tenancy). The form of control introduced for the newly controlled dwellings differed from that previously in existence and they became \\"new control\\" and \\"old control\\" respectively. The distinction is no longer of importance, now that \\"control\\" has been replaced by \\"regulation\\". For the first time local authority dwellings were excluded from control. Like its First World War predecessor, the Second World War legislation was only intended to continue in force \\"the principal Acts\\" until six months after the emergency ended. These were the Rent And Mortgage Interest Restrictions Acts 1920 - 1938 and were due to expire in 1942. The Order in Council that should have declared the end of the emergency was never made, and the Acts, as amended, continued in force until 1968 (1971 in Scotland). 1945 to 1957 =The post-war period= In the aftermath of wartime bomb damage, shortage of materials and building restrictions, the increased demand for homes from those returning from the conflict resulted in housing shortages that continued into the next decade. No attempt was made to introduce any form of rent decontrol. The Building Materials and Housing Act 1945, which was passed on 20 December 1945, limited selling and letting prices for certain houses. The Act increased the amount of loan Treasury could raise under the Housing (Temporary Accommodation) Act 1944 to £200M. Local authorities were enabled to grant loans to acquire or construct homes costing up to £1,500 each. Permitted Rent A house or a flat constructed under building licence under the Defence Regulations made under the Emergency Powers (Defence) Acts 1939-1945 could be subject to a condition limiting the price for sale or rent (the \\"permitted rent\\"). The 1945 Act imposed a time limit of four years (subsequently raised in 1949 to eight years) during which a breach of the limit rendered the transgressor liable to a fine up to the aggregate of:- a) the financial gain from the offence; b) a fine of £l00; or c) imprisonment for up to three months, or to both a fine and imprisonment. Furnished lettings A second committee set up in 1943 under Viscount Ridley to review the working of the rent restriction Acts formed a very favourable opinion of the Rent of Furnished Houses Control (Scotland) Act 1943 and recommended that England and Wales should follow suit. The Furnished Houses (Rent Control) Act 1946 established a separate system of protection—modelled on Scottish legislation that involved rent tribunals setting reasonable rents—for contracts referred to them for furnished lettings. Previously these had not been subject to any effective control under the Rent Acts. Scope of Control Initially, the 1943 and 1946 Acts applied, irrespective of the dwelling's rateable value or the rent. ln England and Wales, local authorities were required to keep registers of the rents so determined (registers were maintained by the tribunals themselves in Scotland). This system was quite separate from the general rules as to control under the principal Acts. Furniture The rent had to include payment for the use of furniture or for services (which included attendance and any other privilege such as the right to a cycle storage space). The provision of board (but only if it formed a substantial part of the rent) took the letting outside the jurisdiction of the Rent Tribunal. Both the 1943 and 1946 Acts were temporary measures but were continued in force by successive Expiring Laws Continuation Acts. In 1974 the 1946 Act principles were re-deployed as the method of protecting the tenants of resident landlords. Both survive in the Rent Act 1977 and the Rent Act (Scotland) Act 1984. Reasonable rents The Landlord and Tenant (Rent Control) Act 1949 cured a number of defects in earlier Acts and empowered rent tribunals to determine, upon application to them by either the landlord or the tenant, a reasonable rent for any dwelling-house to which the Rent Acts applied, which was first let after 1 September 1939. The rent so determined became the standard rent. Security of tenure This Act gave rent tribunals the power to suspend the operation of a notice to quit for a successive periods of up to three months at a time. It also debarred an application to a rent tribunal for an extension of security of tenure for a furnished letting where the tribunal, on an earlier reference, had given less than the maximum statutory period of security. Premiums The 1949 Act also extended to all tenancies of dwelling-houses to which the Rent Acts applied, the penalties relating to the payment of premiums, and hidden premiums in consideration of leases of up to fourteen years Shared Accommodation It applied the provisions of the 1943 and 1946 Acts to contracts, for both furnished and unfurnished lettings, under which the tenant shared some living accommodation with the landlord. Where the tenant shared some living accommodation with persons other than the landlord, it applied the Rent Acts to the contract. =1951 to 1956= The Reserve and Auxiliary Forces (Protection of Civil Interests) Act 1951 conferred on servicemen the same protection as that provided under the Rent Acts in cases where their tenancies were not already within those Acts. Incidentally, this Act has been amended on several successive occasions whenever there has been an amendment to the protection given by the Rent Acts to ensure that servicemen would have a rented home to return to. The Crown Lessees (Protection of Sub-Tenants) Act 1952 brought within the Rent Acts tenants, lessees and mortgagors of Crown property, except where the Crown was the immediate landlord, lessor or mortgagee. The Accommodation Agencies Act 1953 prohibited the taking of money from a prospective tenant simply by registering his name and requirements and prevented the making of charges simply for supplying the addresses of accommodation available to let. Local authorities in England and Wales were given power to prosecute in the magistrates' court. The Housing Repairs and Rents Act 1954 sought to encourage landlords to repair controlled houses by allowing a \\"repairs increase\\" in the rent for houses brought into. and maintained in, good repair. It also sought to encourage the building and conversion of houses for letting to tenants by excluding from control all dwelling-houses built after 30 August 1954 and all separate, self-contained dwellings produced by conversion after that date, except in cases that had attracted improvement grants. Rent tribunals were empowered to fix, upon application, an appropriate increase in the rent for increases in the cost of providing services in pre 1939 Act controlled tenancies. All tenancies owned by local authorities, development corporations and housing associations and trusts were excluded from the application of the Rent Acts. The passing on to the tenant of rates increases and limited increases in rent attributable to improvements or structural alterations carried out by the landlord to a dwelling had been permitted since the inception of the Rent Acts. The 1954 Act permitted specified increases for dwelling-houses that were kept in good repair by the landlord, but limited the total rent recoverable to twice the gross value of the dwelling-house. It removed the ban on premiums in the case of the assignment of leases granted for periods exceeding 21 years, it relaxed the rules if a premium was paid on the grant, continuance, renewal or assignment of a tenancy if it consisted of reasonable expenditure on alterations or improvements, or a reasonable amount for goodwill. Extension and release Part l of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 extended Rent Act protection to tenants under long leases at low rents, and to the sub-tenants of tenants under such leases, by providing a procedure that converted those tenants into statutory tenants on the expiry of their tenancies. The Requisitioned Houses and Housing (Amendment) Act 1955 released from requisition those houses where the licensed occupier was accepted by the owner as a statutory tenant. The owner of the house was compensated for giving up the right to possession. Passed only after several particularly severe smoke-polluted fogs (called \\"smog\\") in London and the industrial towns had caused health problems, the Clean Air Act 1956 (which applied north and south of the border) reimbursed expenditure spent on the adaptation of fireplaces to burn smokeless fuel. The work counted as an improvement for rent increase purposes under the Rent Act 1957. Eight percent of the cost (net of any reimbursement) could be added to the rent. Decontrol 1957 to 1965 The new Conservative government passed the Rent Act 1957 which decontrolled all the more valuable houses and reintroduced a system of gradual decontrol in a revised form. lt also transformed the method of fixing the maximum rent payable by tenants by introducing a formula based upon rateable value. Coming into effect on 6 July, the 1957 Act immediately decontrolled all dwelling houses and all contracts for furnished lettings of dwelling houses, with rateable values on 7 November 1956 exceeding £40 in the Metropolitan Police District or the City of London and Scotland, and £30 elsewhere in England and Wales; and tenancies granted for a period exceeding 21 years. No new tenancies were to be subject to control, whatever the rateable value of the premises, unless granted to a tenant who was immediately before its creation a controlled tenant of the same premises or premises that included them. Premiums and payments of rent in advance were forbidden to be charged to tenants of premises that had become decontrolled by the Act for a period of three years from the commencement of the Act. A minimum of four weeks' notice to quit was introduced and the Act enabled the exchange of controlled tenancies by agreement of all parties concerned, without loss of security or rent control, The Act used the word \\"exchange\\" although \\"transfer\\" would have been more apt. The \\"standard rent\\" was replaced with a new \\"rent limit\\" calculated by multiplying the 1956 Gross Value by a factor determined according to the repairing liabilities of the parties. For instance, where the landlord was responsible for all repairs and external decoration, (the tenant being responsible for internal decoration only) the 1956 Gross Value would be multiplied by two to produce the annual rent limit. Other multipliers were to be used for different repairing and decorating liabilities. The \\"rent limit\\" could be increased for rates borne by the landlord and by a reasonable charge for the provision of any furniture or services. The limit was subject to periodic adjustment to take account of changes in the amount of the rates, changes in the provision of furniture or services and for improvements. It could be reduced when the dwelling became in disrepair. Eight per cent of the net cost of any improvement (i.e. after deducting the amount of any grant received by the landlord) for works completed after 5 July 1957 could be added to the rent. The Act gave the Minister power for future rent control by order requiring the affirmative resolution of each House of Parliament. In the late 1950s and early 1960s there were many newspaper reports of landlords victimising their (controlled) tenants to force them out of their homes. The new word \\"Rachmanism\\" (after Peter Rachman, a property owner who was alleged to be responsible for many of these cruel activities) was introduced into the language. =Suspension of possession orders= The Landlord and Tenant (Temporary Provisions) Act 1958 prohibited the recovery of possession except by legal proceedings of certain dwelling houses released from control by Section 11(1) of the Rent Act 1957. It also suspended for a limited period the execution of any order made for possession for those still remaining in their homes on 1 August 1958, by postponing the effect of any earlier order for possession. lt regulated the rent payable pending recovery of possession (to twice the 1956 gross value, plus rates, and for services and furniture unless the contractual rent previously payable was higher). It made it an offence to recover possession other than by proceedings in court and to withhold services or furniture to which the tenant was entitled. Certain grounds were provided whereby a landlord could try to satisfy the court that an order for possession should subsequently be granted. =Excessive payments for furniture= The Landlord and Tenant (Furniture and Fittings) Act 1959, which came into force on 29 July 1959 prohibited landlords from requiring excessive payments for furniture, fittings, and other articles as a condition of the grant, renewal, continuance, or assignment of tenancies of dwellings. Such payments were an attempt to find a way round the prohibition to require a premium in the Landlord and Tenant (Rent Control) Act 1949. =Powers of inspection= Offenders attempting to obtain from prospective tenants excessive amounts for furniture and fittings were liable to be punished by a fine not exceeding £100. Local authorities were given powers to inspect dwellings where they suspected an offence had been committed. Private street works made under the Highways Act 1959, which updated earlier provisions in the Public Health Act 1875 and the Private Streets Works Act 1892 counted as improvements. Their net cost were included in the calculation of rent increases. =Repairing liabilities in short leases= The effect of the neglect of repairing liabilities during and after the Second World War faced many tenants on short leases with huge bills for dilapidations to make good dwellings which had been originally let in a poor state of repair. Such tenants did not at that time have sufficient security of tenure to enable them to reap the benefit from carrying out major repairs. Under the Housing Act 1961 (see particularly sections 32 and 33) where a tenancy of a dwelling house for less than seven years was granted after 24 October 1961, the landlord was required by an implied covenant to keep in repair the structure and interior (including drains, gutters and external pipes) and to keep in repair and proper working order the installations in the house for the supply of water, gas and electricity, for sanitation, and for space heating and heating water. This applied whatever the rent or the rateable value. The Act included a provision to prohibit the backdating of a lease. The term of years counted from the date of lease signing. The 1961 Act increased the percentage addition to the rent for the net cost of improvement works carried out after 24 November 1961, from eight per cent (as it had been in the Rent Act 1957) to twelve and one half per cent. =Weekly rent books= The Landlord and Tenant Act 1962 required landlords to provide rent books for tenancies when rent was payable weekly (except where board represented a substantial part of the rent). This Act had a more general application than the 1938 Act, and consolidated certain requirements from the 1933 Act and the 1957 Act. Information to include was prescribed, and the tenant was given the right to obtain information, particularly when the landlord was a company. The penalty for an offence was a fine not exceeding £50 (or £100 for a second conviction). The Housing Act 1964 set up the Housing Corporation to assist housing associations to provide housing accommodation in England, Wales and Scotland. It authorised the Scottish Special Housing Association to act on behalf of the Housing Corporation in Scotland. =Standard amenities and grants= The 1964 Act conferred on local authorities the duty to compel the improvement of dwellings that were without standard amenities and amended improvement grant legislation to provide improvement grants and standard grants. The standard amenities were: * a fixed bath or shower in a bathroom with a supply of hot and cold water; * a wash hand basin with a supply of hot and cold water; * a hot and cold water supply to a sink; * a water closet; and * satisfactory facilities for storing food. =Protection from eviction= The Protection from Eviction Act 1964 of 17 December 1964 was an interim measure intended to run to the end of 1965 and then expire. This to give time for an overhaul of the legislation. It restricted the eviction of residential occupiers from their homes. Widows and widowers and members of the family living with the residential occupier at the date of death were also covered. Agricultural service occupiers were treated as tenants for 1964 Act purposes. It became unlawful to evict other than by proceedings in the county court or to withdraw or withhold services or furniture. On summary conviction, the offender was liable to a fine of £100 or six months' imprisonment, or both. These new offences of illegal eviction and harassment were soon to be absorbed into the Rent Act 1965 and eventually to be transferred into the Protection from Eviction Act 1977. The courts could suspend recent possession orders, could suspend the execution of an order for possession for up to twelve months and could impose certain conditions and terms. There were a few exceptions (e.g., tenancies the following Acts applied to: Small Landholders (Scotland) Acts 1886-1931, Tenancy of Shops (Scotland) Act 1949, Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 1949, Crofters (Scotland) Acts 1955-1961). Nothing affected the operation of the Small Tenements Recovery Act 1838 (which included brothels and premises acquired for defence purposes) or the Pluralities Act 1838 or the Lecturers and Parish Clerks Act 1844 (ecclesiastical property). It postponed until the end of March 1966 the decontrol of dwellings requisitioned during the war. Rent Regulation 1965 to 1989 =A new rent system 1965 to 1971= The Labour Government elected in 1964 had pledged to repeal the 1957 Rent Act. lt was clearly impossible to re- impose rent control in a simple way. A Committee on Housing in Greater London under the chairmanship of Sir Milner Holland, QC, reported in March 1965. They found that there was \\"an acute shortage of rented housing in London and many difficulties and hardships arising from it\\". This was not a situation peculiar to London. They observed that neither rigid control nor piecemeal and haphazard decontrol could relieve the situation and that any new system of control (or regulation) should provide that rents in future should be subject to periodic review. In this situation and in these circumstances came a new piece of legislation that was a major turning point. Richard Crossman, Lord Goodman, who became President of the Institute of Rent Officers and others claimed paternity rights. The Rent Act 1965 introduced the Rent Officer Service. The Ministry of Housing and Local Government, which later became part of the Department of the Environment, and then Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, was responsible for setting up the administrative arrangements and the appointment of the first Rent Officers, in England and Wales. Appointments were made by the \\"proper officer\\" a designated official in each local authority (usually the chief executive or senior legal executive of the county council or of each London borough who was responsible for providing accommodation, for supervision and disciplinary matters. The service was funded from central government by grant claims. In practice these matters were delegated to a Senior Rent Officer in each of the seventy-seven original registration area offices. Decisions made by individual Rent Officers were considered as to be made independently. The system was devised so that Rent Officer's decisions could not be influenced by local or central government. Administrative staff were appointed who were employed by the local authority. The first Rent Officer appointments were made in the City of Westminster where Rent Officers appointed in other registration areas were trained. Early appointments were made from the legal profession, from the Inland Revenue valuation office, former estate agents, property managers, and retired ex- military and retired ex-policemen. The first rent registration was made on a flat above a fishmongers shop in Paddington Street, Marylebone, London W1. The Institute of Rent Officers (IRO) was formed to promote a professional approach and to carry out education and training. The Journal of the Institute of Rent Officers JIRO was published quarterly to encourage discussion of procedures, valuation practice and to provide information about new legislation and \\"case law\\" arising from legal decisions in the Courts relating to landlord and tenant matters. The Educational Trust of the Institute of Rent Officers published guides and a brown-coloured Manual of Rent Regulation which provided practitioners with annotated amendments as complete reprinted pages to residential landlord and tenant legislation in loose-leaf form. This important and prompt updating service incorporated the many amendments noted in this guide. The brown manual could often be seen on the bench of high court judges and in the hands of solicitors and barristers representing landlords and tenants in the courts. =Scope of regulation= The 1965 Act brought within protection most houses that were decontrolled by the 1957 Act, and newer houses that had never been controlled (i.e., newly erected or produced by conversion after 30 August 1954). It gave security to tenancies of most dwelling houses with rateable values of up to £400 in Greater London and £200 elsewhere not already controlled. The 1965 Act cleverly began by stating that a tenancy under which a dwelling house (which could be a house or part of a house) was let as a separate dwelling was a protected tenancy. There were certain exceptions (which were modified and added to in subsequent legislation). References are those in Part I of the later consolidated Rent Act 1977: *Section 4 Dwelling-houses above certain rateable values *Section 5 Tenancies at low rents *Section 5A Certain shared ownership leases *Section 6 Dwelling-houses let with land other than the site of the house *Section 7 Dwelling-houses bona-fide let at a rent that includes board (a meal or meals)and/or attendance (services personal to the tenant) where the value to the tenant forms a substantial part of the rent *Section 8 Lettings to students pursuing a course of studies *Section 9 Where a dwelling-house was let for the purpose of a holiday *Section 10 Agricultural tenancies *Section 11 Licensed premises *Section 12 Where the landlord was resident in the same house *Section 13 Where the interest of the landlord belonged to Her Majesty in the right of the Crown *Section 14 Local authority tenancies *Section 15 Housing association tenancies *Section 16 Housing co-operative tenancies *Section 22 Tenants sharing accommodation with persons other than the landlord *Section 24 Premises with a business use The Rent Act 1965 introduced three major innovations. Firstly, except for furnished lettings, it was the first time that a new long-term flexible approach had been brought to the old problem of rent control. It substituted the rent-fixing formula of earlier legislation with independent rent regulation by Rent Officers. This introduced the normal valuation principles into the assessment of a fair rent (section 68 in the Rent Act 1965 and Section 70 in the consolidated Rent Act 1977) by requiring that regard should specifically be had to the age, character, locality and state of repair of the dwelling. Personal circumstances were to be disregarded as were improvements carried out voluntarily by, and any disrepair or defects attributable to, the tenant or a predecessor in title. A most fundamental concept was introduced whereby it had to be assumed that the number of persons seeking to become tenants of similar dwelling houses in the locality on the terms (other than those relating to rent) of the regulated tenancy was not substantially greater than the number of such dwelling-houses in the locality that were available for letting on such terms. This requirement to assume a roughly balanced market was described by commentators as the \\"scarcity factor\\", (words that did not appear in the Act). There was an automatic rent review (but only if applied for) at three-yearly intervals (reduced to two-yearly intervals in the 1980 Housing Act). Secondly, it instituted rent registration, schemes for the appointment of Rent Officers and a nationwide Rent Officer Service. Rent Officers were required, in accordance with specified procedures, upon application to determine and register fair rents. Objections to the rents determined by Rent Officers by either landlords or tenants were to be passed to a network of rent assessment committees with appellate jurisdiction. Rent Officers appointed as \\"statutory officers\\" therefore had a quasi-judicial function. As a tribunal of first instance they had the same duty as the former furnished rent tribunals to determine their own jurisdiction to act upon an application. Appeals against such decisions as to jurisdiction were to be considered by the County Court. Thirdly, the Act made it an offence for any person unlawfully (i.e. without a court order) to evict a tenant or to harass with the intention of persuading the tenant to move out or to forego any rights in respect of the premises. The offences applied irrespective of the dwelling's rateable value and service occupiers and other licensees whose licence was still in existence were also protected. The percentage increase of the net cost to be added to the rent for improvements carried out after 8 December 1965 and after the rent had been agreed, was twelve and one half per cent. The right of succession to a statutory tenancy was extended to enable the tenancy to be transmitted to a second successor on the same rules applicable to the transmission on the death of the original tenant or of the first successor. The 1965 Act also raised to £400 in Greater London and £200 elsewhere the rateable value limits of furnished houses within the jurisdiction of rent tribunals and extended the maximum period by which they could delay the operation of a notice to quit to six months. The presidents of rent assessment panels in England and Wales were empowered to make appointments to Rent Tribunals in their areas. The 1965 Act provided for the conversion of statutory tenancies subsisting under the provisions of the Requisitioned Houses and Housing (Amendment) Act 1955 by extending its time limit for this purpose. This finally tidied up one of the remaining consequences of the wartime emergency. The Airports Authority Act 1965 added the net cost of soundproofing works to the list of improvements that could increase rents. The Agriculture Act 1967 contained provisions relating to the letting and recovery of farm houses that became redundant following the amalgamation of farms under that Act. The Leasehold Reform Act 1967 brought back into the Acts long tenancies (a tenancy granted for a term of years certain exceeding twenty-one years) (other than those at a low rent), but unintentionally applied to them the Rent Act inhibitions upon premiums. The Caravan Sites Act 1968 made it unlawful, without the sanction of the courts, to deprive a person who occupied a caravan as a residence, whether owned or rented, on a caravan pitch that was protected (one that required a site licence under the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act of 1960). The 1968 Act gave courts the power to suspend possession orders up to twelve months and protected caravan occupiers against harassment. Local authorities had power to prosecute. Harassment and illegal eviction was punishable by a fine of £100 for the first offence and £500 and six months imprisonment (or both) for a second offence. With the exception of section 16 of the 1957 Act (notices to quit) and Part III of the 1965 Act (illegal eviction and harassment), the Rent Act 1968 consolidated all the earlier Rent Acts; the Furnished Houses (Rent Control) Act 1946, the Landlord and Tenant (Rent Control) Act 1949, Part II of the Housing Repairs and Rents Act 1954 and other related enactments (some twenty-four in all), without rationalising or simplifying them. The 1965 Act had previously provided the power by Ministerial Order for the progressive conversion of existing controlled tenancies to regulated tenancies. This power was never exercised and the Housing Act 1969 introduced a phased programme of conversion, determined by rateable values, and the qualification certificate procedure outlined below, for those controlled tenancies in good repair and equipped with standard amenities. Grants became available to provide dwellings by conversion or for improvements of existing dwellings and there were special grants for houses in multiple occupation. Grants to provide standard amenities were specified (e.g. £30 for a bath or shower; £50 for a water closet and £30 for a hot and cold water supply at a sink) The term \\"improvements\\" included the replacement of an existing fixture or fitting. Qualification certificates could be issued by a local authority for premises that had all the standard amenities and were in good repair. A certificate of fair rent issued by the Rent Officer stated what the fair rent would be once any missing standard amenities had been provided. A fair rent could then be determined (the application was supported by the certificate of fair rent) but the increase in rent was phased over a period of four years (two years if the work had been aided by an improvement grant). Amount attributable to services Rent Officers had previously informally shown an amount for the value of services on the register. The 1969 Act required there to be a note on the rent register of the amount attributable to the provision of services (but not if the charge for the services was variable). A note was now also required of the increase over the amount for services in the previous rent (which could be calculated by apportionment if necessary). This amount affected the phasing calculation. The Act introduced a new definition of a house in multiple occupation (HMO) and provided for registers and orders applying a management code. Powers were given to local authorities to close an HMO (or part of it) if it was not possible to provide a fire escape. It introduced the possibility of control orders to be followed by compulsory purchase orders. Directions were made to avoid or reduce overcrowding. In determining whether a long tenancy was a tenancy at a low rent, the sums payable by the tenant in respect of rates, services, repairs, maintenance or insurance now had to be disregarded. The Act removed most of the unintended consequences of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 in respect of premiums and the price to be paid for enfranchisement. Increased rents registered between 10 July 1968 and 31 December 1969 were liable to phasing under the Prices and Incomes Regulations 1968 (which only applied until the end of 1969). When those regulations expired, the Rent (Control of Increases) Act 1969 (which only applied to the end of 1971) introduced phasing of rent increases generally speaking over three equal annual increments. Improvements to the security of tenure available to occupants of agricultural tied cottages were made by the Agricultural Act of 1970. It amended Section 33 of the Rent Act 1965 to ensure that, subject to conditions, the tenant of a tied cottage, or his widow, would automatically get at least six months' security of tenure alter the employment ended. This Act extended the provisions of the Agriculture Act 1967 to Q redundant farm houses and not only just those redundant due to amalgamation of farms under the 1967 Act. The Fire Precautions Act 1971 made amendments to the Rent Act 1968 and arrangements to amend the Rent (Scotland) Act 1971. Where a dwelling was subject to a controlled or a regulated tenancy and the dwelling was issued with a fire certificate, the amount of the expenditure (or a proportion of it approved by the county court) incurred in fire precautions work was to be considered as an improvement in an application for a certificate of fair rent. The county court could, upon application, determine an increase in the rent of controlled or regulated tenancies due to the cost of carrying out fire precaution works. =Adjustments in 1971 to 1977= A review under the chairmanship of Hugh Francis QC was commissioned in October 1969 to review the operation of rent regulation under the Rent Acts, especially in large centres of population where accommodation was scarce, and to consider the relationship between the furnished and unfurnished codes. Its conclusion, published on 2 March 1971, was that rent regulation was working well. The report made 36 recommendations, four of which were enacted in the Housing Finance Act 1972, an Act that in its time had a minor claim to fame—57 committee sittings taking 248 hours of debate in the House of Commons, which, it was suggested, justified a place in the Guinness Book of Records. The 1972 Act introduced many new concepts: *Rent rebates were to be provided for all local authority tenants. Each local authority had to introduce a model scheme. Rent allowances were to be provided for private tenants whether protected or statutory. These were to be administered by the local housing authority and details of the availability of these allowances had to be entered in rent books. Previously, rent rebates had been introduced on a discretionary basis (in Scotland by the Housing (Scotland) Act 1966), which had led to haphazard, piecemeal and inconsistent implementation. *There was also a requirement for more general publicity. Private landlords had to tell existing and new tenants about the availability of rent allowances. *Remaining controlled tenancies could be converted by stages. The conversion machinery introduced by the Housing Act 1969 had enabled controlled tenancies to be converted unto regulated tenancies where the property was in, or was improved into, the required standard. The process was speeded up by the 1972 Act, which provided for automatic conversion of all remaining controlled tenancies, whether or not they met the 1969 Act criteria, by stages (intended to be completed in two years) according to the property's rateable value. The earlier qualification certificate procedure was not being implemented as intended. Some over zealous local authorities had been misinterpreting what constituted \\"good repair\\" and it would have taken several years to complete the intended progress. *Local authorities were given powers to apply to the Rent Officer to consider whether a rent should be registered in respect of any regulated tenancy. The Rent Officer had to be satisfied that the highest rent payable under the tenancy agreement exceeded a fair rent before he could proceed to register a rent. *Landlords and tenants were given the right (subject to certain conditions) to apply, jointly, for cancellation of a registered rent. Such an application could only be entertained by a Rent Officer after the expiry of the (then) three-year registration period. The cancellation was only to be permitted of the Rent Officer considered that the agreed rent did not exceed a fair rent. *It introduced the right to apply three months before the expiry of a previously controlled tenancy for consideration of a fair rent. This enabled the standard administrative procedures to be completed in time so that the Rent Officer's decision could be expected to coincide with the expiry of the previous registration. *It unfroze the contractual rent limit, which had previously been fixed until the registration of a fair rent (some of which could have been set in 1965). *Provision was made for landlords and tenants of regulated tenancies for which no fair rent had been registered, to agree (using a special written agreement) rent increases without reference to the Rent Officer and without losing their rights to make some future application for a fair rent to be determined. But if the rent agreement was the first to take effect after the controlled tenancy had been converted into a regulated tenancy by the 1972 Act, the agreement had to be lodged with the Rent Officer who would only allow the agreement to have effect if the agreed rent did not exceed a fair rent. *Changes were made to statutory succession. Until this Act, a new tenancy granted to a first or second statutory success or had created new succession rights. From 27 August 1972, a new tenancy granted by succession to a person who was a statutory tenant by succession did not create any new succession rights. Another of the recommendations of the Francis Committee, to increase the maximum penalties for harassment and unlawful eviction, was included in the Criminal Justice Act 1972. The Housing Finance Act of 1972 also brought fundamental changes to rent legislation. It became the duty of every local authority and new town corporation to determine a fair rent (on the same basis and definition as a fair rent for regulated tenancies) for every one of their housing revenue account dwellings. This was to be done by making provisional assessments of fair rents for their properties. These assessments had to be submitted to a rent scrutiny board that could confirm them or substitute different rents. These provisions were repealed in 1976. Dwellings owned by housing associations and housing trusts (usually charities), which were registered with the Housing Corporation (but not those that were registered societies under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965) were brought within the fair rent system. From 1 January 1973, their rents were to be determined by Rent Officers and registered in a separate part of the Rent Register. New subsidies were introduced for housing associations and housing trusts registered with the Housing Corporation. For the first time, tenants were entitled to information about the cost of services provided by landlords when the cost exceeded £80. Local authorities, other public sector landlords (including housing associations) and management companies run by their tenants were excepted. A failure to provide information became a criminal offence. The Rent Assessment Committee (England and Wales) Regulations 1971 was the first of many Statutory Instruments that regulated procedures to follow when dealing with appeals against Rent Officer decisions. =Rents frozen 1972= Orders made under the Counter Inflation (Temporary Provisions) Act 1972 froze rents at their level on 6 November 1972 (as well as prices and wages) as part of the government's counter inflation measures. The freeze lasted initially for 90 days and was extended to 150 days by a later Order. Conversions from controlled to regulated tenancies (and in general, increases in rents of housing association tenancies) were postponed until the end of the standstill period. The freeze applied to all private residential tenancies including those with rateable values above the Rent Act limits. The Counter-Inflation Act 1973 imposed a further freeze from March 1974 (until March 1975 in England and Wales) (until May 1975 in Scotland). The Furnished Lettings (Rent Allowances) Act 1973 extended the rent allowance scheme to furnished lettings (those contracts within Part VI of the Rent Act 1968) and for certain housing authority furnished lettings, except where the landlord was the Crown or where substantial board was provided. =Rateable value limits 1973= Owing to the increased pressure of demand for housing resulting in increased house prices by a continuing trend during 1971 and 1972, a Conservative government used the Counter-Inflation Act 1973 to extend the scope of Rent Act protection of higher-rated accommodation on 23 March 1973. The rateable value limits were raised from £400 to £600 in London and from £200 to £400 elsewhere for those properties appearing in the 1963 valuation list. Those limits were raised to £1,500 in London and to £750 elsewhere from 1 April 1973 to take account of the revised valuation list that took effect on that date. It was estimated that this brought a further 16,000 tenancies into protection. Luxury blocks of flats with extensive porterage and services were swept into control and even in Central London only a few very large individual houses in Regent's Park were found to be outside the scope of Rent Act protection. The rateable value limits for Rent Act protection were not changed for Scotland. =Assimilation of furnished tenancies 1974= Three important Acts were passed in the next two years rather surprisingly by a Conservative administration. The Rent Act 1974 brought full protection to those existing furnished lettings where the landlord was not resident in the same premises. Previously they had had only limited protection under the 1943, 1946 and 1949 Acts. The concept of \\"resident landlord\\" was entirely new. For all new tenancies created on or after 14 August 1974, whether furnished or unfurnished, the factor to decide their protection was to be the residency or non-residency of the landlord. The Housing Act 1974 gave many private tenants the right to additional information as to the identity of their landlord, and there was also a new duty to inform a tenant of a dwelling of the assignment of a landlord's interest. It extended the right to information about service charges and introduced the right to challenge them. The form and content of certain notices to quit was to be prescribed by regulations to be made by the Secretary of State and the improvement grant system was re-vamped. Housing action areas, general improvement areas and priority neighbourhoods were introduced. Grants for the provision of standard amenities, improvements (which were compulsory in some cases) and for the repair of dwellings were introduced. The Act also extended the powers of the Housing Corporation with regard to housing associations and amended the system of providing financial assistance to them. =Phasing 1975= The Housing Rents and Subsidies Act 1975 repealed the provisions of the Housing Finance Act 1972 in relation to public sector dwellings and by and large gave local authorities a free hand in determining their rent policies. The gradual decontrol process based on rateable values was stopped, and a system of phased rent increases was introduced for all tenancies. Apart from the temporary provisions in the counter-inflation legislation in 1972 and 1973, mentioned earlier, there had been previously no phasing of increases of rent following re-registration of a fair rent. These phasing arrangements required a careful scrutiny of the cost of providing services and assessment of the value of services. The Social Security (Consequential Provisions) Act 1992 required the amount attributable to services to be noted on the Rent Register to assist the assessment of housing benefit. New amenities or improvements to a locality that were not provided at the landlords expense were to be disregarded in determination of a fair rent—and by a very late amendment, any deterioration in a locality that was not the fault of the landlord were to be disregarded. Semantics came into the valuation process. Fortunately these disregards were subsequently repealed. =Agricultural workers protected 1976= Some agricultural workers, forestry workers and members of their families had enjoyed security of occupation under the Rent Acts. The Rent (Agriculture) Act 1976 conferred on occupiers of \\"tied cottages\\" protection similar to that enjoyed by Rent Act statutory tenants. Rents became eligible for registration under the fair rent system and such decisions kept in a separate part of the Rent Register. =The great consolidation 1977= In 1977 previous legislation (except the Rent (Agriculture) Act 1976 was consolidated into the Rent Act 1977 (which embodied the \\"temporary\\" counter inflation device of phasing) and the Protection from Eviction Act 1977 (which contained special provisions in respect of agricultural workers) consolidated the provisions of previous Rent Acts (chiefly the Acts of 1957 and 1965), which protected all residential occupiers from eviction without due process of law. =Definitions= \\"Sitting tenant\\" is not used in the legislation but is in general use to mean anyone who has a tenancy protected by legislation. These are usually considered to be long term tenants. A \\"fair rent\\" is a rent registered under the Rent Act 1977. A \\"Controlled tenancy\\" is a tenancy created before 1957. A \\"Regulated tenancy\\" is one created after 1965 that is regulated now by the Rent Act 1977 and for which a rent can be registered by the Rent Officer (sometimes called a \\"Fair Rent Officer\\"). A \\"Protected tenant\\" is someone who has a tenancy protected by the Rent Acts. This can either be a \\"Contractual tenancy\\" during the term of a lease (contract) or tenancy agreement. When this contract expires the tenancy becomes a \\"Statutory tenancy\\" in which the tenant \\"holds over\\" under the protection of the statutes (Rent Acts) on the same terms as the original contract (in so far as they are not overtaken by statute). It might be obvious but it is worth just repeating that a protected tenant with security of tenure is not much use if the rent cannot be controlled. A fair rent is not much use unless the tenant has protection from eviction. =1980 to 1989= The Housing Act 1980 made various amendments to the Rent Act 1977 that changed procedures for rent registration. The rent registration review period was reduced from three to two years. The periods of phasing of increases were consequently quickened. Following the referral of a decision to a Rent Assessment Committee the two-year period was made to run from the date of their decision rather than the original effective date. Registered rents were made effective from the date of registration rather than the date of the application. In those cases when the registration was made before the expiration of the two-year period, the registration took effect from the day following the expiry of the two-year period. The Act made changes to the procedures for the need for Rent Officers to call consultations in certain circumstances. The Act also made changes to the requirements necessary before a registration could be cancelled. The original registration had to be at least two years old. The landlord alone could make an application if the premises were no longer let on a regulated tenancy. A new mandatory ground for possession (Case 20) was introduced for lettings by servicemen. Changes were made to the mandatory grounds for possession for lettings by former owner occupiers and those who own homes intended for retirement, which covered circumstances that could not have been foreseen at the time of the letting. Rent Tribunals were abolished. Their functions, except for the power to grant security of tenure, were transferred to rent assessment committees. A more limited discretion to award security of tenure (a maximum of three months) was given to the county court, as part of the possession order proceedings. Any remaining controlled tenancies were converted to regulated tenancies. New protected shorthold tenancies were created that protected during the contractual term of a short fixed-term letting. A rent had to be registered at the time the tenancy was granted or a certificate of fair rent obtained before then and a registration made within twenty-eight days of the commencement of the tenancy. This requirement was removed for all registration areas outside Greater London by the Protected Shorthold Tenancies (Rent Registration) Order 1981 and for registration areas in Greater London by a similar order in 1987. Assured tenancies were created that gave certain approved bodies the right to create assured tenancies of new dwellings outside Rent Act protection at market rents. These tenancies were subject to the provisions of Part II of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954. Additional protection was given to council tenants and many housing association tenants, who were to be known as secure tenants. Council tenants were granted the right to buy their homes. Personal representatives of deceased resident landlords were given a period of two years (instead of the one year under the 1974 Act) during which they had freedom to evict. The Act qualified the description of accommodations so that a tenancy of part of a flat in a purpose-built block occupied by a resident landlord could not be subject to a protected tenancy, an unintended effect of the wording in the Rent Act 1974. Housing Associations registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965 might now be registered with the Housing Corporation even if their objectives were to acquire, repair, improve or convert houses for eventual disposal by sale as well as by lease. Prior to the 1980 Act, housing associations had to keep their houses available for letting and were therefore prohibited from selling them. Housing associations were now enabled to build or to improve property or to put existing properties up for sale into shared ownership. Protection could now extend to previously protected tenancies—those that belonged to Her Majesty in right of the Crown, if managed by the Crown Estate Commissioners (largely in the right of the Duchy of Lancaster, tenancies that belong to the Duchy of Cornwall), statutory tenancies under the Rent (Agriculture) Act 1976 and long leaseholds at low rents (Part I Landlord and Tenant Act 1954). (Tenants of the Crown direct and of government departments (which includes tenants of a Health Service Body) remain outside protection). Shared ownership leases were not to be treated as long tenancies at a low rent for the purposes of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967. Rent Officers were asked to determine fair rents on a non-statutory basis for shared ownership properties. Initial enthusiasm was tempered when questions of some difficulty arose in the assessment of a fair rent relating to equity stakes and premiums. These were dealt with later in the Housing and Planning Act 1986. The Matrimonial Homes Act 1983 consolidated certain enactments relating to the rights of a husband or wife to occupy a dwelling house that had been a matrimonial home. Occupation by one spouse was to be treated as occupation by the other spouse. The Act provided for the transfer of certain tenancies on divorce. The Domestic Violence and Matrimonial Proceedings Act 1976 made provision for varying rights of occupation where both spouses (and a man and woman living together as man and wife) had rights in the matrimonial home. The 1976 Act and the 1983 Acts were further developed by the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984, which also gave powers to the court in relation to the transfer of certain tenancies upon a decree of divorce, of nullity of marriage or of judicial separation. The Mobile Homes Act 1983 replaced sections 1 to 6 of the Mobile Homes Act 1976. It introduced important new rules about security of tenure to owners of residential mobile home sites and to those who owned the mobile home and rented a pitch from the site owner (including local authorities but not traveller sites). It exempted those who rent the mobile home from the site owner and those who only use it for holiday purposes. It also dealt with sales and gifts of mobile homes, inheritance and change of site ownership, pitch fees, other terms of agreements and provided machinery for dealing with disputes. The Rent (Amendment) Act 1985 reversed the decision in Pocock v. Steel (1985 CA), which decided that an owner-occupier had to live in the house immediately before each and every letting to be able to obtain a mandatory order for possession. Words were inserted so that if it had \\"at any time\\" before the letting been occupied as the owner-occupier's residence, Case l l Rent Act 1977 and the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 applied. This restored the original intention that had been destroyed by redrafting in the consolidation in 1968. This Act (apart from emergency legislation) broke all speed records in its passage through the Parliamentary timetables. =Three main acts in 1985= On 30 October 1985 there was a burst of general tidying up and consolidation with the publication of four Acts. The Housing (Consequential Provisions) Act 1985 repealed 80 parts of Acts or whole Acts relating to England and Wales, 18 relating to Scotland and 4 to Northern Ireland (from the Brine Pumping (Compensation for Subsidence) Act 1891 to Acts only just passed in 1985). The Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 consolidated certain provisions relating to the law of landlord and tenant formerly found in the Housing Acts, Rent Acts and various other places. As such it created no new law. It incorporated sections as follows: * Information to be given to a tenant (e.g. landlord's identity etc.). * Provision of rent books (information to be contained and offences). * Implied terms as to fitness for human habitation. * Repairing obligations. * Reasonableness of service charges. * Leasehold Valuation Tribunals jurisdiction in certain cases to be exercisable by Rent Assessment Committees. The Housing Associations Act 1985 consolidated certain provisions of the Housing Acts relating to housing associations and made some amendments to give effect to recommendations of the Law Commission and of the Scottish Law Commission. Its main headings were: * The regulation of Housing Associations * Housing association finance * The Housing Corporation The Housing Act 1985 consolidated the Housing Acts (except the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 and the Housing Associations Act 1985) and certain related provisions, with amendments intended to implement the recommendations of the Law Commission. This mammoth initiative reduced the principal Acts relating to private lettings to the Rent Act 1977, the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 and the Housing Associations Act 1985. However, it was not to be very long before further amendments were needed. The Housing and Planning Act 1986 required that lawful premiums (paid in respect of some shared ownership leases, certain long tenancies (sl27 Rent Act I977) should be taken into account in the determination of a fair rent. Certain shared ownership leases were excluded from the operation of the Rent Act 1977, the Rent (Agriculture) Act 1976 and Part I of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967. Until the mid-1970s mortgages were largely unavailable for the purchase of flats (or large deposits were required with repayments at a high rate of interest). Large numbers of blocks of flats had been built in the 1930s usually on a leasehold basis for 99 years. Individual flats could only be sold on long leases for the remaining sixty or so years. Building societies did not consider this to be sufficient security for a mortgage. Once building societies changed their policies to offer 75% or sometimes larger mortgages at the same rates as paid for those for house purchases, landlords were able to sell flats as they became vacant on long leaseholds. Leases in older blocks with less than twenty years to run were almost impossible to sell. Landlords also began to offer long leases to sitting tenants sometimes at considerable discounts to open-market values. Now people rushed to get on the property ladder as house and flat prices rose as demand was stimulated. Investors from the Middle East after civil strife in Lebanon bought up many blocks of flats and moved to the UK. Unfortunately for the new flat owners, they inherited responsibilities in their new long leases that required them to contribute to the cost of the repair and replacement. Much of the equipment had been installed in the 1930s when the blocks built (lifts, central heating and hot water boilers, roofs and windows) which had been neglected in low rent times. Residents' associations were few and it took almost ten years before legislation was introduce to control exploitation by landlords and managing agents (whose fees calculated on the total cost of new work often at inflated cost also had to be paid by residents). The Nugee Committee Report (under the chairmanship of E. G. Nugee QC), which commenced work in February 1984, finally reported in February 1986 on the management of privately owned blocks of flats. The Landlord and Tenant Act 1987 implemented the main recommendations and contained certain other measures relating to the rights of tenants of such flats and other dwellings. Various parts of the Act came into force on dates between February 1988 and April 1989. * Certain qualifying tenants were given the right of first refusal to purchase their landlord's interest on a relevant disposal. * There was provision for the court to appoint managers to assume responsibility for the management of the premises containing flats where the landlord was in breach of any obligation owed to a tenant. * Certain qualifying tenants were given the right to acquire their landlord's interest without his consent by making application to the county court. * Any party to a long lease was given the right to make an application to the county court for an order varying the terms of the lease. * Substantial changes were made to the service charge provisions in the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985. Service charges were to be held in trust, tenants were to be given additional rights as to insurance and recognized tenants' associations were to be consulted about managing agents. * A residential tenant's right to information about the landlord was extended. The Rent (Relief from Phasing) Order 1987 removed the requirement to phase the increase in registered rents under the Rent Act I977 and for statutory tenancies under the Rent (Agriculture) Act 1976 but did not alter the phasing arrangements for housing association tenancies. They followed suit sometime later. However, increases in rent for first registrations of old decontrolled tenancies still remained subject to phasing. De-regulation 1989 =Freedom of contract= From 15 January 1989 two systems were intended to operate side by side: one under the Rent Act 1977 and the other under the Housing Act 1988 depending upon whether the tenancy commenced before or after that date. Assured Tenancies For all new tenancies, with a few exceptions, this new Act introduced: * assured periodic tenancies and provisions for the determination of their rents by rent assessment committees; * assured shorthold tenancies and provisions for the reference of excessive rents to rent assessment committees; and * assured agricultural occupancies Stronger Penalties It strengthened the penalties for harassment and unlawful eviction by a system of damages by making amendments to the Protection from Eviction Act 1977. In an obscure comer (Schedule I7 \\"Minor and consequential amendments\\") it removed the final remaining provision for the phasing of increases of rent - for housing association tenants. Succession and Other Changes The right to succession of statutory tenants was restricted, provision was made for the transfer of public sector tenancies to certain private sector landlords, Housing for Wales was established having functions relating to housing associations. The Act set up housing action trusts, made amendments to the right to buy, and provisions as to repair notices. In Schedule 2 Part I there were mandatory grounds in which a court must order possession of an assured tenancy and other grounds in Part II in which a court may order possession. The Ground 8 of Part I dealt with the amount of arrears at the date of the court hearing. The amounts were reduced in the Housing Act 1996. =Housing benefit subsidy 1988= But besides introducing changes that, in the long term, affected the future of the Rent Officer's role, the Housing Act 1988 created important new additional functions relating to the assessment of housing benefit subsidy. Previously, housing benefit had been administered by local authorities. There was strong evidence nationally of substantial fraudulent collusion between landlords and tenants when their tenants were claiming housing benefit . The resulting higher rents were also having an effect to increase open market rent levels for those not claiming housing benefit. Many millions of pounds of benefit subsidy were saved in the first year alone of Rent Officer intervention. Although Rent Officers, to cut costs, were discouraged from inspecting premises before making a valuation, inspections were made whenever resources were available and certainly where the property was unknown to them or where the amount of rent being paid seemed unreasonable for the known accommodation. Many fraudulent claims were discovered as a result of these inspections. The Secretary of State was given powers to require Rent Officers to carry out these functions by Statutory Instrument. These have proved much easier to produce and amend to promote efficient working arrangements (rather than the longer timetable required to produce Acts of Parliament). The original Order and an amendment were made in 1989. The main Order was The Rent Officers (Additional Functions) Order 1990 (S.I. 1990 No. 428), which established procedures by which a Rent Officer, upon receipt of an application from a local authority, was required to determine whether the rent payable under an assured tenancy by a housing benefit claimant, was significantly above the market rent. The availability of housing benefit was to be disregarded and an informal definition was to ask what rent someone not claiming housing benefit would be willing to pay from their own pocket for the accommodation. Tight timetables to be achieved in returning decisions (within four days or seven days where an inspection was necessary) so as not to create delays in payment of benefit during this additional process. The Rent Officer was also required to determine whether the dwelling exceeded the size criteria set out in the order, which included consideration of the size of the household and the ages of its members. If the dwelling did exceed the criteria, the Rent Officer must determine a rent that accords with the size criteria for the occupiers. There were provisions for a re-determination at the request of the local authority. The matter was to be dealt with by a maximum of two Rent Officers from adjoining registration areas who were to be advised by a Rent Officer from the original registration area (but not the person who made the original decision). Further amendments were introduced by The Rent Officer (Additional Functions) (Amendment) Orders of 1991, 1993, 1994 and 1995 amongst which there was a requirement to decide whether the rent payable was exceptionally high for the size of that accommodation in that locality. lf it was, then the Rent Officer was required to determine a market rent that was not exceptionally high for a similar sized property. When services are performed or facilities provided or rights made available to the tenant the Rent Officer was initially required to make a separate determination of that part of the rent attributable to those services. Later this was changed so that it was not required to distinguish the amounts for furniture, meals or fuel charges. =House renovation grants 1989= Grants for the repair and improvement of residential premises were amongst many other provisions in the Local Government and Housing Act 1989. These new renovation grants were also available for common parts of buildings; for the provision for facilities for the disabled; for the improvement or repair of (and conversion of houses into) houses in multiple occupation; and minor works such as thermal insulation. Local authorities were given the opportunity to seek and act upon the advice of Rent Officers about the amount of the rent payable and of any increase in the rent payable, if the premises were already let. If unlet, advice could be sought and acted upon, of the amount of rent that might reasonably be expected to be obtained when the premises were let on an assured tenancy. Amendment was made to the Housing Act 1988 to include these additional functions for Rent Officers. A Statutory instrument later established the required procedures. Local authorities were empowered to seek the advice of Rent Officers for information to facilitate the calculation of grant payable. In respect of Scotland, there were further provisions in relation to the phasing progression to the registered rent for houses let by housing associations or Scottish Homes. Long standing, low rent tenancies entered into after section 186 of the Act came into force were to become assured tenancies when those long tenancies came to an end. The Rent Officer (Additional Functions) (No.2) Order 1990 required Rent Officers to give advice (within 45 days of the application) about the rent increases which might reasonably be expected when the renovation works were completed. From 4 January 1991, The Secretary of State for Wales exercised powers conferred by the Local Government and Housing Act 1989, and extended by the Welsh Language Act 1967, to prescribe certain forms for house renovation grants that could be submitted in the Welsh language, by statutory instrument, The Housing Renovation etc. Grant (Prescribed Forms and Particulars) Welsh Forms and Particulars) Regulations 1991. There were further amendments in 1992 and 1994. =Council tax 1993= The Local Government Finance (Housing) (Consequential Amendments) Order 1993 introduced an amendment to Section 70 Rent Act 1977 so that the registered rent should take into account any sums payable by the tenant to the landlord in respect of council tax. Certain definitions were introduced by the Council Tax (Liability for Owners) Regulations 1992 and subsequently amended by statutory instrument. Ers Mehefin 10fed 1993 mae Ysgrifennydd Gwladol Cymru, wrth ymarfer pwerau o dan Ddeddf Rhentu 1997 a estynnwyd gan Ddeddf Iaith 1967 drwy Offeryn Stadudol 1993/1511, wedi gwneud rheoliadau sydd yn rhagnodi fersiynau Cymraeg o’r ffurflenni y gellir eu defnyddio yn lle fersiynau Saesneg trwy Deddf Rhentu ac yn y blaen.

On 10 June 1993, the Secretary of State for Wales in exercise of powers under the Rent Act 1977 extended by the Welsh Language Act 1967, by statutory instrument 1993/1511, made regulations that prescribed Welsh versions of the forms, which may be used in place of the English versions by the Rent Act 1977 etc.) (Welsh Forms and Particulars) Regulations 1993. =Enfranchisement 1993= The Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 amongst many other provisions conferred rights to collective enfranchisement and lease renewal on tenants of flats and enfranchisement by tenants of houses. Decisions were to be made by leasehold valuation tribunals. Provision was made for auditing the management and service charges claimed for residential property and to promote codes of good management practice. The Family Law Act 1996 (which made provision with respect to divorce and separation and legal aid in connection with mediation in disputes relating to family matters) included legislation dealing with the right of occupation of certain domestic premises and the transfer of tenancies between spouses and persons who have lived together as husband and wife. The Housing Act 1996 included provisions about the social rented sector; houses in multiple occupation; the administration of housing benefit, the conduct of tenants, the allocation of housing by local housing authorities and homelessness. A landlord may not now exercise a right of re-entry or forfeiture for failure to pay a service charge unless it has been agreed by the tenant or has been the subject of a determination by a court or appeal tribunal. New rules were made about the determination of reasonableness of service charges and the rights upon application by a tenants' association to appoint a surveyor to advise on service charges, amending the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985. The power to appoint of a manager of property was transferred from the courts to a leasehold valuation tribunal by amendments to the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987. Section 122 enabled the Secretary of State by making a statutory order (to be made by statutory instrument) to require Rent Officers to carry out specified functions in connection with housing benefit and rent allowance subsidy. It enabled a prospective landlord to apply to the Rent Officer for a determination for the purposes of any application for housing benefit made by a tenant of a dwelling that the landlord proposes to let. A local authority or a housing action trust were given the right to elect to operate an introductory tenancy regime. Introductory tenancies (and licences to occupy) were to be granted to tenants for a trial period. There were provisions for succession to introductory tenancies after the death of the tenant to the tenant's spouse or a member of his family who had resided with the tenant in the previous twelve months. Chapter III gave power to the High Court or a county court on application by a local authority to grant injunctions against anti-social behaviour and gave the power of arrest for breach of injunctions. Some of the provisions of this act came into force on Royal Assent, some two months later and some on a day in the future to be appointed by order of the Secretary of State. Some provisions additionally applied to the Isles of Scilly, Northern Island and Scotland but not all. The Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 made provision for renovation grants and other assistance for housing purposes for the improvement or repair of dwellings, houses in multiple occupation or the common parts of buildings containing one or more flats. It incorporated disabled facilities grants for the provision of facilities for a disabled person. Buildings had to be more than ten years old. There were to be grants and other assistance for regeneration and development and in connection with clearance areas, home energy efficiency schemes. Grants were to be made available to home owners where the occupiers were entitled to social benefits and home repair assistance for mobile home or houseboat owners. Rent Officers continued to give advice to local authorities as they had done previously in the administration of house renovation grants. This statutory function ceased in 2000. Maximum Fair Rent Order The Rents Act (Maximum Fair Rent) Order 1999 was introduced in Statutory Instrument 1999 No. 6 and came into force on 1 February 1999. The Rent Officer continued to determine a fair rent as previously but was then required to calculate by a formula the maximum rent payable if this was lower than the fair rent. The formula required a comparison between the retail price index at the date of the previous registration and the retail price index for the month immediately preceding the new determination of a fair rent. There was an addition of 0.075 for the first registration after this new order came into force and 0.05 for every subsequent registration. Variable service charges were not included in the calculation of the formula. The Maximum Fair Rent did not apply where there had been a change in the condition of the dwelling house of the common parts as a result of repairs or improvements carried out by the landlord if the new rent determined as a result of these repairs or improvements exceeded the previous registered rent by at least 15%. The Maximum Fair Rent was to be recalculated if the rent registered by the Rent Officer upon an application made on or after 1 February 1999, was referred to a Rent Assessment Committee. Retail Prices Index used by Rent Officers and Rent Assessment committees is the monthly United Kingdom Index of Retail Prices (for all items), which is available from the Office for National Statistics or online. The Rent Officer Service through the Institute of Rent Officers had been consulted in the past about legislative changes and procedures. Suggestions were made through annual reports most of which were eventually incorporated into legislation. One such recommendation was the creation of a nation service either as an executive agency or as a Non Departmental Public Body (NDPB). The Rent Officer Service was established as The Rent Service as an executive agency of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions on 1 October 1999. Significant opportunities for service improvements were able to be made in line with the government's modernising objectives. The Rent Service became a single, national service with local delivery, building on existing experience to secure better performance and improved customer service. The new organisation focused on faster processing of cases and consistency in valuation practice and decision making. New information technology systems were introduced and greater openness and accountability was promoted whilst maintaining impartiality in valuations. As no new protected tenancies had been created after 15 January 1989 after the Housing Act 1988 fewer applications for fair rents were received in most areas of the country except in central London. There had however been a substantial increase in housing benefit valuations, and on 1 April 2004 The Rent Service was transferred to the Department for Work and Pensions DWP), which was the government department responsible for housing benefit legislation. A major change to the valuation process for housing benefit was the Local Housing Allowance (LHA) a flat rate allowance paid to housing benefit claimants, which was introduced on 7 April 2008 as part of the welfare reform programme. It applies to private sector tenants who make a new claim for housing benefit or those claiming housing benefit who change address. It will also apply to tenants claiming housing benefit who move from the social sector into private sector accommodation. LHA is a standard allowance based on the number of bedrooms: shared room (room in a shared property); one bedroom, two bedrooms, three bedrooms, four bedrooms and five bedrooms, in an area known as a Broad Rental Market Area (BRMA). It is the median rent of private sector lettings for that size of accommodation in the BRMA. The BRMA is a geographical area where a person could reasonably be expected to live, taking into account access to facilities and services for the purpose of health, education, recreation, personal banking and shopping. The distance of travel to and from those facilities by public and private transport is taken into account and local authorities are consulted when BRMA are reviewed. BRMA boundaries do not have to match the boundaries of a local authority and often fall across more than one local authority area. The key to the success of this LHA is the regular review of the BRMA across England by the Rent Officer and the extensive development of lettings information now held by The Rent Service. BRMA decisions and LHA levels are published monthly on a new web portal. The published data includes full details and rationales for the BRMA and the list of rents gathered for each property size in that BRMA.

In Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium it regulates the direction of flagellar rotation and hence controls swimming behaviour. The switch is a complex apparatus that responds to signals transduced by the chemotaxis sensory signalling system during chemotactic behaviour. CheY, the chemotaxis response regulator, is believed to act directly on the switch to induce tumbles in the swimming pattern, but no physical interactions of CheY and switch proteins have yet been demonstrated. The switch complex comprises at least three proteins - FliG, FliM and FliN. It has been shown that FliG interacts with FliM, FliM interacts with itself, and FliM interacts with FliN. Several amino acids within the middle third of FliG appear to be strongly involved in the FliG-FliM interaction, with residues near the N- or C-termini being less important. Such clustering suggests that FliG-FliM interaction plays a central role in switching. Analysis of the FliG, FliM and FliN sequences shows that none are especially hydrophobic or appear to be integral membrane proteins. This result is consistent with other evidence suggesting that the proteins may be peripheral to the membrane, possibly mounted on the basal body M ring. FliG is present in about 25 copies per flagellum. The structure of the C-terminal domain of FliG is known, this domain functions specifically in motor rotation.

She was shot dead around 11:19 AM on 16 August 2011 by three persons who were hired by a local female interior designer in front of her house in Bhopal while she was sitting in her car and was about to leave. Crime Patrol Dial 100 aired episode 735 based on the case.Slain RTI activist Shehla Masood's last tweetsRTI activist Shehla Masood shot dead in broad daylight on way to rally for Anna Hazare Social activist Masood was an activist working primarily on wildlife conservation, and also supported other causes like good governance, RTI Act, Police reforms, environment, women's rights & issues and transparency. She sat on a fast in support of Anna Hazare's India Against Corruption campaign. She was actively involved in raising issues related to the deaths of tigers in the various sanctuaries of Madhya Pradesh. Shehla herself was working for the Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Trust, organising events for them from Srinagar to Kolkata to Delhi. She had asked for details about Narmada Samagraha, an NGO backed by the BJP Rajya Sabha MP. She was about to leave for Boat Club in Bhopal to join the anti- government protest to bring the Jan Lokpal Bill when she was killed. She co- founded RTI Anonymous, a service for whistle blowers for filing anonymous Right to Information (RTI) Applications with Indian Government departments without getting victimised, with her friends just a few days before her death.Shehla Masood: The Soldier of Truth Shehla Masood was posthumously awarded the award for her relentless effort under the category, 'Crusade Against Corruption'. Professional life She was the secretary of NGO Udai and was the CEO of a company called 'Miracles' which was involved in \\"Events and Media related services\\", according to her public Linked profile. NGO Udai was created in 2004, it recently ventured into tiger and forest conservation. Assassination Masood was constantly living under threat, as revealed by her in an interview before she was shot dead.“I Fear For My Life, But I’ll Go On” On 16 August 2011 at around 11:19 AM, she was shot by an unidentified assailant from point blank range. Masood was about to leave in her car when she was shot in the driver's seat. According to Police, the motive of the killing remains unknown. However, as per media, the possible cause could be her RTI activities and for protesting illegal diamond mining done by Rio Tinto in connivance with government officers and fighting to save tigers, leopards and forests, who were killed for their skins in connivance with forest officersCourageous Shehla met crusader’s fateMystery behind Shehla Masood's murder deepensWas Shehla shot for fighting illegal diamond mines? In an indication of the seriousness of this high-profile murder, for which no arrests were made in the initial days, the Government of Madhya Pradesh transferred the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation. The CBI called a forensic team headed by Professor T D Dogra and Rajinder Singh, Director CFSL Delhi. On 28 February 2012 Central Bureau of Investigation claims to have cracked the case and arrested a Bhopal-based interior designer Mrs Zahida Parvez and three accomplices who were hired to kill Masood. The interior designer's employee and friend who presumably had information about the murder plan was arrested on 2 March 2012. The interior designer had given the contract to Bhopal-based criminal Saqib 'Danger', known for his connections with the local BJP party in Madhya Pradesh, who further contracted it to Tabish (his cousin) based in Kanpur. The vehicle used in the getaway has been found. One of the accused arrested named Irfan had said that he did not shoot Masood but his colleague Shanu did. However, further investigation revealed when cousin of Bhopal builder Saqib 'Danger' Tabish was arrested that Shanu did not shoot Masood it was Irfan who did. Zahida and Irfan have recorded their statements in front of the CBI Magistrate. Meanwhile, the murder weapon has been found and has been sent for forensic testing. The motive behind the murder as pointed by the CBI is Zahida was obsessed and very close with a Bhopal BJP [MLA Dhruv Narayan Singh],Zahida was very disturbed with the closeness of Shehla Masood and BJP MLA. . Zahida decided to eliminate Masood. Some of the diary contents recovered by the CBI from Zahida's office reveal this motive. Nothing in support of the assumption has been found. Polygraph tests are being conducted on few accused and the MLA however results are yet to be known.Later CBI gives clean chit to BJP MLA Dhruv Narayan Singh due to lack of evidence against him.  Trial  On 28 January 2017, CBI court in Bhopal convicted four people for murder and criminal conspiracy for the murder of Masood. Another accused was pardoned because he turned approver.

The treaty formed the cornerstone of Greek–Serbian relations for a decade, remaining in force through World War I until 1924. Background During the First Balkan War, both Greek and Serbian armies concluded their operations in Macedonia by late 1912, while the Bulgarian army was directed mainly towards Thrace. As a result, the former succeeded in taking control of most of Macedonia, including its largest city, Thessaloniki, which was occupied by the Greek army in early November. Bulgaria nevertheless demanded most of Macedonia for herself, relying on the crucial role its army had played in facing the bulk of the Ottoman army in the First Balkan War, as well as on the pre-war agreements with Serbia regarding their mutual territorial claims in northern Macedonia. Both Greece, which had not signed any agreement on territorial partition, and Serbia, which in the London Conference of 1912–13 was forced by the Great Powers to cede its conquests in Albania in favour of the newly created Albanian Principality, opposed Bulgarian claims and insisted on an uti possidetis division of territory. Negotiations and signing of the alliance The Prime Ministers of Serbia and Greece, Nikola Pašić and Eleftherios Venizelos, in 1913 On 9 March 1913, the Greek Foreign Minister Lambros Koromilas instructed the Greek ambassador to Belgrade to sound out the Serbian government with a view to a bilateral alliance treaty. Preliminary discussions quickly bore fruit, and on 5 May Koromilas and the Serbian ambassador to Athens signed the first protocol, where both sides pledged mutual support against Bulgaria should the latter refuse to acknowledge the territorial status quo. The protocol also included a 50-year commercial agreement which allowed the use of Thessaloniki by Serbian companies. This protocol was then followed by a military convention signed on 13 May at Thessaloniki. The Serbian government however refused to ratify the latter, insisting that Greece take on itself the previous Bulgarian pledge to provide 200,000 troops in the case of an Austrian attack. The Greek government was reluctant to agree to this, but following the clashes between Greek and Bulgarian troops among the mutual demarcation line at Nigrita and Mount Pangaion, as well as the view of Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos that an Austro-Serbian war would soon draw the other Great Powers into the fray, it agreed. Venizelos and the Greek ambassador to Serbia, I. Alexandropoulos, leaving the Serbian Foreign Ministry The final Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Mutual Protection was signed at Thessaloniki on 1 June 1913, by the Greek ambassador to Belgrade, Ioannis Alexandropoulos, and the Serbian ambassador to Athens, Mateja Bošković. Article 1 gave a mutual guarantee of the signatories' territorial possessions, concluded a defensive alliance and precluded each government from unilaterally concluding a peace treaty. Article 2 pledged the two states to a common front in the negotiating table against Bulgaria. Article 3 delineated the Greek–Serbian border (presently the border of Greece and the Republic of Macedonia) based on the demarcation line between the respective armies. Articles 4 and 5 stated each country's territorial claims on Bulgarian- controlled territory (the line Gevgelija–Vardar River–Bregalnica–Osogovska Planina for the Serbs and Belasica–Eleftheres Gulf for the Greeks), committed them to seek international mediation, and to meet Bulgarian armed aggression towards either signatory with all available forces. The attendant military convention obliged each country to come to the other's aid with all available forces should either be attacked by a third power, or, if one of the signatories declared war first, to maintain a favourable neutrality and conduct a partial mobilization (40,000 men for Greece and 50,000 for Serbia). The signature of the Greek–Serbian alliance marked the demise of the Balkan League. On 30 June, Bulgarian troops attacked the Greek and Serbian lines, beginning the Second Balkan War. Impact and aftermath The alliance played an important role in World War I, when Serbia was attacked by Austria. Venizelos mobilized the Greek army, but met with the refusal of the Germanophile King Constantine I to enter the war on the side of the Entente Powers. In an attempt to force the king's hand, in mid-1915 Venizelos allowed a British-French force to land in Thessaloniki in order to aid the Serbs, establishing the Salonica Front. The crisis between Prime Minister and King over the issue of the country's participation in the war led to the National Schism, which plagued Greek political life until the 1930s. The Treaty of Alliance was finally unilaterally cancelled by the new Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in 1924, as a reaction to the controversial Greek- Bulgarian Politis–Kalfov Protocol on minorities.

Two ministers, Michael Eitan and Limor Livnat, were appointed as observers in the committee. * Prof. Manuel Trajtenberg – chairman of the Higher Education Planning and Budget Committee. * Eyal Gabai – director-general of the Prime Minister's Office. * Prof. Eugene Kandel – the head of the National Economic Council of the Prime Minister's Office. * Gal Hershkovitz – budget chief at the Finance Ministry. * Dr. Avi Simhon – the finance minister's senior economic adviser. * Michal Abadi-Boiangiu – the Finance Ministry's accountant general. * Shahar Cohen – social entrepreneur and NOVA (Management and Academia for the Community) academic director * Esther Dominisini – National Insurance Institute Director General * Dr. Karnit Flug – Bank of Israel deputy governor (later appointed governor) * Dr. Shlomi Frizet – Antitrust Authority chief economist * Dr. Yoram Gabbay – Chairman of Capital Market Activists and Deputy Chairman of the Hebrew University Maurice Falk Institute for Economic Research in Israel. * Prof. Pnina Klein – Israel Prize Laureate of the Bar- Ilan University School of Education. * Dr. Tali Regev – an economist from the Taub Center for Social Policy Studies in Israel. * Prof. Rafi Melnick – Vice President of the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya. = Goals = The committee was ordered to investigate: # Proposals to change priorities in order to lighten the load of Israeli citizens. # Implementation of a new taxation system. # Providing access to social services. # Increasing competition in the Israeli economy. # Actual measures need to be taken to reduce housing prices.  Recommendations  The Committee's recommendations were published in September 2011. The recommendations were perceived to be good for the \\"hard-working middle classes\\". They included a slower increase for the defence budget. They were first discussed by the Israeli Cabinet a few days later.  Implementation and Knesset approval  Netanyahu initially promised to push the Committee's recommendations through the cabinet in one piece, but there were differences inside the governing coalition and a different approach of gradual implementation was eventually adopted. In December 2011 the Knesset approved a series of amendments to Israel's tax law. These included an increase in the capital gains tax rate from 20% to 25%. As part of measures to solve the country's housing shortage, the Trajtenberg recommendations included a plan to sell land at a discount to build 5,000 units of affordable housing. The homes would be sold through the existing Mehir Lemishtaken program to people deemed eligible for affordable housing at a discount to market prices. The Trajtenberg committee had recommended mandating that in the case of families, both parents be working. The Shas party objected to this, since it would make Haredi families less likely to qualify. Housing minister Ariel Atias (Shas) proposed criteria that would favour Haredi applicants; this was opposed by Prof. Trajtenberg himself, who said that Atias' criteria had nothing to do with social justice. A housing plan approved by the cabinet in March 2012 included sanctions against developers that delay construction, higher municipal taxes on unoccupied homes and measures to increase the housing supply in Arab communities. The competition portion was approved by the cabinet in December 2011. The measures will reinforce the mandate of the anti-trust commissioner, subject the diesel and home gas markets to supervision, increase competition in the cement market, open Israeli ports up to competition, with private terminals opened in Haifa and Ashdod, and reinforce competition in the marketing of eggs, cheese and milk. The portion of the recommendations for increasing employment were due to be brought to the cabinet for approval in February 2012. They included proposals to increase employment among Arab citizens of Israel, particularly among Arab women, as well as proposals for integrating disabled citizens into the workforce. The plan also called for improving labor law enforcement and assisting single mothers. Other measures aimed to limit foreign workers, creating a mechanism for encouraging them to leave, mandating that employers must deposit NIS 700 of the foreign employees' pensions into a savings fund that the workers receive only upon departing Israel. It also called for setting the minimum wage for foreigners working in industry at NIS 5,300 a month, which would make them more expensive to employ and let locals compete more easily. However the Trajtenberg proposals aiming to increase employment among the Haredi population were not included in the package. Currently only 37% of Haredi men and 49% of Haredi women work. Other recommendations waiting for adoption include reducing the defense budget, opening up parallel imports, implementing free compulsory education for children aged 3 and 4 and providing more affordable housing. Among sectors protected from competition from imports, the Committee highlighted the cement market, 90% of which is held by Nesher. The Committee argued for changing the formula for cement prices, which it said left Nesher with too much profit and blocked potential competition from imports. The Committee also accused the Industry and Trade Ministry of blocking cheap cement imports in order to protect Nesher. A TV program by Channel 10 found that Nesher was selling cement at a 40% discount to Palestinians, and employing former high-ranking officials to help it get a foot into the Palestinian cement market.

Early life Peter George FitzGerald was born on 15 September 1808 and was raised in the banking house of his maternal grandfather in Dublin. He was the eldest surviving son of the Right Hon. Sir Maurice FitzGerald, 18th Knight of Kerry (1774–1849) of Gleanleam and his wife Maria, the daughter of the Right Honourable David la Touche of Marlay. Career FitzGerald entered the civil service and was appointed Vice-Treasurer of Ireland in the last ministry of Sir Robert Peel. In 1849, he succeeded his father and resided almost constantly on Valentia Island, devoting himself indefatigably to the duties of an Irish landlord, the improvement of his estates, and the welfare of his tenantry. He especially earned the thanks of the people by the erection of substantial homesteads in place of the old and poorly-maintained cabins, with which the middleman system had covered the west of Ireland. FitzGerald manifested a keen interest in all questions which had a practical bearing on the progress or prosperity of Ireland and, in contributions to The Times, he deprecated the censure which at that time and since was cast indiscriminately upon all Irish landlords. His own admirable personal qualities, his hatred of abuses, his engaging manners, and his generous nature, made him a great favourite with the Irish peasantry. His hospitality at Glanleam was enjoyed by the Prince of Wales and other distinguished guests. The Atlantic cable had its British termination on his estates, and he evinced much public spirit and energy in connection with the successful laying of the cable. Personal life On 11 August 1838, FitzGerald married Julia Hussey, daughter of Peter Bodkin Hussey of Farranikilla House, co. Kerry, a lineal descendant of the Norman family of Hoses, which settled on the promontory of Dingle in the thirteenth century. By this lady he had four sons and seven daughters: *Mary Emily Francis FitzGerald (1863–1917), who in 1863 married Sir Capel Molyneux, 7th Baronet (died 1879) of Castle Dillon, County Armagh. *Emily FitzGerald (died 1932), unmarried. *Frances Caroline FitzGerald (died 1921), unmarried. *Katharine FitzGerald (died 1927), who in 1873 married Rev. Henry Bell, vicar of Muncaster, Cumberland. *Elizabeth Anne FitzGerald (died 1922), who in 1882 married Francis Spring Rice, 4th Baron Monteagle (1852–1937) (the brother of Thomas Spring Rice, 2rd Baron Monteagle). Their son was Charles Spring Rice, 5th Baron Monteagle (1887–1946). *Julia Emma Isabella FitzGerald (died 1936), who in 1888 married Stephen Spring Rice (1856–1902). After Spring Rice's death, Julia married Baron Monteagle, her sister Elizabeth's widower. *Eileen Gertrude FitzGerald, who in 1886 married Brig. Gen. Edward Kaye Daubeney, son of Reverend Robert Thomas Daubeney *Sir Maurice Fitzgerald, 20th Knight of Kerry, 2nd Baronet of Valentia (1844–1916), who in 1883 married Amélie Bischoffsheim (1858–1947), daughter of Dutch banker Henri Louis Bischoffsheim (1829–1908) and granddaughter of Louis-Raphaël Bischoffsheim (1800–1873). *Robert John La Touche FitzGerald (1852–?), who married Marion Harte, eldest daughter of Mahony Harte, Esq. *Peter David FitzGerald (1855–1935), who in 1890 married Helen Mary Percy (died 1904), daughter of Major William Francis Percy *Brinsley John Hamilton FitzGerald (1859–1931), who in 1918 married Margarita (née Armstrong) Drexel. FitzGerald was a magistrate and deputy- lieutenant for County Kerry, and was High Sheriff of Kerry in 1849, and of County Carlow in 1875. On 8 July 1880, he was created a baronet of Valentia in the County of Kerry, in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom. =Death= FitzGerald suffered from a dangerous malady and died on 6 August 1880. He was succeeded in the title and estates by his eldest son, Captain Maurice FitzGerald, who served with distinction in the Anglo-Ashanti wars, being present at the battles of Amoaful, Becquah, and Ordahau, and at the capture of Coomassie.

It is on display at the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, Austria. Description The portrait was possibly executed when King Sigismund travelled to Mantua to vest Gianfrancesco Gonzaga with the title of marquess. In October 1431 the King had travelled to Italy to sojourn at the court of Filippo Maria Visconti in Milan, where he received the Iron Crown of Lombardy. He later also stayed in Lucca and Siena, and would proceed to Rome to be crowned Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Eugene IV on 31 May 1433. Pisanello drawing, Louvre Département des Arts Graphiques, INV 2479 The portrait obtained an official status, and was copied several times. In 1451 Piero della Francesca was inspired by it for the features of Sigismund of Burgundy of his fresco Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta Praying in Front of St. Sigismund at the Tempio Malatestiano, where he painted the same hat though without the fur filling. The portrait was part of the Imperial collection and housed in the residence of Archduke Ferdinand II of Austria at Ambras Castle near Innsbruck, before being acquired by the Kunsthistorisches Museum. The attribution to Pisanello is disputed, although supported by a Pisanello drawing of the emperor wearing the same hat, on display at the Louvre in Paris. It was previously attributed to the Salzburg painter Conrad Laib or to a Bohemian artist.

The site caters to private and recreational pilots, and offers flight training. Current facilities at the airport include several hangars, an aircraft maintenance workshop, and basic amenities including toilets and showers. History The Airpark was established in 1992 as a private venture with the support of the Golden Plains Shire on a site that was carefully selected to take advantage of unrestricted airspace, existing transportation links and distance from urban development. The first tenant was the Geelong Sports Aviators Club, relocating to Lethbridge in the same year, following the sale and closure of the airfield at Lovely Banks. An aircraft maintenance provider has operated at the airfield since 1993. From 1996, safety improvements including an observation tower to assist with flight training and fire fighting services including a water reserve and increased pumping capacity were progressively added. By 2002, traffic had grown to a level to warrant the establishment of a discrete Common traffic advisory frequency to allow pilots to co-ordinate movements on and around the airfield. In 2006 Alpine Aircraft Sales, the Australian distributor for Alpi Aviation and Just Aircraft relocated operations to a purpose-built hangar at Lethbridge Airpark. By 2008, there were 50 aircraft based at Lethbridge. Expansion In July 2013, the Victorian Government announced a grant of $1 million to help fund upgrades to the facilities at Lethbridge Airpark. The funds will be used to create a × sealed surface on runway 11/29. The upgrades which also include the installation of a Pilot Activated Lighting system, construction of over 100 hangar sites, a sealed helipad and parking areas will allow larger aircraft such as the Beechcraft B200 King Air used by Air Ambulance Victoria all weather access to the field. A water delivery system for fire fighting aircraft operating for the Country Fire Authority who regularly use the airfield as a staging location is also planned as part of the upgrade, with the remaining costs to be paid by the operator. The planned upgrades are expected to create more than 100 ongoing jobs, and position the airport as an important year round hub for emergency services aircraft. It is also hoped that aviation related businesses such as aircraft assembly, sales and service will be encouraged to establish themselves at Lethbridge.

They were commonly called dog-holes because the schooners that served them would have to be able to \\"turn around in a harbor barely small enough for a dog\\".Fort Ross State Historic Park (Fort Ross Conservancy) The Pacific Coast There were major American seaports between Canada and Mexico: Seattle, Washington; Portland, Oregon; San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego, California. Of the other ports on the Redwood Coast only Caspar, Crescent City, Humboldt, Noyo and Mendocino could serve as ports for the largest coastwise and small deepwater vessels. Another 20 could hold medium-sized coasters. The rest, commonly known as dog-holes, could only serve the smallest of the ships.Gary B. Griggs, Kiki Patsch, Lauret E. Savoy (2005) Living with the Changing California Coast (University of California Press, \\"The Northern California Coast\\" chapter 9, page 163) The Redwood Coast extended from San Simeon in California's Central coast to the Chetco River on Oregon's Southwestern coast. This coast is dominated by cliffs and bluffs uplifted from the ocean floor by waves and currents from marine terraces. Since there are few rivers to create ports, the topography made it difficult to handle cargo. Usually, lumber schooners were the only connecters between the lumber ports and the major cities. They brought all types of supplies to the ports and returned with boards, farm produce, and even livestock. Most of the hulls were built on the Pacific Coast and towed to San Francisco loaded with cargo for finishing. Stephen Schwartz \\"Impact of the West Coast Lumber Trade\\" page 6 in Brotherhood of the Sea: A History of the Sailors’ Union of the Pacific, 1885-1985 (Transaction Publishers. 1986)  Loading the ships  There were four major methods of loading ships at dog-holes: lightering, slide, apron or gravity chutes, wire or trapeze chutes, and wharfing. At first shippers used lighters to ferry cargo out to anchored ships, but this was a slow process. By 1860 a gravity chute called an apron or slide chute was developed. It consisted of an A-frame on the bluff and an apron that could be adjusted to the height of the ships’ decks. Lumbermen sent down cargo from the bluff, which was as high as 150 feet, by the chute powered by gravity. A hinged gate covered with iron rode in the chute governed the speed of the wood. A primitive brake called a clapper provided additional control over the speed. It was a moveable plank tongue positioned on the outer end of the apron. It was the responsibility of the clapperman to regulate the speed by a lever. It was dangerous work; if the seaman slipped or the brakeman was slow, the lumber could kill or injure the crew member.Lynwood Carranco, John T. Labbe, “Mendocino Landings” page 38 in Logging the Redwoods (Caxton Press, 1975) Mill operators generally built their lumber loading facilities on the lee (usually the south) side of a point. This allowed the land to break the force of the waves and caused the direction of the swells to roll straight into the cove. Schooners moored with their bows pointed directly into the waves so that they pitched (the ship going up and down along its long axis) but did not roll (going up and down along its crosswise axis). This made loading easier. Lumber Chutes Mooring under a cliff to a buoy or by anchor, the ship would receive cargo down an apron chute or, later a wire chute. It usually took two days to load. All these ports were full of rocks both hidden and exposed. There were undertows and cross-rip currents and continual changing sandbars. The dog-hole operators obtained franchises to build and manage the chutes. When a ship entered a port, it moored to a buoy (often a log anchored to the bottom) and would be warped or winched into position for loading. A ship’s boat, crewed by three seamen and the second mate, carried the eight inch mooring lines to the buoy. The gravity chutes were troughs allowing cargo to be sent down a cliff to a ship. Besides bagged goods, the chutes were used to load other cargo, such as live hogs. High- strength steel cable or wire became available in the 1870s. The wire chute was a big improvement over the gravity chutes. They could load an entire sling of lumber at one time while the apron chutes could only load board by board. The wires could be used to discharge, and load, cargo. Chutes were a West Coast innovation because of the high cliffs along the coast and the lack of harbors. Where prevailing weather conditions permitted, shippers built wharves allowing the ships to come alongside and load directly from the dock. The wire chutes permitted ships with deeper drafts to load since they did not need to approach so close to shore. The wires continued in use until after World War I and were discontinued by the start of World War II.

Entry is on a joint basis with Brooklands Museum. The museum is operated by the London Bus Preservation Trust and exhibits around thirty-five examples (from its forty+ collection) of London buses, coaches and ancillary vehicles covering 100 years of development of the bus in London including Victorian-era horse-buses, 1920s open-top buses, streamlined 1930s designs and through the Second World War to the mass-standardisation of the 1950s, the AEC Routemasters of the 1960s and the rear-engined buses of the 1970s. The collection includes pre-WW2 AEC Regents, post-war AEC Regent III RTs and AEC Routemasters and the exhibits are arranged in an historical timeline, divided into galleries representing milestones in the development of the London bus, placing each artefact in its contemporary setting. The Museum's collection contains some unique exhibits, many of which have been fully restored by the volunteers, including prototypes of the AEC Regent III RT and the Routemaster and the only surviving Second World War \\"utility\\" bus that ran in London. History The origins of the museum lie in the foundation of the London Bus Preservation Group (LBPG) in 1966, an association of individual owners of London buses who wished to pool their resources. Some members of that group had attempted to preserve old London buses as far back as 1952 but their first success came with the purchase in 1956 of a 1929 AEC Regal single-decker which had originated with the London General Omnibus Company and which is now generally recognised as the first bus to be privately preserved in the UK. In 1972, the LBPG acquired a former Second World War aircraft factory, now demolished, near Cobham, Surrey where the private Cobham Bus Museum was established, taking its name from the location. Although the museum had in the interim become a Registered Charity and a Registered Museum, by the early 2000s its future was uncertain as the building was deteriorating and planning permission could not be obtained to operate a public museum from the location, thereby jeopardising both the charitable and museum statuses. Eventually, the operating Trust was able to negotiate the acquisition of a large plot of land from the nearby Brooklands Museum Trust on the location of the former Brooklands racing circuit and aircraft production site. A deal was struck for the redevelopment of the old museum site and the construction of a new building at the new location, thus providing the museum with a secure home from where it could open daily to the public. The new, purpose-built premises opened in 2011 and the London Bus Museum name was adopted.

It was released for Android and Apple iPhone on 23 September 2009, for RIM Blackberry on 27 February 2012, for Windows Phone on 1 March 2012, and for Nokia Series 40 on 3 September 2012. Truecaller had five million users performing 120 million searches of the telephone number database every month. As of 22 January 2013 Truecaller reached 10 million users. As of January 2017 Truecaller had reached 250 million users worldwide. As of 4 February 2020, it crossed 200 million monthly user-base globally, of which 150 million were from India. On 18 September 2012, Techcrunch announced that OpenOcean, a venture capital fund led by former MySQL and Nokia executives (including Michael Widenius, founder of MySQL), were investing US$1.3 million in Truecaller to push Truecaller’s global reach. Truecaller said that it intended to use the new funding to expand its footprint in \\"key markets\\"—specifically North America, Asia and the Middle East. In February 2014, Truecaller received $18.8 million in funding from Sequoia Capital, alongside existing investor OpenOcean, Truecaller chairman Stefan Lennhammer, and an unnamed private investor. It also announced a partnership with Yelp to use Yelp's API data to help identify business numbers when they call a smartphone. In October of the same year, they received $60 million from Niklas Zennstrom's Atomico investment firm and from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. On 7 July 2015 Truecaller launched its SMS app called Truemessenger exclusively in India. Truemessenger enables users to identify the sender of SMS messages. This launch was aimed at increasing the company's user base in India which are the bulk of its active users. In December 2019, Truecaller announced it plans to go public in an IPO on 2022.  Security and privacy issues  On 17 July 2013, Truecaller servers were allegedly hacked into by the Syrian Electronic Army. The group claimed on its Twitter handle to have recovered 459 GBs of database, primarily due to an older version of WordPress installation on the servers. On 18 July 2013, Truecaller issued a statement on its blog stating that their website was indeed hacked, but claiming that the attack did not disclose any passwords or credit card information. On 23 November 2019 Indian-based security researcher Ehraz Ahmed discovered a security flaw that exposed user data as well as system and location information. Truecaller confirmed this information and the bug was immediately fixed.

It is located in the north east of the island, east of Amlwch, north west of Menai Bridge and north of Llangefni. The community includes the villages and hamlets of Dulas, Llaneilian, Pengorffwysfa, Cerrig Man and Penysarn, Gadfa and Nebo, and at the 2001 census had a population of 1,192, decreasing slightly to 1,186 at the 2011 Census. The parish is crowned by its hill, Mynydd Eilian (177 metres), a HuMP, popular with walkers and ramblers (the Anglesey Coastal Path navigates most of the parish's coastline - all of which within the Anglesey Coastal Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty), and its beach, Traeth Eilian, which is popular with holidaymakers and for watersport activities. At the north easternmost point is Point Lynas, (on a clear day from the north coast of Anglesey the Isle of Man is visible with the streetlights of Douglas, Isle of Man visible on the horizon), while Ynys Dulas lies off the North East coast of the island, east of Dulas Bay.Point Lynas Lighthouse, Llaneilian History =Llys Caswallon, Court of the Kingdom of Gwynedd= The parish contains the remains of Llys Caswallon and there has been a traditional association of this site with the court of 5th Century King of Gwynedd Cadwallon Lawhir ap Einion - the third generation of the dynasty of Gwynedd, being the grandson of Cunedda, the progenitor of the royal dynasty of Gwynedd. With no visible evidence above ground it had been thought that the site indicated on the Ordnance Survey map of 1889, within a field near Mynnydd Eilian, might be without basis and by the mid 20th century had been largely discredited as a Llys site. However a geophysical survey in 2009 identified foundations of a rectangular building within a trapezoidal enclosure, for which an early medieval site was a strong possibility. The Lineage of Cadwallon led to the famed reign of Rhodri the Great, who brought the kingdoms of Gwynedd, Powys and Seisyllwg under his control, and fought the threats of the Anglo Saxons and Vikings, and who was killed on the island of Anglesey in 854AD. Later, this lineage led to possibly the most well known of all the medieval kings of Wales, Hywel Dda, who came to rule most of Wales, and became synonymous with the codification of medieval Welsh law which became famed for a reputation of justice and early recognition of women's rights. His legacy endured in the form of his laws, which remained in active use throughout Wales until the appointed date of implementation of the Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542 of Henry VIII of England who asserted his royal descent by blood-line from the House of Aberffraw, via Rhodri Mawr via Hywel Dda. It was this claim to this ancient Brittonic lineage by a British monarch that led to a widespread feeling of the fulfilment of the myth of the Mab Darogan, a messianic figure of Welsh legend destined to reclaim Britain for the Celtic inhabitants. The legacy of this lineage is represented in the main office buildings of the National Assembly for Wales being named \\"Tŷ Hywel\\" (the House of Hywel), within which the former debating chamber of the National Assembly for Wales has been converted into a youth debating chamber, the first of its kind in Europe, named \\"Siambr Hywel\\" (Hywel's Chamber) after Hywel Dda. The coat of arms of this dynasty is represented on the Royal Badge of Wales which appears on Acts of the National Assembly for Wales passed by the National Assembly for Wales. =World War I= In World War I a wireless telegraphy (radio) relay station at Llaneilian was used for communication with airships patrolling the Irish Sea for German submarines.

The nave and chancel contain 15th and 16th century Flemish stained glass, which had been removed from former Roman Catholic churches taken over by Protestants, who considered the images theologically unsound. Other examples are found at the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Burrell Collection in Glasgow, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The church was built to replace the medieval church of St Gwenllwyfo, which had also served the Llys Dulas settlement, although it stood over a mile away at the other end of the dispersed village. The old church is now reduced to some low stone walls within a churchyard. Ynys Dulas refuge tower The refuge tower on Ynys Dulas was built in 1821 by James Hughes of Llysdulas as a refuge for shipwrecked sailors. It was stocked with essential foodstuffs to enable those stranded to survive until rescuers arrived. Point Lynas Lighthouse is located on the northern headland. The first lighthouse was built by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board in 1779. It was replaced in 1835, and moved up onto the hilltop, so does not need a tower. It did not come under the care of Trinity House until 1973. By 2001 the lights were fully automated, so no resident staff were needed. whilst the light is retained in operational use, the building and associated lighthouse keepers cottages were returned to the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board who sold them to be a private home and holiday accommodation.

It is endemic to Western Australia. Taxonomy The names for the plant used by Noongar peoples are danja, dumbung or koongal. It was first described by Robert Brown in 1830. The species name is derived from the Latin adjective occidentalis, meaning 'western'. Description The tree or shrub typically grows to a height of and has epicormic buds. It blooms between December and February producing cream white flowers. The surface of the flower is finely covered in silky hairs, the colour is a sulphurous yellow, they appear on spikes at the end of its branches. The fruit closely resembles a 'pear', those of genus Pyrus, are over three inches long, one and three quarter inches wide, and deeply split along one edge after ripening.

The community population taken at the 2011 Census was 553. The village takes its name from the Church of Saint Maethlu. The community includes Llanfwrog. History There is a hill fort with a single bank and ditch in the vicinity of Llanfaethlu, and a small hoard of Roman coins was found on a hill to the west of the church, some having been minted when Domitian was emperor, around 90 AD. The village is built around the Church of Saint Maethlu. This church is dedicated to Maethlu the Confessor who is thought to have founded an early Christian religious establishment about three quarters of a mile to the south of the present building. Two other early Christian burial sites have been found close by, at Hen Siop and at the lodge of Carreglwyd. In the early nineteenth century, Llanfaethlu was the site of a telegraph station, part of a chain of such stations designed to pass information about the movement of ships between Liverpool and Holyhead. The operation started in 1827 and the signals were at first made using flag semaphore, meaning that they could be obstructed in adverse weather conditions. The visual system was replaced by an electric telegraph later in the century. Llanfaethlu is home to Condessa, a small liquor company that manufactures specialist liqueurs which include Welsh cream liqueur, praline cream liqueur, black cherry liqueur and sloe gin.

It is located completely inside an area known as the South Durban Basin. The Wentworth area is located near major freeways M4 and M7 is approximately 11 km south of the Durban City Centre. History Wentworth forms part of the South Durban Basin. Initiated in 1938 by British colonialists, the area's original purpose was to serve as an army base. Due to the 1950 Group Areas Act Apartheid-era policy however, the region was split into districts depending on ethnic background. Today in fact, Wentworth is made up primarily of people who identify as \\"Coloured\\"—a term used in South Africa to distinguish someone of mixed ethnic background. The Group Areas Act was not unique to the South Durban Basin; it was a policy whose touch still can be seen in metropolitan and suburban areas all over the country today. The Bluff Nature Reserve on Tara Road divided (and for the most part continues to divide) Wentworth from the Bluff and thus the coloured population from the white one. In the 1960s, Coloured people were relocated to the swampy unused land of Wentworth (also known as Austerville). The red brick buildings in this area, once occupied by white military families, were then converted into homes for the Coloured people. Affluent Coloured families were also allowed to purchase prime real estate on Treasure Beach, which was originally set aside for Coloured development. An area known as Happy Valley separates Treasure Beach from Tara Road and Wentworth. This bushland was the site of many informal settlements and tin shanties, but were soon demolished when the area's largest oil refineries, Engen and SAPREF moved in 1952 and 1963. These two refineries still prove to be both physical and economic landmarks in the area today. Further down Tara Road and past Wentworth is an area known as Merebank: this is where Indians were relocated and where the population is still concentrated today. During this period of oppression, neither Coloured nor Indian people were allowed to move into the white regions. All in all, while Wentworth is a place where the effects of Apartheid policies remain visible, it is also a place where many different cultures have managed to survive, blend, and flourish. Culture and Activities The primarily spoken languages in Wentworth and the surrounding areas are English, Zulu, Afrikaans, This rich mix of languages and cultures naturally leads to an equally interesting mix of cuisine. Common street foods include samoosas and \\"bunnies\\" (both have roots in the Indian community), and one cannot attend a function without running across a pot full of steaming biryani (a popular rice dish). British tea culture often winds its way into Wentworth's cultural tapestry as well. Another fixture in Wentworth culture is the use of \\"combis\\", or \\"share taxis\\". While not unique to the African continent, not all areas of South Africa use this mode of transportation. Whether independently owned or part of the many combi companies in the area, they can always be seen around Wentworth. Combis in Wentworth are particularly interesting because of the elaborate way the drivers name and decorate their cars. There are many local soccer, rugby, and cricket leagues that people of all ages engage in. Because of Wentworth's proximity to the coast, the area is also ideal for fishing, spending time at the beach and recreational swimming. During June and July in fact, one would be likely to spot thousands of sardines migrating along the coast. Government and Infrastructure Wentworth is part of the eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality and is served by its current councilor, Aubrey Snyman. Currently the Wentworth area votes primarily for the Democratic Alliance (DA), the party that is in direct opposition with the African National Congress (ANC). The South African Police Service also have a significant presence in the area with their offices and local cells located in Austerville Drive. It also operates a very successful and reputable Victim Friendly Centre for victims of Abuse; the Majesterial district has one of the major courts in the Durban South. However, there is insufficient data but there are many repeat offenders who present at the court time and time again in the area which is ridden with Crime, largely due to two significant factors, the fact that much of the area live below the poverty line and secondly due to the incredibly high prevalence of not only HIV/AIDS but of an equally high incidence of associated Drug and Alcohol abuse. The only community-based Addiction Recovery Centre locally open to all in the South Durban Basis is that of Place of Grace which operates a full rehabilitation programme on an out-patient basis with an optional safe-house residence, situated at The Blue Roof Wellness Centre,(which is now a youth centre{2017} run by Zoë-Life ) and is run by Act of Grace 145. A local Public Benefit Organisation, which provides large, and significant donations of food and new clothes, shoes and educational toys on a weekly basis, into the area, on a weekly basis, based on Needs Analysis which are completed in full prior to a households acceptance in the charity programme. This service has been discontinued. Wentworth Hospital is a district level government hospital located in Wentworth on the Bluff. It has within itself, closed its detoxification unit for addicts in an area where drug abuse has reached pandemic levels, even with hospital premises. However a matter of Good governance and the training and management of security and personnel within the Hospital, could eradicate such problems, allowing the Hospital to effectively re-open this much needed unit. The South African Post Office is situated on Austerville Drive. Violence and Crime An unfortunate component to life in Wentworth is, or rather, was, the high rates of violence and crime in the area. Most of the crime in the area would stem from either gang violence, drugs, or acts by locals to defend the area from unscrupulous outsiders. In the 1980s in particular, gang violence in Wentworth was supposedly so bad that \\"people were afraid to walk the streets at night...it was like a war zone\\" (ccs.ukzn.ac.za, A current major contributing factor is that sometimes outsiders move in, and along with them a culture of violence, negating the wonderful work being done by current Role-Players. Fortunately, many NGOs and churches in Wentworth fought to end the cycle of crime. Today, along with the Addiction Recovery Centre and Victim Friendly Centre, other notable forces of change include the national organization Brothers For Life, and the Violence Free Zones. The Violence Free Zones were launched in 2008 with the combined efforts of Brothers For Life and the Prevention in Action (PIA) movement, with the goal of providing community-based action and support against gender based violence. These zones can be spotted easily because of the neon colored houses and signs that mark their beginning and end. After all consideration, Wentworth is fast becoming a safe zone and is low on the list of High-crime areas in KwaZulu-Natal. For example, the number of people murdered in 2015 was ten (10), well below the national average. (www.crimestatssa.com) This includes the deaths of people who lost their lives in the industrial area close by, and business robbery related deaths. Says one community member and author named Christopher Lee. 'I have family in Wentworth and have been living in other towns for well over twenty eight years, visiting all the while. After moving back home I realize that, despite the negativity thrust upon the area, Wentworth is generally a healthy place to live in. I see children walking around safely, even at night. I am yet to be approached by any drug-dealer, and, besides the occasional blow-up by bored teenage boys, I have never witnessed any Gang violence in the past decade. It's like there are two sides to the place; the negative viewpoint seen through the eyes of jaded locals or outsiders, and the actual side that I have seen for the past years, and still see now. True the place has \\"bad areas.\\" (most towns do). Yet even there; people, strangers, are generally safe.' Economy and Environment Currently, there are approximately 350 businesses in the Wentworth area, the major ones being the SAPREF and Engen oil refineries, and the Mondi and Sappi paper mills. Other industries that make up the Wentworth area include landfills, and water treatment sites. In Wentworth area specifically, factories can be found on the northern, eastern, and western sides. Environmental justice and apartheid are closely related because of the Group Areas Act. Blacks (African), Coloureds and Indians were placed in environmentally and aesthetically less pleasing areas, which ultimately led to those communities being exposed to more environmental hazards. In short, the Group Areas Act forced Coloured, Indian, and African peoples to move close to these centers of heavy industry, therefore resulting in \\"a historically tense relationship between residents, big businesses, and environmentalists\\" (www.durban.gov.za, \\"South Durban Basin\\") that still continues to this day. Organizations like the South Durban Community Environmental Alliance (SDCEA) for example, fight to change policies surrounding both environmental and social issues, as in the Wentworth area in particular those issues are so connected. http://mg.co.za/article/2013-07-05-00-pressure-on-to-build-new- durban-port, Despite the fact that Wentworth is a relatively industrialized area, the current unemployment rate still falls somewhere around 40 percent. Education In South Africa, the curriculum for all public primary and secondary schools is standardized. For primary and secondary schools, the curriculum includes, mathematics, natural science, social science, as well as English, Zulu, and Afrikaans language courses. Primary school encompasses grades R (the equivalent of kindergarten) to grade 7, and secondary school includes grades 8 to \\"matric\\". In Wentworth itself, there are many primary and secondary schools that children from both Wentworth and the surrounding areas attend. = Primary schools = * Assegai Primary: Assegai Primary School was founded in 1961 with the motto “Prosperity, Peace, Progress.” The classrooms that students sit in today, however, were not completed until about twenty years later. The school's facilities include a computer room, library, and grounds with basketball and netball courts as well as a soccer field. The school begins with grade R and continues until grade 7, with four classes of about forty students per grade (excluding grade R, which has two classes). Each class has one teacher. However, the senior primary (grades 4 through 7) has recently adopted a successful program of specialization in which educators are assigned a subject and move from class to class to teach that particular discipline. Assegai's students come from many different areas including both the surrounding Wentworth community and the nearby township of Umlazi. They are taught three languages (English, Zulu, and Afrikaans) in addition to the basic subjects such as Mathematics, Arts and Culture, Geography, etc. Learners also have the option to participate in after-school activities such as soccer, baseball, and rugby. *Austerville Primary founded in 1960.First school for so called mixed races.

Early life Mogoeng was born on 14 January 1961 in Goo-Mokgatha (Koffiekraal) village near Zeerust in the North West Province. His father was a miner and his mother a domestic worker. Mogoeng became politically active at high school, from which he was briefly suspended for organising a memorial to the victims of the Soweto uprising. Mogoeng received a B.Juris in 1983 from the University of Zululand and a Bachelor of Laws in 1985 from the University of Natal. There he had been active in the Azanian Students' Movement during a time of grave repression by the SADF. From 1985 he worked for the government of Bophuthatswana as a High Court prosecutor in Mahikeng; though working for a bantustan was stigmatised, Mogoeng was obliged to do so for five years to repay his government bursary. He obtained a Master of Laws by correspondence from the University of South Africa in 1989.. Mogoeng left Bophuthatswana's civil service the following year to begin practice as an advocate. After a short period at the Johannesburg Bar, Mogoeng returned to Mahikeng, where he practiced for six years. He was the chair of Lawyers for Human Rights' Bophuthatswana chapter and a part-time lecturer at the University of Bophuthatswana (now North-West University). Judicial career In 1997, Mogoeng accepted an appointment to the North West High Court, though he had felt initially that he was too inexperienced to be made a judge. He became a judge of the Labour Appeal Court in 2000 and the Judge President of the North West High Court in 2002. In October 2009, in President Jacob Zuma's first raft of judicial appointments, Mogoeng was elevated to the highest court in South Africa, its Constitutional Court. He was appointed simultaneously with Chris Jafta, Sisi Khampepe and Johan Froneman. = Nomination as Chief Justice = Less than two years later, in mid-2011, Mogoeng was nominated for appointment as Chief Justice. Mogoeng's nomination was extremely controversial, drawing strong criticism from across the political spectrum, including from within President Zuma's own Tripartite Alliance, as well as from the press, local and international civic organizations, legal academics and bar councils. Deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke, Mogoeng's perceived rival. Mogoeng was one of the Constitutional Court's most junior members, having been appointed to it less than two years earlier, and having been a relative unknown at one of the smallest High Court divisions prior to that. Besides his general lack of reported judgments, critics noted that he had failed to recuse himself in S v Dube, a case where his wife had appeared as the state prosecutor. In addition, Mogoeng was nominated ahead of the expected appointee, Dikgang Moseneke, who had served the Constitutional Court for nine years and as Deputy Chief Justice for six. Moseneke had already been overlooked once before, when Sandile Ngcobo was appointed Chief Justice, and his second snubbing was attributed to his Pan Africanist Congress background and remarks at a social occasion distancing himself from the ruling African National Congress (ANC). Mogoeng's own meteoric rise under the Zuma administration raised concerns about his independence. His nomination ahead of Moseneke reminded many of the notorious supersession by L. C. Steyn, a National Party favourite, of Oliver Schreiner. Finally, whereas Moseneke had been active in the struggle against apartheid, COSATU said it was concerning that Mogoeng had been a prosecutor for a bantustan. But the most widespread concerns were about Mogoeng's judgments in rape and gender-violence cases. The Nobel Women's Initiative accused Mogoeng of invoking dangerous myths about rape and of victim-blaming. Of the many judgments cited by critics in which Mogoeng had been lenient on rapists and domestic assailants, three were emphasised. In State v Sebaeng, Mogoeng reduced the sentence of a child rapist on the basis that he had been non- violent and indeed \\"tender\\" in raping the victim. The 2005 case of State v Moipolai involved the rape of a pregnant woman by her long-term boyfriend. Despite several aggravating factors, Mogoeng reduced the man's sentence from ten years' imprisonment to five because the rape was, he said, not as serious as if a stranger had committed it. Finally, in State v Mathebe, Mogoeng reduced the sentence, from two years' imprisonment to a fine of R4,000, of a man who had tied his girlfriend to his car and dragged her 50 meters along a dirt road. Mogoeng's explanation was that the man had been \\"provoked\\" by the victim. When these three judgments were raised in a BBC interview, Mogoeng compared his judgments in sexual-assault cases to a game of football, saying it would be wrong to call Manchester United a bad team because it loses three matches in a season. Legal academic Pierre de Vos said Mogoeng was clearly the most conservative member of the Constitutional Court. He pointed to Mogoeng's ambivalence over gay rights – in Le Roux v Dey Mogoeng dissented, without giving reasons, from paragraphs which said it was not defamatory to call someone gay – and to his dissenting judgment in The Citizen v Robert McBride, which would severely restrict freedom of expression. =Interview and appointment= Moseneke, as the country's Acting Chief Justice pending a permanent appointment, chaired the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) when it interviewed Mogoeng to determine his suitability. Mogoeng seemed prickly throughout, having to apologize to Moseneke for lashing out at one of his questions. In response, one commissioner told Mogoeng he seemed \\"arrogant\\" and unsuited to the position. Commentators said that Mogoeng's conduct at the interview heightened concerns about his judicial temperament. Mogoeng's own view was that he had been \\"rock solid\\" at his interview. Mogoeng's appointment was recommended by the JSC and confirmed by President Zuma on 8 September 2011. The JSC's decision to appoint Mogoeng, despite his many critics, coupled with the partisan conduct of the JSC's political appointees during his interview, suggested to some that the JSC had been captured by political interests. Record as Chief Justice = Separation of powers = Criticism of Mogoeng's suitability, and of his close ties with the Zuma administration, continued well after his appointment. But he has been defended by highly respected colleagues, like Kate O'Regan and Edwin Cameron, who described him as a man \\"of serious purpose, deeply committed to the Constitution\\", and is now widely thought to have dispelled suspicions that he would be an executive- minded Chief Justice.The courtroom of the Constitutional Court of South AfricaIn his public addresses he has been \\"outspoken\\" and \\"forthright\\". He has regularly championed judicial independence and deplored interference by the executive. He has also publicly criticised Minister of Justice Michael Masutha for failing to ensure that the judiciary is autonomous and adequately funded. In June 2015, it emerged that Mogoeng had been the target of two smear campaigns – apparently showing that Mogoeng had, through his outspokenness, \\"made enemies\\" in the establishment. The following month, Mogoeng called a meeting of senior judges who released an exceptional press statement \\"reject[ing]\\" criticisms of the judiciary made by Gwede Mantashe and Blade Nzimande in the wake of the ANC government's allowing Omar al-Bashir to leave South Africa in contravention of a court order. Mogoeng also requested a meeting with President Zuma to discuss the situation, which Zuma agreed to three weeks later. Mogoeng was widely praised for his \\"courageous and principled leadership\\" and his \\"efforts to protect the independence of the judiciary\\". One commentator even said \\"Mogoeng's intervention might one day be seen as one of the courageous acts that saved South Africa's budding democracy\\". President Jacob Zuma, of whom Mogoeng was widely thought to be an ally when first appointed to the Constitutional Court. But Mogoeng has regularly ruled against Zuma in high-profile cases. In 2012, Mogoeng upheld a constitutional challenge by Mario Oriani-Ambrosini, of the minority Inkatha Freedom Party, to rules of Parliament that allowed an individual MP to introduce a Bill only if he or she first obtained the majority's approval.Oriani-Ambrosini, MP v Sisulu, MP Speaker of the National Assembly (2012) ZACC 27. Mogoeng also held against the government in the high-profile litigation in Helen Suzman Foundation v President.Helen Suzman Foundation v President of the Republic of South Africa and Others; Glenister v President of the Republic of South Africa and Others (2014) ZACC 32. His majority judgment struck down several sections of the South African Police Service Amendment Act of 2012 (the so-called Hawks Act) on the basis that they did not constitute an \\"adequately independent\\" anti-corruption unit. (Other members of the Court would, however, have gone further, and struck down other sections which Mogoeng upheld.) Mogoeng's Court also found against the government in Democratic Alliance v President (per Yacoob ADCJ), setting aside President Zuma's highly controversial appointment of Menzi Simelane as National Director of Public Prosecutions.Democratic Alliance v President of the Republic of South Africa and Others, (2012) ZACC 24. And in October 2014 his Court handed down judgment in National Commissioner of the SAPS v SALC (per Majiedt AJ) and ordered the South African Police Service to investigate allegations of torture in Zimbabwe committed by and against Zimbabwean nationals.National Commissioner of The South African Police Service v Southern African Human Rights Litigation Centre and Another (2014) ZACC 30. This judgment was hailed as a victory for universal jurisdiction. In its wake, one influential columnist said that those who had expected the Constitutional Court to take a pro-executive turn under Mogoeng had been proved wrong. Finally, in 2016, Mogoeng himself wrote the Court's judgment in Economic Freedom Fighters v Speaker of the National Assembly, which declared that President Zuma had violated the South African Constitution by failing to act on the Public Protector's Nkandla report. Mogoeng's \\"powerful\\" and \\"profound\\" judgment was hailed as a \\"triumph for the rule of law\\", and a major blow to the widely criticised President, of whose conduct the judgment was \\"scathing\\". One commentator said Mogoeng's judgment was \\"his moment of triumph and redemption\\", and marked his transformation from a supposed \\"tool\\" of the establishment to a \\"national hero\\" in a manner reminiscent of Earl Warren. A year later, Mogoeng delivered the unanimous judgment in UDM v Speaker of the National Assembly, in which he granted an application brought by opposition parties to set aside the refusal by Speaker Baleka Mbete, a close Zuma ally, to have a vote of no confidence in the President conducted by secret ballot.United Democratic Movement v Speaker of the National Assembly and Others [2017 ZACC 21]. The opposition parties had argued that the secret ballot was necessary to ensure that ANC MPs could vote against the President without fear of retribution. Shortly before this, however, Mogoeng had cautioned, in a contentious judgment that failed to win the support of a majority of his colleagues, that judges must respect the separation of powers and defer appropriately to the executive, and on this basis refused to accede to complaints that the government's controversial policy on new television broadcast technologies was unlawful.Electronic Media Network Limited and Others v e.tv (Pty) Limited and Others [2017] ZACC 17. Much more high-profile was his dissent in Economic Freedom Fighters v Speaker of the National Assembly (No. 2), in which opposition parties had argued that Parliament had not taken adequate steps to hold Zuma to account in terms of the order issued by the Court in the first EFF judgment.Economic Freedom Fighters and Others v Speaker of the National Assembly and Another [2017 ZACC 47]. On this occasion Mogoeng was strongly opposed to finding against Parliament; he described the majority judgment, which upheld the opposition parties' complaints, as \\"a textbook case of judicial overreach\\" and criticised his colleagues for overstepping the separation of powers. The majority judgment, though authored by Mogoeng's usual ally, Jafta J, describes this \\"unprecedented\\" allegation as \\"misplaced and unfortunate\\"; and Froneman J was motivated to write a judgment of his own, saying that Mogoeng's characterisation of the majority's position \\"does nothing to further the debate\\". The EFF was highly critical of Mogoeng's judgment, as well as his conduct at the court sitting when the judgment was delivered: Mogoeng had interrupted Jafta J, mid-delivery, to insist that he read out his (Mogoeng's) judgment in full. The EFF described this as an \\"abuse of power\\" and an \\"unacceptable\\" show of disrespect to a fellow judge. It also insinuated that, as a result of being \\"over-celebrated\\", Mogoeng had become \\"a monster\\". One leading commentator said Mogoeng's \\"very serious\\" attack on the majority judgment was \\"difficult to comprehend\\"; others, however, defended his right to dissent. = Gender violence = In F v Minister of Safety and Security, in an apparent riposte to critics of his allegedly patriarchal views, Mogoeng strongly deplored sexual violence and held the state liable to compensate a young girl who had been raped by an off-duty policeman.F v Minister of Safety and Security and Another (2011) ZACC 37. And in 2013 he was praised for his \\"unexpected progressiveness\\" at the hearing of Teddy Bear Clinic v Minister of Justice, where his questions from the bench showed \\"he was clearly moved by the notion that consensual sexual behaviour between minors should not be criminalised\\". This judgment (per Khampepe J), together with those Mogoeng himself wrote after becoming Chief Justice, were said to show that his \\"jurisprudence has not been as conservative as some critics thought\\" it would be. In DE v RH, in which the Court unanimously abrogated the action for adultery, Mogoeng wrote separately to emphasise that the law cannot be used to enforce marital ethics.DE v RH (2015) ZACC 18. A detailed retrospective published in October 2016 concluded that Mogoeng had \\"begun to craft a new name for himself\\" as a proponent of gender rights. = Religious views = Mogoeng is an lay preacher in the Pentecostal Winners Chapel but is now a Pastor in the Redeemed Christian Church of God. He attributed the criticism over his nomination and appointment to his Christian faith. But in Mogoeng's view, stated at his JSC interview, God wanted him to be Chief Justice. Concern about Mogoeng's religious conservatism did not abate during his tenure. In March 2012 he was publicly criticised for requesting judges to attend a leadership conference hosted by Christian evangelist John C. Maxwell, raising concerns about the separation of church and judiciary. And in May 2014 he gave a speech at Stellenbosch University arguing that religion should infuse the law to a greater extent, \\"starting with the Constitution\\". He quoted from the Bible, compared the three branches of government to the Holy Trinity and railed against social evils like \\"fornication\\". Mogoeng's speech sparked a media furore, in response to which he sought to offer clarification. The resulting press conference seemed to confirm rather than allay the media's fears. On the other hand, one influential columnist praised Mogoeng for his candour, saying it is better than perpetuating the \\"myth\\" that judges are neutral and free of all personal predilections. Mogoeng's religious convictions have also found their way into his judgments: in McBride, for example, he railed against the use of \\"foul language\\" and South Africa's \\"being denuded of moral standards\\", and cited the Bible. Head of the JSC As Chief Justice of South Africa, Mogoeng is the head of the Judicial Service Commission (JSC), which is responsible for the appointment of judges. The JSC has attracted criticism under Mogoeng's stewardship, in part because of its attitude to the racial \\"transformation\\" of the judiciary. Izak Smuts, one of the JSC's senior members, resigned in protest at the JSC's \\"disturbing\\" appointment record, and the Helen Suzman Foundation took the JSC to court over its allegedly \\"irrational\\" refusal to appoint certain candidates. Shortly thereafter, Chief Justice Mogoeng gave a speech at an Advocates for Transformation event in which he said a \\"deliberate attempt is being made to delegitimize the JSC\\" through \\"scare tactics\\" and blamed this on \\"a well coordinated network of individuals and entities\\" – possibly apartheid agents, Mogoeng implied – \\"pretending to be working in isolation from each other\\". Mogoeng called on his audience to oppose \\"this illegitimate neo-political campaign to have certain people appointed\\". This now \\"infamous\\" speech was criticised for departing from the requirements of judicial impartiality and seeming to betray a racial bias. Paul Hoffman SC sought to have Mogoeng impeached on the basis that he had brought the judiciary into disrepute,Paul Hoffman (6 August 2013), \\"Why Mogoeng should be impeached\\". but this complaint was itself widely criticised as \\"ill-considered\\" and \\"weak on the law\\" and was dismissed by the Judicial Conduct Committee. A year later, when Hoffman and Smuts appeared in an unrelated case before the Constitutional Court (coincidentally involving the Helen Suzman Foundation), Mogoeng strongly criticised the conduct of their client's case and upheld a rare punitive costs order against him. One commentator described this as a \\"discredit\\" to the Court's usual approach. After the retirement of Justice Thembile Skweyiya in May 2014, Mogoeng stated that he wanted to appoint a female judge in his place. The vacancy was then left open for over a year, as a series of female acting appointments were made instead, apparently to provide a test run. This dilatoriness in making a permanent appointment was criticised by commentators, who said it was corrosive of judicial independence and inconsistent with the South African Constitution. Mogoeng's stated reason for the delay, namely the need to find competent female candidates, was said to be \\"patronising\\" and unconvincing. Mogoeng was also criticised for giving the impression that JSC appointments were \\"preordained\\" and that male candidates would not be considered. The JSC finally acted to fill the vacancy fourteen months after it arose.\\"Judicial Vacancy: Constitutional Court\\", African Legal Centre (pdf). Starting in late 2014, after a change in the JSC's composition, several commentators perceived a marked improvement in the conduct of its interviews, especially on questions about gender transformation in the judiciary. This was ascribed in part to Mogoeng's leadership and to the departure of ANC hardliners like Jeff Radebe, Ngoako Ramatlhodi and Fatima Chohan. = Hlophe complaint = Mogoeng has been the head of the JSC during most of the long- running controversy over misconduct complaints against Western Cape High Court Judge President, John Hlophe. The main complaint against Hlophe was laid in 2008 by the judges of the Constitutional Court, who alleged that he tried to persuade them to decide a case in favour of then-President Jacob Zuma. The processing of this complaint has been repeatedly stalled so that, more than ten years after it was first lodged, no action has been taken against Hlophe. In January 2020, further complaints were lodged against Hlophe by his deputy judge president Patricia Goliath. Mogoeng is the chairperson of the JSC's Judicial Conduct Committee, which is mandated to decide this complaint. Mogoeng initially disclaimed responsibility, however, on the basis that he lacks any legal power to take disciplinary action against a judge. This argument has been rejected by commentators and the JCC's refusal to take action described as \\"bizarre\\". Later, however, in July 2020, Mogoeng decided that the complaint against Hlophe should be adjudicated by the JCC, and said that, if true, the complaint would be grounds for a finding of gross misconduct.

The Hôtel Saint-Pol was a royal residence begun in 1360 by Charles V of France on the ruins of a building constructed by Louis IX. It was used by Charles V and Charles VI. Located on the Right Bank, to the northwest of the Quartier de l'Arsenal in the 4th arrondissement of Paris, the residence's grounds stretched from the Quai des Célestins to the Rue Saint-Antoine, and from the Rue Saint-Paul to the Rue du Petit-Musc. It fell into disuse and ruin after the death of Isabeau de Bavière in 1435 and was demolished after François I of France sold it in parts at auction in 1543.Lorentz and Sandron 2006, pp. 90–91.  History  In 1360 Charles V began constructing Hôtel Saint-Pol from the Hôtel du Petit-Musc, purchased in 1318 by Louis of Bourbon, a grandson of Louis IX. From then until 1364, Charles continued to improve and develop it by acquiring additional property, including the newer Hôtel d'Étampes in 1361, and ordering the construction of new buildings.Emery 2015, pp. 206–207. The king, who could not stand the pestilential odours of Paris and the problems they caused his health, appreciated its location outside the medieval city. He valued the residence for its calm and its cleaner environment, which he claimed had helped him avoid illnesses, and more importantly recover good health. On 28 January 1393, the Bal des Ardents took place at the Hôtel Saint-Pol. Four noble dancers caught fire and were burned to death, while Charles VI and another dancer barely escaped the flames.  Expansion of the park of the Hôtel Saint-Pol  The Hôtel Saint-Pol was not a single building, but consisted of three important dwellings making up the royal residence: one dwelling for the king, one for the queen (the former Hôtel d'Étampes), one for their children (the former Hôtel des Abbés de Saint- Maur). All had rooms for banquets and entertainments given by the king, and rooms for guests. Charles V had the residence luxuriously decorated according to his personal tastes, with precious woods, paintings, and goldwork. Walls were decorated with hangings embroidered with pearls, and books were displayed on the furniture, along with golden ornaments. Two chapels were built in the residence, one for the king, the other for his consort, Joanna of Bourbon. The hôtel included a remarkable collection of precious books that the king enjoyed assembling, including those of his father, John II, who had also been a great lover of books. This collection allowed Charles V to create the Royal Library, which would later become the Bibliothèque nationale de France, France's national library in Paris. Within his own residence, Charles V included a room for the Conseil du Roi where affairs of state were conducted.  Etiquette  The Hôtel Saint-Pol and other palaces were the sites where the first versions of a royal etiquette at the French court were developed. Charles V, for instance, had his servants dressed in liveries appropriate to the stature of a king of France.  The Hôtel Saint-Pol in the 15th and 16th centuries  Remains of the Saint-Paul church After Charles VII fled to Bourges in 1418, the Hôtel Saint-Pol was abandoned by Charles and his successors. Louis XI preferred the Château de Plessis-lez-Tours, and when visiting Paris stayed at the Château de Vincennes. Charles VIII, Louis XII, and Francis I lived in the Loire Valley or at the Château de Fontainebleau, and the Hôtel Saint-Pol fell into ruin. In 1519, part of it was sold by order of Francis I, and several years later, it was completely demolished. A wall of the church of Saint-Paul, which formed part of the hôtel, survives to this day.

They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine starts as a narrow gallery where all the frass is concentrated. This narrow area quickly widens into a large blotch. The larvae create silk, which they deposit in the mine, causing some length folds to develop. The larvae can be found in May.

He is not only the career leader in almost every major statistical category for the Blazers, but the all-time leading goals and points scorer in CHL history, and one of the leading goal scorers in minor league hockey history. Career Burton played college hockey for the University of Michigan-Dearborn Wolverines, a Division I American Collegiate Hockey Association program below the level of major NCAA collegiate hockey. After graduation, he played in 1992 with the Austrian national team, which finished 1st in the B Pool at the World Championships. Burton was named both the best defensive player of the B Pool tourney and to the pool's all-star squad. He signed with the Oklahoma City Blazers of the CHL for the 1992-93 season—the inaugural year for the revived CHL—and finished 4th in team scoring, while leading the team in goals and points in the playoffs, where the Blazers lost in the finals to their archrivals, the Tulsa Oilers. Burton played eleven seasons in all for Oklahoma City, leading them to nine division titles and championships in 1996 and 2001. He was named a First- or Second Team All-Star every season between 1998 and 2003, and won the Bill Levins Trophy as league Most Valuable Player in 1998 and 2001. Retiring in 2003, Burton sat out one season, and then signed with the United Hockey League's Motor City Mechanics for the 2004-05 season. On a team featuring numerous National Hockey League veterans with the season's lockout -- Chris Chelios, Bryan Smolinski, Derian Hatcher, Mike Fountain and Sean Avery—he nonetheless had twice as many goals as anyone else on the team. It proved to be his final action, and Burton retired for good after the 2005 season. Burton also played in Roller Hockey International for the Oklahoma Coyotes in 1994 and 1995, leading the team in goals both seasons. Legacy Burton is the CHL's all-time leader in both goals (565) and points (985) scored; he had nearly two hundred more goals than the second-most leading goal scorer. He is also 5th in games played and 13th in penalty minutes. At the time of his retirement, he held or shared nineteen different league records. For the minor leagues as a whole, Burton is tied for 9th all time for goals with 601. He is 50th all time in points with 1049. The CHL eventually renamed its trophy for the season's leading scorer in Burton's honor, the Joe Burton Award. (Ironically, Burton himself never led the league in scoring over a season.) He was also the first player inducted into the CHL's Hall of Fame, an honor he received in 2012. He retired to his hometown of Garden City, Michigan, where he manages an ice rink. Coaching Burton spent a single season as player-assistant coach of the Blazers in 1999.

It is located on via Palestro, next to the Galleria d'Arte Moderna, and across from the Giardini Pubblici Indro Montanelli.  History  In 1947 the Municipality of Milan, pressed by the need to find a new exhibition space for contemporary art, focused its attention on the site of Villa Belgioiosa, destroyed by bombing in 1943. It was decided to use the Villa as a site for the Modern Art Gallery, and to build a brand new space exclusively devoted to contemporary art. The design by the architect Ignazio Gardella was preliminarily selected in March 1948, and the Pavilion was inaugurated in 1954. In 1979, PAC reopened after a long period of closure for renovations. In 1993 a bomb destroyed the building (Via Palestro massacre) at a time when Italy was heavily committed in its fight against the Mafia. Gardella subsequently rebuilt the exhibiting space according to the original design, though with key technical improvements. In 1996 PAC resumed its normal activity with an exhibition dedicated to Leo Castelli. Over the past thirty years PAC have organised solo presentations of international artists such as Marina Abramovic, Laurie Anderson, Christian Boltanski, Chen Zhen, Lucio Fontana, Franko B, Regina José Galindo, Alberto Garutti, Jannis Kounellis, Richard Long, Robert Motherwell, Pino Pascali, Cindy Sherman, Yinka Shonibare, Tony Oursler, Jeff Wall and Zhang Huan. In 1994 Maurizio Cattelan presented at the Laure Genillard Gallery in London a sculpture called Lullaby consisting of a blue bag containing debris he collected from PAC after the bombing. The piece is part of the collection of Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo in Turin.

It was Normanised/Anglicised relatively early after the Norman conquest of England. Relatively cut off from the Welsh hinterland, but with coastal links across south Wales and the West Country, the region developed their distinct English dialect which endured to within living memory.  History  Peninsular Gower was geographically insulated from 'mainland' modern language influences until well into the twentieth century. A number of words and pronunciations were recorded during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries as distinct usages in Gower — many of which might once have been widespread but which had fallen out of use in the developing standard English. Some Gower vocabulary seem to derive from the Welsh language (e.g. pentan), but many more of the words and usages are cognate with English country dialects including those of South Devon, Somerset and Wiltshire.

There was a church in the town in the 11th century, but the core of the present building mainly dates from work started in 1474, when the church was rebuilt by William Hastings at the same time that he converted his neighbouring manor house into a castle. The church was refurbished in about 1670 to create more space, but the large and increasing size of the congregation led to further work in 1829, and a major rebuild in 1878–80, including the widening of the nave by the addition of two outer aisles. The sandstone church has a tower at the west end, and its nave is wider than it is long due to the extra Victorian aisles. St Helen's Church has some ancient stained glass at the east end, and the Victorian windows on the nave and towers form a coherent narrative of the life of Jesus. Other fixtures include some important funereal monuments, and a font, pulpit and carved heads by Thomas Earp. The finger pillory is a rare item, once seen as a humane form of punishment. The church has a long association with the Hastings family, its patrons for four centuries, and became a centre for Puritanism under Henry Hastings, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon. The \\"Puritan Earl\\" brought a series of radical figures to the town, including Anthony Gilby and Arthur Hildersham. St Helen's Church is a nationally important building, with a Grade I listing for its exceptional architectural interest. History =Foundation to 1547= 1 St Michael & All Angels Chapel; 2 Lady Chapel; 3 Hastings Chapel; 4 pulpit; 5 Earp font; 6 font There is little documented history of Ashby-de-la-Zouch before the Norman Conquest, although Roman coins were found in the area, and the town's name has both Saxon and Danish elements. It has an entry in the Domesday Book that suggests that it had about 100 inhabitants in 1086, and subsequently grew in importance under its La Zouch and Hastings lords, notably William Hastings.Scott (1907) pp. 1–8.Hillier (1984) pp. 12–15. It is recorded in Domesday that a priest was resident in Ashby, and that the church dedicated to St Helen consisted only of a nave. In about 1144, Philip Beaumains, lord of the Manor of Ashby, granted the church, its lands and revenues to the Augustinian community of Lilleshall Abbey, which retained possession until 1538.Williams (1980) pp. 4–5.Scott (1907) pp. 307–308. A 2013 excavation found evidence of a two-storey vicarage dating from this period, but the building fell into disrepair following the Dissolution of the Monasteries and the site was cleared in the English Civil War of 1642–49. Parts of the current nave and chancel date from the 14th century, but the church was rebuilt and enlarged by William Hastings in 1474, at the same time that he erected the tower of his nearby castle. The new, larger church included a nave with aisles and chapels adjoining the chancel. The tower, Hastings Chapel, and some buttresses and windows still remain from the 15th century. =Reformation and after= The English Reformation inevitably affected St Helen's Church. Edward VI's 1547 injunction decreed that all images in churches were to be dismantled or destroyed, including stained glass, shrines, roods, statues and bells,Haigh (1987) pp. 119–121. and altars were to be replaced by wooden tables.Nye (1965) p. 71. Damage during the Civil War was minimal, although there are pike marks on the stonework. The church may have been fortified as part of the defences of the castle, a Royalist stronghold.Hillier (2010) p. 13. Around 1670, the church was refurbished, a gallery was built at the western end of the nave, and the carved reredos and a large wooden Royal coat of arms, now at the west end of the nave, were acquired at the same time. An inspection report at the end of the 18th century commented on the dirty transept walls, and the need to install the equivalent of a cattle grid to keep pigs out of the churchyard. Rich crimson hangings in the church had earlier attracted the attention of a thief. The increasing congregation led to the replacement of the pews and the construction of galleries down both sides of the building in 1829,Hillier (1984) pp. 22–23. but a more extensive rebuilding was undertaken in 1878–80, by James Piers St Aubyn. The galleries were removed and the two outer aisles were added during this period, a chapel was converted to a vestry and improvements were made to the Hastings Chapel. The cost of these works has been estimated as between £16,000 and more than £18,000 (). Later developments included the expenditure of £13,000 () between 1963 and 1968 to combat deathwatch beetles found during rewiring, improvements to the heating system, and a rededication in 1974, the quincentenary of the church. St Helen's Church is the parish church of the English market town of Ashby-de-la-Zouch in Leicestershire. The parish is currently in the deanery of North West Leicestershire, the Diocese of Leicester and the Province of Canterbury. Retrieved 21 October 2014. Description St Helen's Church has a maximum length of and is aligned at 25° north of east. The majority of English churches have an alignment within a few degrees of east, so this is an exceptionally large deviation from the norm. The sandstone church has a large, mainly 15th-century west tower supported by corner buttresses and topped with battlements and pinnacles. The tower has a four-light window and west doorway, and contains a spiral stairway to the bell and clock chambers and the roof. The chancel is adjoined by the former north chapel (now the vestry) on one side and the Hastings Chapel, set transept-wise on the other; it has three sedilia and a piscina on its northern wall. The nave is significantly wider than it is long, and has four bays with medieval inner north and south aisles and 19th-century outer aisles. The Hastings Chapel, chancel and clerestory are embattled, and the former north chapel is English Perpendicular, with a window of the same style.Pevsner and Williamson (1985) pp. 79–80. The piers in the nave were remodelled in the 15th century, and have incised panels, as do some of the arches. This feature is of an unusual style and is also seen at Sherborne Abbey in Dorset and at St Peter and St Paul, Syston, Leicestershire. The finger pillory The Chapel of St Michael and All Angels and the Lady Chapel are at the east end of the outer north and south aisles respectively,Williams (1980) p. 25. and contain 20 of the 28 stone heads carved by Thomas Earp of Lambeth in 1878–1880, mostly depicting biblical characters such as Salome and John the Baptist, or historical figures like St Helen and Martin Luther. Ten are paired on opposite sides of the five pillars defining the inner edge of the Lady Chapel aisle, and another ten are similarly arranged in the Chapel of St Michael and All Angels. The corbels of the north, west and south doors bear six more heads, those by the west door depicting Queen Victoria and Archbishop Tait; and Jesus and Moses are higher on the corbels of the west window.Williams (1980) pp. 12–15. The clerestory and the wooden roofs of the nave and south inner aisle are 15th century, but the rest of the lead-clad roofing dates from the Victorian rebuilding. St Helen's Church was designated as a Grade I listed building in 1950, recognising it as a building of exceptional interest. It is important not only for the medieval structures that remain, but also for its monuments and fittings. The Victorian restoration is also noted as being of high quality and in keeping with the older parts of the church. =Furnishings and fixtures= Hastings Chapel east window The church had much stained glass in 1622 that disappeared during the Reformation. The current eleven coloured glass windows on the north, west and south sides of the church were erected in 1879 by Lavers, Barraud and Westlake, each being named for its donor; the scenes depicted tell the Life of Christ from the Annunciation to the Last Supper.Scott (1907) pp. 317–326. The stained glass in the chancel and the Hasting Chapel was erected in 1924, and most was once in the castle;Williams (1980) pp. 7–9. the earliest glass is a German, Swiss and Flemish work possibly originally from Farleigh Hungerford. The chancel's east window contains arms of Richard I and Edward I and the south window includes \\"The Magi bearing gifts\\" and the arms of Catherine Parr. The Hastings Chapel south window has several panels from the 15th and 16th centuries, and one which could possibly be as old as the 13th century. The chapel's east window also has some high quality work, including \\"The Last Supper\\". The large west window in the tower is plain glass, as is the clerestory. The organ The rare finger pillory at the west end immobilised offenders without exposing them to the public degradation associated with the stocks.Scott (1907) pp. 347–348. In the centre aisle hangs a large brass candelabrum donated by Leonard Piddocke, High Bailiff of Leicester, in 1733. It is surmounted by a brass dove and was made by William Parsons of London. Some of the branches were stolen in 1776, but soon recovered. The Baroque wooden reredos of 1679, probably by local man Thomas Sabin, has been compared favourably with the work of Christopher Wren and Grinling Gibbons, and the metal screen also made by an Ashby craftsman, John Staley, is also of high quality.Williams (1980) p. 10. There is a Royal Arms from the reign of Charles II high on the west wall of the nave. The alabaster pulpit and octagonal font were made by Earp in 1878–1880. The font is carved from a single block of stone and decorated on each face with Christian symbols, and rests on red granite pillars on a Portland stone base. The pulpit is similarly supported to match the font.Williams (1980) p. 6. A second, smaller font with a panelled stem is in the southwestern corner of the nave. The church contains a pipe organ of uncertain date made by Kirkland of London at their Wakefield branch which opened in 1893. Its most recent restorations were in 1935 and 1955. It has three manuals and a pedalboard, and is described on the National Pipe Organ Register as being of an \\"unusual\\" type. There is a north-facing clock on the tower, and a sundial on the south side which was rediscovered and repaired in 2000. The masonry shows that it was built at the same time as that part of the tower. The tower holds a ring originally of eight bells; the earliest dates back to 1571, but was recast in 1849, and all eight bells were repaired by John Taylor Co in 1886.Scott (1907) pp. 313–314. The bells were repaired and rehung again in 2006 using £42,600 of National Lottery funding awarded from the Heritage Lottery Fund. The tenor bell was recast, and two new trebles were made, bringing the total to ten;Starkey, Julie. St Helen's Church ... a short tour Ashby-de-la-Zouch:St Helen's Church. pp. 2–6. prior to the last recasting, the large tenor bell weighed . =Hastings Chapel and memorials= Alabaster tomb to Francis Hastings, 2nd Earl of Huntingdon The Hastings Chapel contains a number of family monuments, including a large alabaster tomb for Francis Hastings, 2nd Earl of Huntingdon, who died in 1561, and his countess, Catherine.Scott (1907) pp. 330–333. The monument was carved by Joseph Pickford to a design by William Kent. A memorial to Theophilus Hastings, 9th Earl of Huntingdon, who died in 1746, is on the east wall and is by Michael Rysbrack. His widow, Selina, founded a training college for evangelical ministers, and a sculpture of her in mourning, also by Rysbrack, is placed by her husband's memorial. The countess herself is remembered through a large brass plaque in the chancel floor. The larger of two vaults containing the coffins of the Hastings family lies beneath the chancel, and the smaller and older one is under their chapel.Scott (1907) p. 316. The 1474 columns, with the Victorian piers further back. In the background, from left to right, are parts of the chancel, Hastings Chapel and Lady Chapel The Lady Chapel contains a wall memorial to Arthur Hildersham and a painted wooden bust of Margery Wright, who died in 1623. The inscription below records that she had given £43 () to provide gowns for the old and needy of the town.Scott (1907) p. 343–346. The Chapel of St Michael and All Angel has a recumbent alabaster effigy known as \\"the Pilgrim\\". The subject holds a pilgrim's staff and other symbols such as a wide hat with cockle shells. A dog lies at his feet. The 15th-century figure was originally brightly painted, and depicts a person of noble birth. It is believed to represent Thomas, the third brother of William Hastings. A number of carved alabaster memorial slabs were removed when the church was re-pewed in 1829. Only one survives, a memorial to Robert Mundy, who died in 1526, and his two wives, both named Elizabeth; it now stands upright by the west wall.Scott (1907) pp. 327–328. The arch gateway at the western end of the churchyard bears a skull and crossbones at the top of each pillar. The memorials in the churchyard are mainly dated 1750–1850, and most are lined against the churchyard's south wall or are flush with the ground. Some show fine carving, commensurate with commercial success. They include the memorials of French-born wine merchant Jean Gaudin and the Litherland brothers, founders of Royal Crown Derby.Abney-Hastings (2002) pp. 8, 15–18. From 1804, French prisoners of war were quartered in Ashby, and those who died before their release, or who stayed and married local women, are also buried in the churchyard.Scott (1907) pp. 288, 292–295. A group of memorials are for members of a prosperous local family, the Mammatts. Edward Mammatt, church organist for 40 years and a successful scientist despite being blinded at age six, also has a monument in the church, and one of the Victorian windows is dedicated to his widow by their sons.Scott (1907) p. 293.

The Dissolution of the Monasteries led to the transfer of the patronage to Francis Hastings, the 2nd Earl of Huntingdon, and it remained with the Hastings family until 1931, passing then to John G. Shields and his descendants. The names of the vicars are known back to Roger in 1200.Williams (1980) pp. 19–20. Henry Hastings, the third earl, was a zealous promoter of puritanism and founded Ashby Grammar School to provide education in accordance with his religious views. Anthony Gilby had lived in exile in Geneva during the reign of Mary, but was invited to Ashby by the earl and made the town a nationally important centre for radical Protestantism. Attempts by the church authorities to discipline him failed, and he died after 25 years spent preaching and pamphleteering.Cross (1966) pp. 132–135. Hastings' influence meant that between 1562 and 1632 Ashby had a succession of Puritan ministers. The last of these was Arthur Hildersham, another influential figure who sought to internationalise radical Protestantism,Braddick (2009) p. 75. but became vulnerable to the strictures of his bishop after Henry Hastings died in 1595. Hildersham was barred from preaching or deprived of his living for 17 of the 38 years of his incumbency,Cross (1966) pp. 141–142. Earl Henry was interred in St Helen's after a lavish funeral befitting his status as Lord President of the Council of the North.Scott (1907) pp. 96–97. Services and congregation As of 2017, the church is managed as part of the \\"Ashby and Breedon Team Ministry\\", which also includes Holy Trinity, Ashby-de-la-Zouch; The Priory Church of Saint Mary and Saint Hardulph, Breedon on the Hill; St Mary the Virgin, Coleorton; St John's Chapel, Coleorton; All Saints Church, Isley Walton and St Matthew's Church, Worthington. The church operates \\"Little Fishes\\", a mother and toddler group, and its street pastors work in outreach and liaison with the town community. The Ashe lectures, endowed by Francis Ashe in 1654, provided for weekly lectures in the church by a \\"godly, orthodox and ordained minister\\". This was later amended to allow for at least one lecture each year. Twentieth-century lecturers include Geoffrey Fisher, Donald Coggan, Donald Soper and George Carey. Heritage project In 2014, the Heritage Lottery Fund awarded £648,300 to the St Helen's Heritage Project. The grant was to finance a three-year project to build a Heritage Centre opposite the south side of the church. When completed, the Heritage Centre will have a display area, kitchen, rooms for hire and a garden. The church plans to have trained guides and visitor activities, and to offer craft courses in, for example, calligraphy and stone carving. The project's preparatory 2013 archaeological dig that discovered the vicarage ruins also unearthed the remains of a tithe barn, trenches from the Civil War and parts of a causeway, along with smaller domestic items.

He is considered a crossover artist, performing jazz, pop, and classical music. He has been prominent in the film, television, and music industries for five decades, having performed on over 500 movie scores and with over 200 orchestras. He has recorded on numerous Grammy, Academy Award, Emmy, and Golden Globe winning media and soundtracks for artists and composers such as Carol Burnett, Bob Dylan, Barbra Streisand, Mel Torme, Toshiko Akiyoshi, Frank Sinatra, Pat Williams, John Williams, Natalie Cole, Jerry Fielding, Cal Tjader, Marty Paich, and Michael Bublé. Foster received the Most Valuable Player Award for woodwind doubling from The Recording Academy. Early life, education, and influences Gary Foster was born in Leavenworth, Kansas, in 1936. He started on the clarinet at age thirteen. His first musical inspiration was Olin Parker, a school music director and teacher who introduced him to the music of Count Basie, Woody Herman, and many other types of music. He listened closely to the Woody Herman Orchestra's recording of \\"Four Brothers\\", which featured saxophonists Stan Getz, Zoot Sims, and Serge Chaloff. For Foster, Getz stood out on the tenor saxophone because of his tone. Foster also acknowledged the influence of Lester Young and Charlie Parker. Jazz critic Zan Stewart compared Foster's style to that of Lee Konitz, Paul Desmond, and Art Pepper (West Coast Jazz style). The music of Lennie Tristano and the concepts taught to him by Warne Marsh have been of great inspiration and influence over the years. His earliest professional experience was at age of fifteen, playing VFW Hall dances with bassist Harold Stanford. After high school, Foster studied at Central College in Fayette, Missouri, then transferred to the University of Kansas, where he studied classical clarinet and music education. He studied musicology and conducting in graduate school. At the University of Kansas, he played with trumpeter Carmell Jones. Professional career In 1961, Foster moved to Los Angeles to work as a jazz musician. He taught privately and studied the flute. Shortly after settling in Alhambra, he turned to studio work as a woodwind doubler. His friendships with Clare Fischer and Warne Marsh were vital to Foster's knowledge of improvisation. From 1973–1982, he was a member of the Toshiko Akiyoshi – Lew Tabackin Big Band. He worked in the reed sections of big bands led by Louis Bellson, Mike Barone, Clare Fischer, Marty Paich, and Ed Shaughnessy. He has also worked with Rosemary Clooney, Shelly Manne, Sammy Nestico, Poncho Sanchez, and Cal Tjader. For over 45 years he has made his living in studios, recording on albums and for movies and television. His movie credits include Monsters, Inc., Ice Age, Elf, Meet the Fockers, and The Haunted Mansion. His television credits date back to the late 1960s and include several seasons on The Carol Burnett Show, which won several Emmy Awards. He has been in the Academy Awards Television Orchestra for thirty broadcasts. He has performed regularly with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, the Los Angeles Opera Orchestra, and the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra. Teaching and education career Foster has taught privately and in colleges since 1960. From 1971 to 1991 he was on the faculty at Pasadena City College. From 1984 through 2000 he was visiting professor at the University of Missouri, Kansas City. He was on the faculty of University of California, Los Angeles and California State University, Fullerton. He founded Nova Music Studios in Pasadena for private lessons. He has co-authored method books and has led clinics in colleges and universities.

It was the first comic of this type to be published by a mainstream publisher. Edited by Denis Kitchen, Comix Book featured work by such underground luminaries as Justin Green, Kim Deitch, Trina Robbins, Art Spiegelman, and S. Clay Wilson. While it did not depict the explicit content that was often featured in underground comix, it was more socially relevant than anything Marvel had previously published.Sabin, Roger (1996). \\"Going underground\\". Comics, Comix & Graphic Novels: A History Of Comic Art. London, United Kingdom: Phaidon Press. pp. 92–128.  Publication history  In 1973, Marvel publisher Stan Lee became attracted to the energy and cutting-edge art styles of the underground comix movement (which, ironically, by this period was already beginning to wane). Interested in capitalizing on the genre, Lee approached artist and Kitchen Sink Press publisher Denis Kitchen about packaging an underground-style publication for Marvel. Lee requested only that contributors would submit significantly less explicit work, appropriate for newsstands sales.Sabin, Roger (1996). \\"Comical comics\\".

(TwoMorrows Publishing, 2005), pp. 100–106. insisted that Comix Book not carry the Marvel name, instead being released by Magazine Management Co. (a Marvel Comics company). Lee himself was only credited on the masthead as \\"instigator.\\" He and Kitchen agreed to produce a black-and-white oversize magazine similar to that of the contemporaneous Marvel imprint Curtis Magazines. As with the Curtis publications, the format allowed Marvel to dispense with the restrictions of the Comics Code Authority, thereby creating a freer creative space more akin to the no-holds-barred ethos of the underground. In addition, like most underground comics, Comix Book carried no advertising. Kitchen was also able to win a number of unprecedented concessions for his contributors, including the return of all artwork, and eventually allowing artists to keep their copyrights. Comix Book #1 was launched with a cover-date of Oct. 1974. In addition to comics, issues of Comix Book usually featured text pieces like Kitchen editorials, interviews, and a letters page. Unfortunately, Comix Book either failed to find its audience, was mishandled by baffled newsstand distributors, or both. Lee cancelled the book when issue #3 hit the newsstands. Kitchen, however, had assembled two additional issues. After a year of negotiations, he persuaded Marvel to let his own Kitchen Sink Press publish issues #4 and 5 in 1976. The Best of Comix Book: When Marvel Went Underground collection was published in December 2013 by the Kitchen Sink Books imprint of Dark Horse Comics. The collection contains an essay by James Vance and introductions by both Kitchen and Stan Lee.

His final monograph, Forgotten Connections: On Culture and Upbringing, is available in English translation.Information on the text is available at: http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415714013/  Biography  Klaus Mollenhauer graduated from school in 1948, and then attended the College of Education in Göttingen, and working from 1950 to 1952 as an elementary school teacher in Bremen. He then studied education, history, psychology, literature and sociology in Hamburg and Göttingen. In 1958 he completed his PhD under the supervision of Erich Weniger, with his doctoral dissertation on \\"The Social Origins of the industrial society.” Winkler, M. (2002) Klaus Mollenhauer.

Mollenhauer then worked as a postdoctoral assistant to Erich Weniger and Henry Roth before 1962 as a Lecturer at the Free University of Berlin went and was appointed in 1965 as an associate professor at the Berlin Pedagogical Institute. In 1966 he was appointed full professor of Education at the University of Kiel, where he was also the director of the Pedagogical Seminary (or Department). From 1969 to 1972 Mollenhauer was Professor of Education at the University of Frankfurt am Main, and in Göttingen from 1972 until his retirement in 1996.See: Translator’s Introduction: Culture and upbringing in theory and practice. Forgotten Connections: On Culture and Upbringing. (Klaus Mollenhauer. Norm Friesen, ed. & transl.). London: Routledge.  Forgotten Connections  Mollenhauer’s Forgotten Connections: On Culture and Upbringing (2014) is internationally regarded as one of the most important German contributions to educational and curriculum theory in the 20th century. It has been translated into Norwegian, Swedish, Korean, Japanese, Spanish and Dutch.See: http://www.culture-and- upbringing.com/index.php/Main_Page#About_this_Website The text focuses on five principal questions, with each corresponding to one or more key terms from the text (some of which elude direct translation): #Why do we want to have children? (Upbringing and Bildung) #What way of life do I present to children by living with them? (Presentation) #What way of life ought to be systematically represented to children? (Representation) #How can I help children/young people to become self-starters and support their growth? (Bildsamkeit; Self-Activity) #Who am I? Who do I want to be, and how do I help others with their identity problems? (Identity) Norm Friesen and Tone Sævi explain that these questions are not meant to be \\"answered\\" in some simple or direct sense; instead, they are to challenge students to discussion and personal reflection: :These questions are intended to address the students both personally and collectively, and to prompt reflection, contemplation, and dialogue about their pre-understandings and orientations. In this sense, these questions are attempts to challenge students to grapple with educational issues in existential terms, in which experience and existence are prior to theory and to essence, and in which how one 'is' (ontology) is primary to what one knows (epistemology).Friesen, N. & Sævi, T.

Journal of Curriculum Studies, 142(1), 123-147. http://learningspaces.org/n/papers/Reviving_Forgotten_Connections.pdf Mollenhauer supports his readers in reflecting on and grappling with these questions through reference to cultural and historical examples and illustrations. These range from medieval woodcuts through philosophical texts to contemporary works of fiction, including Augustine's Confessions, Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations, and Thomas Bernhard's novels and stories.For a discussion of some of these sources in the context of Mollenhauer's writing, see: Friesen, N. & Hamelock, M.

In electronics, the Zener effect (employed most notably in the appropriately named Zener diode) is a type of electrical breakdown, discovered by Clarence Melvin Zener. It occurs in a reverse biased p-n diode when the electric field enables tunneling of electrons from the valence to the conduction band of a semiconductor, leading to numerous free minority carriers which suddenly increase the reverse current. Mechanism Under a high reverse-bias voltage, the p-n junction's depletion region widens which leads to a high-strength electric field across the junction.\\"Zener and Avalanche Breakdown/Diodes\\", School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University Sufficiently strong electric fields enable tunneling of electrons across the depletion region of a semiconductor, leading to numerous free charge carriers. This sudden generation of carriers rapidly increases the reverse current and gives rise to the high slope conductance of the Zener diode. Relationship to the avalanche effect The Zener effect is distinct from avalanche breakdown. Avalanche breakdown involves minority carrier electrons in the transition region being accelerated, by the electric field, to energies sufficient for freeing electron-hole pairs via collisions with bound electrons. The Zener and the avalanche effect may occur simultaneously or independently of one another. In general, diode junction breakdowns occurring below 5 volts are caused by the Zener effect, whereas breakdowns occurring above 5 volts are caused by the avalanche effect. Breakdowns occurring at voltages close to 5V are usually caused by some combination of the two effects. Zener breakdown voltage is found to occur at electric field intensity of about . Zener breakdown occurs in heavily doped junctions (p-type semiconductor moderately doped and n-type heavily doped), which produces a narrow depletion region. The avalanche breakdown occurs in lightly doped junctions, which produce a wider depletion region. Temperature increase in the junction increases the contribution of the Zener effect to breakdown, and decreases the contribution of the avalanche effect.

Reynolds also saw time in the outfield and as a starting pitcher, while hitting a career .223 batting average. Basically a line drive hitter, she put the ball in play and was extremely hard to strike out, averaging a 1.50 walk-to-strikeout ratio and a .317 on-base percentage during her five years in the circuit.The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League: A Biographical Dictionary – W.

Nicknamed ″Windy″, because of her constant chatter on the field and from the dugout, she was chosen as the team's captain and eventually served as interim manager. In 1947, Reynolds hit a career-best .245 average with a .935 fielding percentage at third base and earned a spot in the All-Star team. Her most productive season on the mound came in 1948, when she posted a 9–6 and a 2.27 earned run average in 18 pitching appearances. She also was the best fielding pitcher in 1950 as she committed no errors.

There were 36 Ottoman Sultans who ruled over the Empire, and each one was a direct descendant through the male line of the first Ottoman Sultan, Sultan Osman I. After the deposition of the last Sultan, Mehmet VI, in 1922, and the subsequent abolition of the Ottoman Caliphate in 1924, members of the Imperial family were forced into exile. Their descendants now live in many different countries throughout Europe, as well as in the United States, the Middle East, and since they have now been permitted to return to their homeland, many now also live in Turkey. When in exile, the family adopted the surname of Osmanoğlu , meaning \\"son of Osman\\", after the founder of the House of Osman and direct ancestor of all current family members.  Heads of the House of Osman since 1923  The Ottoman dynasty was exiled from Turkey in 1924. The female members of the dynasty were allowed to return after 1951, and the male members after 1973.

A Sultan's descendant in the heart of London Turkish citizenship Without exception, all high-ranking members of the Imperial Ottoman family were exiled in 1924. Most had never left their homeland before, and all were forced to make a new life abroad. The family departed from Sirkeci railway station, and would disperse across Europe, the United States and the Middle East. In exile, the family lived in poverty. As the former Ottoman Sultan Mehmed VI Vahideddin had settled in San Remo, many members of the family congregated in the South of France. After living in Switzerland for a short time, the last Caliph of Islam, Imperial Prince (Şehzade) Abdulmecid II, also moved to the French Riviera, settling in Nice. The Turkish Republic had issued the exiled Ottoman family members with travel documents but they were only valid for one year. Therefore, by 1925 members of the family were no longer able to travel. Prince (Şehzade) Ali Vâsib Efendi appealed to the French Government and succeeded in obtaining courtesy passports for them. The French Government also issued passports to the children of the members of the family who were born in exile. In the years since the exile was lifted, many members of the Ottoman family have obtained Turkish citizenship and hold Turkish passports.  Imperial Princes (Şehzades) of the House of Osman  The formal way of addressing the male descendants of the Ottoman Sultans is Devletlu Necabetlu Şehzade Sultan (given name) Hazretleri Efendi, i.e. Sultan Imperial Prince (given name).

The band has been reported on by The New York Times, USA Today, The Washington Post, Forbes, NorthJersey.com, and KGW. The band has also been profiled by Lifetime Television and thinkMTV.com. N.E.D. was the subject of a 2013 documentary, No Evidence of Disease, produced by Spark Media. History The band formed to play at the annual medical conference of the Ovarian Cancer National Alliance in 2008 and decided that it should be more than just a side project. Their musical style is influenced by U2, Alison Krauss and Union Station, Foo Fighters, Rush, Weezer, and Natalie Merchant. One of the goals of the band is to increase awareness and education about women's cancers. \\"GYN cancers are not things people talk about in our culture, and they’re woefully underfunded and misunderstood\\", John Boggess commented against The Washington Post. \\"We really believe that we’re starting a conversation. Because there are worse things than getting cancer, and that’s feeling isolated and without help and understanding.\\" Their song lyrics deal with issues of hope and survival, as well as partying and relationships. The band members have the case studies that show that music therapy is beneficial to the healing of cancer patients, and that is the band's mission. Documentary A 2013 documentary about the band, also titled No Evidence of Disease, was directed by Andrea Kalin. The film is about the life of the band as well as their patients, their families, and cancer awareness advocates. Education and Advocacy N.E.D. is an official part of Marjorie J.

The station signed on as call letters WTLK-FM on September 30, 1996, and was known as Real Radio 106.5, with a Hot Talk format.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1996/R&R-1996-10-04.pdf; The most notable event during this part of the station's history was the return of The Greaseman to Jacksonville's airwaves. (Ironically, the Greaseman's previous time in Jacksonville had been on WAPE when it was on AM 690 (the current home of WOKV)). The Greaseman Show aired 6-10AM weekdays. Numerous nationally syndicated shows filled the 10AM- noon slot including hosts Mike Walker, Alan Keyes and Bo Gritz. \\"The Judy Jarvis Show\\" aired between noon and 3PM, The Don and Mike Show from 3-7 PM, The Tom Leykis Show from 7-10PM, \\"Ferrall on the Bench\\" with Scott Ferrall from 10PM-1AM and Joey Reynolds aired overnights from 1-6. Weekend programming consisted of classic rock music provided by Westwood One's syndicated \\"Adult Rock & Roll\\" format. WTLK flipped to classic rock at 3 p.m. on January 16, 1998, becoming known as Big 106.5, and changing to the WBGB call letters in March 1998.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1998/RR-1998-01-23.pdf At this time, the station was owned by Clear Channel Communications. The format change began with a 10,000 commercial-free song launch that ended on February 18, 1998. That morning, former WPLA and WNZS part-time air personality Randy Clemens became the first live local DJ on the station with program director Steve Fox handling afternoon drive. The remaining dayparts were filled by Westwood One air talent, including Jeff Gonzer, Terry Gladstone, Tony Scott, Frazer Smith and Mackenzie Rae. WBGB was divested by Clear Channel, along with sister stations WZNZ, WZAZ, and WJGR, in the fall of 1999 to Concord Media Group. From there, it came under the ownership of Jacor, who in turn sold the station to Caron Broadcasting (a division of Salem Communications) in 2003. Caron then flipped WBGB to Contemporary Christian, branding the station as 106.5 The Promise. On July 6, 2006, Salem Communications entered into an agreement to sell WBGB to Cox Media Group for $7.7 million in cash. The last day the station broadcast as 106.5 The Promise was Monday, September 18, 2006. The format then moved to non-commercial religious broadcaster 88.1 WCRJ, which adopted The Promise name as well as a number of on-air staffers. On the afternoon on Tuesday, September 19, WBGB began stunting, letting listeners know that The Promise had moved to 88.1, and promising something \\"new and exciting\\" to come to 106.5 on Thursday, September 21. The new format of WBGB, a simulcast of talk station WOKV, was revealed on Cox's Investor Relations website on September 20. On May 1, 2013, the FM simulcast was transferred to 104.5 FM (formerly WFYV-FM). The move expanded its broadcast coverage area from Brunswick, Georgia south to Daytona Beach, Florida, southwest to Gainesville, Florida and west to Lake City, Florida. The simulcast on 106.5 FM continued for a short time as the station told listeners about the change. 106.5 FM officially dropped from the simulcast on May 23 at Midnight, and flipped to Urban AC as \\"Hot 106.5\\". The new format launched with a marathon playing of 10,000 songs in a row, which began with \\"P.Y.T.\\" by Michael Jackson.http://formatchange.com/hot-106-5-jacksonville-debuts/ The station changed its call sign to WHJX on the same day.

Biography The daughter of the keeper of the old Ferry Boat tavern, Abbey Street, Dublin, she married a lodger in his house, a Captain Gregory, commander of a vessel engaged in the trade between Dublin and Bordeaux. After the death by drowning of her husband, followed by the death of her father, she went to London in 1753. She became an actress first under the name of Mrs Gregory, and then as Mrs Fitzhenry after her second marriage to Edward Fitzhenry, an Irish barrister, with whom she had two children. Edward practised law at the Inner Temple, London. He died in 1772. Around 1774, she retired from acting to live with her children. She may have returned to the stage about 1782-3, and acted successfully many of her old parts. She then finally retired, and is said to have died at Bath, Somerset in 1790. The date and place are doubted by John Genest, a resident in Bath, who thinks there is a confusion between her and Mrs. Fitzmaurice, who died in Bath about the same time.

The British captured her in August of the same year. She served briefly in November as a privateer out of Saint John, New Brunswick under the name Brunswicker before being laid up that same month. She was sold in 1815. Commodore Barry The US government bought this schooner on 20 March 1812 for US $4100 from Stephen Mitchell of Sag Harbor, New York. On 31 April Daniel Elliot of East Machias, Maine, received a commission as a revenue cutter master, and brought the vessel back to eastern Maine. The schooner was stationed at Eastport, on Passamaquoddy Bay under the control of the local customs collector, Lemuel Trescott, and engaged in anti-smuggling operations.US Coast Guard History Program Capture and captured Commodore Barry on 3 August in the Little River, Bay of Fundy, together with three privateer schooners, Madison, Olive, and Spence (or Spruce). Each of the schooners was armed with two guns. Before the British captured the vessels many men from their crews escaped to batteries they had erected on shore and armed with guns from their vessels. The Americans resisted, inflicting some casualties, and then fled. Still, the British captured some men on Commodore Barry who remained prisoners of war until paroled in June 1813.Wells (1998). The crew of Spartan received prize money for Commodore Barry in July 1820. Brunswicker In November, the provincial authorities in Saint John, New Brunswick bought the Commodore Barry for protection against American privateers. By this point the vessel was re- rigged as a sloop, but it is unclear when this happened. On 19 November she sailed on a cruise with the 4-gun schooner . Together, they chased four American privateers from Passamaquoddy Bay. For this cruise Brunswickers crew consisted of 20 volunteers from Saint John. The province laid the sloop up on 24 November, but sailed her again in the spring of 1813.Snider (1928), p.228. Apparently the vessel had been very expensive to operate and with the Royal Navy asserting its dominance in the region by 1813, her services were no longer required. Fate The authorities in Saint John auctioned off Brunswicker on 4 July 1815, for £730. She had been in custody for 770 days.

It is host to one known planet: the Jupiter-like Kepler-14b. The star system was identified by Kepler as a possible planetary host, but when imaging revealed that Kepler-14 was a binary star system and not a single star, the confirmation process became protracted. The stars are separated by at least 280 AU, and the stars complete an orbit around a common center of mass every 2800 years. Both stars are larger than the Sun. They are of similar absolute magnitudes; however, the primary star is brighter as seen from Earth. Observational history The Palomar Observatory confirmed findings suggesting that Kepler-14 was a binary star. Kepler-14 was identified as a possible host to a planet during the first four months of Kepler's operational data, which began when NASA launched the satellite in April 2009. Kepler-14 was provisionally designated KOI-98. Because Kepler-14's transit signal seemed to imply that the possible planet had a short orbit and a clear effect on Kepler-14's brightness, the Kepler science team forwarded the candidate to the Kepler Follow-up Program (KFOP). KFOP used the Fibre-fed Échelle Spectrograph (FIES) on the Nordic Optical Telescope to measure Kepler-14's radial velocity in October 2009. Other radial velocity measurements were collected using W.M. Keck Observatory. The FIES and Keck data, combined with speckle imaging data from WIYN Observatory and near-infrared adaptive optics measurements at Palomar Observatory and the MMT Observatory, revealed that Kepler-14 was actually a close binary star, something that radial velocity data alone could not recognize. Because of this new discovery, further investigation of Kepler-14 was postponed until after the publishing of the first five new Kepler planets (the ones orbiting Kepler-4, Kepler-5, Kepler-6, Kepler-7, and Kepler-8). Analysis of the data revealed that, of the two component stars in the Kepler-14 system, both stars are of nearly equal magnitude, although one of the stars was fainter. The brighter star was designated the \\"A\\" component, and the fainter star received the \\"B\\" designation. The transit signal was observed in orbit around the A component of the system, meaning that the planetary candidate would be in orbit of the primary star of Kepler-14. This was confirmed on August 7, 2010, when the Infrared Array Camera on the Spitzer Space Telescope observed Kepler-14 to gather photometric data. Analysis of both the Spitzer photometric data and the radial velocity data confirmed the idea of a planet as the source of the transit signal. The planet was designated Kepler-14b, and this was published alongside the data and research on Kepler-14 in a June 2011 paper. Kepler-14's nature as a close binary star was almost missed by the astronomers, and would not have been known if high- resolution imaging of the star had not been undertaken. The Kepler team acknowledged that a number of transiting planets' host stars may have actually been close visual binaries, and that the assumed characteristics of the stars and their planets may be incorrect. As a result of their studies into Kepler-14, the Kepler team suggested the implementation of a high-resolution imaging campaign to re-examine transiting planet hosts, an effort which would require only a modest amount of telescope time. Characteristics Kepler-14 is a binary star whose two components are separated by at least 280 astronomical units, or the distance between the Earth and Sun. The estimated orbital period of the Kepler-14 binary system is approximated at 2800 years. The two stars are of nearly equal brightness, but the primary component is slightly brighter as it has a more visible apparent magnitude, or its brightness as seen from Earth. The primary star has an estimated mass of 1.51 times that of the Sun, and the secondary has an estimated mass of 1.39 times the Sun's mass. The Kepler-14 system is 980 parsecs (3,196 light years) from Earth. It has an apparent magnitude of 12.12, and thus cannot be seen with the unaided eye. Because Kepler-14 is so close-knit as seen from Earth, it was impossible for the discovery team to separate the two stars and analyze their characteristics as separate stars. The Kepler team analyzed their characteristics under the assumption that Kepler-14 was a single star. If Kepler-14 were a single star, it would be an F-type star with a mass of 1.512 times the Sun's, and a size that is 2.048 times the Sun's radius. As a single star, the effective temperature of Kepler-14 would be 6395 K, much hotter than the Sun, and the star's iron content would be 0.12, or 132% the amount found in the Sun. Assuming that Kepler-14's two stars formed at about the same time, their gyrochronological ages would be approximately 2.2 billion years. Planetary system Artistic simulation of Kepler-14b and its host star Kepler-14b is a Jupiter-like planet in the orbit of the primary star of Kepler-14. The planet is 8.4 times Jupiter's mass, the equivalent of 2670 times Earth's mass. The planet is slightly larger than Jupiter at 1.14 Jupiter radii The density of Kepler-14b is , the second densest planet confirmed by the Kepler spacecraft after Kepler-10b. Kepler-14b completes an orbit every 6.79 days with a slightly irregular orbit indicated by its orbital eccentricity of 0.035. Radial velocity measurements of host star did not reveal any additional planets as in 2018.

He was born in La Plata, but now lives in London. He has three children, Susana, Clara, David. His son, David Portugheis, is a composer and photographer. Both Portugheis' parents came from Jewish families. His mother, Catalina, was born in Argentina of Romanian and Russian descent, from her mother and father, respectively. Her family was originally German, but emigrated from Eastern Europe during World War I. Several of Alberto Portugheis' family members perished in the two World Wars. His father, Simon Portugheis, was a Romanian (Bessarabian)Dear Ahed: the Game of War and a Path to Peace, by Alberto Portugheis; of Portuguese origin, hence the family name. His side of the family, all living siblings included, had arrived in Argentina from Romania just before World War II. Historically, ancestors on his father's side of the family had lived in Holland and Portugal. Through marriages, Alberto Portugheis has Polish, Lithuanian, Israeli, Brazilian and American relatives. Thus, he grew up in a family that was a mix of various nationalities and origins. Since his early childhood, Portugheis showed a talent for, and a great interest in music. By the age of three, he was picking out instrumental, vocal and orchestral music on the piano and by six and a half, he had learned to read music. He told Tim Stein in a 1995 interview for Classical Piano of the time his father sold some chairs to a piano teacher and how he asked her if he could try out her piano, saying, 'She became my first teacher, until I was 13, when she thought that she had taught me everything she knew.'Classical Piano May/June 1995: The Restaurateur Portugheis then studied for five years with Vincenzo Scaramuzza (the teacher of Martha Argerich and Bruno Leonardo Gelber), before going on to the Geneva Conservatoire. Tim Stein records that Portugheis ended up in Geneva by a \\"rather circuitous route\\", explaining that he was first selected by the Argentine University as a representative in Germany. Portugheis was to give concerts and introduce people to Argentinian music. Portugheis told Stein that he didn't want to go back home until having visited the grave of his idol, Dinu Lipatti, in Geneva, and that this journey abroad provided him with that opportunity. While on this visit, Portugheis met Lipatti's widow, Madeleine. He recalled to Stein that she 'was able to pass on a lot of Dinu's ideas, not only musical ideas but ways of practising and his whole approach to music; transmitting the feeling of a composer and, perhaps unique in his time, a reverence for the musical text.' Portugheis' time at the Conservatoire gave him an opportunity to meet the septuagenarian pianist Youra Guller, a student of Isidor Philipp in Paris who also performed with Pablo Casals and Joseph Szigeti. Portugheis told Stein that although Guller was not a born teacher, she had 'sufficient time and patience' to show him 'the secret of her art'. He described this as 'how to respect the rhythm of a text and how to use the left hand as a strict conductor above all else'. Portugheis said she stressed to him that 'every single note had something to say.' Enthusiasm for music has led Portugheis to a dedicated study of the piano and his life as an international concert pianist, while the horrors experienced by his family led to his work for peace. He tells in his book, Dear Ahed: the Game of War and a Path to PeaceDear Ahed: The Game of War and a Path to Peace, by Alberto Portugheis; page 363 that his family \\"escaped from Eastern Europe between 1935 and 1940\\" and that not one day of his childhood passed without hearing of the horrors they experienced. Now, in addition to his career on the concert platform, he works for peace. =Study= Howard Smith records, in Music Vision Daily, May 2009: > While preparing for life as an assiduous musician, Portugheis first studied > in Buenos Aires with Vincenzo Scaramuzza, who also taught Martha Argerich; > in Geneva with Madeleine Lipatti, Louis Hiltbrand and Youra Guller. In > London he also had the occasional lesson (before she moved to New York) with > the Hungarian Ilona Kabos and attended a Masterclass at Dartington Summer > School, with Polish pianist Andre Tchaikowsky, who did not usually give > lessons. When based in London he also had occasional lessons from Glock and > Maria Curcio, playing the Classical repertoire to them – both of whom were > disciples of Artur Schnabel. Alberto Portugheis was the only Europe-based pianist to play in the concert \\"Homage to V Scaramuzza\\" at the Colon Theatre on August 14, 2002. He features in a film on DVD, The Work of the Master (Scaramuzza's teaching life) directed by Nicolás Borenstein, to be released in 2011. Career Alberto Portugheis After winning first prize at the Geneva Concours de Virtuosité in June 1964, Portugheis embarked upon an international career, visiting nearly 50 countries, performing in solo and chamber music concerts as well as being a soloist with many international orchestras, including the Royal Philharmonic, London Symphony, London Mozart Players, English Chamber, Suisse Romande, Lausanne Chamber, Paris and Israel Sinfoniettas, Filarmónica de Buenos Aires, Nacional de Argentina, and Sofia Philharmonic, among others. Portugheis returns regularly to Argentina, where in 2008 he performed Beethoven's Piano Concerto No3. at the Usuahia International Music Festival under the baton of Maestro Jorge Uliarte with Concertmaster Götz Bernau. Portugheis has also studied the violin and conducting.London Mozart Players 1985 Philharmonia December 1985 =Master classes= Portugheis’ annual Masterclasses at Steinway Hall attract a wealth of talent from many countries in the world.Beethoven Violin and Piano Sonata Cycle@ The Forge Professor Hovhannes Pilikian states in Exceptional Music Concerts under the heading of 'The Maestro and his First Class \\"Students\\"' that four of Portugheis' piano \\"students\\" presented in a concert –Clare Jones, Katalin Csillagh, Jovanni de Pedro, Blagoy Filipov– are \\" already technically speaking masters of the keyboard – each a concert pianist of virtuosic proportions\\". Pilikian comments that \\"any one of them alone would bring honor to a teacher and their national cultures\\". Ksenija Ristic, Katalin Csillagh,Katalin Csillagh's Website Gloria Campaner, and Spanish pianist Daniel Bland list Portugheis as one of their teachers. Pilikian wrote of his approach: > \\"Cultured and compassionate, the Maestro is a gentle soul, always with a > smile, an unassuming human being--Like Jesus washing the desert-worn feet of > his disciples, it is rather moving to witness Maestro Portugheis sitting > next to his piano students as a page-turner... turning the pages of their > musical scores with a profound paternal affection\\".Professor Hovhanness I. > Pilikian on Exceptional Music Concerts. Nov. 2008. Repertoire and recordings Portugheis' repertoire is very wide, extending from the Baroque--including his own transcriptions--to the music of today: several compositions have been specially written for him. His recordings include: * 4 Chopin Ballades * Alfred Nieman 2nd Sonata * Ginastera complete piano music and chamber music with piano *Khachaturian Piano Concerto with the London Symphony Orchestra * Khachaturian solo works * Rachmaninov and Shostakovitch cello and piano sonatas; and * a CD entirely dedicated to the piano music of Rossini. Reception In May 1982, a review by Hector Coda, in La Nación, writes: > The spirits of the entire audience were raised with Chopin's Polonaise in A > flat Op.53, with moments of real identification with the epic exaltation of > the Genius of Poland. Very much applauded, Portugheis offered as an encore a > Mazurka by his much remembered teacher, Vincenzo Scaramuzza. Musical Opinion reviewed his 70th Birthday concert, speaking of \\"Portugheis' searching and highly characterised performance, rife with mercurial shifts of mood\\".Musical Opinion Limited May/Jun 2011 The reviewer comments that \\"Portugheis has a strong affinity for the Romantics\\" while pointing out that he is \\"best known for his championing of Latin American composers like Ginestera and recent contemporary figures\\". On July 4, 2010, for instance, Portugheis had demonstrated his \\"championing of Latin American Music\\" in an acclaimed concert, where Martha Argerich joined him at the King's Place, London. There an array of world class musicians from Britain, America, Hungary, Romania, Israel and Lebanon paid tribute to Argentina and its music. Most of the programme consisted of works with a strong Argentine flavour. Dr. David McAughtry reviewed lunchtime concert, at St James's Piccadilly, in London on July 27, 2011, saying, \\"Portugheis, at 70 is a serious man--a piano virtuoso, teacher, and tireless antiwar campaigner, a Nobel peace prize nominee. He played \\"Claire de Lune\\" with huge tenderness as the expression of a lifetime of experience, not all of it good. I found it inexpressibly moving. I could have died then, and felt I understood something, and at the end of the piece my eyes were filled with tears. The pianist sat for a few seconds, shook his head slightly, and got up to receive the applause. I wondered as he stood, if he really had the ability to evoke great emotions in his listeners, while being dispassionate himself. He sat down again, and as he wiped his eyes before starting the next piece, I realized that he had been crying too\\". Reviewing a 2000 recital at the Regent Hall, Malcolm Miller wrote of Portugheis' \\"arresting and resonant tone\\", describing it as being \\"somewhat reminiscent of the school of Myra Hess or DinuLipati\\".Musical Opinion January 1, 2000 Applauding Portugheis in Recital at a December 31, 2002 Concert of \\"Latin American Blend\\", Miller commented that his playing demonstrated \\"especial crystalline articulation and beautifully supple phrasing\\", adding that \\"in Portugheis's hands, the music overflowed with vitality, its myriad of colours, rhythmic lilt and syncopated energy radiating a Latin American blend of joy and longing.\\" Professional associations Alberto Portugheis is co- Founder and vice-chairman of the Beethoven Piano Society of Europe, vice- chairman of the International Society for the Study of Tension in Performance, vice-president of the European Piano Teachers' Association, co-founder of the Asociación Latinoamericana de Pianistas y Pedagogos and founder and director of Opus Musica and Opus Musica's sister organisation, Opus Books. In 1997, Alberto Portugheis co-founded the Iberian & Latin American Music Society (ILAMS) and was its chairman for ten years, though he has now stepped down from the chair and is no longer directly associated with ILAMS. ILAMS was established in London in 1998 with the aim to promote the music of Spain, Portugal and the whole of Latin America. The Society's aim is to raise awareness of the cultures involved, in particular, their classical repertoires with a variety of activities every year. Philanthropy Peace Meeting with Mayor of La Plata Portugheis presenting his book to Mayor of La Plata Having heard, since early childhood, stories of the horrors of war, Alberto Portugheis became a committed anti-war campaigner, persistently writing and speaking against militarism. His vision is set out in his book, Dear Ahed: The Game of War and a Path to Peace. The book is dedicated to his late father, Simon Portugheis, who fueled his son's disapproval of war and militarism and inspired his quest for a way to achieve lasting worldwide peace. Alberto Portugheis has combined his world travels with an active pursuit of peace. At the basis of his vision is tolerance of all people throughout the world. He stresses that every human being has a right to a world free from war, pointing out that this is inscribed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but not observed by any of the countries that signed the Declaration. He argues that there is no solution to conflict while we continue to accept a militarized world, stressing that \\"weapons for peace do not exist\\". He wants to see the abolition of weapons, and as a consequence, the universal disbanding of all Armed Forces. The way forward to peace, he writes, is to understand that those in power have a vested interest in conflict. He demonstrates how experts in \\"mind control\\" help politicians organize chaos, violence and war as they create techniques to arouse epidemic fear in the population before offering protection from what they have themselves created. He says, \\"my interest lies in educating people, in making them think and understand why we do not have a world at Peace. Together we can create a new economic system for the world that will not depend on the weapon business.\\" John Leech, a leading member of the Federal Trust and author of Asymmetries of Conflict: War Without Death,Asymmetries of Conflict: War without Death, by John Leech; writes, \\"The whole book, Dear Ahed: The Game of War and a Path to Peace, is a testament of love. It speaks of the wounds Portugheis has suffered by taking all the world's anguish and misery into his enormously receptive heart. The map of suffering created and 'contrived' by giant adversaries is also the chart of his own calvary among millions of afflicted people. It is not necessary to agree with every word of his homilies to understand and be pierced by his chilling message.\\" Professor Pilikian notes that Portugheis \\"tirelessly raises funds for the education of very poor children of the AmaZon Art charity founded by a virtuoso young Brazilian cellist, Diego Carneiro\\". Other passions Portugheis shares a passion for food with Rossini Portugheis shares his passion for food with the great Italian composer Gioacchino Rossini. He told Johnny Black of CD Classics that his world travels as a concert pianist \\"was the most valuable experience\\" that he could have had to fuel an interest in good food.CD Classics 1995 For many years, this multi- faceted man practised his passion for cooking, becoming not only the Head-Chef of various restaurants, but also presenting international gastronomic festivals. Boardoom magazine, records him as a \\"leading Chef\\" involved in a two-week festival of charcuterie at the Manor Gate restaurant in London.Boardroom magazine, p. 67. 1995 Document of an article in the local Kensington paper of the day, records that he has become the chef of the Majestic Hotel in Cromwell Road and that he had moved there from the John Howard Hotel in Queensgate, London Entered 18 Sept 1989 at 14:29 by Alasdair An interview in CD Classics, 1989, also records this move, saying, that Portugheis was torn between the worlds of music and cooking. As he traveled the world, Portugheis was enjoying the local food of each country he visited, though he attributes his love of food to his mother, who gave him the opportunity to experience a great variety of food as a child. He also admits that, studying in Geneva, he had to work to keep himself alive. This led him to minor jobs in the restaurants of Geneva, which created a fascination for food, and as his musical career ‘took off’ he started to write articles on gastronomy. Portugheis became frustrated at working in other people's kitchens. Together with his colleague, friend and compatriot, Martha Argerich, he opened a successful restaurant in London, known as \\"Rhapsody\\". He recalls that they decided on this name as he was about to perform Rhapsody in Blue with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. The restaurant, which is longer functioning, attracted a clientele of musicians. Portugheis remembers that all his musician friends would come to Rhapsody, especially on the Last Night of the Proms when, he recalls, ‘Andrew Davies came over from the Albert Hall with various friends and agents.’ Portugheis says, \\"Ultimately cooking and music have a great deal in common. They both provide emotional experiences. Maybe music provides a deeper emotion, but the end result of both is to make people happy\\".CD Classics He keeps his interest alive with his recipe writing.

The timeline of the events of the riots spanned from 6–10 August. Saturday, 6 August =Protest march= On 6 August, an initially peaceful protest was held, beginning at Broadwater Farm and finishing at Tottenham police station. The protest was organised by friends and relatives of Mark Duggan (who was killed by police on 4 August 2011), to assert a perceived unmet need for justice for the family. The rioting occurred shortly after about 120 people marched from Broadwater Farm to Tottenham Police Station via the High Road. The group demanded that a senior local police officer speak to them. They stayed in front of the police station hours longer than originally planned because they were not satisfied with the seniority of the officers available at the time. A younger and more aggressive crowd arrived around dusk, some of whom were armed. Violence broke out following a rumour that police had attacked a 16-year-old girl. =Tottenham= A firefighter douses a blaze in Tottenham during the aftermath of the initial riot Rioters facing police on the evening of 6 August 2011 A series of disturbances by people in Tottenham followed the protest march on 6 August. The rioting occurred shortly after about 120 people marched from Broadwater to Tottenham Police Station via the High Road. Tottenham is in the London borough of Haringey, which has the fourth highest level of child poverty in London and 8.8% unemployment.www.guardian.co.uk: There is a context to London's riots that can't be ignored At 22:15, a gang of youths burned down Tottenham's post office. From around 22:30, attacks were carried out on police cars, a double- decker bus and local businesses and homes. Police vans and officers from the Territorial Support Group attended the disorder on Tottenham High Road. Shops windows were smashed and the shops looted by rioters. Fireworks, petrol bombs and other missiles were thrown at police. Twenty-six officers were injured, including one who sustained head injuries. Firefighters experienced difficulty reaching a burning building because of the disorder. A BBC News correspondent said his news crew and vehicle came under attack from youths throwing missiles. Some news crews left the scene due to the threat of violence. The police set up a cordon around Tottenham police station and a nearby group of BBC and Sky journalists. Some of the police were on horseback. =Tottenham Hale= The violent clashes were followed by the looting of Tottenham Hale retail park, which continued until dawn without police intervention. =Injuries and arrests= London Ambulance Service confirmed that ten people had been treated for injuries and that nine were in hospital.

Shops were attacked, including HMV's branch in Church Street. A police helicopter hovered over the area. At around 19:00, police pushed a group of around thirty youths back onto Southbury Road towards the junction with Great Cambridge Road. Police dogs were deployed at the scene. Similar action drove back approximately 50 people along Southbury Road via Queens Street, after a preceding clash with rioters outside a supermarket. At 19:30, both Metropolitan Police officers and reinforcements from Kent Police cordoned off Enfield, making a \\"sterile area\\" to deal with local disturbances, including robberies at Enfield Retail Park. The scenes of Enfield were \\"reminiscent of Tottenham, though smaller.\\" Brixton Looting spread to Brixton that evening. Six fire engines fought a blaze at a Foot Locker shoe shop in Brixton. Riot police and youths clashed near a local Currys store that was broken into during the disturbances.

When police arrived, the looters attacked, throwing rocks and the contents of rubbish bins at officers. A branch of Halfords was targeted and looted by youths. One Brixton resident said: \\"People were coming to Brixton from outside the area. I was getting out of Brixton Tube last night about 22:30 and going up the escalator when about 10 teenagers ran up the escalator and pushed me to one side.\\" By 11:57, both Tesco and Foot Locker were targeted by looters.

They were composed of two rappers and long-time friends; Relja Popović and Vladimir Matović. Initially an underground hip-hop group, they reached mainstream success by switching to a more commercial and club-oriented sound. Elitni Odredi was also one of the first regional acts to use platforms such as Myspace and YouTube to promote their music, while generally avoiding media. They are recognised as one of the most successful and iconic regional acts of the early 2010s. History The group, initially named Ulični Pesnici Crew (Street Poets Crew), was formed by two classmates, Relja Popović and Vladimir Matović, in seventh grade. They renamed it to Elitni Odredi in 2005 and included producer Vladan Paunović. The first songs they released were \\"Ako Ste Za Rakiju\\" (If You Want Rakija), \\"Biće Ekstra\\" (It's Gonna Be Awesome), \\"Šale\\" (Jokes) and others. However, only upon the release of \\"Moja Jedina\\" (My Only One), produced by Paunović, in 2006, the group gained widespread fame across Serbia and other former Yugoslav countries. Paunović soon split with the group. Their first and to date only body of work, titled Oko Sveta (English: Around The World), was released in 2010 through Gold production. The album was influenced by Kanye West's 808s & Heartbreak with its use of Auto-Tune vocal processor and R&B; influence. It spawned several stand out hits such as \\"Raj\\" (Heaven), \\"Džek i Čivas\\" (Jack and Chivas), \\"Ljubav i Milion Dolara\\" (Love and Million Dollars) and \\"Samo Da Si Sa Mnom\\" (Only that You're with Me). In October 2011, they released single \\"Kao kokain\\" (Like Cocaine). A month later, Elitni Odredi were featured on \\"Beograd\\" (Belgrade) by DJ Shone alongside Anabela. With these releases their sound shifted to more electronic and pop, which brought them mainstream success. Elitni Odredi were also among few non-folk acts to perform in clubs throughout Serbian diaspora. In August 2012, they released \\"Ne koči\\" (Don't Pull Over) under IDJTunes, which was pop-folk-oriented. While in September, Elitni Odredi had a collaboration with singer Mia Borisavljević, titled \\"Nisi s njom\\" (You Are not with Her). A month later, they also released \\"Ljubavi moja\\" (My Love) featuring Dado Polumenta. Single \\"Zapali grad\\" (Burn Down The City) was released in October the following year. In December, duo released \\"Ima mnogo žena i kafana\\" (There's a lot of Women and Kafanas). They then embarked on an Australian tour at the beginning of 2014. In July, Elitni Odredi released \\"Ona sija\\" (She Shines). Then in October, they collaborated with Nikolija on \\"Alkohola litar\\" (Liter of Alcohol). Despite being their final single, it is also their most viewed one with over sixty million views. After several months of media speculation, in an interview for Prva TV in January 2015, Elitni Odredi announced that they were going on a hiatus to focus on solo projects, claiming that they've \\"overgrown\\" the group. Many fans, fuelled by media disinformation, blamed Nikolija Jovanović for the group's breakup, because of her pregnancy with Popović's child.

Darling (née Warren; August 4, 18851900 United States Federal Census – October 31, 1933) was an American hotel proprietor and minor socialite from Baltimore who was brutally murdered at her hotel on Halloween night, 1933, by a State of Maryland employee. Biography Bessie Darling was born in Maryland to John Wesley Warren, a grocer, and Fannie Fresh Warren. Darling was married to Charles Howard Whitridge Darling, with whom she had a son, Charles Howard Wesley Darling (1904–1965). 1910 United States Federal CensusU.S. WWII Draft Cards Young Men, 1940-1947 They had been separated or divorced for several years prior to her death. In 1920, she was again living with her parents, the Warrens.1920 United States Federal Census During Joseph Pache's term directing the Baltimore Oratorio Society, Darling worked as his secretary. In 1918, she opened the Valley View Hotel, a 12-room manor resort in Thurmont, Maryland, with Pache's financial backing.  Murder  Sometime in 1926, Darling became acquainted with George F. Schultz, who worked for the Health Department of the State of Maryland. Schultz and Darling were so close that Schultz went to see her family for Christmas in 1930. In the fall of 1933, Schultz (then 62 years old) began to suspect Darling (then 48) of passing her time with other men. His suspicion was particularly directed toward Charles Wolfe, a 63-year-old widower who had just lost his wife in the previous year. To avoid his anger, Darling left Baltimore in September and stayed at the Valley View Hotel in Deerfield with her maid. On Halloween night, 1933, Schultz took action on his suspicions. He hopped on a mail train to Thurmont which did not stop at Deerfield Station. (It was 10 minutes from the Darling residence). He then got a ride from a Clarence Lidie and insisted that Lidie take him to the Valley View Hotel, threatening Lidie with his pistol. After being informed by the maid that Darling was in her room, Schultz strode upstairs and forced open the door at which point he shot and killed Darling in the chest with the pistol. He then sent the maid to call the authorities. As she was doing so, Schultz attempted suicide by shooting himself. His attempt failed and he was captured and brought to the local hospital. Schultz recovered from his self-inflicted gunshot wound and was tried on March 13, 1934. He was found guilty of second degree murder and was sentenced to 18 years in prison. His plea during the trial was that the murder was in self-defense, as Darling had also been armed with a pistol, but the court decided that Darling had a reason to be in possession of her weapon as he had previously threatened her life.

It consists of an electrical resistance heating element jacketed in a metal hose with a power supply cable. It is primarily used to bend PVC pipe, though it can also be used to bend other thermoplastic tubes and sheets. It works by bringing up the temperature of the pipe or sheet to the softening point of 176 degrees or higher. Naturally, the longer the pipe is on the bender, the hotter and softer it will get. Once the pipe is softened, it can be formed into different shapes within the limitations of the material. When cooled, the pipe will retain all of the properties of the original material, but it will have additional stress on the points of the pipe that are stretched or compressed in the bending process.Refinishing over Replacement History PVC Bendit was designed in late 2010 to early 2011 as a way to bend longer sections of pipe than were possible with other methods. The inventor, Victor Johnson of Manitou Springs, Colorado, was looking for a method to bend long sticks of clear PVC to make a lighting system, and he could not find a method to efficiently bend more than two feet of pipe at a time. After extensive research on the properties of the material, he devised and patented this system.

In 2013 US Linguists, which were working for GLS in Kuwait through a Kuwaiti sponsorship company, faced a lot of difficulties because of a dispute between GLS and the sponsorship company. As a result, for a period of time nearly 100 American civilians working as Arabic linguists on camps Buehring and Arifjan, two major Army bases in the Middle East, were unable to leave either post because they were at risk of being detained by Kuwaiti police, who have no authority inside base gates. As many as nine linguists were detained outside the gates, held in Kuwaiti cells and flown back to the U.S., according to linguists interviewed and their employer. The situation was resolved. In 2015 GLS has started supporting the US Department of Defense cooperation with Ukraine, also using a Romanian Subcontractor to hire local national linguists. There are significant discrepancies between linguists' job offers and reality (no insurance, lack of gear, poor living conditions etc.). Nevertheless, having understanding of the mission importance, linguists started work and got positive feedback about their actual performance. The long delay of first monthly payment for translators was the last straw which caused translators strike. Facing the possibility of multinational scandal, GLS with Subcontractor managed first payment only and asked translators to continue working. Despite that next payments made on time, GLS breached its written promise to linguists about payment increase from Dec 15 according to working hours increase, in fact linguists' gross salary remains same while working hours increased by 80%. All other GLS and Subcontractor promises (both written and oral) to resolve other crucial issues in new contracts with translators are still overdue, which makes this GLS mission vulnerable.

Founded in 1834, it merged with St. Luke's Church in 1898 to form The Church of St. Luke and the Epiphany. Its 1834 Greek Revival building, designed by architect Thomas Ustick Walter and located at 1501-15 Chestnut Street, was demolished in 1902. History In 1833, Dr. Caspar Morris, Alexander W. Johnston, Robert Coldcleugh, and Lewis R. Ashhurst proposed a new congregation for the growing neighborhood around Broad and Chestnut Streets. The cornerstone was laid on March 24, 1834 by Bishop William White with the first service held in the basement of the Church the following August. The Church of the Epiphany was consecrated on Oct 12, 1834 by Bishop White; The Rev. Stephen H. Tyng, rector of St. Paul's Church, Philadelphia, was called as the first Rector. Dr. Tyng was a leader of the evangelical movement and the church became a meeting place for evangelicals from all denominations. He was an outspoken critic of the Roman Catholic Church, yet he was a fierce opponent of the Philadelphia Nativist Riots (1844). His autocratic style and strident views, however, had limited appeal beyond those in the small evangelical community. The Rev. James H. Fowles, rector of St. Batholomew's Church, Colleton County, SC, was called to be rector in 1845. Under his leadership the debt of the church was liquidated, the building was enlarged and the interior renovated to be more in keeping with contemporary Episcopal practice. His health began to deteriorate during the fourth year of his rectorate. He died on March 5, 1854 near Wateree, SC. The rectorship of The Rev. Dudley A. Tyng, son of the first rector, was filled with controversy. In 1856, one of the wardens challenged him during a sermon where he denounced the institution of slavery and used the 1854 fight over slavery in Kansas. In response, the Vestry approved a resolution stating it was inappropriate to \\"select the Lord's day and the pulpit of this Church as the time and place for the discussion of any question of sectional politics.\\" Tyng would not agree to refrain from such discussions and the Vestry asked for his resignation, which he refused to tender. The controversy went on for months. An election was held among the congregation the results of which supported the vestry's position. Tyng still would not resign. Finally the Bishop agreed to allow a new church, Church of the Covenant, to be built for him in order to secure his resignation. Unfortunately, Tyng died as a result of a farm accident that nearly severed one of his arms. It is ironic that in his last sermon, he declared that he would rather lose his right arm than fall short of declaring God's word. Among his last words to his friends surrounding his deathbed were \\"Tell them 'Let us all stand up for Jesus -- let us all stand in Christ Jesus in prayer, -- accepted in Christ, having no other claims than His righteousness, that Christ may be glorified in us forever.\\" Moved by these words, his friend the Rev. George Duffield Jr. penned the words that would become the popular hymn \\"Stand Up, Stand Up for Jesus\\" which is #561 in The [Episcopal] Hymnal 1982. Determined to avoid a repeat of the unpleasant experience of Tyng's rectorship, a southerner and friend of the late Rev. Fowles was elected rector. The Rev. William Otis Prentiss was elected rector in 1857. He remained at Epiphany for only one year and then returned to his native South Carolina. The Rev. John Cracraft was called to be rector in December 1858 and assumed leadership of the parish in January 1859. Francis Wells, Church of the Epiphany's historian, noted \\"[Cracraft] occupied the Rectorship for a little more than 3 years ... it was the period of the Parish's greatest depression both spiritually and materially, and was terminated by [his resignation on] March 2, 1862.\\" The size of the congregation dwindled and the resources of the Church were depleted by 1862. Under these dire conditions, The Rev. Dr. Richard Newton, rector of St. Paul's Church, Philadelphia, was called to be rector in 1862. During the nine years, he served at Epiphany the congregation grew substantially and was put on a better financial footing. His greatest interest lay in the Sunday schools where he preached a series of sermons that were published in several languages and distributed worldwide. The Rev. Dr. Newton was also active in various institutions in Philadelphia, including the University of Pennsylvania's Board of Trustees. In 1862, Episcopal leaders held a secret meeting at Epiphany where they decided not to recognize the split in the Episcopal Church caused by the Civil War and would only mark southern representatives absent at the upcoming general convention. This action helped ease the reunification of the church after the Civil War (which occurred at St. Luke's Church, Philadelphia). In 1881, The Rev. Dr. Newton retired due to illness and was given the title of Rector Emeritus and a small pension. By the fall of 1881, however, he had recovered and assumed the rectorship of Church of the Covenant, Philadelphia, where he served until his death. The Rev. George H. Kinsolving, rector of St. John's Church, Cincinnati, OH, was called to be rector in 1881. He was active in the work of the Diocese and was a trustee of the Philadelphia Divinity School. His rectorship was cut short when he was elected Episcopal Bishop of Texas in 1883. At this time, the Church claimed 613 members and a value of $300,000.00. The Rev. Thomas A. Tidball was the last rector at Epiphany and also the first of the consolidated church. A scholar and author of a theological study, he was installed in 1884 and it was through his persistence that the merger was accomplished. In 1895, prominent Philadelphia merchant, John Wanamaker approached The Church of The Epiphany to purchase its property. The Vestry approved the sale for $600,000 with the intention of relocating the church farther west. They could not, however, get the required consent of the three closest parishes for the move. Bishop Ozi W. Whitaker suggested the merger with St. Luke's Church, Philadelphia, which occurred on April 6, 1898. The building was demolished in 1902. Upon the sale of the grounds, remains from 33 vaults in the church burial ground were exhumed and re-interred at West Laurel Hill Cemetery, South Laurel Hill Cemetery, Machpelah Cemetery, and Woodland Cemetery among several others. A large monument that stood at the corner dedicated to Rev. Fowles was relocated to West Laurel Hill. Architecture The Church of The Epiphany was designed by noted Philadelphia architect Thomas Ustick Walter in the Greek Revival style. While the envelope of the building was rather plain and lacking detail, the portico, elevated above street level, featured a Doric colonnade with associated triglyph/metope details and flat pediment. Perhaps the explanation for this curious entrance was that the original plans called for a tall wooden steeple. The interior, similar to many Protestant churches at the time, was plainly decorated, with white painted walls and clear glass. A deep gallery ran across the south end, with two small recessed galleries on the east and west sides. The chancel was square, with four Corinthian columns separating it from the nave. Half of it was occupied by the organ gallery, which was supported on pillars, the chancel running in under it and entered by a door at the rear, which communicated by a flight of stairs with the vestry room in the basement. The chancel rail was continued around four sides of the chancel. The pulpit occupied the center, with reading desks on both sides, forming one continuous structure. A small oaken communion table, covered with crimson velvet, was placed in front of the pulpit. This table remained in use until the enlargement of the church in 1853. The ceiling was also minimally decorated and featured a large ventilator at its center. A large central oil chandelier lighted the church and smaller ones also hanging from the ceiling until 1841, when gas was introduced. In 1842, the existing galleries were taken down, and new galleries erected on the three sides of the church. No further important change was made until 1853, when the building was enlarged by an extension to the north line of the lot. This was done under the direction of John Mcarthur, architect, at a cost of $19,400. The square chancel was retained but the old organ gallery was removed and the organ placed upon a platform at the rear of the chancel and raised about three feet above its floor. The rail was returned against this platform, giving a three- sided kneeling space. The original communion table was replaced by a slightly larger one; painted carved and covered with a marble slab. It was placed at the center and rear of the chancel, which was very shallow on account of the organ platform. The pulpit was removed to the east side and the reading desk to the west side. The next change to the interior was brought about suddenly by a fire on July 18, 1865, which destroyed a building at the rear of the church, the heat affecting the north wall of the church so seriously as to require its reconstruction. As a result, the organ was moved to the south gallery of the church, and in 1866 the chancel was remodeled again. This was done upon designs and under supervision of John Crump, builder. The next important change of the interior was made in 1880 under the direction of George W. Hewitt, architect. The upper galleries were removed; the windows, which were formerly of plain glass, covered with venetian blinds, were replaced with stained glass; the whole interior which had up to then been painted in white or pale neutral tints, was repainted in a polychromic scheme typical of the period. A brass altar rail replaced the existing on in the chancel. The church was at the same time recarpeted and reupholstered throughout. This cost of this improvement was $5,693,97. In 1881, an organ chamber was constructed by utilizing the rooms on the northeast corner of the building, formerly used by the Rector, Sexton, and Sunday school library. The organ installed was built by George Jardine & Sons of New York City and was well regarded as one of the finest in the city. One-half of the east gallery was removed due to its interference with the organ and choir in their new location. The organ was blown by a water engine in the cellar.  Music  = Organs = The first organ at Epiphany Church was built by Henry Corrie in 1835. The In 1882, the church purchased an organ built by George Jardine of New York City.

Epiphany Chapel (1862-1898)  Epiphany Chapel at 17th and Winter Streets, from Philadelphia Inquirer article 13 Nov 1899. The Epiphany Chapel began in 1859 as the Mission Sunday School of the Seventh Presbyterian Church of Philadelphia, and was located at 23rd and Race Streets. In November 1862 the school and its facilities became connected with Church of the Epiphany. Soon after the acquisition, discussions began about constructing a new facility on the site capable of housing both a school and chapel. Instead, a site was selected at northwest corner of 23rd and Cherry Streets and construction started in 1865 on a two-story brick building. The building cost $7,000 to construct and was able to fit 250 students on the main floor and 400 students in the basement. The success of the Mission Sunday School was expanded first with evening chapel services, by 1871 the Mission Sunday School had become Epiphany Chapel. Epiphany Chapel was admitted to the Diocese of Pennsylvania convention in 1878 as a mission of Church of the Epiphany. The chapel remained located at 23 and Cherry Streets until the merger with St. Luke's Church, at which time the parish purchased a lot on 17th Street, spanning between Summer and Winter Streets. =Vicars of Epiphany Chapel= A vicar in the Episcopal Church is usually the priest-in-charge of a mission of the Parish. * The Rev.

They have the formula (SiH_{n})_{x} where 0.2 ≤ n ≤ 2.5 and x is the number of monomer units. The polysilicon hydrides are generally colorless or pale- yellow/ocher powders that are easily hydrolyzed and ignite readily in air. The surfaces of silicon prepared by MOCVD using silane (SiH4) consist of a polysilicon hydride. Synthesis Polysilicon hydrides are much less thermally stable than the corresponding alkanes (CnH2n+2). They are kinetically labile, with their decomposition reaction rate increasing with increases in the number of silicon atoms in the molecule. Consequently, the preparation and isolation of polysilicon hydrides is difficult for species containing more than a few silicon atoms.W. W. Porterfield Inorganic Chemistry: A Unified Approach, Academic Press (1993) p. 219 . Greater catenation of the Si atoms can be obtained with the halides (SinX2n+2 with n = 14) for the fluorides.A. Earnshaw, N. Greenwood, Chemistry of the Elements, Butterworth-Heinemnann (1997) p. 341 . Thus the polymeric silicon hydrides are formed along with smaller silicon hydride oligomers and hydrogen gas from the spontaneous but slow decomposition, as well as from the accelerated thermolysis, of acyclic and cyclic liquid silanes that are higher in molecular weight than monosilane (SiH4) and disilane (Si2H6). Polysilicon hydrides are intermediates in the high-temperature conversion of mono- and disilane to silicon and hydrogen gas. In the following idealized sequence cyclopentasilane is the polysilicon hydride intermediate: : 5 SiH4 → Si5H10 + 5 H2 :Si5H10 → 5 Si + 5H2 Polymeric silicon hydrides by be prepared by hydrolysis of certain silicides. Acid hydrolysis of calcium monosilicide (CaSi) produces (SiH2)x. CaSi consists of zigzag silicon chain with the formula (Si2−)n. This chain is preserved in the hydrolysis. This reaction was reported in 1921 by the German chemists Lothar Woehler (1870–1952) and Friedrich Mueller. In 1923, German chemists Alfred Stock (1876–1946) and Friedrich Zeidler (1855–1931) found the (SiH)x polymer is formed along with silane gas by the action of sodium amalgam on dichlorosilane (SiH2Cl2). The reaction is proposed to first produce the disodiosilane (SiH2Na2) via a Wurtz-like reaction. The SiH2Na2 dissolves in the mercury to generate the diradical SiH2, which then forms the final products.J. W. Mellor A Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry, Vol. VI Longmans, Green and Co. (1947) pp. 970–971. Polysilicon hydrides may also be produced by the dehalogenation of polysilicon halides. An illustrative reaction is the debromination of HSiBr3 with Mg in ether:A. F. Holleman, Egon Wiberg, Nils Wiberg, Inorganic Chemistry, Academic Press (2001), pp. 844–845 . :HSiBr3 + 3/2 Mg → 1/x (SiH)x + 3/2 MgBr2 Macromolecular structure When n = 2 in (SiHn)x, the polymer is termed polysilene, which has a quasi-one-dimensional (zigzag) chain structure in which each silicon atom is bonded to two other silicon skeletal atoms and two hydrogen atoms. Thus the Si atom is tetravalent (has four bonds). If n = 1, quasi-two-dimensional (corrugated sheets) or random three-dimensional silicon networks termed polysilynes are obtained in which each silicon atom is bonded to three other silicon skeletal atoms and one hydrogen atom giving, again, a tetravalent Si atom. In the polysilenes and the polysilynes, the backbone is made exclusively of silicon atoms; the pendent- or side-groups, are not shared between skeletal atoms of the backbone chain.A. F. Holleman, Egon Wiberg, Nils Wiberg, Inorganic Chemistry, Academic Press (2001), pp. 844–849 . Top: chain structure, middle: sheet structure, bottom: three-dimensional irregular structure. Compression of silane itself under extremely high pressures (> 90 GPa) for long periods of time (~8 months) produces a material that differs from those shown above in that the silicon atoms are not bonded to one another but, rather, are connected via bridging hydrogen atoms. The silicon atoms are 8-fold coordinated by hydrogen (i.e. each silicon atom is bonded to 8 hydrogen atoms) forming a tetragonal structure. Inorganic derivatives – siloxene In addition to the polysilicon halides, another related compound, in which the hydrogen is partially replaced by an inorganic group, is siloxene. Siloxene was first observed before the polysilicon hydrides, but it was initially thought to be a polymeric silicon hydride itself. Siloxene is structurally derived from layered polysilyne by replacing one-half of the hydrogen atoms with OH groups. It has the chemical formula Si2H2O (or [Si6H3(OH)3]x) and it is prepared by reacting calcium disilicide (CaSi2), which has a puckered layer of silicon atoms, with dilute hydrochloric acid. This yellow solid was prepared from that route as early as 1900 by Charles Schenck Bradley (1853–1929), a one-time associate of Thomas Edison.C. S. Bradley Chem. News, 82 (1900) pp. 149–150. However, its structure, the intra-polymer Si-Si bond order, and true chemical formula were not determined for some time afterwardsJ. W. Mellor A Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry Vol VI, Longmans, Green and Co. (1947) p. 226. Bradley had erroneously concluded it was the silicon analog, (Si2H2)x, of the unsaturated (double-bond containing) polymer Polyacetylene and referred to as silico- acetylene. Organic derivatives – polysilanes and polysilynes When hydrogen atoms in linear polysilene are replaced with organic substituents, particularly alkyl and aryl groups, polysilanes are obtained.James E. Mark, Harry R. Allcock, Robert West, Inorganic Polymers, 2nd edition, Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. 201–214 . Although organosilicon polymers can be considered structural derivatives of polysilicon hydrides, they are not synthesized directly from them. Traditionally, polysilanes are prepared by the Wurtz-like sodium or potassium metal-mediated reductive coupling (dehalogenation) of dihaloorganosilanes (R2SiX2) in an inert solvent (e.g. toluene), very much like Burkhard's original method. Polysilynes have been similarly prepared from trihaloorganosilanes (RSiX3).

In the 1950s he established a home for the street children of Naples which later evolved into an international network for social support, called Casa dello scugnizzo (House of the Urchins). Subsequently, following his laicization, he maintained his international reputation for his civil commitment and his studies on peace research and education. > «The insecure, tormented, down-trodden people, in whom we are submerged, are > no different from all the others spread over the rest of the world, even if > their eyes, skins, creeds are not the same as ours.

Life =Childhood and education= Born in a family of the working-class, Mario Borrelli interrupts his education at the age of nine for economic needs and works, for three years, as a metal gilders and lad in a barber shop. His mother and father are modest artisan goldsmith's in Naples and have other four children. Eager to resume his studies, at the age of twelve, he decides to stop working and is accepted at the Apostolic School, thanks to the efforts of his mother and financial support of Father Nobilione, a priest who attended the barber shop where he used to work and who will pay the school fee for the first year. In 1946, Mario is consecrated priest and immediately stands out in his vocation for the poor and discriminated: in Naples he founds the first section of the “Gioventù Operaia” (Young Labourers) and is one of the promoters of “ONARMO” Opera Nazionale per l'Assistenza Religiosa e Morale degli Operai (National Labour for the Religious and Moral Assistance of Workers), becoming the factory chaplain of various companies. During these years, he reaches the most remote suburbs of the city with his “flying church”, a little second-hand Austin car he had bought by the Allies in departure from Naples, whose trunk he had transformed in an altar for the Mass and in a puppet theatre to teach catechism to children. In 1949, the young priest teaches religion at the Jacopo Sannazaro High School of Naples although he is not a common religion teacher since he knows the most remote corners and streets of Naples and, together with his seminary companion, Father Ciccio (Francesco) Spada, he decides to carry out an enterprise among the street children, commonly called in Naples “scugnizzi” (street urchins). > «…how does the street urchin live? The essence of life is the gang. Six, > seven, eight and in some cases up to twenty youngsters organized in a gang > with a leader. A leader who has been able to impose on its own in perfect > style with the wild. The rules of the street can be considered a subchapter > of the rules of the wild.» Mario Borrelli, Marciapiedi, Edizioni La > Meridiana, Molfetta, 1995. =The venture among the street urchins of Naples= The “street urchins” in the era of post World War II are abandoned children, who survive precariously. Adults can guarantee them no food nor lodging, let alone education, and actually, in the general disorder of those years, for their extreme poverty and deceitful tricks, street urchins more commonly elicit disdain than pity. In this social context, Father Mario Borrelli is certain that the “street urchin” is not a delinquent and, after having obtained permission by this superiors, he decides to dress like a street urchin and, at night, mingles with them sharing their life and misadventures in the street, for four months. In the meantime, Father Ciccio Spada and the other priests of the Comunità Piccola Opera di Materdei organize a provisional dormitory in the small deconsecrated church of San Gennariello, with the hope that Father Mario convinces the street urchins to find shelter there at least for a night. During one of these nights as a street urchin, Father Mario reveals his true identity to the gang he belongs to and, not without discussions, succeeds in bringing the street urchins to the dormitory of San Gennariello. In a few months, hundreds of youngsters are housed in the structure that will soon to become the Casa dello Scugnizzo (The House of the Urchins), a community more than an orphanage, where nobody is forced to stay unwillingly and where all participate to the community's expenses working as junk dealers. The Casa dello scugnizzo offerered hospitality, boarding, education and moral support to the young and homeless, taking the place of the family. The education given to the young has as aim the single individual's engagement in relationship to the needs of the community to whom it belongs and, with the help of public charities, in a few months the boys are lifted from the burden of work to leave space to schooling and professional training. > «…Mario is an uncommon priest, who becomes a street urchin “like them” by > taking off his talar, when the Little Brothers of Charles de Foucauld and > their experience of incarnation is still in the future. And Mario is a > peculiar priest, who lives “with them” to accompany them towards freedom, > when the theology of liberation is yet to be practiced. And all this when > the churches of the world, catholic and protestant, at their best operate > “for them”. » Giuliana Martirani, Foreword of Marciapiedi, Edizioni La > Meridiana, Molfetta, 1995. = The Casa dello scugnizzo = Between 1951 and 1969, Casa dello scugnizzo was not only the physical location providing assistance and support to the street urchins but more importantly it is a network of committees and voluntary groups, distributed throughout Europe and The United States. What truly allows the House of the Urchins to bring up the boys, in fact, is the fund-raising carried out by the community of Italian, English, American, Canadian, Australian, French, German, Belgian, and Dutch voluntary groups. The true novelty is the simple approach followed up by the Casa, which fascinates educators and families of catholic, Anglican and Protestant origin. Father Borrelli's reputation is enhanced by national (Stella della bontà 1963) and international (Honorary Member of the Deutscher Kinderschutzbund: Federation for the protection of youth) recognitions, the American magazine Reader's Digest, translated in more than 12 languages, spreads his story around the world and, in 1957, Children of the Sun, the biographic novel of Father Borrelli's undertakings written by Morris West, increases his popularity in the Anglophile world by transforming him into a “myth”. In 1958, the film Il bacio del sole (aka Il Bacio del Sole-Don Vesuvio), taking inspiration from Mario's venture among the street urchins, is released at the cinema and distributed throughout Europe, while the English broadcasting ITV Television Playhouse produces a biographical television series entitled “Children of the sun”. Father Mario puts his great popularity at the service of the poor, maladapted and socially excluded children of Naples: he continues to raise funds incessantly for the street urchins and their poor families. Likewise the American priest Henry Rosso, founder of the first fund-raising school in the world, Mario Borrelli's way to raise consciousness for the poor can be described as the art to teach people the joy to give. Several conferences taking place in various parts of the world allow Father Borrelli to strengthen his, already florid, network of contacts in support of his initiatives and while the Casa dello Scugnizzo builds additional housing and offers the boys new possibilities of training and education, Mario identifies the context in which child abandonment is rooted. During the 1960s, Father Mario comes to the conclusion that the underlying problems, the social causes of abandonment, maladaptation and social exclusion remain yet unresolved. He decides to live in the Neapolitan slums, together with the Little Sisters of Charles de Foucauld, at the core of a network of voluntary groups of Christian origin that look at the Vatican Council II as a spiritual and civil source and inspiration. > «10 dicembre 1962. If somebody asks me why I am here in the slums, I must > honestly reply I don't really know. I could reply: “Because I love you”. If > someone from outside addresses me the same question, what do you think I > should reply? “Because I love them”. Even this sounds like a sentence that > has become rusty by centuries of abandonment. We have become Pharisees and > always prefer considering the poor as the sole responsibles of their > misery.» Mario Borrelli, Un prete nelle baracche, La Locusta, Vicenza, 1967. =The return to the lay state= In 1967, Father Mario, has published several historical-archival works since he has succeeded in obtaining a diploma in diplomatic and archival paleography, other than carrying out his pastoral activity. After having followed a short course in sociology at the TUFT University, he decides to enroll at the London School of Economics to obtain the most accredited Master in Social Administration of the time. In the meantime, he has come to the decision to leave priesthood as his personal, moral and political, views are incompatible to those of the Neapolitan Christian church. The conservative position of the local Christian church appears to him to be in contrast with the Christian mandate and, thus, adverse to the social changes so necessary for the human and cultural development of the Neapolitan working class. His idea of a participative democracy, so close to the position of intellectuals like Paulo Freire or clerics as Frei Betto, makes way and is in total contradiction with the government proposed in Naples by the representatives of the Democrazia Cristiana (Christian Democratic Party). Even on a personal level, the return to the lay state seems to represent a natural step for him on his human journey, rather than an afterthought of sorts. He remains a member of the Congregation of San Filippo Neri as a laic and gets married. > «…I have never understood in what way the Kingdom of God could be incarnated > in public life as a clan of groups of human interest that would use God as > flag and tablecloth for their daily meal. In what way an elected boss, > through his patronal-Mafia network, could bring God to the Neapolitans and > make them more honest and good examples of Christianity. When I realized > that this Church felt the message too metaphorically and remained distant > and absent from the poor, I felt cheated in my vocation. I felt as a > prisoner, a wheel of a mechanism that tended to save and perpetuate itself > instead of saving and helping others.» Mario Borrelli, Tanquam Peripsema, > Naples, 1970. =The Materdei Community Centre= The next step is to reflect the activities of the House of the Urchins in a wider and more communal dimension, \\"opening\\" the Institute to the outside world by eliminating the boarding and lodging facilities, and by constituting a multi-purpose social structure, which provides different services in response to practical and immediate needs, but at the same time, which functions as “ignition” and stimulus for a community- based participation. Twenty years of historical research leave the pace to social studies, disseminated in international conferences and shared among the collaborators. For ten years, the Materdei Community Centre focuses its activities on the defence of women and children rights, schooling and health, especially during the outbreaks of cholera and “male oscuro” (obscure illness), an infantile disease affecting the respiratory system and particularly common among the children of Naples at the time whose name was derived by its inexplicable nature and difficult diagnosis and treatment. The Community Centre also provides direct social assistance, promotes initiatives in favour of the local community and coordinates the voluntary groups of Naples. > «Until everyone continues to rush, and wants to be first, to gain more at > any expense, even by trodding on others in every sense it will be difficult > to entrench peace, which consists essentially in the perfect balance between > power and resources. What is necessary instead is a work of social reform > where the cooperation of others is essential. In the end, humanity is like a > wall of bricks: every row needs the other rows to avoid collapsing. Courage > is not heroism: it is a moral duty, a social responsibility.» Mario > Borrelli, from the interview released to Donatella Trotta, E nel dopoguerra > spuntò Don Vesuvio, Il Mattino, 1985. =The Italian Peace Research Institute= In 1977, Mario Borrelli, Tonino Drago and Giuliana Martirani founded Italian Peace Research Institute (IPRI), chaired by the same Borrelli until 1988. The Institute is affiliated to IPRA, the International Peace Research Association, founded in 1964 by Johan Galtung and which counts with 26 researchers and 250 correspondents distributed in 60 Italian cities. The small institute has the aim to promote initiatives focused on peace research that involve voluntary associations and non-violent peace- inspired movements, a network of people operating in universities and in basic movements for peace. IPRI follows the same path of its international sister institution by promoting research in the field of communal non-violent defence, peace education and non-violent economy and also publishes a bulletin, the IPRI Newsletter. This small institute contributes to some of the major works on peace research published internationally, ranging from economic development to the international division of labour, from the social services for children to peace research and education. Mario Borrelli is also a member of the P.E.C., Peace Education Commission, within the IPRA. Various essays, but especially the experimentation carried out at the Materdei Community Centre, remain as testimony of his experience as a researcher for peace education. > «Naples is a large swamp in which it is difficult to swim. People who really > want to work hard, by sowing seeds on a daily basis, become enemies of the > city by fighting against the conspiracy of the precarious, or > institutionalization of the provisional, and of disgrace on which this city > seems to live on. And which has increasingly deteriorated over the last five > or six years or so. The earthquake has been devastating: it has broken the > harmony, although only apparent, and has given an enormous power to the > emerging social class of “organized crime”. The dominant impression is thus > that of a “perpetual begging at all levels that ensures survival”. .» Mario > Borrelli, from the interview released to Donatella Trotta, E nel dopoguerra > spuntò Don Vesuvio, Il Mattino, 1985.

He gained notoriety for his involvements in the unrest and hangings in Warsaw during the Kościuszko Uprising. Biography Konopka was born in 1769 to a burgher family in Poznań. He studies law in Kraków, where he was a lawyer applicant in the F. Barss legal practice. Member of the Kołłątaj's Forge organization and one of the Polish Jacobins, and secretary to Hugo Kołłątaj; during Kołlataj's period as the Deputy Crown Chancellor (podkanclerz koronny) in 1791, Konopka held the position of the Secretary of the Lesser Seal (sekretarz pieczęci mniejszej). He participated in the Kościuszko Uprising, joining the cavalry. During that period, around May and June 1794, he gained notoriety as one of the leaders of the demonstrations and riots in Warsaw. In particular, he was involved in the \\"hanging of the traitors\\" incident around 28 June. In this incident, not supported by the insurrectionist government, out of several people hanged, including insurrection opponents such as chamberlain Karol Boscamp-Lasopolski, prince Antoni Stanisław Czetwertyński- Światopełk and bishop Ignacy Jakub Massalski, the defense attorney and a prosecutor who attempted to stop the mob were also beaten and hanged; they included a friend of Tadeusz Kościuszko, advocate Michał Wulfers. For his involvement in the incident, Koponka was sentenced by the insurrectionist court to an exile (banicja). Koponka left for France, where he joined French cavalry, and fought in Corsica. In the aftermath of the final Third Partition of Poland, after Polish Legions were recreated under the French control in Italy, he became involved in the formation creation, reaching a rank of a captain or major (sources vary). He commanded a squadron, and later, a baon. In 1801 he was an aide-de-camp of Jan Henryk Dąbrowski. He died in 1805 in Bari (Pachoński mentions a sudden heart attack) or in 1809 (according to Rusinowa). Konopka is one of the figures immortalized in Jan Matejko's 1891 painting, Constitution of May 3, 1791.

Name and history The name was chosen as a combination of the location of the Bridge Folk Club at the north end of the High Level Bridge in Newcastle upon Tyne, where they all played, and from the Cheviot Ranters, a famous Northumberland dance band operating in the Alnwick area from about 1953 to 1996. The High Level Ranters have been playing traditional music and song from North East England for nearly 40 years, becoming one of the most influential groups of the British folk revival. For many years they were the only group featuring the Northumbrian smallpipes in their performances, and are thus responsible for introducing many of today's pipers to this unique instrument. They have also introduced many of today's musicians to the distinctive traditional music in the North East, and have done so with a unique enthusiasm of performance.Official Website, Highlevelranters.co.uk Performers such as The High Level Ranters brought Northumbrian folk to national and international audiences.S.

The school was closed in 1984. History Boggs Academy was founded by the Reverend Dr. John Lawrence Phelps (1866–1937). The vision of Boggs Academy began during the summer of 1906, which was a year of extreme racial tension in the south. Amid this climate, Phelps accepted the challenge to establish a school built on Christian principles, which would educate African American youth. He set about building a church and school with the support of the Presbyterian church and the local community. The initial two acres of land were donated by Morgan Walker, donations were collected, and a church was erected (Morgan Groove Presbyterian Church). By December of that year, the church doors were opened, and by January 1907, an independent school was opened in the church. Five children were enrolled in Boggs Academy when it opened. The school was named after Virginia P. Boggs (Corresponding Secretary of the Presbyterian Board of Missions For Freedmen) as a tribute for her faithful zeal, commitment to the school's success and her support and friendship to Reverend Phelps while he was a student at Biddle University (now known as Johnson C. Smith University). In 1930, the original church was destroyed by fire and another building was erected through the generosity of the Blackburn family of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; the new chapel, which is still standing on the Boggs campus, was named the John I. Blackburn Presbyterian Church. Numerous private African American schools were established after the Civil War because there were no public schools for African American students in the South. Boggs began primarily to serve the local African American community. After the public school opened in Burke County in the 1950s in response to integration laws, Boggs increasingly functioned as a preparatory school for the African American middle class from Georgia and other states. Boggs Academy had also negotiated a settlement that allowed both white and black people to serve on its faculty. Over the years the Boggs student body and campus continued to grow and flourish with additional acreage, buildings and capabilities. Student life Students began their day with compulsory chapel and attended classes until 4 PM. They had to be in dormitories by 9:30 PM and in bed by 10 PM.

They are an important part of health care in the United States. The vast majority of physicians in the US have a Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree, though some have a DO or MBBS. The American College of Physicians, uses the term physician to describe specialists in internal medicine, while the American Medical Association uses the term physician to describe members of all specialties.  Working conditions  Doctors may work independently, as part of a larger group practice, or for a hospital or healthcare organization. Independent practices are defined as one in which the physician owns a majority of his or her practice and has decision making rights. In 2000, 57% of doctors were independent, but this decreased to 33% by 2016. Between 2012 and 2015, there was a 50% increase in the number of physicians employed by hospitals. 26 percent have opted out of seeing patients with Medicaid and 15 percent have opted out of seeing patients with health insurance exchange plans.https://www.accenture.com/t20150608T044420__w__/us- en/_acnmedia/Accenture/Conversion- Assets/DotCom/Documents/Global/PDF/Dualpub_15/Accenture-The-Doctor-Will-Not- See-You.pdf On average, physicians in the US work 55 hours each week and earn a salary of $270,000, although work hours and compensation vary by specialty. 25% of physicians work more than 60 hours per week.  Demographics  While an impending \\"doctor shortage\\" has been reported, from 2010 to 2016, the actively licensed U.S. physician-to-population ratio increased from 277 to 295 physicians per 100,000 people. Additionally, the number of female physicians, and osteopathic and Caribbean graduates have increased at a greater percentage. The percentage of females skews younger. In 2016, 34% of female physicians were under 40 years old, compared with 19% of male physicians. As of 2016, there were over 950,000 practicing physicians in the United States. 93% have an MD degree, and 76% were educated in the United States. 65% were male. 79% were licensed in a medical specialty. 22% held active licenses in two or more states. The District of Columbia has, by far, the largest number of physicians as a percentage of the population, with 1,838 per 100,000 people. Specialists The term, hospitalist, was introduced in 1996, to describe US specialists in internal medicine who work largely or exclusively in hospitals. Such 'hospitalists' now make up about 19% of all US general internists. There are three agencies or organizations in the United States which collectively oversee physician board certification of M.D. and D.O. physicians in the United States in the 26 approved medical specialties recognized in the country. These organizations are the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) and the American Medical Association; the American Osteopathic Association Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists (AOABOS) and the American Osteopathic Association; the American Board of Physician Specialties (ABPS) and the American Association of Physician Specialists. Each of these agencies and their associated national medical organization functions as its various specialty academies, colleges, and societies. All boards of certification now require that medical practitioners demonstrate, by examination, continuing mastery of the core knowledge and skills for a chosen specialty. Recertification varies by particular specialty between every seven and every ten years. Salaries =Pay Gap by gender and race= The average salary for white male physicians was $253,000 compared with $188,230 for black male physicians, $163,000 for white female physicians, and $153,000 for black female physicians. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/06/08/the- racial-pay-gap-extends-even-to- doctorshttps://www.bmj.com/content/353/bmj.i2923 Medscape’s 2019 Physician Compensation Report found that \\"males out-earned their female counterparts in both primary care and specialist positions with men earning 25% and 33% more, respectively.\\"https://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g5604https://time.com/5566602/doctor- pay-gaphttps://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/physician- diversity/3-misconceptions-about-what-drives-medicine-s-gender-pay The AMA has advocated to reduce gender bias and close the pay gap. https://www.ama- assn.org/practice-management/physician-diversity/challenging-gender-bias- house-medicine The AMA said that “significant sex differences in salary exist even after accounting for age, experience, specialty, faculty rank, and measures of research productivity and clinical revenue.”https://www.ama- assn.org/practice-management/physician-diversity/3-misconceptions-about-what- drives-medicine-s-gender-pay A 2015 study of gender pay disparities among hospitalists found that women were more likely to be working night shifts despite having lower salaries. In 2018, the AMA delegates advocated for transparency in defining the criteria for initial and subsequent physician compensation, that pay structures be based on objective, gender-neutral objective criteria, and that institutes take a specified approach using metrics for all employees to identify gender disparity.https://www.ama- assn.org/practice-management/physician-diversity/physicians-adopt-plan-combat- pay-gap-medicine. The AMA has also advocated to move USMLE Step 1 to pass/fail to decrease racial bias. A 2020 study showed lack of diversity within specialities and that that underrepresented students were more likely to go into specialities that have lower Step 1 cut offs like Primary Care.https://www.statnews.com/2020/02/14/cheers-and-jeers-as-med-schools- step-1-test-becomes-pass-fail =Pay cuts due to COVID = One in five physicians reported having a pay cut during COVID-19 pandemic.

The US has the second-highest paid specialists in the world behind the Netherlands. Public and private payers pay higher fees to US primary care physicians for office visits (overall 27 percent more for public and 70 percent more for private) than in Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the United Kingdom. US primary care physicians also earn more (overall earning $186,000 yearly) than the foreign counterparts, with even higher numbers for physician compensation for medical specialists. Higher fees, rather than factors such as higher practice costs, volume of services, or tuition expenses, mainly drive higher US spending. =Variations within the US= A survey of 15,000 physicians practicing in the United States reported that, across all specialties, male physicians earn approximately 41% more than female physicians. Also, female physicians are more likely to report working fewer hours than their male counterparts. The same survey reported that, the highest-earning physicians were located in North Central region, comprising Kansas, Nebraska, North and South Dakota, Iowa, and Missouri, with a median salary of $225,000 per year, as per 2010. The next highest earning physicians were those in the South Central region, comprising Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas, at $216,000. Those physicians reporting the lowest compensation levels were located in the Northeast and Southwest, earning an across-specialty median annual income of $190,000. The survey concluded that physicians in small cities (50,000–100,000) earned slightly more than those living in community types of other sizes, ranging from metropolitan to rural, but the differences were only marginal (a few percent more or less). Other results from the survey were that those running a solo practice earned marginally less than private practice employees, who, in turn, earned marginally less than hospital employees. In contrast, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports median annual income for physicians at $166,400.Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2012-13 Edition, Physicians and Surgeons, on the Internet at http://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/physicians-and-surgeons.htm (visited November 01, 2013). Medical education The US medical education for physicians includes participation in a US medical school that eventually grants a US form of Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) degree or a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) degree. During the process of medical school, physicians who wish to practice in the U.S. must take standardized exams, such as the USMLE steps 1, 2 and 3 or COMLEX-USA Level 1, 2, and 3. In addition, the completion of a residency is required to practice independently. Physicians must have a medical license to practice in any state.

It is the largest of several small villages and dispersed settlements that make up Mechell Community Council area. It is east of Holyhead, and west of Amlwch, in the north of the island. Mechell Community (which also includes the small villages of Mynydd Mechell and Carreglefn) had a 2001 population of 1,532,UK Neighbourhood Statistics, 2001 Census returns accessed 30 April 2012 decreasing to 1,293 in 2011. Village services include a church, a primary school, a pub and two chapels. It is an agricultural area, and has been a local centre for markets, livestock fairs, and had both a watermill and a windmill. The area round about has many prehistoric monuments. History The many prehistoric remains close to the village indicate that the area has been lived in for thousands of years. The first written mention of Llanfechell itself is in 1291.Rev. Dafydd Wyn William, record of a talk given to Llanfechell History Society The name Llanfechell means Church of St Mechell (In the lenitive (treiglad meddal) the 'M' becomes 'F', pronounced V.Omniglot.com). Mechell (or Mechyll) appears to have been a 6th-century missionary, possibly from Brittany, who founded a monastery here. Hw is said to have been the son of Echwydd and the grandson of Gwyn Gohoyw, who flourished in the 5th century. A 17th century manuscript (Llanstephan MS. 125)Baring-Gould, S. & Fisher, John (1911), The Lives of the British Saints, Vol III p.433 us.archive.org records a Welsh poem, Cywydd i Fechell Sant. This describes how St Mechell was offered a gift of land in gratitude for a miraculous healing, to be demarcated by the route of a released hare. The hare, under divine guidance, marked the full extent of what is now the parish of Llanfechell, where he then founded the monastery. 18th century life in Llanfechell was described in great detail by William Bulkeley (4 November 1691 – October 1760). From 30 March 1734 to September 1760 he kept a daily diary recording Anglesey life, social customs, personal and family dealings, farming practices and the weather.William Bulkely (1691-1760), by Thomas Richards, D.Litt., (1878-1962), Bangor.

At room temperature, the polysilicon fluorides are colorless to yellow solids while the chlorides, bromides, and iodides are, respectively, yellow, amber, and red-orange.Inorganic Chemistry, Holleman-Wiberg, Academic Press (2001), p. 850. Polysilicon dihalides (perhalo-polysilenes) have the general formula (SiX2)n while the polysilicon monohalides (perhalo-polysilynes) have the formula (SiX)n, where X is F, Cl, Br, or I and n is the number of monomer units in the polymer. Macromolecular structure The polysilicon halides can be considered structural derivatives of the polysilicon hydrides, in which the side-group hydrogen atoms are substituted with halogen atoms. In the monomeric silicon dihalide (aka dihalo-silylene and dihalosilene) molecule, which is analogous to carbene molecules, the silicon atom is divalent (forms two bonds). By contrast, in both the polysilicon dihalides and the polysilicon monohalides, as well as the polysilicon hydrides, the silicon atom is tetravalent with a local coordination geometry that is tetrahedral, even though the stoichiometry of the monohalides ([SiX]n = SinXn) might erroneously imply a structural analogy between perhalopolysilynes and [linear] polyacetylenes with the similar formula (C2H2)n. The carbon atoms in the polyacetylene polymer are sp2-hybridized and thus have a local coordination geometry that is trigonal planar. However, this is not observed in the polysilicon halides or hydrides because the Si=Si double bond in disilene compounds are much more reactive than C=C double bonds. Only when the substituent groups on silicon are very large are disilene compounds kinetically non-labile.R. West \\"The Chemistry of the Silicon-Silicon Double Bond\\" Angewandte Chemie Vol. 26, No. 12 (1987) pp. 1201-1211. Synthesis The first indication that the reaction of SiX4 and Si yields a higher halide SinX2n+2 (n > 1) was in 1871 for the comproportionation reaction of SiCl4 vapor and Si at white heat to give Si2Cl6. This was discovered by the French chemists Louis Joseph Troost (1825 - 191) and Paul Hautefeuille (1836–1902).Troost and Hautefeuille, Ann. chim. phys. [5]7, 453 (1871). Since that time, it has been shown that gaseous silicon dihalide molecules (SiX2) are formed as intermediates in the Si/SiX4 reactions. The silicon dihalide gas molecules can be condensed at low temperatures.A. G. Massey, \\"Main Group Chemistry, 2nd Ed.,\\" Wiley & Sons (2000) p. 239. For example, if the gaseous SiF2 (difluorosilylene) produced from SiF4 (g) and Si (s) at 1100-1400°C is condensed at temperatures below -80°C and subsequently allowed to warm to room temperature, (SiF2)n is obtained. That reaction was first observed by Donald C. Pease, a DuPont scientist in 1958.D. C. Pease U. S. Patent 2,840,588, 24 June 1958. The polymerization is believed to occur via paramagnetic di-radical oligomeric intermediates like Si2F4 (•SiF2-F2Si•) and Si3F6 (•SiF2-SiF2-F2Si•),H. J. Emeleus and A. G. Sharpe, \\"Advances in Inorganic Chemistry and Radiochemistry,\\" Volume 14, Elsevier (1972), p. 151.J. L. Margrave, K. G. Sharp, P. W. Wilson \\"The Dihalides of Group IVB Elements\\" Topics in Current Chemistry, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1972. The polysilicon dihalides also form from the thermally-induced disproportionation of perhalosilanes (according to: x SinX2n+2 → x SiX4 + (n-1) (SiX2)x where n ≥ 2). For example, SiCl4 and Si forms SinCl2n cyclic oligomers (with n = 12-16) at 900-1200°C. Under conditions of high vacuum and fast pumping, SiCl2 may be isolated by rapidly quenching the reaction products or, under less stringent vacuum conditions, (SiCl2)n polymer is deposited just beyond the hot zone while the perchlorosilanes SinCl2n+2 are trapped farther downstream.M. Schmeisser, P. Voss, Z. Anorg. Allgem. Chem. 334, 50 (1964). The infrared multiphoton dissociation of trichlorosilane (HSiCl3) also yields polysilicon dichloride, (SiCl2)n, along with HCl.V. M. Apatin, V. B. Laptev, E. A. Ryabov Quantum Electron. 33 (2003), p. 894. SiBr4 and SiI4 react with Si at high temperatures to produce SiBr2 and SiI2, which polymerize on quenching.Inorganic Chemistry, Holleman-Wiberg, Academic Press (2001), pp. 849-854. Reactivity The polysilicon dihalides are generally stable under vacuum up to about 150-200°C, after which they decompose to perhalosilanes, SinX2n+2 (where n = 1 to 14), and to polysilicon monohalides. However, they are air and moisture sensitive. Polysilicon difluoride is more reactive than the heavier polysilicon dihalides. In stark contrast to its carbon analog, polytetrafluoroethylene, (SiF2)n ignites spontaneously in air, whereas (SiCl2)n inflames in dry air only when heated to 150°C.G. A. Razuvaev, T. N. Brevnova, V. V. Semenov Russ. Chem. Rev. 55, 606 (1986). The halogen atoms in polysilicon dihalides can be substituted with organic groups. For example, (SiCl2)n undergoes substitution by alcohols to give poly(dialkoxysilylene)s.J. R. Kow, M. Motonaga, M. Fujiki, R. West Macromolecules, 34(4) (2001) pp. 706-712. The polysilicon monohalides are all stable to 400°C, but are also water and air sensitive. Polysilicon monofluoride reacts more vigorously than the heavier polysilicon monohalides. For example, (SiF)n decomposes [to SiF4 and Si] above 400°C explosively.Inorganic Chemistry, Holleman-Wiberg, Academic Press (2001), pp. 849-854.

It bordered the governorate's Sharur-Daralagezsky Uyezd to the north, the Zangezursky Uyezd of the Elisabethpol Governorate to the east, and Persia to the south. It included most of the Nakhichevan exclave of present-day Azerbaijan and the southwesternmost part of the Syunik Province of present-day Armenia. Its administrative center was Nakhichevan. Geography The relief of the uyezd was mainly mountainous with most of the lowland was located along the Aras River. The highest peaks of the uyezd (Kambil at ; Damara-dag at ; and Mount Kapudzhukh at ) were located along the Karabakh Range, which made up the eastern boundary with the Elisabethpol Governorate. Kyuki-dag at rose from the Sharur-Daralagezsky Uyezd in the north. The left tributaries of the Aras (the Nakhichevan-chay, Alinja-chay, and Gilan-chay) flowed through the territory of the uyezd. History The territory of the uyezd was part of Persia's Erivan and Nakhichevan Khanates until 1828, when according to the Treaty of Turkmenchay, they were annexed to the Russian Empire. It was administered as part of the Armenian Oblast from 1828 to 1840. In 1844, the Caucasus Viceroyalty was re-established, in which the territory of the Nakhichevansky Uyezd formed part of the Tiflis Governorate. In 1849, the Erivan Governorate was established, separate from the Tiflis Governorate. It was made up of the Erivansky, Nakhchivansky, Aleksandropolsky, Novobayazetsky, and Ordubadsky Uyezds. The Ordubadsky Uyezd was abolished and incorporated into the Nakhichevansky Uyezd and the Zangezursky Uyezd of the Elisabethpol Governorate in 1868. Following administrative reforms, the northern part of the Nakhchivansky Uyezd (Daralagyoz) was separated to form part of the new Sharur- Daralagezsky Uyezd in 1870. In 1918-1920, the uyezd was disputed between the First Republic of Armenia and the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic.Tsutsiev, pp. 71–76. After the establishment of Soviet rule, most of the uyezd became part of the Nakhichevan ASSR of the Azerbaijan SSR in accordance with the treaties of Moscow and Kars, while the southeasternmost corner became part of the Armenian SSR.Tsutsiev, p. 84. Demographics According to the 1897 Russian Empire Census, the population of the uyezd was 100,771, of which 64,151 were Tatars (63.66%), 34,672 were Armenians (34.41%), 1,014 East Slavs (Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians; 1%), and 639 Kurds (0.6%). 1897 Census, Nakhichevansky Uyezd Demoscope Weekly The Tatars made up the majority of the uyezd's population, including the major cities of Nakhichevan (70.1%) and Ordubad (88.7%).

Name and origins An early arrival at what is now a small hamlet was Nebo Calvinistic Methodist Chapel, which was first established here in 1788. The chapel itself was named after Mount Nebo (now in Jordan), the mountain from which Moses is described as seeing the promised land. In 1823 the chapel was rebuilt, and the success of the chapel by the nineteenth century is shown by a religious survey of 1851. The parish of Llanwenllwyfo (now part of Llaneilian Community) was recorded as having 583 residents. The census lists two churches, of which the Anglican parish church recorded an attendance of 51, while Nebo chapel recorded the morning service of 328, afternoon 327, evening 615, indicating that the chapel was drawing in adherents from outside the parish, at a time when the Amlwch copper mining and related industries were employing large numbers of workers. The chapel was renovated in 1878, but declined in the 20th century and closed in 1966. It has subsequently been converted into flats. The chapel had become a focus for a cluster of houses spreading along the four roads leading out of the hamlet, which collectively took the name of the chapel.

In 1553, during Edward VI's reign, Penrhos was granted to John-ap-Owen (also known as John Derwas). At this time, the land consisted of little more than the Penrhos headland upon which a farm was built, originally known as Tudor House and subsequently, Penrhos. The estate was the seat of the principal land and property owners on Holy Island for over 400 years, passing into the hands of the Stanley family following the marriage of Margaret Owen to Sir John Thomas Stanley in 1763. The Stanley family were notable residents in the area. They are remembered by having the Stanley Embankment named after Edward Owen Stanley as well as Ysbyty Penrhos StanleyThe hospitals page on NHS Wales (Holyhead Hospital) and The Stanley Arms, a pub in Holyhead.A mention of the pub and three photos on holyhead.com Amongst other things he constructed a sailor's hospital in the town and Elin's Tower near South Stack. At the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Penrhos was evacuated and the house occupied by troops. During this time the house and grounds were neglected and became ruinous in places. When the war ended, the existing tenants were given the opportunity to buy their properties and the remaining estate, covering thousands of acres, was sold off. The Penrhos mansion was bought by Sir Patrick Abercrombie with a view to its partial restoration. His ambition was never realised, and the remains were systematically plundered and subsequently demolished. The Home Farm at Penrhos was bought by Captain Nigel Conant, the estate's land agent, who continued to farm some 500 acres until its sale in 1969—for the development of the Anglesey Aluminium smelting plant. Anglesey Aluminium granted public access in 1972 under the direction of Ken Williams, a local policeman and amateur naturalist. Penrhos Nature Reserve was officially opened by H.R.H. Prince Charles in 1971A BBC page on the reserve which was owned by Anglesey Aluminium.

History The work was reproduced in numerous 16th century etchings. Later, it followed an unclear series of changes of hands at Brussels and Vienna. In the 17th century, it was sold by the Spanish ambassador at Amsterdam to Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria and was cited by Rembrandt in his Saskia Dressing as Flora of London and in two portraits in Dresden and New York. Later included in the Kunsthistorisches Museum of Vienna, it was one of the works exchanged with the Uffizi. In the 18th century, it was erroneously attributed to Palma the Elder. Description It portrays an idealized beautiful woman, a model established in the Venetian school by Titian's master Giorgione with his Laura. Her left hands holds a pink-shaded mantle, while another holds a handful of flowers and leaves. The woman was portrayed by Titian in numerous other works of the period, including the Woman at the Mirror, the Vanity, Salome and Violante, as well as some Holy Conversations. The meaning of the painting is disputed: some, basing for example to inscriptions added to the 16th century reproductions, identifies the woman as a courtesan; other consider it a symbol of nuptial love, although her dress is not a dressing one. The identification with Flora, the ancient goddess of Spring and vegetation, derives from the presence of Spring flowers in her hands.

So far, the class has only one described order, Archaeorhizomycetales, family, Archaeorhizomycetaceae, and genus, Archaeorhizomyces. The class was first described by a team led by Anna Rosling in 2011. Species in the class are globally distributed, and grow in soil and around roots. Specific known host trees of various Archaeorhizomyces species include hemlock, spruce, pine and heather, but other species colonise hardwoods generally. The precise ecological role of the taxa is uncertain. While originally found to be seasonal, suggesting it was dependent on carbon compounds from the roots, when grown in culture, Archaeorhizomyces finlayi, was shown to be able to grow using either glucose or cellulose as its sole source of carbon, suggesting \\"that it may be involved in decomposition and not require direct carbon transfer from the plant through symbiosis\\". While the ecological role is not yet clear, preliminary tests suggest that the fungus is neither a pathogen nor an ectomycorrhizal symbiont. Prior to the description by Rosling and colleagues, Archaeorhizomycetes was referred to as Soil Clone Group 1 or SCGI after it was originally discovered tundra soils and reported in 2003 by Schadt et al. The taxa were only known from ribosomal DNA sequencing but it had been found independently in ecological studies of soil in more than fifty cases worldwide using three different gene regions. However, neither fruit bodies nor spores had been observed. The name Archaeorhizomyces comes from the Greek ', meaning ancient, which is in reference to the basality of the fungus, ', in reference to roots, and ', in reference to fungi. Archaeorhizomyces finlayi, (named in honour of Roger D. Finlay) was the first species described. It is known from Scandinavia and North America. A second species Archaeorhizomyces borealis was described in 2014 together with an estimate that the class may consist of close to 500 species based on sequences available in public databases.

He fought for the partisan side in the Greek Civil War. Belli was repeatedly prosecuted and sentenced to prison for his political views, and was altogether imprisoned for 11 years, and forced into exile for another 18. Belli wrote several influential books on the Turkish left and was, for many years, a source of inspiration for leftist Turkish youths. Early life Belli was born in 1916 in Silivri, then in the Ottoman Empire, to Mahmut Hayrettin Bey, later a prominent leader of the Turkish War of Independence in Urfa. He was educated at Robert College in Istanbul, and in 1936 went on to study economics at the University of Mississippi in the United States. There he was introduced to Marxist thought and revolutionary action. He took part in the activities of the civil rights movement in Mississippi. Return to Turkey Belli returned to Turkey in 1940, where he joined the illegal Communist Party of Turkey (TKP). Turkey was at the time under a one- party regime. The government, under the influence of the German advances in the initial years of World War II, had abandoned its policy of friendship with the USSR. The only opposition party in Turkey in these days was the underground TKP. Belli, after returning to Turkey, contacted the illegal party via his elementary-school friend David Nea, who was the party secretary for Istanbul at the time. Belli became a member of the central committee of the TKP in 1942. He served as assistant professor with professor Fritz Neumark at the Faculty of Economics of Istanbul University in the years 1943–1944. There he was among the founders and organizers of the İlerici Gençler Birliği (Progressive Youth Union).Not to be confused with the later Progressive Youth Association. In 1944 he was arrested for these activities and sentenced to two years imprisonment and exile. Greek Civil War Belli left Turkey in 1946, and joined the Greek Civil War as a guerrilla fighter. He rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the Democratic Army of Greece. He was wounded twice in battle, and was treated in Bulgaria and the USSR. In 1950 he was imprisoned in Turkey for a short while for entry without a passport and illegal possession of a handgun. Shortly after his release, he was imprisoned again in 1951 in a wave of TKP arrests. This time he was sentenced to seven years in prison and two years and four months of forced relocation. A documentary about his time in Greece, entitled \\"Καπετάν Κεμάλ, ο σύντροφος\\" (\\"Captain Kemal, A Comrade\\"; Turkish title \\"Kaptan Kemal, Bir Yoldaş\\") was made by the prominent Greek filmmaker Fotos Lamprinos. Turkish revolutionary movement During the 1960s, Belli could write and speak without having to use an alias. Nevertheless, also in that period he served prison time for various articles and speeches. He was part of the group who published the revolutionary magazines Türk Solu and Aydınlık Sosyalist Dergi. Expelled from the TKP, he joined the newly formed Workers Party of Turkey (TİP). At this time, he developed his well-known thesis known as Milli Demokratik Devrim (National Democratic Revolution), abbreviated MDD. With his friends, he contacted Deniz Gezmiş and Mahir Çayan, who were at the time leaders of the youth movement amassing popular support. The ideas of MDD quickly gained prominence among the leftist youth movement; it became the main theoretical framework for most of the leftist groups that flourished in Turkey in that period and played a key role in the '68 movement in Turkey, giving it a Marxist and revolutionary characteristic. Mihri Belli left Turkey after the 1971 military coup to avoid arrest, and was for a while a guest of the Palestinian Liberation Organization. He returned to Turkey briefly, en route to Western Europe. There he stayed for a while and helped with the magazine Yurtsever (Patriot). He was back in Turkey when the centre-left Republican People's Party (CHP) under Ecevit emerged as the largest party in the 1973 elections. After the amnesty of 1974, he founded the Labour Party of Turkey (TEP) in 1975. Immediately after the founding of the party, the prosecutor's office of the Martial Law Court took notice and demanded the removal of the word Kurd from the party program and other documents. The Constitutional Court banned the TEP for demanding equal rights for Kurds. In 1979, Belli faced an assassination attempt in which he was severely injured. After the 1980 military coup, he left for the Middle East. From there he moved to Sweden, where he followed the Kurdish movement closely until he returned to Turkey in 1992. In 1997 he met with Abdullah Öcalan, where they came to the common conclusion that a solution to the Kurdish issue under the umbrella of a unitarian state, instead of a federative solution, was possible on the basis of equality and voluntary union. The report of this meeting was later published in book form. In 1996 Belli participated in the founding of the Freedom and Solidarity Party (ÖDP), and that of the Socialist Democracy Party (SDP) in 2002. He was a candidate for member of parliament for Istanbul in the 2002 elections. In 2005, the portraits Belli had made 50 years earlier, while in prison, were presented in an exhibition \\"Lines From Prison\\". Together with several other founding members he resigned from the SDP in 2007 and took part in the 2008 founding of the Workers' Socialist Party (İşçilerin Sosyalist Partisi), better known by the shortened name Socialist Party (Sosyalist Parti), along with others who left.

Wings in the Dark was produced by Arthur Hornblow, Jr. The film was the first that Loy and Grant made together, although Loy's biographer Emily Leider says that Wings in the Dark \\"wastes their talents and prompts an unintentional laugh fest.\\"Leider 2011, p. 151. The film remains notable as a rare movie depiction of a blind protagonist (played by Grant) during the 1930s, and is also known for its accomplished aerial photography directed by Dewey Wrigley. Plot Cary Grant and Lightning in Wings in the Dark Skywriter and stunt pilot Sheila Mason (Myrna Loy) who has to work as a barnstormer because women were not allowed in other aviation fields, is attracted to ace pilot Ken Gordon (Cary Grant). Ken is trying to perfect instrument flying (flying \\"blind\\"), with his own design of an autopilot. He has devoted four years to perfecting the system and even mortgaged his aircraft to finance his experiments. Before being able to prove his invention works, a stove accident blinds him. The doctors cannot say for how long. When Ken retreats from the world, Mac (Hobart Cavanaugh), his friend and partner, brings him Lightning, a seeing eye dog. He first resists any efforts to help him, but with the help of his dog, he learns to navigate around his household and soon keeps busy by writing aviation articles. Sheila, who has fallen in love with Ken, does not tell him that the articles are all being rejected. She gives him money to survive by taking on dangerous stunts arranged by her manager, Nick Williams (Roscoe Karns). Ken finally regains his confidence and continues to work on his autopilot when the Rockwell Aviation Company, based at Roosevelt Field near New York, repossesses his aircraft. Distraught, Ken accuses Sheila of falling for him out of pity and sends her away. She plans a solo flight from Moscow to New York to win a $25,000 prize so they can marry. Her last stage from Boston to New York finds Sheila nearly out of fuel and running into bad weather. She navigates by looking down to see where she is, but over Roosevelt Field, the fog is so heavy that she may not be able to land. With help from Mac, Ken sneaks into his old aircraft and takes off, using his autopilot to help Sheila land. While in the air, Ken talks to Sheila about his desperation of being blind and not having any future. His intention is to bring her to the ground and then fly until he runs out of fuel and crashes. Sheila tries to dissuade him, but he is determined. The two pilots make it down, but Sheila deliberately crashes into Ken's aircraft to make sure that he will not try to kill himself. A huge crowd has gathered at the airport. As the two greet the public and the press, Ken sees flashes of light from the exploding flash bulbs of the photographers. Ken and Sheila embrace as their car continues through the throng of well-wishers.

The whole council was up for election and the Conservative Party gained overall control of the council from no overall control. Background Since the 2003 election the council was controlled by a coalition between the Liberal Democrat and Labour parties. Many of the swing wards on the council were in Weston-super-Mare, with a major issue in the town being the derelict Tropicana lido. The high number of pensioners in the town and lack of things for young people to do in the new estates were also factors in the area.

Both the Liberal Democrat and Labour parties suffered heavy losses, with the defeated councillors including Liberal Democrat Isabel Cummings in Yatton after 15 years on the council and the Labour couple Derek and Muriel Kraft.

Only one example of this single-seat, wooden aircraft was built. Design and development The RFD Company constructed the Albatross to C.H. Latimer-Needham's design, the first British- designed and built sailplane. It was a conventional wooden single-seat aircraft, its cantilever high wing having a constant chord centre section and outboard straight-tapered panels from about mid-span. Ailerons were fitted from the wing tips over most of the outboard sections but here were no flaps or air brakes. The wing was mounted with slight dihedral on top of the fuselage, which was rectangular in cross section and tapered only a little towards the tail. There were no fixed rear surfaces, both elevators and rudder being all moving. The elevator, mounted on top of the fuselage, had constant chord apart from a cut-out for rudder movement; the latter was tall, with a vertical leading edge and curved trailing edge. The Albatross's single-seat open cockpit was at the leading edge of the wing, with a fairing behind the pilot's head reaching aft beyond the trailing edge. Originally it landed on a skid which was part of a V-shaped ventral extension of the fuselage, running from just behind the nose about half the length of the aircraft.

History The work was perhaps in Emperor Rudolf II's gallery in Prague, before becoming part of that of the Electors of Bavaria. It has part of the Munich museum's collection since 1884. The first mention dates to 1748, as a work by Francesco Salviati. It was later attributed to Palma the Elder, Giorgione, il Pordenone and finally Titian. Radio analysis has proved the presence of workshop additions (in particular to the mirror) above an original, probably by Titian, based on the Woman at the Mirror. Description The painting portrays an idealized beautiful woman, a model established in the Venetian school by Titian's master Giorgione with his Laura. She holds an oval mirror with a frame, which reflects some jewels and a maid who is searching in a case.

Victor has described his style as a mix of fusion, soul, rock, and blues, using amount a lot of sweeping and legato in his playing. His main influences are Al Di Meola, Jimi Hendrix, Tony MacAlpine, J. J. Cale, Yngwie Malmsteen and Paul Gilbert. Music career Victor was born on the island of St Lucia. At the age of seven, he started playing guitar. He attended high school in the USVI where he played guitar in the jazz band. He went to college in Minnesota, where he performed regularly and had the opportunity to open for BeBe Winans and White Heart. In 1987, he was asked to audition for a funk band called FTE (created out of \\"The Time\\" Fame). Victor was soon asked to be the guitar teacher for Mercedes, an all- female band produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. During this time, he was a sought-after studio musician in Minneapolis and was asked to join the band Alice. In 1991, he won the second of his four Guitar Wars contests. In the late 90s, Victor played to sold out shows with the musical Beehive, a theatrical production about women who shaped music from the 60's to the 70's. He also played two concert events for Ron Kenoly. In 2006 and 2007, Victor played concerts with Hillsong Church, led by Darlene Zschech, and by 2009, he was approached by Quickstar Productions to use his song \\"Send Me an Angel\\" on their compilation CD Unified by Grace, a project in which proceeds would go to help orphanages in Africa. He completed and released his solo CD, Time Machine in 2010.

It is usually dated to around 1515 and is now in the Doria Pamphilj Gallery in Rome. Like other paintings of this subject,Ciletti, 50 it has sometimes been considered to represent Judith with the Head of Holofernes, the other biblical incident found in art showing a female and a severed male head .DP. Safarik's official guide of 1993 calls it \\"Judith with the Head of Holofernes (known as Salome)\\", but in 2017 the museum website called it Salome. See below also. Historically, the main figure has also been called Herodias, the mother of Salome. Sometimes attributed to Giorgione, the painting is now usually seen as one where Titian's personal style can be seen in development, with a \\"sense of physical proximity and involvement of the viewer\\", in which \\"expert handling of the malleable oil medium enabled the artist to evoke the sensation of softly spun hair upon creamy flesh\\".Jaffé, 72 Erwin Panofsky suggested the head of John the Baptist might be a self-portrait,Robertson, 220; Hale, 147; Neginsky, 96 quotes him, 98–99; Falomir and it is possible that Titian was alluding to his private life with the model, anticipating Cristofano Allori's, Judith with the Head of Holofernes (1613, Royal Collection, and other versions), where the severed head was a self-portrait and Judith and the maid portraits of his ex- mistress and her mother.Neginsky, 96 The model here, allowing for a degree of idealization, has been said to be the same used in the Dresden Venus (Giorgione and Titian, c. 1510) and Venus and Cupid (c.1510-1515).Hale, 147; Robertson, 219 This composition was copied many times, in some cases at least by Titian's workshop.Norton; Robertson, 219 Salome, Judith or Herodias? Lighter image, with clearer view of the background cupid and fittings The possible provenance of the painting begins in 1533, with a Judith by Titian recorded in the collection of Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, a very important patron of Titian. No other surviving Titian painting seems to fit this record, so if it is not the painting now in Rome, it must be lost.Safarik, 12 In 1592 Duke Alfonso's granddaughter, Lucrezia d'Este (1535–1598) owned a painting described as a \\"Herodias\\" (Salome's mother).Again, that this is the same painting is uncertain, but endorsed by Safarik, apparently Harold Wethey, and others. What is certainly the Doria Pamphilj painting belonged by 1603 to Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini before passing to his niece Olimpia Aldobrandini, whose second husband was the ex- cardinal Camillo Pamphilj; since then it has passed by descent through the family.DP In the 18th century the painting was called a Herodias, but a number of foreign visitors who saw it record thinking the main figure to be Judith.Safarik, 12 If the painting's main figure was Herodias, traditionally seen as the prime mover of the conspiracy to get John the Baptist executed, the younger woman next to her would be intended to represent her daughter Salome,Safarik, 12 here shown as a figure in thrall to her more glamourous mother. The identification as Herodias seems to have no recent supporters, but that as Judith does.Including: Joannides, 250; Safarik, 12, and Peter Humfrey in his Titian, 2007, which lists it as \\"Judith (?), c. 1516\\" A medieval addition to the Salome legend held that, as well as her mother's hatred of John for his preaching against her, Salome was also motivated by a frustrated love for John, to which the cupid might refer.Neginsky, 96–98 Her face is turned away from his head, but her eyes look back to it. Panofsky describes her as: \\"Meditative, sad and a little benumbed, she seems to recoil from the face of St. John which yet attracts her sidelong glances with irresistible force\\". Meanwhile, the maid \\"looks at the heroine with the eyes of a faithful dog who feels and shares his master's distress without comprehending its cause\\".Panofsky, quoted in Neginsky, 96 Thus, in the pyramidal group of figures,Falomir the glances flow from the maid on the left, up to Salome at centre, and down to John at right, whose dead eyes are closed. The use of erotic allure on male figures of power is the core of both stories, but to the church and Titian's contemporaries, Herodias and Salome were bad, but Judith a heroine.Safarik, 12 Both stories were part of the repertoire of the Power of Women topos, mainly a feature of German art in this period, but whose subjects were also depicted in Italy.Ciletti, 35–52 and especially 45–52 The small Cupid at the top of the arch reinforces the eroticism of the treatment, suggesting either Salome's lust for John,Neginsky, 96 (or Herod's implied attraction to Salome) or that of Holfernes for Judith,Joannides, 250 according to choice. It has also been suggested that the use of cupids on the keystone of arches was common in public buildings of the period in Venice, which \\"stresses the official nature of St. John's imprisonment and execution\\".Robertson, 219–220 The presence of a maidservant is usual in depictions of Judith (following the Book of Judith, which mentions her), but not in those of Salome with the head of John the Baptist.Hall, 173–174, 181. But there are exceptions both ways – Judith with no maid, Salome with one. See Joannides, 250 On the other hand, the head on a dish is normally associated with Salome's story, and is mentioned in the gospel,Mark: 6, 21–18 while Judith often puts hers in a sack, or carries it by the hair, both also following the text of their story.Book of Judith, Chapter 13, 9–10: \\"After which, she went out and gave the head of Holofernes to her maid, who put it in her food bag\\", and after their return, 15: \\"She pulled the head out of the bag and held it for them to see.\\", online A single lock of hair falling over the face was considered highly alluring, and associated with courtesans, perhaps suggesting Salome is indeed the subject,Hale, 147; Jaffé, 72 though Judith is described as using every effort to dress seductively.Judith, Ch 10: \\"3 There she removed the sackcloth she was wearing and taking off her widow's dress, she washed all over, anointed herself plentifully with perfumes, dressed her hair, wrapped a turban round it and put on the robe of joy she used to wear when her husband Manasseh was alive. 4 She put sandals on her feet, put on her necklaces, bracelets, rings, earrings and all her jewellery, and made herself beautiful enough to beguile the eye of any man who saw her.\\" The murky background at the left includes a fitting at the top, between the two women's heads, which is described as a lock by Panofsky, though it might be a hinge also.Neginsky, 96 This marks the vertical edge of a zone with a slightly different tint, perhaps showing the transition from a door to a wall. What could be an iron bar, or door top, is to the left of the fitting. The Pasadena version also shows a fitting and change in colour. This suggests the paintings show the women leaving the prison where John was killed, to return with the head to the head to Herod's feast, a version of the story often shown in art, though not exactly following the gospel, in which a soldier presents the head on a dish to Herod, who gives it to Salome, who in turn gives it to her mother.Mark 6, 21–28: \\"So the king immediately sent a bodyguard and commanded him to bring John’s head. So he went off and beheaded him in the prison and brought his head on a platter. He gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.\\" The biblical text is very clear that Holofernes is assassinated in his tent in his camp, and the scene (rare in art) where Judith shows the head to the people of Bethulia happens at night inside the city gate, so the background of the painting is difficult to reconcile with a depiction of Judith. Attribution and date As with other small Titians from the 1510s, the attribution has wavered over the centuries, beginning with Titian in early records, but (almost inevitably) becoming attributed to Giorgione by the 19th century, until Crowe and Cavalcaselle attributed it to il Pordenone. By the end of that century it was once again attributed by most to Titian, which has remained the usual view among experts.Robertson, 219; DP The Norton Simon Museum version was attributed to Titian in sales in England between 1801 and 1859, but a sale in London in 1891 called it a Giorgione.Norton Though a date of about 1515 has long been the usual view, purely on stylistic grounds, Charles Hope has suggested about 1511. This is partly because of its relationship to Sebastiano del Piombo's Salome of 1510 (National Gallery), where the setting also moves from dark at the left to light at the right.Robertson, 219; Hale, 147; National Gallery page This has also been regarded by some as a \\"Judith\\".Joannides, 250 Context Version in the Norton Simon Museum The painting relates to two different types of painting found in Venetian painting in the years dominated by Giorgione, including his posthumous influence. The first is a number of Venetian paintings of the 1510s showing two or three half-length figures with heads close together, often with their expressions and interactions enigmatic. Many of these are \\"Giorgionesque\\" genre or tronie subjects where the subjects are anonymous. But Titian's Lucretia and her Husband shows a specific subject, even if views differ as to the point in the story shown.See the discussion on the early copy in the Royal Collection: Royal Collection, \\"After Titian (c. 1488-Venice 1576), Tarquin and Lucretia, c. 1514–15, Oil on panel, RCIN 402681 His Bravo may have a specific subject;Jaffé, 98 both of these are now in Vienna. The Lovers (Royal Collection) probably does not. His Tribute Money (Dresden, c. 1516) has a clear subject, also from the New Testament.Jaffé, 98; Hale, 162 The other type it relates to is Titian's series of belle donne half-length female figures from the mid-1510s,Hale, 146–147 which also includes Lucretia and her Husband, as well as the single figures of Flora at the Uffizi,Jaffé, 96; Hale, 147 the Woman with a Mirror at the Louvre, the Violante and Vanity in Munich. Most of these have the appearance of portraits, and were sometimes regarded as contemporaries as portraits of leading Venetian courtesans, but are best thought of as idealized figures of beautiful women which may only loosely reflect any individual. This type was more long-lived in Venetian painting, and made by many other artists; Palma Vecchio for one made a speciality of them.Jaffé, 96; Hale, 146 Versions There are several early repetitions that might be by Titian or his workshop, or both. A version now in the Norton Simon Museum, Pasadena has been considered to be the best of the workshop versions. It was also in the Doria Pamphilj collection between Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini at the start of the 17th century and 1797–98 during the French revolutionary invasion of Italy, when much Italian art was sold, mostly to the English, in anticipation of the French looting it otherwise. William Young Ottley was the initial purchaser, who took it to London and sold it in 1801.Safarik, 12; Norton Another version that was part of the collections of Prince Salviati, Christina of Sweden and of Prince Odescalchi is now owned by the real estate magnate Luke Brugnara. That Salome was also attributed to il Pordenone and Giorgione, and finally to Titian in the late 19th century. Other compositions of Salome and Judith Titian painted Salome in at least one later composition, from the 1550s, with the dish holding the head held above her head (Prado), possibly using his daughter Lavinia as the model.Falomir; Neginsky, 99–100 Another composition has recently resurfaced, which dates from the 1560s; as of 2012, this is in the National Museum of Western Art, Tokyo.Falomir; National Museum of Western Art page on their version.

He is known for his religious compositions, marine scenes and portraits. Life Abraham Matthijs was born in Antwerp as the son of the fishmonger Hendrik Matthijs and Margaretha van Roubergen. His parents were relatively well-off as they owned their own house on the Vismarkt. At the age of 10 Abraham he was registered at the Antwerp Guild of St. Luke as a pupil of Tobias Verhaecht, a landscape painter who had been the first teacher of Rubens.Frans Jozef Peter Van den Branden, Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche schilderschool, Antwerpen, 1883, p. 633-636 Ph.

Little is known about his residence or his work in Italy. He was back in Antwerp in 1619. Abraham became a master in the Antwerp Guild of St. Luke in 1619 and had a pupil called Fransoeis Cosyn in that year.Ph. Rombouts and Th. van Lerius, Volume 1, p. 559 He left Antwerp not long after that and was absent from Antwerp from 1619 until the end of 1623. From 1633 to 1644 he received a pupil almost annually. He remained a bachelor his whole life and became a member of the Third Order Regular of St. Francis of Penance. He had an active role in the Sodaliteit der Jongmans van den Zoeten Naem Jesus, a fraternity for bachelors established in the Dominican church in Antwerp. In 1632 and 1637 Matthijs was the prefect of the Sodaliteit. Matthijs was commercially successful and bought his own house. He became an avid art collector. His collection came to hold 340 paintings as well as numerous drawings and sculptures. The works included originals and copies of Italian masters, landscapes and a portrait of Paul Bril, two portraits of saints by Anthony van Dyck and two portraits and a self-portrait by Rubens painted during his youth, which is lost. Whalers in the ice Matthys suffered from a weak constitution and on 17 and 19 September 1638 he was so ill that he drew up a will. He did not die then but more than 10 years later on 2 September 1649. He had before his death made arrangements to be buried in the habit of the Franciscans in the church of the Franciscans. He had also commenced a painting to be hung over his grave in the church which was unfinished at the time of his death. Work Abraham Matthijs is known for religious paintings, portraits and marine scenes. Only very few of his works are preserved. One of them depicts The death of Maria (1633, Cathedral of Our Lady (Antwerp)). This work shows that the artist was still steeped in the style of the generation of painters preceding the Baroque innovations introduced in Antwerp by Rubens. Matthijs' palette in this work was muted and unbalanced. The figures in the composition are also not well arranged. He also painted an Assumption of Mary for a local monastery. He further painted a portrait of the marine painter Bonaventura Peeters the Elder, which hangs in the church of Our Lady in Hoboken, near Antwerp, where Peeters is buried.

It is a brick structure built in the 1880s that is often described as one of the city's major landmarks, its \\"crown jewel\\". In 1986 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is operated by Auberge Resorts. It was built by Jerome B. Wheeler, at the time co-owner of Macy's and a major investor in Aspen during its early boom years. He wanted the city to have a hotel that equaled European ones in its refinements and amenities. It was one of the first buildings west of the Mississippi to have full electric lighting and it has the only above ground ballroom in Aspen. It was the only hotel to remain open through the city's \\"quiet years\\" in the early 20th century, as a family business run by a former bartender and his son that often served as the town's social center. During Prohibition a celebrated spiked drink, the Aspen Crud, was invented at its J-Bar. Later, the drink and bar became popular with members of the Tenth Mountain Division while they trained in the area. After the war, Aspen and its new ski resort became a popular destination, and celebrities vacationing in Aspen like Gary Cooper and John Wayne often stayed at the Jerome, and it became known as a place where they and the locals freely mingled. Hunter S. Thompson used the J-Bar as his de facto office; later the hotel ballroom hosted his memorial service. Bill Murray partied there while portraying Thompson in a film, and the J-Bar also inspired a song by Glenn Frey, who had gone there often with his bandmates while a member of The Eagles. Building The Jerome occupies a lot on the northwest corner of the North Mill Street intersection. The neighborhood is densely developed with many other commercial properties. Some of them, such as the Pitkin County Courthouse two blocks to the east, Aspen City Hall to the southeast, Collins Block and Wheeler Opera House to the south along Mill Street, have been listed on the Register themselves. At the opposite end of the block, across the street, is the Thomas Hynes House, a former miner's cottage now used as a restaurant and also on the Register. To the north the terrain, level between the hotel and the slopes of Aspen Mountain, begins to slope gently toward the Roaring Fork River, which flows through Rio Grande Park two blocks to the north. The building itself is a three-story 12-by-11-bay brick structure, with a small hyphen connecting the main block to a north wing of similar shape and size. Both are topped by a flat roof. The slight grade to the north exposes their basements slightly. alt=The hotel seen from directly in front of it, across the street Its south (front) facade has a wooden hood, topped with a balcony balustraded in turned wooden spindles and supported by narrow iron columns, covering the sidewalk at the centrally located recessed main entrance. It is flanked by two small aspen trees on either side at the street. Smooth round columns on square bases support a molded cornice with metal letters spelling \\"Hotel Jerome\\" on the east and west. The middle six bays of the facade project slightly, separated by pilasters with foliated caps, forming a tall arcade. On either side of the front entrance are large windows with a small rectangular pane atop a larger one. All have sills of locally quarried rough cut peachblow sandstone, which continues around the building as a stringcourse and water table. Sandstone also forms a frieze, interrupted by the windows, below the molded tin cornice. At the ends of the facade are wood and glass storefronts, housing two of the hotel's three restaurants, the J-Bar on the west and Library on the east. Windows on the second story's central projection are one-over-one double-hung sash windows with transoms and sandstone sills and lintels. In the middle two the words \\"Hotel\\" and \\"Jerome\\" are carved. They are recessed slightly between brick pilasters with sandstone bases and capitals with decorative carvings. On the flanks the windows are set in round segmental arches laid with several rows of splayed brick and topped with brick voussoirs. They, too have sandstone sills and a sandstone course runs around the building at the arches' springline. At the third story the four-pane center windows, also recessed, have a similar round-arched treatment as the flanking second-story windows. On the sides are four one-over-one sash windows with sandstone sills and small decorations between them. At the lintel is a dentilled, fluted wooden frieze that continues around the entire building save the front portico. Above it is ridged metal convex cornice that marks the roofline. It is topped by a parapet with four rows of recessed square panels. A flagpole is located in the center of the roof at the front. The east face has a similar, more restrained treatment, with the sandstone trim, stringcourses, cornices, and fenestration. On the west side, there is little decoration other than the segmental splayed- brick arches on the windows. The brick annex on the north side is non- contributing as it was not part of the original building. Inside many original finishes remain. The lobby has been restored to its original appearance. From the lobby hallways lead to the Garden Terrace restaurant in a western annex, with an adjacent outdoor terrace south of the swimming pool. The first floor is also home to several meeting spaces, including the Grand Ballroom in the northeast corner of the rear block, the only above ground ballroom in Aspen, with ceilings. On the upper floors there are 94 guest rooms. They range from in size, from single rooms to suites. Standard amenities include marble vanities in the bathrooms, high-speed Internet access, a DVD player, fully stocked mini-bar and beds with 300-thread count linens. Their configuration has changed considerably from their original layout. History The Jerome's history parallels Aspen's. It was opened with grand ambitions in the city's early boom years and survived as Aspen's only hotel during the city's long \\"quiet years\\" in the early 20th century, under the ownership of the Elisha family. With the development of skiing after World War II, it began to see a new potential realized only with major renovations at the end of the 20th century that made it the upscale hotel it is today. =1889–1892: Construction and early boom years= In the late 1870s, prospectors venturing west from Leadville in search of silver veins crossed the Continental Divide at Independence Pass and continued down the Roaring Fork Valley to establish several mining camps. One of them, at the confluence of the Roaring Fork and Castle Creek, became the area's pre-eminent settlement by 1879. At first it was called Ute City, after the local Native American tribe, but by the early 1880s it had been renamed Aspen, after the trees abundant in the area. Jerome Wheeler, at the time co-owner of Macy's, visited Aspen in 1883 while on vacation in Colorado. He was impressed by the potential he saw, and began investing in the community, completing a smelter started earlier so that ore did not have to be taken back to Leadville. After winning a legal battle over the rights to the Smuggler Mine, the richest lode in the area, and leaving Macy's, he commissioned the building of the hotel and the Wheeler Opera House, both bearing his name, and a house in the city's residential West End. Wheeler meant for the hotel to be the equal of great European hotels such as Claridge's in London and the George-V in Paris. He loaned $60,000 ($ in modern dollars) to another local innkeeper to build the hotel. Costs escalated to more than twice that, and a month before the hotel was set to open the builders left town unexpectedly, leaving Wheeler owing approximately $150,000 ($ in modern dollars). \\"[He had] discovered the first rule of building in Aspen: it always costs way more than you planned\\", observed a commentator over a century later. It was one of the first buildings west of the Mississippi to have full electric lighting. Other amenities included running water and indoor plumbing, steam heat and an elevator. At the time of its opening, on the night before Thanksgiving, it had 90 rooms (or 76, according to some accounts), which rented for up to $4 ($ in modern dollars) a night. Early guests included Wheeler's business friends from the East, theater stars of the era and wealthy travelers. As its builder had intended, it occupied the most commanding location in the city.Rohrbough, 168. alt=A black-and-white photographic portrait of a man with a thick beard and mustache wearing a high collar and jacket. It is faded around the edges. Three years after its completion, in 1892, Wheeler sold the hotel to a Denver man named Archie Fisk for $125,000 ($ in modern dollars) as part of a general liquidation of his Aspen assets after losing a lengthy lawsuit over a mining deal.Smith, Stacey; , Aspen Historical Society, December 1998, retrieved August 22, 2011, p. 39. Page number refers to those used by the reading software and not those in the actual document. The next year, in response to the Panic of 1893, Congress repealed the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, ending the Colorado Silver Boom and with it Aspen's early boom years. Fisk could not pay taxes on the property, and it soon became the property of Pitkin County, and then became Wheeler's again. It remained the center of the city's social life, partially because it had the only public bathroom downtown. =1893–1946: The quiet years= Over the next several decades, a period that came to be known later as \\"the quiet years\\", the town's population declined from thousands to hundreds. The Jerome remained open, the city's only hotel, often becoming by default a boardinghouse. In 1911 ownership passed to local businessman Mansor Elisha, a Syrian American drummer with a travelling band who had stopped in Aspen, taken a job as the Jerome's bartender, and later acquired the hotel from Wheeler, who had by this time long left the city and was unable to pay the taxes as he had gone bankrupt. In 1918, the Jerome's parlors served as morgues during the flu epidemic. The next year Elisha threw a welcome-home dance for local soldiers returning from World War I in 1919. Prohibition had started by then, and to survive the J-Bar became a soda fountain. Liquor service continued, in the form of a popular drink called the Aspen Crud, still served there today, that is essentially a vanilla ice cream soda or milkshake generously spiked with bourbon. Whole families were known to stop by after church and share one. Mansor Elisha died in 1935, leaving his son Laurence in charge of the hotel. The following year the seeds were planted for the city's recovery when Tom Flynn, a former resident trying to sell some of his mining claims, showed pictures of them to Billy Fiske, a U.S. Olympic bobsledder who had competed at the Winter Olympics earlier that year. He saw perfect terrain for a ski resort, and went out to Aspen and bought some land. Over that winter the newly formed Highland Bavarian ski club built its first ski near Ashcroft. Its first two guides, Swiss skier André Roch and Austrian mountaineer Gunther Langes, lived in the Jerome for five weeks while the lodge was finished.Lund and Hayes, 15–16. A crude ski lift was later built in Aspen itself, the beginnings of today's ski resort. The outbreak of World War II put further skiing development on hold, but not skiing itself as the U.S. Army's Tenth Mountain Division's \\"soldiers on skis\\" began training at nearby Camp Hale. After one long cross-country skiing exercise over the mountains the soldiers went, still on skis, straight to the Jerome where Laurence Elisha, then the owner, let them spend the night and offered them free drinks. Many were struck by the vintage decor. \\"The only thing missing was a bunch of trail-worn cowboys or dirt-stained miners bellied up to the bar\\", one observed. Throughout their training, Elisha offered them a room and a steak dinner for a dollar a night. It became a popular for the Tenth's trainees on weekend leave, since Leadville was off-limits and Denver was a lot farther away. =1946–1984: Ski resort and celebrity hangout= After the war some veterans of the Tenth returned to Aspen, including Friedl Pfeifer, another Austrian who had been involved in developing the ski resort before the war. In 1946 Walter Paepcke, then president of the Container Corporation of America, visited the city with his wife Elizabeth. The couple were looking for a place in the mountains of Colorado that would be ideal for an American counterpart to the Salzburg Festival. Aspen had many rundown neglected buildings lat the time, but they saw a lot of Victorian charm that could be brought back to life. They were cheap, and Paepcke bought or leased many, including the Jerome. Pfeifer also convinced him of the area's skiing potential, and Paepcke invested the money in the Aspen Skiing Company that Pfeifer had founded.Lund and Hayes, 19. That allowed the completion of Ski Lift No. 1, claimed to be the longest in the world. Its gala opening in January 1947 was the end of Aspen's \\"quiet years\\". As he had done with his other Aspen acquisitions, Paepcke commissioned Austrian Bauhaus architect Herbert Bayer to renovate the Jerome. Bayer's main change on the outside was to paint the exterior a light grey color, with blue accents on the window arches in a color called \\"Bayer blue\\", a change that was not popular with most longtime residents, who preferred the original brick. The pool and poolhouse were also added. Inside, the maple bar was completely restored, and moved along with the front desk to its present location. The Aspen Institute leased the hotel to provide space for participants and staff, and the renovations reduced the available rooms to 39. A new swimming pool was built, and it soon became the first place in Aspen where celebrities could be seen. In addition to movie stars of the era like Gary Cooper, Lana Turner and John Wayne, intellectual Mortimer Adler, helping to lead the Aspen Institute in its early days, could be seen lounging around it. The actors routinely stayed in the same suite on the second floor, and children in the city frequently knocked on its door to collect autographs. Writer Evelyn Ames called the Jerome during this period \\"a surprisingly heady brew ... of Europe and the corner drugstore, of poets and cowboy boots.\\" In the 1960s, as the city steadily grew as a ski town, the Jerome declined. It was closed for several years. When John Gilmore bought it in 1968 and reduced it to 34 rooms, he rented them for a mere $5 ($ in modern dollars) a night. Many of the younger people who were increasingly drawn to Aspen sneaked in to take showers on the third floor. He tried to interest investors in rehabilitating the building, but could not. He was able to add new entrances to the storefronts, however. The influx of newcomers to Aspen at the time were largely hippies and other countercultural types of the era. They were attracted to Aspen by its natural beauty, skiing and remoteness from larger population centers. It had been popularized in the writings of gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson, himself a transplant to the area who had almost been elected Pitkin County sheriff on a promise to put profiteering drug dealers in the stocks on the lawn of the county courthouse. During the 1970s, he was a regular at the J-Bar, coming in from his home in nearby Woody Creek to pick up his mail and then hang out at the bar, drinking, eating and watching television as it had the best reception in the area prior to cable becoming widespread. \\"It was his office\\", one bartender from the time recalled. \\"If people wanted to meet Hunter, they'd come to the Jerome.\\" Early in the decade, a new Los Angeles band known at the time as Teen King and the Emergencies went up to Aspen to perfect their country rock sound before releasing their first album as The Eagles. Their members also became familiar sights at the J-Bar, along with fellow musician Jimmy Buffett and another rising Hollywood star, Jack Nicholson. Aspen's first disco, The Rocking Horse, was opened in the basement along with a Moroccan-themed restaurant featuring belly dancers. Bill Murray stayed at the Jerome in 1980 while filming Where the Buffalo Roam, based on Thompson's life, and the nightly parties that started in the J-Bar continued in his suite. After the Eagles broke up, Glenn Frey took the \\"large convention of young monsters\\" at the J-Bar as inspiration for his 1982 single \\"Partytown\\". \\"Everybody getting high on whatever's there, everything, all the time.\\" =1985–present: Renovation and restoration= Hotel Jerome and Main Street, 2010 In 1985 a group of investors headed by a local developer, Rick Butera, bought the Jerome for $6 million ($ in modern dollars) and began the restoration Gilmore had tried to begin 17 years earlier, a project that cost more than quadruple the purchase price. The structural system was restored. All the original finishes on the inside were brought back to their original appearance. On the outside, Bayer's paint scheme was blasted off in favor of the original brick. The last change was as popular with the community as the original paint scheme had not been. In her 1991 romance novel Aspen Gold, Janet Dailey praised the result: \\"... once again, the Hotel Jerome stood in stately dignity ... no longer a symbol of Aspen's rich past but a vital part of its present.\\" The Hotel Jerome logo was designed by Jamie Koval from The Marlow Group. Around the turn of the 20th century two further renovations took place. The first, in 1998, used photographs over a century old to restore the J-Bar's original appearance. Four years later, a $6 million project added a new rear wing and grand ballroom, and restored the guest rooms. Hunter S. Thompson, who had worked out of the J-Bar for so many years, died in 2005; his memorial service was held in the ballroom. That year the Gaylord family, publishers of The Oklahoman newspaper, bought the hotel for $33.7 million. They sought to further expand and renovate it with a fourth floor. Two years later, the Gaylords tired of the city's delays in approving their project and sold the hotel for $52.2 million. The buyers were two Chicago-based entities, Elysian Worldwide LLC and Lodging Capital Partners LLC (LCP), headed by David Pisor, owner of the Elysian, Chicago. They hired RockResorts, a subsidiary of Vail Resorts, owner of the Vail Ski Resort, Aspen's principal competitor in that area, to manage the Jerome. To finance the purchase they took out a mortgage with Morgan Stanley. The note later became the property of Lehman Brothers. When that firm went bankrupt in 2008 as a result of that year's financial crisis, a new entity, Jerome Property LLC, emerged as the holder of the debt. Jerome Property soon filed for foreclosure against the two owners, citing nonpayment of the $36 million balance remaining. LCP and Elysian at first contested the filing, saying that they had not defaulted, but later a sale was approved. LCP-Elysian conveyed the trust deed, with which it had originally collateralized the loan, to Jerome Ventures, a wholly owned subsidiary of its creditor, in exchange for the forgiveness of the remaining debt in 2009. The new owner applied to the city for an exemption from the real estate transfer tax it charges, on the grounds that it had acquired the property through foreclosure proceedings. It was granted, because the city normally does not charge lenders in those situations since they usually resell the property. Later, however, the city learned that Jerome Properties in fact intended to retain and benefit from ownership. In 2010, it told Jerome Property that the sale might indeed be taxable. Jerome Property then took the unusual step of foreclosing on its own subsidiary. It also filed in state court for a declaratory judgement that that transfer wasn't subject to the tax, either. The city responded that the foreclosure had been a fraudulent conveyance in order to avoid a tax bill estimated at around a half million dollars. In 2011 the judge ruled in favor of Jerome Property, saying the city had interpreted its own statute too narrowly. The city is considering whether to appeal. Later that year, Jerome brought in Auberge Resorts to replace Rock as the hotel manager. In January 2012 the entire hotel was rented out for a weekend for a bat mitzvah. Later that year the hotel closed down for several months prior to ski season to renovate the interiors of all rooms as well as the J-Bar. Reviews Travel writers and guides have heaped praise on the Jerome. \\"[It is] one of the best places to stay in Aspen—for those who can afford it\\", says Frommer's. Fodor's gives it a Fodor's Choice, calling it \\"[o]ne of the state's truly grand hotels.\\" \\"Fancy digs aren't my priority when I travel,\\" wrote Phil Marty of the Chicago Tribune, \\"but then you walk into something like Room 302 and think, 'Well, maybe I should spend more time in my room.'\\" He praised the staff's helpfulness in finding another place to valet-park his car with two bicycles on top, and the two half-liter water bottles and Toblerone candy bars on the desk when he came in. He had a few minor complaints: at the time (2007) the hotel did not have free Wi-Fi, the room's light switch could not function as a dimmer, and the hotel would stock the mini-bar only on a guest's request.

In 1922, the South African Railways placed six narrow-gauge steam locomotives with a 2-8-2 Mikado type wheel arrangement in service on the Otavi Railway in South West Africa. When a system of grouping narrow-gauge locomotives into classes was eventually introduced somewhere between 1928 and 1930, they were designated Class NG5.Espitalier, T.J.; Day, W.A.J. (1947). The Locomotive in South Africa – A Brief History of Railway Development. Chapter VII – South African Railways (Continued). South African Railways and Harbours Magazine, December 1947. pp. 1033-1034. Manufacturer Six narrow-gauge steam locomotives with a 2-8-2 Mikado type wheel arrangement were built for the South African Railways (SAR) by Henschel and Son in Germany in 1921. They were built to the same design as the three Class Hd locomotives which had been built in 1912 for the German administration in German South West Africa (GSWA) for leasing to the Otavi Mining and Railway Company. The locomotives, numbered in the range from NG71 to NG76, were delivered in 1922.Henschel-Lieferliste (Henschel & Son works list), compiled by Dietmar Stresow Characteristics Like their predecessor Class Hd, they were superheated, with Walschaerts valve gear and outside plate frames. The new locomotives differed from the Class Hd in having different boilers, which were of the same dimensions but with a different tube arrangement and, as a consequence, a slightly reduced total heating surface.South African Railways and Harbours Narrow Gauge Locomotive Diagram Book, 2'0\\" Gauge, S.A.R. Mechanical Dept. Drawing Office, Pretoria, 28 November 1932South African Railways and Harbours Locomotive Diagram Book, 2'0\\" & 3'6\\" Gauge Steam Locomotives, 15 August 1941, as amended In keeping with SAR practice at the time, they had vacuum train brakes instead of the air brakes which the Class Hd was equipped with. They had slide valves which was unusual on a superheated locomotive, instead of piston valves like the Class Hd. As built, the sand boxes were mounted on top of the boiler between the chimney and the steam dome. Their rigidly mounted leading and trailing carrying wheels were also arranged as radial axles to allow for sideways motion of the wheels in relation to the locomotive frame, since the locomotive did not have separate bogie trucks. As on the Class Hd, this resulted in a rigid wheelbase of , even though the leading carrying wheels were arranged to the rear instead of ahead of the cylinders. Classification In service, these six locomotives and the three Class Hd locomotives were operated in a common pool. The system of grouping narrow-gauge locomotives into classes was only adopted by the SAR at some date between 1928 and 1930. At that point, these six locomotives and the three Class Hd locomotives were all designated Class NG5. Service The 1922-vintage Class NG5 was placed in service on the narrow- gauge line from Swakopmund on the Atlantic coast to Tsumeb and Grootfontein in South West Africa (SWA). They spent their whole service life in SWA, except for a brief period when one of them was sent to the Avontuur Railway in the Eastern Cape for trials. However, since it jammed on the tighter curves in the Langkloof despite having one set of flangeless coupled wheels, it was soon returned to SWA. The Class NG5 were all withdrawn from service when the narrow-gauge system in SWA was regauged to Cape gauge in 1960. Since they were unsuitable for use in the Langkloof, all six 1922-vintage Class NG5 locomotives were sold as scrap in 1962. Preservation Two of the 1912-vintage ex Class Hd locomotives were preserved and plinthed at Otjiwarongo and Usakos respectively.

His designs consist of reclaimed, sustainable and recycled materials, and are built using eco- friendly construction techniques. He is also a descendant of Italy’s Cinzano liquor family.  Early life  Marone Cinzano was born to Alberto Paolo Marone Cinzano and Cristina Marone Cinzano (born Countess Camerana). When he was nine years old, he attended boarding school at Aiglon College and graduated from Mount Kelly School, a military academy in the UK. He then studied business administration at Babson College, Massachusetts (his father Alberto is also a Babson alumnus class of '53). After graduating Babson in 1985, he stayed in the United States where he worked in advertising, banking, and real estate before co-founding the environmentally friendly fashion company Project Alabama (now known as Alabama Chanin) with Natalie \\"Alabama\\" Chanin in the year 2000.Entrepreneur.com ProfileNew York Times Fashion ArticleFashion Week Designer Profile He began designing bespoke furniture in 2007. Career In 2007, Marone Cinzano established his own company: the Enrico Marone Cinzano Collection. The company designs ethical and sustainable home products and homes. He creates his pieces from recycled materials with the intention of sparking conversations around sustainability. His pieces range from coffee tables, lamps, sofas, and cabinets and can sell from anywhere between $9,500 to $75,000.NY Magazine - Bacchus House article His work has been exhibited at the Pearl Lam in China and the Spazio Rossana Orlandi in Milan. Marone Cinzano launched his first collection of sustainable design in 2012. The collection emphasised the use of natural or environmentally-friendly materials such as reclaimed wood, recycled steel, and homemade glue. It comprised an armoire, a bookcase, a couch, an armchair, a table, and a Lazy Susan. In 2015, Marone Cinzano launched his first solo exhibition titled China Clean at Hong Kong’s Pearl Lam Design Gallery on occasion of Art Basel Hong Kong. The exhibition celebrated crafts and craftsmen of Mainland China by featuring eight made in China sculptural pieces. The pieces were crafted from recycled elm wood using traditional Chinese joinery techniques, held together with eco-friendly glue and finished with beeswax and natural lacquer. In contrast to his more “conservative” first collection, China Clean included details like hand-carved skulls and tattoo style motifs. He also collaborated with Shanghai-based Stellar Works to a create a recycled leather chair and table for the collection. The table and chair were designed as flat-pack pieces so that they could be transported with the smallest possible carbon footprint. At the Milan Design Week 2016, Marone Cinzano unveiled Dondolo, a rocking chair made from salvaged Alfa Romeo car parts. The chair was sourced and made in Turin and inspired by his hometown’s industrial roots. Other 2016 works include Guiltless Bedspread and Clean Cover, which use recycled Astrakhan fur and cashmere woven from recycled yarn. In 2016, Marone Cinzano applied the same ethos to architecture and interior design. He turned his London micro-apartment into what he calls a “healthful living space”. The lighting scheme is designed to replicate natural light during waking hours and create absolute darkness during sleeping hours. His has a mattress made from organic materials and coated the walls of his apartment with colloidal silver paint, an antibacterial product which he believes protects him from the electromagnetic fields produced by WiFi. In 2017, Marone Cinzano was invited as a speaker to a TED conference in Kings College, London to discuss health and well-being in the living space.  Family history  Marone Cinzano’s maternal great grandfather, Giovanni Agnelli was the founder of FIAT Automobiles, while his great-grandfather founded the Cinzano vermouth distillery.
