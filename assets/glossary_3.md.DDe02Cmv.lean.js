It will be the fourth and most southern dam on the Syrian Euphrates, after the Tishrin Dam, the Tabqa Dam and the Baath Dam. The proposed location for the dam is the narrow gap in the Euphrates valley northwest of Deir ez-Zor that is created by basalt outcrops on the left and right river banks. It is expected that dry areas will be brought under cultivation with irrigation water provided by the dam. In preparation of this project, the director of the Syrian Directorate-General of Antiquities and Museums (DGAM) appealed in 2009 to international teams of archaeologists to participate in the rescue excavations of the archaeological sites that would be threatened by the construction of the dam and the flooding of its reservoir. These excavations were expected to be carried out between 2010 and 2012. The sites that are threatened are located in the area that is projected to be flooded by the reservoir and in the area where construction works for the dam will take place. Important sites that are threatened include the Roman‚ÄìByzantine sites of Halabiye and Zalabiye that were first fortified by the Palmyrene queen Zenobia in the 3rd century CE. The lower town of Halabiye will be partially flooded by the reservoir and the Syrian government is cooperating with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and UNESCO to limit the impact of the dam on this site as well as on Zalabiye. Other threatened sites include Bronze Age Tell Ma‚Äôdan and Tell Humeyda with Ubaid, Uruk and Byzantine material. Given the current instability in the region, it can be assumed that the project has been postponed.

The author postulates the discovery, in the near future, of the \\"Gismo\\", a device that can duplicate anything‚Äîeven another Gismo. Since all material objects have become essentially free, the only commodity of value is human labor, and the author suggests that a slave economy would be the inevitable result. The novel first appeared in 1959 as The People Maker (Zenith Books), based on a story in the November 1957 issue of Fantasy and Science Fiction. Knight subsequently revised the text, which was published by Berkley in 1961 as A for Anything. It is generally considered to be Knight's finest novel. Knight has said of this novel: \\"I chose the matter duplicator, because I thought other authors had handled it badly.\\" Synopsis An anonymous inventor sends copies of the \\"Gismo\\" through the mail to hundreds of people. Civil society immediately collapses; as one news commentator says: \\"The big question today is: Have you got a Gismo? And believe me, nothing else matters.\\" The story jumps to the year 2149: the society we know has been replaced by a society of wealthy minority supported by slavery, and access to Gismos is jealously guarded by Gismo-produced slave guards. The story is told through the eyes of Dick Jones, the son of the leader of Buckhill, a compound in the Poconos. Jones is coming of age and is about to be sent to Eagles, another, larger compound in the Rocky Mountains, for military training. Jones is initially presented as an unsympathetic character: spoiled, impulsive, hot-headed. In his final day at Buckhill, he insults a cousin who then challenges Dick to a duel; Dick kills him, and has to be ushered away in secret the following morning for fear of retribution. Jones arrives at Eagles, a fabulous city built into a mountain. Like Buckhill, Eagles is run as a slave society; but Jones is startled to realize that the Gismo is used to duplicate slaves, and that the most trusted slaves have been copied hundreds of times. Status among citizens is determined by social connections, and, for males, by skill at hand-to-hand combat. The author shows us the dark side of Eagles; for instance, the Boss takes pleasure in having slaves dropped down a shaft inside a tall tower and watching them plunge to their death via closed-circuit television. This may be done because it is suggested that all but the very best of slaves are \\"recycled\\" at about 30 years of age but with a 300 slaves for every freeman ratio at Eagles, some slaves live much longer. There are hints from Jones's father in Buckhill that the slaves are contemplating revolt. In Eagles, Jones is introduced to a secret society that debates the merits of the slave culture and that plans a revolution, with the collaboration of a disaffected member of the ruling family. Jones is enthralled by the arguments he hears. At these meetings, the reader discovers that once the Gismo was sent out and the initial battles were fought, almost no scientific advances were made because the Gismo could do everything. It is hinted that some saw the time of chaos as a chance to advance space exploration but some people from the meetings say that it was all theory and nothing was ever built. But before the revolution can be put into action, the slaves revolt, killing most of the free citizens in Eagles and Buckhill, including Jones's family. Jones is forced to choose between his allegiance to kin and his yearning for a better society. In the end, Jones chooses to turn against the slaves so that he can become \\"The Man\\" at Buckhill replacing his murdered Father and getting society back to where it was when he left for Eagles.

These religious plays were developed from biblical texts; at the height of their popularity, they were allowed to stay within the churches, and special stages were erected for them.Nagler, A. M. A Source Book in Theatrical History. New York: Dover Publications, 1959. Print. Pageant comes from the archaic word for the wagon stage, \\"pagyn.‚Äù It is a word used to describe the movable stage on which a scene of the processional religious play was performed.Hartnoll, Phyllis. The Oxford Companion to the Theatre. Oxford [Oxfordshire: Oxford UP, 1983. Print. The origin of the religious play began in medieval churches. The dramas began as a simple way to impart the message of the Bible to the people. They then grew and developed their own conventions. They brought to the common person a pageantry and entertainment so necessary to relieve the people from the monotony of the everyday task.Cleaver, James. Theatre through the Ages. New York: Hart Pub., 1967. Print. During these monotonous times, in places like St. Gall, Switzerland in the 10th Century, the church put on shows at their Easter masses. Pantomimes would take place in the church depicting Christ‚Äôs Resurrection to the attendants of the mass.Fuller, Edmund. A Pageant of the Theatre. New York: Crowell, 1965. Print. A few centuries later in Florence, Filippo Brunelleschi (1377‚Äì1446) began to create theatrical depictions of religious texts and see them as a potential work of art. It wasn‚Äôt until 1493 however, that the Sacra Rappresentazione, an earlier form of the Mystery Play, was presented on a scaffold in the church in which ‚Äúhundreds of lights encircled the ‚ÄòThrone of God.‚Äù This new form of spectacle based theatrical representation of both Old and New Testament texts spread throughout Europe and encompassed North and Central Europe, France, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, and England. As the plays became more than mere pantomimes of biblical stories, they took on bigger texts and were performed at Christmas, Corpus Christi, and numerous other religious saints days or feasts. As the drama of the production became more ambitious, the playing spaces also grew. The plays originally were performed on the altar of the church but grew to encompass the entirety of the front of the church. Eventually the plays grew beyond the capacity of the interior of the church and moved its front steps while also making use of the length and width of the streets. The performances sometimes even enveloped the public square just beyond the church steps. Since there was little space in these areas to provide a backdrop for scenery, the people created ‚Äúmansions‚Äù, or wooden stages, on which to create the play. Eventually these stages would evolve into movable wagons as the troupes playing on them began to take their shows throughout the towns and play to different audiences. Description Very little is known of the specifics of the construction of the pageant wagon. Currently there are no clear descriptions of a pageant wagon to survive from the time when they were used avidly. However, we do have a few speculations on the construction of English wagons, but they are from a much later time than when pageant wagons would have been used. One such description comes from a late sixteenth- / early seventeenth-century manuscript entitled A Breviarye or Some Few Recollections of the City of Chester by David Rogers. It states that the pageant wagons were wooden structures with two rooms. They contained both a higher room where the play was performed and a lower room where the players changed clothing. The whole structure was mounted on six wheels. The entire structure would be 15 feet tall with the playing space being 9 feet above the street.Crabtree, Susan, and Peter Beudert. Scenic Art for the Theatre: History, Tools, and Techniques. Boston: Focal, 1998. Print. This follows along with a description from the memory of an Archdeacon Robert Rogers who, in 1595, is quoted as saying \\"..pagiants weare a high scafolde with two rowmes, a higher and a lower, upon four wheeles. In the lower they apparelled them selves, and in the higher rowme they played, beinge all open on the tope, that all behoulders mighte heare and see them.\\" This description comes at a time when pageant wagons were seldom used anymore and is subject to reinterpretation by the author. In opposition to these descriptions, Glynne Wickham argues in The Early English Stages, that the wagon was only a one level structure taken up entirely by off stage space used for a dressing room. This would provide the backdrop for the performance as well. The acting would then take place on a scaffold alongside the cart or on the street. This description would testify towards how cumbersome it would‚Äôve been for a multi-level cart to travel throughout the towns on such unwieldy streets. A cart closer to the ground would be significantly easier to manage yet might not have offered such a vantage point as a two story structure. A Norwich inventory from 1565 describes one such wagon as a house of wainscot painted and built on a cart with four wheels. A square top set over the house. It also should be of note that, in the majority of Europe, fixed stages were more common than wagons, and the sites of the fixed stages varied from place to place. In Rome the ancient amphitheatres were used, and in places like Mons, France and Frankfurt-am-Main in Germany, town squares were the primary auditorium.Brockett, Oscar G., and Franklin J. Hildy. History of the Theatre. Boston, MA: Pearson, 2007. Print. Pageant wagons in practice When a processional cycle play came to town, the whole city was used as a massive auditorium as the wagons were moved through the main streets of the city. The wagons would stop at key locations, where the scene of each wagon would then begin. For instance, the starting wagon would take up a position before the mayor‚Äôs house and perform the first scene. When the scene ended, the wagon would move on to the next appointed spot and repeat the performance. Meanwhile, all along the predetermined route other wagons with their many varied scenes would follow in procession, each playing over and over its part in the slowly unfolding cycle. It was a chain theatre. It is said that the bigger wagons can be likened the elaborate floats in the New Orleans Mardi Gras Parade. When in the country, the wagons were lined up in stationary ranks, and the audience moved from one to another to follow the cycle. The performers did not limit themselves to the small playing space of the wagon settings, but spread out freely onto the surrounding ground. Each wagon contained a setting and carried the actors to different scenes. As the actors moved, the members of the audience moved with them. In some cases simultaneous action occurred on a number of levels of wagon platforms. This offered the spectators a spectacle quite like that of a modern-day three-ring circus. If a town had a large enough field nearby the wagons were sometimes set all in one spot as to minimize movement. No mode of theatre in the history of drama has ever occupied more territory. The Archdeacon Roberts is also quoted in the movement of the carts throughout the towns; \\"They begane first at the abay gates, and when the firste paginate was played it was wheeled to the highe crosse before the mayor, and so to every streete; and soe every streete had a pagiant playinge before them at one time, till all the pagiantes for the daye appointed weare played: and when one pagiant was neere ended, worde was broughte from streete to streete, and soe they mighte come in place thereof excedinge orderlye, and all the streetes have theire pagiantes afore them all at one time playeinge together; to se which playes was greate resorte, and also scafoldes and stages made in the streetes in those places where they determined to playe thire pagiantes.\\" As the productions regarding these plays grew, towns all over Europe began to adapt and create productions of their own. The Europeans thoroughly enjoyed the elaborate spectacle, and each year they outdid themselves in the creation of such productions. It reached such a point that entire towns were in on the creation of these dramas, and specific guilds were created to devote themselves to the undertaking of the pageant construction. If performed today, this spectacle would tax the resources of any large country town. It would deplete most of the stock of a local lumber yard, hardware store and dry goods outlet. It would also require all the available blacksmiths and carpenters to devote an entire month to the creation of the carts. Simonson, Lee. The Stage Is Set. New York: Harcourt, Brace and, 1932.

Fay, \\"Crash in Stocks Turns Investors to Apartments.\\" The Seattle Daily Times, December 1, 1929, Sunday Morning Edition: 26. History =The Area= In the early 20th century, Capitol Hill was one of the wealthier areas of Seattle. It has since been transformed into a hip, urban area for young professionals; it is known as the gay village in Seattle. The Blackstone Apartments are one of the few pre-World War II complexes remaining in Capitol Hill; post-WWII apartments differed greatly in this area. These newer complexes looked consistent, but with their large windows and courtyards, privacy was lost; they no longer reflected the luxurious apartments which Capitol Hill had once been known for.Victor Steinbrueck. Seattle Cityscape. (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1962), 73. The Blackstone, however, which also had large windows, had been built with a raised first floor to prevent passersby from peering into the private lives lived inside the units. =1920s Seattle Architecture= The 1920s in Seattle saw a change in the style of popular architecture. Inspired by the newness of the country, Seattle architects had expressed freedom in their architectural creations.Victor Steinbrueck. A Guide to Seattle Architecture: 1850-1953. (New York: Reinhold Publishing Corporation, 1953), 18. By this time people's interest in the Arts and Crafts Movement, seen in the popular residential bungalow designs in the early 20th century, was beginning to decline.Jeffrey Karl Ochsner (editor) Shaping Seattle Architecture: A Historical Guide to the Architects. (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1994), xxix. Design now turned to an eclectic-historic combination, particularly of the Classical Revival and English Revival styles.Jeffrey Karl Ochsner (editor) Shaping Seattle Architecture: A Historical Guide to the Architects. (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1994), xxix. The Blackstone particularly reflects this turn, combining Classical design elements with modern technology. =The Vernacular= The early 20th century became a difficult time for architectural identification; no longer could a building be designated as vernacular architecture (folk culture) or as elite architecture (designed by an architect), but rather something in the middle.Alexa Berlow and Gail Dubrow. \\"Vernacular and Popular Architecture in Seattle\\" in Seattle Architecture: A Historical Guide to the Architects. (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1994), 282. To contribute to the confusion of identification, most commercial, industrial, and residential buildings in Seattle at this time were designed not by architects but by builders.Alexa Berlow and Gail Dubrow. \\"Vernacular and Popular Architecture in Seattle\\" in Seattle Architecture: A Historical Guide to the Architects. (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1994), 284. Because of this, these buildings are often considered to be the best representations of a new kind of architecture in Seattle: popular - vernacular - high-style.Alexa Berlow and Gail Dubrow. \\"Vernacular and Popular Architecture in Seattle\\" in Seattle Architecture: A Historical Guide to the Architects. (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1994), 284. The Blackstone Apartments, a residential building designed by a builder and built for the middle to upper class, is a great example of this popular ‚Äì vernacular ‚Äì high-style architecture of the pre-WWII era in Seattle. =Stock Market Crash= Immediately after the Wall Street Crash of 1929, some people believed that real estate would be a safer investment than stocks, and many people began to purchase apartment complexes; real estate saw a peak that year in prices, before they began falling as the Great Depression took hold in the country.Tom Nicholas and Anna Scherbina. \\"Real Estate Prices During the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression.\\" (January 29, 2010), 2. These investments were particularly popular the weeks preceding the crash in Seattle; only a few weeks after the crash, the Blackstone Apartments became \\"the largest deal of the kind,\\" selling for $140,000 to John J. Freeley for Mrs. Ada Parfitt.Thomas G. Fay. \\"Crash in Stocks Turns Investors to Apartments.\\" The Seattle Daily Times, December 1, 1929, Sunday Morning Edition: 26. The next closest apartment sale in the Seattle area was for the Rosemont Apartments for $56,000.Thomas G. Fay. \\"Crash in Stocks Turns Investors to Apartments.\\" The Seattle Daily Times, December 1, 1929, Sunday Morning Edition: 26. Architect/Owner Not much is known about the complex's designer and original owner, J.S. Long. He was a designer for the Long Building Company, particularly of their Arts and Crafts style bungalows, some of which were featured in The Craftsman magazine.\\"A Story of Home-Making.\\" The Craftsman, May 1916 The Sears Catalog Home \\"The Ashmore,\\" available between 1916 and 1922, is believed to have been based on one of J.S. Long and the Long Building Company's Seattle bungalow designs.\\"The \\"Ashmore\\", 424 Oliver Avenue South, Minneapolis, Minnesota\\" J. S. Long is Stanley Long, as Stanley's obituary on the HistoryLink article regarding him reads \\"...he leaves wife Blanche\\". The 1923 Seattle directory shows that J. S. was married to Blanche. There is no listing for a Stanley, and only J. S. is listed as owner in directories.

Other summer signings included Rub√©n Palazuelos from Gimn√°stica de Torrelavega and Michael Stewart, who returned to the club after two seasons with rivals Hibernian. Scottish international goalkeeper Craig Gordon moved to Sunderland for ¬£9 million in early August. This fee meant that Gordon was the most expensive Hearts and Scottish player ever, and the most expensive goalkeeper in British football history. Managers Just prior to the season's commencement Anatoly Korobochka and Stephen Frail were confirmed as the club's permanent coaching team. After several other discouraging results, the Scottish media began to scrutinise why the team was not matching supporters expectations, with one particular area of interest being the coaching structure. As neither Korobochka or Bulgarian assistant coach Angel Chervenkov spoke fluent English, a translator was required to aid management and team communication, a situation Frail admitted was \\"frustrating\\" and \\"not ideal\\" after a 1‚Äì1 draw with Gretna. Stephen Frail was appointed manager on 31 December following a difficult start to the season, although it was not made clear at the time that Frail would be manager until the end of the season. On 22 May 2008 reports came out that caretaker manager Stephen Frail was on his way out of Tynecastle as he was not part of the new managerial structure at Hearts. Season Hearts began the season in a disappointing manner being defeated 1 -0 in the Edinburgh Derby with Hibernian. On 31 December 2007, Romanov announced that, following five successive defeats which saw the club fall to 10th (third bottom) place in the league, the club would be looking to appoint a 'British-style' manager who would have complete control over team affairs. Since then, Stephen Frail has been the caretaker manager, although it was not made clear at the time that Frail would be manager until the end of the season. Hearts were defeated 1‚Äì0 in the 4th round replay of the Scottish Cup by Motherwell after a 2‚Äì2 draw on 21 January 2008. Rangers defeated them 2‚Äì0 in the semi-final of the CIS Cup on 30 January at Hampden Park. Hearts then sold their top scorer, Andrius Veliƒçka, to Norwegian side Viking Stavanger on 26 February 2008. A 0‚Äì0 draw with Kilmarnock on 5 April 2008 meant that Hearts failed to make the \\"Top Six\\" of the SPL, for the first time since the split league format was introduced in 2001.

The vessel was found to be carrying approximately 50 tons of weapons, including C-704 anti-ship missiles, rocket launchers, radar systems, mortar shells and rifle ammunition. Background Israel maintains a naval blockade of the Gaza Strip, to prevent the smuggling of arms into the hands of militant organizations based there. In 2003, Israeli commandos intercepted the Karine A in the Red Sea, and seized 50 tons of missiles, mortars, rifles and ammunition which it said were destined for Gaza. In 2009, the Israeli navy intercepted the Iranian vessel Francop off the coast of Cyprus, carrying hundreds of tons of weapons. Iran is Hamas's main arms provider, smuggling weapons overland through Sudan and Sinai in addition to using the sea route.[ ] Operation Israeli commanders were acting on intelligence reports indicating that 39 of the 100 containers on deck were loaded with Iranian weapons while at port in Syria, and were to be transferred to Hamas. The Victoria was seized about 200 nautical miles from the Israeli coast, while on its way from Turkey to El- Arish port in Egypt (other sources give the destination as Alexandria, Egypt). According to the IDF, the ship picked up the cargo in the Port of Latakia in Syria and sailed to Mersin, Turkey. The ship was intercepted by Israeli Navy missile ships, which radioed the captain and questioned him about his point of origin and planned destination, then informed him that his ship was suspected of carrying illegal cargo, and requested permission to board for an inspection. The captain agreed, and ordered the vessel stopped. Several minutes later, speedboats carrying commandos from Israel's elite naval unit, Shayetet 13, pulled alongside the ship. A ladder was dropped for them to climb aboard. The commandos boarded with their weapons at the ready out of concern that there could be Iranian or Hamas operatives on board. The commandos ordered the crew to assemble on the bridge, and then began inspecting the cargo. The IDF said the ship's crew was unaware it was carrying concealed weapons. The ship was redirected to the Port of Ashdod for further inspection. After the contraband was unloaded, Israel announced it would release the Victoria and allow it to continue its journey to the Egyptian port of Alexandria. According to the IDF's Deputy Navy Commander Rear Admiral Rani Ben-Yehuda, the weapons may have been transported from Iran to Syria several weeks earlier, when two Iranian warships sailed through the Suez Canal. The shipment C-704 found aboard the Victoria Missile identification document in Persian which bears the Iranian governmental emblem found on board the Victoria Concealed in three containers hidden beneath cotton bags and lentils produced in Syria were the following weapon systems: * 6 C-704 anti-ship missiles * 230 mortar shells, caliber 120 mm * 2,270 mortar shells, caliber 60 mm * 2 radar systems manufactured in England * 2 rocket launchers * 2 hydraulic mounting cranes for the radar system * 66,960 7.62√ó39mm rounds (Commonly used in the AKM). According to the IDF, the weapons were accompanied by user manuals in Persian. The packing slip for the 60mm mortar also included a range table for use with a model AZ111-A2 impact fuse, made exclusively by Iran. In an attempt to mislead would-be inspectors, \\"Made in Britain\\" labels were attached to all of the crates.[ ] The C-704 missile has a range of 35 kilometers, and a 130 kilogram explosive warhead capable of sinking a 1,000-ton ship. According to The Jerusalem Post, had the six missiles the ship was carrying arrived in the Gaza Strip, they \\"would have forced the navy to change the way it operates. It now operates just a few kilometers from shore; this would no longer be possible\\". Responses * : The Israeli Foreign Ministry instructed its ambassador to the UN to file a complaint to the UN Security Council's sanctions committee over Iran's efforts to smuggle arms to the Gaza Strip, as a violation of UNSC resolution 1747, which forbids Iran to export arms. * : Iran's Chief of Staff Gen. Ataollah Salehi denied the allegations that Iran was behind the shipment and was quoted as saying \\"Israel is a regime based on a lie, and it manufactures lies and fabrications\\" * : Spokesman for the U.S. State Department Mark C. Toner released a press statement saying: \\"In light of the recent seizure of advanced arms and related material by Israel and Egypt bound for terrorist groups, the United States reiterates its strong condemnation of illicit smuggling activities. We underscore that all countries have obligations under relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions to prevent such trafficking in arms and ammunition. Iran, in particular, is prohibited by United Nations Security Council resolution 1747 from exporting any arms and related materials. Any activity to the contrary is another example of Iran‚Äôs destabilizing activities in the region. We call upon all regional countries to enforce these obligations. We will continue to work closely with our partners to prevent the shipment of arms to terrorist groups.\\" Legality United Nations Security Council Resolution 1929 authorizes states to seize items, including arms, that Iran is forbidden from exporting.

It was located on the northern shores of Van Mijenfjorden, near the sea entrance. It was part of an effort by British investors and entrepreneurs to extract resources from Spitsbergen, at that time open to various nations' claims for development. Located above the Arctic Circle, the camp was set up in the early 20th century by Ernest Mansfield, a prospector staking claims on behalf of a British investment company set up to mine for resources on the island. A major backer of the Spitzbergen Mining and Exploration Syndicate (SMES) was Sholto Douglas, 19th Earl of Morton, and the camp was named for him. The company in 1910 was renamed as Northern Exploration Company Ltd (NEC). The coal mine operated from 1906 into the mid-1920s. About half of the huts owned by NEC remain; the major building, now called Camp Morton, has been restored by the Norwegian government.\\"Camp Morton\\", The Douglas Archives History In the early 20th century, Spitsbergen, in the archipelago now known as Svalbard, became a site for resource extraction and development north of the coast of Norway, then under Danish rule. Several nations had staked opposing claims there in the late 19th century, including the Dutch, Danish and British. Investors set up companies to develop the resources there, always with the hopes of a rich strike of gold, as had occurred with the Klondike Gold Rush in Yukon, Canada in the late 1890s. One of the British companies was Spitzbergen Coal and Mineral Ltd of London, one of whose major investors was Sholto Douglas, 19th Earl of Morton. It evolved into the Spitzbergen Mining and Exploration Syndicate (SMES) in 1905. The company in 1910 was renamed as Northern Exploration Company Ltd (NEC). Ernest Mansfield, a British prospector and entrepreneur who was a \\"pioneer of the 'Klondike period' in Svalbard,\\" was active on behalf of the British NEC in Spitsbergen, laying claim to land especially on the west coast of the island.Susan Barr, David Newman, and Greg Nesteroff, Ernest Mansfield (- Gold or I'm a Dutchman), Trondheim, Norway: Akademika Publishing, 2012 (The claims are in the names of major investors.) He built camps to try to mark and protect the land claims, hiring trappers to look after them during the winter months. In 1901 Ivar Stenehjem, a merchant, got funding for a couple of expeditions to Spitsbergen with the help of ship- owner Christian Michelsen from Bergen. In 1905 Michelsen became Norway‚Äôs first prime minister. Stenehjem built a large timber building at Camp Morton called Michelsenhuset in his honor. The NEC coal mine at Camp Morton opened in 1906 and operated until 1920. Numerous camp buildings were constructed with funding from the Northern Exploration Company Ltd. Some were named after investors and their family members, such as Camp Mansfield and Camp Zoe (after Mansfield‚Äôs daughter). Camp Morton was named after Sholto Douglas, the Earl of Morton. The coal mining was never as profitable as investors had hoped, and operations had ended by the mid-1920s. Mining of other resources was also difficult. In 1932 the investors sold the Northern Exploration Company to the Norwegian government; its total property included 58 huts. Twenty-seven have survived, and the largest is Michelsenhuset, now known as Camp Morton. It has been restored by the government and is the largest structure at the site. A nearby hut, known as Clara Ville, is available for use by the Longyearbyen snowmobile club.David Newman, \\"Camp Morton\\" (additional content, 23 February 2013), The Douglas Archives, website, accessed 2 September 2013 The site also has some remains of mining equipment and the tracks of the mine railway.

Over the past nine years, MicroDreams has provided substantial support to the SPBD microfinance network in all four of its branches in (Samoa, Tonga, Fiji, and the Solomon Islands) and has helped to scale up other young emerging partner microfinance institutions (MFIs) in Bolivia,http://www.emprender.org.bo/en/our_numbers/our_funders Ecuador, and Peru. MicroDreams uses loans, loan guarantees, and technical assistance to help provide meaningful economic opportunity to the poorest members of society. MicroDreams‚Äô primary goal is to provide the global poor, in particular women, with economic opportunity to empower them to work their way out of poverty. The non-profit provides financing to start-up and Tier 3 microfinance institutions that otherwise would not be able to receive funding. The majority of large microfinance investment vehicles and asset management firms avoid providing funding to these types of microfinance institutions because they are considered too small and too risky to be a safe investment. History The MicroDreams Foundation, originally branded South Pacific Business Development-USA, was founded in 2002 by Gregory F. Casagrande as a U.S. 501(c)(3) non-profit organization to help fund the growth of South Pacific Business Development Foundation (Samoa), a Grameen-style microfinance institution tweaked to fit local needs that, as a start-up, found external investment hard to come by.http://www.mulagofoundation.org/portfolio/microdreams SPBD (Samoa) gradually became financially sustainable with the help of several commercial entities to pay back start-up funding, and today is the largest microfinance provider in the country. MicroDreams has since expanded its horizons and continues to serve as a microfinance accelerator for start-up microfinance institutions including the three additional branches of SPBD in other South Pacific countries. Microenterprise Development Since its founding, MicroDreams has delivered approximately US$2,000,000 of financing to young, well-managed MEDOs (MicroEnterprise Development Organizations) in Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru, Tonga, Fiji, and the Solomon Islands. MicroDreams helped South Pacific Business Development expand into Tonga in 2009, Fiji in 2010,http://www.fijisun.com.fj/2010/10/06/microfinance-set-for-launch/ and the Solomon Islands in 2013. MicroDreams monitors its MFI partners and ensures that they provide loans for underprivileged people to start their own businesses as well as proper training and mentoring to guide their female microentrepreneurs towards business success. The partners also provide life insurance and savings accounts. The SPBD network encourages its members to use the proceeds gained from their microenterprises to make basic housing improvements and better provide education for their children. The MFI partners help to ensure the children of all members receive a proper education by providing financing to pay for school fees, school uniforms, and textbooks. Tsunami On September 29, 2009, Samoa was hit by a tsunami triggered by a submarine earthquake, the largest earthquake of the year. Aid came quickly to the hundreds of families devastated by the tsunami from the nearby Samoan Red Cross and the New Zealand police. From the U.S., MicroDreams provided direct aid and operational leadership to hundreds of families devastated by the tsunami. MicroDreams worked in cooperation with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and Mercy Corps, which channeled the funds it raised for the relief efforts in Samoa through the existing network of MicroDreams and SPBD. The relief and recovery efforts of MicroDreams and its partner microfinance institution were covered by the Samoa Observer. http://www.mercycorps.org/gregcasagrande/blog/16575 http://www.samoaobserver.ws/index.php?view=article&id;=15192%3Apay-for- recovery&option;=com_content&Itemid;=53 Funding Partners MicroDreams has received funding from several charitable foundations practicing high impact philanthropy. Both the Mulago Foundation and Sam Morgan's Jasmine Social Investments have provided funding to MicroDreams. The funds are re-directed to MicroDreams' partner microfinance institutions in the field. In addition to providing loans and loan guarantees to partners in the South Pacific, MicroDreams also works closely with CreSud Spa and Oikocredit to do the same for its field partners in Latin America.

Berry told ESPN.com, \\"As advocates, our job is to fight for and protect player rights, and when necessary, try and help create solutions -- not pointing fingers of blame and hoping things get better. And I wholeheartedly believe there are viable solutions to the core labor issues facing the game that can be remedied to the benefit of players, clubs and fans.\\" CAA advised four of the top 20 picks in the 2019 draft and two of the top five picks in the 2017 draft. In 2017, Berry advised Vanderbilt pitcher Kyle Wright, who received a $7 million signing bonus from the Atlanta Braves ‚Äî $1,292,700 above the slot value, a first-round record in the current draft system.https://www.ajc.com/sports/baseball/braves-agree-record-signing- bonus-for-draft-pick-kyle-wright/tGPd1IZiKTeFoWfhoNiFWI/ CAA also advised Hunter Greene, who signed with the Cincinnati Reds for $7,230,000, setting a record in the current system. In the 2018 draft, Berry advisee Jordyn Adams, who had a football scholarship to North Carolina, went 17th overall to the Los Angeles Angels. That was $627,100 above slot, most of any high school first- rounder in that draft.https://twitter.com/jimcallismlb/status/1009283564666486784?lang=en Former major-league general manager Jim Bowden, writing for ESPN.com, described Berry as \\"an attorney who has a direct and no-nonsense negotiating style and vehemently fights for his clients. He is hard-nosed, at times stubborn and prefers to stay in the box in terms of negotiations.\\" In 2008, Berry negotiated the largest signing bonus in baseball draft history, Posey's $6.2 million deal with San Francisco. Berry has negotiated other precedent- setting draft deals: for Myers with the Kansas City Royals ($2 million, a third-round record), A.J. Cole with the Washington Nationals ($2 million, a fourth-round record) and Dillon Maples of the Chicago Cubs ($2.5 million, a record for anyone picked after the third round). Berry has been involved with multiple rule changes in baseball. Following Posey's season-ending injury in May 2011, Berry lobbied Major League Baseball and the players' union to limit home-plate collisions, telling ESPN.com, \\"You leave players way too vulnerable. ... I don't know if this ends up leading to a rule change, but it should. The guy [at the plate] is too exposed. ... I'm going to call Major League Baseball and put this on the radar. Because it's just wrong.\\" Eventually MLB added Rule 7.13 to protect catchers. In 2014, word leaked that shortstop prospect Trea Turner was the player to be named in a trade between the San Diego Padres and Nationals but could not actually be traded, by rule, for six more months. Berry told foxsports.com, \\"Given the circumstances and the undoubtedly negative impact on Trea Turner, for the teams involved and Major League Baseball to endorse and approve this trade is not only unethical, but also goes against the very spirit of the Minor League Uniform Player Contract that players sign when they first enter professional baseball.\\" In May 2015, MLB revised its rules and allowed players to be traded in the fall after they were drafted. In June 2015, Berry successfully appealed an eight- game suspension of client Will Smith (pitcher) of the Milwaukee Brewers for having a foreign substance on his arm, getting the suspension reduced. Smith credited Berry for the victory, saying, \\"My agent did his homework and cracked down on it. I felt comfortable leaving the meeting very well-represented.\\" Berry has also helped enable trades for his clients to preferred destinations. Shortly after he told ESPN.com in December 2009 that Roy Halladay would not approve any trade after he reported to spring training, the Toronto Blue Jays dealt Halladay to the Philadelphia Phillies, who signed Halladay to a $60 million extension. In 2019, Berry said client J.T. Realmuto would not sign a long-term deal with the Miami Marlins, and by February, the Marlins traded Realmuto to the Phillies. Personal Berry and his wife Sarah have three children, two sons and a daughter. Berry is a frequent speaker at colleges, law schools and other events. In 2016, Berry appeared on the Dick Vitale Telethon to benefit pediatric cancer research for the V Foundation.

Crest The design of the crest alludes primarily to the 73rd Artillery‚Äôs participation in the 1944 winter counter offensive against Germany and is symbolized by the caltrops (a heraldic military device used to impede and delay the movements of the enemy). The two smaller caltrops allude to St. Vith and Echternock, and the larger to Bastogne, the later is blue in reference to the Distinguished Unit Citation awarded the battalion for its role in the defense of Bastogne. The snow refers to the severe winter weather during the period the battalion made its stand against the German counter offensive and is symbolized by two arms breaking a spear. Had it not been for this delaying action the Germans would have taken Bastogne before the 101st Airborne Division arrived. * Background The coat of arms was originally approved for the 73rd Armored Field Artillery Battalion on 17 March 1943.

It is in the northwestern part of the Espindola canton about 25 km from Amaluza, the canton‚Äôs capital. 720x260px History The village of El Airo‚Äôs name originates from the time of the \\"Patrones\\" or moneyed landowners, who named their hacienda El Airo due to the strong winds that existed in the area as well as its high elevation. The highest parts of El Airo are near the presumed location of the Inca Trail through Southern Ecuador. This assumption along with the rudimentary stone tools and structure foundations that have been found in El Airo suggest that the first inhabitants of the area now known as El Airo were indigenous in origin. For a large part of the 20th century El Airo existed as a hacienda with the majority of the mixed race population working the patrones' land in exchange for a small subsistence plot of their own. In the 1960s Ecuador enacted agricultural land reform which led to the majority population of El Airo gaining land and freedom from the authority of the patr√≥n. It was at this time that the patrones left El Airo. In 1988 led by the revered Father Ernesto Celi Roman, the leaders and inhabitants of the area began the political and legal process of converting the area into a recognized parish. This was seen as essential for the development of the area and culminated with the founding of El Airo on August 2, 1992. As part of this process a secondary school named Colegio Dos de Agosto was inaugurated on the same day as the parish was established. Climate El Airo comprises four small neighborhoods or \\"barrios\\". La Guaca is the most populated and this is where the parish council is based. The other neighborhoods are El Tambo, El Laurel and El Batan. The parish of El Airo is bordered by the Ecuadorian province of Zamora Chinchipe on the east and by other parishes with the canton of Espindonla on the north, west and south. El Airo possesses a temperate climate with an average temperature of 21 ¬∞C. Within the parishes area the altitude is between 1600 and 3200 meters above sea level. Both the rivers El Airo and Chiriacu begin in the mountains of El Airo Population The population of El Airo at the 2001 census was 1,093 inhabitants divided into 565 males and 528 women. The ethnicity of the residents is mestizo which is a mix of indigenous and Spanish ethnicities. Religion The people of El Airo consider themselves to be Catholic and as such celebrate religious festivals such as the festival of the cross in May and a festival to the patron saint San Vicente Ferrer the first Saturday of June each year. Art and culture The inhabitants of El Airo produce small handcrafted goods such as decorative pillows, handbags and doilies. Traditional satchels are also produced and can be either decorative or functional. These satchels range in size and be put on a donkey to carry heavy produce or over the shoulder for lighter loads. Agriculture and economy El Airo‚Äôs economy centers on agriculture. The majority of families in El Airo dedicate themselves to the cultivation of coffee as a cash crop. This crop is the principal source of income for almost every family, is recognized as one of the best in Ecuador and is grown organically. Sugar cane, yucca, banana and a variety of fruits are also grown for sustenance. Most families also raise chickens, pigs and a few have cattle and cuyes (guinea pigs). Because of coffee‚Äôs importance the inhabitants of El Airo have organized themselves into coffee cooperatives. These cooperatives exist to improve crop management and quality and negotiate better prices for members‚Äô harvest. The organizations are: APROCAIRO which placed #2 in the Taza Dorada Ecuadorian coffee contest in 2009, and Mercedes de Jes√∫s Molina. Tourism El Airo is a destination for those interested in coffee, outdoor and cultural tourism through its community tourism association, CoffeeWorks. National Park Yacuri is within El Airo‚Äôs limits and as such several natural points of interest exist within the parish such as highland paramo lakes (Las Rositas) and several waterfalls. The most interesting of these is located at 2000 meters above sea level and is called El Palmo because of the solitary palm tree at the top of its fall. Some visitors come to El Airo to observe organic coffee agriculture as well. Flora and fauna El Airo has several bird, butterfly and animal species. In the highlands area the spectacled bear has been spotted by locals. Communication El Airo recently was connected to the Ecuadorian mobile phone network and for much longer has received radio and television reception including some channels from Peru because of its proximity to the border. Transport Transport within El Airo is mostly by foot, donkey or motorcycle. Transport in and out of El Airo is provided by one bus a day as well as two rancheras (open air bus/truck combos) References Populated places in Loja Province ","title":"El Airo (Loja)"},{"id":"31221908","text":"Fist Stick Knife Gun: A Personal History of Violence is a memoir by Geoffrey Canada, an American social activist who is the current president and chief executive officer of Harlem Children's Zone. Beacon Press published the book on January 31, 1995. Publishers Weekly praised the book, commenting that \\"A more powerful depiction of the tragic life of urban children and a more compelling plea to end 'America's war against itself' cannot be imagined.\\" In the mid-2000s (decade), Beacon Press began considering publishing an alternate graphic novel version. Illustrator Jamar Nicholas and editor Allison Trzop created Fist Stick Knife Gun: A Personal History of Violence (A True Story in Black and White), which was released in stores on September 14, 2010. Book contents A panel from the graphic novel, with the young Geoffrey Canada at left Canada recalls growing up in an inner city neighborhood of [the South BronxCanada, Geoffrey. Fist, Stick, Knife.Gun. 2nd Edition. Boston, MA USA: Beacon Press, 1995. 13. Print.] in the 1950s and 1960s. He details the social expectations and culture that promoted violence among children such as himself and his brothers. He writes about how he and the other boys in the area had parents command them to counter violence and threats (real or perceived) in kind by fighting back. That parental mindset, argues Canada, is certainly well-intentioned but has devastating consequences for children. He also recalls his own familial issues being raised in fatherless poverty. Canada writes, \\"many times children as young as six and seven would bring weapons to school, or pick up bottles, bricks, or whatever was at hand.\\" He also says, \\"The first rules I learned on Union Avenue stayed with me for all of my youth. They were simple and straightforward. Don't cry. Don't act afraid. Don't tell your mother. Take it like a man. Don't let no one take your manhood\\" (emphasis in original). Canada asserts that the culture of violence has been compounded in the decades since he grew up. He cites increases in recreational drug use and handgun usage. He specifically refers to the about 50,000 American children killed by guns between 1979 and 1991 to support his argument. Canada concludes that inner city neighborhoods must enact measures restricting handgun manufacture and possession as well as create safe haven areas for children. Reception Publishers Weekly praised the book, stating that \\"A more powerful depiction of the tragic life of urban children and a more compelling plea to end 'America's war against itself' cannot be imagined.\\" The Los Angeles Times published a mostly positive review by author and arts critic Jabari Asim. Asim wrote that \\"[i]nterspersing his personal memoir with calls for policy reform gives Canada's book a patina of street-cred' that often compensates for his pedestrian language.\\" He also remarked that \\"Canada is unlikely to convert naysayers to his cause... preaching to the choir seldom results in anything\\" while also praising Canada's \\"eloquence and admirable passion.

Both the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Fatah's Al-Aqsa Brigades have claimed responsibility for the attack. Sources suspect that the bomber, identified as Samer Abu Suleiman from the West Bank village of Silat al-Khartiya by sources in the Islamic Jihad group, infiltrated into Israel near the Arab city of Umm al-Fahm from the Jenin area. In Jenin, about 3000 Palestinians marched and celebrated after the attack, according to witnesses. They chanted \\"Sharon, prepare the body bags\\" referring to then Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. = Fatalities = * Samuel Miloshevsky, 45, of Herzliya * Yehiav Elshad, 28, of Tel Aviv * Inbal Weiss, 22, of Zichron Ya'akov References 2001 crimes in Israel 2001 murders in Asia 2000s murders in Israel Palestinian terrorism Palestinian suicide bomber attacks against buses Terrorist attacks attributed to Palestinian militant groups Terrorist incidents in Israel in 2001 November 2001 events ","title":"Camp 80 junction bus 823 attack"},{"id":"31222079","text":"Gregory F.

The single-tracked branch line starts from Kempten in Germany, before crossing into Austria just after passing through Pfronten. It then transits the Au√üerfern area around Reutte, before passing back into Germany in order to terminate at Garmisch- Partenkirchen. The line provides the only rail access to Reutte and the Au√üerfern, albeit one that requires any journey to or from the rest of Austria to pass through German territory. The line connects with the Mittenwald Railway and the Munich‚ÄìGarmisch-Partenkirchen railway at Garmisch- Partenkirchen, with the former providing a link to the Tyrolean capital of Innsbruck. It connects with the Bavarian Allg√§u Railway and the Iller Valley Railway at Kempten. The line was built in stages, between 1895 and 1913. Although the Austrian section of the line is maintained by the Austrian Federal Railways (√ñBB), all train services are operated by Deutsche Bahn (DB).  History  The first plans for a mainline railway (Fernbahn) from Kempten over the Fern Pass to Innsbruck surfaced in the second half of the 19th century. On 1 December 1895 the first section from Kempten to Pfronten-Ried was opened, followed in 1905 by its extension to Sch√∂nbichl. From Sch√∂nbichl there was a Lokalbahn branch line to Reutte. A further extension of the line was discussed. There were three variants: Reutte‚ÄìEhrwald‚ÄìGaistal‚ÄìLeutasch, Reutte‚ÄìFern Pass‚ÄìImst (Fernbahn) or Reutte‚ÄìEhrwald‚ÄìGarmisch. Because Garmisch already had a connexion to Munich at the time, a direct link from Munich to Innsbruck, and hence the development of the Au√üerfern region, suggested itself. The Mittenwald Railway from Garmisch to Innsbruck was opened in 1912 and the Garmisch‚ÄìReutte line on 29 May 1913. Both routes were electrified from the start. Time and again there were discussions about building a line over the Fern Pass or to a junction with the line to F√ºssen only four kilometres away, but these plans were never realised. At various times the closure of the line was also discussed, last time in 2001, when the catenary was in a poor condition. In 2003 DB Regio was tasked with operating passenger services through the state of Tyrol. The catenary was dismantled and operations switched to the use of diesel trains. Soon after the catenary was reinstalled. Today (2010) the line is worked hourly by electric multiples.  Operations  = Route = simplified height profile of the line The railway begins in Kempten in the rolling Alpine Foreland and crosses the border with Austria between Pfronten and Sch√∂nbichl. It continues through Reutte and the surrounding Au√üerfern area around Reutte before crossing back to Germany between Ehrwald and Griesen. Its longest tunnel is the 512 metre long Katzenberg Tunnel, which is also called the Klausen Tunnel (after the Ehrenberger Klause) or Kesselwang Tunnel, between Reutte and Heiterwang. Its maximum gradient is 37.5‚Ä∞ or 3.75%. = Traffic =  Trains 1987: a Class 628.0 multiple unit near Sch√∂nbichl Today the railway is important for school, commuter and holiday traffic, but also handles a considerable amount of goods for a cement works and a wood yard in Vils. These goods trains only use the section from Vils to Garmisch however. The section between Kempten and Reutte is mainly worked by diesel multiple units of classes 628 and 642; between Reutte and Garmisch electric multiple units of classes 425 and 426 are employed. The operators for the entire route are Deutsche Bahn (DB) (on the Tyrolean section BahnCards, Werdenfelstickets, Bayerntickets and Sch√∂nes- Wochenende-Tickets are valid), the maintenance of the infrastructure is the responsibility of the Austrian Federal Railways (√ñBB). = Tourism = Tyrol The stops on the Ausserfern Railway between Garmisch-Partenkirchen and Reutte in Tyrol (Griesen, Ehrwald, Lermoos, L√§hn, Bichlbach-Berwang, Heiterwang-Plansee, Pflach) are start points for mountain tours in the Ammergau Alps (Friederspitz and Frieder, Schellschlicht, Daniel, Hochschrutte, Plattberg, S√§uling), in the Mieming Chain (Ehrwalder Sonnenspitze) and in the Lechtal Alps (Thaneller, Roter Stein, Pleisspitze). On 28 January 2007 the Hausbergbahn halt at the valley station of the Hausberg Gondola Lift, which serves a ski area, was opened again on a seasonal basis for winter sport tourists. In the first quarter of 2007 and in the winter of 2007/2008 only special winter sport trains from Munich via Garmisch-Partenkirchen to the Hausbergbahn stopped at weekends. From 14 December 2008 to the end of the ski season at Hausberg on 19 April 2009 all passenger trains on the Ausserfern Railway called at the station, which is why the halt in Griesen was dropped.‚ÄûFreistaat Bavaria optimiert Nahverkehrsangebot in Oberbayern‚Äú ‚Äì Press release by the Bayerische Eisenbahngesellschaft of 17 July 2008  Sources  * Siegfried Bufe: Au√üerfernbahn.

The home was run by evangelical Protestants, mainly (up to the 1960s) members of the Church of Ireland. It catered to \\"fallen women\\" and operated in Blackhall Place, Dublin (1921‚Äì34), and in Orwell Road, Rathgar (1934‚Äì72), until its closure. The home sent some children to Northern Ireland, England, and to the United States.

Former residents have claimed that as children they were victims of physical abuse and neglect while resident in the home, and that this accounted for the high mortality rate amongst children in the institution.Starved to Death by Galen English, Irish Daily Mail, 10 September 2010. It is claimed that while the home was not run by the Church of Ireland, it was affiliated through clerical and lay members sitting on the home's managing committee, church fundraising and reference of unwed pregnant women to the home by clergy. In a letter dated 9 April 1945 from the Church of Ireland's then Archbishop of Dublin, Arthur William Barton, to Gerald Boland, then Minister for Justice, he described the home as \\"a suitable place for Protestant girls on remand\\".\\"Bethany Home Church of Ireland link claimed\\", BBC website, 8 October 2010.

In August 1939, newspapers reported critical discussion at the Rathdown Board of Guardians on hospitalised Bethany children. The government's Deputy Chief Medical Adviser, Winslow Sterling Berry, visited the home on three occasions in 1939, once in February and twice in October. In February, Sterling Berry reversed an inspection report on a child said to have been in a \\"dying condition\\". He stated in October, \\"it is well recognised that a large number of illegitimate children are delicate and marasmic from their birth.\\" Sterling Berry observed that the home's most objectionable feature was admittance of Roman Catholics into a proselytising institution. He successfully pressured Bethany Home's managing committee into ceasing the admission of Roman Catholics. The Residential Secretary, Hettie Walker, claimed in 1940 that the measure was only agreed to because of a threat of refusal of funding under new legislation.The Irish State & the Bethany Home by Niall Meehan, submission to Ruairi Quinn, Minister for Education, Leinster House, 24 May 2011, by delegation consisting of Derek Leinster, Noleen Belton, Patrick Anderson McQuoid, Niall Meehan, Joe Costello TD The superintendent of the Church of Ireland's Irish Church Missions to the Roman Catholics, the Revd T.C.

General optometry clinic setup Cataracts in Ghana Optometry is a relatively new field in eye care in Ghana. History Optometry is a new field in the eye care system of Ghana. The Eye Secretariat of Ghana is the Ghana Ministry of Health agency concerned with eye care in the country. Ghana's first optometrist, Dr. Francis Kojovi Morny, is regarded as a key contributor to theme development of optometry there. Dr. Morny was trained in Nigeria, and returned to practice optometry after his training. He was the main brain behind the set-up of the Department of Optometry in University of Cape Coast to offer the Doctor of Optometry program and was also a senior lecturer in the department. He also served as a lecturer in KNUST when the program began. The first optometry school in Ghana started in the KNUST Department of Physics in 1992. The first class had just five students and was instructed by Dr. Morny. It initially offered only postgraduate degrees, but soon also offered bachelor's degrees. In 2004, just as the first batch of optometrists with the bachelor's degrees had graduated, they were enrolled for the two-year Doctor of Optometry (O.D) program. In 2002, the University of Cape Coast also began a Doctor of Optometry program. Training Over eighty percent of Ghanaian optometrists receive their training from the KNUST. In 2011, fifty-three and about sixteen students entered KNUST and UCC department of Optometry, respectively. Angela O. Amedo, one of the first optometrists in Ghana, is the Head of Department for Optometry at KNUST. There are about 200 optometrists in Ghana. Newly qualified optometrists The newly graduated optometrists are inducted into the Ghana Optometric Association so they can do their one-year internship at any of the Ministry of Health Hospitals or accredited eye clinics throughout the country. After their internship, they are required to write their qualifying exam which upon passing will allow the optometrist to practice without supervision. For a place to qualify to house new optometrists during their internship, there should be an optometrist or ophthalmologist working at the facility. Some of the places where new optometrists work in Ghana are: * the 37 Military Hospital * the Eastern Regional Hospital Koforidua * the SAEMA District Hospital, Takoradi * the Tamale Teaching Hospital Tamale * the Central Regional Hospital, Cape Coast * the Our Lady of Grace Hospital, Breman Asikuma * the Bishop Ackon Memorial Eye Hospital (Christian Eye Clinic), Cape Coast * the Volta Regional Hospital, Ho * the Margret Marquart Hospital, Kpandu * the Brong Ahafo Regional Hospital Sunyani * the Ridge Hospital, Accra * the Tema General Hospital * the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, Kumasi * the Upper East Regional Hospital, Bolga * the Upper West Regional Hospital, Wa * the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, Accra * the Agogo Presbyterian Hospital, Agogo Asante Akyem Ghana Optometric Association The Ghana Optometric Association (GOA) is the country's governing body for the optometry profession. Since 2009 all optometrists wanting to be members have had to write a professional exam. Passing this exam gives the optometrist the certification to practice in Ghana. As of March 2010, GOA had 139 members. Today the group has about 200 members. In 2010 the body and the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology's Faculty of Distance Learning rolled out a two-year programme to offer all members of GOA who did not have the Doctor of Optometry degree to enroll for it. The aim of the programme is to ensure that by the end of 2012 all optometrists in Ghana will have the O.D degree as is required under the Ministry of Health. =Executives= It is headed by DSP/Dr. Remi Ninkpe as President of GOA. Dr. Paa Kwesi Fynn Hope is the Secretary. =Activities= The GOA has done a lot since its inception. Apart from regulating the activities of optometrists countrywide, it also looks out for the well being of its members in ways such as: * Organizing continuing education programmes for optometrists * Advocating for better terms of service from the Ministry of Health * Partnering international bodies to promote eye care in Ghana One of the major achievements of GOA was hosting the World Council of Optometry (WCO) General Delegates meeting in Accra from 6 to 10 April 2005. It was the first time the meeting was held in Africa. The Ghana Optometric Association did so in collaboration with the Africa Council of Optometry with sponsorship from Essilor International. It was attended by about 200 delegates from the council. Ministry of Health and Optometrists The Ministry of Health through its hospitals and health facilities is the main provider of eye care services in the country. Over the years it has taken various initiates to train Optometrist through the various Universities. It is its aim to ensure that there is at least one functioning eye unit in every district of the country. So far the number of facilities is woefully inadequate to serve the needs of those who need such services. The MOH is still doing its best to lift the practice of Optometry in Ghana. At the 2010 induction ceremony for new Optometrist it promised to help regulate the activities of Optometrist more The situation would have been far worse if the various eye care facilities of the Christian Health Association of Ghana (CHAG) were not functioning. Thirty- five percent of Ghana's health service provision is done by CHAG. As and when new district eye centre are created, an Optometrist is posted there to attend to the district's eye care needs. It must be stated that to date, the MOH is the biggest employer of Optometrist in the country and the MOH deems with all seriousness the role they play in helping the save the sight of Ghanaians. Service delivery As the average Ghanaian becomes more enlightened concerning the eye and its conditions, optometrists would be required to do more too for their patients. The major concerns that eye patients raise are: * the long wait periods for them to see the eye doctor. One the average it take about two hours for patients to access eye care services in most MOH hospitals and clinics. * poor patient education practise from doctor to the patient With respect to the above, most optometrists the world over are adapting ICT to help the patient better. With respect to the long wait hours, various electronic medical records (EMRs) are being used. These do away with paper and manual recording of patient data. As such the patient does not need to wait for his or her records before seeing the doctor. EMRs the world over have been shown to reduce doctor-patient interactions by up to three times. Ghanaian optometrists are now turning to the use of EMRs to improve their daily work. Those who are using these EMRs bear witness to this and are continually advocating for the use of EMRs among their colleagues. One of the EMRs in use in Ghana is the Personal Digital Assistant for Eye Clinics (PDAEC). Concerning patient education, various ICT tools are also being used. They include: * Television-based educational tools that play (with vocal renditions in the most widely spoken language within the location of the clinic) while patients wait their turn in the waiting area. * Computer-assisted patient educational tools, that serve as a one-on-one tool for the optometrist during his or her patient education. Optometry bill There is no law regulating the practice of optometry in Ghana. Around 20% of people claiming to be optometrists in Ghana either do not have training in the field or \\"go beyond their scope of operation\\". A draft optometry bill has been presented to the cabinet, but is yet to be passed. The bill would give the Ghana Optometric Association the authority to regulate the practice of optometry in Ghana.

His family lived next to the Knob Creek Farm, Kentucky owned by Thomas Lincoln during Abraham Lincoln's boyhood years. LaFollette is shown in one of the limestone panels at the Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial in Lincoln City, Indiana. Early life LaFollette was born near Morristown, New Jersey in 1781. His father, Joseph, and grandfather, Jean, were Huguenots who had escaped the persecution in France, traveling first to Jersey and then to the colonies where they operated a small farm near the Wallkill River in northern New Jersey. Jean was killed during the French and Indian Wars. Joseph married Phoebe Gobel of Morristown, New Jersey, whose father's farm along with other neighboring farms in Jockey Hollow was used by George Washington and his troops during the winter of 1780. After serving with Count Casimir Pulaski during the Revolutionary War, Joseph and his family joined the pioneers who trekked westward through the Cumberland Gap. Kentucky LaFollette grew up in a pioneer community in Hardin County, Kentucky. As a young man, he started a farm in the hilly region of what is today LaRue County. His farm was adjacent to the Knob Creek Farm of Thomas Lincoln. Except for his service with the Kentucky Rifles during the War of 1812, he was engrossed in pioneer life on the frontier, hunting, clearing fields, farming, and raising a large family. The LaFollette and Lincoln families were part of a small community and shared many adventures of pioneer life. They were involved in land sales with each other and title disputes with speculators; they served on juries together; and they were of like mind on the issue of slavery siding with the abolitionists. Indiana When the LaFollettes crossed into Indiana, they left slavery issues behind. The 1816 constitution of Indiana explicitly banned slavery in the state. Jesse was also leaving land title disputes behind. He settled in Putnam County, Indiana. The old soldier, Joseph, traveled with him on this trek, dying in 1834, and was buried at James Cemetery in Putnam County, just east of Greencastle. Several of Jesse's sons struck out for new territory and began farming in Primrose, Wisconsin in the 1850s. Memorial In 1962 President John F. Kennedy signed into law an act that created Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial, which was dedicated in 1966. Jesse LaFollette is shown in the Kentucky panel of the memorial, standing next to Abraham Lincoln's father, Thomas Lincoln.

Curtis (July 26, 1923 - May 24, 2009) was a B-24 nagivator during World War II who spent over eight months as a prisoner of war. His exploits were chronicled, along with those of his friend and fellow POW, Lawrence Jenkins, in the 2007 book, Eagles' Wings, An Uncommon Story of World War II, by Andrew Layton. Biography A lifelong resident of Battle Creek, Jack Curtis was born on July 26, 1923. He left his night-time job at Kellogg's to enlist in the Army Air Corps when World War II broke out. Assigned to Aviation Cadet school, Curtis would become a Navigator on B-24 \\"Liberators\\" with the 376th Bomb Group, stationed in Southern Italy. By late 1944, Jack had become a seasoned combat veteran with more than 30 successful bombing missions to his credit. However, it was the 31st that would prove to be his most memorable. While flying over Marburg, Yugoslavia, his aircraft took a mortal hit that killed seven of its eleven crewmembers. Jack escaped, but not without great injury. His left femur was shattered by shrapnel, and the harrowing parachute jump only served to compound his wounds. After being captured by a German infantry detachment, Curtis would spend eight months in various Austrian prison facilities. He was finally liberated and sent back to the United States where he would receive medical care at Percy Jones Army Hospital in his hometown of Battle Creek. Among the close friends he made as a patient there were future US Senators Bob Dole and Daniel Inouye. Following the war, Curtis graduated from Albion College and returned to his job at Kellogg's. he eventually retired as an executive of industrial relations after some 43 years of service. Mr. Curtis was also involved with many volunteer and service organizations including the Southwest Michigan Food Bank, of which he is a founder. Captain Curtis's military awards and decorations include the Purple Heart, the Air Medal (with 6 Oak Leaf Clusters), the POW Medal, the American Campaign Medal, the ETO Campaign Medal (with 7 Battle Stars), the World War II Victory Medal and the British POW Medal.

A preliminary in vitro study on human CD4 and CD8 T cells found that cycloastragenol may moderately increase telomerase activity and inhibit the onset of cellular senescence. History Cycloastragenol was studied by Geron Corporation and sold to T.A. Sciences in early 2013 who are developing it as a product named TA-65. Bill Andrews of Sierra Sciences has done testing on the anti-aging aspect of TA-65;Dr. Bill Andrews anti-aging test of TA-65, as well as Maria Blasco in the journal Aging Cell, finding no increase in murine median or mean lifespan but some physiological anti-aging effects without augmenting cancer incidence. In late 2013, dietary supplement company RevGenetics released their conclusions on TA-65 that showed it is the single molecule cycloastragenol used in TA-65.TA-65 Molecule is Cycloastragenol More recently, on May 15, 2014 RevGenetics released a press release where they provide new information about a public UK government application where TA Sciences state (among other things) that the active ingredient in TA-65 is cycloastragenol.TA-65 is 98% Cycloastragenol Potential pharmacology Its method of action is purported to be the activation of the human enzyme telomerase. Cycloastragenol intake improved health span but not lifespan in normal mice. As part of a study sponsored by RevGenetics, the cycloastragenol- based product TA-65 was tested by UCLA scientist Rita B. Effros and RevGeneticsTA-65 scientist Hector F. Valenzuela. The small study (using T-cells taken from 6 participants) found that TA-65 activated telomerase in cultured cells in all samples, while another Astragalus extract did not. The clinical significance of this work is uncertain. Toxicity testing is limited and safety for the human consumer has not been adequately demonstrated. TA-65 was shown to improve biological markers associated with human health span through the lengthening of short telomeres and rescuing of old cells, although the significance of these findings in actual life expectancy is unknown. Publications in high-impact peer-reviewed journals are lacking however, and much of the online documentation supporting its use is sponsored by its manufacturers. As disordered telomerase function is a feature of almost all cancers, there is an unproven, but theoretical risk of oncogene-mediated cancer promotion through the use of telomerase activators.

Streuli stood tall, weighed , and threw and batted right-handed. He was an alumnus of Southwestern College (now Rhodes College) in Memphis. Streuli's professional career lasted for six seasons, from 1953 through 1957 with a brief return to the game in 1961.

It was host to a huge 45-day trading event starting on 15 August, which was exceptionally long for a fair in those times. Merchants came to it from all areas of England, Norway, Denmark, the Baltic states, and the Byzantine Empire. Scarborough Fair originated from a royal charter granted by King Henry III of England on 22 January 1253. The charter, which gave Scarborough many privileges, stated \\"The Burgesses and their heirs forever may have a yearly fair in the Borough, to continue from the Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary until the Feast of St Michael next following\\". (On the modern Roman Catholic calendar, the equivalent dates are 15 August‚Äì29 September.) Naturally, such a large occasion attracted a lot more than just tradesmen; they needed to be entertained and fed and therefore large crowds of buyers, sellers, and pleasure-seekers attended the fair. Prices were determined by supply and demand, with goods often being exchanged through the barter system. Records show that from 1383 due to another fair in neighbouring Seamer, Scarborough's prosperity slumped. In the early 17th century, competition from other towns' markets and fairs and increasing taxation saw further collapse of the Fair until it eventually became financially untenable. The market was revived again in the 18th century, but due to intense competition Scarborough Fair finally ended in 1788. The traditional \\"Scarborough Fair\\" no longer exists, but a number of low-key celebrations take place every September to mark the original event. Scarborough Fair in July 2006, witnessed medieval jousting competitions hosted by English Heritage in addition to the usual attractions. In 2016, a revival of the fair as a music festival headlined by Richard Ashcroft was attempted. Organizers canceled one month before the festival, citing \\"logistical issues\\". The fair features in the traditional English ballad \\"Scarborough Fair\\".

It was established by George Eden, the Governor-General of India, on 30 April 1842. The medal was awarded for the defence of Jalalabad from 12 November 1841 to 7 April 1842, during the First Afghan War, to the troops under the command of Sir Robert Sale. About 2,600 soldiers took part, including the 13th Foot (the only British Army unit present), the 35th Bengal Native Infantry, as well as detachments from other Indian Army units and some loyal Afghan forces. Appearance Two different versions of the Jellalabad Medal were awarded. The original medal was produced by the Calcutta Mint. It is silver and in diameter. Obverse: A mural crown with 'JELLALABAD' above. Reverse: The date 'VII APRIL 1842' over three lines. Suspension: A straight steel suspender attached to the medal by way of a steel clip. This original suspension was often replaced by a more decorative version. Naming: Issued unnamed, the medal was often named privately. The medals awarded to the 13th Foot had the name and regiment of the recipient engraved at their commanding officer's expense. This version was considered inartistic and, although awarded to serving soldiers, insufficient were produced to issue to next of kin of those who had died during the campaign. The East India Company therefore decided to strike a further issue of a new design. Although those in receipt of the original medal could exchange for the new medal, few did so with, for example, only five men of the 13th Foot opting to exchange. The second version of the medal was designed by William Wyon and produced by the Royal Mint in London. It is silver and in diameter. Obverse: The diademed head Queen Victoria facing left with the inscription 'VICTORIA VINDEX' (PROTECTOR).Cassell's New Latin-English Dictionary, 5th edition 1968. p. 643. . Defines Vindex as: 'one who lays claim to or protects, a claimant or protector' Reverse: a winged figure of Victory flying over the fortress at Jellalabad. Above is the inscription 'JELLALABAD VII APRIL' with below the year 'MDCCCXLII'. Suspension: A straight suspender attached to the medal by way of a steel clip. Many recipients replaced this with a more ornate silver suspension. Naming: The recipient's name and regiment were impressed on the edge in block capitals. The ribbon of both versions was a rainbow pattern of red, white, yellow, white and blue. No clasp was awarded with either medal.

Ice planets consist of a global cryosphere. They are bigger versions of the small icy worlds of the Solar System, which includes the moons Europa, Enceladus, and Triton, the dwarf planets Pluto and Eris, and many other small Solar System bodies such as comets. In June 2020, NASA scientists reported that it's likely that exoplanets with oceans, including some oceans that may be frozen, may be common in the Milky Way galaxy, based on mathematical modeling studies.  Characteristics and habitability  Ice planets usually appear nearly white with geometric albedos of more than 0.9. An ice planet's surface can be composed of water, methane, ammonia, carbon dioxide (known as \\"dry ice\\"), carbon monoxide, and other volatiles, depending on its surface temperature. Ice planets would have surface temperatures below 260 K (‚àí13¬∞C) if composed primarily of water, below 180 K (‚àí93¬∞C) if primarily composed of CO and ammonia, and below 80 K (‚àí193¬∞C) if composed primarily of methane. On the surface, ice planets are hostile to life forms like those living on Earth because they are extremely cold. Many ice worlds likely have subsurface oceans, warmed by internal heat or tidal forces from another nearby body. Liquid subsurface water would provide habitable conditions for life, including fish, plankton, and microorganisms. Subsurface plants as we know them could not exist because there is no sunlight to use for photosynthesis. Microorganisms can produce nutrients using specific chemicals (chemosynthesis) that may provide food and energy for other organisms. Some planets, if conditions are right, may have significant atmospheres and surface liquids like Saturn's moon Titan, which could be habitable for exotic forms of life.  Pluto and candidates  OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb is likely an ice planet Although there are many icy objects in the Solar System, there are no known ice planets (though Pluto was considered an ice planet until its reclassification in 2006). If a 9th planet suggested in 2016 is found, it will be an ice planet of many times the earth's mass with a surface temperature potentially under 70K. There are several extrasolar ice planet candidates, including OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb, OGLE-2013-BLG-0341L b and MOA-2007-BLG-192Lb.

He was also a serjeant-at-law, and in 1648 he published an often cited pamphlet justifying his reasons for supporting the Royalist cause. Biography Charles Dallison was the third son of Sir Thomas Dallison (d. 1626) of Greetwell, Lincolnshire, and Anne, daughter of Humfrey Littlebury, of Stainsby, in the same county.\\"He was third son of Sir Thomas Dallison, of Greetwell, co. Lincoln, Knt. by Anne, dau. of Humfrey Littlebury, of Stainsby, in the same county\\" . He was admitted to Gray's Inn in February 1620. He returned to Lincolnshire where by 1637 was the city of Lincoln's counsel, and became recorder of Lincoln in 1637. In June 1642 it appeared that Lincolnshire would support the Parliamentary cause when at the instigation of Francis, Lord Willoughby they agreed to implement the Militia Ordinance. In July Charles I visited Lincoln in the hope of persuading the local gentry to support his cause, when he arrived at Lincoln on 14 July 1642, Dallison made the speech of loyalty on behalf of the city and was knighted by Charles. Sir Charles, was appointed by the King to the Commission of Array for Lincolnshire (to organise the recruitment for the nascent Royalist army). Towards the end of the year, when the battle lines were drawn he was commissioned into the Royalist army as a colonel of a regiment horse (cavalry). In retaliation for his active support for the royalist cause, Parliament to impeach him on 14 September 1642 and in December he was deprived of his Receivership. On 9 March 1643 Sir Charles attacked parliamentary forces on Coddington Heath. On the 1 June while Parliamentary cavalry was absent from Lincolnshire supporting the siege of Nottingham, Royalist cavalry and dragoons sallied out from Gainsborough under the joint command of Sir John Brook, Sir Charles, and Captain Whichcote and attacked Market Rasen on 1 June 1643. On the following day they entered and occupied Louth. The next day, 3 June, they were driven out by a relief force from the Parliamentary garrison at Lincoln. About 100 Royalists were taken prisoner when the Parliamentarians retook Louth. On 6 May 1644 Sir Charles was taken prisoner by the Eastern Association when they assaulted captured Lincoln, but after a short imprisonment was exchanged and at the end of the First Civil War was governor of Newark. He went to France in 1646 and was absent for the Second Civil War. Sir Charles is notable as one of only seven Royalist delinquents exempted from the Parliamentary pardon passed by the commons on the 21 October 1648, cites House of Lords Journal www.british-history.ac.uk and by the Lords on 24 October: Francis, Lord Cottington, George, Lord Digby, Sir Robert Heath, Sir Francis Doddington, Sir George Radcliffe and Sir Richard Grenville. However on 11 November the House of Lords overturned their exemption on three of the men Lord Cottington, Sir Robert Heath and Sir Charles Dallison. He returned to England after the war and was fined ¬£465, which was reduced to ¬£351 in 1651. During the interregnum Dallison was thought by the authorities to be in favour of a Roman Catholic alliance to restore Charles II to the throne, however P. R. Newman states although \\"he came from a partially recusant background, he writings imply impatience with religion in whatever form\\". On 20 December 1661 The Lord Chancellor and Lord Treasurer approve the grant of certain lands in Lincolnshire to Sir Charles Dallison: Bibliography In 1648, while exiled in France, Sir Charles Dallison published The Royalist defence; Vindicating the King's Proceedings in the late Warre made against him. P. R. Newman considers this to be \\"The most expansive and cogently argued of all Royalist self-vindications\\". In it he explains that he initially took up arms because of the Militia Ordinance which he considered an illegal act because the king did not give his royal assent to it. In the opinion of Dallison no new law can be passed without the assent of the king, so those who marched under the authority of the Militia Ordinance were committing high treason, and it was the duty of all loyal subjects to defend the king against those who break the law and commit high treason. Family Most of Sir Charles's close family supported the Royalist cause. His uncle William Dallison and his son Robert Dallison fought for King Charles. In 1644 Robert was granted a baronetcy (see Dallison baronets), and along with his father were found by Parliament to be Royalist delinquents they their estates sequestrated and compounded for the sum of ¬£1,300. This did not deter Sir Robert who in 1658 was known to be actively sympathetic to the Royalist cause. Thomas Dallison another Lincolnshire man from another branch of the family, was a Roylist colonel of horse who was slain at the Battle of Naseby in 1645. Sir Charles had a number of children, and was probably a Roman Catholic, as one son became a Roman Catholic priest and two daughters became nuns. He also had a number of other children including: *Charles, who inherited property from him. *Robert. *Anne who married Sir William Thorold (d. 1666) of Hough.

In the First World War an airfield was established near Saint-Inglevert by the Royal Flying Corps, later passing to the Royal Air Force on formation and thus becoming RAF Saint Inglevert.for a description of some RFC/RAF operations on the field, see No. 115 Squadron RAF In 1920, a civil airfield was established on a different site which was a designated customs airfield. During the Second World War, Saint-Inglevert was occupied by the Royal Air Force and the Arm√©e de l'Air. The airfield was captured by the Germans towards the end of the Battle of France and occupied by the Luftwaffe. It was abandoned in 1941, but in 1943 field artillery units were based around the airfield as part of the Atlantic Wall. Although civil flying returned to Saint-Inglevert post-war, the airfield was abandoned in 1957 and returned to agriculture. It was reopened by l'A√©roclub du Boulonnais () in 1986. Location Saint-Inglevert airfield is located on a hill to the north west of the village of Saint-Inglevert, and east of Hervelinghen. It lies south west of Calais. History =First World War= There was a Royal Flying Corps airfield at Saint-Inglevert during the First World War, but not on the site of the current airfield. In April 1918, No. 21 Squadron Royal Air Force (RAF) were based at Saint-Inglevert, flying Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8 aircraft. From 29 June to 23 October, No. 214 Squadron RAF were based there flying Handley Page O/400s, and in November, they were replaced by No. 115 Squadron RAF, who were flying the same type of aircraft. Two more squadrons, No. 97 Squadron RAF and No. 100 Squadron RAF, were based there from 17 November, to be joined by two squadrons of the United States Navy in 1918, flying Sopwith Camels. All Royal Air Force squadrons departed from Saint- Inglevert on 4 March 1919. =Between the wars= In 1920, an airfield was established at Saint-Inglevert on a different site to the former military airfield. Facilities developed over the years to include two hangars, customs facilities and ultra short wave radio. In March 1920, a Notice to Airmen was issued stating that Saint-Inglevert was open and fuel, oil and water were available, but there were no hangars or repair facilities. A proposal to designate Saint-Inglevert as a customs airfield in order to relieve Le Bourget of some of its workload was made in April 1920. Facilities then in existence included hangars, repair facilities and a radio station. Later that month, it was notified that an aerial lighthouse had been installed at the airfield, flashing the Morse letter A, and Saint-Inglevert became a customs airport on 20 May. By July, the provision of ground signals at Saint-Inglevert had begun. A arrow was displayed indicating the wind direction. In August, it was reported that Saint-Inglevert was sending weather report by radio seven times a day to Le Bourget. By October, aids available included a windsock and a landing T. Requirements for aircraft to perform clockwise or anticlockwise circuits when landing were indicated by the flying of a red or white flag respectively. The aerial lighthouse was reported to be out of action in November 1920. It was notified that the road forming the eastern boundary of the airfield was to be marked by a series of posts high, surmounted by vertical white discs in diameter, in January 1921, and the following month, a Notice to Airmen issued in the United Kingdom stated that radio communication with Saint-Inglevert was to be in French. As part of a series of trials to assess the viability of civil aviation in France, a Farman F.60 Goliath flew a test flight carrying of cargo on 1 May. Three laps of a circuit Paris ‚Äì Orl√©ans ‚Äì Rouen ‚Äì Saint-Inglevert ‚Äì Metz ‚Äì Dijon ‚Äì Paris were flown. Saint- Inglevert was one of the designated landing places for the 1921 Coupe Michelin, an aerial circuit of France with a ‚Ç£20,000 prize. In November, a Compagnie des Messageries A√©riennes aircraft called at Saint-Inglevert to collect a cargo of six 18-pounder and three 4.5‚Äìinch live shells for onward transmission to Croydon Airport in Surrey, United Kingdom. In a paper read to the Royal Aeronautical Society on 17 November, Colonel Frank Searle, managing director of Daimler Airway, criticized the organization of Saint-Inglevert and Le Bourget. In or about March 1922, the wireless station at Saint-Inglevert was destroyed in a fire. A meeting of airlines and the British Air Ministry in April following the 1922 Picardie mid-air collision on 7 April at Thieuloy- Saint-Antoine, Oise resulted in a number of resolutions being passed with the intention of improving the safety of aviation, one of which was that the Saint-Inglevert wireless station should be replaced. The aerial lighthouse at Saint-Inglevert was in operation again by 11 April, when a test flight was flown at night on the British part of the London ‚Äì Paris air route. The aircraft flew as far as Saint-Inglevert before turning back and landing at Lympne, Kent. In December, a Notice to Airmen stated that a portable searchlight was in operation at Saint-Inglevert by prior arrangement for aircraft landing at night, and that the \\"T\\" was illuminated at night. In April 1923, a ‚Ç£25,000 prize (then worth ¬£360) was offered by the daily newspaper Le Matin for the first French aviator to fly from Saint-Inglevert to Lympne and back in one day in an aircraft of French design and construction, with an engine capacity of less than . Georges Barbot won the prize when he completed the journey during the evening of 6 May in a Dewoitine aircraft fitted with a Clerget engine. It took him 2 hours and 25 minutes, including a 40-minute stop at Lympne while one of the struts supporting the undercarriage was repaired. Imperial Airways were operating cross-channel services using Armstrong Whitworth Argosy aircraft in 1924, with the first stop in France at Saint- Inglevert. When an aircraft departed from Lympne for St Inglevert, the destination airfield was advised, and if arrival was not notified within two hours, the British coastguard was informed. Communication between the airfields used Carmichael Microway UHF transmitters. A new system was introduced for non-radio aircraft crossing the English Channel in August. Aircraft crossing from Lympne to Ostend, Belgium had to make a circuit of the airfield at an altitude of , while two circuits were made if departing for Saint-Inglevert. The destination was then informed by radio of the departure. Arrival was confirmed by the aircraft flying another circuit, and was then reported back to Lympne by radio. If the aircraft had not arrived within an hour of departure, it would be considered as missing. A similar arrangement applied for aircraft flying in the reverse direction. In September, Saint- Inglevert was one of the landing points for an aerial \\"Tour de France\\", in which a specified route had to be flown on a course. Sixteen aircraft competed in four classes. The airfield has been involved in several aviation records. On 18 September 1928, Juan de la Cierva completed the first cross-Channel flight in an autogyro when he landed there after departing from Lympne in a Cierva C.8. Lissant Beardmore completed the first cross-Channel flight in a glider on 19 June 1931. He took off from Lympne and was towed by an aircraft to an altitude of , landing at Saint-Inglevert after a flight of one and a half hours to the surprise of the airfield manager. The first double crossing of the Channel in a glider was made by Austrian Robert Kronfeld on 20 June. In a glider called Wien, (p576, p577) he took off from Saint-Inglevert by means of an aero-tow to an altitude of , and landed at the former RAF Swingfield airfield near Dover, Kent. From Swingfield, another aero-tow to an altitude of enabled him to return to Saint-Inglevert. Kronfeld received a ¬£1,000 prize from the Daily Mail for his flights, which were verified by the British Gliding Association. On 10 September 1929, Charles Fauvel departed from Saint- Inglevert in a Mauboussin aircraft fitted with an ABC Scorpion engine. The flight to Pau set a new F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale world record for distance flown by a single seat aircraft weighing less than . In November 1932, it was reported that new radio equipment was to be installed at Lympne and St Inglevert operating on the 15 centimetre waveband at 2,000 MHz, which would be used for the announcement of departures of non-radio aircraft across the Channel. Messages sent by radio were also printed out by a teleprinter, providing a record of the communication. The British Air Ministry and the French Minist√®re de l'Air co-operated in the arrangements for setting up the system, which was scheduled to come into operation in Spring 1933. It proved its effectiveness on 7 March 1933, when a non-radio de Havilland DH.60 Moth of British Air Transport failed to arrive at Lympne. The aircraft had ditched in the Channel and both occupants were rescued by a steamship bound for Amsterdam, the Netherlands. A new short-wave radio system came into operation on 16 January 1934, using equipment manufactured by Le Mat√©riel T√©l√©phonique, Paris. (p96, p97) In the mid-1930s, a number of notable people used Saint- Inglevert Airfield. King Edward VIII made three visits, the first on 4 February 1935, while still the Prince of Wales, when he arrived from Fort Belvedere, Surrey on the first part of a journey to take a holiday at Kitzb√ºhel, Austria. As king, he departed on 26 July 1936 to RAF Hendon on his return from the ceremony to unveil the Canadian National Vimy Memorial, and flew in from the Great West Aerodrome, Harmondsworth, UK on 8 August, in order to catch the Orient Express at Calais, as part of a holiday in Yugoslavia. Henri Mignet flew from Saint-Inglevert to Lympne on 13 August 1935, in his Flying Flea, then the world's smallest aircraft. =Second World War= Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Saint-Inglevert was taken over by the Arm√©e de l'Air in December 1939. Groupe A√©rien d'Observation 516 (GAO 516) of the 16√®me Corps d'Arm√©e () were based here, operating five Potez 63-11 and five Breguet 27 aircraft, and carrying out air reconnaissance over the Nord-Pas de Calais region. \\"B\\" Flight, No. 615 Squadron RAF was stationed at Saint-Inglevert in the early months of 1940, equipped with Gloster Gladiator II aircraft. Following the discovery of a dismantled Morane-Saulnier MS.138 in one of the hangars, a wager was made between the British and French as to whether or not the aircraft could be returned to the air. With the aid of materials supplied by the French, the aircraft was made flyable, but when 615 Squadron received orders to relocate to Vitry-en-Artois, an attempt to fly the aircraft to the new base was unsuccessful, and a forced landing had to be made in a field. On 10 May 1940, the airfield was attacked by the Luftwaffe, with over 110 bombs being dropped, resulting in a Breguet being destroyed, another Breguet and a Potez being severely damaged and the radio facilities being temporarily put out of action. During April 1940, No. 607 Squadron RAF was based at Saint-Inglevert, flying Gloster Gladiator Mk II HR aircraft. The military commander General Maxime Weygand visited the airfield on 21 May, and ordered 516 GAO to prepare to evacuate as the Germans were in the neighbouring Somme department. The following day, the order came to evacuate to Boos airfield, Rouen, Normandy, but only four of the ten aircraft that departed from Saint-Inglevert arrived safely at Boos. All aircraft carried as many passengers as could be accommodated. Two Potez 63-11's and a Bloch MB.152 were abandoned at Saint-Inglevert, and were destroyed to prevent their use by the enemy, as were supplies of fuel. Personnel from 516 GAO were evacuated from Dunquerque on the , although nineteen of them were killed when the ship struck a mine and sank. Messerschmitt Bf 109 F-2 of Werner M√∂lders, leader of Jagdgeschwader 51 at the time it was based at Saint-Inglevert Saint- Inglevert was captured by the Luftwaffe towards the end of the Battle of France. 1 Gruppe, Lehrgeschwader 2 moved in on 20 June, equipped with Messerschmitt Bf 109 aircraft. They departed for Jever, Germany, on 12 July, and were replaced by 1 Gruppe, Jagdgeschwader 51, also equipped with Bf 109s. From August until November Stab JG 51 were in occupation, and Aufkl√§rungsgruppe 32(H) aircraft were also based at Saint-Inglevert during this period, with the unit operating Henschel Hs 126 parasol monoplanes. On 30 July 1940, Saint-Inglevert was bombed by the Royal Air Force, who claimed that hangars and aircraft were damaged, and a subsequent raid on 19 August resulted in a fire, smoke from which could be seen in Kent. From 24 September to 5 November, 2 Gruppe, Jagdgeschwader 27 were based there. Facilities at the airfield were improved, by erecting new hangars and constructing a new concrete runway. On 27 December 1940, Saint-Inglevert was again bombed by the Royal Air Force. The airfield was largely abandoned by 1941, with occasional use by Junkers 52s as a refuelling station. In 1943, the airfield was designated as St√ºtzpunkt 134 Paderborn, housing defence units as part of the Atlantic Wall coastal fortifications. The units were equipped with 10.5 cm leFH 18 howitzers. During the winter of 1943‚Äì44, 10.5 cm leFH 324(f) howitzers replaced the leFH 18s. A number of concrete bunkers were constructed to house the guns, which were still standing around the airfield in October 2007. Following Operation Overlord at the start of the Allied invasion of western Europe, the Germans committed various acts of sabotage on departure from Saint-Inglevert. =Post-war= Post-war, the airfield was restored to operational condition and civil flying returned. On 10 April 1957, a report was published which resulted in the abandonment of Saint-Inglevert in favour of an airport east of Calais. The airfield was returned to agriculture. In 1986, l'A√©roclub du Boulonnais took over Saint-Inglevert following closure of their previous base at Ambleteuse. Since its closure, the runway had been used as a dump for old tyres and scrap vehicles, and it took three years to restore the airfield, which reopened on 30 July 1989. On the night of 5‚Äì6 April 2010, a fire in a hangar at Saint-Inglevert destroyed the hangar and eight aircraft. The destroyed aircraft were replaced by a Robin DR300, a Robin DR400, a Piel Emeraude CP3005 and a Jodel D195. A Piper PA-28 was also acquired which needed restoration to make it airworthy. The replacement aircraft were housed in a tent hangar erected on the airfield, or temporarily outstationed at Calais or Le Touquet. A new hangar, replacing the one destroyed by the fire, was officially opened on 30 March 2012, and can accommodate ten aircraft. Following the fire, a NOTAM was issued temporarily restricting the use of the airfield until 15 November 2010 to aircraft based there. On 26 August 2010, Saint-Inglevert was given the ICAO identifier LFIS, allowing it to be classed as a public airfield instead of a private one. This had taken ten years to achieve. Accidents and incidents *On 1 September 1922, A Farman F.60 Goliath on a flight from Croydon Airport to Paris, suffered a severely damaged propeller after flying through torrential rain whilst crossing the English Channel. The engine was shut down and a precautionary landing was made at Saint-Inglevert where the propeller was changed in 15 minutes. The aircraft then departed for Le Bourget, where arrival was only 12 minutes later than scheduled. *In February 1923, an aircraft belonging to Instone Air Line was damaged in an accident at Saint-Inglevert. Notes # All locations are in the Pas-de-Calais D√©partement unless indicated otherwise. # The phrase \\"it was notified\\" indicates that a Notice to Airmen had been issued by either the British Civil Aviation Authority or the French Direction G√©n√©rale de l'Aviation Civile as appropriate.

History After the massacre of General Elphinstone's Army during the 1842 retreat from Kabul, the only forces left in Afghanistan were at Jalalabad and Kelat-I-Ghilzie, a fort between Kabul and Kandahar. The garrison numbering 932, (55 Europeans and 877 Natives), consisted of Shah Shoja's 3rd Infantry Battalion, three companies of the 43rd Bengal Native Infantry, forty European gunners, sixty Bombay Sappers and Miners, and eight British officers, all under the command of Captain John Halket Craigie. All were members of the Indian Army, with no British Army units present. For most of the winter, the garrison was besieged under very difficult circumstances. Finally, on 19 May 1842, a force was sent to draw off the garrison and relieve them from their post. Before the relief force arrived, the garrison repulsed one final major attack by some six thousand Afghans on 21 May 1842. A few days after this attack the garrison was finally relieved by the forces under Sir William Nott, on 26 May 1842. For the courage displayed by the garrison at Kelat-i-Ghilzie, the East India Company, on 4 October 1842, authorised the medal to be awarded to all troops who participated in the protracted siege. A testament to the distinguished service of the native troops is evident in the fact that the troops of Shah Shoja's 3rd Infantry Battalion were taken into the Bengal Army as the Kelat-i-Ghilzie Regiment. Description The medal, designed by William Wyon, was silver and in diameter, with the following design: The obverse contains a laurel wreath with mural crown at the top of a shield with the inscription KELAT-I-GHILZIE. The reverse has a trophy of arms on top of a plaque bearing the inscription 'INVICTA MDCCCXLII'. The suspension consists of a straight steel suspender, attached to the medal by way of a steel clip and pin. The ribbon is the watered rainbow coloured ribbon common to most East India Company medals. It is red on the left edge fading into white, which changed to yellow in the centre, fading back to white, until finally changing to blue at the right edge. The name of the recipient was engraved in script on the edge of the medals issued to British personnel. Medals issued to indigenous troops were often not named.

Biography Tarasov-Rodionov was born in Astrakhan where his father was a surveyor. He studied law at the University of Kazan and joined the Bolshevik party in 1905; taking an active part in the 1905 Revolution. In 1908, he received his law degree. He was drafted in 1914, and became a second lieutenant. Later, he participated in the 1917 Revolution and was involved in taking Pyotr Krasnov prisoner during the Kerensky-Krasnov uprising. He also fought with the Red Army during the Civil War. After being demobilized, he worked as a magistrate and was involved in setting up the literary organizations ' (The Smithy) and RAPP.The Soviet Union, A Biographical Dictionary, Macmillan, NY, 1990. At this time, he also began writing. His works were printed in proletarian magazines such as Oktyabr and Young Guard. His novel Chocolate was published in 1922. His troubles began in 1931 when, on a business trip to Berlin, he met Vladimir Nabokov and persuaded him to return to Russia for a visit. Nabokov's family had supported the White Army and he was disdainful of what he saw. After that, Tarasov-Rodionov fell out of favor with the communist party and was under suspicion. On 27 April 1938, he was arrested on charges of espionage and Trotskyism. He was sentenced to death the same day and, five months later, was executed at the Kommunarka shooting ground.Biographical note, Fifty Years of Russian Prose, M.I.T Press, 1971. In 1956, he was rehabilitated. A number of his other works, including Grass and Blood (1924) and his unfinished autobiographical trilogy Heavy Steps (begun in 1927) were long considered to be ideologically incorrect, along with Chocolate, which was also burned by the Nazis during the extensive Nazi book burnings in 1933.Library of Burned Books (German) \\"Chocolate\\" thumb The work was first published in December 1922 in the journal \\"Young Guard.\\" It tells the story of Zudin, a chairman of the local Cheka, who is accidentally implicated in and finally executed for a bribery scandal involving, among other things, some chocolate that his wife accepted as a gift from his secretary. It was reprinted in the USSR five times (1925, 1927, 1928, 1930, 1990), and translated into several languages, including Hungarian, where it was read by young revolutionaries such as Imre Lakatos. A review, published in the Petrograd \\"Red Student\\", was enthusiastic, saying that the death by execution of Zudin, though an unfortunate turn of events since he was innocent, revealed a real pattern: Communists and specifically the Chekists are first and foremost merciless towards themselves. The main character, is purportedly based on the recollections of Felix Dzerzhinsky, as cited in the memoir of V. V. Ovsienko, about the real person D. Y.

It primarily sought to mobilise the masses in support of their demands. Divisions amongst key members of the IAC's core committee eventually led to a split within the movement- Arvind Kejriwal left to form the Aam Aadmi Party, while Anna Hazare left to form Jantantra Morcha.  Rise  The IAC popular protest movement began in 2011 as part of a larger wave of demonstrations and protests. The official position of figureheads in the IAC movement was that it had no formal organisation beyond a 24-member core committee. In 2011, the organisers of IAC determined to launch a campaign to mobilise the masses in support of a demand- the creation of a Lokpal (ombudsman) who would have powers to arrest and charge government officials accused of corruption., that they hoped would help to bring about a corruption-free India. The campaign gained strength through social media, building a massive network of supporters. Initially, they approached Ramdev, a populist Indian yogi to be the figurehead for this campaign but his connections to the right-wing Sangh Parivar threatened to damage the credibility of what was perceived as an apolitical movement. This led to him being replaced by Anna Hazare, a veteran social reformer. Hazare, too, brought a large support base with him, described by Meera Nanda as being largely \\"from urban middle-classes and idealistic youth\\". The urban sophistication of Hazare, compared to Ramdev's rusticity, attracted high- profile support for the campaign from Bollywood stars, the internet-savvy, and mainstream English-language news media.  Internal split  In 2012, the IAC began to splinter with Hazare's followers coming to be known as Team Anna. By late 2012, the split had deepened, caused by differences of opinion among the central figures regarding the IAC's lack of practical success and its unwillingness to be directly engaged in the political system. An IAC survey of the masses suggested that direct involvement in politics was preferable, leading to Arvind Kejriwal and some others splitting to form the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in order to cause change from within the system. Hazare rejected the survey findings. In August 2012, Hazare announced that he was disbanding Team Anna, around the time that the divisions were coming to a head. In November 2012, after the split, he said that he was forming a new Team Anna, that it would retain the label of India Against Corruption and that its members were discussing other societal issues to be addressed. The new Team Anna, sometimes referred to as Team Anna 2.0, prepared to tour the country from 30 January 2013, coinciding with the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. On 30 January 2013, Hazare announced that he had formed Jantantra Morcha, a campaigning group that included the previously-named members of Team Anna 2.0 and which he considered to be a replacement for IAC but with a broader agenda.  Criticism  Historian and commentator Ramachandra Guha has questioned the image that has been presented of IAC and of Hazare. Acknowledging that Hazare had previously been successful in campaigns for infrastructure reforms at the local level in his native Maharashtra and that the IAC campaign of 2011 had an impact, Guha doubts the claims that the 2011 and 2012 protests overwhelmingly engaged the masses. He notes that liberals were concerned with a perceived anti-democratic rhetoric while socially oppressed communities, such as the dalits and Other Backward Classes, were worried that the \\"savarna\\" led movement would undermine the gains they have made through legislative reforms, such as those resulting from the Mandal Commission. He considers that the attention given to the protest by 24-hour news channels and internet resources has masked the realities, such as that popular participation at the Jantar Mantar and Ramlila Maidan protests in Delhi was a fraction of that evidenced in Kolkata in 1998 when 400,000 marched in an anti-nuclear movement. Guha further said that scandals, such as the 2G spectrum case, were high-profile examples of the endemic corruption prevalent in Indian society at all levels but the IAC solution ‚Äî the Lokpal ‚Äî was only a \\"simplistic\\" reaction.

Referred to locally as DCC, the church is a historical landmarkThe Davis Register (2010). \\"City Of Davis Designated Historical Resources.\\" centrally located in downtown Davis, just three blocks east of the University of California, Davis. DCC's Vision: \\"Davis Community Church is, and seeks to become more fully, a congregation of Christians growing as a community in our identities as beloved children of God and becoming beacons of that love in the world. Beloved of God, Let Us Love\\" DCC's Values: \\"Love, Inclusiveness, Justice, Integrity, Engagement, Trust, Generosity, Stewardship, Discernment, and Discipleship\\" Davis Community Church is a member of the Covenant Network of Presbyterians, a broad-based, national group of clergy and lay leaders working for a church that is simultaneously faithful, just, and whole. DCC is also a member of the Sojourners Faith & Justice Network. History: 1800 - 1999 Davis Community Church has a rich and storied history, beginning in the early 1800s when Presbyterian congregations met in rural homes and school houses in Yolo County. Following the incorporation of the Town of Davisville in 1868, First Presbyterian Church of Davisville was formally organized. A wooden frame church was built at a cost of $4,000 on the northeast corner of Fourth and E Streets. In 1875, the original building was sold and the church's second structure was built on the southeast corner of Fourth and C Streets. The town of Davisville officially changed its name to Davis in 1907. The church was completely destroyed by a fire in 1924. That same year, the church helped to establish the Cal Aggie Christian Association, now an ecumenical Protestant campus ministry located on Russell Boulevard. In 1925, the church adopted the name \\"Davis Community Church.\\" While maintaining its ties with the Presbyterian denomination, the church developed an ecumenical Protestant vision, declaring itself an interdenominational church, with ties to the Presbyterian, Methodist, and Congregational denominations. In 1926, the present mission style sanctuary building was built at the northeast corner of Fourth and C Streets. Representatives of Baptist, Methodist, Episcopal, Congregational, and Presbyterian denominations attended the cornerstone laying ceremony. Just eleven years later, an arson fire led to structural repairs of the sanctuary, including the installation of a stained glass window based on William Holman Hunt's painting, \\"The Light of the World,\\" above the choir loft. A The formal relationship with the Methodist and Congregational denominations ended in 1955, whereupon DCC became a solely Presbyterian congregation. However, it has maintained its ecumenical spirit and standing within the community to this present day, and has become a congregation committed to social justice and interfaith collaboration. In 1960, the Church Office was built, followed by the Christian Education wing of the church two years later. In 1974, DCC responded to an expressed community need for childcare by forming the Davis Community Church Nursery School, a parent cooperative offered to the larger Davis community. The Davis Community Church Nursery School continues to operate as a parent cooperative on the corner of Fourth and D Streets. Tragedy struck again in 1993 when an arson fire caused major damage to two new buildings under construction. The two buildings, the Fellowship Hall and Phoenix Hall, were re-built following the fire at a total cost of $1.8 million. History: 2000 - Present Davis Community Church continues its 143-year history as a community-based church, with Presbyterians, Methodists, Lutherans, Episcopalians, Baptists, and others deeply involved in the congregational life. Davis Community Church is well known in the community for its programs in the areas of education, peace and justice, and compassionate care. Notable programs include: Stephen Ministry: A program of lay people who are specially trained to provide one-on-one care to the bereaved, hospitalized, terminally ill, separated, divorced, unemployed and others facing a crisis or life challenge. Interfaith Rotating Winter Shelter of Davis: The Interfaith Rotating Winter Shelter (IRWS) was created by DCC and other faith communities in 2007 as a response to the shortage of emergency winter shelter beds in Davis, CA. The IRWS serves over 100 homeless guests annually and is supported by a volunteer corps of 1,300. Davis ArtsPlay: Davis ArtsPlay was created by DCC in 2010 as an offering for families with young children. The Mission of Davis ArtsPlay is \\"to provide affordable and accessible experiences to encourage children‚Äôs creativity through arts play.\\" Davis ArtsPlay is open to all, without regard for financial, emotional, physical or developmental barriers. Davis Empowerment Project: The Davis Empowerment Project (DEP) is a social entrepreneurial venture established by DCC, homeless individuals, and other community members.

He is honoured as a saint and his feast day is 12 August. Life According to the writings of Ennodius, bishop of Pavia in early 6th-century, Eusebius was Greek. He probably participated, as bishop of Milan, to a synod held in Rome in 449 which condemned the doctrines of Eutyches, deemed to be heretic. Surely Eusebius was the addressee of a letter written by Pope Leo the Great and carried to Milan in 451 by Abundius bishop of Como and Senator, who were returning to North Italy from Constantinople. In 451 Eusebius convened a Provincial Council in Milan, attended by eighteen bishops, where the Tome of Leo was read and approved, and consequently the doctrines of Eutyches were condemned. The main political event in Eusebius' episcopate was the 452 invasion of Italy by the Huns led by Attila. The Huns razed Aquileia and then moved East and sacked numerous cities such as Padua. They entered also in Milan where Attila occupied the imperial palace and set fire to a large part of the town, destroying also the cathedral of Saint Tecla. Eusebius, along with many citizens, fled from the Huns and left the town. They returned in Milan only when Attila was convinced by Pope Leo to retire. Eusebius led the reconstruction of the town, including the cathedral which was re-consecrated in 453 by Maximus II bishop of Turin (not to be confused with Saint Maximus of Turin) who for the occasion spoke the homely De reparatione ecclesiae mediolanensis. Eusebius died on 8 August, probably in 462, and his remains were interred in the city‚Äôs basilica of St. Lorenzo Maggiore. His feast is celebrated on 12 August.

It was named after the Greek hero of the Macedonian Struggle, Pavlos Melas. It was formed at the administrative reform introduced by the governmental Kallikratis plan (N. 3852 / 7-6-2010). It is the result of the unification of the former municipalities of Efkarpia, Polichni and Stavroupoli.Kallikratis law Greece Ministry of Interior The area of the new Municipality is 23.763 km2. Its population is 99,245 based on the last official census of 2011. The seat of the municipality is in Stavroupoli. Urbanism The modern outlook of the Municipality is a result of a gradual town planning which is closely connected to the residential course of action of the northern and western prefecture of the previous urban core of Thessaloniki. Since the homing of refugees - when the first systematic settlement of the area of interest takes place - and at different time zones the advent of new populations broadened its district creating urban pocks of residency that according to the circumstances and the time of development they acquired special town planning and social characteristics. Despite the co- ordinated efforts of the past decades of restraint of urban diffusion, it is still ongoing and characterizes the area of the Municipality, including the areas with especially dense urban web but also regions with greater distance from the city center, legally or illegally developed with less urban characteristics. The immediate proximity of the Municipality with transportational axes of entry and exit of the city, in the past and today, has as a result the mixture of usually incompatible practices with the existence of industrial and craft units, enough of which have been abandoned or dis-function. The wide peri-urban zone of the Municipality apart from the production units includes other activities of metropolitan and regional scale, such as the two hospitals and other fallow green and reforested areas of the peri-urban mountainous zone. The Municipality of Pavlos Melas like all other municipalities of Greece have the following responsibilities: * Environment * Quality of life and orderly function of cities * Social Protection * Education, Culture and sports Finally, among others and in accordance to the internal regulation plan of Municipalities and Communities, Pavlos Melas exerts state responsibilities at a local level. That is responsibilities on matters of urban situation, concerning granting licenses of retail markets, of outdoor itinerant trade, operation of exhibitions, foundation and operation of flee markets e.t.c. Subdivisions *Municipal Unit of Efkarpia It is located on the northern side of the Thessaloniki Conurbation and on the northern side of the Municipality of Pavlos Melas. It has a population of 13.905 residents and it includes the following planning sections: Social housing, Old Housing Estate, Travmatioupoli, 4, 5, 6, Efedroupoli, Filothei and Efxinoupoli. *Municipal Union of Polichni It is located on the northwest side of the Thessaloniki Conurbation and on the east side of the Municipality of Pavlos Melas. It has a population of 39.332 residents and it includes the following planning sections: Elpidos, 3, 4, 5, Meteora below the grove, Old Housing Estate, 8, Pavlou Mela, 11, Above Asylum, Anthokipoi, Nikopoli, 15 and 16 *Municipal Union of Stavroupoli It is located on the west side of the Thessaloniki Conurbation and on the southwest side of the Municipality of Pavlos Melas. It has a population of 46.008 residents and it includes the following planning sections: Terpsithea, Ampelones, Neoktista, Above Asylum, Omonia, Ilioupoli, Pronia and Nikopoli.  History  As already mentioned the systematic and organized residential settlement in the municipality's district is detected during the refugee era that is 1914 and since. More specifically, during the years of 1913 until 1916 the first refugee wave which includes populations thrown out in 1913 from west Thrace, in 1914 from Asia Minor (Erithrea, Athramitio, Thekeli, Pergamos, Fokaia) but also in 1916 from Pontos. In a report from the Ministry of Finances are mentioned two organized refugee settlements of that period, one in Lembet and one in Triandria. It should be mentioned that the name for the place Lembet is used for the region around Lagada street, north of the military camp of Pavlos Melas which will later be named Stavroupoli. In 1915 the troops of Endente Cordiale deport in Thessaloniki, the wide area of which will be in the next two years the entrenched military camp and convert with their settlement all the western zone in an immense military camp. The Greek government defines the marshy and fallow land of Zeitenlik as a place of settlement of the allies. With an intermediate limit of Lagada street, the French settled west and around the Lazaristes abbey and the English in the east. The military camp of Pavlos Melas was requisitioned by the Greek government in order to be used by the Greek army. From maps, photos along with film documentaries we have a good picture of the organization of Zeitenlik camp. In the Lazaristes abbey premises there were the military hospitals no 1 and 3, gas depots, post offices, bakery, stables along with a French school which was founded with the initiative of the French general Sarray for the children of the refugees of the neighboring camp of Lembet. The 1917 fire and the efforts of the whole redesign the burnt by fire zone will not only affect the city center but also its immediate perimeter. For the treatment of the fire‚Äìstricken people camps were set up from the military authorities in Karaisin in Polihni and in Kalamaria but before the end of 1917 the fire stricken populations of Kalamaria were moved to Karaisin camp as well. For an extended period of time until after civil war times refugee camps keep being as small peri ‚Äì urban villages. The rural exodus meant the fast expansion of those settlements, since a great number of emigrants settled the region because it provided cheap residence and proximity to the areas of production. Following are, in summary, the most important historical points of interest of the municipality of Pavlos Melas. * ‚ÄúLembet Bank‚Äù (M.U. Stavroupoli): It is a tomb of the late Copper age ‚Äì prime Iron era (2500-950 BC) and 17 redeeming excavations took place on premises, on the top and the slopes of the bank. On the east of the bank and up until the ex military camp of Karatasiou is a cemetery which has been excavated almost completely (20 redeeming excavations) and on which 278 graves have been found dating back to the Archaic and Helenistic period * Neolithic settlement in the area of today's Omonoia (M.U.Stavroupoli): It dates back between 5600 and 4500 BC among the boxed now torrents / streams of Dendropotamos and Platyrematos (Bouboulinas street). In the area approximately 20 private premises have been excavated, without a feasible in situ elevation of the findings. Next to the settlement cemeteries were detected since the Iron period (950-800 BC) and Post Classical times (4th century BC). In opposition to many of the in site findings of Lembet Bank, along with the Neolithic settlement of Omonoia are exhibited on the permanent collections of the Archeological museum of Thessaloniki. * Complex of seven watermills and a wine-press (on the east branch of Dendropotamos) (Xiropotamos): Four of these buildings are of the Byzantine era (before 1430) and the rest date back between the 15th and 19th century. This group is of great importance for the Industrial Archeology of Thessaloniki, since it operated since the Byzantine era until recently and it is protected by the Archeological Law. By the survival of the Byzantine complex and its expansion after 1430 it is inferred that Dendropotamos was superfluous in water and the region had organized cultivations with cottages * Complex of buildings of Lazaristes abbey and the Sisters of Mercy (Terpsithea - Stavroupoli): That particular complex of buildings was constructed by the monks of the order of St. Vincent of Paul and the Sisters of Mercy in 1883-5 and 1885-92 respectively and they put up mainly orphans and children from Bulgary and operated supplementary since the Sisters of Mercy looked after the children until the age of 15 who then moved to the Lazaristes abbey were they learnt some kind of art or studied in order to become part of the clergy. * Military Camp of Pavlos Melas: At around 1895, the Ottoman army, on the grounds of an extended modernizing program, it buys an initial part of landof about 250 hectares. The land is bought by Safiye Hanoun who is the owner of other large stretches on the west side of the town. In 1912 the Greek army will settle at the military camp. From photos of archives of the French military it appears that the grounds were used by the French military allies during the years of 1915-1917. German troops of occupancy will take over the camp in 1940 and use it as a concentration camp.Concentration camp Pavlou Mela The Greek army will come back to re-settle in 1945. In 2003 the Ministry of Culture declared the camp as an Ottoman mosque as preservable shells the two long buildings of barracks and the biggest part of the military camp as a historical place. Since the decade of 1970 the camp ceased to be a base of combatant units, the facilities hypofunctioned up until 2006, the time when the camp was definitely abandoned by the army. According to the current regulatory plan of Thessaloniki, the ex- military camp of Pavlos Melas is destined to operate as a hyperlocal green pole of free spaces sport and cultural facilities with reuse of the most important old important military buildings. * The ex military camp of Karatasiou: It has an area of approximately 689 square kilometres. During that period 1915-1917 the allies had turned all the available peripheral land in an immense military camp the northwest limits of which must have been around the area of today's Karatasiou military camp.  Culture  The municipality of Pavlos Melas presents a significant number of cultural infrastructures, with balanced spatial distribution on all 3 Municipal Unities. Alongside, in the municipality a number of cultural activities takes place. More specifically there are the structures below: Cultural Centers: * Christos Tsakiris Cultural Center * Cultural center of Meteora * Cultural center 'Elpidos' * Cultural center of Efkarpia * Cultural center of Anthokipoi Public Library: * Inside the \\"Christos Tsakiris\\" Cultural Center (14.000 books) * Public Library \\"Theoklitos Karipidis\\" (19.800 books) * Theaters - Public cinemas: * Theater inside the \\"Christos Tsakiris\\" Cultural Center * Theater of \\"Ellis Papanayiotou\\" * Open theater of \\"Kria Vrisi\\" * Open theater of \\"Byzantine Watermills\\" * Open theater of Efkarpia * Summer/ open-air cinema \\"Tzeni Karezi\\" Outdoor cultural demonstration spaces: * Eleftherias square of Ano Ilioupoli * Meteora square \\"Alexander the Great park\\" * Solonos park Furthermore, in the municipality of Pavlos Melas the following art groups take action: * Municipal amateur theatrical group 'Kapnomagazo' * Municipal amateur theatrical group 'Theatrical workshop of Polihni' * Photo club 'Opsis' * Several amateur theatrical groups that function under the supervision of 'Iris' firm The festivals organized in the municipality of Pavlos Melas is: * Educational festival * Byzantine watermills in Polihni festival * Choir meeting 'Plural Harmony' * 'Days of Greek Culture' festival * Meeting of amateur theater companies in the week of Theater every July * Meeting- calling of new artists 'Anakata' * Five-day festivals of meeting traditional dance groups 'Crossroad of tradition' * Five-day music organization entitled 'Iris Music Festival' Last but not least, it should be mentioned that: * In the area the presence of cultural associations is intense (10 in Stavroupoli, 10 in Polihni and 12 in Efkarpia) * Significant cultural activity have many parent and guardian associations of schools of the Municipality * The enterprise of public benefit of the municipality of Pavlos Melas 'Iris' operates a number of schools and cultural workshops like dance, art, multimedia and computer science * In four cultural centers of the municipality operate exhibition spaces of a total area 969 square meters  Sports  Significant is the number of sport facilities recorded in the municipality of Pavlos Melas that holds a great number of sport demonstrations. More specifically as it concerns the sports facilities of the municipality: * the facilities of the municipal unity of Stavroupoli come to 32 * the facilities of the municipal unity of Polihni come to 24 and * the facilities of the municipal unity of Efkarpia come to 22. The above-mentioned facilities include: * 39 football fields, 5x5, volleyball and basketball courts * 4 big athletic centers * 2 closed gyms * 1 gym of heavy sports * 32 halls of multiple uses in schools, halls in Centers of Open Protection of Seniors (KAPI) and cultural centers of the municipality.

This pavilion is available for rental for a variety of events. When not rented, the pavilion is available, at no charge, to all park visitors. It is a popular location for the community. Known as the City of Parks and for its unconventional architecture, it is fitting that Louisville's most popular park is home to the Hogan's Fountain Pavilion, the most prominent landmark in Cherokee Park. Often affectionately referred to by its admiring fans as \\"weird\\" or \\"offbeat\\", the Pavilion's eccentric appearance fits in very well, in a city that prides itself on \\"Keeping Louisville Weird\\". In 1974, the pavilion survived an F4 tornado with minor damage although Cherokee Park was heavily affected, losing over 2,000 mature trees to the twister. After 1994, the Parks Department and the Olmsted Parks Conservancy agreed to, and have set into motion plans for, the eventual demise and removal of the Hogan's Fountain Pavilion stating, \\"...removing the tepee when its natural life span ends.\\"Hogan's Fountain in Cherokee Park Martha Elson.

Geography The Hogan's Fountain Pavilion is located atop Bonnycastle Hill and acts as an architectural centerpiece along the 2.4 mile Scenic Loop in Cherokee Park in Louisville. History Commissioned by the City Director of the Department of Parks and Recreation, George F. Kinkead in 1964, the originally named Hogan's Fountain Pavilion and Comfort Station, which was subsequently shortened to Hogan's Fountain Pavilion project was put out for bids. Fifteen offers were made. The highest was for $72,299. The lowest bid exceeded the $40,000 budget city officials had set aside for the project. The successful bid accepted was from C.G. Campbell & Son, Inc., and they were awarded a contract in the amount of $49,915 with a projected \\"ready for use\\" time of early May 1965.\\"Wigwam Shelter Bid is $49,915\\" Courier-Journal February 10, 1965: B1. In October 1965, Mayor William Cowger dedicated the Pavilion. In a Local Landmark Designation Report prepared by Cynthia Johnson in 2012 for the Metro Historic Landmarks and Preservation Districts Commission, she writes of the pavilions earlier name history \\"‚Ä¶the facility was originally named the McCall Shelter in honor of Alderman C.W. \\"Ches\\" McCall who was killed in an auto accident in 1962. Although the structure was officially named for McCall, the local vernacular continues to refer to the shelter as the \\"Teepee.\\" Architect The Hogan's Fountain Pavilion was originally designed by Edward Jacob (E.J.) Schickli, Jr., of Tafel‚ÄìSchickli Architects. Mr. Schickli felt that a conical \\"wigwam\\" or \\"teepee\\" shaped design was appropriate as it reflected Cherokee Park's Native American-derived name. Born January 1928, Mr. Schickli graduated from MIT in 1950, and became a registered architect in 1954, President of the West Kentucky Chapter of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) in 1961, Designed the Hogan's Fountain Pavilion in 1964, President of the Kentucky Society of Architects in 1965 Achieving all of these prestigious accomplishments before 37 years of age. Other prominent civic contributions by Schickli included the design of the original Louisville Zoo and Botanical Gardens in 1969 and Louisville's Standiford Field Airport expansion project in 1970, currently called the Louisville International Airport. Being an active member of the community and the architecture industry, as late as September 2006, Schickli, then 78, served on the State of Kentucky's Division of Engineering selection committee which oversees architects selected for state funded design projects. Schickli visited his creation in June 2010 for the first time in 15 years and was disappointed by the mentality of what he saw, that of discard the past and start anew. \\"That's the problem with most public and semi-public entities,\\" Schickli said, shaking his head as he looked at the pavilion's deteriorating roof. \\"Money is often appropriated to build them but never to provide maintenance for them. It doesn't matter if it's this or any other structure. It's a mind-set I will never understand.\\" He hopes the pavilion will be around for a while longer. \\"It has a lot of life left in it ‚Ä¶\\" he said. When recently asked by the Courier-Journal about his teepee project, Schickli said he would like to see his project preserved. \\"It's a whimsical structure; the type of thing I believe belongs in parks.\\"Support may be building to preserve park's tepee:$80,000 sought for Cherokee Park pavilion Sheldon S Shafer. Courier - Journal. Louisville, Ky.:January 27, 2011. p. B.1 Structure and development Erecting the pavilion's first structural beams. Because of the shape of the shelter, it garnered a great deal of both media and public attention. \\"It will be a departure from the usual rectangular-shaped shelters built in parks in the past.\\"\\"Cherokee Park to get \\"Wigwam\\" Shelter House\\" Courier-Journal September 13, 1964; E7. So it was that Al Blunk, photographer for the Louisville Times captured an early construction shot of the raising of the oversized laminated wood beams. The Times reported \\"Beams curve skyward, hinting at the shape of things to come ‚Ä¶\\"\\"Cherokee's Teepee-Type Shelter\\" Louisville Times July 26, 1965. =Design= Striking in appearance, the pavilion's atypical, octagonal shaped roof stretches skyward. Designed to be rustic in appearance, the pavilion was intended to have a wood shake shingle roof. However, per a notation by M. Newton on February 5, 1965 onto the original blueprint; he approved the shingle change from shake to that of cement shingles laid over a single layer of 15 lb. asphalt felt.open records request from Metro Parks August 2010 The floor of the pavilion is constructed of a round concrete pad, originally with a large interior circular fire pit surrounded by wooden picnic tables. Above the fire pit is a substantial sized 13 foot diameter smokestack to provide proper venting. The sides of the building were left open to help facilitate cooling by transferring the warm air upward out through an opening at the top. Exiting the top of the covered roof, copper was clad to the exposed structural beams to cap them from the elements. The addition of copper gutter beds and scuppers highlight this unconventional structure. The laminated wood beams are anchored in eight considerable sized concrete buttresses sheathed with native stone from the area. Lastly, a rectangular brick fa√ßade building was attached to the west side of the pavilion that would house the restrooms. The finished teepee structure measures 56 feet wide by 56 feet in height. It is fitting that \\"tipi\\", a variant spelling of \\"teepee\\" translates to [from ti to dwell + pi used for]. This further illustrates the intentionally ambitious Native American design concept Schickli had in mind for this park setting. Surviving the Super Outbreak tornado On April 3, 1974 Louisville experienced unprecedented tornadic activity the likes of which have not been seen since, dubbed \\"The Super Outbreak\\". According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in an article titled, The Super Outbreak: Outbreak of the Century, the authors reported \\"massive devastation, 335 dead . . . more than 6000 injured\\" in the storms. On a local level Tom Wills, Chief Meteorologist for WAVE 3, remembers the tornado, \\"‚Ä¶ we heard reports that Cherokee Park was really devastated. So we sent out this reporter to go and check it out. We hear him back on the two-way radio ‚Ä¶\\" \\"It's Gone!!\\" When asked what's gone? The reporter replied \\"The PARK! IT'S GONE!!!\\" Approximately 2,200 or (75%) of the park's mature tree population was decimated by that F4 tornado. Amongst it all, the Teepee pavilion stood strong on the lumber strewn hill seemingly none the worse for wear save for some missing shingles. Repairs and renovations After the tornado an ad was placed in the Louisville Times on September 30, 1974 requesting bids on repairing the pavilion's roof. Six bids were entertained with the highest being $8,975 and the lowest from Kentucky Lumber Co. who was awarded the contract for $2,110 labor. The materials for the roof consisted of 15 squares of 18\\" x 1/2\\" hand split cedar shake shingles and 160 linear feet of hip shingles at a cost of $652. Work on the roof began on September 18, 1975.Open Record Request from Metro Parks February 25, 2011 In an effort to repair the damaged roof at a cost-savings, Parks Department officials elected to place the wood shake over the existing cement shingles, without removing them, adding yet another obstacle in the saga of the pavilion supporters' restoration efforts. $2,000 was paid on October 6, 1978 to engineers, Rangaswamy, Hatfield and Associates for their professional services rendered in detailing needed structural repairs to damaged support beams. An ad was placed in the Louisville Times Paper on December 4, 1978 requesting bids. So it was that in 1979 structural beams #6 and #7 were encased in steel to strengthen the pavilion's supports for $12,000. What was dubbed, Phase II, of needed pavilion repairs by the Parks Department, engineers Rangaswamy, Yost and Associates were once again contracted for their recommendations. On June 30, 1983 some painting and repairs were made to the smoke hood and flue. The creek stone on the abutments was also tended to for the amount of $850. On July 15, 1983, work began to encase the water damaged beams #1, #3, #5 and #8 in steel at a cost of $16,000. The March 2, 1989 repair drawings explained the process of inserting two rows of ¬æ\\" solid rods 12\\" deep thru the existing beams, plug welding and then grinding smooth, whereas the commencement of encasing beams #2 and #4 with ¬º\\" steel began. Additionally a 90Àö bent ¬º\\" steel plate was welded onto all eight beams to prevent children from climbing onto the roof. Current configuration with ring of grills and tables Activities and amenities Immediately surrounding the pavilion are the following features and facilities: *2.4 mile paved road (one lane for pedestrians, one lane for vehicles) *Children's playground *Full basketball court *Hiking and biking trails *Horseshoe pits *Parking *Restrooms *Softball field *Sprayground *Swings *Volleyball *Water fountains Rentals Metro Parks has a four-tier rental rate for its shelters and pavilions. Ranking on the first-tier is Cherokee Park with the Hogan's Fountain Pavilion being the most popular site within the park, renting for $150 per day. Other tiers within the park system rent respectively for $125, $90 and $35 depending on the size of the shelter and location. The pavilions are available year-round and are free on a first come, first served basis unless otherwise posted as rented for exclusive use. The Hogan's Fountain Pavilion remains cool in the midst of a hot Kentucky summer day insuring that the pavilion is a busy venue in the warmer months with rentals earning in excess of $18,000 a year. Church groups, Scouting troops, Non-Profit organizations, Corporations, wedding parties and families are regular rental patrons of this venue. The Pavilion's 200 seat capacity is a significant factor in its continued popularity. There are eight grills with corresponding extra-large picnic tables affording accommodations for eight individual families under one roof. Additional picnic tables are located adjacent to the pavilion. Parking, restrooms, and a children's playground are all located within easy access. Fall into disrepair Weather damage to pavilion roof as of December 2010 After the issuance of the 1994 Master Plan for the Hogan's Fountain area by Metro Parks and the Olmsted Parks Conservancy, upkeep of the pavilion became nearly nonexistent. The lack of maintenance otherwise known as 'demolition by neglect' took a heavy toll on the pavilion's roof. There had not been any maintenance concerning the wood shingles since 1989; consequently the roof degraded to a very poor condition allowing substantial moisture infiltration by the elements. Additionally, the stone surrounding the buttresses became loosened and was separating from the concrete beneath it. Through an open records request,open records request from Metro Parks August 9, 2010 it was determined that from April 2007 to August 2010, the only repairs performed on the pavilion were to two barbecue grills. The Olmsted Parks Conservancy, not bound by the city's purchasing requirements and guidelines, solicited one bid in August 2009 to repair the pavilion roof. This bid, in the amount of $148,500 was submitted by Merrick-Kemper of Louisville.open records request 2010 from Metro Parks A grassroots group of concerned citizens took it upon themselves to seek out additional bids for the work. Integral Structures of Louisville, reviewed the condition of the roof and agreed to donate a substantial portion of the labor and forego any mark-up on materials for a repair cost of $82,000. The group continues to explore options to further reduce the restoration costs and make the pavilion restoration more financially feasible. Consequently, this is when fundraising began and the formalized group known as Save Hogan's Fountain Pavilion was formed.Pavilion supporters mobilize Courier-Journal. Louisville, KY. July 2, 2010. In November 2011, Commonwealth Roofing gave an estimate of $35,895 to repair the pavilions roof which reflected a donation of the overhead and profit, as well as a portion of the labor. Included were Metro Parks approved high-end dimensioned asphalt shingles that would mimic the current wood shake, but have a longer warranty, require less maintenance, and last longer in the conditions present in the Ohio Valley. Finally, after two years of fundraising along with public and private responsiveness the supporters had raised the necessary funds to repair the Pavilions roof. Equipped with this information the grassroots group approached the Parks Department for a logistics meeting to hash out the details.Meeting between Save Hogan's Fountain Pavilion and Metro Parks Department in March 2012 They were not equipped to deal with the last obstacle the Parks Department had for them. Since the Pavilion is on city property there are procurement regulations that dictate the bidding process. While preparing for this, Metro Parks Department Project Manager, David Wilding was taking photographs of the pavilion when he spotted the shingles and contacted OSHA and requested that they test for asbestos. In what seems to be a tangle of unending hurdles for the pavilion supporters, Joe Irwin, of Louisville Metro OSHA, requested an analysis of the original shingles. On March 9, 2012 QuanTEM Laboratories performed a polarized light microscopy asbestos analysis which reported the shingle sample as having 4% asbestos present. The report goes on to list the shingles as non-friable.Photo of report in Gallery Using this report, the Metro Parks Department has mandated a professional asbestos abatement firm remove the shingles They received a quote from National Environmental Contracting (NEC) on April 9, 2012 in the amount of $28,129, thus raising the price tag to restore the pavilion. Controversy A controversy arose in May 2010, after a public meeting presented by the Louisville Metro Parks Department and the Olmsted Parks Conservancy announced the second Master Plan for the Hogan's Fountain area, including the replacement of the Hogan's Fountain Pavilion. The Plan provided for a number of changes and improvements throughout the Hogan's Fountain area, including the removal of the pavilion and its replacement with two smaller box-like structures. The position taken by Metro Parks is that over usage of the Hogan's Fountain Pavilion and surrounding areas, as stated by John Swintosky, Louisville Metro Parks project director for the Hogan area plan, \\"‚Ä¶area has been degraded as a consequence of people's 'loving a place to death'\\" and \\"‚Ä¶ the towering picnic shelter ‚Ä¶ is now considered the wrong style for the historic park.\\"Restoration, amenities discussed for popular spots\\" Courier - Journal. Louisville, Ky.:March 4, 2009. p. A.5 Margaret Brosko, Metro Parks Communications Manager, says it is cheaper to replace the pavilion than to repair it. Referring to the Olmsted Parks Conservancy's figures for roof repair of approximately $150,000 and Metro Parks figures listed on pg. 33 of the December 2010, Hogan Fountain Area Master Plan, the cost summary for demolition of the teepee shelter and walks with the building of a 25 person shelter at $300,000. This cost does not include the plans for the additional shelter, steps and walkways which are listed at an additional $450,000. The Olmsted Parks Conservancy's primary stated goal is that of the preservation of an 1892 Olmstedian vision. That vision did not include the Hogan's Fountain Pavilion. The Olmsted Parks philosophy of \\"restore, enhance and preserve\\" has gradually implemented removal of elements that are inconsistent with the Olmsted design intent ‚Ä¶\\" Frederick Law Olmsted Sr.'s intent was very clear when he \\"advised the Board of Park Commissioners to resist public demands for golf courses, tennis courts, ball fields, and other forms of active recreation in the large parks.\\" He preferred instead to provide \\"suitable means for making the enjoyment of the scenery of each park available to those escaping from the city, in the form of walks, roads, and places to rest.\\"Louisville's Olmstedian Legacy: An Interpretive Analysis and Documentary Inventory, p. 24 , Louisville Friends of Olmsted Parks, September 1988 However, to date no plans have been made to remove any of these features from Cherokee Park except the pavilion. Further stated by the authors, it is important to consider \\"In attempting to protect the Olmsted legacy, advocates must avoid the pitfalls of elitism and arrogance.\\" Rachel Worley, 2011 President, AIA Central Kentucky Chapter, stated: \\"As the local American Institute of Architects, we recognize the importance of preserving the character and historic fabric of the structures that help define the beautiful Olmstead parks in Louisville. AIA Central Kentucky Chapter has been an advocate for historic preservation and believes that preserving this structure (the Hogan's Fountain Pavilion) would promote that mission. We believe this structure connects the community and will conserve resources by not continuing the deterioration of this existing structure\\". Mimi Zinniel, President and CEO of the Louisville Olmsted Parks Conservancy, has been very vocal in expressing the Olmsted Parks Conservancy's position of replacing the teepee with two separate smaller box- like shelters as specified in the February 2010 Hogan Fountain Master Plan rendering as well as other major changes to the Hogan's Fountain area. Rachel Kennedy, Executive Director, Preservation Kentucky spoke of the pavilion by saying, \\"Its scale, massing, materials, and design features are extremely to the park's setting and in no way detracts from Olmsted's courageous design for Cherokee Park. Just as Olmsted used the natural environment as a key design feature, this piece of modernism responds eloquently to its setting\\". In October 2009, prior to the finalization of the Hogan Fountain Area Master Plan in December 2010, there were two alternate concepts proposed for this location. The first concept included the renovation of the existing pavilion and plans to build a second, smaller shelter to the south side of the Hogan's Fountain area. The idea being that the big shelter could be reserved for larger functions, with the smaller one available simultaneously for family picnics or smaller events. The second concept showed the removal of the existing pavilion and its replacement, along with the plans for the additional smaller shelter to the south side of the Hogan's Fountain area.Cherokee Park work eyed:Officials consider improvements Sheldon S Shafer. Courier - Journal. Louisville, Ky.:October 24, 2009. p. B.1 In October 2009, Concept #1 of the Master Plan solved most concerns the Metro Parks had for the Hogan's Fountain area, but this option has been eliminated via the 2010 final Master Plan. Renderings of this failed option can be seen on the Louisville Metro Parks website. Preservation efforts In March 2010, Louisville resident Lark Phillips led a number of concerned citizens interested in preserving and restoring the Hogan's Fountain Pavilion to form the Save Hogan's Fountain Pavilion group in hopes of saving this unusual architectural structure from demolition. Meetings between the preservation group and Metro Parks Department Director, Mike Heitz, resulted in the temporary delay of any removal or replacement of the pavilion, if private funds can be raised to repair the iconic structure. To the defense of the pavilion, Devin Colman, President, Recent Past Preservation Network wrote: \\"This type of revisionist history (demolishing and replacing) will result in the loss of a legitimately historic structure and the construction of a new building that is supposed to look old. Ultimately, such actions degrade the overall historic integrity of Cherokee Park while ignoring the fact that cultural landscapes change over time.\\" Colman also pointed out that the Parks Department proposition was directly in violation of the U.S. Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation, specifically Standards #3 and #4 which read: =Fundraising= Fundraising to save the pavilion began after receipt of Integral Structures' $82,000 roof repair bid. So it began that the Save Hogan's Fountain Pavilion group and Adam Matthews Foundation, a non-profit (501c3) organization, partnered as a fundraising vehicle to begin the restoration process.Tepee is tops to supporters:Cherokee Park Martha Elson. Courier - Journal. Louisville, Ky.:July 7, 2010. p. A.4 The Adam Matthews Foundation has also matched donations in the amount of $1500 towards the preservation efforts. The group's first fundraiser was a concert at Headliner's Music Hall in August 2010. Another one was held in December 2010, at Just Creations, a company that works directly with artisans and farmers to ensure that Fair Trade principles are practiced. They collected $146 at the monthly Community Shopping Night for Not-For-Profits that allows them 10% of profits raised during the event. Hogan's Fountain Pavilion supporters participated in the 2010 on-line competition \\"We Hear You America\\", sponsored by Reader's Digest Magazine. They 'cheered' daily voting for their hometown's civic projects. In Louisville, repairing the Hogan's Fountain Pavilion was the overwhelming favorite of the voters. They were awarded two checks for their efforts; the first $1,000 was for being selected as one of the Best 100 Cities in America, based on participation in the contest. The second $10,000 was for being runner up in a winning city with a population of 500,000 or more residents.Cherokee pavilion project gets $10,000 magazine grant Courier - Journal.

This award triggered a $5,000 challenge grant from Louisville Metro Councilwoman, Tina Ward-Pugh, D-9th District.Effort to save Cherokee Park pavilion gets $10,000 grant; Supporters need Courier - Journal. Louisville, Ky.: February 19, 2011. p. B.1 There has been various financial support from political figures, neighborhood associations, corporate and individuals starting with Councilwoman, Tina Ward-Pugh, who was the first politician to make a pledge towards the restoration of the Pavilion with an initial $5,000 challenge grant and a subsequent $5,000 matching grant. In addition, Tom Owen, Louisville Metro Councilman, D-8th District, who made a pledge to fund the last $3,800 of the cost to re-roof the Pavilion and who recently made an additional pledge of $1,000 . Neighborhood associations surrounding Cherokee Park and the Pavilion have been generous and vocal with their support. The Belknap Neighborhood Association in April 2011 donated $250 stating, \\"The Tee Pee is a symbol of resilience. Its survival as a beacon of hope following the 1974 tornado is well documented in the hearts and minds of the public.\\" Later they made another donation of $400. Likewise, the Highland Douglass Neighborhood Association (HDNA) has donated twice; the first time in June 2011 in the amount of $300 and again in August 2012, donating an additional $500. Andrew J. Douds, President, HDNA, writes \\"‚Ä¶we believe that architecture gives meaning to the community and when threatened, alternative solutions and public opinion must be considered before change occurs that would alter what is familiar and necessary to the community.\\" Additional donations have been made by Deer Park Neighborhood Association who contributed $300, as well as the Bonnycastle Homestead Association delivering $150 in June 2011. Raising awareness and gathering local support. Local bands and concerts have attracted support and funds alike. The band \\"Hogan's Fountain\\" donated 50% of profits (during February and March 2011) for iTunes sales of their song \\"Shine Your Light on Me - Remix\\". Several volunteers of the grassroots group have manned booths at various local festivals spreading the message and raising awareness within the community, in conjunction with collecting donations. One successful fundraising method used by the group has been selling T-shirts. T-shirt sales have been so popular that the brown 2010 and the purple 2011 versions have sold out. The group also undertook a small letter writing campaign to notify organizations who had patronized the pavilion that they were working to save it and asking for donations and or support. One such letter produced a $1,000 donation from YUM Brands. The local community has rallied together coming up with creative ideas for fundraising. One such event was held by O'Shea's Family of Pubs on what they call Fund Day, in which 100% of the net profits from all food and drink at O'Shea's Pub and Flanagan's Ale House were designated to benefit the Hogan's Fountain Pavilion. In June 2011 they presented a check totaling $2,500 to the grassroots group. On Facebook, an event titled the Louisville Hippie's Reunion/Benefit Hogans Fountain TeePee was held on August 5, 2012 at Stevie Ray's Blues Bar in downtown Louisville. Several bands donated their time and talent for the cause as well as the receipt of several donated handmade items. Proceeds from the event netted the pavilion group $1,700 towards its much needed repairs. Additionally, the pavilions architect was present and gave a speech in which when asked \\"How long did you think the structure would stand?\\" Answered \\"Well, my body at almost 85 years of age, it's stood along time, but I've had maintenance; and if I had so little maintenance as that structure I would have been gone long ago.\\" Speech given at Stevie Ray's Blues Bar on August 5, 2012 In honor of their father, the sons of Mr. Schickli, have respectfully donated $5,000 and allocated a $5,000 dollar for dollar matching grant beginning in September 2011 that was met eagerly. Upon completion they donated an addition $500. As of August 2012 the Save Hogan's Fountain Pavilion group has raised over $45,000 towards its goal to repair the roof of the pavilion. =Opponents= As of March 2011, the Louisville Metro Parks Department and the Olmsted Parks Conservancy, through various public meetings, newspaper articles and television interviews, have expressed opposition to the restoration and preservation of the Pavilion. \\"Whenever possible, and when funds permit, structures should be renovated or replaced in a manner that's consistent with Olmsted's design philosophy. In the case of the Hogan's Fountain teepee, we believe that it is out of character with this Olmsted Park, and the community would be best served with a new shelter.\\" Margaret Brosko said on behalf of Metro Parks and the conservancy, which raises money to support projects in the Olmsted Parks.Support may be building to preserve Cherokee Park pavilion Sheldon S Shafer. Courier - Journal. Louisville, Ky.:January 26, 2011. Mimi Zinniel, President and CEO of the Louisville Olmsted Parks Conservancy says, \\"Its design, its structure, its size and its location really invites a lot of concentrated use and that can cause things like erosion, soil compaction and damage to nearby historic trees\\". =Supporters= \\"It's important to preserve significant architecture that makes Louisville unique.\\" said Tammy Madigan, a spokeswoman for the teepee supporters. The Courier-Journal reported that \\"Over the past year, the effort to protect the pavilion has drawn support from the Kentucky Heritage Council, Preservation Kentucky, Preservation Louisville, Louisville Historical League, the Southern Regional Office of the National Trust for Historic Preservation ‚Ä¶\\" among others. The Hogan's Fountain Pavilion recently received a letter from Richard Guy Wilson, Commonwealth Professor, Architectural History, University of Virginia and noted author. Wilson is also a commentator on the History Channel's \\"America's Castles.\\" In his recommendation to nominate the Hogan's Fountain Pavilion as one of \\"America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places\\" to the National Trust for Historic Preservation he wrote: \\"This vision of the American past as a sanitized place in which nothing ever changes is not very smart, especially when you have such an outstanding design as Hogan's Pavilion.\\" \\"Here, the community supports saving this structure and it would be an unfortunate irony if it were to be razed.\\" says, Steve Wiser, President, Louisville Historical League. From Marianne Zickuhr, Executive Director with Preservation Louisville, \\"We recognize that the Hogan's Fountain Teepee is an important part of the Highlands area and plays a role in its cultural history.\\" Dr. Daniel Vivian, Assistant Professor and Director, Public History Program, University of Louisville spoke of \\"‚Ä¶the need for sympathetic care and stewardship‚Ä¶\\" for the pavilion. He summed up by saying, \\"‚Ä¶the pavilion is a locally important example of midcentury recreational architecture. Its design represents an innovative, highly distinctive union of modernist influences and traditional modes of park architecture.\\" Mark Dennen, Executive Director and State Historic Preservation Officer for the Kentucky Heritage Council said, \\"It is my opinion that the Pavilion is a fine example of modernist architecture and worthy of protection. Not only has the Pavilion become an icon in Cherokee Park, but it has proven to be a focal point for gatherings since it was constructed. The loss of this structure would be a sad loss for Louisville.\\" In September 2011, the citizens of Louisville voted in the Annual LEO Reader's Choice Awards. The Hogan's Fountain Pavilion garnered number one in Best Local Landmark and the grassroots group, Save Hogan's Fountain Pavilion, ranked number two in the Best Nonprofit category. One of the groups Co-Chairs, Lark Phillips, was awarded Best Community Role Model. Once again in September 2012, the Hogan's Fountain Pavilion was voted among the top Louisville Landmarks and Beth Hafling of Save Hogan's Fountain Pavilion group was voted Best Community Role Model in the Annual LEO Reader's Choice Awards. On October 14, 2011, Rachel Kennedy, Director of Preservation Kentucky, announced that the Hogan's Fountain Pavilion had been placed on its 2011 ‚Äì 2012 Most Endangered Historic Places in Kentucky List. E.J. Schickli, Jr., was present for the designation and spoke about his creation. =Landmarking= In an effort to preserve the Pavilion after its restoration the grassroots group gathered over 400 signatures via a petition and submitted them along with a $500 fee with the application to the Historic Landmarks and Preservation Districts Commission early August 2011. More than a year after submitting their application to the Landmarks Commission, a Historic Landmarks Designation Hearing was held on September 24, 2012. On the agenda was case #18003, the Pavilion. As referenced on the Louisvilleky.gov website \\"The purpose of the public hearing will be to receive testimony and to consider the question of local landmark designation for the Hogan's Fountain Pavilion...\\". Included in the proceedings was a 29-page Landmark Designation Report drafted and submitted by Cynthia Johnson, Preservation Officer, Historic Landmarks and Preservation Districts Commission. After four and a half hours of contentious testimony the hearing concluded with Hogan's Fountain Pavilion being designated with official individual Local Landmark status. The Commission voted five yay, zero nay, with two abstentions. As with most architecture, the Hogan's Fountain Pavilion in Cherokee Park is many things to many people. Still today, this celebrated structure is capturing the attention of architects, historians, preservationists and educators.

The 34 members of the class were built by Beyer, Peacock & Co. in Manchester, England, for the East African Railways (EAR). They entered service in 1955‚Äì56, and were the largest, heaviest and most powerful steam locomotives to operate on any metre gauge railway in the world. Description The locomotives had a wheel arrangement, weighed 252 tons, and delivered a tractive effort of . They were designed to haul 1,200-ton trains on 1.5% gradients and were the mainstay of freight services on the 330-mile run from Mombasa to Nairobi until the late 1970s. During normal service the locomotives were manned by two regular crews on a 'caboose' basis, one working and one resting in a van with sleeping accommodation, changing over at eight-hour intervals. The engines, many with Sikh drivers, were kept very clean and the cabs were polished and immaculate. The most famous was 5918 Mount Gelai with a devoted crew known as the 'Magnificent Foursome' who worked her for 16 years. The two drivers, Kirpal Singh and Walter Pinto, simply took their holidays when the locomotive went into the works at Nairobi for scheduled maintenance. According to railway photographer Colin Garratt (in 1975), 'the overall condition of Mount Gelai is possibly unrivalled anywhere in the world today. Her cab interior is more akin to a Sikh temple than a locomotive footplate for its boiler face abounds in polished brasswork, embellished with mirrors, clocks, silver buckets and a linoleum floor'. Withdrawal started in 1973 with the last locomotive (Mount Gelai) removed from service in April 1980 when it was driven by its long time driver, Kirpal Singh directly to the railway museum. Mr Singh retired from railway service the same day. Together with Mount Gelai, Mount Shengena was also saved from the scrapyard and both are now preserved by the Nairobi Railway Museum. In August 2001 Mount Gelai was removed from the Railway Museum and towed to Kenya Railways main works for overhaul to operating condition. Between November 2001 and September 2005 the locomotive made three round trips to Mombasa hauling excursion trains. It was also used on a least one occasion to haul a freight train to Nairobi due to a diesel locomotive shortage. However, it has not operated outside the confines of Nairobi since 2005 and is unlikely to do so again due to operational restrictions and the at least partial replacement of Kenya's meter gauge () rail lines with standard gauge () lines.

In his acclaimed 1600 treatise On the Magnet and Magnetick Bodies, and on That Great Magnet the Earth, William Gilbert distinguished two kinds of verticity. Surface verticity is the tendency to point north found in ordinary \\"loadstones\\" and magnetised iron. This verticity was the weaker expression of a more powerful kind of verticity: the deep verticity in the Earth's core. Gilbert was among the first to believe that the Earth spins. It spins, he says, because of its deep verticity. In his judgement, deep verticity also explained surface verticity: over time, bits and pieces of matter escaped from Earth's core, their verticity having been corrupted and weakened by exposure to the degraded matter of Earth's crust. These bits of matter became the variety of weak magnets found nearer the Earth's surface. Gilbert's theory of magnetism did not persuade Francis Bacon. For him, the Earth did not spin, and it had no deep verticity or magnetism. Its core was cold, passive, and unmoving, as Telesio had said. Bacon explained ordinary magnets in a different way. Their motion was westward motion around Earth's vertices. Such motion could be found everywhere. The Atlantic Ocean rolled westward and ricocheted off the eastern coast of the New World, creating the tides. The planets, stars, sun and moon too migrated westward. The stirrings of magnets could not be blamed on a special force, but only on the impulse of nearly all things to go west.

She is best known for her novel, This Day and Time, an account of life in a rural Appalachian community. She was also a pioneering woman in business management, and was the first woman to lecture before the Harvard School of Business and Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business in the early 1920s.Robert Higgs, \\"Anne Armstrong,\\" An Encyclopedia of East Tennessee (Oak Ridge, Tenn.: Children's Museum of Oak Ridge, 1981), p. 36. Biography Armstrong was born Anne Audubon Wetzell in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in 1872. In the 1880s, her family moved to Knoxville, Tennessee, where her father operated a lumber company. She attended Mount Holyoke College, where she wrote for the school's newspaper,Joanne Wagner, \\"Intelligent Members or Restless Disturbers: Women's Rhetorical Styles, 1880-1920,\\" Reclaiming Rhetorica: Women in the Rhetorical Tradition (Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1995), p. 185. and later attended the University of Chicago. She had returned to Knoxville by 1892, when she married Leonard T. Waldron. They had one son before divorcing in 1894. In 1905, she married Robert F. Armstrong. Armstrong published her first novel, The Seas of God, in 1915. In 1918, she was hired as a personnel director for the National City Company of New York. She later gave an account of her early days with this company in her article, \\"A Woman in Wall Street by One,\\" which was published in The Atlantic Monthly in 1925.Anne Armstrong, \\"A Woman in Wall Street by One,\\" The Atlantic Monthly, Vol. 136 (August 1925), pp. 145-158. In 1919, Armstrong was hired as the Assistant Manager for Industrial Relations for Eastman Kodak, and continued in this position until 1923. During the latter half of the decade, she published several articles in Harper's Monthly and The Atlantic Monthly that focused on the emerging role of women in business.David McClellan, \\"A Note on the Life and Works of Anne W. Armstrong,\\" Introduction to This Day and Time (Johnson City, Tenn.: East Tennessee State University, 1970), pp. ix-x. In the late 1920s, Armstrong retired and moved to the Big Creek community in rural Sullivan County, Tennessee, which would provide the inspiration for her 1930 novel, This Day and Time. During this same period, she began a correspondence with author Thomas Wolfe, and began writing her autobiography, Of Time and Knoxville, a portion of which was published as \\"The Branner House\\" in The Yale Review in 1938. Three of Wolfe's letters to Armstrong were published in the 1956 collection, The Letters of Thomas Wolfe. In the 1940s, the Tennessee Valley Authority completed South Holston Dam, effectively inundating the Big Creek community, which straddled the South Fork Holston just upstream from the dam. Armstrong moved to various places around the Southeast before settling in Abingdon, Virginia. She lived in the Barter Inn in Abingdon until her death in 1958. Writing Armstrong's first novel, The Seas of God, tells the story of a young woman, Lydia Lambright, and her struggles to survive as an unwed mother amidst the moral constraints of Victorian society. The story opens in Kingsville, a fictional Southern town (based on Knoxville) where Lydia's dying father, a professor, has been ostracized for teaching the Theory of Evolution.Anne Armstrong, The Seas of God (New York: Hearst's International Library, 1915), pp. 6-7. Bitter over her father's treatment, she leaves Kingsville, and eventually winds up in New York. An illicit affair with a married man leaves her pregnant, and she gradually sinks into poverty. Unable to find gainful employment, she becomes a prostitute, and while her financial situation drastically improves, she struggles with what she deems a pointless existence.The Seas of God, pp. 280-289, e.g. Armstrong's second novel, This Day and Time, takes place in an early 20th-century rural Appalachian community based primarily on the Big Creek area of Sullivan County, Tennessee. The story focuses on Ivy, a mountain woman who returns to a life of subsistence farming after spending several distasteful years as a wage-earner in a nearby city. Armstrong's characters speak in a local Appalachian dialect, and the book discusses many aspects of life in early-20th century rural Appalachia, including funerary and agricultural customs, and life in a logging town.Anne Armstrong, This Day and Time (Johnson City, Tenn.: East Tennessee State University, 1970), Chapters 2 and 4; Chapter 8. Armstrong's business writings typically focused on the status of women in the business world. Her 1927 article, \\"Are Business Women Getting a Square Deal,\\" traces the gradual acceptance of women in the workplace, from the 1880s through the post-World War period.Anne Armstrong, \\"Are Business Women Getting a Square Deal?\\" The Atlantic Monthly, Vol. 40 (July 1927), pp. 28-36. In the 1928 article, \\"Have Women Changed Business,\\" Armstrong complains that businesswomen have failed to make business more ethical, falling short of goals set forth by women's movement leaders such as Nellie Ross.Anne Armstrong, \\"Have Women Changed Business?\\" Harper's Monthly, Vol. 158 (December 1928), pp. 10-16. In \\"Seven Deadly Sins of Women in Business,\\" she advises women not to try to imitate men in dress and manners, but instead focus on what their feminine nature can bring to the workplace.Anne Armstrong, \\"Seven Deadly Sins of Women in Business,\\" Harper's Monthly, Vol. 153 (August 1926), pp. 295-303.

It was built in the 18th century by Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma (1729‚Äì1758 AD), the Travancore kingdom. It is built in the architectural style of Kerala with gabled roof, narrow corridor and dormer windows, near the Krishnaswamy Temple at Krishnapuram.: File:Gajendramoksham.jpg: Official plaque at the Palace Complex The palace is maintained by the Kerala State Department of Archaeology and contains exhibits that belonged to the Palace and its former occupant, the Travancore Maharaja Marthanda Varma. It is also famous for a large pond within the palace complex. It is also said that an underground escape route runs from the bottom of the pond as a possible escape route from enemies. Among the many Kerala-style paintings seen in the palace, a distinctly placed mural painting is titled \\"Gajendra Moksham\\" of size, which is said to be the largest such find in Kerala. It is placed on the western end of the ground floor of the palace. The double edged Kayamkulam Vaal (sword) is also on display here. The palace houses, in its courtyard, one of the four statues of Buddha found in Alappuzha District. Geography The Krishnapuram Palace named after the Krishnaswamy Temple at Krishnapuram, a serene village, is situated about south of Kayamkulam town... It is situated on the top of a small hillock encircled by terraced garden with fountains, ponds and lawns. Its location is to the left of the National Highway 66 (India) (NH 66) between Ochira and Kayamkulam in the Alapuzha District. It is away from Allepey (Alappuzha district) on the way to Kollam. History The palace was built by King Marthanda Varma of Travancore after defeating and annexing Odanad in the Odanad‚ÄìTravancore War of 1746. Before the construction of the palace, the King demolished an earlier palace at the site, which had been built by the King Veera Ravi Varma of Odanad (reign 1700‚Äì1775 AD). Initially, a small palace of a single story, known locally as Ettukettu, was built in the traditional style with an adjacent pond, temple and urappura under the management of Prime Minister Ramayyan Dalawa, which was later enlarged by Prime Minister Ayyappan Marthanada Pillai. The palace complex has many other buildings, which are a combination of traditional and Western architecture. The present building, a three-storied structure within the complex, was renovated in the 1950s by the Archaeological Department of Kerala in modern style conforming to the scientific techniques prescribed for the protection of heritage buildings. As a protected monument, it houses the Archaeological Museum and its offices. Architecture The Krishnapuram Palace, as one of the finest and rarest examples of a typical Keralite-style architecture, known in the local language as Pathinarukettu, is complete with gabled roofs, narrow corridors and dormer windows. It is a miniature replica of Padmanabhapuram Palace, which was the headquarters of Travancore Rajas. The palace complex originally encompassed a total land area of . However, over the years, as the monarchic rule ended, the palace was completely neglected and fell to disuse, and was dilapidated. Many of the buildings surrounding the main palace of the Maharaja got demolished or destroyed and the palace complex got reduced to a mere enclosed within a high compound wall. The main palace, which was run down, was rebuilt to its original state as a three storied monument by the Archaeological Department of Kerala in the 1950s. The rare documents and artefacts which were kept at other locations were brought back, restored and eventually exhibited in the palace that has been converted into a Museum. The palace restored to its originally built plans, conforming to Vastu Shastra norms, has 16 blocks or Kettus with four Nadumuttam or open area in the centre or courtyards. The windows, doors and ventilators were placed in such a way as to ensure fresh air circulation and natural lighting in all the rooms. There are 22 rooms (which open into the shady internal courtyards) with ornamental wooden partitions with carvings. Additional openings were provided to prevent any negative effects of \\"Murmavedham.\\" (Secret effects). The building is set with verandas (passages) all round to protect the outer walls getting damaged due to rains. The materials used in its construction consisted of laterite stones, rubble, teak, rosewood and Angili wood. Roofing (red-tiled gabled) is steep and tiled with Mangalore tiles, which accentuates the beauty of the structure. A special feature of the carpentry adopted in building the palace consisted of wooden hinges and locks for doors and windows, instead of metallic fittings and fixtures. The flooring consists of polished wood and also of black and red oxide-coated concrete. The steps are made of polished granite blocks. Aesthetic beauty of the palace has been further enhanced by the special designs of straight, curved and spiral staircases and sunshades. A small stream was created to flow close to the southern vicinity of the palace which also functioned as a secret escape route in times of emergency. An underground tank or pond that stretches to the centre of the building was part of the palace; it provided air-conditioning effect of moderate temperature in all interior rooms. The palace compound has many Padippuras, particularly at the main entrance, which are significators of status. Collection The palace complex, which now functions as an archaeological museum, is a treasure house of ancient paintings and inscriptions, coins, megalithic remains, artefacts made of wood, brass and stone sculptures. Some of the prominent displays in the complex are: The mural of Gajendra Moksham, Kayamkulam Val (sword), Buddha's statue of the 10th century and ceremonial utensils and many other artefacts. ;Gajendra Moksham Mural of Gajendra Moksham. Within the palace is the archaeological museum which has an exhibit of the Gajendra Moksham a high mural, which is the largest single piece of mural painting so far discovered in Kerala. The literal meaning of 'Gajendra Moksham' is the \\"salvation or Moksha of the elephant king Gajendra.\\" The theme of the mural is mythological and depicts an elephant saluting Lord Vishnu in devotion while the other minor Gods, Goddesses and saints look on. Lord Vishnu was the family deity of the Kayamkulam Kings. This mural, in a fusion of colours and expressions, was placed prominently at the entrance to the palace from the pond to enable the kings to worship the deity after their daily ablutions. The mythological legend narrated on the Gajendra Moksham (Gajendra means the King of elephants) is contained in the 10th century Sanskrit Bhagavata Purana. According to this legend, the Pandyan King Indradyumna, a devotee of Lord Vishnu, was given a curse by the sage Agastya, to be reborn as an elephant. Gajendra or the Elephant King, while on a pleasure trip to a lake with his wives, was seized by a crocodile that caught hold of his leg with a firm grip and thus Gajendra was held captive for many years. Finally the hapless Gajendra appealed to Lord Vishnu, his chosen deity, to rescue him from his predicament. Vishnu made his presence soon after, riding on his Vahana (vehicle), the Garuda (the celestial half man half bird form). Garuda killed the crocodile. The entire sequence is vividly painted, with vegetable colours, on the mural with a dynamic portrayal of Garuda at the centre, about to land with \\"huge spread wings and a facial expression raudra (form of fury), in stark contrast to the compassionate features of the multi-armed Vishnu\\". The mural also shows a smaller figure of Gajendra in mid-trumpet, and of the crocodile on the right side. The mural truly represents the Kerala style of painting on every available space on it. Apart from the main characters of the legend, saints, animals, mythical beasts and forest plants are also depicted. The outer edges of the mural are decorated with Floriate borders. At the bottom, there is an exclusive \\"triptych-like panel which depicts Balakrishna, the child Krishna surrounded by doting females. ;Kayamkulam Vaal (Sword) The Double edged sword ‚Äì Kayamkulam Val The Kayamkulam Vaal ('Vaal' means \\"sword\\") is an important exhibit in the museum. The significance of the sword is that its both sides are sharpened and thus it is more dangerous than any other martial weapon. It is said to have been used by the Kayamkulam Rajas in the 18th century and hence was of special attraction to the king. ;Buddha mandapam (hall) Buddha mandapam (hall) is where an attractive statue of one of the four antique Buddhas of the 10th century, which were recovered in recent times in ponds and fields in Alappuzha district is displayed. The Buddha mandapam (Buddha statue installed here predates the building of the palace) is located in the finely landscaped and tended garden with profusion of flower plants (endemic to Kerala) that surrounds the palace complex. The four Buddha statues found in recent years in the Alappuzha district testify the prevalence of Hinayana Buddhism in Onanadu in the Maveli kingdom of Kerala several. The four Buddha images are in meditating posture with Ushnisha (cap) and Upavita (upper garment). These had been thrown into fields and ponds during the anti-Buddhism campaign in Kerala. The idol was found in a pool or tank called Puthenkula (Pond of Buddha) in Maruturkulangara in Karunagappalli. This idol, cut out of a single piece of rock, was first installed in Karunagappalli town and after many years reinstalled in the compound of Krishnapuram Palace which is now a monument in the Buddha Mantapam. This idol has a skull cap adorned with lines of pearls or diamonds that represents the highest wisdom attained by Buddha. Scholars have inferred that this statue probably belongs to the 7th century or even 5th century. ;Other exhibits Bible in Sanskrit language printed in Calcutta (Kolkata) in 1886, kept in the Palace museum The museum in the Krishnapuram Palace also has a copy of the Bible in Sanskrit printed in Calcutta (Kolkata) in 1886. Ceremonial utensils are also on display in a display case, which consists of oil lamps, fine miniature figures, and small stone columns carved with serpent deities (collected from various local houses). Some of these are arranged in an arc form known as prabhu and placed behind a temple deity to provide a \\"hallow of light\\". Fine miniature Panchaloha (five metals of bronze alloy with gold also as an ingredient) figures on display are of the Varuna (water god), many Vishnus and a minuscule devotee in worship mode.

The collaboration is planning, building and operating a series of liquid argon time projection chambers (TPCs) that are employed at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Assergi, Italy. The detectors are filled with liquid argon from underground sources in order to exclude the radioactive isotope , which makes up one in every 1015 (quadrillion) atoms in atmospheric argon. The Darkside-10 (DS-10) prototype was tested in 2012, and the Darkside-50 (DS-50) experiment has been operating since 2013. Darkside-20k (DS-20k) with 20 tonnes of liquid argon is being planned as of 2019.  Darkside-10  The Darkside-10 prototype detector had 10kg of liquid argon. It was built at Princeton University and operated there for seven months, after which it was transported to Gran Sasso National Laboratory in 2011. The detector operated in Gran Sasso 2011-2012.  Status  Darkside-50 has 46 kg argon target mass. A 3-year run is planned and ton- scale expansion has been proposed. Initial results using a month of running were reported in 2014.

Smith is an African-American actor, writer and political candidate. Blakk first garnered a measure of national attention when he ran for president of the United States in 1992. Calling himself a blend of Divine, David Bowie and Grace Jones, Smith began performing in 1974. In 1991, Smith, as Blakk, ran against Richard M. Daley for the office of mayor of Chicago, Illinois.Meyer, pp. 5-6 The campaign was chronicled in the 1991 video Drag in for Votes. Smith's next campaign was for the presidency in 1992 under the slogan \\"Lick Bush in '92!\\" and documented in the 1993 video of the same name. Smith also ran for president in 1996 with the slogan \\"Lick Slick Willie in '96!\\" In each of these campaigns Smith ran on the Queer Nation Party ticket.Glasrud, p. 13 Following the 1992 campaign, Smith moved to San Francisco, California and joined the African-American stage comedy troupe Pomo Afro Homos. He launched his talk show Late Nite with Joan Jett Blakk at Kiki Gallery under the production of Rick Jacobsen, and featuring Stephen Mounce as co-hostess Babette. The talk show featured local and national persons of interest in the LGBTQ community. It became so successful it was moved to a larger venue to accommodate the sold out crowds. In 1999, Smith, again as Blakk, announced his intention to run for mayor of San Francisco against incumbent Willie Brown. In June 2019, a play based on Smith's 1992 presidential campaign, titled Ms. Blakk for President, written by Tarell Alvin McCraney and Tina Landau and starring McCraney in the title role, opened at Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago.

Etymology  The name is probably derived from Au√üer dem Fern (\\"beyond the Fern\\" where Fern is the Fern Pass).Finsterwalder, K. (1995): Die Ortsnamen im Au√üerfern. ‚Äì In: √ñlberg, H. M. & Grass, N.: Tiroler Ortsnamenkunde ‚Äì Gesammelte Aufs√§tze und Arbeiten 3. ‚Äì S. 1197-1210; Innsbruck (Wagner). Au√üer- (\\"outer\\") and Inner- (\\"inner\\") in the Tyrolese dialect are common prefixes to the name of a valley and distinguish the mouth of the valley from its upper reaches, or the section of a valley downstream of its main settlement from the upstream regions, or simply the directions into and out of the valley. Au√üerfern may possible refer, therefore, to the valley up to the historic climb to the Fern Pass.  History  The region was settled from the 10th century along the Via Claudia Augusta by Alamanni. At the end of the 13th century it became part of the County of Tyrol through the imperial agreement (Reichseinigung) of Duke Meinhard, however the Au√üerfern's close economic and cultural relationships with the Allg√§u region remained. For example, the Au√üerfern was for a long time placed ecclesiastically under the Bishopric of Augsburg. This was aided by good transportation links to the Allg√§u and to Upper Bavaria, whilst there was only one link to the Inn valley usable in winter, namely the Fern Pass.  Linguistic unit  Linguistically the region is dominated by a mixed form of the Alemannic and Austro-Bavarian dialects. The regions settled by Upper Bavaria and from the Inn valley, such as the Ehrwald Basin and the tributary valleys of the Lech have similarities with the dialects of the Upper Inn Valley, whilst in the region around Reutte and in the Tannheim valley, a Swabian-Alemannic dialect dominates.  NUTS division: AT331  In the NUTS division for official statistics collected by the EU the Au√üerfern is one of the five groups of districts (level NUTS:AT-2) in Tyrol, bears the code \`AT331\` and covers the administrative district of Reutte.  The region today  Today the term is used particularly in the Regional Development of Au√üerfern ‚Äì the region is part of the Euroregions Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino, EUREGIO via salina and Zugspitze-Wetterstein-Karwendel. Tourism is an important source of income, because the rather barren and high terrain is difficult to cultivate. In addition, industry and trade play a role, especially in the central Lech valley and the Reutte Basin. The Tyrolean Lech Valley Nature Park and the river Lech, one of the last natural rivers in Europe, together with the multitude of sporting facilities are the basis for tourism in the Au√üerfern. The main link into the rest of Tyrol is over the Fern Pass. The region is linked from the German railway network by the Au√üerfern Railway.  References   Sources  * Fuchs, F.

It is the ninth consecutive season of play in the Scottish Premier League in which Hearts have competed since its inauguration in 1998‚Äì99. Hearts also competed in the Champions League, Uefa Cup, Scottish Cup and Scottish League Cup. Managers Valdas Ivanauskas was confirmed as head coach on a permanent basis during the summer of 2006 following the Scottish Cup victory. Following an inconsistent start to their League campaign, head coach Valdas Ivanauskas took a sabbatical from his role on 23 October. Eduard Malofeev was appointed interim head coach until Valdas Ivanauskas later in the season although he only resumed the role for a short time before becoming director of football once again an interim head couch was required and previous director of football Anatoly Korobochka took charge of the team.

A combination of Tynecastle falling short of UEFA requirements in terms of pitch size and hospitality facilities, and Murrayfield's greater capacity, meant that Murrayfield was the preferred choice for the Tynecastle board. Hearts won their second round qualifying tie against Bosnian champions ≈†iroki Brijeg 3‚Äì0 on aggregate, but were defeated 5‚Äì1 on aggregate by AEK Athens in the final qualifying round. The Greek side won 2‚Äì1 at Murrayfield due to two late goals and then won 3‚Äì0 in the Athens Olympic Stadium. Hearts had one player (Bruno Aguiar) sent off in the first leg and two players (Julien Brellier and Neil McCann) sent off in the second leg. =Uefa Cup= The loss in the final qualifying round meant that Hearts dropped into the UEFA Cup first round against Sparta Prague. In this competition they lost 2‚Äì0 at a muddy Murrayfield in the first leg and they were eliminated after a 0‚Äì0 draw in Prague in the return leg on 28 September 2006. =League Cup= =Scottish Cup= =Scottish Premier League= Following an indifferent start to their League campaign, head coach Valdas Ivanauskas took a sabbatical from his role on 23 October. Club owner Vladimir Romanov, who stated \\"I have full confidence in Valdas and look forward to his return\\", appointed the club's sporting director, Eduard Malofeev, as interim head coach. Further off-field disruption ensued four days later when Romanov warned his players that they would all be put up for sale if Hearts did not win their match against Dunfermline Athletic the next day. Captain Steven Pressley, flanked by senior players Paul Hartley and Craig Gordon, responded with a statement voicing the players' unhappiness at affairs at the club, stating in a pre-match media conference ahead of Dunfermline's visit that there was \\"significant unrest\\" in the dressing-room. The game was drawn 1‚Äì1. The repercussions from the press conference stretched over several months and eventually led to the departure from the club of two of the so-called Riccarton Three.Riccarton being the location of Hearts training ground, where the contentious press-conference took place. Pressley was dropped for a match against Falkirk on 13 November and named as an unused substitute for a 1‚Äì0 defeat by Rangers on 19 November. Hartley was only used as a substitute in the former game. Pressley eventually left Hearts on 9 December, with accompanying press releases stating that this was an amicable agreement. He joined rivals Celtic on 1 January 2007 and captained his new squad to a 2‚Äì1 victory at Tynecastle on his first return to Edinburgh. Hartley also moved to Celtic during January 2007, in a ¬£1.1 million transfer on 31 January. This only left Gordon, who was dropped for matches away to Dundee United and Rangers in December and January respectively, as the only member of the trio to remain at Hearts beyond the January transfer window. Hearts failed to win a game under the management of Eduard Malofeev, who took control during Ivanauskas' sabbatical. Hearts lost at Celtic and Hibernian ‚Äì a result which eliminated Hearts from the CIS Cup ‚Äì and at home to Rangers. He remained as caretaker manager until late November 2006 when, despite media reports anticipating the appointment of Eugenijus Riabovas, Ivanauskas returned to resume his duties as club manager. A 1‚Äì0 loss in the Scottish Cup at Dunfermline on 3 February 2007, with Gordon on the bench, ended Hearts' chance to retain the trophy. Later that month, Ivanauskas was moved to a director of football role, with director of football Anatoly Korobochka assuming the role of interim head coach on 2 March. An improved run of form towards the end of the season witnessed Hearts challenge Aberdeen for third spot in the League and UEFA Cup qualification. The Dons scored a last minute equaliser in a head-to-head confrontation between the two teams at Tynecastle in May, and eventually finished four points clear in third place. Final table Transfers On the eve of the SPL season, Hearts announced the capture of Chile striker Mauricio Pinilla on a season-long loan. PAOK Salonika's Christos Karipidis and Tiago Costa, a full back from Benfica B were also signed, while in the final week of the transfer window three further Lithuanian players ‚Äì Marius ≈Ωali≈´kas, Kƒôstutis Iva≈°keviƒçius and Andrius Veliƒçka ‚Äì joined on loan from FBK Kaunas. Hearts fans still anticipated the arrival of \\"two World Cup stars\\" but were left disappointed when the club announced that the final piece of business of the transfer window would be to sign the previously-loaned striker Roman Bedn√°≈ô on a permanent deal.

Several editing techniques and doubles were used for the various shots where there were more than one of the same character on the screen. The mini-episodes received mixed reviews; some scenes were thought to be funny, but other jokes were criticised for relying on sexist humour. \\"Space\\" and \\"Time\\" were later released on the DVD and Blu-ray sets of the sixth series.  Plot  = \\"Space\\" = Amy is trying to get the Doctor's attention while he fixes the TARDIS. She discovers that her husband Rory is helping the Doctor by installing thermal couplings underneath the glass floor of the TARDIS. Rory and Amy then start a small argument about Amy cheating when she took her driving test, when the TARDIS suddenly shakes and the lights go out. The Doctor asks Rory if he dropped a thermal coupling, which Rory admits to and apologises for doing. Amy then apologises as well and, at the Doctor's confusion, explains that Rory was looking up her skirt through the glass floor when he dropped the thermal coupling. The Doctor then notes that they have landed through \\"emergency materialisation\\" which should have landed the TARDIS in the safest space available. The lights come on, revealing another TARDIS inside the control room ‚Äî the TARDIS has materialised inside itself. The Doctor experimentally walks through the door of the TARDIS inside the control room and instantly walks back into the control room through the door of the outer TARDIS. The Doctor tells Rory and Amy that they are trapped in a \\"space loop\\" and that nothing can enter or exit the TARDIS ever again. Despite the Doctor's words, another Amy enters through the TARDIS door saying, \\"Okay, kids, this is where it gets complicated.\\" = \\"Time\\" = The other Amy reveals that she is from a few moments in the future, and is able to come into the current outer TARDIS because \\"the exterior shell of the TARDIS has drifted forwards in time\\". The other Amy knows what to say and do because, from her perspective, she is repeating what she heard herself say earlier on. The Doctor sends the current Amy into the TARDIS within the current TARDIS, in order to maintain the timeline. The two Amys take a moment to flirt with each other before the current one departs, much to the Doctor's exasperation. However, not long after the current Amy has left, Rory and Amy enter through the door of outer TARDIS explaining that the Doctor, from their perspective, has just sent them into the inner TARDIS. The current Doctor promptly sends the current Rory and the now-current Amy through the inner TARDIS. The Doctor then explains that he will set up a \\"controlled temporal implosion\\" in order to \\"reset the TARDIS\\", but in order to do so he must know which lever to use on the control panel. Moments after he speaks, another Doctor enters through the outer TARDIS door and tells him to use \\"the wibbly lever\\", which he quickly operates, then steps into the inner TARDIS to tell his past self which lever to use. The inner TARDIS dematerialises while the outer TARDIS (being the same TARDIS) does the same, and the Doctor assures Amy and Rory that they are now back in normal flight, and then advises Amy to put some trousers on.  Production  Doctor Who had previously aired two related specials for Comic Relief. The first was the 1999 spoof The Curse of Fatal Death, which was also written by Steven Moffat. The spin-off series The Sarah Jane Adventures produced its own mini-episode \\"From Raxacoricofallapatorius with Love\\" for the 2009 Comic Relief appeal. Unlike The Curse of Fatal Death, \\"Space\\" and \\"Time\\" are considered to be canonical. The canonicity of the two mini-episodes was affirmed by Moffat in Doctor Who Magazine. Moffat stated that, unlike The Curse of Fatal Death, \\"Space\\" and \\"Time\\" is not a spoof or a sketch, but rather \\"a little miniature story\\" in the style of the Children in Need mini- episodes. He described it as \\"A moment of life aboard the TARDIS. But obviously life about the TARDIS instantly gets you into terrible jeopardy, and all of causality is threatened. As I'm sure it is every day when they get up and have their coffee...\\" The concept of a TARDIS inside the TARDIS had been previously explored in The Time Monster (1972) and Logopolis (1980), though both times it was the TARDIS of the Master. Amy also repeats one of her lines from \\"The Big Bang\\" at the end of \\"Space\\". The special was shot over two days alongside the made-for-DVD Night and the Doctor mini-episodes \\"Bad Night\\" and \\"Good Night\\". It was mostly shot on the first day, where all of the scenes with the TARDIS inside the TARDIS were filmed. Several tricks were used to create the illusion that there were more than one Doctor, Amy, and/or Rory. In scenes where the camera had to move between the double characters, a \\"whip- pan\\" was used twice, with the actor in a different place each time. The two shots were then edited together into one seamless take. For scenes where there were more than one of the same character in the same shot, such as the two Amys in front of the TARDIS, the camera was held very still and the scene was filmed twice, with the actor's double filling in for the part they were not playing. The doubles were also used briefly in scenes where the characters' backs were to the camera, such as when the Doctor, Amy, and Rory watched the future Amy and Rory enter the TARDIS.  Broadcast, release and reception  \\"Space\\" and \\"Time\\" were broadcast during the Comic Relief Red Nose Day telethon on 18 March 2011 on BBC One. The telethon was watched by 10.26 million viewers. Note: Information is in the section titled \\"w/e March 14‚Äì20, 2011\\", listed under BBC1 The BBC posted the episode in two parts on their official YouTube channel. The mini episodes were included as bonus features in the Complete Sixth Series DVD and Blu-ray box set, released on 21 November 2011 (Region 2) and 22 November 2011 (Region 1). Lucy Mangan of The Guardian responded positively, noting it \\"manages brilliantly to nod to just about every Whovian in-joke, demographic and fetish within the span of two tiny installments\\". The A.V. Club reviewer Christopher Bahn opined that the two Amys in \\"Space\\" and \\"Time\\" were \\"a lot more fun to watch\\" than the two in the sixth series episode \\"The Girl Who Waited\\". Tor.com's Teresa Jusino, who had been positive towards Amy's character in the past, was disappointed that the ending of the miniepisodes relied on \\"too-easy, dated, sexist humor\\". She cited the fact that Rory dropping the coupling was blamed on Amy's short skirt rather than Rory himself, which implied that she had a \\"responsibility to cover up, because 'men will be men'\\". In Who is the Doctor, a guide to the revived series, Robert Smith wrote that the episode was \\"cute, plotted to perfection and ends precisely when it should, before it has the chance to outstay its welcome\\". He said that the episodes used Amy well, as it did not make her unlikable. On the other hand, his coauthor Graeme Burk said that the story was \\"derivative and lazy\\" and a \\"missed opportunity\\". He likened the plot to that of Red Dwarf \\"Future Echoes\\", and felt that Moffat could have written something better and funnier. Like Jusino, he thought that the \\"blokey humor\\" was \\"misplaced\\", denying a broad audience appeal and leading to the sexist last line: \\"Pond, put some trousers on!\\". Despite this, both Jusino and Burk enjoyed the scene where Amy flirts with herself.

His main research interests are the archaeology of ancient technologies, especially traction systems in Greco-Roman land transport and farming, the production and trade of ancient ceramics and the wider socioeconomic implications of these technologies, as well as Roman Gaul. His methods include the use of experimentation.  Career  Born in 1947 in the Eastern Flemish town of Oudenaarde, Belgium, Raepsaet received his Master in Ancient History in 1969, and another one in Arts and Archaeology in 1972, both at the University of Brussels. In 1977 he completed his dissertation on the Pagus Condrustis and the Romanization of Northern Gaul. In the following year, Raepsaet became senior lecturer at the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles where he was appointed professor in 1992 and taught until his retirement in 2007. His courses focused, inter alia, on classical archaeology, ancient economic and social history, history of pre-industrial technologies, archaeology of Roman Gaul and excavation techniques. He founded and directed the university research units Laboratoire d‚ÄôArch√©ologie classique and Centre de Recherches arch√©ologiques. From 1997 to 1999 Raepsaet co-directed a research programme on the process of technological innovation in antiquity and the Middle Ages. Currently, he works as an expert for the European Science Foundation and chairs the scientific committee of the Royal Museum of Mariemont. Since 1970 Raepsaet has been on the editorial board of the Belgian journal L‚ÄôAntiquit√© Classique for which he has been reviewing each year about thirty books on classic archaeology, economic history and ancient technology. Gallo-Roman reaper, called vallus Since 1970 Raepsaet has participated in and directed several archaeological excavations and fieldworks in Western Europe and the eastern Mediterranean basin. These include underwater excavations at Martigues, France, and Amathus on Cyprus, as well as fieldwork at the site of the Diolkos on the Isthmus and Styra on Euboea (1984‚Äì88). He also took part in excavations in Apamea, Syria (1978‚Äì79) and in numerous archaeological projects on the Roman period in his native Belgium (since 1968). At Brussels he was in charge of temporary exhibitions of Ancient Greek marbles (Marbres hell√©niques, 1987‚Äì88) and of Thracian gold (Europalia Bulgarie, 2002). From 1997 to 2007 Raepsaet conducted a number of tests in experimental archaeology on ancient agricultural techniques, in particular on the efficiency of Gallo-Roman harnesses, drawbars and the reaper (vallus). Over the years Raepsaet has also been active in the study of the technology and trade of Roman ceramics, its distribution and transport network in the Roman provinces and commercial and legal aspects related to it.  Ancient technology and productivity  Much of Raepsaet's research since the 1970s has addressed and challenged the idea, still dominant at the time, of a lack of productivity of the Roman economy. Raepsaet criticized the \\"epistemological prejudice\\" particularly prevalent in studies of the 1960s and 1970s: these analyzed the classical world in terms of stagnation and technological blockage, effectively preventing scholarship from approaching the sizable corpus of evidence to the contrary from an unbiased perspective.Raepsaet, Georges: \\"Landtransport, Part 2: Riding, Harnesses, and Vehicles\\", in Oleson, John Peter (ed.), Handbook of Engineering and Technology in the Classical World, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008, pp. 580‚Äì605, Raepsaet focused on the key role of traction systems in land transport and ploughing, a field then dominated by strong primitivist views. He demonstrated that ancient transport capacities were in fact largely identical to and as developed and efficient as those of later periods up until the 19th century, but with the Romans enjoying the additional advantage of having a superior road network at their disposal. Through his study of Gallo-Roman harnesses, Raepsaet came to reject the early, but influential theory of Richard Lefebvre des No√´ttes about the inefficiency of the Roman horse collar. In reality, draught animals in antiquity were able to move heavy loads of several dozens tons overland evident, for example, in the frequent transport of ancient monoliths or the regular use of the Diolkos ship trackway. Raepsaet‚Ä≤s reappraisal of the technological level of ancient traction systems has been echoed and parallelled by a generation of classical scholars and historians of technology pursuing studies in diverse fields of ancient technology. From their collaborative effort to move beyond a sterile dichotomy of primitivism and modernism sprang, for example, Brill‚Ä≤s series on Technology and Change in History and the Handbook of Engineering and Technology in the Classical World which received the 2009 book award of the Society for the History of Technology.Brill: Technology and Change in HistoryThe Society for the History of Technology: The Ferguson Prize The increasingly positive perception of ancient technological developments and their economic impact has also contributed to a reevaluation of the performance of the ancient economy as a whole.Scheidel, Walter; Morris, Ian ; Saller, Richard (eds.): The Cambridge Economic History of the Greco-Roman World, Cambridge University Press, 2007,  Selected works  ; Ceramics and archaeology of the Roman provinces * La c√©ramique en terre sigill√©e de la villa belgo-romaine de Robelmont.

Having been completed in 1910, it was the first skyscraper in the Inland Northwest. At tall, the building was the tallest in the state of Washington from 1910 to 1911, when it was surpassed by the Key Bank Center in Tacoma‚Äîwhich itself was far surpassed by Seattle's Smith Tower in 1914. It remained the tallest building in Spokane, until the 1929 completion of the Paulsen Medical Building, located across the street. History In 1891, the Old National Bank of Spokane was founded. The bank quickly grew to be a large institution within the Inland Northwest and in 1910, decided to build a headquarters worthy of the Northwest. There was a national design competition to decide the buildings appearance. The winning design was awarded to D.H. Burnham & Company of Chicago, a notable firm for building some of Americas most famous buildings of the 20th century. The tower was built in the Chicago School style and had Beaux-Arts architecture features throughout the facade. This was the last office building to be designed by Burnham, with its completion being quickly followed by his death in 1912. The building broke ground in March 1910 and was completed a mere eight months later, opening its doors to the public in January 1911. The Old National Bank building was notable for having 90 per cent of the building rented out to tenants at the time of its completion, and for being built having been financed by large bankers of the area, causing it to be built without a mortgage or deficit at a cost of $1,300,000. These happenings made the building, and the bank, worthy of the city of Spokane and the patrons who financed its construction, who gained valuable profit and recognition. =Architecture= The bank was built using fireproofed steel frame construction, with the exterior faced with semi- enamel Terra Cotta. To enhance the contrast between the white Terra Cotta and the fenestration, the wood window frames were painted a forest green. The first level is topped with a four-foot cornice of Vermont granite, eleven stories higher from the twelfth floor to the fifteenth floor, an arcade was implemented crowning the entire structure. A walk on the roof offered views of the growing city. The interiors were just as elaborate as the exteriors, at least at the time of their creation. There were two entrances off of Riverside Ave; the banking entrance and the office tower entrance. The banking entrance opens up to a grand lobby two levels in height. Granite ionic columns hold up the clerestory space being connected by service stations and tellers all facing the open lobby for ease of access by the people. The office tower entrance opens up immediately to the elevator lobby, servicing the other floors of the bank and the tenants in the rented spaces above. These five elevators were provided by the Otis Elevator Company, and ran smoothly up the entirety of the building with the help of live elevator operators. Two of these elevators service the first through ninth floors, two more service the eighth through the fourteenth floors, and the fifth elevator services the entire building. These elevator operations were planned to accommodate the best circulation of tenants throughout the building. =Banking Features= Some of the most notable features within the bank was not in its architecture or design, but in its operations. The facilities were state of the art and served Spokane with the highest quality equipment at the time, providing banking in the northwest with the maximum convenience it could. Another feature that caused the Old National Bank to stand out against the rest of the Inland Empire was featured in its basement, often out of public view. Directly within the banking entrance, the main stairs led down to the vault floor. The vault door was twenty-three inches thick and weighed thirty-six tons. This door guarded the largest private vault in the Northwest, a 27 by 9 foot room, with walls covered in three layers of laminated steel, Bessemer steel, and chrome steel, each layer being one and a half inches thick. Besides this main vault, there was a vault located on every floor of the building, each one being fire and burglar proof, proving to the community that whatever was kept in the building would be safe. Renovations The Old National Bank building has undergone two major renovations since its construction in 1910. The first renovation took place in the early 1920s. It consisted of turning the clerestory space into a mezzanine, allowing for the second floor to look down onto the lobby. The second renovation in the late 1963 dramatically altered the appearance of the interiors. The ceiling of the lobby was lowered, allowing for the first two floors of the bank to be pancaked on top of each other; the granite ionic columns were also stripped. After the 1963 renovation, the building took part in a lighting contest winning a national award, the entire facade of the building was lit up with fluorescent lights, glowing in the Spokane skyline. Today the Old National Bank building is occupied by US Bank.

It is the eighth consecutive season of play in the Scottish Premier League in which Hearts have competed since its inauguration in 1998‚Äì99. Hearts also competed in the Scottish Cup and Scottish League Cup. Season Overview Romanov said that his ultimate aim is for Hearts to win the Champions League. His early actions included bringing in former Rugby Union chief Phil Anderton as CEO on 3 March 2005. On 9 May 2005, manager John Robertson resigned, a move which was greeted with much dismay among supporters because Robertson had been a great player for Hearts. Former Ipswich Town and Derby County manager George Burley was hired on 30 June 2005 to replace him. As the season began, the combination of Romanov's financial backing and the appointment of Burley led many Hearts fans to believe that they could win the SPL championship in 2005‚Äì06. Signings such as Edgaras Jankauskas, Rudi Sk√°cel and Takis Fyssas, allied to existing players Andy Webster, Steven Pressley, Craig Gordon, and Paul Hartley meant that Hearts built a team which made an outstanding start to the season. Hearts won their first eight SPL games, including a 1‚Äì0 win over reigning champions Rangers. After leading the Jambos through ten undefeated SPL appearances, and guiding them to the top of the league table, Hearts and Burley parted ways on 22 October 2005, just hours before their Premier League match with Dunfermline Athletic. A club statement after the game declared that the departure of Burley had been mutually agreed and that there were \\"irreconcilable differences\\" between Burley and the Hearts board. Throughout his short spell in charge rumours had persisted that the relationship between Burley and Romanov was uneasy. It had also been reported that Romanov had signed players without Burley's consent. John McGlynn was put in temporary charge of the team following Burley's abrupt departure. Chief executive Phil Anderton was dismissed on 31 October 2005. The chairman, George Foulkes resigned in protest at Anderton's dismissal. Romanov's son, Roman Romanov, was appointed as chairman and acting chief executive. Vladimir Romanov's concerns with the fairness of refereeing developed during this period. This started after Hearts made complaints after a match with Rangers in the 2004‚Äì05 season during which the referee Hugh Dallas controversially awarded a decisive penalty kick late in the match on the basis of advice from his linesman Andy Davis. There were also complaints after the dismissals of Craig Gordon against Falkirk, Edgaras Jankauskas against Hibs and Saulius Mikoliunas against Rangers. Romanov called for a replay of each of these matches, but this was refused and Romanov was rebuked by the SFA. On 7 November, Graham Rix was appointed as head coach. Hearts' title ambitions suffered a major setback when they lost 3‚Äì2 to Celtic on 1 January 2006. On 7 February 2006, reports were made indicating that Rix had told players who were apparently disgruntled at being left out of the team before a match against Dundee United that Romanov himself was picking the team and was \\"pulling the strings\\". While it was well known that Rix was not in charge of player transfer policy, it had not previously been confirmed that he was not in charge of selecting the team either. Part of the fallout from this match was that the agent of Andy Webster indicated that Webster would not extend his contract with Hearts, which was due to expire at the end of 2006‚Äì07 season. During April 2006, Vladimir Romanov put Andy Webster on the transfer list, claiming that he could not trust the player.Webster made football transfer history when he invoked a loophole in FIFA-adopted EU law, enabling him to cancel his contract with Hearts in the third year of a four-year deal with the proviso that he join a club in a foreign country and that sufficient notice is given to his former employers. Webster's transfer to Wigan Athletic was ratified by FIFA on 4 September 2006.\\"Webster on his way out at Hearts\\" (BBC SPORT, Wednesday 26 April 2006 07:57 GMT.) . Retrieved 27 April 2006. Graham Rix was sacked as Hearts manager on 22 March 2006 along with the club's Director of Football, Jim Duffy, who had only been appointed one month previously. Shortly afterwards, former FBK Kaunas coach Valdas Ivanauskas was appointed interim head coach of the first team until the end of the season. Steven Pressley scores in the 2006 Scottish Cup final penalty shootout Nonetheless, on 2 April 2006 Hearts eased into the Scottish Cup Final. A 1‚Äì0 win over Aberdeen on 3 May at Tynecastle guaranteed second place in the SPL behind Celtic and a place in the Champions League qualifying rounds for the following season. It also meant that Hearts were the first club to break the total dominance of the Scottish Premier League by the Old Firm since Motherwell in 1995.

Early life The son of Dr. John Scott (died 1836), minister of the Middle Church, Greenock, by his wife Susanna, daughter of Alexander Fisher of Dychmount, he was born on 26 March 1805. He was educated at the local grammar school and at the University of Glasgow, which he entered at the age of fourteen, remaining there until he was twenty-one. Having graduated M.A. in 1827, he was around the same time licensed by the presbytery of Paisley to preach in the Church of Scotland. He had previously obtained a tutorship in Edinburgh, where he attended medical classes at the university. Minister His first sermon after he was licensed was preached for the Rev. John McLeod Campbell, who heard him ‚Äòwith very peculiar delight.‚Äô In the following year (1828) he made the acquaintance of Thomas Erskine of Linlathen, afterwards one of his closest friends, and of Edward Irving, who invited him to be his assistant in London. He accepted the invitation, without committing himself to Irving's doctrinal views. He spent the winter months in preaching and teaching among the poor of Westminster. Towards the close of 1829 he went to preach for McLeod Campbell at Row, and also at Port Glasgow, where his sermons on the Charismata or ‚Äòspiritual gifts‚Äô of 1 Corinthians xii. led to an exhibition of speaking with tongues and prophesying in the church. The movement and the manifestations accompanying it had great influence on Irving, more than on Scott himself, who never felt the utterances to be proofs of any inspiration. The connection between the two preachers was soon afterwards severed, though their friendship continued. In the summer of 1830 Scott received an invitation to the pastorate of the Scottish church at Woolwich, but the necessary ordination involved subscription to the Westminster Confession of Faith. This he could not give, and he put his objections in a letter to the moderator of the London presbytery, in which he stated his inability to assent to the doctrine that ‚Äònone are redeemed by Christ but the elect only,‚Äô as well as his conviction that the ‚ÄòSabbath and the Lord's day were not, as stated in the catechism, one ordinance, but two, perfectly distinct, the one Jewish and the other Christian.‚Äô He also mentioned doubts as to the validity of the presbytery's powers in ordination. On 27 May 1831 he was charged with heresy before the presbytery of Paisley, and deprived of his licence to preach, a sentence which was confirmed by the general assembly. Scott then remained at Woolwich until 1846, as minister of a small congregation. Academic In November 1848 he obtained the chair of English language and literature in University College, London, and in 1851 was appointed principal of Owens College, Manchester, then recently established. With this post he held the professorship of logic and mental philosophy, of comparative grammar, and of English language and literature. Soon after his appointment he took part with the Rev. William Gaskell and others in starting the Manchester Working Men's College, later merged in the evening classes at Owens College. He resigned the principalship in May 1857, being succeeded by Joseph Gouge Greenwood, but continued to act as professor until his death. His health, always delicate, grew weaker in his later years. With the hope of gaining strength he went to Switzerland in the autumn of 1865, but died at Veytaux on 12 January 1866, and was buried in the cemetery at Clarens. Works His lecture series printed in separate form included: * ‚ÄòLectures Expository and Practical on the Epistle to the Romans,‚Äô 1838. * ‚ÄòOn the Academical Study of a Vernacular Language,‚Äô 1848. * ‚ÄòSuggestions on Female Education,‚Äô 1849. * ‚ÄòNotes of Four Lectures on the Literature and Philosophy of the Middle Ages;‚Äô printed for private circulation (by Thomas Erskine of Linlathen), Edinburgh, 1857. * ‚ÄòDiscourses,‚Äô 1866; this posthumous volume contains early addresses on ‚ÄòSocial Systems of the Present Day compared with Christianity,‚Äô ‚ÄòSchism,‚Äô and ‚ÄòThe First Principle of Church Government.‚Äô F.

Tetmajer was a pioneer in the development of the research laboratories for determining the physical and mechanical properties of the construction materials and a co-founder of the Festigkeitspr√ºfungsanstalt, the modern Eidgenossische Materialpr√ºfungs- und Forschungsanstalt (Empa) of Switzerland. Life Ludwig Tetmajer was born as the second child of Wladyslaw Tetmajer, director of the iron-works in Krompachy (Slovakia) and Luise Elsner. They belonged to the Austro-Swiss branch of the Tetmajer family. His cousins, novelist Kazimierz Przerwa- Tetmajer and painter W≈Çodzimierz Tetmajer, belonged to the Polish branch of the family. He spent his childhood in the vicinity of the iron-works what decisively influenced his life. In 1867 he finished his secondary education cum laude and after a one-year preparatory study he enrolled at the Faculty of Engineering at the Eidgen√∂ssischen Polytechnikum in Zurich, Switzerland. In 1872, at the age of 22, he finished his education as a building engineer with the highest marks. Tetmajer first worked as an intern with the Swiss Northeastern Railway. In 1873, he became an assistant of Carl Culmann from the chair of Statics at the Eidgen√∂ssischen Polytechnikum and later the same year became a Privatdozent for the Building Mechanics. In 1875, he was conscripted and served for a year with the 66th Austro-Hungarian infantry regiment. In order to gain Swiss citizenship he left the army in 1877 as a reserve officer of the 34th infantry regiment. Having been granted the Swiss citizenship, he married the opera singer Maria Luise Kindermann (March 3, 1852 - June 22, 1912), the daughter of the opera singer August Kindermann on October 24, 1877 in Munich. They had three children: Elsa (born August 26, 1878), August Helmar Rudolf (January 12, 1880 - July 14, 1946), an architect and a chronicler of the family, and Bruno Friedrich (born June 17, 1887), a chemist. In 1878, Tetmajer was appointed an extraordinary professor at the Zurich Polytechnic Institute. In 1880 he was appointed a provisional director of the Festigkeitspr√ºfungsanstalt and from February 1, 1881 a permanent director of that institution and an ordinary professor for the Building mechanics. He was the president of the newly founded International association for the material testing from 1896. In 1901, he was appointed Professor of the Technical Mechanics and the Building Materials at Vienna University of Technology, resigning as the head of the Festigkeitspr√ºfungsanstalt and as a professor at ETH.

It is a section of the G√§u Railway from Stuttgart to Freudenstadt opened on 1 September 1879. The line was the link from the state capital of Stuttgart to the Kinzig Valley Railway. Both the G√§u Railway and the Kinzig Valley Railway were main lines until 1974. Since the mid-1970s these railways were threatened time and again with closure. Not until 2006 was comprehensive electrification and renovation work carried out as part of the development of the Freudenst√§dter Stern regional network. Finally the line was integrated into the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn network and once again after a decade a direct link to Stuttgart was introduced. The G√§u Railway was planned by railway engineer, Georg Morlok, and was characterised by viaducts and deep rock cuttings that were an architectural challenge to build.  Route  =G√§ubahn= Course of the G√§ubahn between Stuttgart and Freudenstadt The line forms part of the G√§u Railway (G√§ubahn), which was originally a name for the Stuttgart‚ÄìFreudenstadt railway that had opened in 1879 and runs through Herrenberg and Eutingen through the cultural landscape of the G√§u. However, from the 1930s, the term was extended to the nearby Eutingen‚ÄìHorb line which had formerly been regarded as part of the Nagold Valley Railway. From the 1950s, the term began to be used for the line from Horb to Singen. The Stuttgart‚ÄìSingen line therefore, is now also called the G√§ubahn. = Course= The Eutingen‚ÄìFreudenstadt railway branches off the Stuttgart‚ÄìSingen railway in Eutingen to run in a westerly direction through the wide G√§u plateau and to connect with the Nagold Valley Railway at Nagold- Hochdorf. The line runs to the south-west through the Horbe district, passing through some low forests and glades to Bittelbronn. Continuing northwest, the line passes the edge of the village of Schopfloch. From there, the line begins to be spectacular. Mighty rock cuttings and exposed rock formations characterise the line from this point. Shortly before Dornstetten there is a wide, unobstructed view of the foothills of the Black Forest. Running mainly west, the line crosses three large viaducts over the valleys near Dornstetten- Aach, Freudenstadt-Gr√ºntal and Freudenstadt-Wittlensweiler to Freudenst√§dt Hauptbahnhof, which is in the southern part of the town.  History Stuttgart central station, starting point of the Stuttgart‚ÄìFreudenstadt railway (G√§ubahn) opened in 1872 A government bill dated 28 April 1865 already mentioned a G√§u-Bahn (Stuttgart‚ÄìFreudenstadt) as a railway line to be built. It would connect the W√ºrttemberg capital of Stuttgart with the Black Forest and future railway lines in the Murg and Kinzig valleys. Any problems due to a 1.56 km long section through Hohenzollern territory between Bittelbronn and Schopfloch had been resolved by a provision covering this possibility in a treaty between W√ºrttemberg and Prussia agreed on 13 March 1865. The Economic Committee of the Second Chamber stated, that \\"W√ºrttemberg [with the G√§ubahn] is preparing to join the ranks of our competitors [especially Baden] on the route to the St. Gotthard.\\" Moreover, the G√§u Railway would result in an almost straight route which cuts through the kingdom from one end (Freudenstadt) to the other (the border at Crailsheim). The Chamber agreed at its 116th and 117th sessions to the building of the railway. The government entrusted the management of the construction of the G√§u Railway to the W√ºrttemberg architect and railway engineer Georg von Morlok. Morlok himself described the necessary large-scale cuttings through the wet rock formations at Schopfloch and the construction of the Ettenbach Viaduct at Wittlensweiler as particularly difficult. Some expert opinion considered it \\"almost impossible\\". Nevertheless, the Royal W√ºrttemberg State Railways (K√∂niglich W√ºrttembergische Staats-Eisenbahnen) were able to open the approximately 88 km-long G√§u Railway from Stuttgart via Herrenberg and Eutingen to Freudenstadt on 1 September 1879 in one piece. A G√§u Railway opening march was composed especially for the inauguration. The new line connected to the Kinzig Valley Railway in Freudenstadt and to the Nagold Valley Railway in Eutingen. Thus, the new line provided an alternative between Stuttgart and Freudenstadt to the W√ºrttemberg Black Forest Railway. But over time, the new shorter line via B√∂blingen won the competition despite significant gradients. W√ºrttemberg F class locomotive at the G√§u Railway halt of Stuttgart-Heslach (before 1900) = Development until the Second World War (1879‚Äì1945) = Since the line of the G√§u Railway (Stuttgart‚ÄìFreudenstadt) was connected to the Eutingen station on the Nagold Valley Railway, the trains from Stuttgart to Freudenstadt had to reverse in Eutingen station. Initially, there were only three scheduled trains per day on the lines, and the signals and points were set by hand. However, it quickly became apparent that this was causing problems with increasing traffic and raised safety standards. So a signal box at Freudenstadt Hauptbahnhof was completed in 1891. Around 1900, Freudenstadt was the destination of a Baden train from Frankfurt and Wiesbaden via Karlsruhe, Pforzheim and Hochdorf. At the end of the 1920s, construction began on a branch line to the G√§u Railway, which would run from Dornstetten via Dornstetten-Hallwangen to Pfalzgrafenweiler. The project was never completed for financial reasons. The remodeled railway embankment is a reminder of this event. Location of the old and new Eutingen stations In 1933, Eutingen station was moved to its current location. At the same time, a connecting curve was built so that the trains on the Stuttgart‚ÄìFreudenstadt route no longer needed to reverse in the station. Double-track operations also began at that time between Eutingen and Hochdorf. Previously, one track had been used by the Nagold Valley Railway and one track by the G√§u Railway. A few days before the end of the Second World War and four hours before French troops invaded Freudenstadt, the Wehrmacht blew up the three timber viaducts of the G√§ubahn. Rail services were closed for several years. Steam operations on the two-track section between Eutingen and Hochdorf in 1973 = Recommissioning and imminent decommissioning (1945‚Äì1990) = Services did note resume until 1 September 1949, when the last viaduct was repaired. Also the so-called Franzosenzug (French train) ran on the somewhat unusual Offenburg‚ÄìHausach‚ÄìFreudenstadt‚ÄìHorb‚ÄìT√ºbingen route from September 1949. It got its name because it mainly served French military traffic. Following the takeover of the G√§u Railway by the Deutsche Bundesbahn, an electro-mechanical interlocking was built in Freudenstadt. This was followed by a period of prosperity for tourism in the Black Forest, benefiting Freudenstadt in particular. In 1954, the Hochdorf guard signal box on the line towards Eutingen was closed and a central dispatcher's signal box was built. This was accompanied by a simplification of the track layout. The popularity of long-haul destinations and the shift of traffic to road transport, among other things, led to a sharp decline in passenger numbers in the 1960s. Closure of the line was considered towards the end of the decade. However, this was averted by concerted action by local politicians and interest groups as well as support from federal politicians. However, for a long time hardly any investments were made in rolling stock and infrastructure. In 1974, the line was downgraded from a main line to a branch line and, a year later, the halt of Freudenstadt-Gr√ºntal was closed. The second track between Eutingen and Hochdorf was dismantled in 1985. The remaining track has since been used by trains on both the G√§u Railway and the Nagold Valley Railway. The loading of freight in Hochdorf was discontinued in 1988. Eutingen station was renamed from Eutingen (W√ºrtt) to Eutingen im G√§u in 1988. Karlsruhe Stadtbahn network = Development in the \\"Freudenstadt Star\\" (since 1990) = In the mid-1990s, plans were made for a regional network called the Freudenst√§dter Stern (Freudenstadt Star). These provided for cost reductions through the greatest possible rationalisation of personnel and infrastructure, the introduction of an integraled timetable and services at least every hour. Significant steps towards the completion of the Freudenstadt Star were made with the electrification of the Murg Valley Railway in the course of the extension of lines S 31 (S 81 since 2016) and S 41 (now S 8) of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn to Freudenstadt 2003, the takeover of the operations on the Kinzig Valley Railway by the Ortenau-S-Bahn (OSB) in 2005 and the construction of a computer-based interlocking at Freudenstadt Hauptbahnhof. One of the last projects of the regional network was the electrification of the G√§u Railway in 2006 as well as the construction and reconstruction of the crossing stations at Schopfloch and Hochdorf. This allowed the line to be integrated into the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn, then as line S 41. The change was accompanied by a sharp increase in passenger numbers. In 2005, only about 500 passengers per day used services on the G√§u Railway, compared to 1,300 in 2007 and 1,400 in 2008. In order to improve the connection of the population of the eastern Freudenstadt district to the railway on the model of the Murg Valley Railway, new stations are planned in Freudenstadt-Gr√ºntal, Dornstetten-Aach, Dornstetten Mitte (as a replacement for the old station), Horb-Heiligenfeld and Eutingen im G√§u Nord. Of these, the first station, Horb-Heiligenfeld, was finally opened in December 2012 in the industrial area of the same name. A year later, in December 2013, this was followed by the reactivation of the former halt of Freundenstadt-Gr√ºntal under the new name of Gr√ºntal/Wittlensweiler. Furthermore, the halt of Bittelbronn was made barrier-free. The two new halts in Dornstetten are currently going through the planning approval process after a significant delay at local level.  Structural features  The K√ºbelbach Viaduct near Dornstetten-Aach before electrification The Ettenbach viaduct after its completion in 1878 The biggest challenge in the construction of the G√§u Railway was crossing the valleys at Aach, Gr√ºntal and Wittlensweiler. This required the construction of three elaborate timbered viaducts: * The K√ºbelbach Viaduct runs near Aach (now a district of Dornstetten) over the valley of the K√ºbelbach and federal highway 28. It was constructed between 1875 and 1879. The bridge is 279 metres long, has five openings, has four central pillars and is about 45 metres high. * The Stockerbach Viaduct was formerly identical to the K√ºbelbach viaduct, but was restored after its destruction in a more modern design. It crosses the Gr√ºn valley at Stockerbach. Its length is also 279 metres and its height is about 43 metres. It was built at the same time as the K√ºbelbach viaduct. * As the smallest of the three railway bridges of the G√§ubahn near Freudenstadt, the Ettenbach Viaduct, built in 1877‚Äì1878, crosses the Ettenbach in Wittlensweiler, now a district of Freudenstadt. It has a length of 171 metres and its height is 25 metres. Large quantities of stone from quarries in the region were used for its construction. The iron structures were transported from Horb-Neckarhausen.  Operations Freudenstadt Hauptbahnhof Empty timber train from Horb-Heiligenfeld on the G√§u Railway Freudenstadt‚ÄìStuttgart Regional-Express in Eutingen The route is operated by Deutsche Bahn. Every two hours a Regionalexpress (RE) operates from Freudenstadt to Stuttgart. On the hour between these services, the Albtal-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft (AVG) has extended Stadtbahn lines S 8 and S 81 (Karlsruhe‚ÄìFreudenstadt) to run to Eutingen on behalf of Deutsche Bahn. As a result, Karlsruhe can also be reached from Eutingen without having to change trains. In Eutingen there is a connection between the Stadtbahn and the Stuttgart‚ÄìSingen RE service. The S 8 also runs to Herrenberg in the evening, as a feeder to line S 1 of the Stuttgart S-Bahn. In Hochdorf there is a connection to the Pforzheim‚ÄìHorb‚ÄìT√ºbingen Regionalbahn (RB) service, in Freudenstadt to Ortenau S-Bahn services to Offenburg and Stadtbahn lines S 8 and S 81 services to Karlsruhe Kronenplatz and Karlsruhe Hauptbahnhof. In 2007, the AVG established an operations shed for passenger and freight rolling stock at Freudenstadt Hauptbahnhof. In total, six of its own vehicles and two Deutsche Bahn railcars have a covered stabling area. Freight traffic plays a decreasing role on the G√§u Railway. The only dedicated tracks for freight traffic are in the Horb- Heiligenfeld industrial area. The last major transport of timber was carried out after the storm damage of the Lothar and Kyrill cyclones. A problem with freight transport in particular is the congestion of the G√§u Railway on the short section between Eutingen and Hochdorf, which is used by the Nagold Valley Railway. Occasionally services hauled by historic steam locomotives also operate on the G√§u Railway. = Rolling stock= * The Stuttgart‚ÄìFreudenstadt RE service is operated with Bombardier Talent 2 (class 442) electric multiple units. * Services between Eutingen im G√§u and Freudenstadt are operated hourly with Stadtbahn sets of the GT8-100D/2S-M class. * In the evening individual Stadtbahn sets are operated on the S 8 service to Herrenberg. * Stadler Regio-Shuttle RS1 diesel railcars of DB ZugBus Regionalverkehr Alb-Bodensee (RAB, a subsidiary of DB Regio) are operated on the track section shared with the Nagold Valley Railway. = Fares= In addition to the fares of Deutsche Bahn, tickets of the Verkehrs- Gemeinschaft Landkreis Freudenstadt (vgf) are valid on the entire G√§u Railway.

Early life and military career Born in Highworth, Wiltshire, he was educated at Harrow School, where he represented the school cricket team. In the First World War, Buller served in the initially Devonshire Regiment. In May 1915, he was listed in the London Gazette as having attended the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, passing out to be commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant into the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry. In the January 1917 Supplement to the London Gazette, Buller was listed as being promoted to temporary Lieutenant from the rank of 2nd Lieutenant that he held, this time in the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry. During the course of the Great War he was awarded the Military Cross. He later served in the 2nd Battalion Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry as part of the British Rhine Army occupying the Rhineland. He eventually retired from the Army at some point prior to the Second World War, holding the rank of Major. Cricket career Buller made his only first-class appearance following the war for the Army against the Cambridge University at Fenner's in 1919. In this match he scored 46 runs in the Army first-innings, before being dismissed by Arthur Gilligan. In their second-innings he scored an unbeaten 12 runs. With the ball he claimed 11 wicket-less overs. Buller played for the British Rhine Army, the occupying British force in Rhine Land, in 1922 against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Cologne. In 1924, he made his Minor Counties Championship debut for Devon against the Surrey Second XI. He represented Devon until 1926, and returned in 1931 to play a single match against Cornwall. Personal life On 22 July 1922, he married Dorothy Bridget Tyrwhitt-Drake, with whom he had three daughters, Tresilla, Margaret and Belinda. Tresilla married Lt.-Col.

In 480 AD Abba arrived in Axum, the first great capital city of Ethiopia, as well as other 9 saints from different parts of the Rome Empire.

The principle to Bio-Feedback is very similar to DVF. Bio-Feedback, which is a process that enables an individual to learn how to change physiological activity for the purposes of improving health and performance by receiving rapid feedback from precise instruments which are measuring physiological activity such as brainwaves, heart function, breathing, muscle activity, and skin temperature. Direct Visual Feedback's method applies more directly to improving exterior physical health and performance. Instead of using technically advanced measuring instruments for feedback, DVF relies on the human eye. One method that has been used to test DVF is by placing a laser beam on the hand and connecting it to a monitor, when the trainee raises his arm from waist height to shoulder height he is focused on the external reference showing exactly what path the arm took from point A(waist height) to point B(shoulder height). Studies have shown that not only is a higher level of performance often achieved faster with an external rather than an internal attention focus, but the skill is retained better.

According to The New York Times, she was the first woman to attempt a hunger strike in the United States. Biography Edelsohn was born in 1892 in Odessa, Ukraine.She listed herself as age 21 in the 1910 United States Federal Census; however, the Hebrew Orphan Asylum listed \\"Rebecca Edelsohn\\" as born about 1892 in their records. Her family came to the United States when she was one or two years old. Later, she spent some time living in the Hebrew Orphan Asylum of New York. She was discharged from the orphanage on May 14, 1902. As a teenager, she lived in Emma Goldman's home. In 1906, after Alexander Berkman's release from prison, Edelsohn became his close companion and, the following year, his lover. She was arrested in 1906 at a meeting to discuss Leon Czolgosz. She was arrested again at an International Brotherhood Welfare Association meeting at Cooper Union on Labor Day, 1908. She was arrested again on May 23, 1909, along with Leopold Bergman and charged with disorderly conduct. In 1911, Ben Reitman performed an illegal abortion for her. Following the Ludlow Massacre in 1914, Edelsohn helped to lead anti-Rockefeller demonstrations in Tarrytown, New York. On the first day of demonstrations, Edelsohn, Arthur Caron, Charles Plunkett, and other anarchists were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct after giving speeches at the public square. At her hearing, Edelsohn was specifically cited for calling John D. Rockefeller, Jr. a \\"multi-murderer\\". The demonstrators rejected legal counsel and furiously pleaded their own defense, with Edelsohn at the forefront of the group. She denounced the charges as politically motivated, and scornfully dismissed the court as illegitimate: \\"This town is owned by John D. Rockefeller. We don't expect justice here.\\" She was jailed at Blackwell's Island where she refused to accept any nourishment other than water. In a letter smuggled to Alexander Berkman, she wrote, \\"I am still sticking to my programme, having fasted over twenty-seven days. I am very weak.\\" This letter prompted Edelsohn's friends to raise the $300 necessary to post a bond for her release. Edelsohn married fellow anarchist Charles Plunkett after World War I. Their marriage lasted nine years. The couple had a son. Edelsohn died of emphysema in 1973. Legacy Maurice Hollod, an anarchist associated with Mother Earth and the New York Ferrer Center, remembered marching with Edelsohn in a 1972 interview with anarchist historian Paul Avrich: > A black flag was flying, and Becky Edelsohn was marching arm in arm with > Charles Plunkett.

Subsidised tuition for members of participating civilian flying clubs was offered in exchange for an 'honorable undertaking' that in an emergency members would serve in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve. Members of this Civil Air Guard had a dark blue boiler uniform (usually privately purchased) and badges supplied for distinction. When civil aviation ceased not long before the war began in September 1939, most members of the Civil Air Guard enlisted in either the Royal Air Force or the Fleet Air Arm. The Civil Air Guard scheme On 23 July 1938, Sir Kingsley Wood, Secretary of State for Air, announced the creation of the Civil Air Guard scheme. Its intention was to provide pilots who could assist the Royal Air Force in a time of emergency. The scheme was civilian in nature and established in conjunction with local flying clubs. Membership was open to any person between the ages of 18 and 50 years. The Air Ministry already offered a grant of ¬£25 to pilot members of flying clubs who obtained an 'A' type licence. As part of the new scheme, if they volunteered for the Civil Air Guard, the grant would be increased to ¬£50 for those trained on standard types of aircraft or ¬£30 for aircraft that are lighter than . Includes a list of 74 clubs that applied. The renewal grant would be increased from ¬£10 to ¬£15. Members would receive flying training at subsidised rates of either 2s 6d or 5s an hour during the week, and 5s or 10s at weekends. The maximum subsidy of ¬£2000 for each club would not apply to those in the Air Guard. The Air Ministry also lifted a restriction on the use of foreign aircraft for training by the flying clubs. Previously, only British-built aircraft could be used if the club wanted Ministry subsidies. = Governance of the scheme = To control the organisation, five commissioners were appointed. The Chairman of the Commissioners was Lord Londonderry and the Commissioners were: # Air Commodore John Adrian Chamier (Secretary for the Commissioners) # William Lindsay Everard (a Member of Parliament) # Major Alan Goodfellow (former First World War pilot, and Chairman of the Royal Aero Club and the General Council of Associated Light Aeroplane Clubs) # Maxine (Blossom) Miles (aviator and aircraft designer) # Robert Murray (President of the Glasgow Corporation Transport Flying Club). The Commissioners held their first meeting on 29 August 1938 at Ariel House, Strand in London.  Popularity and evolution of the Civil Air Guard  The organisation already had 23,647 members with the 75 flying clubs in the scheme. The first training flight commenced on 1 September 1938. At the time, 1,500 (6%) of the existing 23,647 members were available for training. Within a few weeks of the Air Ministry July announcement more than 13,350 new people had inquired about joining, although only 6,900 had actually enrolled in a flying club. Later, on 8 October 1938, the Air Ministry announced that over 30,000 applications had been received. The scheme had created a demand for more flying instructors so the Air Ministry created a temporary Assistant Flying Instructor certificate that could be obtained after just 100 hours solo flying, rather than 250 hours for the full certificate. On 24 January 1939, as the prospect of war became more imminent, Civil Air Guard licence holders were classed into three groups: #Class \\"A\\", subdivided as: #*Class A1 - Men between 18 and 30 years who might become service pilots in wartime #*Class A2 - Men over 30 years with instructional experience, or considerable flying experience who might become service pilots or instructors. #Class \\"B\\" - Men between 18 and 40 years, who for various reasons would not be considered as Class \\"A\\", who might be able to do other service flying duties such as wireless operator, air gunner or observer. #Class \\"C\\" - Men not in A or B, and all women, who might be suitable as ferry pilots, air ambulance or general communications pilots. Members who could not classed in any of these groups were advised to look for some other form of national service. Selected members of all three groups would get additional subsidised training and were known as starred groups. Class A starred members would also get Royal Air Force medicals. As the war approached, civil flying ceased and most members of the Civil Air Guard enlisted in either the Royal Air Force or the Fleet Air Arm. Some of the women Civil Air Guard members went on to join the Air Transport Auxiliary. Other members were used for special duties in both military and civil aviation, or moved on to other non-aviation war duties.

The skywalks that circle the structure were the first of its kind found on a parking center and was one of the few 'modern' parking facilities with a roof, a realistic and sensible solution given the climate of the region. The design separated pedestrian and automobile entrances and exits, a consideration not found on similar parking garages of the time period. Floors in the garage are sloped to allow for maximum parking spaces, the architect commented, ‚ÄúAll the floors are sloping in this thing ‚Äì parking structures aren't easy to design.‚Äù\\"Parkade Is Attractive Structure.\\" Spokesman Review [Spokane] 17 Mar. 1967: 16.

Light arches, a 'working arch', creates a wide overhang at the top, protecting the white outer walls and shielding the structure from bad weather. A striking feature of the center is its sculptured tower extending 175 feet above the ground and far above the main structure. Its major function is housing the mechanisms for the passenger elevators. The tower also serves as a beacon to motorists, signaling a safe place to park their vehicles.

Riverkeeper, Inc., 556 U.S. 208 (2009), is a decision by the United States Supreme Court that reviewed the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) interpretation of the Clean Water Act regulations with regard to cooling water intakes for power plants. Existing facilities are mandated to use the \\"Best Technology Available\\" to \\"minimize the adverse environmental impact.\\". The issue was whether the agency may use a cost‚Äìbenefit analysis (CBA) in choosing the Best Available Technology or (BAT) to meet the National Performance Standards (NPS). Reversing a lower court opinion, the 5-1-3 ruling upheld the EPA's decision as reasonable to allow CBA to determine BAT to maintain national environmental standards. Parties Petitioner: Entergy Corporation is an energy company engaged primarily in electric power production and retail electric distribution operations. Entergy owns and operates both nuclear and fossil fuel power plants generating an aggregated 30,000 megawatts of electrical capacity. Indian Point Energy Center is a subsidiary of Entergy Corporation operating a three-unit nuclear power plant in Buchanan, New York, the facility at issue in this case.http://www.entergy.com Respondent: Riverkeeper is a member-supported environmental protection organization dedicated to defending the Hudson River and its tributaries for New York City and Hudson Valley residents. Over the past four decades Riverkeeper has been successful as the public's watchdog in bringing hundreds of pollution violations to justice and protecting drinking water for local communities. Riverkeeper has an ongoing interest in replacing Indian Point nuclear power plant with renewable energy.http://www.riverkeeper.org/about-us/our-story/ This case is a consolidation of three cases for review by the Supreme Court Entergy Corporation v. Riverkeeper, Inc., et al. PSEG Fossil LLC, et al., v. Riverkeeper, Inc., et al. Utility Water Act Group, v. Riverkeeper, Inc., et al. Background Among the ten major environmental regulatory statutes enacted from the 1960s through the 1980s only the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) granted authority to weigh the cost and benefits in determining policy requirements. The remainder of the regulations rely mainly on harm-based or technology-based methodologies that clearly exclude cost‚Äìbenefit analysis (CBA) or at a minimum do not provide for it. The Clean Water Act statute uses technology based methods to meet its standards. (See Note 1.) Three pre- Entergy Supreme Court decisions offer historical guidance into the possible crafting of the CBA canon. Each of them address the priority of environmental health and safety concerns with the appropriate level of cost-benefit analysis. * In Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill the Court interpreted section 7 of the Endangered Species Act as discontinuing the construction of the Tellico Dam after the project was more than 80 percent complete and had spent over $50 million in order to save the snail darter (an unknown species at the time). * In American Textile Manufacturers Institute, Inc. v. Donovan the court addressed whether the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) could adopt cost‚Äìbenefit analysis with regards to cotton dust standards for employees. The Court ruled that CBA was not authorized by the statute because feasibility analysis was authorized. * In Whitman v. American Trucking Associations, Inc., the Court held that section 109 of the Clean Air Act (CAA) prohibited cost considerations when setting the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) In a unanimous Court, Justice Scalia considered that section 109 requires the public to be protected with \\"an adequate margin of safety\\" and that the CAA had specific reference to cost considerations in related provisions but not with setting the NAAQS. Various States and environmental groups challenged the Bush Administration Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) recent interpretation of ¬ß 316(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA), 33 U.S.C. ¬ß1326(b), that allowed exceptions to power plants that diverged from national standards. The claim against the EPA was that the agency unreasonably interpreted the regulations of the CWA when it determined that cost‚Äìbenefit analysis was a method that could be used to determine the BAT when minimizing the adverse effects of cooling water intakes from power plants. This new interpretation of the statute allows for cost to influence the choice of \\"best technology available\\" lowering the standard reduction of \\"adverse environmental impact.\\" Statute and regulations Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act requires that permittees under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) that operate facilities with cooling water intake structures ensure that the location, design, construction, and capacity of their structures reflect the best technology available to minimize detrimental impacts to the environment. The intake structures remove billions of aquatic organisms each year from United States waterways. Most impacts are in early life stages of fish, crustaceans, and other aquatic life. Prior case The case preceding this Supreme Court case was decided in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. This court heard Riverkeeper, Inc. v. EPA, in 2006 and decided the case in 2007. Then-Circuit Judge Sotomayor wrote the opinion for the court. In this decision the court stated that in order to meet the statute facilities could not use restoration enhancements (restocking fish, restoring habitat, etc.) to meet the National Performance Standard (NPS). Additionally, the court remanded the case to the EPA for clarification of EPA rules regarding NPS determination by CBA and the use of a variance for facilities claiming excessive costs to implement mandated technology. And most importantly to this case, the court decided that a CBA is not consistent with the requirement or using the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact. The statutory language requires the EPA's selection of BAT be driven by technology. Cost can only be used to determine if remediation can be reasonably borne by the industry and determining the specific technology that meets the standards at the lowest cost. Thus suspending this aspect of Phase II as stated above. This case Petitioner's existing power plants have cooling water intake structures that threaten freshwater aquatic life by compression against intake screens (impingement) or suctioning organisms into the cooling system (entrainment). They challenge the Second Circuit decision in Riverkeeper v. EPA 2007 (see prior case above) that CBA cannot be used in interpretation of the Clean Water Act statute to determine NPS and BAT for existing power plants. Respondents support the Second Circuit's finding that the EPA's decision of site-specific cost‚Äìbenefit variance provision and the use of CBA to determine NPS and BAT for existing facilities is not within the statute and remand the regulations to the agency for clarification. Adverse environmental impact The process of pulling water into a facility from a natural body of water for use in industrial cooling can have a significant effect on living organisms in that body of water. Estimates for 2004 show that in just one day industry can pull as much as of water into facilities for cooling purposes. The pressure and flow of this large volume of water can impinge large organisms like fish against intake points or entrain small organisms like plankton, eggs and larvae into the cooling system killing or injuring them. A single power plant can impinge a million adult fish in just three weeks. One plant can entrain some 3 - 4 billion smaller fish and shellfish in a year. This can have a destabilizing effect on local ecosystems. Nationwide, \\"the impingement and entrainment reduction benefits range from $73 million to $83 million per year. These benefits are primarily from improvements to commercial and recreational fishing.\\" There are likely other benefits externalized in this equation such as higher functioning ecosystems, intrinsic value of non-fisheries species to name two. In light of these findings, when congress amended the Clean Water Act in 1972, it directed the EPA to regulate these systems so as to \\"minimize adverse environmental impact\\". As of 2014, there were 1065 existing facilities in the US that draw at least a day. EPA estimated that 521 are manufacturing facilities and 544 are power plants. EPA rule making Three Phases (rules) have been created over the years by the EPA in response from industry, environmental groups and judicial review to clarify exactly what is needed to meet the statute. Promulgated 1326(b) regulations making the best technology available determination on a case-by-case basis for both Phase I and Phase II facilities. * Phase I regulations (created in 2001) govern new cooling water intake structures and mandate closed-cycle cooling systems as BAT. * Phase II (2004) regulations apply generally to large existing facilities and outlines alternatives to closed-cycle cooling to meet reduction standards. * Phase III (2006) addresses certain existing facilities and new coastal and offshore facilities, not an issue in this case. The National Performance Standard (NPS), set by the EPA for new facilities is closed-cycle cooling systems, which can reduce impingement and entrainment by up to 98%. For existing facilities NPS in Phase II is \\"to reduce impingement mortality for all life stages of fish and shellfish by 80 to 95 percent from the calculation baseline; a subset of facilities must also reduce entrainment of such aquatic organisms by 60 to 90 percent from the calculation baseline.\\" In Phase II the EPA declined to specifically mandate closed-cycle cooling systems as BAT for existing facilities due to the compliant cost, which could be nine times the amount of other methods of reduction approaching the same standard. A cost‚Äìbenefit analysis is incorporated to determine the standard. Existing facilities have alternatives to meet these reduction standards including existing technologies, additional fish protection technologies, and restoration measures. Phase II rules outline these alternatives and also permit site-specific variances from the NPS and if the permitting agency imposes restrictions that render results \\"as close to practical to the applicable performance standards\\", using \\"Best Professional Judgement\\". Phase II update: In 2007 \\"EPA suspended the Cooling Water Intake Structure Regulations for existing large power plants as an unreasonable interpretation of the statute. This suspension was in response to the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals decision in Riverkeeper, Inc., v. EPA. (2007)\\" (see below for details). In 2011 the Supreme Court ruling stated that Phase II was a reasonable interpretation of the statute reversing the lower court ruling allowing the use of Phase II. Main issue - Best Available Technology - BAT The main issue for the court was to decide is if the Clean Water Act statute language is unambiguous or not and whether the EPA interpretations (rules - see below) were reasonable. At the heart of the issue is if the EPA is authorized to consider CBA in determining BAT when meeting the NPS to \\"minimize adverse environmental impact.\\" The EPA does not dictate what type of system existing facilities need to use, but determines the standard that must be met. As guidance they use the terminology \\"Best Available Technology\\" which is defined here as \\"Any standard ... applicable to a point source shall require that the location, design, construction, and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact.\\" Existing power plants of this type need to use an appropriate system that is the BAT that meets the standard of reduction. The EPA works with each facility to ensure compliance on a site by site basis and can issue variance under specific circumstances. The definition for BAT in the Clean Water Act does not include a CBA as part of the criteria for choosing this technology as it does in definitions of other types of technology for meeting different environmental health standards. Decision The judgment of the court of appeals is reversed and remanded. Justice Scalia delivers the opinion of the court. In a five justice majority opinion written by Justice Scalia, the Court overturns the Second Circuit's ruling and found that Congress did not speak directly to whether or not cost‚Äìbenefit analysis could be used in environmental standards under the \\"best technology available\\" verbiage. And found that the EPA's interpretation of the regulations to be reasonable. Four different CWA tests were mentioned in the opinion, however two received greater attention. One called for the use of \\"best available technology economically achievable\\" (BATEA) and the other test required the \\"best available demonstrated control technology\\" (BADT). The BATEA test was intended to allow progress toward the goal of eliminating the discharge of all pollutants. While the BADT test was applicable to new point sources and was aimed to advance the strategy of \\"where practicable\\", a standard allowing no pollutant discharges. The Court differentiated the BAT test from other tests on the basis of distinguishable language and interpreted the ambiguity to allow the agency greater discretion in determining the content of the test. (See Note 2.) In Whitman v. American Trucking Associations, Inc. the Court ruled that Congress was \\"unambiguously barred cost considerations\\" in setting air quality standards under section 109 of the Clean Air Act (CAA). The statute was silent on the issue because it had expressly allowed for the consideration of costs in other provisions of the act. However, concerning the CWA in regards to Entergy, the Court determined that statutory silence was not intended to limit the agency's discretion in consideration of a cost‚Äìbenefit analysis when determining compliance with national environmental standards. After determining that the statutes did not specifically address the \\"best technology available\\" language contained in the Clean Water Act, the second test was to determine if the agency's interpretation of the regulation was reasonable. This was in reference to the U.S. Supreme Courts decision in Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. otherwise known as \\"Chevron deference\\". This case granted deference to the administrative agency's interpretation of its own regulations if the congressional intent was unclear. Although the court did not address the quality of the agency's interpretation in Entergy, it did find EPA to be reasonable in its interpretation. Justice Breyer concurring in part and dissenting in part. Although Justice Breyer agrees with the Court concerning the use of a cost‚Äìbenefit analysis in determining environmental standards for water-intake systems, he also admonished the EPA for changing its stance on granting variances. Justice Breyer would have remanded the case to allow the EPA to explain the reasoning behind the change. In siding with the majority in Entergy, Justice Breyer acknowledges that Congress had a reason to limit the weight of cost‚Äìbenefit analysis for the following reasons. It may delay regulatory process, undervalue the true cost benefit of environmental externalities, and may reduce market incentives to developing advanced treatment technologies. However, on the other hand, forbidding CBA may lead to \\"irrational results\\" and since every \\"real choice\\" requires a comparison, an absolute prohibition would be difficult to enforce. Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting. Justice Stevens believed that Section 316(b) of the CWA prohibited the use of cost-benefit analysis based on the language and stated that Congress' intent was to play a temporal role for existing power plants until a more ambitious standard could be set. And declared that if a cost‚Äìbenefit analysis were to be done, monetize all aquatic life not just the 1.8 percent believed to have commercial or recreational value. EPA's estimate of aquatic life value was $83 million for less than 2% of aquatic life as opposed to a measured $735 million for all aquatic life. Held: The EPA permissibly relied on cost‚Äìbenefit analysis in setting the national performance standards in providing for cost‚Äìbenefit variances from those standards as part of the Phase II regulations. EPA's perspective is that 1326(b)'s \\"best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact\\" standard permits consideration of the technology costs and the relationship between the added cost and the related environmental benefit. EPA needs to demonstrate that it has a reasonable interpretation of the statute, not necessarily the only possible interpretation or even the interpretation deemed best by the courts. Future implications * The United States Supreme Court issued an important decision interpreting Federal Water Pollution Control Act section 316(b) to allow the United States Environmental Protection Agency to include cost/benefit considerations in establishing technology-based requirements for cooling water intake structures. * Part of EPA's Phase II regulations are upheld so there will be greater regulatory certainty for industry and federal and state agencies. With this judgment here will also be greater regulatory flexibility for industry. However, this regulatory flexibility also may result in significant environmental harm as facilities are not required to implement technology that arguably is the most protective of the nation's waterways. * New EPA Rule. As a result of the Supreme Court remand, EPA issued a final rule in 2014 to further clarify requirements for cooling water intake structures at existing power plants and factories. The rule affects about 1065 existing facilities, and requires them to select one of seven technology options.EPA (2014-08-15). \\"National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System‚ÄîFinal Regulations To Establish Requirements for Cooling Water Intake Structures at Existing Facilities and Amend Requirements at Phase I Facilities.\\" Federal Register, . * Entergy v Riverkeeper designates an important move in the Court's orientation towards increasing the weight of CBA with Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) regulations. Entergy joins a list of recent Supreme Court rulings that seem aimed at rebalancing the perceived excesses of strict EHS legislation of the 1960s, 1970s, and the 1980s Five major environmental decisions from 2008 to 2009, including Entergy, have resulted in adverse environmental decisions.

History The agency was founded in 1976 in Milwaukee, and it entered the Chicago market in 1998 and New York in 2009. Founded as Frankenberry, Laughlin, Bernstein & Persa, changes in partnership led the agency to the name Laughlin Constable in 1992. Laughlin Constable began as an advertising and added public relations services in 1978. It was named one of the nation's fastest-growing agencies by Adweek in 1993. In 1998, Laughlin Constable purchased N.W. Ayer and opened an office in Chicago. In 2005, it acquired the Chicago PR agency Grant/Jacoby. Then, in 2007, the agency acquired GreenHouse, a Chicago-based boutique agency. Soon after, the agency acquired Kohnke Hanneken, an agency that was profiled in Communication Arts. In 2008, Laughlin Constable developed a strategic alliance with Mobium, a Chicago business-to-business agency that received much recognition, including Top Agency of 2006 by Crain Communications‚Äô BtoB Magazine. Then, in 2009, the agency's New York office was opened through the integration of Partners & Jeary. In 2012, Laughlin Constable acquired the Milwaukee-based interactive marketing agency Fullhouse, as well as Milwaukee PR firm Zeppos & Associates. Laughlin Constable also expanded in March 2013 by acquiring New York and New Jersey agency, Filter Advertising. Notable work In mid-2012, Laughlin Constable launched the No One Deserves to Die viral advertising campaign for the Lung Cancer Alliance. The goal of the campaign was to challenge the stigma associated with lung cancer: that people who have it, deserve it. The campaign proved extremely polarizing, sparking coverage in countless major news outlets across the country, including Time, Salon, Perez Hilton and Adweek. Media was placed in 31 markets across the country, from telephone booths and bus shelters to cinema spots and online ads. In 2011‚Äì2012, Laughlin Constable created a television spot for the Wisconsin Department of Tourism with comedy director David Zucker. The commercial was filmed at the Riverside Theater and featured the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra. Milwaukee-based Marcus Theatres also donated time to air a longer director's cut of the spot. For Associated Bank, Laughlin Constable created a series of comedic television spots starring Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers. The integrated program promoted Associated Bank's Packers checking account. Laughlin Constable was also responsible for the launch of Miller Sharps non- alcoholic beer, cited as the \\"best in category\\" campaign two years in a row by Adweek magazine. Workplace Laughlin Constable has offices in two cities. The Milwaukee office is located in the Mitchell Building in downtown Milwaukee, where the agency occupies five floors and the penthouse. The structure, built in the French Second Empire Style, was designed by Milwaukee architect Edward Townsend Mix and built in 1876. In 1973, the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Only traces of the original interiors remain, but the exterior has been thoroughly preserved. The building, including the agency's space, was featured by Historic Milwaukee in 2011 in the inaugural Doors Open Milwaukee program. The agency has been a member of the American Association of Advertising Agencies (4A's) since 1978, and Laughlin Constable staff members sit on several 4A's committees, including Digital Production, Agency Finance, Human Resource Management, New Business and Project Management. The Chicago office is located on Michigan Avenue. The workplace was designed by Gary Lee Partners and was published in Interior Design magazine's Best in Office Design book. The space is wide-open, divided into courtyards of workstations and lounges. The office has been lauded for its tattoo-inspired floor, which depicts undersea motifs. Laughlin Constable appeared on Ad Age‚Äôs Best Places to Work list in 2012. The agency received the Alfred P. Sloan Award for Business Excellence in Workplace Flexibility in both Chicago and Milwaukee, and it has been named one of the Top 100 Workplaces by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel for several years.

Remontancy is the ability of a plant to flower more than once during the course of a growing season or year. It is a term applied most specifically to roses, and roses possessing this ability are called \\"repeat flowering\\" or remontant. The term originated in the nineteenth century from the French verb remonter or 'coming up again'.Dictionary of the English Language, Collins, 1979, p1235 Roses which lack this ability are termed \\"summer flowering\\", \\"once flowering\\" or non-remontant. Few wild rose species possess remontancy; notable exceptions being Rosa chinensis, Rosa rugosa and Rosa fedtschenkoana. As remontancy is considered a desirable horticultural characteristic, it is preferentially selected for by rose hybridisers. Remontant roses descended from Rosa chinensis have been grown in China for at least a thousand years,Quest-Ritson, C. & Quest-Ritson, B., The Royal Horticultural Society Encyclopedia of Roses, Dorling Kindersley, 2003. but the first garden roses in Europe to possess remontancy were the autumn damasks, which first appeared in the seventeenth century with the introduction of the cultivar 'Quatre Saisons'. Recent DNA research has shown that these damask roses resulted from crosses involving Rosa gallica, Rosa moschata and the remontant central Asian species Rosa fedtschenkoana. When forms of Rosa chinensis were introduced into Europe in the late eighteenth century, subsequent hybridisation between these and the European roses eventually led to the wide variety of remontant garden hybrids which are available today.

From 1894 to 1954 it was part of a hunting club, which soon evolved into a major polo club. After the original grounds were expropriated for urban development, the club moved to its present location and became primarily a golf club. The Meadowbrook Polo Club is now a separate entity. Origins The club originated as the Meadow Brook Hunt Club, established in 1881 in Westbury, New York and home of the Meadow Brook Hounds. The hunt club had its headquarters in Westbury, but convened in different rural parts of Nassau County where the hounds and horses could run free. Future President Theodore Roosevelt was a member of the hunt club, which met at his home in Oyster Bay in 1886. The members sometimes hunted foxes, but often drag hunted, where the hounds followed a trail of anise scent. The Hunt Club gave birth to the Meadowbrook Polo Club, whose founders included the polo player and millionaire Thomas Hitchcock, Sr. (1862-1941). Hitchcock was one of the founders of the Meadow Brook steeplechase races in 1883, and in 1889 became master of the Meadow Brook Hunt. The club in Westbury had eight polo fields, and was the leading polo center in the United States. During the first half of the 20th century the polo club was often the site for national or international polo championships. First course A nine-hole golf course was built for the Meadow Brook Club in 1894. It was located in Hempstead, New York. In 1895 the first national women's golf tournament was held at Meadow Brook. The winner was Lucy Barnes, wife of Charles S. Brown, with 132 strokes for the eighteen-hole match. The club became an early member of the United States Golf Association. On 31 March 1897 the Metropolitan Golf Association was formed at Delmonico's in New York City, at first called the Metropolitan League of Golf Clubs. Oliver W. Bird of Meadow Brook Golf Club was a member of the five-person formation committee. In 1936 Sam Snead won two matches at the Meadow Brook Club, earning a $10,000 fee. This gave him the money he needed to start playing professionally full time. Present course The original polo ground and golf course was requisitioned by New York City Park Commissioner Robert Moses for a parkway extension. The Meadowbrook State Parkway extension of 1954 cut through the club property from north to south. The polo club moved to Post Road in Old Westbury, New York, in 1954. A new entity was formed, now called the Meadowbrook Polo Club, which continued to arrange polo matches on Long Island. In the 1990s it hosted two U.S. Open Championships at Bethpage State Park. A new site for a golf course in Jericho, New York was selected in October 1953 by Dick Wilson, the architect of the course. Wilson drew up plans for the course in just six weeks. Construction began in April 1954 by Troup Brothers of Miami, who undertook the heavy-duty earth movement. Irrigation and drainage pipes and tile beds were installed in the summer, and grass sown in the fall. Seaside bent was used for the greens and a mix of Astoria bent and Chewings fescue for the fairways. With the move to Jericho the Meadow Brook Club changed into a golf club. The course was officially opened for play on 4 June 1955. The course has championship tees up to in length. It has been host to regional tournaments such as the Metropolitan PGA Championships, the Metropolitan Open and the Lightpath Long Island Classic. Recently Tripp Davis renovated the course, placing more emphasis on interest than on challenge.

Liouville theory is defined for all complex values of the central charge c of its Virasoro symmetry algebra, but it is unitary only if :cin(1,+infty), and its classical limit is : cto +infty. Although it is an interacting theory with a continuous spectrum, Liouville theory has been solved. In particular, its three-point function on the sphere has been determined analytically. Parameters Liouville theory has a background charge Q and coupling constant b that are related to the central charge c by : c = 1 + 6 Q^2 quad , quad Q = b+frac{1}{b}  . States and fields are characterized by a momentum alpha that is related to the conformal dimension Delta by : Delta = alpha(Q-alpha)  . The coupling constant and the momentum are the natural parameters for writing correlation functions in Liouville theory. However, the duality : b to frac{1}{b} , leaves the central charge invariant, and therefore also leaves the correlation functions invariant. The conformal dimension is invariant under the reflection transformation : alpha to Q- alpha , and the correlation functions are covariant under reflection. Spectrum and correlation functions =Spectrum= The spectrum mathcal{S} of Liouville theory is a diagonal combination of Verma modules of the Virasoro algebra, : mathcal{S} = int_{frac{c-1}{24} + mathbb{R}_+} dDelta mathcal{V}_Delta otimes bar{mathcal{V}}_Delta , where mathcal{V}_Delta and bar{mathcal{V}}_Delta denote the same Verma module, viewed as a representation of the left- and right-moving Virasoro algebra respectively. In terms of momentums, :Delta in frac{c-1}{24} + mathbb{R}_+ corresponds to :alphain frac{Q}{2}+imathbb{R}. Liouville theory is unitary if and only if cin (1,+infty). The spectrum of Liouville theory does not include a vacuum state. A vacuum state can be defined, but it does not contribute to operator product expansions. =Fields and reflection relation= In Liouville theory, primary fields are usually parametrized by their momentum rather than their conformal dimension, and denoted V_alpha(z). Both fields V_alpha(z) and V_{Q-alpha}(z) correspond to the primary state of the representation mathcal{V}_Delta otimes bar{mathcal{V}}_Delta , and are related by the reflection relation : V_alpha(z) = R(alpha) V_{Q-alpha}(z) , where the reflection coefficient is : R(alpha) = pm lambda^{Q-2alpha} frac{Gamma(b(2alpha-Q))Gamma(frac{1}{b}(2alpha-Q))}{Gamma(b(Q-2alpha))Gamma(frac{1}{b}(Q-2alpha))} . (The sign is +1 if cin(-infty, 1) and -1 otherwise, and the normalization parameter lambda is arbitrary.) =Correlation functions and DOZZ formula= For c otin (-infty, 1), the three-point structure constant is given by the DOZZ formula (for Dorn-Otto and Zamolodchikov-Zamolodchikov), : C_{alpha_1,alpha_2,alpha_3} = frac{left[b^{frac{2}{b}-2b}lambdaright]^{Q-alpha_1-alpha_2-alpha_3}Upsilon_b'(0) Upsilon_b(2alpha_1) Upsilon_b(2alpha_2) Upsilon_b(2alpha_3)}{Upsilon_b(alpha_1+alpha_2+alpha_3-Q) Upsilon_b(alpha_1+alpha_2-alpha_3)Upsilon_b(alpha_2+alpha_3-alpha_1)Upsilon_b(alpha_3+alpha_1-alpha_2)} , where the special function Upsilon_b is a kind of multiple gamma function. For cin (-infty, 1), the three-point structure constant is : hat{C}_{alpha_1,alpha_2,alpha_3} = frac{left[(ib)^{frac{2}{b}-2b}lambdaright]^{Q-alpha_1-alpha_2-alpha_3}hat{Upsilon}_b(0) hat{Upsilon}_b(2alpha_1) hat{Upsilon}_b(2alpha_2) hat{Upsilon}_b(2alpha_3)}{hat{Upsilon}_b(alpha_1+alpha_2+alpha_3-Q) hat{Upsilon}_b(alpha_1+alpha_2-alpha_3)hat{Upsilon}_b(alpha_2+alpha_3-alpha_1)hat{Upsilon}_b(alpha_3+alpha_1-alpha_2)} , where : hat{Upsilon}_b(x) = frac{1}{Upsilon_{ib}(-ix+ib)} . N-point functions on the sphere can be expressed in terms of three-point structure constants, and conformal blocks. An N-point function may have several different expressions: that they agree is equivalent to crossing symmetry of the four-point function, which has been checked numerically and proved analytically. Liouville theory exists not only on the sphere, but also on any Riemann surface of genus ggeq 1. Technically, this is equivalent to the modular invariance of the torus one-point function. Due to remarkable identities of conformal blocks and structure constants, this modular invariance property can be deduced from crossing symmetry of the sphere four- point function. =Uniqueness of Liouville theory= Using the conformal bootstrap approach, Liouville theory can be shown to be the unique conformal field theory such that * the spectrum is a continuum, with no multiplicities higher than one, * the correlation functions depend analytically on b and the momentums, * degenerate fields exist. Lagrangian formulation =Action and equation of motion= Liouville theory is defined by the local action : S[phi] = frac{1}{4pi } int d^2x sqrt{g} (g^{mu u} partial_mu phi partial _{ u} phi + Q R phi + lambda' e^{2bphi }) , where g_{mu u} is the metric of the two-dimensional space on which the theory is formulated, R is the Ricci scalar of that space, and the field phi is called the Liouville field. The parameter lambda', which is sometimes called the cosmological constant, is related to the parameter lambda that appears in correlation functions by : lambda' =4 frac{Gamma(1-b^2)}{Gamma(b^2)} lambda^b . The equation of motion associated to this action is : Delta phi(x) = frac {1}{2} Q R(x) + lambda' b e^{2bphi (x)}  , where Delta = g^{-1/2} partial _{mu} (g^{1/2} g^{mu u} partial_{ u} ) is the Laplace‚ÄìBeltrami operator. If g_{mu u} is the Euclidean metric, this equation reduces to : left(frac{partial ^2}{partial x_1^2} + frac{partial ^2}{partial x_2^2} right) phi (x_1,x_2) = lambda' b e^{2b phi (x_1,x_2)}  , which is equivalent to Liouville's equation. =Conformal symmetry= Using a complex coordinate system z and a Euclidean metric :g_{mu u}dx^mu dx^ u= dzdbar{z} , the energy-momentum tensor's components obey : T_{zbar{z}} = T_{bar{z}z} = 0 quad , quad partial_{bar{z}} T_{zz} = 0 quad ,quad partial_z T_{bar{z}bar{z}}=0 . The non-vanishing components are : T=T_{zz} = (partial_z phi)^2 + Q partial_z^2 phi quad ,quad bar T = T_{bar z bar z} = (partial_{bar z}phi)^2 + Q partial_{bar z}^2 phi  . Each one of these two components generates a Virasoro algebra with the central charge :c = 1+ 6Q^2. For both of these Virasoro algebras, a field e^{2alpha phi} is a primary field with the conformal dimension :Delta = alpha(Q-alpha). For the theory to have conformal invariance, the field e^{2bphi} that appears in the action must be marginal, i.e. have the conformal dimension :Delta(b) = 1. This leads to the relation :Q = b+frac{1}{b} between the background charge and the coupling constant. If this relation is obeyed, then e^{2bphi} is actually exactly marginal, and the theory is conformally invariant. =Path integral= The path integral representation of an N-point correlation function of primary fields is : leftlangleprod_{i=1}^N V_{alpha_i}(z_i)rightrangle = int Dphi e^{-S[phi]} prod_{i=1}^N e^{2alpha_iphi(z_i)} . It has been difficult to define and to compute this path integral. In the path integral representation, it is not obvious that Liouville theory has exact conformal invariance, and it is not manifest that correlation functions are invariant under bto b^{-1} and obey the reflection relation. Nevertheless, the path integral representation can be used for computing the residues of correlation functions at some of their poles as Dotsenko-Fateev integrals (i.e. Coulomb gas integrals), and this is how the DOZZ formula was first guessed in the 1990s. It is only in the 2010s that a rigorous probabilistic construction of the path integral was found, which led to a proof of the DOZZ formula and the conformal bootstrap. Relations with other conformal field theories =Some limits of Liouville theory= When the central charge and conformal dimensions are sent to the relevant discrete values, correlation functions of Liouville theory reduce to correlation functions of diagonal (A-series) Virasoro minimal models. On the other hand, when the central charge is sent to one while conformal dimensions stay continuous, Liouville theory tends to Runkel-Watts theory, a nontrivial conformal field theory (CFT) with a continuous spectrum whose three-point function is not analytic as a function of the momentums. Generalizations of Runkel-Watts theory are obtained from Liouville theory by taking limits of the type b^2 otin mathbb{R}, b^2 to mathbb{Q}_{<0} . So, for b^2 inmathbb{Q}_{<0} , two distinct CFTs with the same spectrum are known: Liouville theory, whose three-point function is analytic, and another CFT with a non-analytic three-point function. =WZW models= Liouville theory can be obtained from the SL_2(mathbb{R}) Wess‚ÄìZumino‚ÄìWitten model by a quantum Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction. Moreover, correlation functions of the H_3^+ model (the Euclidean version of the SL_2(mathbb{R}) WZW model) can be expressed in terms of correlation functions of Liouville theory. This is also true of correlation functions of the 2d black hole SL_2/U_1 coset model. Moreover, there exist theories that continuously interpolate between Liouville theory and the H_3^+ model. =Conformal Toda theory= Liouville theory is the simplest example of a Toda field theory, associated to the A_1 Cartan matrix. More general conformal Toda theories can be viewed as generalizations of Liouville theory, whose Lagrangians involve several bosons rather than one boson phi, and whose symmetry algebras are W-algebras rather than the Virasoro algebra. =Supersymmetric Liouville theory= Liouville theory admits two different supersymmetric extensions called mathcal{N}=1 supersymmetric Liouville theory and mathcal{N}=2 supersymmetric Liouville theory. Applications =Liouville gravity= In two dimensions, the Einstein equations reduce to Liouville's equation, so Liouville theory provides a quantum theory of gravity that is called Liouville gravity. It should not be confused with the CGHS model or Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. =String theory= Liouville theory appears in the context of string theory when trying to formulate a non-critical version of the theory in the path integral formulation. Also in the string theory context, if coupled to a free bosonic field, Liouville field theory can be thought of as the theory describing string excitations in a two-dimensional space(time). =Other applications= Liouville theory is related to other subjects in physics and mathematics, such as three-dimensional general relativity in negatively curved spaces, the uniformization problem of Riemann surfaces, and other problems in conformal mapping. It is also related to instanton partition functions in a certain four-dimensional superconformal gauge theories by the AGT correspondence. Naming confusion for cleq 1 Liouville theory with cleq 1 first appeared as a model of time-dependent string theory under the name timelike Liouville theory. It has also been called a generalized minimal model. It was first called Liouville theory when it was found to actually exist, and to be spacelike rather than timelike. As of 2020, not one of these three names is universally accepted.

A Stirling engine is a heat engine operating by cyclic compression and expansion of air or other gas, the \\"working fluid\\", at different temperature levels such that there is a net conversion of heat to mechanical work. The Stirling cycle heat engine can also be driven in reverse, using a mechanical energy input to drive heat transfer in a reversed direction (i.e. a heat pump, or refrigerator). There are several design configurations for Stirling engines that can be built (many of which require rotary or sliding seals) which can introduce difficult tradeoffs between frictional losses and refrigerant leakage. A free-piston variant of the Stirling engine can be built, which can be completely hermetically sealed, reducing friction losses and completely eliminating refrigerant leakage. For example, a Free Piston Stirling Cooler (FPSC) can convert an electrical energy input into a practical heat pump effect, used for high-efficiency portable refrigerators and freezers. Conversely, a free-piston electrical generator could be built, converting a heat flow into mechanical energy, and then into electricity. In both cases, energy is usually converted from/to electrical energy using magnetic fields in a way that avoids compromising the hermetic seal.  Mechanical output and propulsion  = Automotive engines = It is often claimed that the Stirling engine has too low a power/weight ratio, too high a cost, and too long a starting time for automotive applications. They also have complex and expensive heat exchangers. A Stirling cooler must reject twice as much heat as an Otto engine or Diesel engine radiator. The heater must be made of stainless steel, exotic alloy or ceramic to support high heating temperatures needed for high power density, and to contain hydrogen gas that is often used in automotive Stirlings to maximize power. The main difficulties involved in using the Stirling engine in an automotive application are startup time, acceleration response, shutdown time, and weight, not all of which have ready-made solutions. However, a modified Stirling engine has been introduced that uses concepts taken from a patented internal-combustion engine with a sidewall combustion chamber (US patent 7,387,093) that promises to overcome the deficient power-density and specific-power problems, as well as the slow acceleration-response problem inherent in all Stirling engines. It could be possible to use these in co-generation systems that use waste heat from a conventional piston or gas turbine engine's exhaust and use this either to power the ancillaries (e.g.: the alternator) or even as a turbo-compound system that adds power and torque to the crankshaft. Automobiles exclusively powered by Stirling engines were developed in test projects by NASA, as well as earlier projects by the Ford Motor Company using engines provided by Philips, and by American Motors Corporation (AMC) with several cars equipped with units from Sweden's United Stirling built under a license from Philips. The NASA vehicle test projects were designed by contractors and designated MOD I and MOD II. NASA's Stirling MOD 1 powered engineering vehicles were built in partnership with the United States Department of Energy (DOE) and NASA, under contract by AMC's AM General to develop and demonstrate practical alternatives for standard engines. The United Stirling AB's P-40 powered AMC Spirit was tested extensively for over and achieved average fuel efficiency up to . A 1980 4-door liftback VAM Lerma was also converted to United Stirling P-40 power to demonstrate the Stirling engine to the public and to promote the U.S. government's alternative engine program. Tests conducted with the 1979 AMC Spirit, as well as a 1977 Opel and a 1980 AMC Concord revealed the Stirling engines \\"could be developed into an automotive power train for passenger vehicles and that it could produce favorable results.\\" However, progress was achieved with equal-power spark-ignition engines since 1977, and the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) requirements that were to be achieved by automobiles sold in the U.S. were being increased. Moreover, the Stirling engine design continued to exhibit a shortfall in fuel efficiency There were also two major drawbacks for consumers using the Stirling engines: first was the time needed to warm up ‚Äì because most drivers do not like to wait to start driving; and second was the difficulty in changing the engine's speed ‚Äì thus limiting driving flexibility on the road and traffic. The process of auto manufacturers converting their existing facilities and tooling for the mass production of a completely new design and type of powerplant was also questioned. The MOD II project in 1980 produced one of the most efficient automotive engines ever made. The engine reached a peak thermal efficiency of 38.5%, compared to a modern spark-ignition (gasoline) engine, which has a peak efficiency of 20-25%. The Mod II project replaced the normal spark-ignition engine in a 1985 4-door Chevrolet Celebrity notchback. In the 1986 MOD II Design Report (Appendix A) the results showed that highway gas mileage was increased from and achieved an urban range of with no change in vehicle gross weight. Startup time in the NASA vehicle was a maximum of 30 seconds, while Ford's research vehicle used an internal electric heater to quickly start the engine, giving a start time of only a few seconds. The high torque output of the Stirling engine at low speed eliminated the need for a torque converter in the transmission resulting in decreased weight and transmission drivetrain losses negating somewhat the weight disadvantage of the Stirling in auto use. This resulted in increased efficiencies being mentioned in the test results. The experiments indicated that the Stirling engine could improve vehicle operational efficiency by ideally detaching the Stirling from direct power demands, eliminating a direct mechanical linkage as used in most current vehicles. Its prime function used in an extended-range series electric hybrid vehicle would be as a generator providing electricity to drive the electric vehicle traction motors and charging a buffer battery set. In a petro- hydraulic hybrid the Stirling would perform a similar function as in a petro- electric series-hybrid turning a pump charging a hydraulic buffer tank. Although successful in the MOD 1 and MOD 2 phases of the experiments, cutbacks in funding further research and lack of interest by automakers ended possible commercialization of the Automotive Stirling Engine Program. = Electric vehicles = Stirling engines as part of a hybrid electric drive system may be able to bypass the design challenges or disadvantages of a non-hybrid Stirling automobile. In November 2007, a prototype hybrid car using solid biofuel and a Stirling engine was announced by the Precer project in Sweden. The New Hampshire Union Leader reports that Dean Kamen has developed a series plug-in hybrid car using a Ford Think. DEKA, Kamen's technology company in the Manchester Millyard, has demonstrated an electric car, the DEKA Revolt, that can reach approximately on a single charge of its lithium battery. = Aircraft engines = Robert McConaghy created the first flying stirling engine powered aircraft in August 1986. The Beta type engine weighed 360 grams, and produced only 20 Watts of power. The engine was attached to the front of a modified Super Malibu radio control glider with a gross takeoff weight of 1 kg. The best published test flight lasted 6 minutes and exhibited \\"barely enough power to make the occasional gentle turn and maintain altitude\\". = Marine engines = The Stirling engine could be well suited for underwater power systems where electrical work or mechanical power is required on an intermittent or continuous level. General Motors have undertaken a considerable amount of work on advanced Stirling cycle engines which include thermal storage for underwater applications. United Stirling, in Malm√∂, Sweden, are developing an experimental four‚Äìcylinder engine using hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant in underwater power systems. The SAGA (Submarine Assistance Great Autonomy) submarine became operational in the 1990s and is driven by two Stirling engines supplied with diesel fuel and liquid oxygen. This system also has potential for surface-ship propulsion, as the engine's size is less of a concern, and placing the radiator section in seawater rather than open air (as a land-based engine would be) allows for it to be smaller. Swedish shipbuilder Kockums has built 8 successful Stirling powered submarines since the late 1980s.Kockums (a) They carry compressed oxygen to allow fuel combustion submerged, providing heat for the Stirling engine. They are currently used on submarines of the Gotland and S√∂dermanland classes. They are the first submarines in the world to feature Stirling air-independent propulsion (AIP), which extends their underwater endurance from a few days to several weeks. This capability has previously only been available with nuclear-powered submarines. The Kockums engine also powers the Japanese S≈çry≈´- class submarine. = Pump engines = Stirling engines can power pumps to move fluids like water, air and gasses. For instance the ST-5 from Stirling Technology Inc. power output of that can run a 3 kW generator or a centrifugal water pump.  Electrical power generation  Structural schematic diagram of a Free Piston Stirling Engine system = Combined heat and power = In a combined heat and power (CHP) system, mechanical or electrical power is generated in the usual way, however, the waste heat given off by the engine is used to supply a secondary heating application. This can be virtually anything that uses low temperature heat. It is often a pre-existing energy use, such as commercial space heating, residential water heating, or an industrial process. Thermal power stations on the electric grid use fuel to produce electricity. However, there are large quantities of waste heat produced which often go unused. In other situations, high-grade fuel is burned at high temperature for a low temperature application. According to the second law of thermodynamics, a heat engine can generate power from this temperature difference. In a CHP system, the high temperature primary heat enters the Stirling engine heater, then some of the energy is converted to mechanical power in the engine, and the rest passes through to the cooler, where it exits at a low temperature. The \\"waste\\" heat actually comes from engine's main cooler, and possibly from other sources such as the exhaust of the burner, if there is one. The power produced by the engine can be used to run an industrial or agricultural process, which in turn creates biomass waste refuse that can be used as free fuel for the engine, thus reducing waste removal costs. The overall process can be efficient and cost effective. Inspirit Energy, a UK-based company have a gas fired CHP unit called the Inspirit Charger which is on sale in 2016. The floor standing unit generates 3 kW of electrical and 15 kW of thermal energy. WhisperGen, a New Zealand firm with offices in Christchurch, has developed an \\"AC Micro Combined Heat and Power\\" Stirling cycle engine. These microCHP units are gas-fired central heating boilers which sell unused power back into the electricity grid. WhisperGen announced in 2004 that they were producing 80,000 units for the residential market in the United Kingdom. A 20 unit trial in Germany was conducted in 2006. = Solar power generation = Dish Stirling from SES Placed at the focus of a parabolic mirror, a Stirling engine can convert solar energy to electricity with an efficiency better than non- concentrated photovoltaic cells, and comparable to concentrated photovoltaics. On August 11, 2005, Southern California Edison announced an agreement with Stirling Energy Systems (SES) to purchase electricity created using over 30,000 Solar Powered Stirling Engines over a twenty-year period sufficient to generate 850 MW of electricity. These systems, on an 8,000 acre (19 km2) solar farm will use mirrors to direct and concentrate sunlight onto the engines which will in turn drive generators. \\"In January, 2010, four months after breaking ground, Stirling Energy partner company Tessara Solar completed the 1.5 MW Maricopa Solar power plant in Peoria, Arizona, just outside Phoenix. The power plant is composed of 60 SES SunCatchers.\\" The SunCatcher is described as \\"a large, tracking, concentrating solar power (CSP) dish collector that generates 25 kilowatts (kW) of electricity in full sun. Each of the 38-foot-diameter collectors contains over 300 curved mirrors (heliostats) that focus sunlight onto a power conversion unit, which contains the Stirling engine. The dish uses dual-axis tracking to follow the sun precisely as it moves across the sky.\\" There have been disputes over the project due to concerns of environmental impact on animals living on the site. The Maricopa Solar Plant has been closed. = Nuclear power = There is a potential for nuclear-powered Stirling engines in electric power generation plants. Replacing the steam turbines of nuclear power plants with Stirling engines might simplify the plant, yield greater efficiency, and reduce the radioactive byproducts. A number of breeder reactor designs use liquid sodium as coolant. If the heat is to be employed in a steam plant, a water/sodium heat exchanger is required, which raises some concern as sodium reacts violently with water. A Stirling engine eliminates the need for water anywhere in the cycle. This would have advantages for nuclear installations in dry regions. United States government labs have developed a modern Stirling engine design known as the Stirling Radioisotope Generator for use in space exploration. It is designed to generate electricity for deep space probes on missions lasting decades. The engine uses a single displacer to reduce moving parts and uses high energy acoustics to transfer energy. The heat source is a dry solid nuclear fuel slug, and the heat sink is radiation into free space itself.  Heating and cooling  If supplied with mechanical power, a Stirling engine can function in reverse as a heat pump for heating or cooling. In the late 1930s, the Philips Corporation of the Netherlands successfully utilized the Stirling cycle in cryogenic applications. During the Space Shuttle program, NASA successfully lofted a Stirling cycle cooler in a form \\"similar in size and shape to the small domestic units often used in college dormitories\\" for use in the Life Science Laboratory. Further research on this unit for domestic use led to a Carnot coefficient-of-performance gain by a factor of three and a weight reduction of 1kg for the unit. Experiments have been performed using wind power driving a Stirling cycle heat pump for domestic heating and air conditioning. = Stirling cryocoolers = Any Stirling engine will also work in reverse as a heat pump: when mechanical energy is applied to the shaft, a temperature difference appears between the reservoirs. The essential mechanical components of a Stirling cryocooler are identical to a Stirling engine. In both the engine and the heat pump, heat flows from the expansion space to the compression space; however, input work is required in order for heat to flow \\"uphill\\" against a thermal gradient, specifically when the compression space is hotter than the expansion space. The external side of the expansion-space heat exchanger may be placed inside a thermally insulated compartment such as a vacuum flask. Heat is in effect pumped out of this compartment, through the working gas of the cryocooler and into the compression space. The compression space will be above ambient temperature, and so heat will flow out into the environment. One of their modern uses is in cryogenics and, to a lesser extent, refrigeration. At typical refrigeration temperatures, Stirling coolers are generally not economically competitive with the less expensive mainstream Rankine cooling systems, because they are less energy-efficient. However, below about ‚àí40...‚àí30 ¬∞C, Rankine cooling is not effective because there are no suitable refrigerants with boiling points this low. Stirling cryocoolers are able to \\"lift\\" heat down to ‚àí200 ¬∞C (73 K), which is sufficient to liquefy air (specifically the primary constituent gases oxygen, nitrogen and argon). They can go as low as 40‚Äì60 K for single-stage machines, depending on the particular design. Two-stage Stirling cryocoolers can reach temperatures of 20 K, sufficient to liquify hydrogen and neon. Cryocoolers for this purpose are more or less competitive with other cryocooler technologies. The coefficient of performance at cryogenic temperatures is typically 0.04‚Äì0.05 (corresponding to a 4‚Äì5% efficiency). Empirically, the devices show a linear trend, typically with the , where Tc is the cryogenic temperature. At these temperatures, solid materials have lower specific heat values, so the regenerator must be made from unexpected materials, such as cotton. The first Stirling-cycle cryocooler was developed at Philips in the 1950s and commercialized in such places as liquid air production plants. The Philips Cryogenics business evolved until it was split off in 1990 to form the Stirling Cryogenics BV, The Netherlands. This company is still active in the development and manufacturing of Stirling cryocoolers and cryogenic cooling systems. A wide variety of smaller Stirling cryocoolers are commercially available for tasks such as the cooling of electronic sensors and sometimes microprocessors. For this application, Stirling cryocoolers are the highest-performance technology available, due to their ability to lift heat efficiently at very low temperatures. They are silent, vibration-free, can be scaled down to small sizes, and have very high reliability and low maintenance. As of 2009, cryocoolers were considered to be the only widely deployed commercially successful Stirling devices. = Heat pumps = A Stirling heat pump is very similar to a Stirling cryocooler, the main difference being that it usually operates at room temperature. At present, its principal application is to pump heat from the outside of a building to the inside, thus heating it at lowered energy costs. As with any other Stirling device, heat flow is from the expansion space to the compression space. However, in contrast to the Stirling engine, the expansion space is at a lower temperature than the compression space, so instead of producing work, an input of mechanical work is required by the system (in order to satisfy the Second Law of Thermodynamics). The mechanical energy input can be supplied by an electrical motor, or an internal combustion engine, for example. When the mechanical work for the heat pump is provided by a second Stirling engine, then the overall system is called a \\"heat-driven heatpump\\". The expansion side of the heat pump is thermally coupled to the heat source, which is often the external environment. The compression side of the Stirling device is placed in the environment to be heated, for example a building, and heat is \\"pumped\\" into it. Typically there will be thermal insulation between the two sides so there will be a temperature rise inside the insulated space. Heat pumps are by far the most energy-efficient types of heating systems, since they \\"harvest\\" heat from the environment, rather than only turning their input energy into heat. In accordance with the Second Law of Thermodynamics, heat pumps always require the additional input of some external energy to \\"pump\\" the collected heat \\"uphill\\" against a temperature differential. Compared to conventional heat pumps, Stirling heat pumps often have a higher coefficient of performance . To date, Stirling systems have seen limited commercial use; however, use is expected to increase along with market demand for energy conservation, and adoption will likely be accelerated by technological refinements. = Portable refrigeration = The Free Piston Stirling Cooler (FPSC) is a completely sealed heat transfer system that has only two moving parts (a piston and a displacer), and which can use helium as the working fluid. The piston is typically driven by an oscillating magnetic field that is the source of the power needed to drive the refrigeration cycle. The magnetic drive allows the piston to be driven without requiring any seals, gaskets, O-rings, or other compromises to the hermetically sealed system. Claimed advantages for the system include improved efficiency and cooling capacity, lighter weight, smaller size and better controllability. The FPSC was invented in 1964 by William Beale (1928-2016), a professor of Mechanical Engineering at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio. He founded Sunpower Inc., which researches and develops FPSC systems for military, aerospace, industrial, and commercial applications. A FPSC cooler made by Sunpower was used by NASA to cool instrumentation in satellites. The firm was sold by the Beale family in 2015 to become a unit of Ametek. Other suppliers of FPSC technology include the Twinbird Corporation of Japan and Global Cooling of the Netherlands, which (like Sunpower) has a research center in Athens, Ohio. For several years starting around 2004, the Coleman Company sold a version of the Twinbird \\"SC-C925 Portable Freezer Cooler 25L\\" under its own brand name, but it has since discontinued offering the product. The portable cooler can be operated more than a day, maintaining sub-freezing temperatures while powered by an automotive battery. This cooler is still being manufactured, with Global Cooling now coordinating distribution to North America and Europe. Other variants offered by Twinbird include a portable deep freezer (to ‚àí80 ¬∞C), collapsible coolers, and a model for transporting blood and vaccine.  Low temperature difference engines  A low-temperature-difference Stirling engine, shown here running on the heat from a warm hand A low temperature difference (LTD, or Low Delta T (LDT)) Stirling engine will run on any low temperature differential, for example the difference between the palm of a hand and room temperature, or room temperature and an ice cube. A record of only 0.5 ¬∞C temperature differential was achieved in 1990. Usually they are designed in a gamma configuration for simplicity, and without a regenerator, although some have slits in the displacer typically made of foam for partial regeneration. They are typically unpressurized, running at pressure close to 1 atmosphere. The power produced is less than 1 W, and they are intended for demonstration purposes only. They are sold as toys and educational models. However, larger (typically 1 m square) low temperature engines have been built for pumping water using direct sunlight with minimal or no magnification.  Other applications  = Acoustic Stirling Heat Engine = Los Alamos National Laboratory has developed an \\"Acoustic Stirling Heat Engine\\" with no moving parts. It converts heat into intense acoustic power which (quoted from given source) \\"can be used directly in acoustic refrigerators or pulse-tube refrigerators to provide heat-driven refrigeration with no moving parts, or ... to generate electricity via a linear alternator or other electro-acoustic power transducer\\". = MicroCHP = WhisperGen, (bankruptcy 2012) a New Zealand-based company has developed Stirling engines that can be powered by natural gas or diesel. An agreement has been signed with Mondragon Corporaci√≥n Cooperativa, a Spanish firm, to produce WhisperGen's microCHP (Combined Heat and Power) and make them available for the domestic market in Europe. Some time ago E.ON UK announced a similar initiative for the UK. Domestic Stirling engines would supply the client with hot water, space heating and a surplus electric power that could be fed back into the electric grid. Based on the companies' published performance specifications, the off-grid diesel fueled unit produces combined heat (5.5 kW heat) and electric (800W electric) output, from a unit being fed 0.75 liters of automotive grade diesel fuel per hour. Whispergen units are claimed to operate as a combined co-generation unit reaching as high as ~80% operating efficiency. However the preliminary results of an Energy Saving Trust review of the performance of the WhisperGen microCHP units suggested that their advantages were marginal at best in most homes. However another author shows that Stirling engine microgeneration is the most cost effective of various microgeneration technologies in terms of reducing CO2. = Chip cooling = MSI (Taiwan) developed a miniature Stirling engine cooling system for personal computer chips that uses the waste heat from the chip to drive a fan. = Desalination = In all thermal power plants there has to be an exhaust of waste heat. However, there's no reason that the waste heat cannot be diverted to run stirling engines to pump seawater through reverse osmosis assemblies except that any additional use of the heat raises the effective heat sink temperature for the thermal power plant resulting in some loss of energy conversion efficiency. In a typical nuclear power plant, two-thirds of the thermal energy produced by the reactor is waste heat. In a stirling assembly the waste heat has potential to be used as an additional source of electricity.

The university is based in Berlin, but also owns institutes in Baden-W√ºrttemberg. The university mainly offers extra-occupational study courses. Besides Bachelor and Master programs, there are possibilities to get doctoral degrees. Although the university is mainly offering economic courses, there is also the opportunity to achieve a Bachelor of Engineering. The main idea of Steinbeis University is the \\"interdigitation of theory and practice\\", which means that the students can apply their gained theoretical knowledge directly to their job. Students are usually just accepted together with a sponsoring company, where the students have to work during their \\"practical training\\". The university is wholly owned by the Steinbeis Foundation.  History  As early as 1994, the Steinbeis Foundation was working on the fundamentals of a new academy. The idea of a private Steinbeis University in Baden-W√ºrttemberg was soon in coming. The circumstances at the time, however, were not advantageous. As a result, Johann L√∂hn, the then Steinbeis Foundation Chairman of the Board, chose not to pursue the idea further. As systemic coincidence would have it, lines of communication were established with the Berlin Senate Department of Science and Education. The Secretary of State at the time, Erich Thies, was a strong advocate of the university ‚Äì even if it existed in thought only. In a matter of weeks, Steinbeis received state approval to move forward with SHB. The university opened its doors in the autumn of 1998 offering the MBE (Master of Business and Engineering). 1999 saw the introduction of the MedienMBA, the first MBA for senior managers working in the German media. In 2000 SHB added another string to its bow: MBA degrees for Chinese executives and German fast- track employees. In 2001 SHB launched its first bachelor's degree program. From day one, the university's entrepreneurial origins stood it in good stead: organized as a business, with the institutes acting more like \\"companies within a company\\". This set-up and the Project Competence Concept have played a key role in SHB's astounding growth. Degrees based on this model require students to \\"partner\\" with a company at the start of their studies and fl esh out a project that applies the lessons they learn in the classroom to a tangible business challenge. The degrees are rounded off by specialized seminars and training courses in key skills areas of technology, management and business ‚Äì all adding to the richness of the Steinbeis curriculum. Today over 4000 employed professionals are enrolled in SHB. In total about 900 lecturers and 1100 project managers are, mostly part-time, employed by the university. Criticism At the beginning of 2014, the university received nationwide criticism after it announced plans to launch a Steinbeis Transfer Institute in Traunstein in September 2014 offering a bachelor's degree in homeopathy.

History Lough Oughter, the castle's surroundings The castle is located in the historic Kingdom of Breifne, specifically in the part that would later be subdivided into East Breifne, roughly corresponding to County Cavan. Prior to the construction of the castle, the spot may have been a crann√≥g. In the latter part of the 12th century, it was under the control of the O'Rourkes, but it seems to have come into the hands of the Anglo-Norman William Gorm de Lacy after the Normans wrest control of some of the territory from that ruling clan. While the exact date construction began is unknown, it is estimated to have started in the first quarter of the 13th century. Architectural elements date the lower two storeys of cloughoughter to this time. In 1233, the O'Reilly clan took possession of the area and completed the castle. They retained it for centuries in the midst of their ongoing conflicts with the O'Rourkes and with members of their own clan. It was there that Philip O'Reilly was imprisoned in the 1360s with \\"no allowance save a sheaf of oats for day and night and a cup of water, so that he was compelled to drink his own urine.\\"  Ireland's Eye.com, Cloughoughter Castle After the Plantations Possession of Cloughoughter was granted to servitor Hugh Culme during the Plantation of Ulster. Culme did not dwell in the castle, but built a new residence upon the nearby lake shore. Philip O'Reilly, then an MP for Cavan and leader of the rebels during the Irish Rebellion of 1641 seized control of the castle, retaining it as an island fortification for a further 12 years. During this final phase of its active existence, it was used as a prison. In this capacity Culme was imprisoned having failed to defend it as he had been charged. The Anglican Bishop of Kilmore, William Bedell was also held there for a period of weeks and died soon afterwards in February 1642, evidently due to inadequate shelter from the cold winter. In 1649 Owen Roe O'Neill, the commander of the Ulster Army died at the castle. For the remaining years of the rebellion, O'Reilly retained it as an island fortification, holding it a total of 12 years before it was besieged. Finally, The British Cromwellian forces had defeated the surrounding indigenous Irish armies, pushed the defenses back to the lake, recovered the lake-shore and proceeded to bombard the castle from positions in the townland of Innishconnell. When the castle finally fell and the indigenous Irish captured in March 1653, it was the last remaining rebel stronghold, fell to Cromwellian forces in March 1653, but not easily. Due to its island location, invading troops set up their cannons on a rise, at some considerable distance, in the townland of Innishconnell. The castle's walls were breached by cannon shot, remain to this day. Left in ruins, the castle became a frequent subject of art in the 18th and 19th centuries. Its visual impact was described in a travelogue published The Dublin University Magazine in 1852: > It stands on a small island, scarce three hundred feet in diameter, just > sufficient to contain the castle and a small margin of rock around it.

The Image of Irelande, with a Discoverie of Woodkarne is a 1581 book by John Derricke. The book is dedicated to Philip Sidney. It praises the deputyship of Philip's father Henry Sidney and English victories over the Irish. The work opens with a poetic history of Ireland and its conflicts with the English, presenting reasons for English rule. This proceeds to a set of twelve woodcut illustrations interspersed with verse narration, describing Henry Sidney's victories of Irish rebels and denigrating Irish culture. The book ends with the surrender of Turlough Luineach √ì Neill, king of Tyrone, in 1578. Critics, such as James A. Knapp, have deemed the illustrations to be of far greater interest than the unremarkable verse. There is only one complete version extant, at the Edinburgh University Library. A copy was produced and edited by the university librarian in 1883. File:The Image of Irelande - title.jpgThe Image of Irelande: title page showing the inscription of donation.

Early life Elpatyevsky was born in the village of Novoselki-Kudrino, Vladimir Governorate, into the family of a village priest. He studied at a religious school and, after graduating in 1868, at a seminary. In 1872 he entered the Law Faculty of Moscow State University, later transferring to the Medical Faculty. Career In the 1870s Elpatyevsky participated in the narodnik movement. In 1875, he assisted in the organization of settlements under the populists. He also provided his Moscow apartment for populist meetings. In 1876/77 he helped to organize a student club along with S.V. Martynov and V.S. Lebedev. The club served to coordinate student activities and organize assistance for political exiles in Siberia. In 1877 Elpatyevsky was investigated on charges of having links with revolutionary groups, but released for lack of evidence. In 1878 he finished his studies at the University, and began working as a doctor in Skopinsky County, Ryazan province. He also continued his revolutionary activities. In 1880 he was arrested on charges of promoting The People's Will, and deported to Ufa province under police supervision. Exile In 1884 Elpatyevsky was arrested for distributing illegal literature, and sentenced to exile in Eastern Siberia. He arrived in Krasnoyarsk on October 24, 1884, where he met with the writer Vladimir Korolenko. Elpatyevsky settled in the village of Verhnepashennom, in the Yeniseysky District of Yenisei province. His wife Lyudmila and their two children went with him voluntarily. His wife and children settled in the city of Yeniseysk. In 1885 Elpatyevsky was allowed to resettle in Yeniseysk with his family. He repeatedly appealed to the governor of the Yenisei province to allow him to practice medicine, but was refused. He then began to practice medicine free of charge. Later he was granted the right to move freely throughout the countryside to fight the epidemics of diphtheria and scarlet fever in Angara and measles in Turukhansk. He received the thanks of the Governor I. K. Pedashenko for helping to fight these epidemics. In April, 1886 a Chelyabinsk merchant named Balakshin asked Governor Pedashenko if Elpatyevsky could be allowed to accompany him to Lake Shira. The governor allowed Elpatyevsky to visit the Minusinsky District for scientific purposes. Their scientific observations about the healing properties of the water of Lake Shira were outlined in Elpatyevsky's report at a meeting of the Yenisei Province Society of Physicians. Later life After his period of exile, Elpatyevsky lived in Nizhny Novgorod, and published works in the magazines Russian Wealth and Russian Gazette. In 1893 he took part in the national fight against hunger and cholera . In the late 1890s he settled in Yalta, where he often met with Leo Tolstoy and Anton Chekhov, whom he treated for tuberculosis. In the early 1900s he went abroad, and met with the founders of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party. During the 1905 Russian Revolution he held meetings of members of the party in his apartment. He didn't share some of their ideas and, for this reason, became one of the creators of the Labour Popular Socialist Party. Vladimir Lenin criticized him for this. He was arrested for publishing the booklet Land and Freedom in 1910. In 1910/11 he was imprisoned in the Peter and Paul Fortress. During World War 1 Elpatyevsky worked in hospitals in the All-Russian Land Union. In 1917 he left the Labour Popular Socialist Party. After the Russian Revolution of 1917 he lived in Moscow. From 1922 to 1928 he worked as a doctor in the Kremlin hospital. He died in 1933 in Moscow.

The Han forces were unprepared and suffered heavy losses. Several of Liu Bang's family members were captured and some of his allies defected to Chu as a result of his defeat. Background In the spring of 205 BC, Xiang Yu was putting down rebellions in the Qi kingdom, following all the way to the northern coast of the Shandong peninsula a campaign of terror: burning homes; burying alive prisoners-of-war; capturing women, the weak, and the elderly. Tian Heng, brother of Tian Rong, the slain former ruler of Qi, gathered tens of thousands of soldiers and rebelled in Chengyang (in present-day Qingdao, Shandong). At the beginning of summer, Tian Heng installed Tian Rong's son Tian Guang as King of Qi. Xiang Yu was unable to dislodge him, but planned on dealing with Qi first before returning his military attention to Han. With Xiang Yu thus occupied, Liu Bang collected a force of 560,000 troops from his subordinate lands, and marched east to attack Chu. En route, he encountered Peng Yue, who joined his cause upon promise of a fiefdom in Wei. As opposed to combining forces, Liu Bang sent Peng Yue's 30,000 troops to pacify the surrounding area. Liu Bang's army entered Xiang Yu's capital of Pengcheng (present-day Xuzhou, Jiangsu) apparently unopposed, looting its valuables and taking its women, but discipline was lax and each day found the Han troops deeper in their cups. The battle Hearing of the fall of Pengcheng, Xiang Yu ordered the bulk of his forces to maintain the attack on Qi, while he personally led 30,000 crack troops to retake the capital. He encamped about ten miles from the city, in present-day Xiao County, Anhui. At dawn, Xiang Yu launched an attack on Pengcheng, and by noon had broken the unprepared Han army. Routed, the Han infantry fled into the nearby Gu () and Si () rivers, where over 100,000 of them were killed by Chu soldiers. The remaining troops fled south to high ground, but were cornered by Chu forces by the Sui () river, where another 100,000 Han troops drowned, their corpses damming up the river. Liu Bang escaped the city with a handful of mounted bodyguards, heading to nearby Pei to collect his family. Xiang Yu also dispatched troops to Pei in an attempt to capture Liu Bang's family. His family had all fled, but Liu Bang encountered on the road his eldest daughter and second eldest son Liu Ying. The Chu army coerced a local into leading them to two of Liu Bang's family: his father Liu Taigong and wife L√º Zhi. These two Xiang Yu captured and placed in his army as hostages. One account states Liu Bang's mother was also captured. A famous and possibly fictional account of Liu Bang's flight portrays him as so fearful that he thrice dumps his children out of his chariot in order to move faster, and it is only the repeated intervention of Xiahou Ying that secures the children's escape. Aftermath Although he had won a stunning reversal, Xiang Yu returned to a capital that had been plundered by the occupying Han armies. Faced with a starving civilian population, Xiang Yu decided against pursuing Liu and instead shared his military provisions with the populace. Although his decisive victory had turned general opinion against Liu, the failure to exploit this strategic advantage meant that Xiang Yu ultimately missed his opportunity to end this mortal threat. Liu Bang gradually collected his lost forces, but did not retain his gains in Chu lands. Most of his family remained hostages of Xiang Yu. His allies lost faith in him; Sima Xin and Dong Yi abandoned him for Chu. Xiang Yu gained in reputation and power, but continued to deal with problems in Qi.

It is located on the west side of Cayuga Lake in Tompkins County, New York. History The Cayuga Nature Center Lodge today CNC traces its history back to the Cayuga Preventorium, founded in 1914, which was a non-profit organization that provided a summer camp on the east side of Cayuga Lake for children exposed to tuberculosis. As tuberculosis cases diminished, the Preventorium sponsored the Cardiac Clinic to serve underprivileged children afflicted with heart disease. In 1936, Ernest T. Paine donated 75 acres of land on the west side of Cayuga Lake, at the current Cayuga Nature Center property, \\"for the health and welfare of the children of Tompkins County\\". Construction of the Cayuga Preventorium Lodge on the property was completed by the Works Progress Administration in 1939. The Preventorium summer camp ran until 1942, where diminishing cases of tuberculosis, competition from other summer camps, and staff reductions due to the Second World War forced the camp to close its doors. After the war, Cornell University leased the facility as housing for graduate students. In the 1960s, the lodge was reopened as a conference center to be used year- round. Under a new program sponsored by the State Education Department, the Board of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) began to offer the site for outdoor education programs. Based on the success of the program, BOCES, Onondaga Nature Centers, Inc., and the Ithaca City School District collaborated to open the Preventorium as a Nature Center in 1975. Dubbed the Cayuga Nature Center four years later, the center was incorporated as a private non-profit organization in 1981. In January 2011, having experienced funding difficulties, CNC merged with the Paleontological Research Institution, with programs continuing at both locations. Facilities The six-story tree house TreeTops The Cayuga Nature Center is located three miles south of Taughannock Falls State Park on the west shore of Cayuga Lake. The CNC Lodge is heated by a biomass furnace designed and installed as a Cornell engineering student project and features exhibits combining live, mounted, and fossil specimens with interactive stations to highlight the ecology and biodiversity of the Cayuga Basin. CNC's other facilities include Smith Woods, an old-growth forest; TreeTops, a six-story tree house built by the Ithaca High School class of 2000;, a zoological collection consisting of 30 animals; a seasonal Butterfly Garden, a turtle pond; and a 120-acre campus with five miles of hiking trails. =Smith Woods= Henry A. Smith Woods is a 32-acre old-growth forest in Trumansburg, New York. The forest was originally owned by New York City businessman Henry Atterbury Smith, who used it intermittently as a summer residence. In 1909, his sons left the property to the Village of Trumansburg to be used as a public park. Ownership of the forest was transferred to the Cayuga Nature Center in 2007, where it continues to be preserved and used as an educational and recreational site. Programs CNC offers day summer and school's out day camps as well as year-round programs and classes focusing on environmental issues and natural history. Programs and classes are available for all ages and include the TEAM Challenge rope course for personal growth and team building, animal encounters, and outdoor educational programs that cover survival skills, ecology, and geology, among other topics. CNC also offers seasonal programs on maple sugaring, making apple cider, butterflies and moths in the Butterfly Garden, and winter ecology.

In 1969 Mogi predicted that there was a possibility of a shallow magnitude 8.0 earthquake in the T≈çkai region of Japan, an area that has experienced a number of previous large earthquakes. Following the passing of the Large-Scale Earthquake Countermeasure Act, in 1978 Mogi was appointed to the newly created Earthquake Assessment Committee (EAC) for the expected Tokai earthquake, charged with warning the government if the quake was imminent. He went on to chair the ECA from 1991 until he resigned the post in 1996 after failing to persuade the government of the need to take uncertainty into account when issuing warnings. Nuclear power Following damage at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant due to the 2007 Ch≈´etsu offshore earthquake, Mogi called for the immediate closure of the Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant, which was built close to the centre of the expected T≈çkai earthquake despite his 1969 prediction. Previously, in 2004, he had stated that the issue 'is a critical problem which can bring a catastrophe to Japan through a man-made disaster'. Mogi doughnut hypothesis In 1969 Mogi proposed a hypothesis for earthquake prediction, now known as the 'Mogi doughnut hypothesis', that major earthquakes tend to occur in an unusually seismically calm area surrounded by a ring of unusually high seismic activity.The Mogi Donut Alaska Science Forum, published July 9, 1979-07-07, accessed 2011-03-18Evidence for Mogi doughnut behavior in seismicity preceding small earthquakes in southern California Peter M.

Roberts is best known for having designed and supervised the construction of Shelley's schooner, Don Juan, and Lord Byron's yacht, Bolivar. Early life Daniel Roberts was born on 18 February 1789 in Shoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex, England; he died on his 80th birthday at three in the afternoon on the Island of La Maddalena off the northern coast of Sardinia. When his father Captain Henry Roberts died, Daniel was seven. Henry left his wife Harriet to care for their eight children. Nothing has been written about Daniel Roberts' childhood until, at the age of 10, he enlisted in the Royal Navy as a Volunteer 1st Class. Naval career His career in the Royal Navy followed an atypical path. On enlisting (at the age of 10) in July 1799, he was assigned to the 64-gun (a ship captured from the Dutch, on 22 October 1795), stationed at the Nore (where the River Thames meets the North Sea).James, William M., The Naval History of Great Britain, Vol.4, pp.205-7 He spent four months aboard Oversyssel and then, as his service records reveal, he was discharged from the ship in November 1799.British Naval Archives, Memorandum of ServiceMemorandum of Service --- Captain Daniel Roberts (1817) Roberts‚Äô naval Memorandum of Service is blank for 21 months until it shows he was assigned as an A.B. (Able seaman) to HMS Royal William at Portsmouth. Since the Navy preferred new enlistees be at least 13 years old, the most probable scenario is Roberts spent the next 20 months in a private school, which specialized in teaching navigation and preparing boys for sea. After seven weeks aboard Royal William, he was on shore for eight months until 13 June 1802, when he was ordered aboard , where at age 13 he served as a midshipman. After Roberts had served on board the Blenheim for four months, the vessel was ordered to be stored, and he was again on shore for another eight months. On 28 June 1803, he was assigned to the recently launched , a 36-gun frigate. It was here, under a prominent naval personality, Captain Henry Blackwood, that at the age of 15, Daniel Roberts first experienced naval warfare in an assault on French vessels off Boulogne pier, in October 1804. After serving for almost two years under Captain Blackwood, and five months before Euryalus was to make a significant contribution to Nelson's fleet at the Battle of Trafalgar, Roberts was again on shore for three months. On 8 April 1805, he joined a hospital ship, for one month; then back on Euryalus for just two weeks and five days until on 23 August 1805 he joined another 36-gun frigate, , stationed off the French coast in the Bay of Biscay. This ship did not join in the Battle of Trafalgar; instead she was part of the fleet, which was blockading the French coast. In August 1806, young midshipman Roberts was provided a few days of excitement when his ship almost captured Napol√©on Bonaparte‚Äôs younger brother J√©r√¥me Bonaparte, captain of the V√©t√©ran. Roberts served aboard Penelope until 26 May 1807, when Captain William Robert Broughton took command of , a larger 74-gun Ship of the Line. How many members of his crew Captain Broughton took with him to Illustrious is not known; that Roberts, at the age of 18, was one of them, is proof that his Captain valued his service. Upon joining Illustrious, Roberts was made a Master's mate. Roberts was again on a ship that was to enter into combat. On the night of 11 April 1809, a British fleet of 25 ships attacked a powerful squadron of French ships anchored in the Basque Roads, a sheltered bay on the Biscay shore of France, bounded by the Ile d‚ÄôOl√©ron to the west and √éle de R√© to the north. The Battle of Basque Roads was initiated when the British sent several explosion ships into the Roads to blow holes in a mile-long boom of heavy spars and chains the French had placed to prevent enemy vessels from reaching their warships. In the attack all but two of the French ships were driven ashore. Although the engagement was to last three days, the British failed to destroy the French fleet; however, one result of the engagement was that on 12 July 1809, Master's mate Daniel Roberts, age 20, was promoted to lieutenant.British Naval Archives, Memorandum of Service For the next two years he was on board , a 36-gun frigate. On 10 January 1810, Roberts‚Äô ship chased the 14-gun French privateer Charles, but her prey was lost in a thick fog. The following day, the Phoenix discovered her adversary anchored close to the French coast. A boarding attack was launched and, when Charles, resisted, one British marine was killed and another wounded. In this engagement Roberts was in charge of one of the boats that carried marines and seamen who boarded the Charles. The attack succeeded, and on board the prize they found two English masters and 13 seamen who had been taken out of vessels a few days previously. Result of Court Martial of Daniel Roberts. 1810 This event led to Roberts‚Äô court martial. His conduct during the battle was criticized by a marine officer of Phoenix, Lieutenant William Murray, who wrote a letter of accusation to the captain of the ship. Consequently, a commission to judge Roberts‚Äô professional behaviour was formed. On 17 April 1810 not only were all the accusations discharged, his behaviour was considered worthy and honourable while Murray's accusation were labelled as \\"totally unfounded and subversive of the discipline of the Service.\\" British Naval Archives, Daniel Roberts, Record of Court Martial 1810, Within the next few months, Phoenix sailed to the East Indies where she would remain for almost a year. On 1 April 1811, Roberts rejoined HMS Illustrious, where in 1809 he had served as a Masters Mate under Captain William Robert Broughton; now he was wearing the uniform of an officer. Three months later, his ship was engaged in combat with the enemy in the invasion of Java. Roberts‚Äô posting to Illustrious was short lived, for on 5 October 1811, he was sent home with the dispatches. Roberts‚Äô service record does not indicate where he was stationed from 17 May 1812 until he was posted to a ship of his own on 20 September 1815. Although he held the rank of commander it was proper for his crew to call him Captain. The entry in his Memorandum of Service, following that of promotion to Commander, was his assignment to on 20 September 1815. HMS Hydra This vessel was built in 1797, at Gravesend, as a 38-gun frigate. When Roberts joined the ship, she was a troopship. The Battle of Waterloo (18 June 1815) occurred three months before he took command of Hydra; the war had ended. After being in the Baltic for two months before the Treaty of Paris (1815) was signed, he sailed for the West Indies, on 12 November 1815. Roberts commanded his troopship for two years. He returned to England from Canada between 3 September 1817, when the following article was published in ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Edinburgh Observer‚Äô‚Äô and 12 November 1817, when he was discharged from the Hydra. Retirement There is no written record of Roberts‚Äô activities between the time of his discharge, 12 November 1817, and when he was in the south of France in May 1820. The funds he accumulated from his eighteen years in service plus his retirement pension was enough for him not to feel the need to find employment. It was common for military officers with small incomes to retire to the continent where the cost of living was much lower than in England. France, Switzerland and Italy were favourites. Roberts documented his retirement in a series of Journals, which are now housed in the Keats-Shelley Memorial House in Rome. The Keats-Shelley House in Rome These Journals are covered in detail in A Biography of Captain Daniel Roberts by Donald Prell.Prell, Donald, A Biography of Captain Daniel Roberts, Strand Publishing, Palm Springs (2010), They cover a span of 20 years, from 18 May 1820 to 3 August 1840, with the exception of the time Roberts was with Byron, Shelley and the other members of their Pisan Circle. Roberts, Shelley and Byron Daniel Roberts was responsible for the design and construction of Shelley's schooner, Don Juan, and Lord Byron's yacht, Bolivar. A week before Shelley and Williams were drowned in a storm off of the coast of Italy (8 July 1822), Roberts had sailed with them in the Don Juan on the exact reverse course they were taking when the tragedy occurred.Keats-Shelley Journal, The Sinking of the Don Juan Revisited, by Donald B. Prell. LVI, 2007.pp.136-154. In June 1823, Byron asked Roberts to join his entourage, which was to sail to Greece. Roberts declined the invitation, preferring to remain in Genoa; he did however join with Byron's banker in locating and arranging for the charter of the merchant brig Hercules, the vessel that took Byron to Missolonghi, where he died in 1824. Throughout his life, Roberts maintained a close friendship with Edward Trelawny. It was Trelawny who asked Roberts to design the boats for the poets. A year following the fatal accident, Roberts purchased the remains of the schooner Don Juan‚Äô and after making repairs, he sailed it single-handed for several years. After losing the Don Juan Roberts purchased the Bolivar, which Byron had sold prior to going to Greece. These voyages are fully covered in his Journals. Roberts also continued corresponding with other members of the Pisan Circle, such as Mary Shelley and Claire Clairmont. Last years The final entry in Roberts‚Äô Journal IV: Roberts did not record when he was no longer living on his boat. From the above journal entry, it is known he acquired a vineyard sometime before August 1840. Records indicate it was located on the northeastern shore of La Maddalena. His last years are covered by Authors Giovanna Sotgiu and Alberto Sega in their book describing a group of English citizens who lived in La Maddalena during the 19th century. A chapter is dedicated to Captain Roberts.Sotgiu, Giovanna and Sega, Alberto, Inglesi neli‚Äôarcipelago. Da Nelson alla fine dell‚ÄòOttocento, (2005) In 1857, when Edward Trelawny was preparing to publish his Recollections of the last days of Shelley and Byron, he asked Roberts to make a sketch of Casa Magni, where Shelley had been living at the time of his drowning. Trelawny not only included Robert's sketch, he published a number of extracts from Robert's letters.Trelawny, Edward John, Recollections of the last days of Shelley and Byron, London:Moxon (1858) Roberts was to live another eleven years. He died on his 80th birthday, 18 February 1869 at 3:00 in the afternoon. No details can be found as to the cause of his death. Timeline 18 February 1789 Captain Roberts was born in Shoreham, West Sussex, England. 23 March 1789 New Shoreham baptism records show that a Daniel Roberts, son of Henry and Harriett Roberts was baptized on that date. 25 August 1796 Henry Roberts, Captain of the UNDAUNTED, died in the West Indies, where he caught yellow fever.Times, 14 December 1796. 30 July 1799 Daniel Roberts entered the Navy as Volunteer First Class.

It was destroyed by the construction of Damascus International Airport. Four soundings were taken in a rescue mission in 1967 by Henri de Contenson who produced the first report in 1968. A single level of occupation was found with compartmentalised buildings made of regular shaped bricks and lime plaster floors with small hearths. Relatively advanced flint sickles and blades were found along with obsidian blades and relatively few arrowheads. Mortars and a base made of basalt were found. Contenson suggested that harvesting of cereals would have been more important than hunting for the inhabitants. Extensive amounts of pottery were recovered from the site including hand finished flat base dishes, deep bowls and jars. Vessels had handles, knobs, decoration and often given a red wash, which according to Contenson indicated a dating of the site similar to the later Neolithic stages of Byblos; he dated the site to the late 5th millennium BC.

It later took the name of \\"Atelier d'Etudes Architecturales\\" (ATEA) (Architectural Studies Workshop) with the addition of Paul Cordoliani, Henri Coulomb (1927‚Äì2006), Renzo Moro and Ivan Seifert (1926‚Äì2008). The studio originated many public buildings in France and Africa. History 1985 La D√©fense, near Paris: the 1981 Quatre Temps shopping centre on a winter's afternoon Guy Lagneau (1915‚Äì1996) and Michel Weill (1914‚Äì2001) met in the studio of Auguste Perret in the National School of Fine Arts established in 1943. They participated with Perret in the reconstruction of Le Havre from 1946, work that was later declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Laigneau was particularly influenced by Scandinavian architecture, especially steel. Jean Dimitrijevic (1926‚Äì2010) joined the agency in 1947 after meeting Guy Lagneau in a Fine Arts workshop he was running. He graduated in 1957 and completed his training at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1959. He then became a partner of the workshop. The architects created the ATEA in association with a consulting firm, Soci√©t√© d'√©tudes techniques et d'am√©nagements planifi√©s (SETAP). ATEA-SETAP was involved in many planning operations in Africa, including Guinea, Mauritania and Senegal. At the same time, they accepted numerous public commissions from museums, prefectures, and shopping centers in France. Lagneau also participated as an individual in preparation of master plans and urban development in the Paris region between 1962 and 1965, contributing to creation of new towns. On many occasions the agency worked with Jean Prouv√© in creating innovative metal structures and with the designer Charlotte Perriand for interior design.

She debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 7 June 1988. She appeared until 1989 and briefly appeared in 1993. She returned yearly from 2001 until 2009, again from 2011 to 2013 and again from 2016 to 2017. Before she died, Frances had expressed her desire to once again become a permanent cast member. Morag has been described as an antagonistic, independent and cold character. Morag is portrayed as a tough lawyer. She has been involved in storylines such as adopting out her illegitimate daughter Bobby Simpson, being widowed, helping her brother Alf Stewart through his many legal battles and a friendship with troubled teen Aden Jefferies. She has been well received by certain critics for her feisty persona, whilst others have criticised her professional skills. Casting Frances played the role of Morag on and off for twenty-nine years. During flashbacks to the character's past, Morag was portrayed by Eve Kelman, Vanessa Goddard and Pheobe Taylor-Bush respectively. After an eight-year hiatus, in 2001 it was announced that Frances had returned to the serial and Morag would be \\"more evil\\" than ever. In 2002 Frances again returned to the serial. In 2008, Frances signed another six-month contract with the serial. She also revealed that fans miss her when she is absent. Discussing this, Frances said \\"I really adore playing her and I get a lot of people saying 'when are you coming back?\\" Of her return Frances said \\"I've played Morag for so long that I have no trouble slipping back into character. I know her so well.\\" In 2009 executive producer Cameron Welsh revealed that Frances was back filming and she was \\"very much part of plans going forward\\" for the future. In 2010, she signed another six-month contract and appeared again from January 2011. Frances admitted she wanted to become a permanent cast member. On 14 April 2011, it was announced that Frances had finished filming her final scenes. A show spokesman said \\"Morag is a much-loved Summer Bay character and we're sure we'll see her back.\\" Frances returned for another guest stint in early 2012. Frances reprised the role in late 2015 for a brief return in early 2016. In November 2016, a writer for TV Soap reported that Frances had reprised the role once more for a brief stint in 2017. Frances had hoped to return to the role in 2018 as part of the show's 30th anniversary celebrations, however, on 28 May 2018, Frances died from bladder cancer. Character development Frances branded Morag \\"a worthy and antagonistic character.\\" She also describes her as an \\"independent, amazingly strong woman, but I think she now realises family is what matters most, and she'd probably like to stay in the Bay.\\" Holy Soap said Morag is known for her \\"barbed comments and cold, cruel demeanour\\". Morag has softened over time around certain characters but Frances said \\"she still holds her own, and she's still this very strong independent person.\\" Frances believes that Morag should never find happiness with a lover because \\"she's put so much doom on everybody\\". A lot of things have happened to her, that are ultimately her own fault. Frances added: \\"So it's that nemesis that keeps coming back for the things she has done to other people\\". Morag's main connection in the serial has been with her brother Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher). There has been much fighting and antagonism between the pair. Morag later softens towards him. Frances said: \\"She's been through so many mishaps with, underneath she will always care for him and look after him.\\" She holds a great deal of \\"love and concern\\" for him which Morag is \\"reluctant to show a lot of the time\\". Frances felt it perhaps not the best development because she enjoyed their \\"wonderful fights\\". In an early storyline Morag had a daughter with Donald Fisher (Norman Coburn) and had her adopted. It was later revealed she was existing character Bobby Simpson (Nicolle Dickson). However, when the truth comes out Morag and Bobby do not want to know each other. Frances liked the fact she gave her baby away and no one knew about. She also enjoyed playing scenes in which Bobby calls her \\"mother\\" and Morag says, \\"Don't you dare call me that!\\" Frances also added: \\"I enjoyed a lot of the original storylines where Morag was fighting against her family.\\" However, Dickson felt the storyline was frustrating because felt Bobby was turning her back on her foster parents. In 2001, Morag returns to preside over the trial of Kane Phillips (Sam Atwell) for his sexual assault of Dani Sutherland (Tammin Sursok). Her ruling proved unpopular with many of the residents and caused a further rift between herself and Alf. In 2008 Morag becomes central to storylines with Aden Jefferies (Todd Lasance). Morag wants to know why he has problems because she had \\"taken a bit of a shine to him\\". Aden initially doesn't want her help. Whilst interviewed by Digital Spy Frances stated: \\"There's lots of lovely dialogue that goes on between him and I - I take him under my wing and I find out what's wrong with him.\\" He eventually looks up to her and moves in with her. Frances said: \\"So I sort of adopt him in a way.\\" She was also about to have a romance storyline. Frances revealed; \\"there's another storyline which sees an ex-lover of mine come in as a detective\\". This was Ross Buckton (David Downer), they later resume their relationship and eventually marry. Morag's 2011 return was planned for six months worth of episodes. Morag returns for husband Ross' funeral and say a \\"sad farewell\\". Her other reason is to get the murder charges against Alf dropped. As Morag had no legal work for over one year, the sudden change leaves her confused \\"about what she actually wants out of life\\". Frances said of her return \\"a lot of things happen that she gets involved with\\". Morag gets involved in Nicole Franklin's (Tessa James) plans to give her child to Marilyn Chambers (Emily Symons). Frances said Morag's \\"very much in the middle of Nicole, Marilyn and Sid\\" saying illegal things, Morag becomes involved because \\"She's very concerned with what is legal and illegal.\\" Morag was initially estranged from niece Roo Stewart (Justine Clarke). Later Roo (now played by Georgie Parker) returns, Morag remembers the young Roo and they \\"renew hostilities\\". Frances said \\"she doesn't think a leopard ever changes its spots. She knows more about Roo than Roo does herself.\\" As the storyline progresses they eventually get along better. Frances said \\"There isn't the same antagonism between the characters that there was in the past\\". As Roo is now an adult Morag \\"gives in a bit\\". Storylines Morag grew up in the bay and was close to brother, Alf. It is learned before her appearance that Morag is a magistrate. Her niece, Roo contacts her to do a background check on Alf's new fianc√©e Ailsa Hogan (Judy Nunn) which reveals Ailsa had served time in prison for murdering her abusive father.

He thanks Morag before she leaves. Reception Inside Soap said that \\"in the ever changing world or Summer Bay, It's comforting to know that one thing remains constant. Every so often, usually when a resident is in legal trouble, we're treated to an extended visit from the formidable Morag Bellingham.\\" During an interview, members of the Wellington Lions were shocked that their interviewer did not know who Morag was. Emily Dunn writing for The Sydney Morning Herald branded Morag a \\"fearsome judge\\". The Sunday Mercury branded her as \\"the frightening Morag\\". Whilst the Sunday Mail call her a \\"tough lawyer\\". Keily Oakes writing for the BBC stated that Frances is \\"known to many Australians as the feisty Morag.\\" Brian McFlarne in his book The Oxford Companion to Australian Film said Frances's \\"commanding presence and steely voice\\" were ideally suited to play a \\"soap opera super-bitch type\\" like Morag. In his book, Super Aussie Soaps, Andrew Mercado describes Morag as the \\"snooty sister\\" out of the Stewart siblings. He also opined that Bobby's situation was made worse by discovering she had Morag as a mother. Holy Soap describe Morag's most memorable moment as being \\"Finally finding true love when she married old flame Ross\\". The Liverpool Echo chose Morag finding out the truth about Ash as their television pick of the day. Ausculture placed Morag seventh on their list of Australian soap villains. They called Morag \\"cold-hearted\\" and said she will be remembered for \\"being the least liked resident of Summer Bay. After it was revealed that Bobby was in fact her love child with Donald Fisher (shagging Flathead? How could you, Morag!), she lost her husband and her credibility.\\" They added \\"Morag has sent many loved Summer Bay residents to jail, but rather than one specific moment, it is Morag's reliable day to day bitchery that earns her a place on this list. Plus her name is Morag - names don't get much more evil!\\" Bree Hoskin writing for LGBT website Gaydar, included Morag on their list of \\"Top Ten Soap Bitches\\". Describing her they stated: \\"This statuesque woman in all her shoulder-padded, Amazonian-bodied, terracotta-haired glory had a lump of coal where her heart should have been.\\" They also said she has mellowed since finding love. They concluded they too would have felt bitter in her position, quipping \\"her super-bitch demeanour was all down to the fact that her last love interest had been Donald Fisher.\\" Natalie Reilly of The Sun-Herald compiled a list of the five most \\"twisted sisters\\" on television and listed Morag as second. She added: \\"Until his snivelling, villainous elder sister, Morag, turned up to wreak havoc, the genial patriarch of Summer Bay, Alf Stewart, was doing very well.\\" Reilly also included her in her list of \\"television divas\\" and said Frances was perfect to play \\"Summer Bay's schemer, the judgmental Judge Bellingham\\". Greg Hassall of The Sydney Morning Herald said Morag's 2011 return was the latest in a trend of bringing back \\"legacy characters\\" such as Marilyn and Roo. Carena Crawford from All About Soap named her \\"ballsy Bellingham\\" the \\"super solicitor\\".

Joe Nichols and Rhonda Vincent covered the song for the tribute album Livin', Lovin', Losin': Songs of the Louvin Brothers in 2003. Despite the traditional instrumentation (mandolin and fiddle), this version has a distinctly commercial country production feel, highlighted by Nichols's lead vocal. The Brooklyn-based producer and performer Rench offered what might be termed a Gangstagrass reinterpretation of the song with banjo and turntable distortion in 2006. Anders Drerup and Kelly Prescott offered a loving tribute to the Gram Parsons-Emmylou Harris rendition of the song in the musical theatre production Grievous Angel: The Legend of Gram Parsons in 2009. In 2016, Alison Krauss performed the song as part of a tribute concert/album to Emmylou Harris.

He remained in service post-war, becoming an intelligence specialist on Japan and the Japanese military. He served through the end of World War II. World War I Chappell entered military service during December 1915 as a private in the South African Cavalry. While so assigned, he fought in the Southwest African campaign against the Germans.Shores, et al, p. 102. He then joined Inns of Court Officers Training Corps in England, and was commissioned a temporary second lieutenant on 17 June 1916. He also underwent pilot's training, receiving Royal Aero Club pilot's certificate number 3329 on 17 July 1916;on 24 August 1916 Second Lieutenant R. W. Chappell was appointed a Flying Officer in the Royal Flying Corps. In September 1916, he was posted to 27 Squadron RFC as a Martinsyde Elephant pilot. On 27 September 1916, he became one of the few pilots to score a victory while flying the ungainly Elephant. On 27 March 1917, Chappell scored a second \\"out of control\\" win while piloting an Elephant. He was withdrawn from combat during May 1917 and remanded to instructor duty at the Central Flying School. He was promoted to temporary captain and rated as a flight commander on 27 July 1917. In October 1917, he returned to the front as a flight commander and Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5a fighter pilot in 41 Squadron. On 2 February 1918, Chappell destroyed a German Albatros D.V over Erchin and sent another down out of control. On 6 March, he drove down a Pfalz D.III fighter over Niergnies, and became an ace. Ten days later, he burned a German LVG reconnaissance two-seater over Brebi√®res. A week later, on 23 March 1918, he sent down an Albatros D.V over Bourlon Wood. The next day, he drove down two Fokker Dr.I triplanes for his eighth and ninth wins. The following mid-morning, he destroyed an Albatros D.V over Sailly. There would be one final victory on 16 May 1918; a German reconnaissance machine was sent down out of control southeast of Arras. Chappell carried his rank of temporary captain over into the new Royal Air Force on its formation on 1 April 1918, although he was confirmed in this rank at some time thereafter. Post World War I On 28 October 1919, Chappell was granted a permanent commission in the Royal Air Force as a flight lieutenant, with his seniority in rank fixed as 1 August 1919. On 5 November 1919, he was assigned as a flight commander in the Air Council Inspection Squadron. The Inspection Squadron morphed into 24 Squadron; Chappell was assigned as flight commander on 1 February 1920. He continued as a flight commander, transferring on 13 December 1922 to 70 Squadron, and onwards on 20 February 1923 to 84 Squadron. On 13 October 1923, he became supernumerary at the RAF Depot. On 11 February 1924, he was assigned to test pilot duties at the Inland Area Aircraft Depot. On 15 January 1925, he was assigned to attend the School for Oriental Studies. This led to his assignment as a Language Officer at Britain's Tokyo Embassy on 9 October 1925. On 10 October 1928, he was promoted to squadron leader. On 11 February 1929, Chappell was assigned to Staff Duty with the Directorate of Operations and Intelligence. On 26 September 1930, he was seconded for duty with the Imperial Japanese Navy. On 7 April 1931, he returned to staff duty at DO&I.; In June 1931, he requalified as a Japanese Interpreter, First Class. On 12 November 1933, Chappell was appointed Officer Commanding, No. 1 Squadron. On 6 November 1935, he returned to Tokyo as an Air Attache. On 23 November 1934, he was appointed as acting but unpaid wing commander. On 1 July 1935, he was confirmed as wing commander. On 10 February 1938, he was a supernumerary at No. 1 RAF Depot. On 1 December 1938, he was assigned as senior air staff officer (SASO), No. 22 (Army Co-operation) Group. 1 November 1938 saw his further promotion to group captain. On 16 September 1939, he was appointed the Deputy Director of Intelligence. On 29 September 1946, Chappell retired as a group captain, but retained the rank of air commodore. He died on 7 February 1982, after a long retirement. Honours and awards ;Military Cross :T./Capt. Roy Williamson Chappell, R.F.C. :For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. He showed the greatest skill and courage in leading patrols, with the result that during four days' operations the formations which he led destroyed 19 enemy aeroplanes and drove down several others, the fate of which was not observed, owing to the intensity of the fighting. He has destroyed altogether five enemy machines, and has driven down seven others out of control. Endnotes Reference * Shores, Christopher, et al. (1990).

It follows the stories of the 30 women who undertook the Long March as part of the Chinese Red Army in 1934. While only 10,000 of the original 86,000 soldiers survived the 4,000 mile trek, all 30 women survived. To research the project, King interviewed the last surviving woman who marched with the First Army, and delved into historical accounts previously untranslated into English. As with his previous book, the nonfiction national bestseller Skeletons on the Zahara, he also traversed one of the most dangerous portions of the journey on foot, trekking in the Snowy Mountains and on the high-altitude bogs of western Sichuan Province (the deadliest part of the Long March). Unbound has been released in hardback, eBook, and audiobook. Writing in the Southeast Asia Review, critic Daniel Metraux wrote: \\"Unbound is a must-read for any student of modern Chinese history and ranks with Edgar Snow's Red Star Over China (1939), as one of the classic narratives of the early Chinese Communist Party.\\" Content =Historical context= The context of the story is the Long March, a \\"desperate\\" military maneuver begun in October 1934 when Mao Zedong's Red Army (the early Chinese Communist Party) were surrounded by General Chiang Kai- shek's Chinese Nationalist soldiers. Mao's army staged a massive retreat instead of surrendering, and over 86,000 soldiers of the \\"First Army\\" fled their enclave in the town of Yudu in Southeastern China. Their hope was to meet up with other Army groups and establish a new stronghold. Often under fire by Nationalist soldiers and fighter bombers, and harassed by local tribal warlords, the First Army travelled some 4,000 miles in 370 days, a distance similar to walking from San Francisco to New York City and back again. The 11 provinces they crossed included Saharan deserts, uncharted bog land with areas similar to quick sand, hundreds of miles of remote wilderness, dozens of overrun rivers, and the frigid heights of the Tibetan Plateau, which included the high-altitude grasslands of the northwestern Sichuan province. They crossed through the Great Snowy Mountains on the border of Tibet, a dangerous portion of the march that reached 14,700 feet in Dagushan. King traversed this portion by foot in his research process. At this point historically, only 20,000 of the original 86,000 of the soldiers were alive. By the time the soldiers re-established a stronghold in Yan'an in Northern China, fewer than 10,000 of those who had set out still survived. The rest had been killed by battle, disease, exhaustion, exposure (hypothermia, heat exhaustion, altitude sickness), starvation and dehydration. Paranoia killed others, as the terrified army executed an inordinate number of its own people after denouncing them as Nationalists. =The women= Thirty women undertook the Long March with the First Army, and all survived, though not all finished the Long March. Other women undertook similar Long Marches in the Fourth Army, Second Army, and 25th Army to meet up with the First Army. They ranged in age from 10 to 34, and were a diverse group of individuals. King focuses on those 30 women, telling their stories in detail, and follows representative women from the other armies in parallel narratives. They include Wang Xinlan, 10, a girl from wealth, Ma Yixang, 11, a peasant girl sold by her family, Jin \\"A Jin\\" Wiying, a 30-year-old college-educated teacher, and Zhou \\"Young Orchid\\" Shaolan, 17, a nurse who refused to go home when the army told her to. ;Ideology Many of the women saw the party as a promising feminist alternative to repressive attitudes towards Chinese women. Communist ideology was against the crippling practice of foot binding, and arranged marriages (which often became little more than forced servitude and destitution), and encouraged the education of women and introducing them into leadership roles in the workforce. Preaching equality, the Party welcomed women, particularly for recruiting and propaganda roles. ;Tasks During the Long March the women engaged in battle, carried the wounded off battle fields, often came under enemy fire, and were subject to the same trials and diseases as the men. They also carried the sick, sewed shoes and clothing, searched for healing herbs and food, and even spun wool. They shepherded stretcher teams and wounded across raging rivers. The army even carried costumes and sets so the women could entertain the troops after a day of marching. They were in charge of propaganda as well, recruiting hundreds of soldiers along the way, as well as nurses and more women. The women were generally treated as equal comrades-in- arms by their fellow soldiers. However, their situation did not always lead to complete equality, as it was not uncommon for some of the women to be relegated to traditional female tasks such as cooking and laundry. ;Pregnancy Several of the women, including Mao's wife He Zizhen, became or were already pregnant during the Long March. However, as there was no way to care for infants, particularly with the harsh terrain, half a dozen children born along the route were left with peasant families or to be discovered in abandoned villages. Mao's daughter was left in the care of an elderly blind woman, the only person who had not fled the village she lived in. Other women told stories of suffering amenorrhea, and some believe the trek across the Snowy Mountains triggered early menopause, rendering them infertile. ;After the march Of the women accompanying the First Army and Mao, two would go on to serve on the Party's Central Committee, one became a provincial party chief, and one eventually became one of the powerful Eight Elders of China. Others became leaders in arts and industry organizations, while many other survivors became victim to the atrocities and cultural purges of Mao's 1966 Cultural Revolution. Research The research took King four-and-a-half years and two trips to China, in which he interviewed the last living woman survivor of the March (who has since died). He also drew deeply from first-person accounts of survivors and a range of historical scholarship, much of which was never before translated into English. King spent July 2009 in China's Sichuan province, trekking eight days through treacherous highland bogs and hiking up the Dagushan Mountain on the Tibetan border. As with his previous book Skeletons on the Zahara, his goal was to retrace his historical protagonists' dangerous journey. King has stated his some of his research involved sifting through the inaccurate mythology and propaganda that has since warped perception of the event. Release =Publishing history= The book was published as a first edition Hardcover by Little, Brown and Company on March 24, 2010, in English only. An eBook version, published by Hachette Digital, Inc., was made available in March 2010. There is also a version available for Kindle and NOOKbook (Barnes & Noble). The Library Edition, released by Tantor Media, is a complete audiobook CD (), also released on March 24, 2010. It is 12 hours long, and spans 10 CDs. It is also available at Wal-mart. At the back of the book the publishers included a listing of all the women of the March. =Reception= The Richmond Times quoted that the book \\"is an authoritative account of the Long March, but its evocations of the marchers' experiences will linger long after the historical details slip from readers' memories.\\" The book was also received positively by other authors and historians in the field. In 2010, Southeast Review of Asian Studies stated that \\"Unbound is a must-read for any student of modern Chinese history and ranks with Edgar Snow's Red Star Over China (1939) as one of the classic narratives of the early days of the Chinese Communist Party.\\" Helen Praeger Young, author of the 2001 book Choosing Revolution: Chinese Women Soldiers on the Long March, stated \\"Unbound will appeal to every reader who likes history that is exciting, accessible and full of the stories of people who perform extraordinary acts of heroism and endurance. How wonderful that this bit of Chinese history is brought to us in such a riveting and personal way.\\" Ed Jocelyn, author of the 2006 book The Long March, stated \\"King gets to the heart of one of history's greatest adventures. He captures the blood, guts and occasional glory of the Chinese Revolution. This is a remarkable tale, by turns thrilling, inspiring and heartbreaking.\\" Lily Xiao Hong, author of the 2008 book Women of the Long March, which follows four of the 30 women, stated \\"King's book differs from earlier works on this subject in that it does not try to include too many historical details but concentrates on telling the story. He has succeeded in given just enough background information to provide a genuine and moving account of the women who went on the Long March.\\" See also *The Long March *Women in the People's Republic of China  References  Further reading *Video: Unbound by Dean King (historical footage and photos, author interview) External links * 2010 non-fiction books 21st-century history books Books about China Biographies (books) History books about China ","title":"Unbound (book)"},{"id":"31226212","text":"The Xalnene Tuff footprints are a geological academic controversy, concerning a 2005 discovery of 269 markings in a geological layer in the Valsequillo Basin, south of the city of Puebla, Mexico, which were originally interpreted to be human and animal footprints. The layer was variously dated to 40,000 years Before Present (BP) or 1.3million years BP, both dates significantly before the currently accepted date for the settlement of the Americas. A 2010 study argues that the marks were made by recent mining activities. Past theories The Clovis people were at one time considered to be the first inhabitants of the Americas, migrating into the area 13,100 years BP. However, tools, bone structures, genetics, and languages indicate that the early Americans were from many origins, and there have been some sites dated to 15‚Äì16,000 years BP. Methodology Carbon dating techniques were used. Implications of the discovery Implications of the find by Gonz√°lez et al. are that other colonisation dates that are long before Clovis need to be re- evaluated. As it is rare to find human and animal prints, these could add to the literature and experience of footprints ‚Äì Gonz√°lez et al. recommended a further study could be undertaken on the Xalnene markings. The Xalnene markings could shed light on the controversially dated Valsequillo Gravels megafauna remains, which are mostly mineralised and cannot be radiocarbon dated directly. If the Xalnene footprints are part of a migration route, the potential route could be mapped and further studies undertaken to find more evidence of human colonisation of the Americas at this time. Rebuttal Renne et al. used argon-argon dating and palaeomagnetic data suggesting that the layer in which the footprints are preserved is million years old, rather than the 40,000 years suggested by Gonz√°lez et al. Renne suggested the marks were pick marks from nearby mining operations. As a result of this, while the editor decided to publish the original paper with a postscript pointing others to Renne's paper, some coauthors of the Gonazalez paper decided to withdraw their names from the publication. Later research Gonzalez initially felt that the footprint marks could be differentiated from old quarry marks. Argon- Argon dating may be contaminated by olivine including older argon. Xenocrysts and phenocrysts were removed in a later dating of the ash material by Mark et al. 2010, which confirmed Renne's proposed age for the Xalnene Tuff. A re- examination of whether the features were footprints was conducted by Morse et al. 2010. A comparison with other markings thought to be footprints was undertaken, from various species of humans and in varying substrates and ages. This suggested that the marks were made by recent mining activity using picks. \\"The picks produce a spalling effect which removes material more widely around the point of impact,\\" says Morse. \\"Actual pick marks are visible in the quarry but this spalling seems to have caused the print-like depressions with their 'mid-foot' deep points.\\" See also *Hueyatlaco References Geology of Mexico Pre-Clovis archaeological sites in the Americas ","title":"Xalnene Tuff footprints"},{"id":"31226224","text":"Frank Wiegand (born 15 March 1943) is a German former swimmer, Olympic medalist and world record holder.

History =Early Days (2000‚Äì2003)= Initially formed as a punk trio going by the name Freeway in Guelph in 2000, the band consisted of Chris Lambert on guitar and vocals with bassist Josh Hudman and drummer Richie Gregor. The band released a 5-song EP, You or Someone Like You in 2000 with limited pressing. The band released its second EP, Shadybrook Sessions in 2001, with a notably more alternative feel than the first album while still keeping a punk vibe. The album was produced by Scott Komer in Oakville, Ontario at Parkhill Project studios (Boysnightout, Pettit Project). In 2002, shortly after the release of Shadybrook Sessions, Hudman left the band and was replaced by Adam Lambert, brother of Chris. The trio were forced to change their name due to conflict with a rap artist with the same moniker, and at this time \\"Farewell to Freeway\\" was officially born. =Year of the Sun Records (2003‚Äì2007)= With the success of Shadybrook Sessions, the band signed to local label Year of the Sun before releasing their first full-length album, Between Yesterday and Today. The album was produced by Justin Koop (Silverstein, Grade, Jersey) at The Music Gym in Burlington, Ontario. Chris and Richie provided vocals for the album, with Chris providing all the screaming. With the new album released, the band brought on second guitarist Bryan Nunn to fill out their sound. With their first full-length disc and a fourth member, the band embarked on their first Canadian tour in support of the album. The band released their first EP as a quartet, Weekdays Seldom Wake to Victory, on June 15, 2004 recorded in the home studio of Simon Vanderzand. The release offered a notably heavier sound for the band, with the transition to Adam screaming and a noted increase in the presence of screaming. The band released the title track as their first single, accompanied by their first video. With their second release on Year of the Sun, the band returned to touring, including a cross-Canada journey with Ottawa locals Driving July. In early 2005, Nunn was forced out of the band due to personal and musical differences. Later in 2005, band merch girl/roadie, Michele Walter joined the band, providing keyboards - a move to help fill out the band's sound. After the split of tour mates, Driving July, the band acquired former Driving July guitarist Drew Harwood to fill the hole aka guitarist position. The song \\"Promises of the Gods\\" was recorded between EPs and featured on the soundtrack for the independent film Desperate Souls. The release was accompanied by a video and was featured on their third Year of the Sun release. The band's third and final release on Year of the Sun was on April 11, 2006 with the release of In These Wounds produced by Mike Borkosky at the Vault in Toronto, Ontario. The album offered a noted maturity in the band's sound, bringing a cleaner more directed approach to their craft and was the defining release for the band which finally captured the sound and style they had been striving for. The band released one single with accompanying video for title track, \\"In These Wounds\\". This being the last release on Year of the Sun Records it was toured heavily and garnered the band more and more attention and headlining shows/tours. The band's song \\"In these Wounds\\" was later featured on The Best of Taste of Chaos Two., a 2007 tour compilation CD in Canada featuring song from the Taste of Chaos tours. =Victory Records (2007-Present)= In 2007 the band was still touring heavily for the In These Wounds EP when they were featured in Alternative Press magazine as one of the \\"Unsigned Bands of the Month\\". They were soon after contacted by Victory Records based out of Chicago, Illinois. The band was asked to come showcase for the staff and owner and received great reviews and were asked to sign with the Label. Farewell to Freeway was only the 6th Canadian band to ever sign with the label since its inception. After signing with Victory Records, Farewell to Freeway released their debut album Definitions on Feb 19, 2008, produced by Eric Arena (A Day to Remember, He is Legend) at ZING studios in Westfield, Massachusetts. The album led to two singles, \\"Sound Minds\\" and \\"The Desperate Age\\". Sound Minds received rotation on MTV in the US and Much Music in Canada. Keyboardist Michele Walter was later featured in Revolver magazine's \\"Hottest Chicks in Metal\\" Issue. The sophomore album on Victory came on April 14, 2009 with the release of Only Time Will Tell, produced by Paul Leavitt (Darkest Hour, The Bled, Senses Fail) at Valencia Recording Studio, in Baltimore, Maryland. The album led to one single, \\"Portrait\\", which received play on MTV and Much Music. 2009‚Äì2010 saw some frequent changes with the band's line-up, as Gregor elected to leave the band in October 2009 to pursue other interests and take a break from touring. Gregor was replaced soon after by Michael Farina. The band did not miss a beat, continuing to tour for the majority of the two years between releases. During recording of their third Victory album, the band announced that Michele had also left the band shortly before entering the studio to pursue meaningful employment, but that there was actually no need to replace her. On January 18, 2011, the band released their third album on Victory Records, Filthy Habits, produced again by Eric Arena (A Day to Remember) with assistant engineers ~J. Wildes, Jay Deluca, and Joe Mahoney, recorded at Eagle Rock Studios in Pittsfield, Vermont. This marked the first release from the band as a quartet since 2004's Weekdays Seldom Wake to Victory, and the first without founding drummer, Richie Gregor, leaving Chris Lambert as the sole founding member remaining in the band and further compromising the sound. The release was accompanied by the release of their first single, \\"Liquor? I Don't Even Know 'Er\\". Though recorded with Adam playing bass, the album also saw the shift of Adam away from bass, focusing solely on vocals live. Kyle Amos, Gregor's cousin, filled Adam's spot on bass, though he was not listed as an official member of the band. With Filthy Habits, Farewell to Freeway went for more of a raw stripped down approach creating a faster, riff heavy, and aggressive album. Shortly after the release, drummer Michael Farina parted ways with the band and was replaced with touring drummer Adam Linka, but continues to appear in music videos, photo shoots, and sometimes plays fill-in shows with band.

He moved to Dover, Delaware when he was given a job with the Delaware State Education Association (DSEA), the largest union for Delaware teachers. Bushweller left the DSEA in 1993 when Governor Tom Carper hired him as his legislative liaison. Five years later, Carper appointed him Secretary of the Department of Public Safety. When Carper was elected to the United States Senate in 2000, Bushweller became his state director until leaving the position in 2007 to launch his campaign for the Delaware Senate. Bushweller was elected to the 17th District seat in the Delaware Senate in 2008, defeating his Republican opponent, former Dover Mayor James Hutchison. Bushweller married Rocky Bushweller in 1966, with whom he has five children.

The British German Legion (or Anglo-German Legion) was a group of German soldiers recruited to fight for Britain in the Crimean War. It is not to be confused with the King's German Legion, which was active during the Napoleonic Wars. Great Britain raised a British German Legion of two regiments of light dragoons, three J√§ger Corps, and six regiments of light infantry; a British Italian Legion of five regiments of infantry, and a British Swiss Legion of three regiments of light infantry. At the end of the war, the soldiers were entitled to return to their country of origin at the public expense, but some, fearing a hostile reception at home, settled in the Cape of Good Hope. The leader of the legion was Major General Richard von Stutterheim. The British government funded and gave material support to von Stutterheim to recruit soldiers into the legion. In March 1855, von Stutterheim began raising the legion by hiring 200 agents in Germany to recruit soldiers, focusing mostly on port cities. The recruiters would go to taverns, buy beer for young men and recruit them once they were inebriated. It is believed that Stutterheim was paid $40 for each recruit, paying $20 to each recruit and pocketing the other $20, thereby earning himself $120,000 in the process. In 1856, members of the legion were billeted at Barrack field in Colchester Garrison, where many married local women. It was disbanded November 1856, having seen little or no military action due to the war having ended. Facing difficulties in repatriation by having served a foreign country, most of members of the legion were resettled in the Eastern Cape Colony, in South Africa. As a result, to this day there are place names of German origin in the area around King William's Town, including the town of Stutterheim.

Its leader is Christian democrat Claudio Scajola. Background The group around Claudio Scajola wielded a strong influence within Forza Italia, the main precursor of the PdL. During his five years as national coordinator of the party (1996‚Äì2001), Scajola built Forza Italia as a modern mass party and prepared it for several electoral victories. Scajola was minister in all governments of Silvio Berlusconi (2001‚Äì2006, 2008‚Äìpresent) until his resignation as minister of Economic Development in early 2010 over a scandal. History After having left active politics for a while in 2010, Scajola soon started to re-organize his faction, whose leading members included Massimo Berruti, Paolo Russo, Maria Teresa Armosino, Ignazio Abrignani, Michele Scandroglio, Salvatore Cicu, Sandro Biasotti, Roberto Cassinelli, Raffaele Lauro, Paolo Tancredi and Giustina Destro. Most of them were former Christian Democrats, while others shared with Scajola the regional upbringing, hailing from Liguria, Scajola's power base, or neighbouring Piedmont. In November 2010 the Christopher Columbus Foundation (FCL) was formed by Scajola in order to re-discover the original spirit of Forza Italia. The association was joined by Scajoliani and also by Antonio Martino, a former Liberal who was number two of Forza Italia in 1994 and minister of Foreign Affairs in Berlusconi's first government, as well as other liberals, such as Gregorio Fontana, and leading Christian democrats of the party, including Mario Baccini and Osvaldo Napoli. In early 2011 Scajola, who had been cleared of any wrongdoing, started to prepare a strong comeback. At the beginning of March he declared that he had 62 MPs behind him and asked Berlusconi either a major role in the party organization or a return in government. Soon after Scajola criticized how the fusion between Forza Italia and National Alliance (AN) had been done, demanded a bigger role for those coming from Forza Italia and threatened to form separate parliamentary groups from the PdL. The threat was renewed in October 2011, when Scajola and his followers asked for a new government, still led by Berlusconi, but with the Union of the Centre in it. A vote of confidence on Berlusconi's government was set on 14 October 2011, and Scajola announced that his group would vote for the government. However, he was not able two prevent two Venetian deputies, Giustina Destro and Fabio Gava from voting against the government, which survived the vote anyway. On 2 November Destro and Gava, along with Roberto Antonione, Giorgio Stracquadanio, Isabella Bertolini and Giancarlo Pittelli, promoted an open letter in which they asked Berlusconi to step down and called for a new executive. Four \\"moderate\\" Scajoliani (Paolo Russo, Pietro Testoni, Andrea Orsini and Guglielmo Picchi) were present at the meeting, but did not sign the letter. Contextually, Antonione announced that he was leaving the party.

Taney (1836‚Äì1864) The Supreme Court of the United States, under Chief Justice Roger B. Taney (1836‚Äì1864), issued several important decisions on the status of aboriginal title in the United States, building on the opinions of aboriginal title in the Marshall Court. The Taney Court heard Fellows v. Blacksmith (1857) and New York ex rel. Cutler v. Dibble (1858), the first two aboriginal title cases involving indigenous plaintiffs to reach the Supreme Court since Cherokee Nation v. Georgia (1830), and the first two cases won by indigenous parties in the Supreme Court. In Marsh v. Brooks (1850), in dicta, the Court declared: \\"That an action of ejectment could be maintained on an Indian right to occupancy and use, is not open to question.\\" The remaining cases involved no indigenous parties. In United States v. Brooks (1850), the Court refused to inquire into allegations of fraud on the part of Commissioner Jehiel Brooks in negotiating a treaty with the Caddo. Following the Marshall Court's precedent, the Taney Court continued to uphold the validity of state land grants issued before the extinguishment of aboriginal title. Depending on the applicable law, the Taney Court held that aboriginal title could sometimes be asserted as a defense in trespass, ejectment, and writ of right actions, even by those with no claim to title themselves. United States v. Brooks (1850) In 1835, a treaty negotiated by Commissioner Jehiel Brooks provided for the Caddos to cede certain lands to Franois Grappe and his three sons, Jacques, Dominique, and Balthazar Grappe.United States v. Brooks, 51 U.S. (10 How.) 442, 450‚Äì51 (1850). The Grappes sold the land to Col. Brooks.51 U.S. at 460. On February 24, 1846, the United States attorney for the District of Louisiana filed suit against Col. Brooks, alleging that he had fraudulently included the lands within those ceded by the Caddos to the United States.51 U.S. at 454, 459‚Äì60. At trial, the judge refused to allow the federal government to read various documents into evidence; the jury returned a verdict for Brooks.51 U.S. at 456‚Äì58. The Court affirmed, holding that \\"Brooks being the alienee of the Grappes for the entire reservation, he may hold it against any claim of the United States, as his alienors would have done.\\" The court refused to consider \\"conjectural intimations, which were made in the argument of it, concerning the influences which were used to secure the reservation, or the designs of the commissioner in having it done.\\" The Seneca cases (1857‚Äì1858) Ely S. Parker, the first indigenous plaintiff to prevail in the U.S. Supreme Court The two aboriginal title cases involving indigenous litigants to reach the Taney Court both involved the Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians and the Tonawanda Reservation, both argued by John H. Martindale (first as the district attorney of Genesee County, New York, then in private practice), and both originated in the New York state courts. =Fellows v. Blacksmith (1857)= Fellows v. Blacksmith (1857) was the first litigation of aboriginal title in the U.S. Supreme Court by an indigenous plaintiff since Cherokee Nation v. Georgia (1831), and the first Supreme Court case won by an indigenous plaintiff. According to a contemporary New York Times article: \\"The questions involved are of great magnitude, and affect more or less the title to a large portion of the State of New York.\\" The Court affirmed a judgement for the plaintiff on a cause of action of trespass. Moreover, the Court held that Indian removal treaties could not be enforced by private parties, either through self-help or through the courts. Fellows also underscored the importance of the trust relationship between the federal government and the tribes in holding that the federal government retained the sole discretion to enforce, or not enforce, such treaties against the tribes.Fellows v. Blacksmith, 60 U.S. (19 How.) 366 (1857). =New York ex rel. Cutler v. Dibble (1858) = New York ex rel. Cutler v. Dibble (1858) was a companion case to Fellows. An individual Seneca party of interest, prevailed in a suit brought under a New York statute authorizing state district attorneys to remove non-Indian trespassers from Indian lands in county courts. At the time Fellows was decided, this case had reached the U.S. Supreme Court but had not yet been argued.Joshua L. Brown, The Tonawanda Indians, Letter to the Editor of the New York Times (February 4, 1858). The defendant-appellants, before the Court, unsuccessfully challenged the state statute under the Indian Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, the federal Nonintercourse Act and the Treaty of Buffalo Creek between the federal government and the Senecas.New York ex rel. Cutler v. Dibble, 62 U.S. (21 How.) 366 (1858). Because the Senecas relied on state law, and the defendants relied on federal law, the case is essentially the inverse of Nonintercourse Act litigation of over the next 150 years. Dicta in disputes between non-Indians Several decisions note the extinguishment of aboriginal title as a condition of land grants.Clements v. Warner, 65 U.S. (24 How.) 394, 396 (1860); Dubuque & P.R. Co. v. Litchfield, 64 U.S. (23 How.) 66, 78 (1859); Hale v. Gaines, 63 U.S. (22 How.) 144, 147‚Äì59 (1859); Dodge v. Woolsey, 59 U.S. (18 How.) 331, 353 (1855); Thredgill v. Pintard, 53 U.S. (12 How.) 24, 24 (1851); Howard v. Ingersoll, 54 U.S. (13 How.) 381, 410‚Äì11 (1851); United States v. D'Auterive, 51 U.S. (10 How.) 609, 626 (1850); Le Roy v. Beard, 49 U.S. (8 How.) 451, 454 (1850); Missouri v. Iowa, 48 U.S. (7 How.) 660, 668 (1849); Hickey's Lessee v. Stewart, 44 U.S. (3 How.) 750, 760 (1845); Martin v. Waddell's Lessee, 41 U.S. (16 Pet.) 367, 388 (1842); Clark v. Smith, 38 U.S. (13 Pet.) 195, 198 (1839). More than once, in dicta, the Court cited the purchase of aboriginal title in New Jersey.Jefferson Branch Bank v. Skelly, 66 U.S. (1 Black) 436, 447 (1861); Piqua Branch of State Bank of Ohio v. Knoop, 57 U.S. (16 How.) 369, 385‚Äì86 (1853); Armstrong v. Treasurer of Athens County, 41 U.S. (16 Pet.) 281, 281 (1842). =Sac and Fox Half-Breed Tract cases (1850‚Äì1854)= The Sac and Fox Half-Breed Tract at issue (in pink, labelled 120) Justice John Catron wrote on opinion on aboriginal title while on the Tennessee Supreme Court of Errors and Appeals and cited it in Marsh v. Brooks. An 1824 federal treaty with the Sac and Fox tribes set aside a 119,000 acre Half-Breed Tract in Iowa between the Mississippi River and the Des Moines River. The treaty declared the lands inalienable. In 1834, Congress transferred the fee title to the lands to the Half-Breeds, rendering the land transferable. By 1841, the Tract was owned in fee almost entirely by non- Indians. The Taney Court heard for land disputes involving the Iowa Half-Breed Tract: the first two from the Supreme Court of the Iowa Territory; the second two from the United States District Court for the District of Iowa. ;Marsh v. Brooks I (1850) Marsh v. Brooks (1850), a writ of right action, involved a plaintiff holding an 1839 federal land patent (issued under an 1836 statute) and a trespasser defendant asserting that the plaintiff's title was invalid because of the Half-Breed Tract treaty and legislation. The Iowa Supreme Court refused to let the defendants raise this defense; Justice John Catron, for a unanimous Court, reversed and remanded.Marsh v. Brooks, 49 U.S. (8 How.) 223 (1850). The Court provided the following dicta on aboriginal title: > This Indian title consisted of the usufruct and right of occupancy and > enjoyment; and, so long as it continued, was superior to and excluded those > claiming the reserved lands by patents made subsequent to the ratification > of the treaty; they could not disturb the occupants under the Indian title. > That an action of ejectment could be maintained on an Indian right to > occupancy and use, is not open to question. This is the result of the > decision in [Johnson v. McIntosh and Cornet v. Winton, written by Justice > Catron while he was on the Tennessee high court] . . . .49 U.S. at 232 > (citation omitted). The Supreme Court held that an ejectment defendant could assert the defense of aboriginal title, even if the defendant did not even claim to hold the aboriginal title: > It was also insisted on the argument here, that, as it did not appear that > any half-breeds, or their heirs or assigns, were in existence when the trial > below took place, the outstanding title relied on could not be set up by the > defendants. To which it may be answered, that it was necessary for the > plaintiffs to show themselves to be owners of the land . . . ; and if the > land had been previously granted, nothing was left to pass by the second > patent . . . . The general rule is, that, where the same land has been twice > granted, the elder patent may be set up in defence by a trespasser, when > sued by a claimant under the younger grant, without inquiring as to who is > the actual owner of the land at the time of the trial.49 U.S. at 233‚Äì34. ;Webster v. Reid (1850) In Webster v. Reid (1850), the Court declared unconstitutional an Iowa territorial statute that authorized bench trials against \\"‚Äòthe Owners of the Half-breed Lands lying in Lee County,\\" with notice by publication.Webster v. Reid, 52 U.S. (11 How.) 437 (1850). ;Marsh v. Brooks II (1852) Marsh v. Brooks (1852) involved the same parties that had been before the Court in 1850. Having re-filed in federal court, the plaintiffs again prevailed, and this time, the Court (again, the opinion authored by Justice Catron) affirmed.Marsh v. Brooks, 55 U.S. (14 How.) 513 (1852). In dicta, the Court offered the following interpretation of the status of aboriginal title in the Spanish Louisiana territory: > That the Sacs and Foxes did claim the country generally, where this land > lies, is not controverted; nor was their claim ceded to the United States > till 1824. And this raises the question whether, according to Spanish usage, > whilst that power governed Louisiana, an existing Indian claim to territory > precluded inhabitation and cultivation under a permit to inhabit and > cultivate a particular place designated in the permit, and which was in the > Indian country. Spain had no treaties with any of the Indian tribes in > Louisiana, fixing limits to their claims, so far as we are informed. The > Indians were kept quiet, and at peace with Spanish subjects, by kind > treatment and due precautions, which did not allow obtrusion on lands > claimed by them, without written permits from the Governor; but that such > permits were usual, cannot be doubted.55 U.S. at 522. Again in dicta, the Court seemed to apply the concept of adverse possession to aboriginal lands: > [The plaintiff's tract] was held and improved by authority of the Spanish > government, and claimed as individual property, to which the Indian right of > possession did not extend; of this the Indians never complained, nor do they > now complain; no half-breed owner and Indian descendant is defending this > suit; it is defended by trespassers, showing no color of claim under the > half-breeds, or any one else; shelter is sought under the assumption that > Honor√©'s permit and inhabitation were neither known or recognized by the > Sacs and Foxes, and that therefore, the additional article of the treaty of > 1804, cannot protect the title of Reddick. . . . [I]t must be presumed that > the Indians both had knowledge and assented to Honore√©'s claim; and we are > furthermore of opinion, that the Indian tribes, and the half-breeds, who > claim under them, must be held to knowledge, and to consent, that Honor√© > took and held, rightful possessions, from the fact of his open and notorious > actual occupancy, and holding for himself, in their midst.55 U.S. at 524. ;Coy v. Mason (1854) Coy v. Mason (1854), another dispute between non-Indians, remarked in dicta that the Half-Breed Tract had been held \\"by the same title, and in the same manner, that other Indian titles are held.\\"Coy v. Mason, 58 U.S. (17 How.) 580, 580 (1854). =Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857)= In dicta, Dred Scott v. Sandford made several comments regarding aboriginal title.Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393 (1857). Chief Justice Taney was not present at the opinion announcement for Fellows because he was at home working on the Dred Scott opinion, which was announced the next day.Armstrong, 1990, at 60. Dred Scott, in dicta, opined the following on aboriginal title: > The situation of [blacks] was altogether unlike that of the Indian race. The > latter . . . were situated in territories to which the white race claimed > the ultimate right of dominion. But that claim was acknowledged to be > subject to the right of the Indians to occupy it as long as they thought > proper, and neither the English nor colonial Governments claimed or > exercised any dominion over the tribe or nation by whom it was occupied, nor > claimed the right to the possession of the territory, until the tribe or > nation consented to cede it.Dred Scott, 60 U.S. at 403‚Äì04. Justice John Catron, concurring in Dred Scott, also noted in dicta that: > [B]ecause Congress has express power to regulate commerce among the Indian > tribes and to prohibit intercourse with the Indians, that therefore Dr. > Emerson's title might be defeated within the country ceded by the Indians to > the United States as early as 1805 . . . .60 U.S. at 528 (Catron, J., > concurring). =State land grants= ;Lattimer's Lessee v. Poteet (1840) Lattimer's Lessee v. Poteet (1840) was an appeal from a judgment for the defendant in an ejectment action in the United States circuit court of North Carolina. It was undisputed that the plaintiff's title arose from a North Carolina state land grant to Cherokee lands within the boundaries demarcated by the federal Cherokee treaties. The sole defense was that the state grant was void because of the federal Cherokee treaties.Lattimer's Lessee v. Poteet, 39 U.S. (14 Pet.) 4 (1840). Before the Supreme Court, the plaintiffs argued that it was \\"not in the power of the United States and the Cherokee nation, by the treaty of Tellico in 1798, to vary in any degree the treaty line of Holston; so as to affect private rights, or the rights of North Carolina.\\"39 U.S. at 13. The Court responded that, as a matter of fact, the Tellico treaty had merely confirmed the Holston treaty boundaries, both of which were to be interpreted by the parties to the treaty.39 U.S. at 13‚Äì14. The Court held that, as a matter of federal law, the state grants were not void merely because they were granted before the Cherokee's title was extinguished: \\"The Indian title being only a right of occupancy, the state of North Carolina had the power to grant the fee in the lands, subject to this right. \\"39 U.S. at 14. But, under the North Carolina surveying statute as interpreted by the North Carolina courts, such grants were invalid. Thus, the Court affirmed. Chief Justice Taney concurred in the judgment, but disagreed that the political branches had interpreted the Tellico treaty to demarcate the relevant boundary.39 U.S. at 15‚Äì16 (Taney, C.J., concurring). Justice Catron also concurred. He \\"admit[ted] . . . that the contracting parties had the power afterwards to settle its position\\" but argued that \\"they never saw proper to do [so].\\"39 U.S. at 16 (Catron, J., concurring). Catron argued that \\"[t]he land in controversy was granted before this line was run\\" and thus that the treaty of Holston \\"will manifestly tend to disturb titles made in reference to another line.\\"39 U.S. at 17‚Äì18 (Catron, J., concurring). Catron concurred only because \\"the bill of exceptions sets forth not a single fact; and the correctness of the instructions of the Court below cannot therefore be tested by the evidence given on the trial; whether they are right or wrong, it is impossible for me to say\\"; thus, he defaulted to a \\"presumption that the instructions were proper.\\"39 U.S. at 18 (Catron, J. concurring). Justice Wayne dissented without opinion.39 U.S. at 16. ;Kinney v. Clark (1844) Kinney v. Clark (1844) involved a Virginia land grant given before the Cherokee aboriginal title to the lands had been extinguished.Kinney v. Clark, 43 U.S. (2 How.) 76 (1844). The Court opined that: \\"If Clark's entry was made, however, on lands reserved [for the Cherokees] from location by the act of 1779, then it is void, because the act did not open the land office for such purpose, nor extend to the excepted lands.\\"43 U.S. at 108. The Court quoted at length from the Long Island treaty (1777) and noted: \\"This treaty fully explains why the Cherokee country was excepted from the land-law of 1779, and locations on it prohibited; no reasons could add force to its stipulations.\\"43 U.S. at 113. However, the Court determined that: \\"The opinion of the [Virginia] Court of Appeals in 1791 is conclusive to the point-that if the land in dispute was not Cherokee country, it was not within the exception of the land-law of 1779; and that Clark's title is good, as all the lands in the commonwealth not excepted, were subject to appropriation on Treasury warrants, although claimed by Indians whose lands were not protected from location by statute.\\"43 U.S. at 121‚Äì22. Finally, the decision of the United State circuit court of Kentucky was affirmed on the basis of Kentucky's statute of limitations.43 U.S. at 125‚Äì26. =Spanish Florida and Louisiana= ;Mitchel v. United States (1841) The plaintiff in Mitchel v. United States (1841) sued the federal government in the Florida state courts, basing his claim on a grant from the Creek and Seminole Indians, ratified by the Spanish during their rule of Florida. The plaintiff's claim was allowed only in part, and he appealed.Mitchel v. United States 40 U.S. (15 Pet.) 52 (1841). Justice Wayne, noted that the case involved the same plaintiff as in Mitchel v. United States (1835), a decision of the Marshall Court.40 U.S. at 80‚Äì81. Therefore, Wayne opined, \\"[t]he case before us does not require any discussion upon the nature and extent of the property held by the Florida Indians in these lands, under Spain. That was satisfactorily done in the decision given by this court in the original case.\\"40 U.S. at 83‚Äì84. The Court further noted: \\"We will not enter into the question, how far the appropriation of the land for a fortress, by order of the government, extinguished the Indian title. It might be done successfully, upon the positions taken by this court in respect to the rights of European monarchs to Indian lands in North America, in Johnson v. McIntosh.40 U.S. at 89 (citation omitted). ;Chouteau v. Molony (1853) In Chouteau v. Molony (1853), Justice Wayne, for a unanimous Court, interpreted a grant from the Fox tribe to be a mere right to mine lead, rather than a grant of land because it was not confirmed by the Spanish authorities as required by Spanish law and because it included a Fox village which the tribe would have been unlikely to cede.Chouteau v. Molony, 57 U.S. (16 How.) 203 (1853). =Others= ;Maney v. Porter (1846) Chief Justice Taney held in Maney v. Porter (1846) that the Court had no jurisdiction to review state court actions claiming money damages from fraudulent land sales where: > [T]he suit was not brought to uphold any title or right which the > complainant claimed under the Choctaw treaty, or under the law of Congress > which he states to have been passed upon the subject. For he does not ask > for a conveyance of the reservations, nor of the Indian title to them. And > he does not even aver that these claims are valid, or that he has any title > to them; but, on the contrary, charges that none of the claims had been > secured, and states that he did not think it probable that they would be > obtained by the assignees of the Indians. And as the case has been removed > here from the decision of a state court, we have no right to review it > unless the complainant claimed some right under the treaty with the Choctaws > or the act of Congress . . . . In the case before us, no such title, right, > or privilege was claimed by the bill, and of course no decision was made > against it in the state court. We therefore can exercise no jurisdiction . . > . and are not authorized to examine any questions of fraud or failure of > consideration, or breach of contract . . . .Maney v. Porter, 45 U.S. (4 > How.) 55, 57‚Äì58 (1846). ;Gaines v. Nicholson (1850) In Gaines v. Nicholson (1850), Justice Nelson wrote the following in dicta: > There is no doubt but that all persons in whose behalf reservations were > made under [an Indian] treaty . . . and had made improvements thereon . . . > were entitled to the section, including their improvements, in preference to > any other right that could have been previously acquired under the > government; because the land embraced within the section was so much > excepted from the cession. No previous grant of Congress could be paramount, > according to the right of occupancy which this government has always > conceded to the Indian tribes within her jurisdiction. > It was so much carved out of the Territory ceded, and remained to the Indian > occupant, as he had never parted with it. He holds, strictly speaking, not > under the treaty of cession, but under his original title, confirmed by the > government in the act of agreeing to the reservation.Gaines v. Nicholson, 50 > U.S. (9 How.) 356, 365 (1850). ;Doe v. Wilson (1859) In Doe v. Wilson (1859), Justice Catron, for the Court, held that a treaty with the Pottawatomie created individual, alienable allotments; thus, the grantee of an individual Pottowatomie had good title.Doe v. Wilson, 64 U.S. (23 How.) 457 (1859).

Most tornadoes form in the U.S., although some events may take place internationally. Tornado statistics for older years like this often appear significantly lower than modern years due to fewer reports or confirmed tornadoes. Synopsis Numbers for 1982 were slightly above average, both in terms of number of tornadoes and number of fatalities. Probably the most notable tornado events of the year was the April 2‚Äì3 tornado outbreak resulting in 29 fatalities primarily in Texas and Oklahoma and the May 29 Marion, Illinois tornado which killed ten people. Events Confirmed tornado total for the entire year 1982 in the United States. January Throughout January, 18 tornadoes were confirmed across the United States. This is above the annual average of 15. =January 3‚Äì4= In early January, a major winter storm affected nearly the entire Contiguous United States, including widespread blizzard conditions in the Midwest. Along the southern edge of the storm, an early season tornado outbreak took place across the Gulf Coast. The first tornado was an F3 that killed one person and injured 17 others in Newton County, Mississippi, becoming the first killer January tornado since 1978. Sixty structures were damaged or destroyed by the tornado, leaving $2 million in losses.Grazulis, p. 628 Four F2 tornadoes touched down across Alabama during the course of the outbreak. In Clanton, Alabama, two of these tornadoes struck the town an hour apart, forcing rescuers to seek shelter before the arrival of the second. Overall, 11 tornadoes touched down, leaving one person dead, 34 injured and $4.3 million in losses. February In the Contiguous United States, only one tornado touched down during the month of February, marking a record low value that would not be matched until 2010. However, two additional tornadoes took place in Honolulu, Hawaii, both of which were rated F2. Nearly 24 homes sustained damage from one of these tornadoes. March There were 60 tornadoes confirmed in the US in March. =March 13‚Äì17= There were five fatalities and 24 tornadoes on March 15, including an F3 tornado that killed two in Kansas and Missouri. =March 18‚Äì20= An F4 tornado moved through Texas and Oklahoma on March 18. =March 28‚Äì31= A tornado killed one person in Illinois on March 30. April There were 150 tornadoes confirmed in the US in April. =April 2‚Äì3= A major outbreak on April 2‚Äì3 resulted in over 60 tornadoes and 29 fatalities. Three tornadoes were rated F4, while another tornado near Broken Bow, Oklahoma (no fatalities) was rated F5, although the rating is disputed. One F4 tornado in Paris, Texas resulted in 10 fatalities and 170 injuries. =April 14‚Äì17= =April 19‚Äì20= =April 25‚Äì27= May There were 329 tornadoes confirmed in the US in May and 14 fatalities. At the time, this set a record for the most tornadoes during the month of May. =May 9-June 2= Between May 9 and June 2, at least one tornado touched down each day across the United States in a prolonged tornado outbreak sequence, encompassing 312 tornadoes across four separate storm systems. Altus, Oklahoma tornado May 11, 1982 On May 11, 41 people were injured by an F3 tornado on the southeast side of Altus, Oklahoma before another F3 tornado killed two people and injured 18 in Blair, Oklahoma. The worst day of the sequence was May 29, when a small, but deadly series of tornadoes touched down in Illinois, Missouri, and Indiana, with Marion, Illinois being the hardest hit. 10 fatalities occurred there after the town took a direct hit from an F4 tornado. The outbreak also produced a F3 tornado affecting Conant, Illinois and several weaker tornadoes in the surrounding area. June There were 196 tornadoes confirmed in the US in June, resulting in four fatalities. =June 10‚Äì18= On June 15, there were 7 tornadoes confirmed in Michigan (one as high as F3) causing one fatality and 6 injuries. The one fatality occurred in Jackson County and three of the injuries occurred in Saginaw County. July There were 95 tornadoes confirmed in the US in July. August There were 34 tornadoes confirmed in the US in August. September There were 38 tornadoes confirmed in the US in September, resulting in two fatalities. October There were 9 tornadoes confirmed in the US in October. November There were 19 tornadoes confirmed in the US in November. December There were 96 tornadoes confirmed in the US in December. At the time, the number of tornadoes in the month vastly exceeded the previous record of 61 set in 1967. Arkansas and Missouri both experienced the highest number of December tornadoes on record, with 46 and 30 touching down in the respective states. This value was later eclipsed in 2002 when 97 tornadoes were confirmed. =December 24= Three people were killed in Arkansas and Missouri during the 1982 Christmas tornado outbreak. One tornado on Christmas Eve was rated F4 that traveled from Arkansas to Missouri.

Burke, along with William Wills, John King and Charley Gray, reached the mangroves on the estuary of the Flinders River near where the town of Normanton now stands, on 9 February 1861. Flooding rains and swamps meant they never saw open ocean. Upon returning, the expedition was weakened by starvation and exposure, and was hampered by the tropical monsoon downpours of the wet season.

Burke, along with William Wills, John King and Charley Gray, reached the mangroves on the estuary of the Flinders River near where the town of Normanton now stands, on 9 February 1861. Flooding rains and swamps meant they never saw open ocean. Upon returning, the expedition was weakened by starvation and exposure, and was hampered by the tropical monsoon downpours of the wet season.

He began by driving down an Albatros two-seater reconnaissance plane over Passchendaele on 25 September 1917. The next day, he destroyed an Albatros D.III in the same vicinity. On 8 October 1917, Firth was appointed a flight commander, with an accompanying promotion to temporary captain. He set an Albatros D.III aflame on 26 October, to become an ace. On 31 October, he and Peter Carpenter shared in the destruction of a German reconnaissance plane. He scored three \\"out of control\\" victories during November to end the year 1917 with nine wins. No. 45 Squadron then moved theaters, to Italy. On the second day of the new year, Firth shared in the destruction of an enemy reconnaissance plane east of Conegliano and became a double ace. On 18 February 1918, he was awarded the Military Cross for his heroics. \\"He has on various occasions, during a period of two months, completely destroyed two enemy planes and shot down out of control seven others. The latter, by reason of the manner in which they were observed to go to earth, were probably all rendered useless for further service. He has set a very fine example as a patrol leader, and has displayed much skill and courage.\\" Firth would score one more time, driving down an Albatros D.V over Ceggia on 27 March 1918. On 4 September 1918, Firth was promoted to temporary major while posted to the Central Flying School as an instructor. He was also awarded the Italian Bronze Medal of Military Valor on 2 November 1918. Post war On 14 February 1919, Firth was transferred to the unemployed list of the Royal Air Force. On 29 April 1919, he married a minister's daughter, Ruth Ellen [Eleanor] Hodgson, at Winchester Cathedral. At the time of Firth's death on 23 August 1931, he was in business as a steel manufacturer and residing at Spital House, Blyth, Worksop, Nottingham. Endnotes Reference * Shore, Christopher, et al.

Construction on the church began in 1800 thanks in large part to the financial backing of the British royal family. The church‚Äôs primary architect remains a mystery, but Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn (and father of Queen Victoria) was highly influential & involved in the design process. It is located at the corner of Brunswick and Cornwallis Streets in the North End district. The church was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1983 given its associations with the early history of Halifax and its Palladian architecture. Little Dutch Church Otto William Schwartz (tablet removed from Little Dutch Church to St. George's Round Church in 1831) The congregation of the Round Church was founded at the much smaller Little Dutch (Deutsch) Church, located just a few blocks north at the corner of Brunswick and Gerrish Streets. The Little Dutch Church was founded by German Lutherans who had settled in Halifax by special command by Edward Cornwallis, who deemed the other settlers of Halifax to be unsatisfactory for founding a church. These \\"foreign Protestants‚Äù, who were among the founding members of Halifax, started construction on the Little Dutch Church in 1756. These settlers used a house they had acquired after trading lumber and converted it into a one-room church, known as a ‚Äúsaalkirche‚Äù. Construction on the pioneer church was finished in 1758 and the steeple and belfry were later added in 1760. The congregation was extremely poor, but they badly wanted a German Lutheran minister. Services were originally held in German, preached by laypersons and were of an evangelical Lutheran bent, despite the church falling under the supervision of St. Paul's Church. However, in 1784, the congregation was granted their wish for a German Lutheran minister with Bernard Michael Houseal. Because of the congregation's poverty, they could not afford the minister by themselves. In order to keep their minister, the only option the congregation was presented with was by fulfilling the conditions of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel to gain their support. Thereby, the church became officially Anglican but retained its Lutheran traditions. Just over 40 years later, the congregation outgrew the LDC and work on The Round Church began. Prince Edward's design Invasion of Martinique (1809) Monument, St. George's Church, Halifax, Nova Scotia At the end of the 18th century, Halifax was a colonial outpost that lacked aesthetically pleasing public buildings. Prince Edward, who was stationed with the Halifax garrison between 1794 and 1800, was determined to rectify this situation. He spearheaded a building campaign that included the construction of the Prince‚Äôs Lodge (Music Room), the Martello Tower, Halifax Citadel Clock Tower, and St. George‚Äôs Round Church: all inspired by the Palladian style of architecture. Prince Edward, his elder brother Frederick and their father, George III supported preparations for the Round Church. George III was a particularly great contributor to the construction of the church with his ¬£200 donation. At the request of the Prince, John Henry Fleiger was also involved with William Hughes and John Merrick in 1798-99 to prepare designs for a church in north Halifax. In a retrospective article published on the death of Fleiger's daughter in 1890, she is reported to have recalled events that occurred during the life of the Duke of Kent who, she noted, \\"....had a great love of architecture peculiar in form, and Mr. Fleiger, at his request, designed the plan, or rough sketch, for the Round Church (Morning Herald [Halifax], 1 Feb. 1890, 1, col. 7). The \\"Round Church\\" was a reference to Saint George's Anglican Church, Brunswick Street, HALIFAX, N.S., built 1800-04; burned 1994; rebuilt 1996-98 (M. Rosinski, Architects of Nova Scotia: A Biographical Dictionary, 1994, 39). The Rev. George Wright held the first service on July 19, 1801. There is also a plaque in the church commemorating the three crew members that died in the Invasion of Martinique (1809). St. George's ceased to be entirely circular following the addition of the apsidal chancel and entrance in 1827. The entrance was later altered to be more square, which, although less in keeping with the Palladian style of architecture, allows for a more convenient and accessible entrance. There was talk of converting the entrance back to being round during the restoration project of the 1980s, but those plans did not come to fruition. Early financial troubles Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres buried in the crypt of St. George's (1824) The cost of the church was high and the congregation, never wealthy, struggled to settle it. Private donations, subscriptions, and pew leases made up a great deal of the funds. However, problems arose because some of the funds were contingent on St George‚Äôs full adoption of the doctrines of the Church of England. The congregation agreed to follow Anglican liturgical practices and employ an Anglican priest, but they refused to recognize Anglican hierarchy. The congregation worried that the Anglican Church would swallow St George‚Äôs. They insisted upon maintaining their German governing rules and that the church‚Äôs property remain in the hands of the elder and wardens, not the diocese. Instead of honouring the written promises from the congregation to establish Anglican liturgy and clergy at St George‚Äôs, Bishop Charles Inglis worked against the Round Church. Inglis re-routed funds, explicitly dissuaded donors from giving to the church, and proposed building a chapel of St Paul‚Äôs in the vicinity to choke out the struggling congregation. In 1811, desperate and facing financial ruin, the congregation finally surrendered and submitted themselves fully to the authority of the Church of England ‚Äì and of the bishop. The only thing that the largely-German congregation refused to relinquish was the property and buildings of St George‚Äôs, which remain to this day the property of those holding the offices of Rector and Wardens. Regardless of the internal debate, Bishop Charles Inglis was less than impressed with the outcome. Despite the concessions made by the German congregation, Inglis suggested to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (SPG) that St George‚Äôs be abandoned as an Anglican church. As a result, the monies promised by the SPG and the Governor‚Äôs office were withheld from the struggling congregation. Then, claiming he had no power or persuasion over either organization, Inglis refused St. George‚Äôs financial support and threatened the church with closure. Reverend Robert Fitzgerald Uniacke - Rector (1825-1870) Unfortunately for Inglis, his harsh stance was ineffective and pushed the already alienated congregation over the edge. Instead of caving, as he had hoped, they informed his Reverence that they did not need his money and that they would not be selling their church for funds. Even without a completed interior, they had enough money to fix leaks in the church‚Äôs roof and that would be enough. They also repealed some of the inclusive changes they had made to appease Inglis earlier. For example, members of the Church of England could attend services, but only the descendants of German Lutherans were granted voting rights. Inglis‚Äôs successor, Bishop Robert Stanser was willing to compromise, and in 1819 St George‚Äôs finally received the funds it had been promised in exchange for adopting Anglican liturgy and internal structure. Under the leadership of Reverend Robert Fitzgerald Uniacke, St. George‚Äôs became its own independent parish in 1827. Involvement with Titanic Halifax was used as a point of return for many of the rescue operations going to Titanic. Included in one of these rescue and retrieval missions was Minia, whose commander, Captain deCarteret, asked that his own rector accompany the voyage to conduct memorial services at sea. As thanks, Father Henry Ward Cunningham, was presented with a deck chair from Titanic, which he in turn donated to the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic. St. George's was further involved in the sinking of Titanic when the funeral of the Unknown Child (now identified as Sidney Leslie Goodwin) took place at St. George's. Sidney Goodwin has since been moved to the Fairview Lawn Cemetery, with many other graves of the victims of Titanic. Halifax Explosion Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres Monument, St. George's Church, Halifax, Nova Scotia Given St. George's location in Halifax's North End neighbourhood so close to point zero of the Halifax Explosion, damages were far less extensive than might be expected. A large part of this may be due to being sheltered by St. Patrick's Catholic Church across the street. Apart from the windows and doors and a collapsed chimney, St. George's major loss was its organ, which was replaced with a 1912 Casavant organ. St. George's was so well-sheltered from the blast, in fact, that the rectory could shelter 22 people following the blast, even without windows or doors. The hall suffered structural damages; however, St. George's could generally count itself lucky for surviving the blast intact. Sadly, St. George's lost 25 members of its parish, including 7 young children, from the explosion. The fire Robert Fitzgerald Uniacke Monument, St. George's Church, Halifax, Nova Scotia On June 2, 1994, fire was accidentally set to the Round Church, causing the dome to crumble and destroying approximately 40 per cent of the building. The fundraising effort received a donation from Prince Charles, who had also attended service at the church in 1983 with Princess Diana. Later in 1994, Prince Philip visited St. George's after taking a personal interest following the fire at Windsor Castle two years earlier; the province's gift to Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke during that visit made a $1,000 donation to the restoration project. In an effort to avoid debt, the restoration took six years to complete and happened in increments when funds were available. The project was completed in 2000 and came in under budget at $4.6 million. St. George's YouthNet St. George's YouthNet is an inner-city youth mentoring and life-skills education organization under the auspices of St. George's and based on its premises. The services offered by St. George's YouthNet include both lunch and after-school programs. The organization also sponsors a series of camps in the summer from toddlers to teens. Some of Youthnet's successful initiatives have been the Moving Images Project, the Teen Program that runs with the support of the Rotary Club and the IWK, called \\"Healthy Teens Building Vibrant Communities\\", and an art program led by the North End artist, Emma Fitzgerald.

Though the municipality of Ribadesella was initially proposed, Colunga was chosen for the building site in the late 1990s. Several landmarks are visible from the museum including the Bay of Biscay, the Sierra del Sueve, and the Picos de Europa. Strategically located over a mount on the Rasa de San Temo, the museum is in the midst the Jurassic Asturias. The museum displays and collections cover 3,500 million years, and although they emphasize the three stages of the Mesozoic (Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous), information is also presented on the preceding and subsequent periods. Different stages of the Jurassic geologic period and system are on display. Corridors contain over 20 dinosaur replicas; measuring over in height, their weight would exceed ten tons if the replicas were real. A rich collection of footprints and fossils found in the Asturian Jurassic coastline from ten paleontological sites are exhibited in the exposition halls and are said to be \\"the most complete informative and representative collection of dinosaur remains in the world.\\" Founded March 31, 2004 and representing an investment of 12 million euros, MUJA belongs to the Asturian network of public museums. The museum's goal is to illustrate the factors involved in the composition of life on Earth. The palaeontologist Jos√© Carlos Garc√≠a-Ramos from the University of Oviedo leads the museum's scientific team. Geography Exhibits of dinosaurs outside the museum. The museum is located close to the coastline of the Cantabrian Sea and Llastres, a fishing port. It is bounded by the Sierra del Sueve on the south and the Picos de Europa towards the east. MUJA is on the branch road AS-257 towards Llastres, about 1.5 km away. During a visit to the cliffs of the coastline between Gij√≥n and Ribadesella in the councils of Villaviciosa, Colunga and Ribadesella of Asturias, which is called the ‚ÄúCoast of Dinosaurs‚Äù, dinosaur ichnite deposits were found to be in abundance. Jurassic reptile footprints and bone were unearthed during excavations that started in 2005. Fossils found during these excavations are on display in the museum. Architecture Interior of the museum The museum, which opened in 2004, was designed by the architect, Rufino Uribelarrea. The building has many special features, particularly the roof, which is in the form of a \\"fingerprint counter mould kittiwake, feature of the dinosaurs\\". The building itself is shaped in the form of a giant tridactyl dinosaur footprint. Three ellipsoidal vaults intersect to form the deck space which is a large, open area of . The roof structure is made entirely of laminated wood, a plywood. The entire roof is covered with a copper skin plate, which has been described by the European Association for the Development of Architectural Copper as that \\"it gradually oxidises to dark brown colour, and then, after several years, the typical green patina of aged copper protects the building and its contents for decades, even in the aggressive marine environment.\\" The first floor, ground floor and basement of the building are . Three wide vaults or rooms extend to the ceiling and are divided by the Mesozoic divisions of Cretaceous, Jurassic, and Triassic. The basement houses over 400 tons of fossils that have yet to be classified. The first floor has a temporary exhibition room, a reception room, administration room, and workshops, as well as a library and a laboratory. The ground floor contains a display hall, an audio-visual room and the permanent exposition room, along with an auditorium. The service areas include a store, gardens, cafeteria, and playgrounds. Collection Skeleton casts of Tyrannosaurus mounted in a mating position at the Jurassic Museum of Asturias MUJA's main collection centres around 8,000 fossils from Asturias' Jurassic period. Divided into four sections, one contains 150 traces from the coast; another has 200 fossils of dinosaurs, crocodiles, fish, and tortoises; the third has 103 vegetable fossils and eleven tree trunk fragments; and the last has approximately 6,000 invertebrate fossils. A module explains the geological history of Asturias, focusing on the Jurassic Coast and the marine levels that formed the city of Gij√≥n. Some of the replicas include a couple of copulating Tyrannosaurus rex, as well as an Argentine Giganotosaurus, one of the largest known carnivorous dinosaurs. A large-clawed Deinonychus is also featured. Quintueles, Oles, and Tazones specimens are housed at the MUJA.Lockley, M.; Harris, J.D.; and Mitchell, L. 2008. \\"A global overview of pterosaur ichnology: tracksite distribution in space and time.\\" Zitteliana. B28. pp. 187‚Äì198. . The largest of the finds from the Coast of Dinosaurs are: the footprint of a theropod dinosaur of length, the smallest ichnites of sauropod dinosaurs of about length. Collections in the museum from the coastal finds also include 255 specimens of dinosaur ichnites. Martin Lockley, Palaeontologist of the University of Colorado Denver states that ‚Äúthe collection of ichnites of the MUJA represents one of the most complete worldwide‚Äù. A sauropod in MUJA The collection of vertebrates of the Jurassic period is unique. Some of the specimens on display in the museum are an incomplete skeleton of a marine crocodile, a piece of the jaw of a small ichthyosaur, a long specimen of ulna (equivalent to the cubitus bone) of a brachiosaurid, the partial skeleton of a stegosaur, several bones of plesiosaurs, bone remnants of sea turtles (including several shells), and also specimens of several partial fish. Also on display are Jurassic period fossil plants. ;Triassic hall Feathered reconstruction of Velociraptor In the Triassic hall, there are exhibits of dinosaurs as they first appeared in the Triassic period, 251 to 200 million years ago. The recreated and easily identifiable dinosaurs on display here have bones and footprints or ichnites. Also shown are the gastroliths (stones gulped down by some dinosaurs to crush food in their stomachs), coprolites (fossilized dung), eggs and nests. The Plateosaurus dinosaur is the largest on display here. ;Jurassic hall The Jurassic period, representing the intermediate period of the Mesozoic from 200 and 145 million years ago, considered the grandeur period of the dinosaurs, is represented in the Jurassic hall, which has large sauropods. The display has a unique representation through a cladogram which defines the features of the major groups of the period. Information on display relates to the anatomical features such as weight, neck bonding, arm musculature, circulatory system and the relative size of the skull. ;Theropods and others The theropod‚Äôs aggressive aspects are shown in the form of their teeth and claws. Ornithopods, which are vegetarian by habit are shown with snouts, tooth batteries, mobile skull bones jowls and with hoped feet. Thyreophorans exhibits depict their defensive anatomical features against predators in the form of bone shields, spikes, tail clubs and so forth. Camarasaurus, a large- sized sauropod dinosaur, found in central and western United States are exhibited in their original curved form. The exposition part dedicated to ornithopods is centred on the morphological characteristics most related to their vegetarian diet namely toothless snout, tooth batteries, mobile skull bones, and development of jowls and presence of hoofs on their feet. The space dedicated to thyreophorans shows the main defensive elements of this group of dinosaurs against predators such as bone shields, spikes, tail clubs and so forth. Marine Jurassic vertebrates are exhibited in the central hall alongside large reptiles such as ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs, crocodiles and fish. The skeletons of an ichthyosaur, a fish-shaped reptile akin to a dolphin, and of a sea lily or crinoid are also on display in separate cabinets. ;Pre-Mesozoic In the Pre-Mesozoic hall, the exhibits relate to the time from the creation of the Earth 4500 million years ago to the Palaeozoic age, 251 million years ago with displays of first organisms on the Earth, evolution process of fossils and their dating, classification of the vertebrates and their inherited relations, deterioration and extinction of nearly 95% of these systems by end of the Palaeozoic period. ;Cretaceous period In the hall representing the Cretaceous period, which is the last period of the Mesozoic era from 145 to 66 million years ago, the displays relate to the biological and social habits of dinosaurs, reasons for their extinction by the end of the Cretaceous period, that are attributed to meteorite, volcanic eruptions and intense geographic and climatic changes. Evolution of birds inferred as theropods evolving from the non-avian dinosaurs are represented by the Archaeopteryx (a prehistoric bird) and dinosaurs such as the Deinonychus or the Dromaeosaurus. ;Post- Mesozoic period Post-Mesozoic, representing the last 66 million years, starting with the extinction of a major part of the dinosaurs, is the Tertiary period when reptile, mammals and modern faunas evolved in that order. The Cantabrotherium truyolsi represents the deposit of Llamaquique, in Oviedo. A touch screen display provides a complete history of the last 66 million years of the evolution of the landscape and the ecosystems. The replica of a skull, No. 5, dated to 300,000 years, is an exhibit in the hall of the Quaternary period. Displays in this hall also cover the decline of the brown bear habitat in the north of the Iberian Peninsula over 500 years and the skull of a cave bear. ;Temporary exhibitions In the basement of the museum, there is a hall where temporary exhibitions are held on different themes. Past shows were on the themes of Asturias, Natural Paradise, the Great Adventure of Dinosaurs, European Rupestrian art, the Coast of Dinosaurs, Trapped in Ice, Jurassic Colossus and 2010 Biodiversity. Publications Publications include a handheld guide, promotional brochure, guide activities and educational programs, educational and recreational, guide to the Dinosaur Coast and guide to \\"Discovering the MUJA children for children\\".

The game is the sequel to The Darkness (2007) and based on the comic book series published by Top Cow Productions. The player controls Jackie Estacado, a mafia hitman who possesses a mysterious power called \\"the Darkness\\" that grants him supernatural abilities and a pair of Demon Arms. The game features elements found in role-playing video games such as skill trees, experience, and a four-player cooperative mode. The player must rescue the soul of Jackie's dead girlfriend, which was trapped by the Darkness in Hell, and confront the Brotherhood, a group of armed cultists trying to take the Darkness away from Jackie. Digital Extremes replaced the first game's developer Starbreeze Studios, though Paul Jenkins returned to write the script for the sequel. While the main narrative was envisioned to be a personal journey for Jackie, developers described the cooperative multiplayer mode as a \\"dark comedy\\". Singer Mike Patton returned to voice the Darkness, and Brian Bloom provided the voice for Jackie Estacado, replacing Kirk Acevedo. The development artists hand-painted the majority of the game's assets to create a comic book-influenced visual style. Announced in May 2011, the game was released for Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 in February 2012. The game received positive reviews upon release, with critics praising the gameplay, story, pacing, and art style. Criticisms were directed at the game's short length, technical issues, and lack of replay value. The game debuted as the third best-selling game in its first week of release in the United Kingdom. Gameplay Players can dual wield weapons and control a pair of Demon Arms. The left arm is used to grab objects while the right arm is used to slash enemies. Jackie can use various firearms, such as submachine guns, shotguns, and assault rifles, and has the ability to dual wield some of these weapons. Additionally, he is armed with a pair of Demon Arms, which resemble tentacles and can be used to slash enemies or pick up various items within the environment (parking meters, car doors, etc.) to use as projectile weapons or shields. The Demon Arms can rip out the heart of fallen enemies and devour them for health, pick up enemies for execution, or throw them. The player is guided by a Darkling, a goblin-like creature that assists in combat and gathers weapons and ammo. At several points, the player can directly control the Darkling, allowing them to squeeze into tight spaces that Jackie cannot enter and execute enemies from behind. When exposed to light, Jackie's health regeneration and Darkness abilities are disabled. In addition, his vision will become blurred and he will experience a ringing sound when exposed. The player can disable these sources by shooting them, causing them to malfunction. The game features elements found in role-playing video games. Killing enemies, devouring hearts and performing executions earn the player Essence, which can be used to purchase upgrades at various talent shrines. Collecting relics, which serve as collectibles, earns a small amount of Essence. The skill tree is divided into four main aspects: Hitman, Execution, Darkness Powers, and Demon Arm. The Hitman aspect consists of passive upgrades that improve the weapon's reload time and magazine size. The Execution tree allows each execution to net more benefits, such as gaining a massive amount of health, ammo or a shield. Darkness Powers and the Demon Arms grant players access to active abilities, some of which have a brief cooldown after use. These abilities include Gun Channeling, an ability that gives the player unlimited ammo and enhanced damage for a short time; Swarm, which distracts enemies; and Black Hole, which triggers a large area of effect attack that sucks enemies into a vortex. The game features a cooperative multiplayer campaign called \\"Vendettas\\" that runs parallel to the main campaign and allows up to four players to play together. The story involves four hitmen working for Jackie as they attempt to stop the Brotherhood from obtaining the Spear of Destiny. Each character has different Darkness powers and is armed with a unique special weapon. For instance, Inugami is a character who uses a Darkness-infused samurai sword, while Shoshanna uses a blunderbuss which can shoot without bullets. Although the mode can be played solo, the experience is significantly more difficult. There is an arcade mode called \\"Hit List\\" that allows players to replay certain Vendetta missions and complete challenges. Plot The game begins two years after the events of the first game, with the player controlling Jackie Estacado (Brian Bloom), who has become head of the Franchetti family and has learned to suppress the Darkness (Mike Patton), an ancient demonic force which has inhabited Jackie's bloodline for generations. Jackie is haunted by the memory of his murdered girlfriend, Jenny Romano (Stephanie Frame), and sees apparitions of her. While relaxing at a restaurant, Jackie and his crew are attacked by a rival gang. Grievously wounded, Jackie is forced to let the Darkness out once more, restoring his powers. Aided by the Darkling (Peter Newman)‚Äîa goblin-like familiar of the Darkness‚ÄîJackie pursues his attackers into the subway. Jackie is mesmerized by a vision of Jenny on the tracks, only to be apparently hit by a train. He wakes up in what appears to be an asylum occupied by his crew. Reawakening back into the living world, Jackie regroups with his men at his penthouse to plan a counterattack. One of Jackie's closest associates, Jimmy the Grape (Frank Ashmore), provides a lead that points to Swifty, a smaller crime boss. After subduing Swifty, he explains that a shady group he met at the Brimstone Club brothel paid him to put the hit on Jackie. Before he can reveal anything else, the Darkness brutally murders him. Vinnie (Rick Pasqualone)‚Äîone of Jackie's men‚Äîenlists his contact at Brimstone to help them. At the club, Jackie encounters armed cultists of the Brotherhood, a secret society who ordered the hit and wish to use the Darkness for themselves. They ambush Jackie with blinding lights that inhibit the Darkness‚Äô powers, and Jackie is knocked out. Waking up, he finds himself crucified and a device (the Siphon) draining his dark power. He is greeted by Victor (William Salyers) who offers to take the Darkness from him in exchange for the lives of his family. Refusing, he loses consciousness momentarily and finds himself in Hell where the Darkness keeps Jenny's soul. After Jackie breaks free, Victor threatens to murder Jackie's Aunt, Sarah (Bridger Fox). As the club burns, the Darkness offers Jenny's soul in exchange for the Siphon. Jackie regroups with his men to retake the penthouse, but Jackie is shot and incapacitated by Bragg, a top Brotherhood enforcer, who murders Sarah. After being shot, Jackie awakens in a psychiatric ward where Jenny and members of his crew appear as staff and patients. They tell him that his mob stories are delusions. At Sarah's funeral, the Brotherhood launches another attack. Jackie subdues Bragg, who reveals that Victor is operating out of an abandoned theme park. Jackie is soon captured by Victor in an iron maiden and loses consciousness from blood loss. Again, he wakes in the ward, but the janitor, revealed to be his Darkling, explains that the asylum is a trap for Jackie to keep him alive and away from Jenny. Jackie awakens to find that Victor has successfully drained the Darkness from him. The Darkling helps Jackie escape and retake a small portion of the Darkness. Jackie pursues Victor through a mansion once owned by Carlo Estacado, Jackie's father. Jackie learns from Victor that Carlo had promised the Darkness to the Brotherhood to ensure Jackie didn't have to suffer as he did. Reaching the attic, Jackie kills Victor and impales himself with the Siphon, regaining the Darkness and killing himself to rescue Jenny from Hell. Jackie once again wakes up in the psychiatric ward where the staff offer to take him to Jenny. The Darkling appears and sacrifices himself to help Jackie escape. Jackie reaches the roof and is confronted by Victor (appearing as a doctor), Jenny, and an orderly who attempt to convince Jackie that his life as a mob boss is a delusion and that the world in the psychiatric ward is real. On the roof of the asylum, the player is given a choice to either have Jackie stay with Jenny in the ward, or reject the asylum and attempt to reach Hell. If the player chooses to stay, both Jenny and Jackie will head back into the asylum and slow dance to \\"I Only Have Eyes for You\\", and the game ends. If the player chooses to reject the asylum, Jackie will jump from the roof and fall into Hell. The Darkness, in a fit of rage, sends demons to stop Jackie from reaching Jenny, but Jackie manages to release Jenny from her bindings and the couple embrace. In a post-credits scene, Jenny is revealed to have become the new host for the Angelus, who has seen the destruction Jackie and the Darkness have caused, and states Jackie has become too powerful and leaves them trapped in Hell; leaving an enraged Jackie screaming as the screen fades out. Development Paul Jenkins returned to write the game. Publisher 2K Games approached Canadian developer Digital Extremes to develop The Darkness II, replacing Starbreeze Studios which worked on the first game. The team worked on the title for three years. The team spent a lot of time creating the game's narrative, with Paul Jenkins returning as the title's writer. According to Starbreeze's CEO Mikael Nermark, the company was not given the option of working on the sequel and was already busy working on Syndicate when The Darkness II was announced. According to Carter, Digital Extremes agreed to assume development responsibilities as the team wanted to create a shooter with a large emphasis on the story. Both Jenkins and the team at Digital Extremes worked closely, with the team making adjustments to Jenkins' script to suit the gameplay. Carter called the narrative a \\"love story\\", which he felt \\"[balanced] the adrenaline of the action\\", while the first part of the game's three-act plot was about \\"survival\\" since Jackie was attacked by an opposing mob. The team spent a lot of time working on the tone of Jackie. Carter compared Jackie to Tony Soprano, a \\"badass\\" character who has to face a lot of internal struggles. The team hoped that the story could make the players sympathize with Jackie. According to designer Tom Galt, while Jackie was a mob boss on the surface, \\"in his heart he is human and a good-natured guy\\". With the game's large focus on narrative, the Darkling was given a personality and played a huge role in the story. The game does not cut to third-person so that a limited extent of control can be granted to players even in cinematics. While the game has a heavy narrative focus, all cutscenes and cinematics can be skipped for players who only want to enjoy the gameplay. One of the biggest requests from players of the first game was to have Mike Patton return to voice the Darkness. Nolan North served as a stand-in voice actor for Jackie during the game's pre- production, before Brian Bloom was chosen to voice the character. The Darkness comic was a large inspiration for the team. The team read the comic and decided to adopt a comic book-influenced \\"graphic noir\\" art style, as they believed the comic's use of high contrast colors contributed to its success. The team used some of the assets made by Starbreeze as a reference, and created new ones using their own internal proprietary game engine named the Evolution Engine, which powered the studio's previous game Dark Sector (2008). The development artists hand-painted the majority of the game's assets, though this idea was initially met with resistance within the art team due to the huge amount of workload such an approach would create. The team decided to make the title more action-orientated in an attempt to differentiate itself from its predecessor. The shooting mechanic was refined, and the concept of \\"quad-wielding\\", which allows players to engage in combat using both the Demon Arms and duel-wielding weapons, was introduced. Carter explained that they saw the Demon Arms as an opportunity to make the combat more \\"up close and personal\\". The team changed the game's abilities to supplement this, such as turning the ability of Black Hole into a random drop from enemies. The quad- wielding mechanic enabled the combat to have more variety, allowing players to approach the same scenario with different combat styles and encourages players to experiment with different tactics. The gameplay was designed to be violent, with some execution animations being removed for being not \\"extravagant\\" enough. To ensure the game was not too easy, the team disabled Jackie's powers when he is exposed to light and created various enemy types to challenge the player in different ways. The game's cooperative mode Vendetta features a story that runs parallel to the game's main narrative. The team envisioned Vendetta as a dark comedy with over-the-top characters. It is tonally very different from the main game, and the team hoped that players would use the Vendetta mode to \\"blow off some steam\\" after experiencing Jackie's story in the main narrative. The team used the mode to explore other characters and elements in the universe, and Jenkins has written more than 10 pages of backstory for each of the four playable characters. 2K unveiled the game in May 2011. The game was initially set to be released in October the same year, though 2K announced in July 2011 that the game would be delayed until February 2012. Players who pre-ordered the game would be upgraded to the Limited Edition; which includes gameplay bonuses, illustration drawn by Marc Silvestri, and digital download for The Darkness Origins Volume 1 and Volume 2. 2K provided extensive marketing for the game, launching a four-week promotion program on Kerrang Radio, partnering with Forbidden Planet for window displays and in-store promotions, and placing TV advertisements on both SyFy and Horror Channel. A demo for the game was released in January 2012 on Steam, Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network. Reception The game received generally positive reviews from critics upon release, according to review aggregator Metacritic. It was the third best-selling retail game in its week of release in the UK, surpassed by Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning and Final Fantasy XIII-2. The story received critical acclaim from players. Mikel Reparaz from GamesRadar described the narrative as \\"part mob drama, part surreal comedy, and part supernatural revenge romance\\", though he disliked the cliffhanger ending. While the game focuses on the relationship between Jackie and Jenny, Reparaz noted that the supporting characters were \\"endearing\\", and remarked that they were well-written and well-acted. He stated he liked the combinations of gun-play and Demon Arms gameplay, which he felt turned Jackie into \\"an unstoppable dynamo of horror\\". He also enjoyed the execution animations, which he felt were \\"brutal\\" and \\"never quite get old\\", though he felt that the gun-play became repetitive by the end of the game. Anthony Gallegos from IGN felt that the story was not as immediately interesting as the first game and noted that it reused some of its predecessors' plot devices. However, he remarked that some of the scenes with Jenny were \\"touching\\", which made the story more \\"personal\\" for the player. He further commented that the game's story focus enabled the title to have better pacing. Rich McCormick from PC Gamer praised the story for being \\"involving\\", and that the title \\"plays with concepts of unreliable narration in a way that only games allow\\". Conrad Zimmerman from Destructoid felt the narrative was fairly average, but the game's storytelling was \\"handled remarkably well\\". Andrew Reiner from Game Informer remarked that unlike the original game, the title is more of a fast-paced shooter than a supernatural thriller, and he felt that the story and the characters were inferior when compared to the first game. Kevin VanOrd from GameSpot praised the character development and the game's pacing. He described the story as \\"unusual\\" and \\"creepy\\", and added that the game's narrative excels when it \\"plays with your expectations and has you wondering\\". The gameplay received a positive response from critics. Daniel Bischoff from Game Revolution called the gun-play \\"responsive\\" and the Demon Arms \\"fun to control\\". He particularly liked the combat variety and enemy types, which put the players in various combat scenarios. However, he was disappointed by the game's length, which lasted for only seven hours. Zimmerman agreed that the game was short, but said the title was fun throughout. Dan Whitehead from Eurogamer also praised the Demon Arms and added that it helped \\"opening up combat possibilities that other shooters can't hope to compete with\\". He further praised the developer for making the combat faster and refining the gameplay of the original. Gallegos praised the combat for being \\"vastly superior\\" to the first game and said that Jackie's overpowered nature made the game more exciting as players could focus on fun ways to kill enemies. He also liked the skill trees, which he felt have reinvigorated the combat during the later sections of the game. McCormick noted that the game's control was not too overwhelming for players despite needing to control multiple limbs at once. However, he was disappointed by the final levels, which he felt was a \\"slog\\" to play through. Reiner praised the game for making players feel powerful, but he felt that the game was repetitive due to the lack of combat variety and remarked that combat \\"relies on reflexes more than strategy\\". Most reviewers thought that the cooperative multiplayer mode was fun and that it provided extra gameplay for an otherwise short title, though both Ben Gilbert from Joystiq and Zimmerman thought the combat not as exciting as the main game since the playable characters in the Vendetta mode do not have Demon Arms. Whitehead noted that the mode was \\"basic to the point of being crude\\", though he felt the secondary story was \\"enjoyable\\". The game's presentation received mixed reviews. Gilbert praised the art direction, calling it \\"gorgeous\\" and \\"impressive\\". Zimmerman liked the cel-shaded graphics, which he felt was \\"evocative of the comic books from which these games originate\\" and made the game \\"surprisingly easy to get sucked in\\". Reiner, however, felt that the new art style did not capture the eerie feeling of the original game. Gallegos noted that the reviewed copy suffered from software bugs, broken animations, glitches, and frame rate issues and felt that the game was marred by polish issues.

It was introduced in 1987 by Roger N. Shepard, who began researching mechanisms of generalization while he was still a graduate student at Yale: > \\"I was now convinced that the problem of generalization was the most > fundamental problem confronting learning theory. Because we never encounter > exactly the same total situation twice, no theory of learning can be > complete without a law governing how what is learned in one situation > generalizes to another\\" Shepard‚Äôs 1987 paper gives a \\"generalization\\" example of a bird that has eaten one earthworm, and is presented with a slightly different-looking earthworm. Explaining the concept of \\"psychological space\\" in the abstract of his 1987 paper, Shepard wrote: > \\"A psychological space is established for any set of stimuli by determining > metric distances between the stimuli such that the probability that a > response learned to any stimulus will generalize to any other is an > invariant [monotonic function] of the distance between them\\" Using experimental evidence from both human and non-human subjects, Shepard hypothesized, more specifically, that the probability of generalization will fall off exponentially with the distance measured by one of two particular metrics. His analysis goes on to argue for the universality of this rule for all sentient organisms, due to evolutionary internalization.  Additional Research and Commentary  In 1988, Shepard received a response to his research from Daniel M. Ennis from the Philip Morris Research Center. Ennis called into question whether Shepard‚Äôs theory was relevant as it echoed research already accomplished by Nosofsky, whose research presented ‚Äúseveral exceptions‚Äù to Shepard‚Äôs theory. Shepard responded to him by asserting that Nosofsky‚Äôs experiments focused on ‚Äú the precise locations of individual stimuli in ‚Äòpsychological space‚Äô‚Äù whereas his experiments focused on the ‚Äúlocation, size, and shape of the region of psychological space corresponding to the set of stimuli having the same important consequence as a given training stimulus‚Äù. Other researchers have followed up Shepard‚Äôs research with their own looks into the law of generalization. In 2000, Ken Cheng from Macquarie University experimented on the special generalization of honeybees, comparing his findings with earlier research on humans and pigeons. Cheng explained his understanding of Shepard‚Äôs law of generalization in this study as such: > ‚ÄúSuppose that an animal finds food in a container at one location (S+). When > the animal returns, the container is at a noticeably different location. > Will the animal still ‚Äòbet‚Äô on finding food in the container? Underlying > this question is the assumption that the animal can discriminate the two > locations. Shepard‚Äôs law does not apply when the animal has trouble > discriminating between stimuli. The question is whether the two locations > have the same consequence of concern‚Äîin this case, whether the container > contains food‚Ä¶‚Äù Cheng measured the bee‚Äôs response to copies of a container in different locations, the original staying in one area and holding sugar water. The copy containers would then either have plain tap water or sugar water. Measurements of generalization gradients were separated by both distance and direction according to Shepard‚Äôs law. Cheng found that ‚Äúgeneralization gradients in both series were fitted by exponential functions, supporting Shepard‚Äôs law‚Äù. Cheng‚Äôs research suggested that Shepard‚Äôs law had the potential to be generalized to more than only mammals and birds but to invertebrates as well. In 2001, Chater and Vit√°nyi attempted to provide a ‚Äúmathematically more appealing form of the Universal Law‚Äù. They explain the necessity of a different mathematical outlook than the one presented in Shepard‚Äôs paper by illustrating the example of a photograph and its negative: > ‚ÄúThus, while the positive and negative of the same picture are far away from > each other in terms of Euclidean distance, they are at almost zero distance > in terms of universal distance because interchanging the black and white > pixels transforms one picture into the other‚Äù Chater and Vit√°nyi admit that their way of approaching the law of generalization might be too abstract to fit a psychological equation, but argue that a simple abstract explanation would be as suitable as any other elementary explanation in a practical sense when faced with situations that are webbed with complex mathematical explanations. Steven A. Frank of the University of California proposed another outlook on the approach of the law of generalization. He suggested that any established current mathematical scales used to measure generalization were unnecessarily detailed and that trying to keep generalization in a scale of constant values was not needed. Frank concluded that the exponential form of generalization could be accurately captured with shift invariance. Chris R. Sims has attempted to offer another look at the law of generalization through the scope of the principle of efficient coding. Sims makes the case for rate-distortion theory through perceptual identification experiments.

Each season is conceived as a self-contained miniseries, following a different set of characters and settings, and a storyline with its own \\"beginning, middle, and end.\\" Some plot elements of each season are loosely inspired by true events. Many actors appear in more than one season, but often play a new character. Evan Peters, Sarah Paulson, and Lily Rabe have returned most frequently, all appearing in nine of the ten seasons with Frances Conroy appearing in seven and Kathy Bates appearing in six. Other notable actors such as Denis O'Hare, Jessica Lange, Emma Roberts, Jamie Brewer, Angela Bassett, Adina Porter, and Finn Wittrock appear in five of the ten seasons. The first season, retroactively subtitled Murder House, takes place in Los Angeles, California, during 2011, and centers on a family that moves into a house haunted by its deceased former occupants. The second season, subtitled Asylum, takes place in Massachusetts, during 1964, and follows the stories of the patients and staff of an institution for the criminally insane. The third season, subtitled Coven, takes place in New Orleans, Louisiana, during 2013, and follows a coven of witches who face off against those who wish to destroy them. The fourth season, subtitled Freak Show, takes place in Jupiter, Florida, during 1952, and centers around one of the last remaining American freak shows and their struggle for survival. The fifth season, subtitled Hotel, takes place in Los Angeles, California, during 2015, and focuses on the staff and guests of a supernatural hotel. The sixth season, subtitled Roanoke, takes place in North Carolina, during 2014‚Äì2016, and focuses on the paranormal events that take place at an isolated farmhouse haunted by the deceased Roanoke colony. The seventh season, subtitled Cult, takes place in the fictional suburb of Brookfield Heights, Michigan, during 2016‚Äì2017, and centers on a cult terrorizing the residents in the aftermath of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The eighth season, subtitled Apocalypse, features the return of the witches from Coven as they battle the Antichrist from Murder House in an attempt to prevent the apocalypse. The ninth season, subtitled 1984, takes place outside of Los Angeles, California, during the titular year, 1984, and focuses on a group of young staff members at a summer camp getting ready to reopen after a massacre. In August 2018, the series was greenlit for a tenth season. In January 2020, FX renewed the series for three more seasons. Although reception to individual seasons has varied, American Horror Story largely has been well received by television critics, with the majority of the praise going towards the cast, particularly Jessica Lange, who won two Emmy Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and a Screen Actors Guild Award for her performances. Kathy Bates and James Cromwell each won an Emmy Award for their performances, while Lady Gaga won a Golden Globe Award. The series draws consistently high ratings for the FX network, with its first season being the most-viewed new cable series of 2011. Seasons =Murder House (2011)= Set in 2011, the season follows the Harmons, consisting of wife and mother Vivien (Connie Britton), her psychiatrist husband Ben (Dylan McDermott), and their teenage daughter Violet (Taissa Farmiga), as they move from Boston to Los Angeles to make a fresh start after Vivien has a miscarriage. Soon after the miscarriage and before the move, Ben has an affair with one of his students, which almost tears the family apart. They move into a restored mansion and soon encounter the residence's housekeeper, Moira O'Hara (Frances Conroy and Alexandra Breckenridge), as well as their neighbors ‚Äì the eccentric Langdon family consisting of Constance (Jessica Lange) and her daughter Adelaide (Jamie Brewer). The Harmons' lives are troubled by the meddling Langdons, the incompetent realtor Marcy (Christine Estabrook), as well as the disfigured Larry Harvey (Denis O'Hare), a former resident of the mansion who is secretly in love with Constance, and the scorned Hayden McClaine (Kate Mara), Ben's former student who follows him to Los Angeles. Ben and Vivien try to rekindle their relationship while Violet, suffering from depression, finds comfort in Tate (Evan Peters), one of Ben's patients. The family soon discovers that the home is haunted by the ghosts of anyone who has ever died on the property, including its creators Charles (Matt Ross) and Nora Montgomery (Lily Rabe); and their deformed son Thaddeus (Ben Woolf) who is sometimes referred to as the 'Infantata'. Flashbacks depict the mansion's previous homeowners throughout the last century, dating back to its construction in the 1920s. =Asylum (2012‚Äì13)= Set in 1964, the season follows the patients and staff members of the church-owned Briarcliff Manor, located in Massachusetts, which was founded to treat and house the criminally insane. Kit Walker (Evan Peters), accused of being a prolific serial killer named \\"Bloody Face\\" after the disappearance of his wife Alma (Britne Oldford)‚Äîthough he claims she was abducted by aliens‚Äîis incarcerated at Briarcliff. This piques the interest of ambitious lesbian journalist Lana Winters (Sarah Paulson), who is yearning to find a story for her big break. At Briarcliff, Kit meets the other patients, many of whom claim to be unjustly institutionalized, including microcephalic Pepper (Naomi Grossman), nymphomaniac Shelley (Chloe Sevigny), whose cheating husband hypocritically committed her after finding her in bed with two guys; and the unassuming Grace Bertrand (Lizzie Brocher√©) from France. Believed to be a violent serial killer, Kit becomes the subject of interest of pragmatic psychiatrist Oliver Thredson (Zachary Quinto) and the sadistic Dr. Arthur Arden (James Cromwell), the latter of whom routinely conducts scientific operations on patients. The institution is run under the watchful eye of the stern Sister Jude (Jessica Lange), as well as her second-in-command, the na√Øve Sister Mary Eunice (Lily Rabe), and the founder of the institution, Monsignor Timothy Howard (Joseph Fiennes). Briarcliff's inhabitants are routinely subject to supernatural and scientific influences, including demonic possession and extraterrestrial abduction. =Coven (2013‚Äì14)= Set in 2013, the season follows the dwindling descendants of the witches who survived the Salem Witch Trials and their struggle to hide their identity in the modern world. Those who share this genetic affliction are being subjected to violent attacks from outside forces, such as voodoo practitioners. Zoe Benson (Taissa Farmiga), a young teenager completely unaware of the existence of witches, discovers her identity as a Salem descendant after a violent accident that causes the death of her boyfriend. She is sent to an all-girls boarding school in New Orleans which aims to protect and house young women who carry this unique bloodline, and keep them from the dangers of the outside world. There, she meets the other students, narcissistic movie star Madison Montgomery (Emma Roberts), outspoken human voodoo doll Queenie (Gabourey Sidibe), and enigmatic mind- reading Nan (Jamie Brewer), and gets romantically entangled with Kyle Spencer (Evan Peters), a non-witch and good-natured college student. The school is run by headmistress Cordelia Foxx (Sarah Paulson), head of the Witches Council, eccentric fashionista Myrtle Snow (Frances Conroy), and the mute butler Spalding (Denis O'Hare). Cordelia's mother, Fiona Goode (Jessica Lange), is the Supreme and most powerful witch of her generation, though she regularly avoids her responsibilities, much to the chagrin of Cordelia and her long-time rival Myrtle. After a mob of townspeople discover and burn a young witch living in the swamps named Misty Day (Lily Rabe), Fiona returns to the school to ensure the safety of the other young witches, but also to fulfill her own hidden agenda. Events reveal a long-held rivalry between the witches of Salem and the voodoo practitioners of New Orleans, as well as a historic grudge between Voodoo Queen Marie Laveau (Angela Bassett) and socialite serial killer Delphine LaLaurie (Kathy Bates), who tortured and murdered her slaves in the 1830s. In addition to this, the coven is also being targeted by an organization of witch hunters. =Freak Show (2014‚Äì15)= Set in 1952, the season follows a struggling freak show led by Elsa Mars (Jessica Lange) in the sleepy town of Jupiter, Florida. Decades have passed since the public has looked upon freak shows as a form of entertainment, but Elsa dreams of finding a home for her \\"monsters,\\" as well as for her own fame and fortune. Other members of her troupe include \\"Lobster Boy\\" Jimmy Darling (Evan Peters), who dreams of living a normal life, and his mother Ethel (Kathy Bates), a bearded lady who acts as Elsa's second-in-command by maintaining law and order under the tent. A strongman from Ethel's past and Jimmy's biological father Dell Toledo (Michael Chiklis), and his three-breasted wife Desiree Dupree (Angela Bassett), arrive to join the freak show. To drum up business and save her troupe once and for all, Elsa also recruits conjoined twin sisters Bette and Dot Tattler (Sarah Paulson) to perform for her show. In a time when the era of television is beginning to reign high above sideshow acts, these individuals must overcome those who persecute them based on their looks. However, as the season unfolds, it is revealed that multiple dark entities have taken up residence in Jupiter, with all of their eyes being set on the freaks. A conman named Stanley (Denis O'Hare), posing as a Hollywood executive, arrives with his young prot√©g√© Maggie Esmerelda (Emma Roberts), who becomes involved with Jimmy. The wealthy and spoiled Dandy Mott (Finn Wittrock), enabled by his doting mother Gloria (Frances Conroy), develops an unhealthy obsession with the freaks, particularly Bette and Dot. Perhaps the most dangerous of them all is a mysterious, deformed killer clown, known only as Twisty (John Carroll Lynch), who wreaks havoc on Jupiter and appears to be targeting freaks and townspeople alike. =Hotel (2015‚Äì16)= Set in 2015, the season follows the strange and dangerous happenings that seem to center around the retro Hotel Cortez in downtown Los Angeles, California, initially built as a secret torture chamber to fulfill the violent desires of founder James Patrick March (Evan Peters). Detective John Lowe (Wes Bentley) arrives at the hotel, based on intel from an anonymous tip, to investigate a grisly string of murders, each of which exemplify a sin in violation of one of the Ten Commandments. He has become estranged from his wife Alex (Chloe Sevigny), who suffers from depression, and his daughter Scarlett (Shree Crooks), after the disappearance of their son Holden (Lennon Henry) five years earlier. The hotel is led by March's fashionista widow Elizabeth Johnson (Lady Gaga), also known as the Countess‚Äîwho was mutated into a vampiress by her former lovers, actor Rudolph Valentino (Finn Wittrock) and his wife Natacha Rambova (Alexandra Daddario)‚Äîand her current lover Donovan (Matt Bomer). Throughout his investigation, John also becomes entangled with the spirits of a heroin junkie named Sally (Sarah Paulson), hotel maid Hazel Evers (Mare Winningham), and James Patrick March, who is looking for a prot√©g√© to continue the violent acts he started when he was alive. The hotel's tireless staff includes the surly front desk manager Iris (Kathy Bates), Donovan's mother, and her best friend, the transgender bartender Liz Taylor (Denis O'Hare), both of whom hesitantly cater to Elizabeth and her vampiric children, one out of a desire to remain close to her son and the other out of a sense of loyalty. Elizabeth's relationship with Donovan becomes troubled with the arrival of male model and cocaine addict Tristan Duffy (Finn Wittrock), New York fashion designer Will Drake (Cheyenne Jackson), and her scorned ex-lover Ramona Royale (Angela Bassett), all of whom become entangled in her violent life. =Roanoke (2016)= Set in 2014‚Äì2016, the season follows the supernatural events that occur in a renovated farmhouse in North Carolina, which is situated on the land where the Roanoke Colony moved after their infamous 1580s disappearance. In 2015, Shelby Miller (Lily Rabe), her husband Matt (Andr√© Holland), along with Matt's sister Lee Harris (Adina Porter) recount their harrowing experience living in the farmhouse a year prior in a popular documentary series titled My Roanoke Nightmare, including their encounters with the violent and vengeful ghosts of the house's previous residents and the Roanoke Colony, the cannibalistic Polk family who live nearby, and the beautiful, yet terrifying Celtic witch, Sc√°thach (Lady Gaga). The documentary becomes a huge success, featuring dramatic reenactments of the Millers' story starring Audrey Tindall (Sarah Paulson) as Shelby, Dominic Banks (Cuba Gooding Jr.) as Matt, Monet Tumusiime (Angela Bassett) as Lee, Agnes Mary Winstead (Kathy Bates) as Thomasin White ‚Äì also known as The Butcher, leader of the ghost colony, Audrey's husband Rory Monahan (Evan Peters) as Edward Philipe Mott, the creator and first owner of the house, William van Henderson (Denis O'Hare) as Dr. Elias Cunningham, a professor who becomes entranced with the paranormal happenings of the area, and Dylan (Wes Bentley) as Ambrose White, Thomasin's son and accomplice. In 2016, the success of the documentary leads to a sequel titled Return to Roanoke: Three Days in Hell, spearheaded by the producer of the original series, Sidney Aaron James (Cheyenne Jackson), who invites the Millers, as well as many of the reenactment actors, to return to the farmhouse for three days during the blood moon, where all their actions will be captured by hidden cameras. Although the Millers are aware of the entities that reside in the house, all three agree to return, each with their own agenda. The production eventually descends into a chaotic, yet tragic disaster, however, as cast and crew alike are quickly targeted when the violent entities begin to surface. =Cult (2017)= Set in 2017, the fictional town of Brookfield Heights, Michigan, is left divided in the wake of Donald Trump's election as president. Local restaurant owner Ally Mayfair-Richards (Sarah Paulson) is left utterly distraught, along with her wife Ivy (Alison Pill). Despite the help of her psychiatrist, Dr. Rudy Vincent (Cheyenne Jackson), Ally becomes increasingly unstable in the following weeks, as her long-repressed phobias begin to re-emerge, and they begin to affect her relationships with her wife and their son, Oz (Cooper Dodson). Across town, misogynistic alt-righter Kai Anderson (Evan Peters) rejoices at the election results, enticing him to pursue political power by running for city council, led by radical feminist Bebe Babbitt (Frances Conroy) and with the help of his reluctant, liberal sister Winter (Billie Lourd), who the Mayfair-Richards household hire as their nanny. As Ally attempts to re-adjust to regular life despite her growing anxiety and paranoia, she becomes terrorized by a group of masked assailants, donned in clown attire, who are only present when she is alone, leaving those around her to wonder if she was truly attacked, or if they were merely hallucinations. Ally's new eccentric neighbors Harrison (Billy Eichner) and Meadow Wilton (Leslie Grossman) move in next door, while news reporter Beverly Hope (Adina Porter) descends upon every crime scene to report the murders. Also in the midst of the chaos is Jack Samuels (Colton Haynes), a detective who investigates the crimes and is initially doubtful about Ally's claims, and Gary K. Longstreet (Chaz Bono), a supermarket owner who has an amputated arm and is a passionate Trump supporter. With Kai's rise to power revealing sinister motives, Ally starts to draw connections between her alleged clown attackers and the many strange incidents occurring in Brookfield Heights. She begins to fear that everyone in town is out to get her, amplifying her growing distrust of those around her. =Apocalypse (2018)= Set in the near future, the Antichrist, Michael Langdon (Cody Fern) brings about the apocalypse by instigating nuclear warfare. The chosen survivors of the aftermath, heiress Coco St. Pierre Vanderbilt (Leslie Grossman), her personal assistant Mallory (Billie Lourd), hairstylist Mr. Gallant (Evan Peters), his grandmother Evie (Joan Collins), talk-show host Dinah Stevens (Adina Porter), Stevens‚Äô son Andre (Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman), young adults Timothy Campbell (Kyle Allen) and Emily (Ash Santos), among others, take refuge in a fallout shelter named \\"Outpost 3\\", run with an iron fist by Wilhemina Venable (Sarah Paulson) and Miriam Mead (Kathy Bates) along with The Fist (Erika Ervin), a brutish and tall female guard. Flashbacks to three years prior reveal that \\"Outpost 3\\" was an all-boys warlock school led by John Henry Moore (Cheyenne Jackson) that unknowingly harbored the Antichrist, in hopes that he would rise as the first ever male Supreme. The witches' council of Cordelia Goode (Paulson), Zoe Benson (Taissa Farmiga), and the resurrected Myrtle Snow (Frances Conroy) are summoned and quickly discover how dangerous Michael is to their coven when faced with his evident powers, as he resurrects deceased witches Queenie (Gabourey Sidibe), Madison Montgomery (Emma Roberts), and Misty Day (Lily Rabe). The coven, with the aid of the warlocks, attempt to save humanity by discovering new witch Mallory's intense powers, learning more about Michael's mysterious origins, in particular from Michael's grandmother Constance Langdon (Jessica Lange), and how to defeat him to prevent the apocalypse. =1984 (2019)= Set in the titular year, 1984, the season follows Brooke Thompson (Emma Roberts) as she travels to a remote, newly reopened summer camp, known as Camp Redwood, to work as a counselor following a terrifying encounter with serial killer Richard Ramirez (Zach Villa). Those traveling with Brooke include preppy Xavier Plympton (Cody Fern), athletic Chet Clancy (Gus Kenworthy), easy-going Ray Powell (DeRon Horton), and spunky Montana Duke (Billie Lourd). Upon arriving at the camp, they encounter its owner, the deeply religious Margaret Booth (Leslie Grossman), who was once a camper there, and who has her own experience surviving a killer. Other residents of Camp Redwood include its nurse Rita (Angelica Ross), activities director Trevor Kirchner (Matthew Morrison), and camp chef Bertie (Tara Karsian). Not long after the counselors settle into their first week, news breaks that deranged murderer Benjamin Richter ‚Äì also known as Mr. Jingles (John Carroll Lynch)‚Äîwho has a violent history at Camp Redwood‚Äîhas escaped a local insane asylum and is presumed to be heading for the camp. However, as the season progresses, more secrets unveil about the counselors, as well as flashbacks detailing the history of the camp, including Richter's abusive mother Lavinia (Lily Rabe). =Season 10 = On August 3, 2018, the series was renewed for a tenth season. In November 2019, Murphy announced that some cast members from the first three seasons may return for the upcoming tenth season, saying, \\"[T]he people who helped build this show into what it is, who believed in it from the beginning, have been contacted and are interested. So, if you look at the iconography of the first three seasons, you can figure who I've gone to and who might be coming back.\\" He also said that the tenth season would be \\"about reuniting fan-favorite actors to come back.\\" Later that day, Sarah Paulson confirmed that she would be returning to the series for its tenth season in a lead role. On February 26, 2020, Murphy revealed via his Instagram account that Kathy Bates, Leslie Grossman, Billie Lourd, Evan Peters, Adina Porter, Lily Rabe, Angelica Ross, Finn Wittrock, and series newcomer Macaulay Culkin were cast in the tenth season. On May 26, it was announced that season 10 would be pushed back to 2021 due to production being stalled because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. On August 28, it was reported that production is scheduled to resume filming in October. =Future seasons= On December 5, 2018, Murphy said the witches from Coven and Apocalypse will return in a future season. On January 9, 2020, the series was renewed for three more seasons. Production =Conception= Creators Murphy and Falchuk began working on American Horror Story before their Fox series Glee began production. Murphy wanted to do the opposite of what he had done previously and thus began his work on the series. He stated: \\"I went from Nip/Tuck to Glee, so it made sense that I wanted to do something challenging and dark. And I always had loved, as Brad had, the horror genre. So it just was a natural for me.\\" Falchuk was intrigued by the idea of putting a different angle on the horror genre, stating that their main goal in creating the series was to scare viewers. \\"You want people to be a little bit off balance afterwards,\\" he said. In February 2011, FX officially announced that it had ordered a pilot for a possible series from Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk, with both Murphy and Falchuk writing and Murphy directing. Dante Di Loreto was announced as executive producer. Production on the series began in April 2011. In July 2011, FX officially announced the project had been picked up to become a full series. From the beginning, Murphy and Falchuk planned that each season of the series would tell a different story. After the first- season finale aired, Murphy spoke of his plans to change the cast and location for the second season. He did say, however, that some actors who starred in the first season would be returning. \\"The people that are coming back will be playing completely different characters, creatures, monsters, etc. [The Harmons'] stories are done. People who are coming back will be playing entirely new characters,\\" he announced. In November 2012, FX chief executive, John Landgraf, described the unique format of the series stating: \\"[T]he notion of doing an anthological series of miniseries with a repertory cast ‚Äì has proven groundbreaking, wildly successful and will prove to be trendsetting.\\" At the 2013 PaleyFest, Falchuk compared the series to horror films: \\"It does demand a little bit of compassion at the end because you fall in love with these characters in a different way than you would in a movie,\\" he said. \\"If you want to kill everybody in a movie except one person, you can kind of get away with that, but if you're looking to do a horror TV show, you have a different responsibility to the characters because the audience has a different affection for them.\\" Murphy then explained the process of planning a series' season takes about a year. \\"We come up with story first and then we come up with the characters,\\" he said. \\"It is a repertory company, so we'll move people around and sometimes there won't yet be a role for somebody. Like when we started [the second season], I really had no idea that Dylan [McDermott] would be the person to play Sarah's son, but the deeper we got, I thought, that would work great.\\" In an August 2015 article for Entertainment Weekly, Murphy revealed that the show is producing two seasons a year, the first being broadcast late in the year and the second early in the next year. He explained, \\"We're doing something that we've never done before on the show where we're doing two different groups of writers rooms. Some of our writers will be bouncing around but a whole different group coming in late August. The next thing we're crafting up is very, very different than [Hotel]. Not smaller. But just not opulent. More rogue and more dark.\\" =Casting= Connie Britton was the first to be cast in the series, portraying female lead Vivien Harmon on Murder House. Denis O'Hare joined second as Larry Harvey. Jessica Lange soon followed as Constance, her first regular role on television. Dylan McDermott joined the cast soon after Lange as the male lead Ben Harmon. Taissa Farmiga and Evan Peters were the last actors to be added to the main cast, portraying Violet Harmon and Tate Langdon, respectively. In March 2012, Murphy revealed that the second season had been planned around Jessica Lange, who portrays Sister Jude, a sadistic nun who runs the asylum. Evan Peters, Sarah Paulson, Lily Rabe and Zachary Quinto also return to join the main cast. Peters portrays Kit Walker, an inmate accused of murdering his wife. Paulson portrays Lana Winters, a lesbian reporter who gets committed to the asylum because of her sexuality and intent to snoop around the sanitarium. Rabe's character is Sister Mary Eunice, clumsy second-in-charge to Sister Jude. Quinto portrays Dr. Thredson, a psychiatrist at the asylum. Lizzie Brocher√© stars as Grace Bertrand, a character described originally as \\"a fierce, ferocious, extremely sexual, and dangerous wild-child sexpot\\", but the role was later heavily revamped. James Cromwell co-stars as Dr. Arthur Arden, who proclaims to be in charge of the asylum and performs dark experiments on its patients. Joseph Fiennes starred as Monsignor Timothy Howard, a possible love interest for Sister Jude. For the third season, series executive producers and co-creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk stated that, as with the second season, \\"many actors\\" would return in different roles, beginning with Jessica Lange. Evan Peters and Sarah Paulson were confirmed to return, portraying Kyle Spencer and Cordelia Goode, respectively. Murphy added that Lange would portray a \\"real glamour-cat lady\\", later revealed to be named Fiona Goode. Taissa Farmiga, Violet in the first season, starred as Zoe Benson, a character that is involved in a prominent romance during the season. Lily Rabe co-starred as Misty Day. Recurring cast member Frances Conroy joined as a main cast member, playing the character of Myrtle Snow. Oscar-winning actress Kathy Bates was confirmed to co-star. It was first reported that she would portray \\"a woman who, at the start, is Lange's character's best friend, but will become her worst enemy\\", but this was altered. Murphy stated that Bates' character will be \\"five times worse than [her] Misery character\\" and is also inspired by a \\"true event\\". She portrayed Madame Delphine LaLaurie, an immortal racist. It was announced in May 2013 that Emma Roberts had been added to the cast. Roberts played Madison Montgomery, a \\"self-involved party girl\\". In July 2013, season one alum Denis O'Hare also joined the cast in an unknown role, later revealed as Spalding. In November 2013, Ryan Murphy confirmed that Jessica Lange would be returning for a fourth season, although in a reduced capacity. It was later revealed she would be playing freak show owner Elsa Mars. Kathy Bates returned in a main role, portraying bearded lady Ethel Darling. On March 29, 2014, Murphy announced that Sarah Paulson, Evan Peters, Frances Conroy, Emma Roberts, Denis O'Hare, and Angela Bassett would all return for the fourth season. Paulson portrayed conjoined sisters Bette and Dot Tattler; Peters portrayed \\"Lobster Boy\\" Jimmy Darling; Conroy played the well-off Gloria Mott; Bassett portrayed three-breasted hermaphrodite Desiree Dupree; and O'Hare played Stanley, a conman working with Roberts' Maggie Esmerelda. At PaleyFest 2014, it was revealed that Michael Chiklis would be joining the cast as Dell Toledo, the father of Jimmy, ex-husband of Ethel, and current husband of Desiree. Finn Wittrock later joined the main cast as Gloria's spoiled son, Dandy Mott. For the series' fifth cycle, singer- songwriter Lady Gaga was announced as the first and newest main cast member on February 25, 2015. After a special guest appearance on the previous season, Matt Bomer joined the fifth season's cast along with series newcomer Cheyenne Jackson during PaleyFest 2015.

Designed and built in 1908 by Alfred Rosenheim, the president of the American Institute of Architects' Los Angeles chapter, the Tudor or Collegiate Gothic-style single family home was previously used as a convent. The first season was filmed on sets which are an exact replica of the house. Details such as Louis Comfort Tiffany stained glass windows and hammered bronze light fixtures were recreated to preserve the look of the house. Production and shooting for the second season began in late July 2012 for a scheduled premiere in mid October. The exteriors for the second season were filmed in Hidden Valley, Ventura County, California, a rural area outside Los Angeles, although the season took place in Massachusetts. Principal photography for the third season began on July 23, 2013, in New Orleans, Louisiana. It was first reported that the season would be filmed in multiple locations, but filming primarily took place in New Orleans. Principal photography for the fourth season began on July 15, 2014, in New Orleans, though the story takes place in Jupiter, Florida. Principal photography for the fifth season began on July 14, 2015, in Los Angeles, California, where the story also takes place. Murphy revealed a six- story hotel set was being built on the Fox lot. A dummy set of the hotel was built at the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con, showing an Art Deco-style building from the 1920s, inspired by the old Hollywood era. Filming for the sixth season began on July 6, 2016 at Santa Clarita, California. Set constructions include a colonial settler home to speculate the disappearance of the Roanoke Colony. Filming for the seventh season was originally planned to begin in Orange, California, in June 2017 before it was moved to May instead. Filming for the eighth season began on June 16, 2018. It was filmed in multiple locations. On July 11, 2019, Murphy confirmed that the ninth season had begun filming. =Title sequences= American Horror Story title screens offer vague hints to important plot elements and events that compose each season. For Murder House, Murphy described the sequence as a mini-mystery and stated that: \\"By the time you see the ninth episode of this season, every image in that title sequence will be explained,\\" establishing the purpose of the title sequence for future seasons. The opening title sequence was created by Kyle Cooper and his company Prologue. He also created the title sequence for the AMC series The Walking Dead and the 1995 film Seven. The theme music was composed by sound designer Cesar Davila-Irizarry and musician Charlie Clouser. The cinematography was done by Juan Ruiz Anch√≠a and the editing by Gabriel J. Diaz. For Murder House, the sequence is set in the Harmons' basement and includes images of postmortem young children, fetuses in jars, skulls, a christening dress, a nurse's uniform, and a figure holding a pair of bloody hedge clippers. A photo of alleged axe murderer Lizzie Borden is also shown. Texts in the sequence are white, superimposed on black background and have a film burning effect. Asylums opening sequence is done by the same creative team. \\"We are shooting a new title sequence with the same team that did last year's,\\" series creator Ryan Murphy said. \\"The song may stay... not sure.\\" The music was kept, and the new title sequence was set around the Asylum, using shots of inmates raving and surgeons operating on patients with bandages obscuring their faces. Elements include a young girl walking backwards on her hands and feet up a staircase and a shot of the Virgin Mary's smile changing from one of benevolence to one of spite. Texts in the sequence are yellow, superimposed on a black grainy background. Covens opening sequence keeps the same music, and this sequence is the first one to be filmed primarily outside and not in an enclosed location. Shots include figures wearing black robes and capirotes, a skeletal creature with wings and shots of dead goats, the Minotaur from the season also appears. For the first time, there are actual backgrounds that appear with the actor names instead of an all-black background, some of these images include witches hanging and Santa Muerte. Other elements include a black man with piercing eyes and a disturbing smile as well as voodoo dolls burning. The final shot continues after the figures in black capirotes seize one of their own who is later seen burning at a stake where young, dress-clad witches dance around. Freak Shows opening sequence changed things up, the series' theme music remains intact albeit with an added carnival-like soundscape. The sequence is composed of both CGI and stop-motion animation and features strange characters such as a skeletal chimera of a human being and an elephant riding a bicycle, a skeleton of what appears to be a single head but two bodies, a devilish-looking man, a boy in a wheelchair with deformed legs, a character with severe syndactyly of the hands and feet, a clown who can twist his head around, a woman with a third leg where her genitalia should be, and a demonic cymbal-banging monkey toy. There are also shots of side show attractions like the Human Blockhead, knife throwing and sword swallowing. The main recurring element features a balloon twister popping balloons with a knife. All text appeared to be made from rusty metal. Hotels opening sequence also was very different from previous seasons, taking more of a biblical approach. The font, while remaining the same as the first four seasons, glows in red against a hotel wallpaper. The Ten Commandments are also shown throughout the sequence. The intro returns to live-action like the first three seasons. Visuals include many people scrubbing blood all over the walls and the floor, strange things shown through peepholes, people being victims to the hotel, little kids running around the hotel, a woman screaming as she smears lipstick all over her face, as well as many different creatures. Roanoke featured no title sequence or opening credits, instead opting for a simple title card from the first season, Murder House, while the series' theme music plays over the end credits. At the end of the finale's credits, the title of the season \\"American Horror Story: Roanoke\\" was revealed. In the development of Cult, Murphy confirmed that the opening sequence would return. Cult's opening sequence features the series' theme music played by a marching band. The sequence is live-action. Visuals include: a gang of clowns rising from a casket, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton masks, a George Washington statue, a dead dog killed by toxic gas, a Merry Go Round, bloody hands that cannot be washed, a beehive, toxic smoke released from a grenade, holes in several forms, a bloody US flag with the sound of a xylophone playing \\"The Star- Spangled Banner\\", a blood-covered couple having sex, a magician pulling guts out of a hat and a handcuffed pinky promise. All text appeared to be made from rusty metal. The texts interact with the graphic behind them, sometimes also bloody. For the first time, the title is abbreviated as AHS instead of American Horror Story. Apocalypses opening sequence features the original theme music from the first three seasons. The sequence includes images of nuclear disaster and sketches of demons fusing together. Other visuals include burning candles, snakes, both human and goat skulls, a scorpion, a blooming flower, and photos of nuclear-testing documents. Visuals from the title sequences of both season one and season three are also included with slight alterations, including the skeletal winged creature in the forest (Coven), the nurse's blouse (Murder House), a picture of a baby that has been set on fire (Murder House), and the goat skulls (Coven). All text appeared to be glowing in pale yellow and red. 1984s opening sequence is inspired by a fan-made concept that strongly impressed Ryan Murphy. Corey Vega, the creator of the fan-made title sequence, was invited to work with American Horror Story veteran title-sequence designer Kyle Cooper to create the official sequence. The sequence imitates old VHS video quality. For the first time, a new slasher-style font is used for the text with the exception of vowels \\"O\\" and \\"A\\" staying with the original series' logo font. Visuals include: five Jazzercise instructors warming up before blood stains the screen, peaceful camping activities, bloody sharp objects (knives, cleavers, and an axe), a hidden killer in black, moonwalking, footage of the 1984 United States presidential election, cassette tapes, a smashed blood-filled wine glass, vehicles gearing up, and a campfire exploding. It ends with a self-destructed cassette. Names of the cast are superimposed on colorful neon graphics. The title is abbreviated as AHS instead of American Horror Story for the second time, after Cult. And for the second time, the last name mentioned is not given an \\"and\\" credit, also after Cult. The title sequence for seasons 1 to 8 of the show use a variation of the Willow typeface that very closely resembles a style for which Scottish designer Charles Rennie Mackintosh was known. The font is still used in season 9 but is mixed with another font from a fan's choice. Promotion As part of the promotion for the series, FX launched a \\"House Call\\" campaign, in which viewers at home could sign up and come face- to-face with a character from the series. Prior to the series premiere, FX released several clues to shine light on the series. They were offered on the show's official YouTube channel. Ten clues were released. In September 2011, FX launched a website which allows visitors to tour the Murder House throughout the decades and look for clues. In August 2012, the first promo for the second season was released on the American Horror Story Facebook page entitled \\"Special Delivery\\", in which a nun carries a couple of buckets filled with body parts through a field. As a church bell rings, the nun empties one bucket's bloody contents, leaving the empty bucket behind, and resumes her trek. Over 20 subsequent teasers were released. Four photos were also released on EW.com. Two televised teasers, titled \\"Meet the Residents\\", were released on August 31, 2012. They feature the patients and some staff (such as Dr. Thredson, played by Zachary Quinto, and Sister Mary Eunice, played by Lily Rabe) lying in twin beds and dealing with their individual issues as the heads of the asylum (Jessica Lange, Joseph Fiennes and James Cromwell) look on. The song \\"Que Sera, Sera\\", mixed with the show's theme music, plays. To promote Cult, a competition was set up where fans who donated to the Children's Hospital Los Angeles could get a chance to get a walk-on role in an episode, and lunch with Evan Peters. Overall, premises and characters for each season are typically kept under wraps until soon before premiers and are alluded to with brief and vague teaser trailers. =Universal's Halloween Horror Nights= On August 16, 2016, FX announced a deal had been struck to feature an American Horror Story exhibit at Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Orlando for their Halloween Horror Nights events. The maze featured sets and themes from Murder House, Freak Show, and Hotel. Universal Parks & Resorts said of the experience, \\"Twisted scenes from Murder House will unleash the evil spirits that possess the Harmon estate, spiraling guests through decades of the tortured dead who previously resided there. In Freak Show, guests joined a troupe of biological misfits in a sinister sideshow where they were stalked by the murderous and deformed Twisty the Clown. Finally, guests succumbed to the warped desires of The Countess after checking into the haunted Hotel Cortez, conceived from the beginning as a torture chamber for its customers.\\" In 2017, the show returned as haunted attractions to both parks, with Universal Orlando having an attraction based on Asylum, Coven, and Roanoke, and Universal Studios Hollywood basing their attraction solely on Roanoke. In December 2017, The Walt Disney Company announced it would purchase 21st Century Fox which included the 20th Century Fox film and TV assets. The deal was completely finalized on March 20, 2019, making 20th Century Fox officially part of The Walt Disney Studios. As Disney and Universal are bitter rivals in the theme park business (especially for their Central Florida properties), this would likely end the franchise's presence in Halloween Horror Nights at Universal parks.

Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly awarded the pilot episode a B+, stating: \\"AHS is pretty much all scare, all the time: a whole lotta screams, sex, jolts, mashed faces, psychotic behavior, and dead babies.\\" Hank Stuever from The Washington Post said in his review that: \\"Overdoing things is one of Murphy's trademark flaws, but this show has a captivating style and giddy gross-outs.\\" Not all reviews were favorable: Alan Sepinwall of HitFix gave the series a D‚àí, saying: \\"It is so far over the top that the top is a microscopic speck in its rearview mirror, and so full of strange sounds, sights and characters that you likely won't forget it ‚Äì even though many of you will wish you could.\\" Sepinwall would later go on to call it one of the worst TV shows of 2011. The Los Angeles Times Mary McNamara gave it a mixed review, stating that it \\"collapses into camp... upon more than one occasion\\" but also noting that it is \\"hard to look away.\\" The second season, American Horror Story: Asylum, received positive reviews from critics.

James Poniewozik from Time stated: \\"AHS: Asylum feels like a more focused, if equally frenetic, screamfest. It's also gorgeously realized, with a vision of its '60s institution setting so detailed you can smell the stale air and incense.\\" Maureen Ryan of The Huffington Post said: \\"It's to the credit of Asylum writers, directors and cast that the emotional pain of the characters often feels as real as their uncertainty and terror.\\" Verne Gay from Newsday gave the season a C grade, stating it \\"has some good special effects, just not much of a story to hang them on.\\" Linda Stasi of the New York Post thought the season was \\"over the top,\\" adding: \\"I need to enter [an asylum] myself after two hours of this craziness.\\" The third season, American Horror Story: Coven, received positive reviews from critics.

Not all reviews were positive, however, with criticism focused on both the story and character arcs in the second half of the season. The A.V.

Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 78% of 34 critics gave the season a positive review. The site's consensus is: \\"Though it may turn off new viewers unaccustomed to its unabashed weirdness, Freak Show still brings the thrills, thanks to its reliably stylish presentation and game cast.\\" This season was Jessica Lange‚Äôs final major performance on the show, however it was not her last appearance.

At the time, the entire state of California had fewer than 200 acres planted to Chardonnay.Hanzell Vineyards \\"History of Hanzell Vineyards \\".

History The first plantings of Hanzell took place in 1953, when Zellerbach planted two acres of Pinot noir and four acres of Chardonnay. James Zellerbach and winemaker Ralph Bradford \\"Brad\\" Webb aimed to produce wines that would compare favorably to Old World wines such as Burgundy, but were quick to adopt some of the modernizing winemaking techniques that became characteristic of New World style of winemaking. Webb commissioned what are believed to be the first small temperature-controlled stainless steel fermenters, an early nitrogen-sparged bottling machine and an electrode to measure dissolved oxygen.\\"Wines that Changed the Industry,\\" Wines & Vines (January 2009) Vineyards Hanzell Sonoma Valley Pinot noir. Hanzell Chardonnay from Sonoma Valley. The original vines planted at Hanzell are purported to be the oldest continually producing Chardonnay and Pinot Noir vines in the Western Hemisphere. The original Chardonnay vines planted at Hanzell are Wente Clone and arrived at Hanzell by way of the McCreas' Stony Hill vineyard in St. Helena, which obtained its cuttings from the Wente Livermore Vineyard in 1948.FPS Ibid. The original Pinot noir vines planted at Hanzell were derived from Martin Ray estate cuttings (now commonly referred to as the Mount Eden clone). The original Pinot noir vines at Mount Eden Vineyards were pulled out in 1997, and the original block of Pinot noir at Chalone planted in 1946 was replaced in 2003.\\"Hanzell Vineyards: Revered After More than 50 Vintages\\" in Pinotfile Vol. 8, No. 15 (May 24, 2010) As of 2010, the 1953 blocks (C53 and N53) at Hanzell continue to produce, and the grapes are typically blended with grapes from the vines planted in subsequent years.

Index description The index was computed from a basket of the 50 most liquid stocks traded on the Paris Stock Exchange, the Paris Bourse. At the time the CAC 40 did not exist yet, the French stock exchange instead published (at the end of each trading day) a trend indicator of the French stock market. The data was computed using the closing value of the 240 largest stocks by market value. The EFX 50 was the first stock index in Paris with a streaming update based on the transaction prices of the underlying stocks.

The contracts were traded electronically from workstations located in the dealing rooms of the exchange members. The contracts were cash settled. At its launch OMF exchange members included the large European, Japanese and American banks which also traded the notional bond contract on the MATIF. Market makers on the EFX 50 future contracts included SocGen and BNP. OMF also provided clearing of the contracts and acted as a clearing house. It was granted a bank charter by the Bank of France. OMF was thus able to guarantee the trades. In July 1988, OMF was acquired by a consortium of French banks. OMF was later merged into MATIF SA which launched the CAC 40 futures contract.

made short film musical, directed by Hanus Burger, starring Lena Horne, Albert Ammons, Pete Johnson and Teddy Wilson and his orchestra. Scott Yanow identifies it as a sextet.Scott Yanow, \\"Jazz on Film,\\" Backbeat Books, San Francisco, 2004, p. 23 It is a significant film in the history of jazz for its early glimpse of Lena Horne (in her second film) and as the only film of boogie-woogie piano masters Albert Ammons and Pete Johnson. Synopsis In a nightclub, Teddy Wilson and his orchestra are laying down their last groove for the night. In the audience, Mr. Weathercoop (Russel Morrison) and his date (Virginia Pine) briefly discuss Wilson's band. Back in the kitchen, where Albert Ammons is hanging paper and Pete Johnson tunes a piano, a kitchen maid (Lena Horne) begins to sing about how she would like to perform in a new gown, rather than to wash dishes. Pete Johnson provides an impromptu accompaniment, and then Ammons joins in on a duet; a cutaway informs us that the Weathercoops are paying attention. The Weathercoops fall asleep, and this leads to a dream where the kitchen maid has gotten her evening gown; she introduces Ammons and Johnson, who play Boogie Woogie Dream. Teddy Wilson then conjures up his band and backs up the maid, with some help from Johnson, on the song Unlucky Woman. This is followed by a jam with Wilson's band, illustrated by a montage. Ammons, Johnson and the kitchen maid are then seen sleeping, propped up at the piano; the phone rings and wakes them up. Mr. Weathercoop ends up with the call, and afterward gives the others the offer that they have been dreaming about. Background and dissemination Hanus (or Hannes) Burger (1909‚Äì1990) was a Czech documentary filmmaker who had fled to the United States in the wake of the Anschluss; footage he had taken when the Germans invaded Prague was incorporated into the acclaimed documentary film Crisis (1939 film), which Burger co-directed with Herbert Kline and Alexander Hammid. Crisis was widely acclaimed in the United States, and its success of helped propel Burger through a long string of left-wing documentaries, U.S. War Department films and other kinds of official documentary work throughout the 1940s. Boogie Woogie Dream was a side project, inspired by the musicians at Caf√© Society in New York, a popular nightspot and frequent location for live radio remotes; it served as the flash point for the Boogie Woogie craze in New York City. Boogie Woogie Dream was written by Austrian cabaret performer and emigrant Karl Farkas and produced by Mark Marvin, a playwright and the older brother of Herbert Kline. It was made by Burger and his small crew at Astoria Studios on Long Island. Albert Ammons and Pete Johnson, Horne, and Teddy Wilson and his orchestra were all acts then engaged at Caf√© Society; Wilson was an established swing bandleader and pianist, whereas Horne was a relative newcomer. According to Burger, he had first wanted to engage Billie Holiday to play the kitchen maid in the film, but Holiday proved unavailable for the shooting, and he settled on Horne instead.Burger, Hanu≈°: Der Fr√ºhling war es wert. Erinnerungen. M√ºnchen: Bertelsmann, 1977 The film was shot in the latter part of September 1941, but it took at least three years for Burger to render it into a completed form. Burger sold it outright to Bert and Jack Goldberg in 1944; the Goldbergs were entrepreneurs in the field of race movies marketed directly to black audiences. By this time, Lena Horne had already become a star in mainstream Hollywood films. The Goldbergs extracted three distinct sections from the film, \\"Unlucky Woman,\\" \\"My New Gown\\" and \\"Boogie Woogie Dream\\" (consisting only of Ammons and Johnson's duet) and redistributed the shorter films through Soundies Distributing Corporation, who copyrighted the titles on December 30, 1944. Nevertheless, the Goldbergs also passed the short versions on to the theatrical distributor Sack Amusements, while continuing to book the original film on a States' Rights Basis; it was also distributed to the home market in 16mm. Preservation The only copyrights filed relating to Boogie Woogie Dream were for the Soundies shorts derived from it. No prints are known of what the film may have been like before it was sold to the Goldbergs; the \\"Official Films\\" logo is seen at the front of all surviving copies of the longer version, indicating that the 16mm home version is the main extant source for the film. If they made any other changes in the film itself, however, Burger never commented on them. 16mm prints of the full film are held by the Black Film Center/Archive at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana and at the UCLA Film and Television Archive. It has been included on several DVDs; the short versions crop up also on video collections going back into the VHS era.

While it took 40,000,000 years to develop the Grand Canyon in Arizona, the young Rhine dug this gorge within 10,000 years. This is the age of Flims Rockslide, which covered the original Rhine valley with its debris. The river is still running through debris, meaning it has not reached the former valley yet. Flims Rockslide is the biggest rockslide whose effects are still visible in the world. The platform has the shape of a common swift, a common sight at the southern faces of the gorge, and consists of one single pylon, anchored by wire rope. There is no access to near the platform for individual traffic nor public transport and the only means of transport is a privately rented carriage.

It is a northern foothill of the Cantabrian Mountains. The range is located in the municipalities of northeast Caravia, Colunga in the northwest, Pilo√±a, Parres and Ribadesella to the east and south. Geography The Sierra del Sueve is calcareous. In the westernmost section, shales, limestone, and sandstone form smooth river valleys that contrast with the eastern section, which is dominated by quartzite. In the central section, the limestone range is the main relief. Sinkhole karst are a dominant geomorphological feature in the Sierra del Sueve. There are two adjacent ranges, the Sueve whose highest peak is the Picu Pienzu at above sea level, and the El Fito (Fitu), a small mountain, with a peak of the same name. These mostly consist of limestone and quartzite. The climate is humid and rainy, with mild temperatures due to the proximity to the sea. At the summit, fog is abundant due to the sea effects. Wind is common. Protected area The area is a protected landscape that includes with both the range and the coast. Covering an area of , it is divided between the municipalities of Caravia, Colunga, Parres, Pilo√±a, and Ribadesella. The Sueve Range includes a Regional Hunting Reserve within its limits. Its proximity to the sea adds to its ecological value. Farming and mountain grazing areas for cows, goats, sheep, horses and ponies are also part of the landscape. =Flora= Though Sierra del Sueve manifests a high degree of deforestation, it retains some remnants of forest. La Biescona is a beech forest in the northern area of the range close to the coast where there are clumps of chestnut trees and the remains of pine and eucalyptus reforestation, scattered between areas of shrubland and meadows. The most notable forested area is at the northern end where the trees are clumped and dominated by holly groves and espinera while also containing other species such as ash, beech, birch, elm, hazel, maple, yew, Wild Pear and brush. Lastly, at the base of the mountain on its north side, there is a microclimate and an enclave of ferns whose distribution in such a non-tropical area makes them very rare, not only in Asturias but throughout Europe. In the populated shores, ferns are present as a rare mattress ferns or helechilla and estando ambas (Trichomanes speciosum); both species are listed under the Catalogue Regional Threatened Flora. =Fauna= Wildlife includes fox, wild boar, feral pigs (Sus scrofa), roe deer, and the Asturian horse breed of Asturcon. Asturias, found in the high mountains of Sierra del Sueve are rare species with black or bay colour but without any white pigmentation. It is a small breed that does not trot but moves with an easy gait, leading to its popularity as a \\"ladies' mount\\". The Romans called this breed ‚Äúasturcones‚Äù. This breed, which was facing extinction, has been protected by breed associations for further breeding. The deer species of Dama dama (female), which was reintroduced in the 1960s for hunting adopted well to the region and their population had to be often controlled. However, efforts to introduce male deer, the stag (Cervus elaphus), were not successful and they moved away to other places in the eastern areas near Fito. Vertebrate fauna are also a species of special concern. Also present here are the Alpine chough (Pyrrhocorax graculus), the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), cave bats (Miniopterus schreibersi) and reptiles such as the mountain lizard (Iberolacerta monticola). Birds of prey include the Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus), a threatened species. Tourism Sierra del Sueve can be accessed by road from Infiesto and Colunga by the AS-258; the AS-432 to La Torre; and also the N-632. The viewpoint at the peak of Fitu provides excellent vistas of the shallow coastal zone from Caravia to Villaviciosa. Hiking and mountaineering are favoured in the range. There are routes that begin in the town of Carand√≠a; another through Portil, the MUA and Requexu lake; and another from Pilo√±a. An Interpretation Center of the Sierra del Sueve was established in April 2007 by the City of Colunga to guide visitors on visit the sea and mountains.

The three works demonstrate a progression in van Gogh's artistic style after his arrival in Paris. The first is somber, and formed from a simple composition. The second introduces van Gogh's Japanese prints. The last and most advanced in style, skill and color integrates Japanese, Impressionist, and other influences on the Parisian artist community. This painting conveys a sense of serenity that van Gogh seeks for himself. This last painting of Tanguy is in the Mus√©e Rodin, Paris. Van Gogh in Paris In 1886 van Gogh left the Netherlands never to return. He moved to Paris to live with his brother Theo, a Parisian art dealer. Vincent entered Paris as a shy, somber man. While his personality would never change, he emerged artistically into what one critic described as a \\"singing bird\\". Although van Gogh had been influenced by great masters in the Netherlands, coming to Paris meant that he was exposed to Impressionists, Symbolists, Pointillists, and Japanese art (see Japonism). His circle of friends included Camille Pissarro, Henri Toulouse-Lautrec, Paul Gauguin, √âmile Bernard, Paul Signac, and others. The works of the Japanese ukiyo-e artists Hiroshige and Hokusai greatly influenced van Gogh, both for the subject matter and the style of flat patterns of colors without shadow. In the two years from 1886 through 1888 he spent working in Paris, van Gogh explored the various genres, creating his own unique style. The painting The brightly colored painting and confident subject represent a shift in Vincent's attitude. Van Gogh called his use of bright colors \\"gymnastics\\" that through experimentation created great depth, harmony and balance in his work. The painting contains a background of van Gogh's Japanese prints that were sold at Tanguy's shop. On top of Tanguy's hat is Mount Fuji; Kabuki actors share the wall with cherry trees in bloom. The Japanese paintings represent van Gogh's search for serenity, which he describes in a letter to his sister during this period, \\"Having as much of this serenity as possible, even though one knows little ‚Äì nothing ‚Äì for certain, is perhaps a better remedy for all diseases than all the things that are sold at the chemist's shop.\\" In an effort to capture serenity in his painting, Van Gogh paints Tanguy with a calm, contemplative nature. Historian of Symbolism Naomi Maurer describes him as having the \\"iconic tranquility of Buddha.\\" Van Gogh died in 1890 and Tanguy four years after. Following Tanguy's death, his daughter sold the Portrait of P√®re Tanguy to sculptor Auguste Rodin. The Portrait of P√®re Tanguy, previously in Rodin's personal collection, is in the permanent collection at Mus√©e Rodin in Paris. Julien Tanguy Julien Fran√ßois Tanguy (1825 Pl√©dran - 1894 Paris) was a paint grinder who sold art supplies and was also an art dealer, one of the first to offer van Gogh's paintings for sale. His jovial demeanor and enthusiasm for artistry and artists made his shop one of the most favored art supply shops in Paris, and he was nicknamed P√®re (\\"Father\\") Tanguy. Maurer calls Tanguy a father figure who shared his food and money with artists and showed their paintings with pride. Tanguy took paintings as payment for paints, which √âmile Bernard said made entering his shop in Montmartre, full of Impressionist paintings, like \\"visiting a museum\\". In comparison to her husband, Tanguy's wife was less cooperative and more concerned with clientele paying outstanding charges. When Tanguy died, his friends staged an auction for his widow. Octave Mirbeau wrote a notice about him in L'√âcho de Paris on 13 February 1894. Three Portraits of Julien Tanguy Van Gogh painted three portraits of Julien (P√®re) Tanguy. Portrait of P√®re Tanguy, winter 1886/87. (47x38.5cm) (F263) In winter 1886/87 van Gogh painted his first portrait of Tanguy. It is mostly brown, with a touch of red on his lips and a green on his apron. Writer Victoria Finlay describes him as looking more like a workman than an art dealer. Portrait of P√®re Tanguy, The second painting of P√®re Tanguy by Vincent van Gogh (65 cm x 51 cm) (F364) In 1887, van Gogh began to experiment with brighter colors, such as red against green and orange against blue. The other two paintings show him sitting in front of a colorful wall of Japanese prints. The second to the right was painted by van Gogh in one thirty-minute sitting, and Tanguy kept the original version of the painting. Actor Edward G. Robinson and his wife Gladys Lloyd Robinson, a painter, owned the painting, which they sold to Greek shipping tycoon Stavros Niarchos. The second, more advanced painting with Japanese prints is held in the Mus√©e Rodin in Paris.

Their curvilinear shape is often accentuated by low albedo regions that wind between the bright swirls. They appear to overlay the lunar surface, superposed on top of craters and ejecta deposits, but impart no observable topography. Swirls have been identified on the lunar maria and highlands - they are not associated with a specific lithologic composition. Swirls on the maria are characterized by strong albedo contrasts and complex, sinuous morphology, whereas those on highland terrain appear less prominent and exhibit simpler shapes, such as single loops or diffuse bright spots.  Association with magnetic anomalies  The lunar swirls are coincident with regions of the magnetic field of the Moon with relatively high strength on a planetary body that lacks, and may never have had, an active core dynamo with which to generate its own magnetic field. Every swirl has an associated magnetic anomaly, but not every magnetic anomaly has an identifiable swirl. Orbital magnetic field mapping by the Apollo 15 and 16 sub-satellites, Lunar Prospector, and Kaguya show regions with a local magnetic field. Because the Moon has no currently active global magnetic field, these regional anomalies are regions of remnant magnetism; their origin remains controversial.  Formation models  There are three leading models for swirl formation. Each model must address two characteristics of lunar swirls formation: # The lunar swirls are optically immature. # The lunar swirls are associated with magnetic anomalies. Models for creation of the magnetic anomalies associated with lunar swirls point to the observation that several of the magnetic anomalies are antipodal to the younger, large impact basins on the Moon. =Cometary impact model= This theory argues that the high albedo of the swirls is the result of an impact with a comet. The impact would cause scouring of the top-most surface regolith by the coma‚Äôs turbulent flow of gas and dust, which exposed fresh material and redeposited the fine, scoured material in discrete deposits. According to this model, the associated strong magnetic anomalies are the result of magnetization of near-surface materials heated above the Curie temperature through hyper-velocity gas collisions and micro-impacts as the coma impacted the surface. Proponents of the cometary impact model consider the occurrence of many swirls antipodal the major basins to be coincidental or the result of incomplete mapping of swirl locations. =Solar wind shielding model= This theory suggests that the swirls are formed because the lighter-colored regolith is protected from the solar wind, due to a magnetic anomaly. The swirls represent exposed silicate materials whose albedos have been selectively preserved over time from the effects of space weathering via deflection of solar wind ion bombardment. According to this model, optical maturation of exposed silicate surfaces is a result of solar wind ion bombardment. This model suggests that swirl formation is a continuing process, which began after creation of the magnetic anomaly. Mathematical simulations conducted in 2018 showed that lava tubes could have become magnetic as they cooled, which would provide a magnetic field consistent with the observations near the lunar swirls. =Dust transport model= The dust transport model proposes that weak electric fields created by interaction between the crustal magnetic anomalies and the solar wind plasma could attract or repel electrically charged fine dust. High albedo, feldspathic material is the dominant component of the finest particles of lunar soil. Electrostatic movement of dust lofted above the surface during terminator crossings could cause this material to preferentially accumulate and form the bright, looping swirl patterns. Satellite measurements Direct magnetic observations of the lunar swirls have been conducted by many lunar spacecraft, including Clementine and Lunar Prospector. The results of these observations are inconsistent with the Cometary impact model. Further observations by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter support the theory that solar wind is being deflected by a magnetic field. Spectral observations by the Moon Mineralogy Mapper instrument on board Chandrayaan-1 confirmed that the lighter-colored regions are deficient in hydroxide, which also supports the hypothesis that solar wind is being deflected in the pale areas. , a CubeSat mission concept is under study at NASA, with the goal of understanding the formation of the lunar swirls. The proposed Bi-sat Observations of the Lunar Atmosphere above Swirls, or BOLAS mission would involve two small satellites connected with a space tether. The lower CubeSat would orbit at an altitude of six miles above the surface.Bi-Sat Observations of the Lunar Atmosphere Above Swirls (BOLAS): Tethered SmallSat Investigation of Hydration and Space Weathering Processes at the Moon.

He was nicknamed ƒåika Daƒça which roughly translates to Mister Daƒça. Life On 14 September 1903, he formed the first football club in the Kingdom of Serbia (which then excluded Vojvodina), the FK ≈†umadija becoming its president until 1906, when he moved to Belgrade. In 1911 he was a founding member of BSK where he became vice- president. However, a year later, after disagreements with the direction, he left BSK and became president of another Belgrade club, SK Du≈°anovac. With the start of the Balkan War he joined the Serbian Army and was relocated to Kragujevac. At the end of the war he returned to Belgrade and he formed, along with a group of dissidents from BSK, the SK Velika Srbija on 1 August 1913. The First World War begin in 1914 and after the end, in 1918, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was formed, which was colloquially known as Yugoslavia, so the club changed its name to SK Jugoslavija as Velika Srbija meant Great Serbia, a name now obsolete as all the focus was going towards the new country. He was also the coach of Jugoslavija between 1923 and 1924.Srbislav Todoroviƒá: \\"Football in Serbia 1896 - 1918\\" , pag. 153 In 1926 he left Jugoslavija, however during the period he was at the club, Jugoslavija won two national championships and became one of the biggest clubs in the country.Srbislav Todoroviƒá: \\"Football in Serbia 1896 - 1918\\" , pag. 69 After leaving the direction board of Jugoslavija, he did not abandon football, but instead he was a directing member of many sports organizations staying attached to his passion, football, throughout the rest of his life. In 1951 he published a book ƒåika Daƒçine uspomene (ƒåika Daƒça's Memories). Despite mostly known as the founder of some of the major Serbian clubs in that period, he also had an active playing career as well. Initially teams in Serbia had one weak spot, the goalkeeper, because initially most players avoided playing in that harsh position. Stojanoviƒá started a career as goalkeeper at the club he was president, ≈†umadija, where he played from 1903 until 1906. Then he moved to the capital where he actually played as left-winger while with SK Soko where he stayed until 1910.

It was ordered in February 1968 and delivered in 1973. The ship's design, the Vosper Mk 7 is a modified version of the built for the Iranian Navy. The ship had an extensive refit in Italy by CNR Riva Trigoso 1979‚Äì1980 when new sensors and missiles were installed. During the refit, the ship was mined by unidentified swimmers. The vessel returned to service in 1983, but returned to Italy for repairs in 1984‚Äì1985 and 1989‚Äì1990. The frigate was reportedly scrapped in the late 1990s. Design and description Dat Assawari was a modified version of the Vosper Thornycroft Mark 7 design, based on the s constructed for the Iranian Navy. It was larger and had different armament than the Iranian ships. As built, Dat Assawari had a standard displacement of and at full load. The frigate measured long between perpendiculars and overall with a beam of and a draught of . The vessel was powered by a combined diesel or gas system composed of two Rolls- Royce Marine Olympus gas turbines turning two shafts rated at , giving the frigate a maximum speed of and two Paxman Ventura 16Y JACM diesel engines rated at .

Dat Assawari was initially armed with a triple Seacat surface-to-air missile launcher, a Mk 8 gun, a pair of single Bofors L/70 guns, an Oerlikon GDM-A turret mounting twin Oerlikon guns, and a Mk.10 Limbo Anti-submarine_mortar. The frigate's sensor suite comprised Plessey AWS-1 air-search radar, Decca 629 navigation radar, two Contraves Sea Hunter fire-control radars and Types 162, 170 and 174 sonar. =Modifications= During the 1979‚Äì1981 refit, Dat Assawaris armament and sensors were both modified. The Limbo mortar was removed, it's well plated over, and four single Mk I Otomat anti-ship missiles and two triple ASW torpedo tubes fitted in the space thus created. The Seacat launcher was replaced by a quadruple launcher for Aspide surface-to-air missiles. The complete sensor suite was replaced by Decca TM 1229 navigation radar, Selenia RAN-10S and RAN-12L/X air/surface search radars, two Italian fire-control radars (Selenia RTN-10X?), Thomson-CSF Diodon sonar and an Italian combat date information system (Albatros?) were installed. Construction and career Dat Assawari was ordered by Libya from Vosper Thornycroft in February 1968. The frigate was laid down on 27 September 1968 and launched on 13 October 1969. Following sea trials the ship performed work up training at Portland, United Kingdom. The ship sailed for Tripoli in 1973 and was commissioned on 1 February 1973. In 1979, the frigate underwent modernisation at CNR Riva Trigoso, Italy. On 29 October 1980, while undergoing modernisation, the vessel was rocked by an explosion. The vessel had been mined by swimmers suspected of being of French origin. Despite the setback, the vessel's modernisation was completed after sea trials in 1983. The following year, Dat Assawari returned to Italy to undergo engine repairs which were completed in 1985. By 1989, the vessel had returned to Italy again, in a partially disarmed and non- operational state.

On 2 March 2015, he was appointed commander of the armed forces loyal to the elected legislative body, the Libyan House of Representatives. Haftar was born in the Libyan city of Ajdabiya. He served in the Libyan army under Muammar Gaddafi, and took part in the coup that brought Gaddafi to power in 1969. He took part in the Libyan contingent against Israel in the Yom Kippur War of 1973. In 1987, he became a prisoner of war during the war against Chad after being lured into a trap and captured, which was then a major embarrassment for Gaddafi and represented a major blow to Gaddafi's ambitions in Chad. While being held prisoner, he and his fellow officers formed a group hoping to overthrow Gaddafi. He was released around 1990 in a deal with the United States government and spent nearly two decades living in the US in Langley, Virginia, and gained U.S. citizenship. In 1993, while living in the United States, he was convicted in absentia of crimes against the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and sentenced to death. Haftar held a senior position in the forces which overthrew Gaddafi in the 2011 Libyan Civil War. In 2014, he was commander of the Libyan Army when the General National Congress (GNC) refused to give up power in accordance with its term of office. Haftar launched a campaign against the GNC and its Islamic fundamentalist allies. His campaign allowed elections to take place to replace the GNC but then developed into a civil war. In 2017, Ramzi al-Shaeri, Vice-President of the Derna city council and lawyers Ryan Goodman and Alex Whiting accused Haftar of the war crime of ordering the killing of prisoners of war during the recapture of Derna. Haftar has been described as \\"Libya's most potent warlord\\", having fought \\"with and against nearly every significant faction\\" in Libya's conflicts, as having a \\"reputation for unrivalled military experience\\" and as governing \\"with an iron fist\\". Haftar is reportedly an anti-Islamist. In 2019, the Middle East Eye described the inclusion of Madkhali militias in the LNA led by Haftar as \\"ironic\\", given his anti-Islamist image. Early life and education Haftar was born in Ajdabiya around 1943, and is a member of the al-Farjani tribe. He studied at al-Huda School in Ajdabiya in 1957 and then moved to Derna to obtain his secondary education between 1961 and 1964. He joined the Benghazi Military University Academy (also known as Benghazi Royal Military College) on 16 September 1964 and graduated from there in 1966. In the late 1970s, he went on to receive military training in the Soviet Union, completing a special three-year degree for foreign officers sent to study in the USSR, at the M. V. Frunze Military Academy. Haftar later pursued further military training in Egypt. He was also stationed with the artillery corps. Early years in the Gaddafi government As a young army officer, Haftar took part in the coup that brought Muammar Gaddafi to power in 1969, assisting Gaddafi in the overthrow of Libya's King Idris. Shortly thereafter, Haftar became a top military officer for Gaddafi. He commanded Libyan troops supporting Egyptian troops entering Israeli-occupied Sinai in 1973. Like other members of the Free Unionist Officers (the junta that toppled the monarchy), Haftar is a secularist and was a Nasserist. He was a member of the Revolutionary Command Council which governed Libya in the immediate aftermath of the coup. Haftar later became Gaddafi's military chief of staff. In the late 1980s, Haftar commanded Libyan forces during the Chadian‚ÄìLibyan conflict, which ended in defeat for Libya. War with Chad By 1986, Haftar had attained the rank of colonel, and was then the chief officer in command of Gaddafi's military forces in Chad in the Chadian‚ÄìLibyan conflict. During the war, in which the Libyan forces were either captured or driven back across the border, Haftar and 600‚Äì700 of his men were captured as prisoners of war, and incarcerated in 1987 after their defeat in the Ouadi Doum air raid. Shortly after this disastrous battle, Gaddafi disavowed Haftar and the other Libyan prisoners of war who were captured by Chad. One possible contributing factor to Gaddafi's repudiation of Haftar and of other captured prisoners of war may have been the fact that Gaddafi had earlier signed an agreement to withdraw all Libyan forces from Chad, and Haftar's operations inside of Chad had been in violation of this agreement.M. Brecher & J. Wilkenfeld, A Study of Crisis, p. 92 Another possible reason given for Gaddafi's abandonment of Haftar was the potential that Haftar might return to Libya as a hero and thus pose a threat to Gaddafi's rule itself. In any event, Gaddafi's repudiation clearly served to embitter Haftar towards Gaddafi. In 1986 and 1987 the Government of Chad accused Libya of using toxic gas and napalm against central government forces and against rebel forces. Libya may have used mustard gas delivered in bombs by AN-26 aircraft in final phases of the war against Chad in September 1987. Opposition from the United States Gaddafi demanded Haftar's soldiers be returned to Libya, but the Americans arranged for them to fly to Zaire instead. There, half of his soldiers decided to return to Libya. In late 1987, Haftar and a group of officers aligned themselves with the National Front for the Salvation of Libya (NFSL), a U.S. supported opposition group. On 21 June 1988, he declared the establishment of the military wing of the NFSL, called the Libyan National Army under his leadership. When U.S. financial aid to Zaire was not forthcoming, Zaire expelled the remainder to Kenya. Kenya only provided temporary residence, and the CIA negotiated a settlement around 1990, enabling Haftar and 300 of his soldiers to move to the United States under the U.S. refugee programme. In fact, the end of the Cold War diminished Libya's geo-strategic relevance and the CIA funding program to Haftar's brigade was suspended. In March 1996, Haftar took part in a failed uprising against Gaddafi in the mountains of eastern Libya, before returning to the U.S. Haftar moved to suburban Virginia outside Washington, D.C., living in Falls Church until 2007. He then moved to Vienna, Virginia. From there, and mostly through his close contacts within the DIA / CIA, he consistently supported several attempts to topple and assassinate Gaddafi. He spelled his name \\"Hifter\\" in legal documents in the United States. Early role in the First Libyan Civil War In 2011, he returned to Libya to support the Libyan Revolution. In March, a military spokesperson announced that Haftar had been appointed commander of the military, but the National Transitional Council denied this. By April, Abdul Fatah Younis held the role of commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces, Omar El-Hariri was serving as Younis's Chief of Staff, and Haftar had assumed the third most senior position as the commander of ground forces with the rank of lieutenant general. Younis was assassinated later that summer. On 17 November 2011, Haftar was chosen as the overall commander of the new Libyan Army due to his military experience and loyalty to the revolution that overthrew Gaddafi. Launch of Operation Dignity In February 2014, Haftar appeared in a televised announcement to reveal that the General National Congress (GNC), the elected parliament which had recently unilaterally extended its mandate, had been dissolved. Haftar called for a caretaker government to oversee new elections, and urged Libyans to revolt against the GNC, the mandate of which was still in force at the time. Ultimately, his appeal did not lead to a general uprising due to the substantial lack of resources and local support for his initiative. His announcement was soon dismissed with great skepticism by the then acting Prime Minister Ali Zeidan. Haftar's actions were condemned as a \\"coup attempt\\" and \\"ridiculous\\". Haftar's strategy was to embark on a series of \\"town hall\\" meetings around Libya and, with the support of fellow ex-officers from the military, to secretly build an army. Three months later on 16 May in Operation Dignity, Haftar began a combined air and ground assault against the pro- Islamic militias of Benghazi, as well as a sustained heavy weapons attack against the Libyan parliament. At the time of the Benghazi assault, Haftar, who had already been the target of assassination attempts, reportedly explained to a friend that he was fully aware of the personal safety risks involved in his actions. On 20 May 2014, four days after the Benghazi assault, the GNC announced that it had finally scheduled the long postponed national elections that were to replace the then-interim legislature (the Tripoli-based GNC) with the Tobruk-based House of Representatives. These elections were scheduled for 25 June 2014. Later in May, after having been ousted from office by the GNC, Ali Zeidan endorsed Operation Dignity, as did 40 members of parliament, the heads of the navy and the air-force, and much of the army. On 4 June 2014, a suicide car bomber detonated his vehicle at Haftar's residence at Ghut al-Sultan near Abayar, east of Benghazi, killing 4 people and injuring at least 3 others. Haftar was not injured in the attack. In eastern Libya, Haftar's air and ground forces remained in place and seemed to be gaining general support. Over the course of May and June, numerous pro‚ÄìOperation Dignity marches were held throughout Libya, and in the 25 June parliamentary elections the secularists gained a clear mandate over and against the Islamist agenda. Meanwhile, despite its initial denouncement of Operation Dignity in May, Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thani's administration subsequently refrained from further official endorsement or denouncement of Haftar's Operation Dignity. However, the newly elected parliament branded Haftar's enemies \\"terrorists\\". On 24 November 2014 and the following day, warplanes affiliated with Operation Dignity forces attacked Mitiga International Airport in Tripoli, temporarily shutting down the airport, but also damaging nearby houses. In response to the attack on Mitiga, a court in Tripoli issued an arrest warrant for Khalifa Haftar. Leading role in the Second Libyan Civil War Haftar was officially made commander of the Libyan National Army (LNA) by the internationally recognized House of Representatives on 2 March 2015. The Libyan armed forces split up later in the year into the LNA under Haftar's control and the Libyan Army controlled by the Government of National Accord (GNA). After three years of military campaigns, in early July 2017 Haftar announced in a televised speech that his forces had finally taken full control of Benghazi, the second largest Libyan city. Haftar's military victory has been regarded by many as the expression of his growing military and political ambitions, and especially of his intention to secure military control over critical areas in eastern Libya. Some of his critics claimed that he deliberately dragged his militias through years of fighting against diverse groups which he framed as Islamist enemies in order to consolidate a future political role through his military leadership. Similarly, while some have celebrated Haftar's role in unifying and successfully leading the fight against the Islamic State, several sources have claimed that Haftar's role in the fighting of ISIS has been largely overstated or motivated by self-serving calculus. For instance, as of early 2016 Haftar's forces were reported to have bombed an Islamist group known as the Derna Mujahideen Shura Council who was behind the successful ouster of IS from Derna. Furthermore, experts have questioned whether the LNA could establish its control over the entire national territory, or whether Haftar would allow any military or elected political leader other than himself to guide a national army or government should that opportunity materialize in the future through a new general election. Haftar remains resolute that one of the aims of Operation Dignity is to completely dismantle the Libyan branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, as well as what he considers to be any other Islamist terrorist organizations within Libya. However, in recent years journalists and critics have observed that, in spite of his formal anti-Islamism mission, Haftar has continuously cooperated with Salafi organizations based in eastern Libya. His ties to these groups have produced a mutually beneficial partnership in the administration of the areas controlled by Haftar's forces as well as in the military fight against their Islamist counterpart, especially against the Muslim Brotherhood and Ansar al-Sharia. Some of the Salafi groups allied with Haftar were part of the militias based in Barqa that have fought under his leadership and eventually spread in Benghazi, Jabal al-Akhdar, and Ajdabiya. As Ahmed Salah Ali emphasized in his June 2017 report published by the Atlantic Council, Haftar needs the Salafi support due to his lack of troops and resources on the ground, while his Salafi allies have greatly benefited from their control over religious discourse and their growing military strength in eastern Libya, which have led to an increase in their appeal to unemployed youth. In July 2017 a video posted online featured the execution of 20 suspected ISIS fighters by Haftar's forces, and this led the United Nations to call for the LNA to investigate summary executions of prisoners. In general, in many areas under his control several sources have denounced the abuses perpetrated by his militias and the several repressive actions undertaken to limit civil liberties. As of August 2016, Haftar had refused to support the new United Nations Security Council endorsed Government of National Accord, which led the United States and allies to believe that he was jeopardizing the stability of Libya. Libya specialist and RUSI Senior Research Fellow Alison Pargeter pointed out that Haftar may plausibly be regarded as the \\"biggest single obstacle to peace in Libya\\" in that he allegedly fears that cooperating with the GNA may lead to the end of his influence in eastern Libya. The United Arab Emirates and Egypt continue to support Haftar. Middle East Eye has reported that British, French, U.S. and United Arab Emirates air forces have assisted Haftar's forces, after analysing leaked air traffic control recordings. According to the Guardian, Egypt's Sisi openly displays unequivocal support for Haftar bombarding Tripoli. He also receives private support by the leaders of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates for the assault on Tripoli. In November 2016, Haftar made a second trip to Russia to meet with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Defense Minister Sergey Shoygu. It was reported that while he was seeking weapons and Russia's backing, Russia was holding off pending the new Trump Administration. On 26 December, it was reported that Russia had thrown its weight behind Haftar, saying he must have a role in the leadership of Libya. Military situation in the Libyan Civil War in 2020. Russia has since then treated wounded LNA soldiers, printed Libyan dinars for the Tobruk-based government, and signed exclusive agreements that will allow the Russian government to establish two additional military bases in eastern Libya. Global risk experts Giorgio Cafiero and Daniel Wagner recently observed that \\"Moscow appears to view Haftar ‚Äì not the weak UN/Western-backed government ‚Äì as the only realistic bulwark against extremism in post-Gaddafi Libya.\\" In 2017, Ramzi al-Shaeri, Vice-President of the Derna city council and lawyers Ryan Goodman and Alex Whiting accused Haftar of war crimes in the recapture of Derna. They alleged that Haftar had been complicit in calling for extrajudicial killings, arguing that Haftar had called on LNA fighters to take no prisoners, and saying in a speech, \\"Never mind consideration of bringing a prisoner here. There is no prison here. The field is the field, end of the story\\". On 5 November 2017, a former commander in the ranks of Operation Dignity and its former spokesperson, Mohammed Hijazi, described Khalifa Haftar as being \\"the main cause of the crisis that is crippling the country.\\" Having left Operation Dignity in January 2016 citing corrupt leadership, Hijazi has since spoken out against Haftar, calling him a \\"tyrant\\" and describing \\"his killings, kidnappings, destruction, and forced disappearances.\\" As a former commander and spokesman for the Operation, Mohammed Hijazi claims to have knowledge that Haftar is deliberately delaying the war, specifically in Benghazi. Hijazi concluded the recent interview by stating that his life is in great danger \\"especially as he is in possession of formal documents that could damage Dignity Operation forces and their leaders.\\" On 4 April 2019, Haftar called on his military forces to advance on Tripoli, the capital of the internationally recognized government of Libya, in the 2019‚Äì20 Western Libya campaign This was met with reproach from United Nations Secretary General Ant√≥nio Guterres and the United Nations Security Council. On 7 April, eastern Libyan forces launched an airstrike on the southern part of Tripoli, the Bab al-Azizia military compound. On 21 April, Haftar launched several airstrikes and explosions were launched over Tripoli. The GNA and eyewitnesses alleged about the use of drones. They said that a plane circled around for over 10 minutes, before finally opening fire. In May 2019, Amnesty International accused Haftar of participating in actions that amounted to war crimes during his battle for control of Tripoli. Following the huge military setbacks in June 2019, when his forces failed to seize Tripoli, Haftar ordered the LNA to target Turkish ships and companies, ban flights and arrest Turkish nationals in the country. After making these threats against Turkey, six Turkish civilians were kidnapped on a ship in Libya by the Libyan National Army on 1 July. The Turkish foreign ministry commented on the kidnappings saying \\"We expect our citizens to be released immediately. Otherwise, Haftar elements will become legitimate targets\\". The United Arab Emirates killed 8 civilians and wounded 27 on 18 November 2019. Emirates forces carried a drone strike on factory that makes food products in Wadi al-Rabie, Libya, south of Tripoli, a Human Rights Watch investigation found. =Haftar government= Haftar was the effective head of the de facto \\"Tobruk\\" system of government of much of the east and some of the south and west parts of Libya during the Second Libyan Civil War. The 2019 Libyan local elections were prevented from taking place on 27 April 2019, during his leadership, in Sabratha and Sorman. The head of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL), Ghassan Salam√©, described Haftar in April 2019 as \\"not a great democrat\\" () and his methods of governance as \\"using an iron fist\\" (). During Haftar's Tobruk government, nine municipal councils out of 27 in total under the LNA's control were replaced by military administrators. The Government of National Accord in June 2019 captured weapon systems in Libya's rebel compound, which included Javelin anti-tank missiles made by the US and labelled for the \\"armed forces of the United Arab Emirates\\" inside a wooden crate packaging. The four Javelin anti- tank missiles holding a value of more than $170,000 each, were found in a rebel base, reinforcing the army of Gen. Hafter. On 27 April 2020, Haftar made a televised address where he declared that the LNA would accept a popular mandate to govern Eastern Libya, making Haftar the de-facto leader. Haftar‚Äôs announcement raised the question of the outcome of the Libyan House of Representatives, who up until Haftar's announcement was the governing civilian government for areas controlled by the LNA. Personal life Haftar has at least five sons and a daughter. Captain Saddam Haftar and Captain Khalid Haftar are officers in the Libyan National Army, while Al-Sadiq Haftar is also in Libya. Two other sons, Uqba Haftar, who works in real estate, and Al- Muntasir Haftar as well as his daughter Asma Haftar live in Virginia in the United States. Haftar is a dual Libyan-US citizen. On 12 April 2018, it was reported that Haftar was in a coma after suffering a stroke and was hospitalized under intensive care in Paris. A spokesman for the LNA initially denied the reports. Local media later reported he was dead, however sources close to him insisted he was alive. On 25 April, it was confirmed that Haftar was alive and had been returned to Benghazi following treatment in Paris. Besides his native Arabic, Haftar also speaks English, Italian and Russian, and is conversational in French.

Band (9 January 1957 ‚Äì 16 March 2009) was an astronomer who studied the theory of gamma-ray bursts.  Life  David Band was born January 9, 1957, in Boston, Massachusetts to a Jewish family. His father was Arnold Band, professor of Jewish and Hebrew literature at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and his mother was Ora Band, Hebrew teacher. After graduating from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Physics (1979), David continued as a graduate student in Physics at Harvard. He got his MA in 1980 and his Ph.D. Physics at Harvard in 1985 in the title of \\"Non-thermal Radiation Mechanisms and Processes in SS 433 and Active Galactic Nuclei\\", supervised by Prof. Jonathan Grindlay.  Scientific work  After he received his Ph.D. Dr. Band held postdoctoral positions at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, the University of California at Berkeley, and the Center for Astronomy and Space Sciences at the University of California, San Diego. He worked on the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) that was part of the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO), launched in 1991. He also proposed the functional form (termed the Band-function) for the description of the prompt spectra of the gamma-ray bursts. After the CGRO mission ended, Dr. Band moved to the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) where he worked mainly on classified research and continued to work on GRB energetics and spectra. When NASA planned two new follow-up missions to CGRO, the Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission and Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (formerly named Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST)) observatories, David Band seized an opportunity in 2001 to join the staff the Fermi Science Support Center at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC).

Plot S√©verine S√©rizy's recalls a mechanic's touching her when she'd been an eight-year-old girl on her way from her bedroom to that of her mother. Now, a young, beautiful housewife, S√©verine finds it difficult to fulfill her masochistic desires with her husband, Pierre S√©rizy. Although they love each other, physical intimacy is a problem, which frustrates them both. When Monsieur Husson mentions an acquaintance who works at a local brothel, S√©verine becomes curious about prostitution as a means of satisfying her desires. She uses the pseudonym \\"Belle de Jour\\" (Beauty of Day), as she works from two to five o'clock each day, returning to her unaware husband in the evening. S√©verine becomes entangled with one of her clients, Marcel, a young gangster. He provides her with the thrills and excitement of her fantasies. The situation becomes more complicated when S√©verine decides to leave the brothel, with Madame Ana√Øs's agreement, after Marcel becomes too demanding and jealous of her husband. Husson has also discovered her secret as a potential, though unwilling, client. After one of his associates tracks S√©verine to her home, Marcel visits her there and threatens to reveal her hidden identity, but S√©verine persuades him to leave. Husson visits Severine and assures her of his discretion, but she cannot believe him. She discovers Husson has arranged to meet Pierre in the square outside Notre Dame Cathedral; she hastily visits Marcel and asks him to kill Husson, which he agrees to do, out of love for her. Marcel and Severine are driven to the rendezvous point by Marcel's friend, and Marcel attacks Husson, but the job is botched: Pierre intervenes and is stabbed instead. Pierre survives, but he is left in a coma, from which he eventually awakes. Marcel is arrested, but he refuses to talk, thereby saving S√©verine's reputation. The police attribute the motive to the unidentified Belle de Jour, and S√©verine lives in terror of the eventual discovery, which is made almost certain by her maid's recognition of Marcel from his visit to their house. Pierre leaves the hospital, but he is paralyzed from the waist down. Even though S√©verine has been protected from the truth by Marcel's accomplice, Hipollyte, she ultimately decides to tell Pierre what happened..

In VR mode, users can create and rename titles for the scenes. Also, if a scene is deleted, the space allocated by it will be utilized later without the need of reformatting a disc. If the user would like to record on the same disc again at a later time, in VR mode, users may eject the disc and it will not be finalized by the recorder until it is manually initiated. For the sake of comparison, any DVD recorded in VR's competitor V mode (or Video mode) will be automatically finalized before it is ejected by the recorder. Disc finalization is still required if the disc formatted for VR mode will be played in another DVD player. Currently, users can only record in VR mode with the use of DVD-RW, DVD-RAM and DVD+RW discs, (updated in 2000 to accommodate DVD-R (General)) [DVD players marked ‚ÄúRW compatible‚Äù and ‚ÄúDVD Multi‚Äù can play DVD-VR recorded discs] and on some recorders, also on hard- disk drives. Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD also support VR mode-like features. DVD-VR & DVD+VR There are two quite different application formats commonly known as VR mode. 1) DVD-VR was established by the DVD Forum and can be found on DVD-RW and DVD- RAM 2) DVD+VR is the creation and responsibility of Philips Electronics and is seen on their DVD+RW recorders. =DVD-VR= The DVD-VR recording mode offers advanced editing (including Non Linear Editing (NLE)) but is not compatible with DVD-Video. Recorders do not edit the video data stream directly. Editing is achieved by creating a 'playlist' which references segments of the recorded video data stream and compile the playlist by chapters of the video stream or can access the video stream directly by time reference. Recorders generally employ one method or the other, but seldom both. DVD-VR can also be used with DVD+RW media, but recorders seldom do so. =DVD+VR= The DVD+VR recording mode (aka +VR functionality) is compatible with DVD-Video (normal DVD-Video players), but offers basic editing like partial overwriting, title dividing, chapter marker placement, replace the menu screens, etc. This can be accomplished easily on DVD+R media. DVD+VR can theoretically be used with DVD- RW media, but partial overwriting and replacement of menus cannot be so easily accomplished due to limitations of the media. In order to achieve this, it would be necessary for the recorder to read and store the entire contents of the disc, erase the disc and then rewrite it. For this reason alone, DVD+VR is seldom used with DVD-RW (or DVD-R) media.

Under the proposed legislative and constitutional refinements, it is envisaged that the Flags Act would remain on the statute books, to provide the construction sheet for the Australian National Flag which would be described in terms of its essential elements in the constitution, thereby settling the question of popular sovereignty in relation to the process for reviewing the design - in whole or in part - with a weighty body of legal opinion against the constitutionality of the current statutory rules in subsections 3(2) & (3),http://www.ausflag.com.au/government_accepts_advice.asphttp://www.ausflag.com.au/government_to_preserve_flag.asp which provide for an instant-runoff for choosing between the existing flag and one or more alternatives, on the basis of universal suffrage.

It was set up as Singapore's second law school in 2007, 50 years after the NUS Faculty of Law and 10 years before SUSS School of Law. Before becoming a law school, the school was a Law Department within the School of Business between 2000 and 2007. The school offers a four-year undergraduate single Bachelor of Laws (LLB) degree programme and a double degree programme combining the law degree programme with one of SMU's existing non-law programmes. The school also offers a graduate Juris Doctor (JD) programme as well as a Master of Laws (LLM) programme. The Dual LLM in Commercial Law, which confers LLM degrees from Queen Mary University of London and SMU, was launched in 2015. Admission to the law programme is competitive: in the 2015 University Admissions Exercise, both the 10th and 90th percentile had an Indicative Grade Profile (of Singapore-Cambridge GCE A-Level qualifications) of AAA/A; approximately 1,300 applicants were shortlisted for an interview and a written test. Since the launch of its international moots programme in 2011, the school has regularly featured in he championship final of the largest and most established international moot court competitions, and holds the world records for most number of international moot championship finals in a season and most number of international moot championships in a season. History PM Lee Hsien Loong at the Kwa Geok Choo Law Library during the official launch of the School of Law building in 2017 Inside the Kwa Geok Choo Law Library A segregated third of the function hall in the basement The School of Law was preceded by the Law Department, which was created in 2000 and part of the university's Lee Kong Chian School of Business, and headed by Professor Andrew Phang (now Judge of Appeal, Supreme Court of Singapore). A full-fledged law school was established in 2007‚Äîfifty years after the establishment of the first and then-only law school in Singapore, National University of Singapore Faculty of Law‚Äîfollowing a review by the government that concluded there was a shortage of qualified legal personnel in Singapore. The school's first dean was Professor Michael Furmston, a leading authority on contracts and commercial law in the Commonwealth. He headed the school from its inception in 2007 to 2012. Professor Yeo Tiong Min SC was then the dean from 2012 to 2017. Professor Goh Yihan has been the dean since 2017. On 18 March 2009, the Doctor of Jurisprudence (JD) programme was launched. In May 2010, the Continuing Legal Education programme (since re-branded as SMU Law Academy) was launched. In March 2013, the school became the first Asian law school to join the THEMIS network and in November that year a partnership was set up with Yonsei University for a dual JD programme. The Applied Research Centre for Intellectual Assets and the Law in Asia (ARCIALA), as well as the Centre for Cross-Border Commercial Law in Asia (CEBCLA), were launched in May 2015https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/education/steps-taken-to-stay- ahead-in-legal-sector and in June that year the school signed a sponsorship and training agreement with WongPartnership. In August, it launched a dual LLM with Queen Mary, University of London. The law school building relocated in December 2016 to Armenian Street and in October 2017, a Pro Bono Centre was launched. At the same time, the Singapore Academy of Law's Singapore International Dispute Resolution Academy (SIDRA) was launched, which subsequently came under the auspices of the law school in 2019.https://sbr.com.sg/hr-education/more-news/singapore-international- dispute-resolution-academy-transferred-sal-smu In June 2018, the school received a $4.5m grant from the National Research Foundation and IMDA to helm a research programme on AI and data use. In July that year it launched the LLM in Judicial Studies and in September the Centre for AI and Data Governance (CAIDG). In March 2020, the Centre for Computational Law was established after receiving a $15m grant from the NRF.https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/smu-to-create-a-working- programming-language-for-law-in-a-first-of-its-kind-research Former Judge of Appeal VK Rajah giving a speech at SMU School of Law in 2017.

Previously he has made 3 Super League appearances for the Salford Red Devils. As an amateur, he played second row, but has played mainly at prop in the professional game. Davidson signed for Salford's Academy from amateur club Blackbrook Royals, after previously playing for Wigan St Patrick's and Westhoughton Lions. He has international accolades at under 16 level, after playing in a test series against France Schoolboys in 2009. He made his first team d√©but for Salford in a Round 6 win over Hull Kingston Rovers in 2011's Super League XVI, on 18 March 2011, coming on for Ryan Boyle at prop in the first half. After a 1956 season which started with great promise, Alex played exclusively in the SL under 20s competition in which Salford City Reds topped the table at the end of the regular season. The demands of the, then, Head Coach and the interpretation of the contract rules led to that strong team succumbing to two successive losses and not gaining entry to the Grand Final. Nevertheless, a great year for Alex and his teammates. Alex spent the early weeks of 2013 at Leigh Centurions an arrangement which didn't really suit either party. On returning to Salford, he had, once again, to prove his worth and eventually did so with the success of the under 20s who eventually beat Featherstone Rovers 32-20 to become Grand Final winners. During the latter stages of the 2013 season, circumstances forced some younger players forward and among them, Alex appeared as substitute in the Super League matches against Huddersfield Giants (away) and Leeds Rhinos (home). Following a loan deal, Alex made his debut for Oldham on 2 February 2014 in a warm up match against Barrow, scoring the first try. Later in that season he was loaned to North Wales Crusaders, playing only 3 matches before an ankle injury ended his season. In May 2015 Alex signed with the Gloucestershire All Golds on a one-year deal. He has subsequently agreed terms to remain with the All Golds for 2016.

Joseph Gouge Greenwood Early life He was the son of the Rev. Joseph Greenwood, a congregationalist minister at Petersfield, Hampshire, and his wife Maria, whose maiden name was Gouge. At the age of fourteen he was sent to University College School, of which Thomas Hewitt Key and Henry Malden had recently been appointed joint head-masters. He then went to University College as a student, and in 1840 he graduated B.A. in the University of London, with honours in both classics and mathematics, gaining the university scholarship classics. In 1839 his father had died, leaving Greenwood responsible for a family of six younger children. For several years he supported himself and others by private tuition, and after a time as an assistant master in his old school; and he acted as substitute for Henry Malden in the Greek chair at University College. One of his earliest pupils was Edward Aldam Leatham, who dedicated to him his Charmione (1859). College principal In 1850, Greenwood accepted the offer of the chair of classics and history in the newly founded Owens College at Manchester. The college's early days were difficult, and in July 1857 Greenwood was appointed to the principalship on the resignation of Alexander John Scott. Greenwood continued to lecture, but soon after his appointment as professor the subject of history had been assigned to Richard Copley Christie; Latin and classical Greek were later transferred to separate professors; and during the last few years Greenwood retained only the teaching of Greek Testament criticism. In the earlier years of the College Greenwood advocated changes in the system of teaching, in order to recommend it to businessmen. In 1853 he helped in opening classes for the schoolmasters of primary schools; and having in 1858 become honorary secretary of a working-men's college on the same lines as that of the London college, opened a few years earlier under the influence of Frederick Denison Maurice, he was instrumental in bringing about its amalgamation, in 1861, with Owens College. Within the next few years the scientific teaching of Sir Henry Roscoe and his colleagues improved the college's reputation; for his part Greenwood had an ally in Alfred Neild, who during most of his principalship presided over the governing body. In 1867‚Äì71 a new chapter in the history of the college began with the movement for its extension, in which, with Thomas Ashton and others, Greenwood took a prominent part, leading to rebuilding on a new site and expansion. On the opening of the new college buildings in 1873 the principal delivered an address 'On some Relations of Culture to Practical Life'.Printed in 'Essays and Addresses by Professors and Lecturers of the Owens College,‚Äô 1874. In 1872 the Manchester Medical School was incorporated with Owens College, after negotiations in which Greenwood displayed tact; and two years later the new medical buildings of the college were opened. Victoria University Important events in the history of the college during the later years of Greenwood's official life were the admission of women students into the college and the foundation of the Victoria University. Greenwood opposed the higher education of women on the same lines as that of men, and objected (at all events as a rule) to joint or mixed classes; but the new Victoria University had opened its degrees to all comers without distinction of gender. Victoria University had a charter from 1880 with Owens College, however, remaining for four years its only college of the university. Greenwood became the first vice-chancellor, holding the office till 1886 for three successive periods of two years. His caution at times conflicted with the policy upheld by the majority of his colleagues; and when the Victoria University became federal in fact by the admission of Liverpool University College and Yorkshire College, Leeds, he guarded the interests of Owens College. Towards the close of 1889, in poor health, he resigned the principalship which he had held for thirty-seven years. Shortly afterwards he settled at Eastbourne, where he occupied himself with literary pursuits, including a revision of the text of William Wordsworth. He died at Eastbourne on 25 September 1894. In 1873 the university of Cambridge conferred on Greenwood the honorary degree of LL.D., and in 1884 the university of Edinburgh, on the occasion of its tercentenary, bestowed upon him a similar honour. Works His translation of the 'Pneumatics of Hero of Alexandria,‚Äô edited by Bennet Woodcroft, appeared in 1851. The plan of his 'Elements of Greek Grammar' (1857) was an attempt to supplement Hewitt Key's application of the 'crude-form system' to Latin grammar by completing Malden's fragmentary Greek grammar designed on the same principles. Family He was twice married: first, to Eliza, the daughter of John Taylor, a Unitarian minister in Manchester. They had two daughters, the elder was the historian Alice Drayton Greenwood. His second wife was Katharine, daughter of William Langton who was a Manchester banker.

In 2009, Mellor was awarded Man-of-the-Match in the Reserve Grand Final following a fantastic performance. An injury-plagued 2010 meant limited appearances in Wigan's junior teams, however, he did play in the Under-20 Cup Final win over St Helens. He made his Super League d√©but in rugby league whilst on loan at Harlequins in 2011's Super League XVI, coming off the bench in a 27-16 win over St. Helens in round five. On his return to Wigan, Joe Mellor was sent on loan to Widnes along with Dom Crosby and Logan Tomkins. Mellor featured at stand-off for the Chemics, scoring tries in the home fixtures against Barrow and Toulouse Olympique, and a brace away at Barrow. Mellor was once again loaned to Widnes in 2012, and joined the club on a permanent contract after being released by Wigan at the end of 2012. Since permanently joining the Vikings, Mellor has improved over his years at the club, being regarded as one of the best players in Super League. After the departure of captain Kevin Brown to Warrington Wolves at the end of 2016, Joe has been handed co- captaincy alongside Chris Houston, and has been given the number 6 jersey.

His fantastic works, full of strange details, particularly attracted Charles Baudelaire, Th√©ophile Gautier, Joris- Karl Huysmans, Robert de Montesquiou and Andr√© Breton. Odilon Redon was his pupil. Bresdin influenced contemporary artists like Jacques Moreau, George Rubel, Jean-Pierre Velly, and Philippe Mohlitz. Bresdin's life story and his art are both extraordinary and fascinating. He was one of the finest and most original exponents of the art of print-making in the nineteenth century and his name ranks alongside those of Whistler, Dor√© and Meryon in achievement and influence. Huysmans described in his beautifully written, arresting novel, 'Against Nature' (alternative translation, 'Against the Grain') how his aesthete hero, Des Esseintes, 'in search of the rarest perfumes of visual splendours', has just savoured the prints of Jan Luyken, 'an old Dutch engraver almost unknown in France' : \\"In the adjoining room, the vestibule, a larger apartment panelled with cedar wood the colour of a cigar box, were ranged in rows other engravings and drawings equally extraordinary. Bresdin's 'Comedy of Death' was one, where an impossible landscape bristling with trees, coppices and thickets taking the shape of demons and phantoms, swarming with birds having rat's heads and tails of vegetables, from a soil littered with human bones, vertebrae, ribs and skulls, spring willows, knotted and gnarled, surmounted by skeletons tossing their arms in unison and chanting a hymn of victory, while a Christ flies away to a sky dappled with little clouds; a hermit sits pondering, his head between his hands, in the recesses of a grotto; a beggar dies, worn out with privations, exhausted with hunger, stretched on his back, his feet extended towards a stagnant pool.\\" Another was 'the Good Samaritan' by the same artist, an immense pen and ink drawing lithographed, a wild entanglement of palms, service trees, oaks, growing all together in defiance of seasons and climates, an outburst of virgin forest, crammed with apes, owls and screech owls, cumbered with old stumps shapeless as roots of coral, a magic wood, pierced by a clearing dimly revealing far away, beyond a camel and the group of the Samaritan and the men who fell by the wayside, a river and behind it again a fairy-like city climbing to the horizon line, rising to meet a strange-looking sky, dotted with birds, woolly with rolling clouds, swelling as it were, with bales of vapour. You would have thought it the work of an early Italian master or a half-developed Albert D√ºrer, composed under the influence of opium.' ('Against the Grain', New York: Dover, 1971, p.59) Huysmans' description, although brilliantly conveying the mystique of Bresdin's work, does not fully do justice to the profundity of it. He only refers to two works, whereas Bresdin produced one hundred and forty etchings, twenty lithographs and a number of pen and ink drawings difficult to estimate. Bresdin was, in part, a product of the Breton countryside with its sagacious, bardic folklore traditions, later beloved of Gauguin and his circle, and in part a refugee from the Paris Bohemia of Henri Murger with its dolorous, witty intonations. His portrayals of the household interiors of the rural poor show uncanny empathy with their inhabitants and rapport with the imaginative hinterland of their psyches. His series of the Holy Family's flight to Egypt was highly praised by Redon, who thought it Bresdin's best work, and by de Montesquiou. His depictions of nature, showing its seductive charm alongside its underlying menace are unique and some time spent with these works can change one's whole way of seeing the natural world. Bresdin's life story is as dramatic and iconic as those of Van Gogh and Gauguin. It has the ingredients of a great Hollywood epic: childhood in the Breton countryside; a family row leaving him homeless in Paris and becoming part of the bohemian milieu with Charles Baudelaire, Henri Murger and Victor Hugo ; after the counter revolution walking 678 kilometres to Toulouse; living in the open air, workmen's and fishermen's huts; taking a wife and six children to Canada in pursuit of the dream of 'living off the land'; rescued and brought back to France by Hugo and the bohemian writers and artists; separation from the family and death in a garret room in S√®vres.

History Like other Dutch cities, Leiden required membership in the guilds in order to sell wares falling under those guilds. In the Middle Ages, Lucas van Leyden had kept a workshop that was more or less seen as a guild. Leiden in the Middle Ages was a small city in the Northern Netherlands, smaller than Gouda or Haarlem. Leiden seems to have not had a specific guild for painters prior to March 10, 1648, when Gerard Dou and Abraham Lambertsz van den Tempel signed a charter and founded the Leidse Sint Lucasgilde with his colleagues Gabriel Metsu, Jan Steen, Joris van Schooten, David Bailly and Pieter de Ring.See the RKD entries for these artists This collective was for trades connected to the art industry. After the change of governance that the siege of Leiden caused, Joris van Schooten issued his first proposal to the city council for a St. Luke Guild in 1609 and again in 1610. His petitions were refused for being too Catholic. Previously, the Leiden artists had been unified in the workshop of the Leiden councilman Isaac Nicolai. Later collectives were founded as a Leiden-based art academy along the lines of the Confrerie Pictura in The Hague. In 1694, Willem van Mieris, Carel de Moor and Jacob Toorenvliet began a true drawing academy with evening classes for artists where they could draw from live models.Website Ars Aemula Naturae Ars Aemula Naturae Guilds were disbanded during the French occupation, so the collective became a society and in 1799 the name changed to Ars Aemula Naturae, which still exists today. The society meets in an old building on Pieterskerkgracht 9 since 1859.

Introduced by the government of Margaret Thatcher, it was defeated in the House of Commons at its second reading: the last time that a government bill had fallen at that stage. The Shops Act 1950 regulated Sunday shopping hours, making it illegal for shops to sell most products on Sunday. The Auld Committee, chaired by Robin Auld, found that the regime established by the 1950 act was unworkable, with arbitrary exemptions and widespread breaches by large retailers. The consequent Auld Report recommended that the Shops Act 1950 be repealed, which the government accepted and adopted into its legislative programme. Thatcher had anticipated that the Labour Party would oppose the bill, spurred by trade unions fears that shopworkers would be forced to work on Sundays. However, she did not anticipate the backlash from social conservatives. 72 Conservative backbenchers defied a three line whip, voting against the bill at second reading ‚Äì just after midnight on the morning of 15 April 1986 ‚Äì and it was defeated by 14 votes. This occasion marks one of only four times Thatcher was defeated in the House of Commons, and the only time an entire government bill was defeated during her tenure.

Location Avatime Vane Lies 1,049 ft ( 319meters) on the contour above sea level. The town rests on a major and other minor hills, all which sit in a major valley shielded to the East by the great Gayi Escarpment-an ancient granite rock formation with very steep slopes and heights reaching up to 1,200 ft above sea level. Climate Like her other sister settlements with which she forms the Avatime Traditional area Avatime (Amedzofe, Avatime Biakpa, Avatime Dzogbefeme, Avatime Gbadzeme, Avatime Fume, and Avatime Dzokpe) Avatime Vane enjoys a serene and invigorating microclimate. The weather here, typically like the entire Avatime Traditional Area is exceptionally good, with mild breezes and beautiful cloud covers interspersed with sunny skies all day long. The rains normally start from the Eastern section of town (Nyanui) and are carried Westward by the winds. Avatime Vane's rainfall pattern largely falls within that of the forest belt of Ghana's. The rainy season starts in May/June and ends in Oct/November whilst the Dry Season begins in November and ends in April. Schools Educational infrastructure in Avatime Vane is good. The town boasts of Primary, Junior, and Senior High Schools. The antecedents to the present day school system in Avatime Vane dates back to the advent of the German Missionaries in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries who established Mission schools to prepare the people in line with the overall objectives of colonial education. Today, the overall school system in Avatime Vane boasts of over 1,000 pupils from class 1 to SHS 3. History and culture In the mid 1980s, the Rako Tree planting project was commenced giving rise to the planting of many tree seedlings. Today, Avatime can best be described as a \\"Garden Town\\" due to the green belt of trees which dot its natural topography. It therefore goes without being said that air quality in this town is of exceptional good quality. The chiefs and people of Avatim together with their kinsmen from the Avatime Traditional Area celebrate the AMU or Rice Festival through the week leading to, and on the first weekend in the month of November every year. This festival is celebrated in lieu of the agricultural activities forming the major economic activity of the people and rice cultivated as a staple. The cultivation of rice in a mountainous environment with a near temperate climate is a misery to many. Many people do not know that, the rice cultivated in Avatime Vane and its environs is a genetically different from the most prevalent rice varieties cultivated in Ghana. It is the peculiarity of this rice to Avatime that, gave rise to the Amu (Rice) Festival. Avatime Vane, being a town nestled between a series of mountainous peaks which culminated into the second highest peak in Ghana, is strategically positioned to be developed into a tourist hot bed. The development of a cable car network to link the various peaks will open up the magic of lush vegetative expanses never to be accessed from the ground to millions of tourists. This expanses are also interspersed with settlements and roads built along the contours of the mountain range forming a beauty of natural and human interdependence. A varied species of birds and butterflies not seen anywhere in the tropics can be viewed and photographed from the air. Hiking Hiking is another tourist activity that is unique to Avatime Vane. Although the terrain will not allow for biking, the traditional hunting and farming trails lead to magnificent caves and rock formation sites, creeks and waterfalls. This trails enables all to study the vegetative strata from the ground although in most instances, you can only see up to the canopy formed by the first layer of trees although the forests are three layered. Bird watching is also possible from the ground although better from the air.

Movements Inspired by Jyotirao Phule, he raised his voice against discrimination by upper castes. Eventually, he also established the Adi Hindu (\\"Original Hindu\\"), a social organisation, to bring awareness in the dalits. He formed a group called Jagan Mitra Mandali in 1906, which involved Dalits and Malas, and started telling stories by 'Hari Katha' (popular folklore).

It was officially launched in late 2008, with the first deployments announced by then Deputy Prime Minister of Australia and Minister for Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, Julia Gillard and then New South Wales counterpart, Verity Firth. The first deployment took place at Fairvale High School in August that year. Aim Through the program, the government would allocate A$2.4 billion over seven years to: * provide laptops to all public high school students in years 9‚Äì12 through the National Secondary School Computer Fund * deploy high speed broadband to all Australian schools and quality digital tools, resources and infrastructure that will help support the Australian Curriculum * support increase in information and communication technology (ICT) proficiency for teachers and students throughout Australia to nourish the use of ICT in teaching and learning * develop projects and research that will assist and support the use of ICT in learning * enable parents to participate in their child's education through online learning and access * support mechanisms that will provide assistance to schools in ICT deployment Deployment In September 2008, amidst uncertainty over extra costs involved with the computers, the Government of New South Wales rejected an offer for extra funding from the Commonwealth Government. The State Government requested additional funds to cover servicing, technical support, upgraded power supplies, software licensing, security and teacher training associated with installing the computers. After failing to secure assistance, the State Government then requested an extension to the 9 October deadline, for applications in the second round of funding. After being denied an extension, the State Government said it had been forced to refuse the offer until the extent of its financial crisis was clarified in the 2008 mini-budget. The Director-General for Education, Michael Coutts-Trotter, told The Sydney Morning Herald: \\"We can't commit at this stage until we can be sure the full cost of implementing the computers can be met. But we are enthusiastic about the program and as soon as the funding is sorted out, we will apply in the third round.\\" The Minister for Education and Training Verity Firth said she expected the State Government to resolve the funding issue ahead of the second round of funding. \\"NSW can't commit to any infrastructure ahead of the mini-budget,\\" said Firth, \\"It would be unfair to schools and students to seek new computers only to find that there was insufficient funding for their operating costs from the federal Government\\" . In November 2008, after negotiations with the Commonwealth Government at the Council of Australian Governments (COAG), then Premier of New South Wales Nathan Rees and the Government of New South Wales secured A$807 million to provide every year 9‚Äì12 public high school student with a laptop. The laptops, loaded with A$5,500 worth of programs from the latest Microsoft Office Suite and Adobe Suite, are provided by computer company, Lenovo under a four-year contract secured by the state government. On 26 August 2009 the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia and Minister for Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, Julia Gillard and New South Wales Minister for Education and Training, Verity Firth announced the delivery of the first laptops to secondary schools in New South Wales. Gillard and Firth visited a Year 9 class at Fairvale High School in Sydney's west to witness the integration of laptops into the lesson. In February 2010, the Queensland Department of Education, Training and Employment chief information officer David O'Hagan said that there was a possibility the iPad could complement laptops used in public high schools in Queensland, \\"When it [the iPad] becomes available in Australia, the [Queensland] Department of Education and Training will conduct an evaluation to determine its suitability for teaching and learning as well as network compatibility, schools eligible for computers under the federal government's National Secondary School Computer Fund also use this central purchasing arrangement to buy desktop and laptop computers.\\" he said. Apple is a member of the panel of computer suppliers for Queensland state (public) schools (primary and secondary). Laptops In New South Wales, students were issued with Lenovo laptops no bigger than a sheet of A4 paper. In 2009 the model issued was the IdeaPad S10e, in 2010, the ThinkPad Mini 10, in 2011, the ThinkPad Edge 11, in 2012 the ThinkPad X130e which was uniquely designed and in 2013, the ThinkPad X131e. The laptops also came with pre-installed software, such as Adobe CS5, Adobe LiveCycle ES2, Microsoft Office 2010, and Microsoft Forefront. In June 2010 a recall of laptop cases was issued after it was found that there was a flaw in the design of the case when several students reported that their screens had cracks. The New South Wales Department of Education and Training's chief information officer Stephen Wilson said that the filtering system on the laptops is impervious and no student will be able to break through the system. \\"Our internet filtering is unbreakable. We have a huge proxy array that does all the filtering. We've just brought that in-house and the reason we have done that is we want much tighter control over it, every internet site that's known is actually categorised. If it isn't known, it's blocked. If you go to a site and it's not categorised you can't get to it,\\" said Wilson. With the termination of federal government funding commitments, the New South Wales Department of Education and Communities has adopted a formal \\"Bring Your Own Device\\" policy approach to laptops and tablet devices. Criticism In 2008, letters were leaked that revealed that the Minister of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Julia Jane Gillard was told that the policy was not thought through and severely underfunded. There were concerns that the lack of funds would be compensated for by financially crippled families or some computers left in boxes, unopened. The states were noncompliant upon learning that each would have to contribute up to A$3 billion altogether, a contribution that was not mentioned by Rudd or Gillard in the election campaign. In 2010, the Rudd Government was again criticised for being too slow to deliver after it was confirmed that \\"none of the A$100 million budgeted to bring high-speed broadband to schools had been spent\\". Rudd blamed the delay in delivering broadband to schools on the global financial crisis, \\"In dealing with the challenges of the global recession, obviously some changes had to be made because of the impact on government finances,\\" he told Channel 10, \\"I accept that and take full responsibility for it.\\" In August that same year, only 220,000 of the 1 million promised laptops had been delivered. Further setbacks were due in part because of the government's focus on the A$43 billion National Broadband Network.

Three French properties are under the administration of the French Foreign Ministry which undertakes their management and maintenance. These consist of : * Longwood House * the small pavilion Briars * Valley of the Tomb These places are connected with the exile of Napoleon I in Saint Helena. They house a museum and displays on the life of the Emperor. Buildings have been restored as closely as possible to the state that they had in the Napoleonic period. They welcome from six to eight thousand visitors annually. The museum is financed by the Fondation Napol√©on and the buildings are maintained by the French Foreign Ministry. Since 2004, the French estate in Saint Helena have been administratively under the consulate of France in Cape Town. They are administered locally by a curator who is also honorary consul of France.  The detention of Napoleon I  Following his defeat at Waterloo, Napoleon was exiled and deported by the British to the island of Saint Helena, where he landed in 1815. Napoleon's arrival occasioned an increase of the population of the island: near soldiers and 500 sailors of the war flotilla, as well as the officials of the British government, accompanied by their families, not forgetting the small French colony which lived in the circle of acquaintances of Napoleon Ier. Furthermore, the British, being afraid of a landing of French sailors to free the prisoner as at Elba, claimed Ascension Island - up to then uninhabited - to establish a naval garrison there. Napoleon died on 5 May 1821. The next day, the governor of the island, Sir Hudson Lowe, although in perpetual conflict with his former prisoner, personally came to make sure of his death and declared then to his circle of acquaintances: He was England‚Äôs greatest enemy, and mine too, but I forgive him everything. On the death of a great man like him, we should feel only deep concern and regret. In accordance with his last wishes, Napoleon was interred on 9 May 1821 near a spring, in what was then known as the Valley of the Geranium, but has since been called the \\"Valley of the Tomb \\". On 27 May 1821, all the remaining French officials left the island. Nineteen years after Napoleon's death, King Louis-Philippe was able to obtain from the United Kingdom the return of remains of the ex- emperor. The exhumation of Napoleon's body took place on 15 October 1840; he was then repatriated to France and interred in the Invalides, in Paris. From 1854, the Emperor Napoleon III negotiated with the British government the purchase of Longwood House and of the valley of the Grave, which became French properties in 1858, under the name of \\"French Domains of Saint-Helena\\" and managed since by the French Foreign Ministry. The small pavilion Briars, the emperor's first house on the island, was added to the domain in 1959, when its last owner donated it to France.

The water is obtained from a spring near and cisterns in the village.\\"Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 92 References Bibliography * (p. 96) External links *Survey of Western Palestine, Map 2: IAA, Wikimedia commons *Kfar Dounine, Localiban Populated places in Nabatieh Governorate Bint Jbeil District Shia Muslim communities in Lebanon ","title":"Kafr Dunin"},{"id":"31228661","text":"B-value may refer to * B-factor in crystallography * constant b in Gutenberg‚ÄìRichter law * Acquisition parameter in diffusion MRI ","title":"B-value"},{"id":"31228666","title":"Electoral history of John Dingell"},{"id":"31228673","text":"Pepesuchus is an extinct genus of carnivorous metasuchian from the Late Cretaceous period. It is a peirosaurid which lived during the Campanian and Maastrichtian stages of the Late Cretaceous in what is now state of S√£o Paulo, Brazil.Pepesuchus at Fossilworks.org  Etymology  Pepesuchus was named by Diogenes A. Campos, Gustavo R. Oliveira, Rodrigo G. Figueiredo, Douglas Riff, Sergio A.K. Azevedo, Luciana B. Carvalho and Alexander W.A. Kellner in 2011 and the type species is Pepesuchus deiseae. The generic name honours Professor Jos√© Martin Su√°rez (known by his colleagues as \\"Pepe\\"), and \\"suchus\\", from Greek meaning crocodile. The specific name honours the paleontologist Deise Dias R√™go Henriques.Campos et al., 2011  Description  Pepesuchus is known from the holotype MN 7005-V, which consists of nearly complete skeleton and skull, and from the paratype MCT 1788-R, a nearly complete skull and lower jaw likely from the same locality of the holotype. The specimens were recovered from the Presidente Prudente Formation of the Bauru Group of the northern Paran√° Basin, between the cities of Pirapozinho and Presidente Prudente. In 2019, new fossil material from the Adamantina Formation was described.Geroto & Bertini, 2019 The skull of Pepesuchus is roughly triangular when viewed from above and is covered in small pits. The jaws are lined with many small pointed teeth. Like other sebecians, Pepesuchus has ziphodont teeth that are laterally compressed and serrated. 17 teeth are present in each maxilla, the most of any sebecian after Stolokrosuchus. There are also numerous dentary teeth in the lower jaw, with the foremost ones directed in a slight forward position. The snout of Pepesuchus is somewhat wider than those of other peirosaurids and has a slight upward curve.  Classification  Pepesuchus is united with the peirosaurids Peirosaurus, Lomasuchus, and Uberabasuchus on the basis of several shared characteristics. Among these features are five premaxillary teeth with the first two positioned close together and the oval-shaped cross- section of the jugal bone that makes up the lower temporal bar underneath the eye sockets. Pepesuchus also has a ridge on the maxillary shelf of the palate, a feature it shares with all members of the larger clade Sebecia (which includes peirosaurids and the related family Sebecidae).

The school closed in 1908 and re-opened in Valhalla, New York where it eventually became a girls-only boarding school. Highly regarded in its day, it was described in a contemporary travel guide as \\"a seat of Quaker learning\\".Williams (2006) p. 64; New York Central and Hudson River Railroad Company (1895) p. 86 The Institute's alumni included Mario Garc√≠a Menocal, who became the third president of Cuba; copper magnate William Cornell Greene; and songwriter Irving Caesar.Tucker (2009) p. 394; Harrison (1902) p. 141; Craig (1978) p. 149 History When the school was established in 1870, all post-eighth grade education in the area was provided by private academies, a practice which continued until the early 20th century. Although founded and run by a Hicksite Quaker Meeting which had moved to Chappaqua from Purchase, New York in the 1830s, the school was non-sectarian. Initially, it provided a four-year co-educational program which prepared students for college. Later, an elementary school was added and manual and commercial subjects were also taught as well as music and art. While most of its students were boarders, a fair number of children from the town attended as day students.Barbour (1995) p. 154; Williams (2006) p. 64 The Institute's first building, a large three storey structure with a basement and mansard roof, stood on of wooded grounds on the lower slope of Chappaqua Mountain facing Quaker Street. It was built mostly of wood, and in the early hours of February 21, 1885 a defective chimney caused a fire which completely destroyed the building. All 50 of the students and staff sleeping there that night got out of the building unharmed, including young Alfred Farragut, the nephew of Admiral David Farragut, who had a narrow escape. Finding themselves outside in the freezing snow, barefoot and dressed only in their pyjamas, Alfred and two of his friends had gone back to their room to retrieve their clothes, but became trapped there when the staircase caught fire. Eventually the boys used a clothes line to lower themselves from a third storey window.The account of the fire is from The New York Times (February 22, 1885). A new brick, stone and concrete building with an extra storey and two added wings was erected on the site in 1886 and served as the school's home until its closure.Westchester County Archives Public lectures were also held there, and in the summer of 1894 the school and its grounds served as the home for a conference of the seven North American Quaker Yearly Meetings with many of the 1200 delegates accommodated in tents on the lawns.New York Times (August 5, 1894) In 1906, Mary Nichols Cox became the school's first female principal. She had a PhD. in botany from Cornell University and was married to the architect and Quaker historian, John Cox Jr. When the school closed in 1908, she became the owner and principal of Grayrock Country Home School in Chappaqua, a co-educational boarding and day school for young children. A year after its closure, the Chappaqua Mountain Institute reopened in Valhalla, New York and by 1916 had become a girls-only boarding school.Sargent (1916) p. 173 The building and grounds of the former school in Chappaqua were bought by the Children's Aid Society in 1909 with a large donation from Elizabeth Milbank Anderson and became a convalescent home for children from New York City. The Elizabeth Milbank Anderson Home closed in 1967, although the Children's Aid Society continued to use the grounds as a summer camp. The building remained unoccupied for several years and was eventually demolished following a severe fire. Notes and references Sources *Barbour, Hugh (1995).

The battle marked the start of a United Nations- mandated military intervention in the conflict, with fighter jets from the French Air Force attacking and destroying several pro-Gaddafi units, forcing them to retreat. On 18 March, Gaddafi's forces bypassed Ajdabiya by using the coastal roads instead of the roads directly linked with Ajdabiya, avoiding the need to capture Ajdabiya to proceed. By night the loyalist troops had positioned themselves within kilometres of Benghazi's two southern entry points, the western southern gate being called the west gate.  Battle  = Initial assault on the city = Burned buses near Garyounis university, Benghazi, possibly of pro-Gaddafi forces, as a result of the ground battle. At 7:30am local time on 19 March, Gaddafi's forces began artillery shelling the city. At around 9:00am local time they entered the city from west and south with tanks. Rebel armoured units engaged the initial loyalist armoured column at around 10:00am Twelve T-72 tanks spearheaded the main thrust into the city, and by 10:30am, it seemed the Benghazi was in danger of falling to Pro Gaddafi forces. A rebel tank, aging and rusted, opened fire on the lead pro Gaddafi tank, damaging it and forced its occupants to abandon the vehicle. The tanks behind the lead vehicle all began a withdrawal from the area, under rebel fire, and retreated apparently to the city limits. By 2:30pm local time the opposition fighters had repelled the first wave of loyalist forces out of the city. During the daytime battles, a rebel MiG-23 crashed to the ground in the outskirts of Benghazi. The pilot, Colonel Mohammed Mbarak al-Okaili, remained in the plane until moments before the crash before ejecting but was reported not to have survived the crash. The cause of the crash was unclear, but may have been a catastrophic engine failure or friendly fire from rebel air- defences that had mistaken it for a loyalist plane. This prompted rebels to use loudspeakers, mainly from mosques, urging not to attack the planes. = France intervenes, loyalists retreat = At around 4:00pm local time, French fighter jets entered Libyan airspace and flew over Benghazi, conducting aerial reconnaissance missions and preparing to intervene. Then, at 4:45pm, coalition intervention began as a French fighter jet fired on and destroyed several loyalist armored vehicles. Later, Al Jazeera reported that French fighter jets had destroyed at least four of the regime's force's tanks; however, this was not confirmed by France. On the morning of the next day, air attacks were conducted against a loyalist tank column from 4:00am for two hours. It was confirmed by a Reuters reporter that at least seven tanks and two armored personnel carriers were destroyed in the French air strikes. Admiral Mullen of the United States announced on 20 March, that the international coalition had stopped the regime's progression on Benghazi.

The building is a brick and stone castle-like structure, and designed to be reminiscent of medieval military structures in Europe. It was built in 1891‚Äì95 and was designed in the Late Victorian style by William A. Mundell. The structure was originally built for the 14th Regiment of the New York State Militia. Since the 1980s, it has been in use as a women's homeless shelter. A veterans' museum and a YMCA sports facility are also located in the armory. The armory was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994, and was designated a New York City landmark in 1998.  History  = Planning = The 14th Regiment of the New York State Militia, organized in the 1840s, was the United States' most active state militia by the late 19th century. Nicknamed the \\"Fighting Fourteenth\\" and the \\"Red-Legged Devils\\", the 14th Regiment participated in numerous battles during the American Civil War. Concerns about the readiness of volunteer militia led to the passage of an \\"Armory Law\\" in 1862, during the Civil War, which called for the construction of armories statewide. However, the effort stagnated after the end of the war. The 14th Regiment moved to the Gothic-style Second Division/North Portland Avenue/State Arsenal in 1877‚Äì1878, whereupon the facility was renamed to \\"State Armory\\". The Second Division Armory, now demolished, was located at Auburn Place and North Portland Avenue in what is now Fort Greene. In 1890‚Äì1891, the 14th Regiment Armory Commission made plans for a new armory building in the present-day neighborhood of Park Slope, along Eighth Avenue between 14th and 15th Streets, near Prospect Park. The lot measured on Eighth Avenue and on the side streets. At the time, the site contained a few industrial buildings. On November 25, 1890, the commission decided to buy the site. The purchase was concluded on March 11, 1891, with the Kings County government paying the Nassau Land and Improvement Company a little over $79,000. William A. Mundell was the building's architect. = Construction and use as armory = alt= A budget appropriation of $300,000 was given for construction, though the lowest bid for completion of this work was $340,000. The commission asked for another $100,000 appropriation in early 1892. The Brooklyn Daily Eagle called the drastic cost increases as \\"a scandal of no common dimensions\\", and The New York Times described the armory as one of three Brooklyn armories facing extreme cost overruns, the others being the 13th Regiment Armory in Bedford‚ÄìStuyvesant and the 23rd Regiment Armory in Crown Heights. When the Commission asked for a third appropriation of $200,000 in 1893, members of the public filed lawsuits, alleging that individual counties might not have the authority to issue bonds to finance the armories' construction. Construction was delayed for a year and the total cost ended up being $650,000, over twice the original allocation. The cornerstone of the building was laid on December 6, 1894, when the building was nearly complete. The building was substantially complete on August 15, 1895. Twelve days later, the Fourteenth Regiment moved into the new armory building. In 1900, Horgan & Slattery added a new floor and added mezzanine pilings at a cost of $30,000. Six years later, further improvements to the interior were performed for $35,600. The doughboy memorial in front of the Eighth Avenue facade was installed in 1921-1922. In 1934, during the Great Depression, the 14th Regiment Armory and Manhattan's 369th Regiment Armory were used as temporary homeless shelters. = Conversion into sports complex and shelter = In March 1986, part of the armory became a 70-bed women's homeless shelter called the Park Slope Armory Homeless Shelter. The shelter, one of twenty planned by mayor Ed Koch to provide facilities for 7,000 homeless people, was controversial among residents of Park Slope, who feared that the opening of the shelter would result in an increase in crime. However, by the end of the year, the Times reported no significant increases in crime around the shelter, and that there had been no incidents involving homeless women and the schoolchildren at nearby 107. The armory continued to operate until the state's Division of Military and Naval Affairs took out most of the military presence in 1992. In 1993, the state announced that the National Guard unit at the 14th Regiment Armory would be relocated, but governor George Pataki allocated funds to keep the 8th Regiment and 14th Regiment Armories open. It was officially given to the city in April 1996. The following year, a lawyer who lived in the neighborhood started an unsuccessful campaign to close the shelter. The building received a major renovation in 2007. A sports complex operated by the Prospect Park YMCA opened within the armory in 2010.  Design  The 14th Regiment Armory consists of a two-story administration building with a flat roof, as well as an attached 1.5-story, barrel-vaulted drill shed to its west. The front facade, along Eighth Avenue, is flanked by a pair of towers 3 and 4 stories tall. See also: Upon the 13th, 14th, and 23rd Regiment Armories' completions in the mid-1890s, the New-York Tribune stated that \\"these three armories are the product of a lavish expenditure ... for the support and encouragement of the militia that has perhaps never been excelled.\\" The lot measures on Eighth Avenue and along 14th and 15th Streets. The building is set back slightly on its main (eastern) side, along Eighth Avenue. The intervening space is filled by a lawn, surrounded with a wrought iron fence. Both sections of the armory take up the entire 200-foot width between 14th and 15th Streets: the administration building takes up on the eastern portion of the site, while the drill room took up the area on the western part of the site. = Exterior = The central section of the Eighth Avenue facade, showing the four-story tower with rounded bartizan (left), the three-story tower (right), and the sally port (bottom) Both sections are constructed of brick, sit on a stone foundation of Warsaw bluestone, and include bluestone trim and details. On the facade, there are clusters of windows spaced at regular intervals, with between one and three round-arched windowpanes in each window cluster. Many of these window openings contain metal grilles above them. There is a rectangular, slightly protruding pavilion in the center of the administration building's Eighth Avenue facade, flanked by a pair of side pavilions containing five bays each. The first story of the central pavilion is faced with bluestone, and contains a large round-arched sally port on the first floor. A short flight of steps underneath the sally port lead to three recessed wooden doors at the entrance. The second floor, above the sally port, contains a slightly recessed balcony. Two asymmetrical towers, both containing a brick cornice with machicolation, are located beside the central pavilion. A four-story tower is located on the left (south) side of the central pavilion, and contains a bartizan or small turret projecting from the corner, while a three-story tower is located on the right (north) side of the central pavilion. The towers' first floors are also faced with bluestone. The 14th and 15th Street facades of the administration building include corner bastions; short projecting towers that roughly bisect this portion of the facade; and chimneys at either western corner. Each side contains nine architectural bays, and each bay contains one window on the second floor and two windows on the first floor. Counting from east to west, the short towers are located between the fifth and sixth bays on each side. These towers, as well as the corner bastions, contain one window on the second floor and three windows on the first floor. 15th Street facade of the drill shed, with sally port in foreground The facades of the drill shed that face 14th and 15th Streets contain shallow buttresses, with three round arches in each buttress. On each floor, there are windows only in the buttresses' central arches. Projecting sally port entrances are located on the eastern portions of the drill shed facades and contain rough-faced stone. The drill shed's western facade consists of two sections: a windowless wall on the first floor, and a slightly set-back vaulted upper portion. There are seven architectural bays on the top section, with the three central bays each containing a large arched window. = Interior = The administration building's first floor housed a double-story drill room; an office; the armorers', cadets', and drum corps' quarters; and rooms for each of the 14th Regiment's companies. The second floor contained rooms for the quartermaster, board of officers, and veterans; a gymnasium; various rooms for both non- commissioned and commissioned officers, including an officers' lounge; a surgeon room; officers' and ladies' restrooms; and a lecture & examination room. The third floor tower included a dining room and the superintendent's three-room residence. The drill room contains a gymnasium with a floor area of , which contains several bricked-up apertures from the second floor. A second set of restrooms, as well as a cue sports room and a bowling alley, were located in the basement under the drill shed. The basement also included an extensive multi-level shooting range, housed in one of the barrel-vaulted spaces. A tunnel led from the basement one block east to Prospect Park, but may have been cut off by the construction of the New York City Subway's Culver Line (carrying the ), which runs under the western border of Prospect Park. According to the National Register of Historic Places nomination for the Armory, the administration building's distinctive architectural features included an \\"imposing entrance hall and main corridors with wood floors, wainscotted and plaster walls, beamed ceilings sheathed with pressed metal, and chestnut display cases.\\" Some of the display cases still survive in the drill room. Other architectural features included Corinthian columns supporting the interior; wooden doors and ornamentation; and a Louis Comfort Tiffany stained-glass window in the main staircase, which was relocated to Staten Island in the late 1990s. Besides housing the 14th Regiment, the Armory had previously been used for training the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1955-1956 when their regular practice grounds were too wet for training. The space was also used to store balloons for at least one Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, and was used as a filming location for Goodfellas (1990), Donnie Brasco (1997), and Meet Joe Black (1998). Today, a veterans' museum is located within the armory, as well as the Prospect Park YMCA's sports facility. A large part of the armory is also used for a women's homeless shelter, which is operated by CAMBA, a non-profit organization based in Flatbush.  Sculpture  World War I Memorial outside the main entrance features The Doughboy by Anton Scaaf (1925) A bronze sculpture of a World War I \\"Doughboy\\" stands in front of the building. It is dedicated to 360 Fourteenth Regiment soldiers who died in World War I, was donated in 1921 by Gold Star families. The memorial was installed in 1922. The sculpture is located atop a granite pedestal with an inscription reading: \\"Dedicated to the Men of the 14th Infantry who were engaged in World War 1917‚Äì1918\\". The monument was restored in 1996.

Formed in 2008, they have had one full length album and three ep‚Äôs. Their debut album 'Death Hammer' was recorded in February 2012 at Foel Studio, Wales, with producer Chris Fielding. They are unsigned. In July, 2010, Flayed Disciple won Bloodstock Open Air's Metal 2 The Masses competition in Bournemouth. That won them a place on the New Blood Stage at Bloodstock Open Air Festival, in Derby. They were then invited back to Bloodstock Open Air to play on the bigger Sophie Lancaster stage in 2012. The band first met in 2008, and recorded the 'Drawn Viscera' EP in the summer of that year. The 2010 'Ejaculate While Killing' EP has been received in a positive way more often than not, and Flayed Disciple had a presence in the major music magazines such as Metal Hammer, Terrorizer Magazine and Zero Tolerance. Many live reviews can be found on the internet. The full-length album 'Death Hammer' was released on 28 May 2012 by Irish label Grindscene Records. There are many reviews online and in print. A 12\\" vinyl was recorded in March 2014, and released independently on Flayed Disciple's own label - Bethlam Records. Flayed Disciple are still active as of 2020.  Musical style and reception The music of Flayed Disciple is composed by every band member; the lyrics on 'Death Hammer' were written by Tolfree and Whyte. Their lyrical content has come up against some controversy in recent times, as the themes of serial killers, rape, murder, paedophilia and atheism feature in most songs. The musical style is heavily influenced by the early 80's thrash metal scene from the Bay Area of California. Bands such as Megadeth, Metallica and Slayer are the reason they started writing music. Recently, heavier bands such as Cannibal Corpse, Demolition Hammer, Napalm Death and Deicide have provided the influence they needed to go from a thrash band to a thrash/death crossover. It's worth noting that Flayed Disciple did not have a bass player for three years after former bassist (and original member) Nathan Bartley left the band in 2009 to become a full-time hippie. The bass parts on the Ejaculate While Killing EP were recorded by Lead Guitarist Thurston Howe. They recruited Welsh bass player Paul Williams at the end of 2011, completing the line up ready to record their first album. The touring for 'Death Hammer' took the band as far as India, playing at an open-air festival alongside French band Gojira. They also toured across Europe with Vader in January 2013.

It co-stars Susan Oliver and Red Buttons. Plot A young Hank Williams is trying to earn money by pitching a snake-oil cure-all to the gullible, capping his spiel by picking up his guitar and singing. In the crowd are the Drifting Cowboys, a group of touring country-western musicians who happen to be passing through. They invite Williams to join their group, and music history is made.

In 1956, it was announced the studio would make the movie with producer Joe Pasternak, employing Jeff Richards and June Allyson in the lead roles. Then Elvis Presley was considered as a possible star, to make his follow-up movie for MGM following Jailhouse Rock. However, Colonel Tom Parker refused. Paul Gregory became attached as producer and wanted Steve McQueen for the lead. MGM then offered the role to Nick Adams, but he turned it down as well. According to George Hamilton, MGM then \\"revised their concept of the film as quickie drive-in fare that might sell some records in the South and maybe to some crossover Beverly Hillbillies fans.\\"Hamilton p 180 They assigned their film to producer Sam Katzman who specialized in low budget fare. In November 1963 Standford Whitmore was writing The Hank Williams Story for Katzman. The film was made with the assistance of Williams' widow Audrey and featuring the songs (\\"Long Gone Lonesome Blues\\", \\"I Can‚Äôt Help It\\", and \\"Hey, Good Lookin‚Äô\\") lip-synched by Hamilton but sung by Hank Williams, Jr. =Casting= Parker was friendly with George Hamilton, who had been a fan of Williams' music since his youth, knew every song Williams had written and could also play the guitar. Hamilton was under contract to MGM but says the studio \\"didn't see their stock company preppy playboy playing a drug addict honky-tonk crooner\\". Parker introduced Hamilton to Hank Williams' ex-wife Audrey. The two got along well and Audrey lobbied on Hamilton's behalf. Hamilton said, \\"Audrey wanted the movie to happen, especially to make her son, Hank Williams Jr., a singing star the same way she had pushed Big Hank to stardom.\\" The idea was that Williams Jr would dub the singing in the movie and release the soundtrack album under his name; Hamilton wanted to perform the songs himself -- \\"that was the key to the character\\"‚Äîbut knew the only way he would get the part was to agree to be dubbed. With Audrey's support, Hamilton got the part, his signing being announced in November 1963. Paula Prentiss was at one stage attached as female star. =Filming= Filming started in April 1964. Hamilton says Sam Katzman ran a tight ship. \\"Jungle Sam cracked the whip, whacked the cane and the whole film was in the can right on time. But he gave me free rein creatively and our director... brought in something memorable, and even Sam knew it.\\"Hamilton p 182 The end scene (when the audience is notified that Williams has died while on the way there) portrays an actual event, as one audience member stands up unprompted and begins to sing \\"I Saw the Light\\". Others stand up quickly and join him, as the spotlight shines on the stage where Hank should be. This was similar to what actually happened after Williams died, as Hawkshaw Hawkins and several musicians began singing \\"I Saw the Light\\", and the crowd joined in, thinking at first that the announcement was an act, but when Hawkins and company began singing, the crowd realized it was no act. Release The film was originally released in 1964 in black and white, and has the distinction of being the final MGM musical film to be produced in black and white. According to Hamilton, \\"the movie made me a hero in the South, but because it was a small film, it didn't get the exposure it deserved in the rest of the country.\\"Hamilton p 183 Among the film's fans were Colonel Tom Parker and Hamilton's later girlfriends Lynda Bird Johnson and Alana Hamilton. The film was colorized by Turner Entertainment in 1990. The colorized version made its debut over SuperStation WTBS on January 1, 1991, the 38th anniversary of Hank Williams, Sr.'s death. Your Cheatin' Heart was released on DVD November 9, 2010, by Warner Archive as a MOD (Manufacture On Demand) disc via Amazon (Black and White version). The colorized version has never been released on any form of home media, but DVD- Rs of it frequently show up on websites specializing in bootlegs of rare movies.

It is both Mather and Saint Leger's feature directorial debuts. The film stars Guy Pearce, Maggie Grace, Vincent Regan, Joe Gilgun, Lennie James and Peter Stormare. The plot follows Snow (Pearce), a man framed for a crime he did not commit, who is offered his freedom in exchange for rescuing the President's daughter Emilie (Grace) from the orbital prison MS One, which has been taken over by its inmates, led by Alex (Regan) and his psychotic brother Hydell (Gilgun). Principal photography took place in Belgrade, Serbia. It premiered on 7 April 2012 at the Brussels International Festival of Fantasy Film, and was released on 13 April 2012 in North America and on 18 April 2012 in France. A French court has ruled the film plagiarises the plot of the cult classic Escape from New York and its sequel, Escape from L.A.. Plot In 2079, CIA operative Snow is arrested for murdering Colonel Frank Armstrong, who had uncovered evidence of a mole selling secrets about the United States space program. Secret Service director Scott Langral, on advice from the President, has Snow convicted of murder and espionage. Snow is sentenced to thirty years on the maximum security space penitentiary MS One, where prisoners are kept in stasis for the length of their sentence. Snow's friend and fellow agent Harry Shaw tries to locate Snow's contact Mace, who knows where Frank's briefcase containing the stolen secrets is hidden. Meanwhile, the President's daughter Emilie arrives on MS One to investigate claims that keeping prisoners in stasis can cause them to develop mental instability. The warden allows her to interview Hydell, a deranged prisoner. He manages to escape and releases all of the prisoners, starting a riot led by his brother Alex. Emilie is shot, and is captured along with others. Shaw convinces Langral and the President to send Snow to rescue Emilie, rather than risk her life in a siege. Snow is initially reluctant to go, but agrees after Shaw tells him that Mace is on MS One and could help Snow prove his innocence. Langral initially attempts to trick Alex into releasing Emilie, but it goes bad and Snow is forced to infiltrate MS One. Alex realizes that Emilie is the President's daughter and secures her, but she escapes with her bodyguard Hock and they hide in a secure room. A problem with the oxygen supply brings Hock to sacrifice his life by suicide in order to stop himself from using up oxygen so as to buy Emilie more time. Snow breaks into the secure room and rescues Emilie after administering first aid for her wounds. Snow then changes Emilie's hair & clothing to conceal her gender, allowing them to walk through the prison population without being noticed. They find Mace, but the stasis has given him dementia and made him incoherent. Snow and Emilie bring Mace with them and attempt to reach the escape pod. With no one at the helm, the prison falls out of orbit and crashes into the International Space Station. The collision causes a hull breach, killing Mace. Snow brings Emilie to the escape pod, but discovers it has only one seat. Realizing that he has been sent there to die, he sends Emilie on her way, but she allows the pod to launch without her because she believes the remaining hostages will be killed. Hydell contacts Emilie and threatens the hostages unless she reveals her location; after she does, however, he kills them anyway. Snow and Emilie discover evidence that the prisoners were being illegally used as test subjects. Alex finds and captures Emilie; he also shoots Snow, leaving him for dead. Alex learns that Hydell has killed all of the hostages; he contacts the President, threatening to let Hydell and the prisoners rape Emilie if they are not released. The President refuses to allow a siege and risk Emilie, causing Langral to temporarily relieve him of his command. Langral orders the destruction of MS One. Hydell tries to rape Emilie as promised, but is stopped by Alex. Hydell and Alex fight, resulting in Alex's death. Hydell then tries to stab Emilie, but Snow arrives and knocks him out. Snow and Emilie flee from Hydell and the remaining prisoners. Meanwhile, Langral's men plant a bomb on the prison. Snow and Emilie use space suits and jump from MS One as it detonates. Using their suits, Snow and Emilie re-enter Earth's atmosphere and land safely in New York City, where Snow is arrested. Emilie later realizes that Mace's incoherent rambling was actually a code revealing the location of Frank's briefcase. Examining the motel room where Frank was killed, Emilie realizes that Langral saw what he believed was Snow shooting Frank on a mirrored door which only showed part of what happened when in reality Snow was shooting at the actual assassin at the same time that Frank was shot. Snow gives the briefcase to Shaw, who unlocks it but is shocked to find it empty. Snow notes that he had not given Shaw the combination, and Shaw is revealed to be the mole and arrested. However, he believes that he will get off lightly as people like him are needed. Snow is released and his possessions returned, including a lighter given to him by Frank before his death. Examining the lighter, Snow finds a memory card containing the real secret information hidden inside. Emilie meets Snow and teases him after discovering his first name is Marion; the pair walk away together. Cast * Guy Pearce as Marion Snow: :A former government agent wrongly convicted of espionage against the United States. After meeting with him for the first time, the directors commented that he was too skinny, but Pearce promised that he would \\"buff up.\\" Pearce undertook a high-protein diet and weightlifting regimen to increase his muscle mass, as he believed it was important that Snow look like a serious action hero. * Maggie Grace as Emilie Warnock: :The daughter of the President of the United States. Grace intended to perform as many of her own stunts as possible, and was required to learn stunt, combat, and wire work before filming began. She was drawn to the role partly because of Besson, with whom she had worked twice previously, and because she saw the character as a \\"kick- ass\\" woman. Describing Emilie, Grace said she is a \\"capable young woman who knows how to negotiate her role as someone in a position of responsibility. She certainly has a strong world compass and she responds amazingly well under pressure. True, she's not exactly trained for the situation she finds herself in, but that's OK. There's still a strength about her in spite of that.\\" * Joe Gilgun as Hydell: :Alex's psychotic brother and fellow prisoner. * Vincent Regan as Alex: :A prisoner and leader of the prison revolt. * Lennie James as Harry Shaw: :A CIA officer. *Peter Stormare as Scott Langral: :The Chief of the Secret Service. Describing what drew him to the role, Stormare commented \\"the part was nice because it was like 'Wow, he's eluding me all the time. What is he up to? Is he really a bad guy or a good guy? What side is he on?' You never find out, which is kind of cool.\\" The cast also includes Jacky Ido as Hock, Emilie's bodyguard; Tim Plester as Mace, Snow's contact; Mark Tankersley as Barnes, the prison Warden; Anne-Solenne Hatte as Kathryn, Emilie's aide and friend; Peter Hudson as President Jeff Warnock, Emilie's father; and Miodrag Stevanovic as Frank Armstrong, a CIA agent. Development Principal photography was scheduled to begin on 7 September 2010, in the Serbian capital city Belgrade. Much of the filming used green screens, rather than practical sets. The intended scenes were storyboarded in Dublin, Ireland to aid the actors in visualizing how the green screen scenes would appear after the completion of the CGI in post-production. Speaking about the experience, Grace stated: \\"You just have to suspend the voice in your head because you feel so silly reacting to nothing there. Having whole conversations with people that aren't there. I felt a little crazy the first time around.\\" Luc Besson produced the film. Besson also co-wrote the script with James Mather and Stephen Saint Leger, the directors. FilmDistrict purchased the distribution rights to the film for a limited amount. In December 2011, FilmDistrict reached a deal to distribute its 2012 films including Lockout through Open Road Films for a fee. Release =Box office= The film grossed US$14,326,864 in the United States and Canada, and US$17,877,166 from other markets for a worldwide total gross of US$32,204,030. Lockout opened to US$6.23 million from 2,308 theaters in the United States and Canada‚Äîan average of US$2,700 per theater‚Äîmaking it the number 9 film for the weekend. Pre-release tracking of the film had estimated that its opening- weekend gross would be between US$6‚Äì8 million. The film drew a large male audience, with men making up 65% of those in attendance and an even split between those under and over the age of 25. =Critical response= Although Guy Pearce's role was generally well received, critical reaction for the film itself was mixed. On Metacritic the film has a score of 48 out of 100 from 32 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average\\" reviews. Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 38% approval rating based on reviews from 123 critics, with an average score of 5 out of 10, and the site's consensus reads: \\"Guy Pearce does the best he can with what he's given, but Lockout is ultimately too derivative and shallow to build on the many sci-fi thrillers it borrows from.\\" CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade moviegoers gave the film was a \\"B‚àí\\" on an A+ to F scale. Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a C grade, writing: \\"Lockout floats like space junk in the final frontier.\\" James Rocchi of BoxOffice magazine called the film: \\"A sleek, slick and shameless rip-off of John Carpenter's Snake Plissken films Escape from New York and Escape from L.A.\\" =Home media= Lockout was released on Blu-ray Disc and DVD on 17 July 2012. Legal action In 2015, director John Carpenter successfully sued the film's makers in the Tribunal de grande instance de Paris alleging Lockout plagiarized his films Escape from New York and Escape from L.A.. The court awarded him damages of ‚Ç¨20,000, Escape from New York screenwriter Nick Castle got ‚Ç¨10,000, and ‚Ç¨50,000 was given to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. After Besson's appeal was rejected in July 2016, the claimant's total damages were increased to ‚Ç¨450,000.

He was known to make searches for the library of Ivan the Terrible all throughout his life. He is considered to be the founder of the Urban exploration movement in Russia.  Biography  = Early years = Ignatius Stelletski was born on February 3, 1878 in a village in the territory of modern Ukraine. His mother was a secondary school teacher, and his father was a clergyman. He graduated from the Kiev Theological Academy in 1905, and within half a year he was teaching history and geography at the Russian-Arab Seminary in Nazareth. During this period of his life he visited Egypt, Turkey, and Syria, where he became interested in archaeology. This passion was so strong that in 1907 he left his job to settle in Moscow, where he entered the Moscow Archaeological Institute. In February 1912, Stelletskii organized the Commission for the Study of Underground Antiquities, which was built to study the tunnels of Moscow. Later in the 1910s, Stelletskii began searching for the Library of Ivan the Terrible, even though historians doubted the existence of the supposed library. He attempted to obtain permission to conduct excavations in the Moscow Kremlin; however, the Tsarist government did not allow him to. In 1914, while exploring the archives of P√§rnu, Estonia, Stelletskii found ‚ÄúDabelov‚Äôs Catalog of The Library of Ivan the Terrible.‚Äù Further studies were cut short because of World War I. =World War I and the Russian Civil War= In August 1914, Stelletskii returned to Moscow because of World War I. After the start of the Russian Civil War, Stelletskii became a Professor of the Ukrainian University, where he taught a course in Archaeology. =Work in Soviet Russia= In the fall of 1923, Stelletskii returned to Russia once again. He began to search for books on the underground of the Kremlin. In 1925, he once again asked the Soviet government to allow him to search the Kremlin for the library. Finally, in 1929, the Soviet government allowed him. On December 1, 1933, excavations began, and were carried out under Arsenalnaya towers. In December 1934, the excavations were discontinued because of Sergey Kirov‚Äôs assassination. Stelletskii also had plans to open a museum on the ‚ÄúUnderground Tunnels of Moscow.‚Äù =World War II= Stelletskii remained in Moscow during World War II. Despite suffering from hunger dystrophy, he prepared a manuscript of his book ‚ÄúDead in Moscow Cache‚Äù, which was published several years later, in 1993. It is believed that Stelletskii wanted to search the Kremlin yet again after the war was over, yet due to his health issues, he could not. =Death= Stelletskii died on November 1, 1949, and was buried in the Vagankovo Cemetery. His grave was lost after his burial, but in Spring 2010 a member of the Nekropolist society, (a Russian society composed of people interested in tombstones and notable dead people) found it, although it was in poor condition. Nearly a year later, the America-based internet group Nerdfighteria, which is led by Hank and John Green started a project to find out all information about Ivan the Terrible‚Äôs lost library, and stumbled upon Stelletskii in several newspapers, such as the New York Times and the Calgary Herald. John announced the project over his and Hank's YouTube channel on March 18, 2011.
