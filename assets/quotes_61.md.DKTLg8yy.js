The son of Carter and Peggy Thornton of Threave Main Stud farm in southern Bourbon County, Kentucky, Thornton grew up living a privileged life in the Lexington, Kentucky, area and attended the prestigious private Sayre School and the Iroquois Polo Club along with other Lexington blue bloods. He later transferred to Sewanee Military Academy and then joined the army as a paratrooper. After quitting the army, he became a Lexington police officer on the narcotics task force. He then attended the University of Kentucky Law School. During his tenure, he began smuggling. After resigning from the police in 1977, Thornton practiced law in Lexington. Four years later, he was among 25 men accused in Fresno, California, in a theft of weapons from the China Lake Naval Weapons Center and of conspiring to smuggle 1,000 pounds of marijuana into the United States. Thornton left California after pleading not guilty and was arrested as a fugitive in North Carolina, wearing a bulletproof vest and carrying a pistol. He pleaded no contest in Fresno to a misdemeanor drug charge and the felony charges were dropped. He was sentenced to six months in prison, fined $500, placed on probation for five years, and had his law license suspended. On a smuggling run from Colombia, having dumped packages of cocaine off near Blairsville, Georgia, Thornton and a partner jumped from his auto-piloted Cessna 404. In the September 11, 1985, jump, he was caught in his parachute and ended up in a free fall to the ground. His dead body was found in the driveway of Knoxville, Tennessee, resident Fred Myers. The plane crashed over away in Hayesville, North Carolina. At the time of his death Thornton was wearing a bulletproof vest and Gucci loafers, and in possession of night vision goggles, a green army duffel bag containing approximately 40 kilos (88 lbs.) of cocaine valued at $15 million, $4,500 in cash, six . gold Krugerrands, knives, and two pistols. Three months later, a dead black bear was found in the Chattahoochee National Forest that had apparently overdosed on cocaine dropped by Thornton. The story of Thornton was examined in Dominick Dunne's Power, Privilege, and Justice and in Sally Denton's The Bluegrass Conspiracy.Sally Denton, The Bluegrass Conspiracy: An Inside Story of Power Greed, Drugs and Murder, revised edition, Avon, 1990; Lincoln, NE: iUniverse, 2001. Robert L. Williams, Cowboys Caravan, looks into the death of his son David, and his skydiving relationship with Thornton. Thornton was also detailed in a Discovery Channel double-length episode of The FBI Files named \\"Dangerous Company\\" in 2003. His death also served as the inspiration for the story arc of season four of FX Network's Justified.https://ew.com/article/2013/01/08/justified- season-4-premiere-postmortem-graham-yost/ The beginning of episode one features a flashback to 1983 in which a male falls to his death, parachute still attached, with bricks of cocaine scattered around his body. The bag that had carried the cocaine becomes the focus of a mystery roughly 30 years later. Known associates *Frank Barclay, former smuggling partner *Harold Brown, DEA agent *Bradley F.

Yudnamutana ( ) is an historic mining valley in the Northern Flinders Ranges, located at Mount Freeling, North West of Arkaroola on the edge of the wilderness sanctuary. It is accessible by four-wheel drive from the south. Ancient mining sites give the opportunity for ecologically responsible bush camping, but no supplies are available. Walks across the crests of the mountains deliver splendid views over the Flinders Ranges into the plains of the outback. The northern pass hosts black rocks of magnetite. History=Indigenous people This area was inhabited by the Adnyamathanha tribe, of Indigenous Australians prior to Europeans. They were Stone Age hunter-gatherers and inhabited much of the area to the south.  European settlement  This area was first settled by pastoralists in the 1850s but prospectors followed shortly after, hoping for another Burra style deposit. A copper deposit was found, in 1859, by A Frost and H Gleeson.Yudnamutana, South Australia Journal of the Mineralogical Society of South Australia, Accessed 16/11/07 Record of the mines of South Australia Internet Archive, Canadian Libraries Yudnamutana was the site of an early South Australia copper mine. First mined in 1862, it reached fame in Adelaide shortly after when a four tonne block of ore was paraded through the streets. A drought in 1869 forced the closure of the mine because not enough water was available for animals used for transport at the mine. Another attempt was made at mining the site at the start of the 20th century, though this also closed by 1912. Transport was easier this time but ore still had to be drayed to the train line at Farina, 100 km away. All that remains of this settlement are two large boilers, some mine shafts, some dugouts and the cemetery.

The work was a collaboration between Carl Linnaeus and Georg Dionysius Ehret, financed by George Clifford in 1735-1736. Clifford, a wealthy Amsterdam banker was a keen botanist with a large herbarium and governor of the Dutch East India Company. He had the income to attract the talents of botanists such as Linnaeus and artists like Ehret and Jan Wandelaar. Together at the Clifford summer estate Hartecamp, which was located south of Haarlem in Heemstede near Bennebroek, they produced the first scholarly classification of an English garden. The garden at Hartekamp was already quite famous before George Clifford bought the place in 1709. Under his ownership, the number of unusual plants grew exponentially. He had 4 hothouses built to house the many tropical plants that he collected through his business connections from all over the world. He was an important friend and seed supplier for botanist Herman Boerhaave, whose summer home (and garden) at Oud Poelgeest was just a short trip away by trekschuit along the Haarlem-Leiden canal known as the Leidsevaart. In 1736 George Clifford became famous for growing the first indoor banana tree, and for this reason Carl Linnaeus was eager to work with him. George Clifford died in 1760 and left the business and property to his sons. The banking house of Clifford under George Clifford Jr. fell in 1772 and the estate Hartekamp went out of the family in 1788. Since then the garden has declined and is currently used as a school campus. After the fall of Clifford & Zn., Clifford's herbarium was acquired by Joseph Banks in 1791 who passed it on to the British Museum of Natural History, where it is published online.

The film examines the interaction between youth cultural movements during the late 1970s in the UK ‚Äî namely skinheads, punks, and soulboys ‚Äî along with the social, political, and cultural tensions between them. The film was released in the United Kingdom on 9 August 1991, followed by a North American release on 6 December 1991. The film was the feature film acting debut of Sophie Okonedo and Eamonn Walker.\\"Young Soul Rebels (1991)\\", Isaac Julien. Plot The film revolves around various plots. The central story-line is about a murder investigation involving one of the central characters Chris (Valentine Nonyela) and his relationship with his girlfriend Tracy (Sophie Okonedo). The second narrative involves the relationship between a gay punk Billibud (Jason Durr) and a soulboy Caz (Mo Sesay) and the racism and homophobia they face in both West Indian and white British communities. The film is a love story that can be seen as an allegory for racial and class solidarity, as their love transcends class and race barriers. Set in London in 1977, the plot takes place against the background of the Queen's Silver Jubilee. The film begins as buddy movie between two friends, Chris and Caz, who run a pirate radio station from a tower block in Dalston, East London. The film starts with the murder of their friend TJ while cruising for sex in the local park at night. While Caz is distraught by the death of his friend, Chris seems focused on balancing a professional career in commercial radio without selling out. They both want to promote soul music while the prevailing popular music is punk. The murder and the different paths they diverge on causes tension between buddies Chris and Caz. Chris discovers that he has a tape recording of the murder but fails to hand it in as evidence. He is then pulled in by the police as a suspect because he was in possession of TJ's cassette radio. He tries to call Caz but Caz is busy with his new boyfriend, Billibud, who is a punk that espouses the views of the Socialist Workers Party while wearing (admittedly stolen) Vivienne Westwood designer T-shirts. The character Billiibud gets his name from the fictional character \\"Billy Budd\\" from Herman Melville's novel \\"Billy Budd, Sailor\\". In this novel Billy Budd is described as \\"renowned for his good looks and gentle, innocent ways\\". Similarly, in the film Billibud is known for being good looking. However, in Melville's novel the character is also known for being on the less intelligent and gullible side, as seen for his \\"inability to perceive ill will in other people\\" and has an \\"unpredictable tendency to stutter\\". In comparison, in the film Billibud is also portrayed as somewhat dimwitted. Chris and Caz then have a showdown on the roof of the tower block and Chris nearly falls off the roof. He then meets Tracy and she persuades him to send the tape to the police, but not before he has made a copy. They then make love on a rooftop. On the day of the Silver Jubilee celebrations Caz and Billibud go to the street fair, where Billibud is attacked by local skinheads. Caz and Billibud return home and make love. That evening Chris goes to the radio station but Caz is not there and the studio has been vandalised. He starts broadcasting \\"Funk the Jubilee\\" but feels is not the same without his partner, Caz. Chris is then attacked by TJ's murderer, who turns out to be someone he and Caz had thought of as a friend. He escapes but cannot find Caz. A grand reckoning takes place at an open-air disco in the park where TJ was murdered. While Caz and Billibud are MCing, Chris attempts to warn them about the revelations regarding TJ's murderer. A Molotov cocktail is thrown onto the stage and Caz and Billibud begin trying to save the vinyl records. Chris puts on the tape of TJ's murder, but doing so requires going onto the stage. TJ's murderer, a member of the National Front, follows Chris on stage, whereupon he falls to his death in the inferno of his own creation. The scene is a bitter-sweet microcosm of the racial and sexual tensions of 1970s Britain, with skinheads hassling Chris and Caz, whites making snide remarks about how things have changed since their youth, and blacks stating that they are unable to decide if they hate whites, mixed-race people or \\"batty boys\\" most. Yet, despite all of this, youth in the clubs are enjoying the music, drinking, dancing and bonking inter-racially while paying no mind to the gay men around them. The film ends with the two DJ buddies reconciling their differences while they clean records, which is followed by a one-by-one each of the friends joining into dance together.  Themes = Race and Sexuality  The movie explores various issues surrounding race and sexuality. The film opens with the murder of a Black gay man named TJ, which illustrates how Black people, especially those that are a part of the LGBTQIA+ community, are disproportionately affected by violence. As the film progresses, various scenes illustrate how racism and homophobia affect the different characters. Both Chris and Caz experience racism, but Caz also experiences homophobia, and in one scene in particular Black gay men are excluded from certain gay spaces.  Criminalization and Police  Another theme present in the film is the criminalization of Black people. In one particular scene, Chris, one of the main characters, is taken into police custody. The police are seen to be threatening and do not explain what exactly they are taking him in for or charging him with. They ask him unimportant questions, such as what kind of socks he‚Äôs wearing, seemingly for the sole purpose of intimidating him. This illustrates the dangerous and often deadly interactions that Black people have with the police, and how Black people have historically been, and still are, criminalized.

They originated in Mississippi and Louisiana in the early 1960s under the leadership of Samuel Bowers, its first Grand Wizard. The White Knights of Mississippi were formed in 1964, and they included roughly 200 members of the Original Knights of Louisiana. The White Knights were not interested in holding public demonstrations or in letting any information about themselves get out to the masses. Similar to the United Klans of America (UKA), the White Knights of Mississippi were very secretive about their group. Within a year, their membership was up to around six thousand, and they had Klaverns in over half of the counties in Mississippi. By 1967, the number of active members had shrunk to around four hundred. Murder of civil rights activists The White Knights were responsible for many bombings, church burnings, beatings, and murders. In 1964, they murdered three civil rights workers: Andrew Goodman, James Chaney, and Michael Schwerner (as later depicted in the 1988 film Mississippi Burning, loosely based on these events). The victims were members of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE). White Knight member Samuel Bowers had targeted Schwerner because of the civil rights worker's efforts to promote racial equality and to get Blacks to register to vote during Freedom Summer. In his first attempt to kill Schwerner, Bowers assembled 30 White Knights on the evening of Memorial Day 1964 and surrounded the Mount Zion Church while a meeting was taking place inside. Bowers thought Schwerner would be in attendance, but after failing to find him when the meeting let out, the Knights started beating the blacks who were present, then set the church on fire after pouring gasoline inside. Schwerner had been in Ohio at the time working on helping the National Council of Churches find more students to help with the Freedom Summer project. When he found out about the church burning, he decided to drive back to Mississippi. Accompanying him were 21-year-old James Chaney, a black man, and Andrew Goodman. They were heading to Longdale in Neshoba County, where the sheriff, Lawrence Rainey, and his deputy, Cecil Price, were members of the Klan, although the Klansmen never publicly announced it. When the three activists got to Neshoba County, Price saw their car driving down the highway and pulled them over on the premise of possible involvement in the burning of Mount Zion Church. They were locked up, denied their right to make phone calls, and kept there, while Price worked out the details of their murder with a White Knight member, Edgar Ray Killen aka \\"The Preacher\\". Hours later, Price released them but followed them from behind in his car. The trio knew they were being followed, and they eventually stopped their car, at which point Price ordered them into his vehicle. Two cars of Klansmen pulled up, and all three activists were shot at close range. Their bodies were placed together in a hollow at a dam site on a farm belonging to trucking company owner Olen Burrage and then covered with tons of dirt using a Caterpillar D4, most likely by heavy machinery operator Herman Tucker. It was months before any indictments were made. Rainey and Price were indicted in 1965, but not until 1967, when 18 members of the White Knights who were also involved in the crime were indicted. Six men were convicted, including Sam Bowers and Deputy Price. Seven men were found not guilty, and one was acquitted of all charges. Bowers and Wayne Roberts (who shot the gun) each received the longest prison sentences, 10 years. Among those indicted was Edgar Ray Killen, who was saved from conviction only because one of the jurors flatly refused to convict a man who she knew was a preacher. However, Killen was eventually convicted of the murders in June 2005, 40 years after the fact; at age 79 he was sentenced to \\"three 20-year terms, one for each conviction of manslaughter in connection with the deaths of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner in 1964.\\" Current White Knights Status Ku Klux Klan activity in Mississippi, and specific White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan activity, did not stop after the Civil Rights era. In 2017, six different Klan organizations have been publicly identified in Mississippi, with three of those identified as White Knights organizations. In 1989, The White Knights of Mississippi attempted to go national by appointing professional wrestler Johnny Lee Clary, whose stage name was \\"Johnny Angel\\", as its new Imperial Wizard to succeed the retiring Samuel Bowers. Clary appeared on many talk shows, including The Oprah Winfrey Show and The Morton Downey, Jr. Show, in an effort to build a new, modern image for the Ku Klux Klan. It was thought that Clary could build membership in the Klan due to his celebrity status as a professional wrestler. Clary tried to unify the various chapters of the Klan in a meeting held in the birthplace of the Ku Klux Klan, Pulaski, Tennessee, only to have it fall apart because of infighting which occurred when the Klan's various chapters came together. Clary's girlfriend was revealed to be an F.B.I. informant, which resulted in distrust of Clary among members of the different Klan chapters. Clary resigned from the Klan and later became a born-again Christian and a civil rights activist. With the conviction of Killen in 2005, an earlier chapter of the White Knights of Mississippi came to a close. Price died in 2001; Wayne Roberts is also deceased.

History  The chapel c.1930s The Chapel of St. Mary and St. George was built during the headmastership of Canon Percy Umphreyville Henn, who sought funds for its construction immediately after his appointment in 1909. He found a generous benefactor in Englishman Cecil Oliverson who paid for the full cost of the building. Articles about the gift of the Guildford Grammar School Chapel in the Midland newspaper the Swan Express - Mar. 1912: Announcement of the gift of the Chapel.Swan express, 22 March 1912, p.6e) It was consecrated in 1914.( Swan express, 27 March 1914, p. 5a-b) - Mar. 1914: Consecration of the Chapel. It was constructed from Donnybrook stone with interior woodwork of English Oak. He also donated the large gold-leaf rerados above the altar. During the second World War Guildford Grammar School was commandeered by the United States Navy for use as a hospital. During their three months' occupation the students were evacuated to Fairbridge, near Pinjarra. The Navy painted two red crosses on the Chapel roof, one on each side of the slope. When the school population resumed residence in 1943 the Australian Army offered to replace the painted tiles but school authorities decided that it would be better to paint over the crosses with tile-coloured paint. Today that paint has almost worn off so once again the crosses are visible as a sign of GGS's contribution to the war. The 1968 Meckering earthquake damaged the central bell tower on the roof - and other damage occurred at that time as well. A bible, gifted to the school by King George V of England, was destroyed in a fire in the sacristy fire in 1980. Queen Elizabeth II provided a replacement.  Services  During the school's academic year the chapel is in daily use for services and congregational singing practices for the students. Boarders and some members of the school community attend the Sunday services. Marriages are celebrated almost every week while Baptisms, Introductions to Holy Communion and Confirmations are held fairly frequently. Funerals occur rarely. Special services are arranged to celebrate such events as Palm Sunday, Easter and Christmas.Guildford Grammar School Anglican Ethos (accessed 1 March 2007) Architectural value Guildford Grammar School's Chapel is one of the three latest Revival styles in Australia - the Gothic Perpendicular Revival.Andrews, Brian (2001) Australian Gothic : the Gothic revival in Australian architecture from the 1840s to the 1950s Carlton, Vic.

Many skilled tradesmen helped in the completion of the building, including some who were employed from the United Kingdom.

In 2010, he was captured and executed by the Iranian government. Early life and education Born in 1979, Abdolmalek Rigi was from the Rigi tribe who are ethnic Baloch. Prior to founding Jundallah, while a teenager, Rigi was convicted of assault with a knife, for which he served time in prison. Although lacking any formal secular education, Rigi had been educated at Karachi's Binnori Town seminary, a Sunni Madrasah which was school to many of the Taliban leaders. Alleged activities Starting in 2007, there has been considerable controversy over their support and international ties. Jundallah is believed by many experts to be linked to Al-Qaeda. There are also claims that Jundallah has had contact with the U.S. government and receives funding from Baluchi Iranians abroad.Car bomb in Iran destroys a bus carrying Revolutionary Guards The New York Times Dan Rather's U.S. cable channel HDnet's television news magazine Dan Rather Reports, interviewed Rigi and showed a video of Rigi personally cutting off his brother in-law Shahab Mansouri's head. In the same interview, Rigi described himself as \\"an Iranian\\" and denied that his goal was to form a separate Baluch state. He claimed that his goal was to \\"improve conditions for ethnic Baluchis\\", and that his group was \\"fighting exclusively for the rights of Sunni Muslims in Iran\\".HDNet Original Programming - Transcripts HDNet Original Programming - Dan Rather Reports According to a former hostage , Rigi never slept in one place for two consecutive nights and did not shake hands with other people without wearing gloves. He was also reported to emulate Al-Zarqawi in his conduct and videos of hostage executions. The Iranian newspaper Kayhan incorrectly reported on 7 April 2005 that Rigi had been killed in an operation on the border to Afghanistan. A video surfaced on 11 April 2005, showing Rigi alive. Rigi's brother Abdulhamid Rigi accused his brother of working with Americans against Iran. Iranian authorities claimed that Rigi had murdered an Iranian general and carried out terrorist attacks in Iran. These allegations led to his arrest in February 2010. 2010 arrest There are two conflicting versions of Rigi's arrest. According to the Iranian government, on 23 February 2010, Rigi was aboard a flight from Dubai, United Arab Emirates to Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, travelling with a forged Afghan passport. When the plane was crossing the Persian Gulf, Iranian fighter jets intercepted it. The Iranian jets ordered the pilot to land in Iranian territory and \\"a number of foreign passengers were forcibly removed.\\" When the plane landed at Bandar Abbas International Airport, Iranian forces identified Rigi and arrested him. After his arrest, Iranian TV showed Rigi, with hands tied, being escorted by four masked Iranian commandos. According to a former U.S. intelligence officer, on the other hand, Rigi was captured by Pakistani officials and delivered to Iran with U.S. support: \\"It doesn't matter what they say. They know the truth.\\" Execution On 20 June 2010, Iranian and international media reported that Rigi had been hanged in Evin Prison in Tehran. The Islamic Republic News Agency stated that the execution was carried out following a decision of the Tehran revolutionary tribunal. It quoted a court statement saying: \\"The head of the armed counter-revolutionary group in the east of the country was responsible for armed robbery, assassination attempts, armed attacks on the army and police and on ordinary people, and murder.\\" His execution was described as a \\"severe blow\\" to Jundullah. In response to the execution, Iran's then Interior Minister, Mostafa Mohammad- Najjar, said \\"Over the past 30 years, our enemies faced defeat in every instance and their latest ploy was [inciting] the seditionists who wanted to break our ranks. With the execution of this villain, who was backed by several Western spy agencies and the Israelis, complete peace has returned to the region.\\" Rigi was buried in Khavaran cemetery in southeast Tehran. An Iranian drama film, When the Moon Was Full, written and directed by Narges Abyar, was released in 2019. It is based on the story of Rigi's brother and sister-in- law.

He is an American 5-string banjoist, composer, author, and an originator of \\"Celtic fingerstyle\\" banjo. In 1998, he and luthier Geoff Stelling co-designed the Stelling Tom Hanway SwallowTail banjo, available in both standard and deluxe models, used in bluegrass, folk, and Celtic music around the world. Influences and early career Tom Hanway learned to play the banjo in the 1980s, studying with Tony Trischka and Bill Keith, being inspired by their music and the music of Earl Scruggs, Ralph Stanley, Don Reno, B√©la Fleck, David Bromberg, Jerry Garcia, the Grateful Dead, and Vassar Clements. In the late 80s and early 90s he worked with the John Herald Band (formerly the Greenbriar Boys), Blue Horizon, Burnt Toast, and with Kenny Kosek in the off- Broadway bluegrass musical Feast Here Tonight. Hanway has played on dozens of recordings on both sides of the Atlantic, and has produced three recordings on his Joyous Gard Records label; for Bucket of Bees, he teamed up with Sam Bush, Jerry Douglas, Stuart Duncan, David Grier, Tony Trischka, Bill Keith and Vassar Clements in Nashville and New York City . He has performed onstage with Bill Monroe, Peter Rowan, Vassar Clements, Rick Danko and Levon Helm. In the 1990s and early 2000s, he and Kathleen Low Hanway (1960‚Äì2002) organized the St. Mark‚Äôs Bluegrass Festival and the Big Apple Bluegrass & Folk Festival in New York City. In 2005, he won the European Bluegrass Music Association's 'European Bluegrass Band of the Year' award as a member of the Bluegrass Ravens. Irish and Celtic music In 1998, Mel Bay Publications published Hanway‚Äôs seminal book and CD, Complete Book of Irish & Celtic 5-String Banjo (). Bluegrass Unlimited wrote in January 1999: \\"What Earl Scruggs' book did for bluegrass banjo, Tom Hanway's book may well do for the 5-string in Irish and Celtic music, and will certainly become regarded as 'the bible' for any 5-string player with an interest in this joyous music.\\" Hanway is a music journalist and contributing writer to the Celtic League, American Branch, Perspective and Meaning in Celtic Music. He is a member of the United Arts Club in Dublin, promoting traditional music concerts, including Irish, bluegrass and folk music. He now calls Ireland home and resides in Longford. Currently Hanway remains a sought after talent on the Irish bluegrass scene where he plays with the top bands.

Founded in 1900, the curriculum is traditional, with a broad general programme of subjects and a compulsory Transition year programme. Muckross is one of a number of Dominican schools in Ireland. It has a student body of approx 700. It has a strong reputation as a sporting school, especially in hockey, tennis and basketball. Many former students have gone on to play for Ireland at the international level. Likewise, academically the school achieves exceptionally high results with regular high rankings in The Irish Times list of feeder schools for 3rd level education in Ireland. History The college was founded in 1900 as St. Mary's University College, initially a third-level college for women studying for degrees awarded by the Royal University of Ireland. Fashion show In previous years the transition year students of Muckross collaborated with the Transition year students of St.Michaels College in a charity fashion show. Each year the show had a different theme and was a substantial fund-raiser for that year's chosen charity. The fashion show is no longer in action. Junior and senior years First, second and third years work hard towards achieving good results in their Junior Certificate Examination. Each year brings something new however it is the senior years that bring more activity and not just simply work. Transition year consists of organising work placements several times throughout the year (some of which include the filming of an RT√â documentary in China and working at Milan Fashion Week) as well as much more such as a school trip abroad for roughly a week. Past destinations have included Munich, Italy and Spain. Every week the students walk down to the nearby Independent Theatre Workshop studios (renowned for being one of the best in Ireland) for an hour of dance and drama classes. This is just one of many class modules (there is also cooking, horticulture, yearbook, film making, fitness and many more). Fifth year is a year for preparing for the Leaving Certificate Examinations. However, there is also the ski trip as well as the musical with Gonzaga College. In sixth year the pupils have much study to do, however they can also take part in the pre-debs party, mock party, graduation mass and last day celebration. Clubs There are many clubs and activities in the school such as book club where students discuss their book of the week. There is also the choir who perform at the opening of the school year mass and various other occasions such as the Christmas evening before the school closes for Christmas. Glee club has been introduced in the last few years. It entails singing popular songs, old and new, with fresh harmonies and mash-ups. Events Events during the school year include the opening of the school year mass which occurs in the beautiful Donnybrook church. The Halloween dress-up day is a fun day for all, the sports day at the end of the year is also a great day with many different sports stations to choose from. Every year gets a one- or two-day retreat as well as many more exciting things such as day trips (Ferrycarrig, museums and galleries, the Gaisce hike and Carlingford for T.Y, Newgrange etc.) Sports Muckross Park has a very high standard when it comes to sports teams, especially in hockey. Minor, Junior and Senior hockey teams have won many Leinster League titles. The Senior 1 team has also claimed the Senior Cup on numerous occasions. The senior basketball team \\"The Cadettes\\" are also high achievers on the competitive circuit. Other sports include cricket, handball, tennis, swimming, horse- riding and athletics, all of which Muckross consistently perform well in. Past Pupils' Union The Past Pupils' Union (PPU) began in 1912, twelve years after the school was founded. This makes it the oldest all-girls Past Pupils Union in Ireland. The aim of the Union is to encourage and help past pupils to remain in contact, both with each other and with the school. This is done through their quarterly newsletter and by a number of social events such as the Annual Luncheon, the annual PPU golf outing and the Combined Dominican Union outing, Easter Egg Hunt, Past Pupils vs Present Pupils hockey match, and others. The Muckross Adult Choir consists of past pupils, staff members and parents of current and past Muckross pupils. T The Union also fundraises for its Benevolent Fund, which is used to grant financial assistance to those in need. The Muckross Park Past Pupils' Union Benevolent Fund was set-up during the tenure of the 1977/79 committee with the primary objective of helping past pupils who find themselves in financial difficulty, whatever the reason. Over the years, the Fund has been used to support past pupils who have been impacted by serious illness, disability, bereavement, and unemployment. The Fund has also supported the education of students in need and other charitable causes deemed appropriate at the discretion of the Committee, such as a Dominican early-learning programme in South Africa and a Dominican third-level project in Argentina. The Past Pupils‚Äô Union continues to reach out to those who are in need and who can most benefit from a contribution from the Benevolent Fund. The Fund is financed by past pupils for past pupils by way of the Annual Raffle and also through private donations.

It is also known as the Cap of Hades or Helm of Hades. Wearers of the cap in Greek myths include Athena, the goddess of wisdom, the messenger god Hermes, and the hero Perseus. The Cap of Invisibility enables the user to become invisible to other supernatural entities, functioning much like the cloud of mist that the gods surround themselves in to become undetectable.  Origins  One ancient source that attributes a special helmet to the ruler of the underworld is the Bibliotheca (2nd/1st century BC), in which the Uranian Cyclops give Zeus the lightning bolt, Poseidon the trident, and a helmet (kyne√™) to Hades in their war against the Titans. In classical mythology the helmet is regularly said to belong to the god of the underworld. Rabelais calls it the Helmet of Pluto,Gargantua and Pantagruel Book 5, Chapter 8. and Erasmus the Helmet of Orcus.Erasmus, Adagia 2.10.74 (Orci galea). The helmet becomes proverbial for those who conceal their true nature by a cunning device: \\"the helmet of Pluto, which maketh the politic man go invisible, is secrecy in the counsel, and celerity in the execution.\\"Francis Bacon Essays Civil and Moral 21, \\"Of Delays\\".  Users =Hades As the name implies, Hades owned the helmet. It was forged for him by Elder Cyclopses after he and his brothers Zeus and Poseidon freed them from Tartarus. He then used this helmet to great effect during the Titanomachy and was instrumental in routing the Titans. Athena Athena, the goddess of wisdom, battle, and handicrafts, wore the Cap of Invisibility in one instance during the Trojan War.\\"‚Ä¶but Athene put on the cap of Hades, to the end that mighty Ares should not see her.\\" Homer. Iliad 5.844-845. Translation By A. T. Murray. She used it to become invisible to Ares when she aided Diomedes, his enemy. Her assistance even enabled Diomedes to injure the god of war with a spear. Hermes The messenger god Hermes wore the Cap during his battle with Hippolytus, the giant. Perseus In some stories, Perseus received the Cap of Invisibility (along with the Winged Sandals) from Athena when he went to slay the Gorgon Medusa, which helped him escape her sisters. In other myths, however, Perseus obtained these items from the Stygian nymphs. The Cap of Invisibility was not used to avoid the Gorgons' petrifying gazes, but rather to escape from the immortal Sthenno and Euryale later on after he had decapitated Medusa. In popular culture In the Dragon Quest role-playing video game series, there is a piece of equipment named \\"Hades' helm.\\" It is cursed, and is therefore useless, in every game but Dragon Quest IX, in which it can be alchemised into a Great Helm. In the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series by Rick Riordan, Annabeth Chase (a daughter of Athena) received a New York Yankees baseball cap from her mother that was a disguised cap of invisibility. In the same series, the main antagonist, Luke Castellan, stole Hades' Helm of Darkness, as well as Zeus' master bolt. The helmet also appears in the Italian mythological comedy Arrivano i titani, but its invisibility powers work in this version only at night. The helm plays a major role in Dan Simmons' novel Ilium in which the scholic narrator Thomas Hockenberry acquires the artifact through Aphrodite in her scheme to have the scholic spy on and eventually assassinate the goddess Athena. A version of the helmet also appears in the videogame series God of War, worn by Hades himself. In God of War III, before the boss battle against him begins, Hades uses it to turn himself invisible while threatening his nephew Kratos. While he does not make use of it during the actual battle, the Helmet can be collected after Hades is killed. This item, when activated during Bonus Play, maxes out Kratos' health, magic, and item bars.

History and profile The Office of Revue Noire in Paris with Jean Loup Pivin Revue Noire was founded in 1991 by Jean Loup Pivin, Pascal Martin Saint L√≥on, Bruno Tilliette, and Simon Njami.Lucy Dur√°n (ed.), Africa Remix: Contemporary Art of a Continent (Johannesburg: Jacana Media, 2007), p. 249. Their goal was to give high-quality printed attention to contemporary African art. It covered varying subjects from sculpture, painting, photography, dance, theatre, music and literature.Paula Youngman Skreslet, Northern Africa: A Guide to Reference and Information Sources (Englewood: Libraries Unlimited, 2000), p. 199 There were issues on African cities, AIDS, and even gastronomy. Design played a key role in forwarding its objectives and Revue Noire has been described as \\"glossy, fashion savvy and distinctly Parisian\\".Description at Chimurenga Library. Images were combined with largely informative texts that highlighted artistic responses to the international media and the touristic gaze as well as the production of discourses of cultural identity on the continent, the framing the African body, urban sites and rapidly changing dynamics between African aesthetic values and Western influences. From the beginning Revue Noire was aimed at the widest possible audience of those with an interest in art, Africa, or intercultural subject matter. Distributed internationally, it was bilingual (English/French), sometimes adding texts in Portuguese. This language policy and its focus on specific regions - from Abidjan to London, Kinshasa to Paris, Accra, Teshie or Johannesburg to New York or Tokyo - not only facilitated access to information on African artistic production but also forged new links between artist based on the continent and those working in the diaspora. After 34 issues, Editions Revue Noire interrupted the printing of the journal in 2001 and refocused its attention on publishing books, curating exhibitions and posting occasional online content. Issues Dak'Art 2016 The magazine focuses on artists' monographs and on specific countries or geographic areas where the editorial team produces research on arts (which include visual art, photography, music, literature, dance, theatre, fashion but also architecture and food).

He made his debut in 2001 but had many injury problems. In 2006, he obtained Japanese citizenship, adopting the official name of Tebita Togawa. He retired in May 2009. Career As an amateur he competed in the lightweight category at the Junior World Sumo Championships in 2000, just missing out on a bronze medal. He made his professional debut in March 2001, joining the small Tagonoura stable. His first shikona or fighting name was Hisanoumi. He reached as high as sandanme 24 in the fourth highest division in November 2004, but injury meant he was not able to participate in any tournaments from November 2005 until September 2006. As a result, he fell off the banzuke (ranking list) completely in July 2006. He finally returned to the ring in November 2006 and fought three maezumo (pre-sumo) bouts ‚Äì effectively beginning his career all over again from the very bottom. He won all three bouts. At the end of 2006 he acquired Japanese citizenship. This allowed the Tagonoura stable to circumvent the Sumo Association's \\"one foreigner per heya\\" rule and recruit another Tongan. He reappeared on the banzuke in January 2007, ranked at jonokuchi 29. He then took the jonokuchi championship with a 6‚Äì1 record. By May 2007 he had progressed to jonidan 20 where he turned in another fine 6‚Äì1 score. This earned him promotion back to sandanme for July. In his first tournament in sandanme since September 2005 he could manage only a 2‚Äì5 score. In the September 2007 tournament, despite missing his first bout, he went on to record five wins and just one loss. At the end of 2007 he changed his shikona from Hisanoumi Taiy≈ç to Aotsurugi Kenta. His score of 4‚Äì3 at Sandanme 25 in the September 2008 tournament pushed him up to a new highest rank of Sandanme 12 for November 2008 and he reached the top of the division in the January 2009 tournament. He scored three wins against four losses at Sandanme 1 in that tournament. He missed the May 2009 tournament, and announced his retirement from sumo. Although he had had knee problems in the past, his stablemaster Tagonoura Oyakata (the former Kushimaumi) said that he had simply lost the will to fight.

He did not manage to reach the top two divisions, but was regarded as a kind of mentor and father figure by younger Mongolian wrestlers who followed him, such as Hakuh≈ç and Harumafuji. In 2005, he obtained Japanese citizenship, but he left sumo upon his retirement in November 2007, moving to Germany with his family to run a business. Career Kyokutenzan joined sumo in March 1992 at the same time as his more famous Mongolian colleagues Kyokush≈´zan and Kyokutenh≈ç, part of the first group of Mongolians ever to join the sport professionally, but unlike them he never reached sekitori status. This was due partly to an inability to put on weight, and partly to injuries. Nevertheless, he served as a tsukebito, or personal attendant, to Kyokutenh≈ç, and was an importance influence on other Mongolian rikishi. During his early days in sumo, when five of the six Mongolians in ≈åshima stable ran away due to homesickness and the hardship of training, and sought refuge in the Mongolian embassy, Kyokutenzan was the only one who remained and he persuaded his countrymen to return. The importance of this action was recognized by Futagoyama Oyakata, the former ≈çzeki and father of Takanohana and Wakanohana, who commented that otherwise the subsequent line of successful Mongolian wrestlers in sumo might never have emerged. During the January 2007 tournament Kyokutenzan attracted criticism over the amount of time he was spending in the two dressing rooms in which the wrestlers prepare for their bouts. He was interviewed by the Japan Sumo Association as part of their investigation of alleged match-fixing involving yokozuna Asash≈çry≈´. Kyokutenzan responded by saying he was just giving advice to Mongolian junior wrestlers, declaring, \\"I have never known of any match-fixing.\\" Kyokutenzan retired from professional sumo at the end of the 2007 Kyushu tournament. His retirement ceremony was held in December with Hakuh≈ç and Asash≈çry≈´ amongst the attendees as well as Kyokush≈´zan and Kyokutenh≈ç.[sumo] Kyokutenzan's dampatsu (and nostalgia) Kyuokutenzan moved to Germany with his wife, who he had married in July 2007, to start a business.

Map from 1681 showing the Haarlemmertrekvaart as connecting Haarlem to Amsterdam, and the Leidsevaart connecting Haarlem to Leiden. At Halfweg the two bodies of water \\"Haarlemmermeer\\" and \\"Het Ye\\" meet at Gemeenlandshuis Zwanenburg. Drawing of interior of a trekschuit on the Haarlemmertrekvaart in 1760. Drawing of trekschuit on Nieuweramstel 1700‚Äì1725. The jager is on the horse. Trekschuit (, literally \\"tug-boat\\") is an old style of sail- and horse-drawn boat specific to the Netherlands, where it was used for centuries as a means of passenger traffic between cities along trekvaarten, or tow-canals. History The first trekschuit 'sailed' in 1632 between Amsterdam and Haarlem and could carry 30 passengers. The trekvaart or canal was dug especially in a straight line to guarantee the shortest route. The passengers needed to step out and change boats in Halfweg, which means \\"halfway\\". This is how the town of Halfweg was formed. Because of the enormous success of this Haarlemmertrekvaart, the service was extended from Haarlem to Leiden in 1657. In 1668 the first evening service was announced in the Haarlems Dagblad,Advertisements in the Oprechte Haerlemse Courant of 1668 enabling daily commuting to the growing metropolis of Amsterdam, which was becoming by that time more and more necessary for the (depressed) Haarlem economy: By 1700 an extensive network of trekschuit- and ferry services linked all of the important cities in the coastal provinces of the Netherlands. Travel by trekschuit was reliable, comfortable and cheap. The speed was about 7 kilometers per hour, which was faster than walking, and more comfortable than by coach. Many foreigners praised the advantages of the system, leading to the introduction of canals such as the Erie canal in the United States. The boats were pulled along by horse on a towpath (in Dutch called jaagpad, named after the jager (chaser) which accompanied the horse). The old tow-canal system that were once busy trekschuit routes became obsolete with the advent of the railway in the mid-19th century, many of which were first built alongside the canals because they were assumed to be the most profitable routes. Canal travel Many foreign travellers to the Netherlands came by boat. Amsterdam during the Dutch Golden Age was the leading port city of Northern Europe and a major hub in the trekschuit network. Since the canals also functioned as the city's sewers, the smell of them in the summertime was bad. William Thomas Beckford, whose Dreams, Waking Thoughts, and Incidents is a published account of his letters back home in 1780 while on his Grand Tour of Europe, travelled from Ostend, to Antwerp, to Haarlem, and to Utrecht by trekschuit, and wrote: He switched his transportation to a coach from Utrecht to Spa. Legend of Boerhaave and Spinoza In Samuel Johnson's Life of Herman Boerhaave, the legend of Boerhaave and Spinoza is related that supposedly took place in 1688 or 1689, when Boerhaave graduated from Leiden University. This makes mention of the trekschuit as a 'common boat': Passenger boat traffic in the Netherlands today The rise of the steam locomotive in the 19th century caused the decline of the trekschuit between the major cities as a form of transport, and today many of the oldest canals in congested parts of the country are defunct and no longer kept navigable by the Water board. During World War II, a brief revival of the trekschuit occurred because of the scarcity of fuel for motorized transport. Since then, in Amsterdam the trekschuit has given way to the \\"museum boat\\" and \\"canal cruises\\" used exclusively by tourists. In the provinces, where the infrastructure has not been superseded by trains or highways, the old trekschuit canals are popular for water tourism and many cities and towns are installing boat landings built specifically for pleasure boating. Restored trekschuits are chic venues for weddings or other parties in the summer, while larger antique barges are transformed into traveling hotels offering cruise vacations.

He was released from custody in 2013 after his third trial resulted in an acquittal. Camm became a suspect because of an interpretation of bloodstain patterns on his clothing, as well as a number of leads and pieces of evidence that were later found to be unreliable or outright false. He was tried and found guilty of the murder, but his conviction was overturned in 2004 on the grounds that testimony about his marital infidelity had been prejudicial. In 2005, forensic evidence identified a career criminal named Charles Boney as having been at the crime scene. Boney's modus operandi in previous crimes showed similarities to aspects of the murders. Boney had a history of stalking and attacking women, often stealing their shoes; Kim's shoes had been removed and placed neatly on top of her vehicle and she had a series of bruises and abrasions to her feet. The prosecution was widely criticized for the failure to find Boney prior to the first trial. They told the defense team in 2001 that the DNA had been run through CODIS and returned no matches. It was later discovered that Boney's DNA was entered into the system prior to the murders and would have returned a match if it had been run. Boney gave a number of conflicting confessions, but eventually accused Camm of the murders, claiming he witnessed Camm shoot his family while he was at the home selling Camm a handgun. Camm was charged along with Boney as a co-conspirator. Boney was tried first and separately, convicted of the murders, and sentenced to 225 years in prison. In 2006, Camm was found guilty on the murder charges at his retrial. Camm appealed, and the verdict was overturned on the grounds that the prosecution at the second trial had accused Camm of sexually molesting his 5-year-old daughter Jill, without producing evidence for the allegation. Boney testified against Camm for the first time at the third trial, although his credibility was called into question when he was unable to describe the car Camm drove and also incorrectly described Camm's clothing on the night of the murder. Evidence was presented that Charles Boney's DNA was found on Kim's underpants, shirt, and broken-off fingernail; and on Jill's shirt, suggesting he physically attacked the family himself. Defense witnesses also testified that prosecution assertions about the stains were not widely accepted by others in the field of bloodstain analysis. It was also discovered that the blood spatter analyst Rob Stites, whose analysis had triggered the arrest, had falsified his credentials and did not work in the field of bloodstain pattern analysis at all. He had previously testified that he was a professor at Portland State University; it was discovered that he had no affiliation with the university. He testified in the third trial that he had perjured himself during the first two. Dr. Robert Shaler, who served on a committee for The National Academy of Sciences to evaluate forensic methods, testified that blood spatter pattern analysis was found to be unreliable in their studies. Another expert demonstrated that the pattern could be produced through transfer. The defense presented suspicious behavior on the part of Boney, such as visiting the graves of the victims, speaking on the phone to the prosecutors office on 33 occasions in the two- week period before his arrest, and hiring Stan Faith, the prosecutor, as his defense attorney and discussing the case with him prior to becoming a suspect. They also presented a number of instances of alleged misconduct by the police and prosecutors in the case. The case was covered extensively by the media in the southern Indiana and Louisville, Kentucky, area, and by national news programs including Nancy Grace, 48 Hours, and Dateline NBC. The case is noted for the extensive allegations of prosecutorial misconduct, including Brady violations, witness tampering, evidence tampering, perjury and an overall shoddy investigation and has been detailed in numerous forensic textbooks. Initial investigation Police were summoned to the Camm residence shortly after 9:30p.m. on September 28, 2000, to find Kim, Brad, and Jill Camm shot to death in the garage of their home. Camm told police that he returned home from playing basketball at a nearby church and found his wife shot to death on the floor of the garage. He then saw his children sitting in the backseat. Camm stated that he thought his son may still be alive, so he pulled him out and attempted CPR. Bradley Camm was found lying on the floor on top of a prison issue sweatshirt with DNA from two unknown persons on it as well as other forensic evidence. First theory of the crime The investigation of the murders was hampered from the beginning by several false leads. The theory of the crime at the time of the arrest was that Camm returned home from playing basketball, shot his family, and attempted a clean-up before abandoning this and calling the Sellersburg State Police post for help. Rob Stites, a crime scene photographer who was believed by the police to be a blood spatter analyst, told police there was a clean-up at the crime scene and high velocity impact spatter on the shirt Camm was wearing. Another piece of seemingly incriminating evidence was a phone bill seeming to indicate Camm had made a phone call from the residence at 7:19p.m. on the evening of the murder. He claimed to be playing basketball at the church from 7:00p.m. to approximately 9:30p.m. that evening. Camm also had had a history of infidelity, which police believed was the motive for the murders. Before long, the erroneous nature of several pieces of evidence was revealed. While the infidelity accusations were credible, it was discovered that most of the rest of the evidence on the probable cause affidavit was either inaccurate or unreliable. Based on the autopsies and other evidence, the time of death was determined to be around 8:00p.m., far earlier than the original estimate of 9:30p.m. giving Camm an alibi. The phone call that seemed to prove Camm was lying about his alibi was disproven. The phone company discovered the inaccuracy stemmed from the confusion regarding Indiana's complicated time zones. The call actually was made an hour earlier, at 6:19p.m.. The clean-up at the crime scene and the blood spatter on David's shirt were also called into question. It was discovered that there was not in fact a crime scene clean-up, but the normal separation of blood when exposed to air for a period of time. Several other areas that Stites had claimed to be high velocity impact spatter found at the crime scene were found to be inaccurate interpretations, calling into question Stites' abilities. Investigators stated that they investigated the foreign DNA on the sweatshirt found at the crime scene, but there were no matches when it was run through CODIS. Second theory of the crime The discovery that the time of the murder was over an hour earlier than previously thought meant that David now had an alibi. Eleven witnesses told police he was with them playing basketball from 7:00p.m. until after 9:00p.m.. The police changed their theory of the crime from a murder following the basketball game to one in which he sneaked out of the basketball game, committed the murders, and then slipped back in without being noticed. Trials and appeals=First trial The case went to trial in the spring of 2002 with the blood spatter as the main forensic evidence and the affairs listed as the motive. The prosecution argued that the bloodstains on Camm's shirt were the result of high velocity impact spatter, proving he was the shooter. Defense experts assert that the pattern was caused by transfer when his shirt came in contact with Jill's hair as he was removing his son from the vehicle. Bart Epstein, a bloodstain analyst for the defense, stated that there is some overlap between the appearance of different types of stains so blood spatter analysts need to consider other aspects of the stain to determine the cause. In this case, the number of blood stains is as relevant as their size and shape. \\"Gunshot will produce hundreds of stains coming back. I've never seen, I believe the other experts for both the prosecution and the defense have indicated that they've never seen just seven small or eight small stains from a gunshot. I've never seen that,\\" said Epstein. During the trials, Epstein and another blood analyst demonstrated how the blood stains could have gotten on the shirt by running T-shirts over wigs containing blood. Similar patterns to the one on Camm's shirt were produced. Nevertheless, he was convicted. In August 2004, the Indiana Court of Appeals overturned the conviction. The court cited the trial judge's decision to allow testimony from a dozen women who claimed they had affairs with Camm or had been propositioned by him, which unfairly biased the jury because the prosecutor did not adequately connect those relationships with the murders. In November 2004, prosecutor Keith Henderson refiled charges against Camm. Discovery of a second suspect In early 2005, the defense asked that DNA from two unknown persons found on the sweatshirt at the crime scene be run through CODIS again. Defense lawyers claim the prosecution refused until they were finally compelled to by a court order. A match was found for the male DNA and it was discovered that that particular DNA sample was never run prior to the first trial despite assurances from the prosecutor that the sample had been analyzed and returned no matches. Charles Boney, a convicted felon from nearby New Albany was identified as the owner of the sweatshirt. He was out on parole at the time of the crime, having been convicted of committing a series of armed attacks on women, several of them involving the theft of shoes. The most recent attack was the armed robbery and attempted abduction of three women at gunpoint. In some cases, there was evidence of stalking as well; some of Boney's previous victims had reported receiving harassing phone calls for a couple months prior to the attacks asking them what they were wearing and if they were wearing high heeled shoes. He had previously admitted to police that he had a foot fetish, a detail he later discussed with numerous news outlets. This detail was suspicious to the defense: Kim Camm's shoes were removed and lined up neatly on top of the vehicle in the midst of a messy crime scene. Kim had a series of bruises and abrasions to the top of both of her feet. Boney was interviewed and took a polygraph, in which he was determined to be deceptive. He denied any involvement, claiming that he donated the sweatshirt to charity and was cleared as a suspect. Two weeks later, his palm print was discovered on Kim's vehicle and he was arrested. The other DNA sample was later identified as belonging to Mala Singh Mattingly, Boney's then girlfriend. It was discovered after his arrest that Stan Faith, the prosecutor in Camm's first trial, was Charles Boney's attorney. During questioning, Boney asked to be represented by Faith but was told it was a conflict of interest. Boney admits to having discussed the case with Faith prior to becoming a suspect in the case. When asked about the failure of his office to identify Boney, Faith denied any intentional wrongdoing stating: \\"I regret it. I deeply regret it, but the myth that's growing out of this is false.\\" Third theory of the crime Boney gave a number of conflicting confessions before he finally settled on one in which he was lured to the Camm residence under the guise of selling a gun to David Camm. He admits to placing the shoes on the vehicle, but claims he did it only coincidentally and not related to his foot fetish. Boney claims that on September 28 he arrived at 7:00p.m. to meet David at the Camm residence to sell him a weapon‚Äîa meeting they arranged through chance meetings and without the use of a telephone. He hands Camm the weapon wrapped in his gray sweatshirt that was later found at the crime scene. Within seconds, Kim arrives home in her Bronco, Camm follows the Bronco into the garage and Boney hears three shots fired. Boney alleges that Camm then attempted to shoot him and stated \\"you did this\\". He claims that the gun either jammed or ran out of bullets. With Camm holding a now non-functioning weapon, Boney ran after Camm, chasing him back into the garage. Camm entered the house while Boney tripped and fell over Kim's shoes, which were off of her feet and on the garage floor. Boney stated that he picked up the shoes and placed them atop the Bronco. He then leaned against the vehicle to look at Brad and Jill, who were inside the vehicle, deceased. He explains that this is why his hand print was found on the vehicle. (note: based on testimony from other prosecution witnesses, Kim, Brad, and Jill were still alive and at the pool until 7:15pm. The timeline given by Boney of a shooting shortly after 7pm also conflicts with the prosecution's timeline, which aligns with the medical examiner's estimation of an 8pm time of death.) Aside from Boney's story, no additional evidence has been recovered to connect David Camm and Charles Boney. Mala Singh Mattingly After Mattingly's DNA was identified, she was interviewed regarding her knowledge of the crime. She told police that Charles Boney returned home after midnight on the night of the murders. \\"He was breathing really hard -- excited somewhat,\\" Mattingly said. She said that he showed her a gun, had a bloody scraped knee and was sweating profusely. The next morning, she says, Boney asked her and his mother to watch news coverage regarding the murders. She testified that she left the room to shower while he and his mother began arguing. Her blood was found mixed with Brad and Kim Camm's blood on the sweatshirt at the crime scene. Second trial Following Boney's arrest in 2005, Camm and Boney were charged as co- conspirators in the murder of Kim and her children. Boney was tried first, convicted, and sentenced to 225 years in prison. Camm's trial began on January 17, 2006. With the affairs now inadmissible, prosecutor Keith Henderson argued that Camm was molesting their daughter and he killed his family to cover up the crime. Their evidence was a single blunt force trauma injury to Jill's genitals. A medical examiner who testified for the defense disagreed with the state's theory that it was the result of sexual abuse, arguing the child's hymen was intact and it was just one of many blunt force trauma injuries sustained by being struck during the fatal attack. The prosecution presented Boney's story that Camm was the shooter but Boney was there to sell Camm a gun. Camm was convicted a second time on March 3, 2006, and was sentenced to life without parole. Camm appealed the conviction, citing the prejudicial nature of the molestation allegations and the lack of evidence linking the injuries to him. The Indiana Supreme Court granted a second reversal, stating \\"Missing from this record is any competent evidence of the premise that the defendant molested the child.\\" Third trial The motive alleged by the prosecution in the third trial was the life insurance policies purchased by Kim Camm. Charles Boney testified against David Camm for the first time, accusing him of luring him out to the home before shooting his own family and then turning the gun on him. The third trial saw the introduction of new DNA evidence that wasn't presented in the first two trials. Dr. Richard Eikelenboom testified that he found touch DNA consistent with Boney in several places on the clothing of both Kim and Jill Camm. Boney's DNA was found on Kim Camm's panties, the arm of her shirt (above an abrasion on her arm thought to be the result of the struggle with her killer), on Kim's broken off fingernail, and on the stomach of Jill Camm's shirt. These results seem to discredit Boney's assertion that he never touched the victims. Defense co- counsel Stacy Uliana argued that if Boney physically attacked the family, which the DNA seems to suggest, it is unlikely that David is the shooter. Fourth theory of the crime With the touch DNA evidence placing Boney in a more active role in the crime, the prosecution introduced yet another theory of the crime near the end of the third trial when Judge Dartt made a controversial ruling that the jury instructions could include an instruction allowing the jury to find Camm guilty if they believe he \\"aided and abetted\\" Boney during the murders. This instruction applied if the jury believed Camm had involvement in the murders, but was not the shooter. The defense strenuously objected to the inclusion of this instruction, citing not only the complete lack of evidence that Camm had ever even met Boney, but that the instruction violated the law against double jeopardy; Camm had been acquitted on conspiracy charges during the second trial. Louisville defense attorney Steve Romines criticized the move stating: \\"This aiding and abetting: they don't have any evidence to support it. It's really inconsistent with their proof.\\" Camm's defense attorneys argued this new theory of the crime essentially throws out the blood spatter evidence‚Äîthe only major piece of forensic evidence tying Camm to the crime. Following the verdict, Richard Kammen stated: \\"All the sudden to say 'well if all our evidence is wrong, go ahead and convict him anyway' this jury was a smart jury, they clearly saw through that.\\" Acquittal On October 24, 2013, a jury found Camm not guilty of all charges.David Camm verdict: NOT GUILTY, WDRB TV, October 24, 2013 Camm's attorneys described it as \\"vindication\\". By then, NBC News reported that costs had reached an \\"estimated $4.5 million.\\" Response to the case=Verdict The public reaction to the verdict has been mixed. Many Louisville and Southern Indiana residents who lived through the extensive media coverage were surprised by the not guilty verdict in the third trial. In reaction to the verdict, a local resident stated \\"A lot of people are ‚Äî just like I am ‚Äî completely shocked, and a lot of people think that he should not be out.\\" Nationally, the Camm case has garnered a lot of attention from wrongful conviction advocacy groups who believe that the previous convictions were miscarriages of justice. Bill Lamb, President and General Manager of WDRB, the Fox affiliate in Louisville, Kentucky, issued a public apology to David Camm stating: \\"Seven years ago, I did a Point of View criticizing David Camm's attorneys for seeking yet another appeal right after his second conviction for the murder of his family. I wondered when Indiana taxpayers would get to stop paying fortunes in trial expenses, and why any accused killer could possibly deserve so many 'do-overs'. Well, now we have the answer: When they're not guilty.\\" After the third trial, a juror, in response to the question \\"Do you think that they intentionally wanted to convict an innocent man?\\" responded \\"I would hope not but‚Ä¶I sense that the State Police had a hard time admitting that they had made a mistake.\\" Media coverage The case has been covered widely in the media. In January 2014, Dateline on NBC aired a two-hour special entitled Mystery on Lockart Road and has been covered three times on 48 Hours on CBS. Two books have been written about the case: One Deadly Night was published in 2005, and Searching For Justice in 2013, as well as a chapter in Jane Velez-Mitchell's book Secrets Can Be Murder: The Killer Next Door. Blood spatter The heavy reliance on blood spatter evidence in this case was widely criticized. In his review of the case, former federal prosecutor Kent Wicker said \\"Blood spatter evidence has come under a lot of criticism in the past few years. In 2009 The National Academy of Sciences issued a report criticizing the scientific foundation of that.\\" The report released by The National Academy of Sciences calls for more standardization within a number of forensic fields including blood spatter analysis. The report highlights the tendency of blood spatter analysts to overstate the reliability of their methods in the court room. Dr. Robert Shaler, Founding Director of the Penn State Forensic Science Program, decried blood spatter analysis as unreliable in the Camm case. \\"The problem in this case is the number of stains are minimal,\\" he said. \\"I think you're really on the edge of reliability.\\" Dr. Shaler said blood stain pattern analysis as a science is \\"essentially guesswork\\". The problem with blood spatter analysis is that \\"you do not have the supporting underlying science\\" to back up your conclusions. All of the blood spatter analysts involved in the case from the start (aside from Rob Stites) have been \\"experts\\" in the traditional sense. The problem is \\"We have two opinions in this case. That, in essence, is a 50 percent error rate.\\" An unacceptable level of reliability in a court case when the perception of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is what is required. Evidence of misconduct regarding the blood spatter was uncovered when, in the third trial, crime scene photographer Rob Stites testified for the defense, admitting he had perjured himself in the first two trials. Stites' assertion that the spots on David Camm's shirt were high velocity impact spray (HVIS) was the cornerstone of the probable cause affidavit that led to Camm's arrest and his testimony at the first two trials helped the prosecution win Camm's convictions. He had previously testified that he was an expert blood spatter pattern analyst and a professor at Portland State University who was in the process of attaining a Ph.D. ‚Äî credentials which were fabrications. He asserts that Floyd County prosecutor Stan Faith helped create those fraudulent credentials. During the third trial, he outlined how he was sent to the crime scene by Rod Englert to photograph and take notes. Despite his lack of formal training in the field or work experience as a crime scene analyst, his notes ended up being used in the probable cause affidavit, with him being listed as a \\"crime scene reconstructionist,\\" a title that did not apply to him. The defense pointed out several aspects of Stites' notes that were later proven to be false including \\"HVIS\\" on the garage door, later proven to be a petroleum based-product and not blood. Stites' opinion that there was a clean-up at the crime scene involving bleach was also incorrect. The confusion came from the unfamiliar look of the blood after the serum had separated from the blood cells. Regarding his actions, he commented, \\"It was a dumb thing...In hindsight, I would have kept my mouth shut.\\" Stites was not charged with perjury for his testimony in the previous two trials. Criticism of the prosecution A number of legal experts have criticized the way the case was handled. Thomas Schornhorst, a professor emeritus of the Indiana University School of Law, said the case has been overturned repeatedly because they have pushed the envelope with other evidence fearing that they would not get a conviction on bloodstain evidence alone. Law professor Shawn Boyne highlighted the Camm trials as an example of the problems within the American justice system. Boyne stated that the judges in these trials allowed the prosecutors to present \\"specious claims of motive designed to paint the defendant with a broad stroke of guilt and moral condemnation and overcome a lack of physical evidence.\\" Boyne stated \\"the state overreached and that overreaching did not serve the cause of justice.\\" Louisville defense attorney Steve Romines criticized the prosecution's decision to change the theory of the crime numerous times instead of dropping the charges: \\"The problem is, in the first trial, David Camm's the shooter and acted alone. The second trial, David Camm's the shooter and Boney aided and abetted him. And now in this trial, Charles Boney is the shooter and David Camm aided and abetted him. In three trials, with the same proof, they've had three different theories\\", adding \\"Proof doesn't change. If you have proof beyond a reasonable doubt, you argue the same thing throughout. You don't have to constantly shift your theory to fit your proof.\\" Camm's defense team has long been critical of their inability to present evidence of Charles Boney's involvement, particularly when the prosecution was allowed to speculate about Camm's motives. Despite Boney's history of stalking and armed violence against women, his past crimes were ruled inadmissible. Local criticism was expressed during the trial in Boonville, Indiana. National news reported that an act of vandalism was carried out by suspected local individuals. The vandals spray-painted \\"fry Camm make bacon\\" in the area outside of the Warrick county judicial center. Errors in evidence collection By the third trial, the backbone of the defense's case was the evidence of police and prosecutorial misconduct in the case. The defense argued that the investigation was riddled by critical mistakes, both in the collection of evidence and the investigation of Boney as a suspect. The sweatshirt found at the crime scene revealed Charles Boney's DNA, his girlfriend's DNA, his prison nickname, and his department of corrections number. Kim Camm's shoes were also lined up on the top of the vehicle; Boney has a long history of fetish driven assaults that included the theft of shoes. It is unclear how the investigative team missed these pieces of evidence during the initial investigation. The defense team was told that the evidence had been thoroughly investigated. Errors in the investigation of Charles Boney The defense argued that the police should have also taken notice when Boney's story went through so many revisions. They noted that many details of his story were first suggested by police detectives in recorded interviews, notably the detail regarding the gun wrapped in the sweatshirt. Other details of his story were changed following discussions with detectives who pointed out the discrepancies. Defense witness Dr. Kim Rossmo, a criminal justice professor at Texas State University, testified that Boney was never investigated properly and that his claims were never independently verified. Instead of treating Boney like a suspect, \\"They treated him as an anomaly to their theory, that somehow had to be explained away\\", adding, \\"I think there were six different confessions from Mr. Boney. I don't think Boney ever told the truth about what happened... he's only telling the police enough to get around the last particular contradiction.\\" He testified that the majority of the oversights during the investigation were caused by confirmation bias: a tendency to believe information that confirms your preconceived notions and place less weight on information that doesn't. Rossmo argued that the police were swayed by the early misleading evidence and came to the conclusion that Camm was guilty before any of the forensic evidence was examined. He believes this phenomenon caused the investigators to ignore the DNA on the sweatshirt and when Boney was finally identified, they downplayed the significance and attempted to make it fit within their established theory of the crime. Ultimately, the jurors in the third trial believed the defense's criticisms of the investigation: \\"They tried to make the evidence fit their theory of the case,\\" a juror said in interview. Lead defense attorney Richard Kammen accused police of feeding Boney a false story designed to implicate Camm and coerce Boney into testify against Camm by playing on his fear of racial prejudice within the criminal justice system by telling him that a black man accused of killing a white family would get the death penalty if he didn't cooperate. During interrogations, he was reminded on several occasions of the likelihood of getting the death penalty on the basis of his race and that the best way to avoid the death penalty was to testify against David Camm. The defense cited a suspicious series of undocumented and unrecorded phone calls‚Äî33 in all‚Äîbetween Boney and the Floyd County Prosecutor's office in the two-week span between his DNA being identified and his arrest. Evidence tampering allegations Another allegation that surfaced involved a distant relative of Charles Boney named Myron Wilkerson. Wilkerson was a police officer but was not assigned to the case. He met with Boney privately at the station following his arrest. Two months later, it was learned that Wilkerson had removed Kim Camm's phone from the evidence room without signing it out and taken it to his residence. Witness tampering allegations In addition to testimony by Rob Stites alleging subornation of perjury, several other allegations of witness tampering surfaced during the case. Lynn Scamahorn, a DNA analyst from the Indiana State Police claimed that during the first trial former Floyd County Prosecutor Stan Faith threatened her when she refused to perjure herself that she found Camm's DNA on Charles Boney's sweatshirt. Fingerprint analyst John Singleton reported a similar encounter. He claims Faith wanted him to \\"shade the truth\\" while testifying regarding the then unidentified palm print on Kim Camm's Bronco later determined to belong to Charles Boney. The defense also accused the state of witness tampering and presenting false and misleading testimony regarding the molestation allegations. During the first trial, the prosecution alleged that the injuries Jill sustained happened during the attack, as testified to by the state medical examiner. During the second trial, they altered their timeline to implicate Camm instead of Boney on the basis of testimony by a single witness who changed their theory at the last minute. \\"Dr. Spivack, before in her deposition, told us that the injuries occurred near the time of death due to the painful nature of them. Today, on the stand, she backtracked to fit the state's theory.\\" said Defense attorney Stacy Uliana. Following the verdict, the jurors explained that they made their decision largely on the molestation allegations, specifically, the testimony of Spivack, who testified that the child was molested several hours prior to her death instead of during the attack. DNA analyst Lynn Scamahorn also claimed the prosecutor also attempted to get her to commit perjury by testifying that lab results indicate the comforter from the master bedroom in the Camm household contained vaginal secretions or saliva from Jill to help bolster their claims that Jill had been molested; no such test exists. The fraudulent testimony of Rob Stites and the attempted coercion of Lynne Scamahorne were featured in a forensic textbook called Forensic Fraud: Evaluating Law Enforcement and Forensic Science Cultures in the Context of Examiner Misconduct. Personal life Ryan Ferguson (left) and Bill Clutter of Investigating Innocence In December 2013, Camm gave his first local media interview following the verdict. Camm attempted to clear up the misconceptions regarding Boney's criminal history: \\"The thing that people need to know about Boney ... 11 previous felony convictions for assaulting women. That's what he's done his whole adult life: assault women. The three girls that he took hostage in Bloomington, Indiana. He held a gun to the girl's head and threatened to blow her head off. It's exactly what he did to Kim. He just went one step further.\\" Camm also announced that he had been hired as a case coordinator for Investigating Innocence, a national nonprofit that provides criminal-defense investigations for inmates. Camm reports that he has forged a friendship with the third-trial jurors. In early December 2013, he met with jurors from the third trial over dinner at a cafe in Lebanon, Indiana. Lawsuits David Camm is facing a civil suit filed by his late wife's parents over the estimated $625,000 Camm is set to collect from life insurance and Kim Camm's 401K fund. Frank and Janice Renn steadfastly maintain their belief in Camm's guilt. In May 2014, Camm served notice of his intention to sue Floyd County and the State of Indiana for $30 million. In January 2018, Camm's civil rights lawsuit against members of the Indiana State Police, prosecutors, and other officials, was dismissed by a US District Court. In explaining the ruling, the court explained it believed there was probable cause to charge Camm with murder and because of Indiana's Tort Claims Act, some of the defendants were immune to liability. On September 10, 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed the District Court in part stating, \\"In sum, we reverse and remand for trial on Camm‚Äôs Fourth Amendment claim against Stites, Englert, Faith, and Clemons to the extent that the claim rests on the first probable-cause affidavit. Trial is also warranted on the Brady claim against the same four defendants for suppression of Stites‚Äôs lack of qualifications and against Faith and Clemons for suppression of the facts surrounding their handling of the DNA profile on Boney‚Äôs sweatshirt. In all other respects, we affirm the judgment.\\" The reversal allowed Camm to sue for false arrest. In 2005, prosecution witness Rod Englert filed a lawsuit against several of the defense witnesses in the libel case. The lawsuit accused the defendants of saying Englert embellished his credentials, misrepresented his qualifications and experience, and provided false testimony in court. Englert had testified for the prosecution that Camm had high velocity blood spatter on the shirt he was wearing the night of the murders.

For alternative investments, this management is called \\"alternative beta\\". Alternative beta is the concept of managing volatile \\"alternative investments\\", often through the use of hedge funds. Alternative beta is often also referred to as \\"alternative risk premia\\". Researcher Lars Jaeger says that the return from an investment mainly results from exposure to systematic risk factors. These exposures can take two basic forms: long only \\"buy and hold\\" exposures and exposures through the use of alternative investment techniques such as long/short investing, the use of derivatives (non-linear payout profiles), or the employment of leverage) Background=Alternative investments Although alternative investment is a general term, (commonly defined as any investment other than stocks, bonds or cash), alternative beta relates to the use of hedge funds. At its most basic, a hedge fund is an investment vehicle that pools capital from a number of investors and invests in securities and other instruments.Gerald T. Lins, Thomas P. Lemke, Kathryn L. Hoenig & Patricia Schoor Rube, Hedge Funds and Other Private Funds: Regulation and Compliance ¬ß1:1 (2014 ed.). It is administered by a professional management firm, and often structured as a limited partnership, limited liability company, or similar vehicle. Volatility (\\"beta\\") For an investment that involves risk to be worthwhile, its returns must be higher than a risk-free investment. The risk is related to volatility. A measure of the factors influencing an investment's volatility is the beta. The beta is a measure of the risk arising from exposure to general market movements as opposed to idiosyncratic factors. A beta below 1 can indicate either an investment with lower volatility than the market, or a volatile investment whose price movements are not highly correlated with the market. An example of the first is a treasury bill: the price does not go up or down a lot, so it has a low beta. An example of the second is gold. The price of gold does go up and down a lot, but not in the same direction or at the same time as the market. A beta above 1 generally means that the asset both is volatile and tends to move up and down with the market. An example is a stock in a big technology company. Negative betas are possible for investments that tend to go down when the market goes up, and vice versa. There are few fundamental investments with consistent and significant negative betas, but some derivatives like equity put options can have large negative beta values. Investments with a high beta value are often called \\"beta investments\\", as opposed to \\"alpha investments\\" which typically have lower volatility and lower returns. Volatility and hedge funds Separating returns into alpha and beta can also be applied to determine the amount and type of fees to charge. The consensus is to charge higher fees for alpha (incl. performance fee), since it is mostly viewed as skill based. The topic has received increasing levels of attention due to the very rapid growth of the hedge fund industry, where investment companies typically charge fees higher than those of mutual funds, based on the assumption that hedge funds are alpha investments. Investors have started to question whether hedge funds are actually alpha investments, or just some ‚Äúnew‚Äù form of beta (i.e. alternative beta). This issue was raised in the 1997 paper \\"Empirical Characteristics of Dynamic Trading Strategies: The Case of Hedge Funds\\" by William Fung and David Hsieh. Following this paper, several groups of academics (such as Thomas Schneeweis et al.) started to explain past hedge fund returns using various systematic risk factors (i.e. Alternative Betas). Following this, a paper has discussed whether investable strategies based on such factors can not only explain past returns, but also replicate future ones. Different betas based on different investment exposures Traditional betas can be seen as those related to investments the common investor would already be experienced with (examples include stocks and most bonds). They are typically represented through indexation, and the techniques employed here are what is called ‚Äúlong only‚Äù. The definition of alternative beta in contrast requires the consideration of other investment techniques such as short selling, use of derivatives and leverage - techniques which are often associated with the activities of hedge funds. The underlying non- traditional investment risks are often seen as being riskier, as investors are less familiar with them. Alpha and investments and beta investments Viewed from the implementation side, investment techniques and strategies are the means to either capture risk premia (beta) or to obtain excess returns (alpha). Whereas returns from beta are a result of exposing the portfolio to systematic risks (traditional or alternative), alpha is an exceptional return that an investor or portfolio manager earns due to his unique skill, i.e. exploiting market inefficiencies. Academic studies as well as their performance in recent years strongly support the idea that the return from hedge funds mostly consists of (alternative) risk premia. This is the basis of the various approaches to replicate the return profile of hedge funds by direct exposures to alternative beta (hedge fund replication). Hedge fund replication There are currently two main approaches to replicate the return profile of hedge funds based on the idea of Alternative Betas: # directly extracting the risk premia (bottom up), an approach developed and advocated by Lars Jaeger # the factor-based approach based on Sharpe's factor models and developed for hedge funds first by professors Bill Fung (London Business School), David Hsieh (Fuqua School of Business, Duke University) et al.

He resigned on February 11, 2012. On February 13, he was crossed out of the parliamentary team of LAOS due to voting in favor of the Second Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece, against the party line. On 17 February 2012 Georgiadis joined New Democracy, having first given up his parliamentary seat to LAOS.

He also merged hospitals and closed unnecessary ones, curbed the cost of medicine and completed the reform of the National Primary Health Care Network, a reform that had been announced since 1979 but was never done. In September 2014 Georgiadis was appointed Parliamentary Spokesman for New Democracy. In the elections of January 2015 he was elected in the 2nd district of Athens with 70.853 votes and he was reelected in the September elections. He was one of the four candidates in the 2015‚Äì16 New Democracy leadership election. He campaigned for liberal reforms, tax cuts and cut of public spending and for an ideological battle with the Left, which he considers that it has an ideological hegemony. In the first round he got 11.40% (46,065 votes) and finished fourth. In the second round he supported Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who won the elections and became new President of New Democracy. On 18 January, he was appointed as one of the two Vice-Presidents of the party. Television Georgiadis often appeared on TeleAsty news programmes, a TV channel founded and run by LAOS' leader Georgios Karatzaferis, expressing the opinions of his party. On his daily programme Ellinon Egersis (Greek Uprising; Greek: ŒïŒªŒªŒÆŒΩœâŒΩ ŒàŒ≥ŒµœÅœÉŒπœÇ) on TeleAsty, along with his brother Leonidas he commented on current affairs, and advertised books of mainly historical and philological interest, both from his family publishing house Ekdoseis Georgiadi and other Greek publishers. He also publishes the magazine Elliniki Agogi (Greek Upbringing; Greek: ŒïŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒÆ ŒëŒ≥œâŒ≥ŒÆ), which covers issues of national and historical interest. An organization under the same name of Elliniki Agogi runs lessons of the Ancient Greek language. Work as an author As an author, Georgiadis has written a historical book titled Homosexuality in Ancient Greece: the Myth Collapses in which he argues that whereas homosexuality was present in Ancient Greece as in other countries, its extent and social acceptance have been inflated.Debunking the Myth of Homosexuality in Ancient Greece A review of Adonis Georgiadis' book However, in a 2015 TV show discussing his book, he claimed that \\"homosexuality did not exist in Ancient Greece\\". He had also previously written a Guide to Ancient Greek Coins. He has also written the historical novel Theodora Phranza: or, the Fall of Constantinople. Greek journalist Tasos Kostopoulos has claimed that this book is the product of plagiarism of a 19th-century English book by John Mason Neale. Moreover, according to Kostopoulos, Georgiadis added some characters to the English original, including Bartholomew, a Jewish advisor to the Sultan Mehmet. In the book, Bartholomew has the following dialogue with the Sultan: \\"You are a really valuable advisor. Had it not been for your advice, I do not know whether I would be here now, besieging Constantinople. You must really hate the Greeks, since you work so relentlessly for their destruction.\\" To which the Jew answers: \\"I hate them! Nobody in the world will be happier than I when Constantinople will fall to your hands.\\" Kostopoulos¬¥ claims were supported by a number of Greek journalists. Georgiadis reply was that he had never hidden he had adapted a previous work. Other activities * European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Ex-Officio Member of the Board of Governors (since 2019)Board of Governors European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). Political positions Georgiadis' speaking style might have a nuance of the more formal katharevousa. He also advocates the use of the polytonic system for writing the Greek language; Elliniki Agogi is written in this system, which is not the prevailing practice in Greek publishing from the 1980s. Georgiadis has called for more research to investigate whether the introduction of the monotonic system was beneficial or not to the Greek culture and education. Once appointed Deputy Minister for Development, Competitiveness and Shipping he changed the signs at his ministry to conform to the polytonic system. Georgiadis often condemns the opinions expressed in left-wing publications such as Eleftherotypia or by left-wing politicians such as those of Syriza, with both parties having exchanged sharp-tongued criticism. He also routinely condemned the policies of the two former leading Greek parties, New Democracy and the Panhellenic Socialist Movement, which he viewed as two sides of the same coin. He has often used the term tholokoultoura (Greek: Œ∏ŒøŒªŒøŒ∫ŒøœÖŒªœÑŒøœçœÅŒ±; hazy-culture) to group his left-wing ideological opponents: He often states that the destruction of the Greek economy and Greek society began in 1981 with the election of Andreas Papandreou as PM and the party of PASOK. During the recent 2015-16 New Democracy leadership election, he accused Syriza of being \\"a second-time PASOK\\". He described himself as \\"liberal\\" in economic matters, while often stated that is necessary to break the \\"hegemony of the Left on the ideas\\" inside the Greek society. He stated \\"I want to be in Greece, what Nicolas Sarkozy is in France\\", while rejected the policies of Marine Le Pen and her euroscepticism as anti-European. Another case of criticism to the Left from Georgiadis' side is about the educational system, and especially the universities system. According to him, the leftists dominate the Greek universities. He has many times expressed his will for the abolition of the \\"university asylum\\" (laws that forbid to the Greek police the entry to a Greek university), stating that it is only a tool for the anarchists to burn and destroy the Greek universities.Œü ŒÜŒ¥œâŒΩŒπœÇ ŒìŒµœâœÅŒ≥ŒπŒ¨Œ¥Œ∑œÇ œÄœÅœåœÇ Indymedia: ¬´Œ∫œçœÅŒπŒøŒπ œÑŒøœÖ Indymedia, œÑœÅŒµœáŒ¨œÑŒµ œÄŒøŒ¥Œ±œÅŒ¨Œ∫ŒπŒ± ŒºŒøœÖ Œ≥ŒπŒ±œÑŒØ œÉŒ±œÇ œÄŒªŒ∑œÉŒπŒ¨Œ∂ŒøœÖŒºŒµ¬ª Georgiadis is in favour of putting an end to Greece's \\"eternal students\\", people who have been enrolled at university for years without graduating.

In January 2017, at the Holocaust memorial day, he asked for public apology that he had \\"coexisted and tolerated the views of people who showed disrespect\\" to the Greek Jews and who \\"supported [and] promoted his abusive book Costas Pleuri \\". Regarding the Athens Polytechnic Uprising, Georgiadis has claimed that \\"there was no one dead inside the Polytechnic School, not a single one! The Polytechnic Uprising is the foundational political myth of the ideological domination of the Left in Greece. They got the police report of the previous day, of the same day and of the next day and whoever died in Attica of whatever reason became a victim of snipers.\\" His statements have been criticized by the media. Syriza has called Georgiadis's claims an \\"ahistorical abjection\\". On 16 November 2017, Georgiadis announced that he would cease working as a telemarketer. A few days earlier he came under intense criticism after it was revealed that the healing effects supposedly provided by the nanotechnological jackets that he was promoting were in fact void and based on pseudoscience. Fellow telemarketer Makis Triandafillopoulos had been previously convicted of fraud for selling exactly the same model of nano jackets following an investigation by the Greek consumer protection agency. Attacks against Georgiadis' bookstore One of the bookstores of Georgiadis publishers (Ekdoseis Georgiadi), in the Exarcheia district of Athens, has been targeted and burnt 17 times by unidentified far- leftist opponents. Georgiadis has since moved this bookstore, stating that he did so to protect the anti-riot police that was tasked to protect his business. Nonetheless, a different bookstore of the same publisher was targeted on 15 February 2007, the eighth attack against bookstores of Ekdoseis Georgiadi. In November 2012, Georgiadis closed down his bookshop.

The family moved from Maine to New York City where his father ran the family's mercantile firm Chapman & Flint, which had been founded in 1837.Stinson, John: The Charles Ranlett Flint Papers, 1872-1930 , New York Public Library, November 1991. Business career In 1868, Charles Flint graduated from Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute (now New York University - Tandon School of Engineering) in Brooklyn, and in 1871 entered the shipping business as a partner in Gilchrest, Flint & Co., and later W.R. Grace & Co. after a merger. From 1876 to 1879, he served as the Chilean consul at New York City. He also served as consul general to the United States for Nicaragua and Costa Rica. In 1892, he consolidated several companies to form U.S. Rubber. In 1893, he fitted out a fleet of naval ships for Brazilian Republic. He purchased the Esmeralda from Chilean Navy and delivered it via Ecuador to Japan during the First Sino-Japanese War. In 1899 he repeated the same with Adams Chewing Gum, Chiclets, Dentyne, and Beemans to form American Chicle. He was also responsible for the formation of American Woolen in 1899.

He graduated in civil engineering from the NED University of Engineering and Technology in 1962, and has been working as a visual artist bridging life, art and activism since his arrival in London from Pakistan in 1964.  Art Career  Araeen was pursuing a career as an engineer in Karachi when he was first exposed to avant-garde art. This arrived through two channels: imported Western books and magazines and contact with Pakistani contemporary artists. Consequently, he decided to pursue art-making and embarked on a second career.Rasheed Araeen, \\"From Primitivism to Ethnic Arts.\\" In Susan Hiller (ed.), The Myth of Primitivism, London and New York: Routledge, 1991, p. 160. Upon arriving in London in 1964, he began working as an artist without any formal training, producing sculptures influenced by Minimalism and the work of Anthony Caro alongside his engineering experience. By his own account, works created or imagined in this period such as Chakras (1969-1970) and Zero to Infinity (1968-2004), while using basic structural units such as cubes, lattice and discs, were process-based and open to transformation by \\"the creative energy of the collective\\". Concepts of this period would make ripple effects throughout his career, both formally and politically. Chakras, the 16 red painted circular discs released on the water from Saint Katherine's Deck in 1970, would later evolve and give rise to the concept of Disco Sailing (1970-74), a new form between floating sculpture and dance. The work was revisited and resurrected many times through the decades and performed most recently at Garage Museum in Moscow in 2019. Starting from the 1970s Araeen was increasingly concerned with questions of Postcolonialism as he struggled with the Eurocentrism of institutions. Centering around issues of identity, representation and racial violence, he created the performance Paki Bastard, Portrait of The Artist as a Black Person (1977) using video projection, live performance and sound. He complemented this with writing statements and manifestos, which he considered to be a \\"textual form of art\\". He also often traveled back to Karachi and make frequent visits to Baluchistan as a \\"return to the source\\". These travels have prompted in interest around land art and environmental issues described as \\"Ecoaesthetics\\" in his 2010 publication Art Beyon Art. Araeen participated in Les Magiciens de la Terre (1989); 2nd Johannesburg Biennale (1997), 11th Biennale of Sydney (1998), 9th Shanghai Biennale (212), 9th Gwangju Biennale (2012)\\"Announcing the 90 artists in ROUNDTABLE: The 9th Gwangju Biennale\\", e-flux., 57th Venice Biennale (2017) and documenta 14 (2017). In December 2017 a major retrospective of Araeen's work which spotted 60 years of his work was presented at Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven and then toured to MAMCO in Geneva, the BALTIC in Gateshead, and Garage Museum in Moscow. \\"RASHEED ARAEEN A Retrospective, curated by Nick Aikens\\".  Publishing  Araeen's artistic activity has been complemented by writing and publishing. He founded and began editing the journal Black Phoenix in 1978, which came to an abrupt end after three issues. In 1987 he founded the groundbreaking journal Third Text. Third World Perspectives on Contemporary Art and Culture, dealing with art, the Third World, Postcolonialism and ethnicity. In the first decade of its publication, the main aim was to reveal \\"the institutional closures of the art world and the artists they included, the second began the inquiry into the emergent phenomenon first signaled by the notorious show Magiciens de la terre of the assimilation of the exotic other into the new world art,\\" as Sean Cubitt summarized the goals in the Third Text Reader in 2002. In 1999 Araeen spoke about his own journal Third Text as an attempt to \\"demolish the boundaries that separate art and art criticism\\". Some of Araeen's contributions to Third Text were \\"From Primitivism to Ethnic Arts / & / Why Third Text?\\", Third Text #1, Autumn 1987; \\"Our Bauhaus Others' Mudhouse\\" [the Magiciens de la terre issue], Third Text #6, Spring 1989 and \\"Modernity, Modernism and Africa's Authentic Voice\\", Third Text Vol 24 #2, 2010. Araeen founded Third Text Asia in 2008. The journal published three issues before ceasing activity.  Activism and Institutional Critique  Araeen has been among the first cultural practitioners to voice since the early 1970s the need of artists of African, Latin American and Asian origins to be represented in British cultural institutions. His approach allowed him to shape his ideas through a number of different media: he curated exhibitions; initiated and published a number of journals, produced art installations and community-based artistic projects. Prior to founding the journal Black Phoenix, in 1972, he joined the Black Panther Movement and wrote \\"Preliminary Notes For A Black Manifesto\\" in 1975-76. In the years that followed, he became an important figure in establishing a black voice in the British arts through his activities as a publisher, writer, and artist. In 1988 he curated the exhibition The Essential Black Art. This provided a foretaste of The Other Story, a larger 1989 exhibition featuring artists including Araeen himself, Frank Bowling, Sonia Boyce, Eddie Chambers, Uzo Egonu, Mona Hatoum, Lubaina Himid, Gavin Jantjes, Donald Locke, David Medalla, Ronald Moody, Ahmed Parvez, Ivan Peries, Keith Piper, F. N. Souza and Aubrey Williams. A groundbreaking exhibition of British African, Caribbean and Asian modernism, The Other Story was mounted at the Hayward Gallery, South Bank Centre, and went on to Wolverhampton Art Gallery and Manchester City Art Gallery and Cornerhouse.\\"The Other Story - exhibition\\", Diaspora Artists. In 2001 he was invited by the Kunsthaus Bregenz in Austria to publish his institutional critique of the present art museum in the publication The Museum as Arena. Araeen published the outcome of his private correspondence with the Ikon Gallery in Birmingham, which had asked him to join an exhibition in 1980 (also published in Rasheed Araeen, Making Myself Visible). His proposal was declined when the other ten artists refused to show their work alongside his. Their opposition not only manifested cultural conflicts, but was also meant to defend the purity of the gallery space where Araeen had proposed to perform the slaughter and consumption of a goat (according to a Muslim ritual). Along with the actual performance, he had announced that he would display and tear up \\"the pages of a contemporary art history book\\". Thus, the action directed against the exclusionary aesthetics of the art gallery was complemented with a rejection of the official story of modernist art and avant-garde history. In 2019 he opened Shamiyaana, a restaurant/space where people can enjoy simple, vibrant, nourishing, low-cost food in an environment purpose-designed for conversation and eating.

(2000) Karri forest in microcosm : William Bay National Park. Landscope (Como, W.A), Spring 2000, p. 42-47 The Warren region is also known as the Karri Forest Region, but this is a misnomer, as only about half of the region is vegetated with karri forest. From the 1880s onward, karri forest supported timber and firewood industries when access to the forest was improved by a network of the state's railway lines. Small settlements such as Karridale, Deanmill and Pemberton were established around timber mills, and have since become centres for regional tourism. Some of the remaining areas of karri forest are now protected in reserves such as Brockman National Park, Warren National Park, Beedelup National Park, and Gloucester National Park. Ecology of the karri forest Karri forest is found on loamy soils, but may include wetlands, river edges, heathland and rocky outcrops. Leaf litter (i.e. twigs, leaves and branches which fall from trees to the ground) plays a substantial role in nutrient recycling and has been measured at 9.45 tonnes per hectare in mature forest. Leaf litter fall and nutrient cycling of calcium, potassium and magnesium in mature forest is the highest reported for any eucalypt forest. The understorey of karri forest is dense and may reach a height of 10m, according to the conditions of the site and time since the last fire. Understorey leaf material contributes between 30 and 70% of the nutrients by weight, and is particularly important in the cycling of major plant nutrients nitrogen and sulfur, and micro-nutrients copper and zinc.

The painting was one of many done for surrealist patron and Magritte supporter Edward James. This was the second painting delivered to James for his London ballroom. The first was the portrait of James, Not to be Reproduced. Time Transfixed was purchased by the Art Institute from James in 1970 when he was raising capital to build his surrealist sculpture garden Las Pozas.

The artist's perspective The title of the painting translates to English literally as Ongoing Time Stabbed by a Dagger, and Magritte was reportedly unhappy with the generally accepted translation of Time Transfixed. Magritte hoped that James would hang the painting at the base of his staircase so that the train would \\"stab\\" guests on their way up to the ballroom. James instead chose to hang the painting above his own fireplace. Magritte described his motivation for this painting: :\\"I decided to paint the image of a locomotive...

The principal trends of Dr. Martynenko‚Äôs scientific research include an economic sociology and political sociology, investigation of the socio-structuring value of monetary relations and a critical analysis of Marxism and vulgarization of liberal theories.  Principal research results  In his research activity Dr. Martynenko has sought to: * investigate the contradictions and revise the scientific stock of knowledge in political philosophy and political sociology against the present-day socio-political realities, expose some conceptual gaps in social development; evolve a new social ontology, epistemology and research methodology for analysing a state and civil society and a political identification of social historic forms and prospects for a social revolution; * develop some new inter-disciplinary trends in scientific research such as sociology of monetary policy and ‚Äúmonetary authorities‚Äù, a political sociology of monetary relations and banking activity; evolve a theory of the credit nature for forming legal relations in a society and a concept of money as a category of social law; expose a socio-political value of de-monopolization of currency issue; * evolve a theory of social insurance as a basic system component for social state functions in order to minimize the risk of social disintegration, widen the socially significant credit relations and secure the well-balanced socio-economic development of a society.  Principal scientific publications  In his books ‚ÄúThe Sociology of Monetary Relations‚Äù (2004) and ‚ÄúThe Unknown Policy of the Bank of Russia‚Äù (2004) Dr. Martynenko was the first to present an entirely new approach to an analysis of virtual money characteristics and evolution of money forms, offer a new socially conditioned concept of monetary policy and secure a stable monetary-and-credit system. He formulated and theoretically substantiated some concrete measures aimed at transforming the role and place of monetary authorities in a common system for dividing them as a prerequisite for developing a civil society and overcoming internal contradictions of a democratic state system. In his book ‚ÄúThe Unknown Policy of the Bank of Russia‚Äù (2004), Dr. Martynenko made an overall analysis of the aims and methods used by Russia in a monetary policy in the early 1990s and of its socio-economic and political aftermath. He criticized the activity and ideology of the Central Bank of Russia and the Russian Government in a monetary sphere including the formation of an effective banking system and interaction of the Central Bank of Russia with commercial banks. The author suggests an entirely new concept for carrying out a currency issue which supposes a refusal of any provision for a currency issue by the Central Bank of Russia. On the contrary, the volumes of currency issue released by the Central Bank of Russia must themselves serve as a provision (through refunding and deposit insurance) for credit-and-monetary issues of commercial banks. The currency issue of the Central Bank of Russia must be used to meet the current monetary liabilities of commercial banks before creditors and depositors. The results of developing the methodology for exposing social indicators which characterize the transformation of the policy pursued by the authorities out of the socially claimed indicators into the economically unjustified ones published in the book ‚ÄúIdeology vs. Economics‚Äù (2005) is an important stage in scientific and research activity. This process leads to the loss of inner resources and its renewal by the political system. His book ‚ÄúThe Caldera of State Power‚Äù (2005) offers an insight into the essence and a dual role of the state and inner peculiarities and contradictions of the given category and is an important scientific work. Therein, Dr. Martynenko also presents some methods for evaluating socially significant decisions adopted by the state power and their conformity to the objective needs and opportunities offered by the balanced socio-economic development. This book is a fundamental investigation of the theoretical and practical interaction of political and civil societies including the political, economic, and social aspects of financial and monetary relations. Martyenko offers some concepts and practical recommendations for optimizing the functions of executive, legislative, legal and also of ‚Äúmonetary‚Äù authorities. Pride of place in this book is assigned to the analysis of inner contradictions of the Marxist theory. The afore- mentioned concepts and substantiation of the given recommendations have been developed further by the author in his subsequent scientific papers and books such as ‚ÄúThe Social Epistemology and Politics‚Äù (2008), ‚ÄúThe Social Matrix of a Political Knowledge‚Äù (2008) and ‚ÄúA Civil Society: From Political Speculations and Ideological Mist to a Social Knowledge and Deliberate Option‚Äù (2008). These books detail the contents of some new interdisciplinary trends in social research and substantiate the necessity for their profound scientific development. Dr. Martynenko exposes the theory of credit nature for forming socials rights and social insurance system and a social meaning of monetary authorities and currency issue. He also presents a new socially conditioned reading of money as a category for the formation of social subjects‚Äô rights and obligations in a society. The author reveals the socio-political significance of a historic evolution of monetary forms, clarifies its contents, specifies the aims and methods for pursuing a social politics and strategy of social insurance, their role in a systematic guarantee of the balanced socio-economic development and prevention of the risk of social disintegration. This book also explains the reasons for socio-political transformations and concepts of a civil society, outlines the circumstances which helped stimulate a scientific and practical interest in the problems of the present-day civil society. The book ‚ÄúThe Offensive Polytology. The Fundamentals and Peculiarities of a Political Science‚Äù (2010) is noted for its special scientific significance in the solution of conceptual problems in polytology and sociology. This book assesses the theoretical legacy in political philosophy, political sociology, political economy and sociology and outlines the key trends and methodology for interdisciplinary political research.

He was born in Killorglin, Ireland, and emigrated to the U.S. when he was a child, his family settling in Holyoke, Massachusetts. Playing career After attending Fordham University, he embarked on a baseball career that would last 70 years. He made his first appearance at the major league level by signing and playing two years for the Columbus Solons of the American Association. Doyle would play for ten clubs from to , batting .299 in 1,569 games with 518 stolen bases. He began as a catcher-outfielder and became a first baseman in . His best years were in 1894, when he batted .367 for the New York Giants, and in , when he hit .354 with 62 stolen bases for the Baltimore Orioles. He is credited with being the first pinch-hitter in pro ball, with Cleveland at Brooklyn on June 7, . Patsy Tebeau was the manager and Doyle came through with a game-winning single. For the season, he took over the everyday duties at first base and became team captain . Manager John Montgomery Ward not only make the decision to replace his former teammate and friend Roger Connor, but released him as well. Connor was a very popular player, and this decision drew the ire and scrutiny from the fans and media alike. Ward defended his decision, and claimed the move came down to the fact that he liked Doyle's playing style, describing him as a hustler.A Clever Base-Ballist: The Life and Times of John Montgomery Ward, pg. 352, by Bryan Di Salvatore Replacing Connor at first base proved worth the risk as Jack batted .367 that season, and he totaled 100 runs batted in, and stole 42 bases. Dirty Jack Because of his aggressive playing style, Doyle was known as \\"Dirty Jack\\", often feuding with umpires, fans, opposing players, and even, at times, his own teammates. On one occasion, in Cincinnati on July 4, , while in the 3rd inning of the second game of a doubleheader, Doyle slugged umpire Bob Emslie after being called out on a steal attempt. Fans jumped from the stands as the two got into it, and players finally separated the two fighters. Two policemen chased the fans back into the stands and then arrested and fined Doyle. On July 1, , when he was being harassed by a Polo Grounds fan, he jumped into the stands and hit him once with his left hand, reinjuring it after having broken it several weeks earlier. He carried on a lengthy feud with John McGraw that started when they were teammates at Baltimore. McGraw, of course, had to have the last word. In , McGraw was appointed manager of the Giants, and his first act was to release Doyle, even though he was batting .301 and fielding .991 at the time. Even with these seemingly out-of-control traits, Doyle was deemed a natural leader and was selected as team captain in New York, Brooklyn and Chicago, and served as an interim manager for the Giants in and Washington Senators in . Minor league success In 1905, after playing one game with the New York Highlanders, Doyle became manager of Toledo of the Western Association. One year later, in , he was named the manager of the Des Moines Champions, so named because they won the league championship the previous year, and they won it again under Doyle's helm. Following his championship season at Des Moines, he managed Milwaukee in Other career capacities In 1908‚Äì09, the only years of his adult life spent outside of baseball, he served as police commissioner of his hometown of Holyoke. Doyle returned to the game as an umpire and worked in the National League for 42 games in . Later on he would join the Chicago Cubs as a scout in . In his many years with the Cubs, Doyle was credited with signing or recommending the acquisition of such stars as Gabby Hartnett, Hack Wilson, Billy Herman, Stan Hack, Bill Jurges, Charlie Root, Bill Lee, Augie Galan, Riggs Stephenson and Phil Cavarretta.

History The West Indies became a self-governing province in 1883 because of the Church of England missions in territories that became British colonies. It is made up of two mainland dioceses and six island dioceses, including Barbados, Belize, Guyana, Jamaica, the Bahamas, the North-Eastern Caribbean and Aruba, Trinidad and Tobago, and the Windward Islands. Great emphasis is being placed on training personnel for an indigenous ministry. The island locations and scattered settlements make pastoral care difficult and costly. Mission Organisations The Jamaica Church Missionary Society is the recognised missionary agency of the Diocese of Jamaica and the Cayman Islands in the Province of the West Indies. The society focuses on evangelisation with special relevance to daily human needs. The society was established in 1861 as a subsidiary of the church, intended to target those sections of Jamaica's \\"hard to reach\\" population.

The two connected stories were first published in Japan by Futabasha in Weekly Manga Action in 2003 and 2004, then collected in a single tank≈çbon volume in 2004. The story is about a family of survivors of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. The author based the characters on people who were in Hiroshima or Nagasaki. Town of Evening Calm, Country of Cherry Blossoms was adapted as a live-action film directed by Kiyoshi Sasabe released in 2007, called Yunagi City, Sakura Country in English. It has also been adapted as a novel by Kei Kunii and as a radio drama produced in 2006. The manga has received international praise for its simple but beautiful artwork and its quiet but \\"humane\\" anti-war message. It received the Grand Prize for manga at the 2004 Japan Media Arts Festival and the 2005 Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize Creative Award. Kumiko As≈ç won several acting awards for her portrayal of Minami Hirano, one of the two protagonists, in the film adaptation. Plot Town of Evening Calm, Country of Cherry Blossoms comprises two stories, \\"Town of Evening Calm\\" and \\"Country of Cherry Blossoms\\". Town of Evening Calm (Y≈´nagi no Machi) Set in Hiroshima in 1955, ten years after the atomic bomb was dropped, \\"Town of Evening Calm\\" is the story of a young woman, Minami Hirano, who survived the bomb when she was in her early teens. She lives with her mother, Fujimi, in a shanty-town near downtown, having lost her father and two sisters to the bomb; her younger brother, Asahi, was evacuated to Mito, Ibaraki, where he was adopted by his aunt. Fujimi is a seamstress while Minami, who is \\"all thumbs\\" as her mother puts it, works as a clerk in an office, and together they are saving money for the trip to Mito to visit Asahi. One of her co-workers, Yutaka Uchikoshi, cares for Minami and visits her shanty when she misses work because her mother is sick. He later gives her a pair of sandals made by his mother and a handkerchief, but when he tries to kiss her, she has a flashback where she sees the victims of the bombing where they now stand and pushes him away. She runs off, still reliving the horrors of the attack, including finding her little sister's blackened body and watching her older sister die of radiation poisoning two months later. The next day at the office, she apologizes to Uchikoshi, saying she wants to somehow put the past behind her. She spends the day exhausted, however, and the next day becomes bedridden from the long-term effects of radiation poisoning. As Minami's condition worsens, she is visited by Uchikoshi and other co-workers, and dies just as her brother and aunt arrive. Country of Cherry Blossoms (Sakura no Kuni) \\"Country of Cherry Blossoms\\" is a story in two parts. Part one is set in 1987 in Tokyo. At the start of fifth grade, Nanami Ishikawa, the daughter of Minami's brother Asahi (and thus second-generation atomic bomb victim), is a tomboy nicknamed \\"Goemon\\" by her classmates, to her disgust. At baseball practice, she gets a bloody nose after being hit by a ball, after which she skips practice to visit her brother Nagio in the hospital, where he is being treated for asthma. On the way, she meets her best friend and next-door neighbor, a feminine girl named Toko Tone, who loans her subway fare and accompanies her. In Nagio's hospital room, they toss cherry blossom petals that Nanami collected into the air, to give him the experience of spring that he's missing. Nanami is scolded by her grandmother for visiting Nagio when she's not supposed to. That summer, her grandmother, Asahi's mother, Fujimi, dies, and that fall Nanami loses touch with Toko after her family moves closer to Nagio's hospital. Part two takes place 17 years later, in 2004. Nanami, now working as an office lady, lives with her recently retired father. One day Nagio, who recently graduated from medical school, tells Nanami he ran into Toko as a nurse at the hospital where he is interning. Nanami tells him she's worried their father's going senile because he has started wandering off for a couple days at a time without explanation. One evening, Nanami follows Asahi as he leaves the apartment, and while she tails him runs into Toko and together they follow him onto an overnight bus to Hiroshima. In the morning, they follow as he visits several people before Toko leaves to visit the Peace Park. Asahi visits his family grave, then sits by the riverside, and while waiting Nanami discovers in the jacket of Toko's borrowed jacket a letter from Nagio to Toko, saying that her family asked him to stop seeing her as they believe his asthma is a result of the atomic bomb. In a flashback, Asahi recalls the riverbank as a shantytown, then remembers meeting Kyoka Ota, a neighborhood girl his mother hired to help her after Minami died, when he returns to Hiroshima to start college. Asahi begins tutoring Kyoka because her teachers believe she is stupid due to the atomic bomb. When Toko finds Nanami by the river, Toko is upset to the point of illness by what she saw at the Peace Memorial Museum, and Nanami finds them a hotel room and cares for her, even though she has flashbacks to seeing her mother's last illness when she was a young child. In another flashback, Asahi proposes to a grown Kyoka, against his mother's wishes, as Kyoka was exposed to the bomb. On the ride back to Tokyo, Nanami arranges for Nagio to meet her and Toko, then leaves them alone together. Asahi tells Nanami he visited Hiroshima for the 49th anniversary of Minami's death, and that Nanami resembles her. Development The effects of atomic bombing on Hiroshima According to Fumiyo K≈çno's afterword, she was prompted to write Town of Evening Calm, Country of Cherry Blossoms when her editor asked her for a Hiroshima story. She was initially reluctant because, while she was born in Hiroshima neither she nor anyone in her family was a survivor of the atomic bomb, and growing up she found the subject upsetting and had tried to avoid it ever since. She decided to tackle the subject because she felt it was \\"unnatural and irresponsible for me to consciously try to avoid the issue.\\" Living in Tokyo, she had come to realize that people outside of Hiroshima and Nagasaki didn't know about the effects of the bomb, not because they were avoiding the subject but because it is never talked about, and so she attempted the story because \\"drawing something is better than drawing nothing at all.\\" K≈çno described \\"Country of Cherry Blossoms\\" as \\"what I most needed to hear two years ago, when I still avoided anything to do with the atomic bomb.\\" Media=Manga Town of Evening Calm, Country of Cherry Blossoms was serialized in Japan by Futabasha in two parts in the seinen (aimed at younger adult men) manga magazine Weekly Manga Action in September 2003 and July 2004.

It is composed by Takatsugu Muramatsu, with performances on the harp by Naori Uchida and harmonica by Masami Ohishi. Reception The story was praised by the award jury of the Japan Media Arts Festival for its brevity and its \\"depiction of 'the dark shadow of war'\\". According to Izumi Evers, one of the editors of the English edition, the Japanese edition created a sensation despite being little-promoted because it made readers want to talk about the bombing of Hiroshima, which is a controversial topic. The manga sold over 180,000 copies in Japan. The simple artwork and story's \\"light, ephemeral touch\\" was praised by Dirk Deppey in The Comics Journal, and PopCultureShock called the character designs \\"slightly rough, clumsy\\", which they consider makes the characters \\"more human and more believable\\" because they are \\"more vulnerable, more imperfect, more fragile\\". PopCultureShock also praised the background art, which \\"bring[s] the streets of Hiroshima to vivid life\\". Manga News described the apparently simplistic art as beautiful, which emphasizes the story's depth without ever going over-the-top or into excess morality. Comic World News called the story \\"humane\\" and \\"profoundly moral\\", and praised the characterization as being \\"real\\". Otaku USA described the scenes of daily life as \\"welcoming\\" and the art \\"lovely\\", saying the \\"antiwar message is unspoken, and comes naturally from the desire not to see the characters die.\\" A review at About.com described it as a \\"deeply moving story\\" that's \\"told in whispers rather than screams,\\" and praised K≈çno for resisting \\"the urge to pile on the melodrama\\" and so conveying \\"a deeply moving story.\\" Manga: The Complete Guide called the work \\"a beautiful manga and an understated antiwar statement\\", praising its \\"dreamlike and evocative\\" stories and its artwork, especially the \\"lovely\\" backgrounds. Publishers Weekly named the English translation one of the best ten manga of 2007, calling it \\"too important to pass up\\" and comparing it to Barefoot Gen, and New York Magazine named it one of the top five comics in English of 2007. The American Library Association placed the manga on its list of \\"Great Graphic Novels for Teens 2008\\". It was nominated for an Eisner Award in two categories, Best Short Story for \\"Town of Evening Calm\\" and Best U.S. Edition of International Material‚ÄîJapan, but lost to \\"Mr. Wonderful\\" by Dan Clowes and Tekkonkinkreet respectively. According to Patrick Macias, an English editor of the manga, the film was \\"kind of ignored\\" at Cannes because of competition from other high-profile Japanese films. According to a review in Asia Pacific Arts, during the sequence when the father returns to Hiroshima, the film shows \\"an interaction\\" of the past, present, and future, which is indicative of \\"the slipperiness of memory\\", a technique that \\"makes more visible and effective the ongoing resonance of the past in the present\\" but that \\"rejects the politics of the bombing\\" of the first part of the film. Kumiko As≈ç won several acting awards in Japan for her role as Minami Hirano. Awards The manga has won two awards, the 2004 Japan Media Arts Festival's Grand Prize for manga and the 2005 Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize's Creative Award. The film won several awards, including the 17th Japanese Film Critics Award for Best Picture, placing sixth in the top ten films list of the 3rd Osaka Cinema Festival, and placing ninth in the top ten domestic films list of 2007 by Kinema Junpo. The Blue Ribbon Awards also named the film one of the top ten films of the year. Kumiko As≈ç won several \\"Best Actress\\" awards for her portrayal of Minami Hirano in the film, including that of the 32nd Hochi Film Awards, the 62nd Mainichi Film Awards, and the 50th Blue Ribbon Awards.

Another philosopher who shaped the thought of Fishacre was Avicenna. Like him Fishacre thought that the soul and body are distinct substances. The Oxford Dominican accepted universal hylomorphism without doubt. Fishacre is uncertain, as were his Oxford colleagues, concerning the unity or plurality of forms in the soul.

The episode was aired on 10 February 2007 as a pilot for the series. The pilot became a success and was picked up before the series was aired. Plot At night. An Inostrancevia emerges from the Forest of Dean pursuing Dr. Helen Cutter. Unable to find shelter in a nearby closed supermarket, Helen flees back into the forest. With no witnesses to her disappearance, she is presumed dead. Eight years pass. At Central Metropolitan University, graduate student Connor Temple approaches his tutor in evolutionary zoology, Professor Nick Cutter, and Cutter's assistant, Stephen Hart, with a newspaper photograph of a Therapsid-like creature. Cutter initially dismisses it as a hoax, but decides to investigate upon learning that the sighting took place in the Forest of Dean, where his wife disappeared. At the Forest of Dean, Cutter, Stephen, and Connor find evidence of a large and powerful predator. They are joined in their search by Claudia Brown, a junior-level agent from the Home Office sent to investigate the monster sighting. Meanwhile, reptile specialist and London zookeeper Abby Maitland investigates the origins of an exotic lizard named Rex. Abby and the lizard's owner, Ben Trent, take Rex into the Forest of Dean. They discover the body of a cow lodged high in a tree and are separated when Ben panics and runs. Abby and Rex are forced to hide for the Inostrancevia, while Ben encounters an anomaly and briefly looks through it into the past. The two investigations merge when Abby encounters Cutter, Connor, Stephen, Claudia, and a full-grown Scutosaurus in the woods. They question Ben about his time in the woods and, based on his story that he ‚Äúsaw the past,‚Äù Cutter intentionally frightens the Scutosaurus and it leads them to the anomaly. A Home Office team led by government official Sir James Lester takes control of the investigation and takes Cutter, Abby, and Rex to a Home Office building. Cutter proposes that the anomaly leads back to Earth during the late Permian period and convinces Lester to permit an exploratory foray into the anomaly. At the Forest of Dean, Cutter travels through the anomaly with SAS Captain Tom Ryan and returns Rex to his home period. They discover the remains of a human encampment, a male human skeleton, and a camera engraved with Helen's initials. Cutter wants to stay and look for her but Ryan forces him back through the anomaly. Rex also sneaks back through the anomaly to present-day Earth. In the present-day world, the Inostrancevia attacks the group and is eventually killed. Later, the film from the camera is developed, showing pictures of Helen in the Permian landscape. Lester seems satisfied that the crisis is resolved, but Cutter is convinced that the situation is far from over. Cutter returns to his office at the Central Metropolitan University and catches sight of Helen, but she vanishes before he reaches her.

The destabilizing action of an earthquake on constructions may be direct (seismic motion of the ground) or indirect (earthquake-induced landslides, liquefaction of the foundation soils and waves of tsunami). Knowledge of local amplification of the seismic motion from the bedrock is very important in order to choose the suitable design solutions. Local amplification can be anticipated from the presence of particular stratigraphic conditions, such as soft soil overlapping the bedrock, or where morphological settings (e.g. crest zones, steep slopes, valleys, or endorheic basins) may produce focalization of the seismic event. The identification of the areas potentially affected by earthquake-induced landslides and by soil liquefaction can be made by geological survey and by analysis of historical documents. Even quiescent and stabilized landslide areas may be reactivated by severe earthquake. Young soil may be particularly susceptible to liquefaction.

He was introduced in OMAC #1 (July 2006). Fictional character biography Michael Costner, a seventeen- year-old petty thief, spent his entire life in Gotham City; first as an orphan in care of the local orphanotrophy,OMAC (vol. 3) #2 (October 2006) then scraping his life on the streets, stealing to sate his addiction to heroin. While still at the orphanotrophy, Michael was infected with the OMAC nanovirus through a contaminated flu-vaccine shot. However, Brother Eye never activated him during the Infinite Crisis events, having lost contact with him as Michael began a life off the grid. Instead, in prevision of a victory by the metahumans, Brother Eye kept Michael as a \\"sleeper agent\\", the last unit to be activated only in times of dire need. Brother Eye's downfall, at the hands of Sasha Bordeaux, signaled that moment. Brother Eye, now spliced between a NORAD hard drive containing the bulk of his core programming and a backup satellite orbiting the Earth, activated Michael, incidentally saving him from a round- up. The Michael-OMAC reveals himself to be problematic from the first moments of being online. While other OMACs had no personality, nor qualms about being used as killing machines, the Michael-OMAC actually rebelled against his programming upon being ordered to kill a female policewomanOMAC (vol. 3) #1 (September 2006) who was an associate and love interest of Michael. It was later hypothesized that Michael, with his personality submerged by the OMAC programming, actually relived moral imperatives and \\"school yard rules\\" from Michael's subconscious, such as \\"never hitting the girls\\".OMAC (vol. 3) #6 (February 2007) Despite the obvious inconsistencies in his programming, Brother Eye, having no other choices, still trusted Michael to steal the hard drive from NORAD and upload it, along with part of the nanovirus source code, into the backup satellite, restarting the OMAC project at full capacity. Along the way, he was forced to battle Firestorm and Cyborg, once again pulling his punches to avoid hurting Firehawk. Deeply resenting Brother Eye for forcing him to kill and for stealing his personality, Michael flies to outer space, taking enough control of his OMAC form to jettison the Nomac drive and the damaged Brother Eye. Enraged, Brother Eye casts him on Earth. Vienna Barstow While on the run,Brave New World (August 2006) Michael met a kind showgirl, Vienna Barstow, who took an obvious interest in the young, dashing castoff, helping him escape the consequences of one of his many thefts. Luckily, when Brother Eye later casts Michael on Earth, Vienna is traveling with her sleazy manager, Pete Rollins, and her fellow showgirls to their new job, and mistaking Michael for the victim of an ultralight aircraft accident, rushes to give him first aid. Later that night, Vienna discovers Michael stealing from her and attempting to escape. Hoping to scare him out of his plan, she fakes a call to Las Vegas sheriffs, denouncing the earlier theft. When a truck almost runs her over, Michael is forced to use his OMAC powers to save her, incidentally revealing his ability to connect with technology. He admits to have always known Vienna was faking the call. Vienna begins to believe he is a metahuman,OMAC (vol. 3) #3 (November 2006) but, out of gratitude, she keeps helping him. Forced by Pete to kill Michael, thereby avoiding \\"unnecessary\\" questioning for aiding a fugitive, Vienna convinces Michael to fake his death, promising to return to him later. Meanwhile, Brother Eye rebuilds itself out of space debris. It contemplates a connection between the independence shown by Michael and his addiction to heroin; supposing the more heroin that is in Michael's system, the more control it can exert over him. Brother Eye slips into a dormant state until a motley crew of travelling drug addicts pick up Michael and, believing him in the throes of withdrawal, decide to give him a free fix. The crew's car crashes into Pete's bus. Pete was hoping to escape the rage of his bosses who are angry at him because, being late to the next show of Vienna's √©quipe because of Michael, they suffered a huge monetary loss. Brother Eye is forced to activate Michael. From the catastrophic crash emerge only four survivors: Vienna, Pete, a grievously wounded showgirl, and OMAC (Michael). OMAC mercy-kills Vienna's friend, being able to see the extent of her internal bleeding, kills Pete to prevent him from killing Vienna, and then brings Vienna to safety and reveals his identity as Michael Costner. Able to balance his new form, Michael shows an increased control over his body, becoming able to access several OMAC powers in his human form, mostly for Vienna's benefit. At first skeptical and angry at Michael for OMAC's early doings, Vienna softens up, steadily falling in love with him. Michael squats an abandoned cabin and uses his powers to make Vienna as comfortable as he can. They share a moment of intimacy, unknowing that Brother Eye, apparently dormant since the incident with Pete, is still watching over them, planning to turn Vienna into a new, more obedient OMAC unit through the exchange of bodily fluids with Michael. Brother Eye puts his plan into fruition by hampering Michael's activities with a wave of hallucinations and shutting down Vienna's body during a raid by the local police, arresting both of them as squatters. Michael manages to free himself, but too scared to actively fight Brother Eye, he keeps feigning a catatonic state while Brother Eye rebuilds Vienna's now comatose body to peak health. Elsewhere, Batman notices strange activities in space and sends Superman to search for Brother Eye. Superman is captured by Brother Eye and held in a kryptonite-laced chamber. He manages to contact Michael, transmitting him Brother Eye's plans about Vienna and the world: to kill all of Earth's metahumans to avenge its defeat; and ultimately smash the Earth and the Moon together, thus ending a \\"corrupt\\" humanity. Moreover, Vienna is now pregnant with Michael's son. Hoping to stop Michael from garnering enough courage to make a stand, Brother Eye awakens Vienna, now an OMAC, and sends her to kill Michael, knowing he will refuse to access his full powers to avoid being controlled by Brother Eye. Michael shocks Vienna into control by telling her of her pregnancy and reminding her about their previous charade. Once again, Vienna fakes Michael's death, before returning to human form and expressing fear for her child. Michael reassures her and asks her to remain on Earth; since, only by focusing on her safety can he avoid becoming a thrall of Brother Eye again. He then sets off for a final stand. Final battle Michael returns to space for a showdown with Brother Eye, freeing Superman to assist him. As Brother Eye gains the upper hand, Vienna once again takes the matter into her own hands. Faking absolute subservience to Brother Eye, she hurls herself over the atomic furnace alimenting Brother Eye, utterly destroying it. Michael returns to Earth, mourning his dead companion and his unborn child. No longer a fugitive, but a revered hero, thanks to a flattering article by Clark Kent, he reveals to the planet that he fears for a return of Brother Eye. Prophetically, a small monitor in space activates, showing the distinctive Brother Eye icon. Countdown and beyond The cover for Countdown #51 (first issue) shows an OMAC among the characters assembled. However, Michael Costner takes no part in the story. Michael's status as \\"the last OMAC unit\\" is questioned as Brother Eye is shown to be able to rebuild, effortlessly, an OMAC armada by assimilation of human soldiers and Apokolitan parademons, apparently negating his need for a \\"last unit\\" to restore to him his source code. It may, however, be inferred that Buddy Blank, its early programmer, restored the entirety of its code while trying to restore it to its normal operating parameters, making it again able to control and activate OMACs. A captive, amnesiac OMAC is acquired by Batman during his last tenure with the Outsiders and is brainwashed into total obedience. It is later destroyed, though, making a moot point if he was intended to be an amnesiac Costner or a simple construct. Furthermore, during the Final Crisis events, Mister Terrific is able to reach several humans infected with the OMAC virus, putting Brother Eye in charge of fighting the Justifiers on the behalf of humanity. Their presence may contradict Michael's (and Vienna's) status as \\"the last and most necessary OMAC unit standing\\", unless they were infected with the virus in later events. Powers and abilities Before being depowered, Michael had shown the fullest abilities of every other OMAC before him. He was able to access the extensive knowledge on metahumans stored by Brother Eye, shapeshift parts of his body accordingly, and enlarge his body mass. At first completely unconscious, his main personality was submerged under the OMAC main program. A unique set of circumstances later gave Michael full control of his abilities. Shortly before being depowered by Brother Eye's destruction, he could retain his invulnerability, heat vision, and partial shapeshifting abilities even in human form. He could turn his limbs into tools or weaponry partly covered in OMAC armor; or, simply, into giant, enlarged OMAC body parts. The OMAC virus can be transmitted through the exchange of body fluids, such as during sexual intercourse. However, any newly infected individuals (e.g., Vienna Barstow) would still need to be \\"activated\\" by Brother Eye before they could access their OMAC powers. While infected with the OMAC virus, Vienna expressed the very same abilities as Michael. There is no known cure for the OMAC nanovirus, but EMP disruption can put the infection into \\"remission\\". Thus, until the creation of a new breed of OMAC cyborgs during the Countdown events, Michael was still the last OMAC and he can still spread the infection, though he is unable to access his powers. This assumption, presumably due to bad communication between Grant Morrison, author of the Final Crisis series, and the authors involved in Countdown to Infinite Crisis and the OMAC miniseries, is again debunked when Mister Terrific, in his role as head of Checkmate, reveals that the former OMACs still retain their powers and manages to activate millions of them at once with the help of Brother Eye's lingering code.

They have previously been signed to Jason Mendoca's (Akercocke) Goat of Mendes Records label and are due to release their next album through Grindethic Records.  Background  Following his departure from his previous band Infestation in the year 2000, guitarist Giuseppe Cutispoto decided to form another metal band. He soon hooked up with his brother Mick (Lead Guitar) and started writing some material. Their initial intentions were to mix various metal elements such as Death, Black, Thrash and Doom with other, non metal influences. While writing the material they started looking for other band members to complete the line- up, and in 2002 Corpsing had a line-up and started rehearsing the material. After many months of rehearsals Corpsing were ready to record their debut album Watching the Thinker and in 2003 they signed to Goat of Mendes Records with whom later that year they would record their album. Watching the Thinker was subsequently released in October 2005. Since the release of their debut album the line-up changed, Giuseppe and Mick were joined by The Wizard (Vocals/Bass) and Nick \\"The Baron\\" Plews (drums). In 2006 Corpsing started rehearsing and gigging with the new line-up and in June started recording their second album with producer Andy Davies.

The Archbishop and Primate of Burundi is Martin Nyaboho, bishop of Makamba. History After the first missionary work, the first Anglican structures in Burundi were established around 1935 and grew rapidly. The former Ruanda Mission set up its first mission stations at Buhiga and Matana in 1935, and Buye in 1936. There was much growth through medical work and education. Metropolitical authority came from the Archbishop of Canterbury until in 1965 the 'Province of Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and Boga-Zaire' was established, and the first national bishop was consecrated for the Diocese of Buye (covering the whole country). Following expansion, Uganda became an independent province, leaving the rest of the region as the new Province of Rwanda, Burundi, and Boga-Zaire. In 1975, Buye diocese was divided into two and the Diocese of Bujumbura was created. The Diocese of Gitega came into existence in 1985, followed by the Diocese of Matana in 1990. The most recent diocese to be created was the Diocese of Rumonge, created from the southern part of the Diocese of Bujumbura and comprising around 50 parishes. Their first bishop elected was Pedaculi Birakengana, with the official inauguration of the diocese taking place on 4 August 2013. In 1992 the three countries of the Province each gained independence under their own individual Metropolitan Archbishop. The Episcopal Church of Burundi had his first Primate in Samuel Sindamuka, who would be in office until 1998. He was followed by Samuel Ndayisenga, Primate from 1998 to 2005. In Burundi expansion continued, with Makamba diocese established in 1997 and Muyinga in 2005. Finally in 2005 the Province adopted the current name. Archbishop Bernard Ntahoturi was elected Primate the same year and reelected in 2010. Official name The name of the Province of the Episcopal Church of Burundi changed to the Province of the Anglican Church of Burundi (Province de l‚ÄôEglise Anglicane du Burundi) as the result of a decision taken at the Provincial Synod held in Bujumbura, March 2005. Membership There are approximately 900,000 Anglicans in an estimated population of 12 million in Burundi. Structure The polity of the Anglican Church of Burundi is Episcopalian church governance, which is the same as other Anglican churches. The church maintains a system of geographical parishes organized into dioceses. The spiritual head of the province is its Archbishop, who is Ordinary of one of the dioceses, Metropolitan of the Province, and Primate. There are currently nine dioceses, each headed by a bishop: :See Anglican dioceses of Burundi Archbishop of Burundi The Archbishop of Burundi is both Metropolitan and Primate; he retains his diocesan See along with the Primacy. The holders of the office have been: *Samuel Sindamuka, 1992‚Äì1998 *Samuel Ndayisenga, 1998‚Äì2005 *Bernard Ntahoturi, 2005‚Äì2016 *Martin Nyaboho, 2016‚Äìpresent Worship and liturgy The Anglican Church of Burundi embraces three orders of ministry: deacon, priest, and bishop. A local variant of the Book of Common Prayer is used. Doctrine and practice The center of the Anglican Church of Burundi's teaching is the life and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The basic teachings of the church, or catechism, includes: *Jesus Christ is fully human and fully God. He died and was resurrected from the dead. *Jesus provides the way of eternal life for those who believe. *The Old and New Testaments of the Bible were written by people \\"under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit\\". The Apocrypha are additional books that are used in Christian worship, but not for the formation of doctrine. *The two great and necessary sacraments are Holy Baptism and Holy Eucharist *Other sacramental rites are confirmation, ordination, marriage, reconciliation of a penitent, and unction. *Belief in heaven, hell, and Jesus's return in glory. The threefold sources of authority in Anglicanism are scripture, tradition, and reason. These three sources uphold and critique each other in a dynamic way. This balance of scripture, tradition and reason is traced to the work of Richard Hooker, a sixteenth-century apologist. In Hooker's model, scripture is the primary means of arriving at doctrine and things stated plainly in scripture are accepted as true. Issues that are ambiguous are determined by tradition, which is checked by reason (on how scripture, tradition, and reason work to \\"uphold and critique each other in a dynamic way\\"). Social issues The Church's major concerns include peace and reconciliation, repatriation of refugees and displaced people, community development, literacy and education, and fighting AIDS. It is committed to mission and evangelism and is concerned to support theological education and training for ministry.

The Church is not a member of the World Council of Churches.http://www.oikoumene.org/?id=3587 World Council of Churches Anglican realignment The Anglican Church of Burundi is a member of the Global South but hasn't been very active so far in the Anglican realignment.

It is characterized by the practice of single burial, the deceased usually being accompanied by a battle-axe, amber beads, and pottery vessels. The Single Grave culture was a local variant of the Corded Ware culture, and appears to have emerged as a result of a migration of peoples from the Pontic-Caspian steppe. It was succeeded by the Bell Beaker culture, which appears to have been ultimately derived from the Single Grave culture. History=Origins The Single Grave culture was an offshoot of the Corded Ware culture, which was itself an offshoot of the Yamnaya culture of the Pontic- Caspian steppe. On the western North European Plain, the Single Grave culture replaced the earlier Funnelbeaker culture. Distribution The Single Grave culture came to encompass the western part of the European Plain. In Denmark, Single Grave sites are concentrated in Jylland, where its appearance is accompanied by large-scale forest clearance and an expansion of animal husbandry, particularly cattle. In eastern Denmark, the Single Grave culture, the Pitted Ware culture, and the Funnelbeaker culture appear to have co- existed for some time. It maintained close connections to other cultures of the Corded Ware horizon. End The Single Grave culture was succeeded by the Bell Beaker culture. The Bell Beaker culture is thought to have been derived from the Protruding-Foot Beaker culture (PFB), which was a variant of the Single Grave culture. Research The term Single Grave culture was first introduced by the Danish archaeologist Andreas Peter Madsen in the late 1800s. He found Single Graves to be quite different from the already known dolmens, long barrows and passage graves. In 1898, Danish archaeologist Sophus M√ºller was first to present a migration-hypothesis stating that previously known dolmens, long barrows, passage graves and newly discovered single graves may represent two completely different groups of people, stating \\"Single graves are traces of new, from the south coming tribes\\". Characteristics Protruding-Foot Beaker culture (PFB), subset of the Single Grave culture. Burials The Single Grave culture is known chiefly from its burial mounds. Thousands of such mounds have been discovered. These are typically low, circular earthen mounds. Originally, the mounds were surrounded by a circle of split timbers. In low mounds, grave would contain one, or even two, plank coffins. Each coffin contained a single individual. Occasionally, new graves and mounds would be added on top of previous ones. Males were typically buried with battle axes, large amber discs and flint tools. Females were buried with amber necklaces made of small beads. Both genders were buried with a ceramic beaker. This probably contained some form of fermented beverage, possibly beer. The standardized burial practices of the single grave culture have been interpreted as evidence of equality of the sexes in Single Grave society. Economy The Single Grave people were engaged in animal husbandry, particularly the raising of cattle. They also engaged in agriculture, with barley as the main crop. Pottery The Single Grave people produced pottery with cord impressions similar to those of other cultures of the Corded Ware horizon. The cultural emphasis on drinking equipment already characteristic of the early indigenous Funnelbeaker culture, synthesized with newly arrived Corded Ware traditions. Especially in the west (Scandinavia and northern Germany), the drinking vessels have a protruding foot and define the Protruding-Foot Beaker culture (PFB) as a subset of the Single Grave culture. Genetics In a genetic study published in Nature in June 2015, the remains of a Single Grave male buried in Kyndel√∏se, Denmark c. 2850 BC-2500 was examined. He was determined to be a carrier of the paternal haplogroup R1a1a1 and the maternal haplogroup J1c4. Like other people of the Corded Ware horizon, he notably carried Western Steppe Herder (WSH) ancestry.

Synopsis  The movie is different from other war movies in Indian cinema as it vividly describes the IAF's role in 1971 Indo-Pakistani war in the western sector. The film starts with an air raid by Pakistan Air Force (PAF) on an Indian Air Force (IAF) airbase in the western sector in India. After the raid a pilot (Raaj Kumar) takes an oath while standing near the body of a dead ground crewman - \\"Jawaab dene aaunga, is jawan ki kasam, Hindustan Ki Kasam\\" (I will avenge, I swear by this soldier, I swear by Hindustan). The credits start while the title song of the movie is played in the background (sung by the Mohammed Rafi and Manna Dey). The movie revolves around the IAF's mission of destroying a PAF radar which blocks IAF pilots radios in combat. Indian intelligence plant Mohini, who is Tahira's (Priya Rajvansh) look alike, fianc√©e of a PAF pilot (Amjad Khan). Mohini goes to Pakistan and starts working as a singer on Pakistan TV (PTV) studio (where the radar which jams the radio frequency of IAF jets is also kept). Mohini informs the IAF about the jammer. IAF asks her to leave the building in the night after her programme is done so that they can raid the building. PAF's counter intelligence learns about her and they zero in on her on that very night. As soon her programme is finished, the IAF air raids the studio while she is still inside. In the dogfight with Pak sabers Raaj Kumar's jet is destroyed and he crashes. He radios for help and the IAF fighters destroy the pursuing Pakistani soldiers and their vehicles. The pilot and Tahira are evacuated. The movie ends with IAF's flyby on the Republic day parade in New Delhi with the title song in the background.

It is based upon the novel of the same name by Dominique Lapierre, which looks at poverty in then-modern India, specifically life in the slums. The film stars Patrick Swayze, Om Puri and Shabana Azmi. Plot Hazari Pal (Om Puri) is a rural farmer who moves to Calcutta with his wife Kamla (Shabana Azmi) and three children in search of a better life. The Pals do not get off to a good start: they are cheated out of their rent money and thrown out on the streets, and it's difficult for Hazari to find a job to support them. But the determined family refuses to give up and eventually finds its place in the poverty-stricken city. Meanwhile, on the other end of Calcutta, Max Lowe (Patrick Swayze), a Houston surgeon distraught after the loss of a young patient, has arrived in search of spiritual enlightenment. However, he encounters misfortune as soon as he arrives. After being tricked by a young prostitute, he is roughed up by thugs and left bleeding in the street without his documents and valuable possessions. Hazari comes to Max's aid and takes the injured doctor to the \\"City of Joy,\\" a slum area populated with lepers and poor people which becomes the Pals' new home and the American's home-away-from-home. Max spends a lot of time in the neighborhood, but he does not want to become too involved with the residents because he is afraid of becoming emotionally attached to them. He soon, however, is coaxed into helping his new-found friends by a strong-willed Irish woman (Pauline Collins), who runs the local clinic. Eventually, Max begins to fit in with his fellow slum-dwellers and become more optimistic. There are many around him whose lives are much worse, but they look on each day with a hope that gives new strength to the depressed doctor.

Biography Blumenfeld was born in Watertown, Wisconsin on 7 April 1864, the fourth son of David Blumenfeld, and his wife Nancy. A former professor from Nuremberg, David Blumenfeld had emigrated to the United States in 1848, where he founded Der Weltb√ºrger, a German language newspaper. Aspiring to follow in his father's footsteps, Blumenfeld began his journalistic career working with his father before moving to the Chicago Herald in 1884. The next year saw him work for the United Press and in 1887 he visited the United Kingdom to report on the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. After his return, his coverage of a fire for the New York Morning Journal led James Gordon Bennett, Jr. to offer him a Blumenfeld a job with his paper, the New York Herald, where Blumenfeld worked a reporter until differences led to his resignation in 1892.A. J. A. Morris, \\"Blumenfeld, Ralph David\\", in The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, H.C.G. Matthew and Brian Harrison, eds. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), vol. 9. Over the following six years, Blumenfeld built up a successful business selling linotype machine. In 1894 he moved to Britain, where his wealth and reputation as a journalist led to offers to purchase both The Observer and The Sunday Times, both of which he declined. Yet he desired to return to the world of journalism, and in 1900 eagerly accepted Alfred Harmsworth's offer of a position as news editor of the Daily Mail. He was soon involved in Harmsworth's business dealings as well, serving as Harmsworth's contact in his unsuccessful effort to purchase The Times from the Walter family.J. Lee Thompson Northcliffe: Press Baron in Politics, 1865-1922 (London: John Murray, 2000). Blumenfeld's tenure with Harmsworth was short. In 1902, Arthur Pearson convinced Blumenfeld to leave the Daily Mail for its rival, the recently established Daily Express. Accepting, Blumenfeld soon came to play an important role in the operation of the paper, introducing such innovations as the American practice of featuring news on the front page instead of advertisements. In 1908 he was named a director of the company and took over as editor the following year. Grappling with business-related problems with the newspaper, he accepted a loan of ¬£25,000 from Max Aitken, which was key to the press baron's subsequent assumption of ownership of the newspaper in 1917. Blumenfeld remained editor of the paper until 1929, but he gradually found himself marginalized as Beaverbrook (as Aitken was subsequently ennobled) assumed an intrusive role in editorial matters. Politically Blumenfeld was a strong supporter of laissez- faire economics and a harsh critic of socialism and to this end he established the Anti-Socialist Union in 1908 and succeeded in linking the group closely to the Conservative Party.Peter Barberis, John McHugh, Mike Tyldesley, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations: Parties, Groups and Movements of the 20th century. After turning over editorship of the paper to his prot√©g√© Beverley Baxter, Blumenfeld wrote a number of books, including What is a Journalist (1930) and The Press in My Time (1932). In 1932 he became Chairman of the Board of Directors for the Daily Express, a position he held for the remainder of his life. He also served as president of the Institute of Journalists in 1928, master of the Company of News Makers from 1931 until 1933, and deputy master of the Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers from 1931 until 1935. Though active in the Conservative Party, he declined a knighthood offered for political services. A close friend of several politicians, he was said to have been one of the few people who induced Calvin Coolidge to talk, while leading a visit of journalists to the White House in 1927. In 1935, after broadcasting a series of talks on BBC Radio called \\"Anywhere for a News Story\\", Blumenfeld retired to Muscombs, a farmhouse in Great Dunmow, Essex. Incapacitated by a stroke in 1936, he died twelve years later. ReferencesFurther reading *\\"Mr. R.D. Blumenfeld: Chairman of the Daily Express\\" (Obituary), The Times, 19 July 1948.

Smith was eldest son of Robert Smith, and brother of the writer and clergyman Sydney Smith. He entered Eton College in 1782, and became very intimate with John Hookham Frere, George Canning, and Henry Vassall-Fox, 3rd Baron Holland. With them in 1786 he started the school magazine entitled \\"The Microcosm\\", which ran for forty volumes, and procured for Smith an introduction to Queen Charlotte. In 1788 he became a scholar on Dr. Battie's foundation, and in 1791 obtained Sir William Browne's medal for the best Latin ode. In the same year he entered King's College, Cambridge, and graduated B.A. in 1794 and M.A. in 1797. On 4 July of the same year he was called to the bar of Lincoln's Inn. In 1803, through the influence of William Petty, first Marquess of Lansdowne, and Sir Francis Baring, he obtained the appointment of Judge Advocate General of Bengal. In seven years he returned to England with a fortune, and settled in London. While in India he allowed his brother Sydney ¬£100 a year, and on his return lent him ¬£500 towards the expenses of his move into the country, and gave ¬£100 a year to support Sydney's eldest son at Westminster. In 1812 Smith entered House of Commons as member for Grantham, but made no reputation as a speaker. At the general election of 1818 he contested Lincoln unsuccessfully, but two years later he won the seat and sat as the representative of the borough until his retirement after the dissolution of 1826. Although Robert Percy never attained the fame of his brother Sydney, with whom he always maintained very affectionate relations, yet those who were intimate with both held that \\"Bobus\\" equalled, if he did not surpass, him in the very qualities for which the younger was renowned. He was a man of great originality, a profound thinker, and of wide grasp of mind. His wit was proverbial, and his conversation provoked the admiration of Madame de Sta√´l. His language was characterised by Canning as \\"the essence of English,\\" and Landor declared that his Latin hexameters would not have discredited Lucretius. A number of Smith's Latin verses were published by his son under the title of \\"Early Writings of Robert Percy Smith,\\" Chiswick, 1850, quarto. Smith was also a member of the New River Company, who developed part of Finsbury as the head of the New River, and Percy Circus in Finsbury is named after him.  Personal life  His country residence was at Cheam, Surrey. In 1797 Smith married Caroline, daughter of Richard Vernon, M.P. for Tavistock. She was half-sister of the mothers of the third Lord Holland and of the third Lord Lansdowne. By her Smith was father of Robert Vernon, who became a prominent Liberal politician and was created Baron Lyveden in 1859. Smith died on 10 March 1845 at his house in Savile Row, London.

In 1984, presented to the Youth Department of the City of Madrid (Spain), where Chema de Mingo and Chus Medrano considered the interest of its sponsorship to the cultural dynamism of the city. They obtained the support of Kodak Spain and Albacolor laboratories. In 1985 they managed to launch the first edition in Madrid with a surprising success participation (2500 photographers). This competition would be quickly imitated in cities across Spain and many others around the world. The Collective Cartela itself organized 4 successive editions in Madrid. Also held in Santiago de Compostela (Spain) and later, with his partner, Antonio de Juana, in Lisbon (Portugal). For 24 hours the photographers had to make 24 photographs with themes that were provided to them 4 by 4, at checkpoints that were performed every 4 hours. The first edition included 2512 participants, the film was in black and white. Participants should pass 6 dynamic controls plus the final film's collection point. This structure was established as a functional dynamics for subsequent editions. Several version came later, half marathons of 12 hours or even less were made. Given the impossibility that existed in Spain to properly register an idea, Eduardo Soto Perez and Antonio Bol√≠var, now as the company Mil Millones, SA, they proceeded to register Photographic marathon at the Legal Deposit (M-28891-1986) being subsequently also registered in the Registry of Intellectual Property of Madrid with the number 02482. The idea triumphed and soon spread in cities across Spain and other countries, photographic marathons were and are still held in many cities. In 1987 a first Photo Marathon was held in New York, in Stockholm in 1988. In 1989 hold his first Copenhagen Photomarathon, following Berlin in 1998. Both events continue to organize annually.As shown in the spanish wikipedia Photomarathons and the European Month of Photography In 2010 Photomarathons were first represented during the European Month of Photography, with a joint exhibition in Berlin, under the theme \\"Time travel\\". The exhibition was a retrospective of the 10 years of the Photomarathon in Berlin, and included the three winning series of Copenhagen and Cardiff photomarathons.4\\\\. European Month of Photography Berlin 2010, accessed 2015-12-07 In 2012, the photomarathons in the cities of Copenhagen, Cardiff and Berlin shared the same topic, with the winning photographs in each city being exhibited in the others.1 topic. 3 cities. 9 photos., photomarahon.co.uk, published 2012-06-14, accessed 2014-07-28  Keys  One reason for the massive success of this contest was to combine photography and action: conducting urban photographic adventures. The proposed themes stimulate the creativity of the participants (for example: \\"They come from abroad\\"), thousands of photographers concentrated in certain parts of the city in a precise moment (‚ÄúWalking by Puerta del Sol at twelve o'clock when I decided to take a picture of the clock\\"), or filled parks with excited reporters trying to capture the image suggested (\\"Elf, a costumed character who must be locate and photograph in the Buen Retiro Park‚Äù). This opened a new dimension to photographic competitions introducing ingenuity, spontaneity, active participation and creativity, and perseverance and physical and mental strength to complete 24 hours of the contest. The photographers competed but also made friends, had fun and acquired a better knowledge of their city, museums, places and services. In addition the organization prepared in each control artistic and cultural activities (small plays of theater, exhibition of short films, musical performances, art exhibitions, participatory structures, mazes, swimming in a public pool at dawn, etc.) all that were organized exclusively for the photographers during the contest. Some of the topics that were proposed along 4 editions held in Madrid: \\"Self Portrait,\\" \\"Music, music, music\\", \\"News of the Day\\", \\"Sunrise in Madrid\\" \\"Morning Sport\\", \\"Nature, flora and fauna\\", \\"Madrid\`s Cocidito\\", \\"Will jump to 12.00 from the top of the Torre de Madrid\\", \\"Stumble\\", \\"Untitled\\", \\"Farewell\\", etc. The jury, choose among photographers and artists of renown (Ouka Lele, Miguel Trillo, Ciuco, Jorge Arranz, etc.) and, from the second edition on, incorporating the winners of the previous editions (Daniel Font, Amador Toril Jose Antonio Red, etc.). The awards were given at a mass party followed for an exhibition of photographs of the winners.

Pictured is a road sign in India, with the Perso-Arabic script above and the Devanagari script below, with an English translation at the bottom. A digraphic street sign in Gabo≈°, Croatia In sociolinguistics, digraphia refers to the use of more than one writing system for the same language. Synchronic digraphia is the coexistence of two or more writing systems for the same language, while diachronic digraphia (or sequential digraphia) is the replacement of one writing system by another for a particular language. Hindustani, with an Urdu literary standard written in Arabic script and a High Hindi standard written in Devanagari, is one of the 'textbook examples' for digraphia, specifically synchronic. Other examples of synchronic digraphia include: * Kazakh language: Arabic in Xinjiang (China), Cyrillic in Kazakhstan but to be replaced by Latin in 2025 (see Kazakh alphabets) * Konkani language is written in no fewer than three scripts; Devanagari, Kannada and Roman. * Punjabi which uses two different writing systems: the Gurmukhi script used in Punjab, India, and the Shahmukhi used in Punjab, Pakistan, though there is no difference when both of these scripts are read or pronounced. * Serbian, which is equally written in both Serbian Cyrillic alphabet and Gaj's Latin alphabet, and practically all speakers of Serbian can read and write both scripts. *Marathi was historically written simultaneously in Modi script and Balbodh Devanagari until the 1940s, after which Devanagari was preferred over Modi script due to a lack of printing infrastructure for the latter *Kashmiri, with a situation very much like Hindustani, though without the two literary standards being considered different languages. Kashmiri written in Shaaradaa/Sharda, Devanagari, Nastaliq & Roman scripts. Examples of diachronic digraphia include * Kazakh: Cyrillic to Latin * Most languages previously spoken in the Soviet Union excluding East Slavic languages: Latin to Cyrillic * Korean: used to be written in Hanja, then Hangul * Malay: traditionally written in Jawi, but largely replaced by Roman. * Mongolian: Mongolian script (with many short- lived alternatives including  ºPhags-pa) to Cyrillic * Turkish: which replaced a Perso-Arabic writing system with a Latin-based system in 1928. * Vietnamese: used to be written in Ch·ªØ N√¥m, then replaced with Latin-based Vietnamese alphabet Digraphia has implications in language planning, language policy, and language ideology. Terminology Digraphia \\"using two writing systems for the same language\\" is an uncommon term, generally restricted to linguistic contexts. Etymology English digraphia, like French digraphie, etymologically derives from Greek di- Œ¥Œπ- \\"twice\\" and -graphia -Œ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒØŒ± \\"writing\\". Digraphia was modeled upon diglossia \\"the coexistence of two languages or dialects among a certain population\\", which derives from Greek diglossos Œ¥ŒØŒ≥ŒªœâœÉœÉŒøœÇ \\"bilingual.\\" Charles A. Ferguson, a founder of sociolinguistics, coined diglossia in 1959. Grivelet analyzes how the influence of diglossia on the unrelated notion of digraphia has \\"introduced some distortion in the process of defining digraphia,\\" such as distinguishing \\"high\\" and \\"low\\" varieties.Grivelet (2001), p. 5. Peter Unseth notes one usage of \\"digraphia\\" that most closely parallels Ferguson‚Äôs ‚Äúdiglossia,‚Äù situations where a language uses different scripts for different domains; for instance, \\"shorthand in English, pinyin in Chinese for alphabetizing library files, etc. or several scripts which are replaced by Roman script during e-mail usage.\\"Unseth (2005), p. 36. History The Oxford English Dictionary, which does not yet include digraphia, enters two digraph terms and digraphic.Oxford English Dictionary (2009). 2nd ed., v. 4.0. First, the linguistic term digraph is defined as, \\"A group of two letters expressing a simple sound of speech\\". This meaning applies to both two letters representing a single speech sound in orthography (e.g., English ng representing the velar nasal ) and a single grapheme with two letters in typographical ligature (e.g., the Old English Latin alphabet letter √¶). Second, the graph theory term digraph (a portmanteau from directed graph) is defined as, \\"A graph in which each line has a direction associated with it; a finite, non-empty set of elements together with a set of ordered pairs of these elements.\\" The two digraph terms were first recorded in 1788 and 1955, respectively. The OED2 defines two digraphic meanings, \\"Pertaining to or of the nature of a digraph\\" and \\"Written in two different characters or alphabets.\\" It gives their earliest examples in 1873 and 1880 (which was used meaning \\"digraphia\\"). Isaac Hollister Hall, an American scholar of Oriental studies, described an Eteocypriot language publication as \\"bilingual (or digraphic, as both inscriptions are in the same language).\\"Hall, Isaac Hollister (1880). \\"The Cypriote Inscriptions\\". Scribner's Monthly, vol. 20, p. 205. Hall's article was antedated by Demetrios Pieridis's 1875 usage of digraphic instead of bilingual for an inscription written in both the Greek alphabet and Cypriot syllabary. English digraphic and digraphia were contemporaneous with their corresponding terms in French linguistics. In 1877, Julius Oppert introduced digraphique to describe languages written in cuneiform syllabaries.Oppert, Jules (1877). [Review of] Fran√ßois Lenormant, √âtudes sur quelques parties des syllabaires cun√©iformes, Paris 1877; idem, Les syllabaires cun√©iformes, Paris 1877. G√∂ttingische gelehrte Anzeigen 1877(45‚Äì46). 1409‚Äì1449. In 1893, Auguste Barth used French digraphisme for Cambodian inscriptions written in Khmer script and BrƒÅhmƒ´ script.Bergaigne, Abel (1893). Inscriptions sanscrites du Cambodge [edited and commented by Auguste Barth]. Notices et extraits des manuscrits de la Biblioth√®que Nationale et autres biblioth√®ques 27(1). 293‚Äì588. In 1971, Rob√®rt Lafont coined digraphie regarding the sociolinguistics of French and Occitan. Although the word \\"digraphia\\" is new, the practice is ancient. Darius the Great's (c. 522-486 BCE) Behistun Inscription was written in three cuneiform scripts for Old Persian, Elamite, and Babylonian. Neologizers Four authors independently neologized English digraphia from diglossia. The Songhay linguist Petr Zima (1974) first used \\"digraphia\\" to describe the Hausa language having two writing systems, Boko (Latin script) and Ajami script (Arabic script). Zima differentiated these paired situations. *Digraphia: \\"Two types of written form of one language co-exist, based upon the usage of two distinct graphical systems (scripts) by the respective language community.\\" *Diorthographia: \\"Two types of written form of a particular language co-exist, using the same script, but they are based upon the usage of two distinct orthographies by the same language community.\\"Zima (1974), p. 58. Usage of \\"diorthographia\\" is unusual. Compare dysgraphia meaning \\"a language disorder that affects a person's ability to write\\" and dysorthographia \\"a synonym for dyslexia\\". The anthropologist James R. Jaquith (1976), who studied unconventional spelling in advertising, used \\"digraphia\\" to describe the practice of writing brand names in all caps (e.g., ARRID). He described digraphia as \\"the graphic analog of what linguists call diglossia\\", and defined it as \\"different versions of a written language exist simultaneously and in complementary distribution in a speech community.\\" The sociolinguist Ian R. H. Dale (1980) wrote a general survey of digraphia, defined as, \\"the use of two (or more) writing systems to represent varieties of a single language.\\" The sinologist and lexicographer John DeFrancis (1984) used digraphia, defined as \\"the use of two or more different systems of writing the same language,\\" to translate Chinese shuangwenzhi (ÈõôÊñáÂà∂ \\"two-script system\\") of writing in Chinese characters and Pinyin. DeFrancis later explained, \\"I have been incorrectly credited with coining the term digraphia, which I indeed thought I had created as a parallel in writing to Charles Ferguson‚Äôs diglossia in speech.\\"DeFrancis, John (2006). Prospects for Chinese Writing Reform, Sino-Platonic Papers 171. Hegyi coined and suggested the terms \\"bigraphism\\" and \\"multigraphism\\",Hegyi, O. 1979. Minority and restricted uses of the Arabic alphabet: the aljamiado phenomenon. Journal of the American Oriental Society Vol. 99, No. 2:262-269. but he only used them twice (p. 265; fn. 17, p. 268) and did not promote the use of either of these terms, nor follow up on his insights into the importance of studying \\"the use of two or more different writing systems for the same language... such cases have been more widespread than commonly assumed.\\" Usage Digraphia is an uncommon term in current English usage. For instance, the Corpus of Contemporary American English, which includes over 425,000,000 words, lists digraphia three times in \\"academic genre\\" contexts. St√©phane Grivelet, who edited a special \\"Digraphia: Writing systems and society\\" issue of the International Journal of the Sociology of Language, explains. > After 25 years and various articles on the subject, there are still > important differences in the scope of the definition, and the notion itself > is rarely used in sociolinguistics, apart from the field of Chinese studies, > where the notion of digraphia is nowadays frequently used to describe the > coexistence of two writing systems: Chinese script and Pinyin.Grivelet > (2001), p. 1. Digraphia has some rare synonyms. Orthographic diglossia antedates digraphia, and was noted by Paul Wexler in 1971.\\"Wexler, Paul (1971). \\"Diglossia, language standardization and purism.\\" Lingua 27, 340. \\"Orthographic differences are not always a reflection of ethnocultural differences and multiple standards. Different scripts may be used by a single ethnic group for different purposes (e.g., secular versus religious literature), in which case we could speak of 'orthographic diglossia'.\\" Bigraphism, bialphabetism, and biscriptality are infrequently used. Some scholars avoid using the word \\"digraphia\\". Describing terminology for \\"script obsolescence,\\" Stephen D. Houston, John Baines, and Jerrold Cooper say, \\"'Biscript' refers to a text in two different writing systems. 'Biliteracy' and 'triliteracy' label the concurrent use of two or three scripts.\\" Theoretical aspects Digraphia can be either \\"synchronic\\" (or \\"concurrent\\") or \\"diachronic\\" (\\"historical\\" or \\"sequential\\"),DeFrancis (1984), p. 60 uses concurrent and sequential. extending Ferdinand de Saussure's classic division between synchronic linguistics and diachronic linguistics. Dale first differentiated \\"diachronic (or historical) digraphia\\" (\\"more than one writing system used for a given language in successive periods of time\\") and \\"synchronic digraphia\\" (\\"more than one writing system used contemporaneously for the same language\\").Dale (1980), p. 6. Dale concluded that, > Two primary factors have been identified as operating on a society in the > choice of script for representing its language. These are the prevailing > cultural influence (often a religion) and the prevailing political influence > of the period in which the choice is made. Synchronic digraphia results when > more than one such influence is operating and none can dominate all groups > of speakers of the language in question [ ‚Ä¶ ] Diachronic digraphia results > when different influences prevail over a given speech community at different > times.Dale (1980), p. 12. Some recent scholarship questions the practicality of this synchronic/diachronic distinction. Grivelet contends that, \\"digraphia is a single sociolinguistic process with two types of outcome (concurrent or sequential digraphia) and with specific features related to the causes and types of development of the various cases.Grivelet (2001), p. 6. Peter Unseth lists and exemplifies four factors that can influence a language community's choice of a script. #\\"To identify themselves with a group.\\" In the 1940s, Mongolia replaced the traditional Mongolian script first briefly with the Mongolian Latin alphabet and then, under Soviet influence, with the Mongolian Cyrillic alphabet. From the 1980s, the Mongolian script was reintroduced into schools for its historical and cultural importance. #\\"To distance themselves from a group.\\" In the mid-19th century, the LDS Church developed and promoted the Deseret alphabet for English. Brigham Young publicly claimed it was more phonetically accurate than Latin script and would facilitate learning to read and write English. However, historian David Bigler says the Deseret alphabet \\"demonstrated cultural exclusivism, an important consideration. It also kept secrets from curious non-Mormons, [and] controlled what children would be allowed to read.\\"Bigler, David (1998). Forgotten kingdom: the Mormon theocracy in the American West, 1847‚Äì1896, p. 56. Arthur Clark. #Participation in developments on a broader scale. The choice of a script can influence a group's preparedness to interact with other regional or international groups. For instance, the Hmong language has numerous alternate writing systems. Hmong who live in Southeast Asia prefer the indigenous Romanized Popular Alphabet (RPA) or the Pahawh Hmong semi-syllabary; Hmong expatriates who live in the United States prefer to romanize names differently, such as Latin Hmong instead of RPA Hmoob. #\\"Linguistic considerations.\\" Sometimes a foreign script is rejected because it is unsuitable for the phonetics of a language. Korean was first written in logographic Hanja Chinese characters, but king Sejong the Great promulgated the Hangul alphabet, which is better suited for transcribing Korean phonology. In the present day, South Korean uses both Hanja logographs and Hangul letters, while North Korea uses only Hangul. Linguists who study language and gender have analyzed gender-differentiated speech varieties (\\"genderlects\\", usually spoken by women), and there are a few cases of scripts predominantly used by women. Japanese hiragana was initially a women's script, for instance, used by Murasaki Shikibu to write The Tale of Genji. Chinese N√ºshu script (literally \\"women's writing) is a simplification of characters that was traditionally used by women in Jiangyong County of Hunan province.Unseth (2005), p. 37. Not only scripts, but also letters can have iconic power to differentiate social groups. For example, the names of many heavy metal bands (e.g., Mot√∂rhead, Infern√§l M√§jesty, M√∂tley Cr√ºe) use umlauts \\"to index the musical genre as well as the notion of ‚ÄòGothic‚Äô more generally.\\"Sebba (2009), p 40. This digraphic usage is called the \\"metal umlaut\\" (or \\"r√∂ck d√∂ts\\"). Synchronic digraphia Synchronic digraphia is the coexistence of two or more writing systems for the same language. A modern example is the Serbian language, which is written in either the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet or Gaj's Latin alphabet. Although most speakers can read and write both scripts, Roman Catholic Croatians and Muslim Bosniaks generally use Latin, while Orthodox Serbians commonly use both. However, older indigenous scripts were used much earlier, most notably Bosnian Cyrillic. Inuktitut is also officially digraphic, using both Latin and Inuktitut syllabics. In Hindustani, the Devanagari or Persian script generally follows the Hindi and Urdu standards and the speaker's religious affiliation, though Urdu is sometimes written in Devanagari in India. Digraphia is limited, however, in that most people know only one script. The Japanese writing system has unusually complex digraphia. William C. Hannas distinguishes two digraphic forms of Japanese: \\"true digraphia\\" of occasionally using r≈çmaji Latin alphabet for a few loanwords like DVD, and of regularly using three scripts (technically, \\"trigraphia\\") for different functions. Japanese is written with kanji \\"Chinese character\\" logographs used for Sino-Japanese vocabulary; hiragana used for native Japanese words and for grammatical endings; and katakana used for foreign borrowings or graphic emphasis.Hannas, William C. (1997). Asia's Orthographic Dilemma. University of Hawaii Press, pp. 299-300. Take Nihon for instance, the primary name of Japan. It is normally written Êó•Êú¨ (literally, \\"sun's origin\\") in kanji ‚Äì but is occasionally written „Å´„Åª„Çì in hiragana, „Éã„Éõ„É≥ in katakana, or Nihon in r≈çmaji (\\"romanization\\"). Japanese users having a certain amount of flexibility in choosing between scripts, and their choices can have social meaning. Pegon (modified Arabic script) and Latin alphabet for coffee packaging in Indonesia saying 100% Pure Coffee Powder. Another example is the Malay language, which most often uses the Latin alphabet, while in certain geographic areas (Kelantan state of Malaysia, Brunei) it is also written with an adapted Arabic alphabet called Jawi. Adaptation of Arabic script is also widely used across Malay Archipelago since the introduction of Islam. In Java, Javanese people, which predominantly ruled by Hindu and Buddha kingdoms, have their own writing system called Hanacaraka. When Islamic power took place, modified Arabic writing system (called Pegon) was introduced, alongside with the massive introduction of Latin alphabet by western colonialists. This results in the use of three writing systems to write modern Javanese, either based on a particular context (religious, cultural or normal), or sometimes also written simultaneously. This phenomenon also occurred in some other cultures in Indonesia. An element of synchronic digraphia is present in many languages not using the Latin script, in particular in text messages and when typing on a computer which does not have the facility to represent the usual script for that language. In such cases, Latin script is often used, although systems of transcription are often not standardised. Digraphia is controversial in modern Written Chinese. The ongoing debate on traditional and simplified Chinese characters concerns \\"diglyphia\\" or \\"pluricentricity\\" rather than digraphia. Chinese digraphia involves the use of both Chinese characters and Hanyu Pinyin romanization. Pinyin is officially approved for a few special uses, such as annotating characters for learners of Chinese and transcribing Chinese names.Xieyan Hincha (2004). Two Steps Toward Digraphia in China. Sino-Platonic Papers 134. Nevertheless, Pinyin continues to be adopted for other functions, such as computers, education, library catalogs, and merchandise labels.DeFrancis (1984), p. 64. Among Chinese input methods for computers, Pinyin is the most popular phonetic method. Zhou Youguang predicts, \\"Digraphia is perhaps the key for Chinese to enter the age of Information processing.\\" Many writers, both from China (e.g., Mao Dun and Zhou Youguang) and from abroad (e.g., John DeFrancis, Victor H. Mair, J. Marshall Unger, and William HannasHannas, William C. (1997). Asia's Orthographic Dilemma. University of Hawaii Press.) have argued for digraphia to be implemented as a Chinese language standard. These digraphic reformers call for a generalized use of Pinyin orthography along with Chinese characters. Yat-Shing Cheung differentiates three Chinese digraphic situations. (1) Both the High and the Low forms derive from the same script system: traditional and simplified characters. (2) Both forms derive from the same system but the Low form borrows foreign elements: Putonghua and topolects (or \\"dialects\\"). (3) The High and the Low forms derive from two different script systems: Chinese characters and pinyin.Cheung, Yat-Shing (1992). \\"The form and meaning of digraphia: the case of Chinese\\". In K. Bolton and H. Kwok. Sociolinguistics Today: International Perspectives. 210-215. Routledge. Diachronic digraphia \\"Diachronic\\" or \\"sequential digraphia\\", in which a language switches writing systems, can occur historically through language change or suddenly through language reform. \\"Abrupt script shift can be seen in the change of Turkish from Arabic script to Roman (in one year), while a gradual change of script can be seen in the change from writing Korean in Chinese characters to Hangul (a process that arguably nearly spanned five centuries).\\"Unseth (2005), p. 36. The Azerbaijani language provides an \\"extreme example\\" of diachronic digraphia; it has historically been written in runic, Arabic, Latin, Cyrillic, and again Latin alphabets.Unseth (2005), p. 36.Hatcher, Lynley. 2008. Script change in Azerbaijan: acts of identity. International Journal of the Sociology of Language 192:105‚Äì116. There are many examples of languages that used to be written in a script, which was replaced later. Examples are Romanian (which originally used Cyrillic and changed to Latin) in the 1860s; Vietnamese (which switched from a form of Chinese writing called Ch·ªØ N√¥m to the Latin alphabet); Turkish, Swahili, Somali, and (partially) Malay, which all switched from Arabic script to the Latin alphabet, and many countries of the former Soviet Union, which abandoned the Cyrillic script after the dissolution of the USSR such as Moldova, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan which all switched from Cyrillic to Latin. DeFrancis notes, \\"The old literature in the earlier scripts remains, however, so that all these scripts more or less overlap in use, by scholars involved with early texts, or for reprinting earlier materials for a wider readership and for other limited uses.\\"DeFrancis (1984), p. 60.

An exhibiting artist and lecturer on Ecuador and the Galapagos Islands, the author lived for many decades in the UK but has now moved back to Ecuador. Family background Angermeyer's father Johannes Angermeyer and his four brothers, all artists and musicians, sailed from Hitler‚Äôs Germany in 1935 to the Galapagos but, after shipwreck off the coast of England, only four of the five made it to the then sparsely inhabited Enchanted Islands where they lived like Robinson Crusoes. In 1936 Emmasha, Johanna Angermeyer's Russian AmericanJim Kobak's Kirkus reviews, p. 1569 mother, married Capitan Marco Aguirre, an aristocrat and famous aviator, whom she met in Lincoln, Nebraska, when he attended the Charles Lindbergh Flying School there. In 1938 his plane crashed in the Andes while he was rushing to Emmasha‚Äôs side after she gave birth to their son. In 1939 Emmasha met Johannes Angermeyer, one of the first settlers on the Galapagos Islands, in Ecuador. They married, had a daughter Mary, and planned to live in the remote islands. However, in 1941 when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, all American civilians in Ecuador were repatriated. It was during this enforced separation, with her mother in the USA, that Johanna was born. Shortly afterwards her father in Ecuador, unable to return to his island, sickened and died. Early years Johanna was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, and her widowed mother moved their family to California in the 1950s. Bored at school, eight-year-old Johanna received most of her education roaming the public library where her mother worked in the children‚Äôs book section. In 1960 the family moved back to Quito. Young Johanna dreamed of reaching the Galapagos and learning more about the father she never knew. In 1961 her family made the four-day voyage from Guayaquil to Santa Cruz in the Galapagos. There Johanna fell in love with her larger-than-life uncles and the pioneering lifestyle but, aged thirteen, she reluctantly returned to school in Quito. When Johanna finished her studies at El Conservatorio de Musica, she roamed the hills of the capital, giving guitar lessons and teaching at a kindergarten where she began to write and illustrate picture books for children. Back to the Galapagos In 1971 she and her family moved to Santa Cruz Island. Johanna sold paintings, worked as a cook aboard a yacht and then as a guide on cruises around the archipelago. As the world began to discover the Galapagos, Johanna moved to a remote farm in the lush highlands. It was here that she met her English husband when he helped her catch a wild colt. Johanna began interviewing the original settlers. These interviews later became part of her first book, My Father's Island: A Galapagos Quest, in which she pieces together her parents' impossibly romantic story. Move to Europe Johanna and her husband moved to England where they worked for the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty, caring for stately homes across the country. Dr John Treherne, author, and President of Downing College, Cambridge, encouraged Johanna to write and it was while living in William Wordsworth‚Äôs House in Cumbria, that she finished writing her book, My Father's Island, published by Viking - Penguin.. While living in Rudyard Kipling‚Äôs home \\"Batemans\\", Johanna resumed painting and exhibiting her work. Johanna wrote and illustrated two children‚Äôs books about the Galapagos. \\"Is Your Mama an Iguana\\" and \\"How the Booby got its Feet\\". In 2015 the author and her husband moved to Vilcabamba, Ecuador. Here in this peaceful valley Johanna continues to write and illustrate books. References * Angermeyer, Johanna. (1989).

They are strong fliers in tropical forests where they feed on fermenting fruits and animal dung. The underside of the wings is pale greyish or brownish, while the upperside is dark with distinct iridescent blue markings. A few species also have orange markings on the upperside of the wings. They are popular among butterfly collectors. Prepona deiphile is considered a threatened species in Minas Gerais state, Brazil.Casagrande, M. M., Mielke, O. H. H., & Brown, K. S., Jr. (1998). [Butterflies (Lepidoptera) considered as threatened in Minas Gerais, Brazil]. Revista Brasileira de Zoologia, 15(1), 241-259. (in Portuguese) Description Prepona praeneste Prepona praeneste \\"They are very robust insects, measuring four inches across the wings, which are broad and dentated, with the tip of the fore-wings much produced, but not falcate, the hind-margin being oblique and then nearly straight below; near the inner-margin of the hind-wings of the males stands a yellow tuft of stiff hair (androconial tuft), as in Agrias. The wings are black, and are generally crossed by a broad blue or greenish-blue band, often interrupted below the costa of the fore-wings. In some species the whole of the wings is suffused with rich purple; in others the blue band is confined to the hind-wings, and is reduced to a blue blotch. The most beautiful species is P. praeneste, Hewitson, from New Granada, which might easily be mistaken for an Agrias, but for the much broader fore-wings with the hind-margin concave. It is black, suffused with rich purple, and with a sub-marginal row of scarlet spots. From the base of the fore-wings runs a scarlet band, narrowly continued along the costa for three-fourths of its length, but, beyond the cell, continued in a broad curve to the band of spots at a point opposite the middle of the hind-margin. On the under side the Preponas are varied with different shades of brown and grey; sometimes there is a transverse black or white line, and very frequently a number of short irregular zig-zag lines towards the base. On the hind-wings beneath there is either a sub-marginal row of small eyes between the nervures, or two larger eyes, one towards the tip, and the other towards the anal angle; the latter is sometimes visible above. The larva and pupa resemble those of Apatura; and notwithstanding the strong and rapid flight of the Butterflies, they are not difficult to capture, as they have the habit of settling on projecting branches of trees, and are not easily alarmed\\". Description from William Forsell Kirby's A Hand-book to the Order Lepidoptera (1896). The smooth, hairless larvae have a prominent thoracic hump which may be expanded to expose false eyespots. The colour is variously dark brown and pale brown. The head bears a pair of stout recurved horns and there is a bifid tail. The pupa is green or bluish green with irregular white spots resembling lichen. It is an ovoid shape with a prominent thoracic bulge. It is suspended by the cremaster from a leaf or twig.

(date and place of birth unknown; died at Dijon, 1298) was an English Dominican who became a diplomat and Archbishop of Dublin. Life It is not known in which convent in England he received the habit of St. Dominic‚Äîit is certain that he made his higher studies in the Convent of St. James in Paris‚Äîthere he took his degrees and lectured with great success. In the general chapter of the order held in Vienna in 1282 he was chosen Provincial of England. His contemporaries all speak of a uniform sweetness and a singular charm and distinction of manner which won for him at once love and respect. He governed the English province for five years, when he was recalled to Paris to resume his public lectures on theology. His ability was recognized by the court of France, especially by the king, Philip IV. But the English Dominicans wished him to return home, and they elected him provincial, which office he filled for a term of seven years. He became a favourite of King Edward I, and received many marks of royal affection and esteem. Edward I sent Houghton to Rome as ambassador to propose to the Pope his royal desire to assist the pope in affording help to the Christians in the Holy Land. The king proposed the conditions of the Holy Siege and he did this through his minister, William Houghton, who was favourably received at Rome and obtained nearly all that he desired. He returned to England with a Brief from Pope Nicholas IV, dated Rome, 10 Nov., 1289. The See of Dublin had become vacant by the death of Archbishop John de Sandford. Thomas Chatworth, the successor named by the chapter, was not acceptable to the king, so the see remained vacant from Oct., 1294, to June, 1297. Edward I appealed to Pope Boniface VIII requesting the appointment of William Houghton. This wish was granted and Houghton was consecrated at Ghent by Anthony Beck, Bishop of Durham, in 1297. A war was raging between France and England and the two monarchs, Philip IV of France and Edward I of England, were brought by the mediation of Houghton to conclude a treaty of peace for two years. In 1298, Edward I sent Houghton to Boniface VIII as a legate to acquaint the pope with the conclusion of the treaty of peace. Having been received by the sovereign pontiff (20 June 1298) Houghton set out for England but on the way fell sick at Dijon (France) and died there 28 August 1298. By command of Edward I the remains were brought to London and laid in the Church of the Friars Preachers. Works He found time to write the following works: \\"Commentarii in Sententiarum Libros\\", \\"De immediata visione Dei tractatus\\", \\"De unitate formarum Tractatus\\", \\"Lectur√¶ Scholastic√¶\\", and a speech in French on the rights of the English king.

He attended the Technion, graduating with a degree in architecture, going on to become a teacher. Going into politics, Bastuni joined the Arab branch of Mapam in 1951.Rostam Bastuni on the Knesset website He rose through the party ranks, and although not elected, he served as the party's secretary in the first Knesset. He also edited the Arabic edition of Mapam's weekly magazine, Al-Fajar. For the 1951 elections he was placed high enough on their list to win a place in the Knesset, thus becoming the first Israeli Arab to represent a Zionist party (three Arab MKs had served in the first Knesset, but none of them for Zionist parties - one had been a member of the communist Maki and the other two were members of an Arab party, the Democratic List of Nazareth). During his first Knesset term, internal divisions over the Sl√°nsk√Ω trial led to Mapam splitting. On 20 February 1951, Bastuni left the party and set up the Left Faction with Adolf Berman and Moshe Sneh. However, whilst Berman and Sneh went on to join Maki, Bastuni returned to Mapam on 1 November 1954. Bastuni lost his seat in the 1955 elections and did not return to the Knesset.

He is best known as one of the earliest exponents of the keyboard fugue. Life Lohet's father was a certain Jean de Li√®ge, so the family originates from Li√®ge and Simon was probably born in the area. Loxhay is the Walloon version of his surname. He was appointed organist of the W√ºrttemberg court at Stuttgart on 14 September 1571, assisting Utz Steigleder and H.F. Fries until both went into retirement. Lohet then assumed full responsibility for the chapel services. He was also somewhat active as a teacher, his pupils included his own son Ludwig (who became his father's assistant in 1594) and, most importantly, Adam Steigleder (father of Johann Ulrich Steigleder). Lohet made several trips to the Low Countries in the 1570s and to Venice in 1581 to buy instruments and music. In 1601 he retired from his post. He remained in Stuttgart until his death in summer 1611. Works Johann Woltz's Nova musices organicae tabulatura (Basel, 1617) contains all of Lohet's known works (six also survive in another manuscript, D-Mbs Mus.ms.1581). The bulk of his small surviving output consists of twenty keyboard fugues, which are also his most historically important works. Most of them are short, averaging 20-25 bars, and eight are monothematic (exploring a single subject in a single section), which is very different from contemporary examples of imitative counterpoint (i.e. ricercars and canzonas that frequently ran to 100+ bars in several sections exploring either a variety of themes or different variations of one theme) and very close, also because of frequent use of stretto entries, diminution and other contrapuntal devices, to the classic fugue of the late Baroque. A full list follows, with the number of sections given in parentheses: #Fuga prima (2) #Fuga secunda (2) #Fuga tertia (2) #Fuga quarta (1) #Fuga quinta (3) #Fuga sexta (1) #Fuga septima (2) #Fuga octava (3) #Fuga nona (1) #Fuga decima (3) #Fuga undecima (1) #Fuga duodecima (1) #Fuga decima tertia (2) #Fuga decima quarta (1) #Fuga decima quinta (2) #Fuga decima sexta (3) #Fuga decima septima (1) #Fuga decima octava (2) #Fuga decima nona (1) #Fuga vigesima (2) Single-section fugues are all monothematic. Their subjects are typical ricercar subjects: slow, sustained, moving in whole, half- and quarter notes. In two section fugues either both sections are imitative, or the second one is in free counterpoint. Fuga quinta's three sections are all imitative, but the rest of three-section fugues feature an imitative section, a stretto/canzona subject section and a free counterpoint section for the ending. In all, Lohet's pieces represent some of the earliest keyboard fugues in the modern understanding of the word. Lohet's other works are a canzona (which is really a monothematic fugue like the ones described above), two chorales (Erbarm dich mein O Herre Gott and Nun Welche hie ihr hoffnung gar auf Gott den Herren legen) and keyboard transcriptions of a motet (Media vita in morte) and a chanson (De tout mon coeur). The chorales are written in a style reminiscent of the later south German tradition, with the first line set imitatively. Editions *Simon Lohet. Compositions for organ, ed. Larry W.

The inspiration of the story of Roy Wright, nicknamed the \\"Gentle Giant\\", was of a triumph over childhood adversity. As a child, Wright had to wear splints on his legs to overcome weak knees. Later struck down with rheumatic fever, doctors prevented Wright from playing competitive sport until he was sixteen years of age.Hogan p251 At this point, in 1945, friends persuaded Wright to try out with local team North Kew in the strong Eastern Districts Football League. Wright had a dream start in the game, winning the league's best and fairest award, an achievement so eye-catching that talent scouts from the VFL were soon looking the youngster over. Richmond won his signature and he arrived at Punt Road for the 1946 VFL season, quite a rise for a man who hadn't played the game twelve months before. Wright cut a noticeable figure, with his huge frame (188 cm and over 100 kg) and golden blond hair.Holmesby/Main p188 In the post-war era, all VFL clubs were valiantly scouring the country, looking for big men capable of dominating the rucks and giving their team first use of the ball at ball-ups and boundary throw-ins. The boundary throw-in disappeared from the game after a 1925 rule change, but the rule reverted to its original form during the war, therefore increasing the emphasis on ruck play.Hess/Stewart p152 The Tigers could see Wright's rare ability but, due to his truncated early career, felt he still needed to learn the subtleties of the game. Besides, in Jack Dyer and Bill Morris, Richmond already possessed the best ruck combination in the competition. Dutifully, Wright played in the reserves but missed many games through injury. In his first three seasons, he managed just 26 senior games and frustration manifested. On a number of occasions in the late 1940s, Wright requested an open clearance from the club and on one occasion had gone to Glenferrie Oval to meet the Hawthorn players in anticipation of playing there. Eventually, opportunities opened up. Dyer retired at the end of the 1949 season, a year when Wright managed 15 games, an achievement he matched the following season as he gradually began to make a name for himself. Season 1951 provided the breakthrough point for the young ruckman. Given more time on the ball than Bill Morris, he played every game and tied with Des Rowe for the club's best and fairest. When Bill Morris retired at the end of the year, it paved the way for Wright to assume the mantle of number one ruck.Hogan p252 In 1952, Wright dominated the season, winning nineteen votes in the Brownlow medal to tie for first place with Essendon's Bill Hutchison. The prevailing system gave Wright the award, although Hutchison was given a retrospective medal in 1989.Rodgers/Browne p729 Wright experienced a quieter season in 1953 as Richmond slumped to the club's lowest ever finish on the ladder. However, he bounced back the following year to lead a late-season charge for the finals by the Tigers. The bid failed, but the Richmond supporters took plenty of pride from the Brownlow medal count when Wright polled a massive 29 votes to win by a record ten votes.Hogan p 252 Now hailed as the best big man in the game, Wright stood out among a plethora of star ruckmen who he battled every week, men such as Neil Mann, Dennis Cordner and Jack Howell. Unfortunately for both Wright and the club, the team's fortunes continued to wane. In the years immediately after the war, the Tigers made a habit of finishing just outside the finals. The lack of winning experience combined with a lack of aggressive recruiting lowered expectations around the club, and by the mid-1950s Richmond were regulars at the bottom of the ladder.Hansen p115 Wright's form shone like a beacon amid the mediocrity. Between 1952 and 1957, Wright was the first choice as ruckman for the Victorian team; he totalled eighteen games in the Big V. Fellow players, commentators and opposition fans alike admired Wright's fair and sportsmanlike approach to the game. Wright's sheer size and fierce concentration often circumvented potential trouble - few opponents were willing to tangle with the big man. Apart from his exquisite ability to direct his hit-outs straight to teammates, Wright excelled at the contested mark and rarely let down a teammate who sent the ball in the air his way. He could kick long and accurately, once recording a 73-metre punt kick in a game at Punt Road. In every way, Roy Wright was the quintessential \\"mark and kick\\" (or \\"prop and cop\\") 1950s footballer. Wright continued winning honours as the team continued to struggle. In 1956, after dominating the ruck for Victoria in the interstate carnival, he was named an All-Australian. His last big year was 1957 when he won a fourth club best and fairest and came close to winning a third Brownlow medal, finishing second to Brian Gleeson by four votes.Rodgers/Browne p423 No other Richmond player has won more than one Brownlow in the yellow and black. After succeeding Des Rowe as captain in 1958, luck deserted Wright. Injury hampered his season and the following year, an injured leg forced him to announce his retirement and deny him an on-field farewell. Aged 30, he was stranded just five games short of the 200-game milestone. Wright maintained his involvement with football by becoming one of the early television commentators on the game. He worked predominantly with the ABC and presented Wright on the Ball for most of the 1960s. Roy and his wife June lived in Carnegie until the mid 1970s when they moved to Rosebud with their children Kerryn and Paul. During the 1980s following his separation from his wife June, Roy permanently moved to his holiday \\"shack\\" in Paynesville (Victoria) which he had loved and often visited over many years. Despite the obvious distance, Roy was always available to attend Richmond functions and fundraisers, where his autograph was in big demand. The supporters of his era never forgot the \\"Gentle Giant.\\" In 1996, the AFL inducted Wright into the hall of fame as a founding member. The Richmond Team of the Century, announced in 1998, named Wright as the first ruckman, ahead of his mentor and first coach, Jack Dyer - arguably his greatest accolade.

History Former palace of Princess Marianne of the Netherlands, today's town hall The settlement was founded in the 14th century. Over the centuries, it has changed owners many times. In the mid-15th century the village became part of the County of Kladsko within the Kingdom of Bohemia. In the 16th and 17th centuries, it was part of a metal mining region. In the 17th century, the village became the center of an estate, which included also the nearby villages of Boles≈Çaw√≥w, Kletno, Strachocin and Stara Morawa. In the 18th century, Austria ceded the village to the Kingdom of Prussia in the Treaty of Berlin. In 1838, Princess Marianne of the Netherlands bought the estates, which remained in the possession of the Dutch House of Orange-Nassau until 1908. From 1871, the village was part of the German Empire. In 1897, it was connected by rail with Glatz (K≈Çodzko). After the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II in 1945, the village became part of Poland. Its German population was expelled by the local administration in the post-war period.

Google Books Synopsis The plot concerns librarian Ianthe Broome, a well-bred young woman left in comfortable circumstances by her late parents. There is no shortage of \\"suitable\\" candidates for Ianthe's hand, notably Rupert Stonebird. It surprises no one more than Ianthe herself when she falls for the new library assistant, a young man of doubtful antecedents with no money to spare. Some of the action takes place against the backdrop of Rome, where Ianthe and a group of other churchgoers are taking a sightseeing holiday. Being apart from John makes Ianthe realise how much she really cares for him, and on her return she agrees to his proposal, scandalizing her friends and family. As they settle down to their new life together, Rupert begins to recognise the charms of Penelope, another member of the community who has long been attracted to him. Publication history This novel is notable as being the first of Pym's novels to be rejected by publishers after she had established herself as a novelist. Pym completed the novel in February 1963 and sent it to Jonathan Cape, who had published all six of her previous novels however the novel was rejected. Pym wrote back to Cape to express her feeling that she had been unfairly treated, and received a sympathetic but firm response. Editor Tom Maschler, who had joined Jonathan Cape in 1960, made the decision to reject the novel. Maschler himself did not read the novel, but was given negative feedback by two readers at the company. Over the course of 1963, Pym sought out other publishers including Longman and Macmillan but was told that the novel was unsuitable or not likely to sell. According to some accounts, the reason was its being \\"out of step with the racier literary climate of the sixties\\"; others say Cape and possible further publishers viewed it as commercially unviable, even when endorsed by Philip Larkin; - p264, Modern British women writers: an A-to-Z guide, Del Ivan Janik, Emmanuel Sampath Nelson, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002, ,Google Books. \\"It was a great pleasure and excitement to me to read An Unsuitable Attachment in typescript and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I found it continuously amusing and interesting - I have tried to keep my eye open for anything that would suggest why Cape's should not publish it, and I am bound to say that it still seems a mystery to me.\\" Larkin, letter to Pym, 27 October 1963 Selected Letters of Philip Larkin, Faber, pp.359-360. Pym continued to revise the novel throughout 1964 and 1965.Pym 1984, p.215 At one point, she changed the title to Wrapped in Lemon Leaves.Holt 1990, p.199 Among other titles Pym considered for the novel were The Canon's Daughter and Reserved for Crocodiles.Pym 1984, p.209 Pym would not have another novel published until 1977, when she was rediscovered by the reading public. She died in 1980, and An Unsuitable Attachment was finally published in 1982 by Macmillan in England and E.P. Dutton in the United States. The English edition included a foreword by Larkin as well as a note by her literary executor, the novelist Hazel Holt. The novel was recorded as an audiobook by Gretel Davis for Chivers Press in the 1980s and by Penelope Keith for the BBC in 1991. The novel was published in France in 1989 as Une demoiselle comme il faut (A Good Lady), and in Italy in 1987 as Una relazione sconveniente (An Improper Relationship) The sections of the novel set in Rome were based on Pym's experiences in the city in 1961, where she was a delegate at an anthropology conference. Reception On publication after Pym's death, the novel was well-received. The Washington Post said that \\"the publisher must have been made to reject this jewel\\" and The New York Times called it \\"a paragon of a novel\\".Holt 1990, pp.198-199 Pym herself was not satisfied with the work; in a letter to Larkin, she later agreed that the lead character, Ianthe, was \\"very stiff\\" and that she had originally intended John to be a \\"much worse\\" character. Larkin wrote that he found himself \\"not caring very greatly for Ianthe...her decency and good breeding are stated rather than shown\\" and further observed, \\"I don't myself think that the number of the characters matters much; I enjoyed the book's richness in this respect. What I did feel was that there was a certain familiarity about some of them; Sophia and Penelope seemed to recall Jane and Prudence, and Mark Nicholas; Mervyn has something of Arthur Grampian, and of course we have been among the anthropologists before. What this adds up to is perhaps a sense of coasting - which doesn't bother me at all, but which might strike a critical publisher's reader - unsympathetic I mean rather than acute - as constituting 'the mixture as before'.\\" Larkin, letter to Pym, 27 October 1963, Selected Letters of Philip Larkin, p.360 Connections to other works Pym liked to bring back characters from previous novels to make minor reappearances. An Unsuitable Attachment is particularly notable for this. It features appearances by Harriet Bede from Some Tame Gazelle, Professor Fairfax and Digby Fox from Less than Angels, Wilf Bason from A Glass of Blessings, and several characters from Excellent Women including Esther Clovis, Everard Bone and his mother, and Sister Blatt. Pym re-used the characters of Mark and Sophia, as well as the cat Faustina, from An Unsuitable Attachment for her short story A Christmas Visit, commissioned by the Church Times in 1978. The story was later collected in Civil to Strangers (1987). Adaptation The novel was adapted for BBC Radio 4 in 10 15-minute episodes in 2010.

It was followed by a third game, Professor Layton and the Unwound Future. The game follows Professor Layton and his self-proclaimed apprentice Luke as they travel cross-country by train to solve the mystery behind a mysterious box that is said to kill anyone who opens it. An enhanced mobile port of Diabolical Box, subtitled \\"HD for Mobile\\", was released on December 5, 2018. Gameplay An early puzzle in Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box. The puzzle is solved via input on the bottom screen, while the instructions are on the top.Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box is an adventure/puzzle game. The player controls the movements of the eponymous Professor Layton and his young assistant Luke through several locations, unlike in the previous game which is confined to just one town. Along with completing many different types of puzzles, players must explore different areas, solve mysteries, and aid the Professor on his quest. The puzzle menus for this game are very similar to those in Curious Village. Puzzles include brain teasers, sliding puzzles, logic puzzles and others. The player is presented with each puzzle and its value in \\"picarats\\", and is given unlimited time to solve it. Each puzzle has three hints available for it, but the player must spend one \\"hint coin\\" to see each hint. Hint coins are limited; the player starts with ten, and more can be found by searching the game's locales. Once the player feels he has the answer, he enters it, either by selecting an answer, drawing a circle around a specific part, or entering the answer through character recognition on the Nintendo DS's touchscreen. If the player is correct, the picarats are added to his total score, and he is sometimes rewarded with an item. If the player is incorrect, they can retry the puzzle indefinitely, though the first two times they are wrong, the value of the puzzle will decrease by approximately ten percent each time. Optionally, a player can quit a puzzle at no cost and try another, though certain puzzles are mandatory to progress. Once a puzzle is completed, the player may retry it at any time via the game's menus. As a reward for completing a puzzle, the player may earn one of three rewards. Hamster toys are collected to help Luke give a morbidly obese hamster a workout. Pieces of a shattered camera that Sammy accidentally dropped can be assembled to repair it. Also, players can earn tea ingredients to brew new recipes and serve cups of tea to Luke, Layton and people they meet. By completing all 138 puzzles in the main game and each of these additional puzzles, the player could access 15 bonus puzzles for 153 puzzles total (excluding the downloadable puzzles). The game was compatible with Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, allowing players to connect to the internet and download new weekly puzzles. The first unlockable puzzle was made available on the day of the game's Japanese release, and one new key had been released every week thereafter for 33 weeks, with new keys being released on Sunday. After May 20, 2014, it's impossible to download the additional content, since the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service was terminated on that date. There are also two bonuses in \\"The Hidden Door\\" that are only available after the player finds one unique code each in the game's predecessor and sequel. Other bonuses include a soundtrack, cut-scenes, soundbites, character profiles, and scenes from the game. Plot Dr. Schrader, Professor Layton's mentor, reportedly has come across the mysterious Elysian Box, fabled to kill anyone who opens it. When Layton and Luke pay Dr. Schrader a visit, they find him unconscious on the floor and no sign of the box. A train ticket to the Molentary Express is the only clue of the box's theft, and the two prepare to follow on the next train out to head towards the town of Folsense, listed in Schrader's diary as the origin of the Elysian Box. They are followed by Inspector Chelmey, tracking down the crime, and Flora, who sneaks aboard the train but is eventually discovered by the pair. The train makes a stop in Dropstone, a town celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of its founding. As they enjoy the celebration, Layton and Luke learn that the town's founder, Sophia, also had an interest in the Elysian Box, but she died the year before, and her granddaughter Katia continues to seek it out. Don Paolo, Layton's arch-rival, kidnaps Flora and disguises himself as her, leaving her behind in Dropstone as the train departs. En route to Folsense, Layton, Luke, and \\"Flora\\" are knocked out with sleeping gas by the train's conductor. They awake to find their train car separated from the rest of the engine at the Folsense station. As they enter the town, they are struck by a brief wave of nausea, and \\"Flora\\" feigns illness to stay at the hotel. Layton and Luke explore the town and learn it was founded on top of rich mine deposits by Duke Herzen and his sons, Anton and Fredrich. Some fifty years ago, upon discovery of a new vein of gold, strange incidents began to occur around town, and many of its citizens left. Fredrich left with his part of the family fortune and founding the Molentary Express, changing his name to hide his identity. They also learn that Dropstone's founder Sophia was also a former resident, evacuating with several of the citizens to form the nearby village. The remaining citizens point to the central castle over the mines, where they claim that Anton remains to this day as a vampire. On returning to the hotel, Layton and Luke find that the remainder of the train's contingent has arrived, and Chelmey has arrested one of the conductors named Thunder as a suspect in the theft of the box. Layton proves him wrong, revealing Don Paolo after long ago seeing through his disguise. Don Paolo escapes but leaves behind the Elysian Box. Layton and Luke figure out the mechanism to open it, but find the box is completely empty. Layton suggests visiting Anton to solve the mystery. At the castle, the surprisingly young Anton initially welcomes them as his guests, but when they start to ask about the Elysian Box, he becomes suspicious, and at one point ties the pair up though they are able to escape. During the escape, the pair find a large hole in the basement of the castle, along with some strange machinery. Layton discovers the mine, which is connected to the castle basement, but finds the effects of the nausea worsen as they get closer to it. In spite of this, the two return to Anton and find Katia along the way. Upon mistaking her for Sophia, Anton challenges Layton to a fencing duel. Anton eventually tires from the duel: this leads Katia to break it up, revealing Anton to be her grandfather in the process. She also tells everyone that her grandmother left Folsense to protect her and Anton's unborn child (who would grow up to be Katia's mother) and that Sophia and this child had died some time ago. Unfortunately, Anton lashes out with his saber in rage and disbelief, cutting a chain holding the chandelier in place and causing the castle to collapse. Everyone makes it out in time before the building falls into the mine, caving in the exposed mine shaft in the basement. Layton explains that when the mine was discovered fifty years ago, it released a hallucinatory gas that affected everyone in Folsense; as the gas disperses, Anton is revealed to be an old man, and Folsense an abandoned, desolate town. Layton suspects a quantity of the gas was in the Elysian Box, causing those that believed in the myth to actually succumb to death. Anton is suddenly reminded of his fianc√©e, Sophia, and that he has commissioned the box to hold a message to be sent to Sophia in Dropstone after her departure, but it had been stolen so many times he had lost hope Sophia received it. Luke opens the special compartment and reveals that Sophia had gotten the box and left her own note to Anton, stating her love for him and Katia's relationship to her. Anton welcomes Katia with open arms, wanting to love her as much as he had Sophia, stating that he has to get to know Katia before he can join Sophia in death. The group returns to Dropstone, where Flora is located. As Layton and his friends return to London, they learn that Dr. Schrader had only fallen into a temporary coma from his exposure to the gas from the box, and has now fully recovered. After the credits, the game ends showing \\"to be continued\\" along with a picture of Layton and Luke standing in front of a time machine which continues on to the next adventure Professor Layton and the Unwound Future. Development The Professor Layton series was announced to be a trilogy immediately following the announcement of Professor Layton and the Curious Village within Japan. By this time, Level-5 had already decided upon the Japanese names of Curious Village and Professor Layton and the Unwound Future, but were originally planning to entitle the second game These plans were eventually cancelled due to the staff thinking that it was too strange for an English gentleman to try and survive on a desert island, and the story was changed to that of Diabolical Box. Level-5 learned several lessons from the critical response to Curious Village. Critics had often claimed that the puzzles in the games were too disjointed from the game's plot, so in Diabolical Box, they attempted to make the puzzles more relevant to the game's narrative. The puzzles within the series from Diabolical Box onward tended to use English more than Japanese. This was coincidental, but allowed the game to be translated without replacing as many puzzles. Level-5 also tried to update existing systems within the game, such as the Professor's suitcase and minigames; ultimately, Diabolical Box used up nearly twice as much data than its predecessor.  Audio  The music of the game was composed by Tomohito Nishiura with the entire soundtrack later released on an album titled Layton Kyouju to Akuma no Hako Original Soundtrack, in Japan only. The ending theme song \\"Iris\\" was sung by Salyu, though it was omitted from the album. The international release of the game utilizes an instrumental version, though it similarly was not included on the album either due to not have being created at the time. The album scored slightly higher than its predecessor. Square Enix Music Online gave it a score of 7 out of 10, criticizing that \\"there are no masterpieces on this score, even though the variety and entertainment is much more enhanced [over Curious Village's].\\" RPGFan Music stated \\"At 75 minutes, this one disc is packed with goodies, though one might also argue that it's packed with filler.\\" Release and reception Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box was released in Japan during November 2007, nine months after the release of Curious Village. Following this, Nintendo began to localize the series internationally; Curious Village was released in 2008, though Nintendo had not officially announced the localization of Diabolical Box. The manual of Curious Village, however, implied an eventual release of the second game while mentioning a feature in which passwords are exchanged between Curious Village and Diabolical Box for bonuses in both games. In March 2009, at the Game Developers Conference, Akihiro Hino listed Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box as an English title for the game. At an interview following the conference, he confirmed that the name was the official English title and that the localization was currently being worked on, which he hoped to be finished in about six months. The game was released in North America during August 2009, as Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box. It would be released in PAL regions during September of the same year, as Professor Layton and Pandora's Box, where it would become the fastest-selling Nintendo DS game ever released within the United Kingdom. Critical reception Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box received \\"favorable\\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of two nines and two eights for a total of 34 out of 40. The A.V. Club gave it an A‚àí and said that \\"even if the relatively short game doesn‚Äôt have much replay value, there‚Äôs an incentive to keep picking it up for some brain exercise.\\" Wired gave it a score of eight out of ten and said, \\"While Diabolical Box‚Äôs gameplay, animation and plot are quite a bit like its predecessor‚Äôs, slight improvements make this installment of the Professor Layton saga even more enjoyable than the last.\\" However, The Daily Telegraph gave it a score of seven out of ten and said that it \\"still has more charm and character than most and-‚Äìdespite the hiccups--provides a challenging, fun and satisfying puzzle experience for players young, old--and everything in between.\\" As of July 9, 2008, the game sold 815,369 copies in Japan, according to Famitsu. IGN gave the game Editor's Choice Award, and rated it the eleventh best Nintendo DS game as of 2010. GameTrailers gave the title its best puzzle/parlor game of 2009 award. Upon its release to Western countries, the game sold more than 1.26 million units by September 2009.

However, the PowerBook 160 came with a (diagonal) passive matrix LCD screen, which for the first time was capable of displaying 4-bit grayscale.http://lowendmac.com/1992/powerbook-160/ The 160 and the 180 were the first PowerBooks to add an external color video port like the Macintosh Portable before it, as well as increasing the maximum RAM to 14 MB. Both PowerBooks introduced a new power saving feature which allowed their processors to run at a slower 16 MHz rate, the same speed as the original 140. The PowerBook 160 had a 40MB SCSI hard disk drive, configurable to 80 or 120MB. PowerBook 165 The 165 added a 33 MHz processor and larger standard hard drive. Along with the PowerBook 145B, this would be the last of the true 100 series PowerBooks and the last Apple laptop to include two serial (printer and modem) ports. Its entry level descendant, the PowerBook 150, would continue to sell for another year and though it used the 140 case design, its internals were actually based on the PowerBook Duo and PowerBook 190, a 100-series PowerBook in name only as it used the PowerBook 5300's motherboard and case as well.

The specification writers and expert groups of the Java EE web-tier technologies have worked on a unified expression language which was first included in the JSP 2.1 specification (JSR-245), and later specified by itself in JSR-341, part of Java EE 7. History The expression language started out as part of the JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library (JSTL) and was originally called SPEL (Simplest Possible Expression Language), then just Expression Language (EL). It was a scripting language which allowed access to Java components (JavaBeans) through JSP. Since JSP 2.0, it has been used inside JSP tags to separate Java code from JSP, and to allow easier access to Java components (than in Java code). Over the years, the expression language has evolved to include more advanced functionality and it was included in the JSP 2.0 specification. Scripting was made easier for web-content designers who have little or practically no knowledge of the core Java Language. This scripting language made JSP a scripting language in the true sense. Before EL, JSP consisted of some special tags like scriptlets, expressions etc. within which Java code was written explicitly. With EL the web-content designer needs only to know how to make proper calls to core Java methods. EL was, both syntactically and semantically, similar to JavaScript expressions: *there is no typecasting *type conversions are usually done implicitly *double and single quotes are equivalent *\`object.property\` has the same meaning as \`object['property']\` EL also liberated the programmer from having to know the particularities of how the values are actually accessed: \`object.property\` can mean (depending on what the \`object\` is) either \`object.get(\\"property\\")\` or \`object.getProperty(\\"property\\")\` or \`object.getProperty()\` etc. During the development of JSP 2.0, the JavaServer Faces technology was released which also needed an expression language, but the expression language defined in the JSP 2.0 specification didn't satisfy all the needs for development with JSF technology. The most obvious limitations were that its expressions were evaluated immediately, and the JSF components could not invoke methods on server-side objects. A more powerful language was created with the following new features: *Deferred expressions, which are not immediately evaluated *Expressions that can set as well as get data *Method expressions, which can invoke methods The new expression language worked well for the purposes of JSF. But developers had problems when integrating the JSP EL with the JSF EL because of conflicts. Because of these incompatibilities, the unified expression language initiative was started to unify these expression languages. As of JSP 2.1, the expression languages of JSP 2.0 and JSF 1.1 have been merged into a single unified expression language (EL 2.1). Version 3.0 of the expression language (the unified was no longer deemed necessary) was developed in a JSR independent of the JSP and JSF specifications in JSR-341. Some new features were added, most notably EL equivalents of Java 8 streams and lambda expressions. Features The unified EL is a union of the JSP and JSF expression languages. In addition to the features already available in the JSP EL, the unified EL has the following features: *Deferred evaluation *Support for expressions that can set values and expressions that can invoke methods *A pluggable API for resolving expressions Examples This shows a simple example of Unified EL being used within a JSTL \\"c:out\\" tag: An expression that calls a method with a parameter: \${myBean.addNewOrder('orderName')} Implementations *Java Expression Language (JEXL) is a library intended to facilitate the implementation of dynamic and scripting features in applications and frameworks written in Java.

His accounts of unmonitored journeys, in a politically closed and tightly-controlled Russian, and then Soviet Central Asia, offer valuable historical testimonies of the still essentially Muslim region before Sovietization, and the conditions there of the Central Powers prisoners-of-war during and after the First World War. Background The Viennese-born and educated Krist worked as a technician in Germany before being mobilised as a twenty-year-old private in the Austro-Hungarian Army on the outbreak of World War Ip. 2, Readers' Union, 'The man who went East' in Travel special, Readers' News No. 20 (April 1939). Early in the war (November 1914) he was severely wounded and captured by the Russians at the San riverp. 15, Krist, Gustav, Prisoner in the Forbiden Land, Faber and Faber, 1938 defensive line on the Eastern front. This led to nearly five years' internment in Russian Turkistan with other German and Austrian prisoners-of-war. POWs in Russia; a 1915 photo by Prokudin-Gorskii Internment After a period of hospitalisation in Russia proper he had a sharp taste of the misery and hardship to come. He describes how he was one of only four survivors of a trainload of some three hundred prisoners-of-war who were sent from Koslov to Saratov in December, 1915, after the train-load was singled out for barbaric punishment. He was only saved at this time by the intervention of Elsa Br√§ndstr√∂m of the Swedish Red Crossp. 58, Krist, Gustav, Prisoner in the Forbiden Land, Faber and Faber, 1938. His first camp in Turkistan was sited at Katta-Kurgan, a frontier town with the Emirate of Bukhara near Samarkand. With a natural gift for languages he took on the role of interpreter, building on some Russian and a smattering of various oriental languages he had acquired before the war. On this basis he was able to become familiar with the peoples, places and conditions of the region over the eight years he remained there. Conditions in the camps were harsh however. Many of his fellow prisoners died of typhus, forced labour and starvation, or in fighting following the collapse of the Central Government. Krist kept a diary of his experiences during the whole period written on cigarette papers and secreted in a Bukharan hubble- bubble pipe to avoid it being confiscated. After the Bolshevik revolution the region was both dangerous and politically confused as Soviets, White Army, Basmachi insurgents and foreign powers struggled for power. This region of ancient Silk Road cities had been closed to foreigners on political grounds during the war. In 1917 Krist moved to Samarkand, where he worked in the town. Trading with the Sarts and being able to talk to them directly he had a sharp grasp of the situation. His writings offer a valuable glimpse of various peoples and cultures in this area of Central Asia. For seventy years after him the area was seldom visited by foreign visitors unencumbered by official controls and his accounts show life before the Sovietization of the region. Krist came to love the nomadic peoples of the region as well as the Islamic architecture of Samarkand, especially the Shah-i-Zinda complex Various escapes In 1916 Krist escaped Katta-Kurgan to Tabriz in Persia, but was unable to return to Austria due to conditions in Kurdistan and British control of south Persia. En route he had been recaptured but jumped a prison-train and made his way via Merv, northern Afghanistan and Meshed to Tabrizp. 167, Krist, Gustav, Prisoner in the Forbidden Land, Faber and Faber, 1938. As Tabriz was a principal centre for Persian carpet production and trade there he began trading in wool and carpets around Persia for a native Iranian. Krist was captured in the Russian swoop on the German community in Tabriz which destroyed the German Club and German-owned PETAG (Persische Teppiche Aktien Gesellschaft) workshopp. 185, Krist, Gustav, Prisoner in the Forbidden Land, Faber and Faber, 1938 and was taken to Julfa and then Baku. Following Krasnovodsk, from where inmates were sent to bury 1,200 Turkish prisoners-of- war on an island south of Cheleken who had died of starvation and thirstp. 188, Krist, Gustav, Prisoner in the Forbidden Land, Faber and Faber, 1938, Krist was then sent to Fort Alexandovsky, an isolated penal-camp on the Caspian, where troublesome prisoners were concentratedp. 190, Krist, Gustav, Prisoner in the Forbiden Land, Faber and Faber, 1938. The conditions there were atrocious, and eventually, when it was closed down following Red Cross investigations, he was moved to Samarkandp. 252, Krist, Gustav, Prisoner in the Forbidden Land, Faber and Faber, 1938, where he was assigned work. After the Bolsheviks freed the prisoners of war, essentially opening the camp gates and stopping the issue of rations, Krist and others were left to fend for themselves and fell into establishing various wheeling-and-dealing industries. Krist also travelled with Red Cross delegations across Turkistan and in a bizarre episode entered the service of the Emir of Bukhara who was striving to re-establish his full independence in the collapse of the Russian Empire, and helped him set up a mintp. 293, Krist, Gustav, Prisoner in the Forbidden Land, Faber and Faber, 1938. This was subsequently wrecked when Krist was driven out of town by the conservative religious leaders. Krist was able to visit the town and the Ark Citadel before its destruction. Bukhara fell to the Soviets under Mikhail Frunze in September 1920 after four days' fighting which left much of the town in ruins. Krist mentions the construction by the emir, using Austrian engineers, of a secret base at Dushanbe in the Tadjikistan Mountains. This was also bombed from the air by the Soviets and Krist visited the ruins on a later visit to the area. Entrance to the Ark fortress The local soviet in Turkistan promised a train to take the ex-prisoners home in 1920 in return for aid in suppressing mutinous Bolshevik soldiers in Samarkand. Krist as an NCO led a force of Austrian POWs in disarming them, but after the Austrians had handed in their arms this agreement was reneged on. Krist was amongst those who were later condemned to death for counter-revolutionary activity. Luckily this was commuted to three-months imprisonment at the last minute leaving time to arrange a pardon. Krist and the remaining prisoners were repatriated late in 1921 through the Baltic States and Germany, having to cross a Russia suffering from famine and civil-war. Alim Khan, Emir of Bukhara, photographed by Prokudin-Gorskii in 1911 Adventurous return After returning briefly to Vienna, in 1922 he moved back to Tabriz in Persia to work again as a carpet dealer, transversing Persia for the next two years. In time even this became routine and failed to satisfy his wanderlust. A chance meeting with some Turkmen tribesmen in 1924, led him to slip back across into Soviet territory, which was even then strengthening its controls along the frontier in that area. Travelling without papers in Soviet territory was impossible. Krist said he'd \\"would sooner pay a call on the Devil and his mother-in-law in Hell\\" than attempt to travel without them. However borrowing the I.D. card of a naturalised fellow ex-prisoner in Turkmenistan he came up with a plan to get recognition as a State Geologist of the Uzbeg Soviet in Samarkand. This scheme enabled him to explore the mountainous region to the east without hindrance. He crossed the waterless Kara-Kum desert (the ‚Äúblack, or terrible, one‚Äù) to the Amu Darya. Always a keen observer and with his gift for striking up conversations in Deh i Nau he fell in with a GPU officer who had witnessed the death of Enver Pashap. 82, Krist, Gustav, Alone through the Forbiden Land, Faber and Faber/Readers' Union, 1939. After revisiting Bukhara, Samarkand and (pre-earthquake) Tashkent he moved up the Ferghana Valley. There he encountered the Kara Kirghiz (Black Kirghiz) with whom he wintered during their last annual migration into the Pamirs, before the Soviet forces rounded them up and they were collectivized. Working his way through modern-day Tajikistan he made his way to the Persian frontier and recrossed with some difficulty. Final years He returned permanently to Vienna in 1926 where he became editor of Die Teppichborse, a monthly carpet industry trade magazinep. 2, Readers' Union, 'The man who went East', in Travel special, Readers' News No. 20 (April 1939). Here, with some leisure time, and stimulated by occasional visits of former comrades, he pieced together his war diary as ‚ÄúPascholl plenny!‚Äù (literally 'Get a move on, prisoner'). In 1936 he had his manuscript accepted by a publisher, and this led to his writing the account of his 1924‚Äì1925 adventure later published as ‚ÄúAlone through the forbidden land‚Äù.

The force may be applied parallel to, as in the case of a hydraulic bolt tensioner, or perpendicular to, as in the case of a spring-loaded bicycle chain tensioner, the tension it creates. The force may be generated by a fixed displacement, as in the case of an eccentric bicycle bottom bracket, which must be adjusted as parts wear, or by stretching or compressing a spring, as in the case of a spring-loaded bicycle chain tensioner; by changing the volume of a gas, as in the case of a marine riser tensioner; by hydraulic pressure, as in the case of a hydraulic bolt tensioner; or by gravity acting on a suspended mass, as in the case of a chair lift cable tensioner. In the power sector, the tensioner is a machine for maintaining constant tension of the conductors during work of hanging the transmission network.. Applications *Bolt tensioners are devices designed to apply a specific tension to a bolt. The device may be either removed once the actual nut is threaded into place, or left in place, in the case of a hydraulic nut. *The belt or chain tension on a single-speed bicycle can be maintained by either setting the fixed horizontal position of the rear sprocket or the front chainring horizontally, or by a separate tensioner that pushes perpendicular to the chain with either a fixed position or spring tension. *The serpentine belt and the timing belt or chain on an automobile engine may be guided by an idler pulley and/or a belt tensioner, which may be spring-loaded, hydraulic, or fixed. *The chain tension of a chainsaw may be adjusted with a chain tensioner. *A marine riser tensioner is a device used on an offshore drilling vessel which provides a near constant upward force on the drilling riser independent of the movement of the floating drill vessel. *A guideline tensioner is a hydropneumatic device used on an offshore drilling rig that keeps a positive pulling force on the guidelines from the platform to a template on the seabed. *Overhead electrical wires may be kept in tension by springs or weights. *Conveyor belts *Chair lift and gondola lift cables *Certain wood trusses, such as the beam tensioner truss picture below. *Fencing made of wire, such as electric fences, barbed-wire fences, and chainlink fences often include tensioning devices to keep them taut. *Belt sanders have a mechanism, often a spring-loaded idler drum, to apply the proper tension to the sanding belt, which can be released to allow for changing belts.

His father was later mayor of Dunedin between 1905 and 1906. The family were musical ‚Äì the Braithwaite family would perform Gilbert and Sullivan to friends and relatives in their 20-room house in Dunedin, and his elder sister Mabel Manson emigrated to England before he was born, where she made a considerable career as a singer. Braithwaite's brothers included John Braithwaite, who was convicted and executed for mutiny during World War I and pardoned by the New Zealand government in 2000, and Rewi Braithwaite, who played in New Zealand's first official international soccer match, against Australia in 1922. Braithwaite served briefly in the New Zealand armed forces during World War I. He won various competitions as both a composer and pianist and then followed his sister to England in 1916 as the Goring Thomas Compositions Scholar at the Royal Academy of Music in London, where studied composition and piano. Musical career He joined the O‚ÄôMara Opera Company as chorus master, a touring opera company run by the Irish tenor Joseph O'Mara, and with them made his debut as a conductor with Auber‚Äôs Fra Diavolo in 1919. After this he joined the British National Opera Company as a repetiteur and also in 1922 spent a year working for Bruno Walter at the Bavarian State Opera in Munich. When Walter left to go to America, Hans Knappertsbusch was appointed to the job and immediately terminated the employment of any non-Germans working for the company. Thereafter he became the first Assistant Musical Director of 2LO, the precursor to the BBC, and then moved to the BBC's Cardiff 5WA Station Orchestra where he conducted many of the first UK performances of Sibelius's music. That orchestra was closed down when the BBC decided to centralise its efforts and put its money into the newly formed BBC Symphony Orchestra in London under Sir Adrian Boult. In 1931 Braithwaite joined the Vic-Wells, later the Sadler's Wells Opera Company, the company run by the fiercely autocratic Lilian Baylis, who persuaded the politicians Winston Churchill and Stanley Baldwin, the writers G. K. Chesterton and John Galsworthy, the composer Ethel Smyth, and the conductor Thomas Beecham to raise funds for a new theatre at Sadler‚Äôs Wells in Islington, where there had been a theatre since 1683. The company performed not only opera, but ballet and theatre as well: among its stars were Laurence Olivier, John Gielgud, Margot Fonteyn, Robert Helpmann, Joan Cross, Constant Lambert. In 1931, Braithwaite‚Äôs first year, the company performed fourteen operas; the next year it performed twenty six operas. In all the company put on fifty operas between 1931 and 1939: a remarkably ambitious undertaking. Braithwaite conducted Wagner‚Äôs Mastersingers and Lohengrin Beethoven‚Äôs Fidelio, the Mozart operas (including Cosi Fan Tutte, then rarely done), Verdi‚Äôs Don Carlos and a highly successful Falstaff, the Puccini operas, and Ethel Smythe‚Äôs The Wreckers. The theatre closed down briefly when the war began but soon reopened. Braithwaite conducted Puccini‚Äôs Tosca at Sadler‚Äôs Wells on the afternoon of 7 September 1940. Lawrance Collingwood conducted Gounod‚Äôs Faust the same evening. That was the first night of the Blitz, and one of the worst. London was set on fire by waves of German bombs, 430 people were killed and 1,600 badly injured. Braithwaite watched the raid from the roof of the theatre. In 1940 he succeeded George Szell as principal conductor of the Scottish Orchestra and while there oversaw the expansion of its season from a three months to six months per year. While in Glasgow he also conducted the US Army Air Force Band, the band founded by Glenn Miller. During the war he was also much involved in the campaign to save the London Philharmonic Orchestra during these years and can be seen in the film Battle for Music, which documents that story. After the war he joined the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, as Music Director of the Ballet Company where he conducted the western premiere of Prokofiev‚Äôs Cinderella with Moira Shearer in the title role. He also conducted operas with some of the period‚Äôs greatest singers, among them Boris Christoff in Boris Godunov, and Victoria de los √Ångeles in her debut as Puccini‚Äôs Mimi. And also a performance of Aida with Astrid Varnay singing Aida in Italian, Hans Hopf singing Radames in German and Jess Walters singing Ramphis in English. He toured Australia in 1947 as a guest conductor, with concerts in all of the mainland capital cities. He was conductor of the National Orchestra of New Zealand in 1954 and then music director of the National Opera of Australia in 1954‚Äì55. In 1956 he returned to Britain as musical director of the Welsh National Opera from 1956 to 1960, where he conducted a range of interesting and little known repertoire such as Verdi‚Äôs I Lombardi and La battaglia di Legnano, Boito‚Äôs Mefistofele and Rimsky-Korsakov‚Äôs May Night as well as the standard repertoire. In 1960 he rejoined Sadler‚Äôs Wells Opera where he conducted until his retirement in 1968. In 1970 he travelled to Australia where he conducted Fidelio with the Australian Opera Company. He was a fellow of the Royal Academy of Music. Personal life and death Braithwaite married first Phyllis Greatrex (n√©e Bain) in 1925, with whom he had a daughter, Barbara, a nurse. Then, in 1931, he married Lorna Constance Davies with whom he had two sons, Sir Rodric Braithwaite, diplomat and author, and the conductor Nicholas Braithwaite. He died in London on 19 January 1971, and was buried at Levington in Suffolk in the same grave as his three-year-old grandson Mark who had died the same year. Legacy His recording legacy is mainly as an accompanist to some of the greatest singers of the mid twentieth century ‚Äì Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Sena Jurinac, Kirsten Flagstad, Tito Gobbi, Nicola Rossi-Lemeni and Joan Hammond amongst others. There are also some recordings of ballet music with the Royal Opera House Orchestra which were released on the Parlophone label, and there are a few recordings of BBC broadcasts of complete operas, among them Puccini‚Äôs La fanciulla del West with Sadler‚Äôs Wells and I Lombardi with the Welsh National Opera. Also active as a composer, writing two operas (including The Pendragon, about King Arthur) as well as a varied collection of other pieces Braithwaite wrote the book The Conductor's Art (), published in 1952. His compositions and other papers are held in the Alexander Turnbull Library in Wellington, New Zealand.

The Swedes, who themselves had 17 artillery pieces quickly deployed into battle formation and, encouraged by General Lewenhaupt, attacked the Russians. Although suffering severe setbacks on their right flank, the assault continued. On the left, the Swedish cavalry charged and broke the Russians. The infantry in the centre fired carefully at point-blank range and then charged, pushing their foes back in disorder. The battle ended in a confused melee, which was eventually won by the Swedes.

In recent years the placing and design of a suspension keel, or the lack of such, has been one of the few distinct variables in Formula One chassis design. Traditional low nose cone designs (e.g. the McLaren MP4/4) allow the lower suspension arms to be directly attached to the main structural members of the car. However, since the move to high nose cone designs - which allow better use of airflow underneath the car, and to a lesser extent the front wing - location of these lower arms has proven problematic. For ideal suspension geometry, and hence maximum mechanical grip, the lower arms should be long and near parallel with the road. As there is no longer any structural bodywork in these low positions, extensions were developed to allow the suspension to be mounted with correct geometry. Since the advent of high nose designs in the early 1990s, pioneered on the Tyrrell 019 Formula One car, three major keel designs have emerged to solve this problem: The Ferrari F2005 has a conventional single keel design in the 2000s :Single-keel: Perhaps the simplest response, utilising a single, planar extension to the ventral surface of the car's nose cone, providing a plate onto which the proximal ends of the suspension arms can be mounted. Benefits include a simple construction design, and the flexibility of having a large surface, thus allowing the suspension geometry to be altered for fine tuning. A serious hindrance in the single-keel design is that the keel itself protrudes into the underbody airflow, thus reducing the benefits of the raised nose design. As a consequence of this the single keel design fell out of favour in the late 2000s. However, for the 2010 Formula One season both the Mercedes MGP W01 and Virgin VR-01 feature single keel front suspension. Short twin keels in use on the Sauber C22. :Twin-keel: As the name suggests, rather than one single keel, two shorter keel stubs are used. Each protrudes from the underside or lower corners of the nose cone, and the left and right suspension arms are mounted to the appropriate keel. This design reduces the disturbance to the airflow, but compromises the suspension set up and configuration flexibility, and introduces significant structural complexity and weight. The twin-keel concept was conceived by Harvey Postlethwaite during his time at Honda Racing Developments, before being introduced by Sauber during the 2000 Formula One season and swiftly copied by many other teams. In , only Red Bull Racing used a twin-keel chassis. A V-keel in use on the 2006 Red Bull RB2. :V-keel: Used principally by the Renault F1 team, who introduced the design in , this variant uses two keel elements protruding downward in a V shape. The tips of the elements are fused, and at this point the suspension arms are mounted. Something of a compromise position, benefits include a reduction in disturbance to the underbody airflow in comparison to a single-keel design, with fewer geometry restrictions than with twin-keels. Zero keel design as employed on the BMW Sauber F1.07. Note the lower suspension arms mounted directly onto the lower edge of the nosecone, and the angle between the arms and road surface necessary for this arrangement. One limitation of any keel design is that, while the keel influence may vary, the suspension linkages themselves still disrupt the underbody airflow. This problem was exacerbated when the FIA introduced rule changes in that forced teams to mount their front wing in a more elevated position. In response to this, many F1 teams have developed zero-keel chassis designs. Here the keel is removed entirely, and the suspension is mounted directly to the chassis. As the nose cone is in a raised position, this entails that the suspension arms take a distinctly inclined angle with respect to the road surface, reducing suspension efficiency. However, with continued restrictions to aerodynamic downforce through the use of aerofoil wings, and the lighter V8 engines specified from 2006 onwards causing weight distribution to shift forward, many designers apparently consider this drawback to be less significant than the concomitant increase in venturi downforce generated underneath the car; except for Renault and Red Bull, all of the teams in the 2007 Formula One World Championship used a zero-keel design.

Early web syndication standards included Information and Content Exchange (ICE) and RSS. More recent specifications include Atom and GData.  Predecessors Web syndication specifications were preceded by several formats in push and metadata technologies, few of which achieved widespread popularity, as many, such as Backweb and Pointcast, were intended to work only with a single service. Between 1995 and 1997, Ramanathan V. Guha and others at Apple Computer's Advanced Technology Group developed the Meta Content Framework (MCF). MCF was a specification for structuring metadata information about web sites and other data, implemented in HotSauce, a 3D flythrough visualizer for the web. When the research project was discontinued in 1997, Guha left Apple for Netscape. Guha and the XML co-creator Tim Bray extended MCF into an XML application that Netscape submitted to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) as a proposed web standard in June 1997. This submission contributed towards the emergence of the Resource Description Framework (RDF). In March 1997, Microsoft submitted a detailed specification for the 'push' technology Channel Definition Format (CDF) to the W3C. This format was designed for the Active Channel feature of Internet Explorer 4.0. CDF never became popular, perhaps because of the extensive resources it required at a time when people were mostly on dial-up. Backweb and Pointcast were geared towards news, much like a personal application programming interface (API) feed. Backweb later morphed into providing software updates, a precursor to the push update features used by various companies now. In September 1997, Netscape previewed a new, competing technology named \\"Aurora,\\" based on RDF, a metadata model whose first public working draft would be posted the next month by a W3C working group that included representatives of many companies, including R.V. Guha of Netscape. In December 1997, Dave Winer designed his own XML format for use on his Scripting News weblog. Early web syndication: ICE and RSS The first standard created specifically for web syndication was Information and Content Exchange (ICE), which was proposed by Firefly Networks and Vignette in January 1998. The ICE Authoring Group included Microsoft, Adobe, Sun, CNET, National Semiconductor, Tribune Media Services, Ziff Davis and Reuters, amongst others, and was limited to thirteen companies. The ICE advisory council included nearly a hundred members. ICE was submitted to the World Wide Web Consortium standards body on 26 October 1998, and showcased in a press event the day after. The standard failed to benefit from the open- source implementation that W3C XML specifications often received. RDF Site Summary, the first web syndication format to be called \\"RSS\\", was offered by Netscape in March 1999 for use on the My Netscape portal. This version became known as RSS 0.9. In July 1999, responding to comments and suggestions, Dan Libby produced a prototype tentatively named RSS 0.91 (RSS standing for Rich Site Summary at that time), that simplified the format and incorporated parts of Winer's scripting news format. This they considered an interim measure, with Libby suggesting an RSS 1.0-like format through the so-called Futures Document. In April 2001, in the midst of AOL's acquisition and subsequent restructuring of Netscape properties, a re-design of the My Netscape portal removed RSS/XML support. The RSS 0.91 DTD was removed during this re-design, but in response to feedback, Dan Libby was able to restore the DTD, but not the RSS validator previously in place. In response to comments within the RSS community at the time, Lars Marius Garshol, to whom authorship of the original 0.9 DTD is sometimes attributed, commented, \\"What I don't understand is all this fuss over Netscape removing the DTD. A well-designed RSS tool, whether it validates or not, would not use the DTD at Netscape's site in any case. There are several mechanisms which can be used to control the dereferencing of references from XML documents to their DTDs. These should be used. If not the result will be as described in the article.\\" Effectively, this left the format without an owner, just as it was becoming widely used. Initial adoption of RSS (2000‚Äì2003) A working group and mailing list, RSS-DEV, was set up by various users and XML notables to continue its development. At the same time, Winer unilaterally posted a modified version of the RSS 0.91 specification to the Userland website, since it was already in use in their products. He claimed the RSS 0.91 specification was the property of his company, UserLand Software. Since neither side had any official claim on the name or the format, arguments raged whenever either side claimed RSS as its own, creating what became known as the RSS fork. The RSS-DEV group went on to produce RSS 1.0 in December 2000. Like RSS 0.9 (but not 0.91) this was based on the RDF specifications, but was more modular, with many of the terms coming from standard metadata vocabularies such as Dublin Core. Nineteen days later, Winer released by himself RSS 0.92, a minor and supposedly compatible set of changes to RSS 0.91 based on the same proposal. In April 2001, he published a draft of RSS 0.93 which was almost identical to 0.92. A draft RSS 0.94 surfaced in August, reverting the changes made in 0.93, and adding a type attribute to the description element. In September 2002, Winer released a final successor to RSS 0.92, known as RSS 2.0 and emphasizing \\"Really Simple Syndication\\" as the meaning of the three-letter abbreviation. The RSS 2.0 spec removed the type attribute added in RSS 0.94 and allowed people to add extension elements using XML namespaces. Several versions of RSS 2.0 were released, but the version number of the document model was not changed. In November 2002, The New York Times began offering its readers the ability to subscribe to RSS news feeds related to various topics. In January 2003, Winer called the New York Times' adoption of RSS the \\"tipping point\\" in driving the RSS format's becoming a de facto standard. In July 2003, Winer and Userland Software assigned ownership of the RSS 2.0 specification to his then workplace, Harvard's Berkman Center for the Internet & Society. Development of Atom (2003) In 2003, the primary method of web content syndication was the RSS family of formats. Developers who wished to overcome the limitations of these formats were unable to make changes directly to RSS 2.0 because the specification was copyrighted by Harvard University and \\"frozen,\\" stating that \\"no significant changes can be made and it is intended that future work be done under a different name\\". In June 2003, Sam Ruby set up a wiki to discuss what makes \\"a well-formed log entry.\\" This posting acted as a rallying point. People quickly started using the wiki to discuss a new syndication format to address the shortcomings of RSS. It also became clear that the new format could also form the basis of a more robust replacement for blog editing protocols such as Blogger API and LiveJournal XML-RPC Client/Server Protocol. The project aimed to develop a web syndication format that was: * \\"100% vendor neutral,\\" * \\"implemented by everybody,\\" * \\"freely extensible by anybody, and\\" * \\"cleanly and thoroughly specified.\\" In short order, a project road map was built. The effort quickly attracted more than 150 supporters including Dave Sifry of Technorati, Mena Trott of Six Apart, Brad Fitzpatrick of LiveJournal, Jason Shellen of Blogger, Jeremy Zawodny of Yahoo!, Timothy Appnel of the O'Reilly Network, Glenn Otis Brown of Creative Commons and Lawrence Lessig. Other notables supporting Atom include Mark Pilgrim, Tim Bray, Aaron Swartz, Joi Ito, and Jack Park. Also, Dave Winer, the key figure behind RSS 2.0, gave tentative support to the Atom endeavor (which at the time was called Echo.) After this point, discussion became chaotic, due to the lack of a decision-making process. The project also lacked a name, tentatively using \\"Pie,\\" \\"Echo,\\" and \\"Necho\\" before settling on Atom. After releasing a project snapshot known as Atom 0.2 in early July 2003, discussion was shifted off the wiki. The discussion then moved to a newly set up mailing list. The next and final snapshot during this phase was Atom 0.3, released in December 2003. This version gained widespread adoption in syndication tools, and in particular it was added to several Google-related services, such as Blogger, Google News, and Gmail. Google's Data APIs (Beta) GData are based on Atom 1.0 and RSS 2.0. Atom 1.0 and IETF standardization In 2004, discussions began about moving the Atom project to a standards body such as the W3C or the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The group eventually chose the IETF and the Atompub working group was formally set up in June 2004, finally giving the project a charter and process. The Atompub working group is co-chaired by Tim Bray (the co-editor of the XML specification) and Paul Hoffman. Initial development was focused on the syndication format. The final draft of Atom 1.0 was published in July 2005 and was accepted by the IETF as a \\"proposed standard\\" in August 2005. Work then continued on the further development of the publishing protocol and various extensions to the syndication format. The Atom Syndication Format was issued as a proposed \\"internet official protocol standard\\" in IETF RFC 4287 in December 2005 with the help of the co-editors Mark Nottingham and Robert Sayre. Post-Atom technical developments related to web syndication In January 2005, Sean B. Palmer, Christopher Schmidt, and Cody Woodard produced a preliminary draft of RSS 1.1. It was intended as a bugfix for 1.0, removing little-used features, simplifying the syntax and improving the specification based on the more recent RDF specifications. As of July 2005, RSS 1.1 had amounted to little more than an academic exercise. In April 2005, Apple released Safari 2.0 with RSS Feed capabilities built in. Safari delivered the ability to read RSS feeds, and bookmark them, with built-in search features. Safari's RSS button is a blue rounded rectangle with \\"RSS\\" written inside in white. The favicon displayed defaults to a newspaper icon. In November 2005, Microsoft proposed its Simple Sharing Extensions to RSS. In December 2005, Microsoft announced in blogs that Internet Explorer 7 and Microsoft Outlook 12 (Outlook 2007) will adopt the feed icon16px first used in the Mozilla Firefox, effectively making the orange square with white radio waves the industry standard for both RSS and related formats such as Atom. Also in February 2006, Opera Software announced they too would add the orange square in their Opera 9 release. In January 2006, Rogers Cadenhead relaunched the RSS Advisory Board in order to move the RSS format forward. In January 2007, as part of a revitalization of Netscape by AOL, the FQDN for my.netscape.com was redirected to a holding page in preparation for an impending relaunch, and as a result some news feeders using RSS 0.91 stopped working. The DTD has again been restored.

It is located near Lusby, Maryland, United States, on the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay, which exports liquefied natural gas (LNG) and also stores gas. LNG is exported on specially designed ships known as LNG carriers. The shipping dock () is located about from the plant's storage tanks () and is connected by pipes in an underwater tunnel.diagram of system accessed 2012-01-02 The site also contains a liquefaction plant. The terminal is owned by Dominion Resources, with Berkshire Hathaway Energy a minority owner. Retrieved 2010-01-14 History The facility was originally certified in 1972 for the importation of Algerian LNG for resale by the Columbia and Consolidated Natural Gas systems. Cove Point began receiving LNG imported from Algeria between 1978 and 1980. On October 6, 1979, LNG vapors leaking from a pump exploded, causing 1 death, 1 critical injury, and major damage to the facility.https://www.ntsb.gov/safety/safety- recs/recletters/P79_31.pdf The Algerians requested a higher price for the LNG, which the company found unacceptable, so shipment volume decreased and the terminal fell into disuse. In 1994, the facility was transformed into a facility to store domestic natural gas. A liquefaction unit was installed that cools natural gas to the point where it becomes a liquid, around . The facility continued to use the original LNG storage tanks and gasifier units. Both the storage and import activity are subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) under the Natural Gas Act. Retrieved 2010-01-14 In 2001, various parties agreed to resume imports at the facility, while continuing its storage operations. Following the construction of a fifth LNG storage tank, imports resumed in the summer of 2003. Imported LNG suppliers include BG LNG, Shell LNG, and Statoil. In 2006, FERC authorized a further expansion of Cove Point's import capacity on an unregulated basis, with Statoil holding the expanded capacity.http://elibrary.ferc.gov/idmws/common/opennat.asp?fileID=11065180 Retrieved 2007-02-16 Storage capacity has recently expanded from 7.8 billion cubic feet of natural gas to the current 14.6 billion cubic feet. Expansion of facility to export LNG On 1 April 2013, Dominion filed an application with the FERC (Docket Number CP13-113) for expansion of the Cove Point facilities for gas liquefaction and export. The proposed expansion is projected to cost $3.4 billion to $3.8 billion. The export project is expected to be completed in late 2017, after which the facility will be bidirectional (being capable of importation and exportation of LNG). The export facility will have capacity to handle per day of natural gas.https://www.dominionenergy.com/about-us/natural-gas-projects/cove- point/cove-point-terminal Retrieved 2017-11-27 In 2020, Berkshire Hathaway Energy took a 25 percent stake in the facility. Controversies In 2001, when the plant was scheduled to reopen, many local residents were concerned about the proximity to Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant (3 miles), and the damage that could be caused by an attack or an explosion at the plant. Residents thought that the FERC did not consider the risks before opening the plant. Because the LNG at Cove Point contains a higher heat content than domestic natural gas, a local gas utility which receives LNG from Cove Point, Washington Gas Light Company, complained in 2005 that its customers were adversely affected by this \\"hot\\" gas. As a result, the parties agreed to limit the heat content of the output of the terminal to 1075 Btu per ft¬≥ (40.05 MJ/m¬≥) by diluting it with nitrogen gas. Subsequently, Washington Gas Light experienced a 16-fold increase in gas leaks on residential service connections in Prince George's County, Maryland, which is served directly by pipeline from the plant. These leaks come from mechanical couplings which contain rubber gaskets. Washington Gas Light claims that because the Cove Point gas has less hexane and other heavy hydrocarbons than does domestic natural gas, the Cove Point gas causes the gaskets to dry out and leak. Cove Point disputes these claims and argues that Washington Gas's arguments are flawed and the expansion will not cause additional leaks in the District of Columbia and Northern Virginia suburbs as the area served by unblended LNG increases. In 2006, Cove Point filed a rate increase with FERC proposing to raise the prices it charges to customers in Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland by 109 percent.http://elibrary.ferc.gov/idmws/common/opennat.asp?fileID=11078232 Retrieved 2007-02-16 The proposed liquefaction project has been approved and Cove Point has begun construction with the target date of late 2017 to begin exporting LNG from the facility.

He is a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Oscars.org (AMPAS). His formative years were spent as a storyboard artist for Walt Disney, and animation director for MTV's Daria and the Emmy-nominated Downtown. Smith spent five years in Singapore as a professor at the graduate film program for New York University Tisch School of the Arts, under artistic director/filmmaker Oliver Stone. Patrick is a fellow of the New York Foundation of the Arts and a curator for multiple international film and animation festivals. He lives and works in Montauk New York with his wife, Kaori Ishida and their daughter. The beginning of his animation career has been told by himself like this: > In 1994, I was in college, and one night decided to animate something > strange. I didn't know how to draw, let alone animate, so I just did > something abstract. A friend of mine told me I should put an logo on it and > send it to MTV. So I mailed a VHS of it to \\"MTV Networks\\" the address I got > from the phone book. About two weeks later I got a call from a guy named > Abbey, who said that they wanted to buy it. I remember the day he called, > because it was the same day that I got my rejection letter from Cal Arts. I > re-animated the same thing, a bit tighter.

He later played with the bands Loose Gravel and the Flamin' Groovies. Early life and the Charlatans Wilhelm was born in Los Angeles on March 18, 1942, and first learned to play blues guitar in his teens, from legendary Tennessee bluesman Walter \\"Brownie\\" McGhee. He served for a short time in the U.S. Navy before starting his professional music career as an opening act for the Chambers Brothers. In 1964, Wilhelm became a founding member of the Charlatans. The band's music had more pronounced jug band, country and blues influences than many other Bay Area groups, while their distinctive late 19th-century fashions exerted a strong influence on the Summer of Love in San Francisco. The Charlatans' recorded output was small, with their one and only studio album, The Charlatans, appearing in 1969, two years after the band's 1965‚Äì1967 heyday. Despite being influential on the San Francisco counter-culture scene during the late 1960s, the Charlatans never managed to break into the national Billboard charts and broke up at the end of 1969. During the 1960s, when the photographer Herb Green asked Jerry Garcia who his favorite guitarist was, Garcia responded \\"Mike Wilhelm\\" without hesitation. A version of Buffy St. Marie's \\"Codine\\", recorded by The Charlatans in 1966, was used in the movie Boys Don't Cry during Hilary Swank's sex change scene. The song's guitar solo, one of Wilhelm's favorites, was deleted from the movie soundtrack and the Charlatans had to sue the director of the film to receive royalties. Loose Gravel and the Flamin' Groovies After the Charlatans disbanded, Wilhelm formed a trio called Loose Gravel in the early 1970s. Wilhelm famously gave Bill Graham \\"the finger\\" in the movie Fillmore, when Graham refused to let Loose Gravel perform in the film. Graham liked the scene where Mike gave him the finger so much that he left it in the movie. Loose Gravel only released one single during their existence, but there have been several subsequent issues of material. After Loose Gravel broke up, Wilhelm spent six years as lead guitarist with the Flamin' Groovies and toured Europe and elsewhere with the band. He played on two of the Flamin' Groovies studio albums, Flamin' Groovies Now (1978) and Jumpin' in the Night (1979). Both albums were reissued as part of the Groovies' three-CD set, Bust Out at Full Speed: The Sire Years. Later career Wilhelm also released several solo albums, including Wilhelm, Wood & Wire, and Mean Ol' Frisco. The latter album featured musical contributions from original Charlatans member Richard Olsen, ex-members of Quicksilver Messenger Service John Cipollina and Greg Elmore, and songs by harmonica player and photographer Sandy Guy Schoenfeld. Wilhelm, Cipollina, Schoenfeld, and Eric Rhein from the Mean 'Ol Frisco album sessions can all be seen in the 1988 film '68 as musicians playing a 1960s-style free concert in the park. In 1987, Wilhelm performed with Schoenfeld as a duo at the San Francisco Harmonic Convergence Festival and two weeks later with members of the Bay Area Supergroup The Dinosaurs, at the 20th Anniversary of the Summer of Love concert in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. In addition, Wilhelm also participated in the recording of the as yet unreleased Austin Sessions album with Freddie Steady Krc. In the mid-1990s, Wilhelm was involved in the remixing of unreleased demos and recording sessions by his old band the Charlatans for Big Beat Records' The Amazing Charlatans CD. This remixing work for the album was largely done during his spare time, when he was not roofing his house. In 2005, Wilhelm was involved in a reunion of the Charlatans for a performance at a memorial concert for Family Dog founder Chet Helms in Golden Gate Park. The band reformed again, two years later, for a free concert commemorating the 40th Anniversary of the Summer of Love in San Francisco. Wilhelm later performed with the Bottle Rock Blues & Rhythm Band in Lake County, California, where he lived with his wife, Ana Maria, their cat, Felix and dog, Boogity.

It debuted with a Sunday strip on March 11, 1900 in the William Randolph Hearst newspapers, and was one of the first popular comics with King Features Syndicate. The strip ran for three decades, ending on August 14, 1932. Characters and story The strip told the adventures of a well-meaning hobo who encountered a lot of misfortune and bad luck, partly because of his appearance and low position in society, but who did not lose his smile over it. He was contrasted by his two brothers, the sour Gloomy Gus and the snobbish Montmorency, both just as poor as Happy. Montmorency wore a top hat and monocle but was otherwise as ragged as his siblings. Happy Hooligan detail, from- Hoist, the Friend of the Comic People in 1906. \\"Hoist\\" is William Randolph Hearst The archivist Jennifer Huebscher wrote that Opper may have taken inspiration for the Happy Hooligan's look from an illustration done by cartoonist Oscar Bradley depicting a Minnesotan acrobat and vaudeville entertainer named Fred Lowe. Lowe performed in the 1910s and onward under the moniker \\"The Original Happy Hooligan\\". Like the other major comics by Opper, And Her Name Was Maud and Alphonse and Gaston, Happy Hooligan initially did not run on a regular schedule, skipping Sundays from time to time, while some other weeks two pages appeared at once; the character also played a role in some of Opper's daily strips. After a few years, though, Happy Hooligan became a regular feature with both daily strips and Sunday pages. The Sunday strip changed titles and focus many times during the 1910s and 20s. The Happy Hooligan Sunday feature went on hiatus after January 16, 1916; when it returned on June 18, 1916, it was called Happy Hooligan's Honeymoon, a title which stuck until April 7, 1918. The next week, it was back to Happy Hooligan until May 26. Starting June 23, the strip was called Dubb Family, and didn't feature any appearances by Happy Hooligan; this title lasted until September 29. From October 6 to November 17, the strip was back to Happy Hooligan, and then switched to Mister Dubb from December 8, 1918 to April 24, 1921. For the next two years‚ÄîMay 1, 1921 to July 29, 1923‚Äîthe Sunday strip was called Down on the Farm. The title swapped again‚Äînow called Mister Dough and Mister Dubb‚Äîfrom Aug 9, 1925 to January 9, 1927, and then reverted to Happy Hooligan for the rest of the run, until 1932. Books Theater ribbon for play based on the comic strip Frederick Opper's Happy Hooligan (April 9, 1905) Opper was one of the most popular comic creators of his time. Happy Hooligan and his other popular strips were collected in book form and developed into merchandise products. The comic got translated as well and was, together with the Katzenjammer Kids and And Her Name Was Maud, one of the first North American comics to be published in Argentina, as Cocoliche. The comic was also probably the very first American comic strip adapted for films, when J. Stuart Blackton directed six live-action shorts (1900‚Äì03). Some 15 years later, it was adapted for more than 50 animated cartoons, released from 1916 to 1921. Beginning in 1904, Opper drew And Her Name Was Maud, about the kicking mule Maud, into comic strips and books, but on May 23, 1926, he positioned And Her Name Was Maud as the topper to his Happy Hooligan, and it ran along with Happy Hooligan until both strips came to a conclusion on October 14, 1932. As Opper did not use an assistant, the series ended in 1932 when Opper abandoned it due to failing eyesight. While lacking lasting popularity, the series remained influential and inspired other cartoonists such as Rube Goldberg and Jules Feiffer (who compared the title character to President Gerald Ford) and was also arguably a major inspiration for Charlie Chaplin's The Tramp character. It was called \\"Opper's greatest comic character\\" by comics artist Coulton Waugh. Happy Hooligan is also cited as the first comic to use speech balloons on a regular basis as an integral part of the comic (The Yellow Kid used speech balloons as early as 1896 but did not use them as the main means of communication). Sam's Strip In the early 1960s, Happy Hooligan was a semi- regular character in Sam's Strip; dozens of other comic-strip characters had appeared as \\"guests\\" in the strip, but Hooligan appeared so often that he was eventually treated as a regular member of the cast.Sam's Strip at ComicsWorthReading.com References Frederick Opper's Happy Hooligan (October 23, 1921) Everything not directly referenced in the text can be sourced to the Toonopedia entry for Happy Hooligan.

Durand. Hydrolysis of hydrastine yields hydrastinine, which was patented by Bayer as a haemostatic drug during the 1910s. It is present in Hydrastis canadensis (thus the name) and other plants of the family Ranunculaceae. Total synthesis The first attempt for the total synthesis of hydrastine was reported by Sir Robert Robinson and co-workers in 1931. Following studies where the synthesis of the key lactonic amide intermediate (structure 4 in figure) was the most troublesome, the major breakthrough was achieved in 1981 when J. R. Falck and co-workers reported a four-step total synthesis of hydrastine from simple starting materials. The key step in the Flack synthesis was using a Passerini reaction to construct the lactonic amide intermediate 4. :Falck‚Äôs total synthesis of hydrastine, the mechanism of the Passerini reaction for synthesis of the key intermediate is also illustrated Starting from a simple phenylbromide variant 1, alkylation reaction with lithium methylisocyanide gives the isocyanide intermediate 2. Reacting isocyanide intermediate 2 with opianic acid 3 initiated the intramolecular Passerini reaction to give the key lactonic amide intermediate 4. The tetrahydro- isoquinolin ring was formed by first a ring-closure reaction under dehydration conditions using POCl3 and then a catalyzed hydrogenation using PtO2 as the catalyst.

Plot A young woman, Fati, dies in a hospital. Her family is devastated when they discover her death was self-inflicted. She leaves a letter revealing her suicide is a result of being raped by Mansour Ab-Mangol‚Äîthe brother of a friend who did nothing to stop it. Fati's older brother Farman, an ex street thug who now runs a butcher-shop, decides to confront Mansour. His uncle persuades him not to exact revenge; Farman struggles with his anger, and ultimately decides to give up his knife before confronting Mansour. Farman's encounter with Mansour quickly degenerates into a fight, as Mansour's two younger brothers, Karim and Rahim, stand back and watch. Farman strangles Mansour, nearly killing the man. Rahim tells Karim to save their brother; Karim furiously stabs Farman, killing him. The three brothers dispose of Farman's body in a wasteland, planting the knife he was stabbed with next to him. Qeysar, Farman's younger brother who works in Khuzestan, returns home bearing gifts for his family, only to find his siblings dead and his mother and uncle devastated. Despite his uncle's protests, Qeysar decides to take revenge, swearing to kill all three Ab-Mangol brothers one by one. He follows Karim to a public bath, where he stabs him to death in a shower cubicle. He then seeks out Rahim, and finds him working in a slaughterhouse. Qeysar murders Rahim, leaving him butchered amid the cattle. The revenge spree is set aside when Qeysar is distracted by a former lover, Azam, only until he realizes he must abandon his love to finish off the path of revenge he has started. Mansour goes into hiding, desperately afraid for his life. By this time the police have realized that Qeysar is the primary suspect in the murders; they pursue him. Qeysar's mother dies, only aggravating matters and strengthening Qeysar's desire for revenge. The police pursue Qeysar at his mother's funeral, but he manages to elude them. He learns that Mansour has a girlfriend, Soheila Ferdos, an erotic dancer and singer. He visits Soheila and seduces her. She takes him back to her apartment, where he discovers the location of Mansour's hideout, a railway siding. Qeysar makes his way straight for Mansour. Mansour spots him and attempts to escape; Qeysar catches him. The two men fight. Mansour stabs Qeysar, badly wounding him, and flees from the scene. The Police arrive, forcing Mansour back in the direction he came, back towards the wounded Qeysar, who summons just enough strength to kill Mansour in a final fight. Qeysar stands tall, but only for a moment. The police spot him and he attempts to flee but is shot in the leg. Badly wounded, he tries to hide in an old train carriage. The police move in on him.

Her death following an abortion performed illegally by two doctors made headlines in 1929. Early life and career Walsh was born Delphine Dockertyhttps://www.classicactresses.org/2020/01/delphine-walsh- killed-by-back-alley.html in Bisbee, Arizona. Her father, Thomas Dougherty (1869-1929),https://images.findagrave.com/photos/2020/18/206346267_f69d5e63-4087-4ac4-b590-2dd83d51cfcd.jpeg worked as a copper miner. She had an older sister, Dorothy (1902-1983). Due to poverty, Walsh's parents gave her up for adoption when she was 6 years old. She was adopted by Mrs. Mae Walsh, who later gave her dance lessons. Walsh left Arizona and traveled to Los Angeles to become a dancer. She was immediately popular with booking agencies and began to establish herself in the theatrical world. Death Walsh died on May 3, 1929 in a Glendale, California hospital two days after undergoing what the media then referred to as an \\"illegal operation\\". Walsh had actually undergone an abortion. Before her death, she implicated Dr. R.S. Lanterman and Dr. P.S. Traxler. Her death certificate lists her cause of death as Septic peritonitis following criminal abortion.https://www.classicactresses.org/2020/01/delphine-walsh-killed-by- back-alley.html Lanterman, who was a Los Angeles coroner, had a history of legal troubles. In 1907, he was arrested at a bordello for being drunk and disorderly. The charges in that case were eventually dropped when a witness failed to appear to testify against Lanterman. He resigned as coroner in 1908 but was later indicated on charges of fraud after falsifying and submitted documents regarding his election and travel expenses to the Board of Supervisors. He was sentenced to a year in prison in April 1908, but his sentence was overturned in 1909. In 1916, he was charged after performing an abortion on a 17-year-old girl, but was later freed on a technicality. The following year, he was charged in connection with the death of Mrs. Regina Greenburg \\"Reggie\\" Evans. Evans died after Lanterman allegedly performed her abortion. Evans reportedly told her brother while she was dying that Lanterman performed the abortion but later told people at County Hospital that she had attempted the abortion herself. Lanterman denied the charges stating that they were \\"spite work\\" made by his political enemies. He was found not guilty and had his medical license reinstated in 1921 after a petition drive. The California State Medical Examiners presided over the Walsh investigation. Lanterman and Traxler were indicted on murder charges on May 14, 1929, and were free on $15,000 bond each. Actresses Natalie Joyce and Mildred Harris were interviewed by authorities. Joyce offered valuable information but the nature of her disclosure was kept confidential by Glendale officials. Harris confided that Walsh was a member of a troupe in which Harris played a leading part. However Harris did not know Walsh closely. Film director Mickey Moran was a key informant during the inquest, and he was a state witness in the subsequent trial. Authorities revealed that Walsh received a letter from a man from Vancouver, British Columbia approximately one week before she died. The letter contained a substantial sum of money which was believed to have been used to fund the operation. Lanterman and Traxler were represented by attorney Jerry Giesler. Both contended that Walsh caused her own death by performing an abortion on herself before requesting their assistance. Lanterman and Traxler were found not guilty, but both had their medical licenses revoked by the California State Board of Medical Examiners. Delphine was buried in an unmarked grave at Hollywood Forever cemetery in Los Angeles. In 2020 her fans organized a fundraiser and paid for a headstone to be placed.https://www.classicactresses.org/2020/01/delphine-walsh-killed-by-back- alley.html FootnotesReferences *Los Angeles Times, \\"Director To Be Quizzed Over Death\\", May 7, 1929, Page A12. *Los Angeles Times, \\"Dancer's Death Quiz Continues\\", May 8, 1929, Page A12. *Los Angeles Times, \\"Dancer Clews Lead Nowhere\\", May 10, 1929, Page A5. *Los Angeles Times, \\"Director To Actor At Death Trial\\", June 6, 1929, Page A20. 1907 births 1929 deaths American female dancers Dancers from California Burials at Hollywood Forever Cemetery 20th- century American dancers ","title":"Delphine Walsh"},{"id":"9539281","text":"Zane Taylor may refer to: *Zane Taylor (footballer) (born 1957), Australian rules footballer for Geelong and Southport *Zane Taylor (American football) (born 1988), American football center *Zane Taylor, a fictional character from the television series \\"Heroes\\" ","title":"Zane Taylor"},{"id":"9539287","text":"Roger Medearis (March 6, 1920 ‚Äì July 5, 2001) was an American Regionalist painter.Roger Medearis; American Artist Los Angeles Times, July 9, 2001.

Education Merriman was born in Knutsford, Cheshire, and educated at Winchester College. He did not go to university, but became an articled clerk with a firms of solicitors in Manchester, and later studied for the bar, and was a pupil in Gordon Hewart's chambers. He was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1904. During World War I, he served with the Manchester Regiment and was appointed OBE in 1918. After the war, Merriman was made a King's Counsel (KC) in 1919, and appointed Recorder of Wigan in 1920. Merriman had a large practice at the common law bar and on the Northern Circuit. Prominent cases in which he appeared include the 1927 libel case Wright v Gladstone, which arose of defamatory statements concerning the private life of former prime minister William Ewart Gladstone. In 1929, he represented Zionist organisations in front of the Shaw Commission, appointed to investigate the Palestine riots. Political and judicial career Merriman was elected at the 1924 general election as Member of Parliament (MP) for Manchester Rusholme, and served as Solicitor General under Stanley Baldwin from 1928 to 1929 and under Ramsay MacDonald from 1932 to 1933, receiving the customary knighthood upon appointment. He left Parliament in 1933, when he was appointed as President of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division of the High Court, when he was also sworn of the Privy Council. Under his presidency, the Division saw a steep decline in the volume of admiralty cases due to a worldwide decline in shipping, but a large increase in its divorce work, brought in part by the passage of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1937. In 1949, Merriman was considered for appointment as a lord of appeal in ordinary, but ultimately passed over in favour of Sir Cyril Radcliffe. Merriman was elevated to the peerage in 1941 as Baron Merriman, of Knutsford in the County Palatine of Chester. In 1950 he was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO).

The base of the tether is wound around the drum of a winch, which may be fixed or mounted on a vehicle, and is used to raise and lower the balloon. A balloon is a form of aerostat, along with the powered free-flying airship, although the American GAO has used the term \\"aerostat\\" to describe a tethered balloon in contrast to the powered airship. Tethered balloons have been used for advertising, recreation, observation, and civil or military uses. Design principles Tethered Aerostat Radar System American (TARS) aerostat with underslung radome. Early balloons were simple round spheres, with a payload hung beneath. The round shape uses the minimum material to accommodate a given volume of lifting gas, making it the lightest construction. However, in any significant wind the round shape is aerodynamically unstable and will bob about, risking damage or the balloon breaking free. To avoid this problem, the kite balloon was developed. This form has an elongated shape to reduce wind resistance and some form of tail surface to stabilize it so that it always points into the wind. Like the powered airship, such balloons are often called blimps.Wragg, D.; Historical Dictionary of Aviation, History Press, 2008, Pages 25‚Äì27: \\"Airship ... During the Second World War, the main combatants used barrage balloons, or blimps, to protect vital targets ...\\".Jonah Bromwich; Runaway Military Surveillance Blimp Drifts From Maryland to Pennsylvania, New York Times, 28 October 2015. A hybrid tethered balloon or kytoon is shaped to provide aerodynamic lift similar to a kite, as well as to reduce drag. History RAF Caquot kite balloon in 1918 Designed by Albert Caquot, a French engineer, in 1914, the barrage balloons of World War I and World War II were early examples of tethered balloons. Military observation balloons were also used extensively in World War I. These early types used hydrogen as their lifting gas. Tethered balloons are used for lifting cameras, radio antennas, electro-optical sensors, radio-relay equipment and advertising banners ‚Äì often for long durations. Tethered balloons are also used for position marking and bird control work. Typically, they use non-flammable helium gas to provide lift. Modern use=Advertising Tethered balloons are often used for advertising, either by lifting advertisement signs, or by using a balloon with advertisements written on, or attached to it. Often both methods are combined. It is not uncommon to use specially designed balloons. Blimp-shaped balloons are especially popular for advertising use. By suspending a light source within the envelope, the balloon can be illuminated at night, drawing attention to its message. Earth sciences The United States Geological Survey uses tethered balloons to carry equipment to places where conventional aircraft cannot go, such as above an erupting volcano. Tethered balloons are ideal as they can easily remain more or less in one place, are less likely to be damaged by volcanic ash, and are less expensive to operate than a helicopter. Leisure Tethered balloons are frequently used as a recreational attraction. Telecommunications Tethered blimp for telecomunications Tethered balloons can be used as temporary transmitters, instead of a radio mast, either by using the tether which holds the balloon as the antenna, or by carrying antennas on the balloon fed by a fiber optic or radio frequency cable contained inside the tether. The advantage of tethered balloons is that great antenna heights are easily attainable and they are cheaper than erecting a temporary mast. This allows for more localized coverage with a high capacity within a 50-mile radius of the balloon at an altitude between 1,500 and 2,000 feet above ground level. Tethered balloons or blimps have been studied to overcome the limitations of terrestrial cell towers for telecommunications. Because of their higher elevation they can provide a larger coverage area and better line of sight, would be more economical and would have better latency than satellite systems. Security and defense Tethered balloon used for military camp protection. Aerostat manufactured by A-NSE. During the 1990 Invasion of Kuwait, the first indication of the Iraqi ground advance was from a radar-equipped tethered balloon that detected Iraqi armor and air assets moving south. Tethered surveillance balloons were used in the 2004 American occupation of Iraq. They utilized a high-tech optics system to detect and observe enemies from miles away. They have been used to over watch foot patrols and convoys in Baghdad, Afghanistan, and are permanently installed above US military bases in Kabul and Bagram. The US Drug Enforcement Administration has contracted with Lockheed Martin to operate a series of radar-equipped tethered balloons to detect low-flying aircraft attempting to enter the United States. A total of twelve tethered balloons, called Tethered Aerostat Radar System, are positioned approximately 350 miles apart, from California to Florida to Puerto Rico, providing unbroken radar coverage along the entire southern border of the US. The U.S. Army has developed a tethered aerostat to perform operational testing at Aberdeen Proving Ground beginning in 2015. The system, called JLENS, uses two moored balloons designed to provide over-the-horizon missile defense capability.

The aircraft was also produced under licence as the B√∂lkow Bo 208. Development The BA-7 was designed by and flown by him in prototype form on 10 October 1958. He built this first plane in his spare time while working for Convair in the United States. It was powered by an air- cooled Continental A-75 engine giving 56 kW (75 hp) driving a two-bladed variable-pitch propeller. The shoulder wings were forward swept to place occupants ahead of the spar for visibility. In 1960 Andreasson returned to Sweden and started working at Malm√∂ Flygindustri where he designed an improved version of the BA-7 that went into production as the MFI-9 Junior. Changes included a larger cockpit and the powerplant was now a Continental O-200-A flat-four-cylinder air-cooled piston engine giving 75 kW (100 HP). In 1963 it was followed by the MFI-9B Trainer and then the MFI-9B Mili-Trainer. The MFI-9 uses a tricycle undercarriage. Between 1963 and 1971, 210 B√∂lkow Bo 208s were built under licence by B√∂lkow Apparatebau GmbH in Laupheim, Germany. Many examples survive in private hands and are most commonly found in Germany, the United Kingdom and Scandinavia. A limited number of airworthy examples can be found in both the United States and New Zealand. The most widely produced variant of the Bo 208 is the Bo 208C, which used a Continental O-200-A flat- four-cylinder air-cooled piston engine giving 75 kW (100 HP). A number of O-200 engines installed on Juniors were licence-built by Rolls-Royce in England. A 1966 B√∂lkow Bo 208C Junior, G-BSME (596), at Rotterdam Airport, The Netherlands MiniCOINs One variant of the MFI-9 which gained widespread fame was the MiniCOIN (an acronym for \\"Miniature Counter-Insurgency\\"), a modification of the MFI-9B military trainer variant of the MFI-9, adapted to carry weapons. The name and concept originated with Carl Gustaf von Rosen, who realized that in a low intensity conflict even a few small, minimally armed aircraft are capable of having a significant impact. Light aircraft are in any event more suitable for operation in the primitive conditions typical in such conflicts. Von Rosen was familiar with the military trainer version of the MFI-9, which was robust enough to be able to carry significant loads of ordnance suspended from hard points on the wings. A number of MFI-9Bs had been constructed in hopes of a sale to the Swedish Air Force, but when the sale fell through, the aircraft became available at a low price. So in May 1969, von Rosen formed a squadron of five MiniCOINs to fight in the Nigerian Civil War (1967‚Äì1970) on the side of the Biafrans in support of their effort to create an independent state. Von Rosen had the planes painted in camouflage colours and fitted with rockets from Matra, and proceeded with a band of friends to form a squadron called Biafra Babies to strike at the airfields from which the federal Nigerian Air Force launched their attacks against the civilian population in Biafra. On 22 May 1969, and over the next few days, Von Rosen and his five aircraft launched attacks against Nigerian airfields at Port Harcourt, Enugu, Benin and other small airports. The Nigerians were taken by surprise and a number of expensive jets, including a few MiG-17 fighters and three of Nigeria's six Ilyushin Il-28 bombers, were destroyed on the ground.Lynn Garrison in cockpit 1966 The pilots included Lynn Garrison among a group of other mercenariesThe Mercenaries in Time Magazine 25 October 1968 and Biafran-born pilots. Lynn Garrison co-ordinated the attacks, personally destroying an Ilyushin Il-28 and a MiG-17 during the first raid on Port Harcourt. The MiniCOINs saw extensive service during most of the war, including the delivery of food aid drops. Garrison introduced a supply- dropping procedure learned in northern Canada. A bag of grain was enclosed in a larger bag before dropping; when the load hit the ground, the inner bag would rupture, while the outer bag contained the contents. Many lives were saved through air drops using this simple concept. A total of 18 was supplied.

Its name in Latin is unknown. Today it stands at the centre of Holyhead in the Welsh county of Anglesey. Holyhead is named Caergybi in Welsh, after the fort. The fort is one of Europe's only three-walled Roman forts. The fourth side fronted the sea and was probably the site of a quay. Its date is unknown, but it is generally thought to be part of a late-4th- century scheme, associated with Segontium, which was used to defend the west coast against Irish sea-raiders. The Romans also built a watch tower, within Mynydd y Twr on the top of Holyhead Mountain, which was almost certainly used as the fort's look-out point. Both were possibly abandoned around 393, when the troops were sent to respond to the revolt of Eugenius of Gaul. In the 6th century, the old fort was given to Saint Cybi, who founded a monastery there. The Church of St Cybi still stands on the site today, with a small detached chapel (Eglwys y Bedd) that reputedly stands over Cybi's grave.

Inspector who is investigating the case is determined to find the person responsible for the accident despite his superiors' indifference towards the case. Months after Amar's death, a highly respected and talented business worker named Sekhar Tarun offers to re-build and restore Varma Industries without any compensation, stating Amar met him in India and offered him a job before his death. He is given the chance and goes about the uphill task of making the company viable again. Gradually, Sekhar heals the gaping wound left in the Varma family by Amar's death and they come to accept him as one of the family. What they don't know ‚Äî except for Sunil Sunil, Sekhar's friend in Germany ‚Äî is that it was Sekhar's jeep that accidentally had hit Amar after he swerved to avoid hitting an innocent girl who had walked into the road, causing his death.

It was established in 1904. Since 1950, the HAGS is subordinated to the Hellenic National Defence General Staff. Historically, most Chiefs of Staff have come from the Artillery arm. History Although the first regular army units were raised as early as 1821‚Äì1822, on the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence, the first rudimentary general staff organization, in the form of the General Staff Officers Corps (Œ£œéŒºŒ± ŒìŒµŒΩŒπŒ∫œéŒΩ ŒïœÄŒπœÑŒµŒªœéŒΩ), was created only in 1833, after the establishment of the independent Kingdom of Greece. The first attempt to create a permanent staff service was made in 1877, when the Army General Staff was first instituted. The experiment was short-lived, however, as it and the General Staff Officers Corps were abolished in 1880, and replaced by a simple Staff Service Bureau within the Ministry of Military Affairs. The modern Army General Staff traces its origin to 1900, when the Staff of the Army General Command was established as a staff for the Army General Commander, Crown Prince Constantine. In 1904, it was reconstituted as the General Staff of the Army General Command (ŒìŒµŒΩŒπŒ∫œå ŒïœÄŒπœÑŒµŒªŒµŒØŒø œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒìŒµŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒÆœÇ ŒîŒπŒøŒØŒ∫Œ∑œÉŒ∑œÇ Œ£œÑœÅŒ±œÑŒøœç), with greatly expanded authority over the organization, training and equipment of the Army. The General Staff Officers Corps was also reconstituted, while the Ministry's role was reduced. In 1909, following the Goudi coup, these changes were reversed again as the privileged position of the staff officers around Constantine was resented. Instead, the Army Staff Service was established, which retained its name until 1923, when it was finally renamed as the Army General Staff. In the period November 1917 to November 1920, the service was headed by French officers with a Greek deputy. In 1936, the Army General Staff was reorganized. In 1940‚Äì1941, during the Greco-Italian War and the subsequent German invasion of Greece, the Army General Staff served as the nucleus over the General Headquarters under the former Chief of the Army General Staff, Lt. General Alexander Papagos. Following the occupation of Greece by the Axis powers, the Greek armed forces were reconstituted in the Middle East by the Greek government in exile, along with a rudimentary Army General Staff. In December 1945, after Liberation, and again in 1948 and 1950, when the unified Ministry of National Defence was founded, the Army General Staff was reorganized. On 18 December 1968 the then-ruling military junta reorganized the Greek armed forces' command into a unified Armed Forces Headquarters. The Army General Staff was renamed as the Army Headquarters (ŒëœÅœáŒ∑Œ≥ŒµŒØŒø Œ£œÑœÅŒ±œÑŒøœç). This structure remained in force until 1 August 1977, when the previous structure was restored. Structure The Hellenic Army General Staff comprises its Commanding Officer (the Chief), the Staff proper, the Special Staff (comprising the directorates of the arms and corps) and the Army General Staff Battalion which comprises the conscript soldiers serving within it. The Staff proper comprises a number of directorates, grouped into four main branches (Œ∫ŒªŒ¨Œ¥ŒøŒπ): * 1st Branch (Œë' ŒöŒªŒ¨Œ¥ŒøœÇ), comprising the Operations, Intelligence-Security, Exercises, and Mobilization Directorates, and the NATO secretariat * 2nd Branch (Œí' ŒöŒªŒ¨Œ¥ŒøœÇ), comprising various personnel-related directorates, plus the religious affairs and music departments * 3rd Branch (Œì' ŒöŒªŒ¨Œ¥ŒøœÇ), dealing with logistical support * 4th Branch (Œî' ŒöŒªŒ¨Œ¥ŒøœÇ):, comprising organization, training and doctrine directorates Along with the various combat arms and auxiliary corps directorates, these are further grouped under the two Deputy Chiefs of Staff. The First Deputy Chief heads the 1st and 4th branches along with the main combat arms (infantry, armour, artillery, special forces, etc.), while the Second Deputy Chief heads the 2nd and 3rd branches and the support corps (transport, medical services, supply, etc.). In addition, the Inspectorate General of the Army (ŒìŒµŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒÆ ŒïœÄŒπŒ∏ŒµœéœÅŒ∑œÉŒ∑ Œ£œÑœÅŒ±œÑŒøœç, ŒìŒïŒ†Œ£) is a separate department with overarching authority.

Bollhusgr√§nd (Swedish: \\"Ball House Alley\\") is an alley in Gamla stan, the old town in central Stockholm, Sweden. Named after Bollhuset, a historical theatre, it connects Slottsbacken to K√∂pmantorget, and as Baggensgatan extends the alley further south beyond K√∂pmangatan, together they form a parallel street to √ñsterl√•nggatan and Sj√§lag√•rdsgatan. History The alley is named after its vicinity to the two royal ball game buildings constructed in 1627-1792 and 1648‚Äì53, the bigger of the two used as a theatre from 1667 and torn down in 1792‚Äì93, the smaller transformed into the Finnish Church in 1725 and still existent. In 1648 the alley was known as Donat Apotechars grend (\\"Alley of Pharmacist Donat\\") in reference to a Donat Deutschman living on the southeasternmost corner house facing the square K√∂pmantorget. On the north-west side of the street is the Tessin Palace, and on the opposite corner is the Royal Coin Cabinet. On the latter location was until 1903 a restaurant called Skomakare-K√§llaren, Caf√© & Restaurant (\\"Shoemaker-Basement\\") known as one of the best eating houses in town and decorated with a coffered ceiling, pilasters, cocklestove, and the symbol of the shoemaker's guild, a silver shoe with a jingle on the toecap. The restaurant was preceded by another called Drufvan (\\"The Grape\\"), later renamed to Draken (\\"The Dragon\\"). The restaurant is today part of the museum of the Royal Coin Cabinet. Together with Baggensgatan, Bollhusgr√§nd used to run along the interior of the eastern city wall, from the open space surrounding the castle Three Crowns (today still present as Slottsbacken) south to the Blackfriars monastery (until the Reformation located north of J√§rntorget between Svartmangatan and Pr√§stgatan). While the northern end of the alley is narrow, it widens where the carriages and horses of Tessin entered their palace on the alley's east side.

Its remains are located beneath the town of Loughor in the Welsh city of Swansea. The Romans built a rectangular or trapezoidal fort at the mouth of the River Loughor in the late 1st century to house a regiment of Roman auxiliary troops. Stone defences were added to the earthen ditch and rampart by 110 and the fort was occupied until the middle or end of that century. However, it was later abandoned for a time and in the early 3rd century the ditch naturally silted up. It appears to have been brought back into use during the rule of Carausius who was worried about Irish raids, but was abandoned again before the 4th century.

Soland, Utopian Communities of Illinois: Heaven on the Prairie (History Press 2017), p. 67 ‚Äì 13 May 1850) was the leader of a Swedish pietist sect that emigrated to the United States in 1846. Early and family life Jansson was born in Biskopskulla parish in Uppland, near Uppsala, the son of farmer Jan Mattsson and his wife, Sarah Eriksdotter. He was a frail child, and became interested in reforming the state Lutheran Church of Sweden as an adolescent. Believing that he was miraculously cured of rheumatism after experiencing a vision at age 22, Jannson became devoutly religious, and began reading works of the German mystic Johann Arndt.Soland pp. 67‚Äì68 Particularly after another mystical experience while visiting the market at Uppsala ten years later, Jansson developed beliefs that conflicted with the state catechism. Swedish ministry and conflicts By 1841 Jansson, though a layman was preaching in the Vastmanland province. Especially in Torstuna and Osterunda parishes his prayer meetings attracted considerable attention, including from the authorities. Jansson claimed to be able to exorcise demons and when contradicted, often managed to out-shout his opponents, although he still maintained good relations with the clergy, especially Rev. J.J. Risberg, an assistant minister in Ostersund who sometimes preached alongside him. However, Jansson came to break with the teachings of Luther and Arndt. By 1844, he claimed to be a true prophet speaking the word of God. Jansson wanted to create a \\"New Jerusalem\\" to await Christ's coming and the Millennium. He alienated Rev. Risberg and many others in the state Church, who came to question his sanity.Soland pp. 68‚Äì69 Jannson believed in the supremacy of the Bible and his own revelations, and beginning in 1844, publicly burned the works of Luther and others and urged his followers to do likewise. This occurred on a lake shore near the town of Alta in June 1844, near Soderala in October 1844 and in Stenbo and Forsa in December 1844. Authorities arrested him, but Jansson was released several times after his followers appealed to Sweden's King, who felt imprisonment inappropriate for religious beliefs. However, in 1845 Jansson's followers and opponents engaged in several violent confrontations in Vastmanland and Halsingland provinces. When Jansson voluntarily appeared at a court session at Delsbo in Gavleborg province to answer charges, he was returned to Gavle prison while investigations continued. A guard warned Jansson that a fellow prisoner was told he would be rewarded for killing Janssson, so he escaped disguised as a woman, and ultimately skied across the mountains to Christiana, Norway, where Jansson hid until January 1846.Soland pp. 69‚Äì70 Emigration to America After repeated brushes with the law in Sweden, and having outraged the hierarchy of the Church of Sweden, Jansson sailed from Oslo, Norway for the United States in 1846, under an assumed name and condemning his homeland to eternal damnation. About 1,200‚Äî1,500 followers sailed him across the Atlantic Ocean, perhaps in part because of the poor European harvest that year.The lower figure is from Nordisk familjebok, the higher from Barton, 16. A trusted follower, Olof Olsson, had been sent ahead in mid-1845 to locate a suitable place to settle in the United States. Olsson had arrived in New York on the Neptunus on 16 December 1845. There he met a fellow Swede, Olof Gustaf Hedstr√∂m, who suggested that Olsson contact his brother, Jonas Hedstr√∂m, who was living in Victoria, Illinois, Knox County near the Mississippi River. Other followers were not so lucky. Several vessels foundered during the cross-Atlantic voyage, drowning hundreds of Janssonists. Many others died from cholera during the trip, or soon after they arrived. Jansson arrived in New York in June 1846 and with the help of 400 of his followers who had survived the journey, founded the Bishop Hill Colony in Henry County, Illinois (adjacent to Knox County). He named the colony after his Swedish birthplace. Although 96 immigrants died during the first winter, housed in two separate dugouts or \\"mud caves\\" in ravines separated by gender, others continued to arrive from Sweden. Residents began their daily worship after Jansson rang a bell around 5:00a.m. and diligently studied English to proselytize their neighbors, as well as ground bushels of corn to boil all day for basic survival. When some tried to escape, Jansson posted guards.Soland pp. 72‚Äì73 Villagers lived as a collective religious colony for 15 years, from 1846 to 1861, tilling the soil, tending their animals, and building their settlement with handmade bricks. A large number of Shakers from Pleasant Hill, Kentucky joined the community, as did thirty converts from Hopedale, Massachusetts. When a fifth group of more than four hundred immigrants from Sweden arrived in 1847, the commune's population reached 700, but the subsequent severe winter led to food shortages and illness, and about 200 people left to join a nearby Methodist community, using personal wealth they had hidden in order to buy land.Soland p. 75 Some local pioneers were amazed by their lifestyle and the relative success that it generated, since after 1847 the community grew both cash crops and food for themselves, as well as manufactured carpet for sale (production would peak in 1857 at 150,000 yards before the new Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad would bring cheaper manufactured goods from Chicago and the east).Soland p. 77 Although Jansson had ordered celibacy during the lean years, in 1848, the year the community built the (still-standing) Colony Church, Jansson lifted the ban and conducted mass marriage ceremonies, arranging the marriages 83 of 102 couples married between 1848 and 1853. But the idyllic life in rural Illinois was not to last. His own wife, Maja Stina, died in a cholera outbreak which killed about 150 colonists. While Jansson remarried in September 1849, the doctor that the group brought from Nauvoo, Illinois to deal with the earlier outbreak proved both incompetent and expensive. Dr. Robert Foster foreclosed on some of Jansson's promissory notes so that 30 pairs of communal oxen, 94 calves and other communal livestock and possessions were auctioned off in 1849. In 1850, Jansson sent nine of his followers to California, hoping that they would prospect successfully during the California Gold Rush, and that this additional wealth would help support their community. Although nearly bankrupted by Dr. Foster, and despite the desertions, the colony of 100 men, 250 women and 200 children owned 4000 acres of land, a church, grist and flour mills, three dwellinghouses and five other buildings. Murder Three Swedish immigrant men had arrived from New Orleans in late 1848. While two soon left, one, named John Root, remained in the colony and in November 1849 married Jansson's cousin and ward, Charlotta Louisa Root (known as \\"Lotta\\"). Soon thereafter, Root become disaffected with the commune and wanted to leave Bishop Hill, but the other colonists prevented him from taking his family along. Moreover, Jansson had inserted a phrase in the marriage contract which specifically allowed Lotta the choice whether to leave, and she refused to accompany Root. On March 2, 1850 Root and another man kidnapped Lotta and her newborn son, but twelve Jansonnists pursued them and brought Lotta back. Root then turned to the courts, and again kidnapped her as she arrived at the local Henry County courthouse in Cambridge, Illinois as a witness, and took her to Chicago. Her sister Caroline got word that Lotta and the baby were at her house to Jansson, and their brother Jan rescued the mother and baby and brought them back to Bishop Hill voluntarily. Root tried another kidnapping on March 26, 1850, this time recruiting some brother Masons from Cambridge as assistants, but they left Bishop Hill empty-handed because Jansson hid Lotta and the baby, and ultimately fled with them across the Mississippi River to St. Louis, where he took a job as a flour salesman. Soland pp. 78‚Äì79 On May 12, 1850 followers listened to Jansson preach a sermon about a scriptural phrase in which Jesus prophesied about soon drinking in his Father's kingdom. The next day, May 13, 1850, while Jansson chatted with the Henry County Clerk at the Cambridge courthouse, Root ran up the stairs and into the courtroom, then shot and killed Jansson. Although some followers expected Jansson to rise on the third day, he did not, and the colony reconciled itself to his death.Soland p. 79 John Root was charged and convicted of manslaughter, but was released after serving just one year in prison before securing a pardon, but dying soon thereafter. Legacy Illinois' legislature issued a charter to Bishop Hill on January 17, 1853, and Jansson's longtime friend and follower Jonas Olson returned from California and came to lead the community, along with six other trustees. The village continued and prospered for several years, but suffered in the 1857 financial crisis. Community members learned that Olson had secretly speculated in now-worthless railroad and bank stock, which caused the community to split into two factions. Although Olson ordered celibacy and expelled those who disobeyed his order, in 1858 the community's men voted dissolve Bishop Hill.Soland pp. 79‚Äì80 The dissolution, with members receiving personal shares of community assets, took place by 1862, after the American Civil War broke out, although court cases dealing with accusations of mismanagement and division of the colony's property were not resolved until 1879. Both male and female members each received about 22 acres of farmland, as well as a timber lot and a farm lot. Although most stayed in the area, some moved to nearly Galva, Illinois (named for the seaport from which many had left Sweden) because it was on a railroad line that the Swedish community had been contracted to help build. By 1870, only 200 Janssonists lived at Bishop Hill, although at its peak the community had about 1,000 members. Most former members joined the local Methodist church, although some joined the Pleasant Hill Shakers and some the Seventh Day Adventists. The village is now Bishop Hill Historic District. In 1984, the surviving buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Illinois Historic Preservation Agency owns and operates the Bishop Hill State Historic Site including the Visitor's Center, Colony Church and Colony Hotel, as well as the park containing the original dugouts as an open-air museum. A brick museum houses a valuable collection of folk art paintings by colonist Olof Krans (1838‚Äì1916).Soland pp. 80‚Äì81 While there had been several Swedish immigrant colonies earlier in American history, notably the short-lived colony at New Sweden in Delaware and an ongoing community in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the Janssonist emigrants triggered a larger wave of Swedish immigration in the latter half of the 19th century. Letters home from Janssonists to their friends and family, telling of the fertile agricultural land in the interior of North America, stimulated substantial migration for several decades and the formation of a distinct Swedish-American ethnic community of the American Midwest including areas around Galesburg, Illinois as well as in Minnesota to the northwest. The transformation of the Bishop Hill Colony from religious sect in Sweden, to fledgling outpost, to prosperous economic engine, and finally to Swedish-American community, marks a unique pattern of Americanization and assimilation. Swanson (1998) has argued that this transformation and Americanization resulted from the degree of interaction between the colonists and the local citizens of Henry County: the colony was not insular, as the many documents held in archives of Bishop Hill demonstrate. The Bishop Hill Colony makes a useful contrast to the Mormons at Nauvoo, Illinois and the Amanas in Iowa, both rough contemporaries to Bishop Hill. Descendants Direct descendants of Erik Jansson still lived in the colony of Bishop Hill until December 20, 2005 when Jansson's great-great grandson and Bishop Hill volunteer fireman Theodore Arthur Myhre Sr. died while on a fire service call. Other known descendants remain elsewhere in Nevada, Alabama, California, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, and Texas. The pietist practices of Bishop Hill's founding father did not make a lasting impact on Erik's descendants nor remain in the practical lives of his followers. One of his descendants, Tanya Edgil, of Hamilton, Alabama, participates in the Swedish reality TV show Allt f√∂r Sverige in 2018.

Much contemporary art has become, in Frank Popper's terms, virtualized.Joseph Nechvatal, Frank Popper and Virtualised Art, Tema Celeste Magazine: Winter 2004 issue #101, pp. 48‚Äì53 Definition Virtual art can be considered a post-convergent art form based on the bringing together of art and technology, thus containing all previous media as subsets.http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1367975 Sharing this focus on art and technology are the books of Jack Burnham (Beyond Modern Sculpture 1968) and Gene Youngblood (Expanded Cinema 1970). Since virtual art can consist of virtual reality, augmented reality, or mixed reality, it can be seen in other aspects of production such as video games and movies. In his book From Technological to Virtual Art, Frank Popper traces the development of immersive, interactive new media art from its historical antecedents through today's digital art, computer art, cybernetic art, multimedia and net art. Popper shows that contemporary virtual art is a further refinement of the technological art of the late twentieth century and also a departure from it. What is new about this new media art, he argues, is its humanization of technology, its emphasis on interactivity, its philosophical investigation of the real and the virtual, and its multisensory nature.Margaret Boden, Mind As Machine, Oxford University Press, 2006, p. 1089 He argues further that what distinguishes the artists who practice virtual art from traditional artists is their combined commitment to aesthetics and technology. Their \\"extra-artistic\\" goals ‚Äì linked to their aesthetic intentions ‚Äì concern not only science and society but also basic human needs and drives.Origins of Virtualism: An Interview with Frank Popper conducted by Joseph Nechvatal, CAA Art Journal, Spring 2004, pp. 62-77 To explain and illustrate the emergence of a techno- aesthetic, Popper stresses the panoramic and multi-generational reach of virtual art. As regards to virtual art, openness is stressed both from the point of view of the artists and their creativity and from that of the follow- up users in their reciprocating thoughts and actions. This commitment to the teeming openness found in virtual art can be traced to the theories of Umberto Eco and other aestheticians. In virtual worlds and entertainment Virtual art can be seen in worlds like Second Life, and Inworldz virtual environments in which anything is possible to the user, who is represented by an avatar. In the virtual world, the avatar's abilities ranges from ordinary walking to flying. The environment and scenery of such environments is similar to the real world, except that it can be altered by the avatar. Worlds like Inworldz and Second Life feature an editor which allows the user to build his or her own experience just the way he or she wants it to be. The user is not bounded by physics or improbabilities that he or she faces in the real world. Virtual art is made with many computer programs and has no boundaries, so it uses animations, movies, computer games and so on. As it becomes more and more popular and important, it results in people being able to live another virtual life. With the advancements in technology virtual art has transformed and evolved quickly from simple 8-bit representations to 3D models containing millions of polygons.

From March 11, 1981 to March 1990, several organic constitutional laws were approved, leading to the final restoration of democracy. After the 1988 plebiscite, the 1980 Constitution (which is still in effect today) was amended to ease provisions for future amendments to the constitution, create more seats in the senate, diminish the role of the National Security Council, and equalize the number of civilian and military members (four members each). Christian Democrat Patricio Aylwin served from 1990 to 1994 and was succeeded by another Christian Democrat, Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle (son of Eduardo Frei Montalva), leading the same coalition for a six-year term. Ricardo Lagos Escobar of the Socialist Party and the Party for Democracy led the Concertacion to a narrower victory in the 2000 presidential election. His term ended on March 11, 2006, when Michelle Bachelet of the Socialist Party took office. Center-right investor and businessman Sebasti√°n Pi√±era, of the National Renewal, assumed the presidency on March 11, 2010, after Bachelet's term expired. Bachelet returned to the office on March 11, 2014, being succeeded by Pi√±era in the following term (2018‚Äì2022). 1988 plebiscite and reform of the Constitution Passed under tight military control in 1980, the Chilean constitution's legal dispositions were designed to lead to the convocation of all citizens to a plebiscite during which the Chilean people would ratify a candidate, proposed by the Chief of Staff of the Chilean Armed Forces and by the General Director of the Carabineros, the national police force, and who would become the President of Chile for an eight-year term. In 1980, this meant that the Chilean people were supposed to approve Augusto Pinochet's candidacy, assuring him popular legitimacy and the sanction of a vote. If the people refused the junta's chosen candidate, the military would relinquish political control to the civilians, leading to presidential and parliamentary democratic elections the following year, putting an end to the military government. In 1987, Pinochet's government passed a law allowing the creation of political parties and another law allowing the opening of national registers of voters. If the majority of the people voted \\"yes\\" to Pinochet's plebiscite, he would have remained in power for the next eight years. Instead, Congress was elected and installed on March 11, 1990. Context and causes of Pinochet's decision to follow the Constitution Various factors led to Pinochet's decision to resume this procedure, including the situation in the Soviet Union, where Mikhail Gorbachev had initiated the glasnost and the perestroika democratic reforms. Those reforms led to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and to the official end of the Cold War, which was an important factor. The Cold War had important consequences in South America, considered by the United States to be a full part of the Western Bloc, in contrast with the Eastern Bloc, a division born with the end of World War II and the Yalta Conference. Following the 1959 Cuban Revolution and the local implementation in several countries of Che Guevara's foco theory, the US waged a war in South America against the \\"Communists subversives,\\" leading to support in Chile of the right-wing, which would culminate with the coup of 1973 in Chile. In a few years, all of South America was covered by similar military dictatorships, called juntas. In Paraguay, Alfredo Stroessner was in power since 1954; in Brazil, left-wing President Jo√£o Goulart was overthrown by a military coup in 1964; in Bolivia, General Hugo Banzer overthrew leftist General Juan Jos√© Torres in 1971; in Uruguay, considered the \\"Switzerland\\" of South America, Juan Mar√≠a Bordaberry seized power in the June 27th 1973 coup. A \\"Dirty War\\" was waged all over the continent, culminating with Operation Condor, an agreement between security services of the Southern Cone and other South American countries to repress and assassinate political opponents. In 1976, militaries seized power in Argentina and supported the 1980 \\"Cocaine Coup\\" of Luis Garc√≠a Meza Tejada in Bolivia, before training the Contras in Nicaragua where the Sandinista National Liberation Front, headed by Daniel Ortega, had taken power in 1979. Similar military coups took place in Guatemala and in El Salvador. In the 1980s, however, the situation progressively evolved in the world as in South America, despite a renewal of the Cold War from 1979 to 1985, the year during which Gorbatchev replaced Konstantin Chernenko as leader of the USSR. It is believed that the visit of Pope John Paul II in April 1987 may have influenced Pinochet's decision to call for elections. The Pope is shown here at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile on 4 April 1987. Another alleged reason of Pinochet's decision to call for elections was Pope John Paul II's April 1987 visit to Chile: he visited Santiago, Vi√±a del Mar, Valpara√≠so, Temuco, Punta Arenas, Puerto Montt and Antofagasta. Before his pilgrimage to Latin America, the pontiff criticized Pinochet's regime as \\"dictatorial\\" while speaking with reporters. According to The New York Times, he was \\"using unusually strong language\\" to criticize Pinochet and told the journalists that the Church in Chile must not only pray, but actively fight for the restoration of democracy in Chile.Pope, on Latin Trip, Attacks Pinochet Regime The New York Times, 1 April 1987 During his 1987 Chilean visit, the Polish pope asked Chile's 31 Catholic bishops to campaign for free elections in the country.Pope Tells Chile's Bishops To Press for Free Elections; Pontiff Joins Pinochet on Palace Balcony The Washington Post, 3 April 1987 According to George Weigel, he held a meeting with Pinochet during which they discussed the topic of the return to democracy. John Paul II allegedly pushed Pinochet to accept a democratic opening of the regime, and even called for his resignation.Heraldo Mu√±oz, The Dictator's Shadow: Life under Augusto Pinochet, p. 183, Basic Books (2008), In 2007, Cardinal Stanis≈Çaw Dziwisz, acting as Pope John Paul II's secretary, confirmed that the Pope asked Pinochet to step down and transfer power over to civilian authorities during his visit.George Weigel, Biograf√≠a de Juan Pablo II ‚Äì Testigo de Esperanza, Editorial Plaza & Jan√©s (2003), John Paul II also supported the Vicariate of Solidarity during his visit, which was a Church-led pro-democracy, anti-Pinochet organization. John Paul II visited the Vicariate of Solidarity's offices, spoke with its workers, and \\"called upon them to continue their work, emphasizing that the Gospel consistently urges respect for human rights.\\"Timmerman, Jacobo Chile: Death in the South, p. 114, Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., 1987 Some have erroneously accused John Paul II of affirming Pinochet's regime by appearing with the Chilean ruler in his balcony. However, Cardinal Roberto Tucci, organizer of John Paul II's pilgrimages, revealed that Pinochet tricked the pontiff by telling him he would take him to his living room, while in reality he took him to his balcony. Tucci claims that the pontiff was \\"furious.\\"Dlaczego Jan Pawe≈Ç II wyszed≈Ç z Pinochetem na balkon Gazeta Wyborcza, 24 December 2009 Whatever the case, political advertisement was legalized on 5 September 1987, and became a key element of the campaign for the \\"NO\\" to the referendum, which countered the official campaign which presaged a return to a Popular Unity government in case of Pinochet's defeat. Finally, the \\"NO\\" to Pinochet won with 55.99% of the votes, against 44.01% of the votes. As a result, presidential and legislative elections were called for the following year. Furthermore, in July 1989, a constitutional referendum took place after long negotiations between the government and the opposition. If approved, 54 constitutional reforms were to be implemented, among which the reform of the way that the Constitution itself could be reformed, the restriction of state of emergency dispositions, the affirmation of political pluralism, the strengthening of constitutional rights as well as of the democratic principle and participation to the political life. All parties in the political spectrum supported the reforms, with the exception of the small right-wing Avanzada Nacional and other minor parties. Reforms were passed with 91.25% of the vote. Aylwin administration The Concertaci√≥n coalition, which supported the return to democracy, gathered the Christian Democrat Party (PDC), the Socialist Party (PS), the Party for Democracy (PPD) and the Social Democrat Radical Party (PRSD). Christian Democrat Patricio Aylwin won a sweeping victory in the December 1989 elections, the first democratic elections since the 1970 election won by Salvador Allende. Patricio Aylwin had gathered 3,850,023 votes (55.17%), while the center-right supermarket tycoon Francisco Javier Err√°zuriz Talavera from the UCCP party managed to take 15.05% of the vote, whose main effect was lowering right-wing candidate Hern√°n B√ºchi's votes to 29.40% (approximately 2 million votes). In December 1989, Patricio Aylwin, head of the Concertaci√≥n coalition, won the first democratic election in Chile since 1970. The Concertaci√≥n coalition dominated Chilean politics for much of the next two decades. In February 1991, it established the National Commission for Truth and Reconciliation, releasing the Rettig Report on human rights violations during Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship. This report, contested by human rights NGOs and associations of political prisoners, counted only 2,279 cases of \\"disappearances\\" which could be proved and registered. Of course, the very nature of \\"disappearances\\" made such investigations very difficult, while many victims were still intimidated by the authorities, and did not dare go to the local police center to register themselves on lists, since the police officers were the same as during the dictatorship. Several years later, the same problem arose with the 2004 Valech Report, which counted almost 30,000 victims of torture, among testimony from 35,000 people. However, the Rettig Report did list important detention and torture centers, such as the Esmeralda ship, the V√≠ctor Jara Stadium, Villa Grimaldi, etc. Registration of victims of the dictatorship, and the following trials in the 2000s of military personnel guilty of human rights violations, dominated the struggle for the recognition of crimes committed during the dictatorship by human rights NGOs and associations of political prisoners, many of whom resided in exile. Besides implementing the Rettig Commission, Aylwin's government established a Comisi√≥n Especial de Pueblos ind√≠genas (Special Commission of Indigenous People), whose report provided the intellectual framework of the \\"Indigenous Law\\" (ley ind√≠gena) or law n¬∞ 19 253. The law went into effect on September 28th 1993LEY N¬∫ 19.253 ‚Äì LEY IND√çGENA and recognized the Mapuche people as an inherent part of the Chilean nation. Other indigenous people officially recognized included Aymaras, Atacame√±as, Collas, Quechuas, Rapa-Nui, Y√°manas and Kawashkars. Despite this state proclamation of indigenous rights, conflicts brought by land-occupations and Mapuche's claims led to state repression and the use of the anti-terrorist law against Mapuche activists, a law instated by the military junta. Frei Ruiz-Tagle administration Preparing for the 1993 election, the Concertaci√≥n held primaries in May 1993, which pitted left-wing Ricardo Lagos (PPD) against Christian-Democrat Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, (PDC), the son of former President Eduardo Frei Montalva (1911‚Äì1982, President from 1964 to 1970). Eduardo Frei won these primaries by a large majority of 63%. The right-wing, grouped as the Alliance for Chile, also held primaries between 2 candidates: Sebasti√°n Pi√±era of the National Renewal (RN) the largest right- wing party at the time and who had supported the \\"NO\\" during the 1988 plebiscite on the return to civilian rule, and Arturo Alessandri Besa, former member of the National Party (PN), who was opposed to Eduardo Frei in the 1970 presidential election and was a representative of the Independent Democrat Union (UDI). Alessandri won those primaries, and thus represented the Alliance for Chile against the Concertaci√≥n. Others candidates included Jos√© Pi√±era, who was the former Minister in the early 1980s that had implemented the law granting property of copper to the Chilean Armed Forces and presented himself as an independent (6%); ecologist Manfred Max-Neef (5.55%), representative of the Left-Wing Democratic Alternative, which gathered the Communist Party (PCC), MAPU (part of the Popular Unity coalition of Allende) and the Christian Left Party; Eugenio Pizarro Poblete (less than 5%); and finally Cristi√°n Reitze Campos of the left-wing Humanist Party (1.1%). On 28 May 1993, the Boinazo took place, during which paratroopers surrounded the Chilean Army headquarters located close by to the Palacio de la Moneda.Chile: Illicit Croatia Arms Sale Case in Final Stage, The Santiago Times, 4 September 2007 The motive for the military uprising was the opening of investigations concerning the \\"Pinocheques\\", or checks received by Pinochet for a total amount of $3 million in the frame of kickbacks from an arms deal.El verdadero objetivo del \\"boinazo\\" de Pinochet , Diario Siete, 25 September 2005 A few days before (and unnoticed at the time), Jorge Schaulsohn, President of the Chamber of Deputies, had also denounced irregularities during arms trade committed by the Chilean Army through the intermediary of the FAMAE (Factories and Arsenals of the Army of Chile) ‚Äî which was later connected to the Gerardo Huber case, a Chilean Army Colonel and agent of DINA who was assassinated the previous year. Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle finally won the election in the first round in December 1993 with an absolute majority of almost 58% (more than 4 million votes) against Arturo Allesandri who gathered 24.4% (around 1,700 000 votes). Eduardo Frei took office in March 1994 for a 6-year term until 2000. During his term, it was not possible to judge any military for his role during the dictatorship, while large sectors of the Chilean society remained Pinochetista. Arrest and trial of Pinochet and Lagos administration Pinochet's funeral. Following an agreement between Pinochet and Andr√©s Zald√≠var, president of the Senate, Zaldav√≠r voted to abolish September 11th as a National Holiday which celebrated the 1973 coup. Supporters of Pinochet had blocked any such attempts until then.Chile abolishes coup holiday, BBC News, 20 August 1998 The same year, Pinochet traveled to London for back surgery. Once there, he was arrested on the orders of Spanish judge Baltasar Garz√≥n, provoking worldwide attention, not only because of the history of Chile and South America, but also because this was one of the first arrests of a dictator based on the universal jurisdiction principle. Pinochet tried to defend himself by referring to the State Immunity Act of 1978, an argument rejected by British judicial system. However, UK Home Secretary Jack Straw releases him on medical grounds, and refused to extradite him to Spain. Pinochet returned to Chile in March 2000. Upon descending the plane in his wheelchair, he quickly stood up and saluted the cheering crowd of supporters, including an army band playing his favorite military march tunes, which was awaiting him at the airport in Santiago. President Ricardo Lagos, who had just been sworn in on March 11, said the retired general's televised arrival had damaged Chile's image, while thousands demonstrated against him.Thousands march against Pinochet, BBC, 4 March 2000 Representing the Concertaci√≥n coalition for democracy, Ricardo Lagos had narrowly won the election just a few months before by a very tight margin of less than 200,000 votes (51.32%) against Joaqu√≠n Lav√≠n who represented the right-wing Alliance for Chile (around 49%). None of the six candidates had obtained an absolute majority on the first round held on December 12, 1999. Lagos was sworn-in for a 6-year term on March 11, 2000. In June 2000, the Congress passed a new law which granted anonymity to members of the armed forces who provide information on the desaparecidos.Soldier confirms Chile stadium killings, BBC, 27 June 2000 Meanwhile, the trials concerning human rights violations during the dictatorship continued. Pinochet was stripped of his parliamentary immunity in August 2000 by the Supreme Court and was indicted by judge Juan Guzm√°n Tapia. In 1999, Tapia had ordered the arrest of five military men, including General Pedro Espinoza Bravo of the DINA, for their role in the Caravan of Death following September 11th coup. Arguing that the bodies of the \\"disappeared\\" were still missing, he made jurisprudence which lifted any prescription on the crimes committed by the military. Pinochet's trial continued until his death on December 10, 2006, with alternating indictments for specific cases, lifting of immunities by the Supreme Court or to the contrary immunity from prosecution, with his health as main argument for, or against, his prosecution. In March 2005, the Supreme Court affirmed Pinochet's immunity concerning the 1974 assassination of General Carlos Prats in Buenos Aires, which had taken place as part of Operation Condor. However, he was deemed fit to stand trial for Operation Colombo, during which 119 political opponents were \\"disappeared\\" in Argentina. The Chilean justice also lifted his immunity on the Villa Grimaldi case, a detention and torture center in the outskirts of Santiago. Pinochet, who still benefited from a reputation of righteousness from his supporters, lost legitimacy when he was put under house arrest on tax fraud and passport forgery following the publication of a report concerning the Riggs Bank in July 2004 by the US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. The report was a consequence of investigations on financial fundings of the September 11th 2001 attacks in the US. The bank controlled between US$4 million and $8 million of Pinochet's assets, as he lived in Santiago in a modest house, hiding his wealth. According to the report, Riggs Bank participated in money laundering for Pinochet, setting up offshore shell corporations (referring to Pinochet as only \\"a former public official\\") and hiding his accounts from regulatory agencies. Related to Pinochet's and his family secret bank accounts in United States and in Cara√Øbs islands, this tax fraud filing for an amount of $27 million shocked the conservative sectors who still supported him. Ninety percent of these funds were raised between 1990 and 1998, when Pinochet was chief of the Chilean armies, and essentially would have come from weapons trafficking when purchasing Belgian \\"Mirage\\" air- fighters in 1994, Dutch \\"L√©opard\\" tanks, Swiss \\"Mowag\\" tanks, or by illegal sales of weapons to Croatia in the middle of the Balkans war. His wife Luc√≠a Hiriart and his son Marco Antonio Pinochet were also sued for complicity. For the fourth time in seven years, Pinochet was indicted by the Chilean justice.U.S. sends back Pinochet daughter, CNN, 28 January 2006 The Chilean authorities took control in August 2005 of the Colonia Dignidad concentration camp, directed by ex-Nazi Paul Sch√§fer. 2005 reform of the 1980 Constitution Over 50 reforms to Pinochet's Constitution were approved in 2005, which eliminated some of the remaining undemocratic areas of the text, such as the existence of non-elected Senators (institutional senators, or senators for life) and the inability of the President to remove the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. These reforms led the President to controversially declare Chile's transition to democracy as complete. However, its anti-terrorist measures remained, which have been used against the indigenous Mapuches. Furthermore, the military still receives money from the copper industry. Bachelet administration In 2006, the Concertaci√≥n again won the presidential election: Michelle Bachelet, Chile's first woman president, beat Sebasti√°n Pi√±era (Alliance for Chile), and obtained more than 53% of the vote. Bachelet's first political crisis occurred with massive protests by students who were demanding free bus fare and waiving of the university admissions test (PSU) fee, among longer-term demands such as the abolition of the Organic Constitutional Law on Teaching (LOCE), an end to municipalization of subsidized education, a reform to the Full-time School Day policy (JEC) and a quality education for all. The protests peaked on May 30, 2006, when 790,000 students adhered to strikes and marches throughout the country, becoming Chile's largest student demonstration of the past three decades. Spanish pdf. Italian pdf. The 2006‚Äì2007 Chilean corruption scandals were a series of events in which the Chilean governing Concertaci√≥n was under investigations of corruption. In June 2007, General Ra√∫l Iturriaga, the former deputy director of the DINA, was sentenced to five years' imprisonment for the abduction of Luis Dagoberto San Martin in 1974. Iturriaga had been in hiding from the authorities for a number of years but was arrested in August 2007. The CUT trade-union federation called for demonstrations in August 2007. These went on during the night, and at least 670 people were arrested, including journalists and a mayor, and 33 carabineros were injured. The protests were aimed against the Bachelet government's free market policies. Socialist Senator Alejandro Navarro was injured by the police during the demonstrations, although it later emerged that he had hit and kicked police and is currently under investigation by the Senate Ethics Committee. Senators from the opposition have requested that Navarro and other congressmen who participated in the protest be removed from Congress for violating the constitutional article which bans congressmen from participating in demonstrations which \\"violate the peace\\". In August 2007, a BBC correspondent wrote that about three million workers, roughly half the workforce, earned the minimum wage of $260 (¬£130) a month. At the same time, Arturo Mart√≠nez, general secretary of the CUT, requested explanations from the government and accused it of having stirred up the tension. Politicians from the center-right Alianza and from the governing center-left Concertaci√≥n have in turn criticized the CUT for the violence of the protest. Pi√±era administrationSecond Bachelet administrationSecond Pi√±era administration Massive civilian protests started on October 18, 2019, when Chilean people demanded a new constitution, the ability to end the transition period, and start a real democracy.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/15/chile-referendum-new- constitution-protests The protests have hopes of reducing and eliminating social and economic inequality, improving health, education and other public systems, and ending the current pension system (AFP), amongst other important issues.

In 1132, he founded Tami√© Abbey as a daughter house of Bonnevaux Abbey. Peter tried to refuse an elevation to the episcopate though his superiors and Bernard of Clairvaux insisted that he accept the position. As archbishop, he had special care for the poor, the ill, and those who traveled the Alpine passes. Peter died in 1174 as he attempted to mediate between feuding monarchs after a serious but brief illness. Miracles were reported at his tomb after his death and this led Pope Celestine III to canonize Peter as a saint in mid-1191. Life Peter was born in 1102 on a farm near Saint-Maurice-l'Exil, not far from the Cistercian Bonnevaux Abbey. His father often offered hospitality to the monks when they had to leave the monastery on business.Merton, Thomas. \\"Saint Peter of Tarentaise, First Abbot of Tamie\\", In the Valley of Wormwood: Cistercian Blessed and Saints of the Golden Age, Liturgical Press, 2013 In 1122, he joined the Cistercians at Bonnevaux and was soon followed by his father and his brothers Lambert and Andrew. His mother and sister joined the Cistercian nuns at Saint Paul d'Izeaux. The Archbishop of Tarentaise, (also named Peter, and the first Cistercian raised to the episcopate), and Amadeus III, Count of Savoy wished to establish a shelter for pilgrims and travelers along the old Roman road from Vienne to Milan. In 1132, Peter, his abbot, and twelve other monks founded Tami√© Abbey in a defile of the Bauges mountains, as a daughter house of Bonnevaux. Once Abbot John was satisfied that the monks had adequate shelter, he returned to Bonnevaux, leaving Peter as abbot of the new monastery. Peter enjoyed humbly serving and conversing with the strangers who sought the hospitality of the monks.\\"St. Peter of Tarentaise, Bishop\\", Catholic Exchange In 1142, at the insistence of his superiors including Bernard of Clairvaux, Peter reluctantly accepted the position as the Archbishop of Tarentaise. In his episcopal role he applied the Cistercian principles he had learned as an abbot to restore the diocese and met with a good deal of success since the diocese's management had declined and discipline lax. He removed corrupt priests (and elevated good priests to important pastoral positions) and promoted education for all the faithful. On two occasions of severe inclement weather he gave away his cloak to someone in need. He visited all parts of his mountainous diocese on a regular basis.\\"Saint Peter of Tarentaise\\", Franciscan Media His specific concerns included the welfare of travelers to and from Switzerland and from the Italian cities. He rebuilt a hospice in poor repair at Little St. Bernard Pass. He also founded a charity which distributed food to farms in the surrounding hills. This would become known as pain de Mai and became a tradition continued in the region until the French Revolution. Yet he longed for the simple and pious life of a monk. In 1155 he disappeared and was later found as a lay brother in a remote convent in Switzerland. After about a year, when the monks discovered who he was, they alerted the archdiocese. Peter was reluctant to emerge from his newfound solitude but was welcomed back into his archdiocese with much enthusiasm on the part of the people. He also frequently visited the Grand Chartreuse, during the tenure of Hugh of Lincoln. On one occasion Pope Eugene III in 1153 asked him to mediate a feud between the lords at La Chambre and the Bishop of Maurienne. Pope Adrian IV also asked him to resolve a dispute between some monks. It was he who upheld Pope Alexander III against Emperor Frederick Barbarossa and the Antipope Victor IV, and maintained in obedience to Alexander III the seven hundred abbeys of the Cistercian Order. He travelled to Lorraine and Alsace to ask the faithful to remain steadfast in their loyalty to Alexander III. Because of these efforts he was later appointed to assist in negotiations between King Louis VII and King Henry II. He died while doing so at Bellevaux on 14 September 1174 after a brief illness.

The stone, which has been quarried in and around the city, has given Aberdeen the epithet The Granite City, or more romantically, and less commonly used, the Silver City, after the mica in the stone which sparkles in the sun. The hard grey stone is one of the most durable materials available and helps to explain why the city's buildings look brand-new when they have been newly cleaned and the cement has been pointed. Unlike other Scottish cities where less durable stone, such as sandstone, has been used, the buildings do not weather, and need very little maintenance. Union Street Union Street runs for , is wide and originally contained the principal shops and most of the public buildings, all granite. Part of the street crosses the Denburn ravine (utilised for the line of the Great North of Scotland Railway) by Union Bridge, a fine granite arch of span, with portions of the older town still fringing the gorge, below the level of Union Street. The latter was built between 1801 and 1805, and named after the Acts of Union 1800 with Ireland. Amongst the notable buildings in the street are the Town and County Bank, the Music Hall, the Trinity Hall of the incorporated trades (originating between 1398 and 1527), now a shopping mall; the Palace Hotel; the former office of the Northern Assurance Company, and the National Bank of Scotland. In Castle Street, a continuation eastwards of Union Street, is the new Town House, the headquarters of the city council. Designed by Peddie and Kinnear and built between 1868 and 1874, it is one of the most splendid granite edifices in Scotland, in Flemish-Gothic style in recognition of close trade links between Aberdeen and Flanders, it contains the great hall, with an open timber ceiling and oak-panelled walls; the Sheriff Court House; the Town and County Hall, with portraits of Prince Albert, the 4th Earl of Aberdeen, various Lord Provosts and other distinguished citizens. In the vestibule of the entrance corridor stands a suit of black armour, believed to have been worn by Provost Sir Robert Davidson, who fought in the Battle of Harlaw in 1411. On the south-western corner is the 210 ft (64 m) West Tower, with its prominent bartizans, which commands a fine view of the city and surrounding country. The West Tower of the new Town House On the corner of Castle Street and King Street stands the old North of Scotland Bank by Aberdeen born architect, Archibald Simpson. This building, with its imposing corner entrance of four giant order composite columns, and statue of Ceres above, is now a pub named after its original architect. On the opposite side of the street is the fine building of the Union Bank, redeveloped in 2005 as the High Court, the third permanent high court to sit in Scotland. Castlegate At the upper end of Castlegate stands The Salvation Army Citadel, an effective castellated mansion, on the site of the medieval Aberdeen Castle. In front of it is the Mercat Cross, built in 1686 by John Montgomery, a native architect. This open- arched structure, 21 ft (6 m) in diameter and 18 ft (5 m) high, comprises a large hexagonal base from the centre of which rises a shaft with a Corinthian capital, on which is the royal unicorn. The base is highly decorated, including medallions illustrating Scottish monarchs from James I to James VII. To the east of Castle Street were the military barracks, which were demolished in 1965 and replaced with two tower blocks. Castlegate is also home to some of the oldest surviving streets in Aberdeen. Some of these are from the 13th and 14th centuries. Two houses, Provost Skene's House (1545) which is now a museum, and Provost Ross's House (1593) are in the Castlegate as well. Rosemount Viaduct This imposing terrace of late Victorian granite buildings is a prominent landmark in the city. Constructed in 1892, to a design by open competition winner Alexander Brown, the Central Library, which was opened by its benefactor Andrew Carnegie, stands at the west end of the terrace. Brown was also responsible for the extension to create the Central Reading Room in 1905. St Mark's Church by architect Alexander Marshall Mackenzie in the middle of the terrace has a giant order quatrostyle Corinthian portico, and dome modelled on St Paul's in London. His Majesty's Theatre by Frank Matcham, 1906, stands at the east end. Marischal College Marischal College and Greyfriars Kirk on Broad Street, opened by King Edward VII in 1906, is the second largest granite building in the world (after the Escorial, Madrid), and is one of the most splendid examples of Edwardian architecture in Britain. The architect, Alexander Marshall Mackenzie, a native of Elgin, adapted his material, white granite, to the design of the building with the originality of genius. This magnificent building is no longer a seat of learning. Following a comprehensive restoration project, it re-opened in 2011 as the new corporate headquarters of Aberdeen City Council. Religious Buildings=Kirk of St Nicholas Kirk of St Nicholas, one of Scotland's largest parish churches and is subdivided into East and West churches. The large kirkyard of the Kirk of St Nicholas is separated from Union Street by a 147 ft (45 m) long Ionic fa√ßade. The divided church within, with a central tower and spire, forms one continuous building 220 ft (67 m) in length. The West Church was built in 1755, by James Gibbs, and the East Church was built in 1837 by Archibald Simpson. St Machar's Cathedral St Machar's Cathedral begun in the 12th century, a few hundred yards from the river Don took centuries to build with the exception of the period of the episcopate of William Elphinstone (1484‚Äì1511). Gavin Dunbar, who followed him in 1518, completed the structure by adding the two western spires and the southern transept. With high vaulted ceilings and a large church yard, you can see the remains of old parts of the church which are now ruin. Large columns supporting the ceiling arches tower from floor to ceiling on the north and south sides of the main section of the church. Other Significant Buildings in Aberdeen The Masonic Temple in Crown Street, with its distinctive open pediment, designed by Harbourne Maclennan, Jenkins and Marr, and constructed in 1910, is an example of Edwardian Baroque architecture. Open pediment, Masonic Temple, Crown Street, 1910. Bridges=Bridge of Dee  The Bridge of Dee was until 1832, the only access to the city from the south across the river Dee. It consists of seven semicircular ribbed arches, is about 30 ft (10 m) high, and was built in 1527 by Bishops Elphinstone and Dunbar. It was nearly all rebuilt 1718-23, and in 1842 was widened from 14 to 26 ft (4 to 8 m). This was the site of a battle in 1639 between the Royalists under Viscount Aboyne and the Covenanters who were led by the Marquis of Montrose. St. Devenick's Bridge St. Devenick's Bridge (locally known as the Shakkin' Briggie, or as Morison's Bridge), is a suspension bridge crossing the River Dee from Ardoe to Cults, designed by John Smith (architect), and built in 1837. It is now derelict. The bridge is a Category A listed structure and there are plans to restore it. Wellington Bridge Wellington Suspension Bridge is a very narrow river Dee crossing. It was designed by Captain Samuel Brown and opened in 1831 to replace the Craiglug ferry. Refurbished in 1930, the Category A listed building was closed to vehicular traffic in 1984 and to pedestrians in March 2002. Aberdeen City Council engineers strengthened and preserved the bridge and it reopened as a public footbridge in the late 2000s. Bridge of Don The Bridge of Don crosses river Don and has five granite arches, each 75 ft (23 m) in span, and was built 1827-1832. Brig o' Balgownie The Brig o' Balgownie is a picturesque single arch spanning the deep black stream, said to have been built by King Robert I, in 1320, and celebrated by George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron in the tenth canto of \\"Don Juan\\". Statues=William Wallace William Wallace's colossal bronze statue of 1888, by William Grant Stevenson RSA, looking south over Union Terrace Gardens and opposite His Majesty's Theatre. Robert Burns Robert Burns's bronze statue, 1892, by Henry Bain Smith, on Union Terrace. On Union Terrace, Robert Burns, 1892, bronze by Henry Bain Smith Albert, Price Consort Prince Albert seated, bronze statue opposite the Central Library. This statue is by Carlo Marochetti, famous for the equestrian figure of Richard the Lionheart outside the Palace of Westminster in London. Sir James McGrigor Sir James McGrigor (1778‚Äì1851) is celebrated with a 70 ft (21 m) high obelisk of Peterhead granite, originally erected in the square of Marischal College, in memory of the military surgeon and director-general of the Army Medical Department, who was thrice elected Rector of the College. In the 1890s when the College was extended, the obelisk was moved to Duthie Park. General Charles Gordon A bronze statue of Major-General Charles George Gordon, by T. Stuart Burnett, stands outside Robert Gordon's College and University in Schoolhill. General Charles Gordon is unrelated to the college's Robert Gordon.Scran, \\"The statue in the foreground is that of General Charles Gordon who was killed at Khartoum. The statue was sculpted by T.

The name refers particularly to the urbanised lower valley, spanned by three impressive bridges, which is nowadays a cultural and social oasis close to the centre of Newcastle.  Industrial history  The lower Ouseburn was the cradle of the industrial revolution in Newcastle.https://www.newcastlegateshead.com/things-to-do/ouseburn-p562601 There was a cluster of heavy crafts and industries in the area. Coal was brought from the Town Moor along the Victoria Tunnel, where the tidal nature of the Ouseburn allowed wherries ‚Äì the local barges ‚Äì to be loaded at low tide and pulled out to the collier brigs and snows waiting in the Tyne.  Cultural development The lower Ouseburn Valley had fallen into disuse and dereliction by the mid-twentieth century,https://www.newcastlegateshead.com/things-to- do/ouseburn-p562601 but its industrial heritage had left many large buildings which, since the 1970s, have increasingly been utilised as creative workspaces by artists, musicians and performers. From 1996, a development trust (the Ouseburn Trust), in partnership with the local authority, has led the area's regeneration as a cultural hotspot. This has been so successful that Ouseburn is now marketed as a trendy place to live. The area is now a hub for the arts and creative industries, and is home to the Biscuit Factory (open gallery), the Mushroom Works (open first weekend of the month), Testhouse 5 (appointment only), North Grange Glass (stained glass gallery and cafe), 36 Lime Street and Cobalt Studios. The Valley is also the home of Seven Stories, the national centre for children's books.https://www.newcastlegateshead.com/things-to- do/ouseburn-p562601 The Byker Bridge, from the valley floor, with the Byker Viaduct and the Ouseburn Viaduct behind it.

The Ouseburn Trust remains a landlord and developer in the Valley, and seeks to involve people in the heritage and regeneration of the area through its programme of free walks, talks and volunteering activities.  Other features  The Valley is home to a number of pubs known locally for live music and real ale: Free Trade (at the confluence with the Tyne, with a good view of the bridges upriver), The Tyne Bar, the Cumberland Arms, The Ship Inn, The Tanners, The Kiln, Cobalt Studios and The Cluny.https://www.newcastlegateshead.com/things-to-do/ouseburn-p562601 Bridges Three high-level bridges cross the valley in close proximity; these are the Ouseburn railway Viaduct, the Byker Viaduct carrying the Tyne and Wear Metro, and then the Byker road bridge.https://www.culture24.org.uk/places-to-go/north-east/tra23497 Hadrian's Wall crossed the Ouseburn just to the south of the Byker road bridge, and is thought to have run through the site of the City Farm.

Penny gaff frequenters, by Gustave Dor√©. A penny gaff was a form of popular entertainment for the lower classes in 19th-century England. It consisted of short, theatrical entertainments which could be staged wherever space permitted, such as the back room of a public house or small hall. Unsophisticated, the props and scenery rarely consisted of more than a stage and a piano. The lessee of the venue would often stand by the stage, calling out when each act should finish in an attempt to maximise the evening's revenue. Clowning, dancing, singing and plays were all featured in the penny gaffs. Easy to perform, well-known to the audience, and with simple exciting stories, the deeds of famous highwaymen, robbers and murderers, such as those featured in The Newgate Calendar were popular subjects for the plays. The stories of the 18th-century robber Jack Sheppard, who escaped from prison on numerous occasions, and the gory Red Barn Murder were among the most enduring. Mangled versions of William Shakespeare's plays were also regularly performed. The time constraints meant the stories would often become unrecognisable, with the final act performed in a flurry of activity. If the owner called time, the play would have to be concluded regardless of what point in the script the actors had reached.Mancroff and Trela, pp. 99‚Äì100 Joseph Merrick, the so-called Elephant Man, was exhibited at penny gaffs. As the gaffs became more popular, larger, more spacious venues opened to accommodate them. The Rotunda in Blackfriars Road, the largest venue in London, could seat 1,000 people and at its peak exhibited shows lasting between an hour and two and a half hours. For the more discerning patron, it offered better seating at the price of tuppence or threepence.Bratton, p. 73 The established penny gaff theatres were feared as breeding grounds for criminals by the Victorian moral reformers, as, in the words of one city missionary: \\"no respectable person goes, so they have it all their own way, and corrupt the minds of youth without rebuke\\".Shaftesbury, p. 319 The name penny gaff derived from the entrance fee, which was normally one penny, and from the name for a cock fighting pit. The shows were popular from about 1830 to around 1870, by which time the street culture that had spawned the impromptu performances had largely disappeared.Mancroff and Trela, p. xiii See also * Patent theatre NotesReferences See Chapter 16.

Its purpose was to supply ammunition and provisions to Allied soldiers engaged in the siege of Sevastopol who were stationed on a plateau between Balaklava and Sevastopol. It also carried the world's first hospital train. The railway was built at cost and without any contract by a partnership of English railway contractors led by Samuel Morton Peto. Within three weeks of the arrival of the fleet carrying materials and men the railway had started to run and in seven weeks of track had been completed. The railway was a major factor leading to the success of the siege. After the end of the war the track was sold and removed. The start of the siege Shown as \\"Chemin de Fer Anglais\\" on a contemporary French army map Britain and France declared war on Russia on 28 March 1854 in support of the Ottoman Empire. By the late summer of 1854 the British, led by Lord Raglan, with their French and Turkish allies decided that a siege of the Black Sea port of Sevastopol, held by the Russians, would be the best method of forcing an end to the war. After landing their forces to the north of Sevastopol, the British set up a base in the narrow harbour of Balaclava, about south of Sevastopol, in September 1854. Most of the land between Balaclava and Sevastopol was a plateau about above sea level. The towns were connected by a road which was little more than a track. This travelled northwards, rising slightly to the village of Kadikoi about from Balaclava. It then turned west, climbing steeply to the plateau via the Col of Balaclava. The French were supplied from the harbour at Kamiesch. During the early part of October, the British troops with their supplies and artillery made their way with difficulty up the road to prepare for the siege. When they were all in place the First Bombardment took place, starting on October 17. It had been expected that the bombardment would be effective and that the siege would be short- lived; certainly over before the winter. However, the Russians blew up one of the French magazines and the damage done by British gunfire was soon repaired. The British were running out of ammunition and supplies, winter was approaching and with the onset of bad weather the road became virtually impassable. Supplies were arriving at the crowded port of Balaclava but it was impossible to convey them to the besieging troops who were increasingly suffering from disease, frostbite and malnutrition. Conditions in Balaclava itself were also deteriorating. Towards a railway Samuel Morton Peto News of these conditions was relayed to Britain, mainly by William Howard Russell, special correspondent of The Times. Hearing the news, Samuel Morton Peto, one of the leading railway contractors of the day, offered with his partners Edward Betts and Thomas Brassey, to build at cost, without any contract or personal advantage, a railway to transport supplies from the port of Balaclava to the troops outside Sevastopol. They promised to have a railroad at work in three weeks after landing at Balaclava. The offer was accepted and the contractors began to obtain supplies, to purchase or hire ships, and to recruit the men, who included specialists and navvies. The vessels engaged to carry the railway material and men consisted of seven steam and two sailing ships, of the aggregate tonnage of 5491 tons, and 900-horse power, as follows - \\"Lady Alice Lambton,\\" screw-steamer, 511 tons, 90-horse power; \\"Great Northern,\\" ditto, 578 tons, 90-horse ; \\"Earl of Durham,\\" ditto, 554 tons, 90-horse; Baron von Humboldt,\\" ditto, 420 tons, 60-horse; \\" Hesperus,\\" ditto. 800 tons, 150-horse; \\" Prince of Wales,\\" ditto, 627 tons, 120-horse ; \\"Levant,\\" paddle-steamer, 694 tons, 500-horse power; \\"Wildfire,\\" clipper sailing ship, 457 tons; Mohawk,\\" ditto, 850 tons. The material consisted of 1800 tons of rails and fastenings, 6000 sleepers, 600 loads timber, and about 3000 tons of other material and machinery, consisting of fixed engines, cranes, pile engines, trucks, wagons, barrows, blocks, chain- falls, wire- rope, picks, bars, capstans, crabs, and a variety of other plant and tools; besides sawing machines, forges, carpenters' and smiths' tools, &c.; This material was distributed over the different vessels in such a manner that should any one or two vessels be lost disabled, it will not endanger the efficiency of the whole. The ships convey, in parties of 50 or 80, 500 workmen; each party under a charge of a foreman and assistant; as well as a surgeon to each vessel. The fleet set sail on December 21 and arrived at the beginning of February. Meanwhile, James Beatty, who had played an important part in working with Peto's partnership to build the European and North American Railway, was recruited as chief engineer. The line was surveyed by Donald Campbell, who had also worked on the European and North American Railway. Campbell's first task was to create a wharf at Balaclava where the railway materials could be unloaded, with a yard adjacent. He planned for the track to pass along the middle of the main street of the town. It then went through a gorge at the north of the town close to the water's edge and over swampy ground to the village of Kadikoi. From here, the railway had to rise some to the top of the plateau. Of the routes available, Campbell chose to follow the existing road. Although at parts its gradient was as steep as 1 in 7, Campbell managed find a route with a maximum gradient of 1 in 14. A stationary engine would be required at the top of this stretch to pull the railway carriages up the incline. Once on the plateau, the ground was rough but fairly level and here it presented fewer problems. Lord Raglan's headquarters were at the top of the col, and it was decided that a depot should be constructed here. Construction Railway yard at Balaclava. Photograph by Roger Fenton By February 8, 1855, less than a week after landing, the navvies were laying the first rails in the main street of Balaclava. A trial assembly of the stationary engines (two had been acquired in case of the failure of one of them) was made and on February 10 they were working. By the 13th, the railway had reached a point from the town and on the 19th it was at Kadikoi. It began to function on the 23rd when horse-drawn supplies were taken from Balaclava to Kadikoi. This was 15 days after starting to lay the first rails and about three weeks after the arrival of the fleet in the port. The railway yard in Balaclava was being extended and accommodation was being built for the workers and for storage of materials. By March 26 the line was complete to the top of the col and the first load was taken to the headquarters depot. By this time, the line had been double tracked from Balaclava to Kadikol and various sidings had been constructed near the wharf. In less than seven weeks of track had been laid. During this time the pioneer photographer Roger Fenton had arrived and he recorded the railway and its progress. On April 2, the railway was used to carry the sick and injured from the plateau down to Balaclava. It has been argued that this was the first hospital train ever to run. Also during this time, Colonel William McMurdo had been appointed to be in charge of a new department of the army, the Land Transport Corps. He arrived in the Crimea in early March, and one of his duties was to take over the operation of the railway from the contractors. Felix Wakefield was given the temporary rank of lieutenant-colonel and he arrived to take command of the Army Works Corps employed on the project. It was finally handed over by Peto, Brassey and Betts in early July. The war continues The existence of the railway meant that sufficient supplies and armaments had been transported to the plateau for the allies to resume their attack. The Second Bombardment started on April 9 and continued for ten days. Initially, little progress seemed to have been made because again the Russians were able to repair the damage caused, and the Russians continued to deliver supplies to Sevastopol from the north. However, they had sustained heavy casualties. Following a period of stalemate, Allied forces cut off one of the main Russian supply lines at Kerch on May 24. The increased supply of ammunition meant that the Allies were able to mount the Third Bombardment on June 6. This was much more intensive than the previous ones. It was followed by an assault on the 7th and 8th, which met with a limited degree of success. More supplies were brought by the railway and the Fourth Bombardment took place on June 17. The subsequent attack was mismanaged and was a failure. The end of the siege The Russians suffered a significant defeat at the Battle of the Tchernaya on August 16. The Fifth Bombardment took place for five days from the 17th with the intention of destroying as many Russian defence works as possible. The Sixth Bombardment was followed by a successful Allied attack on September 8,. bringing the siege to an end two days later. During the summer, further surveys had been carried out with the intention of supplying not just the British forces, but also their French and Sardinian allies (Sardinia had joined the war towards the end of 1854) by rail from Balaclava. At this time electric telegraphy by underwater cable was first used in warfare, connecting the Crimea to the Allies' base at Varna in Bulgaria. Locomotives and more lines  Locomotives were used, the first one running by November 8, but this was too late to affect the outcome of the siege. The locomotives were not effective because they could not manage even the easy gradient from Balaclava to Kadikoi with more than a light load. Five second- hand locomotives, purchased by the contractors from collieries and railway companies in England, are known to have arrived. Alliance and Victory were two small 0-6-0 saddle tanks built by E. B. Wilson & Co of Leeds in 1854/5; two from the London & North Western Railway, Nos 13 and 50, were 2-2-0 Bury-type passenger engines built by Benjamin Hick & Son of Bolton in 1838 and 1840; the fifth locomotive was Swan from the St Helens Canal & Railway Co, but its details remain obscure. James Beatty left the Crimea in November to return to England, a sick man, and Donald Campbell took over. Earlier in September Her Majesty's Floating Factory Chasseur arrived at Balaclava to provide an engineering service under the direction of Robert Frazer. A third stationary engine also arrived. Due to the haste in which the railway had been constructed, it was in danger of being severely damaged by the weather of the coming winter. William Doyne organised the building of new lines of a superior quality, again in a short time. By November 10, of track had been laid between Balaclava and the British headquarters. The lines towards the Sardinian and French headquarters were also advancing. Towards the end of the war Towards and during the second winter, the supplies carried by the railway were different. The siege had ended, carriage of ammunition was less important, and the supplies related more to the accommodation and comfort of the troops. These included huts to replace tents, clothing, food, books and medical supplies. Colonel McMurdo also left the Crimea as a sick man on December 1, passing the control of the railway to Colonel Edward Wetherall. Following the completion of the Sardinian branch, the railway had reached its limit. In all, it measured about plus a few miles of sidings and loops. Sevastopol lay in ruins after the end of the siege. Tsar Nicholas I died on 2 March 1855, and peace negotiations were opened by the new Tsar, Alexander II.

The rails had already been uprooted and taken away, and the railway ceased to exist Argentina myth A now-discounted popular legend claims that two steam engines from the Crimean line went on to a new life on the newly started Buenos Ayres Western Railway in Argentina. According to the myth this is reason many railways in Argentina were built to , which the builders of the Grand Crimean Central Railway had supposedly chosen as it enabled them to requisition for use in Crimea available engines and rolling stock which had already been built for lines in India. Research in the 1950s showed that this story is untenable. Contemporary information shows that the Crimean railway was standard gauge, despite subsequent rumours that it was 5'3\\" Irish gauge or , while Argentina's neighbours Chile and Paraguay had already adopted 5'6\\" gauge. The works number of the two Argentine steam engines, N¬∞1 \\"La Porte√±a\\" (on display at the Provincial Transport Museum in Luj√°n,) and N¬∞2 \\"La Argentina\\", show that they left manufacturer E. B. Wilson and Company of Leeds in 1856, after the demolition of the Crimea railway had already begun. Their dimensions and characteristics would have been unsuitable for the steep gradients in Balaclava, and technical considerations would have prevented their conversion from standard to broad gauge. On the other hand contemporary reports claim that engines from the GCCR went to Argentina; see for instance Richard Francis Burton who mentions in his \\"Letters From the Battlefields of Paraguay\\" (1870) that the train he travelled in was pulled by an \\"asthmatic little engine‚Äîwhich, after serving its time upon the Balaklava line, and being condemned as useless at Buenos Aires, had been shipped off to Paraguay\\" References Notes Citations Sources * (Second edition (substantially revised and expanded) 1997. ) External links *General Order after the Fall of Sebastapol (article in The New York Times 1855) Crimean War Transport in Crimea Railway lines in Ukraine Military railways 1520 mm gauge railways in Ukraine Railway lines opened in 1855 Railway lines closed in 1856 ","title":"Grand Crimean Central Railway"},{"id":"9540160","text":"Filipinos in the United Kingdom are British citizens or immigrants who are of Filipino ancestry.

It was directed by K. Vijaya Bhaskar and produced by Ramoji Rao, with Viju Shah as music director. This film marked the debut of Riteish Deshmukh and Genelia D'Souza. This Film was nominated for several awards, including the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut category. It was a remake of the 1999 Malayalam blockbuster film Niram starring Kunchako Boban and Shalini, directed by Kamal.  Plot  Rishi (Riteish Deshmukh) and Anju (Genelia D'Souza) are childhood buddies. They were born on the same day, in the same hospital. Even their parents are best friends from their college years and are now neighbours. Rishi and Anju are inseparable, so much so that they study in the same college in the same class. Akash (Raja Bherwani), a very talented singer, develops feelings for Anju when she spontaneously sings with him at a college function. He, Anju and others leave for Bangalore for a week to participate in a few inter-college competitions. As they are apart for the first time in their lives, Rishi starts missing Anju very badly, but does not understand his feelings. His maid Sarro (Supriya Pilgaonkar), who often teases him and Anju, starts teasing him that he is missing her because he loves her. Slowly, with the maid's words, Rishi begins to realise that he loves her. He buys a gift and greeting card to express himself when she returns. Meanwhile, he sees a girl from his college slapping her friend because he said he loves her. She in a distressed mood and says that such guys are a shame to friendship as they pretend to be friends but really have other intentions. She wishes that every guy could be like Rishi so that a girl and guy could be best friends without any worries. Rishi then feels that he should not tell Anju about his feelings lest she, too, react the same way. He feels that he can bear not to tell her about his love but cannot imagine losing her friendship. Anju returns from Bangalore and tells Rishi that Akash proposed to her during their stay. She comes to his room to ask him what to reply and by mistake half opens the drawer in which he kept his greeting card and gift. He hurriedly closes it and asks her not to open it then tells her to agree to the proposal if she likes Akash. She agrees to his proposal. Later things start to get a rough as Akash doesn't like the closeness Rishi and Anju share. When Akash and Anju are having a conversation and Rishi joins them, Akash asks him to leave as they need some privacy. Such actions greatly distress Anju and she warns him not to do it again, but Rishi explains that what Akash is doing is justifiable. Akash's grandmother comes to Anju's house to arrange their marriage. Her parents agree and marriage preparations are well underway. It is decided that after marriage, Anju will leave with Akash to the USA where his family is settled. It is then that she realises this marriage means breaking her relationship with Rishi and leaving forever. She suddenly dislikes getting married and tries to talk to Rishi about it, but he casually says that it is all part of life and inevitable. She asks how can he talk so cold heartedly. She says she wishes she did not have to leave and wonders why she had to love Akash. She scolds him why he did not get the idea to love her in the first place. At this point Rishi, overcome by emotion, hugs Anju, cries and runs away from her. Anju grows suspicious of his actions and remembers the drawer that he did not let her open. She goes to his room and is shocked to find the card and gift. She says that she does not want to marry Akash and will tell everyone about them. Rishi firmly refuses saying that their parents have given them unlimited freedom: It would be very hurtful, selfish and irresponsible of them to break their trust. At his insistence she goes through the engagement ceremony. After the engagement, Rishi says that he has to go to a basketball match out of the state and will not be there for the marriage. The parents try to convince him, but he doesn't listen. Anju gives him a ride to the station and on the way they remember their childhood. At the station as Rishi is climbing aboard Anju weeps and holds him. He is unable to leave. At the house, the maid tells their parents everything and they come to the station. They find Anju and Rishi on the platform stairs and say that what they feel is not wrong, and it is the way of the world. They say that they shall cancel the marriage and ask them to come home.

While cable TV operators were warned against showing pirated versions of the movie, television promos and the many billboards in the city made sure that it did not go unnoticed. Most say that all these hoardings were not funded by the film's producer. If this wasn't enough, the chief minister used his powerful influence to get the who's who to attend the grand premiere.

The film depicts early nineteenth-century episodes in the life of a nobleman in Rome. Loosely based on folkloric accounts of the real Onofrio del Grillo (who lived in the eighteenth century), this character plays a number of pranks, one even involving Pope Pius VII. The famous line Io s√≤ io, e voi non siete un cazzo (literally \\"I am who I am, and you are fucking nobody\\"), is appropriated from Belli's 1831 sonnet, \\"The Sovrans of the Old World\\". Plot Rome, Year of our Lord 1809. The Pope Pius VII with his cardinals and ministers manages both temporal and spiritual power of the Papal States in Italy. The Marquis Onofrio del Grillo is one of his favorites, but even the worst of all the nobility. As a privileged and protected nobleman, Onofrio feels free to play his pranks on the poor people without any fear of the consequences. On one occasion, when he is arrested at a dinner with common criminals, he turns to the populace in a vulgar speech, claiming that his nobility allows him to do what he wants, and that they, being poor, are not worth anything. Memorable is the dispute between the poor Jew Aronne Piperno and the Marquis for the payment of a salary. Aaron is amazed when Onofrio refuses to pay with the argument that his creditor being a Jew is a murderer of Jesus. Aaron brings his case to court, but Onofrio wins the lawsuit by corrupting the judges and the cardinals. Piperno is condemned and mocked by the people, and Onofrio announces to the Pope that justice has just died in his States. In the meantime the Pope has the French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte excommunicated. When the conflict escalates, Onofrio is appointed commander of the Swiss Guards in Castel Sant'Angelo. He does not take the situation very seriously, and ultimately fails in his task to defend the Papal palace. While he is leaving command to check on the fidelity of a young plebeian lovers of his, the French guards penetrate the holy seal to arrest the Pope. Onofrio has personally few prejudices and quickly includes acquaintances from the new order within his circle, becoming friends with a young commander of the French regiment as well as more senior officers. This is however much to the disappointment of his pious mother who claims that the French, as enemies of the Pope King, are also sworn enemies of God. With the French occupants a theater company also arrives from Paris, introducing the novelty of real women for female roles. Due to the obtuseness of the Roman people the show proves a failure, but Onofrio takes the chance to start an affair with the beautiful and free spirited singer Olympia. One night, while walking around the ruins of the Forum to find a suitable spot for sleeping together, they notice a drunken coalman who is a perfect sosia of the Marquis. Onofrio decides to play one of his jokes by switching roles. He instructs his servant to have the inconscious man dressed up as himself, while he will play the part of Gasperino the coalman. The next morning the poor drunkard wakes up in Onofrio's bed to find himself transformed into a marquis. His bad manners lead the family to believe that he is possessed by the spirit of a dead coalman, and Onofrio's uncle tries to have him exorcised. After the first shock Gasperino starts to adapt to his new role and some of his family find him even better than the real Marquis. But when the Pope returns after Napoleon's defeat he has Onofrio condemned and Gasperino risks to end his life under the guillotine. Cast *Alberto Sordi ...

Named after Bollhuset, a historical theatre, it is located south of Slottsbacken just behind the Finnish Church, while two gates connects it to Tr√§dg√•rdsgatan.  History  In spite of its location in the Medieval part of the city, the history of Bollhust√§ppan is remarkably short, as the site was occupied by a building until the 1960s. It is named after the proximity to the two ball game buildings constructed in 1627-1792 and 1648‚Äì53, the bigger of the two used as a theatre from 1667, the smaller transformed into the Finnish Church in 1725 and still existent. On the lot itself were in medieval times the charitable institutions Fredagsalmosan and S√∂ndagsalmosan (\\"The Friday Alms\\" and \\"The Sunday Alms\\"). These institutions resided in a building donated to them in 1491 and located on the western fourth of the patch. East of this building was an estate owned by influential men such as councillors and chamberlains of the Helsing and von Snoilsky dynasties. An electrical plant was constructed on the lot in the 1880s, the steam-engine of which to start with supplied the Royal Palace exclusively, but by 1888 was enlarged in order to provide electricity to the entire old town. On the eastern half of the patch was a building during the Middle Ages at least three storeys tall, and during the 17th century named Hedersk√∂ldska huset after the proprietor and trader Anders Hedersk√∂ld. Parts of 15th century basement were still present following the demolition in the 1960s until its demolition in 1973. In autumn 2002 the space was restored, with new lightnings and benches added and some stairs removed for accessibility.  Boy looking at the Moon  J√§rnpojke, little boy looking at the moon, the smallest statue in Stockholm. Located on Bollhust√§ppan is, arguably, the smallest public sculpture in Sweden, named Pojke som tittar p√• m√•nen (\\"Boy Looking at the Moon\\") or J√§rnpojken (\\"Iron Boy\\") but colloquially called \\"Olle\\". It is sculpted by Liss Eriksson (1919-2000) in 1954 and was inaugurated in 1967. It retells the memory from the artist's childhood of when he during sleepless night used to sit on his bed to stare at the moon through his window. Made of sandstone and wrought iron, its stylized form contrasts the warmth of its expression; its informal and restrained manners making it one of the most appreciated pieces of art in the city, fondled by crowds of tourists every year, as the shiny head shows, and given coins and goodies, while Stockholmers occasionally knits neckerchiefs and caps for the boy to wear during winters. According to the artist, the smallness of the sculpture enlarges the empty space around it, and, as this empty space is part of the sculpture, it is actually a rather large piece of art. Martin Stugart, an expert on the history of Stockholm, writes the coins tourists give to the sculpture, in spite of the advice given by the guides, are collected by the Finnish Church which attempts to restrain the phenomenon. According to the low-key cult surrounding the boy, however, stealing these coins means bad luck as the child sees everything but forgets nothing.

Sirkin. Breaking the Poverty Cycle: The Human Basis for Sustainable Development. New York: Oxford University Press, 2010, Appendix A.  History =Establishment IMIFAP (Yo Quiero, Yo Puedo) was founded in 1985 by a group of social psychologists, led by Dr. Susan Pick. The first program that the organization developed sought to improve sexuality education for women by equipping them with life skills they needed to tear down the psychosocial barriers hindering them from proper accession to health care facilities, personnel, and tools such as contraceptives. In Dr. Pick's doctoral research, she had discovered that although many of the women in the communities located on the outskirts of Mexico City liked the idea of family planning, they lacked the possibility to use contraception for several reasons: they did not know how to use or access it, feared social scrutiny, or believed they did not have the right to make these decisions in regards to their health.Pick de Weiss, S. (1978) A social psychological study of family planning in Mexico City. Unpublished Thesis, University of London, London.Isaacs, S., Cairns, G., & Heckel, N. (1985) Population policy: A manual for policymakers and planners. New York: Columbia University.Wolfson, M. (1987). Changing approaches to population problems. Paris: OECD. There seemed to be an inherent belief amongst participants that things in life happened to them and that they had little to no control. Dr. Pick, in an initial phase of evaluation, interviewed many women who commonly used phrases such as ‚ÄúIf God wants it,‚Äù ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt work because my husband would not like that, it is better for me to wait,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt ask, it is better if I remain quiet.‚Äù.Pick, Susan and Jenna T. Sirkin. Breaking the Poverty Cycle: The Human Basis for Sustainable Development. New York: Oxford University Press, 2010, pg. 14. Thus, IMIFAP (Yo Quiero, Yo Puedo)‚Äôs first project to redesign the traditional sexuality education model incorporated FrEE, a methodology that promotes the break down of psychosocial barriers in order to promote an individual‚Äôs power to choose and commit to personal changes, ultimately leading to a sustainable form of human development as individuals gain the skills to drive change for themselves rather than wait for an outside power to make changes for them. Under this methodology, the first program helped the women to develop intrinsic motivation and a sense of empowerment, life skills that built up the women‚Äôs perceptions of themselves and their abilities to form their futures so that, combined with the sexuality education lessons, the program sustainably improved the health care situation in the region. Post-program analysis showed that after receiving IMIFAP (Yo Quiero, Yo Puedo)‚Äôs programming, the women not only knew more about the biology behind sex but also reported greater interest in using contraception and visiting the local health clinic.Clay, Rebecca A. ‚ÄúRevolutionary sex education.‚Äù Monitor on Psychology, Vol. 32, No. 4, pg 58. April 2011: American Psychological Association. Print & Web. http://www.apa.org/monitor/apr01/sexed.aspx By 1987, IMIFAP (Yo Quiero, Yo Puedo) had adapted this model for adolescents, acknowledging that the belief that one has ‚Äúno control‚Äù begins at an early age and that children are least equipped with the knowledge to make positive decisions when it comes to their sexual health. Therefore, IMIFAP (Yo Quiero, Yo Puedo) published a series of manuals and textbooks on sexuality education for children and adolescents, including its first training manual ‚ÄúPlanning Your Life‚Äù.Pick, S., Aguilar, J., Rodriguez, G. Reyes,J., Collado, M.E., Pier, D., Acevedo, M.P., & Vargas, E. (1988). Planeando tu vida: Programa de educacion sexual y para la vida dirigido a los adolescents. [Planning your life: Sexual education program and life skills program for adolescents]. Mexico City: Editorial Planeta Mexicana. Later in 1988, they launched their first national program by the same name with the approval of the Secretary of Education at the time, Manuel Bartlett. The national campaign consisted originally of a small workshop in Quer√©taro, Mexico with a group of teachers, representing all of the states in Mexico. IMIFAP (Yo Quiero, Yo Puedo) sold over half a million copies of their sexuality education textbooks and materials. They continued their campaign by developing a short soap opera called ‚ÄúTalk to me about ‚ÄòThat‚Äô‚Äù with support from the newly elected Secretary of Education, Ernesto Zedillo. In 1991, ‚ÄúPlanning your Life‚Äù was adopted officially into the public education system under the title ‚ÄúAdolescence and Development.‚Äù ‚ÄúInstitucionalizacion del programa ‚ÄòYo Quiero, Yo Puedo‚Äô como politica educative federal‚Äù.

Current Projects  IMIFAP (Yo Quiero, Yo Puedo) focuses on the creation and implementation of programs that encourage participants to develop an intrinsic sense of responsibility and power in order to exercise control over their own lives. After the success of their first program on sexuality education, IMIFAP (Yo Quiero, Yo Puedo) expanded to include programs in four main areas: health, citizenship, productivity, and education. All four center around the concept that knowledge plus life skills minus psychosocial barriers lead to changes in behaviors to form agents of change, reduce risk factors in context, improve gender equality, and increase opportunities for development. Education The school-based programs are centered on life skills and empowerment for parents, teachers that live and coexist with the children, pre-teens, and adolescents from preschool through 9th grade. These programs include topics such as improving academic performance and the classroom environment, and school for mom and dad. For example, such programs help parents of children under 12 years of age and adolescents to assess their role in their children's lives and support the personal growth of each family member. All education programs have the objective of supporting communication, identifying and expression emotions, and establishing and enforcing limits, such as fortifying necessary protective factors that prevent problems such as drug use and alcohol abuse, obesity and unwanted pregnancies, all directed toward the personal development of teachers and parents and the basis for raising healthy, responsible children, capable of taking control of their lives. The organization has taken an active role in the campaign for educational reform in Mexico, launching a national campaign ‚ÄúPresente Maestro!‚Äù in the spring of 2013. The campaign was designed to raise awareness to the issues currently facing students and the new reform measures being made by the Mexican government to improve the current system of teaching.Rojas, Paolo. ‚ÄúPresente Maestro! busca aumentar rendimiento escolar‚Äù Audio de Grupo Formula. 26 April 2013.

Violence prevention programming has also benefited 250,000 people and has increased teachers‚Äô knowledge about different types of violence by 27%.  Methodology =Theoretical Foundation  IMIFAP (Yo Quiero, Yo Puedo) makes Nobel Laureate in Economics, Dr. Amartya Sen, ‚ÄúHuman Capabilities Approach‚Äù operational from a psychosocial perspective. Although his philosophy is economically focused and has contributed primarily to the understanding of social indicators as tools to evaluate development economics, it has also been useful for non-profit agencies that seek to make significant differences at the local level in developing communities. First, Dr. Sen defines an ‚Äúagent‚Äù as ‚Äúsomeone who acts and brings about change, and whose achievements can be judged in terms of her own values and objectives, whether or not we assess them in terms of some external criteria as well‚Äù.Pick and Sirkin, 2010, p. 66 In this way, to have personal agency means to have the ability to make and act upon one's own decisions that lead to a self-defined version of success. According to Dr. Sen's ‚ÄúCapabilities‚Äù framework, communities can be considered well developed if individuals possess the capabilities to make positive behavioral changes (doings) that benefit their own well-being (functionings) and that of their community, and a positive behavior change that leads to human development is defined as one that allows that individual to become an agent of change. According to this theory, projects designed to improve human development are only sustainable so long as its recipients are able and choose to make both informed and internally motivated decisions. For example, a project to reduce cervical cancer through providing Pap smear screenings is only successful if, upon completion, the project has successfully instilled a desire and habit amongst individuals in that community to regularly visit the local clinic for a screening.Pick and Sirkin, 2010, p. 66Sen, Amartya K. (1985). Commodities and Capabilities. Oxford: Oxford University Press  FrEE-Framework for Enabling Empowerment  FrEE (Framework for Enabling Empowerment) is the official methodology utilized by IMIFAP (Yo Quiero, Yo Puedo). In 2010, Pick and health services researcher Jenna Sirkin officially published the FrEE theoretical framework in the first edition of their book, Breaking the Poverty Cycle: A Human Basis for Sustainable Development.Kraus, Arnoldo. ‚ÄúYo Quiero, Yo Puedo.‚Äù Contracorriente. 27 April 2011.

Through this awareness, they become contributors of their own growth process, as well as the social, economic, and political development of their communities. ‚Ä¢ To exercise increased choice in various domains, people need to have, and feel they have, the competencies and knowledge not only to serve but also to demand rights and services. ‚Ä¢ Through the development of core competencies and the opportunities for reducing psychosocial barriers, individual needs are connected to newly acquired competencies and opportunities. ‚Ä¢ People first begin to change behaviors in a few concrete situations and can subsequently expand their learning into new domains. This expansion develops through success in specific situations and a growing sense of personal agency. ‚Ä¢ As people's competencies are enhanced, they are able to create new contents where choices are more likely to be made, actualized, and sustained. ‚Ä¢ Maintenance of personal change is necessary for sustainability of development.

Controversy  In 1988, during the phase of scaling up their first program, Planeando tu vida (Planning your Life), to the national level, IMIFAP (Yo Quiero, Yo Puedo) faced strong opposition from a few small, yet influential, conservative groups in Mexico, namely the National Union of Parents (UNPF) and Mexican Family (FAME). These groups argued that IMIFAP, in providing sexuality education programs that addressed the topics of contraceptives, masturbation, and homosexuality, was ‚Äúignoring universal values of Catholicism and promoting libertarianism‚Äù.Pick, Susan, Martha Givaudan, & Michael R. Reich. Development in Practice, Volume 18, Number 2. ‚ÄúNGO‚Äîgovernment partnerships for scaling up: sexuality education in Mexico‚Äù. Rutledge Publishing, 2008. Web & Print. They pressured the government at the time not to adopt IMIFAP (Yo Quiero, Yo Puedo)‚Äôs model for sexuality education and, in 1991, paid for advertisements, in national newspapers and other forms of media, that denounced such plans to adopt the IMIFAP (Yo Quiero, Yo Puedo) sexuality education model and texts. As a result, IMIFAP (Yo Quiero, Yo Puedo) made compromises and adjusted their programing so that the program version used on the national level no longer included portions on masturbation and homosexuality. Ultimately, IMIFAP (Yo Quiero, Yo Puedo) agreed that it was better to see their program adapted for implementation rather than rejected altogether. Finally, while IMIFAP (Yo Quiero, Yo Puedo) does not still experience opposition to any of their programs, they sometimes encounter resistance or hesitation to participate from certain community members due to pressures from sociocultural norms and fears of interruption to the status quo.Pick and Sirkin, 2010, p. 84 Awards and recognition In 2000, Queen Silvia of Sweden presented IMIFAP with an award for its ‚Äú‚ÄúI want to, I can ‚Ä¶ prevent substance abuse‚Äù program.

Life He was born in Lamia in 1907. His father, Ioannis Tsirimokos, was also of a political background. He got involved in politics from a young age and was first elected to parliament in 1936 on the Liberal Party's ticket. During the Axis Occupation of Greece, he co-founded a small leftist party, the Union of People's Democracy (ELD). He served as its general secretary, while the distinguished law professor Alexandros Svolos served as its president. In 1941, ELD joined the National Liberation Front (EAM), and Tsirimokos gained a seat in EAM's central committee. In 1944, Tsirimokos was appointed as Secretary for Justice in the EAM-controlled Political Committee of National Liberation. In the 1950 elections, after the Greek Civil War, Tsirimokos was elected again into parliament, for Athens, on behalf of the renamed Socialist Party-Union of People's Democracy (SK-ELD). He was re-elected in the 1958 elections for the United Democratic Left, and again in 1961, 1963 and 1964 for the Center Union. In 1963, he was elected as Speaker of the Parliament. During the period of the \\"Apostasia\\" in the summer of 1965, Tsirimokos was chosen by King Constantine II to form a government. He failed to gain a vote of confidence, and was succeeded by Stefanos Stefanopoulos, in whose government he retained ministerial posts. He died in Athens on 13 July 1968 at the age of 61.

Whether one has a particular entitlement or right is irrelevant to whether one's assertion is true or false. Where an objection to a belief is made, the assertion of the right to an opinion side-steps the usual steps of discourse of either asserting a justification of that belief, or an argument against the validity of the objection. Such an assertion, however, can also be an assertion of one's own freedom or of a refusal to participate in the system of logic at hand.

She is also active as a professor, currently working at Mcgill University. She was named a member of the Order of Canada in 2014 for her contributions to music and Acadian culture. Early life and education Suzie LeBlanc was born into an Acadian family in Edmundston, New Brunswick. Her mother, Marie-Germaine Leblanc, was an operatic soprano and singing teacher. As a child LeBlanc played the piano and flute, and was a member of the youth choir Les Jeunes Chanteurs d'Acadie. In 1976 LeBlanc moved with her family to Montreal, where she was first exposed to baroque music at a concert of the Studio de musique ancienne de Montr√©al and experienced what she later called \\"love at first sight\\" for the music. From 1979 to 1981 she studied harpsichord and voice at the C√©gep de Saint-Laurent, with harpsichord as her major subject. Career=As a singer LeBlanc specializes in the 17th and 18th century repertoire. She began singing professionally with the New World Consort of Vancouver. In a review of a 1987 New World Consort recital of early music in Spanish, French, English, and Italian, the New York Times music critic Bernard Holland described her voice as \\"a musically communicative, purely tuned soprano ‚àí and one that enunciated crisply in all four languages.\\" Feeling the need to improve her vocal technique after three years of \\"education on stage\\", she went to study in Europe, where Anthony Rooley soon invited her to join his early music group The Consort of Musicke, replacing soprano Emma Kirkby for eight months. She later recorded two albums with the Consort of Musicke. She has often worked with the American lutenist and music director Stephen Stubbs, recording numerous albums with his early music group Tragicomedia. She has sung and recorded with the Purcell Quartet, the Parley of Instruments, Red Byrd, Les Voix Humaines, Tafelmusik Baroque Orchestra, Amsterdam Baroque Orchestra, Musica Antiqua K√∂ln, Australian Brandenburg Orchestra, and Les Violons du Roy, among others. LeBlanc frequently performs and records with countertenor Daniel Taylor. Her opera roles include Poppea in L'incoronazione di Poppea at the Op√©ra de Montr√©al with Daniel Taylor, Clori in Handel‚Äôs Clori, Tirsi e Fileno, and Euridice in Monteverdi‚Äôs Orfeo. She was a soloist in Jonathan Miller's 2006 staging of Bach's St Matthew Passion at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. LeBlanc performs and records music from periods and genres other than early music. Her 2008 recording of Messiaen songs won the Conseil Qu√©becois de la musique's Opus award for best contemporary music recording. She has recorded two albums of Acadian folksongs, La mer jolie (2004) and Tout passe (2007). In 2014 she released La Veill√©e de No√´l, an album of old French Christmas songs. The little-known no√´ls were taken from Rondes et chansons populaires illustr√©es, a volume published in Paris in the late nineteenth century and discovered by LeBlanc's cousin at the Coll√®ge St- Joseph in Memramcook, New Brunswick. LeBlanc commissioned settings of several of Elizabeth Bishop's poems from four Canadian composers: Christos Hatzis, John Plant, Alasdair MacLean, and Emily Doolittle. The songs were first performed during the 2011 Elizabeth Bishop Centenary in Nova Scotia. LeBlanc used crowdfunding to finance the songs' recording. The resulting album, I am in need of music, in which LeBlanc is accompanied by a chamber orchestra conducted by Dinuk Wijeratne, contains settings of eleven Bishop poems. Released in 2013, it has been called \\"an eloquent testament to love, devotion and determination\\". The recording was a finalist for the 2014 Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia Masterworks Arts Award. It won the 2014 East Coast Music Award for best classical album. LeBlanc currently teaches at Mcgill University.https://www.atmaclassique.com/En/Artistes/ArtisteInfo.aspx?ArtisteID=4 Other activities LeBlanc teaches baroque singing at the Universit√© de Montr√©al. In 2000 she founded Le nouvel Op√©ra, of which she is co-artistic director. She was also the founder and first artistic director of the Acad√©mie Baroque de Montr√©al. As an actress, LeBlanc played the leading female character in the feature film Lost Song, which won the Toronto International Film Festival Award for Best Canadian Film in 2008. LeBlanc was introduced to the poetry of Elizabeth Bishop in 2007, when visiting Bishop's childhood home of Great Village, Nova Scotia. Fascinated by Bishop's life and work, LeBlanc collaborated with the Nova Scotian poet Sandra Barry to organize the Elizabeth Bishop Centenary Festival in Nova Scotia in 2011. She is the honorary patron of the Elizabeth Bishop Society of Nova Scotia. Honours LeBlanc has been awarded honorary doctoral degrees by Mount Allison University, Mount Saint Vincent University, the University of King's College, and the Universit√© de Moncton. In 2010 the Qu√©bec Arts Council awarded her a Career Grant. In 2014 she was made a Member of the Order of Canada for \\"contributing to the development of early-period music and Acadian culture as a singer and teacher\\".

The HQ was originally going to replace the III Army Corps of the Hellenic Army altogether, taking control of its rapid response units, but this was changed in 2009, so that the two HQs essentially co-exist as a joint formation, each controlling different units of the old Army Corps. The Corps is based in the city of Thessaloniki since 1946. Mission NDC-GR will provide the HQ capabilities for sustainment and rotation for prolonged operations. In order to operate throughout the entire spectrum of NATO missions which may range from high to low intensity, an FLR(L) HQ must be able to fulfill the two broad functions of sustaining/rotating an HRF(L) HQ or as an AJFCC. NDC-GR HQ will be declared to NATO and will be placed under OPCOM to SACEUR once the North Atlantic Council has agreed upon a mission. The HQ can be deployed as an FLR (L) HQ Alliance- wide and beyond. It will be able to operate throughout the entire mission spectrum, ranging from PSO up to high intensity combat operations in any physical environment.  History  III Army Corps was founded after the Balkan Wars, on 16 August 1913 (O.S.), provisionally based at Ioannina and comprising the 2nd Infantry Division at Missolonghi, the 3rd Infantry Division at Korytsa, and the 9th Infantry Division at Ioannina. Headquarters in Thessaloniki A new royal decree on 23 December 1913 (O.S.) finalized the peace-time structure of the Hellenic Army, and III Corps was moved to its new base at Thessaloniki, comprising the 10th Infantry Division at Veroia, 11th Infantry Division at Thessaloniki, and 12th Infantry Division at Kozani, as well as the necessary corps units (5th Field Artillery Regiment, III Sappers Regiment, III Nursing Regiment and III Transport battalion). III Corps remained at Thessaloniki until October 1916, when the establishment of the pro-entente Provisional Government of National Defence in the city finalized the National Schism. The entente powers demanded and secured the withdrawal of the loyalist formations to Thessaly, where III Corps was based in Tsaritsaina, and after the Noemvriana even further south to the Peloponnese. The corps remained there until June 1917, when Greece, reunified under Eleftherios Venizelos, formally entered World War I on the side of the entente. With the reorganization of the army for operations on the Macedonian front, III Corps was disbanded. In December 1919, following the occupation of Smyrna, the Smyrna Army Corps (Œ£œéŒºŒ± Œ£œÑœÅŒ±œÑŒøœç Œ£ŒºœçœÅŒΩŒ∑œÇ) was established, comprising the newly raised Smyrna Division and the Archipelago Division, to which was added in January 1920 the 12th Infantry Division. After the Venizelist electoral defeat in November 1920, the corps was renamed \\"III Army Corps\\", and continued to participate in the Asia Minor Campaign under this name. In the interwar period, the corps returned to Thessaloniki. It participated in the Greco- Italian War and capitulated with the rest of the Hellenic Army after the German invasion of Greece in April 1941. After liberation, corps-level formations began again to be raised in March 1946, when the hitherto superior military commands were converted to army corps: on 16 May 1946, the Central Macedonia Superior Military Command became III Army Corps, once more based at Thessaloniki, with 11th Infantry Division (31st, 32nd, 33rd brigades, 592nd Inf. Battalion, 616th National Guard Battalion) and 10th Infantry Division (35th, 36th, 37th brigades, 603rd Inf. Battalion, 615th National Guard Battalion) at Thessaloniki and 7th Infantry Division (25th, 26th, 27th brigades) at Kavala. It participated in the ongoing Greek Civil War (1946‚Äì49), with a zone of responsibility covering most of northern Greece, from the Kaimakchalan‚ÄîMount Vermion‚ÄîMount Olympus line in the west to the border with Turkey in the east. With the reorganization of the army after the end of the civil war, the III Corps, still headquartered at Thessaloniki, assumed responsibility for the defence of northeastern Greece east of the Axios River. To this end, it comprised 6th Infantry Division at Kilkis, 10th Infantry Division at Serres, 11th Infantry Division at Kavala and 12th Infantry Division at Alexandroupoli. The 6th Infantry Division was transferred to II Army Corps in 1960, but a new 16th Infantry Division was formed in 1975. In the next year, the establishment of IV Army Corps, which took over responsibility for Western Thrace and the Turkish border, III Corps was limited to 10th Division (Serres) and 11th Division (Kavala), with the 3rd Support Brigade in Thessaloniki. On 1 January 1998, a wide-ranging reorganization of the army took place, and III Corps assumed the zone of II Corps as well, now comprising 6th Infantry Division (Kilkis), 10th Infantry Division (Serres), 11th Infantry Division (Kavala), 4th Infantry Brigade (Greece) (Axioupolis), 3rd Support Brigade (Thessaloniki) and the 5/42 Evzone Regiment (Skydra). On 30 June 2004, the corps was dissolved as a national territorial formation and was reduced to a headquarters for the NATO Deployable Corps ‚Äì Greece (NDC-GR), with a parallel secondary mission as garrison of Thessaloniki. The decision to dissolve III Corps as a territorial formation was gradually reversed: in 2006 it was re-established as a national formation under First Army in tandem with its role as NDC-GR, while in 2009 it re-acquired a separate area of responsibility with the allocation of 10th Infantry Brigade at Serres. In 2013, after another wide-ranging reorganization, III Corps assumed control over 8th Infantry Division at Ioannina (despite its name a brigade-level formation) and 9th Infantry Brigade (Greece) at Kozani, while the 10th and 15th infantry brigades were reduced to regimental level.

That year, in 1870, he moved to Andover, Massachusetts to study at Phillips Academy. After three years there, in 1873 he was admitted and studied at Yale College, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1877. At Yale, he was a member of Scroll and Key secret society and Psi Upsilon fraternity. His legal education consisted of a mixture of reading law at his father's practice in Boston as well as attending Boston University School of Law. He graduated from the latter in 1883 with a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.). On April 23, 1884 he married his wife, Frances Field. Career Abbot practiced law in Boston for about seven years until 1891, when he accepted a position to teach law at the University of Michigan, but held the position for only one year when he resigned to accept a professorship of law in Northwestern University. After teaching at Northwestern for just two years, in 1895 Abbot was asked to form a Department of Law at Stanford University by its then President, David Starr Jordan. Upon his arrival, Stanford was suffering widespread financial cuts and layoffs as a result of a dispute over the finances of Leland Stanford's estate as well as the economic fallout from the Panic of 1893. Abbot was forced to perform a wide array of unusual duties to begin work on his new law school, including building furniture for the school himself. The law school grew quickly during its formative years, reaching 100 students by the turn of the millennium. The department was also unique in that it accepted students regardless of race or gender; Abbot accepted students who were Hispanic, Chinese, Japanese, and female. Abbot was a personal friend to famous philosopher William James, who, in fact, was visiting in Abbot's home during the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. He held that position until 1907, after which time he was a member of the law faculty of Columbia University, New York City. He was a legal scholar of wide reputation and a recognized authority on the English and American Law of Real Property. Abbot retired in 1922 around the age of 68. He died in 1941 due to complications from Pyelonephritis.

Vaccaro was in his time one of the most successful painters in Naples, a city then under Spanish rule. Very successful and valued in his lifetime, Vaccaro and his workshop produced many religious works for local patrons as well as for export to Spanish religious orders and noble patrons.Riccardo Lattuada. \\"Vaccaro, Andrea.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 31 May 2016 Life Very little is known for certain about Andrea Vaccaro's early life. Andrea Vaccaro was born in Naples as the son of Pietro Baccaro and Gioanna di Glauso. His father practiced a legal profession. Vaccaro first applied himself to the study of literature. He then turned to art. Where it was earlier believed that he apprenticed with the late-Mannerist painter Girolamo Imparato, it is now known that Imparato died in 1607 and could thus not have been his teacher. Andrea Vaccaro was at the age of 16 apprenticed to Giovanni Tommaso Passaro, a minor artist. No works from this early phase of his career have been preserved. Saint Agatha On 16 February 1628, Angela Geronima, a child of the young artist and his first wife was baptized. This suggests that he had already established a family by this time. No further information about this first marriage is available. His paintings from shortly after 1620 show the influence of Caravaggio and his Neapolitan followers. He reportedly painted a copy of Caravaggio's Flagellation (Galleria Nazionale di Capodimonte). At one time, both the copy and original hung together in San Domenico Maggiore. Not all scholars accept that the copy was in fact painted by Vacarro. After 1630 Vaccaro came into contact with the work of Guido Reni, Anthony van Dyck and Pietro Novelli. He produced copies of the work of these artists for Neapolitan collectors and Flemish art dealers in Naples such as Gaspar Roomer and Jan Vandeneyden. It is believed he was also active as an art dealer, as was common among Neapolitan painters of the time. Vaccaro contracted his second marriage to the 24-year old Anna Criscuolo on 17 April 1639. A year later, on 13 March 1640, their son Tomaso Domenico Nicola was born. He would later be known as the painter Nicola Vaccaro. Vaccaro became very successful and almost every collection in Naples boasted at least one painting by him. Vaccaro also had patrons in other parts of Italy.Tuck-Scala, Anna Kiyomi, The Documented Paintings and Life of Andrea Vaccaro (1604-1670), Graduate Program: Art History Degree: Doctor of Philosophy, Dissertation, Date of Defense: August 20, 2003, The Pennsylvania State University From 1635 he started exporting religious canvases to Spain for religious orders and noble patrons. He was further patronized by the Spanish Viceroy of Naples, Gaspar de Bracamonte. In 1656 the plague devastated Naples decimating half of the population, including the artists Bernardo Cavallino and Massimo Stanzione with whom Andrea Vaccaro had been closely linked. Vacarro continued to receive many commissions, including one for frescos in the Theatine church of San Paolo Maggiore in Naples, the sole fresco commission in his career. Saint Stephen taken to his Martyrdom In 1665 Vacarro was one of the founders and head of the 'Congrega dei SS Anna e Luca', a form of painter's guild that likely had as its aim to promote the status of artists in Naples. Between 1650 and 1670, Vaccaro's art was highly influential on Neapolitan painting besides that of Massimo Stanzione, the leading artist at that time, and that of the young Luca Giordano, who was just making his mark. In the latter part of his life Andrea Vaccaro was also active as an official in the confraternity called the 'Confraternita dei Bianchi of the Conservatorio of the Piet√† dei Turchini' from 1657. He was also a Governatore of the 'Conservatorium and Church of Piet√† dei Turchini'. His pupils included Giacomo Farelli and Giuseppe Fattoruso. Work Only two paintings by Andrea Vaccaro are known to bear a full signature: Saint Teresa‚Äôs Vision of the Golden Collar (Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, Madrid) and Saint Luke Portraying the Virgin and Child painted for the Corporation of Neapolitan Painters. These signed paintings also include the year. Only one other painting, the Communion of Saint Mary of Egypt displays the year. The Triumph of David Vaccaro‚Äôs monogram is present on a number of his paintings. It is composed of his initials A and V interlaced, with the left leg of the A over the left part of the V, and vice versa for the right parts. As the bar of the A is omitted, the center of the two letters creates a diamond shape. Sometimes a small triangle (delta) appears on both sides of the monogram, as found in Latin inscriptions for abbreviations and/or word divisions. It has been difficult to attribute authentic works to Vaccaro as his stylistic development is not very well understood. As he operated a large workshop assisting in his works or creating copies of his work, attributions have been fairly difficult. Vaccaro was initially influenced by Caravaggio, in particular in his use of chiaroscuro effects and the naturalistic rendering of his figures. From 1630 onwards he also drew inspiration from the works of artists such as Guido Reni, Anthony van Dyck and Pietro Novelli. His tenebrism became more illuminated and less harsh, influenced by the more sedate sources such as Pietro da Cortona. The elegant manner of Bernardo Cavallino, whom Vaccaro met and worked with in the second half of the 1640s, became an additional influence. Vaccaro always managed to keep pace with the most important contemporary artistic developments. Vaccaro's late work betrays Luca Giordano‚Äôs brilliant palette and Mattia Preti's interplay of light and shadow.Andrea Vaccaro, Susanna and the Elders at Dorotheum Due to the great success he achieved in life, many of his works were exported to Spain, where a large part of his production is currently located. The Prado (several paintings), The Museu Nacional D'Art de Catalunya (part of the paintings from the cycle of the Story of Tobiah), The Museo de Bellas Artes de Sevilla (Jonah preaching to Nineveh), The Duke of Alba Collection (Mary Magdalene) or The Museo de Salamanca (large Immaculate).

Guide to Krakow webpage at www.kasprzyk.demon.co.uk History The first known settlement within the present Kleparz boundaries was founded before 1184. In this year the Church of St. Florian was erected by the Krak√≥w Bishop Gedko. The settlement grew very fast in number and size, so it soon was known as the Alta civitas and had about one thousand inhabitants as well as 2,380 horses. Casimir the Great granted it location rights in 1366 and named it Florencja, after St. Florian's Church. Houses of timber were built around the market square and its citizens were mainly craftsmen, including smiths and tailors. In the next century the new name Kleparz (Latin Clepardia) replaced the previous one. Kleparz was burned down several times during wars or by great fires in 1476, 1528, 1655, 1657, 1755 and 1768. In 1792 it was incorporated into the city of Krak√≥w by the decision of the Great Sejm. In the 19th century Kleparz was rebuilt with new residential mansions in neoclassicist and art nouveau styles.

New York Times, Jan 23, 2002. In 2003, upon the suggestion of shaman Alex Stark, Alex and Allyson Grey began holding full moon prayer ceremonies in their Brooklyn home to facilitate the construction of the chapel. Due to noise complaints by neighbors, the Greys' home became unsuitable.  Chapel of Sacred Mirrors, New York City: 2004‚Äì2009  Thanks to an outpouring of support from the nascent community that was forming around these gatherings, the first Chapel of Sacred Mirrors opened in a donated space in Chelsea in the heart of NYC's gallery and nightclub district on the autumnal equinox of 2004. Along with the Sacred Mirrors series, the original chapel also displayed a number of Alex Grey's major works (many of which had been repurchased from collectors for the foundation) including Theologue, Net of Being, Cosmic Christ, and Journey of the Wounded Healer, as well as Allyson Grey's Secret Language paintings, and occasional exhibitions of fellow visionary artists. With monthly interfaith celebrations that were held on the New and Full moons, and workshops by leaders in the fields or art, science, and religion, the Chapel of Sacred Mirrors quickly became established as a \\"mecca\\" of the New York \\"New Age\\" community.Johnson, K., 2008. New York Times (Art and Design section), Dec 19, 2008. The use of Alex Grey's artwork on the album covers and stage show of the popular rock group Tool, album artwork for The Beastie Boys and Nirvana,*Leland, J., 2002. New York Times, Jan 23, 2002. and as part of a major installation at the Burning Man festival in 2006, greatly increased Alex Grey's popularity among the youth and New Age counterculture, The original NYC Chapel of Sacred Mirrors also featured workshops on painting, sacred geometry, and sacred architecture, as well as a series of popular \\"Entheogenic Salons\\" that included live painting by Alex and Allyson Grey, along with international electronic music DJs and producers, video artists, dance, and other performances.  The Sacred Mirrors and visionary art  The Sacred Mirrors series, which were created over a ten-year period between 1979 and 1988, were originally inspired by a lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) vision that Alex and Allyson Grey shared in 1976, during which they both experienced the interconnectedness of all beings and things in the form of a \\"toroidal fountain and drain of self-illuminating love energy, a cellular node or jewel in a network that linked omnidirectionally without end\\"Grey, A., 1998. The Mission of Art, Shambhala, pg. 150 that Alex later named \\"the Universal Mind Lattice\\". (Allyson Grey's painting Jewel Net of Indra was similarly inspired by this shared visionary experience) This series of paintings has been exhibited internationally, and are the subject of the 1990 book Sacred Mirrors: The Visionary Art of Alex Grey, which has been translated into nine languages and sold over 150,000 copies worldwide. The subtitle of this book is now believed to be one of the key influences in the naming of a new genre now known as \\"visionary art\\". While Alex Grey himself defines visionary art as \\"the creative expression of glimpses into the sacred unconsciousness\\" Grey, A., 1998. The Mission of Art, Shambhala, pg. 22. and states that its ultimate purpose is \\"the mystical experience of spiritual illumination, unity, wisdom, and love\\".Grey, A., 1998. The Mission of Art, Shambhala, pg. 150. Claiming a lineage that includes the ancient shamanic cave-painters, the 12th century Abbess Hildegard of Bingen, Hieronymus Bosch, and the English mystical painter and writer, William Blake, contemporary visionary art is also characterized by the belief that along with traditional methodologies such as fasting, meditation, yogic exercises, breath work, and prayer, \\"vision drugs\\"Grey, A., 1998. The Mission of Art, Shambhala, pg. 121 such as LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, and dimethyltryptamine (DMT), can also be utilized as tools by artists seeking mystical visions. Works by painters such as Pablo Amaringo, Alex Grey, Ernst Fuchs, and Robert Venosa, who all openly admit the direct influence of consciousness-altering compounds upon their art, have previously been loosely categorized under the more profane category of \\"psychedelic art\\". By consciously advocating these compounds as \\"entheogens\\" (generating-God- within), or plants and drugs that invoke a sense of the numinous or a mystical experience, as opposed to mere \\"psychedelics\\", visionary art claims a sacred and profound nature for these compounds. The fact that Alex Grey credits the inspiration of the Sacred Mirrors to an LSD experience he mystically shared with his later-wife Allyson makes this series arguably one of the most famous examples of contemporary visionary art. (Ayahuasca Dreaming, by the American painter Robert Venosa (1936‚Äì2011), is another example.) The inspiration by the Greys to build a Chapel in 1985 is also credited to a shared drug experience, this time on the powerful \\"empathogen\\" MDMA. Dedicated to fostering interfaith and post-denominational spiritual understanding, the Greys envision the Chapel of Sacred Mirrors as \\"a new type of sacred space with both a personal and a planetary perspective ‚Ä¶ a Chapel of transformative art that aligns the individual self: body, mind, and spirit, through contemplation of the Sacred Mirrors *Hanna, J., 1998. \\"Alex Grey Speaks...\\".

Chapel of Sacred Mirrors, Wappinger, New York; 2009‚Äìpresent  While the original Chapel of Sacred Mirrors in New York City was never intended to be a permanent site, its popularity amongst the New York 'New Age' community allowed it to survive longer than initially conceived, operating from the autumnal equinox of 2004 until January 1, 2009. On September 12, 2008, after a lengthy search for a permanent site, the Foundation for the Chapel of Sacred Mirrors purchased a forty-acre former interfaith center on the Hudson River 65 miles north of New York City in the Wheeler Hill Historic District in Wappinger, N.Y. . In November 2008, the organization was recognized as providing an extraordinary environment for contemplation, and as a center for encouraging the creative spirit, and was granted church status with a permanent 501(c)(3). Alex and Allyson Grey live permanently on the grounds, which also house a 10,000-square-foot guesthouse with cafe and gift-shop. The Greys' popular full moon ceremonies have continued uninterrupted at this new location, along with special events, permaculture courses, and a variety of workshops that have attracted a number of guest presenters including the American folk-musician and eco-activist Pete Seeger, and eco-artist Julia Butterfly Hill With the Greys' desire to make the Chapel of Sacred Mirrors open and representative to all visionary and contemporary sacred art, visiting artists are encouraged to create murals, labyrinths, gardens, and sculptures; most notably Kate Raudenbush's Altered State, a two-story domed steel structure first seen at Burning Man in 2008 that now resides in a meadow on the CoSM grounds. The closing of the New York City location on January 1, 2009 signaled the start of a fundraising phase by Alex and Allyson Grey as their live painting performances have become increasingly popular and included in festivals and special events worldwide. Along with CoSM's own fund-raising events, the Greys are popular speakers who have been invited to present on their art and the building of CoSM at a wide variety of events ranging from local health and wellness festivals to international symposiums on psychedelic research (World Psychedelic Forum, MAPS' psychedelic science events) and the transpersonal experience (ITA). In 2013 Alex Grey was invited to present at TedX in Hawaii. Observers half the couple's age have remarked upon their drive and energy for a project that will take many years to complete. The Chapel of Sacred Mirrors' permanent collection of Alex and Allyson Grey's art has currently been placed in storage as fundraising continues.

Through his school connections, he made the acquaintance of Mushanokoji Saneatsu and Shiga Naoya, and he contributed works to the Shirakaba (\\"White Birch\\") literary journal. He is considered a typical spokesman for the humanistic philosophy of the Shirakaba school. Publication of Shirakaba was suspended in 1923 after the Great Kant≈ç earthquake, but Nagayo and Mushanokoji collaborated to bring out a new literary magazine, Fuji, the same year. As a literary critic for Fuji, Nagayo railed against the proletarian literature movement of the pre-war period. His major works include the plays Kou to Ryuho (1916‚Äì1917), Indara no ko (\\"Child of Indra\\", 1921), and the historical novel Takezawa sensei to iu hito (1924‚Äì25). He is best known in the West for his screenplay Seido no Kirisuto (\\"Christ in Bronze\\"), a story about religious persecution in Edo period Japan, which was one of the entries in competition at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival.

She is the mother of Nathan and Peter Petrelli. The character is based upon the Angela Lansbury character Mrs. Iselin in the film The Manchurian Candidate. In both cases the leading female role has a hidden agenda and wishes to make her son President or a leader at any cost.Commentary for \\"How to Stop an Exploding Man\\" She has the ability to see into the future and the past through dreams, and can also enter and manipulate other people's dreams. This was not revealed until the show's third-season premiere. Angela served as the main antagonist of the webseries: \\"The Recruit\\". Background Angela is one of the twelve members of the group established by Adam Monroe thirty years prior to the events of Kirby Plaza. The other eleven members include her husband Arthur Petrelli, Daniel Linderman, Robert Bishop, Maury Parkman, Kaito Nakamura, Charles Deveaux, and Victoria Pratt. It is implied in \\"Lizards\\" that Angela had a sexual relationship with Kaito Nakamura. Before the start of the series, not much is known except that she had two children with her husband of forty-one years, Arthur Petrelli: Nathan (whom she raised on her own while her husband was at war) and Peter. She and her recently deceased husband had been protecting Claire with the Haitian's aid. During the events of \\"Six Months Ago\\", Angela arrives at Peter's graduation party with Nathan and Heidi, Nathan's wife. She informs Peter that his father could not attend because of a meeting with Mr. Linderman in Atlantic City and congratulates Peter for graduating from nursing school. There were enough lawyers in the family, she explained; she always wanted him to be a nurse. Since learning of her husband's death, she has become increasingly blunt and free to speak her mind. During the events of \\"Villains\\", Heidi is left paraplegic by an attempt on her and Nathan's life. After this, Angela confronted Arthur about his suspected involvement, which he flatly denied. Later, she overheard Arthur and Linderman lament their failed murder attempt. As she panicked and threatened Arthur, he placed the thought in her head that Nathan had to die. Linderman, however, was more remorseful, and offered to heal Angela's scars from the many times Arthur had forced thoughts into her head. Remembering Arthur's plans to murder Nathan, she used the Haitian to dampen Arthur's abilities, and poisoned his food at dinner. Before they can dispose of the body, Nathan arrived and called for an ambulance. At the hospital, a doctor revealed to Angela and Nathan that Arthur was dead, and Angela immediately ordered a cremation. It is soon revealed, however, that the doctor was working for Arthur, who is still alive, but permanently paralyzed due to the damage to his nervous system. Character history=Genesis In \\"Genesis\\", Angela is picked up by New York Police Department for shoplifting a pair of socks. While Nathan worries about how it will affect his campaign for the United States Congress, Peter sees it as a cry for attention. Angela tells Peter that Nathan \\"only cares about himself,\\" and that Nathan and the deceased Mr. Petrelli were \\"alpha dogs\\". After Peter is hospitalized, due to his fall in \\"Don't Look Back\\", she confesses that his father did not die of a heart attack as she had claimed. Instead, he committed suicide after two previous suicide attempts. She worries that Peter may be developing the same depressive tendencies and confesses that he was always her favorite child. A few episodes later Angela and Heidi plan a family brunch at Nathan's Hyde Park estate as an opportunity to have Nathan and his family interviewed by Oliver Dennison of the New York Journal. In \\"Godsend\\", Angela and Nathan sit in a comatose Peter's hospital room. Angela is worried sick that Peter is going to die of a heart attack. Later, when Nathan finds Peter gone, she tells him that Peter woke up in a rage and left. She is angry that Peter could keep her worried for two weeks and then just leave, saying she will kill him when she finds him. In \\"Run!\\", Nathan worries that Meredith Gordon will tell the press about Claire, their long-lost, illegitimate daughter; he wants to meet Claire, but Angela persuades Nathan not to meet her, instead paying Meredith to keep quiet. In \\"Parasite\\", the Haitian calls Angela saying in French, \\"Yeah, I've got the girl. What do you want me to do? I see... Marseille.\\" Claire Bennet escapes the Haitian and arrives at Peter's apartment in New York, seeking Peter's aid. She is greeted by his mother instead. Angela, calling Claire by name despite the two having seemingly never met before, informs Claire that she came at a bad time, but invites her in anyway. Once inside, Angela chastises the Haitian in French. Surprised, Claire asks Angela who she is‚ÄîAngela reveals that she is Claire's grandmother. Angela amusingly notes how Claire was so determined to get to Peter, going so far as to run away from the Haitian. She says that Claire's stubborn streak is just like her father's. In \\".07%\\", Angela explains to Claire that she and her husband took steps to protect Claire. After the fire that destroyed Meredith's home fourteen years previously, she let Nathan believe Claire had died. She admitted to knowing about Claire's powers, and urges her to go to Paris until she is old enough to make her own choices. When Claire asks her if Angela has powers, Angela deflects the question. Later, Mohinder brings Peter's body to the house. Distraught, she sends Mohinder away. When Nathan arrives, she persuades him to hide Peter's death until after the election. After Claire revives Peter, Angela interrupts a conversation between Peter and Nathan. Peter begins to explain about his abilities, but Angela tells them both that she knew long before they did. In \\"The Hard Part\\", Angela reveals to Nathan that she has been working with Linderman. Regarding the bomb, she explains that \\"a lot of people put time and care into making this a reality, myself included,\\" and urges him to have faith in his destiny (to become President). She finally persuades him by asking rhetorically \\"Can you be the one we need?\\" (the same request that future Hiro made to Peter). Even though she is allied with Linderman, this has not stopped her from keeping Claire out of the hands of Linderman's Company. In \\"How to Stop an Exploding Man\\", Peter sees Angela conversing with Charles Deveaux at some past instance during the early days as caretaker of Mr. Deveaux. The two appear to be old friends and discuss the plans for the future. Angela supports the plan for Nathan to rise to power after the explosion. Deveaux conversely believes Peter's kind heart will be the key to saving the future, to which Angela reveals that she does not think that Peter is capable of such greatness. Generations In \\"Four Months Ago...\\" she tries to scare off Nathan's wife, Heidi, by telling her Nathan's condition is related to the condition that drove Mr. Petrelli to suicide and urges Heidi to keep quiet about the whole thing for Nathan's sake. In \\"Four Months Later...,\\" Angela is confronting Nathan over Peter's 'death' (although it is later revealed to the audience that he is alive). After being ordered out of the apartment, she finds a torn photograph of herself with a red helix drawn over her face (indicating her future demise). The person on another piece of the photo, Kaito Nakamura, is brutally murdered that night. His photograph was marked in the same fashion as Angela's. In \\"Lizards\\", Angela was taken in by New York Police Department to be questioned about the murder of Kaito Nakamura. It is revealed through the questioning that she was a major stockholder in the failing Yamagato Industries, leading Parkman to press on whether she killed him for money or sex. She responds by denying both and adding that she had not slept with Nakamura \\"for a long time\\". Later, an unknown person attacks her in the interview room but Parkman saves her. In Angela's hands is a piece of picture, ripped from the same picture as Kaito Nakamura's piece, with the helix symbol on it. In \\"The Kindness of Strangers\\", she retracts her assertion that she is innocent and admits to killing Nakamura, though Parkman realizes she is lying to cover someone. The wounds she sustained are described as self-inflicted. After she is taken in, Nathan and Parkman team up to decipher the identity of the killer. In \\"Cautionary Tales\\", Matt Parkman uses his newly discovered mind control power to have Angela brought back in for questioning. He uses his power to get her to tell the truth, attempting to ascertain the identity of the one masterminding their murders and the nameless woman on the photo of the Company's founding members. Despite her resistance, as well as her claim that he will be no better than his father for his efforts, he learns the name of the woman. In \\"Powerless\\", Parkman and Nathan confront Angela about the truth of the virus. Though reluctant to divulge the information, Nathan's accusation of her generation's deeds punishing his future convinces her otherwise. She also gives Parkman specific instructions to kill Peter if he cannot be reasoned with. After Nathan is shot at his press conference, Angela has a telephone conversation wherein she states that there was no choice but to shoot Nathan. She then comments that the action \\"opened Pandora's Box.\\" Villains In this Volume, Angela is upgraded to a main character from a recurring/supporting character. In \\"The Second Coming\\", Angela reveals to Future Peter that her power is that of dreaming the future, explaining that Peter's first ability was absorbed from her. In \\"The Butterfly Effect\\", Angela becomes the head of the Company after the death of Bob Bishop; her first on-screen action is to fire Bob's daughter Elle, stating that she was only kept on the Company books at her father's insistence. After Sylar is recaptured, she claims to him that she is his real mother, and that she gave him up for adoption. In \\"One of Us, One of Them\\", Angela partners Noah with Sylar, much to the former's dismay. While they successfully capture some of the escapees, Sylar kills Jesse Murphy for his power and is placed back in his cell. In \\"Angels and Monsters\\", she encounters Peter in Sylar's cell, the former having just snapped the latter's neck. Peter loses control and begins to open up Angela's skull, but Sylar wakes up and throws him against the window, knocking him unconscious. Soon afterwards, she puts Peter in an artificial coma, and reveals to Nathan and Tracy Strauss that Nathan's ability was artificially induced. Nathan is naturally disgusted with her, and she later has a vision of Tracy, Peter, and Nathan being brutally murdered by Arthur Petrelli. Angela insists that she will stop him, but he tells her that she will not even be able to move. She wakes up from her dream, paralyzed. In \\"Eris Quod Sum\\", she appears to Sylar while he is in the coma in which Peter imprisoned him. She tells Sylar to save Peter from Pinehearst, and to show her why he is her favorite son. Sylar awakens from the coma and kisses Angela on the forehead as she sleeps, agreeing to rescue Peter. In \\"It's Coming\\", Matt Parkman is able to journey inside her mind, where he finds her handcuffed to a chair. He tries in vain to free her, but she reveals that even if he can remove the handcuffs, Arthur has locked all exits from her prison. Arthur then appears to Matt in the guise of Daphne Millbrook, and proceeds to stab Matt. Matt is forced to bring the real Daphne into the prison, and she reveals that she is in love with him. Angela then reminds Arthur that they had once felt that way about each other, and he reluctantly frees her. She is allowed to leave with Daphne and Matt, waking up from her coma. She is soon reunited with Peter, Nathan, and Claire in her hospital room. With her forces gathered, Angela tells them about the formula, revealing that there is a third piece required: a catalyst which hosts in the blood of a human being. Kaito Nakamura was the only person to know the host's identity. When Angela finishes explaining, Claire informs them of her belief that she is the catalyst, as Sylar saw something different inside of her. In \\"The Eclipse, Part 1\\", Angela sends her team out on recruitment missions: Nathan and Peter off to Haiti to find the Haitian, and Matt and Daphne to find Hiro. She also sends Claire into hiding with Noah to keep her from falling into Arthur's hands. In \\"Our Father\\" she sends Peter and the Haitian to kill Arthur. In \\"Dual\\", Angela is interrogated by Sylar. She confirms his suspicion that she is not his mother. However, she reveals that the Grays are not his parents either, and that she knows the identity of his real parents. Sylar tries to force her to tell him who his birth parents are, but is stabbed in the back of the head by Claire. =Webisode: \\"The Recruit\\"= After Primatech's destruction, Angela intercepts Pvt. Rachel Mills, survivor of Pinehearst's destruction, and abducts her in order to learn about a vial of formula she took from the lab, and tricks her into revealing its location: Rachel's bullet wound. She locks Rachel in a cell at a New Jersey facility and quietly waits and watches as the soldier uses her ability to escape (Hanging By A Thread). Then she calls her longtime friend, Leona, Rachel's supposed late mother. Fugitives In \\"A Clear and Present Danger\\", Angela presses Claire into getting a college education in order to have any shot at a normal life. When Claire deems this impossible and expresses her belief that Sylar had survived the Primatech disaster, Angela counters that Sylar is dead. She later talks to Nathan on the phone about his plans to round up people with abilities, only to discover Claire eavesdropping. In \\"Trust and Blood\\", Angela is none too happy that Nathan went to the U.S. Government instead of her. When Nathan calls her, she assumes he is seeking absolution, and refuses to give it to him; as she says this, she is reading a newspaper article about mass civilian deaths in Angola. In \\"Cold Wars\\", when Matt delves into Noah's mind, one of the flashbacks depicts Noah meeting Angela at a park bench. She confirms the end of Primatech and gives him a watch as a token of his services to the Company. Angela and Noah meet again at the same park bench, and it can be assumed that the two are secretly working against Nathan's second-in- command, Danko \\"The Hunter\\", yet their true ambitions have yet to be revealed. In \\"Exposed\\" Nathan saves Peter from falling off a building and brings him to her. Peter tricks Nathan, steals his power, and flies away. Just as Nathan is about to fly after him, Angela stops him and says that he has to be ready and that she's dreamt what's going to happen. She whispers something in Nathan's ear but it has yet to be revealed what. In \\"Shades of Gray\\", Noah leads Danko to her to get info on Nathan. Angela acts snobby towards him and does not give any thing and also reminds him of his horrid past in Angola (see \\"Trust and Blood\\" above). In \\"Cold Snap\\", Danko commands his men to capture her. Noah warns her about the plan, and Angela expresses her fear that Peter will not forgive her for what she and Noah are doing. She dreams of the abduction and is able to escape at the last moment. She comes to her old friend, Millie (Swoosie Kurtz), wet and distraught. Millie says she was interrogated earlier about her relationship with Angela. Millie suggests that it's drugs and that she should turn herself in. Angela refuses, so Millie gives her money and Angela steals her umbrella. On the street, she is trapped by agents, so she walks into a building and into an elevator, but the agents bring the elevator back down. Just as the elevator opens, Peter is there, and they fly away through the trapdoor in the ceiling. The two are later shown inside the crown of the Statue of Liberty, with Peter asking, \\"So what now?\\" In \\"Into Asylum\\", it is revealed that Angela has a previously unmentioned sister. After having a premonition of what is to come, Angela says that her whole family need to regroup. It is also revealed that like Peter, Angela wanted to be a hero when her power first manifested. But due to a lack of belief from others she used her position to use and manipulate others, something she deeply regrets. As a result, there are many undisclosed happenings in her past which still continue to haunt her. Young Angela (Alexa Nikolas) arrives Coyote Sands Relocation Center in \\"1961\\". In \\"Turn and Face the Strange\\" Angela is shown to have come together with Nathan, Peter, Claire and Noah at an area called \\"Coyote Sands\\" where they begin by digging in the ground, only to discover skeletal remains of people who Angela apparently knew. In \\"1961\\" Angela reunites with her estranged sister, Alice and it is revealed that she steals socks in honor of Alice's memory. It is also shown that Angela, Daniel Linderman, Bob Bishop, Charles Deveaux, and Alice were held in a facility in which people with abilities were studied. However, when Alice is scared by Dr. Suresh and loses control of her powers, creating a powerful storm, the government agents overreact and end up killing all the posthumans that are still on-site. Angela, and the other founders who had snuck out that night, escaped the slaughter and created Primatech in order to protect the secret of people with abilities. Angela uses this past experience as an example for her family urging them to create a 'new' company to protect other posthumans, and to keep their existence secret. As is continued in \\"I Am Sylar\\", at the diner the group witness a live press conference from Sylar impersonating Nathan Petrelli, which leads the real Nathan to decide to stop him and make things right in his own in order to rectify his recent actions. Angela tries to persuade him by telling that they need to act as a group, but still he leaves, and then Peter agreed to follow him. Later that night, as Angela, Noah and Claire are on their way, they are stopped in the road and surrounded by Danko's agents. In \\"An Invisible Thread\\", it is revealed that Noah anticipated the trap, and asked Claire and Angela to leave the car so they can get Washington D.C. to help Nathan. Once in the Capitol, she tells Claire to find Nathan as she goes for Matt Parkman, who according to her dream has a major role in the salvation of Nathan. At the bus stop, she convinces Matt of Nathan's importance to solve all their problems with HLS, so he agrees to come with her to Nathan. Back in the Capitol, they both find Nathan corpse; Angela cannot believe it due to her dream of Matt saving him. After Sylar is tranquilized and carried to them, she and Noah convince Matt to brainwash Sylar to fill the place of the real Nathan because they all need him to solve his issues, appealing to the fact that he now holds both the appearance and memories of Nathan. She is the only one, along with Matt and Noah that knows Nathan is dead and Sylar is alive impersonating him. During the \\"Sylar\\" funeral, she witness the cremation of James Martin, a shapeshifter who had assumed Sylar's form and retained that form after his death, and talks with Noah and \\"Nathan\\" about the new Company to be created. Redemption Six weeks later, she invites Nathan/Sylar to lunch, and notices his ability of intuitive aptitude to remain still deep in his mind, making her doubt Sylar is entirely gone. In \\"Orientation\\", Angela dreams about meeting Sylar at a sushi bar for lunch and she worries about him showing his real appearance although he acts as the real Nathan; then the limo driver wakes her up in front of the sushi bar. There, as Angela foretold, Sylar arrives, but in Nathan's look, and acts in the exact way she dreamt; then, he talks about how confused he feels about his life recently. Angela tries to convince him that what he is feeling is a midlife crises. After lunch, Angela tries calling Matt Parkman to tell him that Sylar is starting to re-emerge and ask for help, but Matt believes the whole act was a mistake and refuses to help her. Angela ensures him that there's no way out of this. In \\"Acceptance\\", Angela brings \\"Nathan\\" a box of his old possessions, knowing that if he touches them he will gain memories due to Sylar's psychometry. \\"Nathan\\" remembers an accident in which Kelly, the daughter of family friend Millie (Swoosie Kurtz), was killed. When questioned, Angela admits that she covered up Kelly's death and used the Haitian to wipe Nathan's memory of the event, and urges \\"Nathan\\" not to reveal Kelly's death to her mother. \\"Nathan\\" tells Millie the truth anyway, and later at dinner Angela apologizes to Millie for his behavior, unaware that \\"Nathan\\" was at that moment being killed by hitmen hired by Millie. When \\"Nathan\\" regenerates, he is a memory-less Sylar. In \\"Hysterical Blindness\\", Angela visits Peter's apartment and notice that he was unable to reach \\"Nathan\\" to meet them. She is clearly nervous about \\"Nathan\\" and Peter realizes she is not paying attention to him, so angrily he leaves for work. Angela asks if she can stay a little longer to wait for \\"Nathan\\", and then she tells Peter he works too much. Peter then leaves. In \\"Brother's Keeper\\", Nathan's assistant informs \\"Nathan\\" and Peter that Angela arranged Nathan's agenda (covering up his disappearance). Later the Haitian arrives at the senate office and tells Peter that Angela sent him to mind-wipe them. In \\"Thanksgiving\\", Angela arrives at Peter's apartment with servants carrying the Thanksgiving dinner. Both Peter and \\"Nathan\\" insist on knowing the truth about Nathan's corpse, but she insists on having dinner as a family or she will leave and disappear. Once Sylar gets control back, Angela and Peter are forced to sit at the table with him. Then, he reveals what Angela has done and starts to cut her forehead, but Angela's pain makes Nathan fight for control, overcoming Sylar. Nathan then flees from Angela, and Peter follows him. In \\"The Fifth Stage\\", Angela understands that she made a mistake to force Nathan's \\"mind and soul\\" into Sylar and argues with Peter about the need to finish him because he is not Nathan, but Peter still thinks Nathan's psyche can be saved. After losing Nathan over Sylar once again, Peter embraces Angela at his apartment and both grieve him. In \\"Upon This Rock\\" and \\"Let It Bleed\\", Angela is present during the funeral of Nathan. In \\"Close to You\\", Angela visits Peter and is shocked to find Emma Coolidge there. After Emma leaves and Peter demands the truth from her, Angela reveals that she has had a precognitive dream in which Emma is responsible for the deaths of thousands of people and Peter cannot save her, but someone else can. As a result of her evasiveness, Peter copies her power to have the same dream, but Angela warns him that that power is a curse, not a gift. Later that night, Peter has a prophetic dream that is either similar or exactly the same as the one Angela had and sees that she means that Sylar is the one that can save Emma. In \\"The Art of Deception\\", Angela calls Peter to her apartment to help her figure out what to put on Nathan's tombstone. Peter discusses with her their dreams and asks her where Sylar is in order to save Emma. Angela tells him where Sylar is reluctantly, but warns him that one possible future good deed does not make Sylar a good person or Peter's friend. In \\"Reaching Out, Part 1\\", Tracy Strauss comes to Angela and convinces her to give money to her cause (a young posthumans' shelter) reminding her what happened to her sister Alice, and what would be of her if she had a place like this in to help her. Angela finally writes a check, and asks Tracy not to contact her again. Brave New World In the graphic novel \\"Consequences\\", Angela examines the recent events at Central Park, reminding of the several times heroes have come to save the world. She then compares Claire's will with Nathan's, as she fulfilled his dream of coming out to the world (Powerless). In the graphic novels \\"From the Files of Primatech: 1963\\", Angela and the young founders approach a folk musician named Chris Coolidge at New York City while in the search for other founders of the Company. They also meet a young, runaway Kaito Nakamura at the concert, where Chris uses his ability of enhanced synesthesia to lure people to hear his music, but the police enter the scene, so Chris causes an uprising with his ability that ultimately turns into a chaotic and violent scenario. The founders convince him to stop the riot but Chris is killed while attempting to calm the people. On the other hand, they notice Kaito somehow foresaw the outcome and invite him to join their Company. In the graphic novels \\"From the Files of Primatech: 1978\\", Angela enlists a company agent, Mindy Sprague, in replacement of Adam Monroe, to watch over the nuclear plant at Three Mile Island, PA after foreseen an oncoming meltdown due to Mindy's ability to absorb energy and redirect it. After the meltdown happened, Mindy produced a heavy blizzard when she released the energy, which causes the founders to worry about the limits of her ability. Angela informs the others that Mindy and her son, Theodore Sprague, have disappeared, although the Company has already set eyes on young Teddy. Now among the Company founders is listed Arthur Petrelli, who recently introduced Maury Parkman. In the graphic novels \\"From the Files of Primatech: 1988\\", the Company enlists agents Eric Thompson and Claude Rains on a mission in East Berlin, Germany during the Cold War, being Angela the one in charge of the assignment. Once back at the Company, the founders congratulate Eric's achievement, and Angela informs Claude the real target of the mission: a tracking device (isotope pneumatic injection) that will allow them to track any evolved human they meet in their way, starting with Claude. In the graphic novels \\"From the Files of Primatech: 1991\\", as Bob fails to act as a father to Elle, testing her abilities without caring about her, Angela brings to the detained girl a birthday cake and the young Haitian to mind-wipe her memories of the painful tests and her scape from Primatech (which is later on confessed by Noah in \\"Cautionary Tales\\"). Heroes Reborn In \\"June 13 - Part 1\\", Angela meets with Doctor Mohinder Suresh on June 13, 2014, shortly before the Odessa Peace Summit. Angela reveals her knowledge of the H.E.L.E, a human- extinction-level event and she has sold Primatech to Erica Kravid as she believed Erica could save the world. However, Erica only pretended to care and is planning on only saving those she wants to save. Angela has pretended to agree with her, but is really working against her. Angela wants Mohinder, who discovered the event through research in the Arctic, to do a press conference with her revealing the threat to the world. Mohinder refuses to believe her due to her past actions and leaves though her words cause him later doubt and to give a copy of his research to Molly Walker for safe keeping. During the conversation, Angela reveals she had a vision of the event before Mohinder found out it was coming and saw the evos that could save the world. She then receives a call that Claire is in surgery at the hospital and tracks down what she believes to be Noah Bennet but is actually Noah's future self. They rush to the hospital while Hiro Nakamura attempts to stop the bombing of the Summit and learn from Anne Clark that Claire has died giving birth to twins. As Noah tries to understand how Claire could've died, Angela tells him she's had a prophecy and the children are important to the future. After the bombing, Angela discusses the situation with Hiro and Noah and realizes that they are from the future. Angela explains her vision to them and Erica's plan, telling Noah that one or both of Claire's children is the evo she saw in her vision. Noah realizes he had his memory wiped by the Haitian to protect the children as Erica is still searching for them. Remembering that Claire got her power at fifteen, Noah decides the best place for the children is in the past where they can grow up and grow into their powers. It will also protect them from Erica who will be looking for toddlers, not teenagers. Angela agrees to take the twins back in time and raise them and convinces a reluctant Hiro to take her back to 1999. Before she leaves, Noah asks her for the two of them to name the children as Claire never got to. Angela names her great-grandson Nathan in honor of her lost son while Noah names his granddaughter Malina after his own mother. Angela disappears with Hiro and the children into the past. In \\"June 13 - Part 2\\", Angela and Hiro arrive in Odessa in 1999 to Angela's surprise as they were supposed to go to her house in Switzerland. Angela realizes that Nathan absorbed Hiro's powers and did the same to Claire, causing her death. To keep the same from happening to Malina, Angela tells Hiro the children must be raised separately. After the bombing, Noah has Nathan take him to visit Angela who has raised Malina in hiding at a convent. Angela warns him of the signs of the H.E.L.E. and takes a picture of Nathan so his sister can find him when the time is right. After they leave, Farah Nazan arrives and Angela tells Farah there was another part to her vision she didn't have the heart to tell Malina about. In \\"Project Reborn\\", Tommy remembers how Angela had his and Malina's powers tested when they were seven and how they work together. After discovering that they can't control their combined powers, Tommy travels back to Angela's testing and learns that they need a conduit willing to sacrifice themselves for their power to work. Tommy rescues Noah and shows him the testing where Angela reveals that in her vision, there was a third faceless person and she approaches the window behind which Noah is hidden, saying she has an idea of who their conduit will be. In the present, Malina comes out of Union Wells High School and shows Angela a tarot card she found in her locker. Angela tells her that it means that Malina's father is coming for her and Tommy and no one can protect them this time. Alternate Future *In \\"Out of Time\\" when Peter accidentally teleports into a virus-stricken future he is taken to see Angela. After they embrace, Peter pushes Angela away and asks if he should know who she is. She tells him she's with him to help him remember who he is, or the virus will kill everyone it has not already killed. When Peter remembers Angela is his mother, she tearfully embraces him again. Later, as Angela escorts Peter out of the facility, she proclaims that they are going home. Peter sees Caitlin behind a chain link fence and tries to get a hold of her, but then inadvertently teleports back to the present and away from Angela. Powers and abilities The possible futures Angela once foresaw: the explosion future, the shanti virus future, the empowering formula/dark future and Samuel's earthquake destruction future (Consequences). In \\"The Second Coming\\", Angela reveals that she has the power of precognitive dreaming. She says that this is also the first power Peter ever overtly demonstrated. Although she can use this ability through methods such as sedation, more powerful visions can only be achieved through natural sleep. Also, it is stated that her dreams are confusing and open to interpretation, like the dreams of the heroes dying (The Butterfly Effect), although several events seem to appear as exactly as they are going to happen, like the interview with Dr. Chandra Suresh (1961). People with this power can also apparently have the same dream as when Peter copied it from her, he had the same precognitive dream that she did. Angela states that her dreams always come true and indicates she believes that what she sees is fated. (Heroes Reborn: June 13 - Part 1) Further demonstrations of her ability have shown that it goes beyond merely seeing the future, as Peter uses it at one point to visit the past, and Angela uses it to enter Sylar's dreams. Among other talents, Angela has demonstrated resistance to telepathy up to certain level, especially during the interrogation led by Matt Parkman (Cautionary Tales), although this can be attributed to training or by having experienced the same mental stress before, which is demonstrated in \\"Villains\\" as Arthur telepathically convinced her Nathan must die, but requiring more effort and time than other characters. As Linderman has hinted, that was not the first time Arthur used his telepathy on her.

He was the son of one John Cardeny, and sister of the royal mistress Mariota de Cardeny. His early career is obscure. In 1378-80, King Robert II of Scotland petitioned the Pope for a canonry in the diocese of Moray for one Robert de Cardun, despite the fact that the latter already held canonries and prebends in the diocese of Dunblane and Dunkeld. This Robert de Cardun was both a member of King Robert's household and a student at the University of Paris.Dowden, Bishops, p. 70, n. 1. Robert had graduated from Paris in 1381 as Licentiate. In 1392 he was a receiver of the \\"English Nation\\" at Paris and custodian of the Nation's seal.Dowden, Bishops, p. 71, n. 1. In 1394 Robert was still in Paris, now as Master Robert de CardenyDowden, Bishops, pp. 70-1, n. 1. By the time of his provision of the see of Dunkeld in 1398, he already held the position of Dean.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, pp. 97, 103. He had been provided to the see by Pope Benedict XIII on 17 November 1398,Dowden, Bishops, p. 70. and had been consecrated as Bishop of Dunkeld by the November of the following year.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 97. It was said by Alexander Myln that Robert owed his promotion to the affection which King Robert III of Scotland had for Cardeny's sister, Mariota, who had been the mistress of King Robert II, Robert III's father. Robert enjoyed an episcopate of nearly 40 years. He secured the obedience of the Abbot of Iona to Dunkeld in 1431, and in 1433 witnessed the foundation charter of the Collegiate Church of Methven.Dowden, Bishops, p. 71. Among other activities, he was an auditor for the parliament of 1429-30. His episcopate saw the building of a new nave for Dunkeld Cathedral and the construction of a new chapel devoted to Saint Ninian. Robert fathered at least one son with an unmarried woman, Patrick de Cardeny, who became a clerk of the diocese of Dunkeld. Bishop Robert died on either 16 or 17 January 1437.

It is a book of divine comedy that concentrates on the Arabic poetical civilization but in a way that touches all aspects of life. Some say that the Resalat Al-Ghufran has had an influence on, or has even inspired, Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy.Cyril Glass√©, Huston Smith The New Encyclopedia of Islam Rowman Altamira, 2003 p. 278 Context The work is a response to a letter sent to al-Ma øarri by a self-righteous grammarian and traditionist,  øAlƒ´ ibn Man·π£≈´r al-·∏§alabƒ´, known as Ibn al-QƒÅri·∏•. In the words of Suzanne Pinckney Stetkevych, > In his epistle, Ibn al-QƒÅri·∏• sanctimoniously flaunts his own learning and > orthodoxy by impugning a number of poets and scholars for being zindƒ´qs, or > heretics.

In the a mixed timeline of events, the story starts with Ibn al-Qareh in heaven. Al-Ma'arry depicts heaven, as described in the Quran, as a place of pleasures. Everything forbidden in life becomes permissible and all desires are fulfilled with God's grace. The story then explains how al-Qareh was able to enter heaven. While waiting for his judgement outside the realm of heaven al-Qareh feels nervous about the prospects of his judgement, knowing he has led a life of schmoozing to rich men and bones and sins he decides to write a poem to the guards of heaven. He fails but continues to find ways to evade hell until he manages to get a pardon from Prophet Mohammad. After going to heaven, al-Qareh decides to visit hell. He finds it to be filled with the greatest of Arab poets. He returns to heaven and there he finds Adam. He asks Adam if he truly said \\"we are created from earth and shall return to earth\\". Adam says no.

The opening scenes of the movie sets up the various alliances and tensions between a group of cavers. Five of them - Bailey (Sybil Temtchine), Gannon (Mustafa Shakir), Domingo (Andres Saenz-Hudson), Miranda (Ogy Durham), and Ori (Andrew Caple-Shaw) - are part of a team who have caved together for a number of years, making their living from exploring and photographing new caves and reporting back to the world what they find there. Also involved in this trip are two Kazakh natives, Vlad (Kamen Gabirel) and Slava (Neno Pervan), who the band have hired as guides, and Ambrose (Danny A. Jacobs), who is researching for a book on caving. It can also be said that there is a ghost with the group - that of Rachel (Cassandra Duarden), a member of the team who died on an expedition in Peru two years prior, and whose story is told in flashback as the movie goes on. The men are killed one by one by a mysterious creature, and just as the two women find the escape route, they are captured. They awaken in the beast's lair naked and wrapped in animal skin blankets where they find photos, belongings and an airplane wing in the surrounding area. After searching further, the two find water, then food, and, while eating, discover that the meat is one of their dead friends.

The film is produced by Meg Ryan. Plot Arthur Banks (Kiefer Sutherland) is an Ivy League-educated hitman for Latin American drug cartels who picks up solitary women, uses them as cover for a hit, then kills them. His trademark is a bullet with a tungsten core. Over the years, he has become wary of the FBI's attempts to catch him, including by use of satellite and security cameras, which leads him to mostly stay in rural desert areas when not working. The FBI team is spearheaded by Agent George Scanlon (Jamey Sheridan), who lost five years of his career when Banks killed a witness he was guarding 15 years ago while leaving no evidence behind. In a desperation sting, Scanlon plants Agent Bennie Harper (Melora Walters), portraying a drifter, in Banks' path, and Banks picks her up for what he says will be his last job, a hit on a Mexican presidential candidate. Scanlon and Agent Donna Marbury (Leslie Stefanson), along with several support agents, follow Banks and Harper through the Southwest, but the scheme goes wrong when one of the tailing agents is spotted and caught by Banks. Thinking quickly, the agent pretends to be Harper's jealous and abusive ex-husband, but this plan goes awry when Banks, who seems more interested in Harper than normal, kills the agent out of Harper's sight and then disposes of the body in a manner not witnessed by Harper (incineration), leaving the FBI once again with no evidence to arrest him. That night, Banks and Harper become lovers at a remote motel. Scanlon decides to cancel the sting after the agent's death and to withdraw Harper, but Harper talks him out of it, pointing out that Banks is their only lead to his employers in the drug cartels. On the road, Banks confides to Harper that he hates his job but hasn't had a chance to get out of it for years until now. In Mexico, Harper double-crosses both Banks and the FBI, first shooting Banks to stop him from committing the assassination and handcuffing him to the balcony, but then killing the thugs who hired him and taking their key for the payoff from the hit. She tells Banks that she expects the FBI will be so happy to catch and question him that she'll depart with the payoff without much problem, which is why she leaves him alive. However, by the time Scanlon responds to her call on Banks' location, he has escaped. Meanwhile, the FBI agents follow Agent Marbury's sighting of a fleeing Harper to the local airport, only to lose her there, because the \\"sighting\\" was actually Marbury herself in a disguise, which she sheds in a washroom, permitting Harper's undetected escape. In the last scene, Harper and Marbury meet in the desert and kiss, while discussing their new wealth. In the distant brush, we see Banks' boots and bloody hand, unnoticed by the two women. After the screen goes black, we hear a single shot.

History Pickled walnuts have been a delicacy in England since at least the early 18th-century. They were mentioned in several literary works. The botanist Richard Bradley describes pickled walnuts in his 1728 book The Country Housewife and Lady's Director, Charles Dickens in his book The Pickwick Papers, published in 1836. In chapter 49 he writes, Pickled walnuts are also mentioned in Brideshead Revisited by Evelyn Waugh. The Compleat Housewife (London, 1727) gives a recipe for \\"Another Way to pickle Walnuts\\". They're first submerged in vinegar for around two months, then boiled in a solution of high-quality vinegar with flavorings: dill seeds, whole nutmeg, peppercorns, mace and ginger root. The walnuts and pickle boiling are poured into a crock until the mixture has cooled. The nuts are then transferred to a gallipot with a large clove-studded garlic clove, mustard seeds on top with spices, covered with vine leaves over which the pickling liquid is poured. Pickled walnuts are still commonly eaten in England, particularly at Christmas served with an English blue cheese such as Stilton. They are also used in recipes, commonly cooked in beef dishes. Production Pickled walnuts are made from the fruit of both common walnut tree varieties: Juglans regia, the Persian, royal, English or common walnut, and Juglans nigra, the black or American walnut. The first stage is to pick the walnuts whilst they are still green and before the shells have set. Most recipes say that late June is about the best time to pick them. The soft walnuts are then soaked in brine (salt water) for at least ten days. The walnuts are then drained and left to dry in the air. Soaking the walnuts in brine causes a chemical reaction to take place and the walnuts turn dark brown to black in colour when exposed to sunlight. The now-black walnuts are then placed into jars and a pickling solution poured over them. This can vary from a straightforward pickling vinegar to a solution containing spices and sugar. The walnuts are sealed and then left in the jars for anywhere between five days and eight weeks depending on which recipe is followed.

The show, hosted by Pavel Zuna, is filmed on a set similar to the United States set and uses the music from that version, but uses the case opening cue when a low amount is opened from the Canadian version. Players can win as little as 1 Kƒç (Czech koruna) (about 4¬¢ US, ‚Ç¨0.04, 3p, and ¬•4.5) to as much as 5,000,000 Kƒç (about US$197,000, ‚Ç¨185,000, ¬£160,000, and ¬•22,500,000). Gameplay The game began with three contestants at three quiz podiums. In that situation, one of the contestants had to answer three questions correctly to proceed into the main game. For the new season, the host calls out the contestant's name, and the contestant comes to the stage. The contestant must choose one of 26 cases, with hopes of having the highest value. All contestants must eliminate a specific number of cases per round: * Round 1: 6 cases to open * Round 2: 5 cases to open * Round 3: 4 cases to open * Round 4: 3 cases to open * Round 5: 2 cases to open * Final four rounds consist of one case to open each round After the selection of cases for each round, the banker (who is above the studio) will call down to the host using a phone on the podium, giving the contestant a bank offer. The host then opens a button cover at the center of the podium. The contestant can choose to push the metal button and take the offer or close the cover and continue the game. If the contestant takes the offer prior to the final round, the game continues to see if the contestant has a lower amount in his/her case. If the contestant rejects the final offer, the contestant will be allowed to keep their case or switch their case for the remaining case in play. The contestant then wins the amount that is in their case. The case is revealed to the audience when the amount in the case is lower than the offer or when the contestant wins any of the three top prizes, and the contestant opens the case when the case amount is higher than the bank offer, just like in the Estonian version of the show.  Winners  The biggest winners include: * Marek Mi≈°ka from Kladno, who won 1,700,000 Kƒç on the episode aired on November 4, 2007. * Jana Anton√≠nov√° from Litv√≠nov, who won 1,300,000 Kƒç on the episode aired on June 24, 2007. * Anton√≠n Kocourek, the winner of 930,000 Kƒç on the February 25, 2007 episode.

Originally based in Athens and covering southern Greece, since 1962 it was responsible for covering Greece's northwestern borders (Epirus and Western and Central Macedonia). It was disbanded in 2013. History Following the Balkan Wars of 1912‚Äì13, the Hellenic Army began a major reorganization and expansion. For the first time, army corps-level formations were established on a permanent basis. Six corps were provisionally envisioned in August 1913. On 28 November 1913 (O.S.), by Royal Decree the Athens Army Corps was reorganized as a \\"model\\" formation. Alongside its constituent units, it was to serve as a training formation for the entire Army. For this purpose, it also included all military schools and academies, and was to be commanded by the head of the French military mission to Greece and extensively staffed by French officers of the mission. The new peacetime establishment was further modified and formalized by Royal Decree on 23 December 1913 (O.S.), and the I Army Corps was officially established on that date, comprising three infantry divisions (1st Infantry Division at Larissa, 2nd Infantry Division at Athens, and the newly raised 13th Infantry Division at Chalkis), a cavalry regiment, an artillery regiment, an engineers regiment and other attendant services. The first Corps commander was Lt. General Konstantinos Kallaris, who had commanded the 2nd Division during the Balkan Wars. I Corps remained loyal to the royal government during National Schism, and was demobilized after the Noemvriana. After Greece's entry in World War I in June 1917, the Corps was reformed and participated in the Macedonian Front operations in 1917‚Äì1918, fighting against the Bulgarians on the Struma front in eastern Macedonia. It subsequently dispatched the major part of its force (2nd and 13th Divisions under Major Gen. Konstantinos Nider) to the Crimea and the Ukraine, as part of the unsuccessful Allied intervention in the Ukraine. 1st Division was tasked with the occupation of Smyrna and the Erythrae peninsula, and then formed part of the Army of Asia Minor along with the rest of I Corps, evacuated from Russia in late 1919. I Corps then participated in the battles of the Asia Minor Campaign until the final Greek defeat and evacuation in August‚ÄìSeptember 1922. During the Interwar years, I Corps, still at Athens, comprised the 2nd Infantry Division (Athens), 3rd Infantry Division (Patras), and 4th Infantry Division (Nauplia). The corps was a mainly reserve formation, covering southern Greece while the majority of the Greek army was concentrated in Macedonia and Thrace against Bulgaria. Following the outbreak of the Greco- Italian War in October 1940, the corps was mobilized and sent to the Albanian front under its commander, Lt. Gen. Panagiotis Demestichas. The Corps was demobilized and disbanded in April 1941, following the German invasion of Greece. I Corps was re-established on 16 May 1946 as part of the post-war reconstruction of the Greek armed forces, and comprised the 2nd Infantry Division, the 51st and 61st Brigades, and later the 81st Military Region (Corinth), the 82nd Mil. Region (Athens) and the Lamia Military Command. With the outbreak of the Greek Civil War, the corps was engaged in combat against the Communist-led Democratic Army of Greece. Under the command of Lt. Gen. Thrasyvoulos Tsakalotos, it played a major role in clearing southern Greece of the guerrillas and then in the final defeat of the Communists in the battles of Grammos and Vitsi in 1948‚Äì1949. Following the end of the civil war, I Corps, since 1951 based at Trikala, was also responsible for the recruitment of the Greek Expeditionary Force in Korea. In 1962, the corps headquarters was moved to Kozani, where it remained until its disbandment. Following a wide- ranging defence review that decided upon a new force structure for the Greek armed forces, in April 2013 KYSEA decided the disbandment of I Army Corps. From its component units, 24th Armored Brigade came under 2nd Mechanized Infantry Division, the 15th Infantry Brigade was reduced to regimental level, the 8th Infantry Division was reduced to a brigade‚Äîwhile retaining its former name‚Äîand along with the 9th Infantry Brigade came under III Army Corps.

Kwa≈õniewski, Podania Dolno≈õlƒÖskie, Wroc≈Çaw 1999, s. 136, As a mining center the settlement received several privileges and was seat of a w√≥jt since 1368. It remained part of the Polish Duchy of ≈öwidnica and Jawor until 1392, afterwards it was part of the Bohemian Crown. Since 1401 the village belonged to the possessions of the Schaffgotsch family. An accord with neighbouring Hirschberg (Jelenia G√≥ra) in 1454 elevated the settlement above the status of a village, it wasn't until 1513 however that Casper Schaffgotsch acquired the municipal law from Bohemian king Vladislaus II against the opposition of Hirschberg. Mining flourished until the Thirty Years' War, when the town was destroyed in 1633. The main export partner was Poland, with record trade in 1558, it was also famous for its gunsmiths, with Polish king Sigismund II Augustus ordering 2000 gun barrels (later German publications claimed it was only 200).Theodor Eisenm√§nger, Geschichte der Stadt Schmiedeberg im Riesengebirge, Verlag May Woywod, Breslau, 1900, p.31 After the war veil weaving became more and more important for the town, whereas mining diminished. In the early 18th century the town became one of the biggest veil trading places in Silesia with trade relations to Bohemia, Italy, Spain, Russia and North America. Schmiedeberg remained in possession of the Schaffgotsch family until 1634. In the 16th century the population adopted the Protestant faith. Hans Ulrich von Schaffgotsch was arrested as a follower of Albrecht Wallenstein the town came under Imperial custody. In 1639 the emperor sold the town to Bohemian count He≈ôman of Czernin and his family kept Schmiedeberg until Prussian takeover of Silesia. After the Peace of Westphalia (1648) the town experienced Counter-Reformation. The Protestants could now practice their faith only at the church of peace in Jawor and later in Hirschberg and Kamienna G√≥ra (then Landeshut). 19th-century view of the Nowy Dw√≥r Palace When Prussia annexed majority of Silesia in 1742, Prussian king Frederick II immediately sold the possessions to the town, which thereby became sovereign. Prussian conquering also meant a relief for local Protestants ‚Äì they received their own church (Bethaus). Nevertheless, an economic decline followed. Aid by the Prussian king, the settling of Saxon damask weavers, couldn't stop the downturn. Only the Industrialisation, beginning around 1850, led to a recovery of the local economy. In 1882 the town received a rail connection to Hirschberg, which further strengthened the economy. From 1871 to 1945 it was part of Germany, however, in the 19th century the Polish magnate Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç and Czartoryski families were in possession of the Ciszyca Palace and Park in the northern part of today's Kowary.

History The IV Army Corps was established by Royal Decree on 23 December 1913 (O.S.) at Kavala, Eastern Macedonia, during the reorganization of the Hellenic Army following the Balkan Wars. When Eastern Macedonia was occupied by Bulgarian and German forces during World War I, the entire Corps, under its commander Col.

During the Greco- Turkish War it was renamed the Army of Thrace and was stationed in Adrianople. In 1922, after the defeat of the Hellenic forces in Asia Minor, it covered the withdrawal of many units to Thrace, and formed part of the Army of Evros. In November 1940, during the Greco-Italian War, it was renamed again as Eastern Macedonia Army Section (Œ§Œ£ŒëŒú) joining the rest of the army which was fighting in Albania.

It is the seat of the administrative district (gmina) called Gmina Mirsk, close to the Czech border. The town is situated on the upper Kwisa river north of the Jizera Mountains, approximately south-west of Lw√≥wek ≈ölƒÖski, and west of the regional capital Wroc≈Çaw, within the historic region of Lower Silesia. As of 2019, the town has a population of 3,886. History The settlement arose in the 13th century where the medieval trade route from Jelenia G√≥ra to Zittau crossed the border with Upper Lusatia. As a result of the fragmentation of Poland, in 1319 it became part the small Piast- ruled Duchy of Jawor. In the course of the German Ostsiedlung, it received town privileges by the Duke Henry I of Jawor in 1337 (according to other sources in 1329). Upon the death of his successor Duke Bolko II the Small in 1368, it passed to the Bohemian Crown and was enfeoffed to the noble House of Schaffgotsch in 1425. In 1431 it was successfully defended against the Hussites. An annual fair took place in the town from 1521. During the Thirty Years' War, troops from various countries plundered the town as many as 31 times. With most of Silesia, it was annexed as Friedeberg by Prussia in 1742 and incorporated into the Silesia Province. In 1938, part of the village of Skarbk√≥w was merged with the town. During World War II the Germans created a branch of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp for Jewish women in Skarbk√≥w. After the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II, the border changes demanded by the Soviet Union at the Potsdam Conference placed the town in Polish territory.

The film explores themes of human relationships and mental illness. A mix of sex and suspense, the film opened to controversy over its content and to negative reviews. Plot Bobby Grady is an ordinary middle-class electronics store owner who occasionally moonlights doing surveillance work. He attends a group therapy session because his wife, Amy, has lost interest in sex and he fears their marriage is in trouble. Grady is soon approached by the owner of a fashion design house to spy on an employee, Joanna Crane, who is suspected of selling clothing patterns to his competitors. Grady discovers the accusations are unfounded, but also learns that Joanna is moonlighting as a prostitute under the name China Blue, and shedding her business attire for provocative clothing and a platinum wig. Grady keeps quiet about Joanna's double life. Following a sexual encounter with her in her China Blue persona, Grady begins seeing her on a regular basis, first professionally, then romantically. However, their involvement is complicated by his guilt and her intimacy issues‚Äîin addition to her clientele of regular patrons and their bizarre sexual fetishes. Among them is the \\"Reverend\\" Peter Shayne, who alternately spends his time delivering soapbox sermons on the street, visiting peep shows while sniffing amyl nitrite, and patronizing prostitutes. Shayne has been seeing China Blue as a customer and declares a misguided need to \\"save\\" her. (When he says, \\"Save your soul, whore!\\", she replies, \\"Save your money, shithead.\\") Underscoring Shayne's contradictory nature is the cache of sex toys he carries in a small doctor's bag with his Bible. Grady admits he may leave his wife and children, but Joanna feels put-upon and depressed. She seeks solace in turning tricks because the encounters are not fraught with emotional entanglements. She dominates a young policeman in an S&M; session, penetrating him with his nightstick, and endures a botched threesome in a limousine. A session with a dying man whose wife wants China Blue to give him sexual gratification one last time inspires Joanna to reveal her real first name, suggesting for the first time that she is the proverbial \\"hooker with a heart of gold\\". Shayne grows increasingly psychotic: he carries a sharpened metallic vibrator he nicknames \\"Superman\\" and starts stalking Joanna. He moves into a seedy motel next door to her nighttime place of business and watches her activities through a peephole. He also sets up a shrine with candles and numerous photos of her. Sensing that he is mentally unhinged, Joanna no longer wishes to see him, but Shayne follows her home to her actual apartment. Once there, he begs her to kill him. Grady comes there to tell Joanna that he has left home. He hears shouting from her apartment, breaks down her door and finds someone he assumes is Joanna, cowering in terror, not realizing it is actually Shayne in her China Blue disguise. Joanna, now wearing Shayne's clothing, leaps from the shadows and stabs Shayne with the \\"Superman\\" vibrator before he can attack Grady with a large pair of scissors. Shayne dies, convinced that his sacrifice has \\"saved\\" them both. The film ends with Grady addressing his group therapist about his new relationship with a woman named Joanna. Cast * Kathleen Turner as Joanna Crane / China Blue * Anthony Perkins as Reverend Peter Shayne * John Laughlin as Bobby Grady * Annie Potts as Amy Grady * Bruce Davison as Donny Hopper * Yvonne McCord as Sheila * Stephen Lee as Jerry * Louise Sorel as Claudia Production=Script The film was based on an original script by Barry Sandler. Sandler started writing it in the late 1970s. > I was tapping into what was going on around me during the eighties, it was > just at the beginning of the advent of the AIDS crisis‚Ä¶ people had > difficulties with their relationships, there was a lot of sex going on and > it was very easily accessible and a lot of people were using it as kind of > an excuse or a defence or a rationale or some way to avoid intimacy, to > avoid relationships. Sandler said he did \\"about forty drafts\\" of the script before Ken Russell saw it. It began as a two character piece of China Blue and Shayne, with Shayne masquerading as a psychiatrist, and China Blue as a single woman who was very sexually compulsive. He introduced the Grady character who became more prominent and Joanna became a prostitute. Sander had meetings with John Frankenheimer, Bob Rafelson and John Carpenter, as well as Cher, but had trouble getting finance because of the film's content. Ken Russell Sandler's agent suggested he send the film to Russell. \\"They knew it was a very risky, very daring project\\", said the writer. \\"And let's face it, you couldn't get more of a risky and audacious filmmaker than Ken Russell!\\" Russell says the script \\"offered something new in dealing with sex and family life and the masks we accept. It's a powerful subject, and I was quite taken with it, especially when I saw it dealt with these religious hucksters on tv. I know I was obsessed with these terrible preachers.\\" Russell called it a \\"film about the exploitation of women, especially at the hands of the macho American male... Americans are asked to live in a world of complete fantasy which they can never live up to.\\" Although Altered States was a financial success Russell had found difficulty making his next film. One project, Beethoven's Secret was about to start shooting when financing fell apart at the last minute. He was attached to do the film of Evita for over a year, but ultimately left the project when he refused to cast Elaine Paige in the lead. A biopic of Maria Callas with Sophia Loren also failed to get financing. However Russell found himself artistically rejuvenated when offered the chance to direct some opera. He did The Rake's Progress, Soldiers and Butterfly. Sandler says Russell \\"was very reluctant to get involved with another American film after the experience he had with (Paddy) Chayefsky on ‚ÄòAltered States'. He didn't want to risk losing control. Apparently, he had turned down a lot of projects, but there was something about Crimes that connected with him. We talked about it, we had a great relationship that extended for years up until his death.\\" With Russell attached, Sandler took the film to New World Pictures. They had a new head of production, Jonathan Axelrod who wanted to move the company \\"into a more sophisticated area\\" and they agreed to finance in association with Orion Pictures. Casting The male lead was given to Tony Perkins. \\"It's a marvelous role\\", said Perkins, \\"unlike anything I've ever done.\\" Russell had an excellent working relationship with Sandler. Sandler says the biggest change to the script came with the character of Shayne. Originally he was written as a psychiatrist but Anthony Perkins had just played a psychiatrist on Broadway in Equus and did not want to play another psychiatrist. Russell came up with the idea of making him a reverend. Kathleen Turner had read the script and wanted to do the film, over the advice of her agent, because she wanted to break away from her image in Romancing the Stone. Sandler says Jeff Bridges read the script and wanted to do the role of Grady, dropping his price from $3 million to $1 million, but the film could not afford him. Patrick Swayze and Alec Baldwin auditioned but it was decided to go with John Laughlin. \\"He was this guy plucked out of nowhere, so I think he felt a little uneasy and nervous, but it kind of worked for the character\\", said Sandler. \\"He sort of saw that in him and actually pushed his buttons in that direction because he thought it worked for the character, who was very uncomfortable and uneasy and all that.\\" Filming Filming started April 1984. The film was shot at Zoetrope Studios with a mostly non union crew. Rock musician Rick Wakeman performed the synthesizer-heavy score, the majority of which is made up of melodies directly lifted from Czech composer Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k's \\"New World Symphony\\". Wakeman has an uncredited role in the film as a wedding photographer. Sandler says Russell \\"was most intrigued by the China Blue/Shayne scenes. The scenes with Kathleen and Tony. And that kind of high- pitched almost surreal interplay fascinated him, dealing with themes of masks and facades, illusions and deceptions, with these two outrageous characters going at each other. He was less intrigued with the other aspect of the film which was the Grady home life.\\" Perkins loved working with Russell. \\"You spend so much of your career working with directors who just don't want to bother listening to your ideas. It's wonderful to find a man like Ken who not only listens but actively encourages you to come up with your thoughts.\\" Turner says she felt \\"really good\\" about the film \\"because I feel that was really brave, and I was risking a lot there ‚Äì in an acting sense. I was satisfied with that. I think that's some of my best work. I don't think the film is as good as it could have been, but I'm very proud of my work in it. Ken made me brave. Ken Russell. And my agent was encouraging. Plus I was feeling a little rebellious around that time. I saw public popularity as a kind of entrapment, and I wanted some danger. I didn't want to get trapped in fulfilling people's conceptions of me over and over again. I felt pressure and I wanted to break out.\\" Turner wrote in her memoirs that shooting was made difficult by Perkins' drug problem and Russell's heavy drinking. Russell marriage At the film's wrap party aboard the Queen Mary on Long Beach, Russell married his longtime companion, Vivian Jolly. The ceremony was officiated by Anthony Perkins, who was an ordained minister with the Universal Life Church. Perkins said Russell was the one who suggested it. \\"I thought he was kidding\\", said Perkins. \\"But then it turned out he'd done some research and discovered that if we paid $25 I could become a member of the Universal Life Church and would be eligible to marry them.\\" \\"It's an extraordinary film\\", said Perkins. \\"And it will jolt people. Even now that it's trimmed, I expect it will offend some people. Ken Russell's films usually do. But it's adventurous filmmaking of the best kind. And that's what people want, isn't it? Too often recently, delicate subjects have been tackled so timidly that they've found no audience at all. I'm glad it's turned out to be controversial. People will either love it or hate it. And that's what you need if you want people to come and see your film today. Even raves from the critics no longer guarantee you an audience. A film has to be talked about. And this one will be.\\" Rating controversy The film was given an X rating. Russell re-cut it and re-submitted it hoping for an R, but was unsuccessful. New World refused to release it unless it was rated R, so Russell was asked to cut it a third time. \\"I just don't see an end to it\\", said Russell. \\"All we have left is two children drinking orange juice at breakfast.\\" Sandler said, \\"In the purest sense, it's justified ‚Äì you can do anything you want to in your movie, as long as you're willing to go with an X rating. Then you have to face the fact that no distributor wants an X. Or that you won't be able to get advertising in many newspapers. Or that you won't be able to get air time on most TV and radio stations. Some time in the last 10 years, an X rating became an automatic stamp of pornography.\\" Sandler says the head of the ratings board contacted him and suggested they release the film as an X and reclaim that rating. \\"Because we had Ken Russell and Kathleen Turner and Tony in a legitimate film, they thought we could re-legitimise the X rating. But the studio didn't want to hear it, so they made us cut the film.\\" Russell added to do further cuts \\"would do the film I was commissioned to do irreparable harm. The only thing one can do is make a stand and avoid being steamrolled. Even if you're squashed flat, it's better than conning the public with something you don't believe in.\\" Robert Rehme head of New World admitted further cuts \\"probably would hurt the picture\\" but felt it would not affect its box office fortunes. Once Russell heard the changes New World were going to make regardless, he agreed to make further cuts and the film got an R. Sandler said, \\"We kept cutting a little more each time and, by the fifth round of cuts, I think they were all so beaten down from looking at the thing and from pressure from the press and elsewhere that they finally went with an R.\\" Russell said the cuts he did were of \\"a sex shadow show on a wall and a rather climactic scene of sado-masochistic bent, also a scene where China Blue cracks, and several scenes of erotic art that are her mental reactions to what's happening to her. I would think the film in its present form loses some of the motivations. Some of what China Blue does must now seem arbitrary.\\" One scene that was cut in its entirety was one where Turner takes a cop home and they get involved with a nightstick. Sandler says when they previewed the film \\"people were intensely upset by that scene... It was clear that, had we kept it in, it would have made a lot of people extremely uncomfortable.\\" Brian De Palma said he thought the film \\"was affected deeply by the cuts that were made in it. You're dealing with a major film artist here. You're not dealing with some guy shooting pornography in a back room somewhere.\\" Reception=Critical As of July 2018, Crimes of Passion holds a rating of 36% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 11 reviews.http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/crimes_of_passion/ Janet Maslin of The New York Times said \\"Ken Russell's films have never lacked exuberance or humor, which makes the flat, joyless tone of Crimes of Passion a surprise. Much of this is attributable to a screenplay... filled with smutty double- entendres and weighty ironies. Only intermittently does Mr. Russell break through with the kind of manic flamboyance that is so singularly and rudely his own.\\" Perkins later said \\"there are great moments in that film that could only come from a genius. He was on to something about the nature of religion and evil that few people could ever find. Yet, it was, in the end, a bit of a disappointment because it had no plot. . . no story. The images were great, but there was nothing to hang them on.\\" Box office The film was a minor success in theatres. However, it was successful on video, making over $4 million. Lawsuit In 1986 Russell went to court against New World seeking more than $1 million in damages. He said he had an agreement to direct the film for $578,514 and 20 per cent of the profits. He was paid $68,514 during the production and for the company to retain $500,000 as Russell's investment in the picture. Russell received a payout but says after the lawyers and his agent took a cut \\"it wasn't worth the aggro\\".

This movie is McDonagh's debut feature-length movie. The film stars Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson as two Irish hitmen in hiding, with Ralph Fiennes as their enraged boss. The film is set and was filmed in Bruges, Belgium. In Bruges was the opening night film of the 2008 Sundance Film Festival and opened in limited release in the United States on 8 February 2008. The film earned Farrell the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor ‚Äì Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, while Gleeson was nominated in the same category. McDonagh won the BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. Plot Carrying out orders, rookie hitman Ray shoots a priest during confession, but accidentally kills a young boy who is also in church. He and his mentor Ken are sent to Bruges by their employer Harry, where they are to await further instructions. Ken finds the city charming and quaint, while Ray has nothing but contempt for it. They chance upon a film shoot involving a dwarf actor, which amuses Ray. Ray is attracted to Chlo√´, a local drug dealer moonlighting as a production assistant. He takes her to a restaurant, where he gets into an argument with a Canadian couple (mistaking them for Americans) and ends up knocking them unconscious. Chlo√´ takes Ray to her apartment where they begin to have sex, but her ex-boyfriend Eirik appears and threatens Ray with a handgun. Ray disarms him and fires the gun, loaded with blanks, in Eirik's face, blinding him in one eye. Chlo√´ admits that she and Eirik rob tourists, but insists she had told Eirik that Ray was not a target. Ray and Ken spend a debauched night with the dwarf actor, Jimmy, who takes cocaine and rants about a coming war between blacks and whites. Harry calls Ken and orders him to kill Ray, on the principle that killing a child, even accidentally, is unforgivable. With a handgun supplied by Harry's local contact Yuri, Ken tracks Ray to a park and reluctantly prepares to kill him. Ray, however, distraught at his killing of the boy, prepares to kill himself with Eirik's loaded gun. Seeing this, Ken stops Ray, informs him of Harry's order and tells him to leave Bruges to make a new start elsewhere. He gives Ray some money and puts him on a train to another city, while confiscating his gun to prevent a further suicide attempt. Ken reports the truth back to Harry, who immediately sets out for Bruges, enraged at the disobedience. He picks up a gun at Yuri's, and Eirik, Yuri's son, learns of his intention. On the train, Ray is identified by the Canadian couple he assaulted in the restaurant and is escorted by the police back to Bruges. Chlo√´ bails him out and the two share a drink on the market square beneath the Belfry of Bruges. Harry arrives in Bruges and rushes through the streets towards Ray's hotel, but spots Ken sitting outside a cafe. As the two have a drink, Harry boasts that if he himself had killed a child, he would have immediately taken his own life. Ken argues that Ray has the capacity to change and deserves a chance at redemption. Harry is unconvinced, so Ken suggests they ascend the bell tower. At the top, Harry pulls his handgun on Ken, but Ken refuses to resist. Confused, Harry cannot bring himself to kill Ken, so he shoots him in the leg as punishment for not killing Ray. Seeing Ray at the square, Eirik climbs the tower to inform Harry, who is helping Ken down the tower. Ken tries to disarm Harry, who shoots him in the neck and rushes down. Bleeding heavily, Ken drags himself back to the top of the tower and jumps into the square. Ray rushes to Ken's mangled body and learns of Harry's arrival. Just before he dies, Ken tells him to take his gun, but it has been broken in the fall. Harry chases Ray to the hotel; Marie, the pregnant owner, refuses Harry entry, even when he draws his gun. To protect the owner and her unborn child, Harry and Ray agree to continue the chase on the canal and Ray armed with Eirik's loaded gun, jumps on to a passing barge but loses the gun. Harry wounds Ray with a shot from a distance. Ray staggers onto the street where Jimmy's film is shooting. Harry catches up and repeatedly shoots Ray until he collapses. One of the bullets hits Jimmy (costumed as a schoolboy), blowing his head apart. Harry believes he has killed a child and, despite protest from Ray, kills himself. Ray is carried past Chlo√´, Marie and Eirik into an ambulance. In narration, Ray reflects on the nature of hell, speculating that it is an eternity in the city of Bruges, and declares that he really hoped he wouldn't die.

The film also contains many references to the 1973 Nicolas Roeg film Don't Look Now, including the claim by Chlo√´ that the film-within-a-film is almost an homage to it.

Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 84%, based on 198 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \\"Featuring witty dialogue and deft performances, In Bruges is an effective mix of dark comedy and crime thriller elements.\\" Metacritic gives the film an average score of 67 out of 100, based on 34 critics, which indicates \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars, saying \\"This film debut by the theater writer and director Martin McDonagh is an endlessly surprising, very dark, human comedy, with a plot that cannot be foreseen but only relished.\\" Tasha Robinson of The A.V. Club gave the film an \\"A‚àí\\", praising the performances of the main cast: \\"Farrell, having successfully made the transition from overexposed-yet-underutilized action- thriller star to one-film-a-year artiste, gets a lot to work with, and he sells it all flawlessly, moving convincingly from offhanded, prickly asshole mode to nervous young lover to disintegrating martyr,\\" and that \\"then again, all the leads are perfectly cast, and they help turn a light farce with thriller overtones into something deeper and sweeter.\\" About the film itself, she added: \\"When it's funny, it's hilarious; when it's serious, it's powerful; and either way, it's an endless pleasant surprise.\\" Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film three and a half stars out of four and praised the two leads, stating that \\"Brendan Gleeson is brilliant as Ken ‚Ä¶ along with his partner in crime, Ray, played by Colin Farrell in probably his best performance.\\" About the film, she added that it's \\"sharply written, superbly acted, funny and even occasionally touching.\\" Damon Wise of Empire magazine gave the film four out of five stars, writing that \\"with In Bruges, the British gangster movie gets a Croydon facelift. It may not be new, but it's a wonderfully fresh take on a familiar genre: fucked-up, far-out and very, very funny.\\" John Anderson of The Washington Post gave the film a positive review, writing that \\"those who know McDonagh's work know a vein of darkness will run deeply through the comedy. It has seldom been darker. Or funnier. He has made a hit-man movie in which you don't know what will happen and can't wait to find out. Every movie should be so clich√©d.\\" Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle also gave the film a positive review; he praised Farrell's performance, stating that \\"in the past few months, with Cassandra's Dream and now this, we've found out something about Farrell. He's not a matinee idol, and he's not a suave or heroic leading man. He's a terrific character actor, and he can go to low places that suave heroes can't risk, like anguish, self-hatred, embarrassment, utter confusion and buffoonery.\\" About the film, he added that it's \\"witty and lively, with a soul to it, as well.\\" Dana Stevens of Slate magazine also praised the performances of the two leads: \\"Farrell, who just played a remarkably similar tortured killer for hire in Woody Allen's Cassandra's Dream, finds just the right tone for this twitchy, funny, emotionally volatile thug; for once, he seems to know exactly what movie he's in. So does Brendan Gleeson, the big, shambling, sad-eyed Irish actor known to American audiences mainly for his role in the last two Harry Potter movies.\\" She continued about the film: \\"A jolly mess of a movie. Overplotted, choppy, and contrived, it nonetheless has a curious vitality that makes you wonder where McDonagh will go next.\\" James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, writing that \\"the acting is top-notch. Colin Farrell, who seems to be gravitating increasingly toward smaller films, effectively channels his manic energy. He and Brendan Gleeson display chemistry in the Odd Couple vein, occasionally giving rise to instances of humor. Ralph Fiennes plays one of the most twisted roles of his career.\\" Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a \\"C+\\", indicating a mixed review; she praised McDonagh's directing, stating that \\"he's a specialist in constructing satisfying, live- wire dramas of violence that crash up against despair, in upending his characters' miseries with moments of twisted humor, and in sustaining a writing voice that roars with a particularly Irish robustness of obscenity.\\" She also added that \\"neither star is sloppy, but both are loose and mellow‚Äîa couple of pros who know they're the whole show.\\" Ella Taylor of Village Voice also gave the film a mixed review, stating that \\"Bruges may be the movie's rather too-long-running joke, but Farrell's shaggy brow is easily the most entertaining thing in Irish playwright Martin McDonagh's first foray into the crime caper.\\" Accolades In Bruges was nominated for seven awards by the British Independent Film Awards, including the Douglas Hickox Award (Debut Director), Best Performance by an Actor in a British Independent Film and Best Screenplay, the latter of which it won. It was also nominated for two Satellite Awards: for Best Actor (Brendan Gleeson) and Best Film.

A Liberal politician, and leader of the ALAS-Team Colombia political movement, he was arrested and jailed in 2007 for participating in parapolitics. Prior to serving in the Senate, he was also a Member of the Chamber of Representatives of Colombia from 1994 to 2001. Career After graduating as Economist from the Externado University in Bogot√°, 27-year-old Ara√∫jo ran for the Chamber of Representatives, representing the Liberal Party and was elected. Two years later, along with his father, he founded a dissident political movement called Alternative for Social Advance (ALAS). After his second term in the Chamber, he ran for the Senate receiving more than half of his votes from the department of Cesar and Bogot√°, where he got the highest vote for someone from the Caribbean Region. His movement supported √Ålvaro Uribe for the Presidency of Colombia. Flyer of √Ålvaro Ara√∫jo for the senate. The voter turnout in the Cesar raised suspicion, because of the influence of paramilitary forces in the area. In May 2005, Semana published an article revealing a possible plan by paramilitary forces to influence elections. The Department of Cesar was divided into two zones, the G-8, formed by 8 municipalities in central Cesar Department where revenues from mining industry are high, and in which Senator Mauricio Pimiento and Representative Jorge Enrique Ram√≠rez got most of their votes, and the G-11, formed mostly by southern municipalities where Representative Miguel Duran Gelvis and Senator Ara√∫jo had a high turnout. Ara√∫jo responded to these accusations by citing years of hard work politics and his family's influence in the region. He also pointed out that results, like the ones in Tamalameque where he received more than 70% of the total votes, were easily explained because of the influence of his third runner-up, Ricardo Chaj√≠n Flori√°n, who had been Mayor of Tamalameque. In the Senate, Ara√∫jo was a member of the Fifth Commission of the Senate in which he promoted Hydrocarbon projects and proposed the Mines Code which is cited for duplicating the production of coal in Colombia. He was also a proponent of equal ownership rights for gay couples, and integrating demobilized members of the Cacique Nutibara Bloc into the Armed Forces of Colombia if they met certain judicial requisites. He was temporarily replaced in the Senate from 17 August 2004 to 17 February 2005 by Ricardo Chaj√≠n Flori√°n, the third-runner up in his list. Parapolitica scandal On January 19, 2006 Ara√∫jo was first accused by then candidate for Senate Gustavo Petro, of having ties with paramilitary groups headed by the now demobilized paramilitary leader Jorge 40 and his men. The Supreme Court of Colombia investigated the accusations in what became known as the Parapolitics scandal, as a result, on 16 February 2007, Ara√∫jo was arrested along with other senators for having ties to illegal paramilitary groups. Accomplice in kidnapping Arising from his investigation in parapolitics, Ara√∫jo was also formally accused of the kidnapping and extortion of former Mayor of Valledupar, El√≠as Ochoa Daza's brother V√≠ctor. He was found guilty of the charges and sentenced to 9 years and 3 months of prison on March 18, 2010.

The brigade was established after the reorganization of the 71st Infantry Brigade to an air assault formation. Members of the Brigade wear the red beret. It is a part of the NATO Response Force (NRF) and of the HELBROC BG.  History  The 71st Infantry Regiment was established in Drama on 28 October 1940 and took part in World War II along the borders of Bulgaria. During the German invasion in 1941 the regiment was based in the sector of Paranesti, where it won numerous engagements against German forces. When the Axis occupied the country, the Regiment was dissolved. It was reformed on 24 April 1945, after Greece was liberated. In August, 1989 the 71st Infantry Regiment moved to the village of Nea Santa in Kilkis under the 1st Infantry Division. On August 1993 was reorganized to Brigade with full activation on 1 January 1995. From 1 Jan 1998 was placed under B CORPS as a Rapid Reaction Force.

G√•sgr√§nd (Swedish: \\"Goose Alley\\") is an alley in Gamla stan, the old town in central Stockholm, Sweden. Connecting the streets V√§sterl√•nggatan, Stora Nygatan, and Lilla Nygatan, it forms a parallel street to Ignatiigr√§nd and √ñversk√§rargr√§nd, and leads down to the square Munkbron on the western waterfront of the old town.

It is mentioned in 1492 as Gragasenne grendh and referred to a few years later as nest nordan hwstrv Ragnil Gragossenne gardh (\\"next north of wife Ragnil Gragossenne's homestead\\"). In 1513, a Gragasene grend is mentioned as is an old house Ragnil Gragas geffuit hade j testament (\\"...given had in [the] testament\\").

Marilyn Singer Photo by Sonya Sones Biography Marilyn Singer was born in the Bronx, New York City on October 3, 1948 and lived most of her early life in North Massapequa (Long Island), NY. She attended Queens College, City University of New York, and for her junior year, the University of Reading, England. She holds a B.A. in English from Queens College and an M.A. in Communications from New York University. In 1974, after teaching English in New York City high schools for several years, Marilyn began to write ‚Äì initially film notes, catalogues, teacher's guides and film strips. Then, one day, when she was sitting in the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, Marilyn penned a story featuring talking insect characters she'd made up when she was eight. Encouraged by the responses she got, Marilyn wrote more stories and in 1976 her first book, The Dog Who Insisted He Wasn't, was published by E. P. Dutton. Since then, Marilyn has published over one hundred books for children and young adults. Her genres are many and varied, including realistic novels, fantasies, non-fiction, fairy tales, picture books, mysteries and poetry. Marilyn Singer lives in Park Slope, Brooklyn, New York.

In April 2004, Fallujah was under siege by United States Marines, and insurgents were looking to relieve pressure on the city by attempting an offensive of their own. Ten days before, the highway connecting Al Anbar to Baghdad was cut and the insurgents attacked the capital of the province, Ramadi. The attack was repulsed by the Marines and the battle resulted in heavy casualties on both sides. Now the insurgents were ready for another attack which would serve as third location attacked in a simultaneous assault against U.S. forces, on the city of Husaybah on the Syrian border. Infantry elements of 3rd Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment Lima Company, 2 platoons from Kilo Company and CAAT (Combined Anti-armor team) White, were deployed to Husaybah to counter the enemy offensive. The battle An estimated 600 Iraqis from Fallujah and Ramadi launched an assault against the Americans in Husaybah. The insurgents engaged the Marines on the outskirts of the city first with a roadside bombing and a continuous barrage from mortar positions. The Iraqis forces followed up the bombing with heavy small-arms and machine-gun fire near a former Ba'ath Party headquarters. The Marines engaged the enemy for several hours before additional reinforcements were dispatched to assist the outnumbered Marine positions. The reinforcing platoons were also hit as they were entering the city. Very soon heavy street fighting ensued which lasted the entire day. The Marines had to clear two-story buildings block by block. Most of the fighting was centered along a street in the northern part of the town which the Marines called \\"East End Street\\". Insurgents were on both sides of the street and were constantly laying down fire at the Marines. The fighting slowed a bit after the Marines cleared a house used by the insurgents as a stronghold which they later nicknamed \\"The Crack House\\", but fighting continued late into the night. Unfortunately, in addition to the heavy casualties suffered by the U.S. Marines, Lima Company's Commander, Major Gannon, was killed in action during the battle. While attempting to link up with Weapons Platoon (Lima Company), Major Gannon entered an area that was occupied by enemy insurgents and was killed. The U.S base in Husaybah was renamed Camp Gannon in his honor. url=http://www.marines.mil/marinelink/mcn2000.nsf/lookupstoryref/20049209463 title=Marines Recount Fierce Battle url-status=dead archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930203529/http://www.marines.mil/marinelink/mcn2000.nsf/lookupstoryref/20049209463 archivedate=2007-09-30 }} Aftermath Seven Marines were killed along with 270 insurgents in the fierce battle that lasted 14 hours.

He currently hosts This is America & The World with Dennis Wholey, an interview program shown throughout the U.S. on public television stations and distributed worldwide on Voice of America Television. Life and career The son of an attorney father and a librarian mother, Wholey received a B.A. degree from the Catholic University of America in 1959. He started his media career as a tour guide for NBC in New York City and then became the host of a radio talk show, The Age of Involvement, on WBAI-FM. He also produced and hosted a television talk show on WNDT-TV in New York. In 1969, Wholey moved to WKRC-TV in Cincinnati, where he hosted The Dennis Wholey Show, which was syndicated to stations throughout the midwest, including Taft Broadcasting Company sister station WTVN-TV in Columbus. In 1969 he was the emcee of a short-lived game show, The Generation Gap, on ABC. WTVN-TV advertisement for the Dennis Wholey Show Wholey then became the host of the morning show AM Detroit on WXYZ-TV in Detroit from 1973 to 1977 and a similar show, Morning Break on WDVM-TV in Washington, D.C. in 1977 and 1978. He moved to late night programming with PBS Latenight with Dennis Wholey, an interview show on WTVS- TV in Detroit from 1982 to 1985, which was widely distributed by PBS. He also hosted LateNight America with Dennis Wholey for PBS beginning in 1989.

Radio/TV Mirror magazine named one of Wholey's talk shows an \\"outstanding program\\" in the Midwest, and he received the Golden Mike award from the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) for AM Detroit. In 1984, Wholey began a successful career as an author with his book The Courage to Change: Hope and Help for Alcoholics and Their Families, which sold well and was on the New York Times bestseller list for several months. The book recounted Wholey's own struggles with alcohol and valium addictions, which reached serious proportions during the 1970s before he found help in an alcoholics' support group. The book also included interviews with other recovering alcoholics, including former Congressman Wilbur Mills, rock musician Pete Townshend, Monty Python performer Graham Chapman, and trumpeter Doc Severinsen. Wholey followed The Courage to Change with a book on the sometimes elusive nature of happiness, Are You Happy? Some Answers to the Most Important Question in Your Life (1986). Featuring interviews with such figures as chef Julia Child, reporter Helen Thomas, actress Ruby Dee and critic Cleveland Amory, the book advised active involvement in life and a careful avoidance of self-pity and resentment. Wholey's third book Becoming Your Own Parent: The Solution for Adult Children of Alcoholic and Other Dysfunctional Families (1988) focused on poorly functioning families and included some material on Wholey's own often difficult childhood. Wholey continued in the self-help genre with When the Worst That Can Happen Already Has: Conquering Life's Most Difficult Times (1992) and The Miracle of Change: The Path to Self Discovery and Spiritual Growth (1997). His newest book, published in 2007, is Why Do I Keep Doing That? Why Do I Keep Doing That?: Breaking the Negative Patterns in Your Life, which discusses how to escape counterproductive behavior patterns. Wholey is also the author of a sports fantasy, The Chance of a Lifetime: An Amazing Super Bowl Story.

He was the brother of Yitzhak Kahan, former President of the Supreme Court of Israel. Background Kalman was born in Galicia, an area of the Austro-Hungarian Empire now in modern-day Ukraine. He studied Philosophy, Semitic Languages, History and Pedagogy at Berlin University and W√ºrzburg University, eventually gaining a PhD in Philosophy. He also graduated as a Rabbi from the Hildesheimer Rabbinical Seminary of Berlin, and was also head of the Haredi Students Organization in the city, as well as being a member of the Young Aguda. Kalman immigrated to Mandatory Palestine in 1938, settling in the Kibbutz of Hafetz Haim. After immigrating, he became editor of the Sha'arim newspaper. Political career Shortly after arriving in Palestine, Kahana became involved in politics, joining the secretariat of the Executive Committee of Poalei Agudat Yisrael and the central committee of the international organisation. Eventually, he became president of the federation. His position as head of the largest Ultra-orthodox workers union meant that he became a member of Provisional State Council, and was one of the people to sign Israel's declaration of independence. Kahana was elected to the first Knesset as a member of the United Religious Front, an alliance of Agudat Yisrael, the political wing of Poalei Agudat Yisrael, Mizrachi and Hapoel HaMizrachi. For the 1951 elections, Poalei Agudat Yisrael stood as an independent party, gaining two seats. Kahana headed the faction in the Knesset, and was appointed Deputy Minister of Education and Culture when the party joined David Ben-Gurion's coalition government. The party was involved in bringing down the third government when it disagreed with Ben-Gurion over the need for strengthening religious education. Despite not being a coalition partner in the fourth, fifth and sixth governments, Kahana retained his Deputy Ministerial position. Prior to the 1955 elections, Poalei Agudat Yisrael merged with Agudat Yisrael to form the Religious Torah Front. Kahana was elected to the Knesset on the new list. The parties also ran together in the 1959 elections, but split during the Knesset session. Poalei Agudat Yisrael ran independently in the 1961, 1965 and 1969 elections, with Kahana retaining his seat as head of the party each time. He also regained his position as Deputy Minister of Education and Culture after the 1961 and 1965 elections. The Religious Torah Front was reformed before the 1973 elections, with Kahana winning election on its list, but split again during the session.

He played five seasons in Major League Baseball, for the St. Louis Cardinals and Cincinnati Reds, from 1902 until 1906, primarily as a center fielder. He threw right-handed but batted left- handed. Born in Galestown, Maryland, Smoot was the eldest of the three children of Luke Smoot and Rebecca Wheatley-Smoot. He attended elementary school with Geneva Gordy, who became his wife in 1901. He attended prep school at Wesley Collegiate Academy in Dover, Delaware. He and his wife Geneva had five children ‚Äì two boys and three girls. Smoot attended Washington College in Chestertown, Maryland, where he played both football and baseball. While playing college baseball, he also played semi-professional baseball for multiple teams. He signed his first professional contract in 1900, with the Allentown Peanuts of the Atlantic League. After the Atlantic League folded shortly after his signing, he signed with the Worcester Farmers of the Eastern League. He played the rest of the season with the Farmers, except for a ten- day period in which he played for the Providence Clamdiggers. He again played for Worcester in 1901, hitting .356. Following that season, he was signed by the Cardinals. He made his major league debut on April 17, 1902 at the age of 24. Smoot and teammate George Barclay were the team's power hitters in 1902, hitting three home runs each, combining for six of the team's ten home runs. According to the Society for American Baseball Research, Smoot was the best rookie in 1902. Smoot is also one of the few players to hit two inside-the- park home runs in a single game, which he did on April 25. Although 1903 was not nearly as successful for Smoot as 1902 was, he was still the team's main power hitter, belting four of the team's eight home runs. He also hit a fine .296 that season. In 1904, Smoot's batting average dropped to .281, but he also had career highs of 23 doubles and 66 runs batted in. His 23 stolen bases and 37 walks were also career highs. He was not the team leader in home runs in 1904-in fact, his three home runs trailed behind two players, Dave Brain (seven) and Mike Grady (five). 1905 was perhaps Smoot's best season. Not only did he tie his career high in home runs with four (which tied with Grady for the team lead), he also had career highs in runs (73) and triples (16). His .311 average, which also tied a career high, led the team and was seventh highest in the league. 1906 saw Smoot's career take a rapid turn for the worse. He started the season with the Cardinals, hitting only .248 with them. That prompted a midseason trade with the Reds, who sent Shad Barry in return for Smoot. Although his average rose while with the Reds-he hit .259 with them-that could not save his season or his career. After hitting only .252 combined that season, his major league career was over. He played his final major league game on October 7. After the 1906 season, his contract was sold to the Toledo Mud Hens of the American Association. Multiple explanations have been posed to explain the quick decline in production and from Smoot, and the quick end to his career. One claim is his eyesight became poor, although his obituary says his eyesight remained \\"undimmed\\". His obituary says he was slowed by muscular rheumatism. Luck may have also played a factor, and Smoot was just unlucky and didn't get the chance to play in the majors again. Smoot played three years with Toledo, hitting .312 in 1907, .301 in 1908 and .270 in 1909. He played with the Louisville Colonels and Kansas City Blues-both in the American Association-in 1910, hitting .236 combined. He started 1911 with the Blues, hitting .379 with them before his contract was sold to the Wilkes-Barre Barons of the New York State League. He won his only pro pennant in 1911. He was an assistant manager and weekend player in 1912 for Wilkes-Barre, but the rheumatism got so bad he had to finish his playing days. After his playing days, he became head coach at Washington College for a year. He spent ten years as a chicken farmer and operating a feed business before getting the chance to be involved in professional sports again. In 1925, he was manager of the Salisbury Indians of the Eastern Shore Baseball League. After only one year there, he returned to his feed business. His son, Roger Smoot, signed a professional contract with the Cardinals in 1927. He died at age 50 in Salisbury, Maryland from spinal meningitis. He was inducted into Washington College's Athletic Hall of Fame in 1992. Smoot is the only player ever to have at least 500 at-bats in a season while playing in as many as five seasons. A .953 fielder, he hit .290 with 15 home runs and 269 RBI in his career. He is buried in Galestown Cemetery in Galestown, Maryland.

In June 1526, Moncada was sent by Emperor Charles V, as an ambassador to Pope Clement VII in Rome. Moncada carried a message to the pope that should he ally with the French in the War of the League of Cambrai that Charles V would seek to turn the city-state of Siena in northern Italy against the Papal States and would also use his influence with the Colonna family to also turn this important Italian family against Pope Clement VII.Michael Mallett and Christine Shaw, The Italian Wars: 1494-1559, pp. 156-157.

Early life Rao hailed from Bayyannagudem in Khammam district (currently part of the Telangana state). Career His involvement in politics began when he was in his twenties, when he supported Congress in their campaign of armed defiance against the Nizam of Hyderabad. He was jailed for his involvement in this campaign, which was protesting the tenancy laws operating in the Telangana region. Although he tried and failed to be elected as an independent candidate in 1952, Rao subsequently was elected on four occasions to the Legislative Assembly of Andhra Pradesh, where he represented the Sathupalli constituency of Khammam district. Lok Sabha He was also twice elected to the Lok Sabha  the lower house of the Parliament of India - as a representative of the Khammam district constituency. The first of his successful Assembly elections was in 1962, and the period from 1952 to that time saw him occupying the post of president for the Khammam district branch of Congress and being the first chairman of the district council. As Home Minister In 1968, he became State Home Minister in the state government headed by Kasu Brahmananda Reddy. Later, during his period as Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, an office to which he was appointed by Indira Gandhi and held between 10 December 1973 and 6 March 1978, Rao's hallmark was his administrative efficiency. He is also known for his handling and containment of Naxalite insurgency, which took place during a revival of the Telangana movement that sought independent statehood. He replaced local officers with officers from far away districts so that a nexus between the Naxalites and the police could not be formed. He also introduced rehabilitation measures for the families of slain Naxalites so that they could lead an honourable life and not resort to the path of their forebears. He almost wiped out Naxalism from the state. He improved the lot of the tribals to ensure there were no fresh additions to the cadres. Later, the Vimadlal commission was appointed to probe into attacks on Naxalites during his period in office and his earlier actions against Communist-inspired Naxalites during the 1960s have been referred to as a \\"reign of terror\\". The official website for the government of Andhra Pradesh refers to his Chief Ministership, which came about following a period of President's rule, as a \\"popular ministry ... With this, normalcy returned and the State enjoyed political stability\\". Despite that popularity, he was unable to retain power in the 1978 elections. Congress split When Congress split during the mid-1970s, Rao initially did not join with the faction led by Indira Gandhi that was referred to as Congress (I). However, he did join in 1984 and with his election to the Lok Sabha in that year he served in the cabinet of Rajiv Gandhi, holding the post of Union Minister for Industry until 1989. For much of this period, between 1984 and 1988, he was also president of the state organisation of his political party, being the Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee. As Chief Minister He was the 5th Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh from 10 December 1973 ‚Äì 6 March 1978. It was during his tenure as Chief Minister that three universities namely Kakatiya University, Acharya Nagarjuna University and Sri Krishnadevaraya University were started, catering for three regions of Andhra Pradesh: Telangana, Coastal Andhra, and Rayalaseema. Rao initiated a World Telugu Conference in Hyderabad in 1975. Death Jalagam Vengal Rao died on 12 June 1999. Family He has two sons, Jalagam Prasada Rao and Jalagam Venkat Rao. Jalagam Prasada Rao was a Member of the Legislative Assembly from Satthupalli constituency for two terms and he was a minister in N. Janardhan Reddy's cabinet. He held the portfolios of Small scale industries and Panchayat Raj. Jalagam Venkat Rao, is also a politician and was a Member of the Legislative Assembly of Andhra Pradesh, representing the INC for the same constituency, Satthupalli, as his father. Commemoration Rao wrote an autobiography in the Telugu language, called Naa Jeevitha Katha. The contents caused some controversy with regard to the lives of other politicians.

Once the healthcare proxy is effective, the agent continues making healthcare decisions as long as the primary individual is legally competent to decide. Moreover, in legal-administrative functions, the healthcare proxy is a legal instrument akin to a \\"springing\\" healthcare power of attorney. The proxy must declare the healthcare agent who will gain durable power attorney. This document also notifies of the authority given from the principal to the agent and states the limitations of this authority. Those over the age of 18 are allowed to have a healthcare proxy, and these documents are useful in situations that render a person unable to communicate their wishes such as being in a persistent vegetative state, having a form of dementia of an illness that takes away one's ability to effectively communicate, or being under anesthesia when a decision needs to be made. Healthcare proxies are one of three ways that surrogate decision makers are enacted, the other two being court orders and laws for the automatic succession of decision makers. In contrast to a living will, healthcare proxies do not set out possible outcomes with predetermined reactions, rather they appoint someone to carry out the wishes of an individual.  History  The methods of healthcare planning and tools of advanced preparation have changed dramatically over the years. The concept of durable power of attorney arose in Virginia in 1954 for the purpose of setting property matters. This allowed for a continued existence of power of attorney following the original person losing capacity to carry out the necessary actions. This concept evolved over the years and in 1983, the President's Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research addressed this idea as one of great potential in the healthcare industry. This commission also stated the possibility of abuse as a noted concern going forward. In response to this commission, there was an evolution of this concept throughout the 1980s and the 1990s that eventually led to all states in America having a healthcare power of attorney statute by 1997.  Criteria  Some jurisdictions place limitations on the persons who can act as agents. (Some forbid the appointment of treating physicians as the healthcare proxy.) In any event the agent should be someone close to and trusted by the primary individual. According to the state of Massachusetts, no person who is an employee or administrator of a facility can be an agent unless it is for someone who is of familial relation to them. In any event the agent is recommended to be someone close to and trusted by the primary individual. In the absence of a power of attorney, a legal guardian must be appointed.  Legal guidelines  Healthcare proxies are permitted in forty-nine states as well as the District of Columbia.Health Care Powers of Attorney: Interactive Map, LawServer. Retrieved on August 19, 2014. Healthcare forms may differ in structure from state to state and pre-made forms are not compulsory as long as certain guidelines are met. The common guidelines include: *Name and address of the agent. *Name and address of an alternate agent. *Duration of the proxy ‚Äì not indicating a duration means it is valid unless stated otherwise. *Special instructions ‚Äì these can broaden or limit the powers of the agent. If the patient doesn't want to be on feeding tubes no matter what, this can be stated here. If there are certain treatments that the patient does not want to receive like dialysis or blood transfusion, then they must be indicated. However, if the patient wants to give the agent more flexibility with some or no restriction, this must be written. *Name, date and signature of the primary individual. *Instructions on tissue or organ donation. *Two adult witnesses must sign the document stating that they have witnessed this agreement and that both parties appear to be sane. The witnesses must be 18 years or older. The agent and primary individual do not qualify as witnesses. *Presence of a lawyer - such a person may help in drafting a document tailored to the needs of the primary individual. *Once signed, copies of the form must be given to healthcare providers, the agent, spouse, and close friends. A copy should also be carried by the primary individual (in wallet or purse).  Powers and limitations  The agent is empowered when a qualified physician determines that the primary individual is unable to make decisions regarding healthcare. The agent may be granted the power to remove or sustain feeding tubes from the primary individual if these tubes are the only things that are keeping the primary individual alive. The agent's decision should draw upon knowledge of the patient's desire in this matter. If the primary individual made his or her wishes clear on the proxy form, then they must be followed despite any possible objections from the agent. An individual may have identified end-of- life decisions in a separate document, such as a living will or advanced healthcare directive, in which case it is necessary to examine all of the documents to determine if any supersede the agent's authority as granted in the healthcare proxy, based on the language of the interrelated documents and governing state law. An agent will not be legally or financially liable for decisions made on behalf of the primary individual as long as they follow the terms of the healthcare proxy.  Capacity to appoint  There are limited legal foundation to determine the ability of someone to appoint a healthcare proxy. Although physicians are allowed to deliver life-saving treatment in emergent situations, in non-emergencies, the it is determined if the patient has the ability to then appoint a healthcare proxy. It is possible for a patient lacking the ability to make healthcare decisions, to still have the capacity to appoint an agent and have a proxy.  United Kingdom  In England and Wales, an independent mental health capacity advocate may be appointed under the Mental Capacity Act 2005; the provisions made in the same Act for a lasting power of attorney may also provide a satisfactory basis for providing care via an attorney, who does not require to be professionally qualified.

History Tyler Jet Motorsports was owned by Tim Beverley, owner of the airplane sales company that shared a name with the race team, and was formed in 1998 after Beverley purchased the assets of DarWal, Inc. and ISM Racing and merged them into one team. Tyler Jet's original car was the No. 35 Tabasco Pontiac, which had been ISM's car, and was driven by several drivers (including Darrell Waltrip) before Tabasco pulled out of NASCAR following the 1998 season. In 1999, the team fielded Pontiacs and switched to the No. 45, with sponsorship from the 10-10-345 long distance telephone service. Rich Bickle, (who incidentally, had driven for Darrell Waltrip in the Craftsman Truck Series) was hired as the driver, but was released late in the season, and was replaced by David Green. Green recorded the best finish of his Cup series career, a 12th at Phoenix, and won the only pole in his (and the team's) Cup career, the following weekend at the inaugural Cup series race at Homestead-Miami Speedway. During the team's first two seasons of operations, four drivers and three crew chiefs were hired. For the 2000 season, Tyler Jet switched to the No. 10 and hired Johnny Benson to pilot the car on November 22, 1999. Their first exposure came at the Daytona 500, where Benson's unsponsored Pontiac took the lead late in the race and held the lead for 39 laps, only to be passed by cars that had made full pit stops under a late race caution (Benson was playing strategy, having only stopped for two tires and fuel his last stop) and finish 12th. Lycos signed on as sponsor for the No. 10 and stayed with them until the 2000 Pepsi 400, where Tyler Jet pulled them off the car due to nonpayment; Lycos would eventually sue Tyler Jet on July 16, 2001. They would run unsponsored for the next four races, but Beverley was forced to sell the team afterwards. The car, which had just acquired sponsorship from Aaron's, was sold to MB2 Motorsports on July 20. The team would continue to be based in Tyler Jet's shop located near Lowe's Motor Speedway, and ran until the end of the 2005 season when the car number, sponsor (Valvoline) and driver (Scott Riggs) moved to Evernham Motorsports. The successor team and car were Ginn Racing's No. 14, which was sold to Dale Earnhardt, Inc. and merged into its No. 15 team, which in turn was folded after the merger that created Earnhardt Ganassi Racing.

Old Joseph was one of the first Nez Perc√© converts to Christianity and a vigorous advocate of the tribe's early peace with whites. In 1855 he aided Washington's territorial governor and set up a Nez Perc√© reservation that expanded from Oregon into Idaho. The Nez Perce agreed to give up a section of their tribal lands in return for an assurance whites would not intrude upon the sacred Wallowa Valley. Nevertheless, in 1863, following a gold rush in Nez Perc√© territory, the federal government took back approximately of this land. That confined the Nez Perc√© to a reservation in Idaho, which was only one tenth its previous size. Old Joseph argued that this second treaty was never approved by his people. Feeling deceived, Old Joseph condemned the United States, slashed his American flag, shredded his Bible, and declined to move his band from the Wallowa Valley or to sign the treaty that would make the new reservation boundaries legitimate.

He was briefly listed on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list in 1976.Google News: Beaver County Times - May 26, 1976 Early life Morris Johnson was raised on a small farm outside Tompkinsville, Kentucky until his family moved to 4802 Beecher St. in the Drexel Gardens neighborhood of Indianapolis. Johnson's father Armer Johnson was a factory worker, and his mother Delcie Johnson was a short-order cook. Johnson had six siblings. Robbery Inc. According to Indianapolis media accounts, by the age of 24 (1962) Johnson was the leader of one of the most notorious band of bank bandits since the days of John Dillinger. Also, it was alleged that by 1963 Johnson's gang, dubbed \\"Robbery Inc.\\" by Indianapolis police, had grown to around 100 members and was believed to be responsible for nearly 3,400 crimes between the years 1958 and 1963. Close associates of Johnson have claimed these assessments to be overblown, however. Conviction On April 10, 1963 a jury in Federal court at New Albany, Indiana convicted Johnson of robbing the Merchants National Bank and Trust Co. branch at 3119 English Ave. in Indianapolis of $8,890 in November 1962. Johnson drew an 18-year sentence for this crime and subsequently confessed to nearly 300 other major crimes. Escape On November 10, 1966 Johnson escaped from the Federal Penitentiary in Atlanta, GA with another inmate by piecing together a rickety ladder made of scraps and thereby scaling a 30-foot wall. Only one other inmate had ever escaped this prison, nearly 40 years prior. Almost two months later, Morris and another man robbed the American Fletcher National Bank branch at 2122 East 10th Street for $10,375. They were caught the same day. Johnson plead guilty and was sentenced to another 5 years in prison, plus an additional 3 years for the escape, plus the remainder of his original 15-year sentence. Parole In December 1973 Morris was paroled from McNeil Island Corrections Center. 18 months later, Johnson was arrested in Louisville, KY and charged with robbing a bank in Atlanta in March 1974 and burglarizing a bank in Marietta, GA in April 1974 in which he dug a 135-foot tunnel to enter the bank. He was then sent back to the Atlanta Penitentiary for 15 years. Second escape On Saturday, October 25, 1975 at 9 a.m., Johnson and Solomon K. Allen Jr. scaled the wall to escape the Atlanta Penitentiary. This was Johnson's second escape from this prison, and these escapes were the only two in a 50-year period. Wife's arrest On April 30, 1976, Johnson's wife Laurie Kay Johnson, 34, and Franklin Rance, 39, a longtime associate were arrested when agents raided an apartment in Long Beach, Mississippi in an attempt to capture Morris. Johnson and another man reportedly fled the apartment, exchanging shots with FBI agents and local police. Third escape A year following his escape, Johnson was added to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list on May 25, 1976. In less than a month, acting on an anonymous tip, federal agents captured him in New Orleans on June 26. Johnson then escaped from custody in Selma, Alabama on November 6. An accomplice sent hacksaw blades in the mail to Johnson, and the package had not been checked because it had a return address. Morris and five other prisoners sawed through the bars and fashioned a makeshift rope out of bed sheets to climb down to another part of the jail. On the ground level, they used an electrical cord to activate a device that controlled one door, and they broke a bar on another door to reach the outside. Morris was originally taken to this jail to testify in another trial. Johnson arrived at 2 p.m. that Saturday and escaped at 10 p.m. that same day; he had previously promised to send a message greeting his pursuers and, at Christmas, the judge and prosecutor in his court case as well as one of the FBI agents involved in his arrest received a card from Johnson which stated \\"I do my thing and you do your thing. If we should ever meet again, it's beautiful.\\" Johnson was released in 2019.https://www.bop.gov/mobile/find_inmate/byname.jsp#inmate_results Star Man award In 1976 Morris Johnson was nominated for the 1976 Indianapolis Star Man of the Year honor and was cited for \\"his initiative, intelligence and perseverance in dealing with the problems of prison security in our nation.\\" Recapture Morris was recaptured on May 11, 1977 in Burnsville, Minnesota and was incarcerated at the Federal Prison in Lexington, KY. He was released in 2019.  See also  * List of fugitives from justice who disappeared ReferencesFurther reading *Newton, Michael. Encyclopedia of Robbers, Heists, and Capers.

Since the chair has been located in Westminster Abbey since that time, adherents to this theory have created the title 'Westminster Stone' to avoid confusion with the 'real' stone (sometimes referred to as the Stone of Scone). One of the most vocal proponents of this theory was writer and historian Nigel Tranter, who consistently presented the theory throughout his non-fiction books and historical novels. Other historians have held this view, including James S. Richardson, who was an Inspector of Ancient Monuments in the mid-twentieth century. Richardson produced a monograph on the subject.Bradfield, Ray, Nigel Tranter: Scotland's Storyteller, p 121 History of the Stone of Destiny The Stone of Destiny was the traditional Coronation Stone of the Kings of Scotland and, before that, the Kings of Dalriada. Legends associate it with Saint Columba, who might have brought it from Ireland as a portable altar.Tranter, Nigel, The Story of Scotland, p 11 In AD 574, the Stone was used as a coronation chair when Columba anointed and crowned Aedan King of Dalriada. The Stone of Destiny was kept by the monks of Iona, the traditional headquarters of the Scottish Celtic church, until Viking raiding caused them to move to the mainland, first to Dunkeld, Atholl, and then to Scone. Here it continued to be used in coronations, as a symbol of Scottish Kingship. Edward I and the Stone In his attempts to conquer Scotland, Edward I of England invaded in 1296 at the head of an army. Sacking Berwick, beating the Scots at Dunbar, and laying siege to Edinburgh Castle, Edward then proceeded to Scone, intending to take the Stone of Destiny, which was kept at Scone Abbey. He had already taken the Scottish regalia from Edinburgh, which included Saint Margaret's Black Rood relic, but to confiscate an object so precious to the Scots, and so symbolic of their independence, would be a final humiliation. He carried it back to Westminster Abbey. By placing it within the throne of England, he had a potent symbol of his claim for overlordship. It is this stone which sat in Westminster until 1996, when it was returned to Scotland.  Substitution According to the Westminster Stone theory, the stone Edward removed was not the real Stone of Destiny, but a substitute. The English army was at the Scottish border in mid-March, 1296, and did not reach Scone until June. With three months to anticipate Edward's arrival, there was ample time and incentive for a switch to be made, in order to protect the original relic. Such a substitution could have been instigated by the Abbot of Scone, who stood as custodian. The 'Stone of Destiny' could therefore have been transported to a place of safety, and Edward fobbed off with a different piece of sandstone. Hiding the 'True Stone' There are many theories regarding the possible resting place of the 'True Stone' since, inspired by logical deduction and, in some cases, fantastical, wishful thinking. Nigel Tranter believed the True Stone was originally hidden by the Abbot of Scone, and eventually entrusted to the care of Aonghus √ìg Mac Domhnaill, by Robert the Bruce. Aonghus √ìg hid it in his native Hebrides, where the stone probably remains.Tranter, Nigel, The Story of Scotland, Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1987 One legend records that after the True Stone was given into the keeping of Aonghus √ìg, its keepership passed into the branch of the clan who settled in Sleat. A descendant of this line, C. Iain Alasdair MacDonald, wrote to Tranter, claiming he was now the custodian of the Stone, which was hidden on Skye.Bradfield, Ray, Nigel Tranter: Scotland's Storyteller, p 130 Evidence=Arguments for a substitution *The Westminster Stone is a lump of roughly-dressed sandstone, of proportions appropriate for use in building. As such, it is not remarkable or unique, or impressive. The only unusual thing about it is the presence of an iron hoop inserted in each top end, suitable for carrying on a pole. *Edward I would not have been fobbed off by anything newly-hewn, but a piece long-since rejected by builders would look suitably ancient, especially if abandoned outside and consequently weathered. That the Westminster Stone has a fault (weak point) is demonstrated by the fact it broke in half when removed from Westminster Abbey in 1950. *The Westminster Stone is certainly not the stone of Iona mentioned in early documents and traditions. Geologists confirm that the Stone is 'lower Old Red Sandstone' and was quarried in the vicinity of Scone.Prebble, John, The Lion in the North *Early seals and documentary descriptions suggest a stone that is larger than the Westminster Stone, darker in colour (possibly basalt or marble), with elaborate carvings. And it might have been retrieved because a letter to the editor of the Morning Chronicle, dated 2 January 1819, states: > On the 19th of November, as the servants belonging to the West Mains of > Dunsinane-house, were employed in carrying away stones from the excavation > made among the ruins that point out the site of Macbeth's castle here, part > of the ground they stood on suddenly gave way, and sank down about six feet, > discovering a regularly built vault, about six feet long and four wide. None > of the men being injured, curiosity induced them to clear out the > subterranean recess, when they discovered among the ruins a large stone, > weighing about 500l []. which is pronounced to be of the meteoric or semi- > metallic kind. This stone must have lain here during the long series of ages > since Macbeth's reign. Besides it were also found two round tablets, of a > composition resembling bronze. On one of these two lines are engraved, which > a gentleman has thus deciphered.‚Äî 'The sconce (or shadow) of kingdom come, > until Sylphs in air carry me again to Bethel.' These plates exhibit the > figures of targets for the arms. [...] The curious here, aware of such > traditions, and who have viewed these venerable remains of antiquity, agree > that Macbeth may, or rather must, have deposited the stone in question at > the bottom of his Castle, on the hill of Dunsinane (from the trouble of the > times), where it has been found by the workmen. This curious stone has been > shipped for London for the inspection of the scientific amateur, in order to > discover its real quality. *There is no record to show the Scots ever requested the return of the Westminster Stone in the century after its departure, which they would have done if it were an important relic. The absence of a request is quite marked in the Treaty of Northampton. The Scots had been harrying England for some years, and in 1328 the English sued for peace. The Treaty is drawn in Scotland's favour, for they were in the position to make demands. The Treaty stipulates the return of the Scottish regalia and St Margaret's Black Rood, but there is no mention of the Stone of Scone. Tranter states that the English offered to return the stone, but the Scots were not interested.Tranter, Nigel, The Story of Scotland, p 77 Arguments against a substitution The Westminster Stone theory is not accepted by many historians, or those responsible for the care of the Stone. There are many strong arguments against the theory. *If Edward I did not remove the true stone, yet claimed to have done so, the Scots' easiest refutation of his claims would be to produce the True Stone. However, there is no record of them doing so. *Hiding the stone might have been a sensible precaution while the English remained a threat, but it was never produced once the threat was removed. *Despite its importance as a symbol of Kingship, the stone was not used for subsequent coronations, which it surely would have if still in Scottish possession. *Legends and theories abound, but no proof has been found to indicate there is another stone. *If there was warning enough of Edward's intention to remove the Stone, why were the other regalia, documents and Black Rood not hidden also? *A number of English knights attended the coronation of King John of Scotland only a few years earlier, and would have seen the true stone, but none of them told Edward that his stone was a fake. *On studying the Stone in 1996, after its return to Scotland, nine periods of workmanship were identified on the Stone's faces, as well as recognisable erosion between the features, which proves it is an ancient artefact.The Stone of Destiny: Artefact and Icon (Society of Antiquaries of Scotland Monograph) Richard Welander, David J. Breeze, Thomas Owen Clancy *Edward had followers from the Scottish nobility who would also have been able to verify the stone's authenticity. Second theory: the 1950 substitution On Christmas Day 1950, the Westminster Stone was taken from the abbey by four Scottish students. It remained hidden until April 1951, when a stone was left in Arbroath Abbey. Some speculate that this stone is not the one taken from the Abbey, but merely a copy. The stone left in Arbroath was damaged, for the Westminster Stone had broken in half when removed from the Coronation Chair, but had been repaired by Glasgow stonemason Robert Gray. However, Gray had made replicas of the Stone in the 1930s, and further fuelled speculation by declaring later that he did not know which stone had been sent back to London as \\"there were so many copies lying around\\".Bradfield, Ray, Nigel Tranter: Scotland's Storyteller, p 122 This scenario receives support from a plaque placed in St Columba's Parish Church in Dundee, which claims to mark the site of the 'Stone of Scone', given to them in 1972 by 'Baillie Robert Gray'. The apparent disrespect shown towards the Stone by Gray and the students is explained by Nigel Tranter, who had some claim to knowledge, as the students asked him to act as an intermediary after the removal of the stone. Tranter later stated that Gray inserted a note inside the Westminster Stone, when repairing it, to the effect that it was 'a block of Old Red Sandstone of no value to anyone', although other reports state that Gray never revealed what the note said. However, in the 1940s, the British Geological Survey, had carried out a survey of the Stone when the Coronation Chair was undergoing conservation work. The fault line had been noticed as well as the many marks and features of the Stone's surface. This allowed verification of the authenticity of the returned item. A scanray examination conducted by the Home Office Police Scientific Development Branch in 1973 confirmed the presence of 'three metal rods and sockets, one being at right angles to the other two'. This also indicated that the repaired Westminster Stone, not a replica, had been returned.Erlend Clouston, 'Stone of Destiny proved genuine: Files reveal how in 1973 Scottish relic was X-rayed', The Guardian (17 July 1996), p. 4. 'Edward I conspiracy' The apparent absence of thirteenth and fourteenth century Scottish mentions of the Stone of Scone, and their lack of reaction to Edward's theft, compared with the wealth of legends developed in later centuries, have given rise to the theory that the Stone of Scone was never a relic of great significance to the Scots, but 'talked up' by Edward as useful propaganda. By creating a relic which, in the popular eye of the English, endorsed his claim as 'Lord Paramount', he was making a shrewd political statement. By continuing to flaunt the stone in front of later generations of Scots, the hoax became a self-fulfilling taunt.

He was most recently the head baseball coach at University of Arizona, and has served as the head baseball coach at Cal State Dominguez Hills, Pepperdine, and Florida. Lopez compiled an overall win-loss record of 1,177-742-7 in thirty-three seasons as a head coach. He is one of only three coaches to lead three different programs to the College World Series and one of only two coaches, along with Augie Garrido, to win the College World Series with two different programs. His Division I teams (Pepperdine, Florida, and Arizona) have appeared in the postseason seventeen out of twenty-six seasons. He has earned National Coach of the Year honors two times, and Conference Coach of the Year honors eight times. He began his coaching career at California State University, Dominguez Hills in 1983. The team won California Collegiate Athletic Association (CCAA) championships, and became a Division II national championship contender. From 1986 to 1987, his teams won back to back CCAA championships. In six seasons as the head coach, he compiled a 168-152-2(.525) record. In 1989, he was hired as the head baseball coach Pepperdine Waves baseball team at Pepperdine University. In six seasons, he compiled a 241-107-3(.691) record. In only his first season, he went 41-19-1, and ultimately won four consecutive post-season tournaments. In 1992, his team won the only National Championship in school history. The 3-2 victory over Cal-State Fullerton earned him consensus National Coach of the Year honors. During his seven seasons coaching the Florida Gators baseball team at the University of Florida, he compiled a 278-159-1(.636) record. He won two Southeastern Conference (SEC) championships and appeared in five NCAA Tournaments and two College World Series. While at UF, he coached major leaguers David Eckstein, Mark Ellis, Brad Wilkerson, David Ross, Ryan Shealy, and Josh Fogg. He also averaged 39 wins per season, including a school record 50 games and a College World Series appearance in 1996. Lopez, however, was controversial with some Gators faithful for not recruiting local players and for not extending scholarships to players that he did not recruit to the program. His tenure crested with a second College World Series appearance in 1998. Following a 35-27 season in 2001, Florida fired him. After being dismissed by the University of Florida, Lopez was hired as head coach of the Arizona Wildcats baseball at the University of Arizona. In his fourteen seasons as head coach, UofA qualified for the NCAA tournament eight times, including two College World Series appearances and one national championship. His 2012 national championship team went undefeated in post-season play winning 10 games, three at the Tucson Regional, two at the Super Regional against St. John's at Hi Corbett Field in Tucson, and five at the College World Series in Omaha. Lopez is only the second coach in NCAA history to win the CWS with two different teams. As the Wildcats' head coach, Lopez has an overall record of 459-300-1 (.604), and a conference record of 174-165 (.513). Lopez announced his retirement on May 25, 2015 in a press conference alongside Athletic Director Greg Byrne. On July 18, 2017, the American Baseball Coaches Association announced that they would induct Andy Lopez into their 2018 Hall of Fame Class.

This region roughly overlaps with the Appalachian mixed-mesophytic forests, which begin in southeast Ohio and southwest Pennsylvania and continue to north Georgia and Alabama. The mixed-mesophytic forest is found only in Central and Southern Appalachia and eastern/central China. It is one of the most biodiverse temperate forests in the world. Geologically, Appalachian Ohio corresponds closely to the terminal moraine of an ancient glacier that runs southwest to northeast through the state. Areas south and east of the moraine are characterized by rough, irregular hills and hollows, characteristic of the Allegheny Plateau and Cumberland Plateaus of the western Appalachian Plateau System. Unlike eastern Appalachia, this region does not have long fin-like ridges like those of the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians subranges, but a network of rocky hollows and hills going in all directions.

Appalachian Regional Commission Map showing 2012 ARC economic designations for Appalachian Ohio. The Appalachian Regional Commission was formed in 1965 to aid economic development in the Appalachian region, which was lagging far behind the rest of the nation on most economic indicators. The Appalachian region currently defined by the Commission includes 420 counties in 13 states, including 32 counties in Ohio. The Commission gives each county one of five possible economic designations-- distressed, at-risk, transitional, competitive, or attainment-- with \\"distressed\\" counties being the most economically endangered and \\"attainment\\" counties being the most economically prosperous. These designations are based primarily on three indicators-- three-year average unemployment rate, market income per capita, and poverty rate.Appalachian Regional Commission Online Resource Center . Retrieved: May 15, 2009. In 2009, Appalachian Ohio had a three-year average unemployment rate of 8.4%, compared with 7.5% statewide and 6.6% nationwide. In 2008, Appalachian Ohio had a per capita market income of $22,294, compared with $29,344 statewide and $34,004 nationwide. In 2009, Appalachian Ohio had a poverty rate of 16%, compared to 13.6% statewide and 13.5% nationwide.\\"County Economic Status, Fiscal Year 2012: Appalachian Ohio\\" , Appalachian Regional Commission.

Seven Ohio counties--Adams, Athens, Meigs, Morgan, Noble, Pike and Vinton--were designated \\"distressed\\", while nine--Ashtabula, Gallia, Guernsey, Harrison, Jackson, Lawrence, Monroe, Perry and Scioto--were designated \\"at-risk\\". The remaining half of Appalachian Ohio counties were designated \\"transitional\\", meaning they lagged behind the national average on one of the three key indicators. No counties in Ohio were given the \\"attainment\\" or \\"competitive\\" designations. Athens County had Appalachian Ohio's highest poverty rating, with 32.8% of its residents living below the poverty line. Clermont had Appalachian Ohio's highest per capita income ($30,515) and Holmes had the lowest unemployment rate (5.5%). Washington County has the highest high school graduation rate (84.5%), while Adams County has the lowest (68.6%). Although Holmes County has a significantly lower high school graduation rate than Adams County at 51.5%, its graduation rates are somewhat skewed compared to the rest of the region, due to the county's high population of Amish, whose children do not attend school past the eighth grade.

The case briefly generated a firestorm of protest in New York City when it was revealed that Perry was an honor student and was enrolled to attend Stanford on a scholarship; however, Van Houten said that Perry and his brother had attempted to mug him, and the shooting was ruled justifiable. The incident Lee Van Houten, a 24-year-old plainclothes policeman, was on assignment in the Morningside Park section of Manhattan on the night of June 12, 1985, when he said he was assaulted by two men who attempted to mug him. According to Van Houten, he was approached from behind and yanked to the ground by his neck, where two black men beat him and demanded that he give them money. He drew his gun from his ankle holster and fired three times, hitting Edmund Perry in the abdomen. The other attacker fled, and was later identified as Jonah Perry, Edmund's brother. Reaction At the time of his death, Perry was a recent graduate of Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire, one of the most prestigious preparatory schools in the United States. The revelation of this fact led to significant press coverage, much of it unfavorable to the police. The front-page headline of the New York Post the next day was \\"COP KILLS HARLEM HONOR STUDENT\\". The Village Voice suggested that Perry was shot because he was \\"too black for his own good\\", and The New York Times wrote that \\"...the death of Edmund Perry raises painfully troubling questions\\". However, 2 witnesses backed up Van Houten's version of events, and the media firestorm was short-lived. Van Houten was cleared of any culpability in the shooting. Jonah Perry, an alumnus of the Westminster School in Simsbury, Connecticut, was later put on trial for assaulting Van Houten. He was found not guilty. The NYPD settled a wrongful death claim for $75,000 in 1989. Veronica Perry, the mother of both boys and their sister Nicol, died in the city six years later on October 22, 1991, of a heart attack at 44. In popular culture Perry's experiences at Exeter and the circumstances surrounding his death formed the basis of the best-selling 1987 book Best Intentions: The Education and Killing of Edmund Perry, written by Robert Sam Anson. On January 6, 1992, NBC aired the TV movie Murder Without Motive: The Edmund Perry Story, directed by Kevin Hooks. Perry was portrayed by Curtis McClarin. Spike Lee's movie Do the Right Thing is dedicated to Edmund Perry, among other victims. The first-season episode of Law & Order, \\"Poison Ivy\\" was inspired by Perry. Various Michael Jackson biographers have concluded his 1987 song \\"Bad\\" and its music video were inspired by Edmund Perry. In the music video Michael's character is peer- pressured by his friends when he returns home from his honors high school and rebuffs his bullies by singing the song. This reflects the main lyrical theme of anti-bullying and standing up for oneself. References *Anson, Robert Sam.

It is at the north end of O'Connell Street, where it provides the south side of Parnell Square. Originally, Parnell Street was part of the ancient road connecting the old city to northern coast, with Father Matthew Bridge connecting Church Street and Wood Quay in the east, to Ballybough and Fairview in the west. During the 18th century, development of Amiens Street and Annesley Bridge provided a new coast road, and Parnell Street and its continuation to the east, Summerhill, became home to Georgian architecture. The western end of Parnell Street has been substantially redeveloped in recent years. The urban regeneration came after road plans by Dublin Corporation devastated the street in the 1970s, when it was scheduled to be part of the Inner Tangent Road scheme, causing massive dereliction and blight. Virtually all of the original Georgian architecture was destroyed and subsequently replaced by buildings of much larger scale. The eastern end of Parnell Street, having remained comparatively undeveloped, is now home to a thriving immigrant community. Most notably, a plethora of authentic Chinese and Korean restaurants have lent the east side the reputation of being Dublin's \\"Chinatown\\". There is also a significant presence of African and East and Central European businesses at the eastern end, including the Big Romance, a vinyl only craft beer pub. History and culture Rotunda Hospital, Parnell Street Formerly Great Britain Street, the street was renamed after Charles Stewart Parnell (1846‚Äì1891), Dublin Corporation adopting a resolution to rename the street following his death. The Rotunda Hospital, the Ambassador Theatre and the Gate Theatre are on Parnell Street itself while the Garden of Remembrance, the Dublin Writers Museum and the Hugh Lane Gallery are on the north side of the Parnell Square. The James Joyce Centre is immediately off Parnell Street on North Great George's Street, while located just off the eastern end is the historic Mountjoy Square. Shopping centres The Ilac Shopping Centre is the oldest shopping centre in the city centre. It is a large single-story complex that contains many shops. One entrance leads out to Moore Street's famous market, and there are also a public library and chapel inside the centre. The Moore Street Mall, a recently opened shopping centre, also has an entrance on Parnell Street. Other facilities The Cineworld (UGC) cinema on Parnell Street is the largest cinema in Ireland, with 17 screens. The street also has flagship city centre stores for German discount supermarket chains such as Aldi and Lidl. Smyths Toys and Toymaster are on Jervis Street, just off Parnell Street. A Stringfellow's restaurant and strip club operated on Parnell Street for a number of months before closing because of poor trading performance. Various residents' associations, women's groups and Christian groups had campaigned against it, and its demise has been linked to those protests. The street also has many other bars, restaurants, shops and internet cafes.

The hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìthyroid axis (HPT axis for short, a.k.a. thyroid homeostasis or thyrotropic feedback control) is part of the neuroendocrine system responsible for the regulation of metabolism and also responds to stress. As its name suggests, it depends upon the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, and the thyroid gland. The hypothalamus senses low circulating levels of thyroid hormone (Triiodothyronine (T3) and Thyroxine (T4)) and responds by releasing thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). The TRH stimulates the anterior pituitary to produce thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). The TSH, in turn, stimulates the thyroid to produce thyroid hormone until levels in the blood return to normal. Thyroid hormone exerts negative feedback control over the hypothalamus as well as anterior pituitary, thus controlling the release of both TRH from hypothalamus and TSH from anterior pituitary gland. The HPA, HPG, and HPT axes are three pathways in which the hypothalamus and pituitary direct neuroendocrine function. Physiology References. Thyroid homeostasis results from a multi-loop feedback system that is found in virtually all higher vertebrates. Proper function of thyrotropic feedback control is indispensable for growth, differentiation, reproduction and intelligence. Very few animals (e.g. axolotls and sloths) have impaired thyroid homeostasis that exhibits a very low set-point that is assumed to underlie the metabolic and ontogenetic anomalies of these animals. The pituitary gland secretes thyrotropin (TSH; Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) that stimulates the thyroid to secrete thyroxine (T4) and, to a lesser degree, triiodothyronine (T3). The major portion of T3, however, is produced in peripheral organs, e.g. liver, adipose tissue, glia and skeletal muscle by deiodination from circulating T4. Deiodination is controlled by numerous hormones and nerval signals including TSH, vasopressin and catecholamines. Both peripheral thyroid hormones (iodothyronines) inhibit thyrotropin secretion from the pituitary (negative feedback). Consequently, equilibrium concentrations for all hormones are attained. TSH secretion is also controlled by thyrotropin releasing hormone (thyroliberin, TRH), whose secretion itself is again suppressed by plasma T4 and T3 in CSF (long feedback, Fekete‚ÄìLechan loop). Additional feedback loops are ultrashort feedback control of TSH secretion (Brokken-Wiersinga-Prummel loop) and linear feedback loops controlling plasma protein binding. Recent research suggested the existence of an additional feedforward motif linking TSH release to deiodinase activity in humans. The existence of this TSH-T3 shunt could explain why deiodinase activity is higher in hypothyroid patients and why a minor fraction of affected individuals may benefit from substitution therapy with T3. Convergence of multiple afferent signals in the control of TSH release including but not limited to T3, cytokines and TSH receptor antibodies may be the reason for the observation that the relation between free T4 concentration and TSH levels deviates from a pure loglinear relation that has previously been proposed. Functional states of thyrotropic feedback control *Euthyroidism: Normal thyroid function *Hypothyroidism: Reduced thyroid function **primary hypothyroidism: Feedback loop interrupted by low thyroid secretory capacity, e.g. after thyroid surgery or in case of autoimmune thyroiditis **secondary hypothyroidism: Feedback loop interrupted on the level of pituitary, e.g. in anterior pituitary failure **tertiary hypothyroidism: Lacking stimulation by TRH, e.g. in hypothalamic failure, Pickardt‚ÄìFahlbusch syndrome or euthyroid sick syndrome. *Hyperthyroidism: Inappropriately increased thyroid function **primary hyperthyroidism: Inappropriate secretion of thyroid hormones, e.g. in case of Graves' disease. **secondary hyperthyroidism: Rare condition, e.g. in case of TSH producing pituitary adenoma or partial thyroid hormone resistance. *Thyrotoxicosis: Over-supply with thyroid hormones, e.g. by overdosed exogenously levothyroxine supplementation. *Low-T3 syndrome and high-T3 syndrome: Consequences of step- up hypodeiodination, e.g. in critical illness as an example for type 1 allostasis, or hyperdeiodination, as in type 2 allostasis, including posttraumatic stress disorder. *Resistance to thyroid hormone: Feedback loop interrupted on the level of pituitary thyroid hormone receptors.

He was born in London, the son of a leather merchant and a concert pianist. He changed his name from Schloesser to Slesser in 1914, preferring the Anglicised form when Britain went to war with Germany. In terms of his socio-economic and political viewpoints, Slesser gained notoriety for being one of the biggest advocates of distributist thought in government, opposing both unregulated capitalism and traditional socialism while arguing on behalf of a more mixed economy with capital spread more among ordinary men. His role helped push the Distributist League's interests until he left the House of Commons. Life=Background and early career Born 12 July 1883 in London, England, he was the second son of Ernest Theodore Schloesser (Slesser) (1835‚Äì1929) a leather merchant from Frankfurt, and Anna Gella Seligmann, a concert pianist . After an apprenticeship in railway engineering, his health collapsed, and when he recovered he trained as a barrister. He also joined the Fabian Society, and his legal and political careers became entwined; much of his casework involved defending workers, and in 1912 he was appointed standing counsel to the Labour Party. He was adopted by the York Labour Representation Committee to run as their candidate at the general election expected to occur in either 1914 or 1915. The Fabian Society had agreed to finance his campaign. York was a two-member seat which had returned one Conservative and one Liberal MP in 1910. The Liberal and Labour parties had agreed to only put forward one candidate each, against two Conservatives, which would have given Schloesser a good chance of victory. However, due to the outbreak of war in Europe, the election did not take place.Political Change and the Labour Party 1900-1918 by Duncan Tanner He unsuccessfully contested the 1922 general election in Leeds Central, and was defeated again at a by-election in 1923 and at the December 1923 general election. He had grown wary of socialism, and based his campaigns on what he described as \\"medieval economics\\", principles drawn from his Anglo-Catholic religious faith; in his 1941 book Judgment Reserved, he attributed his defeat in 1922 to the \\"secularist and Hebrew\\" elements in the constituency disliking the presence of monks among his supporters. Baptised Anglican, he was formally received into the Roman Catholic Church in 1946.The Palgrave Dictionary of Anglo-Jewish History  Solicitor-General  When Ramsay MacDonald's First Labour Government took office in January 1924, Slesser was appointed as Solicitor-General. This was an unusual appointment, because the post had previously been offered only to Members of Parliament, and usually only to King's Counsel (Slesser's application had been rejected in 1922). Before his appointment on 24 January, he was made a KC and knighted. The government fell in October 1924, and at the 1924 general election Slesser was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Leeds South East. He was re-elected at the 1929 general election, when Macdonald formed a Second Labour Government. The new Lord Chancellor offered Slesser a post as judge in the Appeals Court, which he accepted. He retired as a judge in 1940, on grounds of ill-health, but lived on for nearly forty years. He was a county councillor in Devon, and chair of the Dartmoor National Park Committee. Slesser died on 3 December 1979, aged 96. His wife Margaret, whom he had married in 1910, had died earlier that year. Viewpoints His role helped push the Distributist League's interests until he left the British Parliament, the league having been founded by famous British writer G. K. Chesterton and promoting Chesterton's viewpoints. Slesser's advocacy for distributist thought in government meant being part of a movement working against both unregulated capitalism and traditional socialism, as stated before, while arguing on behalf of a more mixed economy.

He notably played for Luton Town, Bristol City and Queens Park Rangers. He also played in the Football League for Reading, Rotherham United, Swindon Town, Colchester United and Grimsby Town. In the Non-League game he has previously appeared for Stevenage Borough, Tamworth, Barton Rovers, Woking, Brackley Town, Stamford and Halesowen Town, where he also had a brief spell as player/manager. Career Thorpe began his career at Leicester City, but he was transferred to Luton Town in August 1992. During his time at Luton he switched from attacking-midfielder to striker, with outstanding success. He scored 28 league goals in the 1996‚Äì97 season, and soon a move to Fulham was completed. His time at Craven Cottage was short and he joined Bristol City in the summer of 1998. He took time to adapt as Ashton Gate, and he was then sent out on loan to Reading and back to Luton twice. He eventually found form in Bristol, before he re-joined Luton on a Bosman free transfer in 2002. After 13 goals in his first season back, Thorpe left the financially crippled club for Queens Park Rangers for a cut-price ¬£50,000 fee, after Thorpe threatened to invoke a rule where he could move to QPR for free. Many Luton fans were outraged at Thorpe and have never forgiven the talented forward. He scored 10 goals in his first season at QPR, helping them win promotion to the newly formed Football League Championship, but the next season was loaned to relegation strugglers Rotherham United. He was then released by QPR, and joined Swindon Town, along with another ex-QPR striker, Jamie Cureton. His time at Swindon was unsuccessful, and he was allowed to join fellow League One side Colchester United. After their promotion to the Championship, Thorpe was released and he move to Stevenage Borough in July 2006. However, he struggled to settle there, and he was sent to Grimsby Town on loan in September 2006, and he signed for the Mariners in January 2007.

Hash  :The hash is a digital fingerprint in the form of a string of alphanumeric characters (typically hexadecimal) in the .torrent file that the client uses to verify the data that is being transferred. \\"Hash\\" is the shorter form of the word \\"hashsum\\". :Torrent files contain information like the file list, sizes, pieces, etc. Every piece received is first checked against the hash. If it fails verification, the data is discarded and requested again. :Hash checks greatly reduce the chance that invalid data is incorrectly identified as valid by the BitTorrent client, but it is still possible for invalid data to have the same hash value as the valid data and be treated as such. This is known as a hash collision. Torrent and p2p files typically use 160 bit hashes that are reasonably free from hash collision problems, so the probability of bad data being received and passed on is extraordinarily small.  Health  :Health is shown in a bar or in % usually next to the torrent's name and size, on the site where the \`.torrent\` file is hosted. It shows if all pieces of the torrent are available to download (i.e. 50% means that only half of the torrent is available). Health does not indicate whether the torrent is free of viruses.  Hit-and-run  :To intentionally \\"leech\\" a file; downloading a file while seeding as little as possible.  Index  : :An index is a list of .torrent files (usually including descriptions and other information) managed by a website and available for searches. An index website can also be a tracker.  Interested  :Describes a downloader who wishes to obtain pieces of a file the client has. For example, the uploading client would flag a downloading client as 'interested' if that client did not possess a piece that it did, and wished to obtain it.  Leech  : :Leech has two meanings. Often, leecher is synonymous with downloader (see above): simply describing a peer or any client that does not have 100% of the data. :The term leech also refers to a peer (or peers) that has a negative effect on the swarm by having a very poor share ratio, downloading much more than they upload. Leeches may be on asymmetric Internet connections or do not leave their BitTorrent client open to seed the file after their download has completed. However, some leeches intentionally avoid uploading by using modified clients or excessively limiting their upload speed.  Lurker  : :A lurker is a user that only downloads files from the group but does not add new content. It does not necessarily mean that the lurker will not seed. Not to be confused with a leecher.  Magnet link  :A mechanism different from a \`.torrent\` metafile which can be used to identify a set of files for BitTorrent based on content, as opposed to referencing any particular tracker. The method is not limited to BitTorrent data. See Magnet URI scheme.  Overseeded  :In private trackers using ratio credit, a torrent is overseeded when its availability is so high that seeders have difficulty finding downloaders.  p2p  : :In a p2p network, each node (or computer on the network) acts as both a client and a server. In other words, each computer is capable of both responding to requests for data and requesting data itself.  Peer  :A peer is one instance of a BitTorrent client running on a computer on the Internet to which other clients connect and transfer data. Depending on context, \\"peer\\" can refer either to any client in the swarm or more specifically to a downloader, a client that has only parts of the file.  Piece  :This refers to the torrented files being divided up into equal specific sized pieces (e.g., 64kB, 128kB, 512kB, 1MB, 2MB, 4MB or 8MB). The pieces are distributed in a random fashion among peers in order to optimize trading efficiency.  Ratio credit  :A ratio credit, also known as upload credit or ratio economy, is a currency system used on a number of private trackers to provide an incentive for higher upload/download ratios among member file-sharers. In such a system, those users with greater amounts of bandwidth, hard drive space (particularly seedboxes) or idle computer uptime are at a greater advantage to accumulate ratio credits versus those lacking in any one or more of the same resources.  Scraping  : :This is when a client sends a request to the tracking server for information about the statistics of the torrent, such as with whom to share the file and how well those other users are sharing.  Seed / seeding :A seed refers to a machine possessing all of the data (100 % completion). A peer or downloader becomes a seed when it completely downloads all the data and continues/starts uploading data for other peers to download from. This includes any peer possessing 100% of the data or a web seed. When a downloader starts uploading content, the peer becomes a seed. :Seeding refers to leaving a peer's BitTorrent client open and available for additional individuals to download from. Normally, a peer should seed more data than download. However, whether to seed or not, or how much to seed, depends on the availability of downloaders and the choice of the peer at the seeding end.  Share ratio  :A user's share ratio for any individual torrent is a number determined by dividing the amount of data that user has uploaded by the amount of data they have downloaded. Final share ratios over 1.0 carry a positive connotation in the BitTorrent community, because they indicate that the user has sent more data to other users than they received. Likewise, share ratios under 1 have negative connotation.  Snatch  :A torrent is snatched when its data files have been downloaded.  Snubbing  :An uploading client is displayed as snubbed if the downloading client has not received any data from it in over 60 seconds.  Super-seeding  :When a file is new, much time can be wasted because the seeding client might send the same file piece to many different peers, while other pieces have not yet been downloaded at all. Some clients, like Vuze, ŒºTorrent, and qBittorrent have a \\"super-seed\\" mode, where they try to only send out pieces that have never been sent out before, theoretically making the initial propagation of the file much faster. However the super-seeding becomes less effective and may even reduce performance compared to the normal \\"rarest first\\" model in cases where some peers have poor or limited connectivity. This mode is generally used only for a new torrent, or one which must be re-seeded because no other seeds are available.  Swarm  : :Together, all peers (including seeds) sharing a torrent are called a swarm. For example, six ordinary peers and two seeds make a swarm of eight. This is a from the predecessor to BitTorrent, a program called Swarmcast, originally from OpenCola. :BitTorrent may sometimes display a swarm number that has no relation to the number of seeds and peers you are connected to or who are available. E.g. it may show 5 out of 10 connected peers, 20 out of 100 connected seeds, and a swarm of 3.  Torrent  :A torrent can mean either a .torrent metadata file or all files described by it, depending on context. The torrent file contains metadata about all the files it makes downloadable, including their names and sizes and checksums of all pieces in the torrent. It also contains the address of a tracker that coordinates communication between the peers in the swarm.  Tracker  : :A tracker is a server that keeps track of which seeds and peers are in the swarm. Clients report information to the tracker periodically and in exchange, receive information about other clients to which they can connect. The tracker is not directly involved in the data transfer and does not have a copy of the file.

The XPD (ERCC2) gene encodes for a 2.3-kb mRNA containing 22 exons and 21 introns. The XPD protein contains 760 amino acids and is a polypeptide with a size of 87kDa. Defects in this gene can result in three different disorders: the cancer-prone syndrome xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group D, photosensitive trichothiodystrophy, and Cockayne syndrome. Just like XPB, XPD is a part of human transcriptional initiation factor TFIIH and has ATP-dependent helicase activity. It belongs to the RAD3/XPD subfamily of helicases. XPD is essential for the viability of cells. Deletion of XPD in mice is lethal for developing embryos.  Consequences of mutations in ERCC2  The ERCC2/XPD protein participates in nucleotide excision repair, and is employed in unwinding the DNA double helix after damage is initially recognized. Nucleotide excison repair is a multi-step pathway that removes a wide range of different damages that distort normal base pairing. Such damages include bulky chemical adducts, ultraviolet-induced pyrimidine dimers, and several forms of oxidative damage. Mutations in the ERCC2/XPD gene can lead to various syndromes, either xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), trichothiodystrophy (TTD) or a combination of XP and TTD (XPTTD), or a combination of XP and Cockayne syndrome (XPCS). TTD and CS both display features of premature aging. These features may include sensorineural deafness, retinal degeneration, white matter hypomethylation, central nervous system calcification, reduced stature, and cachexia (loss of subcutaneous fat tissue). XPCS and TTD fibroblasts from ERCC2/XPD mutant human and mouse show evidence of defective repair of oxidative DNA damages that may underlie the segmental progeroid (premature aging) symptoms (see DNA damage theory of aging).  ERCC2 and Nucleotide Excision Repair  The protein named XPD is expressed under the directions of the ERCC2 gene. The XPD protein is an indispensable part of the general transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) complex which is a group of proteins. Gene transcription and repairing damaged DNA are the two vital functions of the TFIIH complex. With the help of gene transcription, the TFIIH complex is able to control the functioning of many different genes in the body and the XPD protein acts as a stabilizer. XPB is another protein in the general transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) complex and is made from the ERCC3 gene, which works in coordination with XDP protein to commence the process of gene transcription. Ultraviolet rays emerging from the sun, various hazardous chemicals, harmful radiations, are all known parameters for the sabotage of the DNA. A normal and healthy cell has the capability to fix the DNA damages before the problems begin due to the damaged DNA. Cells use nucleotide excision repair to fix damaged DNA. As a part of the process, the double-stranded DNA that encircles the damage is separated by the TFIIH complex. The XPD protein acts as a helicase and helps with the nucleotide excision repair process by binding to the specific regions of DNA and by unwinding the two DNA spiral strands. This exposes the damaged protein which allows the other proteins to remove the damaged section and replace the impaired area with the correct DNA.  ERCC2 and xeroderma pigmentosum  Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is associated with the lack of DNA repair mechanism and high susceptibility of cancer. A slight insufficiency in the DNA repair mechanism may result in the development of cancer. Some cancers have been recognized with the help of the relation between the single nucleotide polymorphism and genes. The XPD protein produced by the ERCC2 gene plays an important role in the process of transcription and cell death and is also known for nucleotide excision repair pathway. Various literature studies have reviewed the correlation between polymorphisms in ERCC2 and reduced DNA repair efficiency and their influence on the development of the cancers as well as interaction with environmental exposures. The second most common cause of xeroderma pigmentosum in the United States are due to mutations in ERCC2 gene, more than twenty-five of which have been observed in people with this disease. The xeroderma pigmentosum is caused when the ERCC2 gene prevents the TFIIH complex from repairing the damaged DNA constructively. Consequently, all the deformity collects inside the DNA, sabotaging the repair mechanism and results in the cancerous or dead cells. Thus, the people suffering from xeroderma pigmentosum are highly sensitive to the ultraviolet rays from the sunlight due to the DNA repair problems. So, when ultraviolet rays harm the genes, the cell grows and divides in an uncontrolled fashion and is highly prone to be cancerous. Xeroderma pigmentosum have high risk of developing cancer in skin and eyes as they are the areas mostly exposed to sun. Xeroderma pigmentosum caused by ERCC2 mutations is associated with the numerable developmental neurological malfunctioning which includes; hearing loss, poor coordination, mobility issues, lack of intellectual abilities, difficulties in talking, walking, swallowing the food and seizures. Researchers suspect that these neurological abnormalities are due to the accumulation of DNA damage despite the brain not being exposed to ultraviolet rays. Other factors might cause the DNA damage in nerve cells as well.  Interactions  ERCC2 has been shown to interact with: * ERCC5, * GTF2H1, * GTF2H2, and * XPB.

Life=First marriage Her father had betrothed her to Gaius Julius Archelaus Antiochus Epiphanes, first son of King Antiochus IV of Commagene,Josephus, Jewish Antiquities, xix. 9. ¬ß 1. with a stipulation from her father that Epiphanes should embrace the Jewish religion,Josephus, Jewish Antiquities, xx.7.1 but the marriage had still not been contracted on her father's death at Caesarea in 44. According to Josephus, on Agrippa's death, the populace \\"cast such reproaches upon the deceased as are not fit to be spoken of; and so many of them as were then soldiers, which were a great number, went to his house, and hastily carried off the statues of [Agrippa I]'s daughters, and all at once carried them into the brothels, and when they had set them on the brothel roofs, they abused them to the utmost of their power, and did such things to them as are too indecent to be related\\" Josephus, Jewish Antiquities, xix. 9. 1 and xx.7.1 Once Drusilla's brother, Herod Agrippa II, had been assigned the tetrachy of Herod Philip I (along with Batanea, Trachonites and Abila) in around 49/50, he broke off her engagement and gave her in marriage to Gaius Julius Azizus, Priest King of Emesa, who had consented to be circumcised. Marriage to Antonius Felix It appears that it was shortly after her first marriage was contracted that Antonius Felix, the Roman procurator of Judea, met Drusilla, probably at her brother's court (Berenice, the elder sister, lived with her brother at this time, and it is thought Drusilla did too). Felix was reportedly struck by her great beauty, and determined to make her his (second) wife. In order to persuade her, a practising Jew, to divorce her husband and marry him, a pagan, he sent an emissary to plead for him. She was about twenty-two when she appeared at Felix's side, during St. Paul's captivity at Caesarea - the Book of Acts 24:24 reports that \\"Several days later Felix came [back into court] with his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess.\\" The Book of Acts gives no further information on her subsequent life, but Josephus states that they had a son named Marcus Antonius Agrippa and a daughter Antonia Clementiana. Their son perished with most of the populations of Pompeii and Herculaneum in the AD 79 eruption of Mount Vesuvius.

Synopsis Lewis Lambert Strether experiences a clash of cultures when he journeys to 1906 Paris to find his fianc√©e's wayward son and bring him back to America to take his rightful place as heir to the family fortune. The strait-laced Strether's mission falls by the wayside when he finds the openness of the European lifestyle far more attractive than his stifling existence and comes to the realization the only rescue the young man requires is from the values of his manipulative mother. Production History The show was first produced at Her Majesty's Theatre in London on October 19, 1971, and ran for 86 performances. The production was directed by Stone Widney, choreographed by Gillian Lynne, and starred Howard Keel as Lewis Lambert Strether, Danielle Darrieux as Marie de Vionnet, Margaret Courtenay as Amelia Newsome, Judith Paris as Sarah, and Blain Fairman as Bilham. The show had its American premiere at Philadelphia's La Salle Music Theatre in June 1972 with no cast members from either the London or Broadway productions. The local cast had the benefit of the creators' input as they rewrote and revised for the production. In particular, several new opening scenes and numbers were tried out for what was then considered the plot problem: \\"get the boy to Paris\\". A couple of new numbers were tested for the show. Despite the show's poor reception in London, the producers decided to bring it to Broadway. The show went through several re-writes which included cutting the first scene. The Broadway production, directed by Widney, conducted by Herbert Grossman and choreographed, because of Miss Lynne's unavailability, by Joyce Trisler, opened on November 19, 1972, at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre, where it ran for 29 performances. The cast included Keel as Lewis, Darrieux as Marie, Michael J. Shannon as Chad, Andrea Marcovicci as Jeanne de Vionnet, M'el Dowd as Amelia Newsome, and Nicholas Dante as the bellboy.

He died on 31 October 1823, at his home, No.40 Russell Square, London, at the age of 77.'The History of Parliament: The House of Commons 1790-1820, ed. R. Thorne, 1986'The Annual Biography and Obituary for the Year 1825, Volume IX' (London: Printed for Longman, Hurst, rees, Orme, Brown and Green, Paternoster Row, 1825). Page 25. His eldest son, Charles, was born in India and later followed his father into politics, eventually becoming a British peer as Baron Glenelg. His other son, Robert, followed his father into the Indian service and became Governor of Bombay, as well as being a Christian hymn writer. Indian affairs In 1792, Grant wrote the tract \\"Observations on the State of Society among the Asiatic Subjects of Great Britain.\\"Extracts may be found on the William Carey University Feb Website (accessed 18 February 2007) In it, he contended that India could be advanced socially and morally by compelling the Company to permit Christian missionaries into India, a view diametrically opposed to the long-held position of the East India Company that Christian missionary work in India conflicted with its commercial interests and should be prohibited. In 1797, Grant presented his essay to the Company‚Äôs directors, and then later in 1813, along with the reformer William Wilberforce, successfully to the House of Commons. The Commons ordered its re-printing during the important debates on the renewal of the company's charter. He was largely responsible for the foundation of East India Company College, which was later erected at Haileybury. As Chairman of the Company, Grant used his position to sponsor many chaplains to India, among them Claudius Buchanan and Henry Martyn. Christian humanitarianism Grant was part of an evangelical Anglican movement of close friends which included such luminaries as the abolitionist Wilberforce, Zachary Macaulay, John Venn, Henry Thornton, and John Shore, who lived in close proximity round Clapham Common south west of London. For some years from 1796, Grant himself lived in a large villa called Glenelg in proximity to Wilberforce and Thornton. This 'Clapham sect' welded evangelical theology with the cause of social reform. Both in India and in Britain's Parliament, Grant campaigned for the furtherance of causes of education, social reform, and Christian mission. In 1791, he helped established the Sierra Leone Company, which gave refuge to freed slaves. Also in 1791, as an influential supporter of the abolition of slavery in all its forms, he was elected to the London Abolition Committee. He served as a vice-president of the British and Foreign Bible Society from its establishment in 1804, and also supported the Church Missionary Society and the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. As a director of one of the largest businesses of the day, Grant was a remarkably effective social reformer.

Fictional character biography=Student at Xavier's Hisako Ichiki is a young girl whose greatest aspiration is one day to be an X-Man. While it was originally thought that Hisako was not a member of any of the X-Men's various training squads, a 2010 handbook entry reveals that she was a member of Kitty Pryde's Paladins squad.Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z, vol. 13 (2010) Along with her friend and fellow student, Wing (whom, after his death, she later describes as being her best friend), Hisako is attacked in the halls of the Xavier Institute by the alien villain Ord of the Breakworld. Hisako and Wing attempt to oppose Ord, but are overpowered. While both teenagers survive the attack, Wing discovers that he has been injected with a \\"cure\\" for his mutant ability of flight. Despondent, he commits suicide after some goading from a Danger Room hologram of her. In the wake of this tragedy, Hisako, her teacher Kitty Pryde, and several Xavier students find themselves trapped in a sentient and hostile Danger Room with Wing's reanimated corpse. Danger, as the intelligence is named by the X-Men, eventually leaves the Institute. When M-Day hit, she was one of 27 students to retain their powers. She participated in Emma Frost's Battle Royale which determined who will train to be an X-Man. Hisako later appeared alongside the New X-Men when the Acolytes attack the mansion.

The team and Hisako find that S.W.O.R.D. have abducted the X-Men and Hisako because they need heroes to fight a threat: Breakworld has a weapon capable of destroying the Earth. Ord sends the ship's coordinates to Breakworld's ruler, and he sends a fleet to attack the ship. The ship is heavily damaged and the X-Men are separated. Hisako ends up with Wolverine. Hisako is given membership to the X-Men and Shadowcat's uniform. Later, Wolverine and Armor are captured as Emma and the remaining X-Men try to free Cyclops. It is then revealed through a flashback that Leviathan is a fake and that Wolverine and Armor were told to be captured so the X-Men would have men inside Kruun's palace.

It grants her superhuman strength, reflexes, stamina, endurance, agility, dexterity, and durability. The body armor is depicted as enveloping her completely and protects her from tremendously strong and powerful attacks and greatly strengthens and amplifies the concussive force behind her unusually offensive and highly destructive blows. In some depictions, her psionic armor grants her enough strength to lift a Skrull ground tank and punch someone through several walls of a building. Hisako's armor is strong and durable enough to survive the heat caused from a long fall through the atmosphere. Likewise, she is able to fully withstand the impact from falling to the ground from high up in the atmosphere without any physical or external injury. She can also cause her armor to release a large amount of solid, concussive energy at once,Astonishing X-Men, vol. 3 #15 though this is initially a difficult task.Death of Wolverine: Life After Logan #1 Her armor is vulnerable to lasers, which are able to pass through it and harm her. This vulnerability is explained when she states later that her armor still has to let light through.Astonishing X-Men, vol. 3 #28 Adamantium is also able to pierce through Hisako's armor, such as Wolverine's claws, although he is not able to go through it with the rest of his body.Astonishing X-Men, vol. 3 #13 In this case, she only remained uninjured because the distance between her armor's perimeter and her body was slightly greater than the length of Wolverine's claws. She can shape her armor, such as her ability to form Wolverine-like claws and make them extend outward. In instances of extreme duress, Hisako is also able to expand her armor, greatly strengthening and increasing its size and shape around her, though her own body remains the same at its center. Hisako's body armor is partially explained as being composed of something related to her family lineage and ancestors. It is later described as being composed of memory. This is stated in an issue of Wolverine: Origins, when Hisako's armor is able to withstand blows from the Muramasa blade, which can cut through any material, since memory is \\"the only material that the blade cannot cut through.\\" Similarly, in Astonishing X-Men, vol. 3 #39, Armor's armor expands and grows to the size of a building due to the fact she feels strongly about not attending her recently deceased mother and brother's wake.Astonishing X-Men, vol. 3 #39 preview Hisako has also received combat training from Wolverine and classes in tactics from Cyclops.Astonishing X-Men, vol. 3 #25 Other versions=Leader of the X-Men In Runaways, a time- displaced future version of Gertrude Yorkes mentioned a future team of X-Men led by Hisako. Like Gertrude's Avengers, they were decimated by the villainous incarnation of Victor Mancha, known as \\"Victorious.\\" Hisako and Gert are stated to be the last of the X-Men and Avengers, respectively and Hisako mentions that she does not have enough energy to generate her armor in a fight against Victorious.Runaways, vol. 2 #2 Ghost Boxes In a variation of the Ghost Boxes storyline, two alternate versions of Hisako have been depicted. The first is a different ending to Astonishing X-Men, vol. 3 #26. Cyclops and Wolverine are taken out by the Annex. The Annex then opens a Ghost Box and a Sentinel merged Magneto comes through and kills Emma Frost and Storm leaving Hisako the only surviving member of the Astonishing X-Men.Astonishing X-Men: Ghost Boxes #1 In another alternate future, set 5 years after the Annex destroy the world, Hisako, Beast, who now has a childlike mentality, and Wolverine, who uses a wheelchair, are the last people on Earth. Kitty Pryde apparently returns to Earth and organizes an evacuation. After traveling to the evacuation point and finding out it was really a trap, Hisako breaks Beast's neck and burns Wolverine until his healing factor cancels out and dies leaving her as the last of the X-Men and possibly the last person on Earth.Astonishing X-Men: Ghost Boxes #2 Ultimate Marvel The Ultimate version of Hisako first appears as a young Japanese child being held captive in one of William Stryker's Mutant internment camps. After being rescued by Iceman and Husk, she joins their Mutant resistance movement. In this continuity, Hisako's energy armor takes the form of a large, glowing dragon.Ultimate Comics X-Men #17 When the Ultimate Universe was destroyed, Armor was one of the few inhabitants to slip through the cracks of reality and ended up in the Prime universe. Disorientated and slightly amnesic from her ordeal, she was found by the villain Miss Sinister and brainwashed. Operating as part of Miss Sinister's New Marauders, she was forced to attack the X-Men against her will. In other media=Television * Armor appears in Marvel Anime: X-Men voiced by Yukari Tamura in the Japanese version and by Stephanie Sheh in the English dub. In the series, Hisako is kidnapped by the U-Men. She is later rescued by the X-Men alongside Emma Frost (who had been hired by Hisako's parents to help control Armor's powers). She then joins the X-Men in order to investigate a case of secondary mutations occurring in Tohoku. In the past, it was revealed that Hisako went to Yui Sasaki's academy with Takeo. An incident with Takeo's immensely strong and powerful mutant abilities had accidentally resulted in a large fire that burned the nearby neighborhood and had included a small burn on Hisako's right hand.

He was born in Bridgnorth. He played three times for the England B team. Career Preece began his career as an apprentice with Walsall, turning professional in July 1980. His debut came the following year, as a substitute in the 2‚Äì1 win against Chester City. He was signed by Luton Town manager David Pleat in December 1984 and scored on his debut, a 1‚Äì0 win at home to Aston Villa. He went on to win a League Cup winners medal with Luton in 1988 and played nearly 400 times for Luton's first team. He had a testimonial game against Manchester United in 1995 before moving to Derby County on a free transfer in August that year. He was a bit- part player at Derby, and so he was loaned to both Birmingham City and Swindon Town. In September 1996 he joined Cambridge United on a free transfer. He made 75 appearances there and was appointed as manager Roy McFarland's assistant, before he joined Torquay United as a player/coach, again under McFarland in August 2001. His contract with Torquay was terminated in July 2002, a move which also led to McFarland's resignation, with Torquay chairman Mike Bateson claiming cuts were needed after the collapse of ITV Digital and subsequent reduction in income. He joined Enfield as a player, but left in December 2002 to become assistant manager of Stevenage Borough. However, a change of manager at Stevenage saw Preece return to Enfield as player-coach in February 2003. In May 2003, Preece was appointed as first-team coach of Telford United. In September 2004 he was appointed as assistant manager of Isthmian League side Walton & Hersham. Preece died in the early hours of 20 July 2007 after a short illness. At the time he had been in remission for one year following surgery for throat cancer. The family stand at Luton's Kenilworth Road stadium has since been named The David Preece Stand in memory of him. ReferencesExternal links *Profile at official Luton Town website Walsall F.C.

Both Lincoln and Stephen Douglas started their Senatorial campaigns from the balcony of this hotel.Host, William R. and Brooke Ahne Portmann, \\"Early Chicago Hotels,\\" Arcadia Publishing, 2006, p. 11., . It was the third hotel bearing this name constructed at the Southeast corner of Lake Street and Dearborn in Chicago. It was a 260-room hotel by early Chicago architect John M. Van Osdel, who is known as the architect of the Illinois Executive Mansion. It was a block masonry structure with the finest amenities of the day. The original Tremont House built in 1833 had been named after the Boston Tremont House. In 1861, this building served as Douglas' deathplace.DN-0060398, Chicago Daily News negatives collection, Chicago Historical Society. Today, a Tremont Hotel is part of the Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide network and is located at 100 East Chestnut Street, between Michigan Avenue on the Magnificent Mile and Rush Street. The Hotel houses the Chicago location of Mike Ditka's restaurant. This block of Chestnut is also known as Mike Ditka Way. George M. Pullman made his reputation as a building raiser before becoming famous for sleeping cars. In 1861, Ely, Smith and Pullman lifted the Tremont House six feet in the air; it was just one of many Chicago buildings raised to match the upward shifting street grade during the mid nineteenth century. In 1865, Mary Lincoln stayed at the hotel for one week following the assassination of her husband. Robert Lincoln and Tad Lincoln stayed with her during that time. (1913-04-24) The hotel burned to the ground a third time during the Great Chicago Fire. During the interim, John Drake (1826-1895) bought a hotel at Michigan Avenue and Congress that served as the temporary New Tremont House. Host, William R. and Brooke Ahne Portmann, \\"Early Chicago Hotels,\\" Arcadia Publishing, 2006, p. 29., . Drake bought this temporary Hotel as a successful bet that it would escape the fire the day the Tremont caught fire. Some sources ambiguously cite this as the Headquarters of the 1860 National Republican Convention. The Wigwam served as the convention center. This hotel provided the hotel and meeting accommodations for the Illinois Republican Party during the convention. A Tremont Hotel (1873‚Äì1937, pictured left) was built on the site. The rebuilt hotel remained along with the Palmer House, Grand Pacific Hotel and the Sherman House as a leading hotel after the Great Fire. It was built in the commercial palazzo architecture style of the day and claimed to be fireproof.

LFLS won the game with a score of 8‚Äì6. This day is regarded as the beginning of basketball in Lithuania.

The best Lithuanian players, playing for the Soviet Union national basketball team, won several titles with it. As members of Soviet Union team, Lithuanians (men and women) in total won 17 Olympic medals (8 gold, 6 silver and 3 bronze), 17 World championship medals (11 gold, 5 silver and one bronze), and 51 EuroBasket medals (36 gold, 4 silver and 11 bronze).

Mission  To improve the quality of justice through continuing education to lawyers and law enforcement officials in the United States and throughout the world.http://cailaw.org/index.html  History  Professional education lasts a lifetime; a principle that seems self-evident today. That was not the case, however, in 1947 when Robert Storey, Dean of the Southern Methodist University School of Law, launched The Center for American and International Law, then known as The Southwestern Legal Foundation. The notion of continuing formal education beyond law school was a relatively new idea. When Dean Storey created an organization whose primary purpose was continuing legal education, it was among the first in the country. Eleven years later, the Institute for Law Enforcement Administration (ILEA), then known as the Southwestern Law Enforcement Institute, was established. ILEA offers courses to police chiefs and to first line law enforcement managers. Perhaps its proudest moment came in 1992 with the establishment of the Center for Law Enforcement Ethics. Through the ripple effect of its Train-the-Trainer program, which advises law enforcement trainers how to incorporate ethics education in their own departments, the Ethics Center has already reached more than 10,000 sworn officers in the United States. Today, CAIL is the only continuing education center engaged in both lawyer and law enforcement education.

A left-sided player capable of playing on either wing, his last senior club was Al-Nasr Dubai. Career Valois began his professional career under the tutelage of renowned coach Guy Roux at AJ Auxerre but was unable to command a first-team position in Burgundy, and opted for a move to Ligue 2 side Gueugnon in 1997. Three years later he moved north to join Lille Olympique before crossing the English Channel in September 2001, when he signed for League Two side Luton Town. Valois enjoyed an impressive 2001‚Äì02 season with the Hatters, helping them to clinch promotion ‚Äì one highlight being his debut game at Kenilworth Road, a 5‚Äì1 victory over Torquay United. Displaying immense skill, flair & ability far and above the English third division, Jean Louis netted a 30-yard strike into the top corner in one of the finest ever Luton Town debuts. Further spectacular goals followed that season against Leyton Orient and Hartlepool. However, a dispute with manager Joe Kinnear saw him leave for SPL side Hearts in August 2002 on a free transfer. An explosive start saw him named Man of the Match on his Tynecastle debut, a 5‚Äì1 defeat of city-rivals Hibernian, despite fellow debutant Mark de Vries scoring 4 goals. Valois maintained this form during the remainder of the 2002‚Äì03 season as Hearts achieved European qualification, however an indifferent period in early 2003‚Äì04 led to his release in January 2004. Spain was Valois' next port of call, although when his 6-month contract with UD Almer√≠a was not renewed in the summer of 2004 the mercurial Frenchmen returned to Britain. After a month with Clyde, where he scored once in the Scottish Challenge Cup against Stranraer, he signed for Championship side Burnley in September, with whom he stayed until May 2005. After leaving Burnley, Jean- Louis made the move to the United Arab Emirates and a lucrative contract with UAE Second Division side Al-Khaleej.

The city is also noted for its investment in the sciences and engineering, particularly its ties to the aerospace industry. Compulsory education Red Lodge. A reform school was set up in 1854 by Mary Carpenter, with the financial help of the poet Lord Byron's widow, at Bristol's Red Lodge. In 1838, the Violet Wills School, an approved school for girls, opened in Brunswick Square, and was later renamed the Bryanston House School. It closed in the 1940s to make way for a new road scheme. The city has 129 infant, junior and primary schools, 17 secondary schools, and three learning centres. After a section of north London, Bristol has England's second-highest number of independent-school places. Independent schools in the city include Clifton College, Clifton High School, Badminton School, Bristol Grammar School, Queen Elizabeth's Hospital (the only all-boys school) and the Redmaids' High School (founded in 1634 by John Whitson, which is England's oldest surviving girls' school).

It was instrumental in the creation of early airlines and commercial routes in Europe after World War I. Design and development The Goliath was initially designed in 1918 as a heavy bomber capable of carrying of bombs with a range of . It was a fixed-undercarriage three-bay biplane of fabric-covered wood construction, powered by two Salmson 9Z engines. It had a simple and robust, yet light structure. The wings were rectangular with a constant profile with aerodynamically balanced ailerons fitted to both upper and lower wings. It was undergoing initial testing when World War I came to an end and Farman realized there would be no orders for his design. Nonetheless he was quick to understand that the big, box-like fuselage of the Goliath could be easily modified to convert the aircraft into an airliner. Commercial aviation was beginning to be developed and was in need of purpose-built aircraft. With the new passenger cabin arrangement, the Goliath could carry up to 12 or 14 passengers. It had large windows to give the passengers a view of the surroundings. The Salmson engines could be replaced by other types (Renault, Lorraine) if a customer desired it. Approximately 60 F.60 Goliaths were built. Between 1927 and 1929, eight Goliaths with various engines were built under licence in Czechoslovakia, four by Avia and four by Letov. Operational history Farman was quick to press the Goliath into service and made several publicity flights. On 8 February 1919, the Goliath flew 12 passengers from Toussus-le-Noble to RAF Kenley, near Croydon. Since non-military flying was not permitted at that date, Lucien Bossoutrot and his passengers were all ex- military pilots who wore uniforms and carried mission orders for the circumstances. The flight went well, taking 2 hours and 30 minutes. The pilot and passengers were well received in England. The return flight was made the following day and took 2 hours and 10 minutes. Other flights were made to publicize the Goliath. On 3 April 1919, 14 passengers were flown to an altitude of 6,200 m (20,341 ft). Later, on 11 August 1919, an F.60 flew eight passengers and a ton of supplies from Paris via Casablanca and Mogador to Koufa, north of Saint-Louis, Senegal, flying more than . Airlines, which were appearing very quickly all over Europe, were quick to acquire the F.60. In 1920, the Compagnie des Grands Express A√©riens (CGEA) began scheduling regular flights between Le Bourget and Croydon. The Compagnie des Messageries A√©riennes (CMA) soon followed suit. The Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale de Transports A√©rien (SGTA) opened a Paris-Brussels route in July 1920, flown by the Goliath. In May 1921, this route was extended to Amsterdam.

It is embodied in federal law in the United States as well as in local laws in several states. \\"Right to Know\\" laws take two forms: Community Right to Know and Workplace Right to Know. Each grants certain rights to those groups. The \\"right to know\\" concept is included in Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring. Environmental illness shares characteristics with common diseases. For example, cyanide exposure symptoms include weakness, headache, nausea, confusion, dizziness, seizures, cardiac arrest, and unconsciousness. Influenza and heart disease include the same symptoms. Cyanide is one of the most toxic known substances, and failure to obtain proper disclosure is likely to lead to improper or ineffective medical diagnosis and treatment. This can contribute to prolonged illness and death. Australia Right to know regarding environmental hazard information is protected by Australian law, which is described at Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities. Right to know regarding workplace hazard information is protected by Australian law, which is described at Safe Work Australia and at Hazardous Substances Information System. Canada Right to know regarding workplace hazard information is protected by Canadian law, which is described at WorkRights.ca. Right to know regarding environmental hazard information is protected by Canadian law, which is described at Environment Canada. Europe Europe consists of many countries, each of which has its own laws. The European Commission provides central access to most of the information about individual regulatory agencies and laws. Right to know about environmental hazards is managed by the European Commission Directorate for the Environment and by the European Environment Agency. * European Commission; Environment * European Environment Agency (EEA) Right to know about workplace hazards is managed by the European Agency for Health and Safety. * European Agency for Health and Safety at Work United States Toxic substances used in the work area must be disclosed to the occupants under laws managed by Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Hazardous substances used outside buildings must be disclosed to the appropriate state or local agency responsible for State Environmental Protection Agency regulatory actions outside federal land. Use on federal land is managed by United States Environmental Protection Agency and Bureau of Land Management. The Department of Defense is self-regulating, and as such, is immune to state and federal law pertaining to OSHA and EPA regulations on foreign and domestic soil.  Occupational Safety and Health Administration  Occupational Health and Safety is managed within most states under federal authority. * State Occupational Safety and Health Plans Workplace safety and health in the U.S. operates under the framework established by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act). Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) within the U.S. Department of Labor is responsible for issuing and enforcing regulations covering workplace safety. The Department of Transportation is responsible for transportation safety and for maintaining the list of hazardous materials. The Environmental Protection Agency is responsible for maintaining lists of specific hazardous materials.  Environmental Protection Agency  Environmental health and safety outside the workplace is established by the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to- Know Act (EPCRA), which is managed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and various state and local government agencies. * Learn about Your Right to Know State and local agencies maintain epidemiology information required by physicians to evaluate environmental illness. Air quality information must be provided by pest control supervisors under license requirements established by the Worker Protection Standard when restricted use pesticide is applied. The list of restricted use pesticides is maintained by the US EPA. * Restricted Use Products (RUP) Report Additionally, specific environmental pollutants are identified in public law, which extends to all hazardous substances even if the item is not identified as a restricted use pesticide by the EPA. As an example, cyfluthrin, cypermethrin, and cynoff contain cyanide, which is one of the most toxic known substances, but some of the products that contain these chemicals may not be identified as restricted- use pesticides. * Title 42 U.S.C. Section 7412 identifies the list of environmental pollutants. Some specific chemicals, such as cyaniate, cyanide, cyano, and nitrile compounds, satisfy the specific hazard definition that is identified in public law regardless of whether or not the item is identified on the list of restricted use pesticides maintained by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. * Title 42 U.S.C. Section 7413 contains the reporting requirement for environmental pollutants. Most developed countries have similar regulatory practices. Pesticides and insecticides interests in the European Union are managed by the European Environmental Protection Agency. Environmental illness share characteristics with common diseases. For example, cyanide exposure symptoms include weakness, headache, nausea, confusion, dizziness, seizures, cardiac arrest, and unconsciousness. Influenza and heart disease include the same symptoms. Failure to obtain proper disclosure that is required by physicians will result in improper, ineffective, or delayed medical diagnosis and treatment for environmental illness caused by exposure to hazardous substance and by exposure to radiation. Department of Transportation (DOT) The Library Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration within the Department of Transportation is responsible for maintaining the list of hazardous materials within the United States. All hazardous materials that are not created at the work site must be transported by motor vehicle. The safety and security of the public transportation system is enforced by Department of Transportation. Department of Transportation regulates mandatory labeling requirements for all hazardous materials. This is in addition to requirements by other federal agencies, like the United States Environmental Protection Agency, and Occupational Safety and Health Administration. DOT is responsible for enforcement actions and public notification regarding hazardous chemical releases and exposures, including incidents involving federal workers. * How to Comply with Federal Hazardous Materials Regulations DOT requires that all buildings and vehicles containing hazardous materials must have signs that disclose specific types of hazards for certified first responder. Department of Energy (DOE) Safety of certain workers is governed by the Department of Energy, such as mine workers. Public information can be obtained in the form of directives. * Department of Energy Directives Department of Defense (DOD) The United States Department of Defense manages environmental safety independent of OSHA and EPA. Spills, mishaps, illnesses, and injuries are not normally handled in accordance with local, state, and federal law. Failure to administer discipline for illegal activity occurring within a military command is considered to be dereliction of duty, which is administered under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Individuals with information about environmental crimes and individuals with environmental injuries involving the military should become familiar with the topic of Whistleblower protection in United States. Government employees, government contractors, and military officers often lack the training, education, licensing, and experience required to understand the legal requirements involving environmental safety. The sophistication required to understand legal requirements is not normally required for promotion and contractor selection within the military. Because of this, specific rules are documented in orders and directives that need to be written in plain language intended to be understood by people that have a 4th grade reading ability. Law are enforced by the commanding officer in military organizations. The commanding officer typically has the ability to read and understand written requirements. A Flag Officer is subject to Court-martial action if laws or government policies are violated under their command when the activity is outside the scope of mission orders and rules of engagement. Each commanding officer is responsible for writing and maintaining policies simple enough to be understood by everyone in their command. Each commanding officer is responsible for ensuring that command policy documents are made available to every person in their command (civilian, military, and contractor). The commanding officer is responsible for disciplinary action and public disclosures when policies are violated within their command. The commanding officer shares responsibilities for crimes that are not punished (dereliction). Military agencies operate independently of law enforcement, judicial authority, and common law. Similar exemptions exist for some state agencies. Potential crimes are investigated by military police. The following is an example of the kinds of policy documents used to conduct criminal investigations. * Naval Inspector General; Investigations Manual Because military law enforcement is performed with no independent civilian oversight, there is an inherent conflict of interest. Information and disclosures are obtained through Freedom of Information Act request and not through disclosures ordinarily associated with the EPA and OSHA that have the competency required for training, certification, disclosure, and enforcement. This prevents physicians from obtaining the kind of information needed to diagnose and treat environmental illness, so the root cause for environmental illness typically remains permanently unknown. The following organization may help when the root cause for an illness remains unknown longer than 30 days. * Office of the Secretary of Defense and Joint Staff; Freedom of Information Act Requester Service Center Criminal violations, injuries, and potential enforcement actions begin by exchanging information in the following venues when civilian government employees and flag officers are unable to deal with the situation in an ethical manner. * Local labor union officials * Freedom of information in the United States * Equal Employment Opportunity Commission * Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Defense (Hotline) * United States Secretary of Defense * President of the United States * United States Secretary of State * United States House of Representatives * United States Senate US federal laws, state laws, local laws, foreign laws, and treaty agreements may not apply.

Two mandatory documents must provide hazard information for most toxic products. * Product Label * Material Safety Data Sheet Product label requirements are established by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act under the authority of the United States Environmental Protection Agency. As a minimum this requires information about the chemical makeup of the product, instructions required for the safe use of the product, and contact information for the manufacturer of the product. * Title 40 CFR --Protection of Environment (parts 150 to 189) CHAPTER I-- ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY A Material Safety Data Sheet is required under the authority of the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration for hazardous materials to communicate health and safety risks needed by health care professionals and emergency responders. * Title 29: Labor PART 1910‚ÄîOCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH STANDARDS Subpart Z‚ÄîToxic and Hazardous Substances A summary of workers rights is available from OSHA. * EmployeeWorkplace Rights Chemical information is most frequently associated with the right to know but there are many other types of information that are important to workplace safety and health. The following sources of information are those most likely to be found at the workplace or in state or federal agencies with jurisdiction over the workplace: *Injury and illness records which employers are required to keep. *Accident investigation reports. *Workers‚Äô compensation claim forms and records. *Material safety data sheets (MSDS) and labels for hazardous chemicals used or present in the workplace. *Chemical inventories required by federal and state regulations. *Records of monitoring and measurement of worker exposure to chemicals, noise, radiation, or other hazards. *Workplace inspection reports, whether done by a safety committee, employer safety and health personnel, OR-OSHA insurance carriers, fire departments, or other outside agencies. *Job safety analysis, including ergonomic evaluations of jobs or workstations. *Employee medical records or studies or evaluations based on these records. *OSHA standards and the background data on which they are based. = Hazard Communication (HazCom 2012) = Note: Refer to 29 CFR 1910.1200 for the most current and updated information (https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&p;_id=10099) The Hazard Communication StandardHazCom (29 CFR1910.1200) first went into effect in 1985 and has since been expanded to cover almost all workplaces under OSHA jurisdiction. The details of the Hazard Communication standard are rather complicated, but the basic idea behind it is straightforward. It requires chemical manufacturers and employers to communicate information to workers about the hazards of workplace chemicals or products, including training. The Hazard Communication standard does not specify how much training a worker must receive. Instead, it defines what the training must cover. Employers must conduct training in a language comprehensible to employees to be in compliance with the standard. It also states that workers must be trained at the time of initial assignment and whenever a new hazard is introduced into their work area. The purpose for this is so that workers can understand the hazards they face and so that they are aware of the protective measures that should be in place. It is very difficult to get a good understanding of chemical hazards and particularly to be able to read MSDSs in the short amount of time that many companies devote to hazard communication training. When OSHA conducts an inspection, the inspector will evaluate the effectiveness of the training by reviewing records of what training was done and by interviewing employees who use chemicals to find out what they understand about the hazards. The United States Department of Transportation (DOT) regulates hazmat transportation within the territory of the US by Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations. * Dangerous Goods All chemical manufacturers and importers must assess the hazards of the chemicals they produce and import and pass this information on to transportation workers and purchasers through labels and material safety data sheets (MSDSs). Employers whose employees may be exposed to hazardous chemicals on the job must provide hazardous chemical information to those employees through the use of MSDSs, properly labeled containers, training, and a written hazard communication program. This standard also requires the employer to maintain a list of all hazardous chemicals used in the workplace. The MSDSs for these chemicals must be kept current and they must be made available and accessible to employees in their work areas. Chemicals that may pose health risks or those that are physical hazards (such as fire or explosion) are covered. List of chemicals that are considered hazardous are maintained according to the use or purpose. There are several existing sources that manufacturers and employers may consult. These include: *Any substance for which OSHA has a standard in force, including any substance listed in the Air Contaminants regulation. *Substances listed as carcinogens (causing cancer) by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) or the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). *Substances listed in the Threshold Limit Values for Chemical Substances and Physical Agents, published by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH). *Restricted Use Products (RUP) Report; EPA Ultimately, it is up to the manufacturer to disclose hazards. There are other sources of information about chemicals used in industry as a result of state and federal laws regarding the Community Right to Know Act. The Air Resources Board is responsible for public hazard disclosures in California. Pesticide use disclosures are made by each pest control supervisor to the County Agricultural Commission. Epidemiology information is available from the California Pesticide Information Portal, which can be used by health care professionals to identify the cause for environmental illness. Under the Oregon Community Right to Know Act (ORS 453.307-372) and the federal Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) Title III, the Office of the State Fire Marshal collects information on hazardous substances and makes it available to emergency responders and to the general public. Among the information which companies must report are: *Inventories of amounts and types of hazardous substances stored in their facilities. *Annual inventories of toxic chemicals released during normal operations. *Emergency notification of accidental releases of certain chemicals listed by the Environmental Protection Agency. The information can be obtained in the form of an annual report of releases for the state or for specific companies. It is available on request from the Fire Marshal‚Äôs Office and is normally free of charge unless unusually large quantities of data are involved. = Chemical labeling requirements = Each container that contains a hazardous chemical must be labeled by the manufacturer or distributor before it is sent to downstream users. There is no single standard format for labels. Each product must be labeled according to the specific type of hazard. Pesticide and fungicide labeling is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency. *The identity of the hazardous chemical(s) by common or chemical name. *Appropriate hazard warnings. *The name and address of the manufacturer, distributor, or the responsible party. *Product use instructions Your employer is required to inform you of: *The requirements of the Hazard Communication rules. *The operations in your work area where hazardous materials are present. *The location of the written hazard communication program, the list of hazardous chemicals, and the MSDSs of chemicals that you will be exposed to. In addition, these items must be covered in training: *Methods to detect the presence of hazardous chemicals. *Physical and health hazards of the chemicals. *Protective measures, including work practices, ventilation, personal protective equipment, and emergency procedures. *How to read and understand labels and MSDSs. *The hazards of non-routine tasks, such as the cleaning of tanks or other vessels, or breaking into lines containing chemicals. = Safety Data Sheet (SDS): Formerly known as Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) as per OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard = Note: Refer to 29 CFR 1910.1200 for the most current and updated information (https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&p;_id=10099) MSDSs are often hard to figure out, even for trained safety professionals. MSDS information is required by EPA, OSHA, DOT, and/or DOE regulations depending upon the type of hazardous substance. The Material Safety Data Sheet includes the following information. #Product identity and ingredients by chemical or common name. #Physical and chemical characteristics. #Physical hazards, such as fire and explosion. #Health hazards, including symptoms. #Primary routes of entry of the chemical into the body. #Legal exposure limits (OSHA and other recommended limits). #Whether the chemical can cause cancer. #Precautions for safe handling and use. #Control measures, including ventilation, personal protective equipment, etc. #Emergency and first aid procedures. #The date the MSDS was prepared. #Name, address, and phone number of the manufacturer. #Regulatory agencies, such as United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA SARA Title III rules EPCRA Chemical manufacturers may legally withhold the specific chemical identity of a material from the MSDS and label in the case of bona fide trade secrets. In such cases the following rules apply: *The MSDS must indicate that trade secret information is being withheld. *The MSDS must disclose information concerning the properties and effects of the hazardous chemical, even if the actual chemical identity is withheld. *The trade secret information must be disclosed to a doctor or nurse in a medical emergency. *In non-emergency cases health professionals can obtain a trade secret chemical identity if they can show they need it for purposes of health protection and if they sign a confidentiality agreement. = Exposure records = The Hazard Communication standard requires that chemical information must be transmitted to employees who work with hazardous materials. Employee exposure records can tell if a worker is actually being exposed to a chemical or physical hazard and how much exposure he or she is receiving. OSHA regulations that establish access rights to these records are found in 29 CFR 1910.1020: Access to Medical and Exposure Records. This information is usually the product of some type of monitoring or measurement for: *Dusts, fumes, or gases in the air. *Absorption of a chemical into the body, e.g. blood lead levels. *Noise exposure. *Radiation exposure. *Spores, fungi, or other biological contaminants. Employees and their designated representatives have the right under OR-OSHA regulations to examine or copy exposure records that are in the possession of the employer. This right applies not only to records of an employee‚Äôs own exposure to chemical, physical, or biological agents but also to exposure records of other employees whose working conditions are similar to the employee‚Äôs. Union representatives have the right to see records for any work areas in which the union represents employees. In addition to seeing the results, employees and their representatives also have the right to observe the actual measurement of hazardous chemical or noise exposure. Exposure records that are part of an OR- OSHA inspection file are also accessible to employees and union representatives. In fact these files, with the exception of certain confidential information, are open to the public after the inspection has been legally closed out. = Medical record = Many employers keep some type of medical records. These could be medical questionnaires, results of pre- employment physical examinations, results from blood tests or more elaborate records of ongoing diagnosis or treatment (such as all biological monitoring not defined as an employee exposure record). OSHA regulations that establish access rights to these records are found in 29 CFR 1910.1020: Access to Medical and Exposure Records. Medical records are considerably more personal than exposure records or accident reports so the rules governing confidentiality and access to them are stricter. Employee medical records do not include a lot of employee medical information because of this extra scrutiny. A good rule of thumb is that if the information is maintained separately from the employer's medical program, it probably will not be accessible. Examples of separately maintained medical information would be records of voluntary employee assistance programs (alcohol, drug abuse, or personal counseling programs), medical records concerning health insurance claims or records created solely in preparation for litigation. These records are often kept at the worksite if there is an on-site physician or nurse. They could also be in the files of a physician, clinic, or hospital with whom the employer contracts for medical services. An employee has access to his or her own medical record (29 CFR 1910.1020). An individual employee may also sign a written release authorizing a designated representative (such as a union representative) to receive access to his or her medical record. The latter might occur in a case where the union or a physician or other researcher working for the union or employer needs medical information on a whole group of workers to document a health problem. Certain confidential information may be deleted from an employee‚Äôs record before it is released. Past and future The push towards a greater availability of information came from events killed many and infected others with toxins, such as the Bhopal disaster in India in December 1984. During the Bhopal disaster, a cloud of methyl isocyanate escaped an insecticide plant due to neglect, and as a result, 2,000 people were killed and many more were injured. The plant had been already noted for their poor safety record and lack of evacuation or emergency plan. The lack of awareness and knowledge in the community about the dangers led to this disaster, which could have been avoided. Shortly after, the Emergency Planning and Right to Know Act of 1986, originally introduced by California Democrat Henry Waxman, was passed. This act was the first official step taken to helping people become more educated in the field of corporation's pollutants and their actions. The act issued a requirement for industrial facilities across the U.S. to disclose information on their annual releases of toxic chemicals. This data collected is made available by the Environmental Protection Agency in the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) which is open to public knowledge. This was noticed as a step in the right direction however, only pounds of individual pollutants were required to be released as a result of this act. No information about toxicity, spread, or overlap had been required to be shared with the public. In years to come, the public would achieve greater ways of accessing the information that corporations with excess pollutants withheld. The Toxic 100 is a form of newer information which is a list that includes one hundred companies industrial air polluters in the United States that are ranked by the quantity of pollution they produce and the toxicity of the pollutants. This data is determined by the Political Economy Research Institute (PERI) and calculated with factors such as winds carrying the pollution, height of smokestacks, and how much it impacts nearby communities.

It also involves the management of people, through measures such as evacuation and dry/wet proofing properties. The prevention and mitigation of flooding can be studied on three levels: on individual properties, small communities, and whole towns or cities. The costs of protection rise as more people and property are protected. The US FEMA, for example, estimates that for every $1.00 spent on mitigation, $4.00 is saved. Protection of individual properties Emergency flood barrier Property owners may fit their homes to stop water entering by blocking doors and air vents, waterproofing important areas and sandbagging the edges of the building. Protection of communities When more homes, shops and infrastructure are threatened by the effects of flooding, then the benefits of protection are worth the additional cost. Temporary flood defenses can be constructed in certain locations which are prone to floods and provide protection from rising flood waters. Rivers running through large urban developments are often controlled and channeled. Water rising above a canal's full capacity may cause flooding to spread to other waterways and areas of the community, which causes damage. Defenses (both long-term and short-term) can be constructed to minimize damage, which involves raising the edge of the water with levees, embankments or walls. The high population and value of infrastructure at risk often justifies the high cost of mitigation in larger urban areas. Flood risk management thumb The most effective way of reducing the risk to people and property is through the production of flood risk maps. Most countries have produced maps which show areas prone to flooding based on flood data. In the UK, the Environment Agency has produced maps which show areas at risk. The map to the right shows a flood map for the City of York, including the floodplain for a 1 in 100-year flood (dark blue), the predicted floodplain for a 1 in 1000 year flood (light blue) and low-lying areas in need of flood defence (purple). The most sustainable way of reducing risk is to prevent further development in flood-prone areas and old waterways. It is important for at-risk communities to develop a comprehensive Floodplain Management plan. In the US, communities that participate in the National Flood Insurance Program must agree to regulate development in flood-prone areas.

History Fascism had existed amongst the Manchurian Russians; the minor Russian Fascist Organization (founded in 1925), amongst others, had promoted its tenets. The defeat of the White Armies in the Russian Civil War of 1917-1922, which discredited the older White leaders, together with the rise of the Fascism in Italy (in power from 1922) caused many younger Russian emigres to look to fascism as an alternative that might best Communism. The fascist movement among the White √©migr√©s existed around the world, but the majority of its supporters lived in Manchuria and in the United States. A number of Russians had settled in Manchuria when the Russian Empire had occupied the region from 1900 to 1905, and numbers increased from an influx fleeing after the Red Army victory in the Russian Civil War. A secret convention of the various groups took place, leading to the foundation of the RFP under the presidency of Major General Vladimir Dmitrievich Kozmin. Konstantin Rodzaevsky became Secretary General of the party's central committee on May 26, 1931, becoming the de facto leader of the party. Adopting the slogan \\"God, Nation, Labour\\" and publishing the journal Natsiya (\\"Nation\\"), the party called for Italian-style fascism to take advantage of the shaky position of the Bolshevik leaders in the face of both external and internal opposition. During the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931-32 the Russian Fascist Party came out very strongly in the support of Japan, forging close links with the Kwantung Army that lasted until 1945. Blackshirts at Harbin Station, 1934, waiting for arrival of their leader Konstantin Rodzaevsky By cooperating with Japan, the RFP became the most influential √©migr√© group in Manchukuo, setting up a party school in Harbin in 1932. Rodzaevsky also assisted the Imperial Japanese Army in the formation of the Asano Detachment, the all ethnic-Russian special forces in the Kwantung Army, organized for carrying out sabotage against Soviet forces in case of any Japanese invasion of Siberia and the Russian Far East areas. The party also developed close links with like-minded groups in the United States, including Anastasy Vonsyatsky during his exile. On March 24, 1934 the RFP and Vonsyatsky's supporters (who also used the label All-Russian Fascist Organisation) agreed to a merger in Tokyo, although they would later clash over Rodzaevsky's attempts to accommodate more conservative Russians, as well as his anti-Semitism, which Vonsyatsky rejected. In a pamphlet published in Connecticut in 1932 titled On Russian Jews, Vonsyatsky had written: \\"Among the Jews, only the red Jew is our enemy. Do not touch the peaceful Jewish inhabitant, his wife or his children. We are Christians. We do not shed innocent blood, we do not lament the guilty\\". By contrast, Rodzaevsky's followers had been translating various v√∂lkisch tracts from German into Russian since 1932, and he had openly admired Nazi Germany (established in 1933) right from the beginning. Much to Rodzaevsky's discomfort, the Kwantung Army forced Rodzaevsky to concede that in the event of a war with the Soviet Union, all of the Russian emigres in Manchuria would come under the command of Ataman Grigory Semyonov. This caused tensions with Vonsyatsky, who argued that Semyonov was an incompetent general who had been defeated in the Russian Civil War, and an unsavory character to boot, being well known in Manchuria for his involvement with organized crime. In an open letter published on 31 December 1934, Vonsyatsky condemned Rodzaevsky for his \\"deviations\\" by agreeing to work with Semyonov. Rodzaevsky justified his willingness to work with the Kwantung Army under the grounds: \\"Japan is the only country not interested in the dismemberment of Russia, but the creation of a great and powerful Russia, which would be Japan's friend\\". Vonsyatsky argued that the \\"liberation of Russia\\" could only be accomplished by the Russians themselves, and opposed working with foreign powers. Eventually the RFP broke with the Americans, and in 1935 Vonsyatsky was expelled, breaking off to form a more minor movement in the United States called \\"Russian National Revolutionary Party\\", which was of anti-communist orientation and claimed that their only intention was \\"to form in Russia a truly democratic government\\". Illuminated swastika at RFP Manchouli headquarters, 1934 Nevertheless, the RFP under Rodzaevsky had grown strong, and he claimed in a speech on 22 May 1935 to have 20,000 activists organized in 597 local chapters across the world, with the majority being in Manchukuo. Subsidiaries of the RFP were set up - the Russian Women's Fascist Movement (RGFD), the Fascist Union of Youth, the Union of Young Fascists ‚Äì Vanguard (boys), the Union of Young Fascists ‚Äì Vanguard (girls), and the Union of Fascist Little Ones. Rodzaevsky's book, The Russian National State, outlined the programme of the party to establish fascism in Russia by May 1, 1938, including a desire to get rid of the Jews, indicating a strong break from the Vonsyatsky-wing. The party had a strong commitment to the Russian Orthodox Church, promising a special relationship between the Church and the state in Rodzaevsky's projected fascist Russia. The group also promised to respect the traditions of Russia's nationalities and to instigate corporatism. In a series of articles published in the spring of 1935, Rodzaevsky gave as his aims the \\"liquidation of Jewish rule in Russia\\", the re-establishment of the Eastern Orthodox Church as the state religion of Russia, rejection of the \\"tendency towards cosmopolitanism\\", and \\"Russia for the Russians\\". Rodzaevsky called for \\"class co-operation\\" instead of \\"class conflict\\", which was to be achieved via an Italian style \\"corporate state\\", which would mediate between the interests of labor and capital by imposing \\"national unions\\". Rodzaevksky stated that once the Soviet r√©gime was overthrown, he would create a \\"temporary dictatorship\\" that would establish a \\"federated state\\", and he never explicitly claimed that he was to serve as a leader, but his rhetoric left little doubt that he saw himself as the future vozhd of a fascist Russia. Rodzaevsky's definition of Russian nationalism did not define Russianness in ethnic terms so much as in terms of a \\"common historical destiny\\", which meant that provided that they were loyal the Russian state (with the exception of the Jews who Rodzaevsky saw as born disloyal), all of the non-Russian ethnic groups were to be considered \\"Russian\\". Though Rodzaevsky excoriated Imperial Russia in many ways, his definition of Russian nationalism as those loyal to the Russian state owed much to definition of Russianness in the Imperial period, where those who were loyal to the House of Romanov were considered Russian, regardless of their language. Under his leadership, Rodzaevsky envisioned Russia taking back Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Finland, and in addition, he planned to annex Romania, Bulgaria, Iran, Afghanistan, and Mongolia. Finally, to finally resolve the problem of \\"domination by the Jews and Freemasons\\", Rodzaevsky called for an alliance of Fascist Russia, Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. A problem with this future foreign policy was the open anti-Slavic racism expressed by the Nazis, who saw all Slavs as Untermenschen (sub-humans) and the Soviet Union as a place that was to be Germany's Lebensraum (\\"living space\\") that millions of Germans would colonize after conquest of the Soviet Union. One of the v√∂lkisch tracts not translated into Russian by the Russian Fascist Party was Mein Kampf, as Hitler's denigration of Slavs as Untermenschen and his statements that Germany's Lebensraum was to be found in the Soviet Union presented problems for the Russian Fascists. Rodzaevsky wrote to Hitler, asking him to amend Mein Kampf, and upon receiving no reply, finally did translate Mein Kampf into Russian in 1936 with the offending passages removed. In his speeches to his followers, Rodzaevsky praised Hitler as a \\"great statesman\\" and tried to explain away Hitler's anti-Russian statements and his intentions to colonize Russia, as expressed in Mein Kampf, as something written a long time ago that was not relevant at present, saying that he knew that Hitler had changed his views about Russia. Several of the RFP leaders called for the restoration of the monarchy, but Rodzaevsky himself remained vague on this issue until 1940, only saying that a Russia under his leadership would not be a republic and refusing to commit himself explicitly to a Romanov restoration. In November 1935 the psychological war laboratory of the German Reich Ministry of Defence submitted a study about how best to undermine Red Army morale should a German-Soviet war break out. The Wehrmacht had dispatched a team to Manchukuo to contact the leaders of the Russian Fascist Party, and working together, the German-Russian team put together a series of pamphlets written in Russian for distribution in the Soviet Union by Germany. The pamphlets written in Manchukuo were designed to play on Russian anti-Semitism, with one pamphlet calling the \\"Gentlemen commissars and party functionaries\\" a group of \\"mostly filthy Jews\\", and ending with the call for \\"brother soldiers\\" of the Red Army to rise up and kill all of the \\"Jewish commissars\\". Although this material was not used at the time, later in 1941 the material the psychological war laboratory had developed in 1935 in Manchukuo was dusted off, and served as the basis not only for German propaganda in the Soviet Union but also for propaganda within the Wehrmacht for Operation Barbarossa (1941). The Russian Fascist Party maintained very close links with Japanese military intelligence, and in January 1934, Rodzaevsky visited Tokyo to ask the Army Minister General Sadao Araki for a Japanese support to raise an army of 150,000 men from the ethnic Russian population of Manchukuo that would be led by him to invade the Soviet Union. Nothing came of this plan, if only because the Russian Fascist Party did not command the loyalty of 150,000 whom Rodzavesky claimed would flock to his banner. From 1936 onward, members of the party infiltrated into the Soviet Far East from Manchukuo to engage in sabotage and to hand out pamphlets calling for the overthrow of the Soviet r√©gime. This was extremely dangerous work, and most of the volunteers who infiltrated the Soviet Union were captured; in July 1938, a \\"spy school\\" was established to provide training for the volunteers, but the capture rate remained high, right up to April 1941 when the Soviet-Japanese non-aggression pact put an end to these operations. The Kwantung Army operated a secret biological-chemical warfare unit, Unit 731, based in Pingfang, that performed gruesome experiments on people that usually involved much evisceration of the subjects to see the effects of chemicals and germs on the human body that were always fatal for the subject. In the late 1930s, the doctors of Unit 731 demanded more white subjects to experiment upon in order to test the efficiency the strains of anthrax and plague that they were developing to kill whites, having already mastered strains capable of killing Asians by much experimentation on Chinese subjects, and as such a great many of the Russians living in Manchukuo found themselves the unwilling human guinea-pigs of Unit 731. The Kwantung Army used the Russian Fascists to kidnap various \\"unreliable\\" Russians living in Manchukuo for Unit 731 to experiment upon. From 1940 to December 1941 Konstantin Rodzaevsky and Anastasy Vonsyatsky resumed cooperation, but the start of Japanese-American War interrupted this. When war was declared, the activities of the RFP outside Manchuria slowly came to an end. The Japanese restricted the group following the Soviet‚ÄìJapanese Neutrality Pact (signed 13 April 1941). In October 1941 the Japanese uncovered the Soviet spy-ring headed by Richard Sorge in Tokyo, which caused the Tokyo to have an exaggerated and paranoid fear that Soviet spies were everywhere. The Kenpeitai began to suspect in early 1943 that Rodzaevsky was in fact a Soviet agent, and in May 1943, he was arrested and taken in for questioning by the Kenpeitai, before being released in June 1943. In July 1943, following complaints from the Soviet ambassador to the Japanese about the anti-Soviet statements coming from the Russian √©migr√©s in Manchukuo, the Japanese shut down Nash Put. By mid-1943, following the Soviet victories at Stalingrad and Kursk, the Japanese no longer took it for granted that Germany would defeat the Soviet Union, while they themselves had suffered a number of defeats at the hands of the Americans, which made Tokyo anxious to avoid a war with the Soviet Union. From the viewpoint of Tokyo, the Russian Fascist Party by the middle of 1943 had become a liability that was straining relations with Moscow - this caused the Japanese to shut down the RFP's media outlets. The group came to an end following the Red Army invasion of Manchukuo in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria of August 1945. Rodzaevsky surrendered in Harbin (1945) and was executed in Moscow (30 August 1946). ReferencesFurther reading * Hohler, Susanne (2017). Fascism in Manchuria: The Soviet-China Encounter in the 1930s.

The game was published by Capcom in Japan and Europe, but was not released in North America. Gameplay Players must navigate the hotel, retrieving the bottled souls which the hotel guests have been carrying. Neko Zombie, a heavily stitched cat who has become imprisoned in his room, introduces players to the control scheme and methods of spying on guests and stealing the souls back. Spying through keyholes allows players to eavesdrop useful information from guests, as well as scout ahead before plunging into a room and coming face-to-face with guests. Guests will usually flee if they see the player character, while they still possess a bottled soul. Once the player has recovered the soul from that particular guest, instead of fleeing they will chase and attack the player, reclaiming the soul should the player still be holding it. The guests can all run faster than the player's character, making stealth an important aspect of play. It is possible to hide in wardrobes, but this must be achieved while any pursuing guests are out of sight. As play progresses and souls are collected, more guests check-in the hotel and more hotel rooms and areas become available for exploration. This is in addition to the guests who have already been relieved of their soul bottles - these prowl the corridors of the hotel, looking for the player, making it increasingly difficult to travel from one location to another without being seen. Plot The game begins with the protagonist walking through a forest in a deep fog. They have no memory of how they ended up in the forest. They eventually see a bright light coming from a hotel, Gregory House, which is the game's main setting. They enter the hotel and are greeted by Gregory, the mouse that runs the hotel. He asks the player what their name and gender is, allowing them to proceed. From there, he gives them a room in the hotel. That night, after the player has fallen asleep, they meet Death in a dream. He tells the player that they have been trapped at Gregory House, but that he will help them to escape. In return, he wants the player to find 12 lost souls which are kept by residents of Gregory House. Death makes the promise that, once he has received the 12 souls, he will help them to escape. The player, upon waking, hears screaming from the neighbouring room, which is locked. The room's inhabitant, Neko Zombie, asks the player to get the key for the room by stealing it from Gregory. Once the player has done so, they encounter Neko Zombie. Neko Zombie gives the player explanations on various aspects of the game and, once the tutorial is finished, he gives them the game's first lost soul. After this, the player needs to retrieve the souls from each guest as they come into the hotel. As the story progresses, the story introduces Gregory's mother, who feeds on lost souls to retain her youth. Once the player has retrieved every soul, Death tells the player that he will help them to escape, but the player declines; before they leave, they want to bring Neko Zombie with them. They then go to Neko Zombie's room, asking him to accompany them. Neko Zombie declines, urging the player to hurry and leave. The player, before leaving, gives Neko Zombie a red handkerchief to tie over his foot, which has been injured by a ball-and-chain. The player then goes to the lobby, where the door is locked. There is a boss battle with Gregory's mother, in which the player has to get her to break the door down. Once this is done, the player flees Gregory House. Gregory takes on a ghostly form and gives chase, but the player manages to escape to reality. Back at Gregory House, Neko Zombie burns down the hotel, destroying it and killing everyone inside, including himself, Gregory, Gregory's mother and all of the guests. The game's ending shows that the hotel was a creation of the player, and served as an escape for the struggles of reality. The player then states that should they ever grow bored with life in reality, they will find their way back to the hotel once again. Gregory house is then shown being reconstructed, and Gregory has a room prepared for the player when they return. Reception The game received \\"generally favourable reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of one nine, one eight, one seven, and one eight for a total of 32 out of 40.

Biography William de la Mare's origins are unknown. He obtained a master's degree (Master Regent) in Paris in 1274/5. In Paris, he came under the influence of Bonaventura and Roger Bacon. He returned to England, and is known to have preached in Lincoln. In 1310, de la Mare was classed with Bonaventura, John Peckham, and others among the \\"solemn masters\\" of the order. Works De la Mare wrote scholarly notes relating to biblical texts, including textual notes (his Correctio textus bibliae), a linguistic references for the Hebrew used in original version of biblical scripture (the De hebraeis et graecis vocabilis glossarum bibliae). In the period 1277‚Äì9, de la Mare composed a work on Thomas Aquinas, the Correctorium, or Reprehensorium. In 1282, the Franciscan order adopted the 'Correctorium ', critical of Aquinas (of the Dominican Order), and it was prescribed to be read in conjunction with his works. The substance of the Correctorium was later printed (at Strasburg, 1501; Cordova, 1701, and elsewhere) with the reply to it under the name of √Ügidius Colonna. De la Mare argues that, as the \\"principium individuationis\\" is, according to the Thomists, matter, and not form, individuality, according to them, ceases to exist as soon as the soul leaves the body; in other words, the Dominican school supported the Averroistic heresy of the universal soul. De la mare also wrote in favour of a strict observance of the rule of St. Francis. Among his extant works are: Qu√¶stiones de Natura Virtutis, Burney MS. Brit. Library, 358; and Commentaries on the first three books of the Sentences, manuscripts of which are in the Laurentian Library at Florence, formerly in the Franciscan library of Santa Croce.

History The U.S. Army Military History Institute pre-dates the U.S. Army Heritage and Education Center by over 30 years. Formed in 1967 as the Military History Research Collection, a branch of the U.S. Army War College Library, the institute became the primary repository for unofficial Army historical materials. Official U.S. Army records and other materials belong to the National Archives.About the National Archives of the United States For most of its existence, the institute was housed in Upton Hall on Carlisle Barracks. Built in 1941 as an academic building for the Medical Field Service School, Upton Hall was adequate as a library but ill-suited for the size and preservation needs of a major archive. Secretary of the Army Louis Caldera formed the Army Heritage and Education Center in June 1999 as a means of bringing an Army museum to Carlisle and promoting the holdings of the institute. His successor Thomas E. White approved the construction of a new facility, the present-day Ridgway Hall, in 2001. He stated: \\"We will relocate its [the institute's] documents and holdings‚Äîthe unofficial history of the United States Army‚Äîinto a newly built state-of-the art archive, give that facility responsibility for administering historical documents and photographs Army wide, and associate it with an educational facility and a museum\\".http://www.carlisle.army.mil/ahec/AHEC_history.htm AEC History. The U.S. Army Military History Institute resided in Upton Hall, on Carlisle Barracks, from 1967 to 2004. The center, including the holdings of the institute, relocated from Upton Hall to Ridgway Hall in 2004, officially opening on September 24. The Army named the building for former Army Chief of Staff General Matthew B. Ridgway (1895‚Äì1993), commander of the 82nd Airborne Division in World War II and of United Nations forces in the Korean War. The Army Heritage Museum, formed with the center in 1999, held its artifacts mostly in storage in various places on Carlisle Barracks before the construction of its Interim Storage Facility beside Ridgway Hall in 2004. By 2005, the center created the Army Heritage Trail and began placing historical markers and large artifacts such as tanks and field artillery on display for public view. The first permanent structures, the Civil War cabins, officially opened in October of that year. The Trail continued to grow and evolve over time, and continues to expand today. In 2009, the USAHEC broke ground for the Visitor and Education Center as plans for the growth of the campus continued. In May 2011, the Center opened to the public and serves as the welcome and orientation site for all visitors to the campus. The building features a exhibit space and two multipurpose rooms for conferences and other presentations. Later in the year, the USAHEC opened the state-of-the-art Conservation Facility to house and preserve the U.S. Army's artifact collection.

The \\"Treasures of the USAHEC\\" exhibit highlights many types of materials, collected since 1967, which comprise USAHEC's current historical holdings. Objects on display were selected due to their distinctive nature or because they provide a unique perspective on the history of the U.S. Army, as well as what Soldiers found important about themselves, their units, the people they met, and the places where they served.

His pen name is \\"Lu Jiang\\" (Â±•ÂΩä). He joined the Taiwan Solidarity Union in 2001 and served as party chairman from 2005 to 2006 before he was expelled in 2014 for renouncing Taiwanese independence. Political career Shu was a military analyst at Nanhua University before being named a spokesman for the National Security Council. He then served as the secretary-general of the National Cultural Association. Upon the founding of the Taiwan Solidarity Union in August 2001, Shu was named party spokesperson and secretary-general. TSU Chairmanship In December 2004, Shu was reported as a possible candidate for the TSU chairmanship. Later that month, Shu officially declared his candidacy for the party chairmanship. Shu stepped down from his position at the National Cultural Association, where he was replaced by Tchen Yu-chiou, to declare his candidacy for the office. Though an election was planned, the Taiwan Solidarity Union's central executive committee directly appointed Shu to the chairmanship on 10 January 2005. =Yasukuni Shrine visit controversy= In April 2005, Shu visited the controversial Yasukuni Shrine in Japan, incurring much criticism in Taiwan, as the shrine has posts for World War II war criminals. However, Shu said that his visit was not an endorsement of Japanese militarism, but an attempt to memorialize Taiwanese soldiers who had died while serving the Japanese during the era of occupation. Shu resigned the party chairmanship on 25 December 2006, to take responsibility for the TSU's poor showing in the municipal elections. Post-chairmanship 2014 visit to Mainland China= In February 2014, Shu and delegates led by Kuomintang Honorary Chairman Lien Chan, visited Beijing for three days, where they met with the head of Taiwan Affairs Office Zhang Zhijun and Communist Party of China General-Secretary Xi Jinping. During the visit, Shu endorsed Lien as a champion for promoting cross-strait dialogue and advised the Democratic Progressive Party to seize this opportunity for change and to drop Taiwanese independence as a core value. His actions were viewed as seriously violating the core values of the TSU, and he was expelled from the party for making the trip to China.

While the Proprietors pay taxes to the City of Boston, the city does not own the square or its garden. It was named for the 1745 Battle of Louisbourg, in which Massachusetts militiamen led by William Pepperrell, who was made the first American baronet for his role, sacked the French Fortress of Louisbourg. Description The square itself is a small grassy oval surrounded by a wrought-iron fence; access is generally not available. There is a statue of Christopher Columbus at the north end and of Aristides the Just at the south end. History and residents The Greek Revival houses around the square reflect the rarefied privilege enjoyed by the 19th century upper class in Beacon Hill. One of the last private residences built on Louisburg Square was 2 Louisburg Square, built in 1847 for wealthy merchant and philanthropist Thomas Handasyd Perkins Jr., known as \\"Short-Arm Tom\\", who lived at 1 Joy Street. Among the famous people who lived there in the 19th Century were Atlantic Monthly editor William Dean Howells, architect Charles Bulfinch, painter John Singleton Copley, and teacher A. Bronson Alcott and his daughter, author Louisa May Alcott (who died there). Jenny Lind was married in the parlor of a house on Louisburg Square. , it is one of the most expensive residential neighborhoods in the USA; townhouses on Louisburg Square sold for $11.5 million in 2011 and $11 million in 2012, for instance.

It was initially erected as a subgenus of Phacops but some later authors thought it distinctive enough to raise its status. Species assigned to this genus occur between the Emsian and the Famennian. Chotecops is the most abundant trilobite in the Hunsr√ºck Slate and due to the excellent preservation, often soft tissue such as antennae and legs have been preserved as a thin sheet of pyrite.  Description  Like in all sighted Phacopina, the eyes of Chotecops are compounded of very large, separately set lenses without a common cornea (so called schizochroal eyes), and like almost all other Phacopina, the articulate mid-length part of the body (or thorax) in Chotecops has 11 segments. The central raised area of the cephalon (called glabella) consists from back to front of an occipital ring, but unlike in its close relative Phacops the preoccipital ring in Chotecops is flat and not reduced to its sides, and the furrow defining its front (S1) is shallow. One or two pairs of furrows (S2 and S3) may be visible further to the front which are weak at best. The large frontal lobe is moderately vaulted and falls steeply to the furrow that defines the border at its front. The space between the glabella and the eyebrow (or palpebral area) is flat. The headshield has a finer sculpture. The tailshield (or pygidium) is weakly furrowed. These characters distinguish it from Phacops.

The company was founded in 2001 by Yet-Ming Chiang, Bart Riley, and Ric Fulop. By 2009, it had about 2,500 employees globally and was headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts.Global Cleantech 100 The Guardian, September 8, 2009. Its original product technology was based upon materials initially developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  History  Advanced Research and Government Solutions Group, Ann Arbor, Michigan In November 2005, the company announced a new, faster-recharging lithium-ion battery system based on doped nanophosphate materials licensed from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In December 2006, the United States Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC) in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) awarded the company a US$15 million development contract to optimize A123 Systems' proprietary doped nano-phosphate battery technology for hybrid electric vehicle applications with a focus on power, abuse tolerance, durability and cost. USABC is an organization composed of Chrysler LLC Corporation, Ford Motor Company, and General Motors Corporation. BAE Systems announced that, from 2008, it would offer A123 Systems' lithium-ion battery technology as part of its HybriDrive Propulsion System used in the 2008 version of the Daimler Orion VII hybrid electric buses. As of September 7, 2009, more than 3,000 of the buses were in service. In May 2008, the United States Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC) in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) awarded the company a US$12.5 million grant to develop its lithium ion battery technology for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. On March 5, 2008, General Electric, the company, and Think Global announced that the three firms had entered a partnership to enable global electrification of transportation. GE invested US$20 million in the company to help it roll out batteries for Think. The company and Think at the same time signed a commercial supply agreement. The partnership was announced at the 78th annual international Motor Show in Geneva.A123 Systems press release After over $10 million in investment in the Think Global Think City, A123 ceased production of its L20 battery pack for Think after a single day of production in December, 2008. In January 2009, A123 systems applied to the U.S. Department of Energy's Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program (ATVMLP) for US$1.84 billion in direct loans to support the construction of new lithium-ion battery manufacturing facilities in the United States, locating the first plant in southeast Michigan near Detroit. The application was still pending as of early 2012, the company estimated that it might be allowed to borrow up to US$233 million from the program. In April 2009, Chrysler Corp. announced a contract with A123 to supply batteries for their ENVI EV vehicles. In August 2009, the company received a US$249 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy's Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program (ATVMLP) to build production facilities in Romulus and Livonia, Mich. after it received a US$125 million in tax credits and incentives from the Michigan Economic Development Corporation in spring and a US$10 million grant from the state in fall 2008. In September 2009, the company raised US$380 million after going public on the NASDAQ stock exchange. In 2009, the company was included on the Guardian's \\"Global Cleantech 100\\" list. Later, A123 was selected to Technology Review Magazine's list of the 50 Most Innovative Companies 2011. Chrysler's ENVI division was disbanded by Nov 2009. In December 2009, the company formed a joint venture with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC), the largest automaker in China. This was the first joint venture between a Chinese automaker and a non-Chinese battery supplier. The new venture is called Advanced Traction Battery Systems (ATBS). In August 2010, A123's co-founder Professor Yet-Ming Chiang spun off a new company from A123 named 24M Technologies, which makes technology that combines concepts in current lithium ion batteries with flow batteries, where tanks of liquid electrolytes combine to create an electric current. In 2010, A123 received a US$249 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy for building battery production facilities. Approximately $129 million of the grant was used to build a 550 MWh battery plant in Livonia and another in Romulus. An untapped $120 million grant was abandoned by A123 by May 2012. In September 2010, the company opened the largest lithium ion battery manufacturing facility in North America in Livonia, Michigan. When fully operational, the factory is expected to be capable of producing battery packs for the equivalent of up to 30,000 electric cars per year. In March 2011, the company received its third contract from the United States Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC) in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE): an US$8 million advanced battery development contract to continue developing its Nanophosphate¬Æ lithium ion battery systems to meet USABC's target application for a Power-Assist Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PAHEV) Low-Energy Energy Storage System (LEESS). The company laid off 125 workers in December 2011 as A123 had to issue a battery recall for all batteries in a car developed by Fisker. A123 Systems had more than 3000 employees as of December 2012. In August 2012, Chinese automotive components manufacturer Wanxiang Group agreed to invest up to $465 million to acquire as much as 80% of A123 Systems; but the acquisition was not completed before A123 filed for bankruptcy. In early October 2012, the A123 Systems' stock was trading for 27 cents per share, down from a 52-week high of $4.44 per share about a year beforehand. On October 16, 2012, A123 filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11. On January 28, 2013, Wanxiang America purchased the preponderance of A123's assets out of bankruptcy for $256.6M and organized A123Systems, LLC. An earlier statement, released by A123 Systems in early October, said that it had entered an asset purchase agreement with Johnson Controls, with the stipulation that the company's bid must be approved by a US bankruptcy court and could be topped by a rival bidder. Johnson did not win the bankruptcy auction and withdrew its bid in early December.  Investments  In 2010 the company invested in Fisker Automotive's Karma with Ace Investments and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. The company formed a joint venture with SAIC Motor to manufacture its batteries in China in early 2010. In February 2018, A123 announced an investment in Ionic Materials' solid-state battery technology. Ionic is developing a unique polymer electrolyte that claims new levels of safety and performance in advanced batteries.  Product recall  In early 2012, the company announced the replacement of defective battery packs and modules supplied to about five customers, including Fisker Automotive. The defect caused a Fisker Karma to shut down in a Consumer Reports test. It estimated the recall would cost about US$55 million. Fisker reduced its purchase order of battery from the company to lower its inventory. Cylindrical cells made in China that are used by BMW and others were declared as not affected.  Bankruptcy filing  On October 16, 2012, A123 filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11. The filing listed assets of $459.8 million and liabilities of $376 million. The company also stated that its automotive assets would be purchased by Johnson Controls, a supplier to A123, for $125 million. On January 28, 2013, Wanxiang America purchased the preponderance of A123's assets out of bankruptcy for $256.6M and created A123Systems, LLC. The government business was sold to US firm Navitas Systems for $2.25m.  Lithium Werks sale  In March 2018, the US battery manufacturer Lithium Werks announced it took over the Chinese factory of A123 Systems in Changzhou, plus the workforce and clients base in China, Europe and the United States.

Life Joseph Warren Yoder was born on September 22, 1872, in Belleville, Pennsylvania, United States, in the Kishacoquillas Valley (known locally as the Big Valley) region of Mifflin County. He received a traditional Amish education supplemented by participation in one of the \\"singing schools\\" that became popular in the Big Valley during the 1890s. He was a schoolteacher in Milltown, Pennsylvania, for two years from 1892 to 1894. He attended the Brethren Normal School (later Juniata College) in Huntingdon and was graduated in 1895. He later attended the Elkhart Institute (later Goshen College) in Indiana, also teaching English and music there. In 1898 he switched to Northwestern University in Illinois. He also taught at Lock Haven State Teachers College in Pennsylvania. Much of his subsequent working career he worked as a college recruiter for Juniata College in Pennsylvania. He also organized and conducted singing schools for Mennonites throughout that state. He additionally attempted to achieve reforms within the Amish and Mennonite churches in the Mifflin and Huntingdon County areas. At almost age sixty he married Emily Lane of Lane's Mills, Jefferson County on February 18, 1932. They lived in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania. Late in life he taught at Belleville Mennonite School. He commenced his writing career in reaction to the harsh depictions of another writer, Ruth Lininger Dobson, whose 1937 novel Straw in the Wind, written while she was a student at the University of Michigan, received that school's Hopwood Award. That book's depiction of the Amish of Indiana motivated Yoder to correct its harsh stereotypes with a better book about Amish life, so in 1940 he wrote Rosanna of the Amish, the story of his mother's life (and his own). He later wrote a sequel, Rosanna's Boys (1948), as well as other books presenting and recording what he regarded as a truer picture of Amish culture. His musical background enabled him to transcribe traditional Amish slow music into musical notation (Amische Lieder, 1942). He documented what he and others feel are surprising historic parallels between some of the traditional Amish tunes and Gregorian Chant; some Amish were reportedly initially distressed by this kind of analysis. Much of the rest of his writing consists of recording Amish customs and of theological and Biblical exegesis relating to Amish practice, particularly the practice of Meidung, or shunning, of those who join and then later leave the Amish church. Joseph Yoder died on November 13, 1956, in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, of lung cancer. He is buried in the Locust Grove Cemetery in nearby Belleville. Works * Rosanna of the Amish.

Cumberland College in Princeton, Kentucky, was founded in 1826 and operated until 1861. It was the first college affiliated with the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. In 1842, the Cumberland Presbyterian denomination withdrew its support from Cumberland College in favor of Cumberland University in Lebanon, Tennessee. In doing so, the denomination intended to simply relocate the school from Princeton to Lebanon, but Cumberland College remained open without denominational support until the Civil War. Founding and early years On October 22, 1825, Cumberland Synod, the ruling judicatory of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, resolved to establish a college somewhere in southwestern Kentucky. The school's primary purpose was to educate young men who wanted to become ministers, but the school would be open to all. The school would also require students to perform manual labor for two to three hours a day. The synod appointed a commission to determine a site for the college.Gore 2010, pp. 5-8. The commission considered four towns in Kentucky (Hopkinsville, Russellville, Elkton, and Princeton) and finally chose Princeton on January 13, 1826.Gore 2010, pp. 10-12. The commission hired Franceway R. Cossitt, a Cumberland Presbyterian minister, as the college's president and sole teacher. Classes first began on March 1, 1826. By the end of the year, the college had about sixty students and had hired another teacher.Gore 2010, pp. 15-16. Originally the college was named, as the synod had resolved, the Cumberland Presbyterian College. However, when the synod requested a charter for the college, members of the Kentucky legislature worried that the original name would stoke sectarian conflict. The legislature therefore dropped \\"Presbyterian\\" from the name and issued a charter to Cumberland College on January 8, 1827.Gore 2010, p. 16. Cumberland College was part of a larger manual labor movement, as other schools like the Oneida Institute and Oberlin College required students to perform physical labor in addition to their study.Goodman. The synod hoped that manual labor would prevent students from sacrificing \\"bodily vigor\\" at the expense of \\"mental energy.\\"Quoted in Gore 2010, p. 6. The college had a working farm, and students worked on the farm two hours a day.Gore 2010, pp. 28-30. In 1830 the college became home to the first Cumberland Presbyterian newspaper, the Religious and Literary Intelligencer. The paper's editor moved to Nashville in 1832 and changed the paper's name to the Revivalist; two years later, it was renamed the Cumberland Presbyterian, and eventually became the denominational organ.Gore 2010, p. 30. Relocation and final years The college's largest problem was its indebtedness. The synodical commission had chosen Princeton as the college's site on the strength of local pledges of support amounting to at least $15,000, but few of the pledges were upheld.Gore 2010, pp. 11, 24-25. By 1837 the college was $12,000 in debt, and five years later it was still indebted more than $5,600.Gore 2010, pp. 44, 59. In May 1842, the General Assembly of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church (now the denomination's highest judicatory) responded to the college's indebtedness by appointing a commission to decide whether to relocate the college, and if so where. The commission met in July and decided to relocate the college to Lebanon, Tennessee, whose backers offered $10,000 in cash. Neither the commission nor the General Assembly had the authority to dissolve Cumberland College or to relocate it outside Kentucky. The General Assembly did, however, cease its financial support for the Princeton college and allocated educational funds to the Lebanon college. Also, Franceway Cossitt left the Princeton college to become the Lebanon college's first president. The Lebanon school opened in October 1842. Though it was originally named Cumberland College, it was chartered as Cumberland University on December 30, 1843.Gore 2010, pp. 60-62. The college in Princeton, Kentucky, remained open. The college ceased its manual labor operations and sold off its farm and farm equipment. By the end of 1842, the college was, for the first time in its history, debt-free.Gore 2010, p. 63. In October 1844, Green River Synod (an intermediate judicatory of the denomination) agreed to sponsor the college now that the General Assembly no longer sponsored it.Gore 2010, pp. 68-69. Cumberland College remained viable until the height of the secession crisis. The college's last class graduated in the fall of 1860, and the college's board of trustees sold off the property.Gore 2010, p. 78. By 1888, wrote a Cumberland Presbyterian historian, \\"every vestige even of the old buildings\\" had \\"disappeared.\\"McDonnold, p. 228.

A synthetic decapeptide, it is used in assisted reproduction to inhibit premature luteinizing hormone surges The drug works by blocking the action of GnRH upon the pituitary, thus rapidly suppressing the production and action of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). In addition, cetrorelix can be used to treat hormone-sensitive cancers of the prostate and breast (in pre-/perimenopausal women) and some benign gynaecological disorders (endometriosis, uterine fibroids and endometrial thinning). It is administered as either multiple 0.25 mg daily subcutaneous injections or as a single-dose 3 mg subcutaneous injection. The duration of the 3 mg single dose is four days; if human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is not administered within four days, a daily 0.25 mg dose is started and continued until hCG is administered. Medical uses Cetrorelix is marketed by Merck Serono for use in in-vitro fertilization in all countries except Japan, where it is marketed by Shionogi and Nippon Kayaku.Aeternia Zentaris product page Aeterna Zentaris receives royalties on these sales and retains rights to develop cetrorelix for other indications. In IVF use it is injected daily after follicle stimulation has been initiated and evidence of follicle maturation is approaching; given daily it prevents an endogenous LH surge that would trigger an untimely ovulation prior to the hCG administration by the treating physician. As an alternative to the GnRH antagonist, also a GnRH agonist could be given, but agonist have to be started earlier to overcome the agonistic effect. Cetrorelix can be mixed with follitropin alpha without compromising their reported safety and efficacy. Over a period of 3 weeks, daily injections of cetrorelix were administered to 12 men in order to suppress testosterone levels. Testosterone levels were significantly suppressed as compared to a control group. During this time of suppression, increases in high density lipoproteins (HDLs) were seen. HDLs are responsible for removing cholesterol from the blood and higher amounts are correlated with increased cardiovascular health. Contraindications The use of cetrorelix is contraindicated in severe renal impairment. It is not intended for women aged 65 years or older. Use in women with severe allergic conditions is not recommended. Use with caution in women with active allergies or history of allergies. Research Cetrorelix was under development for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, premenopausal breast cancer, endometriosis, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, and uterine fibroids, but development for these indications was discontinued. A study published in Nature Medicine found a link between hormonal imbalance in the womb and Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), specifically prenatal exposure to anti-M√ºllerian hormone. For the study, the researchers injected pregnant mice with AMH so that they had a higher than normal concentration of the hormone. Indeed, they gave birth to daughters who later developed PCOS- like tendencies. These included problems with fertility, delayed puberty, and erratic ovulation. To reverse it, the researchers dosed the polycystic mice with cetrorelix, which made the symptoms to go away. These experiments should be confirmed in humans, but it could be the first step in understanding the relationship between the polycystic ovary and the anti-M√ºllerian hormone.

The museum, more commonly known as The Ontario Regiment (RCAC) 'Ferret Club', traces its roots in Oshawa to 1980, having grown to become the Historic Vehicle Section of the Ontario Regiment (RCAC) Museum. The museum's maintainers are a uniquely skilled and dedicated group of volunteer civilian military vehicle enthusiasts and include several current and former members of The Ontario Regiment (RCAC), other units of the Canadian Forces, the Canadian Army, Royal Canadian Armoured Corps, Royal Canadian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, Royal Canadian Army Service Corps and the Royal Canadian Army Cadets. Description Operated as a living museum, this organization is quite different from most traditional collections and displays of Canadian militaria. Almost every vehicle in the museum‚Äôs collection is operational, or in some state of repair or restoration. Many vehicles including the vintage Sherman Mark IV, Chaffee, M60 and Sheridan tanks, armoured personnel carriers, trucks and jeeps are frequently driven in parades and other ceremonial activities involving The Ontarios or other units of the Canadian Forces. Since most of these vehicles are ‚Äòrunners‚Äô, the museum's staff and maintainers are slightly less reluctant to let people climb onto and into their prized pieces than most museum curators. From time to time, a patron may even experience a ride first-hand. The funding required to restore, maintain, and fuel the museum‚Äôs historic vehicle collection and static displays is provided entirely by volunteers‚Äîcurrent and former members of the Canadian Forces, veterans, cadets and civilians alike. The museum raises some its operating funds by providing the use of some vehicles for select recognizable Canadian and international television or film productions. The task of restoring and maintaining such a large collection of antique vehicles is extremely resource-intensive, often physically strenuous and very expensive. Many of the Museum's collection of unrestored or under-repair vehicles are visible from Stevenson Rd N, the road leading into the south field of the Oshawa Executive Airport lands. Historical Development The Originals: Several ONTR NCOs and soldiers (retired and serving) along with former CO LCol Skea (front middle) formed the Ferret Club's original cadre in 1980The Ontario Regiment Ferret Club, a component of the Ontario Regiment (RCAC) Museum and, in turn, the Oshawa Military and Industrial Museum, has come a long way its original conception and organization in 1980. With the assistance of the Department of National Defence and the guidance of the Ontarios‚Äô commanding officer and soldiers (not to mention the generous financial backing of the Ontarios‚Äô Honorary Lieutenant Colonel, the late Lieutenant Colonel Norman F. Wilton, a former regimental officer and World War II veteran of the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion), the organization‚Äôs collection was initially a nine-car troop of fully restored, surplus Canadian Ferret armoured cars.First parade: (From left) ONT R HLCol Wilton, with CO LCol Morin and USO Capt Wilkinson (8CH), Oshawa, 1981 The troop paraded frequently throughout its early years at regimental functions, ceremonial activities and parades in Oshawa, Durham Region and beyond. The museum's collection now boasts over 70 vehicles and features several Oshawa, Ontario- built General Motors standard military pattern vehicles, employed by the Canadian Army during World War II. The Ferret Club set up shop in 1980 in a two-bay garage which stood at the northeast corner of Simcoe Street North and Glover's Road in north Oshawa. The Club subsequently relocated to a one-time dairy farm on Oshawa's 8th Concession for much of the 1980s before the landowner decided to resume dairy production on the property. It became necessary to find a permanent home for the museum's rapidly growing collection. It was felt there was no more appropriate location than the historically important Oshawa Airport lands, one of the many British Commonwealth Air Training Plan sites for allied pilot (including Americans) training during the Second World War. Collections=Historic Vehicle Section (Ferret Club) Bart: Mark IV Sherman tank of the Ontario Regiment (RCAC) Museum, 1993The Museum has a large number of armoured vehicles in its collection ranging from a motorcycle to jeeps, carry-alls, carriers and tanks. Aside from fully restored Bren Gun Carrier and M24 Chaffee, a pair of M4A2(76)W HVSS, and one unrestored Centurion, there are also a number of foreign-operated vehicles including a Scania HLVW prototype that went unprocured by the Canadian Forces in the 1980s. Several Ferrets are still in operation, along with an FV433 Abbot SPG self-propelled gun provided by the British Army Training Unit Suffield (BATUS) detachment at Suffield, Alberta. Two M60A3s dwarf almost everything else, although the two M551A1 Sheridans are deceptively large. A number of ex-US Army M113A2s are maintained and driven regularly, as are the M113C&R; Lynx. Softskin vehicles include a number of examples of different Canadian military pattern vehicles, as well as many jeeps and a couple of nice examples of the M37. M62 wreckers which are frequently employed to move the larger vehicles, turrets, or chassis and engine and components around the facility. Many other post-war trucks are also on display. Static Display Section 116thBn rifle company marched through Oshawa on 27 May 1916 Apart from its Historic Vehicle Section, the museum's volunteers painstakingly maintain Static Display Section consisting of militaria including uniforms, medals, photographs, diaries, historical books and artifacts relevant to the history of the Regiment, the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps, and the Canadian Army from the 1850s to present day.

Iannidinardo; February 18, 1912 - June 11, 1985) was an American bodybuilder, entrepreneur and physical culture advocate. He is considered a pioneer of the modern health club. Tanny was born into an Italian family in Rochester, New York. His father was a tailor.Jonathan Black, Making the American Body: The Remarkable Saga of the Men and Women whose Feats, Feuds, and Passions Shaped Fitness History (Lincoln & London: University of Nebraska Press, 2013), p 36. Amid anti-Italian sentiment during World War II, some of his family members legally shortened the surname, Iannidinardo, to Ianni. From this, Victor made a new surname, Tanny. In 1935, while a full-time school teacher, Tanny opened his first fitness club. Located in his parents' Rochester garage, the gym uniquely had carpeting, bright colors, and background music. In 1939, he closed that gym, which had done poorly, moved west, and, for a teaching degree, attended the University of Southern California.Jonathan Black, Making the American Body (U of Nebraska Press, 2013), p 37. Tanny's younger brother, Armand Tanny, had also moved west in 1939. That year, the two emptied their joint bank account of its $500, borrowed another $200, and opened their first gym, West Coast Tanny, near Santa Monica Beach. Two more locations‚Äîone in Long Beach, and one on Wilshire Boulevard‚Äîopened in 1941. The war dwindled gym users, and both new locations soon closed. During the postwar resurgence in gym users, Tanny's gym entered a new location, a former USO facility of 7 000 square feet, in Santa Monica, \\"and it soon became the hub of every famous Muscle Beach regular, including Reeves, Eiferman, and future gym heavyweight Joe Gold\\". Of the Tanny brothers, it was Armand with the physique to compete among the bodybuilding elite. Vic Tanny aggressively expanded, geographically and demographically. Earlier gyms invited mostly three, mutually exclusive types‚Äîeither bodybuilders, housewives, or celebrities‚Äîwhereas Tanny's were widely inviting. Some had bowling alleys, with a new invention, the automatic pin setter. Many had movie screens and ballet classes. Some were Swiss chalets with skating rinks, or had palm trees behind glass walls. Tanny's vision was, as now understood, \\"less perspiration than aspiration, and Tanny was anointed the era's dream maker\\". The hardcover magazine Wisdom, following issues that featured Einstein, Disney, and Jesus, placed Tanny on its December 1961 cover. Yet Tanny's excesses‚Äîgilding one gym in real gold, even down to plating the barbells and dumbbells‚Äîbrought parodies of Tanny and of his gyms to media. Vic Tanny Centers flourished from the 1950s through the early 1960s, attaining some 100 locations in the U.S. and Canada. Tanny also pioneered the annual membership,Jonathan Black, Making the American Body (U of Nebraska Press, 2013), p 38. and offered a budget plan to draw working-class families. Yet he demanded, of salespersons, sales tactics so aggressive that the New York State Attorney General responded by imposing a fair-practices code on all gyms. New constraints on business fostered backfire of a Tanny strategy: maximize a location's membership, and offer expected revenue to borrow money to open a new location. In the 1960s, apparently by over-expansion, poor management, and insufficient capital, the franchise entered bankruptcy. Tanny's centers closed or sold, some retaining his name. Others joined the Bally Total Fitness network.International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 25 (St. James Press, 1999). During semi-retirement in Florida, Tanny made a few, unsuccessful attempts to restore his brand.Jonathan Black, Making the American Body (U of Nebraska Press, 2013), p 39. In 1985, at age 73, after a debilitating stroke, Tanny died of heart failure in Tampa, Florida. Although the earlier, traditional gyms might have eventually evolved similarly without him, Vic Tanny was a visionary‚Äîthe other most arguably being Jack LaLanneSupposedly, Tanny's friend Jack LaLanne himself credited Tanny's gyms as the first with a modern, inviting style, including amenities such as mirrors and carpets.‚Äîwho rapidly outmoded them and ushered in today's familiar, modern fitness club.

It is the only high school in the Valley Local School District. Their nickname is the Indians, and their colors are purple and gold. Campus The high school building is located on a large property adjacent to the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility. The Valley Elementary School building sits on the same property northeast of the high school building. The local Kiwanis group assisted in the setting up of playground equipment on the side of the elementary building. Both the high school and elementary were built in 1992-1993 and were scheduled to begin holding classes after the Easter break in the spring of 1993. However, a prisoner uprising on Easter Sunday at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility, commonly referred to as the Lucasville Prison Riot, prevented the opening of the buildings. The high school stadium which boasts a FieldTurf surface is immediately north of the high school building and finished construction prior to the start of the school year in 2000. The high school has tennis courts as well as five baseball/softball fields, three additional soccer fields, and two football fields used for local youth sports are also located on the property. The high school baseball and softball stadiums are located on a nearby property. Academics Valley High School has an average graduating class size of 94 students, and the student teacher ratio is 16:1. The number of students in grade 10 that were at or above proficiency standards exceeded the state average in all five subjects of the Ohio Graduation Test in 2011. Advance placement courses are offered in English literature and composition, U.S. government and politics, calculus, and chemistry.

Wu Ta-k'uei was active in the resistance to the Japanese invasion of China, yet he later taught martial arts in Japan after the war. Wu Ta-k'uei was reputed to be a fierce fighter, and known as always ready to accept a challenge match. He is reported to have never been defeated, and to have been famous for badly injuring and taunting his opponents in those matches. An attested story circulated about Wu Ta-k'uei was about a fight that started in a Hong Kong dockside bar between an unarmed Wu Ta-k'uei and \\"over 30\\" stevedores armed with clubs and boathooks. The dockworkers eventually fled to a local police station for protection from the enraged Wu. Interviews with dockworkers and the police records of this fight led to sensational newspaper headlines in Kowloon and Hong Kong. Wu Ta-k'uei assisted his father and his uncle Wu Kung-tsao to set up academies in Hong Kong, Macau and Singapore.

The majority of its residents live in low- density, single detached dwellings. As of 2009, the area is home to 4,473 residents. The neighbourhood is considered a very high-income area, with an average family income of $117,619, an average dwelling value of $449,158 and a home ownership rate of 97.0%. According to MLS data, the average sale price of a home as of 2013 was $489,830. History The land where Briarwood now exists was originally farmland, owned by Mike Boychuk. He would become the owner of Boychuk Construction, a major Saskatoon homebuilder founded in 1945. Boychuk Drive, which forms Briarwood's western boundary, bears his name. The land was annexed by the city in the period between 1975 and 1979. Home construction began in 1988, but reached its peak between 1996 and 2001. Unlike most Saskatoon neighbourhoods, which name streets to honour noteworthy individuals or places, Briarwood's streets all begin with the letter \\"B\\". This makes Briarwood and the neighbourhood of Eastview somewhat unusual with their more generic street naming conventions. Institutions=Education The Saskatoon Public School Division and Greater Saskatoon Catholic School Division opted not to build schools in Briarwood, much to the resentment of some residents, who purchased homes assuming that schools would be built. A conflict ensued between homeowners and the land developers who wished to have the land rezoned for houses. Students who live in the area are bused to either Wildwood or Lakeridge schools if they are enrolled in the Saskatoon Public School Division and to either Bishop Pocock or St. Luke schools if they are enrolled in the Greater Saskatoon Catholic School Division. Government and politics Briarwood exists within the federal electoral district of Saskatoon‚ÄîGrasswood. It is currently represented by Kevin Waugh of the Conservative Party of Canada, first elected in 2015. Provincially, the area is divided into three constituencies: Saskatoon Southeast, Saskatoon Stonebridge- Dakota and Saskatoon Willowgrove. Saskatoon Southeast is currently represented by Don Morgan of the Saskatchewan Party since 2003. Saskatoon Stonebridge- Dakota is currently represented by Bronwyn Eyre of the Saskatchewan Party since 2016. Saskatoon Willowgrove is currently represented by Ken Cheveldayoff of the Saskatchewan Party since 2003. In Saskatoon's non-partisan municipal politics, Briarwood lies within ward 8. It is currently represented by Councillor Sarina Gersher, who was first elected in 2016. Parks and recreation Homes around Briarwood Lake *Briarwood Linear Park - 2.2 acres *Briarwood Swale - 14.3 acres *Briarwood Lake Park - 16.1 acres *Briarwood Neighbourhood Park - 17.4 acres The Briarwood Community Association represents local interests in discussions with the city on quality of life issues. To promote a sense of community, volunteers organize various events throughout the year, operate programs out of the Briarwood Recreation Centre and maintain the outdoor rink on Briarwood Pond. Public services Briarwood is a part of the east division of the Saskatoon Police Services patrol system. Saskatoon Fire & Protective Services' east division covers the neighbourhood. Transit services to Briarwood are provided by Saskatoon Transit on route No. 84 (Briarwood). Commercial At present, no parts of Briarwood have commercial development. 94 home-based businesses exist in the area. The nearest commercial areas lies to the south in the Lakewood Suburban Centre and to the northwest along 8th Street East including The Centre at Circle and 8th shopping centre; future development to the east is expected to include a new commercial hub along an extension of 8th Street, not far from Briarwood. Location Briarwood is located within the Lakewood Suburban Development Area. It is bounded by 8th Street to the north, Boychuk Drive to the west, Taylor Street to the south, and Wess Road to the east. Inside those boundaries, the roads are a mix of local and collector roads.

He played college basketball at Texas A&M; (2004‚Äì2008). Jones married his wife in 2012 and they have two children together. Early years Jones was born March 21, 1986 to D.C. Nealey and Betty Jones in Normangee, Texas. As a sophomore, junior, and senior at Normangee High School, Jones was a first-team All-State pick. Averaging 22.4 points and 15.1 rebounds in his senior year, Jones led his school to a 37-2 record, winning their final 23 games. The team earned a trip to the Class A Division I championship game where Jones was named the most valuable player in the title game, with 21 points, 17 rebounds, and 5 blocked shots. Jones was ranked as the Number 86 prospect in the country by HoopScoop and the 12th best post prospect by Rivals.Com. Jones was recruited by Kansas, Texas, University of Arkansas, and Texas Tech, but signed a National Letter of Intent to play at Texas A&M; University under coach Melvin Watkins. College career=Freshman year Before Jones arrived in College Station, Aggies coach Melvin Watkins was forced out, with former University of Texas El Paso coach Billy Gillispie taking over the program. Jones chose to honor his commitment and made an immediate impact at A&M;, scoring 10 points and making 10 rebounds in his college debut against North Carolina AT&T; University. Jones, who started in all 31 games, ranked second on the team in scoring with 12.7 points per game and dunks (18) and led the Aggies in rebounding (7.3), field goal percentage (.577), blocked shots (39), and three-point plays (16). He posted seven double-doubles, the most by a Big 12 freshman, and scored 10 or more points 23 times, also setting the A&M; freshman record by completing 103 free throws. His performance earned him honorable mention All-Big 12 honors and a place on the Big-12 All-Freshman team, with CollegeInsider.Com also naming him to their Freshman All-America team. With a then-career-high twenty-five points, Jones led the Aggies to a win against Clemson in the first round of the NIT. Sophomore year As a sophomore, Jones started in all of the team's games, averaging 15.3 points and a team-best 6.5 rebounds. In one of his most impressive games of the season, Jones scored 31 points against the University of Texas, the most points an Aggie had scored in Austin since 1963. In that game he tied two Big 12 records, one for field goals in a half, making 9 of 11 second-half field goal attempts, as well as for most consecutive shots, making nine straight shots to end the game. Jones also made the game-winning shot against Oklahoma State, completing an 8-foot jumper with one second remaining. The Aggies lost their rematch against Oklahoma State despite Jones's 27 points. Against North Texas, Jones scored a career-high 35 points and had a career-high 13 rebounds. Jones ranked in the conference's top 10 in scoring and rebounding, despite averaging fewer than 30 minutes per game. His performance earned him consensus second- team All-Big 12 honors, and he was named to the second-team Academic All-Big 12. The Aggies earned a spot in the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1987. The Aggies won their first-round match-up against Syracuse and appeared poised to reach the Sweet 16 when, with 18 seconds left in their second-round game against LSU, the Aggies went up 57-55. The dream was dashed fifteen seconds later, however, when Glen Davis completed a three-point shot for LSU. Junior year Expectations were raised for Jones's junior season, when Jones, along with teammate Acie Law IV, was named to the John R. Wooden pre- season top 50 All-American watch list, and the team received a Number 13 rank in the pre-season AP poll, The Aggies have ranked as high as Number 6, the highest rank the school had ever achieved. The team had their best start since opening 16-2 in the 1959-1960 season, as well as their best conference opening since the inception of the Big 12. After suffering knee problems throughout non-conference play, Jones has been a big part of the Aggies' successful 2006-2007 season, averaging 13.2 points per game and a team-best 6.4 rebounds per game. Despite a cramp in his calf that kept him out of most of the second half of the game against Iowa State, Jones still scored 21 points. Jones is an aggressive player, however, and also leads the team in fouls, averaging 3.4 per game and fouling out of five games. The Aggies have been consistently ranked in the top 10 throughout this season. In a historic moment on February 3, 2007, Jones's Aggies became the first Big 12 South team (in 32 attempts) to ever beat the then-Number 6 Kansas Jayhawks at Allen Fieldhouse. Two days later the team earned a 100-82 victory over their archrivals, then-Number 25 Texas, their twenty-first straight home win, making them the sole leader of the Big 12. Although the Aggies were the number two seed for the Big 12 Conference Tournament, they played poorly in their first game in the quarterfinals of the tournament and were eliminated in a loss to Oklahoma State. On Selection Sunday, however, the Aggies were rewarded for their regular-season play with a Number 3 seed in the South region of the 2007 NCAA Tournament. In their first-round game against Penn, Jones finished with a double-double, 14 points and 11 rebounds. He energized the team in the second half, scoring two dunks in less than a minute to give the Aggies the lead. The Aggies won 68-52 to advance to the second round of the tournament. In front of an unfriendly crowd during a tough second-round game against Louisville, Jones scored twelve points and had eight rebounds and three steals. The Aggies's 72-69 victory earned them a berth in the Sweet 16 for the first time since 1980. Senior year Jones, along with Texas Longhorns player D. J. Augustin, was featured on the front cover of the November 15, 2007 issue of Sports Illustrated. Jones graduated from A&M; a semester early.Texas A&M; Athletics Ag-E xtras :: Texas A&M; Student-Athletes are Set to Graduate Professional career After his college career, Jones joined the Houston Rockets 2008 Summer League.

As a result, they often referred to Dusty Rhodes as \\"Mr. President\\". They also believed that Lazer Tron was a real robot, since robots were supposedly common where they were from. They constantly referred to the flux capacitor, the fictional time conduit from Back to the Future. They also made many references to robot toys, referring to Lazer Tron as one of the Go-Bots, and using Transformers references like Cybertron and showing their loyalty to the Decepticons. For a while they were managed by a robot called XTC-1 In 1987, they moved to the NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions and immediately challenged the Rock 'n' Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson).

Since its foundation by the monarch of Georgia's ancient precursor Kingdom of Iberia, Tbilisi has been an important cultural, political and economic center of the Caucasus and served, with intermissions, as the capital of various Georgian kingdoms and republics. Under the Russian rule, from 1801 to 1917 it was called Tiflis and held the seat of the Imperial Viceroy governing both sides of the entire Caucasus.David Marshall Lang (1958), The last Years of the Georgian Monarchy, 1658-1832, pp. 227-230. NY: Columbia University Press. Tbilisi's proximity to lucrative east‚Äìwest trade routes often made the city a point of contention between various rival empires, and its location to this day ensures an important transit role.David Marshall Lang (1958), The last Years of the Georgian Monarchy, 1658-1832, pp. 227-230. NY: Columbia University Press. Tbilisi's varied history is reflected in its architecture, which is a mix of medieval, classical, and Soviet structures. Early history Legend has it that the present-day territory of Tbilisi was uninhabited and covered by forest as late as 458 AD, the date medieval Georgian chronicles assign to the founding of the city by King Vakhtang I Gorgasali of Iberia (or Kartli, present-day eastern Georgia). Archaeological studies of the region have however revealed that the territory of Tbilisi was settled by humans as early as the 4th millennium BC. The earliest written accounts of settlement of the location come from the second half of the 4th century AD, when a fortress was built during King Varaz-Bakur's reign (ca. 364). Towards the end of the 4th century the fortress fell into the hands of the Persians, but was recaptured by the kings of Kartli by the middle of the 5th century. According to one account King Vakhtang Gorgasali (r. 447-502) went hunting in the heavily wooded region with a falcon. The king's falcon caught a pheasant, but both birds fell into a nearby hot spring and died. King Vakhtang was so impressed with the discovery that he decided to build a city on this location. The name Tbilisi derives from the Old Georgian word \\"Tpili\\", meaning warm. The name Tbili or Tbilisi (\\"warm location\\") therefore was given to the city because of the area's numerous sulfuric hot springs, which are still heavily exploited, notably for public baths, in the Abanotubani district. This mythical foundation account is still popular, but archaeological evidence shows that Vakhtang revived, or rebuilt parts of the city (such as Abanotubani, or the Metekhi palace, where his statue now stands) but did not found it. Capital of Iberia The Anchiskhati Basilica, Tbilisi's oldest surviving church, from the 6th century King Dachi (beginning of the 6th century), the son and successor of Vakhtang Gorgasali, is said to have moved the capital of Iberia from Mtskheta to Tbilisi to obey the will left by his father. During his reign, Dachi also finished the construction of the fortress wall that lined the city's new boundaries. Beginning from the 6th century, Tbilisi started to grow at a steady pace due to the region's favorable location, which placed the city along important trade and travel routes between Europe and Asia. However, this location was also strategic from the political point of view, and most major regional powers would struggle during the next centuries for its control. In the 6th century, Persia and the Byzantine Empire were the main contenders for such hegemony over the Caucasus. In the second half of the 6th century, Tbilisi mostly remained under Sassanid (Persian) control, and the kingdom of Iberia was abolished around 580. In 627, Tbilisi was sacked by the allied Byzantine and Khazar armies. Emirate of Tbilisi The old city of Tbilisi and the ancient Narikala fortress, view ca. 1890-1900 Around 737, Arab armies entered the town under Marwan II Ibn- Muhammad. The Arab conquerors established the Emirate of Tbilisi. Arab rule brought a certain order to the region and introduced a more formal and modernized judicial system into Georgia, while Tbilisi prospered from the trade with the whole Middle East. The Arab rule heavily influenced the cultural development of the city. Few Georgians converted to Islam during this time, but Tbilisi became a mainly Muslim city. In 764, Tbilisi was once again sacked by the Khazars, while still under Arab control. The emirate became an influential local state, and repeatedly tried to gain independence from the caliphate. In 853, the armies of Arab leader Bugha al-Kabir (\\"Bugha the Turk\\" in Georgian sources) invaded Tbilisi in order to bring the emirate back under the control of the Abbasid Caliphate. Arab rule in Tbilisi continued until the second half of the 11th century; military attempts by the new Kingdom of Georgia to capture the city were long unsuccessful. The emirate, however, shrank in size, the emirs held less and less power, and the \\"council of elders\\" (a local merchant oligarchy) often assumed power in the city.Suny1994, p. 35 In 1068, the city was once again sacked, only this time by the Seljuk Turks under Sultan Alp Arslan. Georgian reconquest and Renaissance In 1122, after heavy fighting with the Seljuks that involved at least 60,000 Georgians and up to 300,000 Turks, the troops of the King of Georgia David the Builder stormed Tbilisi. After the battles for Tbilisi concluded with David's victory, he moved his residence from Kutaisi (Western Georgia) to Tbilisi, making it the capital of a unified Georgian State and thus inaugurating the Georgian Golden Age. Javakhishvili, Ivane (1982), k'art'veli eris istoria (The History of the Georgian Nation), vol. 2, pp. 184-187. Tbilisi State University Press. From 12‚Äì13th centuries, Tbilisi became a dominant regional power with a thriving economy (with well-developed trade and skilled labour) and a well- established social system/structure. By the end of the 12th century, the population of Tbilisi had reached 100,000. The city also became an important literary and a cultural center not only for Georgia but for the Eastern Orthodox world of the time. During Queen Tamar's reign, Shota Rustaveli worked in Tbilisi while writing his legendary epic poem, The Knight in the Panther's Skin. This period is often referred to as the Georgian Golden Age or the Georgian Renaissance Mongol domination and the following period of instability French traveller Jean Chardin, 1671 Capture of Tiflis by Agha Muhammad Khan in 1795. A Qajar-era miniature from the British Library. Tbilisi's Golden Age did not last for more than a century. In 1236, after suffering crushing defeats to the Mongols, Georgia came under Mongol domination. The nation itself maintained a form of semi-independence and did not lose its statehood, but Tbilisi was strongly influenced by the Mongols for the next century both politically and culturally. In the 1320s, the Mongols were forcefully expelled from Georgia and Tbilisi became the capital of an independent Georgian state once again. An outbreak of the plague struck the city in 1366. From the late 14th until the end of the 18th century, Tbilisi came under the rule of various foreign invaders once again and on several occasions was completely burnt to the ground. In 1386, Tbilisi was invaded by the armies of Tamerlane (Timur). In 1444, the city was invaded and destroyed by Jahan Shah (the Shah of the town of Tabriz in Persia). From 1477 to 1478 the city was held by the Ak Koyunlu tribesmen of Uzun Hassan. Tbilisi under Iranian control As early as the 1510s, Tbilisi, Kartli and Kakheti, were made vassal territories of Safavid Iran. In 1522, Tbilisi was garrisoned for the first time by a large Safavid force. Following the death of king (shah) Ismail I (r. 1501-1524), king David X of Kartli expelled the Iranians. During this period, many parts of Tbilisi were reconstructed and rebuilt. The four campaigns of king Tahmasp I (r. 1524-1576) resulted in the reoccupation of Kartli and Kakheti, and a Safavid force was permanently stationed in Tbilisi from 1551 onwards. With the 1555 Treaty of Amasya, and more firmly from 1614 to 1747, with brief intermissions, Tbilisi was an important city under Iranian rule, and it functioned as a seat of the Iranian vassal kings of Kartli whom the shah conferred with the title of vali. A wall was built around the city in 1675 by Shah Suleiman I. Under the later rules of Teimuraz II and Erekle II, Tbilisi became a vibrant political and cultural center free of foreign rule, but the city was captured and devastated in 1795 by the Iranian Qajar ruler Agha Mohammad Khan, who sought to re-establish Iran's traditional suzerainty over the region.Suny, pp. 58‚Äì59 At this point, believing that his Georgian territories of Kartli-Kakheti could not hold up against Iran and its resubjugation alone, Erekle sought the help of Russia, which led to a more complete loss of independence than had been the case in the past centuries, but also to the progressive transformation of Tbilisi into a European city. Tbilisi under Russian control The coat of arms of Tiflis under Russian rule Metekhi cliff and the surroundings as depicted by Nikolay Chernetsov, 1839 In 1801, after the Georgian kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti of which Tbilisi was the capital was annexed by the Russian Empire, Iran officially lost control over the city and the wider Georgian lands it had been ruling for centuries. Under Russian rule, the city subsequently became the center of the Tbilisi Governorate (Gubernia). From the beginning of the 19th century Tbilisi started to grow economically and politically. New buildings, mainly of European style, were erected throughout the town. New roads and railroads were built to connect Tbilisi to other important cities in Russia and other parts of Transcaucasia such as Batumi, Poti, Baku, and Yerevan. By the 1850s Tbilisi once again emerged as a major trade and a cultural center. The likes of Ilia Chavchavadze, Akaki Tsereteli, Mirza Fatali Akhundzade, Iakob Gogebashvili, Alexander Griboedov and many other statesmen, poets, and artists all found their home in Tbilisi. The city was visited on numerous occasions by and was the object of affection of Alexander Pushkin, Leo Tolstoy, Mikhail Lermontov, the Romanov Family and others. The main new artery built under Russian administration was Golovin Avenue (present-day Rustaveli Avenue), on which the Viceroys of the Caucasus established their residence. Throughout the century, the political, economic and cultural role of Tbilisi with its ethnic, confessional and cultural diversity was significant not only for Georgia but for the whole Caucasus. Hence, Tbilisi took on a different look. It acquired different architectural monuments and the attributes of an international city, as well as its own urban folklore and language, and the specific Tbilisuri (literally, belonging to Tbilisi) culture.

After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the city served as a location of the Transcaucasus interim government which established, in the spring of 1918, the short-lived independent Transcaucasian Federation with the capital in Tbilisi. It was here, in the former Caucasus Vice royal Palace, where the independence of three Transcaucasian nations ‚Äì Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan ‚Äì was declared on 26 to 28 May 1918. Since then, Tbilisi functioned as the capital of the Democratic Republic of Georgia until 25 February 1921. From 1918 to 1919 the city was also a home to the German and British military headquarters consecutively. Under the national government, Tbilisi turned into the first Caucasian University City after the Tbilisi State University was founded in 1918, a long-time dream of the Georgians banned by the Imperial Russian authorities for several decades. On 25 February 1921, the Bolshevist Russian 11th Red Army entered Tbilisi after bitter fighting at the outskirts of the city and declared Soviet rule. Tbilisi during the Soviet period The 11th Red Army of the Russian SFSR occupies Tbilisi, 25 February 1921 In 1921, the Red Army invaded the Democratic Republic of Georgia from Russia, and a Bolshevik regime was installed in Tbilisi. Between 1922 and 1936, Tbilisi was the seat of the Transcaucasian SFSR, which regrouped the three Caucasian republics. After its dissolution, Tbilisi remained the capital city of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic until 1991. In 1936, the official Russian name of the city was changed from Tiflis to Tbilisi, which led to a progressive change of name for the city in most foreign languages. During Soviet rule, Tbilisi's population grew significantly, the city became more industrialized and came to be one of the most important political, social, and cultural centers of the Soviet Union along with Moscow, Kiev, and St. Petersburg. Stalinist buildings such as the current Parliament of Georgia were built on the main avenues, but most ancient neighborhoods retained their character. Many religious buildings were destroyed during anti-religious campaigns, such as the Vank Cathedral. With the expansion of the city came new places for culture and entertainment, on the model of other Soviet metropolises: Vake Park was inaugurated in 1946, the Sports Palace in 1961. New standardized residential areas (typical microdistricts) were built from the 1960s: Gldani, Varketili, etc. To link them all with the old city center, a Metro system was developed, which opened in phases from 1966. In the 1970s and the 1980s the old part of the city was considerably reconstructed. Shota Kavlashvili, the architect who planned the reconstruction, wanted to make the center look like in the 19th century. The reconstruction started from the side of Baratashvili Avenue, where some residential buildings were demolished to uncover the 18th century city wall. Tbilisi witnessed mass anti-Soviet demonstrations in 1956 (in protest against the anti-Stalin policies of Nikita Khrushchev), 1978 (in defense of the Georgian language) and 1989 (the April 9 tragedy). Both 1956 and 1989 demonstrations were repressed in a bloody way by the authorities, leading to dozens of deaths. After the break-up of the Soviet Union Panoramic view of Tbilisi in 2015. Since the break-up of the Soviet Union, Tbilisi has experienced periods of significant instability and turmoil. After a brief civil war which the city endured for two weeks from December 1991 ‚Äì January 1992 (when pro-Gamsakhurdia and Opposition forces clashed with each other), Tbilisi became the scene of frequent armed confrontations between various mafia clans and illegal business entrepreneurs. Even during the Edvard Shevardnadze era (1993‚Äì2003), crime and corruption became rampant at most levels of society. Many segments of society became impoverished due to a lack of employment which was caused by the crumbling economy. Average citizens of Tbilisi started to become increasingly disillusioned with the existing quality of life in the city (and in the nation in general). Mass protests took place in November 2003 after falsified parliamentary elections forced more than 100,000 people into the streets and concluded with the Rose Revolution. Since 2003, Tbilisi has experienced considerably more stability, decreasing crime rates, improving economy, and a booming tourist industry similar to (if not more than) what the city experienced during the Soviet times. Historical demographic data As a multicultural city, Tbilisi is home to more than 100 ethnic groups. Around 89% of the population consists of ethnic Georgians, with significant populations of other ethnic groups such as Armenians, Russians, and Azeris. Along with the above-mentioned groups, Tbilisi is home to other ethnic groups including Ossetians, Abkhazians, Ukrainians, Greeks, Germans, Jews, Estonians, Kurds (yazidi and Muslim), Assyrians, and others. More than 95% of the residents of Tbilisi practice forms of Christianity (the most predominant of which is the Georgian Orthodox Church). The Russian Orthodox Church, which is in Full communion with the Georgian, and the Armenian Apostolic Church have significant following within the city as well. A large minority of the population (around 4%) practices Islam (mainly Shia Islam). About 2% of Tbilisi's population practices Judaism, there is also Roman Catholic church and Yazidism (Sultan Ezid Temple). Tbilisi has been historically known for religious tolerance. This is especially evident in the city's Old Town, where a mosque, synagogue, and Eastern and Oriental Orthodox churches can be found less than from each other.

The population based on the 2011 Census was 417. Curbar is situated a mile north of Baslow, close to Calver on the A623. The village has a street (Bar Road) with the highest average house value in Derbyshire. Close to the east are the popular rock-climbing escarpments of Curbar Edge and Baslow Edge. To the west of the village is the River Derwent. The parish church is dedicated to All Saints. Immediately to the south of the church stands Curbar Primary School, which serves the three villages of Curbar, Calver and Froggatt. The school is the custodian of an old May custom known as the Maybough. On the first of May, or as soon as possible thereafter, a tree- branch is brought into school by Edd Gregory and decorated with flowers given by the children. The Maybough is taken to various points in Curbar and Calver, where it is displayed to the accompaniment of songs and a dance which is particular to the occasion. The event is popular with both villagers, visitors and parents. Several attempts have been made to ascertain the origin of the Maybough, so far unsuccessfully. The only fact that is certain, is that the event was originally performed by the villagers rather than the school, the switchover taking place around the time of the First World War.

The supposed seer tells him he will have good fortune soon, but looking deeper relates the information that his future is blank, and he is safe only until the first snow of winter beyond which there is no future to foretell. The act upsets Jimmy and rekindles old transgressions and makes him feel he is on a collision course with destiny especially when an old friend Vincent (Shea Whigham) returns from a jail sentence that he went to in Jimmy's place after a bad business deal. Jimmy becomes obsessed with knowing more of his future and re-visits Vacaro but the old man can only tell the salesman that he has related to him all he can see. Jimmy feels that Vincent has returned to kill him and that he must do something to change the course of his future but Vacaro convinces him to accept his fate.

CPR is a fundamental component of first aid that is practiced across the world. It is an effective method of keeping a victim of cardiac arrest alive long enough for definitive treatment to be delivered, usually through defibrillation and administration of intravenous drugs such as epinephrine and amiodarone. Prior to the inception of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, there had been some techniques to keep patients alive that were developed in the 18th century, both in Japan and in Europe. However, it was not until the mid-20th century that James Elam and Peter Safar first discovered and published information about the method now known as CPR. Safar conducted research on existing basic life support procedures including controlling a person's airway by tilting back his or her head, opening their mouth by moving their chin downwards, and breathing air into the trachea. He combined these with a procedure known as closed-chest cardiac massage, which become the basic life support method known as CPR. Safar was hesitant to take credit for \\"inventing\\" CPR. In his view, he merely brought to light effective procedures that humans had already discovered, putting them together into what he called \\"the ABCs\\", which referred to maintaining a patient's airway, breathing and circulation, the basic objectives of advanced cardiac life support. He worked hard to popularize the procedure around the world and collaborated with Norwegian toy maker Asmund Laerdal to create the \\"Resusci Anne,\\" the world's first CPR training mannequin. Laerdal is currently a medical equipment manufacturer. Safar also created the first guidelines for community emergency medical services, or EMS. He founded the International Resuscitation Research Center (IRRC) at the University of Pittsburgh, which he directed until 1994, and he was nominated three times for the Nobel Prize in Medicine. First attempts at resuscitation in the 18th century In August 1767, a group of wealthy and civic-minded citizens in Amsterdam gathered to form the Society for the Recovery of Drowned Persons.Johnson A, An account of some societies at Amsterdam and Hamburg for the recovery of drowned persons, 1773, London, p. 119. This society was the first organized effort to respond to sudden death.Johnson A, An account of some societies at Amsterdam and Hamburg for the recovery of drowned persons, 1773, London, p. 119. The society's techniques involved a range of methods to resuscitate the human body. The members of the society recommended the following: # warming the victim; # removing swallowed or aspirated water by positioning the victim's head at a lower position than feet; # applying manual pressure to the abdomen; # releasing air into the victim's mouth, either using a bellows or with a mouth-to-mouth method; # tickling the victim's throat; # 'stimulating' the victim by means such as rectal and oral fumigation with tobacco smoke. Bellows were used to drive tobacco smoke, a known irritant, into the intestine through the anus, as this was thought to be enough of a stimulant to engender a response in the \\"almost\\" dead # bloodletting. Within four years of their founding, the Society for the Recovery of Drowned Persons claimed to have saved over 150 patients with their recommendations,Royal Humane Society, Annual Reports, 1787, 1788, 1789. London and the first four of these techniques, or modern variations of them, are still in use today. Following the successes of the society, rescue societies soon sprang up in most European population centers, all with the goal to find a way of successfully resuscitating victims of sudden death or cardiac arrest. This hypothesis proved so popular that the city of Hamburg in the Holy Roman Empire passed an ordinance in 1769, which provided notices to be read in churches describing the steps of assistance for drowned, strangled, and frozen persons and those overcome by noxious gases, which was the first example of mass medical training. The Royal Humane Society in London, founded in 1774, served as the model for societies in New York, Philadelphia, and Boston. These rescue societies of the 18th century were the precursors of today's emergency medical services. Similar techniques were described in early 20th century literature on jujutsu and judo with some being used as far back as early 17th century. A New York Times correspondent reported that these techniques were being used successfully deployed in Japan in 1910. In jujutsu (and later on, judo), those techniques were called kappo or kutasu.https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1910/09/04/105089392.pdf http://ejmas.com/jcs/jcsart_burgin_1203.htmhttp://www.judoinfo.com/chokes.htm Modern resuscitation Scientists and doctors started to try and address the problem from many different sides including developing new medications, devising new surgical techniques and identifying risk factors. Doctors James Elam, Peter Safar and Archer S. Gordon set to educating the world about rescue breathing, preventive measures and trying to discover a way to treat acute cardiac arrest. Gordon initially did not support rescue breathing until he performed a study of his own using pediatric patients, reproducing Elam's results. Safar had also been working on the feasibility of rescue breathing, so they agreed that a concerted effort would be much more valuable than each working separately and possibly reproducing each other's work. Prior to the 1950s, the accepted method of resuscitation was the chest-pressure and arm- lift technique that was shown to be ineffective by Safar and Elam. In 1954, Elam was the first to demonstrate experimentally that exhaled air ventilation was a sound technique. Elam and Safar (and later Gordon) performed many experiments demonstrating the superiority of the rescue breathing technique. The problem then became one of popularizing the method. Organizations such as the American Red Cross provide training at local chapters in the proper administration of artificial respiration procedures. The Red Cross has been teaching this technique since the mid-1950s. For example, in Kalamazoo, Michigan, volunteer Roger Mehalek introduced a breathing trainer called Miss Sweet Breath 1959, a plaster and plastic training mannequin he created. In New York, then State Health Commissioner, Herman Hilliboe was impressed with the technique. He commissioned Elam to write the instructional booklet titled \\"Rescue Breathing,\\" which was distributed nationally in 1959. The success of the booklet spurred Elam to produce films demonstrating this new life-saving technique. By 1960, rescue breathing had been adopted by the National Academy of Science, American Society of Anesthesiologists, Medical Society of the State of New York and the American Red Cross as the preferred method of resuscitation. Several key discoveries and understandings were required to treat the problem, which would take decades to work out, and even now is not 'solved'. Doctors speak of the natural history of diseases as a way to understand how therapy alters the usual progression of a disease. For example, the natural history of breast cancer may be measured in months but treated with surgery or chemotherapy the disease can be measured in years or even cured. Sudden cardiac arrest is a disease with an extremely rapid natural history, measured in minutes, with an inexorable outcome. But when treated with CPR the course of death can be extended (CPR will delay the dying process) and if treated with timely defibrillation death can be aborted. The modern elements of resuscitation for sudden cardiac arrest are cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR in turn consists of mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compression), defibrillation and emergency medical services (the means to bring these techniques to the patient quickly). Mouth-to-mouth ventilation For a long time before it was formalised, it had been known by doctors and midwives that mouth to mouth resuscitation could be useful in bringing a lifeless newborn around. In 1946, during the middle of a polio outbreak, an anesthesiologist, James Elam, applied this principle to an older child in an emergency situation.Elam JO, Rediscovery of expired air methods for emergency ventilation, in Advances in Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation, Peter Safar, Ed, Springer Verlag, 1977, New York, pp. 263‚Äì65. Elam described the event in his own words as \\"I was browsing around to get acquainted with the ward when along the corridor came a gurney racing ‚Äì a nurse pulling it and two orderlies pushing it, and the kid on it was blue. I went into total reflex behaviour. I stepped out in the middle of the corridor, stopped the gurney, grabbed the sheet, wiped the copious mucous off his mouth and face, ‚Ä¶ sealed my lips around his nose and inflated his lungs. In four breaths he was pink.\\" On the evening before this rediscovery, Elam read a chapter on the history of resuscitation in which mouth-to-mouth ventilation for newborns was described. He credits this chapter for his \\"reflex behaviour.\\" Elam's passion led to his proselytizing about the merits of mouth-to-nose ventilation. He set out to prove that exhaled air was adequate to oxygenate non-breathing persons. In 1951, Elam was on staff in the Department of Anesthesiology at Barnes Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri. As he was about to start his research into CO2 homeostasis, a new department chair was appointed who wanted all research in anesthesiology to be performed using animals, not humans. Elam realized this would not be feasible and moved to Buffalo's Roswell Park Memorial Institute along with his top two collaborators, Elwyn S. Brown, M.D., and Raymond H. Ten Pas, M.D. He obtained permission from his chief of surgery to do studies on postoperative patients before the ether anaesthesia wore off. In this study, he demonstrated that expired air blown into the endotracheal tube maintained normal oxygen saturation. Several years later James Elam met Peter Safar, also an anesthesiologist, convincing him to join the effort to convince the world that expired air ventilation was effective. Safar set out on a series of experiments using paralysed individuals to show that the technique could maintain adequate oxygenation.Safar P. History of cardiopulmonary-cerebral resuscitation, in Kay W and Bircher N, Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation, Churchhill Livingston, 1989, New York, pp. 1‚Äì53. Peter Safar describes the experiments: \\"Thirty-one physicians and medical students, and one nurse volunteered . . . Consent was very informed. All volunteers had to observe me ventilate anaesthetised and curarized patients without a tracheal tube. I sedated the volunteers and paralysed them for several hours each. Blood O2 and CO2 were analysed. I demonstrated the method to over 100 lay persons who were then asked to perform the method on the curarized volunteers.\\" These experiments provided compelling data to switch from manual to mouth-to-mouth ventilation. The United States military accepted and endorsed the method in 1957 and the American Medical Association followed suit in 1958 The May 17, 1958 issue of JAMA contains the following endorsement: \\"Skillful performance of expired air breathing is an easily learned, lifesaving procedure. It has revived many victims unresponsive to other methods and has been proved in real emergencies under field conditions. Information about expired air breathing should be disseminated as widely as possible\\". Chest compressions Unlike cessation of respiration, an obvious sign of sudden death, the cessation of circulation, and particularly the rhythm of the heart, is not as easy to spot for a lay observer, although a trained eye now can see signs such as lack of perfusion. Perhaps as a result of this being less obvious, the appreciation of artificial circulation as a key factor in resuscitation lagged considerably behind the obvious need for artificial respirations. If the scientists working on the problem appreciated the need to circulate blood, there was simply no effective means to do so. Even though closed chest massage was described in 1904, its benefit was not appreciated and anecdotal case reports did little to promote the benefit of closed chest massage. The prevailing belief was described in a physician's quote from 1890, \\"We are powerless against paralysis of the circulation.\\" The formalised system of chest compression was really an accidental discovery made in 1958 by William Bennett Kouwenhoven, Guy Knickerbocker, and James Jude at Johns Hopkins University. They were studying defibrillation in dogs when they noticed that by forcefully applying the paddles to the chest of the dog, they could achieve a pulse in the femoral artery. Further meticulous experimentation involving dogs answered such basic questions as how fast to press, where to press, and how deep to press. This information gave them the belief that they were ready for human trials. The first person saved with this technique was recalled by Jude: \\"She was rather an obese female who ‚Ä¶ went into cardiac arrest as a result of flurothane anesthetic. This woman had no blood pressure, no pulse, and ordinarily we would have opened up her chest. Instead, since we weren‚Äôt in the operating room, we applied external cardiac massage. Her blood pressure and pulse came back at once. We didn‚Äôt have to open her chest. They went ahead and did the operation on her, and she recovered completely.\\" In 1960 the three investigators reported their findings on 20 cases of in-hospital cardiac arrest in JAMA. Fourteen of the 20 patients (70%) survived and were discharged from the hospital. Many of the patients were in cardiac arrest as a result of anaesthesia. Three patients were documented to be in ventricular fibrillation. The duration of chest compression varied from less than 1 minute to 65 minutes. The JAMA article was very straightforward: chest compression buys time until the external defibrillator arrives on the scene. As the authors write in the article, \\"Anyone, anywhere, can now initiate cardiac resuscitative procedures. All that is needed is two hands\\". However, respiration received relatively little attention in the 1960 JAMA article. Many of the patients had been intubated and thus the need for mouth-to-mouth ventilation was not necessary. It was not long however, before this newly discovered technique was used in conjunction with the longer held techniques of artificial respiration. The use of compression and ventilation together The formal connection of chest compression with mouth-to-mouth ventilation to create CPR as it is practiced today occurred when Safar, Jude, and Kouwenhoven presented their findings at the annual Maryland Medical Society meeting on September 16, 1960 in Ocean City. In the opening remarks the moderator said, \\"Our purpose today is to bring to you, then, this new idea.\\" It was so new that it was still without a name. The moderator stated that the two techniques \\"cannot be considered any longer as separate units, but as parts of a whole and complete approach to resuscitation\\". In his remarks Safar stressed the importance of combining ventilation and circulation. He presented convincing data that chest compression alone did not provide effective ventilation; mouth-to-mouth respiration had to be part of the equation. To promote CPR, Jude, Knickerbocker, and Safar began a world speaking tour. In 1962 Gordon, along with David Adams, produced a 27-minute training film called \\"The Pulse of Life.\\" The film was used in CPR classes and viewed by millions of students. For the film, Gordon and Adams devised the easy to remember mnemonic of A, B & C standing for the sequence of steps in CPR, airway, breathing, circulation. However the order has been revised to C, A, B, putting the emphasis on compressions first. The reason being that oxygen reserves in the body have been found to be adequate to maintain oxygenation of the blood. In 1963 cardiologist Leonard Scherlis started the American Heart Association's CPR Committee, and in the same year, the Heart Association formally endorsed CPR. In May 1966 the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences convened an ad hoc conference on cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The conference was the direct result of requests from the American National Red Cross and other agencies to establish standardized training and performance standards for CPR. Over 30 national organizations were represented at the conference. Recommendations from this conference were reported in JAMA in 1966. Defibrillation As early as the 1930s it was known that electric shocks, even small shocks, could induce ventricular fibrillation in dogs' hearts and more powerful shocks could reverse the fibrillation. This early research had been funded by the electric industry concerned about fatal accidents to linemen. Claude Beck, professor of surgery at Western Reserve University (later to become Case Western Reserve University) in Cleveland worked for years on a technique for defibrillation of the human heart. Beck believed that electricity could equally benefit the surgery patient whose heart fibrillated during surgery or induction of anaesthesia. Beck probably witnessed his first cardiac arrest during his internship in 1922 while on the surgery service at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. During a urologic operation, the anaesthetist announced that the patient's heart had stopped. To the amazement of Beck, the surgical resident removed his gloves and went to a telephone in a corner of the room and called the fire department. Beck remained in total bewilderment as the fire department rescue squad rushed into the operating room 15 minutes later and applied oxygen- powered respirators to the patient's face. The patient died, but the episode left an indelible impression on him. Beck would go on to develop techniques to take back the management of cardiac arrest from the fire department and place it in the hands of surgeons. Beck realized that ventricular fibrillation often occurred in hearts that were basically sound and he coined the phrase \\"Hearts too good to die.\\" In 1947, Beck accomplished his first successful resuscitation of a 14-year-old boy using open chest massage and internal defibrillation with alternating current. The boy was being operated on for a severe congenital funnel chest. In all other respects the boy was normal. During the closure of the large incision in the chest, the pulse suddenly stopped and the blood pressure fell to zero. The boy was in cardiac arrest. Dr. Beck immediately reopened the chest and began manual heart massage. As he looked at and felt the heart, he realized that ventricular fibrillation was present. Massage was continued for 35 minutes at which time an electrocardiogram was taken that confirmed the presence of ventricular fibrillation. Another 10 minutes passed before the defibrillator was brought to the operating room. The first shock using electrode paddles placed directly on the sides of the heart was unsuccessful. Beck administered procaine amide, a medicine to stabilize the heart's rhythm. Beck gave a second shock that wiped out the fibrillation. In a very few seconds a feeble, regular, and fast contraction of the heart occurred. The blood pressure rose from zero to 50 millimeters of mercury. Beck noted that the heartbeat remained regular and saw that the pressure slowly began to rise. Twenty minutes after the successful defibrillation, the chest wound was closed. By three hours, the blood pressure rose to a normal level, and the child awoke and was able to answer questions. The boy made a full recovery, with no neurological damage. Beck pioneered internal defibrillation of the heart. In other words, the chest had to be open and the defibrillator paddles placed directly on the heart. It was ground breaking work but soon to be eclipsed by devices that could externally defibrillate the heart through the closed chest. For Paul Zoll, well aware of Beck's accomplishment, the development of an external defibrillator was a natural extension of his earlier work with an external cardiac pacemaker In 1955 a 67-year-old man survived several episodes of ventricular fibrillation, thanks to Zoll's external defibrillator, and went home from the hospital a month later. Over a period of four months, Zoll had successfully stopped ventricular fibrillation eleven times in four different patients. The energy required for defibrillation ranged from 240 to 720 joules. Zoll's findings were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1956. The defibrillator designed by Zoll, as well as earlier versions invented by Kouwenhoven and Beck, utilized alternating current and were run from line voltage, the electricity from any wall socket. The decision to use alternating current rather than direct current was a practical one. Direct current batteries and capacitor technology both powerful enough to do the job and portable enough for practical use simply didn't exist in the early 1950s. These AC defibrillators were very large and heavy, primarily because they contained a transformer to step up the line voltage from to 500 or . The only good feature is that they could be mounted on wheels and pushed down the hallway from one part of the hospital to another. Not many lives would be saved unless the inherent non-portability of AC defibrillators could be solved. The portability problem was solved by Bernard Lown. Lown devised a defibrillator that utilized direct current instead of alternating current. A series of animal experiments on dogs in 1960 and 1961 and clinical uses in patients in the early 1960s established that DC shocks were extremely effective in shocking the heart.Lown B, Cardioversion of arrhythmias Modern Concepts of Cardiovascular Diseases, American Heart Association 1964; 33:863‚Äì68. What's more, it was clear that DC was actually safer than AC when applied through the chest wall. With direct current it was possible to use power, supplied by a battery, to charge a capacitor over a few seconds. The capacitor stored the energy until it was released in one massive jolt to the chest wall. The availability of new, small capacitors considerably reduced the size and weight of the device. The defibrillator could now travel to the patient. The first out of hospital defibrillation The National Highway Safety and Traffic Act of 1966 authorized the Department of Transportation to establish a national curriculum for prehospital personnel, which led to the training of emergency medical technicians (EMTs). EMTs did much to upgrade the general performance of ambulance services throughout the United States. Their 80-hour course and certification, which included CPR, ensured that proper care would be provided to victims of motor vehicle accidents and other emergencies. Thus they could provide artificial ventilation and closed-chest massage at the scene and en route to the hospital. However, EMTs were neither trained nor authorised to provide definitive care for cardiac arrest. They could not provide defibrillation; intravenous medications; or advanced airway control, such as endotracheal intubation. EMTs saved few, if any, victims of sudden cardiac arrest, largely because cardiac arrest occurred mostly in people's homes. The time required for EMTs to arrive and transport the patient to the closest emergency department was too long for resuscitation to be successful. Not even letter-perfect CPR can save a life if it takes too long for defibrillation and other advanced procedures to occur. In 1965, Frank Pantridge turned his attention to this vexing problem of heart attacks and sudden cardiac death. His sensitivity to the problem came from two sources. First, personnel in the emergency department of the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast frequently commented on the number of patients coming in dead on arrival (DOA). Second, Pantridge had recently read a telling study in a medical journal that indicated that among middle-aged or younger men with acute myocardial infarction (MI), more than 60% died within 1 hour of the onset of symptoms. Thus the problem of death from acute MI had to be solved outside the hospital, not in the emergency room or the coronary care unit. \\"The majority of deaths from coronary attacks were occurring\\", he wrote, \\"outside the hospital, and nothing whatever was being done about them. It became very clear to me that a coronary care unit confined to the hospital would have a minimal impact on mortality.\\" He wanted his coronary-care unit in the community. Pantridge's solution was to develop the world's first mobile coronary-care unit, or MCCU. He staffed it with an ambulance driver, a physician, and a nurse. Pantridge encountered numerous obstacles to the creation of the MCCU. He dealt with them in his typical direct fashion, with determination to succeed and transparent contempt for politicians and any authority figure who opposed him. Even his cardiology colleagues were skeptical. \\"My noncardiological medical colleagues in the hospital were totally unconvinced and totally uncooperative,\\" Pantridge said. \\"It was considered unorthodox, if not illegal, to send junior hospital personnel, doctors, and nurses outside the hospital.\\" Pantridge's new program began service on January 1, 1966. John Geddes was a resident in cardiology at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast and worked on Pantridge's service. As junior member of the team it was Geddes' responsibility, which he shared with four other residents on the service, to ride on the newly christened ambulance when it was called into service. Why did this breakthrough in cardiac care occur in Belfast, of all places? Geddes thought he knew the answer: \\"I would say two reasons. One was Pantridge himself. He is a remarkable personality who is very persuasive. He can persuade people to do things, and . . . actually make them enjoy doing things that he has made them do because they are successful. So there was his tremendous enthusiasm behind the system. Then there was the fact that the layout of the [Royal Victoria] hospital was flat and it was quick and easy to get to people and resuscitate them. I didn't realize this at the time, but I subsequently visited hospitals in various parts of England. They had slow elevators and so on, and you could never move around the hospital quickly with any kind of emergency apparatus.\\" The success in the hospital wards made them believe success in the community would be possible. So it was the combination of a hospital's architectural layout and a physician's driving and persuasive personality that provided the impetus for this breakthrough. But one cannot discount the resuscitation infrastructure already in place: mouth-to-mouth ventilation, chest compression, and portable defibrillation. Without each of these three elements the Belfast program would have been a waste of time and effort. The team reported the initial results of their program in the August 5, 1967 issue of The Lancet; their findings on 312 patients covered a 15-month period. Half the patients had MI and there were no deaths during transportation. Of ground-breaking importance was the information on 10 patients who had cardiac arrest. All had ventricular fibrillation; six arrests occurred after the arrival of the MCCU, and four occurred shortly before arrival of the ambulance. All 10 patients were resuscitated and admitted to the hospital. Five were subsequently discharged alive. The article has historical importance because it served to stimulate pre-hospital emergency cardiac care programs throughout the world. The Belfast system was established to reach patients with acute myocardial infarction. The resuscitated patients were those whose hearts fibrillated after the ambulance was at the scene or en route. The system reacted too slowly to resuscitate persons who fibrillated before the call was placed. In 1966, it was assumed that most cardiac deaths in the community were the result of acute myocardial infarction. It was not appreciated that ventricular fibrillation can occur without myocardial infarction and have only seconds of warning ‚Äì or none at all.  The development of Emergency medical services  The extensive international readership of the Lancet helps explain why Pantridge's idea spread so rapidly to other countries. Within 2 years, similar physician staffed MCCU programs began in Australia and Europe. The first program in the United States was started in 1968 by William Grace out of St. Vincent's Hospital in Greenwich Village in New York City. The program was a clone of the Belfast program and utilized specially equipped ambulances with physicians on board to provide advanced resuscitation care directly at the scene of cardiac emergencies. Calls for medical emergencies in which chest pain was a complaint were passed on from the police 911 operator to the hospital. There an ambulance would fight New York traffic to arrive at the scene. Grace described the rather full ambulance and how it was sent: \\"The personnel includes an attending physician, resident physician, emergency room nurse, ECG technician, as well as a student nurse observer, in addition to the driver and his assistant. This team is summoned from various points in the hospital to the emergency room by a personal paging system which each member of the team carries. This team has four and one half minutes to get to the emergency room, obtain their equipment and board the ambulance. Anyone who is not there within this time is left behind.\\" In a scientific report of the St. Vincent's program, Grace described the experience with the first 161 patients (ref). Only two instances occurred in which the physician did not make the 4¬Ω-minute deadline and the ambulance left without the physician. The ambulance reached the scene usually within 14 minutes, plus of course the 4¬Ω-minute pre-response time. One call took 25 minutes owing to heavy traffic. Among the first group of patients seen by the MCCU were three patients treated for ventricular fibrillation. One of the three survived. Grace took this concept, imported from overseas, and made it work in his community. Physicians with defibrillators rushing through the city to reach a non-breathing, unconscious person whose heart had stopped were quite unusual by 1968 standards. However, the program was limited in vision, and although it could work in some communities, it was not nationally applicable. An evolution in prehospital emergency care was needed. The evolution from physician-staffed mobile intensive care units to paramedic-staffed units in the United States occurred independently and almost simultaneously in several communities. Two communities that led the way were Miami and Seattle, but others included Portland, Oregon, Los Angeles, and Columbus, Ohio. These communities were a major evolutional advance compared to the Belfast or New York City programs. Not only were paramedics used instead of physicians, but from their inception the programs were established to deal with the problem of sudden cardiac arrest. Pantridge's program was established primarily to reach the victim of MI fast and thereby prevent mortality in the vulnerable early stage of this event. Thus cardiac arrest was successfully treated only if it occurred as a complication of MI and only if the ambulance was already at the scene or en route. The new paramedic programs were far more nimble than physician-based programs and were specifically designed not only to treat the early stages of MI, but also to attempt resuscitation for sudden cardiac arrest wherever and whenever it occurred. Reversal of death itself would be a major purpose and goal of the new paramedic programs. Eugene Nagel became aware of Pantridge's work in 1967. He believed that the physician-staffed model of prehospital care was not going to work for the United States in general or for Miami in particular. Physicians were too expensive to sit around fire stations waiting for calls, and if they had to be picked up in hospitals, it would take too long to arrive at the scene. When Nagel or his colleague James Hirschman, rode on the ambulance themselves they could, of course, defibrillate and provide medications, but they could not be present on all shifts. Nagel became convinced it was time to move away from a program using physicians to one staffed by paramedics. Nagel moved incrementally. He did not think he could initially sell the idea of paramedics working alone, even if they had authorization to perform medical procedures signed by physicians. So instead his first step was to establish a radio link and telemetry between the paramedic fire fighters and the hospital. Nagel's had a hidden agenda in promoting telemetry. For Nagel it gained him access through the legal impediments stopping fire fighters from defibrillating patients and administering medications. Nagel reasoned that if the fire department could send the ECG signal to the hospital via telemetry, then the fire fighters (with special training) could be authorized by the physician to administer needed drugs and procedures before arriving in the emergency department. He believed a paramedic at the scene was a legal extension of a physician. He recalled later, \\"We saw telemetry as the key to extending our treatment to outside the hospital where hitherto trying to legislate it was the dark side of the moon in those days. The telemetry looked like it might be the 'open sesame' to doing some treatment pre-hospital.\\" Nagel hoped to find support from the medical community; instead he only encountered discouragement. Nagel recalled this opposition, \\"It was a rare doctor that favored us doing any of this stuff ‚Äì very rare. We had incidents in the street when we were just sending an ECG, where doctors on the scene would tell the firemen to quit fooling around and haul the victim in.\\" Nagel recalled the first save of the Miami paramedic program. The collapse occurred near Station 1, on the fringe of downtown Miami. He reminisced: \\"There was a guy named Dan Jones who was then about 60 years old, who was a wino who lived in a fleabag in the bad part of town. Jones was well known to rescue. In June of '69 they got a call ‚Äì man down ‚Äì it was Jones. They put the paddles on him, he was in VF, started CPR, zapped him, he came back to sinus rhythm, brought him into ER and three days later he was out and walking around. In gratitude, about a week later, he came down to Station 1, which he had never done before, and he said he would like to talk to the man who saved his life. They told me they had never seen Dan Jones in a clean shirt and sober, both of which he was that day. He would periodically come to the fire house and just say hello and he seemed to be sober. In my talks in those days I said this was the new cure for alcoholism. That was our first true save.\\" Pantridge's article also energized Leonard Cobb in Seattle. He knew the Seattle Fire Department was already involved in first aid and therefore approached the Fire Chief, Gordon Vickery, to propose a new training program to treat cardiac arrest. The fire department already had one of the United States' first computerized systems for documenting first aid runs. Cobb realized that this system could provide scientific documentation for the efficacy (or lack thereof) of Pantridge's suggestions and suggested to Vickery that they pool their knowledge and resources. Cobb and his colleagues then provided instruction and training in cardiac emergencies including cardiac arrest to volunteer fire fighters. The program became operational in March 1970, nine months after Nagel's first save in Miami. The mobile unit was stationed outside the Harborview Hospital emergency department. As Cobb himself points out, the mobile unit was not the real innovation. Rather, it was the concept of a tiered response to medical emergencies. The idea was \\"that we would get someone out there quickly\\" ‚Äì via the fire department's already existing mobile first aid units ‚Äì \\"and then a secondary response would come from the mobile intensive coronary care unit.\\" The beauty of the tiered response system was the efficient use of fire department personnel, which allowed aid personnel to reach the scene quickly (on an average of three minutes) to start CPR. Then a few minutes later the paramedics arrived to provide more definitive care such as defibrillation. In this way the brain could be kept alive until the electric shock converted the heart to a normal rhythm. After stabilization the paramedics would transport the patient to the hospital. The Seattle paramedic program did more than pioneer paramedics and promote the tiered response system. It was the first program in the world to make citizens part of the emergency system. Cobb knew from data the program had collected that the sooner CPR was started, the better the chances of survival. He reasoned that the best way to ensure early initiation of CPR was to train the bystanders. Thus Cobb, with the support of Vickery, began a program in 1972 called Medic 2. Its goal was to train over 100,000 people in Seattle how to do CPR. Cobb recalled how the idea was first proposed: One day Vickery said, \\"Look, if it's so important to get CPR started quickly and if firemen come around to do it, it can't be that complicated that other folks couldn't also learn ‚Äì firemen are not created by God to do CPR. You could train the public.\\" Cobb said, \\"That sounds like a very good idea.\\" Cobb decided to use an abbreviated course of training. \\"We weren't going to do it by traditional ways where they had to come for 20 hours (of training). So they had to do it at one sitting ‚Äì how long will people participate? ‚Äì well, maybe three hours and that's pretty much the way it was.\\" Cobb cautiously did not state how long it would take to train 100,000 people. He had no idea. In fact it took only a few years and by the 20th anniversary of the citizen training program over half a million people in Seattle and the surrounding suburbs had received training in CPR. Some people were sceptical about mass citizen training in CPR; indeed, many felt the potential for harm was too great to allow such a procedure in the hands of laypersons. The skeptics also had the support of national medical organizations. The alarmist voices were stilled by some fortunate saves. Cobb recalled one resuscitation soon after the citizen training program began. \\"In March 1973 there were these kids playing golf at Jackson Park. They came across a victim a quarter of a mile from the clubhouse.\\" The man was unconscious and not breathing; later it was confirmed that he was in ventricular fibrillation. \\"But these kids had taken the [CPR] course over at the local high school. Two or three of them started doing CPR and the other kid ran off and phoned the fire department. Shortly they came with the aid car and Medic 1 screaming over the fairways.\\" Cobb concluded, \\"They got him started up again. He survived; he's alive today [1990]. That was a very convincing story. I didn't mind it being written up in the Reader's Digest.\\" Recent developments in CPR By the early 1970s CPR, defibrillation, and a rapid means to provide prehospital care were all in place. The structure to resuscitate sudden death victims had been built and was proving successful. That most of the world did not have this structure in place in the 1970s was largely due to lack of diffusion and spread of the ideas, rather than the impossibility of carrying them out. However, the story of resuscitation does not stop in the early 1970s. Major advances have continued. In 1980 the first program to train EMTs to perform defibrillation began in King County, Washington, and similar programs spread throughout the United States. This training required 10 hours, and in the first demonstration project, survival from ventricular fibrillation increased from 7% to 26%. In 1984 the first program with fire fighter EMTs using automated external defibrillators (AEDs) also began in King County, Washington. The use of AEDs simplified the training of EMTs and thus allowed the procedure to spread more rapidly throughout communities. Automated external defibrillators require considerably less training time compared to manual defibrillators since the EMT does not have to interpret the cardiac rhythm. The idea for an automated defibrillator was first conceived by Dr. Arch Diack, a surgeon in Portland, Oregon. During the early 1970s, Dr. Diack and Dr. W. Stanley Welborn developed a portable unit called a Cardiac Automatic Resuscitative Device [CARD] that could diagnose a heart that was stopped or fibrillating and deliver an electrical shock capable of restarting it. The device, which later became known as 'Heart-Aid', was programmed to diagnose specific problems. It was designed for temporary use by laymen in emergency situations before professional care could be administered. Arch Diack was the first person to conceive of an automated electronic defibrillator. His prototype, literally assembled in a basement, utilized a unique defibrillatory pathway ‚Äì tongue to chest, via a plastic airway with an electrode mounted on it. Using this \\"Esophageal Pathway\\" proved less traumatic for tissues and used a smaller electrical charge. There was also a breath detector, that was a safeguard to prevent shocking breathing persons. The electrode was essentially a rate counter, far cruder than today's sophisticated VF detectors. All in all, a seemingly more efficient treatment. Arch Diack, MD, Craig Berkman, Atty, Scott Dean and Brad Jeffries, Engineers, Vickie Dean, Circuit Board and Mechanical Assembler and Barbara Corl (Moore), FDA Documentation & Corporate Administration and Records, built the first production units in a small, two room, rented space in an office-building in Sylvan, Oregon, just outside of Portland. Later as the company grew they moved to an Office Park in Lake Oswego, Oregon. The first production model weighed 17 pounds - the design parameter was \\"size similarity to that of a portable typewriter\\" of the day. It used a tape recorder to give verbal instructions to the Laymen, as well as to record the event, for study, research and legal requirements. It had a foam pad with printed instructions and diagrams with an electrode, for the bystander/layman to apply to the patient's chest. Insert airway then \\"hands off\\" warning and the machine, did the rest. Miraculous for it's time. By the late 1980s, the small company, named CRC (Cardiac Resuscitator Corp.) was in Lake Oswego, Oregon, and had been purchased by Emerson Radio, The CRC production teams were dedicated and extremely excited every time a new tape from an 'event' came in. It was not uncommon to have the team display intense emotions and responses, both positive and negative, based on the results of these tapes. In the mid 1980s, the idea had taken hold, and other manufacturers began entering the field, leading to the automated external defibrillators (AEDs) that we have today. Current AEDs, like regular defibrillators, use electrode pads attached to the chest. AEDs are programmed to guide the operator (with a series of voice prompts) through the procedure. The pads once attached automatically detect the type of heart rhythm and if VF is present the AED instructs the operator to press a button (usually flashing red) to shock the patient. From EMT defibrillation with AEDs, there was a natural and logical progression to first responder defibrillation (AEDs used by police or security personnel), next widespread Public Access Defibrillation (AEDs used by lay persons in public locations such as airports, schools, exercise facilities, etc.) and finally home AED including the opportunity to purchase AEDs over the counter without a prescription. In 1981 a program to provide telephone instructions in CPR began in King County, Washington. This program used the emergency dispatchers to give instant directions while the fire department EMT personnel were in route to the scene. This demonstration project increased the rate of bystander-provided CPR by 50%. Dispatcher- assisted CPR is now standard care for dispatcher centers throughout the United States and in other countries such as Israel, Great Britain, Sweden, and Norway. The American Heart Association uses and a metaphor of four links in a chain to describe the elements of successful resuscitation. These links are early access (recognizing cardiac arrest and calling 911), early CPR, early defibrillation, and early advanced care (such as medications, endotracheal intubation) The early paramedic programs were all designed to provide CPR, defibrillation, and advanced care quickly enough to resuscitate patients in cardiac arrest. CPR has continued to advance, with recent developments including an emphasis on constant, rapid heart stimulation, without respiration. Studies have shown that people who had rapid, constant hands-only chest compression 22% more likely to survive than those receiving conventional, CPR that included breathing. What's more, because people tend to be reluctant to do mouth-to-mouth, chest-only CPR nearly doubles the chances of survival overall, by increasing the odds of receiving CPR in the first place.USA Today American Heart Association revises CPR guidelines An analysis of 3,700 cardiac arrests published Friday in the journal Lancet found that hands-only CPR saved 22% more lives than the conventional method. All told, the switch could save up to 3,000 additional lives a year in the US and 5,000 to 10,000 in North America and Europe, says lead author Peter Nagele of Washington University in St. Louis. A landmark study published Oct. 6 in The Journal of the American Medical Association found that bystanders who applied hands-only CPR were able to boost survival to 34% from 18% for those who got conventional CPR or none at all. In addition, the percentage of people willing to provide CPR rose from 28% in 2005 to 40% in 2009. Further advanced technologies to supplement CPR are being tested. These include the use of drones to deliver defibrillators to patients undergoing CPR outside hospital, as well as placing patients in whom CPR is ongoing but cardiac rhythm cannot be restored onto heart-lung bypass (ECMO) machines. This then allows them to be transported to specialist centres where the cause of their cardiac arrest (a blocked coronary artery for example) can be addressed. So called 'ECMO-CPR' may yet further revolutionize the way in which CPR is delivered. Trials of pre-hospital ECMO-CPR in France and Australia have been promising.

It was originally composed of Elijah Burke and Marcus Cor Von. Matt Striker, Kevin Thorn, and Ariel first joined the stable in February 2007, then CM Punk briefly joined the stable in April 2007. The faction was created to feud with wrestlers who had been a part of the original Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) promotion in the 1990s. WWE revived ECW as a third brand in 2006, and hired several former ECW wrestlers ‚Äì the ECW Originals ‚Äì to compete on the brand. In early 2007, the New Breed was created when Vince McMahon, the WWE chairman, touted Burke and Cor Von as the epitome of the new ECW, while insulting the ECW Originals. Striker, Thorn, and Ariel joined the following week. The New Breed instantly began feuding with the ECW Originals. They faced off in several matches throughout the year, including at WrestleMania 23. After this, both groups began recruiting CM Punk, who elected to join the New Breed. Two weeks later however, he turned on Burke during a match. Thorn and Ariel left the stable shortly afterward as well. The New Breed continued to feud with the Originals and Punk, and also with The Major Brothers, a new tag team who had defeated Striker and Cor Von in their debut match. By June 2007, the stable had dissolved, with the three remaining members quietly separating. Concept World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) acquired Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) and its video library in 2003, and later began reintroducing ECW by utilizing ECW library content for DVDs and releasing a series of books. The popularity of ECW merchandise prompted WWE to organize an ECW reunion pay- per-view, ECW One Night Stand, in 2005. WWE organized a second One Night Stand pay-per-view the following year. In May 2006 WWE announced the launch of ECW as a stand-alone brand, congruous to Raw and SmackDown!, with its own show on the Sci Fi channel. In preparation for the launch of the ECW brand, WWE hired several original ECW wrestlers, including Sabu, The Sandman, and Balls Mahoney. It was also announced that wrestlers who had previously worked for ECW before joining WWE following its closure, including Rob Van Dam and Tommy Dreamer, would be moving to the new ECW brand. The term \\"new breed\\" was originally used to describe the revived ECW brand as a whole, with advertisements and articles using the tagline \\"A new breed unleashed\\". In early 2007, the term began to be used as the name for a new stable (faction) on the new ECW brand, which consisted solely of wrestlers that had not been a part of the original ECW. This stable quickly began feuding with the ECW Originals ‚Äì wrestlers who had been part of the original ECW. History Elijah Burke was the leader of The New Breed Formation On January 30, 2007, Vince McMahon, the chairman of WWE, appeared on ECW on Sci Fi. In several backstage segments, he showed disdain for wrestlers that were a part of the original ECW ‚Äì the ECW Originals. While demeaning the Originals, McMahon simultaneously showed appreciation for newer wrestlers, calling Marcus Cor Von \\"a breath of fresh air\\" and bringing Elijah Burke to the ring with him to tout Burke as the epitome of the new ECW. As a result, Tommy Dreamer, Balls Mahoney, Sabu, and The Sandman interrupted and attacked Burke, provoking a feud. The next week, McMahon appeared on ECW again, insulting Dreamer, Mahoney, Sabu, The Sandman, and Rob Van Dam, before informing them that they would be fired if they interfered in each other's matches that night. Matt Striker and Kevin Thorn, along with his valet Ariel, joined forces with Burke and Cor Von as the New Breed. Striker was named the special guest referee for Thorn's match with Dreamer that night, and refused to count a pinfall for Dreamer, allowing Thorn to win. Burke defeated Van Dam later in the night, and the New Breed members attacked Van Dam until they were chased off by the other ECW Originals. The feud continued throughout March and April, with the factions facing off against each other in several singles and tag team matches. In early March, Dreamer challenged the New Breed to a match at WrestleMania 23 on behalf of the Originals. The following week, Dreamer won a battle royal featuring members of the New Breed and the Originals. In the final weeks leading up to WrestleMania, the stables continued to clash, with Van Dam defeating Burke on the March 27 episode of ECW. This provoked an attack on Van Dam by the other New Breed members, until the Originals made the save. At WrestleMania, the New Breed members lost to the ECW Originals in an eight-man tag team match, but on the following episode of ECW on Sci Fi, they defeated the ECW Originals in an extreme rules rematch. Recruiting CM Punk CM Punk was recruited by both the New Breed and the ECW Originals Just prior to WrestleMania, both the New Breed and the ECW Originals began attempting to recruit CM Punk into their stables. On the April 3 episode of ECW, Cor Von eventually told Punk to choose a side, stating that Punk was either with the New Breed or against them. The following week, Punk made his decision and joined the New Breed, shaking hands with Burke in the ring. The next week, his presence immediately created tension within the group, as he berated Cor Von and Thorn for losing and undermined Burke's position as the leader of the New Breed. Later that episode, Burke faced Van Dam in a singles match. Punk attempted to interfere, sliding a steel chair into the ring, but Van Dam got to it first and hit Burke with it. Afterward, Punk apologized to Burke. The following week, Punk apologized again, but was forced by Burke to miss an eight-man elimination tag team match between the Originals and the New Breed. In retaliation, Punk attacked Burke, causing him to lose the match, and left the New Breed, before defecting to the side of the ECW Originals. The following week, on the May 1 episode of ECW, Burke announced a match between Thorn and Punk, which Thorn lost. After the match, Thorn quit the New Breed, as none of the other members interfered during the match to help him. That same night, Striker and Cor Von lost to the debuting tag team of The Major Brothers (Brian and Brett). Striker was pinned and as a result, Burke blamed Striker, berating him for the loss and creating tension between the two. The following week, Cor Von defeated Punk in a singles match following interference from Burke, and Burke defeated one-half of The Major Brothers, Brian. Punk gained revenge at the Judgment Day pay-per-view in late May however, when he defeated Burke in a singles match. On the next episode of ECW, Striker defeated Brett Major while Burke and Cor Von lost to the team of Van Dam and Punk by disqualification when Cor Von attacked Punk despite not being the legal man in the match. After this, Van Dam was moved into a feud with Randy Orton and Punk joined forces with Dreamer and The Sandman to replace Sabu, who had left WWE in mid-May. At the One Night Stand pay-per-view in June, Burke, Cor Von, and Striker lost to Punk, Dreamer, and The Sandman in a tables match. Dissolution and aftermath In mid-2007, the New Breed was phased out as a group. Cor Von and Burke remained loosely aligned and teamed together on a few occasions until mid-June. After this, Cor Von took an extended leave of absence before being released from the company in September. Burke remained part of ECW and received a push in late June and July, challenging for the ECW World Championship on several occasions. Throughout the remainder of 2007 and most of 2008, he was rarely used in a prominent role and was released in November 2008. Ariel was released from WWE on May 18, shortly after she and Thorn left the New Breed. Thorn remained on ECW for several months, but was sent to WWE's developmental territory in early 2008. He was eventually released from his contract in early 2009. Following his release, he criticized the storylines in which the stable was involved, especially the fact that the stable was used to push CM Punk, stating that it \\"could have been done differently\\". Fertig also felt that there was \\"so much more\\" that could have done with the stable, due to \\"eclectic\\" mix of people involved. Following the dissolution of the New Breed, Striker began managing wrestler Big Daddy V until 2008. He later transitioned into a commentator role in August 2008, and worked in a variety of roles, including as the host of WWE NXT and a backstage interviewer, until WWE opted not to renew his contract in June 2013. CM Punk won the ECW Championship in September 2007 and, after leaving the ECW brand in 2008, he went on to become a three-time World Heavyweight Champion, as well as a two-time WWE Champion. He departed WWE in 2014 and subsequently signed with UFC later that year.

The English translation of the Spanish phrase, \\"fin del camino\\", is end of the road.Prison Break: 2.21 \\"Fin Del Camino\\" Spoilers and Possible Season 3 Spoilers, BuddyTV. March 19, 2007. Retrieved on July 11, 2007. Written by Matt Olmstead and Seth Hoffman, and directed by Bobby Roth, the episode first aired on March 26, 2007. The premise of the episode directly follows the events of the previous episode and includes two major plots with one taking place in Panama City and the other in Chicago. Regarding the casting of this episode, Rockmond Dunbar (who plays Benjamin Miles \\"C-Note\\" Franklin), does not appear in this episode. Summary It is the third day of the trial of Doctor Sara Tancredi (Sarah Wayne Callies) in Chicago, Illinois. Despite objections from the prosecution, the judge allowed excerpts of Michael and Lincoln's \\"Declaration of Innocence\\" to be played for the jury and to be used as evidence. Meanwhile, Paul Kellerman (Paul Adelstein) hears about Sara's trial via a news report as he prepares to commit suicide. When his suicide attempt fails, due to his gun jamming, he calls his sister, who he confesses to about his previous misdeeds. Kristine (Tina Holmes) convinces him to start anew and that he can undo his wrongs. Paul Kellerman breaks into tears, as his sister embraces him tightly. As Sara prepares herself to accept a plea bargain that will place her in a maximum security prison for twelve years, one of her lawyers announces that a new credible witness has come forward, willing to testify to Sara's accusation of conspiracy. To Sara's surprise, Paul Kellerman enters the courtroom. Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell) finds himself alone aboard the 'Christina Rose', docked in Panama and realizes his brother has gone to Panama City to find T-Bag (Robert Knepper). Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller) arrives in Panama City and quickly finds T-Bag at the Fin Del Camino hotel. He spots two undercover agents surveilling T-Bag. He is then met by Fernando Sucre (Amaury Nolasco) and Brad Bellick (Wade Williams). As Bellick brandishes his gun on Michael, Michael is told by Sucre that he had not posted the message on Europeangoldfinch.net. Michael puts two and two together and realizes the situation is a setup. Bellick and Michael reach a deal; while Bellick will get the money, Maricruz Delgado is to be unharmed and that T-Bag must be captured. On his way to Panama City, Agent Alexander Mahone (William Fichtner) calls his wife, Pam (Callie Thorne). Their conversation leaves him with hope that he, his wife and his son might return to being a family again. Following this, Mahone makes telephone contact with the men surveilling T-Bag. After setting off the fire alarm which forces T-Bag to leave the hotel, Michael, Sucre and Bellick stalk the two agents following T-Bag down a busy Panama City street. When Mahone attempts to join the fray, Lincoln suddenly strikes Mahone and drags him out of sight. The two fight, which Lincoln wins, before Mahone suddenly attacks him again and successfully captures him. After T-Bag enters a building, Michael, Sucre and Bellick disarm the agents, who were following T-Bag, and eventually tie them up in an alley. Although Michael is suspicious of the two agents, he follows Sucre and Bellick into the building. It turns out to be a trap when T-Bag locks them in a room with a murdered prostitute as the police sirens draw near. They escape but Bellick is shot in the leg by T-Bag and is hindered from moving. As Bellick gets arrested by the Panamanian police, Michael and Sucre successfully capture T-Bag after he is hit by a car. While Sucre looks for a car, T-Bag refuses to reply Michael's questions about his \\"new friends\\". Sucre successfully hotwires an automobile and the three begin their trip to the American embassy, where they will leave T-Bag. However, T-Bag grabs a nearby screwdriver and stabs Sucre, which causes Michael to crash their car. Leaving Sucre to a bystander to take him to a hospital, Michael chases T-Bag to a shack by a river. The two fight before Michael stabs T-Bag in his right arm and nails it to the floor. The police arrive at the shack, the police arrest T-Bag. After Michael leaves with the money and returns to the 'Christina Rose' to find his brother missing. As he attempts to make telephone inquiries to local hospitals to find Sucre, Michael receives a call from Lincoln. Lincoln tells Michael that he is sorry before giving Mahone the phone. Mahone tells Michael that he had captured Lincoln and that he needs to disappear as well. He gives Michael an ultimatum; his ship and the five million dollars (his plan) for his brother's life. Reception On its original airdate, the episode was watched by an average of 8.01 million viewers, which was one of the lowest audience figures received by the series. In total viewership, the show was ranked behind ABC's Dancing With the Stars and a repeat episode of Deal or No Deal on NBC in its 8:00 pm timeslot. Overall, the episode obtained 5.2% household rating and 8% household share, with a 3.3/9 rating for the 18-49 demographic.Broadcast TV Ratings for Monday, March 26, 2007, Entertainmentnow.wordpress.com.

Click to talk requests are most commonly made on websites but can also be initiated by hyperlinks placed in email, blogs, wikis, flash animations or video, and other Internet-based object or user interfaces. Click-to-call also known as Click-to-Talk or Web Call Real Time Communications Basics Click-to-call (CTC) is actually a misleading name for three variations of this technology depending on the implementation and what device the customer is using: from a computer's or from a Smartphone. Traditional From a computer:' a web consumer click the link and fills in a form to ask a website operator to call her. In other words in this case, \\"click-to-call\\" would be more accurately referred to as \\"Request-a-Call,\\" as in \\"Please give me a call (here is my phone number).\\" CTC technology in most instances requires the web consumer to enter his phone number in order for the site operator, or its CSR s, or audio telephony version of an autoresponder, to place the call. CTC technology is now used most often to convert web-based traffic into direct telephone communication between an end user and some other entity. CTC originates out of the older PC2PC telephony whereby a client, or software application, was downloaded onto an end user's own personal computer to interface with the same software running on the other party's computer, to enable a conversation between the two computer users. Current CTC technology requires no consumer download except perhaps for industry standard plugins such as Flash. Indeed, modern CTC technology reportedly evolved out of its PC client-to-client roots as a direct result of consumer reluctance to download what was, then, the necessary software. Such reluctance is familiar, and is commonly ascribed to fear of viruses and other malware. CTC today is a clientless web to phone service, with the call taking place outside of the consumer's computer. This architecture also improves reliability and quality of service. From a smartphone: the click triggers the in phone dialer. In other words in this case, \\"click-to-call\\" actually results in a cellular phone call. True click to call: This uses WebRTC technology to take the call over the data network (regardless if it is a computer or smartphone) using the built in microphone and speaker. Typical implementation The basic form of CTC (Request-a-Call) technology currently in general use is just exactly what Request-a-Call sounds like: an end user enters her phone number through a web dialog box, then an intermediary service calls both that end user and the merchant or other respective third party, and connects the two together for an ordinary telephone conversation. It is instructive to think of this implementation as the familiar three-party call, or conference call. The user wants to talk to a website representative, so the CTC provider calls the user and the representative and then bridges the call between them in one way or another. As to cost, typically the website operator or its client pays for CTC services. It is comparatively rare for a consumer to be charged for CTC services in typical web commerce, except of course in designedly pay-per-call implementations, as may be found on adult websites or other sites with business models involving payment for media presentation. Regardless of who pays, three way calls are more expensive than 2 way calls, so the most cost effective CTC providers drop off after the desired connection is made, preventing pass through of any 3-way call charges. White papers have confirmed that sufficiently advanced Request-a-Call technology improves website conversion rates so much that Forrester Research reported 143% average ROI on implementing it, with $2.5 million in increased revenues over 3 years and initial payback in just 7‚Äì14 months for even the most expensive CTC systems. CTC systems vary greatly in both price and pricing model (flat fee, cost plus, revenue share, etc.). Advanced features The most advanced forms of Request-a-Call technology provide some combination of consumer-transparent call tree avoidance or navigation, synchronized user-side full motion video, and varying degrees of end user behavior tracking, analytics, and data capture. Call tree avoidance or navigation Another way to accomplish the same result is by having particular CTC buttons on a website connected to particular phone numbers, answered by experts in the particular products or services marketed on the pages containing that button. In other words, each CTC button can easily connect the end user to a different person or group, whoever is most appropriate. Virtually any CTC provider can provide the latter solution because it depends only on availability of unique target phone numbers. Amazon, for instance, has implemented the call tree navigation/avoidance technique pervasively, especially for expert-intensive products such as HDTVs. Video Video enhancement is the latest evolution of CTC technology. To understand this implementation, imagine that while the other end of your call is being connected, you're watching TV style video on your computer screen with the synchronized audio presentation coming over the telephone. This high impact implementation of Request-a-Call (CTC) technology is generally used to keep the consumer's interest while the appropriate person he needs to speak to is located, perhaps as the call rolls through sequential call connection attempts, trying, e.g., the target's office direct dial, then cell, then home. From a commercial perspective, the video component is more important as an obvious opportunity for a target to emphasize, cross sell, up sell, or otherwise make an \\"impression,\\" as in \\"cost per impression\\" or CPI, on a consumer-browser-inquiring who otherwise might not be converted to a buyer. Such an impression will generally be made on an extremely well targeted audience, because it will only be made on a consumer who requests it, and from a page that allows the web host to know exactly what the consumer's interest is at precisely the time when that consumer is most likely to be in a buying mood. Video engaging enterprise or video chat Video engaging enterprise commonly termed as video chat is another new form of CTC, whereby the customer can click on a button to connect to an operator who appears on the web page over video and speaks to the customer directly through their PC. The customer can either speak through microphone and speakers or headset, text chat, or use a conventional telephone to communicate with the operator. Some Video Chat systems allow the operator to actually navigate the customer around the website, and even in some cases actually co form-fill with them and process payments. The benefit of this technology is that system operators can build real rapport with customers and answer their questions at a time when they are showing the most interest in a company's products. Lands' End (part of the Sears Corporation) became one of the first retailers in the US to start using the technology in late 2010. Historic and emerging implementation=Autodial An implementation of what was then called CTC technology that was more common in the past was also known as \\"auto-dial.\\" This implementation is actually a misnomer, because all it did was allow a user to click a button to cause her computer to call the number supplied by the website. The user in this instance is actually initiating an outbound call, little different from if she had dialed it herself the old fashioned way. All that she saved by using this version of CTC was the effort of entering a phone number. On the other hand, this simple gimmick gave us the moniker \\"Click to Call,\\" which still seems to stick to all the above better and different technologies.  History and other names used for similar functionality  Other various names used in this subject area have included Web Call, Web Connect, Web Call-Back, Click-to-talk, Web Call Button and Customer Contact Channel Changer (CCCC). CCCC provided \\"click to change customer contact channels\\" from web browsing to talking over the PSTN or over VoIP or over web page/text chat exchange. Most of these began in the mid 1990s in North America with several related US and Canadian patents (Listed Below) being developed. CA 2178705 CUSTOMER CONTACT CHANNEL CHANGER US 5884032 System for coordinating communications via customer contact channel changing system using call center for setting up the call between customer and an available help agent US 6311231 Method and system for coordinating data and voice communications via customer contract channel changing system using voice over IP CA 2391428 SYSTEM FOR OBTAINING HELP OVER A COMMUNICATION SYSTEM BY USING SPECIFIC CUSTOMER CONTACT CHANNELS US 6668286 Method and system for coordinating data and voice communications via customer contact channel changing system over IP Mobile telephones When a user is browsing using a mobile phone, CTC features tend to be more literal. Phone numbers are highlighted in the same manner a hyperlink would be. Clicking the phone number begins the calling process. Similar to the Auto Dialer mode, this would be the same as the end user pressing each digit to call the other number, except that this is a short cut of pressing just the highlighted number once.  Underlying technology  The emergence of click to call applications are now primarily due to WebRTC, which is the underlying protocol that modern browsers are using in order to establish RTC connections. By leveraging WebRTC and various VOIP technologies, various software applications are capable of click to call functionality within a web browser. Consumer concerns Some click-to-call services can have shortcomings, such as nuisance calls that cost whoever is paying for the service. Most experienced providers have heuristics in place to eliminate this issue and sophisticated click-to- call consumers will be conscious of privacy issues in this arrangement. In addition, in the past, at least, click-to-call services may have been impacted by legal issues in countries such as India where VoIP may not be or have been legal. Google maps and rumors In August 2006, the Wall Street Journal reported a joint effort by eBay and Google which would offer CTC, but Google issued a statement by October 7, 2006, which said Google had reconsidered, this was refuted by Google the next day, and claimed that a bug in their system allowed an anonymous user to point that information. Google was later setting up a new beta CTC system, where AdSense users would be able to submit their phone number, and Google would put a call button next to their website link. Now Google Adwords users can set up CTC functionality. In November 2006, Google experimented with a callback process in its Google Maps product but eventually removed the feature. As of January 2008, Google is testing click- to-call for businesses listed in search result pages [2]. Some people have indicated that such failure is due to the fact that Google is using the CTC in the Auto Dialer mode, providing very little benefits to the end users. Other vendors who provide Callback mode fare differently such as Ingenio was acquired by AT&T; Yellow Pages and eStara was acquired by ATG. PI Microsoft's maps.live.com was rumored to have a similar feature, but it appears to have since disabled it. Some users believed that this was a better feature.
